<text>Superman Returns is a 2006 American superhero film directed by Bryan Singer and written by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris from a story by Singer, Dougherty and Harris, based on the DC Comics character Superman. It is the sixth and final installment in the original &quot;Superman&quot; film series and serves as a homage sequel to &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980), ignoring the events of &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983), &quot;Supergirl&quot; (1984), and &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; (1987). The film stars Brandon Routh as Superman, Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, with James Marsden, Frank Langella, Eva Marie Saint and Parker Posey in supporting roles. In the film, Superman returns to Earth after five years and discovers that his love interest Lois Lane has moved on from him and that his archenemy Lex Luthor is planning to kill him and reshape North America.

After a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect &quot;Superman&quot; following the critical and financial failure of &quot;The Quest for Peace&quot;, Warner Bros. Pictures hired Singer to direct &quot;Superman Returns&quot; in July 2004. The majority of principal photography took place at Fox Studios Australia, Sydney while the visual effects sequences were handled by a number of studios, including Sony Pictures Imageworks, Rhythm &amp; Hues Studios (R&amp;H), Framestore CFC, Rising Sun Pictures and The Orphanage; filming began in March 2005 and ended in November.

The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its visual effects, storyline and Singer&#x27;s direction, but criticized its screenplay and runtime. While the film was one of the biggest films of the year, earning $391.1 million on a budget of $204–223 million and becoming the ninth highest-grossing film of 2006, Warner Bros. was disappointed with the worldwide box office return and cancelled a sequel for release in 2009. The &quot;Superman&quot; film series was rebooted twice, first with 2013&#x27;s &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, which was directed by Zack Snyder and starred Henry Cavill as Superman and launched the now-defunct DC Extended Universe, and then 2025&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot;, which is directed by James Gunn, as the first film in the DC Universe. Routh later reprised his role as Superman in the 2019 Arrowverse crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

==Plot==

Superman has been missing for five years, ever since he traveled to the location where astronomers believed they discovered the remains of Krypton. His arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor, has been recently released from prison and married a rich widow to obtain her fortune upon her death. Having failed to find any surviving Kryptonians, Superman returns to Earth and resumes his job at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; in Metropolis as his alter-ego Clark Kent. There, he learns that the woman he loves, Lois Lane, is engaged to Perry White&#x27;s nephew Richard, with whom she has a 5-year-old son named Jason. She has won the Pulitzer Prize for her article &quot;Why the World Doesn&#x27;t Need Superman.&quot; Luthor travels to the Fortress of Solitude and steals Kryptonian crystals, which he uses for an experiment that causes a power outage on the East Coast. The power loss interferes with the flight test of a Space Shuttle to be launched into space from its piggy-back mounting on an airliner occupied by Lois Lane, who is covering the story. Clark flies into action as Superman, launching the shuttle into the sky and stopping the plane from crashing.

The world rejoices at Superman&#x27;s return, though he has difficulty coping with the fact that those he was once close to have moved on from him. When Superman gets distracted by an out-of-control vehicle, a diversion involving Luthor&#x27;s henchwoman Kitty Kowalski, Luthor steals Kryptonite from the Metropolis Museum of Natural History. Perry assigns Lois to interview Superman, while Clark investigates the blackout. Lois and Jason inadvertently board Luthor&#x27;s yacht and are captured after Lois decides to hold interest in the blackout story, which she connects to Luthor&#x27;s experiment. He reveals to them his plan to use one of the stolen Kryptonian crystals, which he has combined with the Kryptonite, to grow a new landmass in the Atlantic Ocean that will supplant the United States and kill billions of people.

Seeing young Jason seemingly have a reaction to Kryptonite, Luthor asks Lois who his father is; Lois asserts that the father is Richard. The crystal begins to create Luthor&#x27;s landmass while Lois attempts to escape but is attacked by one of Luthor&#x27;s henchmen. However, she is saved by Jason, who throws a piano at the man and kills him, confirming that Superman is his father. Meanwhile, Superman attempts to minimize the destruction in Metropolis caused by the new landmass&#x27;s growth, and Richard pilots a sea plane to rescue Lois and Jason.

Confronting Luthor, Superman is weakened by the landmass since it is filled with Kryptonite, allowing Luthor and his henchmen to torture and brutalize him. Superman is stabbed with shard of Kryptonite, falls into the ocean, and is left to drown, but he is rescued by Lois and Richard. After Lois removes the Kryptonite shard from his body, Superman regains his strength and lifts the landmass after putting layers of earth between him and the Kryptonite. Luthor&#x27;s henchmen are killed but Luthor and Kitty escape in their helicopter. Unwilling to let billions of people die, Kitty tosses away the crystals that Lex stole from the Fortress of Solitude before their helicopter runs out of fuel, leaving them stranded on a deserted island.

Superman pushes the landmass with the crystals into space. Weakened by the Kryptonite, he crashes back to Earth. At the hospital, after removing another shard of Kryptonite from Superman&#x27;s body, doctors learn that they cannot penetrate his skin with their surgical tools, and he remains in a coma. While visiting Superman, Lois whispers something into his ear and kisses him. Superman awakens and visits the sleeping Jason, to whom he recites the last speech from his late biological father Jor-El. As Lois starts writing an article entitled &quot;Why the World Needs Superman&quot;, Superman reassures her that he is back to stay and flies off to low orbit, where he gazes down at the world.

==Cast==
* Brandon Routh as Clark Kent / Superman: The Kryptonian superhero whose alter-ego is a mild-mannered farmer-turned-journalist.
* Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane: A reporter who works with Clark Kent at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, and former lover of Superman.
* James Marsden as Richard White: The nephew of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; editor-in-chief Perry White and fiancé to Lois Lane. Marsden said Richard acts as an emotional challenge for Superman, since the hero comes back to find that &quot;Lois Lane picks somebody who&#x27;s very Supermanesque&quot;.
* Frank Langella as Perry White: The editor of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.
* Eva Marie Saint as Martha Kent: Clark Kent&#x27;s adoptive mother.
* Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski: Lex Luthor&#x27;s henchwoman. She served as a prison nurse and would give Lex his examinations. The character is based on Eve Teschmacher from the 1978 film, portrayed by Valerie Perrine.
* Kal Penn as Stanford: One of Luthor&#x27;s henchmen.
* Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen: A photographer at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; and a friend of Clark.
* Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor: A sociopath scientist armed with vast resources and an extensive knowledge of science who is Superman&#x27;s nemesis. Spacey&#x27;s version of Luthor retains some campy attributes and a similar interest in real estate from the earlier Gene Hackman version, but is also more serious and threatening than Hackman&#x27;s portrayal. Spacey said that director Singer told him to play the character as &quot;darker and more bitter&quot; compared to Hackman and not to use the earlier portrayal as an inspiration.
* Tristan Lake Leabu as Jason White: The biological son of Lois Lane and Superman. The question of whether Superman or Richard is Jason&#x27;s father is initially unclear. He suffers from asthma and other ailments, but it is later revealed that he is the son of Superman, when he displays superhuman strength and discomfort around Kryptonite.

Marlon Brando appears posthumously as Jor-El, Superman&#x27;s late biological father. Brando, who died in 2004, reprises his role from the 1978 film through the use of previous footage combined with computer-generated imagery, his footage, filmed before by Richard Donner for &quot;Superman II&quot; before his dismissal, were rescued for the making of &quot;Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut&quot;. This required negotiations with Brando&#x27;s estate for permission to have his footage used. Singer explained, &quot;We had access to all of the Brando footage that was shot. There was unused footage that had Brando reciting poems, trailing off subject and swearing like a sailor.&quot;

Peta Wilson appears as NASA spokeswoman Bobbie-Faye. Jack Larson, who portrayed Jimmy Olsen in the 1950s television series &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;, makes a cameo appearance as Bo the bartender. Noel Neill—who portrayed Lois Lane in the television series and the film serials &quot;Superman&quot; (1948) and &quot;Atom Man vs. Superman&quot; (1950)—appears as Luthor&#x27;s elderly wife Gertrude Vanderworth. Richard Branson cameos as the engineer aboard the space shuttle. Another of Luthor&#x27;s henchmen (Riley) is played by Australian Rugby League footballer Ian Roberts.
==Production==

Director, screenwriter and producer Bryan Singer conceived the storyline of &quot;Superman returning to Earth after a five-year absence&quot; during the filming of &quot;X2&quot; (2003). He presented the idea to &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000) and &quot;X2&quot; producer Lauren Shuler Donner and her husband Richard Donner, director of &quot;Superman&quot; (1978). Donner greeted Singer&#x27;s idea with positive feedback.

In March 2004, Warner Bros. Pictures was commencing pre-production on &quot;Superman: Flyby&quot;, which had a target theatrical release date of June 2006. McG was signed to direct with a script by J. J. Abrams, but dropped out in June 2004. That same month, Singer was approached by Warner Bros. to pitch his idea for &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, as he was preparing to leave for Hawaii on a short vacation with his &quot;X2&quot; writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. While in Hawaii, Singer, Dougherty and Harris began to outline the film treatment. In July 2004, Singer signed on to direct and develop &quot;Superman Returns&quot;.

Although he was not a comic book fan, Singer was most impressed with Donner&#x27;s 1978 film, citing it as an influence of his, Dougherty and Harris&#x27;s writing. With Singer&#x27;s hiring, he dropped out of &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; (2006) and also had the &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; remake pushed back. &quot;Superman Returns&quot; was financed 50/50 between Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures, and pre-production began in November 2004. By February 2005, Dougherty and Harris had written six drafts of the script. Early versions of the script contained references to the September 11 attacks before they were removed.

===Casting===
Jim Caviezel expressed interest in playing the role of Superman but Singer believed only an unknown actor would be suitable for the part of Superman. Brandon Routh was chosen from thousands of candidates interviewed at casting calls in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. He had coincidentally auditioned for Clark Kent in the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, losing to Tom Welling. Routh had also met director Joseph &quot;McG&quot; Nichol for the role during pre-production of &quot;&quot;. Dana Reeve, wife of Christopher Reeve, believed Routh&#x27;s physical resemblance to her late husband was striking. To obtain the muscular physique to play Superman convincingly, Routh underwent a strict bodybuilding exercise regimen. Prior to Routh&#x27;s casting, Singer had &quot;X2&quot; actor Daniel Cudmore audition. Henry Cavill, Sam Heughan and Chris Pratt also auditioned; Cavill would later portray Superman in several DC Extended Universe films.

Kevin Spacey was the only actor considered for Lex Luthor, because of his Academy Award-winning performance in Singer&#x27;s film &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995), and friendship with the director. The writers specifically had Spacey in mind for the part when writing the script.

For the part of Lois Lane, Spacey recommended Kate Bosworth to Singer for the role, because she had co-starred with Spacey in &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; (2004) as Sandra Dee. Claire Danes and Keri Russell were reportedly also considered. Amy Adams, who would later be cast as Lois Lane in the 2013 reboot &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, confirmed in an interview that she had also auditioned for Lois in 2005. Adams had previously auditioned for Lois in 2003 when Brett Ratner was planning to direct &quot;Superman: Flyby&quot;. Bosworth studied Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s acting for inspiration, particularly in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940) and &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; (1967), as well as Julia Roberts in &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; (2000).

Hugh Laurie was originally cast as Perry White, but he was unable to film due to commitments to the TV show &quot;House&quot;; so the part went to Frank Langella.

Parker Posey was the only actress considered for the role of Kitty Kowalski.

Singer offered the role of Jimmy Olsen to Shawn Ashmore, but declined due to his commitments to &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, coincidentally his twin brother Aaron Ashmore played the role in the TV show &quot;Smallville&quot;; the part went to Sam Huntington.

===Filming===

Warner Bros. Pictures considered shooting &quot;Superman Returns&quot; at Village Roadshow Studios in the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. After filming, this could have been used as an attraction for the adjoining Warner Bros. Movie World theme park, but the idea was scrapped for being too expensive. Set construction started in January 2005 at Fox Studios Australia for the film&#x27;s 60 setpieces, while the start date was pushed back for two weeks. In an attempt to avoid public attention, &quot;Superman Returns&quot; carried the fake working title of &quot;Red Sun&quot; during filming. Starting in late March 2005, principal photography lasted until November. Filming of &quot;Superman Returns&quot; in New South Wales constituted hiring thousands of local workers, generating over $100 million into the local economy. 80% of filming took place at Fox Studios Australia, occupying all nine sound stages. Scenes set in Smallville were shot at Breeza, while the Australian Museum doubled for the Metropolis Museum of Natural History.

===Design and visual effects===

&quot;Superman Returns&quot; was shot using Panavision&#x27;s Genesis digital camera. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Johnson Wax Headquarters for the design of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. ESC Entertainment was originally set to design the visual effects sequences, but Warner Bros. replaced them with the hiring of Mark Stetson from Sony Pictures Imageworks as the visual effects supervisor. A total of 1,400 visual effects shots were created. The script required a scene of Superman safely delivering a Boeing 777 in a baseball park where computer-generated imagery was used as it would have been impossible to assemble the number of extras for the shots. A second unit crew headed by Dan Bradley and Brian Smrz traveled to Dodger Stadium to photograph elements that were composited into the final images. The scenes of Metropolis was actually a modified version of the skyline of Manhattan. Using footage from the original &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) film as a reference point, Marlon Brando was re-created by Rhythm &amp; Hues Studios using CGI. The opening credits for &quot;Superman Returns&quot; are presented in an intended recreation of the style used for &quot;Superman&quot;, again to the accompaniment of John Williams&#x27;s theme music.

===Music===

Singer hired regular collaborator John Ottman as editor and film score composer months before the script was written. Ottman said in past interviews that John Williams, who composed the 1978 film, had influenced his decision to become a musician. He was both cautious and enthusiastic to work on &quot;Superman Returns&quot;. Ottman commented: &quot;Bryan [Singer] said he wouldn&#x27;t even greenlight the movie if he couldn&#x27;t use the John Williams music. It was important for me to preserve the Williams theme right down to every single note for the opening titles&quot;. Ottman referred to his work on &quot;Superman Returns&quot; as a homage to, not a ripoff of, Williams.

===Budget===
Originally budgeted at $184.5 million, Warner Bros. placed the final production cost at $223 million, coming down to $204 million after factoring in tax rebates and incentives. Taking into account the development costs since the early 1990s, total expenditure is estimated to be around $263 million, with up to a further $100 million spent on worldwide marketing.

==Marketing==
Warner Bros. promoted &quot;Superman Returns&quot; at 2005 San Diego Comic-Con. Singer and screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris came up with the idea of publishing a prequel limited series, spanning four comic book issues. The stories were written by Jimmy Palmiotti, Marc Andreyko, and Justin Gray, with artwork by Karl Kerschl and Matt Haley. During production, a series of &quot;video diaries&quot; on the Internet were released at BlueTights.net, showing behind-the-scenes work being done. After 27 installments, the video diaries stopped for a while shortly before the teaser trailer debuted on November 18, 2005, with &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;. The main theatrical trailer debuted online on May 2, 2006. That trailer appeared in theaters on May 5, with prints of &quot;&quot;, while the international trailer came with &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;. DC Comics published a comics adaptation by artist Matt Haley and writer Martin Pasko, Marv Wolfman wrote a novelization, and Electronic Arts developed a video game based on both the movie and the comics.

The estimated cost of marketing &quot;Superman Returns&quot; in the United States was $45.5 million, the second-highest of the year behind Disney&#x27;s $53.5 million campaign for &quot;Cars&quot;. Warner Bros. made tie-in deals with General Mills, Burger King, Cheetos, Duracell, Pepsi, Doritos, Papa John&#x27;s Pizza, 7-Eleven and Colgate. The film was also advertised with Red Bull Racing Formula One cars at the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix. David Coulthard managed to get the team&#x27;s first top three finish that day; on the podium, he wore a Superman cape in celebration of his achievement. NASCAR Sprint Cup champion Jeff Gordon also sported the &quot;Man of Steel&quot; look by promoting the movie on his #24 Chevrolet Monte Carlo in the 2006 Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway. Troy Bayliss appeared in promotional &quot;Superman&quot; leathers and sported a cape on the podium following a win and a 2nd place at the 2006 Brands Hatch Superbike World Championship round on his way to winning that year&#x27;s championship. The National Geographic Channel released &quot;The Science of Superman&quot; on June 29, 2006: a television special that studied popular science analogies with the Superman mythos. Singer admitted at 2006 Comic-Con International that he was dissatisfied with the marketing and promotion. &quot;A lot of people did their job, and a lot didn&#x27;t&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===

Bryan Singer convinced Warner Bros. not to experiment with test screenings. In addition, Singer removed 15 minutes of footage from &quot;Superman Returns&quot; after showing it to some of his &quot;trusted associates&quot;. The final theatrical time length ran at 154 minutes. Warner Bros. originally slated the movie for release on Friday, June 30, but moved it up to Wednesday, June 28. &quot;Superman Returns&quot; was released on June 28, 2006, in the United States and Canada in 4,065 theaters. During its opening day, it earned $21 million, becoming the eighth-highest Wednesday opening day and the second-highest for a superhero film, behind &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. The film ranked at the top in its opening weekend, grossing $52.5 million. With a total gross of $84.6 million, &quot;Superman Returns&quot; dethroned &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; to have the biggest five-day Wednesday opening for a Warner Bros. film.

&quot;Superman Returns: An IMAX 3D Experience&quot; was released simultaneously in 111 IMAX-format theaters worldwide, which included 20 minutes of converted 3D film material. It was the first Hollywood full-length live-action film to be released in this combined format. One of the key scenes Singer took out was &quot;the Return to Krypton sequence&quot;. Ten million dollars was spent on this sequence alone, but it was deleted. Singer noted that it could not be released as part of a DVD featurette because it was converted to IMAX 3D. He hoped it could have appeared in an IMAX reissue. The film&#x27;s second-week gross rapidly declined by 58% from the first week, due to the presence of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; and &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;. By October, the film had crossed the $200 million mark, becoming the fifth film of the 2006 summer season to do so. &quot;Superman Returns&quot; went on to gross $200.1 million in North America and $191 million internationally, earning $391.1 million worldwide. Domestically, the film was the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2006. In worldwide totals, &quot;Superman Returns&quot; was ninth-highest.

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Superman Returns&quot; has an approval rating of 74% based on 267 reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Bryan Singer&#x27;s reverent and visually decadent adaptation gives the Man of Steel welcome emotional complexity. The result: a satisfying stick-to-your-ribs adaptation.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 72 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; praised &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, calling it one of the best superhero films. He was mostly impressed with Singer&#x27;s direction and the storyline. Joe Morgenstern from &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; also gave a positive review, but observed Routh&#x27;s and Bosworth&#x27;s acting was &quot;somewhat dead or super average. Nothing special.&quot; Morgenstern believed Lex Luthor&#x27;s characterization was &quot;well written by the writers and well played by Kevin Spacey&quot;. He also praised Newton Thomas Sigel&#x27;s cinematography and Guy Hendrix Dyas&#x27;s production design.

Peter Travers, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, felt the film &quot;perfectly updates Superman for the modern audience&quot;. J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it &quot;surprisingly well made. It&#x27;s a summer blockbuster filled with mythology and sensitivity.&quot; James Berardinelli reacted positively to the movie, comparing it favorably with Richard Donner&#x27;s 1978 film. He felt Spacey was better than Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, describing him as &quot;more cruel and less flippant&quot; than Hackman. &quot;There are no miscasts to be found in the supporting cast, either,&quot; Berardinelli said. &quot;&quot;Superman Returns&quot; is near the top, if not at the top of the superhero movie pile. It offers nearly everything: romance, action, humor, and plenty of goose bumps.&quot;

However, Roger Ebert argued the film was a &quot;glum, lackluster movie in which even the big effects sequences seem dutiful instead of exhilarating.&quot; He also felt that &quot;Brandon Routh lacks charisma as Superman&quot;, surmising that he &quot;may have been cast because he looks a little like Reeve&quot;. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; felt that Warner Bros. should have rebooted the series along the lines of &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. He also felt Bosworth, at 22 years old, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not &quot;match the potential of the tiring 154-minute-long film&quot;.

===Other commentary===
On May 3, 2009, almost three years after the debut of &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino declared his appreciation for Bryan Singer&#x27;s directorial work on &quot;Superman Returns&quot; and that he would write a 20-page review about &quot;Superman Returns&quot;.

On January 9, 2012, more than five years after the movie was released, the independent film community daily news site IndieWire released a two-part video essay that probes the melancholic nature of &quot;Superman Returns&quot;. Produced by Matt Zoller Seitz and Ken Cancelosi, the critique was inspired by a review that Seitz wrote for the &quot;New York Press&quot; in 2006, in which he stated that &quot;From the moment its hero returns to the sky to rescue Lois Lane from a plummeting jet, &quot;Superman Returns&quot; flirts with greatness.&quot;

In 2013, Singer stated that &quot;Superman Returns&quot; was made for &quot;Perhaps more of a female audience. It wasn&#x27;t what it needed to be, I guess.&quot; Singer stated that he would have cut about the first quarter off of the film and started it with &quot;the jet disaster sequence or something. I could have grabbed the audience a little more quickly. I don&#x27;t know what would have helped. Probably nothing. If I could go again, I would do an origin. I would reboot it.&quot;

&quot;Empire&quot; ranked the movie 496 on its &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot; list, stating, &quot;It may have been a slighter return than some people had hoped for, but Singer&#x27;s vision of the &quot;Man of Steel&quot; is an heroic effort. Plenty of spectacle and a lot of heart helps Kal-El soar.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Superman Returns&quot; was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects, losing to &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot;. The film was successful at the 33rd Saturn Awards, winning Best Fantasy Film, and categories for Direction (Bryan Singer), Best Actor (Brandon Routh), Writing (Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) and Music (John Ottman). Kate Bosworth, Tristan Lake Leabu, James Marsden, Parker Posey, and the visual effects department were nominated for categories. However, Bosworth was also nominated a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress.
==Home media==

&quot;Superman Returns&quot; debuted on DVD on November 28, 2006, in two versions, one with a single-disc, and a double-disc edition which featured over three hours of behind-the-scenes features. That same day, a 14-disc DVD box set titled &quot;Superman Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; was released, containing special editions of all five &quot;Superman&quot; films, as well as the documentary &quot;Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman&quot;. It debuted at the top spot of the DVD charts, and also generated $13 million in rentals during its first week.
The film was also released in both high-definition formats, HD DVD, which featured both standard and high definitions on the same disc, and Blu-ray. It was the best-selling title on both formats in 2006, and was among the best-sellers of both formats of 2007.

==Legacy==
===Cancelled sequel===

In February 2006, four months before the release of &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, Warner Bros. announced a mid-2009 theatrical release date for a sequel, with Bryan Singer reprising his directing duties. Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, Sam Huntington, Frank Langella, and Tristan Lake Leabu were to reprise their roles. Due to his commitment, Singer dropped out of directing a remake of &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; and an adaptation of &quot;The Mayor of Castro Street&quot;. Writer Michael Dougherty wanted the sequel to be &quot;action packed&quot;, featuring &quot;other Kryptonians&quot; with Brainiac and Bizarro also considered for primary villains. The &quot;New Krypton&quot; landmass floating in space at the end of &quot;Superman Returns&quot; would have served as a plot device. Although &quot;Superman Returns&quot; received mostly positive reviews, Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures were disappointed by the film&#x27;s box office return. Warner Bros. President Alan F. Horn explained that &quot;Superman Returns&quot; was a very successful film, but that it &quot;should have done $500 million worldwide. We should have had perhaps a little more action to satisfy the young male crowd.&quot; Singer reacted incredulously to the studio complaints, saying, &quot;That movie made $400 million! I don&#x27;t know what constitutes under-performing these days...&quot; $175 million was the maximum budget Warner Bros. was projecting for the sequel, as &quot;Superman Returns&quot; cost $204 million.

Filming for the &quot;Superman Returns&quot; sequel was to start in mid-2007, before Singer halted development in favor of &quot;Valkyrie&quot;. Filming was then pushed to March 2008, but writers Dougherty and Dan Harris left in favor of other career opportunities. The 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike pushed the release date to 2010. Singer still listed the sequel as a priority in March 2008, saying that the film was in early development. Routh expected filming to begin in early 2009. Paul Levitz, president of DC Comics, expected Routh to reprise the title role from &quot;Superman Returns&quot; before his contract for a sequel expired in 2009. However, with Warner Bros. deciding to reboot the film series, Singer dropped out in favor of directing &quot;Jack the Giant Slayer&quot;. In August 2008, Warner Bros. President of Production Jeff Robinov reflected, &quot;&quot;Superman Returns&quot; didn&#x27;t quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to. It didn&#x27;t position the character the way he needed to be positioned. Had &quot;Superman&quot; worked in 2006, we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009. Now the plan is just to reintroduce Superman without regard to a Batman and Superman movie at all.&quot;

===Arrowverse===

Brandon Routh reprised his role as Clark Kent / Superman in the 2019 Arrowverse TV series crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, in addition to playing Ray Palmer / The Atom, a character he introduced on &quot;Arrow&quot; and played on &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;. Executive producer Marc Guggenheim was reluctant to call Routh&#x27;s crossover appearance a sequel when addressing whether the character&#x27;s appearance would constitute a sequel to &quot;Superman Returns&quot;. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s for me to say. We&#x27;re picking up so many years after the events of that movie, maybe a coda is a better word than sequel.&quot;

Set on Earth-96 in the multiverse of the Arrowverse, this version of Superman has become an aged and beleaguered superhero similar to the iteration from the DC Comics&#x27; mini-series &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;; adopting a black belt and an S-shield with a black background as a sign of mourning after losing his friends, notably Perry White and Jimmy Olsen, as well as his wife Lois (having been married at some point after revealing his secrets to her) to a terrorist attack on the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; by a psychopath from Gotham City. He is also similar to another iteration, Kal-L (remained working as a newspaper&#x27;s editor-in-chief instead of going into seclusion after what happened), making this Superman an amalgam of the two, as well as being a facsimile to Ray Palmer as a multiversal counterpart. As the Monitor recruited heroes from across the multiverse to avert a Crisis caused by the Anti-Monitor, he specifically wanted to find &quot;a Kryptonian who suffered a greater loss than most mortal men could endure&quot; called the Paragon of Truth. During the event, Superman also references the events from &quot;Superman III&quot; when the good Clark Kent fought an evil version of Superman, as well as his son Jason (implying that he had discovered his true paternity) from &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, which implies the Arrowverse retconned the Reeve/Routh Superman continuity so that &quot;Superman III&quot;, and possibly even &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; and &quot;Supergirl&quot;, did happen after all, and possibly now take place after &quot;Superman Returns&quot;. After the Anti-Monitor Crisis was averted and the multiverse was rebooted, Superman of Earth-96 is seen wearing a yellow S-shield and belt as he flies away.

<text>Bretislaus II (; – 22 December 1100) was the duke of Bohemia from 14 September 1092 until his death in 1100. He was the eldest son of King Vratislaus II and Adelaide, daughter of Andrew I of Hungary. He was a major enemy of paganism.

== Life ==
He succeeded his uncle Conrad I and worked for the destruction of the old Slavic culture. In 1097, he expelled the Slavonic monks of the monastery in Sazava founded in 1033 by Procopius. Bretislaus also wished to end the elective principle of succession and replace it with a type of seniorate as conceptualised by Bretislaus I: the eldest prince of the reigning family would hold Bohemia as sovereign over the entire state while the younger scions of the dynasty would rule as territorial dukes over the regions of Moravia. This was to the benefit of his half-brother Bořivoj II. He invested Bořivoj as duke of Brno in 1097, thus removing the sons of Conrad I from the succession. Bretislaus also succeeded in receiving a long-desired imperial investiture at the Diet of Regensburg on 19 April 1099. Bretislaus was assassinated by his adversaries at the hunting lodge of Zbecno in western Bohemia on 22 December 1100.

== Marriage ==
In 1094 Bretislaus married Luitgard of Windberg, with whom he had one son: Bretislaus, who rebelled against Soběslav I and was killed on 8 March 1130.

<text>The Rivière du Loup () is a river in eastern Quebec, Canada, which empties on the south shore of Saint Lawrence River at the city of Rivière-du-Loup, which is part of the regional county municipality (RCM) Rivière-du-Loup, in the administrative region of Bas-Saint-Laurent.

There is a hydroelectric plant on the river near the city.

== Geography ==
The Rivière du Loup (English: &quot;river of the Wolf&quot;) has its source in Saint-Pierre Lake (&quot;Lac Saint-Pierre&quot;) in the geographic township of Painchaud in the Kamouraska Regional County Municipality, which is in the Notre Dame Mountains and the Zone d&#x27;exploitation contrôlée (English: Controlled Harvesting Zone) of Zec Chapais. This lake is located 36.5 km (23 miles) east of the southeast coast of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, 20 km (12 miles) southeast of the village center of Saint-Bruno-of-Kamouraska and 20 km (12 miles) south-west of the village center of Saint-Athanase.

The Rivière du Loup flows to the north over 101.3 kilometers (63 miles), coursing through the regional county municipalities of:
* MRC Kamouraska: municipalities (starting from the upstream)
** Mont-Carmel
** Saint-Bruno-de-Kamouraska
** Sainte-Hélène-de-Kamouraska
** Saint-Joseph-de-Kamouraska
** Saint-Alexandre-de-Kamouraska
* MRC Rivière-du-Loup: municipalities (starting from the upstream)
** Saint-Antonin
** Notre-Dame-du-Portage
** Rivière-du-Loup city.

At its mouth, the Rivière du Loup pours over a long ledge (at low tide) in the &quot;Cayes to Carrier Bay&quot; which is bordered on the north side by the Pointe-de-Rivière-du-Loup. From Malin Rock, this edge advances towards the southwest in the St. Lawrence River over a length of 1.6 km (1 mile), including the end where a marina is fitted.

The river&#x27;s mouth is located in front of the &quot;Île aux Lièvres&quot; (English: Island of Hare) and the &quot;Île Blanche&quot; (English: White Island), located 10 km (6 miles) offshore and part of the municipality of Saint-André-de-Kamouraska. The Channel &quot;Pot à l&#x27;Eau-de-Vie&quot; (English: &quot;Pot of stream water&quot;) separates the island and the southeast coast of St. Lawrence River. The Estuary Islands Wildlife Reserve (&quot;Réserve faunique des Îles de l&#x27;Estuaire&quot;) was built on a set of islands between the &quot;Île aux Lièvres&quot; and the channel &quot;Pot à l&#x27;Eau-de-Vie&quot;.

== Toponymy ==
The river&#x27;s name means Wolf River in French and may have come from a native tribe known as &quot;Les Loups&quot; or from the many seals, known in French as &quot;loup marin&quot;, once found at the river&#x27;s mouth.

<text>USS &quot;Kennison&quot; (DD–138) was a in the United States Navy during World War II, later redesignated AG-83. She was the first ship named for William Kennison.

&quot;Kennison&quot; was launched on 8 June 1918 by the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California; sponsored by Miss Elizabeth Riner; and commissioned on 2 April 1919.

==Service history==
Following completion, shakedown, and acceptance trials, &quot;Kennison&quot; arrived in San Diego, her home port, 25 March 1920. During the summer she engaged in experimental torpedo and antiaircraft exercises. The destroyer continued coastal operations and tactical exercises until 12 August 1921 when she put into San Diego with 50 percent complement. She decommissioned at San Diego on 22 June 1922.

Recommissioned 18 December 1939, &quot;Kennison&quot; joined the Neutrality Patrol out of San Diego on 6 May 1940. From June to September she engaged in reserve training cruises before rejoining the Neutrality Patrol on 14 October. The destroyer continued patrol operations along the West Coast until the United States entered World War II. As the war effort increased in early 1942, &quot;Kennison&quot; intensified her anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations including escort of convoys and submarines to various California ports until 22 September 1944 when she sailed for Bremerton, Washington to undergo conversion.

Redesignated AG-83, &quot;Kennison&quot; returned to San Diego on 9 November 1944 to resume service. For the rest of the war she operated out of San Diego as a target ship for plane exercises with aerial torpedoes. These exercises provided training to Navy pilots preparing for combat. Following the war &quot;Kennison&quot; sailed for the East Coast, arriving at Norfolk, Virginia in late October. She decommissioned on 21 November 1945 at Portsmouth, Virginia. She was sold 18 November 1946 to Luria Brothers &amp; Company, Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and scrapped.

<doc id="1082682" wikidata="Q453056" url="?curid=1082682" title="Bořivoj II, Duke of Bohemia">
<text>Bořivoj II ( 1064 – 2 February 1124) was the duke of Bohemia from 25 December 1100 until May 1107 and from December 1117 until 16 August 1120. He was the younger half-brother and successor of Bretislaus II. His father was Vratislav II of Bohemia, his mother Świętosława of Poland.

== Life ==
He was originally opposed by Duke Ulrich I of Brno, his cousin, who had recovered the stronghold originally confiscated from his father. A civil war ensued. Oldřich intended to recognise the suzerainty of Emperor Henry IV, and thereby gain his support, but Bořivoj had already been confirmed by the emperor. Oldřich was eventually forced to flee to Moravia.

In 1102, Ladislaus I Herman, Duke of Poland, died. A quarrel broke out in Poland over the succession, with Bořivoj and his cousin Svatopluk supporting Zbigniew against Bolesław III Wrymouth. Bolesław, however, paid Bořivoj off and the latter withdrew from the conflict. Svatopluk, furious, defected and led a number of Bohemian grandees with him. He sought to induce Coloman of Hungary to go to war with Bořivoj, but was unsuccessful until 1107. In that year, Bořivoj&#x27;s younger brother Vladislaus rebelled and, with Coloman&#x27;s help, took Prague. Svatopluk, who had recently captured and been forced to release Bořivoj by Emperor Henry V, was proclaimed king.

Bořivoj attacked in 1108 with the aid of Bolesław in alliance with Coloman, whom Svatopluk and Henry were jointly attacking in Hungary. Svatopluk was recalled to fight him off and soon the emperor was invading Poland. Svatopluk was murdered on this campaign by supporters of Bořivoj, but he could not regain the throne, which went to Vladislaus. In 1117, the brothers were reconciled and they ruled the duchy jointly (though divided) until 1120, when a new disagreement led Bořivoj to self-exile in Hungary, where he died on 2 February 1124.

== Marriage ==
He was married to Gerberga, daughter of Leopold II, Margrave of Austria. Their children are:
* Jaromir, +by 1135;
* Spitignev, +3.1.1157
* Lupold, fl 1143
* Boleslav, fl 1146
* Albrecht, +7.4. before 1124

<text>Richard Barham Middleton (28 October 1882 – 1 December 1911) was an English poet and author. He is remembered most for his short ghost stories, in particular &quot;The Ghost Ship&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Staines, Middlesex, Middleton was educated at Cranbrook School, Kent. He then worked as a clerk at the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation bank in London from 1901 to 1907. Unhappy with that, he affected a Bohemian life at night – he is mentioned, in disguised terms, in Arthur Ransome&#x27;s &quot;Bohemia in London&quot;. He moved out of his parents&#x27; house into rooms in Blackfriars and joined the New Bohemians, a club where he acquired literary contacts, including Arthur Machen, Louis McQuilland (1880–1946) and Christopher Wilson.

Middleton became an editor at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; under Edgar Jepson, where he confided to his fellow editor Frank Harris that he really wanted to make a living as a poet. Shortly afterwards, Harris published Middleton&#x27;s poem &quot;The Bathing Boy&quot;:

His work was also published by Austin Harrison in &quot;The English Review&quot;, and he wrote book reviews for &quot;The Academy&quot;.

Middleton suffered from severe depression, then termed melancholia. He spent his last nine months in Brussels, where in December 1911, at age 29, he took his life by poisoning himself with chloroform, which had been prescribed as a remedy for his condition. His literary reputation was sustained by Edgar Jepson and Arthur Machen, the latter in an introduction to Middleton&#x27;s collection &quot;The Ghost Ship and Other Stories&quot;, and later by John Gawsworth. His stories appeared in several anthologies.

An encounter with Middleton is said to have persuaded the young Raymond Chandler to postpone his career as a writer. Chandler wrote, &quot;Middleton struck me as having far more talent than I was ever likely to possess; and if he couldn&#x27;t make a go of it, it wasn&#x27;t very likely that I could.&quot;

<doc id="1082691" wikidata="Q7542151" url="?curid=1082691" title="Slower ball">
<text>In the sport of cricket, a slower ball is a slower-than-usual delivery from a fast bowler. The bowler&#x27;s intention is to deceive the batsman into playing too early so that he either misses the ball completely or hits it high up in the air to offer an easy catch. It is analogous to a changeup in baseball.

The slower ball, also known as the &#x27;Wandi ball&#x27; technique was popularised in response to the demands of limited-overs cricket, not only to get wickets but also to slow down the scoring rate, as a slower ball will not carry to the boundary as easily as a normal fast delivery if it is hit square or behind the wicket. It is especially used in the last ten or so overs as variation in speed, in addition to line and length, is the key to preventing a late flurry of runs from the batsmen.

To be effective, the slower ball must be directed at or near the stumps in order to force the batsman to play, and the bowler&#x27;s action must appear entirely normal. There are various tricks that the bowler can employ to slow the ball down:

* Bowling from the &quot;back of the hand&quot;, effectively a fast googly
* Bowling with &quot;split fingers&quot;: the fingers are placed either side of the seam of the ball, and the ball is bowled full-length; when done correctly the delivery will appear to be a full toss until it suddenly drops. A similar technique is used to throw the split-finger fastball in baseball. Sri Lankan Dilhara Fernando holds the ball between the index and middle finger, and just fits it in the webbing between the two. This leads to the delivery of a slow loopy ball
*Bowling a &quot;knuckleball&quot;, where the ball is held on the knuckles of the index and middle fingers. To a batsman, it resembles a stock ball due to it appearing as if the bowler was holding the ball in a regulation manner
* &quot;Off cutter&quot;: instead of placing the index and middle fingers in the orthodox position together on the seam, the middle finger is moved round the ball slightly and then pulled down as the ball is released. The ball will tend to &quot;break&quot; or &quot;cut in&quot; from left to right as it pitches, as it does with off spin bowling. It can be effective to only bowl this ball with a single finger on top and it typically rests to the right hand side of the seam
* &quot;Leg cutter&quot;: the same as an off cutter except that the fingers go the other way and the ball will tend to cut from right to left. Harder to keep straight than an off cutter
* &quot;Palm ball&quot;: the ball is held in the palm instead of the fingers; this can be effective but is hard to disguise 
* Holding the ball deeper in the fingers. Typically, quick bowlers hold the ball at their fingertips. Holding the ball deeper within the fingers slows the release of the ball. Brett Lee is an exponent of this method
* Reduction in the speed of the action: Can be quite effective as a &quot;different&quot; type of change of pace. Effectively you change only the rotation of your arm and retain your action 
*Cross-seam: This type of slower delivery is also popularly employed by medium pacers wherein the bowler holds the ball across the seam instead of holding it on the seam thereby the pace of delivery is reduced when the ball hits the ground. New Zealand medium pace bowler Gavin Larsen used this effectively in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. This can be coupled with a &quot;split fingers&quot; style release to result in a delivery which dips sharply at the end of its trajectory or spits from a pitched-up length
* &quot;Zero rotation&quot;: Using a specific type of grip &amp; release it is possible to impart little or no rotation on the ball. This lack of rotation causes an instability in air pressure, which makes the ball move erratically through the air
* &quot;Single finger&quot;: Using a variation on the in-swinger grip where the index finger and thumb are both fully on the seam of the ball and the second finger barely touches it. Less force on the ball at the point of release results in reduced pace
* &quot;Thumb ball&quot;: Bowled using the same grip as a stock delivery, barring the palm position, which is facing up instead of down, so that it looks like a back of the hand grip. This can be an effective delivery, but it is hard to produce

==Faster ball==
Although a slower ball is usually the result when a bowler tries a change of pace, some bowlers have a delivery which is even faster. Pakistani Imran Khan was one example: in his coaching book, he mentioned that it was far more effective to have a faster ball than a slower one. 

Spinners and slow bowlers generally employ the faster ball more often than pacemen. Pakistan&#x27;s Shahid Afridi has used this ball quite successfully over his career.

<doc id="1082693" wikidata="Q767871" url="?curid=1082693" title="Caravan (band)">
<text>Caravan are an English rock band from the Canterbury area, founded by former Wilde Flowers members David Sinclair, Richard Sinclair, Pye Hastings, and Richard Coughlan in 1968. The band have never achieved the great commercial success that was widely predicted for them at the beginning of their career, but are nevertheless considered a key part of the Canterbury scene of progressive rock acts, blending psychedelic rock, jazz, and classical influences to create a distinctive sound.

The band were originally based in Whitstable, Kent, near Canterbury, but moved to London when briefly signed to Verve Records. After being dropped by Verve, the band signed to Decca Records, where they released their most critically acclaimed album, &quot;In the Land of Grey and Pink&quot;, in 1971. Dave Sinclair left after the album&#x27;s release and the group split up the following year. Hastings and Coughlan added new members, notably viola player Geoffrey Richardson, continuing on before splitting in 1978.

The band reformed several times in the following decades, and Caravan still remain active as a live band in the 21st century, despite Coughlan&#x27;s death in December 2013.

==History==

===Early career===
The group&#x27;s original members, David Sinclair, Richard Sinclair, Pye Hastings and Richard Coughlan had all been in the Canterbury-based Wilde Flowers, albeit not at the same time. Richard Sinclair had been an early member, but left in September 1965 to study at college. Hastings had replaced Robert Wyatt as the group&#x27;s singer and Coughlan as drummer in the band when Wyatt, who performed both roles, formed Soft Machine. David Sinclair joined the group in late 1966, but after future Soft Machine member Hugh Hopper left the group in June the following year, they began to run out of momentum and broke up in October 1967.

Coughlan, Hastings and the two Sinclairs subsequently formed Caravan in 1968. &quot;We all had the same goal&quot; recalled Richard Sinclair, &quot;to make our music, write it ourselves, and make a living from it.&quot; The band rented a house in Whitstable, Kent for six months, where they began to write and rehearse new material. They also borrowed Soft Machine&#x27;s PA for rehearsals while that band was on tour with Jimi Hendrix in the US, as Caravan did not have enough funds for their own equipment. They were forced to leave in June and ended up living in tents and rehearsing in a local church hall. By October, they had attracted the interest of music publisher Ian Ralfini, who signed them to the American record label, Verve Records, and became the first British act they signed. Verve subsequently released the band&#x27;s debut LP, &quot;Caravan&quot; (1969), the following year, but a few months later moved out of the UK record business and dropped the band.

After a series of gigs in London, including the Speakeasy Club, the band were introduced to Terry King, who became the group&#x27;s first manager. David Hitchcock, who had been working in the art department of Decca Records, asked the company&#x27;s president, Hugh Mendl to sign the band. They began recording their second album, &quot;If I Could Do It All Over Again, I&#x27;d Do It All Over You&quot; (1970) in September 1969, while continuing to gig on the university circuit, and appearing at festivals alongside Pink Floyd, Yes, The Nice and Soft Machine. Recording &quot;If I could ...&quot; continued in February 1970, with the 14-minute track &quot;For Richard&quot;, showing the band&#x27;s contrast in styles and jazz-rock influence. The album was released in August, alongside an appearance at the Plumpton Festival with Van der Graaf Generator, Yes and Colosseum. The accompanying single &quot;Hello Hello&quot; helped them land an appearance on the TV show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, performing the album&#x27;s title track.

Caravan had started to build a live following by mid-1970, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands to an audience of 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In autumn 1970, Caravan began working on one of their most critically acclaimed albums, &quot;In the Land of Grey and Pink&quot; (1971). The balance of songwriting changed from the previous two albums, with Richard Sinclair taking a more prominent role. His song, &quot;Golf Girl&quot; was originally written about his then girlfriend (and future wife), but the lyrics were rewritten in the final version. The group decided to follow up &quot;For Richard&quot; with a suite of short sections of songs written by David Sinclair, that the rest of the band worked on and linked together to form a side-long track, &quot;Nine Feet Underground&quot;. Although, the track was recorded in five separate stages and spliced together, the band performed the suite live as it was finally presented on the album, and it remained a popular track in their live set. The album was released in April 1971, and though it did not chart, it has remained in print ever since, and has been remastered for CD several times, notably a digital remaster in 2011 by Porcupine Tree&#x27;s Steven Wilson. &quot;Nine Feet Underground&quot; in particular was a regular fixture on late-night FM radio during the early 1970s.

Despite the critical success of &quot;In the Land of Grey and Pink&quot;, the group were disappointed by its lack of commercial success, believing that Decca were not promoting the band properly or investing enough money. In August 1971, David Sinclair accepted a job with former Soft Machine drummer Robert Wyatt&#x27;s new band, Matching Mole. Reflecting on the decision to leave, Sinclair later said &quot;I felt the whole thing was going a bit stagnant ... I wanted to play with other people, but had to accept that with Caravan it was either all or nothing.&quot; Hastings remembers that &quot;Dave&#x27;s departure was a serious blow.&quot;

===Line-up changes===
The remaining members continued on together and Richard Sinclair invited keyboardist Steve Miller to join the band. However, it was immediately apparent that the style of the band would be different. Sinclair and Miller wanted to perform more jazz-rock, while Hastings was frustrated that the previous style was being neglected, and that it was &quot;virtually impossible&quot; to get Miller to perform in David Sinclair&#x27;s style. The band started recording a new album, &quot;Waterloo Lily&quot; (1972) in late 1971, which was the first use of orchestral instrumentation, arranged by Hastings and his brother, Jimmy, who had guested on previous albums. The album was released in May 1972, but by this time, musical differences had come to a head, and after a gig with Genesis in July, the band split. Richard Sinclair later said, &quot;It didn&#x27;t quite work with Steve in the band because the music started to go a bit too loose for the way that Pye and Richard Coughlan played.&quot;

Hastings and Coughlan decided to continue as Caravan, and the duo recruited viola player Geoffrey Richardson, bassist Stu Evans and keyboardist Derek Austin and toured extensively. This line-up did not release any recordings before Evans was replaced by John G. Perry and Dave Sinclair rejoined the group in 1973.

The resulting album &quot;For Girls Who Grow Plump in the Night&quot; (1973) was a major critical achievement and showed that the group could survive the loss of co-vocalist Richard Sinclair. Jimmy Hastings reprised his role as orchestrator along with Martyn Ford and John Bell, while the Soft Machine&#x27;s Mike Ratledge contributed an instrumental piece, &quot;Backwards&quot; as part of a medley. The group followed this with a live album, &quot;Caravan and the New Symphonia&quot; (1974), including orchestral arrangements by Ford and conducting by Simon Jeffes.

Perry left after the &quot;New Symphonia&quot; and was replaced by Mike Wedgwood for the album &quot;Cunning Stunts&quot; (1975), which reached the top 50 in the UK and was a minor hit in the US, reaching number 124. It was the last album released on Decca, which preceded a number of other problems in the band. David Sinclair left after the album was recorded and was replaced by Jan Schelhaas, with the band&#x27;s sound becoming more mainstream. The group signed to Miles Copeland&#x27;s BTM Records and recorded &quot;Blind Dog at St. Dunstans&quot; (1976) which was another minor album hit, but by this point the group were out of step with the prevailing musical trends, and after a final album, &quot;Better by Far&quot; (1977) on Arista Records, the group split.

===1980-2000===

In 1980 Caravan resumed recording and activity and recorded The Album with a lineup that included Dek Messecar on bass and vocals, David Sinclair, keyboards; Richard Coughlan, drums; Geoff Richardson, viola, guitars, vocals, and flute; and Pye Hastings guitar and vocals. The single taken from &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; returned the group to the charts in the UK and they had some TV appearances in France. Although this formation did not last long, since the following year the group was restructured again with the original formation and they recorded a version of &quot;Back to Front&quot; with the addition of Mel Collins on sax. 
The band were largely dormant in the 1980s until a 1990 reunion, planned as a one-off for television, reinvigorated their career. The group continued to tour in the early 1990s, before Richard Sinclair left. He was replaced by Jim Leverton, while Geoffrey Richardson rejoined the band. This version of the group released &quot;The Battle of Hastings&quot; in 1995.

===21st century===

The group continued to play into the 21st century. They have also achieved steady sales and a fan following with the support of Stuart Maconie&#x27; &quot;Freak Zone&quot; show on BBC 6 Music. After performing at NEARFest in 2002, they released &quot;The Unauthorized Breakfast Item&quot; album in 2003, where David Sinclair was replaced by a returning Jan Schelhaas. An archive collection of BBC sessions from 1968 to 1975, &quot;The Show of Our Lives&quot; was released in 2007.

In 2010, Pye Hastings announced that the band had resumed activity in anticipation of a one-off concert recording at Metropolis Studios for ITV, which took place in December 2010. New material was written for a debut performance and the band was joined by Mark Walker on drums and percussion, as Richard Coughlan, whilst still a member of the band, was too ill to tour with the group. The DVD of this gig was released in May 2011 and the recording was shown on ITV as part of the Legends series.

In January 2013, the band completed a successful UK tour to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the album &quot;For Girls Who Grow Plump in the Night&quot; (1973). This was followed later in the year by the announcement of a new album, &quot;Paradise Filter&quot; (2013). The album was funded by a PledgeMusic campaign, scheduled for release on 24 February 2014. Hastings declared &quot;now you can be part of the whole process by pledging to support this project&quot;.

On 1 December 2013, founding member Coughlan died, having been in poor health for some years. His funeral took place in Canterbury on 20 December. A statement from the band stated &quot;his unique style of playing and wonderful character will be sorely missed.&quot;

Caravan headlined the Rites of Spring festival (RoSfest) festival in Pennsylvania, USA from 2–4 May 2014.

In 2021, Jim Leverton left the band to return his R&amp;B roots. His replacement is Lee Pomeroy.

==Musical style==
Caravan are considered a key example of the Canterbury scene genre. Their records generally indicate a jazz influence, and the group&#x27;s lyrics have been described as whimsical and very &quot;English&quot;, particularly during Richard Sinclair&#x27;s tenure in the band. Following Sinclair&#x27;s departure, the musical direction has been predominantly led by Pye Hastings, who preferred a softer pop rock approach. Though the group share a common history with Soft Machine, they have been considered more melodic and closer to folk music and frequently displaying a sense of humour. The group were predominantly album-oriented, but Hastings believes the group recorded enough straightforward pop that could have been hit singles if the record company had taken sufficient interest.

Instrumentally, David Sinclair&#x27;s fuzztone Hammond organ sound is a key ingredient of the early Caravan albums, and his playing is the dominant instrument on them. His musical palette subsequently expanded to include synthesizers. Jimmy Hastings&#x27; woodwind playing and orchestral arrangements have also been a regular feature in the band&#x27;s music since its inception.

<text>Soltan Hoseyn (; 1668 – 9 September 1727) was the Safavid shah of Iran from 1694 to 1722. He was the son and successor of Shah Suleiman ().

Born and raised in the royal harem, Soltan Hoseyn ascended the throne with limited life experience and more or less no expertise in the affairs of the country. He was installed on the throne through the efforts of powerful great-aunt, Maryam Begum, as well as the court eunuchs, who wanted to increase their authority by taking advantage of a weak and impressionable ruler. Throughout his reign, Soltan Hoseyn became known for his extreme devotion, which had blended in with his superstition, impressionable personality, excessive pursuit of pleasure, debauchery, and wastefulness, all of which have been considered by both contemporary and later writers as elements that played a part in the decline of the country.

The last decade of Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s reign was marked by urban dissension, tribal uprisings, and encroachment by the country&#x27;s neighbours. The biggest threat came from the east, where the Afghans had rebelled under the leadership of the warlord Mirwais Hotak. The latter&#x27;s son and successor, Mahmud Hotak made an incursion into the country&#x27;s centre, eventually reaching the capital Isfahan in 1722, which was put under siege. A famine soon emerged in the city, which forced Soltan Hoseyn to surrender on 21 October 1722. He relinquished his regalia to Mahmud Hotak, who subsequently had him imprisoned, and became the new ruler of the city. In November, Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s third son and heir apparent, declared himself as Tahmasp II in the city of Qazvin.

Soltan Hoseyn was beheaded on 9 September 1727 under the orders of Mahmud Hotak&#x27;s successor Ashraf Hotak (), due to an insulting letter sent by the Ottoman commander-in-chief Ahmad Pasha, who claimed that he had marched into Iran in order to restore Soltan Hoseyn to the throne.

== Background ==
Soltan Hoseyn was born in 1668 in the royal harem. He was the eldest son of Shah Solayman () and a Circassian woman. He had the same upbringing as his father, being raised in the royal harem, and thus having limited life experience and more or less no expertise in the affairs of the country. At best, Soltan Hoseyn is known to have read the Quran under the guidance of Mir Mohammad-Baqer Khatunabadi. Although Soltan Hoseyn seems to have been able to speak Persian, he preferred to speak in Azeri Turkish, similar to the majority of Safavid shahs.

When Shah Solayman was on deathbed, he reportedly told his courters, that if they wanted fame for the royal family and the country, then they should choose the younger son Sultan Tahmasp (aged 23). However, if they sought peace and calmness, they should choose the elder son, Soltan Hoseyn (aged 26). The French missionary priest Père Martin Gaudereau, who was in the capital of Isfahan during this period, reports that Shah Solayman was more inclined towards Sultan Tahmasp as his successor. Nevertheless, Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s succession to the throne was secured by his powerful great-aunt, Maryam Begum, as well as the court eunuchs, who wanted to increase their authority by taking advantage of a weak and impressionable ruler.

== Enthronement ==

Due to disagreements between the palace ranks and the desire to have the enthronement take place at a well-timed moment, Soltan Hoseyn was first enthroned on 7 August 1694, a week after his father&#x27;s death (29 July). Several preparations were made before the enthronement. To assure stability amongst the populace, the whole city was stationed with troops. In order to make the shah&#x27;s soul gain tranquility, an abundance of food was made accessible, including to the poor. The merchants in the bazaar were instructed to place lights in front of their stores. On the day of the inauguration, at 4 o&#x27;clock, trumpets were blown after having been unused for fifteen days. During that night, the Royal Square (Maydan-e Shah) and the surrounding bazaars were lit with bright lights, and all types of animals were shown off in the square. However, Soltan Hoseyn was himself enthroned in the Ayena-khana palace on the southern bank of the Zayanderud, thus foreshadowing his provincialism and detachment.

Unlike his predecessors, Soltan Hoseyn rejected the custom of having the leader of the Sufis to equip him with a sword during the ceremony. Instead, he asked the &quot;shaykh al-Islam&quot; of Isfahan and leading cleric, Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi, to carry out this responsibility. Maljesi assembled a different type of gathering, where he granted Soltan Hoseyn the title of &quot;dinparvar&quot; (nurturer of the faith). When Soltan Hoseyn asked Majlesi what he wanted in return, he asked for the implementation of Sharia law. Subsequently, 6,000 bottles of wine from the royal cellars were said to have been poured out on the square in a pompous manner. A decree was declared which prohibited all types of &quot;unislamic&quot; actions, such as the manufacture and drinking of alcohol, youngsters visiting coffeehouses, and women going out without male company. Leisure activities such as pigeon-flying and playing games were also banned. This was made public in the provinces and engraved in stone friezes above mosques.

The fluid transition of power to Soltan Hoseyn demonstrates that the realm&#x27;s numerous leading factions were still working more together than clashing.

However, authority soon shifted away from Muhammad Baqer Majlesi to Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s great aunt, Maryam Begum (the daughter of Shah Safi). Under her influence, Hosein became an alcoholic and paid less and less attention to political affairs, devoting his time to his harem and his pleasure gardens.

== Major events and developments ==

=== The North ===

====Azerbaijan====
Azerbaijan, possibly the leading province concerning income and army recruitment, was in a state of chaos by 1711. During the early part of that year, a vague and violent conflict took place in Tabriz, allegedly resulting in the death of 3,000. In the ensuing years, the inhabitants of the city greatly suffered due to high prices and oppressive management. During the early part of 1719, they revolted against the city&#x27;s cruel governor, Mohammad-Ali Khan, who fled as a result. The government in Isfahan subsequently punished the inhabitants of Tabriz with a heavy fine. In 1721, Tabriz was affected by a deadly earthquake, causing the destruction of 75% of the city and the death of over 40,000 inhabitants.

====Shirvan====
In 1702, Shirvan was described by the Dutch traveler Cornelis de Bruijn as one of the key provinces of the Safavid realm, admiring it for its fertility, high agricultural yield and cheap prices. The province was then controlled by Allahverdi Khan, known for his assertive and fair rule. However, when de Bruijin returned to Shirvan in 1707, the province was in disarray due to the mismanagement of Allahverdi Khan&#x27;s son and successor, who was more interested in women and wine. de Bruijin spoke with locals who stated that they would rather live under Russian rule and would not oppose an invasion by them. In 1709, Lezghi mountaineers capitalized on the power vacuum in Shirvan by launching raids into the province.

====Russo-Persian War====

In June 1722, Peter the Great, the then tsar of the neighbouring Russian Empire, declared war on Safavid Iran in an attempt to expand Russian influence in the Caspian and Caucasus regions and to prevent its rival, Ottoman Empire, from territorial gains in the region at the expense of declining Safavid Iran.

The Russian victory ratified for Iran&#x27;s cession of their territories in the Northern, Southern Caucasus and contemporary mainland Northern Iran, comprising the cities of Derbent (southern Dagestan) and Baku and their nearby surrounding lands, as well as the provinces of Gilan, Shirvan, Mazandaran, and Astrabad to Russia per the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1723).

=== The East ===

====Balochi raids====

The most exposed part of Iran&#x27;s frontier was located in the extensive arid lands to the east. The area was populated by tribes that neither the Safavids nor the Mughals were ever successful in pacifying. In 1699, the Kerman province was overwhelmed by a Balochi invasion.

In response, Soltan Hoseyn appointed the Georgian prince Gorgin Khan (George XI) as &quot;beglerbeg&quot; (governor) of Kerman. The latter had previously served as the &quot;vali&quot; (viceroy) of Georgia, but had been dismissed in 1688 for helping rebel forces against the Safavid governor of Kakheti. Brave and strong-willed during warfare, Gorgin Khan preferred to use as the solution to any problem. With the help of his brother Shahqoli Khan (Levan), he routed the numerically superior Balochis in various encounters. In 1703, as a result of incursions by the Afghans, Soltan Hoseyn appointed Gorgin Khan as the &quot;sepahsalar&quot; (commander-in-chief) and governor of Qandahar, as well as the &quot;vali&quot; of Georgia.

==== Gorgin Khan&#x27;s governorship of Qandahar ====
At Qandahar, Gorgin Khan soon competed against Mirwais Hotak, a chief of the Hotaki clan of the Afghan Ghilzai tribe, who also served as the &quot;kalantar&quot; (mayor) of the city. An affluent man from prominent family, Mirwais was charitable towards his supporters and the poor. He had been under service of the Safavids for a long time, serving as the &quot;qafilah-salar&quot;, whose function was to patrol the caravan passage between Iran and India. However, he was dismissed as &quot;qafilah-salar&quot; in 1706, apparently due to his poor service and negligence of his responsibility in collecting fees and taxes. Meanwhile, the Afghan relations with Gorgin Khan had become uneasy due to his oppressive rule. Most sources agree that his rule started to become oppressive quickly after his assumption of power in Qandahar.

The (nominally Shi&#x27;i) Georgian soldiers of Gorgin Khan concealed goods, seized Afghan girls and women, and increased taxes. They also disregarded the religious freedom that the Sunni Afghans had been guaranteed as a condition for accepting Safavid rule. They were said to have defiled Sunni mosques by bringing pigs and wine inside, as well as taking advantage of underaged girls and 9-10 year old boys, with some of them ending up being killed, and their corpses thrown in front of their parents&#x27; homes.

The Afghans, aggrieved by this treatment, sent complaints to Isfahan, but they were seized by Gorgin Khan&#x27;s men at the court and thus never reached Soltan Hoseyn. Mirwais planned to rebel against the Georgians, but was soon arrested and brought to Isfahan under the orders of Gorgin Khan, who was suspicious of him. The latter urged Soltan Hoseyn to eliminate him, or at least prohibit him from going back to Qandahar. During his stay at Isfahan, Mirwais observed the fragility of the Iranian regime, as well as the possibility to benefit from the factional strife there. Through proficient flattery and bribery, he successfully reintegrated himself. He persuaded Soltan Hoseyn that Gorgin Khan was not trustworthy, as he planned to make his rule in Qandahar autonomous, and also planned a Russo-Georgian alliance against Iran.

====The rebellion of Mirwais ====

Mirwais was given permission to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca, where he convinced the religious authorities to declare a &quot;fatwa&quot; that gave the Afghans the right to become independent of Iranian control. In 1708, he was sent back to Qandahar as a shadow administrator, where he launched a massive rebellion. In April 1709, the Afghans made a surprise attack against Gorgin Khan and his retinue, killing them in their tents. They subsequently took control over Qandahar, and massacred its Georgian garrison. The news of these developments did not motivate the government to take action. Soltan Hoseyn instead sent two emissaries in a row to protest, but they were both jailed.

Soltan Hoseyn then responded by selecting Gorgen Khan&#x27;s nephew Khosrow Khan (Kay Khosrow) as the commander of the Afghan expedition. The latter had previously served as the &quot;darugha&quot; (prefect) of Isfahan, and following Gorgin Khan&#x27;s death became the new &quot;sepahsalar&quot; and &quot;vali&quot; of Georgia. Khosrow Khan struggled to prepare the expedition, as he was given an insufficient amount of 7,000 to pay for 3,000 soldiers. The grand vizier, as well as members of the anti-Georgian court faction, greatly hindered the release of funds for the expedition. Khosrow Khan instead found reassurance through military support by the Herat-based Afghan Abdali tribe, the adversaries of the Ghilzai.

After two years of warfare with the Ghilzai, Khosrow Khan finally besieged Qandahar with Abdali assistance. Two months, later the Ghilzai appealed for peace. However, after being demanded of total surrender to the Iranian forces, they continued fighting. In October 1711, Khosrow Khan and his exhausted soldiers were forced to withdraw, due to the summer heat, illness, shortage of supplies, and attacks by the Baluchi, who had joined the Afghans. Khosrow Khan and many of his troops were killed by the pursuing Afghan soldiers, who took their military equipment.

In late 1712, the &quot;qorchibashi&quot; (head of the mounted cavalry or royal guards) Mohammad Zaman Khan was entrusted with the task of attacking the Afghans whilst assembling an army en route. However, the lack of funds greatly hindered his expedition. Rather than using money from his own treasury, Soltan Hoseyn forced the merchants in Isfahan and New Jolfa to give a combined amount of 14,000 tomans. The expedition eventually fell apart when Zaman Khan died near Herat in the spring of 1712.

He was succeeded by Mansur Khan Shahsevan, whose expedition also ended in failure. He left Isfahan in September 1713 with fifty troops and more or less without any funds. Meanwhile, Sultan Husayn had forced his courtiers to lend him money to construct a new &quot;maydan&quot; (town square) in Farahabad. During the summer of 1713, 500 soldiers were marching towards the east, with no funds and horses and equipped with sticks. Mahd Ali Khan, who governed Farah, was unable to march towards with his 1,500 soldiers towards Mirwais due to lack of funds. Many of his soldiers had deserted and made the countryside dangerous, causing the locals more trouble than the Afghans. Meanwhile, the local militia of Marv had revolted due to the lack of pay, and a force of 8,000 Turkmens were marching towards Mashhad.

====The Afghan capture of Isfahan====

Following the death of Mirwais in 1715, the Iranians failed in their efforts to appease the Afghans through compromises, as Mirwais&#x27;s son and later successor Mahmud Hotak () swore to get his revenge against the Iranians. The Afghans advanced into the heartland of Iran in 1720, conquering Kerman. Six months later, they chose to withdraw, but came back the next year, causing chaos in the southeast and eastern part of the country. Nevertheless, Soltan Hosayn continued to use the majority of his time and funds on construction projects. Mahmud and his army swept westward aiming at the shah&#x27;s capital of Isfahan itself. Rather than biding his time within the city and resisting a siege in which the small Afghan army was unlikely to succeed, Soltan Hoseyn marched out to meet Mahmud&#x27;s force at Golnabad. Here, on 8 March, the royal army was thoroughly routed and fled back to Isfahan in disarray.

The shah was urged to escape to the provinces to raise more troops but he decided to remain in the capital which was now encircled by the Afghans. Mahmud&#x27;s siege of Isfahan lasted from March to October, 1722. Lacking artillery, he was forced to resort to a long blockade in the hope of starving the Iranians into submission. Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s command during the siege displayed his customary lack of decisiveness and the loyalty of his provincial governors wavered in the face of such incompetence. Protests against his rule also broke out within Isfahan and the shah&#x27;s son, Tahmasp, was eventually elevated to the role of co-ruler. In June, Tahmasp managed to escape from the city in a bid to raise a relief force in the provinces, but little came of this plan. Starvation and disease finally forced Isfahan into submission. It is believed that over 80,000 of the inhabitants of the city died during the siege. On 23 October, Soltan Hoseyn abdicated and acknowledged Mahmud as the new shah of Iran.

===Captivity and death===
Mahmud initially treated Soltan Hoseyn considerately, but as he gradually became mentally unbalanced he began to view the former shah with suspicion. In February 1725, believing a rumour that one of Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s sons, Safi Mirza, had escaped, Mahmud ordered the execution of all the other Safavid princes who were in his hands, with the exception of Soltan Hoseyn himself. When Soltan Hoseyn tried to stop the massacre, he was wounded, but his action saved the lives of two of his young children. Mahmud succumbed to insanity and died on 25 April of the same year.

Mahmud&#x27;s successor Ashraf Khan at first treated the deposed shah with sympathy. In return, Soltan Hoseyn gave him the hand of one of his daughters in marriage, a move which would have increased Ashraf&#x27;s legitimacy in the eyes of his Iranian subjects. However, Ashraf was involved in a war with the Ottoman Empire, which contested his claim to the Iranian throne. In the autumn of 1726, the Ottoman governor of Baghdad, Ahmad Pasha, advanced with his army on Isfahan, sending an insulting message to Ashraf saying that he was coming to restore the legitimate shah to the throne. In response, Ashraf had Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s head cut off and sent it to the Ottoman with the message that &quot;he expected to give Ahmad Pasha a fuller reply with the points of his sword and his lance&quot;. As the Iranologist Michael Axworthy comments, &quot;In this way Shah Soltan Hoseyn gave in death a sharper answer than he ever gave in life&quot;.

== Religious policy ==

Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s religiosity is implied through the numerous &quot;awqaf&quot; (charitable endowment under Islamic law) he gifted. He may not have been as intolerant as he commonly is described, as implied by his trust in the Sunni grand vizier Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani, his interest when visiting to the churches of New Jolfa, as well as the numerous decrees (&quot;farman&quot;) he declared, which protected the Christian population of Iran and allowed missionaries to perform their work. Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s reign marked an improvement over his father&#x27;s regarding the status of European missionaries.

The clerics, who held influence over Soltan Hoseyn, were permitted to pursue their dogmatic plans, such as their anti-Sufi policies and taking action against non-Shi&#x27;ites. These actions included the forced conversion of Zoroastrians, turning their temple in Isfahan into a mosque, exacting jizya (poll tax) from Jews and Christians, and making it illegal for non-Shi&#x27;ites to go outside during rain for fear that they might pollute Shi&#x27;ites. In most cases these laws were avoided through bribery, or in other occasions through other means, such as when Maryam Begum interceded on the behalf of the Armenians of New Jolfa.

Nevertheless, the progressively intolerant environment caused by these measures decreased the loyalty of the non-Shi&#x27;ites towards the Safavid government. Due to increased taxes and endangerment by a law that permitted the family member of an apostate to gain their belongings, several wealthy Armenians withdrew much of their financial assets and left for the Italian cities of Venice and Rome. The anti-Sunni policies pursued by the government had the most substantial consequences, as it alienated the many Sunnis of the country, most of whom inhabited its frontiers.

Soltan Hoseyn also had the &quot;tawhid-khana&quot; (Sufi assemblies) closed.

== Foreign Policy ==
While less involved with the outside world than his predecessors, Soltan Hoseyn was more engaged in foreign policy than that of his father. He continued the latter&#x27;s policy of preserving peaceful relations with the Ottoman Empire.

== Government ==

During the reign of Soltan Hoseyn, the structure of the government remained unchanged, continuing the same multi-constitutional foundations (Turk, Tajik, &quot;gholam&quot;) that had existed earlier. Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s first grand vizier was the Tajik sayyid Mohammad Taher Vahid Qazvini, who had held the office since 1691, during the reign of Shah Soleyman. Mohammad Taher Vahid, as well to a lesser degree the court steward (&quot;nazer&quot;) Najafqoli Khan, were the main counselors of Soltan Hoseyn during his early reign. In May 1699, Soltan Hoseyn dismissed Mohammad Taher Vahid, supposedly due to the latter&#x27;s old age. He replaced him with the &quot;eshik-aqasi-bashi&quot; Mohammad Mo&#x27;men Khan Shamlu, who, however, was also advanced in age.

He was in turn replaced in 1707 by Shahqoli Khan Zanganeh, son of the Sunni Kurd Shaykh Ali Khan Zanganeh, who had also previously served as grand vizier. He was succeeded in 1715 by the Sunni Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani, whom Soltan Hoseyn left most of the state affairs to. The French consul Ange Garde considered Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani to be the &quot;absolute ruler of the realm, who takes care of everything while the king has not the slightest knowledge of what goes on in the country.&quot; He was succeeded in 1720 by Mohammad Mo&#x27;men Khan Shamlu&#x27;s son Mohammad Qoli Khan Shamlu, who remained grand vizier until the fall of Isfahan.

The high clerics were notably favoured and regarded by Soltan Hoseyn, particularly Maljesi, whom he often consulted and entrusted to write texts about religious subjects. Following Majlesi&#x27;s death in 1669, Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s former tutor Khatunabadi succeeded him in that regard. The latter was given the most powerful religious office of the country, the &quot;mullabashi&quot;, an office first created by Soltan Hoseyn. The courts eunuchs also uninterruptedly increased their influence, such as in 1696, when the head of the black eunuchs, Agha Kamal, was the most praised subject of Soltan Hoseyn. By 1714, it was the eunuchs who decided who was promoted, appointed or discharged. During Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s late reign, the most prominent influence was exercised by Maryam Begum.

There were many who held the post of &quot;sepahsalar&quot; under Soltan Hoseyn, primarily members of the Shamlu and the Zanganeh tribes. The post of &quot;qorchibashi&quot; (head of the mounted cavalry or royal guards) continued to be held by tribal groups, also primarily the Shamlu and Zanganeh. The post of &quot;qollar-aghasi&quot; (chief of the &quot;gholams&quot;) was held by officers of tribal and Georgian &quot;gholam&quot; origin. The post of &quot;sadr&quot; continued to be held by Tajik sayyids. The provincial bureaucracy mainly imitated that of the central bureaucracy, and was thus controlled by members of leading local Tajik families, often of sayyid origin.

Due to the indecisiveness of Soltan Hoseyn the Royal Council gathered frequently to discuss important and state problems, but typically no meaningful choices were made. Rather than taking responsibility and addressing the internal and foreign dangers to the safety of the state and its population, the various groups within the Royal Council instead attempted to compete with each other. Threats were once made during a Royal Council meeting as a result of the hostility between the Royal Council members. Previously, similar situations would have resulted in the execution of councilors, but during this period it only caused damage to their self-image.

== Personality ==

Throughout his reign, Soltan Hoseyn became known for his extreme devotion, which had blended in with his superstition, impressionable personality, excessive pursuit of pleasure, debauchery, and wastefulness, all of which have been considered by both contemporary and later writers as elements that played a part in the decline of the country. Because of his piety, he received the nicknames &quot;Darvish&quot;, &quot;Molla&quot; and &quot;Molla Husayn,&quot; and became known as a monarch whose doings were only in line with the Sharia law. Soltan Hoseyn demonstrated his devotion by depriving alcohol and female dancers from royal ceremonies. However, a few months after his enthronement, he started drinking, reportedly under the influence of Maryam Begum, who also drank. Despite his religiosity, Soltan Hoseyn kept the openly Sunni Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani as his grand vizier for five years.

The meek aspect of Soltan Hoseyn is reported by all eyewitnesses, who displayed it as either benevolence and rightfulness, or as an absence of determination, which played a part in the collapse of the Safavid kingdom. Judasz Tadeusz Krusinski considers Soltan Hoseyn to have been &quot;less able and resolute than his father&quot; and &quot;good-natured and human&quot; who &quot;hurt no particular person and by that means hurt all mankind.&quot; When asked to make a choice, Soltan Hoseyn usually supported the suggestion made by the last person he spoke to, often with the words &quot;yakhshi dir&quot; (&quot;It is good&quot; in Turkic). He was said to have used that phrase so much that the eunuchs and courtiers nicknamed him after it in secret. The Iranologist Rudi Matthee considers Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s use of the phrase a demonstration of his naivety.

Like Krusinski, Abd al-Hoseyn Khatunabadi also portrays Soltan Hoseyn as kind and against spilling blood. Contrary to the previous Safavid shahs, Soltan Hoseyn did not harm any of his opponents or family members, and was also unable to do the same to animals. While previous Safavid shahs had used death as a type of punishment, Soltan Hoseyn used relinquishment of wealth and financial fines as the highest punishment. According to John Malcolm, writing in 1815, Soltan Hoseyn did not possess the bloodshed and brutality of his father, but that his &quot;bigotry proved more destructive to the country than the vices of Soleyman.&quot; Soltan Hoseyn&#x27;s kind personality was considered by many of his subjects as a proof of his weakness.

== Building projects ==
In Isfahan, Soltan Hoseyn ordered the construction of Chaharbagh School, the largest building to be created since the reign of Shah Abbas I (). It was located to the east of Chaharbagh avenue.

== Coinage ==

Under Soltan Hoseyn, the minting of gold coins was reinstituted. When he lacked the funds to continue the taxing and fruitless military expeditions against the Afghans, he started to have gold &quot;ashrafi&quot; currency minted in 1717. The number of coin mints during the reign of Soltan Hoseyn heavily decreased. The weight of the &quot;abbasi&quot; currency was reduced a few times, from 7.39g (between 1694 and 1711) to 6.91g (between 1711 and 1717), and then to 5.34g (1717–1722). Its weight reached its lowest during the Afghan siege of Isfahan, weighing 4.61g.

<text>Markus Guenther Kuhn (born 1971) is a German computer scientist, currently working at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge and a fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge.

==Education==
Kuhn was educated at University of Erlangen (Germany), he received his Master of Science degree at Purdue University and PhD at the University of Cambridge.

==Research==
Kuhn&#x27;s main research interests include computer security, in particular the hardware and signal-processing aspects of it, and distributed systems. He is known, among other things, for his work on security microcontrollers, compromising emanations, and distance-bounding protocols. He developed the Stirmark test for digital watermarking schemes, the OTPW one-time password system, and headed the project that extended the X11 misc-fixed fonts to Unicode.

In 1994, as an undergraduate student, he became known for developing several ways to circumvent the VideoCrypt encryption system, most notably the &quot;Season7&quot; smartcard emulator.

In 2002, he published a new method for eavesdropping CRT screens and in 2003 he went on to publish mitigations such as &quot;Tempest fonts&quot;.

In 2010, Kuhn was asked to analyse the ADE 651, a device used in Iraq that was said to be a bomb-detecting device; he found that it contained nothing but an anti-theft tag and said that it was &quot;impossible&quot; that the device could detect anything whatsoever.

He is also known for some of his work on international standardisation, such as pioneering the introduction of Unicode/UTF-8 under Linux.

==Awards and honours==
In 1987 and 1988, he won the German national computer-science contest, and in 1989, he won a gold medal for the West German team at the International Olympiad in Informatics.

<doc id="1082706" wikidata="Q366051" url="?curid=1082706" title="Charles Adolphe Wurtz">
<text>Charles Adolphe Wurtz (; 26 November 181710 May 1884) was an Alsatian French chemist. He is best remembered for his decades-long advocacy for the atomic theory and for ideas about the structures of chemical compounds, against the skeptical opinions of chemists such as Marcellin Berthelot and Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville. He is well known by organic chemists for the Wurtz reaction, to form carbon-carbon bonds by reacting alkyl halides with sodium, and for his discoveries of ethylamine, ethylene glycol, and the aldol reaction. Wurtz was also an influential writer and educator.

==Life==

Adolphe Wurtz (he never used the name &quot;Charles&quot;) was born in Strasbourg, where his father, Johann Jacob (Jean Jacques) Wurtz, was a Lutheran pastor in the nearby town of Wolfisheim. His wife, Adolphe&#x27;s mother, Sophie Kreiss, died in 1878.

When he left the Protestant gymnasium at Strasbourg in 1834, his father allowed him to study medicine as next best to theology. He devoted himself specially to the chemical side of his profession with such success that in 1839 he was appointed at the Strasbourg faculty of medicine. For the summer semester of 1842 he studied under Justus von Liebig at the University of Giessen. After graduating from Strasbourg as M.D. in 1843, with a thesis on albumin and fibrin, he went to Paris, where he first was referred by Jean Baptiste Dumas to Antoine Balard. His employment with Balard lasted a few months, after which Wurtz began work in Dumas&#x27;s private laboratory. In 1845, he became assistant to Dumas at the École de Médecine, and four years later began to give lectures on organic chemistry in his place.

As there was no laboratory at his disposal at the Ecole de Médecine, he opened a private one in 1850 in the Rue Garanciere; but three years later the building was sold, and the laboratory had to be abandoned. In 1850, he received the professorship of chemistry at the new Institut National Agronomique at Versailles, but the Institut was abolished in 1852. In the following year the chair of &quot;pharmacy and organic chemistry&quot; at the faculty of medicine became vacant by the resignation of Dumas, and the chair of &quot;medical chemistry&quot; by the death of Mathieu Orfila. Both of these chairs were now abolished, and Wurtz was appointed to the newly defined post of &quot;organic and mineral chemistry&quot;. (At the same time, a new chair devoted exclusively to pharmacy was awarded to Eugene Soubeiran). In 1866, Wurtz undertook the duties of dean of the faculty of medicine. In this position, he exerted himself to secure the rearrangement and reconstruction of the buildings devoted to scientific instruction, urging that in the provision of properly equipped teaching laboratories France was much behind Germany (see his report &quot;Les Hautes Etudes pratiques dans les universités allemandes&quot;, 1870).

In 1875, resigning the office of dean but retaining the title of honorary dean, he became the first occupant of a new chair of organic chemistry at the Sorbonne, which the government had established due to his influence. However, he had great difficulty in obtaining an adequate laboratory. The buildings of the new Sorbonne that ultimately provided modern scientific laboratories were not completed until 1894, ten years after his death.

Wurtz was an honorary member of almost every scientific society in Europe. He was the principal founder of the Paris Chemical Society (1858), was its first secretary and thrice served as its president. In 1880, he was vice-president and in 1881 president of the French Academy of Sciences, which he entered in 1867 in succession to Théophile-Jules Pelouze. In 1881, Wurtz was elected life senator. Wurtz&#x27;s name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel tower.

Wurtz died in Paris on 10 May 1884, probably of complications due to diabetes, and was buried in the north-east of the city at Père Lachaise Cemetery. 

==Scientific and academic work==
Influenced by such leading figures as Liebig and Dumas, by 1856 Wurtz became a powerful advocate of a reform in chemical theory then being led by Charles Gerhardt and Alexander Williamson. This new chemistry of the 1850s took the idea of chemical atoms seriously, adopted atomic weights for the elements that strongly resemble the modern ones, and proposed a unitary schematic plan that opposed the dualistic theory derived from the work of Jons Jacob Berzelius. Soon thereafter, Wurtz also adopted the new structural theory that was developing from the work of younger chemists such as August Kekulé. However, a kind of skeptical positivism was influential in France during the second half of the nineteenth century, and Wurtz&#x27;s efforts to gain a favorable hearing for atomism and structuralism in his homeland were largely frustrated.

Wurtz&#x27;s first published paper was on hypophosphorous acid (1841), and the continuation of his work on the acids of phosphorus (1845) resulted in the discovery of sulfophosphoric acid and phosphorus oxychloride, as well as of copper hydride. But his original work was mainly in the domain of organic chemistry. Investigation of the cyanic ethers (1848) yielded a class of substances which opened out a new field in organic chemistry, for, by treating those ethers with caustic potash, he obtained methylamine, the simplest organic derivative of ammonia (1849), and later (1851) the compound ureas. In 1855, reviewing the various substances that had been obtained from glycerin, he reached the conclusion that glycerin is a body of alcoholic nature formed on the type of three molecules of water, as common alcohol is on that of one, and was thus led (1856) to the discovery of the glycols or diatomic alcohols, bodies similarly related to the double water type. This discovery he worked out very thoroughly in investigations of ethylene oxide and the polyethylene alcohols. The oxidation of the glycols led him to homologues of lactic acid, and a controversy about the constitution of the latter with Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe resulted in the discovery of many new facts and in a better understanding of the relations between the oxy- and the amido-acids. In 1855, he published work on what is now known as the Wurtz reaction.

In 1867 Wurtz synthesized neurine by the action of trimethylamine on glycol-chlorhydrin. In 1872 he discovered the aldol reaction and characterized the product as showing the properties of both an alcohol and an aldehyde. Alexander Borodin discovered the reaction independently in the same year. The product was named an aldol, pointing out its double character. This led to a second confrontation with Kolbe.

In addition to this list of some of the new substances he prepared, reference may be made to his work on abnormal vapor densities. While working on the olefins he noticed that a change takes place in the density of the vapor of amylene hydrochloride, hydrobromide, &amp;c, as the temperature is increased, and in the gradual passage from a gas of approximately normal density to one of half-normal density he saw a powerful argument in favor of the view that abnormal vapor densities, such as are exhibited by sal-ammoniac or phosphorus pentachloride. are to be explained by dissociation. From 1865 onwards he treated this question in several papers, and in particular maintained the dissociation of vapor of chloral hydrate, in opposition to Etienne Henri Sainte-Claire Deville and Marcellin Berthelot.

For twenty-one years (1852–1872) Wurtz published in the &quot;Annales de chimie et de physique&quot; abstracts of chemical work done out of France. The publication of his great &quot;Dictionnaire de chimie pure et appliquée&quot;, in which he was assisted by many other French chemists, was begun in 1869 and finished in 1878; two supplementary volumes were issued 1880–1886, and in 1892 the publication of a second supplement was begun. Among his books are &quot;Chimie médicale&quot; (1864), &quot;Leçons élémentaires de chimie moderne&quot; (1867), &quot;Théorie des atomes dans la conception générale du monde&quot; (1874), &quot;La Théorie atomique&quot; (1878), &quot;Progrés de l&#x27;industrie des matières colorantes artificielles&quot; (1876) and &quot;Traité de chimie biologique&quot; (1880–1885). His &quot;Histoire des doctrines chimiques&quot;, the introductory discourse to his &quot;Dictionnaire&quot; (also published separately in 1869), opens with the phrase, . Although it raised a storm of protest in Germany, the sentence is less nationalistic than it appears; he intended to refer only to the birth of chemistry under the great Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, rather than asserting exclusive French national ownership of the science.

<text>Anthony Joseph Accardo (; born Antonino Leonardo Accardo, ; April 28, 1906 – May 22, 1992), also known as &quot;Joe Batters&quot; and &quot;Big Tuna&quot;, was an American longtime mobster. In a criminal career that spanned eight decades, he rose from small-time hoodlum to the position of day-to-day boss of the Chicago Outfit in 1947, to ultimately becoming the power behind the throne in the Outfit by 1972. Accardo moved the Outfit into new operations and territories, significantly increasing its power and wealth during his tenure as boss.

==Early life==
Accardo was born on April 28, 1906, in Chicago&#x27;s Near West Side, the second of six children of shoemaker Francesco Accardo and Maria Tilotta Accardo. One year before his birth, the Accardos had emigrated from Castelvetrano, in the Province of Trapani, Sicily, Italy to the United States. At age 14, Accardo left school and started loitering around neighborhood pool halls. He soon joined the Circus Cafe Gang, run by Claude Maddox and Tony Capezio, one of many street gangs in the poor neighborhoods of Chicago. These gangs served as talent pools (similar to the concept of farm teams) for the city&#x27;s adult criminal organizations. Jack &quot;Machine Gun&quot; McGurn, one of the toughest hitmen of Chicago Outfit boss Al Capone, recruited Accardo into his crew, along with long time associate Tony Mazlack of Gary, Indiana.

==Career==
===Capone regime===
During Prohibition, Accardo got the nickname &quot;Joe Batters&quot; after using a baseball bat to murder three mobsters who had betrayed the Outfit. Capone was allegedly quoted as saying, &quot;Boy, this kid&#x27;s a real Joe Batters&quot;. In 1939, Chicago newspapers dubbed Accardo &quot;The Big Tuna&quot;, after a fishing expedition to Wedgeport, Nova Scotia, Canada where Accardo caught a giant 400 pound tuna and was famously photographed with his catch. In later years, Accardo boasted over federal wiretaps that he participated in the infamous 1929 St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre in which, allegedly, Capone gunmen murdered seven members of rival Bugs Moran&#x27;s North Side Gang. Accardo also claimed that he was one of the gunmen who murdered Brooklyn gang boss Frankie Yale, again by Capone&#x27;s orders to settle a dispute. However, most experts believe Accardo had only peripheral connections, if any, with the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre and none whatsoever with the Yale murder, which was most likely committed by Gus Winkler, Fred Burke, and Louis Campagna. However, on October 11, 1926, Accardo may have participated in the assassination of Northside gang leader Hymie Weiss near the Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago.

In 1932, Capone was convicted of tax evasion and sent to prison for an 11-year sentence, and Frank &quot;The Enforcer&quot; Nitti became the new Outfit boss after serving his own 18-month sentence for tax evasion. By this time, Accardo had established a solid record of making money for the organization, so Nitti let him establish his own crew. He was also named as the Outfit&#x27;s head of enforcement. Accardo soon developed a variety of profitable rackets, including gambling, loansharking, bookmaking, extortion, and the distribution of untaxed alcohol and cigarettes. As with all &quot;caporegimes&quot;, Accardo received 5% of the crew&#x27;s earnings as a so-called &quot;street tax&quot;. Accardo, in turn, paid a tax to the Outfit&#x27;s boss. If a crew member refused to pay a street tax (or paid less than half of the amount owed), they would be killed. Accardo&#x27;s crew included future Outfit heavyweights Gus &quot;Gussie&quot; Alex and Joseph &quot;Joey Doves&quot; Aiuppa.

===Chicago boss===
In the 1940s, Accardo continued to gain power in the Outfit. As the decade progressed, senior members of the Outfit were investigated and charged with using the threat of strike action by the labor unions they controlled to extort millions of dollars from Hollywood studios. Nitti, who was claustrophobic and fearful of serving a second prison term, committed suicide in 1943. Paul &quot;The Waiter&quot; Ricca, who had been the &quot;de facto&quot; boss since Capone&#x27;s imprisonment, took the role officially and named Accardo as underboss. Ricca and Accardo ran the Outfit for 30 years until Ricca died in 1972. When Ricca subsequently received a 10-year prison sentence for his part in the Hollywood scandal, Accardo became acting boss. Three years later, when Ricca was barred from contact with mobsters as a condition for his parole, Accardo became boss of the Outfit; in practice, he shared power with Ricca, who remained in the background as a senior consultant.

Under Accardo&#x27;s leadership in the late 1940s, the Outfit moved into slot and vending machines, counterfeiting cigarette and liquor tax stamps, and expanding narcotics smuggling. Accardo placed slot machines in gas stations, restaurants, and bars throughout the Outfit&#x27;s territory. Outside of Chicago, the Outfit expanded into Las Vegas and took influence over gaming away from the Five Families of New York City. Accardo ensured all the legal Las Vegas casinos used his slot machines. In Kansas and Oklahoma, he took advantage of the official ban on alcohol sales to introduce bootlegged alcohol. The Outfit eventually dominated organized crime in most of the western United States. Accardo phased out some traditional activities, such as labor racketeering and extortion, to reduce the Outfit&#x27;s exposure to legal prosecution. He also converted the Outfit&#x27;s brothel business into call girl services. These changes resulted in a golden era of profitability and influence for the Outfit.

Accardo and Ricca emphasized keeping a low profile and let flashier figures, such as Sam Giancana, attract attention instead. For example, when professional wrestlers Lou Albano and Tony Altomare, wrestling as a Mafia-inspired tag team called &quot;The Sicilians&quot;, came to Chicago in 1961, Accardo persuaded the men to drop the gimmick to avoid any mob-related publicity. By using tactics such as these, Accardo and Ricca were able to run the Outfit much longer than Capone. Ricca once said, &quot;Accardo had more brains for breakfast than Capone had in a lifetime&quot;.

===Change of leadership===
After 1957, Accardo turned over the official position as boss to Giancana because of &quot;heat&quot; from the IRS. Accardo then became the Outfit&#x27;s &quot;consigliere&quot;, stepping away from the day-to-day running of the organization, but he still retained considerable power and demanded ultimate respect. Giancana still had to obtain the sanction of Accardo and Ricca on major business, including murders.

However, this working relationship eventually broke down. Unlike Accardo, the widowed Giancana lived an ostentatious lifestyle, frequenting posh nightclubs and dating high-profile singer Phyllis McGuire. Giancana also refused to distribute some of the lavish profits from Outfit casinos in Iran and Central America to the members. Many in the Outfit also felt that Giancana was attracting too much attention from the FBI, which was forever tailing his car around the Chicago metropolitan area. Around 1966, after Giancana began a year in jail on federal contempt of court charges, Accardo and Ricca replaced him with Aiuppa. In June 1975, after spending most of his Outfit-exile years in Mexico and unceremoniously being booted from that country, Giancana was murdered in the basement apartment of his home, in Oak Park, Illinois, while cooking Italian sausages and escarole.

Ricca died in 1972, leaving Accardo as the ultimate authority in the Outfit.

===The burglary===
In 1978, while Accardo vacationed in California, burglars entered his River Forest home.

Shortly afterward, the three suspected thieves and four related persons were found strangled and with their throats cut. Law enforcement officials believed Accardo had ordered the killings in retaliation for the burglary. In 2002, this theory was confirmed on the witness stand by Outfit mobster turned informer Nicholas Calabrese, who had participated in all of the murders. The surviving assassins were all convicted in the Family Secrets trial, and sentenced to long prison terms.

==Personal life==
In 1934, Accardo met Clarice Pordzany, a Polish-American chorus girl. They later married and had two daughters, and adopted two sons.

Several of Accardo&#x27;s family members have had careers in the National Football League. His daughter Marie married Palmer Pyle, who played guard for the Baltimore Colts, Minnesota Vikings, and Oakland Raiders. Their son Eric Kumerow played linebacker for the Miami Dolphins, and Eric&#x27;s son Jake was a wide receiver for five teams, most notably the Buffalo Bills. Eric&#x27;s sister, Cheryl, married John Bosa, who played defensive end for the Dolphins. They had two sons, Joey and Nick; Joey plays as a linebacker for the Los Angeles Chargers, and Nick as a defensive end for the San Francisco 49ers.

For most of his married life, Accardo lived in River Forest, Illinois. The six-bedroom, six-bath home he owned on Franklin Avenue in River Forest contained two bowling lanes, an indoor swimming pool, and a pipe organ. When he started receiving attention from the IRS about his apparent high lifestyle, he bought a ranch home on the 1400 block of North Ashland Avenue in River Forest and installed a vault. His neighbor and friend physician Jim Carto lived across the street off Ashland Ave in the Mars Candy Mansion, and was rumored to have assisted in providing medical care. Due to their similar-sounding last names, Carto was often confused with Accardo and became respected as a member of the Accardo family. Carto and his wife Rose (née Kolanko), a nurse, and Leon Kolanko, Rose&#x27;s brother, were rumored to be Accardo&#x27;s personal physicians, who may have helped assist in medical care &quot;off the books.&quot; Accardo&#x27;s official job was as a beer salesman for a Chicago brewery.

==Death and burial==
In the late 1970s, Accardo bought a home in Palm Springs, California, flying to Chicago to preside over Outfit &quot;sit-downs&quot; and mediate disputes. By this time, his personal holdings included legal investments in commercial office buildings, retail centers, lumber farms, paper factories, hotels, car dealerships, trucking companies, newspaper companies, restaurants and travel agencies.

Accardo spent his last years in Barrington Hills, Illinois living with his daughter and son-in-law. On May 22, 1992, Anthony Accardo died of respiratory and heart conditions at age 86. Accardo is buried in a crypt in the mausoleum at Queen of Heaven Cemetery, in Hillside, Illinois. Despite an arrest record dating back to 1922, Accardo spent at most only one night in jail.

<text>Sonic X-treme was a platform game developed by Sega Technical Institute from 1994 until its cancellation in 1996. It was planned as the first fully 3D &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; game, taking Sonic into the 3D era of video games, and the first original &quot;Sonic&quot; game for the Sega Saturn. The storyline followed Sonic on his journey to stop Dr. Robotnik from stealing six magic rings from Tiara Boobowski and her father. &quot;X-treme&quot; featured open levels rotating around a fixed center of gravity and, like previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games, featured collectible rings and fast-paced gameplay.

&quot;X-treme&quot; was conceived as a side-scrolling platform game for the Sega Genesis to succeed &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; (1994). Development shifted to the 32X and then the Saturn and Windows, and the game was redesigned as a 3D platform game for the 1996 holiday season. The plan was disrupted by company politics, an unfavorable visit by Japanese Sega executives, and obstacles with the game engines planned for use, including one from Sonic Team for &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; (1996). Amid increasing pressure and declining morale, designer Chris Senn and programmer Chris Coffin became ill, prompting producer Mike Wallis to cancel the game. A film tie-in with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was also canceled.

In place of &quot;X-treme&quot;, Sega released a port of the Genesis game &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;, but did not release an original 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; platform game until &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; for the Dreamcast in 1998. The cancellation is considered an important factor in the Saturn&#x27;s commercial failure, as it left the system with no original &quot;Sonic&quot; platform game. Elements similar to those in &quot;X-treme&quot; appeared in later games, such as &quot;Sonic Lost World&quot; (2013).

== Premise ==

&quot;Sonic X-treme&quot; was a platform game in which players controlled Sonic the Hedgehog from a third-person perspective. It would have been the first &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; game to feature 3D gameplay, predating &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; (1998). Gameplay was similar to the Sega Saturn platform game &quot;Bug!&quot; (1995), though producer Mike Wallis said that &quot;X-treme&quot; differed in that Sonic was free to roam levels, unconstrained by linear paths.

&quot;X-treme&quot; featured a fisheye camera system, the &quot;Reflex Lens&quot;, that gave players a wide-angle view, making levels appear to move around Sonic. Levels would rotate around a fixed center of gravity, meaning Sonic could run up walls, arriving at what was previously the ceiling. Sonic was also able to enter and exit the screen as he moved. Boss battles were set in open, arena-style levels, and the bosses were rendered in polygons instead of sprites. These levels used shading, transparency, and lighting effects to showcase the Saturn&#x27;s technical potential.

The developers wanted to take &quot;Sonic&quot; into the 3D era while building on its successes. In 1996, Wallis said &quot;X-treme&quot; featured familiar &quot;Sonic&quot; gameplay, but &quot;[w]e&#x27;re giving Sonic new moves, because Sonic is a hedgehog of the times, we&#x27;re bringing him up to speed.&quot; Like previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games, &quot;X-treme&quot; emphasized speed and physics, and featured special stages and collectable rings. Additions included the abilities to throw rings at enemies, create a shield from rings, do spinning midair attacks, strike enemies below with a &quot;Power Ball&quot; attack, jump higher with less control than normal, and execute a &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; attack, in concert with the shield, that struck in 360 degrees. Surfing and bungee jumping were included as activities considered cool at the time.

Former executive producer Michael Kosaka&#x27;s design documents envisioned six zones with three levels each. At least four stages were developed before cancellation: Jade Gully, Red Sands, Galaxy Fortress, and Crystal Frost. Lead designer Chris Senn said he modeled and textured four main characters and created designs for 50 enemies and an hour of music. Fang the Sniper and Metal Sonic were planned as bosses. The plot went through several iterations; the one described in promotional materials involved Tiara Boobowski, who was set to become a major character, and her father, Professor Gazebo Boobowski, calling on Sonic to help defend the six magical Rings of Order from Dr. Robotnik.

==Background==
The original &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; was developed by Sonic Team in Japan. Released in 1991, it greatly increased the popularity of the Sega Genesis in North America. After its release, developer Yuji Naka and other Japanese staff relocated to California to join Sega Technical Institute (STI), a development division led by Mark Cerny. Cerny aimed to establish an elite development studio combining the design philosophies of American and Japanese developers.

In 1991, STI began developing several games, including &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; (1992), which was released the following year. Though &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; was successful, the language barrier and cultural differences created a rift between the Japanese and American developers. Once development ended, Cerny departed STI and was replaced by former Atari employee Roger Hector. The American staff developed &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; (1993), while the Japanese staff developed &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (1994) and &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; (1994). According to developer Takashi Iizuka, the Japanese team experimented with 3D computer graphics for &quot;Sonic 3&quot;, but were unable to implement them with the limited power of the Genesis. After &quot;Sonic &amp; Knuckles&quot; was completed, Naka returned to Japan to work on &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; (1996) with Sonic Team.

At the time, Sega of America operated as an independent entity, and relations with the Japanese were not always smooth. Some of this conflict may have been caused by Sega president Hayao Nakayama and his admiration for Sega of America; according to former Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske, some executives disliked that Nakayama appeared to favor US executives, and &quot;a lot of the Japanese executives were maybe a little jealous, and I think some of that played into the decisions that were made&quot;. By contrast, author Steven L. Kent opined that Nakayama bullied American executives and believed the Japanese executives made the best decisions. According to Hector, after the release of the Sony PlayStation in 1994, the atmosphere at Sega became political, with &quot;lots of finger-pointing&quot;.

==Development==
After Naka&#x27;s return to Japan with his team in late 1994, STI was left with mostly American staff. Early ideas for the next &quot;Sonic&quot; game included the experimental &quot;Sonic Crackers&quot;, which became the 32X game &quot;Knuckles&#x27; Chaotix&quot; (1995). Another concept came from STI head Roger Hector, who wanted to develop a game based on the Saturday morning &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; cartoon, and took Sonic Team and STI developers to DiC Animation&#x27;s studios in Burbank, California after the release of &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; to demonstrate his idea. STI developer Peter Morawiec designed gameplay from this concept as a side-scrolling video game with more focus on story than previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games. He called the pitch &quot;Sonic-16&quot;, intended for release on the Genesis. However, Sega management was not interested in a spin-off and felt the idea was too slow for Sonic. Instead, Morawiec moved on to work on &quot;Comix Zone&quot; (1995).

Development of &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot; began in late 1994 at STI. Michael Kosaka was executive producer and team leader, and designer and CGI artist Senn created animations to pitch the game to Sega executives. As new consoles and the 32-bit era were on the way, the game was moved to the 32X under the working titles &quot;Sonic 32X&quot; and &quot;Sonic Mars&quot; after the &quot;Project Mars&quot; codename used for the 32X. The initial 32X design was an isometric side-scroller, but became a full 3D game with a view set on a floating plane. Kosaka completed design documents before the 32X was released, without a clear picture of the hardware. Some of Kosaka&#x27;s concepts were new dynamics to the gameplay, including the ability for a second player to play as a character other than Tails. Various playable characters, including some from the cartoon, would be unlocked as they were rescued and have unique moves. Players could also collect Chaos Emeralds via special stages that involved playing a minigame similar to air hockey against Dr. Robotnik, and collecting all seven would unlock the true ending.

In mid-1995, Kosaka resigned. According to Senn, &quot;[Kosaka] and the executive producer Dean Lester were not getting along, and I believe Michael felt it was his best option to simply remove himself from what he thought was a politically unhealthy environment.&quot; Lester resigned later in 1995 and was replaced by Manny Granillo. Wallis, who had worked on &quot;The Ooze&quot; (1995) and &quot;Comix Zone&quot;, was placed in charge of &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;. Lead programmer Don Goddard was replaced with Ofer Alon, who some staff found difficult to work with, saying he did not share his work. As the design had changed significantly and the 32X struggled commercially, development moved to a planned Sega cartridge console powered by nVidia 3D hardware, designed to compete with the Nintendo 64. STI technical director Robert Morgan was instructed to explore this possibility, without hardware specifications or development kits. This decision was made because of the planned console&#x27;s ability to handle 3D graphics and Sega of America senior management&#x27;s disinterest in the Sega Saturn. After Sega announced that it would focus solely on the Saturn, development shifted again, costing the team several weeks. When Naka visited STI and observed the &quot;X-treme&quot; development, he simply said &quot;good luck&quot;.

=== Design ===

 The Saturn version was developed by two teams with two different game engines, starting in the second half of 1995. One team, led by Morgan and including programmer Chris Coffin, developed the free-roaming boss levels. This engine used tools used by Saturn games such as &quot;Panzer Dragoon II Zwei&quot; and rendered bosses as fully polygonal characters. The other team, led by Senn and Alon, developed the main levels, working on PC with the intent of porting their work to Saturn. Alon and Senn focused on building an editor to construct the main levels. Music and backgrounds could not be coded in the editor, and had to be coded manually for each level. Enemies were created as pre-rendered sprites. Senn lost 25 pounds and became severely ill from overworking on &quot;X-treme&quot;.

Other staff included composer Howard Drossin, lead artist Ross Harris, artist/designers Fei Cheng and Andrew Probert, and designers Jason Kuo and Richard Wheeler. Hirokazu Yasuhara, who designed the Genesis &quot;Sonic&quot; games, also contributed. According to Senn, his team was completely different from the STI teams led by Naka; this, combined with their inexperience, &quot;set up seeds of doubt and a political landmine waiting to go off if we didn&#x27;t produce amazing results quickly&quot;. Wallis expressed frustration with the team structure, and felt that internal politics hampered development. Coffin felt the division of responsibilities would ensure every element was perfect.

Difficulties arose from the design. According to Wallis, the game would combine 2D side-scrolling with &quot;the ability to have [Sonic] go into and out of the screen&quot;, which created unexpected problems in implementation. Senn said a primary problem was transitioning &quot;Sonic&quot; simple and fast controls to a 3D environment: &quot;The simplicity of movement, particularly moving very quickly, was now gone. Seeing far enough into the distance, not getting stuck on obstacles, and trying to maintain that sense of free speed was very difficult.&quot; 3D graphics were new, and developers were still learning how they would affect controls and gameplay. Programming for the Saturn proved difficult; as Alon could not get his engine, developed on PC, to run fast enough on Saturn, Morgan outsourced the port to Point of View Software, a third-party company.

=== Disputes within Sega ===
In March 1996, Sega representatives from Japan visited STI to evaluate progress. At this point, &quot;X-treme&quot; was already behind schedule. Senn and other sources indicate that the key visitor was president Nakayama, though Wallis recalls executive vice president Shoichiro Irimajiri. The executive was unimpressed by Senn and Alon&#x27;s work, as the version he saw, ported from PC to Saturn by Point of View, ran at a poor frame rate. Senn, who said the visitor &quot;came storming out practically cursing after seeing what they&#x27;d done&quot;, and Alon attempted to show their most recent PC version, but he left before they had the opportunity.

The visitor was impressed by Coffin&#x27;s boss engine, and requested that &quot;X-treme&quot; be reworked around it. Concerned about the need to create essentially a new game before the strict October 1996 deadline, Wallis isolated Coffin&#x27;s team, preventing outside influence. The team comprised four artists, two programmers, a contractor, and three designers, set up in an old STI location. They worked between sixteen and twenty hours a day. Although neither Senn nor Alon were officially part of the production after the visit, they continued working on their version, hoping to pitch it to Sega as a PC game.

In April, Sega of America executive vice president Bernie Stolar approached STI and asked what he could do to help the game meet its deadline. At Wallis&#x27; suggestion, he provided the tools and source code for Sonic Team&#x27;s 3D Saturn game &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot;. Two weeks later, Stolar requested that the team stop using the engine, as Naka had reportedly threatened to leave Sega if it were used. Senn dismissed this as speculation, but said that, if true, he understood Naka&#x27;s interest in maintaining control over the Sonic Team technology and the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise. Sonic Team was developing its own 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; game using the &quot;Nights&quot; engine, which could have motivated Naka&#x27;s threat. The loss of the &quot;Nights&quot; engine cost the &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot; team weeks of development. In July 2022, Naka denied that he had anything to do with &quot;X-treme&quot; use of the &quot;Nights&quot; engine and said it would have been useless because &quot;Nights&quot; was coded in assembly and &quot;X-treme&quot; was in C. He suggested that the developers invented the story to rationalize their failure to finish &quot;X-treme&quot;.

=== Cancellation ===
In May 1996, Sega displayed a playable demo of &quot;X-treme&quot; at E3 in Los Angeles, and displayed a version of Coffin&#x27;s engine. At this time, team morale had dropped and turnover was high. By August, Coffin had contracted severe walking pneumonia. Wallis praised Coffin&#x27;s effort, but acknowledged that without Coffin the team had no chance of meeting its deadline. Around the same time, Senn became so ill that he was told he had six months to live, though he survived. With both teams crippled two months before the deadline, Wallis canceled the game.

Sega initially stated that &quot;X-treme&quot; had been delayed; however, in early 1997, Sega announced that the game had been canceled. For the 1996 holiday season, Sega instead concentrated on Sonic Team&#x27;s &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; and a port of the Genesis game &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; by Traveller&#x27;s Tales, to which Wallis contributed. Morawiec requested that &quot;X-treme&quot; be reworked into bonus stages in &quot;3D Blast&quot;, but Traveller&#x27;s Tales was unable to properly transfer Sonic&#x27;s model. Sonic Team&#x27;s work on a Saturn 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; game became &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; for the Dreamcast. Remnants of their prototype can be seen in the Saturn compilation game &quot;Sonic Jam&quot; (1997).

While Senn felt the version of &quot;X-treme&quot; he and Alon were developing could have been completed with an additional six to twelve months, Sega&#x27;s PC division would not pay for its development, and may have been hesitant after the engine had been rejected for &quot;X-treme&quot;. After the project was rejected, Alon left Sega. Sega of America disbanded STI in 1996 following management changes. Hector believed that the success of PlayStation led to corporate turmoil within Sega that resulted in STI&#x27;s dissolution. According to Wallis, STI was restructured as Sega of America&#x27;s product development department after the previous product development department had become SegaSoft.

== Cancelled film ==

In August 1994, Sega of America signed a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Trilogy Entertainment to produce a live-action animated film based on &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and tie into &quot;Sonic X-treme.&quot; In May 1995, the screenwriter Richard Jeffries pitched a treatment titled &quot;Sonic: Wonders of the World&quot;. It saw Sonic and Dr. Robotnik escaping from &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot; into the real world. The film was canceled as none of the companies could come to an agreement.

==Legacy==

In place of &quot;Sonic&quot; &quot;X-treme&quot;, Sega released a port of the Genesis game &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;, and &quot;Sonic Jam&quot;, a compilation of Genesis &quot;Sonic&quot; games with an additional 3D level. &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;&#x27;s cancellation is cited as a key reason for the Saturn&#x27;s failure. While Sega controlled up to 55% of the console market in 1994, by August 1997, Sony controlled 47%, Nintendo 40%, and Sega only 12%.

Journalists and fans have speculated about the impact &quot;X-treme&quot; might have had. David Houghton of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; described the prospect of &quot;a good 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; game&quot; on the Saturn as a &quot;What if...&quot; scenario akin to dinosaurs surviving extinction. &quot;IGN&quot; Travis Fahs described &quot;X-treme&quot; as &quot;an empty vessel for Sega&#x27;s ambitions and the hopes of their fans&quot; and said it was an important change for Sega, its mascot and the Saturn. Levi Buchanan, also writing for &quot;IGN&quot;, said while the Saturn&#x27;s lack of a true &quot;Sonic&quot; sequel &quot;didn&#x27;t wholly destroy&quot; its chances, it &quot;sure didn&#x27;t help matters much&quot;. Dave Zdyrko, who operated a prominent Saturn fan site, said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know if [&quot;X-treme&quot;] could&#x27;ve saved the Saturn, but ... &quot;Sonic&quot; helped make the Genesis and it made absolutely no sense why there wasn&#x27;t a great new &quot;Sonic&quot; title ready at or near the launch of the [Saturn]&quot;.

In a 2007 retrospective, producer Wallis said that &quot;X-treme&quot; would have been able to compete with Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario 64.&quot; Senn believed that a version of &quot;X-treme&quot; built by him with Alon&#x27;s engine could have sold well. &quot;Next Generation&quot; said that &quot;X-treme&quot; would have damaged Sega&#x27;s reputation if it did not compare well to competition such as &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot;. Naka was dissatisfied with the game, and in 2012 recalled feeling relief when he learned of its cancellation. Journalists noted similarities in level themes and mechanics between &quot;X-treme&quot; and the 2013 game &quot;Sonic Lost World&quot;, although Sonic Team head Iizuka said the resemblance was coincidental. Senn went to work on the Wii U &quot;Sonic&quot; game &quot;Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric&quot;, which was released in 2014 to negative reviews.

=== Prototypes and recreations ===
For years, little content from &quot;X-treme&quot; was released beyond promotional screenshots. Fahs wrote in 2008 that most &quot;X-treme&quot; developers were unwilling to discuss the game, as &quot;the ordeal remain[ed] a painful memory of unimaginable stress, pressure, and ultimate disappointment&quot;. In 2006, a copy of an early test engine was sold at auction for US$2500 to an anonymous collector. An animated GIF image of gameplay was released, and after a fundraising project by the &quot;Assemblergames&quot; website community purchased the disc from the collector, the disk image was leaked on July 17, 2007. Senn created a website with development history including early footage, a playable character named Tiara, and concept music. Senn considered finishing &quot;X-treme&quot; himself and used some of its concepts in a &quot;Sonic&quot; fangame, though his plans never materialized.

In February 2015, a fan obtained &quot;X-treme&quot; source code and released a playable build, featuring the level shown in the E3 1996 demo. &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot; described it as rough but inventive, lacking speed but retaining the spirit of &quot;Sonic&quot; design. They felt it could have been a good direction for the franchise and a boost for the Saturn had it been completed. In March 2017, another fan began developing a homebrew Saturn game based on &quot;X-treme&quot;, &quot;Sonic Z-treme&quot;, and released a build in September 2018. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; said it was an impressive effort that combined &quot;X-treme&quot;-style ideas and levels with new concepts.

<doc id="1082727" wikidata="Q7696988" url="?curid=1082727" title="Television X">
<text>Television X (TVX) is a series of adult pay-per-view television channels in the United Kingdom owned by Aylo Global Entertainment (Europe) Limited. Until 2020, it was owned by Portland TV which was a subsidiary of Richard Desmond&#x27;s publishing company Northern &amp; Shell until 2016. All of the programmes on the main Television X channel are filmed and produced in the United Kingdom.

It was also known as Television X – The Fantasy Channel for a long time, although it has since dropped that name. It was originally to be called TVX until Desmond was advised that that name was already in use so &quot;The Fantasy Channel&quot; was added. Television X is also known by the abbreviation TVX.

==History==
Television X started broadcasting under its original name – The Fantasy Channel on 2 June 1995. The two original hosts were Charmaine Sinclair and Samantha Jessup, with Debbie Corrigan and Kirsten Imrie making occasional appearances. Much of the original programming: &quot;Superdick&quot;, &quot;Shagnasty and Mutley&quot;, &quot;David Dickie&#x27;s World of Sport&quot; etc. was developed by Deric Botham, then editor of &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine. The station garnered international publicity when it brought the former American prostitute Estella Marie Thompson, also known as Divine Brown, over for a launch at BAFTA&#x27;s headquarters in Piccadilly. On Friday nights, DJ Chris Rogers (aka Caesar the Geezer) presented a live two-hour show with sports agent Eric Hall.

The channel broadcasts from 10.00pm until 5.30am. Its programmes are around 30 minutes in duration and include titles such as &quot;John Cherry: Soccer Stud&quot;, &quot;Council Estate Skanks&quot;, &quot;Charlie Britton Exposed&quot; (in which Charlie is played by Ben Dover), &quot;Diamond Geezers&quot; and &quot;Lara&#x27;s Anal Adventures&quot;. The majority of programmes are heterosexual although some, such as &quot;All Girl Initiation&quot;, feature lesbianism and some, such as &quot;Ladyboy Training&quot;, cover transexualism. Some of the channel&#x27;s programmes are pornographic spoofs on popular mainstream British television shows.

On 23 July 2008, Ofcom fined Portland TV £25,000 for broadcasting a R18-rated pornographic movie on the station in June 2007, with Ofcom rules not allowing R18-rated content to be broadcast on any television station.

===15th birthday===
Television X celebrated its 15th birthday in August 2010 with a photo shoot of 14 of their top models from 1995 to then including Charmaine Sinclair, Lana Cox, Teresa May, Cathy Barry, Michelle Thorne, Lara Latex, Kerry Louise, Sasha Rose and Syren Sexton. They also held a large party to commemorate the event in central London at Café de Paris (London), which featured both strippers and burlesque acts throughout the evening.

==Additional networks==
In addition to the standard Television X network, several additional networks were available on Sky UK.

===Television X Amateur===
Launched on 1 November 2003 as Television X 2 on Sky Channel 971, replacing Erotika 4. TVX 2 showcased viewer-sent videotapes of amateur pornography. By April 2006, the channel was briefly renamed Television X Raw but was soon reverted to its former name by October 2007. During this period, the channel continued to focus on amateur tapes. In November 2008, the channel was renamed Television X Amateur (with an orange colour scheme), once again with the same general focus.

In May 2009, Portland TV was fined a total of £27,500 after the network aired a hardcore pornographic programme named &quot;Bathroom Bitches&quot; in September 2008, with Ofcom stating that channels broadcasting content under an equivalent of an R18 rating must not be broadcast under any meaning.

Television X Amateur was closed on 15 June 2012, with sister network Red Hot Amateur taking over its EPG slot.

===Television X FFWD===
Launched on 1 November 2003 as Television X 3 on Sky channel 972, replacing Erotika 5. TVX 3 was a movie channel that showed pornographic films, which at one point, aired the movies &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; and &quot;Deep Throat&quot;. In April 2006, the channel was renamed Television X Live before reverting to its former name of Television X 3 in October 2007. The programming transitioned to showcasing the &quot;Television X Callgirls Live&quot; chat program. In November 2008, the channel was renamed Television X FFWD (with a purple colour scheme), before closing on 21 May 2009, with its electronic programme guide (EPG) slot being taken over for Portland TV&#x27;s chat services Filth, Cream and Skincity. The slot FFWD was housed in was taken over by sister network Gay TV.

===Bangers===
Bangers was launched at the end of 2005 as Television Xtra, as a Red Button service accessible through the other networks. It eventually launched as a standalone channel in February 2007 before being renamed as Television X 4 in October. The channel initially showcased pornography from continental Europe and the United States. After its renaming, a service called Television X FF (Fast Forward), which minimized non-pornographic content, was added. In November 2008, the channel was renamed to Television X Brits (with a Union Jack colour scheme), and changed its focus to British pornography.

In 2016, Television X Brits was renamed as TVXXX, which was then renamed again to TVX Pornstars on 29 March 2017. In September 2017, TVX Pornstars was added to Virgin Media, replacing Xrated Couples.

On 24 April 2019, with changes on the Sky EPG slot, the channel was renamed to Bangers and moved from 911 to 903 on the EPG. On 30 September 2020, following the purchase of Portland TV by MG Global Entertainment, Bangers was removed, and its Sky EPG slot was replaced with Babes and Brazzers.

===Television X Pay-Per-Night===
In August 2017, Portland TV launched a Television X-branded pay-per-night channel on Sky, replacing Xrated Couples. A second pay-per-night channel, titled Television X Pay-Per-Night 2, replaced Xrated Hook-Ups on Sky.

As part of a shake-up of the adult section on the Sky EPG on 24 April 2019, both Television X pay-per-night networks were shuttered.

===Television X HD===
Since 2010, Television X has an Ofcom licence approved for an HD service.

The HD simulcast of Television X launched on 24 April 2019, being the first pornographic channel in the United Kingdom to broadcast in high-definition. The SD feed relocated to channel 925 on Sky before being removed a week later on 2 May 2019.

The HD feed was very short-lived, however, as the SD feed returned to Sky&#x27;s EPG on 1 October 2019, closing the HD feed.

===Television X Callgirls Live===
Television X Callgirls Live was a televised sex line show broadcast on Television X 3 from 2005. The show was directed by Portway Productions and was produced by Ric Porter, who described it in his autobiography. It started with two &quot;callgirls&quot; (Avalon and Starr), but quickly grew to feature a number of different presenters. Original airtimes were between 10.00pm and 12.00pm but were subsequently changed to between 10.00pm and 2.00am. In August 2008, the show began broadcasting from 8.00pm showing softcore pornography until 10.00pm.

The show also ran on Television X 2 and Television X 4 from 9.00pm until 11.00pm (11.15pm on Friday and Saturday) and then continued on TVX4 for 15 minutes, after which it began broadcasting encrypted hardcore pornography (consistent with the R18 certificate). This section was used as a means of encouraging viewers to subscribe to the Television X package. The channel was also available online, it was significantly cheaper to call the premium-rate telephone number than other televised sex line channels.

===Presenters and awards===
Presenters contracted to Television X in 2008 included Suzie Best, Cathy Barry, Claire Grey (aka Jesse Jayne), Amber Leigh, Renee Richards, Keisha Kane, Cate Harrington, and Donna Marie. In March 2008, glamour model Sammie Pennington was introduced as the new face and body of Television X. Three months later, glamour model Sophie Price was introduced as the new face and body of Television X. In addition, Linsey Dawn McKenzie attended the 2008 UK Adult Film and Television Awards as a representative of Television X and Red Hot TV.

The channel won UK Adult Film and Television Awards 2008 Best Pay Per Night Adult Channel. The award was picked up by Linsey Dawn McKenzie. Additionally on the night of the awards Television X and Red Hot TV (UK) received more than 12 awards including Jay Snake winning best male and Cathy Barry winning best online female actress.

On 11 March 2010, Television X launched their own awards called the SHAFTAs (Soft and Hard Adult Film and Television Awards). Winners included Kerry Louise and Tanya Tate. Both Angel Long and Syren Sexton picked up 2 awards each.

On 3 December 2010, Television X won two awards from UK Adult Producers (UKAP). Tanya Tate collected the award on behalf of Television X for &quot;Tanya Tate&#x27;s Sex Tour of Ireland&quot; which won Best Reality Series. She also starred in the Television X series &quot;Diamond Geezers&quot;, which won Best DVD.

===Websites===
In mid-2007, Television X launched TelevisionX WebTV. The BBFC and Ofcom censorship rules not applying in this domain allowed Television X to show hardcore content to its viewers for the first time. In October 2008, Television X launched TelevisionX.com this change effectively split the Television X website into two. One, televisionxnow.co.uk, to be used for television subscriptions and the other, Televisionx.com to be used for explicit content. This split was a necessity brought about by an Ofcom ruling which banned the advertisement of an explicit website on British television. Television X can only advertise their soft website on air.

The hardcore uncensored internet website features programmes from the Television X station. However, the camerawork, editing, performances and bad language are modified to include explicit representations of sexual intercourse.

<doc id="1082730" wikidata="Q335371" url="?curid=1082730" title="Madhvacharya">
<text>Madhvacharya (; ; 1199–1278 CE or 1238–1317 CE), also known as Purna Prajna () and Ānanda Tīrtha, was an Indian philosopher, theologian and the chief proponent of the &quot;Dvaita&quot; (dualism) school of Vedanta. Madhva called his philosophy &quot;Tattvavāda&quot; meaning &quot;arguments from a realist viewpoint&quot;.

Madhvacharya was born at Pajaka near Udupi on the west coast of Karnataka state in 13th-century India. As a teenager, he became a Sanyasi (monk) joining Brahma-sampradaya guru Achyutapreksha, of the Ekadandi order. Madhva studied the classics of Hindu philosophy, and wrote commentaries on the Principal Upanishads, the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; and the Brahma Sutras (&quot;Prasthanatrayi&quot;), and is credited with thirty seven works in Sanskrit. His writing style was of extreme brevity and condensed expression. His greatest work is considered to be the &quot;Anuvyakhyana&quot;, a philosophical supplement to his bhasya on the Brahma Sutras composed with a poetic structure. In some of his works, he proclaimed himself to be an avatar of Vayu, the son of god Vishnu.

Madhvacharya was a critic of Adi Shankara&#x27;s Advaita Vedanta and Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita Vedanta teachings. He toured India several times, visiting places such as Badrinath, Bengal, Varanasi, Dwaraka, Goa and Kanyakumari, engaging in philosophical debates and visiting Hindu centres of learning. Madhva established the Krishna Mutt at Udupi with a murti secured from Dwarka Gujarat in 1285 CE.

Madhvacharya&#x27;s teachings are built on the premise that there is a fundamental difference between Atman (individual soul, self) and the Brahman (ultimate reality, God Vishnu), these are two different unchanging realities, with individual soul dependent on Brahman, never identical. His school&#x27;s theistic dualism teachings disagreed with the monist teachings of the other two most influential schools of Vedanta based on Advaita&#x27;s nondualism and Vishishtadvaita&#x27;s qualified nondualism. Liberation, asserted Madhva, is achievable only through the grace of God.
The Dvaita school founded by Madhva influenced Vaishnavism, the Bhakti movement in medieval India, and has been one of the three influential Vedānta philosophies, along with Advaita Vedanta and Vishishtadvaita Vedanta. Madhva&#x27;s historical influence in Hinduism, state Kulandran and Kraemer: &quot;has been salutary, but not extensive.“

==Early life==
The biography of Madhvacharya is unclear about his year of birth. Many sources date him to 1238–1317 period, but some place him about the 1199–1278 period.

Madhvācārya was born in Pajaka near Udupi, a coastal district in the present-day Indian state of Karnataka. Traditionally it is believed that his father&#x27;s name is Naduillaya (Sanskrit: Madhyageha, Madhyamandira) and the name of his mother is unclear, although many sources variously claim it as Satyavati and Vedavati. Born in a Tulu Brahmin household, he was named Vāsudeva. Later he became famous by the names Purnaprajna, Anandatirtha and Madhvacharya (or just Madhva). Pūrnaprajña was the name given to him at the time of his initiation into &quot;sannyasa&quot; (renunciation), as a teenager. The name conferred on him when he became the head of his monastery was &quot;Ānanda Tīrtha&quot;. All three of his later names are found in his works. Madhvācārya or Madhva are names most commonly found in modern literature on him, or Dvaita Vedanta related literature.

Madhva began his school after his Upanayana at age seven, and became a monk or &quot;Sannyasi&quot; in his teens, although his father was initially opposed to this. He joined an Advaita Vedanta monastery in Udupi (Karnataka), accepted his guru to be Achyutrapreksha, who is also referred to as Achyutraprajna in some sources. Madhva studied the Upanishads and the Advaita literature, but was unconvinced by its nondualism philosophy of oneness of human soul and god, had frequent disagreements with his guru, left the monastery, and began his own tattvavada movement based on dualism premises of &quot;Dvi&quot; – asserting that human soul and god (as Vishnu) are two different things. Madhva never acknowledged Achyutrapreksha as his guru or his monastic lineage in his writings. Madhva is said to have been clever in philosophy, and also to have been tall and strongly built.

==Career==
Madhvacharya never established a &quot;matha&quot; (monastery) dedicated to Dvaita philosophy, however his lineage of students became the sanctuary for a series of Dvaita scholars such as Jayatirtha, Sripadaraja, Vyasatirtha, Vadiraja Tirtha, Raghuttama Tirtha, Raghavendra Tirtha and Satyanatha Tirtha who followed in the footsteps of Madhva.

A number of hagiographies have been written by Madhva&#x27;s disciples and followers. Of these, the most referred to and most authentic is the sixteen cantos Sanskrit biography &quot;Madhvavijaya&quot; by Narayana Panditacharya – son of Trivikrama Pandita, who himself was a disciple of Madhva.

=== Incarnation of Vayu, the wind god===
In several of his texts, Sarma and other scholars state, &quot;Madhvacharya proclaims himself to be the third avatar or incarnation of Vayu, wind god, the son of Vishnu&quot;. He, thus, asserted himself to be Hanuman – the first avatar of Vayu, and Bhima – a Pandava in the Mahabharata and the second avatar of Vayu. In one of his bhasya on the Brahma Sutras, he asserts that the authority of the text is from his personal encounter with Vishnu. Madhva, states Sarma, believed himself to be an intermediary between Vishnu and Dvaita devotees, guiding the latter in their journey towards Vishnu.

==Miracles==
Madhva is said to have performed several miracles during his lifetime, including transforming tamarind seeds into gold coins, consuming 4,000 bananas and thirty big pots of milk in one sitting, fighting and winning against robbers and wild animals, crossing the Ganges without getting his clothes wet, and giving light to his students through the nails of his big toes after the lamp went out while they were interpreting a text at night.

==Interpretations==
Madhvacharya is said to have quoted some verses from his unique revisions of scriptures. Also, he is said to have quoted many unique books like &quot;Kamatha Sruti&quot;. The interpretation of Balittha Sukta by Madhvacharya and his followers to prove that Madhvacharya was an incarnation of Vayu is considered highly unique by standard commentaries on them like Sayana and Horace Hayman Wilson.

==Works of Madhvacharya==

Thirty seven Dvaita texts are attributed to Madhvacharya. Of these, thirteen are bhasya (review and commentary) on earliest Principal Upanishads, a &quot;Madhva-bhasya&quot; on the foundational text of Vedanta school of Hinduism – Brahma Sutras, another &quot;Gita-bhasya&quot; on Bhagavad Gita, a commentary on forty hymns of the Rigveda, a review of the Mahabharata in poetic style, a commentary called &quot;Bhagavata-tatparya-nirnaya&quot; on Bhagavata Purana. Apart from these, Madhva is also attributed for authoring many stotras, poems and texts on bhakti of Vishnu and his avatars. The &quot;Anu-Vyakhyana&quot;, a supplement to Madhvacharya&#x27;s commentary on Brahma Sutras, is his masterpiece, states Sharma.

While being a profusely productive writer, Madhvacharya restricted the access to and distribution of his works to outsiders who were not part of Dvaita school, according to Sarma. However, Bartley disagrees and states that this is inconsistent with the known history of extensive medieval Vedantic debates on religious ideas in India which included Dvaita school&#x27;s ideas.

==Madhva&#x27;s philosophy==

The premises and foundations of Dvaita Vedanta, also known as &quot;Dvaitavada&quot; and &quot;Tattvavada&quot;, are credited to Madhvacharya. His philosophy championed unqualified dualism. Madhva&#x27;s work is classically placed in contrast with monist ideas of Shankara&#x27;s Advaita Vedanta and Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita Vedanta.

===Epistemology===
Madhva calls epistemology &quot;Anu pramana&quot;. It accepts three &quot;pramānas&quot;, that is three facts or three correct means of knowledge, in contrast to one of Charvaka and six of Advaita schools of Hindu philosophies:
*&quot;Pratyaksha&quot; (प्रत्यक्ष) means perception. It is of two types in Dvaita and other Hindu schools: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described as that of inner sense, the mind.
*&quot;Anumāna&quot; (अनुमान) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason. Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of &quot;Anumana&quot;. This method of inference consists of three parts: &quot;pratijna&quot; (hypothesis), &quot;hetu&quot; (a reason), and &quot;drshtanta&quot; (examples).
*&quot;Śabda&quot; (शब्द) means relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts. It is also known as Agama in Madhva&#x27;s Dvaita tradition, and incorporates all the Vedas. Hiriyanna explains &quot;Sabda-pramana&quot; as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly.

Madhva and his followers introduced &quot;kevala-pramaana&quot; as the &quot;knowledge of an object as it is&quot;, separate from &quot;anu-pramana&quot; described above.

Madhva&#x27;s Dvaita school holds that Vishnu as a God, who is also Hari, Krishna, Vasudeva and Narayana, can only be known through the proper &quot;samanvaya&quot; (connection) and &quot;pramana&quot; of the Vedic scriptural teachings. Vishnu, according to Madhvacharya, is not the creator of the Vedas, but the teacher of the Vedas. Madhva&#x27;s school of thought assert that knowledge is intrinsically valid, and the knower and the known are independently real. Madhvacharya asserted that both the ritual part (&quot;karma-kanda&quot;, Mimamsa) and the knowledge part (&quot;jnana-kanda&quot;, Upanishadic Vedanta) in the Vedas, are equally valid and an interconnected whole. As asserted by the Mimamsa school of Hindu philosophy, Madhvacharya held that the Vedas are author-less, and that their truth is in all of its parts (i.e. the , ,  and )...

===Metaphysics===
The metaphysical reality is plural, stated Madhvacharya. There are primarily two &quot;tattvas&quot; or categories of reality – &#x27; (independent reality) and &#x27; (dependent reality). Ishvara (as God Vishnu or Krishna) is the cause of the universe and the only independent reality, in Madhvacharya&#x27;s view. The created universe is the dependent reality, consisting of &#x27; (individual souls) and &quot;Jada&quot; (matter, material things). Individual souls are plural, different and distinct realities. &#x27;s are sentient and matter is non-sentient, according to Madhvacharya.

Madhva further enumerates the difference between dependent and independent reality as a fivefold division (&quot;pancha-bheda&quot;) between God, souls and material things. These differences are:
(1) Between material things;
(2) Between material thing and soul;
(3) Between material thing and God;
(4) Between souls; and
(5) Between soul and God.

This difference is neither temporary nor merely practical; it is an invariable and natural property of everything. Madhva calls it &quot;Taratamya&quot; (gradation in pluralism). There is no object like another, according to Madhvacharya. There is no soul like another. All souls are unique, reflected in individual personalities. The sea is full; the tank is full; a pot is full; everything is full, yet each fullness is different, asserted Madhvacharya.

&quot;Taratamya&quot; is based on inherent differences amongst all beings. These differences determine whether souls are eligible for liberation, rebirth, or darkness.

According to Madhvacharya, even in liberation (moksha), the bliss is different for each person based on each one&#x27;s degree of knowledge and spiritual perfection. This liberation according to him, is only achievable with grace of God Vishnu.

====Nature of the Brahman====
Madhva conceptualised Brahman as a being who enjoys His own bliss, while the entire universe evolves through a nebulous chaos. He manifests, every now and then, to help the evolution process. The four primary manifestation of Him as the Brahman are, according to Madhva, Vasudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Sankarasana, which are respectively responsible for the redemptive, creative, sustaining and destructive aspects in the universe. His secondary manifestations are many, and all manifestations are at par with each other, it is the same infinite no matter how He manifests. Brahman is the creator of the universe, perfect in knowledge, perfect in knowing, perfect in its power, and distinct from souls, distinct from matter. For liberation, mere intellectual conceptualization of Brahman as creator is not enough, the individual soul must feel attraction, love, attachment and devotional surrender to Him, and only His grace leads to redemption and liberation, according to Madhva.

The Vishnu as Brahman concept of Madhvacharya is a concept similar to God in major world religions. His writings led some early colonial-era Indologists such as George Abraham Grierson to suggest the 13th-century Madhva was influenced by Christianity, but later scholarship has rejected this theory.

===Soteriology===
Madhvacharya considered Jnana Yoga and Karma Yoga to be insufficient to the path of liberation without Bhakti. Vishnu was the supreme God to Madhva, who can only be reached through Vayu; he further states, faith leads to the grace of God, and grace leads to the liberation of soul.

The knowledge of God, for Madhvacharya, is not a matter of intellectual acceptance of the concept, but an attraction, affection, constant attachment, loving devotion and complete surrender to the grace of God. He rejects monist theories believing that knowledge liberates, asserting instead that it is Divine grace through Bhakti that liberates. To Madhva, God obscures reality by creating Maya and Prakriti, which causes bondage and suffering; and only God can be the source of soul&#x27;s release. Liberation occurs when, with the grace of God, one knows the true nature of self and the true nature of God.

===Ethics===
Evil and suffering in the world, according to Madhvacharya, originates in man, and not God. Every &quot;Jiva&quot; (individual soul) is the agent of actions, not &quot;Jada&quot; (matter), and not &quot;Ishvara&quot; (God). While Madhva asserts each individual self is the &quot;Kartritva&quot; (real agency), the self is not an absolutely independent agent to him. This is because, states Madhva, the soul is influenced by sensory organs, one&#x27;s physical body and such material things which he calls as gifts of God. Man has free will, but is influenced by his innate nature, inclinations and past karma.

Madhvacharya asserts, &quot;Yathecchasi tatha kuru&quot;, which Sharma translates and explains as &quot;one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk&quot;. Madhva does not address the problem of evil, that is how can evil exist with that of a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. According to Sharma, &quot;Madhva&#x27;s tripartite classification of souls makes it unnecessary to answer the problem of evil&quot;. According to David Buchta, this does not address the problem of evil, because the omnipotent God &quot;could change the system, but chooses not to&quot; and thus sustains the evil in the world. This view of self&#x27;s agency of Madhvacharya was, states Buchta, an outlier in Vedanta school and Indian philosophies in general.

This observation from David Buchta is countered and explained by the understanding that the tripartite characteristic is intrinsic to the souls. That is to say, those specific characteristics define each soul individually, and any attempt to change these would mean changing the souls themselves and subsequently the identity of each individual. Therefore, changing these tripartite characteristics would cause that particular individual to no longer exist, and each individual exists for a particular reason. Nonetheless, an omnipotent being would be still able to prevent evil without changing the intrinsic nature of the soul since the omnipotent being is not bound by any limitations, especially those within the dependent reality. Therefore, the final explanation is that the omnipotent being is not purposefully allowing evil to occur but rather allows an independent operation of the dependent reality to encourage free will in each individual. It is therefore the individual&#x27;s choice whether to seek out the omnipotent being through faith, which allows the individual guidance on how to lead a life of virtue. Thus, evil is a failure to live life with virtue and a natural consequence of free will.

Moral laws and ethics exist, according to Madhva, and are necessary for the grace of God and for liberation.

==Views on other schools==

Madhvacharya was a fierce critic of competing Vedanta schools, and other schools of Indian philosophies such as Buddhism and Jainism. He wrote up arguments against twenty one ancient and medieval era Indian scholars to help establish the foundations of his own school of thought.

Madhvacharya was most ardent critic of Advaita Vedanta, accusing Shankara and the Advaitins of teaching Buddhism under the cover of Vedanta. Advaita&#x27;s nondualism asserts that Atman (soul) and Brahman are blissful and identical, unchanging transcendent Reality, there is interconnected oneness of all souls and Brahman, with no pluralities. Madhva, in contrast asserts that Atman (soul) and Brahman are different, only Vishnu is the Lord (Brahman), individual souls are also distinct and depend on Vishnu, and there are pluralities. Of all schools, Madhva directed his critique at Advaita most, penning four major texts, including &quot;Upadhikhandana&quot; and &quot;Tattvadyota&quot;, primarily dedicated to scrutinizing Advaita.

Madhvacharya disagreed with aspects of Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita. Vishishtadvaita school, a realist system of thought like Madhvacharya&#x27;s Dvaita school, also asserts that Jiva (human souls) and Brahman (as Vishnu) are different, a difference that is never transcended. God Vishnu alone is independent, all other gods and beings are dependent on Him, according to both Madhvacharya and Ramanuja. However, in contrast to Madhvacharya&#x27;s views, Vishishtadvaita school asserts &quot;qualified non-dualism&quot;, that souls share the same essential nature of Brahman, and that there is a universal sameness in the quality and degree of bliss possible for human souls, and every soul can reach the bliss state of God Himself. While the older school of Vishishtadvaita asserted &quot;qualitative monism and quantitative pluralism of souls&quot;, states Sharma, Madhvacharya asserted both &quot;qualitative and quantitative pluralism of souls&quot;.

Shankara&#x27;s Advaita school and Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita school are premised on the assumption that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya posited that some souls enjoy spreading chaos and irreligion, and even enjoy being eternally doomed and damned as such.

Madhvacharya&#x27;s style of criticism of other schools of Indian philosophy was part of the ancient and medieval Indian tradition. He was part of the Vedanta school, which emerged in post-Vedic period as the most influential of the six schools of Hindu philosophy, and his targeting of Advaita tradition, states Bryant, reflects it being the most influential of Vedanta schools.

==Influence==
Madhvacharya extended an independent, original philosophy in the inference of Vaishnavism.

The Madhva Sampradaya fostered Bhakti and search of Knowledge. Madhvacharya and his ascetic followers propagated the Dvaita Siddhanta through their commentaries and critical lectures. Such literature and works for critical thinking were written majorly in Sanskrit and not readily accessible to common people. An alternate avenue evolved organically by Sishyas or Bhaktas of the Madhva Philosophy who studied these core books, read philosophy, practised asceticism though living a householder&#x27;s life, dedicated themselves to the service of God. This set of followers undertook the mission of carrying Madhva&#x27;s teaching to the four comers of the country using Kannada or the local language as a vehicle of communication. These spirited missionaries were known as the Hari-Dasas. The HariDasas pioneered in breaking the shackles of caste, creed and regionalism – they practiced devotion in its purest form and were instrumental in delivering the marvels of Madhva Siddhantha to the common man by way of songs, suladees and Bhakti Dasa Sahitya. These Haridasas came to be known as the Dasa Section or Dasa-Kuta of the Madhva Sampradaya in contrast with the Vyaasa-Kuta who were Scholars, Pandits or teachers of literature &amp; critical thought.

There is no difference between the Vyasa-kuta and Dasa-Kuta in their learning, training, or approach to philosophy. While Vyasa-Kuta being scholars, Acharyas or Pandits strongly believed in acquiring Jnaana/Knowledge traditionally, the Dasa-Kuta simplified the acquired knowledge into Bhakti or devotion. The terms &#x27;Dasaru&#x27; and &#x27;Vyasaru&#x27; first came into vogue at the time of Purandaradasa and his religious preceptor, Vyasaraya. Over time, &#x27;Vyasakuta&#x27; meant the branch of devotees who were well-versed in Sanskrit and who knew the philosophy in the original, and &#x27;&quot;Dasakuta&quot;&#x27; or &quot;Dasa Dasapantha&quot;, meant that branch of devotees who conveyed the meassage of Dvaita philosophy through simplified vernacular Bhakti movement.

Other influential subschools of Vaishnavism competed with the ideas of Madhvacharya, such as the Chaitanya subschool, whose Jiva Gosvami asserts that only Krishna is &quot;Svayam Bhagavan&quot; (the supreme form of God), in contrast to Madhva who asserts that all Vishnu avatars are equal and identical, with both sharing the belief that emotional devotion to God is the means to spiritual liberation. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1496–1534) is said to be a disciple of Isvara Puri who was a disciple of Madhavendra Puri who was a disciple of Lakshmipati Tirtha who was a disciple of Vyasatirtha (1469–1539) of Madhvacharya&#x27;s Sampradaya. According to Sharma, the influence of Madhva&#x27;s Dvaita ideas have been most prominent on the Chaitanya school of Bengal Vaishnavism, and in Assam.

A subsect of Gaudiya Vaishnavas from Orissa and West Bengal claim to be followers of Madhvacharya. Madhva established in Udupi Krishna Matha attached to a god Krishna temple. Gaudiya Vaishnavas also worship Krishna, who is in the mode of Vrindavana.

===Hindu-Christian-Muslim controversies===
Madhvacharya was misperceived and misrepresented by both Christian missionaries and Hindu writers during the colonial era scholarship. The similarities in the primacy of one God, dualism and distinction between man and God, devotion to God, the son of God as the intermediary, predestination, the role of grace in salvation, as well as the similarities in the legends of miracles in Christianity and Madhvacharya&#x27;s Dvaita tradition fed these stories. Among Christian writers, GA Grierson creatively asserted that Madhva&#x27;s ideas evidently were &quot;borrowed from Christianity, quite possibly promulgated as a rival to the central doctrine of that faith&quot;. Among Hindu writers, according to Sarma, SC Vasu creatively translated Madhvacharya&#x27;s works to identify Madhvacharya with Christ, rather than compare their ideas.

Modern scholarship rules out the influence of Christianity on Madhvacharya, as there is no evidence that there ever was a Christian settlement where Madhvacharya grew up and lived, or that there was a sharing or discussion of ideas between someone with knowledge of the Bible and Christian legends, and him.

There are also assumptions Madhva was influenced by Islam. The &quot;Madhvavijaya&quot; tells about Madhva meeting the Sultan of Delhi and saying to him in fluent Persian that both worship the same one God of the universe, and that he spreads the faith in God. The sultan is said to have been so impressed by this that he wanted give half of the empire to Madhva, which he refused. However, the indologist and religious scholar Helmuth von Glasenapp assumes that monotheism can also be derived from the Indian intellectual world, and that there is no reason supporting the theory that Madhva&#x27;s views on afterlife were influenced by Muslim or Christian impulses.

===Monasteries===
 
Madhvacharya established eight &quot;mathas&quot; (monasteries) in Udupi with his eight disciples as its head along with Padmanabha Tirtha Matha. The Udupi Ashta Mathas are Palimaru matha, Adamaru matha, Krishnapura matha, Puttige matha, Shirur matha, Sodhe matha, Kaniyooru matha and Pejavara matha. These eight surround the &quot;Anantheswara&quot; Krishna Hindu temple. The matha are laid out in a rectangle, the temples on a square grid pattern. The monks in the matha are sannyasis, and the tradition of their studies and succession (Paryaya system) were established by Madhvacharya. The monastery has a pontiff system, that rotates after a fixed period of time. The pontiff is called &quot;Swamiji&quot;, and he leads daily Krishna prayers according to Madhva tradition, as well as annual festivals. The process and Vedic mantra rituals for Krishna worship in Dvaita monasteries follow the procedure written by Madhvacharya in &quot;Tantrasara&quot;. The Krishna worship neither involves &quot;bali&quot; (sacrifice) nor any fire rituals. The succession ceremony in Dvaita school involves the outgoing Swamiji welcoming the incoming one, then walking together to the icon of Madhvacharya at the entrance of Krishna temple in Udupi, offering water to him, expressing reverence then handing over the same vessel with water that Madhvacharya used when he handed over the leadership of the monastery he founded. The monastery include kitchens, &quot;bhojan-shala&quot;, run by monks and volunteers. These serve food daily to nearly 15,000 to 20,000 monks, students and visiting pilgrims without social discrimination. During succession ceremonies, over 80,000 people are served a vegetarian meal by Udupi &quot;bhojan-shalas&quot;.

Madhvacharya established a matha with his disciple Padmanabha Tirtha as its head to spread Tattvavada (Dvaita) outside Tulunadu region with the instructions that his disciples Narahari Tirtha, Madhava Tirtha and Akshobhya Tirtha should, in turn, become the successors of this matha. According to Surendranath Dasgupta, Uttaradi Math is the main matha of Padmanabha Tirtha and it was divided twice, and so we end up with three mathas, the other two being Vyasaraja Math and Raghavendra Math. Uttaradi Math, along with Vyasaraja Math and Raghavendra Math, is considered to be the three premier apostolic institutions of Dvaita Vedanta and are jointly referred as &quot;Mathatraya&quot;. It is the pontiffs and pandits of the &quot;Mathatraya&quot; that have been the principle architects of post-Madhva Dvaita Vedanta through the centuries. Among the mathas outside of Tulu Nadu region, Uttaradi Matha is the largest. All the mathas outside of the Tulu region are one way or the other descended from Padmanabha Tirtha. Including mathas in Udupi, there are twenty-four Madhva mathas in India. The main center of Madhva&#x27;s tradition is in Karnataka.

Professor Kiyokazu Okita and Indologist B. N. K. Sharma says, Sannyasis in the lineage of Dvaita school of Vedanta belongs to Ēkadaṇḍi tradition just like the Sanyasi&#x27;s of Advaita of Adi Shankara.

<doc id="1082732" wikidata="Q1317828" url="?curid=1082732" title="Road Rash">
<text>Road Rash is a motorcycle racing video game series by Electronic Arts in which the player participates in violent, illegal street races. The series started on the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and was released on various other systems over the years. The game&#x27;s title is based on the slang term for the severe friction burns that can occur in a motorcycle fall where skin comes into contact with the ground at high speed.

Six different games were released from 1991 to 2000, and an alternate version of one game was developed for the Game Boy Advance. The Sega Genesis trilogy was re-released in &quot;EA Replay&quot; for the PlayStation Portable. The series sold 3 million units by 1998.

==Games==
===&quot;Road Rash&quot; (1991)===

Road Rash debuted on the Sega Genesis in 1991. The game takes place in California, on progressively longer two-lane roads. The two-player mode allows two people to play alternating. There are 14 other opponents in a race. A port of the game was released for the Amiga, and various scaled-down versions were made for Master System, Game Gear, and Game Boy. The Game Boy version is one of two licensed games that is incompatible with the Game Boy Color and newer consoles in the Game Boy line. A SNES version was planned and then canceled.

===&quot;Road Rash II&quot; (1992)===

Road Rash II was released in 1992 for the Sega Genesis. The sequel took the engine and sprites from the first game and added more content. The largest addition was proper two-player modes: &quot;Split Screen&quot; versus the other computer opponents, and the duel mode &quot;Mano A Mano&quot;. The races take place all across the United States: Alaska, Hawaii, Tennessee, Arizona, and Vermont. The list of bikes has been increased to fifteen (separated into three classes, with the later ones featuring nitro boosts), and a chain was added to supplement the club. Other details include the navigation of the menu screens being considerably easier; and more manageable passwords, being less than half the size of the first game.

===&quot;Road Rash&quot; (1994)===

Road Rash was released in 1994 for CD-based platforms such as 3DO, Sega CD, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Microsoft Windows. It features a number of changes such as the ability to choose characters (with various starting cashpiles and bikes, some with starting weapons) before playing, fleshed-out reputation and gossip systems and full-motion video sequences to advance a plot. The game features all-California locales: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Coast Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. The roads themselves feature brief divided road sections.

===&quot;Road Rash 3&quot; (1995)===

Road Rash 3 was released in 1995 for the Sega Genesis. Races take place across the world, each level featuring five of seven total locales: Brazil, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Kenya, Australia, and Japan. In addition to the standard fifteen bikes, four part upgrades are available for each. Eight weapons are available, and &quot;Road Rash 3&quot; introduces the player&#x27;s ability to hold on to weapons between races and the ability to accumulate multiple weapons.

===&quot;Road Rash 3D&quot; (1998)===

Road Rash 3D was released in 1998 for the PlayStation. The game is mostly not based on sprites. The race courses were pieced together from an interconnected series of roads. The game has less emphasis on combat and more on racing.

===&quot;Road Rash 64&quot; (1999)===

Road Rash 64 was released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64. Electronic Arts did not design or publish it; the intellectual property rights were licensed to THQ, which in turn had its own Pacific Coast Power &amp; Light (founded by former EA employee Don Traeger) develop the game.

===&quot;Road Rash: Jailbreak&quot; (2000)===

Road Rash: Jailbreak was released in 2000 for the PlayStation, with a handheld port released in 2003 for the Game Boy Advance with the same title. New features include an interconnected road system and two-player cooperative play with a sidecar.

===&quot;Road Rash&quot; (2009)===
Road Rash was released in 2009 for J2ME. It was sold on EA Mobile site only.

==Spiritual successor==

A spiritual successor, Road Redemption, was later released in 2017 and 2018 for Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One &amp; later Road Redemption Mobile on Android &amp; iOS in 2022.

==Music==
The Sega Genesis trilogy features music by EA composers Rob Hubbard (1 and II), Michael Bartlow (1), Tony Berkeley (II), and Don Veca (II and 3). Later entries were among the first video games to include licensed music tracks from major recording artists in gameplay.

The rock radio station in EA&#x27;s 2004 game &quot;The Urbz&quot; is called &quot;Road Rash FM&quot;.

==Future==
Criterion Games considered developing a new &quot;Road Rash&quot; game multiple times, potentially a &quot;Burnout Versus Road Rash&quot;, but nothing has come of this; they have also expressed a desire to move away from racing games in particular. Dan Geisler, main programmer and co-designer of the Sega Genesis trilogy, was working on a new title along with a number of the original &quot;Road Rash&quot; staff members, then named &quot;Hard Rider: Back in the Saddle&quot;; he first announced it via a Reddit thread, and frequently mentioned progress on his Twitter account, but was unable to find funding for it and dropped the idea.

<doc id="1082733" wikidata="Q7055767" url="?curid=1082733" title="North Kelvinside">
<text>North Kelvinside (also referred to as North Kelvin, ) is a residential district of the Scottish city of Glasgow.

It is often regarded as a subdistrict of Maryhill, sharing its G20 postcode, as well as its House of Commons electoral constituency prior to incorporation into Glasgow North in 2005. However, North Kelvinside was never a part of Maryhill Police Burgh prior to its incorporation into Glasgow in 1912 and the area is markedly different socially and architecturally.

North Kelvinside was originally part of a country estate, which became enveloped by the surrounding city. As a result, many buildings date from the early twentieth century. It is located on the northern edge of Glasgow&#x27;s west end and its southern boundary is marked by the River Kelvin. It is close to the Glasgow Botanic Gardens, the former BBC Scotland building on Queen Margaret Drive, and in the vicinity of the University of Glasgow, although all are actually outwith the North Kelvinside area itself. Being close to the university, many students and academics live in the area.

Kelvinside House was the property of Lord Provost Sir James Campbell, and was located in the area that is now North Kelvinside. It was there that his son, the future Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was born 1836.

North Kelvinside is not directly north of the more upmarket area Kelvinside, which is mainly located to the west. Rather, the area is so named because it is located on the north bank of the River Kelvin. The housing consists mainly of tenements, although there are also some grander villa-type buildings, converted Victorian townhouses, pre-industrial cottages and a small, well-maintained (now mainly ex-)council estate. The area has a reputation for being quiet and tranquil, despite its central location. Unusually, it is impossible to fully traverse the district by car in any direction, due in part to a system of road-blocks designed to combat ratrunning.

Architecturally significant buildings in the area include the Kelvin Stevenson Memorial Church (by J. J. Stevenson, 1898); Gillespie, Kidd &amp; Coia&#x27;s St. Charles Parish Church (1959), noted for its hyperbolic paraboloid concrete roof and Stations of the Cross sculptures by Benno Schotz; and the unique Mackintosh Church at Queen&#x27;s Cross, the only church designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Another local landmark is Alexander &quot;Greek&quot; Thomson&#x27;s Sixty Steps (1872). Contemporary published sources suggest that the steps, associated retaining wall and the original Queen Margaret Bridge were actually part of John E. Walker&#x27;s co-ordinated civil engineering works of 1869/1870 to the designs of Ritchie Rodger C.E. in preparation for the development of the suburb.

North Kelvinside also contains the former pub where the &#x27;balcony scene&#x27; in the film &quot;Trainspotting&quot; was shot, the Kelvin walkway along the banks of the eponymous river, linking Kelvingrove Park and the Botanic Gardens, and a row of small independent shops and cafes. Outdoor amenities include the North Kelvin Meadow and the Children&#x27;s Wood which form local green spaces. Scotland&#x27;s oldest dedicated squash club since 1934, SSRC (Scottish Squash and Racketball Club), is to be found on Malloch Street a short distance from Queen Margaret Drive, with connections going back to the military presence at the barracks that are now Wyndford. The area is also within walking distance of the shops, pubs and restaurants on Great Western and Byres Roads.

Famous current or former residents include former Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the nurse Louisa Jordan, the actor Robbie Coltrane, the comedian Stanley Baxter, director Lynne Ramsay, screenwriter and playwright Peter McDougall, members of the rock band Teenage Fanclub, TV interior designers Justin Ryan and Colin McAllister, YouTube sensation Rombodog, Ian Davidson MP and former Maryhill MP, Maria Fyfe.

There was a North Kelvinside Secondary School that served most of the Maryhill district of Glasgow. However, the school was closed and the vast majority of the pupils transferred to Cleveden Secondary School in the Kelvindale area on the other side of the River Kelvin to the west. Former pupils include actor Robert Carlyle and musician Jimmy Somerville as well as Janis Sharp; mother of Gary McKinnon.
The area is served by North Kelvinside Parish Church, a Church of Scotland congregation which was made famous after World War II, by the work and writing of its minister Rev Tom Allan, particularly his book &quot;The Face of My Parish&quot;. However, in recent years, the church building was demolished, leaving only the halls which are now in poor condition. The congregation has also been in sharp decline and is currently uniting with the nearby Ruchill Parish Church.

Just south of the area is Hillhead, which forms the heart of Glasgow&#x27;s West End, and to the north is Maryhill. To the west are Kelvindale and Kelvinside, and to the east Firhill and Woodside.

The district, along with Firhill and Murano Street Student Village, is served by North Kelvin Community Council.

<text>Warmaster is a ruleset for tabletop wargames written by Rick Priestley, published by Specialist Games (a division of Games Workshop), and set in the &quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot; setting. It is different from &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battles&quot; in both appearance and gameplay. It is intended for 10 –12 mm miniatures. Basic troops are based on stands, of which typically three make a unit. Generals, Heroes and Wizards are mounted individually or with their retinue.

Gameplay focuses on command and control. While magic is used in the game, its effect on the game is limited. The game is designed to focus on the general&#x27;s ability to command rather than just his army&#x27;s ability to fight.

In the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe, &quot;Epic&quot; fills much the same &quot;large scale battle&quot; role as &quot;Warmaster&quot; does in &quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot;, though the two systems do not share rules, and &quot;Epic&quot; is intended for slightly smaller 6 mm miniatures.

==Releases==
The original version, the fantasy ruleset &quot;Warmaster&quot;, was first released in 2000. As with most of the &quot;specialist&quot; games products, the support strategy from Games Workshop has evolved over time. Once a part of the Specialist Games division, Warmaster was then directly supported by Games Workshop itself, albeit at a reduced level. In 2013 Games Workshop stopped producing the miniatures and started to remove them from their webstore as stocks ran out. A freely downloadable &quot;Living Rulebook&quot;, along with supplements and archived magazine articles, are available through the fan-administered site Specialist Games.

In mid-2006, a new online supplement was added to the Specialist Games website, known as &quot;Warmaster Armies&quot;. This supplement includes slightly revised lists for the six original armies (High Elves, Empire, Dwarfs, Chaos, Orcs and Goblins, and Tomb Kings of Khemri), alongside new lists for eight forces (Dark Elves, Skaven, Bretonnians, Lizardmen, Kislevites, Vampire Counts, Daemonic Hordes, and Araby).

This was followed in 2009 by a fan-based supplement release. This included a large number of alternative, trial or fan designed army lists. The Warmuster publication aimed to promote ongoing development of the game but has since been superseded and refined (see below for &quot;Warmaster Revolution&quot;).

In 2010 Warmaster 2nd Edition was released, which compiled and clarified the siege rules written for the game over the preceding 10 years.

Since 2017 a revamped ruleset was released by the &quot;Warmaster&quot; community called &quot;Warmaster Revolution&quot;. Bringing together elements of &quot;Warmaster Ancients&quot; and some extra &#x27;house rules&#x27;, &quot;Warmaster Revolution&quot; has quickly established itself as the ruleset of choice for &quot;Warmaster&quot; players. Its release coincided with a marked upturn of interest with the game, due in no small part to the launch of &quot;Warmaster Podcast&quot; in 2016. With a growing FB community, YouTube videos and more tournaments globally, &quot;Warmaster&quot; is experiencing a renaissance with an expanding base of new converts and returning players. The new ruleset incorporates many of the 2009 supplement army lists but has a working committee that looks to refine the lists to make them balanced and playable as well as tweak current army lists.

===Battle of Five Armies===

In 2005 Games Workshop released a boxed game called &quot;Great Battles of Middle Earth: The Battle of Five Armies&quot; based on the battle from the book &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. The rules are heavily based on Warmaster, and it uses the same miniature scale. The boxed set contains rules, 10 mm plastic miniatures, and scenery (plastic hills, ruins and a cardboard river).

Additional miniatures for this game were cast in white metal. While detailed in the box set rule book, these extra miniatures were sold separately. They were discontinued shortly after being released. The box set remained in print for a longer while. It was removed before the launch of the 28 mm line based on the movie &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;.

===Warmaster Ancients===

Also in 2005 Warhammer Historical published &quot;Warmaster Ancients&quot;, a modified version of the Fantasy rules suitable for battles covering a period from early Biblical times to 1066. The rules are different from the original &#x27;fantasy&#x27; version to better represent historical battles and units. Cavalry, for example, was made weaker in relation to infantry in favour of armies such as the Romans and the Norse.

October 2006 saw the release of &quot;Warmaster Ancient Armies&quot;, which includes 20 new army lists (all of which are set prior to 1000 AD), along with rules for campaign play and a number of new rule clarifications and unit modifications. The campaign rules have been described as a good way of linking battles, but are not suitable for historical campaigns.

A new supplement for a later period, &quot;Warmaster Medieval Armies&quot; was released in December 2008. This supplemental book contains 30 new army lists and a number of significant rule changes from the Fantasy and Ancients version. Knights are introduced as a powerful unit shifting the game balance back towards cavalry, like in the original, Fantasy version. Special rules are provided for sieges, period equipment, and larger command elements called batailles.

==Warmaster Gameplay==

Warmaster works at a higher organisation level than Warhammer Fantasy to represent very large battles in the Warhammer world. The components of an army are divided into two basic types: units and characters. In the original 10 mm Games Workshop-produced miniatures, figures are cast 6 men to a strip, though many gamers base their miniatures with other maker&#x27;s figures to produce 4-12 figure-per-base bases in order to create a variety of mass effects. Standard bases for Warmaster Ancients are 40 mm x 20 mm elements. Units are normally made of three such elements each. Infantry are based along the 40 mm edge, while cavalry, chariots, monsters and artillery are based along the 20 mm edge. Characters represent commanders such as generals, heroes and wizards and may be based as the player desires, generally on round diorama-sculpted coins or 40 or 20mm wide bases in order for them to be included directly in combat alongside the troops.

Gameplay proceeds with the rolling of dice. Units in Warmaster must be activated and moved by rolling against the command value of a character; units can be activated multiple times, though the roll becomes progressively more difficult. If a commander fails his activation roll, he can no longer command units in that turn. Units may be moved into contact with enemy troops and are considered charging. To enable commanders to move their armies around, units can be formed into brigades of up to four units.

Once all units have been moved eligible units are allowed to shoot and wizards may attempt to cast a spell. Shooting is not very deadly, but any hits scored may force an enemy unit to fall back and cost the player further command rolls to draw back into combat. Shooting is therefore primarily aimed at disrupting enemy formation and cohesion rather than destroy them.

After the shooting phase follows the combat phase, all units involved in combat may roll a number of six-sided dice equivalent to their attack value. Units based along the 20 mm edge have a tremendous advantage against units based on the 40 mm edge, allowing them to pack all their attacks in a narrow frontage, with two units being able to combine their attacks onto a single enemy unit. Once two units have exchanged blows the number of hits are totalled. The loser with the lowest total hits is forced to fall back, while the winner has the option to stand, pursue or fall back. Fights may continue, even against multiple enemy units in succession, until one side is destroyed or the attacker does not wish to pursue the enemy.

==Warmaster Ancients gameplay==
Even before Warmaster Ancients were published, there had been attempts to use the fantasy rules for purely historical armies. However, they had significant drawbacks – cavalry under the fantasy rules were too powerful, skirmishers too weak and some historical troop types were not catered for at all.

The gameplay for Warmaster Ancients follows the same basic procedure as Warmaster Fantasy, but differs in the following way:

*Magic, dragons and other such are naturally not present in this rule set (although historical large creatures, such as elephants, are present in some armies).
*Units may only receive three consecutive orders.
*Combat is limited to two exchanges, unlike the fantasy version, where units may continue to attack as long as they have valid targets in range. This allows players to reinforce their troops under attack.
*There are special rules for many historical unit types. Units based on the 20 mm edge are designated as &quot;shock troops&quot; and include heavy cavalry, elephants and phalanges using pikes – their greater hitting power is offset by their shorter frontage which opens them to outflanking. Among the most important new troop types are skirmishers, mobile light troops that can evade an enemy charge and can be used to delay an enemy advance.

==Spin-offs for other periods==
Quite a few rulesets have been written using the basic Warmaster mechanics.
* Battle of the Five Armies - covering the conflicts from Tolkien&#x27;s Middle Earth.
* Warmaster Ancients - covering ancient and Dark Ages historical periods.
* Warmaster Medieval - covering the medieval period.
* Blitzkrieg Commander - covering World War II
* Cold War Commander - covering post-war to modern periods (derived from Blitzkrieg Commander).
* Future War Commander - covering near-future and sci-fi (derived from Blitzkrieg Commander).

<text>The University of Hradec Králové (in Czech &quot;Univerzita Hradec Králové&quot;, UHK; in Latin &quot;Universitas Reginaegradecensis&quot;) is a public university in Hradec Králové, Czech Republic, founded on 21 June 2000. It traces its roots back to 1959. The university has about 6,000 students, and the current rector is Jan Kříž.

==History==

The university&#x27;s precursor institution, the Institute of Education in Hradec Králové, was established in 1959, to train teachers for elementary level education, until then educated in high schools. In 1964, the institution developed into the Faculty of Education Hradec Králové. Training for all education levels began after a higher education reform in Czechoslovakia in 1976.
After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, some former staff from before 1968 returned to the faculty. In 1992 the Pedagogical University of Hradec Králové was officially established. On 15 February 1993, the university started expanding and a new Faculty of Management and Information Technologies was added, subsequently renamed the Faculty of Informatics and Management in 2000, the same year as the University of Hradec Králové was adopted as the official name.

On 1 September 2005, university added a third faculty, the Faculty of Arts, later known as the Philosophical Faculty. On 1 September 2010, after the transformation of the Faculty of Education, the Faculty of Science was formed.

==Campus==
The university currently consists of four faculties: the Faculty of Education, Faculty of Informatics and Management, Philosophical Faculty, and
Faculty of Science, all based on one campus known as &quot;Na Soutoku&quot;.

The university&#x27;s Common Education Building was awarded by Czech architects as the &quot;Building of Year&quot; in 1998. The adjacent building of the Faculty of Informatics and Management was completed in 2008, costing 360 million CZK. Next to that is the Faculty of Science, built in 2016. Construction took 21 months and the cost was approximately 450 million CZK.

Since 2020, there is an ongoing reconstruction of the Philosophical Faculty building. The faculty is temporarily located on Vít Nejedlý Street during the work. Revitalisation of the Faculty of Education is scheduled to begin in 2021. The university also plans to build a facility specialised in natural and social sciences with laboratories, which will enclose the center of the campus.
UHK has two halls of residence, the Palach Halls of Residence (&quot;Palachovy koleje&quot;), and Vít Nejedlý Halls of Residence (&quot;Koleje Víta Nejedlého&quot;), with a capacity of around 900 beds. The Palach Halls of Residence are under ongoing renovation.

==Management==
* Rector: Jan Kříž
* Vice-Rector for International Affairs: Leona Stašová
* Vice-Rector for Student Affairs, Quality, and Creative Activities: František Vaníček
* Vice-Rector for Science, Research, and Knowledge Transfer: Kamil Kuča
* Vice-Rector for Strategy, Development, and Digitalization: Michal Strobach

==Symbols==

The Rector&#x27;s Sceptre, designed by Jan Hásek, is in the shape of a linden leaf, with a golden ball in the centre, and a silver lion at the top, symbolising the city of Hradec Králové. The sceptre was given to the university by the City of Hradec Králové.

The Statutory emblem consists of a central crowned Czech lion, looking heraldically left and holding in its forepaws a large letter &quot;G&quot;. The figure also represents a part of the City of Hradec Králové emblem. In the circular inscription, the full title of the university is written in Latin.

<text>Guthrie is an unincorporated town and census-designated place (CDP) in and the county seat of King County in the U.S. state of Texas. It is in the northern part of the state, east of Lubbock and west of Wichita Falls. It serves as the principal headquarters of the Four Sixes Ranch. As of the 2020 census, its population was 151, down from 160 at 2010.

==History==
Guthrie&#x27;s recorded history begins in 1883, when the Louisville Land and Cattle Company in Louisville, Kentucky, purchased several hundred acres in what later became King County. Named after Louisville Land and Cattle stockholder W.H. Guthrie, the community&#x27;s townsite was platted in 1891 by Andrew Chester Tackitt (son of Rev. Pleasant Tackitt, who had built Guthrie&#x27;s first residence). When King County was organized that same year, Louisville Land and Cattle proposed the platting of a company townsite, to be named &quot;Ashville&quot;, to serve as the county&#x27;s seat. Tackitt strongly opposed this proposition and led a charge to bring the seat to Guthrie, instead. Tackitt&#x27;s hotly contested campaign ultimately proved successful, and he not only succeeded in making Guthrie the county seat, but was also elected to serve as King County&#x27;s first county judge. Late in 1891, the Guthrie post office opened to the public.

The next year, Tackitt and a man by the name of Charlie Bradford brought in lumber from the neighboring community of Seymour and constructed Guthrie&#x27;s first school, a small, one-room building. A larger school followed in 1895, though the lone teacher continued to depend upon schools in Seymour and Benjamin for curriculum. Proprietor John Gibson began to keep a stock of school books at his Guthrie general store in 1897, decreasing the school&#x27;s dependence upon other districts.

In 1904, Guthrie claimed 101 residents, and though hurt by the effects of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, remained stable through to the mid-20th century, with the 1950 Census also reporting 101 residents. In 1959, schools in nearby Dumont were consolidated with Guthrie&#x27;s schools, and by 1963, its population had more than doubled to 210.

The mid- to late 1960s brought an end to Guthrie&#x27;s growth; the population had fallen to 125 by 1970. It increased to 140 in 1980 and 160 in 1990, a figure it maintained through to the 2010 census. Being a company town, very few homes in Guthrie are privately owned; most residents live in housing provided by the 6666 (Four Sixes) or Pitchfork ranches, or the school district.

==Geography==
Guthrie is located in west-central King County, on the north side of the South Wichita River. U.S. Route 82 passes through the western side of the community, and U.S. Route 83 passes through the center of Guthrie.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Guthrie CDP has an area of , of which , or 0.06%, is covered by water.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Guthrie has a humid subtropical climate, denoted as &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps, though it closely borders a cool semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;).

Guthrie has a USDA hardiness zone of 7b, with minimum temperatures ranging from .

==Demographics==
Guthrie was designated as a census designated place in the 2010 U.S. Census.

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 151 people, 63 households, and 50 families residing in the CDP.

==Education==
Guthrie is served by the Guthrie Common School District, which consistently ranks as a &quot;recognized&quot; school district by the Texas Education Agency.

==Notable person==
* Max Williams - basketball player and coach; lived in Guthrie as a child.

==In popular culture==
Author Mitch Cullin graduated from Guthrie School in 1986, and while the setting of his early writings was often the town of Claude in Armstrong County, Cullin said in interviews that his novels &quot;Whompyjawed&quot; and &quot;Branches&quot; were based on Guthrie.

<doc id="1082759" wikidata="Q482472" url="?curid=1082759" title="School Rumble">
<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Jin Kobayashi. It was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; from October 2002 to July 2008, with its chapters collected in 22 volumes. &quot;Magazine Special&quot; published &quot;School Rumble Z&quot; monthly from August 2008 to May 2009, with its chapters collected in a single volume. &quot;School Rumble&quot; is a romance comedy centering on relationships between Japanese high school students. The story focuses on a love triangle involving the series&#x27; two protagonists, Tenma Tsukamoto and Kenji Harima, and one of their classmates, Oji Karasuma. The series often discards realism in favor of comedic effect.

&quot;School Rumble&quot;″s popularity has resulted in its adaptation into multiple forms of media. TV Tokyo broadcast a 26-episode anime program between October 2004 and April 2005. In December 2005, a two-part original video animation (OVA) entitled &quot;School Rumble: Extra Class&quot; was released. A second season, &quot;School Rumble: 2nd Semester&quot;, aired between April and September 2006. Finally, two more episodes, collectively entitled &quot;School Rumble: Third Semester&quot;, were released in 2008. Three video games have been produced, two light novels, and four official guidebooks.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

In North America, Del Rey Manga published the English translation of the first 16 volumes of &quot;School Rumble&quot; in physical format. In the translation, Del Rey Manga maintained the traditional Japanese name order to preserve puns based on the characters&#x27; names. Kodansha USA published the English translation in digital format. Funimation published the first and second anime seasons and the &quot;Extra Class&quot; OVAs in English.

The manga was well received by Japanese-language readers; several volumes have appeared in the top manga sales charts. The North American English translations were less popular, but still ranked several times in the top 100 as well as ranking 145th for overall manga series sales in 2008. Critics of the English-language translation have been positive overall, praising Kobayashi for his art style and overall use of humor. However, the manga has received some criticism, mostly centered on some of the jokes and repetitive plot. The anime adaptation also sold well in Japan and was praised by Kobayashi and—for the English-language translation—critics. The decision by Media Factory to aggressively pursue its intellectual property rights for &quot;School Rumble&quot; is believed by proponents of fansubs to have had a negative impact on the franchise&#x27;s release and sales in the North American market.

==Plot==

&quot;School Rumble&quot; revolves around the daily lives of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School, along with their friends and families. Tenma Tsukamoto, a cheerful yet unremarkable second-year high school student, has an obsessive crush on her eccentric, enigmatic classmate, Oji Karasuma. Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Karasuma, not only because he is listless and borderline-antisocial, but also because his only fulfillment comes in eating curry. Unbeknownst to her, Tenma herself has an admirer, Kenji Harima. A recovering truant and delinquent, Harima attends school solely to get close to her, and even begins creatively expressing himself as a manga artist, but he has similar difficulty declaring his love due to Tenma&#x27;s dimwittedness and single-minded ambition, and whenever he summons the courage to do so, circumstances and his own bumbling conspire against him. Many of these instances, also result in Harima finding himself in mutually embarrassing situations with one of Tenma&#x27;s best friends, Eri Sawachika, causing the two to form a tense relationship. Eri, the richest and most coveted girl in her grade who lives a duplicitous lifestyle and yearns for companionship that her father is unable to provide, finds Harima initially to be a creep as a result of these situations; however, they end up becoming unlikely friends, and Eri finds herself falling in love with him, although she frivolously denies this. The series predominantly revolves around Tenma and Harima&#x27;s ill-fated attempts to confess their feelings, and how they each grow as people in spite of their failures. 

In addition to the four main characters, numerous other characters also have their own side adventures and romances. This includes Tenma and Eri&#x27;s other best friends, Mikoto Suou and Akira Takano. While Akira - an extremely perceptive yet mischievous girl - largely stays out of all potential romantic drama, Mikoto, an athletic and friendly girl who attends a kenpo dojo, yearns for an upperclassman until he goes off to college and develops a relationship with a girl there. However, this belies the mutual affection she holds for her childhood friend and classmate, the uptight class representative Haruki Hanai, whose father runs the dojo. Similarly, Hanai is romantically obsessed with Tenma&#x27;s younger sister, Yakumo Tsukamoto, a first-year at Yagami. In contrast to Tenma, Yakumo is mild-mannered, tall in stature, and highly talented, which soon causes her to supplant Eri as the school idol. However, Yakumo&#x27;s timidness and androphobia cause her to avoid most men until she meets Harima, who she does not get any romantic vibes from due to his sole desire for Tenma, and ironically ends up falling for him as a result, which ends up causing Hanai and an oblivious Harima to develop a rivalry as well as Eri and Yakumo. 

Although Harima manages to engineer romantic encounters with Tenma, her relationship with Karasuma nevertheless progresses, and Harima&#x27;s bonds with Eri and Yakumo grow stronger. Eventually Tenma musters the courage to confess her love, but while he reciprocates, shortly after Karasuma loses his memory. His amnesia gives a purpose to Tenma&#x27;s life; she concentrates on her studies to become a doctor and help Karasuma, half-heartedly turning down Harima at their graduation ceremony as a result. Epilogue chapters following the manga&#x27;s conclusion, predominantly in the &quot;parallel comedy&quot; &quot;School Rumble Z&quot;, reveal events that happen in the adult lives of the characters. Karasuma still suffers from memory loss but is in a relationship with Tenma; additionally, Mikoto marries Hanai and Harima marries Eri, with the former couple expecting a child and the latter couple presenting their own child to Tenma and Yakumo.

==Development and production==
Jin Kobayashi began writing &quot;School Rumble&quot;, his debut work, in 2002. He stated to an audience at Honolulu&#x27;s 2006 Kawaii Kon convention that he started writing the series because he found the idea of a manga involving a delinquent falling in love interesting. Kobayashi&#x27;s favorite character, Kenji Harima, is based largely on an amalgam of various friends, although he estimates &quot;about 30%&quot; of Harima is a reflection of himself. However, despite putting most of his personal feelings into the female characters, he stated that Ryuuhei Suga, a minor supporting character, is the most autobiographical. Most of the other characters are based on memories of former high-school classmates; Kobayashi recalled that he had no real idea of their voices when drawing them, and it was not until much later, when he heard the voice actors&#x27; interpretations during the production of the anime series, that he knew how they should sound. He acknowledged that some characters are more developed than others; in reply to a fan question about the mysterious Akira Takano, he admitted that, despite the closeness he feels for her, he did not put much emphasis on Takano and planned to develop her love-life slowly. Kobayashi intentionally centered his story arcs around misunderstandings which he then resolves, since he believes &quot;if there&#x27;s no misunderstanding then there&#x27;s no funny story.&quot; He claims that none of his stories are based on real-life events, although when pressed admits the possibility of some resemblances but without divulging specific details.

Kobayashi and his editors collaborated on the plotlines. Kobayashi would then draw the basic illustrations for each chapter before passing his material to assistants to finish. As the series&#x27; manga artist, Kobayashi also designed the cover art. Originally, the fifth volume&#x27;s front cover was to feature Akira Takano, but after re-reading the volume Kobayashi concluded that since much of its plot in that volume revolves around Karen Ichijo, she should be on the cover instead. Desiring to feature a male character, he placed Harima on the cover of volume six. Kobayashi designed a poster to commemorate the ending of the series with the final chapter of &quot;School Rumble Z&quot;.

An anime adaptation of the series was never envisaged by Kobayashi, and he was skeptical of the project when first approached. Negotiations and preparation took some time, but he claims to be happy with the result. On viewing the first anime footage, Kobayashi was astonished; he recalls in an interview his emotions at the time, stating &quot;I was incredibly touched by it. Completely overcome.&quot; Impressed with the adaptation of his work, he praises the anime staff for their achievement, although conceding that &quot;School Rumble&quot; probably lent itself to the anime format. He cites the fishing episode, for which he supplied the voice acting for several minor parts, as his favorite.

Kobayashi allowed the voice actors who voiced his characters significant freedom to interpret them as they chose. There were a number of cast changes throughout the production; Ami Koshimizu, the voice actress for Tenma, had initially auditioned for the role of Yakumo, and between &quot;School Rumble&quot;″s first and second seasons the voice actors for both Karen Ichijo and Yoko Sasakura were replaced. Mako Sakurai took over Karen&#x27;s role from Yuuka Nanri, and Aya Hirano replaced Akiko Kurumado as Yoko.

The artbox design for Funimation&#x27;s North American release of the &quot;School Rumble&quot; anime resembles a miniature metal locker, and each of the individually released DVDs comes with heavy duty magnets. The discs include subtitled interviews with the Japanese voice actors, which were compiled onto a third DVD for the full first season release. In 2007, Funimation ran a drawing contest prior to releasing the anime in North America. The grand prize included a new computer with software for developing anime and manga. The United Kingdom anime release by Revelation Films saw the same limited edition box as Funimation, along with two standard editions.

In 2009, Kobayashi said &quot;&quot;School Rumble&quot; is an important piece that I want to draw more, but I wanted to do more other things so I ended it. When I have some time, I would like to draw their adult days in a magazine.&quot;

==Media==
===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Jin Kobayashi, &quot;School Rumble&quot; debuted in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; on October 23, 2002, and finished on July 23, 2008. It further appeared in issues of &quot;Shōnen Magazine&quot;″s &quot;Magazine Special&quot;, and comprised one chapter of the seasonal . Kodansha collected its chapters in 22 volumes, released from May 16, 2003, to September 17, 2008. Another series, &quot;School Rumble Z&quot;, was serialized in &quot;Magazine Special&quot; from August 20, 2008, to May 20, 2009. Concluding the series, a compiled volume was released on June 17, 2009. A special chapter of the manga was published on &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; on November 30, 2016.

As a guide to the contents of each chapter, musical notations were added before the chapter number. In &quot;School Rumble&quot;, chapters marked with a sharp sign (♯) concern the main plot development focusing around Tenma and Harima, while side stories dealing with supporting characters are indicated by a flat sign (♭). The one exception to this pattern in the first series is the chapter that appears in &quot;Shōnen Magazine Wonder&quot;, which uses the natural sign (♮). &quot;School Rumble Z&quot; uses the natural sign for every chapter. The manga volumes of &quot;School Rumble&quot; contain original bonus chapters that use no musical notation; these are normally one page in length, but the seventh volume spreads its bonus chapter over several pages with each page telling a self-contained story.

Del Rey Manga, in North America, and Tanoshimi in the United Kingdom licensed &quot;School Rumble&quot; for an English-language release. It has also been translated into other languages, although the German-language release which Tokyopop initially published was cancelled and later continued by Egmont Manga &amp; Anime. Del Rey released the first English-language volume on February 28, 2006, and the latest—volumes 14-16 in an omnibus—on July 27, 2010. Following Kodansha&#x27;s lead, the Del Rey translation places the main plot chapters first followed by the side stories. Del Rey also retained the Japanese naming order to preserve puns and humor involving the names of the characters. The manga ceased to be published in North America after Del Rey became defunct. Kodansha released 13 volumes of the manga digitally on iTunes on July 26, 2016. As of August 2017, all 22 volumes of the main series have been published digitally in English by Kodansha.

===Anime===

TV Tokyo adapted the &quot;School Rumble&quot; manga for two 26-episode television sketch show series, and five additional episodes. The first season was broadcast in Japan from October 10, 2004 to March 29, 2005, followed by two original video animation (OVA) episodes entitled , which were released on December 22, 2005. The second season, , ran from April 2 to September 24, 2006.

Although a third series——was drawn up in the form of 24 episode synopses, the series was never animated. Instead a two-episode mini-series was released as episodes 25 and 26 of &quot;School Rumble: Third Semester&quot;. The first 24 episodes follow the manga&#x27;s storyline between the end of &quot;School Rumble: 2nd Semester&quot; and the &quot;Third Semester&quot; mini-series; the promotional videos of the mini-series on the anime&#x27;s website instead of previews of a new season confirmed that the remaining 24 episodes would not be animated. The &quot;School Rumble: Third Semester&quot; episodes were released with special editions of volumes 21 and 22 of the &quot;School Rumble&quot; manga, the first on July 17 and the second on September 17, 2008.

&quot;School Rumble&quot;, &quot;School Rumble: 2nd Semester&quot;, and &quot;School Rumble: Extra Class&quot; were later licensed for an English-language audience by Funimation in North America, Madman Entertainment in Australasia and the first three volumes of season one by Revelation Films in the United Kingdom. On September 1, 2009 Funimation re-released &quot;School Rumble: First Semester&quot; and &quot;Extra class&quot; as a compilation. &quot;2nd Semester&quot; was re-released as an entire season with a new rating of TV-MA. The anime has also been released in other languages, and Funimation have made several dubbed episodes of &quot;School Rumble&quot; and &quot;School Rumble: 2nd Semester&quot; available as streaming content on the Internet. The Funimation Channel began airing the first season of &quot;School Rumble&quot; on September 1, 2008.&quot;School Rumble: 2nd Semester&quot; and the &quot;Extra Class&quot; OVA has also aired on the Funimation Channel. The 2008&#x27;s Future Film Festival in Bologna, Italy screened &quot;School Rumble: 2nd Semester&quot;.

The anime&#x27;s first season focuses on Tenma, Harima, and Karasuma, and Harima&#x27;s relationships with other females including Sawachika and Yakumo. Its second season involves more of the secondary cast. The &quot;Extra Class&quot; OVAs are compiled from various first season storylines. Both the &quot;Third Semester&quot; synopses and episodes return to the main cast. The anime&#x27;s structure has been compared to &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;, with thematic influences from &quot;Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu&quot;. In places it makes deliberate use of unconventional nomenclature; the title of episode 25 of season one is a set of pictograms, while episode 26&#x27;s title has 187 characters in the Japanese original. In season two, the Japanese title for episode 26 consists of just a period.
The narrative of the &quot;School Rumble&quot; anime is designed to mirror that of the manga, which results in multiple short story segments with no significant connection. Shown from the perspective of its characters—notably Tenma and Harima as they attempt similar ploys to get their crush to notice their affection—the anime uses absurdist humor which often combines elements of popular culture to explore the love-triangle, with jokes that work on multiple levels. One such example, highlighted by Lisa Marie, reviewer for Anime Today, is the bike chase scene in episode 1 of season one. She notes that while anyone can appreciate the chase&#x27;s inherent humor, those familiar with &quot;Initial D&quot; will find another level of appreciation that nevertheless does not interfere with viewers who do not catch the deeper reference. Lisa Marie comments &quot;I certainly admit watching an insane bike chase cross paths with &quot;Initial D&quot;″s famous AE86 has a bit more when you know why there&#x27;s a cheesily rendered race car in slow moving Eurobeat.&quot;

===Music===

Two anime soundtracks and five maxi single albums based on the anime&#x27;s opening and closing themes have been released, with all but the second season&#x27;s closing theme having both a regular and limited edition. In addition, three two-disc drama CDs and three radio dramas have been released on CD. Eight image albums—one for each of the main characters—have also been released, in both a regular and limited edition run.

On December 5, 2004, Yokohama BLITZ held a concert entitled , featuring the voice acting cast of &quot;School Rumble&quot;. The event was released on DVD on March 24, 2005. Announced around the time of the Japanese release of volume 15, from July 21 through July 25, 2005 a stage play called recapping Season 1 of &quot;School Rumble&quot; was performed. It was released on DVD on October 10, 2005. Unicorn Table, the soundtrack artists for &quot;School Rumble&quot;, performed songs from the anime from December 7–9, 2007 at the New York Anime Festival, and again on April 26, 2008 at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York for the Tora-Con anime convention.

===Other===

Three video games based on &quot;School Rumble&quot; have been developed and released in Japan. Marvelous Entertainment published the first game for the entitled on July 21, 2005. It was later reissued on August 10, 2006, as a &quot;The Best&quot; range budget release. Marvelous Entertainment released a second game, entitled on July 20, 2006, also for the PlayStation 2. The story revolves around the &quot;School Rumble&quot; cast hearing a rumor of treasure hidden within a mansion. Two versions were produced; a regular and a limited edition, the latter of which included a drama CD, memorial album, and a special box with variant cover art. On June 28, 2007, this game was also re-released as a &quot;Best Collection&quot;. , published on July 7, 2005 for the PlayStation Portable by Bandai. It has an original story based around Karasuma suffering a sudden collapse. Although the story centers on Tenma, the player can take the perspective of other characters to obtain clues for solving the mystery.

&quot;School Rumble&quot; has been the basis of two light novels and four guidebooks. The light novels, and , were written by Hiroko Tokita and illustrated by Jin Kobayashi and published in April 2004 and December 2007 respectively. They were later translated by Tong Li Comics into Traditional Chinese. Jin Kobayashi and his editors also wrote and illustrated four official guidebooks for the series: &quot;School Rumble: Private File&quot;, &quot;School Rumble: Official File&quot;, &quot;School Rumble: Pleasure File&quot;, and &quot;School Rumble: Treasure File&quot;.

&quot;School Rumble&quot; has spawned much merchandise featuring its characters, including T-shirts and figurines.

==Controversies==
===Fansubs===
In 2004, &quot;School Rumble&quot;″s Japanese license holder, Media Factory, declared its titles off-limits to fan-made subtitled translations—a practice known as fansubbing. The directory website AnimeSuki later removed all links to fansubs of Media Factory&#x27;s work in response to a cease-and-desist notice issued by the license holder, although fansub group Wannabe Fansubs continued their fansubbing regardless. Media Factory-owned anime has been the subject of debate over the validity of fansubbing practice. Proponents believe &quot;School Rumble&quot; would have more quickly received an English license had fansubs been allowed to circulate more freely, generating viewer interest.

===Taiwanese television station fine===
On January 19, 2012, the Taiwanese children&#x27;s channel Momo Kids TV was reported to have received a fine of NT$600,000 (about $20,333 in U.S. currency) for broadcasting an episode of &quot;School Rumble&quot; on December 26, which according to parental complaints contained &quot;high school students watching a pornographic movie together&quot;, along with &quot;a scene of jiggling breasts&quot; and &quot;actors moaning in pornographic movies.&quot; However, it is worth noting that the show has aired on various international Cartoon Network stations without controversy.

==Sales==
The &quot;School Rumble&quot; manga had a successful sales run in Japan and the North American English market. In Japan, several volumes managed to chart: Volume 13 was the ninth best-selling manga for the week of June 21, 2006, before falling to tenth the following week; Volume 15 reached 4th place for the week of December 20, also falling to 10th the following week; and Volume 17 came 7th for the week of June 20, 2007, subsequently dropping to 9th. &quot;School Rumble Z&quot; ranked 18th for the week of June 15, 2009. Del Rey&#x27;s North American translation sold well, although not quite as well as in Japan. Volume 3 was ranked 99th in September 2006; volume 4 was 96th in December; volume 5 was 98th in April 2007; volume 12 was 141st in November 2008; and volume 12 was 169th in May 2009. Overall the series ranked as the 145th best-selling English translated manga series for 2008.

Similarly, the anime adaptation of &quot;School Rumble&quot; also sold very well in Japan according to the Oricon charts. The Japanese DVD release of &quot;First Semester&quot; saw fluctuating sales for each volume with each charting within the top 45. have the best showings at five times at 15 and twice at 17 respectively, while the final three were the least successful with volume 8 being the lowest ranking twice at 45. While the &quot;2nd Semester&quot; continued to sell well, overall sales did not chart as well as the previous season. Most of the DVDs ranked in the range from 50s to 70s and all of them ranked just twice. Volume 1 ranked the best at 41, followed by volume 4 at 49; volume 6 ranked lowest at 100.
The &quot;Extra Class&quot; OVA also ranked once at 66.

The DVD of the voice actor&#x27;s live performance, &quot;come! come! well-come Party&quot;, ranked once at 177 on Oricon charts.

==Reception==
===Manga===
Although generally well-received, the manga has also attracted some criticism. Eduardo M. Chavez, of Mania.com, recalls being initially put off by the title, which for him conjured images of battles more physical than emotional. After glancing through the first volume, he was surprised to find his assumption wrong, and concluded that it was appropriately named. While he gives a largely positive review, Chavez finds the series&#x27; artwork &quot;simple&quot; and unimpressive. He notes that the first volume becomes slightly repetitive, so praises the way that Kobayashi introduces new themes to the second, bringing variety to the setting. Remarking on Kobayashi&#x27;s ability to draw on numerous influences, Chavez applauds the manga artist for finding fresh ways of using old themes, preventing &quot;School Rumble&quot; from becoming derivative. He reserves his highest praise for the &quot;flat&quot; chapters dealing with Yakumo. In the next two volumes Chavez approves of the mixture of comedy and romance and the way the characters &quot;grow up&quot;, although acknowledging that while the manga&#x27;s style suits his personal preferences it will not be to everyone&#x27;s taste. Jason Thompson in &quot;&quot; criticises jokes as &quot;predictable&quot; and gives the manga 2 stars of 5.

Sakura Eries, also of Mania.com, gave volumes five, six, and eight to eleven positive ratings overall. She noted that volume five may appeal to readers more interested in the side characters, and that appreciating Kobayashi&#x27;s humor in the second half of chapter eight &quot;requires a bit more mental effort&quot;. In volume ten, she remarks that while Kobayashi borrows the oft-used cliché of a disastrous school play, he manages to add enough twists to make it unique. The play&#x27;s climax, however, confused her more than it amused her.

Carlo Santos, of Anime News Network, gave the English releases of volumes two, three, four, and seven mixed—but largely favorable—B-range reviews. Volume nine he awards a C rating. He approved of the character of Harima, particularly enjoying jokes comparing him to St. Francis of Assisi. Santos found the bonus chapters in volumes three and four, that deal with Yakumo, touching. On the other hand, he criticizes various aspects of the artwork and, by volume seven, laments the staleness of recycled jokes. Despite volume nine&#x27;s strong start, by its end he relates that, although there were some funny moments, he had become weary of its repetitive plot. A fellow reviewer from Anime News Network, Carl Kimlinger, decided after reviewing four volumes that while the early volumes do not assist plot development, neither do they detract from the manga&#x27;s appeal; he too had a positive impression overall. Kimlinger found the later volumes better and more entertaining, although not always during the romantic moments.

Chavez praised Del Rey&#x27;s translation for retaining the manga&#x27;s original identity; the header, bumper artwork, character biographies, and front covers are all but identical to the Japanese. Eries also thanked Del Rey&#x27;s translation notes for clearing up some misconceptions for her, although she later concluded that their quality has deteriorated as the series progresses.

Aka Akasaka, the original creator of &quot;Kaguya-sama: Love Is War&quot;, has revealed that he was inspired by &quot;School Rumble&quot; to create &quot;Kaguya-sama&quot;.

===Anime===
Like the manga, the anime has been well received but does not avoid criticism; in particular the quality of the animation for both seasons, including the OVAs, has attracted mixed reviews. Some of the humor and romantic elements have been derided while the English dubbing and soundtrack have been universally praised. Most reviewers took the position that, even if they dislike certain elements, the series as a whole contains something that makes them want to see more; a view summed up by Chris Beveridge of Mania.com, who writes:

Beveridge cautioned that because the anime was designed around the non-linear format of the manga, its transitions might at first be troublesome for the viewer, but by the final volume finds the anime in all its aspects far superior.

While &quot;School Rumble&quot; is generally recognised as a shōnen title targeting the young male market, Katherine Luther, staff reviewer for About.com, refers to it as a shōjo title aimed at girls and young women. Lisa Marie, reviewer for RightStuf&#x27;s &quot;Anime Today&quot; podcast, agrees that others, notably males, might see the series as shōjo. Luther calls the first DVD &quot;the perfect back-to-school accessory&quot;, while Marie characterizes &quot;School Rumble&quot; as &quot;insane&quot;, asserting it appears on the surface more laid back than other titles like &quot;Excel Saga&quot; and &quot;Haré + Guu&quot;. However, it uses its &quot;cast to break...every rule of reality, but it plays everything so straight [that] it takes you a moment to realize what just happened doesn&#x27;t make any sense.&quot; A fan of the subgenre, she praises the anime it for its surreal humour, and for being &quot;anime newbie friendly&quot; in that its jokes work on multiple levels. Not all are of Japanese origin—such as a reference to the long triangular resolution of Star Wars &quot;&#x27;Return of the Jedi&quot;—giving the series broad appeal.

Anime News Network&#x27;s reviewers found much to enjoy about the first series, although Theron Martin warns that the first DVD should be &quot;watched in small doses, as trying to tackle too much of it in one sitting will elevate the suicide rate of your brain cells&quot;. Carl Kimlinger comments that &quot;from the moment the words &#x27;School Rumble&#x27; come spinning onto the screen, you know you&#x27;re in for ... undiluted good times&quot;, and that the title is &quot;two of the greatest animation non-sequiturs you&#x27;re likely to see anytime soon&quot;. Carlo Santos praises volume six&#x27;s bizarre comedy, but laments its romantic elements as being too generic. Overall, his rating is mediocre, saying that &quot;although this disc technically marks the end of [the first season of] &quot;School Rumble&quot;, it&#x27;s really more of a pause, seeing as how the last few episodes simply ride along with the plot rather than try to reach a dramatic finish&quot;. Reviewers from Mania.com followed this pattern; Dani Moure was skeptical of the series&#x27; long-term entertainment value, but like fellow reviewer Danielle Van Gorder, found his early indifference fading as the story develops. IGN&#x27;s Jeff Harris, N.S. Davidson, and David F. Smith gave mostly positive reviews, although Davidson believes the audio and extras had begun to wane by volume five. Jakub Lhota of Reanimated rated the first season an 8/10, stating that he enjoyed it more than some other anime series he had previously watched, and the style—if not always the color—of Funimation&#x27;s metallic locker artbox for &quot;School Rumble&quot;″s English translation of the first season was welcomed.

According to Theron Martin, the OVA series &quot;School Rumble: Extra Class&quot; was made mostly for devoted fans; claiming that familiarity with the series is almost a necessity before watching it, although he later came to the view that it may also be useful as a sampler of the series. Chris Beveridge gives the OVA series an overall negative review. He did not highlight a single specific reason, instead observing that although all elements that &quot;make the TV series enjoyable are certainly present here, they just feel weaker&quot;. However, it did make him want to watch more of the television series, thus serving its intended purpose in keeping interest in the series alive. Katherine Luther endorsed the view that viewers need to be familiar with the story, but reviewed the OVA positively. While she noted lulls in the action, she believes fans will be able to overlook this. Unlike Martin, Luther did not believe the OVA is a good introduction to &quot;School Rumble&quot;, due to its short sequences and seemingly random nature.

Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network declined to post commentary on the preview announcement for the second season, claiming &quot;we assume if you loved &quot;School Rumble&quot;, you&#x27;re gonna check out the sequel regardless of what anyone says, so why bother reviewing it?&quot; David F. Smith from IGN gave the first part of season two a rating of 6/10, with lower scores for the Funimation extras and higher ones for the plot and story. Specifically, Smith praised the anime for never taking itself seriously, and the studio for not cutting its budget for sight gags—something he notes that other companies do. Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found the second season funny and nonrepetitive, and Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network praised the second season for not conforming to the conventions of reality. She complimented it for focusing more on the other students and their relationships than on the main love triangle. Chris Beveridge claimed that, although it comes across well, the season should not be watched in a marathon sitting. He was more critical of Funimation&#x27;s packaging, preferring the first season&#x27;s metal locker boxart to the packing for the half-season sets.

<text>Fergana (, ), () or Ferghana, also Farghana is a district-level city and the capital of Fergana Region in eastern Uzbekistan. Fergana is about 320 km east of Tashkent, about 75 km southwest of Andijan, and less than 20 km from the Kyrgyzstan border. The modern city was founded in 1876.

== History ==

Fergana first appears in written records in the 5th-century. However, archeological evidence demonstrates that the city had been populated since the Chalcolithic period. Like many other Central Asian places in the sixth and seventh-centuries, Fergana was ruled by the Western Turkic Khaganate. Although it was still predominantly inhabited by eastern Iranians, many Turks had also started to settle there. The city of Fergana was refounded in 1876 as a garrison town and colonial appendage to Margilan ( to the northwest) by the Russian Empire.

Fergana Region is one of the centers of ancient culture in Uzbekistan. Photographs of Stone Age settlements and rocks found in the area show that stone tools have been used by people in the valley since ancient times. Excavations of the Great Fergana Canal have played an important role in the study of archaeological monuments in the region. During the excavation of the canal, monuments from the Bronze Age, slavery and land ownership were discovered and studied. Finds from the 5th century BC and early medieval period in the town of Quva are well studied. Historical sources from the 10th to 11th century state that this city was the largest and most prosperous in the valley after Akhsikath. Archaeological materials confirm that the city of Margilan was a large village in the 10th century and took on the appearance of a hamlet in the 11th and 12th centuries.

The monuments found in the settlements of the Chust culture, engaged in sedentary agriculture and animal husbandry, are important for the study of the Fergana Valley. Archaeological excavations show that the Fergana Region has long been inhabited by people engaged in hunting, farming, animal husbandry, and at later stages of the existence of human society, culture began to develop.

It was initially named New Margelan (), then renamed Skobelov () in 1907 after the first Russian military governor of the Fergana Valley, Mikhail Skobelev. In 1924, after the Soviet Union&#x27;s reconquest of the region from the Basmachi movement, the name was changed to Fergana, after the province of which it was the centre.

During World War I, the city was the location of a Russian prisoner-of-war camp for German and Austro-Hungarian POWs, including ethnic Polish conscripts, many of whom died to typhus.

The industrial base of Fergana was developed in the 20th century. Industry in the city included textile manufacturing and a nitric fertiliser plant. Some of the industrial development was a result of Evacuation in the Soviet Union during World War II.

Fergana has been a center for oil production in the Fergana Valley since the region&#x27;s first oil refinery was built near the city in 1908. Since then, more refineries have been added, and Fergana is one of the most important centers of oil refining in Uzbekistan. Natural gas from western Uzbekistan is transported by pipeline to the valley, where it is used to manufacture fertilizer. The Great Fergana Canal, built almost entirely by hand during the 1930s, passes through the northern part of the city and was completed in 1939. During its construction, the canal and the city were widely photographed by the noted photographer Max Penson. With a western loan Fergana is able to modernize its refinery and also reduce air pollution emissions.

==Climate==
Fergana has a cool arid climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;). Winters are cold and short, with a daily average low temperature of and a daily average high of in January; summers are hot, with an average low temperature of and an average high of in July. Annual precipitation is less than , and most of this falls in winter and spring.

== Population ==

<doc id="1082777" wikidata="Q130728" url="?curid=1082777" title="Street Sharks">
<text>Street Sharks is an American animated television series about the adventures of crime-fighting half-man/half-sharks. It was produced by DIC Productions, L.P. and Bohbot Entertainment, and aired from 1994 to 1997, originally as a part of Bohbot&#x27;s &quot;Amazin&#x27; Adventures&quot; programming block. before moving to ABC for its final season. The show promoted a line of action figures by Mattel. The creators were David Siegel and Joe Galliani of Mr. Joe&#x27;s Really Big Productions.

In 1996, the Street Sharks were paired with the &quot;Dino Vengers&quot; and the show was retitled &quot;Dino Vengers Featuring Street Sharks&quot;. The Dino Vengers would later receive their own short-lived spinoff, where they were renamed the &quot;Extreme Dinosaurs&quot;.

The series features theme music by Michael Benghiat and Lois Blaisch. Additional songs were written by Megan Cavallari and David Goldsmith.

==Plot==
A university professor named Dr. Robert Bolton and his partner Dr. Luther Paradigm create a machine known as the &quot;gene-slammer&quot; which is capable of changing aquatic animals into anthropomorphic hybrids by combining their DNA. In his attempt to prevent Paradigm from using this machine for personal power, Bolton is transformed into an unseen monstrosity, but escapes. Later, Paradigm gives Bolton&#x27;s four sons John, Bobby, Coop, and Clint the likeness of four different sharks. When Dr. Paradigm captures their friend Bends, the resulting &quot;Street Sharks&quot; rescue him and the resulting battle causes Paradigm to be combined with piranha DNA (for which he is often nicknamed &quot;Dr. Piranoid&quot; by other characters). While the Street Sharks are known to enjoy eating hot dogs, hamburgers, and shakes, they have shown a disdain for pizza when they shoot down that suggestion to Bends and Lena Mack.

In subsequent episodes, Dr. Paradigm creates a variety of mutant animals to destroy the Street Sharks while attempting to persuade the inhabitants of their native metropolis of Fission City to imprison them. Of these mutant animals, a few sided with the Sharks themselves: namely Rox, Moby Lick, Mantaman, and El Swordo.

The final few episodes introduced the Dino Vengers: a group of extraterrestrial dinosaurs allied with the Street Sharks against their own rivals in the Raptor Gang. When Dr. Paradigm wanted to get a sample of the Raptors&#x27; DNA to improve himself, they trick him by giving him iguana DNA which transforms him into &quot;Dr. Iguanazoid&quot; leading to him working with the Raptors where they will reward him by correcting the DNA mistake they gave him. In the end, Paradigm is captured and imprisoned while the Raptor Gang leaves Earth.

The Dino Vengers later had their own series called &quot;Extreme Dinosaurs&quot; where they and the Raptors had different backgrounds.

==Characters==
===Bolton family===

* Ripster (voiced by Lee Tockar) – John Bolton is the smartest, the leader, and oldest of the four brothers who enjoys creating inventions. He has taken up most of his knowledge and skills from his father. He is also an avid pool player. In the first episode of the show, John rides a motorbike. When transformed into Ripster, he becomes a great white shark able to bite through steel as well as having extrasensory abilities.
* Jab (voiced by Matt Hill) – Clint Bolton is the laziest of the Street Sharks, but enjoys boxing and appears to have some talent with mechanics. When transformed into Jab, he becomes a hammerhead shark and uses his head as a battering ram.
* Streex (voiced by Andrew Rannells) – Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Bolton Jr. is a level-headed, cool, and self-proclaimed ladies&#x27; man. He is always shown wearing his rollerblades and appears to enjoy parachuting and snowboarding and later plays drums professionally. When transformed into Streex, he becomes a tiger shark named after the purple streaks on his body. In the toyline, he was originally called &quot;Blades&quot; for his skills as a rollerblader.
* Big Slammu (voiced by D. Kevin Williams) – Coop Bolton is the strongest and youngest of the four. He is also a football player in high school. In the first episode, he uses a skateboard. When transformed into Big Slammu, he becomes a whale shark and his most prominent maneuver is the &quot;Seismic Slam&quot; in which he may shake or crack the ground with his fists.
* Dr. Robert Bolton (voiced by D. Kevin Williams) – a university professor and the father of the Bolton Brothers who invents the gene-manipulation device for peaceful uses. He is only seen on-screen in the first episode where he tries to stop Dr. Paradigm&#x27;s experiments only to become changed into an unseen inhuman creature. Afterward, he is only ever represented by a shadow cast on the wall (either as a humanoid or as an animal-like monstrosity). It is suggested through the series that Dr. Bolton secretly assists his sons. The episode &quot;Shark Source&quot; shows him defeating Dr. Piranoid to rescue a kidnapped mutant crocodile. Despite the fact that he helps them, Dr. Bolton is never reunited with his sons, but he does contact his sons through a TV screen where the transmission keeps even the viewers from seeing his current appearance.
* Sir Thomas Bolton - an ancestor of the protagonists who is encountered in the episode &quot;Sir Shark-a-Lot&quot;. He is the target of Paradigm&#x27;s time-travel excursion to destroy the Bolton family.

===Allies===
* Lena Mack (voiced by Pam Carter) – a student of Dr. Paradigm&#x27;s who suspects him of crime and therefore assists the Street Sharks. She is later reduced to a background role and has a younger brother named Malik.
* Bends (voiced by Jim Hoggatt) – Fission University&#x27;s technical genius and a source of comic relief who supplies the Street Sharks with their motorbikes and weapons and conceals them underneath the University&#x27;s ice skating rink. In episode 16, it is revealed that he cannot be mutated by a gene-slamming airborne virus. This genetic trait was passed down to his great, great, great grandson who is a member of the resistance against Dr. Paradigm in an alternate future as seen in &quot;Shark to the Future&quot;.
* Moby Lick – Jets Taylor is a good friend of the Bolton Brothers and Bends. Under Dr. Paradigm&#x27;s mind-control, Jets is combined with a killer whale by Dr. Paradigm in order to make him his latest Seaviate. Becoming Moby Lick, he later broke free of Paradigm&#x27;s mind control and became an ally of the Street Sharks. Moby Lick has a long prehensile tongue (the source of his name), great strength, the ability to inhale water and expel it through his blowhole, and later demonstrated the ability to communicate with other killer whales. In &quot;Shark Hunt&quot;, Moby became an eco-conservationist in the Everglades National Park.
* Rox (voiced by Lee Tockar) – Melvin Kresnik is an up-and-coming musician mistakenly combined with a bull shark who exposes Dr. Paradigm&#x27;s plan to change Kresnik&#x27;s audience into mutants. Thereafter, Rox continues as a rock star by explaining his altered form as a costume and remains a friend of the Sharks. In the toyline, Rox is labelled as a mako shark instead of a bull shark. He was dropped from the series after season two.
* David Horne (voiced by Tony Wike) – the President of the United States. The Street Sharks save him from Dr. Paradigm before he can be &quot;gene washed&quot; like he did with Vice-President Russell. Following this incident, President Horne secretly leaks information to the Street Sharks.
* El Swordo (voiced by Garry Chalk) – a circus performer who worked with a large marlin named Spike. The two were eventually &quot;fused&quot; together by Dr. Paradigm resulting in a combination of memories under the man&#x27;s personality. El Swordo remains active in entertainment as a professional swordsman.
* Mantaman (voiced by D. Kevin Williams) – a flying dinosaur-like alien specimen was found encased in stone by Dr. Terrence &quot;Terry&quot; Morton and reactivated by Dr. Paradigm. Dr. Morton then deliberately gene-slammed himself with a combination of the alien&#x27;s DNA and manta ray DNA to help the Street Sharks fight the original alien. He has a younger brother named Ryan who appears in &quot;Shark Jacked&quot; when he gets captured by Dr. Paradigm. By the end of the episode, Mantaman&#x27;s parents learn of what became of their son and accept his appearance. Around the &quot;Ancient Sharkonauts&quot; episode, Mantaman returns under the control of the Raptors when it was revealed that they were behind the flying dinosaur-like alien whose DNA is part of Mantaman. He is later liberated by the Street Sharks.
* The Dino Vengers – a military unit from an exoplanet inhabited by mutant dinosaurs who later allied with the Street Sharks. Once ordinary members of their race, the four volunteered to receive genetic enhancements that made them far larger and stronger to better combat Bad Rap and his gang of terrorists. 
** T-Bone (voiced by Ian James Corlett) – a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and the leader of the Dino Vengers.
** Stegz (voiced by D. Kevin Williams) – a &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;.
** Bullzeye (voiced by Jason Michas) – a &quot;Pteranodon&quot;.
** Spike (voiced by Garry Chalk) – a &quot;Triceratops&quot;.

===Antagonists===
* Dr. Luther Paradigm/Dr. Paranoid/Dr. Iguanazoid (voiced by J. Michael Lee) – the main antagonist of the series and arch-enemy of the Street Sharks. A professor at Fission City University, he is easily identified by his metal eyepatch and later by a giant yellow robotic exoskeleton, with offensive capabilities including the ability to fire harpoons. In the second episode, Dr. Paradigm is injected with piranha DNA meant for Bends as the Street Sharks nicknamed him Dr. Piranoid. Afterwards, Paradigm&#x27;s face assumes inhuman attributes at moments of strong emotion. When in public, Dr. Paradigm wears a robe to hide his exoskeleton. When Dr. Bolton defeated Dr. Piranoid to rescue a captive mutant crocodile and damaged his armor, it was shown that parts of his body were piranha-like. During episodes featuring the Dino-Vengers, Dr. Paradigm injected himself with iguana DNA which was given to him by the Raptors instead of &quot;Velociraptor&quot; DNA and was renamed Dr. Iguanazoid by the Street Sharks as a result. He has since helped out the Raptors with their plots hoping that they will actually give him &quot;Velociraptor&quot; DNA. By &quot;Shark-apolypse Now!&quot;, Dr. Iguanazoid is apprehended by the Street Sharks.
** SharkBot (voiced by Steve Gibbs) – a product of Dr. Paradigm&#x27;s experimentation with robotics. It was used to free Repteel from prison and frame the Street Sharks for the crime. The Sharks ultimately reprogrammed SharkBot to destroy Paradigm&#x27;s laboratory. SharkBot was later rebuilt into SharkBot 2.0 which fought the Street Sharks until the end of the series&#x27; second season.
** Tentakill – a bipedal creature of unknown origins and species, first seen in the episode &quot;Sir Shark-a-Lot&quot; as Paradigm&#x27;s newest weapon. It is incapable of speech, shows limited intelligence, and was not utilized often.
** Seaviates – a group of mutant sea creatures that serve Dr. Paradigm.
*** Slobster (voiced by D. Kevin Williams) – a lobster injected with the DNA of Genghis Khan and Thomas Blood. He and Slash only appear in season one (although they still appear in the opening credits).
*** Slash (voiced by Terry Berner) – a swordfish injected with the DNA of villains like Genghis Khan and Thomas Blood like Slobster. Thus, he becomes an anthropomorphic swordfish with a drill bit on its nose who speaks in a hissing lisp. Slash is usually defeated by the immobilization of his nasal drill. He and Slobster only appear in season one (although they still appear in the opening credits).
*** Killamari (voiced by D. Kevin Williams) – an anthropomorphic squid that is able to project natural &quot;spears&quot; or &quot;harpoons&quot; from his mouth and the many suckers covering his body. In the episode &quot;Lone Shark&quot;, he almost kills Jab with his venom. Lena and Bends concoct an anti-venom which has since reduced his threat.
*** Repteel (voiced by Tony Wike) – the only one of Dr. Paradigm&#x27;s Seaviates to have originally been human. Mr. Cunneyworth is the aged owner and hotel manager of a run-down hotel accidentally demolished by the Street Sharks during a fight with Dr. Paradigm&#x27;s Seaviates. As he had nowhere else to go, Mr. Cunneyworth willingly allowed Dr. Paradigm to merge his genetic codes with those of a moray eel and an electric eel. As Repteel, he feeds on electricity and shoots miniature eels (also charged with electricity) from his hands and wears a special pack to store energy.
*** Shrimp Louie (voiced by Andrew Rannells) – a mutated shrimp and one of Paradigm&#x27;s later Seaviates, although it is unclear if he was human first or not. He is not very strong, is quite the coward and his primary weapons are big blaster guns. He only appears in seasons 2 and 3.
* Maximillian Greco – an aged mafioso crime boss who blackmails Dr. Paradigm into using the Genetic Engineering Chamber to gene-slam him with the DNA of a rhinoceros (upon its nose-hair samples being obtained) and the DNA of a desert tortoise upon learning of his illegal and secret experiments. This granted Greco with the strength of a rhinoceros and the longevity of a desert tortoise which rejuvenated Greco to half his real age. He later resurfaced as the owner of a casino.
** Zeus and Apollo (vocal effects provided by D. Kevin Williams) – Maximillian Greco&#x27;s pet Chihuahuas. Like their owner, they were also genetically enhanced by Dr. Paradigm which made them larger than normal.
* Malcolm Medusa III (voiced by J. Michael Lee) – a rich businessman and big game hunter who frequently targets endangered animals. The Street Sharks and Moby Lick expose him. In &quot;Shark Hunt&quot;, Malcolm Medusa III traps Moby Lick and the Street Sharks in a hunting enclosure. He is eventually imprisoned in an island prison as he plans his revenge.
** Clammando (voiced by D. Kevin Williams) – a mutant clam who is Malcolm Medusa III&#x27;s right-hand man. He started out as a dock worker for Malcolm Medusa III who fell into a toxic waste part of the water where there were clams in it. As a result upon being fished out by Malcolm, he turned into a mutant clam. In &quot;Shark to the Future&quot;, Clammando&#x27;s appearance was first used as a Seaviate that worked for Dr. Paradigm during the Street Sharks&#x27; visit to the future.
* Dr. Techno-Piranoid (voiced by J. Michael Lee) – a future counterpart of Dr. Paradigm. He is more evil and quite possibly more powerful than the present day version. Dr. Techno-Piranoid first appears in the episode &quot;Shark to the Future&quot; when the Street Sharks visit his timeline where he has taken over the world with an army of Seaviates. In &quot;Shark Wars&quot;, Dr. Techno-Piranoid appears in the present to collaborate with his present day counterpart to make sure an event that led to his future remains intact. Like how Paradigm has SharkBots serving him, this version has MechaSharks as his mechanical army. When the Street Sharks foiled the plot, Dr. Techno-Piranoid vanished when his future was rewritten.
** MechaSharks – Dr. Tecno-Piranoid&#x27;s army of mechanized shark monsters.
* The Raptors – a trio of rogue &quot;Velociraptor&quot;-like criminals who come from the same exoplanet as the Dino Vengers.
** Bad Rap (voiced by Doug Parker) – the leader of the Raptors who has a metal brace-like device on his mouth and a rocket launcher on his right hand.
** Haxx (voiced by Doug Parker) – a Raptor with implants on the backs of each wrist that produce green blades. His tail has been replaced with a blade capable of spinning like a drill.
** Spittor (voiced by Doug Parker) – the scientist and brains of the Raptors. Spittor carries a tank with various liquids released from nozzles on his hands, tail, and mouth.

===Recurring characters===

<text>Seiko Epson Corporation, commonly known as Epson, is a Japanese multinational electronics company and one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturers of printers and information- and imaging-related equipment. Headquartered in Suwa, Nagano, Japan, the company has numerous subsidiaries worldwide and manufactures inkjet, dot matrix, thermal and laser printers for consumer, business and industrial use, scanners, laptop and desktop computers, video projectors, watches, point of sale systems, robots and industrial automation equipment, semiconductor devices, crystal oscillators, sensing systems and other associated electronic components. 

The company has developed as one of manufacturing and research and development (formerly known as Seikosha) of the former Seiko Group, a name traditionally known for manufacturing Seiko timepieces. Seiko Epson was one of the major companies in the Seiko Group, but is neither a subsidiary nor an affiliate of Seiko Group Corporation.

==History==

===Origins===
The roots of Seiko Epson Corporation go back to a company called Daiwa Kogyo, Ltd. which was founded in May 1942 by Hisao Yamazaki, a local clock shop owner and former employee of K. Hattori, in Suwa, Nagano. Daiwa Kogyo was supported by an investment from the Hattori family (founder of the Seiko Group) and began as a manufacturer of watch parts for Daini Seikosha (currently Seiko Instruments). The company started operation in a renovated miso storehouse with 22 employees.

In 1943, Daini Seikosha established a factory in Suwa for manufacturing Seiko watches with Daiwa Kogyo. In 1959, the Suwa Factory was split up and merged into Daiwa Kogyo to form Suwa Seikosha Co., Ltd: the forerunner of the Seiko Epson Corporation. The company has developed many timepiece technologies, such as the world&#x27;s first portable quartz timer (Seiko QC-951) in 1963, the world&#x27;s first quartz watch (Seiko Quartz Astron 35SQ) in 1969, the first automatic power-generating quartz watch (Seiko Auto-Quartz) in 1988, and the Spring Drive watch movement in 1999.

The watch business is the root of the company&#x27;s ultra-precision machining and micromechatronics technologies and still a major business for Seiko Epson, although it accounts for a low percentage of total revenues. Watches made by the company are sold through the Seiko Watch Corporation, a subsidiary of Seiko Group. The watch brand Orient Watch, also known as Orient Star, has been owned by Epson since 2009 and was fully integrated into the company in 2017.

===Printers===

In 1961, Suwa Seikosha established a company called Shinshu Seiki Co. as a subsidiary to supply precision parts for Seiko watches. When Seiko was selected to be the official time keeper for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, a printing timer was required to time events, and Shinshu Seiki started developing an electronic printer.

In September 1968, Shinshu Seiki launched the world&#x27;s first mini-printer, the EP-101 (&quot;EP&quot; for Electronic Printer), which was soon incorporated into many calculators. In June 1975, the name Epson was coined for the next generation of printers based on the EP-101, which was released to the public. The Epson name was coined by joining the initials EP (Electronic Printer) and the word , making &quot;Epson&quot; mean &quot;Electronic Printer&#x27;s Son&quot;. In April of the same year, Epson America Inc. was established to sell printers for Shinshu Seiki Co.
In June 1978, the TX-80 (TP-80), an eighty-column dot matrix printer, was released to the market and was mainly used as a system printer for the Commodore PET computer. After two years of further development, an improved model, the MX-80 (MP-80), was launched in October 1980. It was soon advertised as the best selling printer in the United States. By 1982 Epson reportedly had 75% of the printer market; its products were so beloved that Steve Wozniak joked, &quot;I doubt we&#x27;ll ever bomb Japan as long as they make Epson printers&quot;.

In July 1982, Shinshu Seiki officially named itself the Epson Corporation and launched the world&#x27;s first handheld computer, the HX-20 (HC-20), and in May 1983, the world&#x27;s first portable colour LCD TV was developed and launched by the company.

In November 1985, Suwa Seikosha Co., Ltd. and the Epson Corporation merged to form Seiko Epson Corporation.

The company developed the Micro Piezo inkjet technology, which used a piezoelectric crystal in each nozzle and did not heat the ink at the print head while spraying it onto the page, and released the Epson MJ-500 inkjet cartridge for the Epson Stylus 800 printer in March 1993. Shortly after in 1994, Epson released the first 720 dpi colour inkjet printer, the Epson Stylus Color (P860A) utilizing the Micro Piezo head technology. Newer models of the Stylus series employed Epson&#x27;s special DURABrite ink and used two hard drives (an HD 850 and an HD 860).
In 1994, Epson started to outsource sales representatives to help sell their products in retail stores in the United States. The same year, they started the Epson Weekend Warrior sales program. The purpose of the program was to help improve sales, improve retail sales reps&#x27; knowledge of Epson products, and to address Epson customer service in a retail environment. Reps were assigned on weekend shifts, typically around 12–20 hours a week. Epson started the Weekend Warrior program with TMG Marketing (now Mosaic Sales Solutions), and later with Keystone Marketing Inc, then returned to Mosaic, and switched again to Campaigners Inc. on June 24, 2007 after the Mosaic contract expired. The sales reps of Campaigners, Inc. are not outsourced; Epson hired rack jobbers to ensure retailers displayed products properly, freeing up its regular sales force to concentrate on profitable sales solutions to value-added resellers and system integrators, leaving &quot;retail&quot; to reps who did not require sales skills.
===Personal computers===
Epson entered the personal computer market in 1983 with the QX-10, a CP/M-compatible Z80 machine. By 1986, the company had shifted to the growing PC market with the Equity line. EPSON manufactured and sold NEC PC-9801 clones in Japan. Epson withdrew from the international PC market in 1996. The company still produces and sells PCs in Japan as of 2024.

===21st century===

In June 2003, the company became public following their listing on the 1st section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Since 2017, the company is a constituent of the Nikkei Stock Average index. Although Seiko Group Corporation (f/k/a K. Hattori, Hattori Seiko, and Seiko Holdings) and the key members of the Hattori family still hold approximately 10% of the outstanding shares of Seiko Epson, the company is managed and operated completely independently from Seiko Group.

Seiko Watch Corporation, a division of Seiko Group, produces Seiko timepieces in-house through its subsidiaries as well as delegates the manufacture of some of its high-end watches (Seiko Astron, Grand Seiko, Credor, etc) to Epson. The company makes some of Seiko&#x27;s highest-grade watches at the Micro Artist Studio inside its Shiojiri Plant in Shiojiri, Nagano. Beside Seiko timepieces, Epson develops, designs, manufactures, markets, and sells watches under its own brands such as Trume, Orient, and Orient Star.

In 2004, Epson introduced their R-D1 (the first digital rangefinder camera on the market), which supports the Leica M mount and Leica M39 mount lenses with an adapter ring. Because its sensor is smaller than that of the standard 35 mm film frame, lenses mounted on the R-D1 have a narrower field of view by a factor of 1.53. In 2006, the R-D1 was replaced by the R-D1s, a cheaper version with identical hardware. Epson has released a firmware patch to bring the R-D1 up to the full functionality of its successor, being the first digital camera manufacturer to make such an upgrade available for free.

In September 2012, Epson introduced a printer called the Expression Premium XP-800 Small-in-One, with the ability to print wirelessly. The Expression brand name has since been used on various models of scanners. In the third quarter of 2012, Epson&#x27;s global market share in the sale of printers, copiers and multifunction devices amounted to 15.20 percent.

In September 2015, Epson debuted the ET-4550 printer, which enables the user to pour ink into separate inkwells from ink bottles instead of cartridges.

Epson is also involved in the smartglasses market. Since 2016, the company has three different models: the Moverio BT-100, the Moverio BT-200, and the Moverio Pro BT-2000, the latter of which is an enterprise oriented, upgraded version of the BT-200 with stereoscopic cameras. The company also was the first to release consumer smartglasses with transparent optics, which were popular with drone pilots for providing a first-person view while still being able to see the drone in the sky.
In 2016, Epson presented the large-format SureColor SC-P10000 ink printer; it prints with inks in ten colours on paper up to wide.

==ESC/P==

To control its printers, Epson introduced a printer control language, the Epson Standard Code for Printers (or ESC/P). It became a de facto industry standard for controlling print formatting during the era of dot matrix printers, whose popularity was initially started by the Epson MX-80.

== Robots ==

Epson Robots is the robotics design and manufacturing department of Epson. Seiko Epson produces some microcontrollers, such as the S1C63. In 1980, Epson started the production of robots.

== Ink cartridge controversies ==

In July 2003, a Netherlands-based consumer association advised its 640,000 members to boycott Epson inkjet printers. The organisation alleged that Epson customers were unfairly charged for ink they could never use. Later that month, however, the group retracted its call for a nationwide boycott and issued a statement conceding that residual ink left in Epson cartridges was necessary for the printers to function properly.

Epson designed ink to be left in the cartridges (having done so ever since the introduction of piezoelectric print heads) due to the way the capping mechanism worked. If the capping mechanism dries out, then the heads risk getting clogged, necessitating expensive repairs.

Nonetheless, Epson America, Inc. settled a class action lawsuit brought before the Los Angeles Superior Court. It did not admit guilt, but agreed to refund $45 to anyone who purchased an Epson inkjet printer after April 8, 1999 (at least $20 of which must be used at Epson&#x27;s e-Store).

According to IDG News Service, Epson filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in February 2006 against 24 companies that manufactured, imported, or distributed Epson-compatible ink cartridges for resale in the U.S. On March 30, 2007, ITC judge Paul Luckern issued an initial determination that the cartridges in question did infringe upon Epson&#x27;s patents.

In 2015, it emerged that Epson printers reported cartridges to be empty when in fact up to 20% of their ink remains. As in 2003, the company responded:

<text>Ljig () is a town and municipality located in the Kolubara District of western Serbia. It has a population of 2,938 inhabitants, while the municipality has a total of 10,711 inhabitants.

It is surrounded by Mount Rajac and Mount Rudnik.

==History==
The recorded history of the Ljig settlement itself begins in 1911, when a railroad was built between Lajkovac and Gornji Milanovac. The area, however, has a long history. The Dići church was founded by Serbian nobleman Vlgdrag, who was buried here in 1327. The ruins of the medieval Vavedenje Monastery include impressive sarcophagi dating from the 15th century, believed to belong to the Serbian despots Stefan Branković and Đurađ Branković. According to legend, Djuradj&#x27;s wife, Jerina, was buried there as well.

An early reference to &quot;Ljig&quot; can be found in the 17th century records of Evliya Çelebi, which describe &quot;LIGmehri&quot; (the Ljig River) rising from Kara Dag in the village Baht (today&#x27;s Ba) and flowing into the Kolubara River near Valjevo. No settlement in the area was known to the Austrians when they occupied Serbia from 1717 to 1739. By 1818, however, the nearby settlement Gukosi had grown to 50 homes.

A railway station was built in 1917 near the present-day center of Ljig. This lower area under the Gukoši hill includes a small settlement with a municipal court, school, inn, two stores, two textile mills, three tailors and several houses, and when still part of Gukoši had been referred to as the area &quot;on the Ljig River.&quot;

During World War I, the Battle of Kolubara was fought nearby, making this area significant in history of Serbia and of war, and in military science. A monument memorializing the battle has been erected on Rajac Mountain.

Ljig separated from Gukoši in 1922, and by 1930 a school, health center and church were built. Prior to that time, Ljig residents had worshipped in Moravci.

<doc id="1082799" wikidata="Q3723591" url="?curid=1082799" title="Horned helmet">
<text>Horned helmets were worn by many people around the world. Headpieces mounted with animal horns or replicas were also worn since ancient history, as in the Mesolithic Star Carr Frontlets. These were probably used for religious ceremonial or ritual purposes, as horns tend to be impractical on a combat helmet. Much of the evidence for these helmets and headpieces comes from depictions rather than the items themselves.

== Prehistoric Middle East &amp; Cyprus ==
Horned hats have been used to signify deities in Mesopotamia and Cyprus, and also kings, as seen on the Victory Stele of Naram-Sin. More horns signified higher importance.

== Europe ==
=== Prehistoric Europe ===
Two bronze statuettes dated to the early 12th century BC, the so-called &quot;horned god&quot; and &quot;ingot god&quot;, found in Enkomi, Cyprus have horned helmets. In Sardinia warriors with horned helmets are depicted in dozens of bronze figures and in the Mont&#x27;e Prama giant statues, similar to those of the Shardana warriors (and possibly belonging to the same people) depicted by the Egyptians.

A pair of bronze horned helmets, the Veksø helmets, from the later Bronze Age (dating to ) were found near Veksø, Denmark, in 1942. Another early find is the Grevensvænge hoard from Zealand, Denmark, (, now partially lost).

The Waterloo Helmet, a Celtic bronze ceremonial helmet with repoussé decoration in the La Tène style, dating to , was found in the River Thames, at London. Its abstracted &#x27;horns&#x27;, different from those of the earlier finds, are straight and conical. Late Gaulish helmets () with small horns and adorned with wheels, reminiscent of the combination of a horned helmet and a wheel on plate C of the Gundestrup cauldron (), were found in Orange, France. Other Celtic helmets, especially from Eastern Europe, had bird crests. The enigmatic Torrs Pony-cap and Horns from Scotland appears to be a horned champron to be worn by a horse.

=== European Migration Period ===
Depicted on the Arch of Constantine, dedicated in AD 315, are Germanic soldiers, sometimes identified as &quot;Cornuti&quot;, shown wearing horned helmets. On the relief representing the Battle of Verona (312) they are in the first lines, and they are depicted fighting with the bowmen in the relief of the Battle of the Milvian Bridge.

A depiction on a Migration Period (5th century) metal die from Öland, Sweden, shows a warrior with a helmet adorned with two snakes, or dragons, arranged in a manner similar to horns. Decorative plates of the Sutton Hoo helmet () depict spear-carrying dancing men wearing horned helmets, similar to a figure seen on one of the Torslunda plates from Sweden. Also, a pendant from Ekhammar in Uppland, features the same figure in the same pose and an 8th century find in Staraya Ladoga (a Norse trading outpost at the time) shows an object with similar headgear. An engraved belt-buckle found during excavations by Sonia Chadwick Hawkes in a 7th century grave at Finglesham, Kent in 1964 bears the image of a naked warrior standing between two spears wearing a belt and a horned helmet; a case has been made that the much-repaired chalk figure called the &quot;Long Man of Wilmington&quot;, East Sussex, repeats this iconic motif, and originally wore a similar cap, of which only the drooping lines of the neckguard remain. This headgear, of which only depictions have survived, seems to have mostly fallen out of use with the end of the Migration period. Some have suggested that the figure in question does not portray actual headgear, but a mythological object of a god like Odin. A one-eyed figure with similar headgear was found at the site of Uppåkra temple, an alleged center of an Odinic-cult activity. A similar figurine from Levide, Gotland, lacked an eye, apparently removed after its completion. This would link the headgear as a mythological representations rather than depictions of actual helmets. Note that the similar crests to the animal figures on the helmets of the warrior&#x27;s depicted on the Sutton Hoo helmet has been demonstrated on helmets from Valsgärde, but the depicted crests where grossly exaggerated.

=== European Middle Ages ===
During the High Middle Ages, fantastical headgear became popular among knights, in particular for tournaments. The achievements or representations of some coats of arms, for example that of Lazar Hrebeljanovic, depict them, but they rarely appear as charges depicted within the arms themselves. It is sometimes argued that helmets with large protuberances would not have been worn in battle due to the impediment to their wearer. However, impractical adornments have been worn on battlefields throughout history.

== In Asia ==
In pre-Meiji Restoration Japan, some Samurai armor incorporated a horned, plumed or crested helmet. These horns, used to identify military commanders on the battlefield, could be cast from metal, or made from genuine water buffalo horns.

Indo-Persian warriors often wore horned or spiked helmets in battle to intimidate their enemies. These conical &quot;devil masks&quot; were made from plated mail, and usually had eyes engraved on them.

== Popular association with Vikings ==

Viking warriors are often associated with horned helmets in popular culture, but this is merely a modern association starting in the 1800s, initially popularized by the Norse operas of Richard Wagner, which depicted horns and wings on the helmets of the vikings.

Contemporary Viking Age texts and stories regularly mention helmets, but never mention horned headgear. Christian writers, who were keen to portray the Vikings as barbaric and uncivilized, omitted the mention of horns. The few period helmets found thus far do not feature horns, instead coinciding with the construction of earlier Vendel Period spectacle helmets. The helmet descriptions found in the period epic poem Beowulf also coincide with the Vendel era helmets, as well as earlier Germanic boar helmets, which also lack horns. The only find of Scandinavian horned helmets are the Bronze Age Veksø Helmets and depictions of ceremonial &quot;bird horned&quot; headgear on Migration Period trinkets – see . Historians generally believe that if horned headgear existed during the Viking Age, it was not worn regularly.

A 20th-century example is the Minnesota Vikings American football team, whose logo carries a horn on each side of the helmet. The comic strip character &quot;Hägar the Horrible&quot; and all male Vikings in the animated TV series &quot;Vicky the Viking&quot; are always depicted wearing horned helmets, as are numerous characters in the DreamWorks &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; franchise and in &quot;The Lost Vikings&quot; video game series. Another popular culture depiction is the homage to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; by Merrie Melodies in the Chuck Jones-directed cartoon &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot;, which depicts Elmer Fudd wearing a magical horned Viking helmet as he chases Bugs Bunny.

<text>This is a list of prime ministers of Uzbekistan (), from the establishment of the office in 1925 as the chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Uzbek SSR to the present day.

The current prime minister is Abdulla Aripov. He assumed the office on 14 December 2016. The Government House on Mustakillik Square in Tashkent serves as the Prime Minister&#x27;s primary workplace and residence.

== Powers and tasks ==
The Prime Minister of the Republic of Uzbekistan serves as the leader of the Cabinet of Ministers, overseeing and managing its operations. This individual holds personal accountability for the Cabinet&#x27;s effectiveness, presides over its meetings, endorses decisions, and represents the Cabinet in international relations on behalf of the President of Uzbekistan. The Prime Minister engages in negotiations, signs intergovernmental treaties, agreements, and memoranda, subject to the president&#x27;s approval. Responsibilities also include the allocation of duties among deputy prime ministers, making decisions on non-Cabinet meeting matters related to state and economic management, and proposing Cabinet members to the president after Legislative Chamber approval.

Additionally, the Prime Minister suggests appointments and dismissals of regional governors to the president, coordinates the activities of government bodies, resolves disagreements, and presents an annual report to both chambers of the Oliy Majlis on socio-economic development and priorities. The Prime Minister issues orders and recommendations within their purview, keeps the president informed, and temporarily assumes presidential duties within Uzbekistan when the president is abroad. In the Prime Minister&#x27;s absence, the First Deputy Prime Minister or, by consensus, one of the Deputy Prime Ministers temporarily fulfills their responsibilities.

<doc id="1082807" wikidata="Q1316565" url="?curid=1082807" title="Harvey Glance">
<text>Harvey Edward Glance (March 28, 1957 – June 12, 2023) was an American sprint runner. He won gold medals in tandem with his teammates at the 4 × 100 m relay at the 1976 Summer Olympics, 1979 and 1987 Pan American Games, and 1987 World Championships.

==Track and field career==
Glance equaled the then 100 m world record of 9.9 twice in 1976: first on April 3 in Columbia, South Carolina and then a month later in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As an Auburn University student, Glance won the NCAA 100 m championships in 1976 and 1977 and 200 m championships in 1976. In 1976, he also recorded the automatic timings of 10.12 s and 10.11 s that were world junior records for 100 m.

Glance finished first in the 100 m at the 1976 U.S. Olympic Trials. At the 1976 Montreal Olympics, Glance was a disappointing fourth in 100 m, as the United States failed to win a medal in the event. He then ran the opening leg in the gold medal winning American 4 × 100 m relay team. At the 1979 Pan American Games, Glance was second in 100 m and won the gold medal as a member of American 4 × 100 m relay team. He was also second in 4 × 100 m relay at the 1979 Athletics World Cup. Glance was also in line to replace James Sanford in the individual 100 m race if Sanford had not recovered in time from a muscle injury.

Glance again qualified for the team for the Olympic team for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, finishing second in the 100 m. However, due to the boycott, he did not compete at the Olympics but competed in the Liberty Bell Classic (Olympic Boycott Games) instead, winning silver in the 100 m and gold in the relay. He was a recipient of one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes.

==Track coach career==
Glance worked first as assistant coach at Auburn University (1990–91) and then became their head coach.

In 1997, he became head Men&#x27;s track and field coach at the University of Alabama. While there, he established the &#x27;Crimson Tide&#x27; as one of the USA&#x27;s best college teams, and was able to attract many top athletes to the university including Kirani James (World 400 m champion in 2011 and Olympic 400 m champion in 2012).

At the national level, Glance assumed the following roles:

* 1994 – World Junior Team in Lisbon, Portugal;
* 1997 – World University Games in Sicily, Italy;
* 1999 – Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Canada;
* 2003 – assistant coach for Team USA at the 2003 World Championships in Paris, France;
* 2006 – World junior Team in Beijing, China;
* 2008 – assistant coach for Team USA at the 2008 Olympic Games;
* 2009 – men&#x27;s head coach for Team USA at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin, Germany.

In recognition of his achievements, in 1996 he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, and, most notably, he received in 2008 the Congressional Gold Medal of Freedom.

In April 2011, Glance announced he was to retire from his role at Alabama at the end of the season. Following his retirement, Glance continued to work as the personal coach of Kirani James, assisting in his journey to become an Olympic champion.

==Personal life==
Glance was born in Phenix City, Alabama, the son of Wheeler and Ella Glance, and was educated at Central High School in Phenix City. There he was mentored in track by coach Joe Henderson, who had recognized Glance&#x27;s special talent.

After high school, he earned a degree in Health &amp; Human Performance at Auburn University.

Glance always recognized his potential as a coach and volunteered to work as one in Arizona whilst still an athlete. Always aware of the importance of public relations and civic responsibility, Glance was a regular visitor as a student to a veterans hospital and was selected as one of five student-athletes from the 1976 Olympics team to be invited to an NCAA Honors Luncheon with the President of the United States. His coach, Mel Rosen, was proud to state &quot;Harvey&#x27;s what I call world-class – as an athlete and as a man.&quot;

Glance died of cardiac arrest at a hospital in Mesa, Arizona, on June 12, 2023, at age 66.

==Rankings==
Glance was ranked among the best in the U.S. and the world in both the 100 and 200 m sprint events over the incredible spread of 12 seasons from 1976 to 1987, according to the votes of the experts of &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot;.

<doc id="1082819" wikidata="Q1365320" url="?curid=1082819" title="Lam Jones">
<text>John Wesley &quot;Lam&quot; Jones (April 4, 1958 – March 15, 2019) was an American athlete who won a gold medal in the 4×100 meter relay at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and played professional football in the National Football League (NFL) as a wide receiver for the New York Jets and Dallas Cowboys. Prior to that, he played college football and ran track at the University of Texas.

==Early life==
Jones attended Lampasas High School. In football, he became a regular starter at running back in a wishbone offense as a junior. He posted 9 carries for 197 yards (21.9-yard avg.) and 4 touchdowns against Fredericksburg High School. He had 12 carries for 154 yards (12.8-yard avg.) and 4 touchdowns against Llano High School. He finished the season with 1,330 rushing yards, an 11.6-yard average, 159 scored points and was named second-team Class AAA All-state.

As a senior, he tallied 257 yards and 4 touchdowns against Gainesville High School and was named All-state. He scored 45 touchdowns in 2 seasons.

In track as a junior, he was the state champion in the 440-yard dash with a time of 47.6 seconds.

He is considered legendary in Texas high school sports history for his performance in the mile relay at the 1976 U.I.L. State Track and Field Meet. Running anchor for Class 3A Lampasas High School, Jones took the baton in last place, reportedly 40 to 60 yards behind the leaders, and passed the entire field for victory. The run has taken on near-mythical status among those who saw it — or claim to have seen it. In 2015, CBS affiliate KEYE broadcast a segment on the existence of a film of the legendary event including Jones&#x27; reaction when he learned of it.

==1976 Olympics==
Before enrolling at the University of Texas, at the age of 18, Jones qualified for the 4 × 100 metres relay, becoming the youngest athlete from Texas to earn a berth on the U.S. Olympic track and field team. At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, he won a gold medal running the second leg of the  team that set a world record with a time of 38.33 seconds. Jones also replaced an injured Houston McTear in the 100 meters, finished sixth, and returned home as a national celebrity.

==College career==
Jones accepted a football scholarship from the University of Texas to play under head coach Darrell Royal. In order to differentiate between two players named Johnny Jones on the team, Royal gave them nicknames based on their hometowns — Johnny “Lam” Jones from &quot;Lam&quot;pasas, Texas, and Johnny “Ham” Jones from &quot;Ham&quot;lin, Texas.

As a freshman running back, Jones posted 118 carries for 624 yards (second on the team to Earl Campbell) with a 5.3-yard average and five touchdowns, and three receptions for 79 yards (third on the team). As a sophomore, new head coach Fred Akers changed the offense and Jones was moved to wide receiver. He led the team with 21 receptions for 543 yards (25.9-yard average) with seven touchdowns, and nine carries for 30 yards (3.3-yard average).

As a junior, Jones led the team with 25 receptions for 446 yards (17.8-yard average) with five touchdowns, and 15 carries for 128 yards (8.5-yard average) with one rushing touchdown. As a senior, he led the team with 36 receptions for 535 yards (14.9-yard average) with two touchdowns, and 14 carries for 68 yards (4.9-yard average).

Jones played wide receiver in run oriented offenses, usually being double-teamed and some times triple-teamed by opposing defenses. In his football career, he averaged 28 receptions per season and 18.9-yards per catch with 14 touchdowns. He ranks 10th on the school&#x27;s all-time all-purpose yardage list (3,042). He also is one of only three players in Longhorn history to rush for 100 yards in a game and also have a 100-yard receiving game.

===College statistics===
* Includes bowl games.

===Track===
In his freshman track season, Jones won the 100 metres in 9.85 seconds, which would have been a world record if it hadn&#x27;t been hand-timed. When converted into automatic timing (10.14 seconds) it ranked as the fastest 100 metres in school history. His times of 9.21 seconds for the 100-yard dash and 20.14 seconds for 220-yard dash set records for Memorial Stadium. He also won four events (100, 220, 440 relay and mile relay) at the Southwest Conference meet. At the NCAA championships, Jones completed a grueling 16-month season by finishing second in the 100 metres with 10.27 seconds and seventh in the 200 metres in 20.85 seconds, with track observers noting he looked worn out.

As a sophomore in track, football injuries began to impact his performances. He ran a hand-timed 10.1 seconds in the 100 metres. He won his first-round heat at the NCAA championships in 10.14 seconds, but he failed to qualify for the NCAA final.

In 1994, he was inducted into the Texas Athletics Hall of Honor. He is considered to be one of the greatest athletes in school history.

==Professional career==
===New York Jets===
In the 1980 NFL draft, the New York Jets were targeting offensive tackle Anthony Muñoz with the second overall pick they obtained from the San Francisco 49ers, but settled for Jones after their team physician recommended not to take Munoz, who failed a physical exam because he had undergone reconstructive knee surgery. The selection was acquired by trading two 1980 first round draft picks (#13-Earl Cooper and #20-Jim Stuckey). Jones was ranked as the best wide receiver in the draft.

The $2.1 million contract he received () was the first in the NFL worth over a million dollars. There were reports in the media that the actual contract numbers may have been lower, which included a $250,000 signing bonus, plus a $200,000 loan, and a $300,000 deferred bonus, for a total package of $1.4 million.

As a rookie, he started 13 games, making 25 receptions for 482 yards (19.3-yard avg.) and 3 touchdowns. Since Jones was a world-class sprinter with elite speed, he could beat any coverage, but had trouble catching the football. He was viewed more as an athlete than a football player.

In 1981, he was a backup behind Derrick Gaffney, starting only 3 out of 15 games, while collecting 20 receptions for 342 yards (17.1-yard avg.) and 3 touchdowns.

In 1982, the season was reduced from a 16-game schedule to 9 contests because of the players&#x27; strike. He started 7 out of 8 games, finishing with 18 receptions for 294 yards (16.3-yard avg.) and 2 touchdowns.

In 1983, he had his best season with 7 starts out of 14 games, along with 43 receptions for 734 yards (17.1-yard avg.) and 4 touchdowns. He caught 31 of his career-high 43 passes in the final 8 contests.

In 1984, he was placed on the injured reserve list on August 28, spending 11 weeks there with a broken collarbone he suffered in the first preseason game against the Cincinnati Bengals. He was activated on October 26, starting 8 out of 8 games, but was platooned with Gaffney communicating plays from the sideline to quarterback Ken O&#x27;Brien. He made 32 receptions for 470 yards (14.7-yard avg.) and one touchdown.

In 1985, he re-injured his right index finger during a practice and was lost for the year after being placed on the injured reserve list on August 15. In 1986, he sat out the season with a hamstring injury after being placed on the injured reserve list on August 19.

On July 23, 1987, he was traded to the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for a 1988 fifth round draft pick (#131-Dennis Price). He left after playing in 61 games (37 starts), recording 138 receptions for 2,322 yards and 13 touchdowns. During his career, he was considered a first round disappointment, criticized for his inconsistency and inability to make catches across the middle of the field.

===San Francisco 49ers===
In 1987, the San Francisco 49ers acquired Jones to try him at both split end and flanker, looking to replace Dwight Clark and find a receiver to play alongside Jerry Rice. He was released on August 18.

===Dallas Cowboys===
On August 25, 1987, he was signed as a free agent by the Dallas Cowboys, who were experiencing multiple injuries in the receiving corps.

After the players went on strike in the third week of the 1987 season, those contests were canceled (reducing the 16-game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games going forward would be played using replacement players. He crossed the picket line off the injured reserve to be a part of the Dallas replacement team that was given the mock name &quot;Rhinestone Cowboys&quot; by the media. On October 21, he was released after the strike ended. He didn&#x27;t appear in any game or record any stat during his time with the team.

==Personal life==
After his football career, Jones battled drug and alcohol addiction. Jones never had a drink of alcohol until his time in college. A hazing incident as an NFL rookie was an omen of things to come when veterans took him out drinking. The group started downing shots. Unbeknownst to Jones, the vets were drinking soft drinks while pouring him liquor. His troubles with drugs continued after his NFL career until a sexual molestation incident caused him to go to rehab. He recovered and went on to speak about addiction to high school athletes to help them avoid the same problems.

The once shy Jones became a motivational speaker for high school athletes, sharing his story of hardship as part of his message. He donated part of his speaking fees to the Texas Special Olympics, to which he also donated his Olympic medal in the late 1970s.

In 2005, Jones was diagnosed with myeloma, a cancer that affects bone marrow throughout the body. He died of myeloma March 15, 2019.

==Legacy==

In 2008, he was inducted into the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame. In 2013, he was inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame.

The film received positive reviews from critics worldwide. For this film, Ajayan won the Indira Gandhi Award for Best Debut Film of a Director and Kerala State Film Award for Best Debut Director in 1990. The film also won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Popular Film in 1990 and was nominated for the Golden Leopard award at the Locarno International Film Festival in 1992.

In the afterword to his book &quot;The Master Carpenter&quot;, author M. T. Vasudevan Nair wrote that Ajayan first approached him for a screenplay of his story &quot;Manikkakkallu&quot;. That did not materialise and later he approached with another dream project &quot;Perumthachan&quot;. In the end of the afterword, M. T. thanks Ajayan for persuading him to write the screenplay for &quot;Perumthachan&quot;.

He died on 13 December 2018.

==Early life and career==
Ajayan was the eldest son of film director and playwright Thoppil Bhasi. He secured a diploma in film technology from the Adayar film institute. He started as a camera assistant and later worked as an associate director with Thoppil Bhasi, Bharathan, and Padmarajan.

<doc id="1082826" wikidata="Q641404" url="?curid=1082826" title="Diasystem">
<text>In the field of dialectology, a diasystem or polylectal grammar is a linguistic analysis set up to encode or represent a range of related varieties in a way that displays their structural differences.

The term &quot;diasystem&quot; was coined by linguist and dialectologist Uriel Weinreich in a 1954 paper as part of an initiative in exploring how to extend advances in structuralist linguistic theory to dialectology to explain linguistic variation across dialects. Weinreich&#x27;s paper inspired research in the late 1950s to test the proposal. However, the investigations soon showed it to be generally untenable, at least under structuralist theory. With the advent of generative theory in the 1960s, researchers tried applying a generative approach in developing diasystemic explanations; this also fell short.

According to some leading sociolinguists, the diasystem idea for incorporating variation into linguistic theory has been superseded by William Labov&#x27;s notion of the linguistic variable. As such, the concept has not been part of any substantial linguistic theory and the term has limited currency in linguistics.

==Origin of the concept==
 first suggested comparing accents by their synchronic states, rather than by comparing their different historical developments. He classified sound differences between dialects into three types:
*Phonological: the inventory phonemes and contextual restrictions, which may vary between dialects. For example, speakers of Castilian Spanish have the phonemes and , whereas Western Hemisphere dialects of Spanish have just the latter.
*Phonetic: how phonemes are realized phonetically. For example, most dialects of English have strongly aspirated in words like &quot;park&quot;, &quot;tool&quot;, and &quot;cat&quot;, but some Northern English accents do not feature such aspiration.
*Etymological distribution: the distribution of phonemes among member words in an interdialectal lexical correspondence set. For example, most English varieties contrast and , but some use the former in words like &quot;bath&quot; and &quot;grass&quot; and others use the latter.

Despite Trubetzkoy&#x27;s proposal, linguists continued to consider variation between varieties outside of the scope of inquiry of grammar construction; each variety, in their thinking, should only be studied on its own terms.

Inspired by Trubetzkoy, proposed a synthesis of linguistic geography and descriptive linguistics by applying the structuralist concept of grammar to the description of regular correspondences between different varieties; a resulting supergrammar, which he called a &quot;diasystem&quot;, would be consistent with the individual grammars of all the member dialects. A diasystem is a higher order system and its component units of analysis would accordingly be abstractions of a higher order than the units of analysis of the individual systems. That is, just as the phones present within an individual variety are grouped together into abstract phonemes, the phonemes present within a group of varieties could be grouped together into even more abstract diaphonemes. Weinreich exemplified the diasystemic approach by a formulaic arrangement of phoneme correspondences in three dialects of Yiddish, focusing on the vowels but arguing that the principle could work for other aspects of language.

Although Weinreich did not elaborate the diasystemic approach, he did consider some theoretical pitfalls to be avoided. He recognized that phonemic mergers and splits with dissimilar results across dialects would pose a difficult challenge for the construction of a diasystem; he cautioned against positing a diasystem when the work of creating all the member systems (e.g. the work of phonemicization) was yet incomplete; and, following the lead of , he noted that the differences in phonological inventory and etymological distribution might prove problematic in the construction of diasystems.

==Subsequent investigation==
A few linguists took up Weinreich&#x27;s challenge and quickly found it to be inadequate. Some of the failures had been anticipated by Weinreich himself, as described above.

 found an extreme example of divergent incidence in a study of two dialects of Swiss German, Luzerner and Appenzeller, which evolved independently of each other. Although each dialect had the same set of eleven short vowel phonemes, only one pair ( ~ ) was shown to have a common parent vowel in earlier stages of German. The remaining phonetic similarities between the Luzerner and Appenzeller phoneme sets were fortuitous results of multiple mergers and splits that each dialect underwent separately.

, examining and , noted the need for refinements in the original proposal; different researchers did not seem to agree on definitions, disciplines of study, or objects of inquiry. The research and debate concluded that multiple dialects could not be described by a common grammar, at least not under structuralist theory. That is, it would be unfeasible to construct a single grammar for multiple dialects unless their differences were very minor or if it incorporated only a small number of dialects.

Related to Weinreich&#x27;s proposal were efforts in both American dialectology and generative phonology to construct an &quot;overall system&quot; that represented the underlying representation for all dialects of English.

An example of this was the diaphonemic analysis, made by , that presumably all American varieties could fit.

Six of the nine simple vowels in this diasystem are common across most dialects: occurs in &quot;pit&quot;, in &quot;pet&quot;, in &quot;pat&quot;, in &quot;putt&quot;, in &quot;put&quot;, and in &quot;pot&quot;. The other three are found in specific dialects or dialect groups: represents the vowel of &quot;road&quot; in New England varieties; represents a vowel that often appears in stressed syllables in words like &quot;just&quot; (when it means &#x27;only&#x27;); and represents the vowel of &quot;pot&quot; in Southern British and New England dialects.

These nine simple vowels can then be combined with any of three offglides () to make 36 possible complex nuclei. This system was popular amongst American linguists (despite criticism, particularly from Hans Kurath) until demonstrated its inadequacy.

The most salient criticism of these broad diasystems was the issue of how cognitively real they are. That is, whether speakers actually have competence in using or understanding the grammatical nuances of multiple varieties. In certain sociolinguistic circumstances, speakers&#x27; linguistic repertoire contains multiple varieties. For example, argues that Modern Literary Arabic is a diasystem of various interference phenomena occurring when speakers of different Arabic varieties attempt to speak or read Literary Arabic.

More concretely, Peter Trudgill put forth what he considered to be a cognitively real diasystem in , a book-length sociolinguistic study of Norwich. As a critic of Weinreich&#x27;s original proposal, he approached the concept as a generativist, putting forth a series of rules that could generate any possible output reflected in the diversity and variability of sociologically conditioned linguistic variables. Because most speakers of Norwich could vary their pronunciation of each variable depending on the circumstances in which they are speaking, the diasystem&#x27;s rules reflected speakers&#x27; actual linguistic abilities.

Cognitively real diasystems are not limited to humans. For example, crows are able to distinguish between different calls that prompt others to disperse, assemble, or rescue; these calls show regional variation so that French crows do not understand recorded American calls. Although captive birds show difficulty understanding the calls of birds from nearby regions, those allowed to migrate are able to understand calls from both, suggesting that they have mentally constructed a diasystem that enables them to understand both call systems.

Still, these sorts of &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; grammars differ in degree from broader diasystems, which are much less likely to be part of speakers&#x27; linguistic competence. Even Trudgill has argued against their cognitive reality, deeming the concept of a broad diasystem to be a &quot;theoretical dead-end.&quot; Although the concept did not withstand scrutiny by research linguists, it nevertheless triggered a surge of academic work that used it in applied linguistics (e.g. for ESL education materials, composition texts for native speakers, basic linguistics texts, and in the application of linguistics to literary criticism). Diasystemic representations are also possible in dictionaries. For example, the Macquarie Dictionary reflects the pronunciation of four phonetically distinct sociolects of Australian English. Because these sociolects are the same phonemically, readers (at least, those from Australia) can interpret the system as representing their own accent.

<text>Millard Frank Hampton Jr. (born July 8, 1956) is an American former athlete, winner of gold medal in 4 × 100 m relay and the individual silver medal in the 200 meters at the 1976 Summer Olympics.

Born in Fresno, California, Millard Hampton was an AAU champion in 200 m in 1976. His father, Millard Hampton Sr. was a top sprinter in his own right, placing as high as second in the CIF California State Meet 220 yards in 1952.

Millard Hampton attended Silver Creek High School in San Jose, California, where he was coached by former San Jose State great Bobby Poynter, graduating in 1974 and continues to hold the school record in the 100 m at 10.4 sec. and the 200 m record at 20.8 sec. While at Silver Creek, in 1974 he won the CIF California State Meet title that had eluded his father.

Next Hampton went to San Jose City College (SJCC) where he was coached by Bobby Poynter and Bert Bonanno. While at SJCC, Hampton won the 1976 Olympic Trials and at the Montreal Olympics, Hampton won silver medal in the 200 meters and ran the third leg in the gold medal winning American 4 x 100 metres relay team.

Hampton continued his education at UCLA and was considered a favorite for another Olympic team before the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott.

Another Silver Creek graduate, Andre Phillips won the gold medal in the 400 metres hurdles at the 1988 Summer Olympics, making for a rare instance when two Olympic Gold medalists have come from the same high school. The high school website claims eight schools. The school has honored both by hosting the &quot;Hampton Phillips Classic&quot; named in their honor.

He currently resides in Elk Grove, CA

<doc id="1082829" wikidata="Q315342" url="?curid=1082829" title="Burgundian Wars">
<text>The Burgundian Wars (1474–1477) were a conflict between the Burgundian State and the Old Swiss Confederacy and its allies. Open war broke out in 1474, and the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, was defeated three times on the battlefield in the following years and was killed at the Battle of Nancy in 1477. The Duchy of Burgundy and several other Burgundian lands then became part of France, and the Burgundian Netherlands and Franche-Comté were inherited by Charles&#x27;s daughter, Mary of Burgundy, and eventually passed to the House of Habsburg upon her death because of her marriage to Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor.

==Background==

The dukes of Burgundy had succeeded, over a period of about 100 years, in establishing their rule as a strong force between the Holy Roman Empire and France. The consolidation of regional principalities with varying wealth into the Burgundian State brought great economic opportunity and wealth to the new power. A deciding factor for many elites in consolidating their lands was the relatively safe guarantee of making a profit under the economically stable Duchy of Burgundy. Their possessions included, besides their original territories of the and the Duchy of Burgundy, the economically-strong regions of Flanders and Brabant as well as Luxembourg.

The dukes of Burgundy generally pursued aggressive expansionist politics, especially in Alsace and Lorraine, seeking to unite their northern and southern possessions geographically. Having already been in conflict with the French king, Burgundy had sided with the English in the Hundred Years&#x27; War but then the Yorkists in the Wars of the Roses, when Henry VI sided with France. The conflict had left the regional powers of France and England in a weakened state and allowed for the rise of the Burgundian power, alongside its fierce French rivals. The repercussions of the Black Death also continued to affect Europe and assisted in maintaining a diminished society. According to some historians, the extremely profitable region of the Low Countries supplied the Duchy of Burgundy with sufficient funds to support their ambitions internally but especially externally. In this period of expansion, treaties of trade and peace were signed with Swiss cantons, and would benefit the security of each power against Habsburg and French ambitions. Charles&#x27;s advances along the Rhine brought him into conflict with the Habsburgs, especially Emperor Frederick III.

According to a Cambridge publication on Swiss history, both the Swiss and the Burgundians had made aggression a significant impact on the region&#x27;s foreign affairs. In the effort of consolidating the Swiss Confederacy and for independence from Habsburg rule, Swiss forces gained control of the Habsburg town of Thurgau in an effort to expand its borders and influence. The Bernese people were more frequently being attacked by Charles the Bold&#x27;s Lombard mercenaries. That raised concern to the Bernese as they began to call on their Swiss allies for assistance in the conflict with Burgundy. The aggressive actions of Charles the Bold would eventually culminate in the Swiss giving him the nickname, &quot;the Turk in the West&quot;, and make Burgundy as fierce a rival as the Ottomans in the East.

==Conflict==

Initially in 1469, Duke Sigismund of Habsburg of Austria pawned his possessions in the Alsace in the Treaty of Saint-Omer as a fiefdom to the Duke of Burgundy for a loan or sum of 50,000 florins, as well as an alliance with Charles the Bold, to have them better protected from the expansion of the (the Old Swiss Confederacy). Charles&#x27;s involvement west of the Rhine gave him no reason to attack the confederates, as Sigismund had wanted, but his embargo politics against the cities of Basel, Strasbourg and , directed by his reeve , prompted them to turn to Bern for help. Charles&#x27;s expansionist strategy suffered a first setback in his politics when his attack on the Archbishopric of Cologne failed after the unsuccessful Siege of Neuss (1474–75).

In the conflict&#x27;s second phase, Sigismund sought to achieve a peace agreement with the Swiss confederates, which eventually was concluded in in 1474 (later called the or Perpetual Accord). He wanted to buy back his Alsace possessions from Charles, who refused. Shortly afterwards, was captured and executed by decapitation in Alsace, and the Swiss, united with the Alsace cities and Sigismund of Habsburg in an anti-Burgundian league, conquered part of the Burgundian Jura () by winning the Battle of in November 1474. King Louis XI of France joined the coalition by the Treaty of Andernach in December. The next year, Bernese forces conquered and ravaged , which belonged to the Duchy of Savoy, which was allied with Charles the Bold. Bern had called out to its Swiss allies for expansion into the Vaud region of Savoy to prevent future aggression by Charles near Bernese lands that were geographically closer to Burgundy than those of the rest of the Swiss Confederation. However, the other Swiss cities had become displeased at the ever-growing expansionist and aggressive Bernese foreign policy and so initially did not support Bern. The Confederacy was a collective defense agreement between the Swiss members and ensured that if one city were attacked, the others would come to its aid. Because the military actions by Bern in Savoy were an invasion, the other Confederacy allies had no legal obligation to come to the aid of the Bernese.

In the , the independent republics of the , with the help of Bernese and other confederate forces, drove the Savoyards out of the lower after a victory in the Battle on the Planta in November 1475. In 1476, Charles retaliated and marched to Grandson, which belonged to of Savoy but had recently been taken by the Swiss. There, he had the capitulated garrison hanged or drowned in the lake. When the confederate forces arrived a few days later, Charles was defeated in the Battle of Grandson and was forced to flee the battlefield, leaving behind his artillery and many provisions and valuables. Having rallied his army, he was dealt a devastating blow by the confederates at the Battle of Morat. As Burgundian losses continued, Charles the Bold lost the support of his lords, who were losing men and profit, and a rebellion soon began, led by René II, Duke of Lorraine. As the revolt continued, René used his land&#x27;s strategic location between northern and southern Burgundy to cut off communication and to disrupt war capabilities. The internal conflict only made the war with the Swiss more difficult and pulled Charles&#x27;s attention away from the Confederacy to deal with the more pressing matter of René&#x27;s revolt. Charles the Bold raised a new army but fell during the Battle of Nancy in 1477 in which the Swiss fought alongside an army of René. The military failures of Charles the Bold are summarized by a common contemporary Swiss quote: &quot;Charles the Bold lost his goods at Grandson, his bravery at Morat and his blood at Nancy.&quot;
Near the end of 1476, the Swiss Confederacy began receiving orders from Pope Sixtus IV, who called for an end of the war and the signing of peace between the Swiss and Charles. Although that seemed to be a peaceful resolution to the war, the Pope&#x27;s aspirations for Charles to divert his attention away from the Swiss and onto the Muslims in a crusade began to show. The papal pressure was eventually ignored by the Swiss, who refused to end the war unless Charles left the Duchy of Lorraine, whose lands were controlled by René II. It is evident through contemporary writings that espionage and censorship played an influential role in both Swiss and Burgundian actions throughout the war. Professional spies were hired by both sides to recover information of enemy movements and weak points. However, this profession proved to be extremely lethal, as some Swiss cities suffered heavy losses, and obtaining information of the opposing side continued to be a difficult task throughout the war.

The Burgundian Wars also assisted in the shift of military strategy across Europe after the Swiss victories over the numerically-superior Burgundians. The &quot;Gewalthaufen&quot; proved to be an effective Swiss military strategy against the superior Burgundian forces. Until that point, battles had been dominated by cavalry, which could easily overpower infantry troops on the battlefield. However, the &quot;Gewalthaufen&quot; tactic used long spears to counter cavalry with remarkable success. That marked a key shift in military history and tipped the balance in favour of infantry troops over mounted soldiers.

==Aftermath==

The results of the conflict would prove to have significant repercussions for the future of the Duchy of Burgundy and for the regional stability of Western Europe. With the death of Charles the Bold, the Valois dynasty of the dukes of Burgundy died out, and widespread revolts engulfed the Duchy, which soon collapsed under those pressures. The northern territories of the dukes of Burgundy became a possession of the Habsburgs when Archduke Maximilian of Austria, who would later become Holy Roman Emperor, married Charles&#x27;s only daughter, Mary of Burgundy. The duchy proper reverted to the crown of France under King Louis XI. The initially also became French but was ceded to Maximilian&#x27;s son Philip in 1493 by Charles VIII at the Treaty of Senlis in an attempt to bribe the emperor to remain neutral during Charles&#x27;s planned invasion of Italy.

The victories of the (Swiss Confederation) over what was one of the most powerful military forces in Europe gained it a reputation of being nearly invincible, and the Burgundian Wars marked the beginning of the rise of Swiss mercenaries on the battlefields of Europe. Although Bern and other Swiss cities invaded and controlled large swathes of Savoyard territories, the Confederacy maintained only Grandson, Morat and Echallens as notable cities. Inside the Confederacy itself, however, the outcome of the war led to internal conflict since the city cantons insisted on having most of the proceeds as they had supplied the most troops. The country cantons resented that, and the disputes almost led to war. They were settled by the of 1481.

<text>Trade unions in Malaysia are regulated by the Trade Unions Act of 1959 and the Industrial Relations Act of 1967.

== Membership ==
While the Malaysian constitution guarantees the rights of all Malaysians to form and join a trade union, there are several restrictions imposed by the laws relating to trade unions, i.e., the Trade Unions Act of 1959 and the Industrial Relations Act of 1967.

The restrictive Trade Unions Act does not allow general unions for workers. Membership of any trade union is confined to only those who are employees of a particular industry, establishment, trade and occupation. For example, a bank employee could only be a member of a banking union, but cannot be a member of an airline union or teachers union while a hotel employee, a timber worker or a labourer could not be members of the same union.

For enterprise or in-house union, membership is confined to employees of that particular establishment or company - employees of the company’s subsidiary or an associate company could not join that union. Temporary workers, contract workers including foreign workers could join union as members. However, most of the workers were reluctant to join a union for fear that their contract might not be renewed or work permit cancelled, making it difficult for a union to represent them.

Generally managerial, executive, confidential and security employees cannot be members of a non-executive union, nor can they be represented by a union for the purpose of collective bargaining.

The Trades Unions Act protects workers from being victimised by an employer for joining a union. However, the same section of an act states explicitly that an employer may dismiss, demote, transfer or refuse to promote a worker on other grounds. However, it has not stopped employers form dismissing trade union officials for writing Union circulars (Industrial Court Award Trienekens Sarawak Sdn Bhd)

The Industrial Relations Act allows employers to prohibit management, executives and those who work in a confidential or security capacity from joining a union. The definitions of these terms are left to the employers&#x27; discretion. In practice, some employers classify all clerical staff as working in a confidential capacity and production workers as working in a security capacity since they oversee their machines.

Should the Director General of Industrial Relations fail to get both parties to reach an agreement, the matter is referred to the Human Resources Minister. The minister will investigate and make a decision which may not be overturned by a Malaysian court.

The government policy of segregating trade unions and promoting enterprise unions over national and industry unions has, stifled the trade unions movement. Only 3% of private sector workers are trade union members, and less than 2% are covered by collective agreements. While the number of trade unions has increased most of the unions are in-house unions with less than 100 members.

== Agreements ==
Collective Agreements are governed under the Industrial Relations Act 1967.

Trade union effectiveness in securing decent collective agreements and to protect workers are restricted because Unions must obtain recognition from the employer after it can prove by secret ballot that the majority of the eligible employees are its members.

After that, the employer has 21 days in which to recognise the union. If the employer does not provide recognition within the stipulated period the matter will be taken to the Director General of Industrial Relations for arbitration. This is a very cumbersome process and disputes normally take years to resolve.

Even if the union finally obtains the necessary recognition to represent the workers, the ability to negotiate for better benefits is further restricted as it is virtually impossible for a union to strike.

A deadlock here is referred to the Director General of Industrial Relations for conciliation. Failure to obtain compromise results in the case being referred to the minister who shall refer it to the Industrial Court for arbitration at his discretion. All industrial actions, including picketing and strikes must stopped once the minister makes the reference.

Unions may submit collective agreements on behalf of their members but the Industrial Relations Act (Part IV) forbids such agreements to deal with any matter pertaining to promotion, transfers, termination of service, dismissal and retrenchments.

Decisions of the Industrial Court may be challenged further in the high court, the appeals court and the federal court.

The law allows for duration of collective agreements to be at least three years,

== Strikes ==
The Industrial Relations Act defines a &quot;strike&quot; in a sufficiently broad manner to include work-to-rule and go-slow actions. &quot;&quot;Any act or omission by a body of workers, which is intended or which does result in any limitation, restriction, reduction, delatoriness in the performance of their duties connected to their employment&quot; &quot;

Illegal strikes have consequences such as fines or imprisonment.

A legal strike requires that the union have a trade dispute. A secret ballot with not less than two thirds of the workers involved is required. The Director General has to be informed next. After that, the employer must be informed of the date of the strike. This is all required to prepare for a strike.

If the Minister should refer the case to the Industrial Court before the strike occurs then the strike must not be carried out.

If it is a public sector union then the Minister refers the disputed matter to the Industrial Court only with the consent of the Agong (King) or the state ruler, if it is a state body in question.

The last major strike in Malaysia occurred in 1962. 9,000 railway workers went on strike to demand conversion of daily wages be changed to monthly salaries. The strike lasted 22 days and all government workers were converted to monthly wages. The railway belonged to and was operated by the government at the time, but has since been corporatised.

<text>The Swansea and Mumbles Railway was the venue for the world&#x27;s first passenger horsecar railway service, located in Swansea, Wales, United Kingdom.

Originally built under an act of Parliament of 1804 to move limestone from the quarries of Mumbles to Swansea and to the markets beyond, it carried the world&#x27;s first fare-paying railway passengers under an agreement effective from 25 March 1807. It later moved from horse power to steam locomotion, and was finally converted to electric power, using the largest tram cars ever built for service in Britain, before closing in January 1960, in favour of motor buses.

At the time of the railway&#x27;s closure, it was claimed to have been the world&#x27;s longest serving railway, although this distinction has to be qualified because other railways which were used solely for goods traffic (e.g. the Middleton Railway in Leeds, Yorkshire, dating from 1758) had been operating for longer.

==History==

In 1804 the British Parliament approved the laying of a railway line between Swansea and Oystermouth in South Wales, for the transport of quarried materials to and from the Swansea Canal and the harbour at the mouth of the River Tawe, and later that year the first tracks were laid. At this stage, the railway was known as the Oystermouth Railway and controlled by the Committee of the Company of Proprietors of the Oystermouth Railway or Tramroad Company, which included many prominent citizens of Swansea, including the copper and coal magnate John Morris (later Sir John Morris, Bart.). In later years it became known as the Swansea and Mumbles Railway (although the original company was not wound up until 1959), or just the Mumbles Railway, but to local people it was simply the Mumbles Train.

===Early days===
There was no road link between Swansea and Oystermouth at the beginning of the nineteenth century and the original purpose of the railway was to transport coal, iron ore and limestone. Construction seems to have been completed in 1806 and operations began without formal ceremony, using horse-drawn vehicles. As constructed, the line ran from the Brewery Bank adjacent to the Swansea Canal in Swansea, around the wide sweep of Swansea Bay to a terminus at Castle Hill (near the present-day Clements Quarry) in the tiny isolated fishing village of Oystermouth (known as Mumbles). There was also a branch from Blackpill which ran up the Clyne valley for nearly a mile to Ynys Gate which was intended to promote the development of the valley&#x27;s coal reserves.

In February 1807, approval was given to carry passengers along the line, when one of the original proprietors, Benjamin French, offered to pay the company the sum of twenty pounds in lieu of tolls for the right to do so for twelve months from the following quarter day, 25 March 1807. This is usually cited as the date when the first regular service carrying passengers between Swansea and Oystermouth began, thus giving the railway the claim of being the first passenger railway in the world. Passenger services operated from The Mount, the world&#x27;s first recorded railway station. The venture was evidently a success because the following year French joined with two others in offering the increased sum of twenty five pounds to continue the arrangement for a further year, but the construction of a turnpike road parallel to the railway in the mid-1820s robbed it of much of its traffic and the passenger service (by that time in the hands of one Simon Llewelyn) ceased in 1826 or 1827, ironically just as events elsewhere in the United Kingdom (particularly in the north east of England) were paving the way for the development of railways as a truly national and international transport system for both goods and passengers.

In its early days the line operated in the same manner as the contemporary canals and turnpike roads. Tolls and charges were laid down in the enabling Act of Parliament and any trader could use the line on provision of a suitable waggon and after paying the appropriate toll to the owning Company. The railway was laid in the form of a plateway, with the rails being approximately apart.

After cessation of the passenger service the line became derelict and the original company of proprietors virtually moribund. The Clyne valley branch was relaid in 1841/2 and extended for a further mile (as a private line) to the Rhydydefaid colliery where George Byng Morris, the son of one of the original proprietors, had started to exploit the coal and iron reserves of the valley. From about 1855, George Byng Morris took the line in hand, relaid it with edge rails (i.e. as a conventional railway) to the standard gauge of and reintroduced a horse-drawn passenger service between Swansea and a terminus at The Dunns in Oystermouth.

===Introduction of steam===
Steam power first replaced the horses in 1877 when trials were undertaken with one of Henry Hughes&#x27;s patent tramway locomotives, aptly named &quot;Pioneer&quot;. These were successful and two further locomotives of the same type were obtained, although a dispute between the Swansea Improvements &amp; Tramways Company (which owned the locomotives) and the line&#x27;s then owner, John Dickson (who had come into possession following the death of George Byng Morris) meant that horses continued to operate certain services until 1896. At this time there was a junction between the Mumbles Railway and the Swansea town tramway system at the Slip, allowing S.I. &amp; T. cars to run through from Swansea town centre to Oystermouth. The nature of the dispute was such that the Swansea &amp; Mumbles company demanded that the S.I. &amp; T. horse cars should follow their own steam-hauled services on the line. In 1889, a new company, the Mumbles Railway &amp; Pier Company, was incorporated to extend the railway beyond Oystermouth to a new pier close to Mumbles Head. The first section, to Southend, was opened in 1893 and the remainder, including the pier, in 1898.

The Clyne valley branch continued to be used for coal traffic from Rhydydefaid pit until its closure in 1885 after which the entire branch fell into disuse. In 1896 the promoters of the Gower Light Railway proposed incorporating it into their scheme but nothing came of it. The original branch to Ynys Gate (as authorised in 1804) was relaid in connection with the Clyne Valley slant (opened 1903) and used for coal traffic until the colliery closed in 1915. The extension of 1841/2 remained abandoned until 1920 when a narrow-gauge tramway was laid on its formation to carry coal from Ynys slant to Ynys Gate. This was used only until 1921 when the slant closed. There was then no further traffic on the branch, although the track remained in situ and was still usable as late as 1936 when it is recorded that a diesel locomotive made a trip up the branch as far as Ynys Gate.

A somewhat motley collection of steam locomotives was used to maintain services between 1877 and 1929, beginning with the Hughes tramway locomotives mentioned above (which were actually owned by the S.I. &amp; T. and therefore not able to be used on the railway after 1878). Dickson had purchased two saddle tank locomotives of more conventional outline from the Falcon Engine &amp; Car Works (successor to Hughes&#x27;s Locomotive and Tramway Engine Works), and two more from Manning Wardle &amp; Co of Leeds in the early 1880s. A further locomotive (originally numbered 5, later 3) came from the Hunslet Engine Company of Leeds in 1885. When the new Swansea &amp; Mumbles Railway Company took over operations in 1890 it ordered two 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotives from Black, Hawthorn &amp; Co of Gateshead. These were delivered in 1891 and numbered 1 and 2; they worked on the line until after the First World War. Two larger 0-6-0 side tank locomotives were obtained from the Hunslet Engine Company in 1898; numbered 4 and 5, they bore the brunt of the passenger service until well into the 1920s. The nominally independent Mumbles Railway &amp; Pier Co. ordered a 0-4-0 saddle tank from the Brush Electrical Engineering Co of Loughborough (successor to the Falcon Engine &amp; Car Works) in 1906 and this carried plates reading &quot;MR &amp; P No. 3&quot; to denote its ownership. Finally, a second-hand Avonside 0-6-0ST was obtained and named &quot;Swansea&quot;. All were tank locomotives of 0-4-0 or 0-6-0 wheel arrangement. Ownership was vested variously in the Swansea &amp; Mumbles Railway Company or the Mumbles Railway &amp; Pier Company (and sometimes transferred between the two for accounting purposes) and as early as the 1890s there is evidence that the railway was having to hire in locomotives to supplement its own fleet. By the 1920s, locomotives were regularly being hired from a local dealer, Charles Williams of Morriston, and frequently appear in photographs of the railway taken at that time.

===Centenary – royal visit===
The line celebrated its centenary in 1904, producing a special commemorative brochure for the occasion. Two years previously, a notable experiment had been carried out, namely the introduction of battery-powered &#x27;accumulator&#x27; cars. These were not a success, but one of the cars was retained after the electrical equipment had been stripped out and used to convey parties of visiting dignitaries, including King Edward VII when he and his consort, Queen Alexandra, visited Swansea for the ceremonial cutting of the first sod of the King&#x27;s Dock in July 1904. The car was used again for the visit of King Edward&#x27;s successor, King George V, in 1920, when he officiated at the opening of the Queen&#x27;s Dock.

===Electrification===
The line was electrified in 1928 at 650 V DC using overhead transmission – giving it the distinction of having used three forms of regular locomotive power over the years (i.e. horse, steam and electricity). Trials began on 6 July 1928 and full electric services were introduced on 2 March 1929, using a fleet of eleven double-deck cars built by the Brush Electrical Engineering Co of Loughborough, in Leicestershire. These were the largest ever built for service in Britain and each could seat 106 passengers. Furthermore, they were frequently operated in pairs, giving a total seating capacity of 212 per train.

Two further cars were added later, bringing the fleet strength up to thirteen. A four-wheeled petrol-mechanical locomotive was acquired from Hardy Railmotors of Slough, then in Buckinghamshire, to handle the residual goods traffic on the railway, but this proved to be underpowered and was replaced after a few years by a diesel-mechanical locomotive from John Fowler &amp; Co, of Leeds. The Hardy locomotive was retained for a few years and used for shunting the cars in the depot, which was on the site of the former carriage sheds, adjacent to the Rutland Street terminus, and for inspection of the overhead line equipment, but it had been dismantled by 1954, when parts were used in the construction of a replica horse-drawn car to celebrate the line&#x27;s 150th anniversary.

=== Sale ===

In 1958, The South Wales Transport Company (the principal operator of motor bus services in the Swansea town area and predecessor of the modern-day First Cymru company) purchased the railway from the old owning companies (the Swansea &amp; Mumbles Railway Limited and the Mumbles Railway &amp; Pier Company), having previously been the lessee in succession to the Swansea Improvements &amp; Tramways Company since the 1930s, and the following year went to Parliament with an abandonment bill. Despite vociferous local opposition, the bill became law as the South Wales Transport Act 1959 (7 &amp; 8 Eliz. 2. c. l).

==Closure==

The railway was closed in two stages. The section from Southend to the pier was closed on 11 October 1959 to facilitate the construction of a special road to the Pier for the buses that were to replace the trains. Then, at 11.52 on Tuesday 5 January 1960, the last train (a ceremonial special, carrying local dignitaries) left Swansea for Mumbles driven by Frank Dunkin, who had worked on the railway since 1907. Within a very short time of the train returning to the Rutland Street depot, work began on dismantling the track and cars.

==Preservation==
One car (no. 2) was saved for preservation by members of Leeds University in Yorkshire and stored for a while at the Middleton Railway in that city, but it was heavily vandalised and eventually destroyed by fire. The front end of car no. 7 was also saved for preservation at Swansea Museum; following many years of neglect it was initially restored in the early 1970s by members of the Railway Club of Wales and is now on display in the Tram Shed alongside the National Waterfront Museum in Swansea&#x27;s Maritime Quarter.

A Mumbles Railway Society was formed in 1975 to formally archive material and to maintain the hope that one day the line would re-open.

==Stations==

The railway had a multitude of stopping places over the years, but at the time of electrification in 1929 the officially recognised stations from Swansea to Mumbles (as published in Bradshaw) were:

*Rutland Street
*St Helen&#x27;s (frequently known as &quot;The Slip&quot;)
*Brynmill
*Ashleigh Road

(Between Ashleigh Road and Blackpill stations the railway was crossed by the LM&amp;SR Central Wales line from Swansea Victoria to Shrewsbury, at a point close to the LM&amp;SR Mumbles Road station. There was a Mumbles Road name board under the bridge on the Mumbles Railway line, but if this was an official stopping place for Mumbles Railway cars it was not recognised as such by Bradshaw.)

*Blackpill
*West Cross
*Norton Road
*Oystermouth
*Southend
*Mumbles Pier (name board read simply &quot;Pier&quot;)

==Railway versus tramway==
The railway is frequently referred to as a tramway, but the original name of the company of proprietors was the &quot;Oystermouth Railway or Tramroad Company&quot;, the word tramroad being used in its pre-railway context. The original right of way was unique and it was only after the construction of the turnpike road in the 1820s that the line assumed its roadside character. The introduction of steam locomotion in the 1870s was facilitated by a clause in the original act which authorised the &quot;haling or drawing&quot; of waggons by &quot;men, horses, &quot;or otherwise&quot;&quot; and owed nothing to the Tramways Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 78).

The passenger rolling stock used in steam days bore little resemblance to conventional railway carriages, employing open-top, &quot;toast-rack&quot; and &quot;knifeboard&quot; seating, and being built by companies more commonly associated with the construction of urban tramcars, such as G.F. Milnes &amp; Co., Starbuck &amp; Falcon, etc. After electrification the resemblance to an urban tramway became more marked with the introduction of the huge Brush-built electric cars and because of the style of operation (the signalling was used only to regulate entry to the passing loops and not to control the actual running of cars). The track was always laid with conventional railway-type rail and not grooved tram-rail and the railway also handled conventional goods wagons (exchanged with the London &amp; North Western Railway (the London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway after January 1923) at Mumbles Road station and with the Great Western Railway at the Swansea terminus). In the early nineteenth century a tramway was a line for mineral wagons (trams), the term railway being used when edge rails replaced plates. The term tramway did not become almost exclusively associated with urban transport systems until after the passing of the Tramways Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 78).

==Suggested re-opening==

On 16 February 2009, the City &amp; County of Swansea started the process of looking at the feasibility of trams for the Swansea bay area again. The ERC (Environment, Regeneration and Culture) Overview Board, which is a policy making committee chaired by Councillor Rob Speht, discussed the options for feasibility work and scheduled tasks to assess the technical, financial and social feasibility of bringing trams back to Swansea.

In 2016 the group were working through a formal constitution and going through the steps to register as a Charitable body.

<text>Steven Earl Riddick (born September 18, 1951) is an American athlete and winner of the gold medal in 4×100 meter relay at the 1976 Summer Olympics.

== Personal life ==

Riddick was raised in Hampton, Virginia. His father was a Church of Christ minister there.

Riddick was a late starter in track, concentrating on team sports until his junior year at high school.

After high school, Riddick attended at Norfolk State University, having been recruited by coach Dick Price. There he met his wife Theresita Renee Coleman.

For the last year of his psychology degree course he ran for the Philadelphia Pioneers track club because his college eligibility had ended. It was a move engineered by Coach Price who put Riddick in contact with the Philadelphia Pioneers coach Alex Woodley.

After graduation in 1975, Riddick moved first to Washington D.C. and then Philadelphia and continued to run for the Philadelphia Pioneers club.

== Track career ==

Riddick attempted to qualify for the 1972 Munich Olympics but was eliminated at the semi-final stage in both the 100 and 200 m at the U.S. Olympic Trials.

In 1975, in Zurich, he ran the fastest automatically timed 100 m of the year at 10.05 s, a time that remained his personal best. He had started that year by causing some amazement and amusement when he ran and won an indoor race in his sweat pants. The reason: he had forgotten his shorts. He won the final in borrowed shorts.

At the 1976 Montreal Olympics, Riddick was eliminated in the semi-final of the 100 m race, but ran the anchor leg for the gold medal-winning American 4 × 100 m relay team (with Harvey Glance, Johnny &#x27;Lam&#x27; Jones, and Millard Hampton). Riddick had finished third in the 100 m final at the U.S. Olympic Trials. He just missed another medal in the 200 m and finished fourth, narrowly passed in the closing stages of the final by Mark Lutz.

Riddick was a member of American 4 × 100 m relay team, which won the 1977 IAAF World Cup with a new world record of 38.03 s (with Cliff Wiley, Bill Collins and Steve Williams). He was also a member of American 4 × 100 m relay team, which won the 1979 Pan American Games(with Mike Roberson, Harvey Glance and Cliff Wiley) and placed second in 1979 IAAF World Cup (with Mike Roberson, Harvey Glance and Mel Lattany).

In 1978, he won the 100 m and anchored the United States 4 × 100 m relay team to victory in the USA versus USSR meet at the University of California&#x27;s Edwards Stadium, and so helping the United States to its first overall victory in the dual meet series since 1969.

Riddick attempted to qualify for the 100 m at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, but was eliminated at the quarter-final stage at the U.S. Olympic Trials.

Surprisingly, Riddick never achieved much success at the USA National Championships outdoors during his career - his best was fourth in the 100 m (in 1974, 1977, 1978 and 1979) and fifth in the 200 m (in 1977 and 1979) - he was, however, twice United States champion indoors at 60 y in 1977 and 1979. His indoor successes in 1977 led him to being voted Track and Field News&#x27;s indoor athlete of the year.

Riddick ran for his college Norfolk State University until 1974 winning NCAA division titles. He then joined the Philadelphia Pioneers track club. The Philadelphia Pioneer Educational Athletic Development Club, the proper name for the Philadelphia Pioneers, were the brainchild of Alexander J. Woodley. During the period 1977–1981, when Riddick was a member, they were the premier track club in the United States.

In 1980, Riddick was inducted into the Athletic Hall of Fame of The Lower Virginia Peninsula.

In 1997, Riddick was inducted into the Hampton Roads African American Sports Hall of Fame.

== Rankings ==

Riddick was ranked among the best in the US and the world in both the 100 and 200 m sprint events from 1973 to 1979, according to the votes of the experts of &quot;Track and Field News&quot;.


== Coaching career ==

After his athletics career, Riddick was a coach at Norfolk State University.

Riddick enjoyed some early success in the role, but his reputation was tarnished when he was embroiled in a scandal over the misappropriation of university travel funds for which he was sacked.

==Money laundering and bank fraud scandal==
In 2006, Riddick was indicted and arrested on fraud charges for his alleged involvement in a money laundering scheme. His former student, Tim Montgomery, was also a defendant in the case and Montgomery&#x27;s former girlfriend, 5-time Olympic medalist sprinter Marion Jones, was also found to have been involved in the operation.

In 2008, Riddick was sentenced to five years and three months in federal prison for counterfeiting checks.

<doc id="1082841" wikidata="Q212126" url="?curid=1082841" title="Fictitious force">
<text>A fictitious force is a force that appears to act on a mass whose motion is described using a non-inertial frame of reference, such as a linearly accelerating or rotating reference frame.
Fictitious forces are invoked to maintain the validity and thus use of Newton&#x27;s second law of motion, in frames of reference which are &quot;not&quot; inertial.

==Measureable examples of fictitious forces==
Passengers in a vehicle accelerating in the forward direction may perceive they are acted upon by a force moving them into the direction of the backrest of their seats for instance. An example in a rotating reference frame may be the impression that it is a force which seems to move objects outward toward the rim of a centrifuge or carousel. 

The fictitious force called a pseudo force might also be referred to as a body force. It is due to an object&#x27;s inertia when the reference frame does not move inertially any more but begins to accelerate relative to the free object. In terms of the example of the passenger vehicle, a pseudo force seems to be active just before the body touches the backrest of the seat in the car. A person in the car leaning forward first moves a bit backward in relation to the already accelerating car before touching the backrest. The motion in this short period seems to be the result of a force on the person; i.e., it is a pseudo force. A pseudo force does not arise from any physical interaction between two objects, such as electromagnetism or contact forces. It is only a consequence of the acceleration of the physical object the non-inertial reference frame is connected to, i.e. the vehicle in this case. From the viewpoint of the respective accelerating frame, an acceleration of the inert object appears to be present, apparently requiring a &quot;force&quot; for this to have happened.

As stated by Iro:
The pseudo force on an object arises as an imaginary influence when the frame of reference used to describe the object&#x27;s motion is accelerating compared to a non-accelerating frame. The pseudo force &quot;explains&quot;, using Newton&#x27;s second law mechanics, why an object does not follow Newton&#x27;s second law and &quot;floats freely&quot; as if weightless. As a frame may accelerate in any arbitrary way, so may pseudo forces also be as arbitrary (but only in direct response to the acceleration of the frame). An example of a pseudo force as defined by Iro is the Coriolis force, maybe better to be called: the Coriolis effect. The gravitational force would also be a fictitious force (pseudo force) in a field model in which particles distort spacetime due to their mass, such as in the theory of general relativity.

Assuming Newton&#x27;s second law in the form F = &quot;m&quot;a, fictitious forces are always proportional to the mass &quot;m&quot;.

The fictitious force that has been called an inertial force is also referred to as a d&#x27;Alembert force, or sometimes as a pseudo force. D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle is just another way of formulating Newton&#x27;s second law of motion. It defines an inertial force as the negative of the product of mass times acceleration, just for the sake of easier calculations.

(A d&#x27;Alembert force is not to be confused with a contact force arising from the physical interaction between two objects, which is the subject of Newton&#x27;s third law – &#x27;action is reaction&#x27;. In terms of the example of the passenger vehicle above, a contact force emerges when the body of the passenger touches the backrest of the seat in the car. It is present for as long as the car is accelerated.)

Four fictitious forces have been defined for frames accelerated in commonly occurring ways:
* one caused by any acceleration relative to the origin in a straight line (rectilinear acceleration);
* two involving rotation: centrifugal force and Coriolis effect
* and a fourth, called the Euler force, caused by a variable rate of rotation, should that occur.

==Background==

The role of fictitious forces in Newtonian mechanics is described by Tonnelat:
Fictitious forces arise in classical mechanics and special relativity in all non-inertial frames.
Inertial frames are privileged over non-inertial frames because they do not have physics whose causes are outside of the system, while non-inertial frames do. Fictitious forces, or physics whose cause is outside of the system, are no longer necessary in general relativity, since these physics are explained with the geodesics of spacetime: &quot;The field of all possible space-time null geodesics or photon paths unifies the absolute local non-rotation standard throughout space-time.&quot;.

==On Earth==
The surface of the Earth is a rotating reference frame. To solve classical mechanics problems exactly in an Earthbound reference frame, three fictitious forces must be introduced: the Coriolis force, the centrifugal force (described below) and the Euler force. The Euler force is typically ignored because the variations in the angular velocity of the rotating surface of the Earth are usually insignificant. Both of the other fictitious forces are weak compared to most typical forces in everyday life, but they can be detected under careful conditions. 

For example, Léon Foucault used his Foucault pendulum to show that the Coriolis force results from the Earth&#x27;s rotation. If the Earth were to rotate twenty times faster (making each day only ~72 minutes long), people could easily get the impression that such fictitious forces were pulling on them, as on a spinning carousel. People in temperate and tropical latitudes would, in fact, need to hold on, in order to avoid being launched into orbit by the centrifugal force.

When moving along the equator in a ship heading in an easterly direction, objects appear to be slightly lighter than on the way back. This phenomenon has been observed and is called the Eötvös effect.

==Detection of non-inertial reference frame==

Observers inside a closed box that is moving with a constant velocity cannot detect their own motion; however, observers within an accelerating reference frame can detect that they are in a non-inertial reference frame from the fictitious forces that arise. For example, for straight-line acceleration Vladimir Arnold presents the following theorem:

Other accelerations also give rise to fictitious forces, as described mathematically below. The physical explanation of motions in an inertial frame is the simplest possible, requiring no fictitious forces: fictitious forces are zero, providing a means to distinguish inertial frames from others.

An example of the detection of a non-inertial, rotating reference frame is the precession of a Foucault pendulum. In the non-inertial frame of the Earth, the fictitious Coriolis force is necessary to explain observations. In an inertial frame outside the Earth, no such fictitious force is necessary.


==Example concerning Circular motion==
The effect of a fictitious force also occurs when a car takes the bend. Observed from a non-inertial frame of reference attached to the car, the fictitious force called the centrifugal force appears. As the car enters a left turn, a suitcase first on the left rear seat slides to the right rear seat and then continues until it comes into contact with the closed door on the right. This motion marks the phase of the fictitious centrifugal force as it is the inertia of the suitcase which plays a role in this piece of movement. It may seem that there must be a force responsible for this movement, but actually, this movement arises because of the inertia of the suitcase, which is (still) a &#x27;free object&#x27; within an already accelerating frame of reference.
After the suitcase has come into contact with the closed door of the car, the situation with the emergence of contact forces becomes current. The centripetal force on the car is now also transferred to the suitcase and the situation of Newton&#x27;s third law comes into play, with the centripetal force as the action part and with the so-called reactive centrifugal force as the reaction part. The reactive centrifugal force is also due to the inertia of the suitcase. Now however the inertia appears in the form of a manifesting resistance to a change in its state of motion.
Suppose a few miles further the car is moving at constant speed travelling a roundabout, again and again, then the occupants will feel as if they are being pushed to the outside of the vehicle by the (reactive) centrifugal force, away from the centre of the turn.

The situation can be viewed from inertial as well as from non-inertial frames.

* From the viewpoint of an inertial reference frame stationary with respect to the road, the car is accelerating toward the centre of the circle. It is accelerating, because the &quot;direction&quot; of the velocity is changing, despite the car having constant speed. This inward acceleration is called centripetal acceleration, it requires a centripetal force to maintain the circular motion. This force is exerted by the ground upon the wheels, in this case, from the friction between the wheels and the road. The car is accelerating, due to the unbalanced force, which causes it to move in a circle. (See also banked turn.)
* From the viewpoint of a rotating frame, moving with the car, a fictitious centrifugal force appears to be present pushing the car toward the outside of the road (and pushing the occupants toward the outside of the car). The centrifugal force balances the friction between wheels and the road, making the car stationary in this non-inertial frame.

A classic example of a fictitious force in circular motion is the experiment of rotating spheres tied by a cord and spinning around their centre of mass. In this case, the identification of a rotating, non-inertial frame of reference can be based upon the vanishing of fictitious forces. In an inertial frame, fictitious forces are not necessary to explain the tension in the string joining the spheres. In a rotating frame, Coriolis and centrifugal forces must be introduced to predict the observed tension.

In the rotating reference frame perceived on the surface of the Earth, a centrifugal force reduces the apparent force of gravity by about one part in a thousand, depending on latitude. This reduction is zero at the poles, maximum at the equator.

The fictitious Coriolis force, which is observed in rotational frames, is ordinarily visible only in very large-scale motion like the projectile motion of long-range guns or the circulation of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere (see Rossby number). Neglecting air resistance, an object dropped from a 50-meter-high tower at the equator will fall 7.7 millimetres eastward of the spot below where it is dropped because of the Coriolis force.
==Fictitious forces and work==
Fictitious forces can be considered to do work, provided that they move an object on a trajectory that changes its energy from potential to kinetic. For example, consider some persons in rotating chairs holding a weight in their outstretched hands. If they pull their hand inward toward their body, from the perspective of the rotating reference frame, they have done work against the centrifugal force. When the weight is let go, it spontaneously flies outward relative to the rotating reference frame, because the centrifugal force does work on the object, converting its potential energy into kinetic. From an inertial viewpoint, of course, the object flies away from them because it is suddenly allowed to move in a straight line. This illustrates that the work done, like the total potential and kinetic energy of an object, can be different in a non-inertial frame than in an inertial one.

==Gravity as a fictitious force==

The notion of &quot;fictitious force&quot; also arises in Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity. All fictitious forces are proportional to the mass of the object upon which they act, which is also true for gravity. This led Albert Einstein to wonder whether gravity could be modeled as a fictitious force. He noted that a freefalling observer in a closed box would not be able to detect the force of gravity; hence, freefalling reference frames are equivalent to inertial reference frames (the equivalence principle). Developing this insight, Einstein formulated a theory with gravity as a fictitious force, and attributed the apparent acceleration due to gravity to the curvature of spacetime. This idea underlies Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity. See the Eötvös experiment.

==Mathematical derivation of fictitious forces ==
===General derivation===
Many problems require use of noninertial reference frames, for example, those involving satellites and particle accelerators. Figure 2 shows a particle with mass &quot;m&quot; and position vector xA(&quot;t&quot;) in a particular inertial frame A. Consider a non-inertial frame B whose origin relative to the inertial one is given by XAB(&quot;t&quot;). Let the position of the particle in frame B be xB(&quot;t&quot;). What is the force on the particle as expressed in the coordinate system of frame B?

To answer this question, let the coordinate axis in B be represented by unit vectors u&quot;j&quot; with &quot;j&quot; any of { 1, 2, 3 } for the three coordinate axes. Then
:formula_1

The interpretation of this equation is that xB is the vector displacement of the particle as expressed in terms of the coordinates in frame B at the time &quot;t&quot;. From frame A the particle is located at:
:formula_2

As an aside, the unit vectors { u&quot;j&quot; } cannot change magnitude, so derivatives of these vectors express only rotation of the coordinate system B. On the other hand, vector XAB simply locates the origin of frame B relative to frame A, and so cannot include rotation of frame B.

Taking a time derivative, the velocity of the particle is:
:formula_3

The second term summation is the velocity of the particle, say vB as measured in frame B. That is:
:formula_4

The interpretation of this equation is that the velocity of the particle seen by observers in frame A consists of what observers in frame B call the velocity, namely vB, plus two extra terms related to the rate of change of the frame-B coordinate axes. One of these is simply the velocity of the moving origin vAB. The other is a contribution to velocity due to the fact that different locations in the non-inertial frame have different apparent velocities due to the rotation of the frame; a point seen from a rotating frame has a rotational component of velocity that is greater the further the point is from the origin.

To find the acceleration, another time differentiation provides:
:formula_5

Using the same formula already used for the time derivative of xB, the velocity derivative on the right is:
:formula_6

Consequently,
{dt^2}=\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{AB}+\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{B} + 2\ \sum_{j=1}^3 v_j \frac{d \mathbf{u}_j}{dt} + \sum_{j=1}^3 x_j \frac{d^2 \mathbf{u}_j}{dt^2}.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

The interpretation of this equation is as follows: the acceleration of the particle in frame A consists of what observers in frame B call the particle acceleration aB, but in addition, there are three acceleration terms related to the movement of the frame-B coordinate axes: one term related to the acceleration of the origin of frame B, namely aAB, and two terms related to the rotation of frame B. Consequently, observers in B will see the particle motion as possessing &quot;extra&quot; acceleration, which they will attribute to &quot;forces&quot; acting on the particle, but which observers in A say are &quot;fictitious&quot; forces arising simply because observers in B do not recognize the non-inertial nature of frame B.

The factor of two in the Coriolis force arises from two equal contributions: (i) the apparent change of an inertially constant velocity with time because rotation makes the direction of the velocity seem to change (a &quot;d&quot;vB/d&quot;t&quot; term) and (ii) an apparent change in the velocity of an object when its position changes, putting it nearer to or further from the axis of rotation (the change in formula_7 due to change in &quot;x j&quot; ).

To put matters in terms of forces, the accelerations are multiplied by the particle mass:
:formula_8

The force observed in frame B, FB = &quot;m&quot;aB is related to the actual force on the particle, FA, by
:formula_9

where:
:formula_10

Thus, problems may be solved in frame B by assuming that Newton&#x27;s second law holds (with respect to quantities in that frame) and treating Ffictitious as an additional force.

Below are a number of examples applying this result for fictitious forces. More examples can be found in the article on centrifugal force.

===Rotating coordinate systems===
A common situation in which noninertial reference frames are useful is when the reference frame is rotating. Because such rotational motion is non-inertial, due to the acceleration present in any rotational motion, a fictitious force can always be invoked by using a rotational frame of reference. Despite this complication, the use of fictitious forces often simplifies the calculations involved.

To derive expressions for the fictitious forces, derivatives are needed for the apparent time rate of change of vectors that take into account time-variation of the coordinate axes. If the rotation of frame &#x27;B&#x27; is represented by a vector Ω pointed along the axis of rotation with the orientation given by the right-hand rule, and with magnitude given by
:formula_11

then the time derivative of any of the three unit vectors describing frame B is
:formula_12

and
:formula_13

as is verified using the properties of the vector cross product. These derivative formulas now are applied to the relationship between acceleration in an inertial frame, and that in a coordinate frame rotating with time-varying angular velocity ω(&quot;t&quot;). From the previous section, where subscript A refers to the inertial frame and B to the rotating frame, setting aAB = 0 to remove any translational acceleration, and focusing on only rotational properties (see Eq. 1):
:formula_14
:formula_15
Collecting terms, the result is the so-called &quot;acceleration transformation formula&quot;:
:formula_16

The physical acceleration aA due to what observers in the inertial frame A call &quot;real external forces&quot; on the object is, therefore, not simply the acceleration aB seen by observers in the rotational frame B, but has several additional geometric acceleration terms associated with the rotation of B. As seen in the rotational frame, the acceleration aB of the particle is given by rearrangement of the above equation as:
:formula_17

The net force upon the object according to observers in the rotating frame is FB = &quot;m&quot;aB. If their observations are to result in the correct force on the object when using Newton&#x27;s laws, they must consider that the additional force Ffict is present, so the end result is FB = FA + Ffict. Thus, the fictitious force used by observers in B to get the correct behaviour of the object from Newton&#x27;s laws equals:
:formula_18

Here, the first term is the &quot;Coriolis force&quot;, the second term is the &quot;centrifugal force&quot;, and the third term is the &quot;Euler force&quot;.

===Orbiting coordinate systems===
As a related example, suppose the moving coordinate system &quot;B&quot; rotates with a constant angular speed ω in a circle of radius &quot;R&quot; about the fixed origin of inertial frame &quot;A&quot;, but maintains its coordinate axes fixed in orientation, as in Figure 3. The acceleration of an observed body is now (see Eq. 1):
:formula_19
where the summations are zero inasmuch as the unit vectors have no time dependence. The origin of the system &quot;B&quot; is located according to frame &quot;A&quot; at:
:formula_20
leading to a velocity of the origin of frame &quot;B&quot; as:
:formula_21

leading to an acceleration of the origin of &quot;B&quot; given by:
:formula_22
Because the first term, which is
formula_23
is of the same form as the normal centrifugal force expression:
formula_24
it is a natural extension of standard terminology (although there is no standard terminology for this case) to call this term a &quot;centrifugal force&quot;. Whatever terminology is adopted, the observers in frame &quot;B&quot; must introduce a fictitious force, this time due to the acceleration from the orbital motion of their entire coordinate frame, that is radially outward away from the centre of rotation of the origin of their coordinate system:
:formula_25
and of magnitude:
:formula_26

This &quot;centrifugal force&quot; has differences from the case of a rotating frame. In the rotating frame the centrifugal force is related to the distance of the object from the origin of frame &quot;B&quot;, while in the case of an orbiting frame, the centrifugal force is independent of the distance of the object from the origin of frame &quot;B&quot;, but instead depends upon the distance of the origin of frame &quot;B&quot; from &quot;its&quot; centre of rotation, resulting in the &quot;same&quot; centrifugal fictitious force for &quot;all&quot; objects observed in frame &quot;B&quot;.

===Orbiting and rotating===
As a combination example, Figure 4 shows a coordinate system &quot;B&quot; that orbits inertial frame &quot;A&quot; as in Figure 3, but the coordinate axes in frame &quot;B&quot; turn so unit vector u1 always points toward the centre of rotation. This example might apply to a test tube in a centrifuge, where vector u1 points along the axis of the tube toward its opening at its top. It also resembles the Earth–Moon system, where the Moon always presents the same face to the Earth. In this example, unit vector u3 retains a fixed orientation, while vectors u1, u2 rotate at the same rate as the origin of coordinates. That is,
:formula_27 formula_28
:formula_29 formula_30
Hence, the acceleration of a moving object is expressed as (see Eq. 1):
:formula_31
where the angular acceleration term is zero for the constant rate of rotation.
Because the first term, which is
formula_32
is of the same form as the normal centrifugal force expression:
formula_24
it is a natural extension of standard terminology (although there is no standard terminology for this case) to call this term the &quot;centrifugal force&quot;. Applying this terminology to the example of a tube in a centrifuge, if the tube is far enough from the center of rotation, |XAB| = &quot;R&quot; ≫ |xB|, all the matter in the test tube sees the same acceleration (the same centrifugal force). Thus, in this case, the fictitious force is primarily a uniform centrifugal force along the axis of the tube, away from the centre of rotation, with a value |Ffict| = ω2 &quot;R&quot;, where &quot;R&quot; is the distance of the matter in the tube from the centre of the centrifuge. It is the standard specification of a centrifuge to use the &quot;effective&quot; radius of the centrifuge to estimate its ability to provide centrifugal force. Thus, the first estimate of centrifugal force in a centrifuge can be based upon the distance of the tubes from the centre of rotation, and corrections applied if needed.

Also, the test tube confines motion to the direction down the length of the tube, so vB is opposite to u1 and the Coriolis force is opposite to u2, that is, against the wall of the tube. If the tube is spun for a long enough time, the velocity vB drops to zero as the matter comes to an equilibrium distribution. For more details, see the articles on sedimentation and the Lamm equation.

A related problem is that of centrifugal forces for the Earth–Moon–Sun system, where three rotations appear: the daily rotation of the Earth about its axis, the lunar-month rotation of the Earth–Moon system about its centre of mass, and the annual revolution of the Earth–Moon system about the Sun. These three motions influence the tides.

===Crossing a carousel===
Figure 5 shows another example comparing the observations of an inertial observer with those of an observer on a rotating carousel. The carousel rotates at a constant angular velocity represented by the vector Ω with magnitude &quot;ω&quot;, pointing upward according to the right-hand rule. A rider on the carousel walks radially across it at a constant speed, in what appears to the walker to be the straight line path inclined at 45° in Figure 5. To the stationary observer, however, the walker travels a spiral path. The points identified on both paths in Figure 5 correspond to the same times spaced at equal time intervals. We ask how two observers, one on the carousel and one in an inertial frame, formulate what they see using Newton&#x27;s laws.

====Inertial observer====
The observer at rest describes the path followed by the walker as a spiral. Adopting the coordinate system shown in Figure 5, the trajectory is described by r(&quot;t&quot;):
:formula_34
where the added π/4 sets the path angle at 45° to start with (just an arbitrary choice of direction), u&quot;R&quot; is a unit vector in the radial direction pointing from the centre of the carousel to the walker at the time &quot;t&quot;. The radial distance &quot;R&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) increases steadily with time according to:
:formula_35
with &quot;s&quot; the speed of walking. According to simple kinematics, the velocity is then the first derivative of the trajectory:
:formula_36
with uθ a unit vector perpendicular to uR at time &quot;t&quot; (as can be verified by noticing that the vector dot product with the radial vector is zero) and pointing in the direction of travel.
The acceleration is the first derivative of the velocity:
:formula_37
The last term in the acceleration is radially inward of magnitude ω2 &quot;R&quot;, which is therefore the instantaneous centripetal acceleration of circular motion. The first term is perpendicular to the radial direction, and pointing in the direction of travel. Its magnitude is 2&quot;sω&quot;, and it represents the acceleration of the walker as the edge of the carousel is neared, and the arc of the circle travelled in a fixed time increases, as can be seen by the increased spacing between points for equal time steps on the spiral in Figure 5 as the outer edge of the carousel is approached.

Applying Newton&#x27;s laws, multiplying the acceleration by the mass of the walker, the inertial observer concludes that the walker is subject to two forces: the inward radially directed centripetal force and another force perpendicular to the radial direction that is proportional to the speed of the walker.

====Rotating observer====
The rotating observer sees the walker travel a straight line from the centre of the carousel to the periphery, as shown in Figure 5. Moreover, the rotating observer sees that the walker moves at a constant speed in the same direction, so applying Newton&#x27;s law of inertia, there is &quot;zero&quot; force upon the walker. These conclusions do not agree with the inertial observer. To obtain agreement, the rotating observer has to introduce fictitious forces that appear to exist in the rotating world, even though there is no apparent reason for them, no apparent gravitational mass, electric charge or what have you, that could account for these fictitious forces.

To agree with the inertial observer, the forces applied to the walker must be exactly those found above. They can be related to the general formulas already derived, namely:
:formula_38
In this example, the velocity seen in the rotating frame is:
:formula_39
with uR a unit vector in the radial direction. The position of the walker as seen on the carousel is:
:formula_40
and the time derivative of Ω is zero for uniform angular rotation. Noticing that
:formula_41
and
:formula_42
we find:
:formula_43
To obtain a straight-line motion in the rotating world, a force exactly opposite in sign to the fictitious force must be applied to reduce the net force on the walker to zero, so Newton&#x27;s law of inertia will predict a straight line motion, in agreement with what the rotating observer sees. The fictitious forces that must be combated are the Coriolis force (first term) and the centrifugal force (second term). (These terms are approximate.) By applying forces to counter these two fictitious forces, the rotating observer ends up applying exactly the same forces upon the walker that the inertial observer predicted were needed.

Because they differ only by the constant walking velocity, the walker and the rotational observer see the same accelerations. From the walker&#x27;s perspective, the fictitious force is experienced as real, and combating this force is necessary to stay on a straight line radial path holding a constant speed. It is like battling a crosswind while being thrown to the edge of the carousel.
===Observation===
Notice that this kinematical discussion does not delve into the mechanism by which the required forces are generated. That is the subject of kinetics. In the case of the carousel, the kinetic discussion would involve perhaps a study of the walker&#x27;s shoes and the friction they need to generate against the floor of the carousel, or perhaps the dynamics of skateboarding if the walker switched to travel by skateboard. Whatever the means of travel across the carousel, the forces calculated above must be realized. A very rough analogy is heating your house: you must have a certain temperature to be comfortable, but whether you heat by burning gas or by burning coal is another problem. Kinematics sets the thermostat, kinetics fires the furnace.

<text>Steroid hormone receptors are found in the nucleus, cytosol, and also on the plasma membrane of target cells. They are generally intracellular receptors (typically cytoplasmic or nuclear) and initiate signal transduction for steroid hormones which lead to changes in gene expression over a time period of hours to days. The best studied steroid hormone receptors are members of the nuclear receptor subfamily 3 (NR3) that include receptors for estrogen (group NR3A) and 3-ketosteroids (group NR3C). In addition to nuclear receptors, several G protein-coupled receptors and ion channels act as cell surface receptors for certain steroid hormones.

A steroid hormone receptor is a protein molecule located either within the cell cytoplasm or nucleus that specifically binds to steroid hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone, leading to the activation or suppression of gene expression and subsequent cellular responses. This interaction is crucial for mediating the physiological effects of steroid hormones in various tissues and organs of the body.

== Types ==
Steroid hormone receptors can be categorized into several types based on their specific ligands and functions:

1.Estrogen Receptors (ER): There are two subtypes, ERα and ERβ, which bind to the hormone estrogen. They regulate gene expression in response to estrogen, playing essential roles in reproductive tissues, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular health.

2. Progesterone Receptors (PR): PRs bind to the hormone progesterone and regulate gene expression in response to its signaling. They are critical for various reproductive processes, including menstruation, pregnancy, and mammary gland development.

3. Androgen Receptors (AR): These receptors bind to androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). They play key roles in the development and function of male reproductive organs, as well as in secondary sexual characteristics and muscle growth.

4. Glucocorticoid Receptors (GR): GRs bind to glucocorticoids like cortisol and regulate gene expression in response to stress and metabolic signals. They are involved in processes such as immune response, metabolism, and stress adaptation.

5. Mineralocorticoid Receptors (MR): MRs primarily bind to mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone and regulate electrolyte balance and blood pressure by controlling ion transport in epithelial cells of the kidney and other tissues.

===Nuclear receptors===

Steroid receptors of the nuclear receptor family are all transcription factors. Depending upon the type of receptor, they are either located in the cytosol and move to the cell nucleus upon activation, or remain in the nucleus waiting for the steroid hormone to enter and activate them. This uptake into the nucleus is facilitated by nuclear localization signal (NLS) found in the hinge region of the receptor. This region of the receptor is covered up by heat shock proteins (HSPs) which bind the receptor until the hormone is present. Upon binding by the hormone the receptor undergoes a conformational change releasing the HSP, and the receptor together with the bound hormone enter the nucleus to act upon transcription.

==== Structure ====

Intracellular steroid hormone receptors share a common structure of four units that are functionally homologous, so-called &quot;domains&quot;:

# &quot;Variable domain&quot;: It begins at the N-terminal and is the most variable domain between the different receptors.
# &quot;DNA binding domain&quot;: This centrally located highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) consists of two non-repetitive globular motifs where zinc is coordinated with four cysteine and no histidine residues. Their secondary and tertiary structure is distinct from that of classic zinc fingers. This region controls which gene will be activated. On DNA it interacts with the hormone response element (HRE).
# &quot;Hinge region&quot;: This area controls the movement of the receptor to the nucleus.
# &quot;Hormone binding domain&quot;: The moderately conserved ligand-binding domain (LBD) can include a nuclear localization signal, amino-acid sequences capable of binding chaperones and parts of dimerization interfaces. Such receptors are closely related to chaperones (namely heat shock proteins hsp90 and hsp56), which are required to maintain their inactive (but receptive) cytoplasmic conformation. At the end of this domain is the C-terminal. The terminal connects the molecule to its pair in the homodimer or heterodimer. It may affect the magnitude of the response.

==== Mechanism of action ====

===== Genomic =====

Depending on their mechanism of action and subcellular distribution, nuclear receptors may be classified into at least two classes. Nuclear receptors that bind steroid hormones are all classified as type I receptors. Only type I receptors have a heat shock protein (HSP) associated with the inactive receptor that will be released when the receptor interacts with the ligand. Type I receptors may be found in homodimer or heterodimer forms. Type II nuclear receptors have no HSP, and in contrast to the classical type I receptor are located in the cell nucleus.

Free (that is, unbound) steroids enter the cell cytoplasm and interact with their receptor. In this process heat shock protein is dissociated, and the activated receptor-ligand complex is translocated into the nucleus. It is also related to EAATs.

After binding to the ligand (steroid hormone), steroid receptors often form dimers. In the nucleus, the complex acts as a transcription factor, augmenting or suppressing transcription particular genes by its action on DNA.

Type II receptors are located in the nucleus. Thus, their ligands pass through the cell membrane and cytoplasm and enter the nucleus where they activate the receptor without release of HSP. The activated receptor interacts with the hormone response element and the transcription process is initiated as with type I receptors.

===== Non-genomic =====
The cell membrane aldosterone receptor has shown to increase the activity of the basolateral Na/K ATPase, ENaC sodium channels and ROMK potassium channels of the principal cell in the distal tubule and cortical collecting duct of nephrons (as well as in the large bowel and possibly in sweat glands).

There is some evidence that certain steroid hormone receptors can extend through lipid bilayer membranes at the surface of cells and might be able to interact with hormones that remain outside cells.

Steroid hormone receptors can also function outside the nucleus and couple to cytoplasmic signal transduction proteins such as PI3k and Akt kinase.

===Other===

Steroid hormone receptors exert their effects through several mechanisms, including:

1. Gene Regulation: Upon ligand binding, steroid hormone receptors translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to specific DNA sequences called hormone response elements (HREs) within the regulatory regions of target genes. This binding either activates or suppresses gene transcription, leading to changes in mRNA levels and ultimately protein synthesis.

2. Transcriptional Coactivators and Corepressors: Steroid hormone receptors recruit coactivator or corepressor proteins to the gene promoter regions, which modulate the activity of RNA polymerase and other transcriptional machinery, thereby influencing gene expression.

3. Chromatin Remodeling: Steroid hormone receptors can also induce changes in chromatin structure through the recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes. This allows for accessibility of the transcriptional machinery to specific gene regulatory regions, facilitating or inhibiting gene transcription.

4. Non-Genomic Signaling: In addition to classical genomic actions, steroid hormone receptors can initiate rapid, non-genomic signaling pathways in the cytoplasm or at the cell membrane. These pathways involve activation of various protein kinases and other signaling molecules, leading to rapid cellular responses such as ion fluxes, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and activation of second messenger systems.

5. Cross-Talk with Other Signaling Pathways: Steroid hormone receptors can also interact with and modulate the activity of other signaling pathways, such as growth factor signaling pathways, thereby integrating hormonal and growth factor signals to regulate cellular processes.

A new class of steroid hormone receptors has recently been elucidated and these new receptors are found on the cell membrane. New studies suggest that along with the well documented intracellular receptors that cell membrane receptors are present for several steroid hormones and that their cellular responses are much quicker than the intracellular receptors.

==== G protein-coupled receptors ====
GPCR linked proteins most likely interact with steroid hormones through an amino acid consensus sequence traditionally thought of as a cholesterol recognition and interaction site. About a third of Class A GPCRs contain this sequence. The steroid hormones themselves are different enough from one another that they do not all affect all of the GPCR linked proteins; however, the similarities between the steroid hormones and between the receptors make plausible the argument that each receptor may respond to multiple steroid hormones or that each hormone could affect multiple receptors. This is contrary to the traditional model of having a unique receptor for each unique ligand.

At least four different GPCR-linked proteins are known to respond to steroid hormones. GPR30 binds estrogen, membrane progestin receptor (mPR) binds progesterone, and GPRC6A binds androgens. As an example of the effects of these GPCR-linked proteins consider GPR30. GPR30 binds estrogen, and upon binding estrogen this pathway activates adenylyl cyclase and epidermal growth factor receptor. It results in vasodilation, renoprotection, mammary gland development, etc.

Sulfated steroids and bile acids are also detected by vomeronasal receptors, specifically the V1 family.

==== Ion channels ====

Neuroactive steroids bind to and modulate the activity of several ion channels including the GABAA, NMDA, and sigma receptors.

The steroid progesterone has been found to modulate the activity of CatSper (cation channels of sperm) voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Since eggs release progesterone, sperm may use progesterone as a homing signal to swim toward eggs (chemotaxis).

==== SHBG/SHBG-R complex ====

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is thought to mainly function as a transporter and reservoir for the estradiol and testosterone sex hormones. However it has also been demonstrated that SHBG can bind to a cell surface receptor (SHBG-R). The SHBG-R has not been completely characterized. A subset of steroids are able to bind to the SHBG/SHBG-R complex resulting in an activation of adenylyl cyclase and synthesis of the cAMP second messenger. Hence the SHBG/SHBG-R complex appears to act as a transmembrane steroid receptor that is capable of transmitting signals to the interior of cells.

<text>The Super Harvard Architecture Single-Chip Computer (SHARC) is a high performance floating-point and fixed-point DSP from Analog Devices. SHARC is used in a variety of signal processing applications ranging from audio processing, to single-CPU guided artillery shells to 1000-CPU over-the-horizon radar processing computers. The original design dates to about January 1994.

SHARC processors are typically intended to have a good number of serial links to other SHARC processors nearby, to be used as a low-cost alternative to SMP.

==Architecture==
The SHARC is a Harvard architecture word-addressed VLIW processor; it knows nothing of 8-bit or 16-bit values since each address is used to point to a whole 32-bit word, not just an octet. It is thus neither little-endian nor big-endian, though a compiler may use either convention if it implements 64-bit data and/or some way to pack multiple 8-bit or 16-bit values into a single 32-bit word. In C, the characters are 32-bit as they are the smallest addressable words by standard.

The word size is 48-bit for instructions, 32-bit for integers and normal floating-point, and 40-bit for extended floating-point. Code and data are normally fetched from on-chip memory, which the user must split into regions of different word sizes as desired. Small data types may be stored in wider memory, simply wasting the extra space. A system that does not use 40-bit extended floating-point might divide the on-chip memory into two sections, a 48-bit one for code and a 32-bit one for everything else. Most memory-related CPU instructions can not access all the bits of 48-bit memory, but a special 48-bit register is provided for this purpose. The special 48-bit register may be accessed as a pair of smaller registers, allowing movement to and from the normal registers.

Off-chip memory can be used with the SHARC. This memory can only be configured for one single size. If the off-chip memory is configured as 32-bit words to avoid waste, then only the on-chip memory may be used for code execution and extended floating-point. Operating systems may use overlays to work around this problem, transferring 48-bit data to on-chip memory as needed for execution. A DMA engine is provided for this. True paging is impossible without an external MMU.

The SHARC has a 32-bit word-addressed address space. Depending on word size this is 16 GB, 20 GB, or 24 GB (using the common definition of an 8-bit &quot;byte&quot;).

SHARC instructions may contain a 32-bit immediate operand. Instructions without this operand are generally able to perform two or more operations simultaneously. Many instructions are conditional, and may be preceded with &quot;if &quot;condition&quot; &quot; in the assembly language. There are a number of &quot;condition&quot; choices, similar to the choices provided by the x86 flags register.

There are two delay slots. After a jump, two instructions following the jump will normally be executed.

The SHARC processor has built-in support for loop control. Up to 6 levels may be used, avoiding the need for normal branching instructions and the normal bookkeeping related to loop exit.

The SHARC has two full sets of general-purpose registers. Code can instantly switch between them, allowing for fast context switches between an application and an OS or between two threads.

<text>Intergang is a fictional organized crime syndicate appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Armed with technology supplied by the villainous New Gods of the planet Apokolips, they consistently appear as enemies of Superman.

Intergang appears in the TV series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, &quot;Supergirl&quot;, &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;, the cartoons &quot;&quot;, &quot;Young Justice&quot;, and &quot;My Adventures with Superman&quot; as well as the DC Extended Universe film &quot;Black Adam&quot; (2022).

==Publication history==
Intergang first appeared in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; #133 (October 1970) and was created by Jack Kirby. Members of Intergang were first shown in the first issue of Kirby&#x27;s &quot;Forever People&quot; in 1971.

==Fictional organization history==
===Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
Intergang was founded in the 1920s by a gangster, Moxie &quot;Boss&quot; Mannheim, who was later killed by rivals. It was then revived by Morgan Edge and run by Boss Moxie&#x27;s son Bruno &quot;Ugly&quot; Mannheim. Bruno was, however, getting orders and weaponry from Darkseid, who was using Intergang to help track down the Anti-Life Equation.

Morgan Edge was the head of the Galaxy Broadcasting System television network (which had recently purchased the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; and had Clark Kent transferred to its Metropolis affiliate WGBS-TV as its anchorman). It was later revealed that this was not the real Morgan Edge, but a clone from the &quot;Evil Factory&quot;. When the clone could not bring itself to kill the original Edge at the order of Darkseid, the real Edge was imprisoned. The original Edge would later escape with the help of Jimmy Olsen. During an ensuing battle with Intergang, the clone was mistaken for the original by Intergang hitman Tombstone Gear and incinerated. The real Edge was soon free to resume his role as Galaxy&#x27;s president.

Following the clone&#x27;s death, different Intergang members had to run Intergang in Edge&#x27;s absence. Joe Danton was the first to run Intergang and he was later killed by a car bomb. Then Max Danner became the new Intergang leader. He led Intergang in some criminal activities until he got apprehended. Clark Kent appeared as a key witness until he had to briefly leave to rescue Mr. Xavier. The outcome of the trial was not shown. When Intergang was dissolved, SKULL took over their territories. When a SKULL assassin was sent after Intergang crime boss Samuel Simeon, he was saved by Superman, though he was later apprehended by Superman trying to start a new mob outside of Metropolis.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;===

In the Post-Crisis DC Universe, Morgan Edge was the leader of Intergang, until he suffered a heart attack due to stress. While he believed he was working for Darkseid, his Apokoliptian contact was actually DeSaad, whose only aim in supplying him with weaponry was to cause suffering. While he was in the hospital his legitimate businesses were taken over by his father Vincent Edge, and Intergang was taken over by Bruno &quot;Ugly&quot; Mannheim, who trained on Apokolips with Granny Goodness. A later retcon has it that Mannheim was the original leader of Intergang, dealing knowingly with DeSaad. How Edge took over is unrevealed.

Eventually, Intergang was brought down by Clark Kent and Cat Grant, Mannheim was arrested, but managed to escape. He attempted to disappear through a &quot;Boom Tube&quot; (a New Gods transporter), but it collapsed when he was halfway through.

Some time later, Mannheim&#x27;s father &quot;Boss&quot; Moxie Mannheim, a gangster who had been in prison since the 1940s after being captured by the Newsboy Legion, was released. Discovering that the Newsboys were, seemingly, the same age as when he first fought them, he determined to find out how such a thing could be. Meeting renegade Project Cadmus geneticist Dabney Donovan, he arranged for himself and his dead gang members from the 1940s to be cloned into youthful bodies with superpowers which involved Dabney having to do some grave robbing. This led to his henchmen Ginny &quot;Torcher&quot; McCree, Mike &quot;Machine&quot; Gun, Noose, and Rough House being cloned and receiving superpowers. Using Vincent Edge to arrange a meeting between Metropolis&#x27; gang-leaders, an older clone of Moxie exploded enough to kill them all with Noose killing Vincent Edge. As Dabney Donovan went to look for fresh DNA samples to make use of, Moxie declared himself the new head of Intergang. The new Intergang spent much of their time tracking down Jimmy Olsen, whom Moxie believed knew Superman&#x27;s secret identity.

Following a short-lived attempt by Morgan Edge to regain control, Lex Luthor gained control of Intergang, retaining Moxie as a figurehead. Moxie and his remaining lieutenants were later captured by Superman. When last seen, Intergang was run by a criminal cyberneticist named Frank Sixty.

Intergang is later seen in Metropolis robbing a bank during the Justice League&#x27;s absence, only to be stopped and beaten by the Avengers.

===Infinite Crisis===
There was some suggestion that Boss Moxie (who was a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains at the time) was slain during the miniseries &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. The suggestion comes from a sequence during the Battle of Metropolisuring which Superboy-Prime snaps a villain&#x27;s neck, killing him. In an interview DC editor-in-chief Dan DiDio confirmed that Boss Moxie did indeed die in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #7 by stating that Superboy-Prime snapped his neck.

===52===
In the pages of &quot;52&quot;, Intergang members Noose and Rough House visit Kahndaq and offer Adrianna Tomaz as tribute to Black Adam in exchange for safe passage for their group&#x27;s smuggling activity. Both of them are killed by Black Adam.

In week 9, Question tells Renee Montoya that Intergang is preparing for an invasion of Gotham City. Two weeks later, the pair finally have a confrontation with the two operatives of Intergang in Gotham, Whisper A&#x27;Daire and Kyle Abbot, known in the public eye as the manager of &quot;HSC International Banking&quot;, an holding connected to Intergang itself, and her bodyguard. In the weeks that follow, the further investigations of Montoya and the Question reveal Intergang to be operating a mining company called Ridge Ferrick in regions such as Australia, and also having expanded into nations such as Oolong Island, Bialya, and Yemen, reorganized along quasi-religious lines, complete with a &quot;holy&quot; text known variously as the Book of Crime or the Crime Bible, which treats Cain as a heroic, if not semi-divine, figure for his role according to Judeo-Christian theology in creating the &quot;most sacred&quot; crime of murder. It has even been revealed that the original text is bound by the stone with which Cain slew Abel. In issue #25, Bruno Mannheim was revealed as the current head of Intergang, which is also behind the kidnapping of many of the world&#x27;s &quot;mad scientists&quot;, in a grand plan to take over America by the end of the year. He shows himself now acting like a cult leader, exalting the power of crime as the dominant order in the 21st century, and now becoming a cannibal, eating anyone he kills who refuses to join Intergang. At the same time, Magpie and Ventriloquist swear their allegiance to Intergang.

Bruno &quot;Ugly&quot; Mannheim returns as a giant wielding alien technology, claiming that someone other than Darkseid is behind Intergang&#x27;s current activities.

===Gotham Underground===
In &quot;Gotham Underground&quot;, Intergang is in a gang war with Tobias Whale. Intergang buys him out and makes Tobias Whale the CEO of Kord Enterprises, which has become a front for Intergang&#x27;s criminal activities.

===The New 52===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. Gotham City has fallen to Intergang&#x27;s Religion of Crime branch. During a gunfight between his gang and the police, Mister Untouchable claimed that Intergang has cut him out of the action occurring in Metropolis by selling the location of their meth laboratory to the law enforcement.

Attackers from Intergang ambush Lois Lane and Jon Kent when she was driving him home from school. They run Lois&#x27; car off the road and into the woods. While Jon knocks out one of the attackers, Lois contacts Superman who defeats the attackers. Later at their barn, Lois and Clark figure out that their attackers are from Intergang and had followed Lois from her meeting with Cora Benning suspecting that she is &quot;Author X&quot;. Bruno Mannheim was informed by two of his men that the attack on &quot;Author X&quot; has failed. He throws the two men into the swimming pool and electrifies it. Lois and Jon later visit Cora Benning&#x27;s office and find a note stating that she was taken by Intergang. While leaving the office, the three of them encounter Bruno Mannheim in the hall who claims that he is asking for directions. Lois thinks to herself that Mannheim is trying to get her to lower her guard. When Lois goes to pick up Jon from school and finds him in the library, they are ambushed by Intergang agents who then trap them in a tool closet which they set on fire. Jon&#x27;s superpowers manifest as he manages to break down the door. When Jon gets Lois out of the burning tool closet, they are then surrounded by Intergang thugs. Breaking off his fight with Blackrock, Superman manages to save Lois and Jon as the Intergang thugs are caught in the explosion.

<text>Uppsala öd (Old Norse: &quot;Uppsala auðr&quot; or &quot;Uppsala øðr&quot;, meaning &quot;Uppsala domains&quot; or &quot;wealth of Uppsala&quot;) was the name given to the collection of estates which was the property of the Swedish Crown in medieval Sweden. Its purpose was to finance the Swedish king, originally the &quot;king of Uppsala&quot;, and the income from these estates supported the king and his retinue while he travelled through the country. There was one estate of this kind in most hundreds and it was usually called &quot;Husaby&quot;. It was the home of the king&#x27;s tax collector, and it was at the local estate of Uppsala öd that the people of the hundred delivered their taxes in form of goods. The estates were most common in Svealand.

The origins of Uppsala öd are prehistoric and unknown, but according to a tradition documented by the thirteenth-century historian Snorri Sturluson it originated as a donation given by the god Freyr to the Temple at Uppsala which he founded.

It was stated in the Swedish medieval laws that Uppsala öd was to follow the royal institution intact without any lost property. The full extent of Uppsala öd is unknown, but individual estates are enumerated in the &quot;Law of Hälsingland&quot; and in the younger &quot;Westrogothic law&quot;.

During the thirteenth century, the system became obsolete for the king and many of the estates passed to the nobility and the church, in spite of the laws that forbade any diminution of the property. The reason for this was that the king&#x27;s subjects began to pay monetary taxes.

Uppsala öd contained the first documented pieces of what would become Swedish State property.

<text>Bharathidasan (IPA: ; born K. Subburathinam 29 April 1891 – 21 April 1964) was a 20th-century Tamil poet and rationalist writer whose literary works handled mostly socio-political issues. He was deeply influenced by the Tamil poet Subramania Bharathi and named himself &quot;Bharathi dasan&quot; meaning follower or adherent of Bharathi. His greatest influence was Periyar and his self-respect movement. Bharathidasan&#x27;s writings served as a catalyst for the growth of the Self-Respect Movement in Tamil Nadu. In addition to poetry, his views found expression in other forms such as plays, film scripts, short stories and essays. The Government of Puducherry union territory has adopted the song of Invocation to Mother Tamil, written by Bharathidasan as the state song of Puducherry (Tamil Thai Valthu (Puducherry)).

== Life ==
Kanaka Subburathinam was born in Puducherry (earlier called Pondicherry) on 29 April 1891 to Kanagasabai Mudaliar and Lakshmi Ammal. He was deeply influenced by the Tamil poet and freedom fighter, Subramania Bharathi, who mentored him and hence Subburathinam named himself &quot;Bharathi dasan&quot; meaning follower or adherent of Bharathi. He is popularly known as Bharathidasan (Tamil: ). A twentieth century Tamil poet, Bharathidasan was an active participant in the Indian independence movement, he opposed both the British Raj and the French colonial government. He was imprisoned for voicing his views against the French Government that was ruling Pondicherry at that time. Bharathidasan was a poet in his own right, writing mostly on socio-political issues like women’s liberation, rationalism, and against caste discrimination. He was greatly influenced by the great rationalist leader and social reformer, Periyar E. V. Ramaswami. Bharathidasan became one of the key figures in the Dravidian rationalist movement. He was bestowed the titles ‘puratchi kavinjar’ (revolutionary poet) and &#x27;paa vendhar&#x27; (king of poetry) to honor his excellence in Tamil poetry and he was widely known by his titles. Bharathidasan works were nationalized meaning brought into public domain in 1991 by the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M. Karunanidhi. Bharathidasan&#x27;s works can be found at the open access Tamil literature repository Project Madurai.

He remained a prolific writer and poet till he died on 21 April 1964, a week before his 73rd birthday. He was awarded the Sahitya Academy Award posthumously for his Tamil play &quot;Pisiraandhaiyaar&quot;. One among his famous lines is ‘அறிவை விரிவு செய், அகண்டமாக்கு’, ‘Arivai virivu sei, agandamakku’ meaning “Expand knowledge – make it universal”. Named after this great poet, it has been Bharathidasan institute of management&#x27;s endeavour to expand and universalize knowledge.

Named after the revolutionary poet Bharathidasan, the Bharathidasan University was set up in 1982 as an offshoot of the University of Madras. The motto of the University “We will create a brave new world” has been framed from Bharathidasan’s poetic words “புதியதோர் உலகம் செய்வோம்”. The University endeavours to be true to such a vision by creating in the region a brave new world of academic innovation for social change.

<text>Kratonohy is a municipality and village in Hradec Králové District in the Hradec Králové Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 600 inhabitants.

==Administrative division==
Kratonohy consists of two municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):
*Kratonohy (554)
*Michnovka (62)

==Etymology==
The name of Kratonohy is derived from the Old Czech words &quot;kratonožka, kraťnoha&quot;, which were mocking designations for short-legged people. The name is believed to be originating from the 11th or the 12th century.

According to the legend which aimed to cover up the derogatory name, Kratonohy was founded by Býd, the son of Count Slavomil of Kouřim, at the place where he rested with his people for three days. The legend says that the name was derived from &quot;shortening the legs&quot;, which figuratively meant &#x27;tired legs&#x27;.

==Geography==
Kratonohy is located about west of Hradec Králové. It lies in a flat agricultural landscape of the East Elbe Table. The highest point is the hill Medenec at above sea level.

==History==
The first written mention of Kratonohy is from 1316, the village of Michnovka was first mentioned in 1720. In the 14th century, a fortress probably existed here, but the oldest written record about the citadel comes from the 16th century. In the second half of the 14th century, owners of the village were the lords of Častolovice, Licek of Kratonohy and Perchta, daughter of Sezema of Kostomlaty. Perchta made a donation of some estates to St. George&#x27;s Convent in Prague. From 1407 to 1467, Kratonohy was owned by Hroch of Dobřenice and brothers Jiří and Adam Dobřenský.

In 1623, Kratonohy was bought by Alžběta Vchynská of Vchynice na Chlumci. The homestead had been held by the Kinsky family to 1644, but due to mortgages, they sold it to Asterles of Asterfeld. During the 18th century, the Kratonohy estate was merged with Chlumec estate.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
Kratonohy is located on the railway line Hradec Králové–Chlumec nad Cidlinou.

==Sights==

The gate of the homestead was built after 1720 by Jan Santini Aichel or his descendants. It is now the property of an agricultural company and intensively modified.

The Church of Saint James the Great is a Gothic-based building, rebuilt in the Baroque style in 1707–1710. It has an inwrought interior with an unusual solution: the altar was made as grotto and the rostrum as whale. The altar is a reproduction of a Spanish altar of Saint James the Great from Santiago de Compostela. The wife of manor owner Jan Adam Michna from Vacínov was Spanish, thus it is believed that its interior is the work of Spanish artists. It is one of the most impressive rural church interiors in the country.

==Notable people==
*Rudolf Medek (1890–1940), poet and writer; taught here at school in 1910–1913
*Jaroslav Čihák (1891–1944), army officer
*Petr Kostka (born 1938), actor; lived and studied here

<doc id="1082865" wikidata="Q291233" url="?curid=1082865" title="Churchill River (Atlantic)">
<text>The Churchill River, formerly known by other names, is a river in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It flows east from the Smallwood Reservoir into the Atlantic Ocean via Lake Melville. The river is long and drains an area of , making it the longest river in Atlantic Canada.

==Names==
The Innu name of the river is &#x27; or &#x27; (&quot;Grand River&quot;) among the Labrador Innu and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Churchill Falls River&quot;) among the Central Innu, the Labrador Métis (NunatuKavut), and Nunatsiavut. The latter name was formerly calqued into English as the , the name commonly used by locals.

In 1821, Captain William Martin of HM brig &quot;Clinker&quot; renamed the river the after the then-current commodore-governor of Newfoundland Charles Hamilton. The name gradually supplanted use of the Grand River before being replaced on 1 February 1965 by provincial premier Joey Smallwood. Smallwood renamed it the &quot;Churchill River&quot; after the former British prime minister Winston Churchill ahead of the beginning of construction on the river&#x27;s major hydroelectric project.

In 2022, MHA Perry Trimper called for Churchill&#x27;s name to be removed from the river in favour of either &quot;Grand River&quot; or its Innu name.

== Geography==

The river flows in an arc, first north from Ashuanipi Lake though the saucer-shaped Labrador Plateau, and then mainly east through a series of lakes. Several of these lakes have been flooded to create the Smallwood Reservoir. The river then flows through a rocky canyon which is hundreds of feet deep, over Churchill Falls, and through a series of rapids below the falls. The water flow in the canyon has been mainly diverted underground through a giant hydroelectric power generating plant. The river continues eastward until it flows into Lake Melville.

== Hydroelectric projects ==

Churchill Falls is the site of a major hydroelectric project, which diverted almost all of the stream that once fell over Churchill Falls. It presently has a capacity of 5,428 MW and other slated hydroelectric plants on the river will bring the total to over 9,200 MW. The Churchill Falls development has become a source of friction between two Canadian provinces, as Newfoundland and Labrador asserts that Quebec&#x27;s Hydro-Québec (despite having provided a major part of the financing and access to the North American power grid) has taken a disproportionate share of the development&#x27;s profits. Hydro-Québec still buys power from the dam at rates established in the 1969 power purchase agreement.

==U-boat==
In 2012 divers using side scan sonar found what they believe is the wreck of a U-boat just downstream of Muskrat Falls, validating a local legend. However, examination of historical records shows this to be unlikely, and the sonar images were quite grainy.

<text>Limigiano is a &quot;frazione&quot; of the &quot;comune&quot; of Bevagna in the Province of Perugia, Umbria, central Italy. It stands at an elevation of 333 metres above sea level. At the time of the Istat census of 2001 it had 56 inhabitants.

Limigiano is a rural village, surrounded by large olive groves.

The main point of interest is the Romanesque abbey church of &quot;San Michele Arcangelo&quot;. While the foundations are from the 11th century, the current structure dates back to the 13th century. The church was extended and altered through several phases of construction, repair, and maintenance in the Middle Ages. Today the church has a naves and two aisles, each finishing in an apse. The church was renovated in 1947 but the beautiful frescoes (some probably by the school of Niccolò Alunno) are in various stages of deterioration, mostly due to the damage from the 1997 Umbria and Marche earthquake and the leaking in of rainwater since then. Of the medieval castle only a few ruins can be found.

<text>The Battle of Cape Kaliakra (Kaliakria, Caliacria; ) was the last naval battle of the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792). It took place on 11 August 1791 off the coast of Cape Kaliakra, Bulgaria, in the Black Sea. Neither side lost a ship, but the Ottomans retreated to Istanbul afterwards.

The Russian fleet under Counter (Rear) Admiral Fyodor Ushakov, of 15 ships of the line and two frigates (990 guns), and several small craft sailed from Sevastopol on 8 August, and at midday on 11 August encountered the Ottoman–Algerian fleet under Hussein Pasha of 18 ships of the line and 17 frigates (1,500–1,600 guns) and some smaller craft at anchor just south of Cape Kaliakra. Ushakov sailed, in three columns, from the northeast, between the Ottomans and the cape, despite the presence on the cape of several guns.

Admiral Said Ali, the commander of the Algerian ships, weighed anchor and sailed east, followed by Hussein Pasha with the 18 ships of the line. The Russians then turned around south to a parallel east-south-east course and formed up mostly into one line, with Ushakov in third position and one ship out of line on the off-battle side. Said Ali, leading the line, turned north to try to double the Russian van, but Ushakov sailed out of the line and attacked him, as the rest of the Russian fleet approached. This was at 16:45 (4:45 p.m.). Gradually the Turks turned to the south and when darkness put an end to fighting at 20:30 (8:30 p.m.) they were in full retreat to Istanbul. Russian casualties were 17 killed and 28 wounded, and the frigate &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; was damaged. Ottoman casualty figures are unknown, but their ships were heavily damaged aloft.

==Ships involved==
Some of the Russian vessels involved and their crew were:

<text>Maungatua, known also as Mauka Atua is a prominent ridge in the Taieri Plains in Otago, New Zealand.

It rises above the floodplain of the Taieri River, directly to the west of Dunedin&#x27;s airport at Momona. It can be clearly seen from much of Dunedin&#x27;s urban area, , and from as far south as the outskirts of Balclutha, to the southwest. Lake Mahinerangi is located on the western side of Maungatua.

The name Maungatua in Māori literally means &quot;Hill of the Spirits&quot;, and is spelt Mauka Atua by Ngāi Tahu local to the Otago Region. The name is a reference to an ancestral chief who arrived on the &quot;Āraiteuru&quot; migratory waka.

== Ecology of Maungatua ==
Maungatua features a diverse range of plant species. The summit features tussock grassland and cushion bogs, whilst the sub-alpine zone includes shrubland and tussock grasslands. Carnivorous insect eating plants called sundews are found within swamps at the summit. Silver beech dominates the montane slopes, particularly on the southern face. This transitions to lowland podocarp forest which extends into the Waipori Gorge. This includes a mixture of broadleaf and kānuka forest. In addition, the only naturally-occurring kāmahi in the Dunedin area are found in the southern Maungatua in Mill Creek. Glowworms may also be found living in mānuka trees at the base of Maungatua.

<text>A hot plate or hotplate is a heated flat surface on a stove or electric cooker on which food may be cooked, either built into an electric cooker or kitchen stove, or portable, plugged into an electric outlet.

Hot plates can also be used as a heat source in laboratories.

==Description==

A hot plate or hotplate is a heated flat surface on a stove or electric cooker on which food may be cooked. It comprises a heated top which is flat and usually circular, and may be made of metal, ceramic, or heat-resistant glass, with resistive wire forming a heating element fitted underneath and a thermostat to control the temperature. An electric current is passed through the wire, heating it; the thermostat controls the temperature the top reaches.

A hotplate may be a portable self-contained tabletop small appliance cooktop, or incorporated into an electric cooker or kitchen stove. Portable hot plates are often used for food preparation, generally in locations where a full kitchen stove would not be convenient or practical.

==In laboratories==

Hotplates are used in laboratories, outside the domestic environment, mainly for heating, and possibly continuously stirring, liquids.

In laboratory settings, hot plates are generally used to heat glassware or its contents. Some hot plates provide an integrated magnetic stirrer, allowing a heated liquid to be stirred automatically.
In a student laboratory, hot plates are used because baths can be hazards if they spill, overheat or ignite because they have high thermal inertia (meaning they take a long time to cool down) and mantles can be very expensive and are designed for specific flask volumes.

Two alternative methods for heating glassware using a hotplate are available. One method is to suspend glassware slightly above the surface of the plate with no direct contact. This not only reduces the temperature of the glass, but it also slows down the rate of heat exchange and encourages even heating. This works well for low boiling point operations or when a heat source&#x27;s minimum temperature is high. Another method, called a teepee setup because it looks a little like a tipi, is to suspend glassware above a plate and surround the flask by a skirt of tinfoil. The skirt should start at the neck of the flask and drape down to the surface of the plate, not touching the sides of the flask, but covering the majority of the plates surface. This method is for glassware to be heated at higher temperatures because the flask is warmed indirectly by the hot air collecting under the skirt and unlike simply suspending the glassware, this method is better protected from drafts. Both these methods are useful in a student laboratory as they are cheaper, effective, safe, and the user does not have to wait for a bath to cool down after use.

==Industrial hot plates==
Hot plates are widely used for many industrial applications. These hot plates vary in size, from 2 to over 300 square centimetres.

Typical operating temperatures vary from 100 to 750°C (212 to 1,382°F) and power requirements are usually in the 120 to 480 volt range. Most industrial hot plates will withstand a weight of more than 150 pounds (68 kilos).

Industrial hot plates which incorporate a porous heated plate are referred to as &quot;heated chucks.&quot; These plates, widely used in semiconductor manufacture, are used to heat thin sheets evenly by drawing the sheets firmly on the plate by suction.

Corrosion-resistant hotplates using special material and protective coatings are used in mining and related industries to heat samples of toxic chemicals.

Hot plates are widely used in the electronics industry as a method of soldering and desoldering components on circuit boards.

Hot plates with two heating surfaces are used to fuse plastic pipes, which may have a diameter exceeding 90 centimeters. The two pipes to be fused are pressed against the plate till the edges are soft. The plate is removed and the two pipes are pressed together and bonded. This process is called &quot;butt fusion&quot;.

<doc id="1082890" wikidata="Q1189259" url="?curid=1082890" title="One Hour by the Concrete Lake">
<text>One Hour by the Concrete Lake is Pain of Salvation&#x27;s second studio album. It is a concept album focusing on the issues of nuclear power and waste, displacement of indigenous peoples, the firearm industry, and human discovery.

==Release history==
&quot;One Hour by the Concrete Lake&quot; was first released by Avalon Records in Japan in July 1998. It was later released in Europe in January 1999 on InsideOut, in the USA in November 1999 on InsideOut America and in South America in November 1999 on Hellion.

==Overview==
&quot;One Hour by the Concrete Lake&quot; takes a more thorough and factual approach to its concept than its predecessor, Entropia. A number of facts are given in the album booklet, with a list of sources provided at the end. The chronological order of songs is the same as the track order (as opposed to &quot;Entropia&quot;) and a number of the events and places are real. For example, the Black Hills in North America and Lake Karachay in the former USSR. The sound is generally darker and more subdued than &quot;Entropia&quot;, with a harsh, industrial feel to the guitar tones.

Daniel Gildenlöw has personally, though reluctantly, stated that &quot;Concrete Lake&quot; is his least favorite Pain of Salvation album.

==Concept==
&quot;One Hour by the Concrete Lake&quot; follows the fictional tale of a man that works in the weapons industry. He begins to have doubts about the morality of his occupation, and realizes that he is just part of a big &quot;machine&quot; that controls his life. He makes a New Year&#x27;s resolution to discover what consequences his life and his work have on other parts of the world, and decides to break free of the machine.

In the second chapter, he travels around the world to many different places and sees what effects his weapons are actually having. He remembers being told that the weapons he helped to make would save human lives and preserve the peace, yet all he sees are weapons being used by people to kill other people—which is their designed purpose. Furthermore, he finds native people (specifically, Native American Indians) struggling to reclaim their sacred land from the colonizing white man, who have also taken uranium from the ground and dumped radioactive waste into the local rivers.

In the third chapter, he arrives at shores of Lake Karachay (in Kyshtym in the former USSR). There, so much nuclear waste had been dumped over the past fifty years that if one stood by the shore for &quot;one hour&quot;, the exposure to radiation would be such that death from physical injuries would inevitably occur within &quot;two weeks&quot;. Concrete blocks have been placed in the lake, falling to the bottom to help compress sediments down and prevent them from shifting. Still it would take tens of thousands of years for the deleterious effects of the radiation to subside. Unfortunately, after ten years, the concrete had already begun to crack and split open. The water in the lake has been decreasing steadily over the years and will eventually leave a dry lake bed. In addition, the lake connects to many underground rivers that go out to sea.

The man&#x27;s quest to leave the machine ends as he realizes that it is impossible for anyone to truly leave the machine. Outside one machine there are merely more machines. However, he also realizes that the &quot;machine&quot; is only made of its &quot;wheels,&quot; so the only thing he can do is choose which machine he wants to be part of and take some responsibility for its direction.

The album ends with the idea that anyone could easily come to understand the significance and immorality of the issues raised in the album; it would only require them to stand for one hour by the concrete lake.

==Track listing==

All lyrics written by Daniel Gildenlöw. Music written by members listed below.

Note: These are the reported track lengths on the CD casing, however, the length of &quot;Inside Out&quot; goes for over 6 more minutes (includes a hidden track, &quot;Pilgrim Reprise&quot;). This increases the track length to 13:15, and the total album playing time to 60:00, linking the album length to the album title. In the South American edition, the hidden tracks are removed to make space for a bonus track, &quot;Beyond the Mirror&quot;. The Japanese edition of this album also contains &quot;Beyond the Mirror&quot; as well as another bonus track, &quot;Timeweaver&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

<text>Entropia is Pain of Salvation&#x27;s first studio album. It is a concept album concerning the story of a family in a fictional society that is torn apart by a war. The title is a portmanteau of Entropy (from thermodynamics, the measure of disorder present in a system), and Utopia (the ideal society). This is the only album to feature Daniel Magdic on guitar.

In 2024, &quot;Loudwire&quot; elected it as one of the 11 best progressive metal debut albums.

==Release history==
&quot;Entropia&quot; was first released by the Japanese company Marquee on their Avalon label in August 1997 (see 1997 in music). Following favourable reviews and positive fan reactions in the progressive rock/metal world, Marquee decided to fly Daniel over to Tokyo a week in October 1997 to promote the album. While in Tokyo, Daniel featured in various TV and radio shows, did interviews for the Japanese metal press, and performed in selected record stores. Around this time, purchasing albums through online record stores was commonplace, and fans from around the world began to do so with Entropia.

It was subsequently released in Romania (1998 on Rocris Discs), in Europe (September 1999 on InsideOut Music), in South America (September 1999 on Hellion), and in the USA (2000 on InsideOut America).

<doc id="1082894" wikidata="Q173198" url="?curid=1082894" title="Logic synthesis">
<text>In computer engineering, logic synthesis is a process by which an abstract specification of desired circuit behavior, typically at register transfer level (RTL), is turned into a design implementation in terms of logic gates, typically by a computer program called a &quot;synthesis tool&quot;. Common examples of this process include synthesis of designs specified in hardware description languages, including VHDL and Verilog. Some synthesis tools generate bitstreams for programmable logic devices such as PALs or FPGAs, while others target the creation of ASICs. Logic synthesis is one step in circuit design in the electronic design automation, the others are place and route and verification and validation.

== History ==
The roots of logic synthesis can be traced to the treatment of logic by George Boole (1815 to 1864), in what is now termed Boolean algebra. In 1938, Claude Shannon showed that the two-valued Boolean algebra can describe the operation of switching circuits. In the early days, logic design involved manipulating the truth table representations as Karnaugh maps. The Karnaugh map-based minimization of logic is guided by a set of rules on how entries in the maps can be combined. A human designer can typically only work with Karnaugh maps containing up to four to six variables.

The first step toward automation of logic minimization was the introduction of the Quine–McCluskey algorithm that could be implemented on a computer. This exact minimization technique presented the notion of prime implicants and minimum cost covers that would become the cornerstone of two-level minimization. Nowadays, the much more efficient Espresso heuristic logic minimizer has become the standard tool for this operation. Another area of early research was in state minimization and encoding of finite-state machines (FSMs), a task that was the bane of designers. The applications for logic synthesis lay primarily in digital computer design. Hence, IBM and Bell Labs played a pivotal role in the early automation of logic synthesis. The evolution from discrete logic components to programmable logic arrays (PLAs) hastened the need for efficient two-level minimization, since minimizing terms in a two-level representation reduces the area in a PLA.

Two-level logic circuits are of limited importance in a very-large-scale integration (VLSI) design; most designs use multiple levels of logic. Almost any circuit representation in RTL or Behavioural Description is a multi-level representation. An early system that was used to design multilevel circuits was LSS from IBM. It used local transformations to simplify logic. Work on LSS and the Yorktown Silicon Compiler spurred rapid research progress in logic synthesis in the 1980s. Several universities contributed by making their research available to the public, most notably SIS from University of California, Berkeley, RASP from University of California, Los Angeles and BOLD from University of Colorado, Boulder. Within a decade, the technology migrated to commercial logic synthesis products offered by electronic design automation companies.

== Commercial tools ==
The leading developers and providers of logic synthesis software packages are Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens. Their synthesis tools are Synopsys Design Compiler, Cadence First Encounter and Siemens Precision RTL.

==Logic elements==
&quot;Logic design&quot; is a step in the standard design cycle in which the functional design of an electronic circuit is converted into the representation which captures logic operations, arithmetic operations, control flow, etc. A common output of this step is RTL description. Logic design is commonly followed by the circuit design step. In modern electronic design automation parts of the logical design may be automated using high-level synthesis tools based on the behavioral description of the circuit.

Logic operations usually consist of Boolean AND, OR, XOR and NAND operations, and are the most basic forms of operations in an electronic circuit. Arithmetic operations are usually implemented with the use of logic operators.

==High-level or behavioral==
With a goal of increasing designer productivity, research efforts on the synthesis of circuits specified at the behavioral level have led to the emergence of commercial solutions in 2004, which are used for complex ASIC and FPGA design. These tools automatically synthesize circuits specified using high-level languages, like ANSI C/C++ or SystemC, to a register transfer level (RTL) specification, which can be used as input to a gate-level logic synthesis flow. Using high-level synthesis, also known as ESL synthesis, the allocation of work to clock cycles and across structural components, such as floating-point ALUs, is done by the compiler using an optimisation procedure, whereas with RTL logic synthesis (even from behavioural Verilog or VHDL, where a thread of execution can make multiple reads and writes to a variable within a clock cycle) those allocation decisions have already been made.

==Multi-level logic minimization==

Typical practical implementations of a logic function utilize a multi-level network of logic elements. Starting from an RTL description of a design, the synthesis tool constructs a corresponding multilevel Boolean network.

Next, this network is optimized using several technology-independent techniques before technology-dependent optimizations are performed. The typical cost function during technology-independent optimizations is total literal count of the factored representation of the logic function (which correlates quite well with circuit area).

Finally, technology-dependent optimization transforms the technology-independent circuit into a network of gates in a given technology. The simple cost estimates are replaced by more concrete, implementation-driven estimates during and after technology mapping. Mapping is constrained by factors such as the available gates (logic functions) in the technology library, the drive sizes for each gate, and the delay, power, and area characteristics of each gate.

<doc id="1082897" wikidata="Q3760653" url="?curid=1082897" title="George Street, Sydney">
<text>George Street is a street in the central business district of Sydney.

It was Sydney&#x27;s original high street, and remains one of the busiest streets in the city centre. It connects a number of the city&#x27;s most important buildings and precincts. There are more high rise buildings here than on any other street in Australia. Amongst Australia&#x27;s 100 largest listed companies, more are located here than on any other street.

The street begins in the north end of Sydney in The Rocks, near the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and extends to the southern end of the city, near Central Station and Ultimo, where it leads into Railway Square. From here Broadway is the continuation of George Street turning westwards, leading to the western suburbs as Parramatta Road.

==History==

The origins of George Street lie in the layout of the Sydney Cove colony. Captain Arthur Phillip placed the convicts and marines on the rocky western slopes of the bay. A track leading from the convicts&#x27; encampment in the area of The Rocks, past the marine barracks and alongside the banks of a stream to a brick pit, located near to the present location of Central station with some arguing that it follows paths and tracks already created by the local Aboriginal people. This track that eventually became George Street is one of the two original thoroughfares, along with the track that became Bridge Street. It is possible that George Street was the first street in Australia.

Until 1810 George Street was generally referred to as High Street in the English custom, although the northern part of the thoroughfare was also sometimes referred to as &quot;Sergeant Major&#x27;s Row&quot; and, earlier, as &quot;Spring Row&quot; (since water carriers had originally established the route as a link between the Tank Stream, the Military encampment and the hospital). The Street was formally named for King George III by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810.

On 8 August 1907 at Bateman&#x27;s Crystal Hotel on George Street, a meeting resolved to form the New South Wales Rugby Football League, Australia&#x27;s first professional rugby football association and predecessor to the modern-day National Rugby League. In 1937, Frank Jenner committed to telling ten different people on George Street about Christianity every day thenceforward.

Until 2016, George Street was the route for Sydney&#x27;s Anzac Day parade until the street was made unavailable by CBD and South East Light Rail construction work. The parade now proceeds via Elizabeth Street. The Light Rail line through George Street began services in December 2019.

From 2019 to 2022, the majority of George Street between Bridge St (near Circular Quay) and Rawson Place (near Central Station) was progressively converted into a pedestrian mall.

==Precincts==

Being a major street through central Sydney, George Street is often seen in terms of a number of distinct sections or precincts. From north to south, they include:
*The Rocks: At the northern end of George Street, north of Alfred Street, is The Rocks, the location of the first British settlement in Australia begun in 1788. There are many souvenir shops, restaurants and traditional pubs, as well as art galleries and the Museum of Contemporary Art. Here George Street ends as it reaches Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour). The area is dominated by the approaches to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and faces the Sydney Opera House across Circular Quay. Circular Quay railway station and ferry terminals are located nearby.
*Wynyard: The area along George Street from King Street in the south up to Alfred Street in the north is given over largely to offices of large corporations and financial institutions, interspersed with retail, large hotels and large-scale bars and entertainment facilities. An important cross street in this precinct is Martin Place, the location of the Sydney Cenotaph and the Sydney General Post Office. Wynyard railway station is located in the northern part of this precinct.
* Town Hall: Along the central section of George Street, this precinct is noted as the location of three important historic buildings: St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, the Sydney Town Hall; and the Queen Victoria Building shopping centre. These are well served by Town Hall station. The surrounding area features large scale retail operations, such as the main Sydney store of the department store Myer. Pitt Street Mall, a large retail precinct, is located close by.
*Cinema District: Situated on the hill overlooking Chinatown, this area used to feature the three largest cinemas in Sydney, however the three cinemas (Hoyts, Greater Union and Village Roadshow) merged their theatres into one complex, which was ultimately bought out by Greater Union in December 2005. The Cinema District also houses many video arcades, Internet cafes, fast food restaurants and pubs and is very busy after dark.
*Chinatown: Sydney&#x27;s traditional, main Chinatown is located in Haymarket, near to the southern end of George Street. The Chinatown precinct is situated mostly to the west of the street but also extends to the east of the street. A centre of retail shops and restaurants, features of Chinatown located close to George Street include a tree stump (near the intersection with Hay Street) gilded in gold and dripping water, which was presented to the Chinese community of Sydney with the message that it would bring good fortune to them. Close by is the Capitol Theatre, which often hosts the Sydney runs of international musicals.
*Railway Square: the southern end of George Street is a confluence of several busy streets. It is so-named because it is adjacent to the Sydney Central station, and the square itself is the site of a large bus terminus. Railway Square is today ringed by hotels and small-scale retail, and is also the site of a campus of the Sydney Institute of TAFE.

==Transport==

On 8 December 1899, an electric tramway was opened along George Street to Harris Street. This reduced the traditional dependence on horses and human feet. In 1959 the trams were replaced by diesel buses. Bus lanes were introduced from Bridge Street to Broadway southbound and Broadway to Jamiestown Street northbound in July 1997. Until October 2015, George Street was the busiest street in Sydney in terms of number of buses per hour; most bus services to the inner western and north-western suburbs traveled along part of or most of George Street.

Many of the principal railway stations in the Sydney city centre are located on or near George Street. At the northern end of George Street, is Circular Quay station. Wynyard underground station was constructed in the same period at a location adjacent to George Street, with a major entrance to George Street near Hunter Street. Next south is Town Hall station is located under George Street near the Sydney Town Hall and at the southern end is Sydney Central station.

===Light rail development===
In response to increasing bus congestion in the CBD, on 13 December 2012, the NSW Government announced a commitment to build a light rail from Circular Quay down George Street to Central station before continuing east to Kensington and Randwick.

In conjunction with the light rail works, the City of Sydney pedestrianised sections of George Street between Hunter and Bathurst Streets, with the intention of making George Street &quot;Sydney&#x27;s premier retail and pedestrian street&quot;. The state government announced it would support the plan. Light rail construction commenced in October 2015 resulting in the closure of George Street. The light rail through George Street opened on 14 December 2019. However, the southbound lane between Bathurst Street and Campbell Street was never reopened and remained closed to traffic.

In May 2020, City of Sydney proposed to convert the southern section of George Street to a pedestrian-only boulevard, extending southwards the existing boulevard that was constructed under the light rail project. In July 2020, the northbound lane from Ultimo Street to Bathurst Street and the southbound lane from Campbell Street to Rawson Place was temporarily closed. The closure was made permanent in the Council meeting in December 2020. Works to convert the southern section of George Street to a pedestrian boulevard along with other traffic treatments started in March 2021. The section between Bathurst Street and Goulburn Street was completed in September 2021.

<text>The Perfect Element, Part I is Pain of Salvation&#x27;s third studio album, released in October 2000. It is a concept album that focuses on the forming of the individual, particularly on the events from one&#x27;s childhood and adolescence. It is the first segment of a planned three-part concept. &quot;The Perfect Element, Part II&quot; was released in 2007 under the title &quot;Scarsick&quot;.

==Analysis==
&quot;The Perfect Element, Part I&quot; is the first part of a planned, two-piece concept, and is divided into three chapters, each containing four tracks.

Part one of the concept is a story of human development, which focuses specifically on the progression from childhood to adolescence. It contains many themes within its context which include:

*Child abuse (sexual and physical)
*Sexuality
*Tragedy
*Drug abuse
*Love
*Pain
*Anger
*Loss (of life and innocence, among other things)
*Shame
*Regret
*Despair
*Inner struggles

All these themes are dealt with as the story explores the lives of two characters, one male and one female (known commonly as &quot;He&quot; and &quot;She&quot;) who are broken, dysfunctional people. They meet in the events of the song &quot;Ashes&quot; after the first two songs of the album present us with a depiction of their troubled pasts (&quot;Used&quot; for &quot;He&quot; and in &quot;In the Flesh&quot; for &quot;She&quot;). After that introduction, the concept focuses on the inner struggles and feelings of the characters after the events on &quot;Ashes&quot;, and we also have some memory flashes, telling us more about their pasts and revealing what events in their lives caused them to become what they are, finally ending with the &quot;falling&quot; of He on the last song, &quot;The Perfect Element&quot;.

<doc id="1082901" wikidata="Q7277942" url="?curid=1082901" title="RTÉ News on Two">
<text>RTÉ News on Two was a late-night news programme that aired each Monday to Thursday on Irish public television channel RTÉ Two between 2 November 1978 and 18 September 2014. The transmission time of this programme varied each night, but it generally aired between 22:45 and 23:30. Until 4 January 2013, the programme was broadcast every Monday to Thursday, lasting 22 minutes, reducing to ten minutes after this date. A world weather forecast followed each broadcast.

&quot;RTÉ News on Two&quot; took a different agenda to other RTÉ News and Current Affairs programmes. Its content was customised for a younger audience, and presenters and journalists tend to use more informal language on the programme. From 2 October 2006 the bulletin was presented by Eileen Whelan, following the departure of Anthony Murnane, who was with the programme from the beginning. Eamonn Falvey edited the programme from 2 April 2007 until December 2009. Gareth O&#x27;Connor was the programme editor until 2010. It was mainly presented by Eileen Whelan, Aengus Mac Grianna and Una O&#x27;Hagan.

From 5 March 2007 until 18 September 2014, &quot;RTÉ News on Two&quot; was streamed live on the internet and archive shows are available to view through the RTÉ website. For the duration of the 2011 general election campaign, &quot;RTÉ News on Two&quot; in its regular format was only aired on Thursday night, with a reformatted programme, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, airing Monday-Wednesday (with a short &quot;RTÉ News on Two&quot; extended summary airing beforehand).

==History==
The programme began as &quot;Newsnight&quot; in 1978 and was usually the last programme of the day during RTÉ 2&#x27;s first ten years on the air. It was largely an international news service with reports from BBC News, ITN, ABC News, CBS News and other American networks.

On 3 October 1988, RTÉ 2 relaunched as Network 2, and their news programme was relaunched as &quot;Network News&quot;. It was a regular RTÉ News bulletin but the new name reflected the new name of the channel it was broadcast on.

In 1997, as part of RTÉ&#x27;s revamp of Network 2 as &quot;N2&quot;, the programme was completely changed and renamed &quot;News 2&quot;. &quot;News 2&quot; was presented by Sharon Ní Bheoláin (who had presented &quot;Nuacht RTÉ&quot; for a number of years) and Anthony Murnane. Both presenters would present alternating weeks, with another presenter for the sports news. Unlike RTÉ News on RTÉ One, &quot;News 2&quot; was presented from a green screen studio, the presenters sat on high stools, the main news presenter would sit on the right with the sports presenter on the left at different desks.

In 2003, RTÉ began another rebranding exercise and choose to highlight what channels they own, hence N2 was relaunched as RTÉ N2 (however continuity referred to the channel as RTÉ Network 2). The RTÉ Network 2 news programme was restored to the regular RTÉ News look and branding (as &quot;RTÉ News on Two&quot;), and now broadcasts from the regular RTÉ News studio, but many of the innovations of &quot;News 2&quot; and the younger agenda remain. For example, the presenter usually stands to introduce the first story.

The series was replaced by two early evening bulletins called &quot;News Feed&quot; on 22 September 2014, which ran until January 2017.

For a period of time a live late-night news programme aired on both RTÉ One and RTÉ News Now on Friday nights between September and May after &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;.

There are no morning or late night news bulletins on any RTÉ channel.

<doc id="1082903" wikidata="Q6981266" url="?curid=1082903" title="Start Point, Devon">
<text>Start Point is a promontory in the South Hams district in Devon, England, . Close to the most southerly point in the county, it marks the southern limit of Start Bay, which extends northwards to the estuary of the River Dart.

The rocks of the point are greenschist and mica-schist, formed by metamorphism of Devonian sediments during a period of mountain building towards the end of the Carboniferous period.

The name &quot;Start&quot; derives from an Anglo-Saxon word &quot;steort&quot;, meaning a tail. This root also appears in the names of birds with distinctive tails, like the redstart.

== Features ==

As a result of the many shipwrecks in the area, Start Point lighthouse was built in 1836 to alert ships to the danger of the point and its surrounding rocks. The lighthouse and the area&#x27;s birdlife make it a popular spot for visitors, and Start Point is accessible to walkers from the South West Coast Path.

The Start Point transmitting station is located on top of the promontory, just north-west of the lighthouse. Built in 1939, it nowadays transmits only a single broadcast, BBC Radio 5 Live.

The newspaper awards the culture prize Expressens Heffaklump for children&#x27;s and youth culture.

==Overview==
The first edition of was published on 16 November 1944. A main feature that day was an interview with the crew members of a British bomber who were successful in sinking the German ship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. A project of Albert Bonnier Jr., Carl-Adam Nycop, and Ivar Harrie – who was to become the first editor-in-chief –  was created in part to push back against &quot;national socialism and related violent ideologies.&quot;

The paper is owned by the Bonnier Group. As of 2005, the paper had a liberal stance, but it declared its independent leaning in 1995.

Through mergers, the Gothenburg edition of is titled &quot;GT&quot; (originally &quot;Göteborgs-Tidningen&quot;) and the Malmö edition is titled &quot;Kvällsposten&quot;, but the three share half of the content. (with &quot;GT&quot; and &quot;Kvällsposten&quot;) maintains a centre-right political profile, describing its editorial position as &quot;independent liberal&quot;, while the competitor &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; is independent social-democratic. Ownership of (and Sweden&#x27;s largest morning newspaper, ) is controlled by the Bonnier family, while &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; is owned jointly by Swedish trade unions and the Norwegian publishing family Schibsted.

<text>Douglas Hunt Trumbull (; April 8, 1942 – February 7, 2022) was an American film director and visual effects supervisor, who pioneered innovative methods in special effects. He created scenes for &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;, and directed the movies &quot;Silent Running&quot; and &quot;Brainstorm&quot;.

==Early life==
Trumbull was born in Los Angeles. His father was an aerospace engineer who had briefly worked in Hollywood creating visual effects for the 1939 movie &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.; his mother, who died when Trumbull was 7, was an artist. As a child, he liked to construct mechanical and electrical devices such as crystal-set radios, and enjoyed watching alien invasion movies. He initially wanted to be an architect, leading him to take classes in illustration. He studied technical drawing at El Camino Junior College and joined the Screen Cartoonists Guild upon graduating. However, Hollywood initially rejected his portfolio of spaceships and planetary drawings. Though his abilities in creating photorealistic art led to a job at Graphic Films, which produced short films for NASA and the Air Force.

==Career==
===1960s===
Douglas Trumbull&#x27;s early work was at Graphic Films in Los Angeles. The small animation and graphic arts studio produced a film called &quot;To the Moon and Beyond&quot; about spaceflight for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Trumbull, the son of a mechanical engineer and an artist, worked at Graphic Films as an illustrator and airbrush artist. He painted a rotating spiral galaxy, and using a fish eye lens, projected the film onto a custom-built dome. The effect was ground-breaking for its time and the film caught the attention of director Stanley Kubrick, who was beginning work on the project that would become &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Kubrick hired director Con Pederson from Graphic Films and the company was to work on visual effects for the film. When Kubrick decided to move all production to England, he cancelled the contract with Graphic Films. Trumbull wanted to keep working on the film as he had already done considerable pre-production work, so he cold-called Kubrick after obtaining the director&#x27;s home phone number from Pederson. Kubrick hired Trumbull and flew him to London for the production of &quot;2001&quot;. Trumbull&#x27;s first task was to create the dozens of animations seen in the data display screens in the &quot;Aries&quot; moon shuttle and the &quot;Discovery&quot;. They looked like computer graphics, but they were created by photographing and animating reproductions of charts and graphs from technical publications. Trumbull initially created the shots using a number of Rube Goldberg-like contraptions he built with gears and motors ordered from a scientific equipment supply house. Kubrick gave the young effects technician creative freedom and encouragement: &quot;He would say ... &#x27;What do you need to do it?&#x27; and I would have complete carte blanche, which was wild as a young guy&quot;, Trumbull recalled. &quot;I was 23–24 when I started the movie, and was 25 by the time I was doing the Star Gate. He would say, &#x27;What do you need?&#x27; and I&#x27;d say, &#x27;Well, I need to go into town and buy some weird bearings and some stuff&#x27; and he would send me off to town in his Bentley, with a driver, into London. It was great!&quot;

Trumbull&#x27;s responsibilities and talents grew as the production continued, and he became one of four special effects supervisors on the film (the others were fellow Graphic Films alumnus Con Pederson, along with Tom Howard and Wally Veevers.) Trumbull&#x27;s most memorable contribution was the development of the slit-scan photography process, used in the &quot;Stargate&quot; sequence. &quot;... I just happened to be in the right place at the right time ... We were struggling with the Star Gate. Nobody knew what a Star Gate was; but, I came up with some ideas that I didn&#x27;t even know at the time were based on some things I was learning as a young guy about street photography and weird photographic techniques ...&quot;. He created the Stargate by building a 6ft-tall sheet of rotatable metal and cut a narrow slit in it. The sheet was placed in front of a 12ft-long backlit glass panel, through which lighting patterns were shone. With a long camera exposure, the kaleidoscope of lights appeared to be darting towards the camera from a single point.

Trumbull and Kubrick wanted the audience to feel like they were on the adventure themselves, and immersed in the film by participating. This approach eventually led to the Imax system of high resolution projection, which Trumbull helped to develop. Working on &quot;2001&quot; hooked Trumbull on the concept of producing immersive film experiences on huge screens — ironically, at a time when the industry was moving towards the multiplexing of theatres with smaller screens.

Although Trumbull&#x27;s association with Kubrick was a huge boost for his career, he swore afterwards that he would &quot;never work for someone else again&quot;, in part because Kubrick &quot;was a hell of a taskmaster ... his level of quality-control bordered on perfectionism.&quot;

The film earned an Oscar for best special effects, but the award went solely to Kubrick, with Trumbull receiving none of the accolade for his work. This led to threats of legal action and the two men did not speak for a decade. Trumbull said after Kubrick&#x27;s death that Kubrick &quot;was a genius&quot;, someone whom Trumbull missed terribly.

In 1969 Trumbull was filming the annual Flying Saucer Convention in Giant Rock California. This evolved into a full-length project initially called Giant Rock, Rutabaga Deluxe, and then &quot;Saturation 70: An Ecological Horror Fantasy&quot;. The star of the film was a five-year-old Julian Jones, who was the son of Brian Jones, of Rolling Stones fame. The story involved Jones losing his mother in a giant garbage dump and wandering a desolate planet looking for her, while being menaced by gas-masked garbage men and helped by a fairy godmother in a sequined cowgirl creation by Nudie. Some footage includes a battle with a Green Beret and a Viet Cong in a supermarket. Trumbull&#x27;s partner on the film was Anthony Foutz. A company called Dimension V took over backing of the film.

===1970–1974===

Having returned to Hollywood, Trumbull set up his own company and subsequently bid on the job to produce special effects for the science-fiction film &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;. (&quot;I was a young guy and very naive&quot;, he later recalled, &quot;And I seriously underbid the job – I had no idea what these things were supposed to cost. I nearly went bankrupt as a result!&quot;) Trumbull and associate James Shourt produced dozens of shots, including the &quot;electron microscope&quot; pictures of the Andromeda organism and various on-screen readouts. Though many of these looked like computer graphics, they were created using techniques Trumbull had used for &quot;2001.&quot; Author Michael Crichton and director Robert Wise were much impressed by Trumbull&#x27;s work.

Trumbull&#x27;s participation and success on &quot;Andromeda&quot; set him up to direct the 1971 film &quot;Silent Running&quot;, with a script based on his original treatment: America&#x27;s last great forests are preserved and sent into space inside huge geodesic domes, in the hope that one day they can be returned to an earth that can once again sustain them. When orders are issued by faceless bureaucrats to abandon and destroy the domes, the ship&#x27;s botanist (Bruce Dern) rebels and takes over the ship, aided by three anthropomorphic &quot;drone&quot; robots. He steers the ship away from the fleet and hides among the rings of Saturn, out of contact (silent running), attempting to keep the forest in good health, alone except for the drones who follow him around like pets.

&quot;Silent Running&quot; was produced by Universal on a shoestring budget of one million dollars, one-tenth the budget of &quot;2001&quot;. The film used a number of special effects techniques that Trumbull had helped develop. The spacecraft interiors were shot aboard a mothballed aircraft carrier, which lent its name to the movie spacecraft &quot;Valley Forge&quot;. Trumbull was not originally slated to direct, but as the start of production loomed he became the obvious choice. (Other newcomers included the script writing team of Deric Washburn and Michael Cimino, who would later collaborate on &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, along with writer Steven Bochco of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; and &quot;L.A. Law&quot; fame.)

When &quot;Silent Running&quot; was released, insiders were astonished that the finished film had been produced for so little money. Lead actor Bruce Dern compared Trumbull&#x27;s creative vision to that of Alfred Hitchcock, with whom Dern had also worked. Trumbull was seen as one of Hollywood&#x27;s up and coming young directors.

Although a critical success, &quot;Silent Running&quot; was a flop at the box office. Trumbull recalled that &quot;It was just a great experience for me as a film maker, but I didn&#x27;t know that I was part of an experiment by Universal Studios . . . to see if it was possible to have a movie survive on word of mouth alone without an advertising campaign.&quot; It was not, but &quot;Silent Running&quot;″s environmental message struck a chord, and the movie has since become a cult classic.

After &quot;Silent Running&quot;, Trumbull developed a number of movie projects, but a series of misfortunes and bad luck kept them from getting beyond the initial development stage. One project nearly did get into production, and was already being cast when it was abruptly scuttled – the investor had decided to abandon the movie business and build a Las Vegas casino instead. Trumbull described this period of his career as &quot;development hell&quot;. Unable to live on development fees alone and needing money, Trumbull returned to creating special effects, including some uncredited work using blue screen techniques on the 1974 film &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;, a huge commercial hit.

===1975–1980===

In 1975, Trumbull turned down an offer to provide the effects for George Lucas&#x27; &quot;Star Wars&quot; due to other commitments, but in 1977 he contributed effects to &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. In late 1978, Trumbull&#x27;s Future General Corporation, a research/special effects house that was funded by Gulf + Western and Paramount Pictures, was offered the job to produce the special effects for &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. Trumbull, already deeply involved in &quot;Close Encounters&quot;, refused, wanting instead to focus his efforts on his patented Showscan process, a high-speed, large-format movie process that provided unprecedented visual clarity. Paramount awarded the contract to effects house Robert Abel and Associates, and in a move seen by some as payback for Trumbull&#x27;s refusal to take on the project, all but shuttered Future General.

Robert Abel had produced many high-end, visually advanced commercials for clients such as 7-Up, but it soon became apparent that their choice of technology, which featured software-controlled camera rigs and graphics imaging systems very advanced for the day, simply couldn&#x27;t scale up to the volume of material required. In August 1978, with rumors of an impending meltdown at Abel swirling, Trumbull approached Paramount offering to step in and do the effects with partner Richard Yuricich. Paramount declined, hoping that Abel could still work a miracle.

Early in 1979, and with principal photography nearly finished and a December release date looming, Abel was fired after failing to produce even a few seconds of usable footage. Paramount approached Trumbull to take over effects production, which Trumbull did after securing an agreement to be released from his contract at Paramount upon completion of the film. &quot;At the time&quot;, he recalled, &quot;I think they would have entertained &quot;anyone&quot; who could have pulled them out of the jam.&quot; Trumbull reassembled his Future General team, rebuilt his facility which Paramount had nearly gutted, and with a mere six months to create the hundreds of effects shots needed, worked virtually around the clock for months. His team made the date, but their in-house battle cry became &quot;... crop it, flop it, or drop it!&quot; (That is, re-use part of an existing scene, take an existing scene and &quot;flop&quot; it over so that a right-to-left shot of the ship now plays the other way, or &quot;drop&quot; the shot from the script altogether.)

The model of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, already built by the time Trumbull&#x27;s team took over, proved especially tricky. While the model of &quot;Discovery&quot; in &quot;2001&quot; was over 50 feet (15 m.) long and featured a wealth of detail (from parts gleaned from, among other things, hundreds of plastic model tank kits), the model of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was only seven feet (2 m.) in length, which severely limited the photographic possibilities. Other compromises had to be overcome. Trumbull had several ideas for unconventional effects – such as a modified slitscan technique to produce fantastic streaks when the &quot;Enterprise&quot; went into warp drive, but many had to be shelved due to time constraints. Trumbull also made several contributions to the story line, in collaboration once again with his &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot; director Robert Wise.

As Trumbull told Wolfram Hannemann of &quot;in70mm.com&quot;, &quot;There were as many shots [in the movie] as &quot;Close Encounters&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; combined ... There were 650 shots, which had to be completed in six months ... and we all worked 24 hours a day for six months. Seven days a week, around the clock, to get that movie done ... I ended up in the hospital – it was a major recovery. I had ulcers, all kinds of exhaustion because I was working seven days a week, almost living in the studio, not getting enough sleep.&quot;

===1980–1990s===

In 1981 Trumbull directed the special effects for the Ridley Scott film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. By this time Trumbull had sworn off doing special effects for other directors, but was lured to the project by the opportunity to work with Scott, and a chance to create something other than sterile, grey and white spacecraft. &quot;One of the things that appealed to me about the project&quot;, Trumbull recalled in an interview in Cinefex magazine, &quot;was that it was NOT a space movie. I&#x27;m just real tired of doing spaceships against star backgrounds.&quot; Indeed, the iconic images of a polluted, dystopian Los Angeles, looking more like an oil refinery than a metropolis, and complete with building-sized electronic billboards and a bulbous blimp circling overhead advertising &quot;Off World&quot; job opportunities became the film&#x27;s visual trademarks.

Trumbull did not complete &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, (David Dryer took over as special effects supervisor) leaving the film as agreed about halfway through to concentrate on pre-production for his next directing effort, &quot;Brainstorm&quot;, a story of two brilliant scientists who develop a revolutionary device to record and vicariously experience other people&#x27;s feelings and perceptions, a device the military tries to steal for its own purposes.

&quot;Brainstorm&quot; was to be a showcase for Trumbull&#x27;s &quot;Showscan&quot; process, which used special cameras and projectors to capture and project 70 mm film at 60 frames per second. At the last minute the Showscan process was not used, because theatre owners balked at the idea of installing expensive new projection equipment. The film was shot conventionally at 24 frames per second on 35 mm film, though Trumbull continued his process of shooting effects work in 70 mm. &quot;In movies people often do flashbacks and point-of-view shots as a gauzy, mysterious, distant kind of image&quot;, Trumbull recalled, &quot;And I wanted to do just the opposite, which was to make the material of the mind even more real and high-impact than &#x27;reality&#x27;&quot;.

The film was nearly scuttled by the mysterious drowning death of Natalie Wood during a break in production. MGM immediately shut down production and initially wanted to dump &quot;Brainstorm&quot; (and collect the insurance on the unfinished film). Trumbull, though perhaps bereft by the death of Natalie, reasoned that the film would be finished after filming just a few more scenes. Lawyers and insurance companies battled over whether to even complete the film. The movie was finally finished two years later when the insurance company supplied the money to finish production. Trumbull had pushed all the while for the studio to finish and release his movie. &quot;I can do this&quot;, Trumbull recalled in an interview with GreenCine, &quot;I&#x27;ve got all the coverage ... All you need to do is let me in the editing room and I&#x27;ll show you. They said, &#x27;No, you can&#x27;t come back, we don&#x27;t want you in the cutting room, you can&#x27;t finish this movie.&#x27;&quot; Because of his determination to finish his film, Trumbull became &quot;persona non grata&quot; at MGM in the process. Eventually released on a small number of screens and with little publicity (though Trumbull recalled in the Greencine interview that the film became &quot;Quote, Natalie Wood&#x27;s last film, unquote&quot;) &quot;Brainstorm&quot; was well received critically but a commercial failure at the box office.

Exhausted from his battles with the Hollywood system (&quot;The movie business is so totally screwed up that I just don&#x27;t have the energy to invest three or four years in a feature film&quot;), Trumbull retreated to the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts, to escape &quot;the lawyers, the insurance agents, the creeps&quot;, redirecting his career away from traditional Hollywood projects and concentrating instead on developing new technology for movie production, and for the exhibition industry and theme-park rides, such as the very first flight-simulator ride, Tour of the Universe, and the Back to the Future Ride at Universal Studios Theme Parks. Until recently, Trumbull&#x27;s Showscan technology could be seen on a theme-park type ride at the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas.

In 1994, Trumbull was briefly a Vice Chairman of IMAX Corporation and President of its Ridefilm division through his involvement in the simultaneous combination and takeover of the Canadian-based private company Imax Corp. and Trumbull Co.

===2000–2018===
Trumbull spent nearly two decades in the Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts, starting and running a series of companies involved in effects production and innovation.

In 2010, Trumbull used social media to publicize a video on Vimeo and YouTube demonstrating an invention intended to cap the BP oil spill with a strong vacuum seal. Although the video &quot;went viral&quot; almost immediately, Trumbull never heard from BP or any of the US government agencies struggling to contain the spill, which left him bemused and mildly annoyed. &quot;I didn&#x27;t do it with the hope of compensation&quot;, he later said, &quot;I did it because I thought it was the moral thing to do.&quot;

After nearly thirty years away from Hollywood, Trumbull contributed to special effects work on Terrence Malick&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;The Tree of Life&quot;. Malick, reportedly a Trumbull fan, approached him about the effects work and mentioned that he did not like the look of computer-generated effects. Reportedly Trumbull asked, &quot;Why not do it the way we did it on &quot;2001&quot;?&quot; Recent compositing programs such as Nuke allow practical scenes shot on film to be combined with fewer of the head-aches of &quot;traditional&quot; effects work, such as shooting multiple camera passes on a single piece of film, matte passes, and the like. Trumbull eventually signed on as special effects consultant, working with the film&#x27;s effects supervisor, Dan Glass. Many of the &quot;organic&quot; effects processes used in &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters&quot; were resurrected, such as photographing chemical interactions in petri dishes and releasing paints into water tanks. &quot;It was a working environment that&#x27;s almost impossible to come by these days&quot;, Trumbull told The Guardian newspaper in July 2011. &quot;Terry wanted to create the opportunity for the unexpected to occur before the camera, then make something of that. He didn&#x27;t want to use a very stringent design process, he wanted the unexpected phenomenon to occur – and use that.&quot;

In March 2011, director James Cameron announced plans to film his next &quot;Avatar&quot;-type 3D feature in a digital version of Showscan. Cameron has been pushing for movie theatres to adopt higher frame-rates to maintain the 3D effect during scenes involving high-speed motion (such as explosions). At twenty-four frames per second the 3D effect breaks down, while at forty-eight or sixty frames per second it is maintained. Sixty frames per second is difficult to achieve with conventional film because of the stress on the medium itself; recording sixty frames per second using a digital camera is commonplace.

In 2012 Trumbull said he was working on a new science-fiction project that he claimed is &quot;way beyond anything that Peter Jackson and James Cameron have been doing&quot;, which will probably be shot with a camera capable of recording 120 frames per second, twice the speed of its ancestor, Showscan.

Trumbull was a guest speaker at the Massachusetts Production Coalition in February 2013.

Since 2013 Trumbull maintained a workshop and studio on his property in the Berkshire hills of Massachusetts where he continued to develop new tools for film-makers. He often traveled to film screenings and seminars and was enjoying a resurgence of his celebrity among film and visual effects enthusiasts. Trumbull seemed grateful for the recognition and reverence accorded by his followers. &quot;They really keep me going&quot;, he told The Australian newspaper in February 2011. &quot;They reinforce some enthusiasm about my work. It&#x27;s very hard to keep me going, because the setbacks [were] really tragic and difficult.&quot; When asked by a reporter how he had managed to persevere in the face of setbacks, Trumbull laughed and replied that he didn&#x27;t know, and &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m just out of my mind!&quot;

In 2014 Trumbull announced that he had developed a new digital capture and projection system called Magi. It shoots and projects native 3D in 4K at 120 fps, using an innovative technique he called &quot;cadence&quot;, which had never been used in previous 3D systems: &quot;We were shooting 60 [frames] per eye, projector was going 120—left eye, right eye, left eye, right eye. You’re shooting the same way you’re going to project it. And that&#x27;s when this magic happens. It&#x27;s only one flash per frame, and the sequence is actually temporally correct. There are in fact 120 different positions. Anything that moves in front of the camera is going to have 120 different positions.&quot; That year he also produced a short dramatic film, UFOTOG, to highlight the capabilities of the Magi system. The story deals with a man who has developed a sophisticated 3D photographic system to track UFOs and prove their existence, despite interference from a shadowy government agency. The film has been shown at film festivals and industry conferences and to filmmakers and studio executives.

In 2016, he told Science &amp; Film, &quot;I am planning on making a feature-length movie that will be almost entirely miniatures, but it will be photorealistic, full-scale, epic in quality, and have the kind of things that I like about &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;2001&quot;.&quot;

In 2018, Trumbull provided the visual effects for and executive produced the movie &quot;The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot&quot;. The same year, he participated in the documentary &quot;Trumbull Land&quot; (Grégory Wallet, 2018) devoted to him and his universe.

===Honors===
Trumbull was twice honored by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE). Most recently, he received the Progress Medal in recognition of his numerous contributions to photographic processes and technologies in visual effects (VFX) and HFR cinematography. Trumbull conducted pioneering biometric research on audience response to HFR imaging and developed a novel cinematic process using 65mm film at 60 frames per second that resulted in a &quot;Giant Screen&quot; 70mm image with extraordinarily high definition along with smoother and more realistic motion rendering. His work continues to advance stereoscopic 3D and digital HFR imaging including his 120FPS Magi single-camera/single projector &quot;lens-to-lens&quot; system that harnesses existing cameras, post-production tools, and projectors to deliver images and sound that are almost indistinguishable from reality. The Progress Medal is the most prestigious SMPTE award, and it recognizes outstanding technical contributions to the progress of engineering phases of the motion picture, television, or motion-imaging industries. The honor was conferred upon Trumbull at the SMPTE Centennial Gala on October 28, 2016, at the Ray Dolby Ballroom in Hollywood. In 2011, he received the SMPTE Presidential Proclamation, which recognizes individuals of established and outstanding status and reputation in the motion-picture, television, and motion-imaging industries worldwide. Trumbull was honored for his more than 45 years of pioneering work in visual effects photography and groundbreaking innovation in motion picture technologies.

Trumbull was inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2010, citing first his stature as &quot;innovative master of special effects&quot;. He has been nominated for Academy Awards on three occasions and has received the American Society of Cinematographer&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award.

Trumbull received the International Press Academy&#x27;s Tesla award in December 2011, named in honor of Nikola Tesla, an inventor, scientist and engineer, who, Trumbull noted dryly in a runway interview, &quot;Died penniless, after lots of people took credit for his work.&quot; He went on to say that he hopes it doesn&#x27;t turn out that way for him. Trumbull also received the Gordon E. Sawyer Award in February 2012, an honorary Academy Award given to an &quot;individual in the motion picture industry whose technological contributions have brought credit to the industry&quot;, as well as the Georges Méliès award from the Visual Effects Society in the same month.

==Personal life and death==
Trumbull was married three times and had two children. He was in poor health for the last two years of his life, due to complications from a stroke and cancer. He died from mesothelioma at a hospital in Albany, New York, on February 7, 2022, at the age of 79. His ashes are due to be sent into space with those of Majel Barrett and Nichelle Nichols.

<doc id="1082916" wikidata="Q11587832" url="?curid=1082916" title="Magnetic helicity">
<text>In plasma physics, magnetic helicity is a measure of the linkage, twist, and writhe of a magnetic field.

Magnetic helicity is a useful concept in the analysis of systems with extremely low resistivity, such as astrophysical systems. When resistivity is low, magnetic helicity is conserved over longer timescales, to a good approximation. Magnetic helicity dynamics are particularly important in analyzing solar flares and coronal mass ejections. Magnetic helicity is relevant in the dynamics of the solar wind. Its conservation is significant in dynamo processes, and it also plays a role in fusion research, such as reversed field pinch experiments.

When a magnetic field contains magnetic helicity, it tends to form large-scale structures from small-scale ones. This process can be referred to as an inverse transfer in Fourier space. This property of increasing the scale of structures makes magnetic helicity special in three dimensions, as other three-dimensional flows in ordinary fluid mechanics are the opposite, being turbulent and having the tendency to &quot;destroy&quot; structure, in the sense that large-scale vortices break up into smaller ones, until dissipating through viscous effects into heat. Through a parallel but inverted process, the opposite happens for magnetic vortices, where small helical structures with non-zero magnetic helicity combine and form large-scale magnetic fields. This is visible in the dynamics of the heliospheric current sheet, a large magnetic structure in the Solar System.

== Mathematical definition ==
Generally, the helicity formula_1 of a smooth vector field formula_2 confined to a volume formula_3 is the standard measure of the extent to which the field lines wrap and coil around one another. It is defined as the volume integral over formula_3 of the scalar product of formula_2 and its curl, formula_6:
: formula_7

===Magnetic helicity===
Magnetic helicity formula_8 is the helicity of a magnetic vector potential formula_9 where formula_10 is the associated magnetic field confined to a volume formula_3. Magnetic helicity can then be expressed as
: formula_12

Since the magnetic vector potential is not gauge invariant, the magnetic helicity is also not gauge invariant in general. As a consequence, the magnetic helicity of a physical system cannot be measured directly. In certain conditions and under certain assumptions, one can however measure the current helicity of a system and from it, when further conditions are fulfilled and under further assumptions, deduce the magnetic helicity.

Magnetic helicity has units of magnetic flux squared: Wb2 (webers squared) in SI units and Mx2 (maxwells squared) in Gaussian Units.

===Current helicity===
The current helicity, or helicity formula_13 of the magnetic field formula_14 confined to a volume formula_3, can be expressed as
: formula_16
where formula_17 is the current density. Unlike magnetic helicity, current helicity is not an ideal invariant (it is not conserved even when the electrical resistivity is zero).

== Gauge considerations ==
Magnetic helicity is a gauge-dependent quantity, because formula_18 can be redefined by adding a gradient to it (gauge choosing). However, for perfectly conducting boundaries or periodic systems without a net magnetic flux, the magnetic helicity contained in the whole domain is gauge invariant, that is, independent of the gauge choice. A gauge-invariant &quot;relative helicity&quot; has been defined for volumes with non-zero magnetic flux on their boundary surfaces.

== Topological interpretation ==
The name &quot;helicity&quot; is because the trajectory of a fluid particle in a fluid with velocity formula_19 and vorticity formula_20 forms a helix in regions where the kinetic helicity formula_21. When formula_22, the resulting helix is right-handed and when formula_23 it is left-handed. This behavior is very similar to that found concerning magnetic field lines.

Regions where magnetic helicity is not zero can also contain other sorts of magnetic structures, such as helical magnetic field lines. Magnetic helicity is a continuous generalization of the topological concept of linking number to the differential quantities required to describe the magnetic field. Where linking numbers describe how many times curves are interlinked, magnetic helicity describes how many magnetic field lines are interlinked.
Magnetic helicity is proportional to the sum of the topological quantities twist and writhe for magnetic field lines. The twist is the rotation of the flux tube around its axis, and writhe is the rotation of the flux tube axis itself. Topological transformations can change twist and writhe numbers, but conserve their sum. As magnetic flux tubes (collections of closed magnetic field line loops) tend to resist crossing each other in magnetohydrodynamic fluids, magnetic helicity is very well-conserved.

As with many quantities in electromagnetism, magnetic helicity is closely related to fluid mechanical helicity, the corresponding quantity for fluid flow lines, and their dynamics are interlinked.

== Properties ==
=== Ideal quadratic invariance ===
In the late 1950s, Lodewijk Woltjer and Walter M. Elsässer discovered independently the ideal invariance of magnetic helicity, that is, its conservation when resistivity is zero. Woltjer&#x27;s proof, valid for a closed system, is repeated in the following:

In ideal magnetohydrodynamics, the time evolution of a magnetic field and magnetic vector potential can be expressed using the induction equation as
: formula_24
respectively, where formula_25 is a scalar potential given by the gauge condition (see ). Choosing the gauge so that the scalar potential vanishes, formula_26, the time evolution of magnetic helicity in a volume formula_3 is given by:
: formula_28
The dot product in the integrand of the first term is zero since formula_29 is orthogonal to the cross product formula_30, and the second term can be integrated by parts to give
: formula_31
where the second term is a surface integral over the boundary surface formula_32 of the closed system. The dot product in the integrand of the first term is zero because formula_33 is orthogonal to formula_34 The second term also vanishes because motions inside the closed system cannot affect the vector potential outside, so that at the boundary surface formula_35 since the magnetic vector potential is a continuous function. Therefore,
: formula_36
and magnetic helicity is ideally conserved. In all situations where magnetic helicity is gauge invariant, magnetic helicity is ideally conserved without the need for the specific gauge choice formula_37

Magnetic helicity remains conserved in a good approximation even with a small but finite resistivity, in which case magnetic reconnection dissipates energy.

=== Inverse transfer ===

Small-scale helical structures tend to form larger and larger magnetic structures. This can be called an &quot;inverse transfer&quot; in Fourier space, as opposed to the &quot;(direct)&quot; energy cascade in three-dimensional turbulent hydrodynamical flows. The possibility of such an inverse transfer was first proposed by Uriel Frisch and collaborators and has been verified through many numerical experiments. As a consequence, the presence of magnetic helicity is a possibility to explain the existence and sustainment of large-scale magnetic structures in the Universe.

An argument for this inverse transfer taken from is repeated here, which is based on the so-called &quot;realizability condition&quot; on the magnetic helicity Fourier spectrum formula_38 (where formula_39 is the Fourier coefficient at the wavevector formula_40 of the magnetic field formula_41, and similarly for formula_42, the star denoting the complex conjugate). The &quot;realizability condition&quot; corresponds to an application of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which yields:
formula_43
with formula_44 the magnetic energy spectrum. To obtain this inequality, the fact that formula_45 (with formula_46 the solenoidal part of the Fourier transformed magnetic vector potential, orthogonal to the wavevector in Fourier space) has been used, since formula_47. The factor 2 is not present in the paper since the magnetic helicity is defined there alternatively as formula_48.

One can then imagine an initial situation with no velocity field and a magnetic field only present at two wavevectors formula_49 and formula_50. We assume a fully helical magnetic field, which means that it saturates the realizability condition: formula_51 and formula_52. Assuming that all the energy and magnetic helicity transfers are done to another wavevector formula_53, the conservation of magnetic helicity on the one hand and of the total energy formula_54 (the sum of magnetic and kinetic energy) on the other hand gives:

formula_55

formula_56

The second equality for energy comes from the fact that we consider an initial state with no kinetic energy. Then we have the necessarily formula_57. Indeed, if we would have formula_58, then:

formula_59

which would break the realizability condition. This means that formula_60. In particular, for formula_61, the magnetic helicity is transferred to a smaller wavevector, which means to larger scales.

<doc id="1082927" wikidata="Q744111" url="?curid=1082927" title="Haptotaxis">
<text>In cellular biology, haptotaxis () is the directional motility or outgrowth of cells, e.g. in the case of axonal outgrowth, usually up a gradient of cellular adhesion sites or substrate-bound chemoattractants (the gradient of the chemoattractant being expressed or bound on a surface, in contrast to the classical model of chemotaxis, in which the gradient develops in a soluble fluid.). These gradients are naturally present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the body during processes such as angiogenesis, or artificially present in biomaterials where gradients are established by altering the concentration of adhesion sites on a polymer substrate.

== Clinical significance ==
Haptotaxis plays a major role in the efficient healing of wounds. For example, when corneal integrity is compromised, epithelial cells quickly cover the damaged area by proliferation and migration (haptotaxis). In the corneal stroma, keratocytes within the wounded area undergo apoptosis, leaving the stroma devoid of cells that must be replaced. Keratocytes surrounding the wounded area proliferate and become fibroblasts that migrate to fill the wounded area. This creates a healthy environment with myofibroblasts and extracellular matrix. This is known as light backscattering or subepithial haze.
When there is injury to an epithelial cell heptotaxis occurs, which is highly influenced by the cell&#x27;s velocity, which is in turn influenced by direction of cell motility. Cells migrate easily and quickly in packs, so when one cell moves the rest follow in response to the gradient and initial cell movement. Mechanical effects like the buildup of tensile forces may play an important role for both division as well as motility of cells in tissue.

==Methods of study==
As defined above, haptotaxis is the motility of cells up a gradient of substrate bound molecules. There is a wide variety of procedures to set up this gradient &quot;in vitro&quot; for the study of haptotaxis. The two main categories can be classified into either continuous or digital. Both types are relatively easy to produce, but digital gradients give more accurate concentration calculations. Overall, the methods in use currently can be improved to mirror the &quot;in vivo&quot; environment more, as the resolution of the gradients is not as sharp &quot;in vitro&quot; as they are &quot;in vivo&quot;. Also, biological gradients have the ability to change geometry, which current models &quot;in vitro&quot; cannot mimic. These gradients are useful in gaining understanding of the basics of haptotaxis, but because of the complex and fluid nature of these gradients, a deeper understanding of the &quot;in vivo&quot; condition is difficult to ascertain.

==Tumor cells and haptotaxis==
A characteristic of many cancers is the ability to move throughout the body. These are malignant cells, and pose a serious threat to the health of an individual. It has been indicated that haptotaxis plays a role in the ability of malignant cells to metastasize. One factor that was initially found to influence haptotaxis is serum spreading factor, which is present in blood serum and interstitial tissues. The presence of serum spreading factor was shown to influence directed migration along a gradient of substrate molecules in a few types of cancer cells. Another component important in the haptotaxis of tumor cells is MenaINV, which is an actin regulatory protein that becomes increasingly expressed in tumor cells. This actin regulatory protein binds to fibronectin receptors and aids in the haptotactic and chemotactic processes of tumor cells.

==Pathology==
Haptotaxis plays a role in several kinds of diseases where the movement or aggregation of cells causes the symptoms. As mentioned before, cancers that are metastatic have the ability to perform haptotaxis in order to spread throughout the body. This ability is not limited to tumor cells. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease marked by fibrosis in lung mesothelial cells. TGF-β1 is a cytokine found in higher concentrations of lungs from patients who have IPF, and induces haptotaxis of pleural mesothelial cells. At the same time, TGF-β1 causes the mesothelial cells to develop into myofibroblasts, which contribute to the symptoms in IPF. The result is that there becomes an aggregation of myofibroblasts in the lungs, which leads to fibrosis of the mesothelial cells. During nephritis, VCAM-1 is expressed in higher levels on the tubules of nephrons, which leads to increased leukocyte migration via the gradient established by VCAM-1. It is important to note that this increased expression was not found on the capillary endothelial cells. This migration of leukocytes leads to inflammation and tissue destruction characteristic of an inflammatory response.

==Immune system==
Movement of cells is vital for the function of the immune system, and especially for antigen presenting cells. Dendritic cells (one of the main antigen presenting cells in the immune system), move towards the lymph nodes after phagocytizing an antigen in order to present the antigen to T cells. Chemokines influence these movements, especially CCL21, which is bound to lymphatic endothelial cell membranes. The influence is short range, but causes movement of the dendritic cells up a fixed chemical gradient. Other leukocytes also exhibit haptotactic movement: neutrophils undergo IL-8 mediated migration, while monocytes, basophils, eosinophils and some T cells are influenced by RANTES chemokines. In the autoimmune disorder rheumatoid arthritis and in osteoarthritis, the associated swelling and migration of neutrophils to the affected site has been shown to be linked to membrane bound midkine cytokine. This cytokine operates in a haptotactic fashion, attracting local neutrophils to the site of expression.

==Tissue development==
Haptotaxis plays a role in organizing cells to form tissues and specific regions of those tissues. Fibronectin and laminin both play a role in adrenocyte mutation into distinctive distribution in the adrenal gland. The adrenocytes migrate centripetally as they mature towards the medulla of the adrenal gland, and this movement may be a result of haptotactic forces mediated by fibronectin and laminin. In nerve cells, axonal growth is mediated by nerve growth factor in a haptotactic manner, where the axon of nerve cells grows along the gradient. This information could be used to possibly develop methods to promote nerve regeneration in patients that have nerve damage. 
Another regenerative strategy is the use of mesenchymal stem cells, which can differentiate into different kinds of connective tissue in the wound healing process. The haptotaxis is mediated by fibronectin, vitronectin, and type I collagen. A recent study has tentatively proposed the idea that the structures on cells responsible for sensing the membrane protein gradients are attenuated filopodia. Also, the more amount of filopodia present on the leading edge of the migrating cell, the more responsive the cell is to the haptotactic gradient. This is important because there is the possibility that all motile cells that display filopodia may be responding to haptotactic gradients. Further research is required in the subject, but it is clear that more and more kinds of cell undergo haptotaxis than originally believed.

==Therapeutic uses==
The placement of haptotactic molecules would benefit most in situations where increased numbers of cells are required to move to a desired location to help the healing process either directly or by their cell products. The introduction of haptotactic peptides may help in healing several diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hemophilia A and B deficiencies, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The haptoctatic molecules would play a role in healing by restricting other bioengineered cells that have the ability to produce the needed cell products to the desired area of the body where therapy is needed. This application can also be used in wound healing, where increased numbers of fibroblasts and keratinocytes aid in wound re-granularization, thus decreasing overall healing time. In regard to prosthetics, making the prosthetic device incorporate successfully with the tissue is a challenge. When the prosthetic&#x27;s surface is coated with haptotactic materials, the prosthetic is aided in forming covalent bonds with the cells and becomes securely attached to the cell layer. While haptotaxis may not be occurring in this process, it demonstrates the diversity with which this knowledge about haptotaxis can be used.

<text>Ligue 1 (or League 1), officially known as Ligue 1 [[McDonald&#x27;s France|McDonald&#x27;s]] for sponsorship reasons, is a professional association football league in France and the highest level of the French football league system. Administered by the Ligue de Football Professionnel, Ligue 1 is contested by 18 clubs (since the 2023–24 season) and operates on a system of promotion and relegation from and to Ligue 2.

Seasons run from August to May. Clubs play two matches against each of the other teams in the league – one home and one away – totalling to 34 matches over the course of the season. Most games are played on Saturdays and Sundays, with a few games played during weekday evenings. Play is regularly suspended the last weekend before Christmas for two weeks before returning in the second week of January. As of 2024, Ligue 1 is considered one of the top national leagues, ranked fifth in Europe, behind England&#x27;s Premier League, Spain&#x27;s La Liga, Italy&#x27;s Serie A and Germany&#x27;s Bundesliga.

Ligue 1 was inaugurated on 11 September 1932 under the name &quot;National&quot; before switching to &quot;Division 1&quot; after a year of existence. It continued to operate under that name until 2002, when it adopted its current name. Paris Saint-Germain are the most successful club with twelve league titles, while Lyon is the club that has won the most consecutive titles (seven between 2002 and 2008). Saint-Étienne was the first club with ten titles. With the presence of 73 seasons in Ligue 1, Marseille holds the record for most seasons among the elite, while Paris Saint-Germain hold the league record for longevity with 50 consecutive seasons (from 1974 to present). Nantes is the team with the longest consecutive unbeaten streak (32 matches) and the fewest number of defeats (one match) in a single season, doing so in the 1994–95 campaign. In addition, Nantes also holds the record for the longest time without losing at home with a run of 92 matches from May 1976 to April 1981.

The current champions are Paris Saint-Germain, who won a record twelfth title in the 2023–24 season. The league has been won on multiple occasions by foreign-based club Monaco, the presence of which within the league makes it a cross-border competition.

Ahead of the 2023–24 season, the number of teams in the league was reduced to 18; four teams in the 2022–23 Ligue 1 were relegated to Ligue 2 and only two teams in Ligue 2 were promoted to Ligue 1.

==History==

===Foundation===
Professionalism in French football did not exist until July 1930, when the National Council of the French Football Federation voted 128–20 in favour of its adoption. The founders of professionalism in French football are Georges Bayrou, Emmanuel Gambardella, and Gabriel Hanot. Professionalism was officially implemented in 1932.

In order to successfully create a professional football league in the country, the Federation limited the league to twenty clubs. In order to participate in the competition, clubs were subjected to three important criteria:

* The incoming club must have had positive results in the past.
* The incoming club must be able to pull in enough revenue to balance its finances.
* The incoming club must be able to successfully recruit at least eight professional players.

Many clubs disagreed with the subjective criteria, most notably Strasbourg, RC Roubaix, Amiens and Stade Français, while others like Rennes, due to fear of bankruptcy, and Lille, due to a conflict of interest, were reluctant to become professional. Lille&#x27;s president, Henri Jooris, also chairman of the Ligue du Nord, feared his league would fold and proposed it become the second division of the new league. Eventually, many clubs earned professional status, though it became more difficult to convince clubs in the northern half of the country; Strasbourg, Roubaix and Amiens refused to accept the new league, while conversely Mulhouse, Excelsior AC Roubaix, Metz and Fives accepted professionalism. In southern France, clubs such as Marseille, Hyères, Montpellier, Nîmes, Cannes, Antibes and Nice were extremely supportive of the new league and accepted their professional status without argument.

===Establishment===
The league&#x27;s inaugural season of the all-professional league, called &quot;National&quot;, was held in 1932–1933. The 20 inaugural members of &quot;National&quot; were Antibes, CA Paris, Cannes, Club Français, Excelsior AC Roubaix, Fives, Hyères, Marseille, Metz, Mulhouse, Nice, Nîmes, Alès, Lille, Racing Club de France, Red Star Olympique, Rennes, Sochaux, Sète and Montpellier. The 20 clubs were inserted into two groups of 10 with the bottom three of each group suffering relegation to Division 2. The two winners of each group would then face each other in a &quot;final&quot; held at a neutral venue, which later turned out to the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir. The first final was held on 14 May 1933 and it matched the winner of Group A, Olympique Lillois, against the runner-up of Group B, Cannes. Antibes, the winner of Group B, was supposed to take part in the final but was suspected of bribery by the French Football Federation and was disqualified. In the first final, Lillois were crowned the inaugural champions following the club&#x27;s 4–3 victory. After the season, the league decided to retain the 14 clubs and not promote any sides from the second division. The league also agreed to change its name from &quot;National&quot; to simply &quot;Division 1&quot;. For the 1934–35 season, the league organised a legitimate promotion and relegation system bringing the total tally of clubs in the first division to 16. The number remained until the 1938–39 season.

Because of World War II, football was suspended by the French government and the Ligue de Football Professionnel, although its member clubs continued playing in regional competitions. During the &quot;war championships&quot;, as they are called, professionalism was abolished by the Vichy regime and clubs were forced to participate in regional leagues, designated as &quot;Zone Sud&quot; and &quot;Zone Nord&quot;. Due to its non-association with the two leagues, the LFP and FFF do not recognise the championships won by the clubs and thus 1939–1945 is non-existent in the two organisations&#x27; view. Following the conclusion of the war and the liberation of France, professional football returned to France. The first division increased its allotment of clubs to 18. This number remained until the 1965–66 season when the number was increased to 20. In 2002, the league changed its name from &quot;Division 1&quot; to &quot;Ligue 1&quot;.

== Format ==

* 20 clubs: 1932–1933
* 14 clubs: 1933–1934
* 16 clubs: 1934–1939
* 18 clubs: 1945–1946

* 18 clubs: 2023–present 
==Competition format==

There are 18 clubs in Ligue 1. During the course of a season, usually from August to May, each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 34 games, though special circumstances may allow a club to host matches at other venues such as when Lille hosted Lyon at the Stade de France in 2007 and 2008. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. For the 2015–16 season only, two teams were to be relegated and only two teams from Ligue 2 were to be promoted, but this decision was overturned and three teams were relegated and three teams promoted. 
Thus, it was the 2016–17 season which saw the return of a relegation play-off between the 18th-placed Ligue 1 team and the third-placed team in the Ligue 2 on a two-legged confrontation, with the Ligue 2 team hosting the first game.

Previously, the league utilised a different promotion and relegation format. Prior to 1995, the league&#x27;s format was direct relegation of the bottom two teams and a play-off between the third-last first-division team and the winner of the second-division play-offs, similar to the Dutch Eredivisie, and the German Bundesliga. The league has also experimented with a &quot;bonus&quot; rule. From 1973 to 1976, a rule rewarded teams scoring three or more goals in a game with one extra point, regardless of outcome, with the objective of encouraging offensive play. The experience was ultimately inconclusive. At the start of the 2006–07 season, the league introduced an &quot;Attacking Play Table&quot; to encourage the scoring of more goals in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2. The LFP, with the help of the former manager Michel Hidalgo introduced the idea to reward those teams who score the most goals. The table was similar to the previous idea, but was independent from the official league table and clubs were only rewarded with monetary bonuses.

In June 2021, the LFP voted overwhelmingly at its general assembly to contract Ligue 1 back to 18 clubs for the 2023–24 season by relegating four to, and promoting two from, Ligue 2 after 2022–23.

===European qualification===
As of the 2023–24 season, as determined by the UEFA coefficient, the top four teams in Ligue 1 qualify for the Champions League, with the top three proceeding directly to the group phase. The fourth-placed team enters in the third qualifying round. The fifth-placed team qualifies for the UEFA Europa League, the sixth for UEFA Conference League. The last Europa League place is determined through the country&#x27;s domestic cup competition, the Coupe de France. If the cup winner qualifies for Europe through their league position, the seventh-placed team in Ligue 1 will qualify for the Conference League. If France is among the top two nations that earned the most coefficient points from a single season, an additional Champions League group phase spot will be awarded to the team in fourth place; as such the Champions League third qualifying round spot and all spots below will be pushed back one position.

==Clubs==

A total of 74 clubs have played in Ligue 1 from its foundation in the 1932–33 season to the start of the 2024–25 season. Currently, Marseille, Montpellier, Nice and Rennes are the only founding members of the league to be playing in Ligue 1. Paris Saint-Germain is the only club to have not suffered points relegation. They earned promotion to the first division for the 1974–75 season and have not faltered down since. Paris Saint-Germain was administratively relegated by the league following its split from Paris FC in 1972, but returned to the top flight two seasons later.

Internationally, the most well-known Ligue 1 clubs include Marseille, Lyon, Monaco and Lille.

==Finances==
Ligue 1 clubs&#x27; finances and budgets are managed by the DNCG (Direction Nationale du Contrôle de Gestion), an organisation responsible for monitoring the accounts of professional association football clubs in France. It was founded in 1984 and is an administrative directorate of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP). The mission of the DNCG is to oversee all financial operations of the 44 member clubs of the LFP, develop the resources of professional clubs, apply sanctions to those clubs breaking the rules of operation, defend the morals and interests of French football in general.

Following a report by the DNCG, it was determined that the combined budget of Ligue 1 clubs was €910 million for the 2005–06 season, a 39% increase from the 2002–03 season. The prominent reason for the rise was mainly associated with the television rights deal the league regularly signs. Excluding Paris Saint-Germain, many of the top division clubs are extremely healthy with clubs such as Auxerre, Bordeaux, Lille and Lyon being referred to as &quot;managed to perfection&quot;. However, recently the DNCG has encouraged clubs to concentrate on limiting their &quot;skyrocketing wage bills and the magnitude of their debts&quot; after it was discovered that the LFP clubs accounts as a whole were in the red for the third consecutive season (2008–2011) with an estimated deficit of €130 million. In 2012, the LFP announced that the clubs deficit had been cut in half from €130 million to €65 million. Ligue 1 ranks fifth in terms of revenue brought in by clubs with the league bringing in £0.6 billion for the 2006–07 season trailing England, Italy, Spain and Germany.

In terms of world football, clubs Lyon and Marseille are among the richest football clubs in the world and regularly feature in the Deloitte Football Money League ranking of football clubs by revenue generated from football operations. In the list compiled in the 2008–09 season, Lyon ranked 13th among clubs generating approximately €139.6 million, while Marseille were right behind them in 14th position generating €133.2 million.

In 2016, just Paris Saint-Germain was in the top 30 of the Deloitte Football Money League (ranked 4). From 2017 to 2020, Paris Saint-Germain (ranked between five and seven) and Lyon (ranked between 17 and 28) were part of the top 30.

==Media coverage==
The LFP formerly had rights agreements with the premium channels Canal+ and beIN Sports. The agreement with beIN Media Group, reached on 23 June 2011, paid the LFP €510 million over four seasons. Following the announcement of the agreement, it was revealed that Canal+ had acquired four television packages, while beIN Sports acquired two packages.

In 2018, Mediapro acquired three of the four major packages of LFP media rights for 2020-21 through 2024, largely replacing Canal+ in a deal valued at a record €1.15 billion. beIN Sports maintained &quot;lot 3&quot;, which contained two matches per-week on Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons. Mediapro was expected to establish a new channel to house these rights. beIN Sports later sub-licensed its package to Canal+. In June 2020, Mediapro announced a partnership with TF1, under which the new channel would leverage the network&#x27;s talent and resources, and be branded as Téléfoot—an extension of TF1&#x27;s long-running football programme. &quot;Téléfoot&quot; presenters Grégoire Margotton and Bixente Lizarazu would serve as the lead broadcast team for at least 20 matches per-season.

Seeking to renegotiate its contract due to the financial impact of COVID-19, Mediapro began withholding its rights payments to the LFP in October 2020. LFP CEO Arnaud Rouger stated in October 2020 that they may have to pursue a new broadcaster if they are unable to resolve the dispute with Mediapro. In December 2020, it was reported that Mediapro were preparing to wind down Téléfoot, after it agreed to compensate the LFP for the two missed rights payments. In February 2021, Canal+ reached an interim agreement to acquire the rights packages held by Mediapro for the remainder of the season, and later sub-licensed Ligue 2 to beIN; Téléfoot shut down on 8 February 2021.

In June 2021, the LFP resold the broadcast rights packages for Ligue 1 to Canal+ and Amazon Prime Video through 2024, with the two broadcasters paying a total of €663 million in total. Canal+ holds rights to two matches per-week. In August 2023, it announced a sub-licensing agreement with DAZN to stream its matches on a branded channel within the service as part of DAZN&#x27;s local launch. Canal+ does not plan to renew its rights after the conclusion of the 2024 season.

==Awards==

===Trophy===

The previous Ligue 1 trophy, &quot;L&#x27;Hexagoal&quot;, was developed by the Ligue de Football Professionnel and designed and created by Pablo Reinoso. The trophy has been awarded to the champion of France since the end of the 2006–07 season, replacing the previous Ligue 1 trophy that had existed for only five years. The name &quot;Hexagoal&quot; was derived from an official competition created by the LFP and French TV channel TF1 to determine a name for the new trophy. Over 9,000 proposals were sent in and, on 20 May 2007, French Football Federation member Frédéric Thiriez announced that, following an online vote, the term &quot;Hexagoal&quot; had received half of the votes. The first club to hoist the new trophy was Olympique Lyonnais who earned the honour after winning the 2007–08 season.

The current Ligue 1 trophy, which was created by Mathias Kiss, will be awarded beginning with the 2024–25 season. Announced on 17 October 2024, the yet-to-be-named trophy features a hexagonal base at the bottom and a gold-plated sphere at the top that is supported by &quot;1&quot;-shaped columns.
===Monthly and annual===
In addition to the winner&#x27;s trophy and the individual winner&#x27;s medal players receive, Ligue 1 also awards the monthly Player of the Month award. Following the season, the UNFP Awards are held and awards such as the Player of the Year, Manager of the Year, and Young Player of the Year from both Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are handed out.

<text>Long-jawed orb weavers or long jawed spiders (Tetragnathidae) are a family of araneomorph spiders first described by Anton Menge in 1866. They have elongated bodies, legs, and chelicerae, and build small orb webs with an open hub with few, wide-set radii and spirals with no signal line or retreat. Some species are often found in long vegetation near water.

<doc id="1082934" wikidata="Q1736266" url="?curid=1082934" title="List of racing cyclists and pacemakers with a cycling-related death">
<text>The first documented deaths of competitive cyclists during competition or training date to the 1890s and early 1900s when the recently-invented safety bicycle made cycling more popular, both as a sport and as a mode of transport. The athletes listed here were either professional cyclists, professional pacemakers or well-known competitive amateurs who had a cycling-related death, mostly during a race or during training. Pacemakers are motorcyclists utilized in motor-paced racing, riding motorcycles in front of their cycling teammates to provide additional speed to those cyclists via the resulting slipstream.

Safety has been a concern since cycling&#x27;s early days. By 1929, at least 47 people had died while racing at velodromes – 33 cyclists and 14 pacemakers. Motor-paced cycling still exists in the modern era as keirin racing and derny racing. A number of professionals and competitive amateurs have been killed in crashes with motorized vehicles while training on public roads plus there is a growing number of cyclists who have died of heart attacks while cycling in a race or while training. Some of these deaths affect cycle racing afterwards – the death of Andrey Kivilev in a crash during the 2003 Paris–Nice race caused the Union Cycliste Internationale to institute a mandatory helmet rule.

The dangers of the various sporting forms of cycling continue to be an issue, including training on public roadways. A survey of 2008 Olympics teams, however, indicated that cycling was not even in the top six most injury-prone sports during competition that year. Racing cyclists who have died during a race or during training are remembered by cycling aficionados and the cycling press. Their personal effects are exhibited in museums, their cemetery markers and tombstones are visited by fans, and as one commentator wrote: &quot;Plaques, statues and shrines to cycling&#x27;s fallen heroes are scattered all over Europe&#x27;s mountain roads, turning any ride into a pilgrimage.&quot;

==Cyclists who died during a race or because of a crash that happened during a race==


==Cyclists who died during training==
The following athletes died while individually training for competitions or during scheduled breaks while participating in a professional race. The only incident of multiple deaths from a team involved Néstor Mora, Augusto Triana, and Hernán Patiño from Team Postobón in 1995. The death rates for cyclists, in general, differ from country to country depending on how popular cycling is. A 2015 study of European Union cyclists&#x27; deaths, for instance, showed that in the Netherlands almost 25% of road deaths were cyclists while Greece had less than 5%.

<doc id="1082943" wikidata="Q615913" url="?curid=1082943" title="Mechanotaxis">
<text>Mechanotaxis refers to the directed movement of cell motility via mechanical cues (e.g., fluidic shear stress, substrate stiffness gradients, etc.). In response to fluidic shear stress, for example, cells have been shown to migrate in the direction of the fluid flow. Mechanotaxis is critical in many normal biological processes in animals, such as gastrulation, inflammation, and repair in response to a wound, as well as in mechanisms of diseases such as tumor metastasis.

A subset of mechanotaxis - termed durotaxis - refers specifically to cell migration guided by gradients in substrate rigidity (i.e. stiffness). The observation that certain cell types seeded on a substrate rigidity gradient migrate up the gradient (i.e. in the direction of increasing substrate stiffness) was first reported by Lo et al. The primary method for creating rigidity gradients for cells (e.g., in biomaterials) consists of altering the degree of cross-linking in polymers to adjust substrate stiffness. Alternative substrate rigidity gradients include micropost array gradients, where the stiffness of individual microposts is increased in a single, designed direction.

== History/background ==
There are multiple ways in which a cell&#x27;s migration pattern can be influenced, including mechanotaxis, chemotaxis, which is cell movement following a molecular gradient, and haptotaxis, which is cell movement following an adhesion gradient. The first subset of mechanotaxis to be experimentally observed was durotaxis, detailing how contact with a substrate could cause a change in a cell&#x27;s migration pattern, but more recently researchers have also examined how contact with a neighboring cell could cause changes in a cell&#x27;s migration pattern. Researchers began investigating mechanotaxis of endothelial cells in blood vessels and wound repair in the 1990s and early 2000s. The early 2000s and 2010s also saw more interest in mechanotaxis in the biomedical engineering community as a potential method of cell manipulation.

== Factors/pathways ==
Cells can detect and react to mechanical stimuli in a variety of ways. One method is through the interaction of E-cadherin presented on the cell membrane. As these receptors interact and are pulled or pushed, tension can be created, leading to a change in the conformation of alpha-catenin bound to B-catenin on the intracellular portion of E-cadherin. This causes the recruitment of vinculin and leads to a change in actin conformation and in the orientation of the cell.
Another signaling pathway important in a cell&#x27;s response to mechanical stimuli is the Wnt planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. This noncanonical pathway involves the activation of Rho and Rac families of GTPases, which are essential in reorganizing the cytoskeleton in preparation for cell migration. When cells collide, localized signaling of the PCP pathway leads to a change in the polarity of the cell, redirecting the cell in a different direction.

Different cellular receptors are important in cellular mechanotransduction involved in contact with a substrate such as the extracellular matrix (ECM). For example, many cell types express a5b1 integrin on their membranes, which can bind to a major ECM component called fibronectin. This leads to an accumulation of integrins in the area of contact with the ECM, attaching the ECM to the cytoskeleton of the cell and allowing for migration to occur along the ECM through tension at the points of attachment (called focal adhesions, FA) and subsequently the dismantling of FAs as the cell moves along. For this reason, the elasticity of the ECM or another binding substrate is very important. The tension created by a cell pulling against a stiff substrate needs to reach a certain threshold to allow for mechanotaxis to occur.

== Mechanotaxis in development ==
Cell migration is essential in early embryonic development, as a defining characteristic of this phase is the folding and reorganization of the embryo that occurs during and after gastrulation. Without cell migration, complex structures involving multiple cell types that make up complex organisms – like tissues, organs, limbs, etc. – would not develop correctly. There are multiple factors that influence cells to move during development –– but the factors that influence mechanotaxis in development often involve interactions between cells or between a cell and a substrate such as a yolk or membrane.

Contact inhibition of locomotion is involved in the migration of many cell types, including neural crest (NC) cells in vertebrates which give rise to cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), facial cartilage, and other non-neural cells throughout the body. NC cells are very mobile, with actin-rich protrusions at the leading edge of each cell in the direction of travel. When an NC cell collides with another NC cell, activation of the Wnt planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway occurs at the point of cell contact, causing localized activation of the downstream effector RhoA. This activation is likely caused by interactions between cadherins on the cell surfaces, and leads to the retraction of the cell protrusions and a change in the cell&#x27;s polarity, causing the NC cell to change direction. Interestingly, this contact inhibition of locomotion among NC cells is coupled with chemical coattraction between NC cells, which allows the cells to keep in motion for efficient migration as well as to stay together, respectively, leading to collective migration.
Cells are most often influenced by surrounding cells towards collective migration in development, such as polster cells which are the first to internalize at the start of gastrulation in zebrafish. Unlike neural crest cells, these cells don&#x27;t exhibit contact inhibition of locomotion or coattraction, but instead migrate collectively due to E-cadherin interactions between leading cells and following cells. The following polster cells are polarized and migrate towards the animal pole of the embryo for unknown reasons, reaching their actin-rich protrusions towards the leading cells and inducing interactions between E-cadherin proteins located on following cell protrusion membranes and leading cell membranes. The interactions between E-cadherins create tension, which causes internal a-catenin (bridging extracellular E-cadherin with intracellular actin) to be stretched into an open configuration, leading to the recruitment of vinculin and eventually the orientation of actin towards the same direction of migration as the following cells. Without these E-cadherin interactions, leading cells will exhibit non-directional migration.

== Mechanotaxis in wound healing ==
In wound healing, fluid shear stress plays a large role in the mechanotaxis of endothelial cells to the wound site. The inner lining of blood vessels is composed of these endothelial cells, which means that these cells are continuously experiencing fluid shear stress from blood rushing through the vessels. This mechanical stress on the apical side of the endothelial cells leads to integrin signaling, which involves the recruitment of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Shc, and Crk, and will lead to changes in cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion. These changes involve lamellipodial protrusions and focal adhesion (FA) formation at the front of the cell, as well as the dismantling of FAs at the rear of the cell, and cause endothelial cells to move in the direction of the flow. Constant laminar flow has been found to improve cell migration in wounds and increases the rate of wound closure.
