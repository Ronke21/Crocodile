<text>Francis Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Bacon OBE FREng FRS (21 December 1904 – 24 May 1992) was an English engineer who in 1932 developed the first practical hydrogen–oxygen fuel cell. It is used to generate power for space capsules and satellites.

Bacon was awarded an OBE by Queen Elizabeth II in the 1967 New Year Honours. In 1976, Bacon was a founder fellow of the Fellowship of Engineering (now the Royal Academy of Engineering), the United Kingdom&#x27;s national academy of engineering.

== Life and works ==
Francis Thomas Bacon was born in 1904 at Ramsden Hall, Billericay, Essex, England. An engineer at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1932 he developed the fuel cell which was used as part of the Apollo moon project in the 1960s. Fuel cells were first demonstrated by Sir William Robert Grove in 1839, but his invention lay largely dormant for over 100 years until it was revived by Bacon. The alkaline fuel cell (AFC), also known as the Bacon fuel cell after its inventor, has been used in NASA space programs since the mid-1960s to generate power for satellites and space capsules. The U.S. President Richard Nixon welcomed Bacon to the White House, and told him; &quot;Without you Tom, we wouldn&#x27;t have gotten to the moon.” After the successful lunar landing of Apollo 11 in July 1969, Tom and his wife Barbara met astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins at a reception hosted by British Prime Minister Harold Wilson at 10 Downing Street.

Bacon was a descendant of the family of the philosopher Sir Francis Bacon (who had no children), and he was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. After Cambridge he became an apprentice with the Newcastle engineering firm owned by Sir Charles Parsons, and was strongly influenced by him.

The principle of the fuel cell had been demonstrated by Sir William Grove in 1839 and other investigators had experimented with various forms of fuel cell. However unlike previous workers in the field, Bacon was an engineer and he was comfortable working with machinery operating at high temperatures and pressures. He initially experimented with Grove&#x27;s use of activated platinum gauze with a sulphuric acid electrolyte, but quickly moved on to use activated nickel electrodes with an aqueous potassium hydroxide electrolyte. In January 1940, he moved to a laboratory at King&#x27;s College London and there developed a double cell, with one unit for generating the hydrogen and oxygen gases and the other for the fuel cell proper. This could be reversed so that it acted as both an electrolyser and a fuel cell. Problems were encountered due to the high operating temperatures and pressures and the corrosive nature of the chemicals.

In 1946, under new funding arrangements, the work moved to the Department of Colloid Science at Cambridge University. There Bacon&#x27;s team were shown a sample of porous nickel sheet whose origins were so obscure they were protected by the Official Secrets Act. They used this sheet to develop electrodes with large pores on the gas side and finer ones on the electrolyte side, which created a much more stable interface than had existed previously.

As funding levels increased the apparatus was moved again to what was then the Department of Chemical Engineering. There the team overcame problems of corrosion of the oxygen electrode by soaking the new nickel electrodes in lithium hydroxide solution followed by drying and heating. In 1959, with support from Marshall of Cambridge Ltd. (later Marshall Aerospace) a 5 kW forty-cell battery, with an operating efficiency of 60%, was demonstrated publicly.

The patents for the fuel cell were licensed by Pratt and Whitney as part of a successful bid to provide electrical power for the Apollo program to land man on the moon. The fuel cells were ideal in this regard because they have rising efficiency with decreasing load, unlike heat engines. Hydrogen and oxygen gases were already on board the ship for propulsion and life support, and the by-product water could be used for drinking and humidifying the atmosphere of the capsule.

Towards the later part of his life, Bacon was a consultant for the engineering firm Energy Conversion Limited and Johnson Matthey. He was a Founder Fellow of the Fellowship of Engineering and the first Honorary Member of the European Fuel Cell Group.

<text>Theon Senior is a lunar impact crater that is located to the northwest of the crater Delambre, and south of D&#x27;Arrest. It forms a matching pair with Theon Junior, about two crater diameters to the south-southeast. The satellite crater Theon Senior A can be found to the north. Theon Senior is named for Theon of Smyrna, a 1st-2nd century Greek mathematician and philosopher.

This crater is circular and bowl-shaped, with only a small floor at the center of the steeply sloping interior walls. The crater appears relatively young, as it shows little sign of wear due to impacts. The crater is about 18 kilometers in diameter, and the distance from its rim to the floor is 3470 meters. Theon Senior is from the Eratosthenian period, which lasted from 3.2 to 1.1 billion years ago.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Theon Senior.

<text>W. Bond is an irregularly shaped lunar walled plain that is located in the northern part of the Moon, to the north of the Mare Frigoris. It lies to the east of the crater Birmingham, and south-southwest of Barrow. Epigenes is located just to the northwest of the outer rim. Along the southwest edge, between W. Bond and the lunar mare, is the crater Timaeus.

What remains of the outer rim of W. Bond has been eroded and reshaped until it now consists of little more than an outline of hills and mounts. The most prominent of these is a nearly linear range along the northwest rim, which is divided in half by the satellite crater Epigenes A. The southeast rim is also relatively well defined, but the remainder is irregular, notched, and not very prominent.

The interior floor is relatively flat in comparison with the rim region, although there are sections of rough terrain near the northern rim. In the center of the walled plain is a narrow rille that runs toward the eastern rim. To the southeast of this formation is W. Bond B, a circular, bowl-shaped crater. The smaller W. Bond C is located just to the northeast.

In older publications this formation was identified as W. C. Bond.

<doc id="1104286" wikidata="Q3965203" url="?curid=1104286" title="Kraft Singles">
<text>Kraft Singles is a brand of processed cheese product manufactured and sold by Kraft Heinz. Introduced in 1950, the individually wrapped &quot;slices&quot; are not really slices off a block, but formed separately in manufacturing.

Kraft Singles do not qualify for the &quot;Pasteurized Process Cheese&quot; labeling, as the percentage of milkfat in the product that comes from the added dairy ingredients is greater than 5%. Kraft had used label &quot;Pasteurized Process Cheese Food&quot;, which allows for a greater percentage of added dairy, until the FDA gave a warning in December 2002 stating that Kraft could not legally use that label any longer due to a formulation change that replaced some of the non-fat milk in the recipe with milk protein concentrate, which is not a permitted additive. Kraft complied with the FDA order by changing the label to the current &quot;Pasteurized Prepared Cheese Product&quot;. Kraft Singles contain no vegetable oil or other non-dairy fats.

One of the more famous ad campaigns involved the claim that each slice contained &quot; of milk&quot;, which makes them taste better than imitation cheese slices made mostly with vegetable oil and water and hardly any milk. The campaign was criticized for its implications that each slice contained the same amount of calcium as a glass of milk and also more calcium than imitation cheese slices, which eventually led to a ruling by the Federal Trade Commission in 1992 that ordered Kraft to stop making the misrepresentations in its advertising.

In Australia, the Kraft branding was retired in 2017. Kraft&#x27;s successor company in Australia, Mondelez, sold their cheese products line to Bega Cheese, but retained rights to the Kraft name. Bega switched the name of their sliced cheese product from &quot;Kraft Singles&quot; to &quot;Dairylea Slices&quot;, as Bega acquired the rights to the Dairylea brand in Australia in the deal.

, though around 40 percent of households in the United States continue to buy Kraft Singles, sales have been flat.

==History==
Kraft Singles were introduced in 1950 as &quot;Kraft De Luxe Process Slices&quot;. Initially, they were not wrapped individually; Arnold Nawrocki, an American engineer, developed a machine which did this in August 1956. Kraft introduced individually wrapped cheese slices in 1965. Although Kraft Foods eventually became synonymous with individually wrapped cheese slices, it was Arnold N. Nawrocki and the Clearfield Cheese Company that revolutionized its packaging and marketing. 

In 2023, Kraft updated their packaging for the Kraft Singles, featuring updated branding design along with an easier-to-open wrapper. In January 2024, Kraft introduced three new flavors of Kraft Singles: Caramelized Onion, Jalapeño, and Garlic &amp; Herb.

<text>Sir Ernest Oppenheimer (22 May 1880 – 25 November 1957) was a South African diamond and gold mining entrepreneur, financier and philanthropist, who controlled De Beers and founded the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa.

==Career==
Ernest Oppenheimer was born in Friedberg, German Empire, to a German-Jewish family. He was the son of Edward Oppenheimer, a cigar merchant, and his wife, Nanette (née Hirschhorn) Oppenheimer. He began his working life at 17, when he entered Dunkelsbuhler &amp; Company, a diamond brokerage in London. His efforts impressed his employer and in 1902, at the age of 22, he was sent to South Africa to represent the company as a buyer in Kimberley, of which he went on to become the mayor from 1912 to 1915. In this role, he helped raise the manpower for the Kimberley Regiment for service during World War I.

He became great friends with William Lincoln Honnold, an American engineer and chairman of Transvaal Coal Trust, Brakpan Mines, Springs Mines and The New Era Company. In 1917, they launched the Anglo American Corporation with financial assistance from J. P. Morgan. He was knighted in 1921. The initial capital was £1 million. Half of the capital was subscribed in the United States and half in the United Kingdom and South Africa. He would remain as a permanent director and its chairman until 1953. In 1919, two years after its launch, Anglo American purchased diamond mines in South West Africa, which would pose a challenge to the De Beers diamond business monopoly.

In the 1924 South African general election Oppenheimer stood for, and was elected to, the House of Assembly as the Member for Kimberley. He held the seat until 1938. In 1927, Oppenheimer managed to gain control of the late Cecil Rhodes&#x27; De Beers empire, building and consolidating the company&#x27;s global monopoly over the world&#x27;s diamond industry until his retirement. He gained the chairmanship of De Beers in 1929. Over the course of his chairmanship, Oppenheimer was involved in a number of controversies, including price fixing, antitrust behaviour, and an allegation of not releasing industrial diamonds for the U.S. war effort during the Second World War.

In 1952, he was appointed as a Knight of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem.

==Personal life==
Ernest Oppenheimer married Mary Lina Pollak in 1906 in a Jewish ceremony in London, with a marriage certificate issued by West London Synagogue, a prominent Reform synagogue. The couple had two sons. 

In 1921, he was knighted for his role in the war. He therefore had the honorific title Sir. His wife was therefore called Lady, but she died in 1934.

In 1935, he subsequently remarried to Caroline Magdalen Oppenheimer (née Harvey), widow of Sir Michael, 2nd Baronet Oppenheimer of Stoke Poges.

He died in Johannesburg in 1957. Although he was born into a Jewish family, he converted to Anglicanism in adulthood. His ashes were interred in a niche of the columbarium at Parktown St George&#x27;s Church, Parktown. He was succeeded in the business by his son, Harry Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer&#x27;s brother, Sir Bernard Oppenheimer, was also heavily involved in the diamond industry, himself dying in 1921.

==Legacy==

In 1964, the Oppenheimer Diamond was named in his honour by its owner, Harry Winston, who donated the stone (not a gem, as it remains uncut and unpolished) to the Smithsonian Institution as a memorial.

<text>The Liberhan Commission (officially &quot;Liberhan Ayodhya Commission of Inquiry&quot;) was a long-running inquiry commissioned by the Government of India to investigate the destruction of the disputed structure Babri Masjid in Ayodhya in 1992. Led by retired High Court Judge M. S. Liberhan, it was formed on 16 December 1992 by an order of the Indian Home Union Ministry after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on 6 December and the subsequent riots there. The commission was originally mandated to submit its report within three months. Extensions were given 48 times, and after a delay of 17 years, the one-man commission submitted the report to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 30 June 2009. In November 2009, a day after a newspaper published the allegedly leaked contents of the report, the report was tabled in Parliament by the Home Minister P. Chidambaram.

==Dispute==

The Babri Masjid (Mosque of Babur) was a mosque in Ayodhya on Ramkot Hill. It was destroyed in 1992 when a political rally developed into a riot involving 150,000 people, Despite a commitment to the Indian Supreme Court by the rally organisers that the mosque would not be harmed. More than 2000 people were killed in ensuing riots in many major Indian cities including Mumbai, and Delhi.

The mosque was constructed in 1527 by order of Babur, the first Mughal emperor of India on top of a destroyed Ram temple. Before the 1940s, the mosque was called &quot;Masjid-i-Janmasthan&quot; (&quot;mosque of the birthplace&quot;). Babur&#x27;s commander-in-chief, Mir Baqi, destroyed an existing temple at the site which commemorated the birthplace of Lord Rama, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu and ruler of Ayodhya. The political, historical and socio-religious debate over the history and location of the Babri Mosque and whether a previous temple was demolished or modified to create it, is known as the Ayodhya Debate.

==Duration and expenses==
The one-man panel, one of the country&#x27;s longest-running inquiry commissions, cost the government and wrote the report on the sequence of events leading to the destruction of the Babri mosque by Hindu mobs on 6 December 1992 and the other issues mentioned in terms of reference.

Appointed by former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao two weeks after the demolition on 6 December 1992, to ward off criticism against his government for having failed to protect the mosque, the commission in August 2005 finished hearing its last witness Kalyan Singh – who was Uttar Pradesh chief minister at the time of the demolition and resigned soon after.

In 16 years of its proceedings, the commission recorded statements of several politicians, bureaucrats and police officials including Kalyan Singh, late Narasimha Rao, former deputy prime minister L.K. Advani and his colleagues Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharati as well as Mulayam Singh Yadav.

Top bureaucrats and police officials of Uttar Pradesh, the then district magistrate R.N. Srivastava and Senior Superintendent of Police D.B. Roy of Ayodhya also recorded their statements on the demolition. In all, the Commission examined one hundred witnesses including

#Mark Tully, BBC Journalist
#PR Kumaramangalam, Union Minister
#SB Chavan, Union Home Minister
#Uma Bharti, BJP leader
#KS Sudarshan, RSS leader
#Jyoti Basu, CPI(M) leader, member of the National Integration Council

#Mahant Paramhans Ramchander Das, President, Ram Janambhoomi Nyas
#Mulayam Singh Yadav, Former Chief Minister, Uttar Pradesh

Four years ago, the hearings of the Commission concluded but not before a controversy broke out with the sole Commission&#x27;s Counsel Anupam Gupta dissociating himself from it owing to personal differences with Justice Liberhan.
Advani, Joshi, Bharti and Kalyan Singh, who was the BJP Chief Minister at the time of demolition, appeared before the commission as witnesses. Kalyan Singh appeared only after the Delhi High Court lifted a stay order on his deposition.

Other former officials against whom criminal cases are pending in the demolition of the disputed structure in Ayodhya include Bajrang Dal&#x27;s, Vinay Katiyar.

Even before the findings of the commission were out, Congress and BJP leaders clashed over the issue.

==The contents of the report==

On 23 November 2009, the media began reporting on the contents of the report, which had been leaked before being made available to the legislature. It indicted top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders as being actively involved in the meticulous planning of the demolition of the mosque. It was a day of angry exchanges in parliament and cries of &quot;Shame, shame!&quot; in the Lok Sabha as the opposition accused the Home Ministry of deliberately leaking the report. The Parliament session had to be adjourned for the day. Parliament delayed the discussion of the report and the accompanying Action Taken Report (ATR), which contained mostly recommendations, until 22 December 2009.

The report was finally discussed and debated in the Parliament after a delay caused by demands from some members of the Parliament for the Hindi-translated version of the report. The Lok Sabha debated the report on 8 November 2009 and the Rajya Sabha followed on 10 and 11 November.

The report holds 68 people culpable, including L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and more critically, Kalyan Singh, the then-Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. The report accused the RSS of being the chief architect of the demolition and names it as the core of the Sangh Parivar.

The commission has identified the Kalyan Singh-led BJP government in Uttar Pradesh as the key to the execution of the conspiracy to demolish Babri Masjid. Justice M S Liberhan termed Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi as &quot;pseudo-moderates&quot;, pretending to keep a distance from the Ram Janmabhoomi campaign when they were actually aware of the whole conspiracy. The report said, &quot;They have violated the trust of the people... There can be no greater betrayal or crime in a democracy and this Commission has no hesitation in condemning these pseudo-moderates for their sins of omission&quot;.

==Findings==

Kalyan Singh, who was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh during the mosque&#x27;s demolition, was harshly criticized in the report. He was accused of posting bureaucrats and police officers who would stay silent during the mosque&#x27;s demolition in Ayodhya.
Indicting the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, the one-man commission said in its report: &quot;Kalyan Singh&#x27;s government was the essential component needed by the Sangh Parivar for its purposes. Kalyan Singh lived up to the expectations of the Parivar&quot;.

The commission&#x27;s report said that Singh and his Cabinet allowed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to directly run his government. It also stated that the government had &quot;systematically and in a pre-planned manner removed inconvenient bureaucrats from positions of power, dismantled and diluted the security apparatus and infrastructure, lied consistently to the high court and the Supreme Court of India and to the people of India to evade constitutional governance and thus betrayed the confidence of the electorate&quot;.

The Liberhan Commission stated about the demolition:

To the commission&#x27;s observation that the demolition was planned, Chapter 1: page no 15, para 7.4 of the report wherein it admits: &quot;No evidence, lead or information was provided to the commission with respect to the conspiracy or pre-planning or the joint common enterprise by any of these counsels... (of the Muslim organisations)&quot;.

Moreover, the commission noted (at page 782, para 130.24) that, &quot;...Home Secretary Godbole stated that there was no information of planning and as such it could not be inferred that there was a conspiracy of the Congress and BJP for demolition.&quot;

&quot;The chief minister and his cabinet were the proverbial insiders who caused the collapse of the entire system.&quot;

Singh allegedly maintained a &quot;studied silence&quot; even at the height of the crisis in December 1992 and &quot;refused to allow even a single measure which might impede the Ayodhya campaign or prevent the assault on the disputed structures, the journalists or the innocent people.&quot;

He allegedly did not direct the police &quot;to use force or resort to firing to chase away the miscreants or to save the lives of those wretched innocents...&quot; even though he was alerted that the mosque had been demolished and rioters were attacking Muslims in Ayodhya.

&quot;The wanton violence against human life and property continued unabated and even at that late stage, the chief minister did not use the central forces which could have been swiftly deployed&quot;, the report further states.

Uma Bharti, Govindacharya, Kalyan Singh and Shanker Singh Vaghela, all of whom were members of the BJP then, are held primarily responsible for the destruction of the mosque and the report says that they could have prevented the assault. Senior BJP leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi are called &quot;pseudo-moderates&quot;. The report holds them intellectually and ideologically responsible for the mosque&#x27;s destruction. The report says that they gave false assurances to court, people and the nation. Vajpayee, Prime Minister in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, was not present on 6 December 1992 when the mosque was brought down, but the report says it cannot be assumed that Vajpayee, Advani and others did not know of the designs of the Sangh Parivar.

The Report, headed by Justice Liberhan, contained no criticism of the 1992 Indian government and then Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao. and supports Rao&#x27;s stand that legally and constitutionally, the central government could not impose President&#x27;s Rule in the state of Uttar Pradesh in December 1992.

The report submitted by Justice Liberhan has come under severe criticism for being biased and rhetorical in nature. It has been pointed out that, the report also noted (in para 18.3 on page 63) that &quot;although, there was no order restraining the Muslims from going to the disputed structure or from offering namaz therein either by the judiciary or from the administration, yet namaz was not offered at the disputed structure since 1934. No processions were taken out inside the disputed structure nor any grave dug there about.&quot;

Justice Liberhan has agreed that &quot;Ayodhya is accepted in popular Hindu tradition as the birthplace of Lord Rama and is therefore regarded as a holy and historical city&quot; and &quot;ancient Ayodhya was traditionally the epitome of Hindu life, culture and a paradigm of coexistence of a multi-religious society. It was a peaceful place with a regular influx of visitors, pilgrims, sadhus and sants, monks, travellers, tourists.&quot;

BJP president Rajnath Singh will open the debate on the Liberhan Commission report in the Lok Sabha while Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley is expected to lead the party charge in the Rajya Sabha. The Lok Sabha debated the report on 1 December 2009 and the Rajya Sabha on 7 December 2009. The BJP had initially decided to field Sushma Swaraj as the lead speaker in the Lower House, but she will now be the second speaker on the issue. The performance of its star speakers in both Houses will be keenly watched by the RSS, say party sources. While the initial plan would have seen the quartet of Delhi BJP leaders – Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, in addition to Venkaiah Naidu, and Ananth Kumar – holding forth on the Ayodhya debate, sources say that Rajnath, whose term as party president technically ends on 26 November 2009, &quot;didn&#x27;t want to be left out of the debate&quot;.

Speaking in the Parliament, Jaitley led the charge against the report and against Justice Liberhan personally. Jaitley suggested that Justice Liberhan may not have actually authored the report and, reiterating what Sushma Swaraj had read out in the Lok Sabha, citing from page 999 of the report, commented that Justice Liberhan had credited Commission&#x27;s Counsel Harpreet Singh Giani with helping with the analysis, conclusions, editing and language and therefore called it the &quot;Liberhan-Giani&quot; report. He charged the report with &quot;factual hallucinations&quot;. He cited the incorrect date of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s assassination as well as the inclusion of the names of some historians in the report as evidence.

==RSS, VHP factor==

The Liberhan report has been very critical of mass Hindu organizations,especially the RSS. It says that demolition of Babri in Ayodhya has been a longtime objective of the RSS. It accuses RSS of utilizing its large volunteer base to accomplish this task. The RSS has always maintained that the demolition was spontaneous. The report suggests otherwise.

The Sangh Parivar is a &quot;highly successful and corporatised model of a political party&quot; and as the Ayodhya campaign demonstrated, has developed a highly efficient organisational structure, the Liberhan Commission said in its report.

It said the BJP &quot;was and remains an appendage of the RSS, which had the purpose only of providing an acceptable veneer to the less popular decisions and a facade for the brash members of the Sangh Parivar&quot;.

The commission,observed, &quot;The blame or the credit for the entire temple construction movement at Ayodhya must necessarily be attributed to the Sangh Parivar&quot;.

It noted that the Sangh Parivar is an &quot;extensive and widespread organic body&quot;, which encompasses organisations, which address and assimilate just about every type of social, professional and other demographic grouping of individuals.

&quot;Each time, a new demographic group has emerged, the Sangh Parivar has hived off some of its RSS inner-core leadership to harness that group and bring it within the fold, enhancing the voter base of the Parivar.&quot;

===Open secrets===

A book authored by a former senior Indian intelligence officer revealed that demolition of the historic Babri Mosque at Ayodhya was planned 10 months in advance by Hindu extremist leaders of Rashtriya Sevak Sang (RSS), Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The author, a former Intelligence Bureau Joint Director, Maloy Krishna Dhar in his book &quot;Open Secrets-India&#x27;s intelligence unveiled&quot; pointed out that the blue print for demolition of the mosque was drawn in a meeting held in February 1992 attended by leaders of the extremist Hindu groups.

The leaders agreed to work together.They always maintained that demolition was unprecedented and top leaders had tried to hold back the Karsevaks. He goes on to say that in a meeting on the previous day,the RSS, VHP, BJP and Shiv Sena leaders there was &quot;silent resoluteness and agreement that Ayodhya offered a unique opportunity to take the Hindutva wave to the peak for deriving political benefit. The iron was hot and this was the time to hit.&quot;

Dhar merged with the huge crowd as a journalist and found Shiv Sena activists engaged in vandalism and RSS members inflaming everyone.&quot; L.K. Advani had spat fire from the pulpit but he failed to control the flames. Taped videos substantiated that he was progenitor of the tsunami effect that he failed to control at the vital moment of destiny,&quot; says Dhar claiming to have made a videotape and 70 still photos.

===RSS defence===

Seeking to distance Hindu organisations from the Babri Mosque demolition, RSS chief K C Sudershan said that the Babri Mosque was demolished by government men and not by the Karsevaks. &quot;The mosque was demolished by the government men and not by the Karsevaks,&quot; he said while addressing a gathering of RSS cadre and public at a meeting. Without mentioning whether he was referring to the Kalyan Singh-led-BJP government in power in Uttar Pradesh or the Congress regime at Centre then, he said he was present at Ayodhya and wanted to construct the Ram Temple at an undisputed place but they could not do so as the government men demolished Babri Mosque on 6 December 1992. Sudershan, who spoke in a three-day function of RSS Madhya Bharat Pranth, said that under a conspiracy, the names of the Hindu Organisations like Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal (BD) were dragged in bringing down the structure.

He contested Liberhan Commission&#x27;s claim that demolition of the Babri Mosque was planned and charged &quot;dilly-dally&quot; by the then government of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao was responsible for the incident.

&quot;It was not a planned incident. Because of the dilly-dallying attitude by the then Prime Minister and delay in court judgements, things went out of control as lakhs of people gathered at Ayodhya for kar seva,&quot; Sudarshan told a press conference.

He claimed when the people, who had climbed the canopy of the disputed structure, were unable to break it with heavy hammers and &#x27;saabal&#x27; (long iron rod), the armed forces personnel present there caused the damage to its walls by triggering an explosive. Once the walls collapsed, the entire canopy of the Babri mosque caved in, he said.
He claimed a powerful Congress leader of Maharashtra, whose name he did not disclose, had told him at senior BJP leader late K R Malkani&#x27;s house in Delhi that the party had a plan to dislodge the government headed by Narasimha Rao &quot;in the name of temple movement so that he could replace him&quot;

While K C Sudarshan said this, again after two days, RSS, the mother organization of Bharatiya Janata Party, on Tuesday owned the Ayodhya movement but refused to apologise about what happened in Ayodhya in 1992 which led to demolition of the Babri mosque.
Ram Madhav,a RSS leader and former spokesperson of the Sangh said on a private channel,&quot;We fully own up the movement. We mobilized people. People should respect the sentiment of crores of people. We are not going to apologise. Our agitation echoed the sentiment of the people at the time. It was a spontaneous act of anger by people,&quot; Madhav added.

===VHP===

The VHP said the demolition of Babri mosque was the proudest moment for Hindus and asserted it was committed to building a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya.

&quot;Reports like that of the Liberhan Commission come and go. But, the Hindu culture, which takes pride in its heritage and protects its places of worship, has been in place for ages and will remain so for ever,&quot; VHP leader Praveen Togadia said.&quot;Any symbolic structure left by an invader in Akhand Bharat is a national shame. And the demolition of Babri mosque was the proudest moment for Hindus,&quot; he said in a statement.Togadia asserted the VHP was committed to building a great Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and was ready to make any sacrifice for achieving this.
&quot;A magnificent temple will be built at the site. It is a socio-religious, cultural and legal right of the Hindus,&quot; the VHP secretary general said.

The VHP pointed out that in para 158.3, the commission says it(Ayodhya debate) &quot;...never became a movement...&quot; whereas in para 158.9 &amp; 159.10, it contradicted itself with the contention as to &quot;entire process of the movement&quot; and &quot;...leaders of the movement&quot;.

The VHP says the commission failed to make any adverse comment on certain individuals despite observing in para 26.2 on page 88 that &quot;... It is noteworthy that no member of the Muslim community from Ayodhya was a member of the Babri Masjid Action Committee or other committee protesting the opening of locks at the disputed structure. Sultan Shahabuddin Owaisi, a Member of Parliament from Hyderabad, challenged the opening of locks along with some others became a forerunner for taking on the Hindu organisation&quot;.

The VHP said that after more than 40 extensions &quot;during seventeen long years and wasting taxpayers&#x27; money the commission had prepared a useless report.&quot; The commission declared many prominent personalities as culpable without giving them a chance of hearing.&quot;It is shameful that in its long list of culprits one had already been died before the date of incident and seventeen thereafter before the submission of its report. The adverse comments made towards the apex court of the country, media, head of the State (Governor) and other respectable segments of the society are highly unacceptable,&quot; it said.

==Fiestas Patrias (National Holidays)==
The holidays in November (starting from Separation Day), are called the &quot;Fiestas Patrias&quot; (&quot;National Holidays&quot;).
All of Panama’s National Holidays are in the month of November. On November 3 the country celebrated its separation from Colombia in 1903. Panama became a part of the Great Colombia after receiving its independence from Spain on November 28, 1821. The United States helped in this separation process as they had a vested interest in building the Panama Canal. November 4 is the day of the Panamanian National Symbols which celebrates the flag, coats of arms and national anthem. The 5th of November is the Separation of Colon from Colombia where the last Colombian troops remained. November 10 is the Cry of Independence (from Spain) which is mainly celebrated in La Villa de Los Santos.

These dates are all national festivities, except November 4 which is a work day but most people compensate by working extra hours to be able to take it off. Expect a lot of movement to the countryside, especially on the 3, 4 and 5 of November when most hotels get full. Tourism on the 10 and 28 depends on the holiday being on a Monday or Friday, making it a long weekend.

<doc id="1104310" wikidata="Q6137546" url="?curid=1104310" title="James L. Dolan">
<text>James Lawrence Dolan (born May 11, 1955) is an American businessman, and the executive chairman and chief executive officer of Madison Square Garden Sports and Madison Square Garden Entertainment, and executive chairman of MSG Networks. As the companies&#x27; chairman, Dolan oversees all operations within the company and supervises day-to-day operations of its professional sports teams, the New York Knicks and New York Rangers, as well as their regional sports networks, which include MSG Network and MSG Plus. Dolan was previously CEO of Cablevision, founded by his father, until its sale in June 2016 to European telecom conglomerate Altice.

==Early life and education==
Dolan is one of six children of Cablevision founder Charles Dolan and his wife, Helen Ann Dolan, and nephew of Cleveland Guardians owner Larry J. Dolan. He is of Irish descent. After originally pursuing a career in music, Dolan eventually switched to a major in communications at SUNY New Paltz and began working for Cablevision in various capacities including sales before eventually being dispatched to Cleveland by his father to manage the launching of a sports radio station. In 1995, he was made CEO of Cablevision. Throughout his early adult life, Dolan battled drug and alcohol problems and was reportedly known for having a volatile temper. In 1993, he went to drug rehabilitation at the Hazelden clinic in Center City, Minnesota.

==Business career==
Dolan opposed his father&#x27;s proposed Voom satellite service, which became a polarizing controversy among Cablevision&#x27;s board of directors. While supporters argued Voom could propel Cablevision into the future emerging satellite market and a wider customer base, opponents of the plan, including James Dolan, argued it was too expensive with no expense relief for the foreseeable future. In the end, the younger Dolan prevailed and Voom was shut down. This was an instrumental event in Dolan emerging from his father&#x27;s shadow, albeit reluctantly, as a viable businessman.

His business career has included multiple failures, which include purchasing the failing Wiz electronics and entertainment chain, which ended up posting losses of $250 million before being liquidated, and the Clearview Cinemas chain which failed to generate any significant revenue.

==Philanthropy==
Dolan fostered Cablevision&#x27;s philanthropic partnership with The Lustgarten Foundation, a private supporter of pancreatic cancer research. Together with Charles Dolan and former Cablevision Vice Chairman and Madison Square Garden Chairman Marc Lustgarten. Dolan established the Foundation in 1998. In 2008, Cablevision made a multi-year commitment to underwrite the Foundation&#x27;s costs, ensuring that 100 percent of every donation goes to researching this disease. With Dolan&#x27;s backing, Cablevision used its assets to advance the curePC campaign, aimed at increasing public awareness of pancreatic cancer and is responsible for organizing the Holiday Rock &amp; Roll Bash, the Foundation&#x27;s annual fundraiser.

Dolan played a role in organizing the recent &quot;12-12-12&quot; benefit concert, which raised an initial $50 million for the victims of Hurricane Sandy, with additional money still coming in. Other benefit concerts included &quot;The Concert For New York City,&quot; which generated more than $35 million in aid for 9/11 victims and heroes, and &quot;From The Big Apple to The Big Easy,&quot; which raised nearly $9 million for Hurricane Katrina relief. Dolan supports MSG&#x27;s ongoing commitment to the community, particularly through the Garden of Dreams Foundation, the non-profit charity that partners with MSG to help children facing obstacles throughout the New York metropolitan area.

==Sports management==
In 1994, Paramount Communications, the owner of Madison Square Garden, was acquired by Viacom, who in turn sold the MSG properties to Cablevision and ITT Corporation, which had 50% ownership each. ITT sold its share to Cablevision three years later.

In 1999, Dolan was given an increased role in managing Cablevision&#x27;s sports properties and is now the primary manager of these assets. The teams under his domain include most notably the National Basketball Association&#x27;s New York Knicks, the National Hockey League&#x27;s New York Rangers, the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association&#x27;s New York Liberty, and the American Hockey League&#x27;s Hartford Wolf Pack.

As Chairman of Madison Square Garden, he supervises day-to-day operations of its professional sports teams and regional sports networks, which include MSG Network and MSG Plus. He is a governor of the Knicks and Rangers to their respective leagues.

===Controversies===

====New York Knicks====
Like the Rangers, the Knicks performed abysmally in the early 2000s. Unlike the Rangers, they have yet to fully recover, which fans mostly blame on Dolan&#x27;s management missteps. Although the Knicks made the NBA Finals in 1999, they did not post another winning season until the 2012–13 season. Furthermore, the Knicks did not make the playoffs at any point between the 2003–04 and 2010–11 seasons, which both ended in the first round with four-game sweeps of the Knicks. In 2007, NBA Commissioner David Stern criticized Dolan&#x27;s management of the Knicks, saying &quot;they&#x27;re not a model of intelligent management.&quot; 

In 2007, Dolan was named as a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit submitted by a former Knicks executive, Anucha Browne-Sanders. Browne-Sanders accused Dolan of firing her out of spite after she complained about sexual harassment from Isiah Thomas. The court ruled in favor of Brown-Sanders and Dolan had to pay $3 million of the $11 million settlement. MSG was responsible for paying the remainder of the settlement.

====New York Rangers====
After winning the Stanley Cup in 1994, the Rangers saw a decline in performance in the wake of Dolan&#x27;s increased role in managing the team and failed to make the playoffs from the 1997–98 season until the 2004–05 NHL lockout, despite leading the league in payroll in most of those years. This was the longest playoff drought in the franchise&#x27;s history, in part due to questionable, expensive free-agent signings, such as Eric Lindros, Pavel Bure, and Theo Fleury. However, since the resolution of the NHL lockout in 2005, Dolan allowed general manager Glen Sather to rebuild the team from the ground up. That rebuild led to a revival of the club and the organization. The improvement was obvious when the team made it to the Eastern Conference finals in 2012, for the first since 1997. The team finally made it back to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2014, 20 years after they last won the cup.

====Facial Recognition to Ban &quot;Enemies&quot; from Venues====
In 2022, it was reported that Dolan had instituted a policy of using facial recognition at his venues to prevent admission to attorneys whose law firms were engaged in legal disputes with Dolan and his businesses, even when those attorneys had legitimate tickets to the show or event. This led to lawsuits and an investigation into whether Dolan&#x27;s venues should be stripped of their state-issued liquor licenses. 

====New York Liberty====
On May 5, 2015, Dolan announced that Isiah Thomas would be president of the WNBA&#x27;s Liberty. Considering Thomas&#x27; history being both a failed President/GM of the Knicks and Thomas being implicated in the Anucha Browne-Sanders sexual harassment incident, Dolan&#x27;s judgment was questioned by many fans and members of the press.

==Media policies==
Dolan rarely speaks with members of the media and communicates to the press through released statements or in interviews with MSG Network. In 2000, Dolan instituted media training for all Garden employees who might deal with the press and instituted an ironclad rule against team personnel criticizing others in the organization via the media. Under Dolan&#x27;s watch MSG implemented controversial media policies limiting access to players. Some of these measures included prohibiting reporters and Knicks&#x27; beat writers from interviewing players without an MSG public relations official present, forbidding one-on-one interviews, and banning writers who write articles critical of the organization. The policies also forbid the MSG Network from being critical of the Knicks and the Rangers, regardless of their performance. Such measures were not standard practice for other NBA teams.

==Personal life==
Dolan lives on Long Island with his wife Kristin, whom he named the chief executive officer of AMC Networks in 2023. He has been married twice and has six sons. He contributed to Donald Trump&#x27;s 2020 presidential reelection campaign.

===Hobbies===
Dolan performs blues-inspired rock as the singer for JD &amp; the Straight Shot; their seventh studio album &quot;The Great Divide&quot; was released in March 2019. The band has been described as a vanity project.

===Sexual assault lawsuit===
On January 16, 2024, a sexual assault lawsuit was filed against Dolan in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by Kellye Croft, a former massage therapist who alleged Dolan pressured her into giving him &quot;unwanted sexual intercourse&quot; when his band JD &amp; the Straight Shot was touring with the Eagles in 2013. Kellye stated that she was employed for the Eagles in 2013 during the band&#x27;s History of the Eagles – Live in Concert tour, which JD &amp; the Straight Shot opened concerts for; Dolan was believed to have provided a large sum of money for the tour as well. In her lawsuit, Croft also alleged Dolan set her up to be molested by Harvey Weinstein in January 2014.

<doc id="1104312" wikidata="Q10393" url="?curid=1104312" title="Bogor">
<text>Bogor City (Indonesian: &quot;Kota Bogor&quot;), or Bogor (, ), is a city in the West Java province of Indonesia. Located around south of the national capital of Jakarta, Bogor is the 6th largest city in the Jakarta metropolitan area and the 14th overall nationwide. The city covers an area of 111.39 km2, and it had a population of 950,334 at the 2010 Census and 1,043,070 at the 2020 Census. The official population estimate as at the end of 2023 was 1,127,408. 

Bogor is an important center of economy, science, cultural heritage and tourism in Indonesia because this city is a mountainous area that used to be a resting place for Dutch nobles during the Dutch colonial period because of its cool climate and the many classical European-style buildings in the city. During the Middle Ages, the city served as the capital of the Sunda Kingdom () and was called Pakuan Pajajaran or Dayeuh Pakuan. During the Dutch colonial era, it was named Buitenzorg (&quot;without worries&quot; in Dutch) and served as the summer residence of the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies.

With several hundred thousand people living in an area of about , the central part of Bogor is one of the world&#x27;s most densely populated areas. The city has a presidential palace and a botanical garden () – one of the oldest and largest in the world. It bears the nickname &quot;Rainy City&quot; (&quot;Kota Hujan&quot;), because of frequent rain showers, even during the dry season. 

In the 1990s–2000s, the city regularly hosted various international events, such as ministry-level meetings of the Asia-Pacific institutions and the APEC summit of 15 November 1994.

==History==
===Precolonial period===
The first mention of a settlement at present Bogor dates to the 5th century when the area was part of Tarumanagara, one of the earliest states in Indonesian history. After a series of defeats by the neighboring Srivijaya, Tarumanagara was transformed into the Sunda Kingdom, and in 669, the capital of Sunda was built between two parallel rivers, the Ciliwung and Cisadane. It was named Pakuan Pajajaran, in old Sundanese meaning &quot;a place between the parallel [rivers]&quot;, and became the predecessor of the modern Bogor.

Over the next several centuries, Pakuan Pajajaran became one of the largest cities in medieval Indonesia with a population reaching 48,000. The name Pajajaran was then used from the 16th century for the entire kingdom, and the capital was simply called Pakuan. The chronicles of that time were written in Sanskrit, which was the language used for official and religious purposes, using the Pallava script, on rock steles called &quot;prasasti&quot;. The prasasti found in and around Bogor differ in shape and text style from other Indonesian prasasti and are among the main attractions of the city.

From the 9th-15th centuries, the capital moved between Pakuan and other cities of the kingdom, and finally returned to Pakuan by King Siliwangi (&quot;Sri Baduga Maharaja&quot;) on 3 June 1482 – the day of his coronation. Since 1973, this date is celebrated in Bogor as an official city holiday.

In 1579, Pakuan was captured and almost completely destroyed by the army of the Sultanate of Banten, causing the existence of the State of Sunda to cease. The city was abandoned and remained uninhabited for decades.

===Colonial period===

====Dutch East India Company====

In the second half of the 17th century, the abandoned Pakuan as with most of West Java, while formally remaining under the Sultanate of Banten, gradually passed under the control of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). The formal transition occurred on 17 April 1684 with a signed agreement between the Crown Prince of Banten and the VOC.

The first, and temporal, colonial settlement at Pakuan was a camp of lieutenant Tanoejiwa, a Sundanese employed by the VOC who was sent in 1687 to develop the area. It was seriously damaged by the eruption on 4–5 January 1699 of the Mount Salak volcano (). However, the concomitant forest fires removed much forest, leaving much area for the planned rice and coffee plantations. In a short time, several agricultural settlements appeared around Pakuan, the largest being Kampung Baru (lit. &quot;new village&quot;).
In 1701, they were combined into an administrative district; Tanoejiwa was chosen as the head of the district and is regarded as the founder of the modern Bogor Regency.

The district was further developed during the 1703 Dutch mission headed by the Inspector General of the VOC Abraham van Riebeeck (the son of the founder of Cape Town Jan van Riebeeck and later Governor of Dutch East Indies). The expedition of van Riebeeck performed a detailed study of the Pakuan ruins, discovered and described many archaeological artifacts, including prasasti, and erected buildings for the VOC employees. The area attracted the Dutch by a favorable geographical position and mild climate, preferred over the hot Batavia which was then the administrative center of the Dutch East Indies. In 1744–1745, the residence of the Governor-General was built in Pakuan which was hosting the government during the summer.

In 1746, by the order of the Governor-General Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff, the Palace, a nearby Dutch settlement and nine native settlements were merged into an administrative division named Buitenzorg (Dutch for &quot;beyond (or outside) concerns&quot;, meaning &quot;without worries&quot; or &quot;carefree&quot;, cf. Frederick the Great of Prussia&#x27;s summer palace outside Potsdam, Sanssouci, with the same meaning in French). Around the same time, the first reference to &quot;Bogor&quot; as the local name of the city was documented; it was mentioned in the administration report from 7 April 1752 with respect to the part of Buitenzorg adjacent to the Palace. Later this name became used for the whole city as the local alternative to Buitenzorg. This name is believed to originate from the Javanese word &quot;bogor&quot; meaning sugar palm (&quot;Arenga pinnata&quot;) or &quot;bokor&quot; (a large bowl made from metal), which is still used in the Indonesian language. Alternative origins are the old-Javanese word &quot;bhagar&quot; (meaning cow), or simply the misspelling of &quot;Buitenzorg&quot; by the local residents.

The city grew rapidly in the late 18th – early 19th centuries. This growth was partly stimulated by the temporary occupation of the Dutch East Indies by the United Kingdom in 1811–1815 – the British landed on Java and other Sunda Islands to prevent their capture by Napoleonic France which then conquered the Netherlands. The head of the British administration Stamford Raffles moved the administrative center from Batavia to Buitenzorg and implemented new and more efficient management techniques.

====Rule of the Kingdom of the Netherlands====

After Buitenzorg was returned to the Dutch, it fell under the rule of the Kingdom of the Netherlands rather than VOC. The Buitenzorg Palace was reinstated as the summer residence of the Governor-General. The surrounding territory was also organized into a new Residency, the Buitenzorg Residency. A botanical garden was set up nearby in 1817, which was one of the world&#x27;s largest gardens in the 19th century.
On 10 October 1834, Buitenzorg was seriously damaged by another eruption of the Salak volcanoes caused by an earthquake. Taking into account the seismic activity of the region, the governor&#x27;s palace and office buildings constructed in 1840–1850 were built shorter but sturdier than those built prior to the eruption. The Governor&#x27;s decree of 1845 prescribed separate settlements of European, Chinese and Arab migrants within the city.

In 1860–1880, the largest agricultural school in the colony was established in Buitenzorg. Other scientific institutions including a city library, natural science museum, biology, chemistry, and veterinary medicine laboratories were also constructed during this period. During this time, in 1867, the Buitenzorg Residency was downgraded from a full Residency to an Assistant Residency. By the end of the 19th century, Buitenzorg became one of the most developed and westernized cities in Indonesia.

In 1904, Buitenzorg formally became the administrative center of the Dutch East Indies. However, real management remained in Batavia, which hosted most of the administrative offices and the main office of the governor. This status was revoked in the administrative reform of 1924, which divided the colony into provinces and made Buitenzorg seat of the new Buitenzorg Residency and center of West Java Province.

===1942–1950===
During World War II, Buitenzorg and the entire territory of the Dutch East Indies were occupied by Japanese forces; the occupation lasted from 6 March 1942 until the summer of 1945. As part of the efforts by the Japanese to promote nationalist (and thus anti-Dutch) sentiments among the local population the city was given the Indonesian name Bogor. The city had one of the major training centres of the Indonesian militia PETA (Pembela Tanah Air – &quot;Defenders of the Motherland&quot;).
On 17 August 1945, Sukarno and Hatta proclaimed independence, but the Dutch regained control of the town and adjoining areas. In February 1948, Buitenzorg was included in the quasi-independent state of West Java,() which was renamed Pasundan in April 1948 (). This state was established by the Netherlands as a step to transform their former colonial possessions in the East Indies into a dependent federation. In December 1949, Pasundan joined the Republic of the United States of Indonesia (, RIS) established at the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference of 23 August2 November 1949. In February 1950, as a result of defeat of Pasundan in a quick military conflict with the Republic of Indonesia, the city became part of Indonesia, as formalized in August 1950, and its name was officially declared as Bogor.

===Independence period===
As part of independent modern Indonesia, Bogor has a significant role in the cultural, scientific, and economic development of the country and West Java in particular – in part due to the legacy of infrastructure built during the colonial period. Its special position was further reinforced by the transformation of the former summer residence of the governor-general into the summer palace of the President of Indonesia.

==Geography==

The city is situated in the western part of Java island, about 53 km south of the metropolis of Jakarta and 85 km northwest of the city of Bandung, the administrative center of West Java Province. Bogor spreads over a basin near the volcanoes of Salak (which peaks at about 12 km south) and Mount Gede (whose top is 22–25 km south-east of the city). The average elevation is 265 meters, maximum 330 m, and minimum 190 meters above sea level. The terrain is rather uneven: 17.64 km2 of its area has slopes of 0–2°, 80.9 km2 from 2° to 15°, 11 km2 between 15° and 25°, 7.65 km2 from 25° to 40° and 1.20 km2 over 40°; the northern part is relatively flat and the southern part is more hilly.

The soils are dominated by volcanic sedimentary rocks. Given the proximity of large active volcanoes, the area is considered highly seismic. The total area of green space is 205,000 m2, of which 87,000 m2 are Bogor Botanical Gardens, 19,400 m2 are taken by 35 parks, 17,200 m2 by 24 groves and 81,400 m2 are covered with grass.

Several rivers flow through the city toward the Java Sea. The largest ones, Ciliwung and Cisadane, flank the historic city center. Smaller rivers, Cipakancilan, Cidepit, Ciparigi and Cibalok, are guided by cement tubes in many places. It is worth noting that &quot;ci&quot; in the river names merely means &quot;river&quot; in Sundanese, and the actual name begins after it, but the &quot;ci&quot; is nevertheless included in national and international maps. There are several small lakes within the city, including Situ Burung (lit. Bird Lake; &quot;Situ&quot; meaning &quot;Lake&quot;) and Situ Gede (lit. Great Lake), each with an area of several hectares. Rivers and lakes occupy 2.89% of the city area.

===Climate===
Bogor has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) according to the Köppen climate classification, and more humid and rainy than in many other areas of West Java – the average relative humidity is 70%, the average annual precipitation is about 1700 mm, but more than 3500 mm in some areas. Most rain falls between December and February. Because of this weather, Bogor has the nickname &quot;Rain City&quot; (). The temperatures are lower than in coastal Java: the average maximum is 25.9 °C (cf. 32.2 °C in Jakarta). Daily fluctuations (9–10 °C) are rather high for Indonesia. The absolute maximum temperature was recorded at 38 °C and the minimum at 3 °C.

==Demographics==
The New American Cyclopaedia of 1867 reported Buitenzorg&#x27;s population as being 320,756, including 9,530 Chinese, 650 Europeans, and 23 Arabs.

===Population===
According to the national census held in May–August 2010, 949,066 people were registered in Bogor. The average population density was about 8,000 people per km2; it reached 12,571 persons per km2 in the centre and drops to 5,866 people per km2 in the southern part. Based on official figures from Dukcapil Kemendagri, the city&#x27;s population at the end of 2023 was 1,127,408 people, giving a population density of 10,121 people per km2.

The rapid population growth in Bogor after 1960 is related to urbanization as well as the influx of workforce from other parts of the country. The birth rate in 2009 was 563 children per 10,000 people, with the mortality value of 272. During the same year, 12,709 permanent resident moved in and 3,391 people left the city. Men constituted 51.06% and women 48.94% of the population; 28.39% of the inhabitants were under 15 years old, 67.42% were aged 15–65 years and 3.51% – over 65 years. The 2005 estimate of the life expectancy was 71.8 years, which is the highest figure for West Java and one of the highest in Indonesia.

The majority of population (93%) are Muslims with about 6% Christians. However, there are many Christian churches in the city, as well as Buddhist (mostly in the Chinese community) and Hindu communities.

Since 2008, a Christian church congregation in Bogor has been embroiled in conflict with Islamic fundamentalists over the building permit for their new church.

===Ethnic groups===
According to 2000 Census, most of the population are Sundanese (76%) as native, with the largest immigrant minorities being Betawi, Javanese, Chinese, and other, often mixed ethnicities.

Table based on Ethnicities in the 2000 Indonesian Population Census below;

==Administrative districts==
Bogor City is surrounded by the Bogor Regency (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) but in itself is a separate municipality (&quot;kota&quot;), making Bogor City an enclave within Bogor Regency. The city is divided into six districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), which contain 68 urban villages (&quot;kelurahan&quot;). The districts are tabulated below with their populations at the 2010 and 2020 Censuses, together with the official estimates at the end of 2023. The table also includes the number of administrative villages (all classed as urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;) in each district, and their post codes.

===Administration===
The city is headed by a mayor, who is elected by the citizens every five years, together with a vice-mayor; in the past, the mayor was appointed by the provincial administration. Diani Budiarto became the first directly elected mayor of Bogor on 25 October 2008 and assumed his position on 7 April 2009. Legislative power is provided by the Bogor City Regional House of Representatives which consists of 50 directly elected members serving 5-year terms.
The Coat of arms of Bogor is a rectangular heraldic shield with a pointed base and the side lengths ratio of 5:4, divided by a cross into four parts. The upper left quarter contains the National emblem of Indonesia – the mythical bird Garuda, in the upper right is the presidential palace, in the bottom left is the Salak volcano, and in the lower right is the national Sundanese dagger &quot;kujang&quot;. The inscription on top reads &quot;KOTA BOGOR&quot;, which translates to &quot;THE CITY OF BOGOR&quot;.

==Culinary==

The typical cuisine of Bogor is soto mie bogor, a kind of soup made from noodles and vermicelli, cabbage, tomatoes, (cartilage and beef tendons) and tripe, spring roll risoles, served in broth, added with sweet soy sauce, sprinkled with fried onions and chili sauce, Asinan is a kind of preserved vegetable or fruit salad from the many types and variations of pickles in Indonesia, the most popular are pickled vegetables and pickled fruit. and many more types, for example Toge goreng and rujak. 

There are two culinary centers in the city of Bogor, the first near the or better known as Alun-alun kota bogor which is a city park which is a gathering place for city residents to carry out social, cultural, and recreational activities. The Bogor City Square was inaugurated by the Bogor City Government on Friday, December 17, 2021 and the second is on Suryakencana Street, this street is a Chinatown area, visitors will find houses of native Chinese residents and buildings from ancient times because this area has indeed functioned as a commercial area since the Dutch colonial era.

==Tourism==

At a national tourism exhibition of 2010 in Jakarta, Bogor was recognized as the most attractive tourist city in Indonesia. The city and its surrounding area are visited by about 1.8 million people per year, of whom more than 60,000 are foreigners.

The main tourist attraction is the Bogor Botanical Garden. Founded in 1817, it contains more than 6,000 species of tropical plants. Besides, about 42 bird species breed within the garden, although this number is declining and was 62 before 1952. The garden&#x27;s 87-hectare area within the city was supplemented in 1866 by a 120-hectare park in suburban town of Cibodas. Much of the original rainforest was preserved within the garden providing specimens for scientific studies. The garden was also enriched by collections of palms, bamboos, cacti, orchids and ornamental trees. It became famous in the late 19th century and was visited by naturalists from abroad to conduct scientific research. For example, the Russian St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences had a Buitenzorg scholarship for young scientists to work at Bogor. 

On the grounds of the botanic garden, there is a cemetery established in 1784. It contains 42 historical graves of the Dutch colonial officials, military officers, and scientists, who served in Bogor, Jakarta, and other cities in West Java from the late 18th to early 20th centuries. Nearby, there are three graves from the early Sunda Kingdom (15th century): the wife of the founder of Bogor Siliwangi, Galuh Mangku Alam, vizier Ba&#x27;ul, and commander Japra. The locals regard these individuals as the city&#x27;s patrons. The staff of Bogor garden also administer three other major gardens of Indonesia: the Cibodas Botanical Garden founded 1862 in West Java, the Purwodadi Botanical Garden in East Java and the Bali Botanic Garden founded in 1959 on Bali island.
Another tourist attraction is the presidential palace with the total area of 28 hectares, including 1.8492 hectares of the palace buildings. The palace is surrounded by a park with a small pond. The park is home to a herd of tame deer and is open to the public most of the year. The palace is accessible during holidays, such as the City Day and Independence Day; it has a collection of 450 paintings and 360 sculptures.
Bogor was the capital of the Sundanese kingdom in the Middle Ages. Sundanese culture dominates as in other areas of West Java. The city and its suburbs contain dozens of medieval stone stelae (prasasti). Fifteen inscriptions of the greatest historical and cultural value are collected in a special museum, one of which is the Batutulis inscription. In the southern part of Bogor city there is the tomb of Raden Saleh, a famous 19th-century Dutch East Indies painter and in the western part of Bogor city there is a large lake Gede (area 6 hectares) surrounded by protected forest areas and forest parks. In the protected area there are several research facilities, and recreational areas host sports, boating, and fishing activities.

Bogor is one of the leading cities of Indonesia by the number of museums, some of which are among the oldest and largest in the country. The Zoological Museum () which was opened in 1894 by the Dutch colonial administration as an adjunct to the Botanic Gardens and contains thousands of exhibits. Other prominent museums are more recent. The museum of ethnobotany () was opened in 1982 and has more than 2000 exhibits; the museum of the earth (, 1988) displays hundreds of soil and rock samples from different parts of Indonesia; the museum of the struggle (, 1957) is devoted to the history of the Indonesian national liberation movement;
and Pembela Tanah Air Museum (1996) reflects the history of the Indonesian military militia PETA (Pembela Tanah Air – &quot;Defenders of the Motherland&quot;) created during World War II by the Japanese occupation administration.

Other historical places are Bogor Cathedral – built in 1750, it is one of the oldest operational Catholic churches in Indonesia, and the Buddhist temple Hok Tek Bio, built in 1672 in the classical southern Chinese style. It is the first Buddhist temple in Bogor and one of the oldest in Indonesia. The Jaksa Waterfall is located near the city. It is located within a picturesque lowland rainforest setting.

The city has a drama theater, dozens of movie theaters, nine of which (as of mid-2010) are built to international standards. The presidential palace, administrative buildings, and universities regularly host art exhibitions, and there are regular festivals of folk art, conferences, and culture-related seminars, such as the Congress of Indonesian culture () of 2008. Besides all the tourist attractions above, Bogor also offers a variety of shopping malls or stores including Botani Square, Bogor Trade Mall, Lippo Plaza, Plaza Indah Bogor, etc. 

Bogor launched a bus service that can go around the city of Bogor called which starts their tour at Bogor Botanical Gardens. The bus route will start from Alun-alun Botani and end at the same place. This service was inaugurated by Bogor Mayor Bima Arya on January 1, 2017. This bus is called UNCAL, which means &quot;Unforgettable City Tour in a Fun City&quot;.

==Economy==
Bogor has developed automotive, chemical, and food industries; its outlying areas are used for agriculture. During the colonization, Bogor was mostly producing coffee, rubber and high-quality timber. Chemical industry was introduced to the city at the end of the 19th century, and car and metal production in the 1950s, during the industrialization of independent Indonesia. The fast economic development of the 1980s was slowed down by the crisis of the 1990s and recovered in the early 2000s; so the growth rate of the economy in Bogor was 5.78% in 2002, 6.07% in 2003 and 6.02% in 2009. At the end of 2009, the Gross Regional Product (GRP) was 12.249 trillion IDR (approximately US$1.287 billion) and the investments amounted to 932.295 billion IDR.

Despite the economic growth, the number of citizens living below the poverty level (defined by not only income, but also access to basic social services) is increasing, primarily due to the inflow of poor residents from the surrounding rural areas. In 2009, 17.45% of the population lived below the poverty level, almost twice as high than in 2006 (9.5%) Minimum wage is established by the West Java Governor at 2,658,155 IDR/month.

In 2008 there were 3,208 officially registered industrial enterprises in Bogor employing 54,268 people, more than half (32,237) of whom worked at the 114 largest companies. The outskirts of the city contain about 3,466 hectares of agricultural area, including 111 hectares of water bodies used for fishery and fish farming. The main crops are rice (1165 hectares as of 2007, the annual harvest in 2003 was 9,953 tonnes), various vegetables (772 acres, 8,296 tonnes), corn (382 acres, 6,720 tonnes) and sweet potato (480 acres, 3,480 tonnes). The livestock sector has 25 registered companies (as of 2007) mostly breeding cows (more than 1000 animals yielding more than 2.61 million liters of milk), sheep (about 12,000), chickens (more than 642,000) and ducks (ca. 8,000).

About 25–30 tonnes of various species of fish are produced per year by 4 registered companies. The fishes are mostly bred artificially, in ponds and paddy fields. Breeding aquarium fish and also catching them in their natural habitat is an important industry sector, which yielded US$367,000 from 2008 export sales only, mostly to Japan and Middle East. A substantial part of other Bogor production, 144 billion IDR in 2008, is exported. Examples are clothes and footwear (to US, EU, ASEAN, Canada, Australia, Russia), textiles (US, New Zealand), furniture (South Korea), car tires (ASEAN countries and South America), toys and souvenirs (Japan, Germany, Brazil), soft drinks (ASEAN countries and Middle East). Most of the local sells are carried out via the eight major shopping centers, nine supermarkets and seven major markets.

==Transport==

Bogor is a major transport center of Java. It contains 599.2 kilometers of roads (as of 2008) which cover 5.31% of the city area; 30.2 kilometers of the roads are of national and 26.8 km of prefectural importance. The 22 transport lines are operated by 3,506 buses and minibuses. In addition, 10 bus routes connect the city with the nearest metropolitan area (4,612 buses) and 40 with other cities of West Java (330 buses).

There are two major bus terminals, Baranangsiang and Bubulak. The former has an area of 22,100 m2 and is dedicated to long-distance and freight traffic while the latter (area 11,850 m2) serves urban passenger routes. A separate station is dedicated to tourist coaches and buses to the nearest Soekarno–Hatta International Airport in Jakarta, located about 55 kilometers from Bogor. Recent years have seen a significant increase in the number of traditional Indonesian rickshaw (&quot;becak&quot;) at more than 2,000 units as of 2009. The Bogor railway station was built in 1881, and currently serves about 50,000 passengers and has about 70 departures and 70 arrivals per day. The Bogor Paledang railway station opened in 2013 to serve trains to Sukabumi.

==Housing and facilities==
Residential buildings occupy 26.46% of the city, or 71.11% of its built-up area; 5–14-storey buildings dominate the central part and the outlying areas are mostly built up with single-storeyed houses. The population rise in the 1990s–2000s due to the inflow of external workforce sharply increased the number of substandard housing, mainly on the outskirts of the city. More than half of the slums (1,242,490 m2) are located in northern Bogor, whereas their area is only 89,780 m2 in the southern part of the city. To improve this situation, the city administration launched a program of construction of cheap housing types (light prefabricated houses) in western Bogor. These houses combine reasonable rent ($22 per year) at acceptable living conditions.

Electricity to Bogor is supplied by the Indonesian state company Perusahaan Listrik Negara, which serves the provinces of West Java and Banten. Electricity is provided by more than ten regional thermal and hydroelectric power plants via two local transformer stations located in the Bogor districts of Cimahpar and Cibilong. Whereas most of the houses (excluding some slum areas) are provided with electricity, street lighting covers only 35.38% of the city (4,193 light sources, as of 2007), however, the number of street lights is increasing at an annual rate of 10–15%.

As of 2009, only 47% of Bogor is provided with clean tap water through a centralized water supply systems managed by state-owned Tirta Pakuan. The municipal system takes water from rivers Cisadane (1240 liters per second), and three natural sources: Kota Batu, Bentar-Kambing and Tangka (410 liters per second). Although the water network has a total length of 741 kilometers and covers about 70% of the city, connection to it is often problematic for financial and technical reasons. More than half of residents use water wells or natural reservoirs.

Garbage collection service covers 67% of the urban area. From about 800,000 m3 of waste per year, about 90% is buried at an external landfill at Galuga, about 7% is recycled for compost and about 3% is burned in five incinerators within the city.

The seven cemeteries of Bogor are named by the city districts as Cilendek, Kayumanis, Situgede, Mulyaharja, Blender, Dreded and Gunung Gadung. The first six have the status of &quot;public cemeteries&quot; (), and have no restrictions by religion or ethnicity. However, given the religious composition of Bogor, the cemeteries are predominantly Muslim, and Christian graves are located either in separate areas of cemeteries or in a small cemetery adjacent to churches. Some mosques also have small burial plots. Graves for the poor and nameless are mostly located at Kayumanis, and Gunung Gadung cemetery is restricted to Chinese residents.

==Education==

Bogor is one of the major scientific and educational centers in Indonesia. A significant part of academic and research base was laid in the period of Dutch colonization. In particular, since the beginning of the 19th century, there were established laboratories and professional schools focused primarily on improving the efficiency of colonial agriculture. In the late 19th – early 20th centuries major scientific institutions were established – the Research Institute and Rubber Research Institute of Forest.

The prevailing profile of research and academic activity was retained in Bogor Indonesia after gaining independence. As in the second half of the 20th century, in the 2000s the strongest areas were agricultural, biology, and veterinary sciences. The main educational and scientific center with the utmost national importance is IPB University, which in addition to educational facilities, includes dozens of research centers and laboratories.

Bogor hosts the global headquarters of the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), an international organization conducting research on forestry and human development. The headquarters of the Organisation for the Preservation of Birds and their Habitat are also in Bogor.


The literacy rate in Bogor (98.7%) is relatively high for Indonesia. IPB University () is the main agricultural university of the country. It was founded in 1963 based on the agricultural college, which was established back in the 19th century by the Dutch colonial administration. The largest private universities are Pakuan, Juanda, Nusa Bangsa and Ibn Khaldun. In addition to regular schools, there are over 700 Muslim schools (madrasah) and several Christian schools and colleges.

Most scientific research in Bogor is carried out in agriculture, soil science, dendrology, veterinary and ichthyology. More specific areas include natural pesticides and repellents, intercropping, industrial applications of essential oils and natural alkaloids, increasing yields of various kinds of pepper, improving preservation processes, etc.

==Health==
The first hospitals were established in Bogor in the first half of the 19th century by the Dutch authorities. By the early 20th century, there were several civilian hospitals, a military hospital, and a large psychiatric hospital with doctors from Europe and North America. In the 1930s, the Dutch Red Cross Society hospital became the largest in the city. Most of the existing hospitals and clinics were built in the 1980s–1990s. They include 10 hospitals, 373 private clinics, 51 single-doctor clinics, and 134 pharmacies and drug stores, and employ 274 general practitioners, 122 dentists, 74 sanitation doctors, 37 radiologists (X-ray), 141 gynaecologists, 32 nutritionists, 55 assistants, 710 nurses, 63 pharmacists, and 99 doctors of other specialties. 2 new hospitals are founded in 2014. Bogor has been a thriving city and it reflects on the increasing number of hospitals available. As of 2024, there are 25 hospitals available in Bogor alone.

<text>Villawood Immigration Detention Centre, originally Villawood Migrant Hostel or Villawood Migrant Centre, split into a separate section named Westbridge Migrant Hostel from 1968 to 1984, is an Australian immigration detention facility located in the suburb of Villawood in Sydney, Australia.

Built in 1949 to accommodate post-war refugees from Europe, a section of the original camp was converted into an immigration detention centre in 1976.

==History==

=== Villawood Migrant Hostel ===
The site of the detention centre was previously known as the Villawood Migrant Hostel or Villawood Migrant Centre, built in 1949 to house migrants from post-war Europe to work in local industries. The centre was run by Commonwealth Hostels Ltd, a non-profit company. By 1964 the centre housed 1,425 people, mainly from Britain and Europe. By 1969 it was the largest migrant hostel in Australia, and was at that time housing migrants from Britain, The Netherlands, Denmark, West Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Turkey. In 1968 the centre was divided into two sections, one named the Villawood Migrant Hostel and the other named the Westbridge Migrant Hostel, which operated until 1984.

=== Conversion to a detention centre ===
In 1976 a small section of the hostel was converted to provide security accommodation for persons awaiting deportation. This new section was named the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre.

In 2001 the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre was the subject of controversy when 40 asylum seekers escaped. A month later, a &quot;Four Corners&quot; documentary, &quot;The Inside Story&quot;, revealed the plight of six-year-old Iranian refugee Shayan Bedraie, who had been refusing to speak or eat. Shayan and his family had been detained at Woomera IRPC for 11 months and Villawood IDC for at least 6 months, and had witnessed a number of riots and self-harm incidents. He was periodically taken to hospital to be drip-fed and rehydrated, and then returned to detention.

Management of the centre was outsourced to private company G4S Australia from 2003 to 2009.

In January 2008, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) said the high-security section of Villawood Detention Centre was the &quot;most prison like&quot; of all Australia&#x27;s immigration detention centres, and demanded it be closed immediately. The HREOC described the infrastructure as dilapidated, and conditions inside the detention centre as &quot;harsh and inhospitable&quot;.
Early in the morning of Thursday 21 April 2011, the centre was set alight by detainees.

In 2020 the centre adopted various measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, but human rights organisations including HREOC have called upon the Australian Government to allow detainees to release detainees into the community to better protect themselves against COVID-19, as social distancing is not possible in the centre.

In November 2023, a Serco employee was criminally charged during a corruption investigation into drug trafficking. An investigation into conditions in Australia’s privately run centres found detainees are openly growing marijuana plants in their rooms at Sydney’s Villawood detention centre, as Australian Border Force conceded drug and alcohol use have led to violent and dangerous conditions.

=== Deaths at the Detention Centre ===

* In July 2001, Avion Gumede, a thirty-year-old South African male, committed suicide hours after being detained in Villawood.
* In September 2001, Puangthong Simaplee, a twenty-seven-year-old Thai national, was found deceased at the centre. She had been sold to traffickers when she was 12, smuggled to Australia on a false passport, and forced to work in a brothel.  At the time of her arrest she was a heroin addict.  On entering immigration detention she went into withdrawal, received inadequate medical treatment, and died three days later. In 2010 the Australian government made an ex-gratia payment to Simaplee&#x27;s parents, accepting vicarious liability for her treatment whilst in migration detention.
* In February 2002, Thi Hang Le, a Vietnamese national, committed suicide by jumping from the balcony from which she had twice previously attempted suicide. She had been discharged from a psychiatric unit days before, and had not taken her medication.
* In August 2004, Marc Lao Thao, a French man in his seventies who had been held at Villawood detention centre, died of a brain hemorrhage. A visitor to the detention centre told the Inquiry into his death that: &quot;When I saw Marc he had just been operated on for a hernia and was back from hospital. The younger detainees worried about him because he was vomiting every night. Marc was taken to the hospital only when he collapsed. I went to see him in Liverpool Hospital. There were two guards to look after an unconscious sick man. He never regained consciousness and died the next day&quot;
* In January 2008, Pishevaraz Khodaverdi died of heart failure after collapsing on the steps of St George Private Hospital on his way to an appointment there two days earlier. Mr Khodzverdi had been held in Villawood for the previous three months after being assessed as unfit to be deported.
* In January 2008, a sixty-two-year-old Iranian man known as Mr Fashovar, was found dead due to a heart condition.
* In September 2010, thirty-six year old Fijian national, Josefa Rauluni, committed suicide by jumping off a roof at Villawood Immigration Detention Centre, Sydney, hours before he was to be deported.
* In November 2010, forty-year-old Iraqi national, Ahmad al-Akabi, committed suicide. Mr Al Akabi&#x27;s bid for asylum had been rejected twice in the previous year. The room in which he has been kept was described as &quot;purpose-built for the purpose of death&quot; by the Department of Immigration&#x27;s own safety advisory head.
* In December 2010, David Saunders, a twenty-nine-year-old British national, committed suicide.
* In September 2011, a Sri Lankan man known as &#x27;Shooty&#x27;, committed suicide at the centre. He had been had been in detention for just over two years and had been accepted as a refugee about seven months ago, but was waiting for a security assessment.
* In February 2012, Ali Rahimi, a forty-four-year-old Iranian national, died in hospital of heart attack, possibly caused by anxiety suffered after time in detention at Villawood and repeated rejection of asylum claim. Refugee activist Ian Rintoul said the man was Iranian and had fled his home country in 2010 after being arrested and jailed for participating in pro-democracy protests. He arrived in Australia by plane in April 2010 and had been in detention since then. Mr Rintoul said the man had a wife and two children in Iran and a cousin in Australia.
* In June 2013, Ali Ahmad Jafari, a 26-year-old Afghan man, died of a heart attack. His mother took him and his siblings to Quetta in Pakistan when he was 10 after his father was suspected to have been killed by the Taliban. He later sought asylum in the UK but was deported back to Afghanistan in 2009, apparently because his grounds for protection were deemed to be insufficient. Then he fled to Australia and arrived on Christmas Island in 2010, saying he had been beaten by the Taliban. His claim for asylum was rejected and he appealed the decision. He had spent most of the past three years in detention. According to refugee advocates, the Immigration Department allowed Mr Jafari to live in the community in February 2012. But seven months later he was detained again at Villawood.
* In April 2016, a 42-year-old man named Rob Peihopa, from New Zealand, died of a heart attack after he was involved in a fight. Mr Peihopa, who moved to Australia in 1989, served two years in prison for his involvement in a police chase but on the day of his release he was picked up by immigration officers after his visa was cancelled. At the time, Mr Peihopa had feared he would be deported back to New Zealand, leaving behind his three sons.
* In January 2019, Moses Kellie (&#x27;Musa&#x27;), a man in his 30s from Sierra Leone was found dead at the detention centre. He had entered Australia on a humanitarian visa. The police have stated his death does not appear suspicious.
* In March 2019, 25 year old, Iraqi male committed suicide in Villawood Detention Centre. His death is being investigated.
* In March 2019, Milad Aljaberi, a twenty-five-year-old Iraqi male, died of a suspected drug overdose of crystal methamphetamine while at Villawood.
* In December 2020, a twenty-nine-year-old Malaysian man known only as Muhammad, was found deceased at the centre. No further details have been made public.
* In March 2022, a male, a Kurd from Iran, committed suicide after being bullied by other detainees and the refusal of staff to transfer him out of the high-security compound.
* In May 2022, a woman from woman New Zealand with mental health difficulties was found deceased from suicide. She had allegedly been denied her request of medication by Serco detention officers.
* In 2023 another man detained at the centre died in what is believed to be a suicide. The man in his thirties, originally from Iraq, was found lifeless in his cell after living at the centre for five years.
* In June 2023, an African man died from a drug overdose at the center. He was a humanitarian refugee with a wife and family in Australia, but whose permanent visa had been cancelled because he had breached covid restrictions.

==Description==
Villawood Detention Centre is located at 15 Birmingham Avenue, Villawood.

It houses a mix of asylum seekers, people who have overstayed their visas and Section 501 detainees who have had their visas cancelled following criminal convictions and are awaiting deportation after serving prison sentences. At 31 May 2021 it held 485 people including 278 Section 501 visa cancellations, 74 asylum seekers who arrived by boat, and 133 detainees in other categories.

People refused entry into the country at international airports and seaports may also be detained there. The centre has been the focus of much controversy, with accusations of human rights abuses.

Since 2009 the centre has been managed by private prison company Serco. with the Australian Border Force, an agency of the Department of Home Affairs, responsible for the welfare of the detainees.

<doc id="1104315" wikidata="Q7226897" url="?curid=1104315" title="Polypyridine complex">
<text>Polypyridine complexes are coordination complexes containing polypyridine ligands, such as 2,2&#x27;-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline, or 2,2&#x27;;6&#x27;2&quot;-terpyridine.

Polypyridines are multidentate ligands that confer characteristic properties to the metal complexes that they form. Some complexes strongly absorb light via a process called metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT). The properties of these complexes can be tuned by changes in substituents. For example, electron donation, electron withdrawal, and π-conjugating groups, to the polypyridine moiety. The MLCT absorption band can be shifted, the emission wavelength can be changed, and the emission lifetime can be extended.

A well-known example of a polypyridine complex is the tris(bipyridine) derivative of ruthenium(II), [Ru(bpy)3]2+. This complex exhibits intense luminescence at room temperature in aqueous solution. Another example is a platinum-bipyridine-dithiolate complex, Pt(bpy)(bdt), in which bdt denotes a 1,2-benzenedithiolate anion. This complex also exhibits photoluminescence at room temperature, and its wavelength and lifetime can be tuned by substitution of either bipyridine or dithiolate moieties. Structural control is easier than for ruthenium complexes due to the square planar structure of the platinum complex.

Some other areas of investigation involves immobilizing these complexes on electrodes. Some polypyridyl complexes intercalate into DNA and show promise as drugs.

<doc id="1104317" wikidata="Q6490402" url="?curid=1104317" title="Larry Gossett">
<text>Lawrence Edward Gossett (born February 21, 1945) is an American politician and activist who served as a member of the nonpartisan King County Council, representing District 10 from 1994 to 2006 and District 2 from 2006 to 2020. Gossett served as chair of the council in 2007 and 2013.

==Early life and education==
Gossett was born in Seattle to two sharecroppers who had emigrated from Nigton, Texas, to the Central District. He graduated Franklin High School in 1963 and later graduated from the University of Washington. In 1966 and 1967, he was a VISTA volunteer in Harlem. He initially joined VISTA for the draft deferment; his time in Harlem politicized and radicalized him.

== Career ==
Returning to Seattle, he became a founder of the Black Student Union on the UW campus and helped to organize nearly a dozen high school and middle school Black Student Unions throughout Seattle. As a student activist, he was instrumental in bringing about the UW&#x27;s Educational Opportunity Program minority recruitment program. He also played a role in the discrimination of black track athletes from Oregon State University, resulting in their early departure from a track meet. He graduated from the UW in 1970, receiving the university&#x27;s first-ever degree in African American studies. Before he had even formally received his BA, he became the first supervisor of the Black Student Division in the university&#x27;s Office of Minority Affairs. The Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project describes him as having been, in the late 1960s, &quot;one of Seattle’s best known young black radicals.&quot;

A former member of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, he worked as a community organizer in Seattle. While still working for the University of Washington, he was involved in the occupation of a former Seattle public school that ultimately became El Centro de la Raza. His continued involvement in civil disobedience led to a request to &quot;cool it&quot;, from the head of the Office of Minority Affairs, Samuel E. Kelly. Eventually, he left his position at the university. After working on the successful 1977 mayoral campaign of Charles Royer, he served briefly in the Royer administration, but felt that was taking him too far from his work as an activist. From April 1979 to December 1993, he was the executive director of Seattle&#x27;s Central Area Motivation Program (&quot;CAMP&quot;). He eventually worked on Jesse Jackson&#x27;s presidential campaigns.

===Black Panthers===
Several sources state that Gossett was a member of the Black Panthers. By Gossett&#x27;s own account, he attended the founding meeting of Seattle&#x27;s Panther chapter, and also attended Panther leader Bobby Hutton&#x27;s 1968 funeral; he worked on several political actions with Panther Party members and has said positive things about their legacy. Gossett has admitted in recent years that he was a long time member of the Seattle chapter of the Black Panther Party.

=== King County Council ===
Gossett was elected to the Council in 1993. Gossett ran unopposed in 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015.

Gossett&#x27;s office in the King County Courthouse is in the same location that his prison cell was in 1968 when he was arrested for unlawful assembly during a sit-in at Franklin High School on March 29.

He was defeated by Girmay Zahilay in the 2019 election after serving six terms.

== Personal life ==
Gossett is Catholic, married, and has three children.

<doc id="1104318" wikidata="Q7431317" url="?curid=1104318" title="Schilling tendon procedure">
<text>The Schilling tendon procedure is a temporary surgical procedure developed by the former Boston Red Sox team physician William Morgan, MD, to stabilize the peroneus brevis tendon so that it is prevented from anterior displacement during ankle eversion. If the peroneal retinaculum is torn, the fibular retinacula are no longer stabilized. This allows the peroneus brevis tendon to move untethered over the lateral malleolus, creating pain. During pitching mechanics, the snapping of the tendon over the bone is painful and distracting to the pitcher.

The procedure involves the placement of three sutures through the skin anterior to the path of the peroneus brevis tendon and into the underlying deep connective tissue. These sutures provide a temporary barrier, preventing the tendon from moving anteriorly over the malleolus. This procedure was first tested on a cadaver to establish if the surgery would work or not. The procedure is performed with local anaesthetic, about 24 hours before the player begins to pitch. The stitches must be removed immediately following the cessation of play, and indications are that the stitches may tear during the course of a game.

The procedure is named for Major League Baseball pitcher Curt Schilling, who required the surgery to be able to pitch for the Boston Red Sox in Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series and Game 2 of the 2004 World Series.

<doc id="1104319" wikidata="Q6891167" url="?curid=1104319" title="Mohamed Elmasry">
<text>Mohamed Elmasry () (born December 24, 1943) is a Canadian engineering professor, imam, and Muslim community leader.

==Biography==
He was born in Cairo, Egypt and received his Bachelor of Science in 1965 from Cairo University. He continued his studies in Canada earning masters and doctorate degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Ottawa in 1970 and 1974. He has worked in the area of digital integrated microchip design for over four decades.

From 1965 to 1968, Elmasry worked for Cairo University and from 1972 to 1974 for Bell-Northern Research in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Since 1974, he has been with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Ontario where he is a founding Director of the VLSI (Microchip) Research Group.

As a spokesperson for Muslim causes through the Canadian Islamic Congress, he has been a regular contributor to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. His remarks, especially those concerning the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, have drawn significant attention in the Canadian media. He has accused some of his opponents of being anti-Islam.

Elmasry has authored and co-authored more than 500 research papers and 16 books on integrated circuit design and design automation, as well as having several patents to his credit. He has edited the following books for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers: &quot;Digital MOS Integrated Circuits&quot; (1981); &quot;Digital VLSI Systems&quot; (1985), &quot;Digital MOS Integrated Circuits II&quot; (1991) and &quot;Analysis and Design of BiCMOS Integrated Circuits&quot; (1993).

==Appearance on &quot;The Michael Coren Show&quot;==
Asked by Michael Coren in an interview on October 19, 2004 if &quot;...everyone in Israel, irrespective of gender, over the age of 18 is a valid [military] target?&quot;, CIC President Mohamed Elmasry responded, &quot;Yes, I would say.&quot;

Elmasry later apologized for his remarks, calling them his &quot;biggest mistake&quot; in 30 years of public life and offered his resignation, which was not accepted by the CIC&#x27;s board.

The Elmasry affair led to criticisms that the media focussed entirely on the comments of the CIC president while neglecting controversial comments made on the same program by a B&#x27;nai Brith official, Adam Aptowitzer, who stated that &quot;When Israel uses terror... to destroy a home and convince people... to be terrified of what the possible consequences are, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s an acceptable use to terrify somebody.&quot; The remarks only received attention several weeks after the broadcast, and after Elmasry&#x27;s apology and proffered resignation, when a press release by the Canadian Arab Federation highlighted them. Following the CAF press release, Aptowitzer retracted his comments and resigned his position with the B&#x27;nai Brith. &quot;Toronto Star&quot; city editor John Ferri told the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;&#x27;s ombud, Don Sellar, &quot;we all had egg on our faces...[i]t was embarrassing for every paper in the city not to get the whole story from the outset.&quot;

In a letter to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; following Sellar&#x27;s column, Elmasary complained about the affair:
Canadian news media - including the Star - launched a relentless and unfair attack against the Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC) and me while covering up for weeks the outrageous statements made on the same show by Adam Aptowitzer, then the Ontario chairman of the B&#x27;nai Brith Institute of International Affairs. While never referring to Aptowitzer&#x27;s statements, the media used news stories, editorials, op-ed pieces, columns, photos, front-page coverage, cartoons, and radio and television commentaries to paint a negative picture of CIC and myself which seriously distorts and falsifies the truth. It was widely reported, for example, that &quot;Elmasry said all Israelis over 18 were legitimate targets for suicide bombers.&quot; This is totally false.

The media never questioned the completeness or the accuracy of the radio show transcript that was given to them. Instead, they totally and completely relied on the heavily selective one provided to them, which was one-sided and referred only to my remarks, but not to those by Aptowitzer.

Elmasry also criticized Canadian Jewish groups over this incident. In an article entitled &quot;When Jews Target a Canadian Muslim&quot;, Elmasry accused the Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC) and Bnai Brith Canada of &quot;putting pressure on my university to fire me&quot; and that his words were &quot;mis-represented to the public exactly as the CJC wished&quot;. He also stated that &quot;a Toronto Jewish businessman had threatened to withdraw his financial support for a chair of Jewish studies.&quot;

He also criticized the 2004 bombings of hotels in Taba, Egypt on the grounds that some of the victims there were not Israelis. These remarks prompted harshly-worded responses from representatives of the Canadian Jewish Congress and several prominent Canadian Muslims. At first, Elmasry defended his remarks by insisting that he was merely sharing the standard Palestinian point of view. This led to further charges from his critics, who accused him of using the Palestinians as a scapegoat. In a letter to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, he denied having said what he was reported to have said.

==Relationship with Tarek Fatah==

Regarding the October 2004 controversy involving Elmasry, Tarek Fatah, a founder of the Muslim Canadian Congress, had stated that &quot;...to believe all Israelis are targets is the height of hypocrisy.&quot;

Fatah also stated that: &quot;In refusing to step aside, Elmasry and the CIC have demonstrated the authoritarian and dictatorial nature of their structure.[...] They purport to speak for Canada&#x27;s 600,000 Muslims, but are not accountable or answerable to them.[...] We demand he [Elmasry] not[...] masquerade as leader of the community.&quot;

Regarding Elmasry&#x27;s statements, Fatah wrote that &quot;Elmasry accused his Muslim opponents of being traitors to their faith—an allegation that is read as a charge of apostasy, with all its ugly consequences&quot; and that &quot;It is especially sad that Mohamed Elmasry and his allies have chosen the holy month of Ramadan to launch their broadside on progressive Muslims.&quot;

In June 2006, Elmasry, named four public figures – Tarek Fatah among them – of taking every opportunity to bad-mouth Islam. Specifically, Elmasry stated that Fatah is &quot;well known in Canada for smearing Islam and bashing Muslims&quot;. Fatah blasted Elmasry, stating that &quot;[t]his is a classic threat to label anyone as an apostate and then marginalize them,[...] And this is what Mr. Elmasry has done by listing me as the top anti-Islam Muslim.&quot; Fatah stated that he views the label from Elmasry as tantamount to a death sentence. However, some Islamic scholars disagreed with Fatah&#x27;s characterization of Elmasry&#x27;s comments. Leonard Librande, professor of religion at Carleton University, told &quot;CTV News&quot; that &quot;There&#x27;s nothing particularly Islamic in this... There are differences of opinion frequently in the community. It doesn&#x27;t mean somebody is going to kill you.&quot;

However, Fatah has argued that &quot;in the Muslim world[...] allegations of apostasy are used to silence critics and human rights workers&quot; and that &quot;Some interpretations of Sharia call for apostates to be killed. Such views have forced many Muslims to flee their countries of birth and take refuge in tolerant Western nations such as Canada. To now find ourselves harassed in Canada by some Muslims here is alarming and ironic.&quot;

==Opinions and public statements==

===War against terror===
Elmasry has asserted that the war against terror is actually being used to oppress Muslims as a whole saying that:

Right wing Canadian politicians and their parties consider the &quot;war against terror&quot; to mean the same as &quot;war against Muslims.&quot; 

On the Bush Administration&#x27;s intentions in the Middle East, in particular towards Iran, he has argued that:
Mr. Bush has started a new and ugly cold war and he clearly intends to transform it into a hot one, sooner rather than later; the media and political hype will translate into real aggression, bringing death, misery and destruction to yet another Middle East state. The evil character of human greed and power-lust is about to raise its ugly specter once again and subjugate a weaker nation that refuses to toe the American line.

Regarding a potential American attack on Iran, Elmasry has written that &quot;It is all part of a long-planned Bush and Co. agenda and that is why you won&#x27;t find a single good word in the American mainstream media about Iran—none, nil, zero.&quot; In addition, Elmasry added that &quot;the doctrine of colonization: looting other people&#x27;s wealth and enslaving them, while killing outright those who resist[...] seems to be the dominant doctrine in Washington today&quot; and that &quot;Americans are busy preparing to attack yet another country, spreading more looting, more death, more suffering, and more destruction next door in Iran.&quot;

Elmasry has stated his opposition to Osama bin Laden calling him &quot;a lunatic, a fanatic&quot; and accusing him and his lieutenants of &quot;endangering the well-being, even the lives of many Muslims who are living in the West&quot; and whose &quot;religious rhetoric will probably feed into anti-Islam sentiments that already existed before Sept. 11 and have been on the rise since Sept. 11&quot;. Of bin Laden and his associated, Elmasry says &quot;They have no religious authority.&quot;

===Hezbollah===
Elmasry has written that Hezbollah &quot;is actually a legitimate Lebanese Shi&#x27;a Islam political party organized around a variety of roles and functions, just as are many other political parties. And, not unlike some other parties, it developed a national military resistance wing, created solely in response to Israel&#x27;s occupation of Southern Lebanon.&quot;

During the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Canadian Islamic Congress and the Canadian Arab Federation urged the Canadian government to take Hezbollah and Hamas off its list of designated terrorist organizations. Elmasry wrote that the Canadian government should &quot;review its 2002 decision to place Hezbollah and Hamas on its list of banned alleged terrorist organizations&quot; because doing so &quot;is an unconscionable act of hypocrisy and a mockery of justice&quot; since Canada has not placed Israel on the same list. Elmasry also stated that the decision to place Hezbollah and Hamas on this list was &quot;dictated by special interest groups with agendas that are contrary to peace with justice&quot;.

===Islamophobia===
Elmasry has been outspoken in opposition to Islamophobia stating that &quot;Today&#x27;s Islamophobia and yesterday&#x27;s anti-Semitism are starkly similar&quot; and expressing fear that at the parallels between historic anti-Semitism in Europe and modern anti-Muslim sentiment in the West. &quot;Today, Canadian Muslims are collectively judged as guilty by association for every crime committed by Muslim individuals, organizations and states, no matter how obviously atypical, abnormal or extremist they are. They are labelled Islamists, fundamentalists, Jihadists, etc.&quot; wrote Elmasry in a letter to the &quot;National Post&quot; analogizing the current situation to the history of anti-Semitism where &quot;European Jews were found guilty-by-association of many crimes, from killing the Son of God to any professional misconduct, beginning with the local Jewish doctor&quot;. He argued that the modern world should draw lessons from the past and work to halt the spread of anti-Muslim sentiment lest it establish the same groundwork for anti-Muslim violence the way that centuries of anti-Semitism laid the groundwork for violence against Jews.

===Multiculturalism===
In 2002, Elmasry denounced an email from the Khalid Bin Al-Walid Mosque that urged followers not to wish anyone a &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; asserting that this was tantamount to congratulating someone for murder and adultery. &quot;It is a ridiculous statement and doesn&#x27;t follow Islamic teaching. Whoever says this is saying it out of ignorance of his or her own religion&quot;, said Elmasry to the &quot;National Post&quot; and argued that extending Christmas greetings was the polite and neighbourly thing to do. He also said that Islam allows followers to marry Christians or Jews and that his own family is multi-faith. &quot;My kids have uncles and aunts who are Christian and we wish them Happy Christmas and they also wish us Happy Eid.&quot;

Elmasry says he and the CIC support &quot;smart integration where Muslims can practise their religion but can also be involved in advancing the well-being of their home country, which is Canada&quot;.

===Sharia tribunals===
In 2005, the Canadian Islamic Congress supported recommendations by Marion Boyd that the government of Ontario permit sharia tribunals to which Muslims could voluntarily submit civil disputes and whose findings would then have legal weight under the &quot;Arbitration Act&quot;. The proposal was opposed by the Muslim Canadian Congress, the Canadian Council of Muslim Women, and non-Muslim women&#x27;s groups. The provincial government ended up rejecting the proposal and scrapping existing religious arbitration tribunals for Jews and Christians in the process.

Regarding the opposition of moderate Muslims to the introduction of Sharia tribunals in Canada, Elmasry wrote that Canadian Muslims should not &quot;make a cause of publicly deriding their religion, badmouthing the Prophet, ridiculing the Qur&#x27;an and mounting uninformed crusades to smear their Islamic Law, the Shariah&quot;.

The Muslim Canadian Congress demanded that the CIC apologize for &quot;false&quot; accusations that those who criticize sharia are &quot;smearing Islam, ridiculing the Koran [and] badmouthing Muhammad&quot;. The MCC stated that Elmasry accused the group of blasphemy, a crime that carries the death sentence in several Islamic countries. The MCC wrote,Some MCC members also expressed concern they will be arrested if they travel to certain Islamic countries.

Elmasry responded by stating that Islam has no punishment for denouncing the religion, its holy book, or Muhammad, and he dismissed as &quot;nonsense&quot; the notion that his words could be construed as a death sentence.

===Danish Muhammed cartoons===
Elmasry urged a moderate response to Danish cartoons of the Islamic prophet Muhammad published in 2005. Anger at the depictions resulted in violent rallies and attacks on Danish institutions in Europe and the Muslim world. Elmasry urged Canadian Muslims to have a &quot;controlled and calm&quot; response consisting of writing letters to the editor and the Danish government. He also urged Muslims to engage in outreach by inviting non-Muslims into their homes and have open houses in mosques. He discouraged attendance at demonstrations saying,

===Claim that Old Testament teaches violence===
Commenting in June 2006 on the decision of United Church, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to reissue a motion to divest in Israeli companies, Elmasry stated:
The move of the Toronto&#x27;s United Church is a moral one. But is it true to its Holy Book; the New Testament as much as Israel&#x27;s campaign of death, destruction and misery against the Palestinians under its occupation is true to its Holy Book; the Old Testament? [...] It seems that many political leaders in the Christian West are not living the teaching of their Holy Book while Israel is living its own. 

Elmasry supported this view by citing a 1953 book by French pacifist Jean Lasserre, &quot;La Guerre et L&#x27;Evangile&quot;. Drawing on Lasserre&#x27;s view that by and large, &quot;the Old Testament ignores that respect for human life, that unconditional love, that non-violence, which [is] the general climate of the New Testament.&quot;

Previously, he had stated that &quot;very few people would sanely suggest that the Torah [which is part of the Old Testament] sanctions violence. The reason of course is that these verses and others much like them are subject to various interpretation and contextual assumptions.&quot;

====Criticism====
An article in the &quot;Arab American News&quot; criticized Elmasry, stating that:

His next gaffe [the first being the October 2004 controversy] was the declaration that Israel&#x27;s cruelty could be explained by the fact that the Old Testament is full of justification of bloody deeds by the ancient Hebrews. The inescapable corollary is that all Jews are cruel. Of course, his remarks have several flaws. Even if, for the moment, we grant the characterization of the Old Testament, it does not follow that all who claim to follow it see it that way and act accordingly. Second, a more realistic evaluation of these scriptures would recognize that they contain the work of many authors with different views produced over many centuries, with later works often more sophisticated. Amos, who declares, &quot;Let justice flow down like the waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream,&quot; can hardly be characterized as bloodthirsty. Finally, Elmasry&#x27;s take on the Old Testament is un-Islamic. The Quran identifies some of the patriarchs in the Jewish scriptures as prophets, and it speaks respectfully of Jews and Christians as &quot;people of the book&quot;. 

Bnai Brith Canada sharply criticized Elmasry, stating in a press release that Elmasry&#x27;s &quot;thesis that the Old Testament is the root cause of all hatred and violence in the world&quot; is an &quot;attack on the core of Judaism&quot;.

===The Canadian Jewish community===
In an article written in June 2007, Elmasry criticised Canadian Jewish intellectuals for, in his opinion, moving to the right of the political spectrum. Elmasry wrote that &quot;social justice once had staunch friends among Canadian Jews&quot;, citing in particular David Lewis, but argued that today &quot;many Canadian Jewish intellectuals are assaulting Canada&#x27;s policies regarding multiculturalism, immigration, and what they consider federal &#x27;giving in&#x27; to natives&#x27; land claims. They are no longer speaking out against the deterioration of civil liberties in this country&quot; and that &quot;their political agenda has moved closer and closer to that of the far right.&quot;

In an article written in the &quot;National Post&quot;, Ezra Levant, the publisher of the now-defunct &quot;Western Standard&quot; accused Elmasry of hostility towards Jews. Levant cited the Canadian Association of Journalists meeting in Halifax in May 2005 in which he sat on a panel with Elmasry. During the meeting, Levant claims Elmasry engaged in &quot;a lengthy rant against the &#x27;zhoos&#x27; who control the media, the &#x27;zhoos&#x27; who are &#x27;on top&#x27; of the world and keep the Muslims on &#x27;the bottom&#x27;, and about how my own comments were suspect because I, too, was a &#x27;zhoo.&#x27;&quot;

In response to accusations of anti-Semitism, Elmasry has argued that his organization the CIC &quot;was the first non-Jewish Canadian NGO to denounce anti-Semitic incidents committed against several Montreal Jewish institutions&quot;.

===Israel and the Palestinians===
Elmasry has referred to Israel as &quot;Israel and apartheid&quot; and has praised Israeli activist Uri Davis because he has &quot;worked to expose the real truth behind Israel&#x27;s so-called &#x27;democracy&#x27;&quot;. Elmasry has also stated Uri Davis work makes it clear &quot;to any thinking person that Israel and apartheid and Apartheid South Africa are remarkably similar&quot;. Elmarsy has also called for Britain to apologize to the Palestinians for its role in the creation of Israel and for its use &quot;of military violence, political stratagems and economic influence to inflict generations of injustice, destruction, misery and death on a native people living in the path of their plans&quot;.

Elmasry has said &quot;The pro-Israel lobby continually strive to discredit anyone who dares to speak the truth about Israeli atrocities against native Palestinians.&quot;

He has also written that: &quot;[...]Zionism, as a political ideology, has succeeded only in building an apartheid state for Jews; an elaborate ghetto kept separate from its Palestinian neighbors by concentrated military power, an aesthetically monstrous &#x27;security wall,&#x27; economic dependency on Western support, compulsory military conscription and training (including how to kill with weapons), and a hate-based education system for Jewish children that teaches them to despise anyone and anything Palestinian, Arab, or Muslim, in that order.&quot;

Elmasry has recognized a diversity of opinion among Israelis, saying that &quot;Many Israelis—and the number steadily grows—now recognize that the occupation and the settlements are twin obstacles to peace.&quot;

Elmasry has called for a two-state solution with Israel withdrawing to its pre-1967 border and praised Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat for making peace with Israel in exchange to its withdrawal from the Sinai Desert. However, in April 2008, Elmasry wrote that &quot;Those Palestinians who oppose the one-state solution are those who believe the illusion (promoted by U.S. president George W. Bush, for example) that a two-state solution is just around the corner.&quot;

Elmasry has also stated that there is nothing wrong with the &quot;one-state&quot; solution. Elmasry suggested such as state &quot;could divide key positions of power among Jews and the Arabs. For example, Jews could be in charge of the army and Arabs look after the police. The positions of President, Prime Minister, and Speaker of the Parliament could be held in alternating terms by Arabs and Jews.&quot; However, Elmasry adds that &quot;the single state solution will never happen in the foreseeable future, of course, because the U.S. is pledged to maintain not only a secure Jewish state, but an expanding Jewish mini-empire carved out of its illegally occupied Palestinian territories.&quot;

In an article written in &quot;The Canadian Charger&quot; in June 2009, Elmasry wrote that &quot;Israelis are indoctrinated in Zionism&quot; and that &quot;violent militarism is not only a Zionist ideal but an economical and a sociological necessity.&quot; In a subsequent article, Elmasry wrote that &quot;in the West Zionist Jews create, encourage, support wars in Afghanistan and Iraq... [and] cheer for racist, anti-immigration politicians in Canada and Europe.&quot; He also described Zionist Jews as &quot;the enemies of freedom of speech in schools, universities and the public at large&quot; and alleged that the Western media gives &quot;Zionist oppressors a platform that allows them to exploit the Holocaust, and mount disinformation and misinformation campaigns&quot;.

===Joel Kovel===
In April 2008, Elmasry praised Joel Kovel for his book &quot;Overcoming Zionism – Creating a Single Democratic State in Israel/Palestine&quot;. Elmasry stated that, on the 60th anniversary of Israel&#x27;s creation, Kovel&#x27;s book &quot;is must-read for this difficult and bitter-sweet occasion&quot;. Elmasry also stated that &quot;hate that drives Zionist attitudes toward Palestinians&quot; and that Kovel &quot;suggests convincingly that the inner contradictions of Zionism led Israel to develop its &#x27;state-sponsored racism&#x27; and that Zionism and democracy are essentially incompatible.&quot; Elmasry concluded by stating that the reason Kovel&#x27;s book has been &quot;buried&quot; is that &quot;our so-called &#x27;free&#x27; press and broadcasting networks[...] are free only to those who own them and use their power to express their own views. And that is a sad loss for everyone.&quot;

===Homosexuality===
In 2004, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty encouraged Muslim parents to allow their children to attend public school classes that include teaching tolerance of gays and lesbians. Elmasry acknowledged that &quot;Teaching tolerance at a young age is a must ... but you have to balance that with the appearance that you are not promoting certain values, in this case homosexual families.&quot;

In February 2005, Elmasry wrote on the website IslamOnline.net that: &quot;I believe that the responsibilities of Canadian Muslims are to emphasize education in their own community and also other faith communities that homosexuality is against the natural law of the creator, and that it is harmful to the body, the mind and the soul of the person.&quot;

===Robert Mugabe===
In July 2008, writing in an op-ed for the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, Elmasry called Robert Mugabe &quot;clumsy&quot; but &quot;no worse than many leaders in the developing world&quot; and questioned: &quot;Why so did many Western media outlets, including Canadian ones, send their own correspondents to cover an election in a poor faraway African country of about 13-million black people? The answer is that Mugabe is hated by the British now as he was hated in 1980 when he was elected the first president of free Zimbabwe, after 90 years of British colonization under the name of Rhodesia.&quot; Elmasry praised Mugabe for &quot;trying to implement a land reform; to redistribute the land of about 5,000 white farmers to his country&#x27;s poor black people&quot; and argued that the collapse of Zimbabwe&#x27;s economy and the rampant inflation are the result of economic sanctions and not because of Mugabe&#x27;s land seizures. Elmasy criticized the Western media for not reporting that &quot;Mugabe was and still is popular especially in the rural areas; his land reform has won him support among his own people.&quot;

Father Raymond J. de Souza criticized Elmasry for this op-ed, writing that Mugabe is &quot;a man so isolated that even his fellow African dictators have distanced themselves from him&quot;. De Souza also wrote that &quot;If he [Elmasry] did not represent himself as Canada&#x27;s head professional Muslim, Mr. Elmasry&#x27;s celebration of Mr. Mugabe would have been too incredible to print.&quot;

===Omar Khadr===
In July 2008, Elmasry wrote that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is &quot;playing politics&quot; and remains indifferent to Omar Khadr&#x27;s incarceration at Guantanamo Bay prisoner because Harper had calculated that refusing to press Washington for Khadr&#x27;s return would score him &quot;political points&quot;. Elmasry further stated that &quot;This is where a leader comes in to say, &#x27;This is really wrong and I have to correct that wrong by bringing this person (back to Canada) even if I lose some political points with Islamophobes.&#x27; Mr. Harper is playing politics because of the backdrop of Islamophobia in this country... he has to rise above that.&quot;

Elmasry contrasted Khadr&#x27;s case with that of dual Canadian-British citizen William Sampson, who was freed from a death sentence in Saudi Arabia in 2003. Elmasry specifically wrote that:

Why is Stephen Harper so callously indifferent to Omar Khadr&#x27;s case? It&#x27;s painfully obvious: William Sampson is a white Westerner while his fellow Canadian citizen, Omar Khadr, is brown-skinned and a Muslim.
However, Elmasry later stated that he was attempting to explain Harper&#x27;s stance on the file and was not accusing the prime minister of prejudice against Muslims.

Kory Teneycke, Harper&#x27;s director of communications, responded that if &quot;there is a party playing politics with this case, it&#x27;s certainly not the Conservative party. The Liberal party is reversing a position that it held for a number of years while in government with respect to how the serious charges against Mr. Khadr should be dealt with. We are very late in that process now and it would be inappropriate to make a change.&quot; Teneycke did not comment specifically on Elmasry&#x27;s words.

===Environment===
In August 2008, Elmasry suggested Stéphane Dion and his Green Shift plan could sell to Canadians if he used a green surcharge as well. He also suggested that Canada follow the example of Europe rather than the US when it comes to the environment.

===Slavery in Islam===
In an article written in &quot;The Canadian Charger&quot; in August 2009, Elmasry wrote that:
Islam teaches that slaves, who were then the result of wars, Africans or not, should be treated well and set free as soon as possible...Islam also teaches that slaves can buy their freedom in-kind. Thus many of them excelled to be teachers and even scholars … Islam teaches a slave is a victim of circumstances who should be helped to be free and treated fairly in the mean time. Trading in slaves is a sin. This is in contrast to the teachings of the Bible, &quot;Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling.&quot;
Jonathan Kay, writing in the &quot;National Post&quot;, sharply criticized Elmasry. Describing Elmasry&#x27;s statements as an &quot;absurd elevation of Islam over Christianity&quot;, Kay noted that religious Christians led the abolition movement in the West in the 18th and 19th centuries, whereas slavery continued to exist in the Arab world into the 20th century and is still practiced in parts of Islamic Africa such as Sudan. Kay rhetorically asked &quot;what the Christian tribespeople from southern Sudan who have been abducted, forcibly converted to Islam, and enslaved by Arab Muslims in recent years would make of Elmasry&#x27;s historical fantasies&quot;.

<doc id="1104325" wikidata="Q984366" url="?curid=1104325" title="Eastwood, New South Wales">
<text>Eastwood is a suburb of Sydney, Australia. Eastwood is located 17 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government areas of the City of Ryde and the City of Parramatta. Eastwood is in the Northern Sydney region and is on the Sydney Trains Northern Line (Sydney). despite it being partially in the City of Parramatta. The area is best known for being an ethnic enclave for immigrant populations in Sydney, mainly of East Asian origin but the suburb also has a significant number of other immigrant populations, such as Italian and Anglo-Saxon people. Eastwood was originally its own town but due to the expansion of Sydney, was eventually absorbed.

Originally thought to have been inhabited by the Wallumedegal people, who lived in the area between the Lane Cove and Parramatta Rivers, the area was first settled by Europeans shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, from land grants to Royal Marines and New South Wales Corps, and was named &quot;Eastwood&quot; by an early Irish free settler, William Rutledge. Today it is a large suburban centre in the north of Sydney of over 19,000 people, with a large shopping area. Eastwood has a large population of established immigrants with over 60% arriving over 10 years ago and over half of the population born in Asia. Immigrants from China and South Korea have transformed the commercial precinct in the past decade.

Eastwood is famous for the Granny Smith apple, accidentally first grown in the suburb by Maria Ann Smith. Every October, the oval and cordoned-off streets become the grounds for the annual Granny Smith Festival, a celebration of the icon with fairground rides, market stalls, street theatres, parades, an apple-baking competition and a fireworks spectacular at the Upper Eastwood Oval. In recent years the festival has been influenced by the substantial Asian immigrant communities, with Chinese dragon dancers in the Grand Parade and Chinese stallholders. During the same period, Eastwood&#x27;s annual Chinese New Year Celebrations have broadened their appeal by incorporating concurrent Korean New Year traditions, and have accordingly been renamed the Lunar New Year Festivities.

==Geography==
Eastwood is located at the edge of the Hornsby Plateau with the suburbs of Dundas Valley and Denistone on its western and southern sides, respectively, as the land falls away down to the Cumberland Plain. To the north, Eastwood is bounded by the transport hub of Epping and to its east Marsfield which shares the same postcode of 2122. The suburb is predominantly residential with the main shopping area of Eastwood centred between Rowe Street and Rutledge Street around the railway line.

==History==

The Wallumedegal aboriginal tribe lived in the area between the Lane Cove River and Parramatta River, which was known as Walumetta. The area was originally heavily timbered.

The area was first settled by Europeans shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788 and is located in the Field of Mars Parish, and was part of the Field of Mars Common located in its northern area. The area of Eastwood was originally granted between the years of 1790 and 1803 to marines and the New South Wales Corps. John Love, a private was granted here in 1794, described as &quot;North Brush, in the Field of Mars Common&quot;. The land was then acquired by William Kent who already held land in what is now Epping. The land was purchased by William Rutledge for 288 pounds in 1835, who built &#x27;Eastwood House&#x27; in 1840. This house is now part of Marist College Eastwood. Scottish born John Ross, who was part of the &quot;squattocracy&quot;, owned Eastwood from 1860 until 1863. He reputedly paid £60 000 for it. In 1863 Edward Terry purchased the estate and upon his death in 1905, the estate was sub-divided.

In 1886, the Main Northern railway line from Strathfield to Hornsby was opened, with a station here originally called Dundas. This was changed a year later to Eastwood, named after the Eastwood Estate.

The commercial centre underwent a major upgrade in the early 1980s. Rowe Street, which originally ran across the railway line through a level crossing was turned into a mall between The Avenue and West Parade, and the 1940s bridge built in First Avenue for crossing traffic was replaced with a six-lane bridge. This bridge was to service the planned County of Cumberland Scheme, Eastwood County Road (linking Eastwood with Macquarie Park), a road project in the local area which has been controversial among locals.

==Commercial area==

The Eastwood commercial district is located around Eastwood railway station.

Eastwood Shopping Centre, built in 1976 on the former Odeon Theatre and is a 2-storey centre that once featured Target, Tandy Electronics, BBC Hardware and Woolworths. However, due to growth in nearby Macquarie Centre and Top Ryde City these stores have all closed, leaving Woolworths as the sole anchor tenant. 

Eastwood Village (formerly Westfield Eastwood) is a shopping centre located on Progress Avenue. Westfield Eastwood opened in 1964 and featured Mark Foy&#x27;s. The store became a McDowells store and then a Waltons 1972. In 1994, the Waltons store closed and the Westfield Group sold the centre and is now called Eastwood Village which included Franklins (rebranded to IGA in 2011–2015).

Eastwood Plaza is located on the pedestrianised section of Rowe Street. The Plaza features a fountain and several cafes with outdoor seating. Eastwood is becoming well known as an Asian shopping precinct, with speciality stores, supermarkets and many restaurants run by Chinese and Korean retailers. The ethnic background of its shoppers has created a hub of mainly Chinese, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Singaporean, Hong Kong and Korean restaurants and eateries in the area.

==Transport==

Eastwood is relatively well served by public transport. Eastwood railway station is located on the Main Northern railway line. The station opened in 1886, and it takes approximately 30–35 minutes to travel to Central.

Numerous Busways bus services also operate from the small interchange outside the station. These include the 545 route between Parramatta and Macquarie Park, the 544 route between Auburn and Macquarie University, and the 515 service to Ryde. Eastwood is also served well by roads, and is located close to the trunk routes of the A6 (Marsden Road), and Victoria Road.

In spite of the range of public transport options, the 2021 census found that only 7.8% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 34.2% by car (either as driver or as passenger).

==Landmarks==

*Brush Farm House on Marsden Road – former home of Gregory Blaxland, one of the explorers of the Blue Mountains. It is included on the NSW State Heritage Register and the National Trust of Australia register.

*Eastwood Public Park (EPP) Grandstand and Pavilion – these date from 1933 and 1935 respectively. The croquet pavilion is still in use for its original purpose, associated with the Eastwood Croquet Club, and available for hire by the local community. Both are Heritage listed.
*Ripley (14 Auld Avenue) was built in 1907, on the 1897 Bush Farm Estate subdivision. The house, designed by architect George W Durrell, is an example of the Federation Arts and Crafts style, rare in the Eastwood area. It is Heritage listed.

Eastwood once featured a lake which gave the names Lakeside Road and The Lakeside Road Uniting Church. This lake was later converted to an oval which is used for soccer matches and by local schools. The oval still occasionally floods after heavy rainfall.

==Forest reserves==
Darvall Park and Brush Farm Park are examples of remnant forest areas in the Eastwood district. Volunteers and professional bush regenerators have worked to preserve the Blue Gum High Forest and rainforest in these areas. The largest tree heath known in existence occurs at Brush Farm park. Other notable plants include native crabapple, jackwood and red olive berry. Despite being within a large city, Brush Farm has remarkable fauna, including the powerful owl, emerald dove, eastern whipbird, satin bowerbird and the green tree snake.

==Housing==

At the 2021 census, more than half (52.8%) of occupied private dwellings in Eastwood were separate houses, 28.2% were flats, units or apartments, and 17.9% were semi-detached or townhouses. Three-quarters (75.1%) were family households, 20.0% were single person households and 4.9% were group households. The average household size was 2.8 people.

Housing consists of many Californian Bungalow and Federation homes, especially in streets located closer to the station. More post World War II homes can be seen further from the station, especially to the north of Terry Road. While most of Eastwood is residential, with one or two-storey detached houses and villas, the area surrounding the town centre boasts buildings up to seven storeys high. In 2006 the City of Ryde developed a Control Plan for the Eastwood Town Centre, which includes the provision of buildings of up to ten storeys high in the shopping and railway areas. Former industrial parts of the suburb are also undergoing redevelopment. The former brickworks site was converted into a housing estate.

<text>The 1994 United States Senate elections were held November 8, 1994, with the 33 seats of Class 1 contested in regular elections. Special elections were also held to fill vacancies. The Republican Party took control of the Senate from the Democrats. Like for most other midterm elections, the opposition, this time being the Republicans, held the traditional advantage. The congressional Republicans campaigned against the early presidency of Bill Clinton, including his unsuccessful healthcare plan. Democrats held a 56–44 majority, after having lost a seat in Texas in a 1993 special election.

The Republicans successfully defended all of their seats and won 8 from the Democrats by defeating the incumbent Senators Harris Wofford (Pennsylvania) and Jim Sasser (Tennessee), in addition to picking 6 open seats up in Arizona, Maine, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. Notably, since Sasser&#x27;s defeat coincided with a Republican victory in the special election to replace Al Gore, Tennessee&#x27;s Senate delegation switched from entirely Democratic to entirely Republican in a single election. That would not happen again until 2021, when the Democrats flipped Georgia&#x27;s delegation in the state&#x27;s regularly-scheduled and special Senate elections.

The elections marked the first time Republicans controlled the Senate since January 1987 and coincided with the first change of control in the House of Representatives since January 1955 and a Republican net gain of 10 governorships. Furthermore, this was the first popular election in which Republicans won all Senate seats up in the Deep South. Collectively, the Republican gains are known as the Republican Revolution. Minority leader Robert J. Dole became Majority Leader, and on the Democratic side, Tom Daschle became Minority Leader after the retirement of the previous Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell. It was also the first time since 1980 that Republicans made net gains in the Senate but the last time until 2018 the Republicans also made gains among Class 1 senators.

Initially, the balance was 52–48 in favor of the Republicans, but after the power change, Democrats Richard Shelby and Ben Nighthorse Campbell switched parties and brought the balance to 54–46. Democrat Ron Wyden won a 1996 special election to replace Republican Bob Packwood, which left the balance at 53–47 before the next election cycle. , it is the last election cycle in which Republicans won Senate elections in Delaware, Michigan, and Washington. These are also the most recent elections from which none of the first-term senators elected remain serving in the Senate .

== Closest races ==
== Arizona ==


Three-term Democratic incumbent Dennis DeConcini retired after being a member of the Keating Five Scandal. Republican Congressman Jon Kyl defeated his Democratic opponent, fellow Congressman Sam Coppersmith by a comfortable margin.









== California ==


Dianne Feinstein won a special election in 1992 to fill the seat of Governor Pete Wilson. She faced wealthy Republican Congressman Michael Huffington in her race for a full term. Feinstein emerged victorious by less than two points.








After one term in the House representing Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, Huffington spent $8 million by the end of August and a total of $28 million during the entire campaign. He became wealthy off oil and gas. The race saw personal attacks on Huffington&#x27;s wife, Arianna Huffington, who was very involved in the race (the media dubbed her the &quot;Sir Edmund Hillary of social climbing,&quot; according to &quot;The Almanac of American Politics&quot;).

Huffington was called a hypocrite for supporting Proposition 187 and then breaking the law for employing illegal aliens, a story which came out in the race&#x27;s final days. $44 million was spent in the election. At the time, it was the most expensive campaign in a non-presidential election in American history. Chris Cillizza of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; named the election one of the nastiest senate elections in modern history.

On election day it was a very close race, but Feinstein won Los Angeles County, which may have pulled her ahead. Her sizable win in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area may also be credited to her slim statewide victory.






== Connecticut ==


Freshman Democratic incumbent Joseph Lieberman easily won re-election over Republican physician Jerry Labriola.




== Delaware ==


Veteran Republican incumbent William Roth, seeking his fifth term, fended off a challenge from Charles Oberly, the state&#x27;s three-term Democratic attorney general, beating him by 13 points.




== Florida ==


Republican incumbent Connie Mack III won a second term by scoring an easy re-election over attorney Hugh Rodham, brother of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.






Rodham left the public defenders office to run for the United States Senate in Florida in 1994. He won the Democratic Party nomination by defeating Mike Wiley in a runoff election, after earlier finishing first in a four-person primary field with 34 percent. After the first primary, the third-place finisher, Miami lawyer Ellis Rubin joined forces with Rodham as a &quot;senior executive consultant&quot; and hatchet man. In the presence of Rodham at a press conference, Rubin levelled the accusation that Wiley was hiding his Jewish faith by changing his name from his birth name, Michael Schreibman, and that Wiley &quot;changed his name before the campaign to deceive voters about his Jewish religion.&quot; Wiley accordingly refused to endorse Rodham after the runoff. Rodham then lost by a 70%–30% margin to incumbent senator Republican Connie Mack III in the general election. Although Bill and Hillary Clinton both campaigned for him, his organization was unable to take advantage of their help, he had few funds, almost no television commercials, and little support from the Florida Democratic party establishment in a year that saw Republican gains everywhere. After the election, Rubin switched allegiance again and charged Rodham with election law violations in the first primary; the Federal Election Commission eventually dismissed the allegations.



== Hawaii ==


Democratic incumbent Daniel Akaka was first appointed to this seat April 1990 after the death of senator Spark Matsunaga. He won his first full term by defeating Republican cattle rancher Mary Hustace in a landslide.




== Indiana ==


Three-term Republican incumbent Richard Lugar scored an overwhelming 37-point win against former Democratic Rep. Jim Jontz, who was attempting a comeback after losing re-election in 1992.




Lugar won 91 of Indiana&#x27;s 92 counties, Jontz won only the Democratic stronghold of Lake County.

== Maine ==


One of the Republicans&#x27; biggest prizes was the seat of retiring Majority Leader George Mitchell. Longtime Congresswoman Olympia Snowe gained the seat in a landslide victory over Democratic Congressman Thomas Andrews, a stark contrast to retiring senator Mitchell&#x27;s landslide win six years prior.







== Maryland ==


Democratic incumbent Paul Sarbanes won a third term by soundly defeating Republican Bill Brock, a former U.S. senator from Tennessee (1971–77), RNC chairman (1977–81), U.S. Trade Representative (1981–85) and U.S. Secretary of Labor (1985–87).




== Massachusetts ==


Ted Kennedy usually coasted to re-election, but in this election he faced an unusually tough challenge from Republican businessman Mitt Romney. Though the final result was a 17-point Kennedy victory, it marked the first time since his initial election in 1962 that Kennedy received less than 60% of the vote.

Romney defeated his closest competitor, John Lakian, to win the Republican primary with over 80% of the vote. He campaigned as a political moderate and Washington outsider, and posed the greatest challenge ever made against Kennedy for the Senate seat since he first took office in 1962. Democratic congressmen across the country were struggling to maintain their seats, and Kennedy in particular was damaged by character concerns and an ongoing divorce controversy. The contest became very close.

Kennedy launched ads criticizing Romney&#x27;s tenure as the leader of the company known as Bain Capital, accusing him of treating workers unfairly and taking away jobs, while also criticizing what were widely considered to be Romney&#x27;s shifting political views. Romney also performed inadequately in the debates between the two candidates, and made a number of poorly received statements that reduced his standing in the polls.

In the closest Senate election of his career since after 1962, Kennedy won by a reasonably comfortable margin, despite a series of losses for Democrats around the country.

Romney was initially behind businessman John Lakian in the battle to win the Massachusetts Republican Party&#x27;s nomination for the U.S. Senate. However, after using his personal wealth to advertise heavily on television, he gained overwhelming support at the state party convention.

Romney then defeated Lakian easily in the September 1994 Republican Party primary with over 80 percent of the vote.



In the general election, Kennedy faced the first serious re-election challenger of his career in the younger, telegenic, and very well-funded Romney. Romney ran as a successful entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues.
After two decades out of public view, his father George re-emerged during the campaign. George Romney had urged Mitt to enter the race and moved into his son&#x27;s house for its duration, serving as an unofficial advisor.

Kennedy was more vulnerable than usual in 1994, in part because of the unpopularity of the Democratic Congress as a whole and also because this was Kennedy&#x27;s first election since the William Kennedy Smith trial in Florida, in which Kennedy had taken some public relations hits regarding his character. Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of the Chappaquiddick incident and his first wife Joan Bennett Kennedy seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement.

Some early polls showed Romney close to Kennedy. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. One &quot;Boston Herald&quot;/WCVB-TV poll taken after the September 20, 1994 primary showed Romney ahead 44 percent to 42 percent, within the poll&#x27;s sampling margin of error. In another September poll, Romney had a 43 to 42 percent lead. President Bill Clinton traveled to Massachusetts to campaign for Kennedy.

Religion became an issue for a while, after Kennedy&#x27;s campaign said it was fair to ask Romney about his LDS Church&#x27;s past policy of not allowing blacks into the priesthood. Romney accused Kennedy of having violated senator John F. Kennedy&#x27;s famous September 1960 pledge not to allow his own Catholic doctrine to inform policy, made during his ultimately victorious presidential campaign. George Romney forcefully interjected during his son&#x27;s press conference, &quot;I think it is absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issues. And what Ted is trying to do is bring it into the picture.&quot;

After Romney touted his business credentials and his record at creating jobs within his company, Kennedy ran campaign ads showing an Indiana company, Ampad, bought out by Romney&#x27;s firm, Bain Capital. They showed interviews with its union workers who had been fired and who criticized Romney for the loss of their jobs, with one saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t think Romney is creating jobs because he took every one of them away.&quot; Romney claimed that 10,000 jobs were created because of his work at Bain, but private detectives hired by Kennedy found a factory bought by Bain Capital that had suffered a 350-worker strike after Bain had cut worker pay and benefits. Kennedy&#x27;s charges were effective, as more voters decided that Romney was interested in profits more than people.

Kennedy&#x27;s attack ads also focused both on Romney&#x27;s shifting political views; although both Kennedy and Romney supported the abortion rights established under &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, Kennedy accused Romney of being &quot;multiple choice&quot; on the issue, rather than &quot;pro choice.&quot; Romney said his stance dated back to his mother, Lenore Romney, and her position during her 1970 U.S. Senate campaign: &quot;My mother and my family have been committed to the belief that we can believe as we want, but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter. And you will not see me wavering on that.&quot; Nevertheless, women&#x27;s groups and Democrats viewed Romney&#x27;s position with suspicion. (In subsequent years, Romney became anti-abortion and opposed &quot;Roe&quot;.)

Kennedy&#x27;s campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, he was forced to take out a second mortgage on his Virginia home.
Kennedy&#x27;s new wife Vicki Reggie Kennedy proved to be a strong asset in campaigning.

By early October, Kennedy was ahead by 49 to 44 percent in a poll by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. In their first televised debate, held at Faneuil Hall on October 25, Kennedy came out charging with his aging but still booming voice; regarding the Ampad deal, he said to Romney, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why you wouldn&#x27;t meet with the strikers with that flimflam deal of yours out there in Indiana.&quot; Romney charged that Kennedy had benefited from a real-estate deal that had been done on a no-bid basis, but Kennedy responded with a rehearsed line: &quot;Mr. Romney, the Kennedys are not in public service to make money. We have paid too high a price in our commitment to the public service of this country.&quot; Each candidate was asked to discuss one of their own failings. In a dramatic moment, Kennedy indirectly referred to his personal problems and acknowledged that he was &quot;painfully aware&quot; that on such occasions he had let his supporters down. By contrast, Romney mentioned work for several local charities he was engaged with on a near daily basis. When the moderator reminded him of the question, Romney responded &quot;I guess what I regret is that I&#x27;m not able to provide even more help for those less fortunate than myself... I wish I could do even more.&quot; Kennedy won this key debate as he reconnected with his traditional bases of support: two polls of voters conducted afterwards both showed Kennedy as the victor in the debate. One post-debate October general election poll showed Kennedy leading 50 percent to 32, and another by 56 to 36 percent. A second debate, held two days later at Holyoke Community College, focused more on policy details and lacked the intensity of the first one; Romney failed to gain any traction from it.

In the November general election, despite a very bad result for Democrats overall, Kennedy won re-election by a 58 percent to 41 percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career; only his initial victory in the 1962 Senate special election in Massachusetts was closer.




== Michigan ==


Democratic senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. retired after three terms. Former Michigan Republican Party Chairman Spencer Abraham defeated Democratic Congressman Milton Robert Carr in the race to succeed Riegle.

Riegle, a three-term incumbent, was considered one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats in the 1994 mid-term elections due to the unpopularity of President Bill Clinton and his being involved as a member of the Keating Five, a group of five senators who were accused of corruption. After months of speculation, Riegle announced he would not seek a 4th term in a speech on the Senate floor.





== Minnesota ==


Incumbent Republican David Durenberger decided to retire instead of seeking a third full term. Republican Rod Grams won the open seat. After surviving a messy Republican primary, former TV news anchor and one-term Rep. Rod Grams defeated his Democratic opponent, former state assembly minority leader Ann Wynia by five points for the seat being vacated by incumbent Republican Dave Durenberger.






== Mississippi ==


Republican incumbent Trent Lott won a second term by easily defeating former Democratic state senator Ken Harper.



== Missouri ==


Republican senator John Danforth retired after three terms. Former Republican Gov. John Ashcroft defeated his Democratic opponent, six-term Rep. Alan Wheat by more than twenty points.





== Montana ==


Democrat Jack Mudd, former dean of the University of Montana law school, defeated former U.S. senator John Melcher in the Democratic primary and then went on to lose to Republican incumbent Conrad Burns, who was seeking a second term.







== Nebraska ==


Democrat Bob Kerrey won re-election over Republican Jan Stoney, Vice President of Personnel at Northwestern Bell, by ten points.




== Nevada ==


Democratic incumbent Richard H. Bryan scored a ten-point win over Republican Hal Furman, a water policy advisor for the Interior Department.





== New Jersey ==


Two-term Democratic incumbent Frank Lautenberg narrowly defeated his Republican opponent, state assembly speaker Chuck Haytaian by three points.






== New Mexico ==


Two-term Democratic incumbent Jeff Bingaman defeated his Republican opponent, former George H. W. Bush Assistant Secretary of Defense Colin McMillan by eight points.








== New York ==


Veteran Democratic incumbent Daniel Patrick Moynihan easily defeated his Republican opponent, businesswoman Bernadette Castro.

1994 was significant for the Republican Revolution, mostly as a referendum against President Bill Clinton and his health care plan, and was seen as a tough year for Democratic incumbents. Moynihan, however, was New York State&#x27;s most popular politician at the time, and ran ahead of all other Democrats competing statewide.

Republican Castro was running for office for the first time and had trouble raising funds due to being seen as unlikely to win; at times during the race she trailed by up to 30 percentage points. She portrayed herself as a fiscally conservative, socially moderate Republican in the mold of Governor of New Jersey Christie Todd Whitman, and attempted to portray Moynihan as excessively liberal and prone to government spending. But Moynihan repeated his past strong performance among upstate voters, in addition to the usual Democratic strongholds in New York City.





== North Dakota ==


Incumbent Dem-NPL-er Kent Conrad won re-election to his first full term as senior senator, although technically his second third in the position, having served the end of Quentin Burdick&#x27;s term after his death. Conrad also had served an additional term as senator, but as junior senator from 1986 to 1992.



== Ohio ==


Senator Howard Metzenbaum retired and his son-in-law Joel Hyatt received the Democratic nomination to succeed him. Hyatt would go on to be badly defeated by Lieutenant Governor Mike DeWine.




== Oklahoma (special) ==


Incumbent Democrat David L. Boren decided to resign his position to accept the position as President of the University of Oklahoma, which prompted a special election. Republican Congressman Jim Inhofe defeated the Democratic Congressman Dave McCurdy.




== Pennsylvania ==


Democrat Harris Wofford was appointed to the Senate when three-term Republican H. John Heinz III died in a 1991 plane crash. He won a special election to hold that seat later that year. In his tough re-election against Republican Congressman Rick Santorum, the pro-choice Wofford lost the endorsement of anti-abortion Democratic Governor Robert Casey. This contributed to his loss to Santorum by two percentage points.

Wofford&#x27;s campaign was hurt from the outset by his strong connection with President Bill Clinton&#x27;s failed healthcare reform proposals; Wofford had made working toward universal healthcare a crucial issue in his prior campaign and was one of the executive&#x27;s strongest allies on the issue. After this failure, however, the senator ran a relatively passive campaign. He instead attempted to focus attention on his challenger, an arch-conservative who did not attempt to moderate his views after the primary election. The polarizing Santorum took strong positions against abortion, gay rights, and affirmative action, and he even clashed with some of the traditional fixtures of the state&#x27;s moderate Republican establishment. Early in the campaign and with little statewide name recognition, Santorum made a critical error by attacking Social Security, and Wofford appeared to be in relatively safe position. However, Santorum ran an effective grassroots campaign and specifically targeted many union Democrats who had reservations about the liberal social values advocated by many of their party&#x27;s leaders.

In the closing weeks of the campaign, Santorum was greatly helped by strong Republican enthusiasm because of anger over Clinton&#x27;s failed initiatives. He solidified his status by running a series of positive ads that attempted to define his character strengths and to contrast with Wofford&#x27;s negative commercials. Santorum eventually received a close victory by performing well (and nearly winning) his home in the suburban Pittsburgh region and through particularly low turnout in Democratic strongholds, such as Philadelphia, Scranton, and Pittsburgh cities.





== Rhode Island ==


Moderate Republican incumbent John Chafee, seeking a fourth term, defeated Democratic state representative Linda Kushner by 28-points.






== Tennessee ==

Due to the resignation of Al Gore in 1993 to become vice president, there were two senate elections in Tennessee as both seats were up for election.

=== Tennessee (regular) ===
One of the biggest upsets of the night was the defeat of three-term Democrat Jim Sasser. Sasser had been the influential Chairman of the Budget Committee and was among the leading candidates to replace Mitchell as Democratic Floor Leader. Sasser, however, would be defeated by prominent Nashville heart surgeon Bill Frist by 14 points.

There were two unforeseen events that affected the campaign. One was the large scale of discontent that the American people seemed to have toward the first two years of the Clinton administration, especially the proposal for a national healthcare system largely put together and advocated by Clinton&#x27;s wife, Hillary Clinton. The other was the somewhat unexpected nomination of Nashville heart transplant surgeon Bill Frist for the seat by the Republicans.

Frist, who had never voted until he was 36, was a political unknown and a total novice at campaigning, but was from one of Nashville&#x27;s most prominent and wealthiest medical families, which gave him some name recognition, as well as adequate enough resources to match the campaign war chest built up by the three-term incumbent, a challenge most &quot;insurgent&quot; candidates find to be impossible. A further factor working to Frist&#x27;s advantage was a simultaneous Republican campaign by actor and attorney Fred Thompson for the other Tennessee Senate seat, which was open due to Al Gore resigning to become Vice President of the United States. Another factor in Frist&#x27;s favor was that Sasser was never seen as possessing much charisma of his own. During the campaign Nashville radio stations were derisive towards Sasser to the point of stating that he could only win &quot;a Kermit The Frog lookalike contest.&quot; In one of the largest upsets in a night of political upsets in the November 1994 U.S. general elections, Frist defeated the incumbent Sasser by approximately 14 percentage points.





=== Tennessee (special) ===

Less surprising was the Republican victory in the other Tennessee Senate contest. Harlan Matthews had held the seat since Al Gore&#x27;s resignation to assume the Vice Presidency in 1993, but chose not to seek the Democratic nomination in the special election. The Republican actor and attorney Fred Thompson, defeated six-term Democratic Congressman Jim Cooper in an overwhelming landslide.







== Texas ==


Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison, having just won a special election the previous June for the seat vacated by Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, easily defeated Democrat Richard W. Fisher, an investment banker.




== Utah ==

Veteran Republican incumbent Orrin Hatch delivered a 40-point defeat to his Democratic opponent, attorney Patrick Shea.




== Vermont ==


Moderate Republican Jim Jeffords won a second term, defeating Democratic state senator Jan Backus and independent Gavin Mills. He won every county in the state.











== Virginia ==


Democrat Chuck Robb received over 70% of the vote when first elected in 1988, but struggled to win re-election. Furor over Robb&#x27;s alleged affair with model Tai Collins provided plenty of momentum for the Republican Iran-Contra figure Oliver North. A factor to Robb&#x27;s advantage was the independent candidacy of attorney J. Marshall Coleman. North likely lost votes to Coleman especially when Virginia&#x27;s other senator, Republican John Warner, endorsed Coleman over North. Robb received 46% of the vote to North&#x27;s 43% with Coleman garnering 11%.

Oliver North was a very controversial figure as he was involved in the Iran-Contra Affair, a scandal during Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidency. Marshall Coleman attempted to seize the middle ground between Robb and North. Republican senator John Warner of Virginia endorsed Marshall Coleman. On the eve of the election, former first lady Nancy Reagan told a reporter that North had lied to her husband when discussing Iran-Contra with the former president, effectively eviscerating him. North&#x27;s candidacy was documented in the 1996 film &quot;A Perfect Candidate&quot;.

In his failed bid to unseat Robb, North raised $20.3 million in a single year through nationwide direct mail solicitations, telemarketing, fundraising events, and contributions from major donors. About $16 million of that amount was from direct mail alone. This was the biggest accumulation of direct mail funds for a statewide campaign to that date, and it made North the top direct mail political fundraiser in the country in 1994.

Douglas Wilder, the first black Governor of Virginia, who served from 1990 to 1994, originally entered the Senate race as an independent before dropping out.




== Washington ==


Republican incumbent Slade Gorton, seeking his third non-consecutive term, defeated his Democratic opponent, King County Councilman Ron Sims.



== West Virginia ==


Democratic incumbent Robert Byrd, first elected in 1958, easily defeated his Republican opponent State Committee Finance Chairman Stanley L. Klos.

Klos campaigned as a &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot; against Robert C. Byrd participating in the Republican U.S. Senatorial Committee&#x27;s strategy to re-capture a majority in the United States Senate in 1994. Byrd spent $1,550,354 to Klos&#x27; $267,165. Additionally the Democratic Party invested over $1 million in that state&#x27;s campaign to the Republican Party&#x27;s $15,000. The GOP captured a majority in the U.S. Senate. The highlights of the campaign included the hiring of an actor to play Robert C. Byrd who toured in staged Statewide Debates when the incumbent refused Klos&#x27;s invitation for a series of formal senate debates. The campaign also organized successful demonstrations against the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Health Care Bus as it traveled through West Virginia in the summer of 1994. Senator Byrd, while the bill was being debated on the Senate floor rose suggesting the brakes be put on approving National Health Care measure while the bus was completing its tour in WV. To Klos&#x27;s credit, the campaign did not implement the &quot;Death by a Thousand Cuts&quot; plan proposed by strategists which was later acknowledged in speeches given and letters written by U.S. senator Byrd.



== Wisconsin ==


Democratic incumbent Herb Kohl had little trouble winning a second term over former Republican state assemblyman Robert Welch.




== Wyoming ==


Republican incumbent Malcolm Wallop retired after three terms. Republican Rep. Craig Thomas trounced Mike Sullivan, the state&#x27;s two-term Democratic governor by twenty points.

<doc id="1104338" wikidata="Q2250243" url="?curid=1104338" title="Brooke Ellison">
<text>Brooke Mackenzie Ellison (October 20, 1978 – February 4, 2024) was an American academic, disability advocate, and the first person with quadriplegia to graduate from Harvard University.

==Life and career==
Ellison was born in Rockville Centre, New York, on October 20, 1978, to Edward and Jean (née Derenze) Ellison. On September 4, 1990, at age 11, she was hit by a car while walking home from school, resulting in paralysis from the neck down. Although her injuries left her completely dependent on other people, she graduated from Ward Melville High School in 1996 with high honors, and was accepted to Harvard. She graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Harvard with a bachelor of science in cognitive neuroscience in 2000 and a master&#x27;s degree in public policy from Harvard&#x27;s Kennedy School of Government, making her the first quadriplegic to graduate from Harvard. In 2014, Rutgers University awarded Ellison an honorary doctorate in humane letters. She completed her Ph.D. in 2012 from Stony Brook University.

In 2002, Ellison&#x27;s memoir &quot;Miracles Happen: One Mother, One Daughter, One Journey&quot;, which she co-wrote with her mother following her graduation from Harvard, was published.

===&quot;The Brooke Ellison Story&quot;===
&quot;The Brooke Ellison Story&quot; premiered in 2004, based on Ellison&#x27;s 2002 memoir &quot;Miracles Happen: One Mother, One Daughter, One Journey&quot;. The television film was directed by Christopher Reeve, the star of &quot;Superman&quot;, who himself had quadriplegia. Ellison was portrayed by Vanessa Marano as a child and Lacey Chabert as a teenager. It is also notable for being Reeve&#x27;s final directing project. The film aired on the A&amp;E network on October 25, 2004.

===Candidacy for State Senate===
Ellison ran for New York State Senate as a Democrat in 2006 but was defeated by the Republican incumbent, John Flanagan. One of Ellison&#x27;s principal issues was her support for embryonic stem cell research. She served on the advisory board of the Genetics Policy Institute.

===Later life===
Ellison was a professor in the School of Health Technology and Management at Stony Brook University and a motivational speaker.

In November 2015, Ellison teamed up with director James Siegel to create the award-winning documentary &quot;Hope Deferred&quot;, which aims to educate the general public about embryonic stem cell research.

Ellison was an advocate for accessible technology. She served as Vice President of Tech Access for United Spinal Association beginning in January 2023 following her 2022 appointment to their board.

Two decades following the publication of &quot;Miracles Happen&quot;, Ellison wrote and published her second book, &quot;Look Both Ways&quot; in 2021.

Ellison died at Stony Brook University Hospital on February 4, 2024, at age 45, of complications from quadriplegia.

<doc id="1104340" wikidata="Q1588271" url="?curid=1104340" title="Little wattlebird">
<text>The little wattlebird (Anthochaera chrysoptera), also known as the brush wattlebird, is a passerine bird in the honeyeater family Meliphagidae. It is found in coastal and sub-coastal south-eastern Australia.

==Taxonomy==
The little wattlebird was formally described by ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name &quot;Merops chrysoptera&quot;. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Anthochaera&quot; that was introduced by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827. The generic name &quot;Anthochaera&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek &quot;anthos&quot; &#x27;flower, bloom&#x27; and &quot;khairō&quot; &#x27;enjoy&#x27;; the specific epithet &quot;chrysoptera&quot; derives from Ancient Greek &quot;khrysos&quot; &#x27;gold&#x27; and &quot;pteron&quot; &#x27;wing&#x27;.

The International Ornithologists&#x27; Union recognise three subspecies:
* &quot;A. c. chrysoptera&quot; (Latham, 1801) – eastern and southeastern Australia 
* &quot;A. c. halmaturina&quot; (Mathews, 1912) – Kangaroo Island (South Australia) 
* &quot;A. c. tasmanica&quot; (Mathews, 1912) – Tasmania

The western wattlebird (&quot;A. lunulata&quot;) was at one time considered as the subspecies &quot;A. c. lunulata&quot;.
==Description==
The little wattlebird is a medium to large honeyeater, but the smallest wattlebird. The appearance is similar to the yellow wattlebird and the red wattlebird. The little wattlebird lacks the wattles, which characterise other members of the genus. Juveniles are duller with less streaking and have a browner eye.

Calls include a strident &quot;cookay-cok&quot;, a raucous &quot;fetch the gun&quot;, a mellow guttural &quot;yekkop, yekkop&quot; and many squeaky, musical lilting notes. The alarm call is a &quot;kwock&quot; or &quot;shnairt!&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==

The little wattlebird is found in banksia/eucalypt woodlands, heathlands, tea-tree scrub, sandplain-heaths, lantana thickets, wild tobacco, parks and gardens.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
Breeding takes place from June to December. The female wattlebird generally constructs the nest, which is a loose, untidy cup of twigs, lined with shredded bark, and placed from 1 to 10 m high in the fork of a banksia, tea-tree or eucalypt sapling. 1-2 eggs are laid and may be spotted red-brown, purplish-red or salmon-pink in colour. The female incubates the eggs alone but both parents care for the young chicks.

===Feeding===
Little wattlebirds feed on nectar obtained with a long, brush-tipped tongue, adapted for probing deep into flowers. They also feed on insects, berries, and some seeds. Most feeding is done perched, but some insects are caught in mid-air. Birds may feed alone or in groups.

<doc id="1104346" wikidata="Q17511131" url="?curid=1104346" title="All of Mexico Movement">
<text>The All of Mexico Movement, or All Mexico Movement, was a political movement to expand the United States to incorporate all of Mexico. It was a controversial aspect of Manifest Destiny that was unable to garner enough political support to encourage adoption. The Mexican-American War (1846–1848) brought the United States and Mexico into conflict over various geopolitical issues, including a desire to invade and annex much of Mexico, that resulted in victory for the United States.

After the US Army took Mexico City, there was renewed enthusiasm for incorporating all of Mexico. There was fierce opposition to the idea within the U.S. Congress over various internal political disputes.
The US army found themselves in the midst of guerilla warfare in Tamaulipas, between Veracruz and Mexico City, making it impossible for America to take any effective control of Mexico, while simultaneously losing men, supplies and military equipment. While the American forces in Tamaulipas tried to subjugate the local population through violence and terror, in Mexico City and Veracruz, they tried to respect and not interfere with the local population. Both approaches failed, and it was only due to this increase in violence and insurrection that Mexican leaders saw the necessity of establishing a peace with the US. Similarly, it was urgent for the US to end the conflict and maximize territorial gains while minimizing unneeded losses.

==Background==

Before US President James K. Polk took office in 1845, the US Congress approved the annexation of Texas. After the annexation, Polk wished to affirm control of the region of Texas between the Nueces River, where Mexico claimed Texas&#x27;s southern border to be, and the Rio Grande, where Texas declared the border to be when they declared independence from Mexico in 1836. This conflict paved the way for the outbreak of the Mexican–American War on April 24, 1846.

US success on the battlefield by the summer of 1847 encouraged calls for the annexation of all of Mexico, particularly by eastern Democrats, who argued that bringing Mexico into the Union would be the best way to ensure peace in the region.

==Opposition==
The proposal to annex all of Mexico was controversial. Idealistic advocates of Manifest Destiny, such as John L. O&#x27;Sullivan, had always maintained that the laws of the United States should not be imposed onto people against their will. The annexation of all of Mexico would violate that principle and find controversy by extending US citizenship to millions of Mexicans.

That debate brought to the forefront one of the contradictions of Manifest Destiny. Identitarian ideas inherent in Manifest Destiny suggested that Mexicans, as people of color, would present a threat to white racial integrity and so were not qualified to become US citizens, but the &quot;mission&quot; component of Manifest Destiny suggested that Mexicans would be improved (or &quot;regenerated,&quot; as it was then described) by bringing them into American democracy. Identitarianism promoted Manifest Destiny but was also used to oppose Manifest Destiny.

An example of this identity-based and racist position was that of John C. Calhoun, Senator from South Carolina, former vice president and future spokesperson for southern secession, in which, in his own words in a speech to Congress on January 4, 1848, he explained that: &quot;[We] have never dreamt of incorporating into our Union any but the Caucasian race the free white race. To incorporate Mexico, would be the very first instance of the kind of incorporating an Indian race; for more than half of the Mexicans are Indians, and the other is composed chiefly of mixed tribes. I protest against such a union as that! Ours, sir, is the Government of a white race.&quot;

Supporters of total annexation of &quot;All Mexico&quot; regarded it as an anti-slavery measure. Many Americans were troubled by Mexico&#x27;s Catholicism, weak republicanism, and threat of an upsurge in nationalism.

==Final result==
The controversy was eventually ended by the Mexican Cession, which added the territories of Alta California and Nuevo México to the United States, both more sparsely populated than the rest of Mexico. Like the All of Oregon movement, the All of Mexico movement quickly abated.

The historian Frederick Merk, in &quot;Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation&quot; (1963), argued that the failure of the All of Oregon and All of Mexico movements indicates that expansion was not as popular as historians have traditionally portrayed it to have been. Merk wrote that belief in the beneficent mission of democracy was central to American history, but aggressive &quot;continentalism&quot; was an aberration supported by only a minority of Americans, mostly Democrats, but opposed by Whigs and some Democrats. Thus, Louisiana Democrats opposed the annexation of Mexico, while those in Mississippi supported it.

<text>Jonathan&#x27;s Space Report (JSR) is a newsletter about the Space Age hosted at Jonathan&#x27;s Space Page. It is written by Jonathan McDowell, a Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian astrophysicist. It is updated as McDowell&#x27;s schedule permits, but he tries to publish two issues each month. Originally, the website was hosted on a Harvard University account, but it was moved in late 2003 to a dedicated domain.

Started in 1989, the newsletter reports on recent space launches, International Space Station activities, spacecraft developments, and newly released space-related data. McDowell&#x27;s report occasionally corrects NASA&#x27;s official web sites, or provides additional data on classified launches that are not available elsewhere.

Associated projects on the JSR web site are:
* A catalog of all known geosynchronous satellites and their current positions
* A listing of satellite launch attempts
* A cross-reference between catalog number and international designation of artificial satellites
* A photo archive covering many launch attempts
* A catalog of all spacecraft reentries

McDowell has long campaigned for U.S. compliance with the UN Convention on Registration of Outer Space Objects (1975) and UN Resolution 1721B (1961).

<doc id="1104357" wikidata="Q1153753" url="?curid=1104357" title="Ecology Generation">
<text>Ecology Generation () is one of the four green parties in France, along with The Ecologists (), the Independent Ecological Movement (), and Cap Écologie. Founded in 1990 by Brice Lalonde, Environment Minister, upon the suggestion of President François Mitterrand, it describes itself as a club with cross-party alliances of green-minded politicians and public servants. It moved away from the &quot;presidential majority&quot; in 1992, when Brice Lalonde left the cabinet.

The party, in alliance with The Greens obtained about 14% of the vote in the 1992 French regional elections; but the 1993 legislative election was disappointing for the Green-GE alliance, as it failed to win any seats and won only 7% (other ecologist parties brought the score up to 11%), when polls had given them up to 16%.
Noël Mamère was the movement&#x27;s vice-president from 1992 to 1994, when he was excluded from the party and founded the Ecology-Solidarity Convergence, which later joined The Greens. Unlike many green parties, which are traditionally associated with the left-wing, Génération écologie presents itself as a centrist ecologist party. This is despite its early allegiance with the Socialist Party in the 1990s, and how for a time in the early 2000s it was nicknamed &#x27;The Blues,&#x27; after the traditional colour of conservatism, and was associated with the centre-right UMP under Jacques Chirac from 2002 to 2004.

Génération écologie has cooperated since the 2004 elections with several other movements that share its priorities. It has worked alongside various organisations, most prominently the Federalist Party, the Centre of Handicapped Democrats, and the Vanquish Unemployment Association.

France Gamerre replaced Brice Lalonde as leader and she aimed to run in the 2007 French presidential election. Like her predecessor, she failed to win the 500 endorsements. In the 2009 European Parliament election, the party ran as part of the Independent Ecological Movement which won 3.63% of the vote.

On 2 May 2018, former minister of Ecology Delphine Batho left the Socialist Party and joined Ecology Generation. She was elected as new party president on 10 September 2018.

<text>The Chicago and North Western was a Class I railroad in the Midwestern United States. It was also known as the &quot;North Western&quot;. The railroad operated more than of track at the turn of the 20th century, and over of track in seven states before retrenchment in the late 1970s. Until 1972, when the employees purchased the company, it was named the Chicago and North Western Railway (or Chicago and North Western Railway Company).

The C&amp;NW became one of the longest railroads in the United States as a result of mergers with other railroads, such as the Chicago Great Western Railway, Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway and others. By 1995, track sales and abandonment had reduced the total mileage to about 5,000. The majority of the abandoned and sold lines were lightly trafficked branches in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. Large line sales, such as those that resulted in the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad, further helped reduce the railroad to a mainline core with several regional feeders and branches. Union Pacific (UP) purchased the company in April 1995 and integrated it with its own operation.

==History==
===1859 to 1968===
The Chicago and North Western Railway was chartered on June 7, 1859, five days after it purchased the assets of the bankrupt Chicago, St. Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad. On February 15, 1865, it merged with the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, which had been chartered on January 16, 1836. Since the Galena &amp; Chicago Union started operating in December 1848, and the Fond du Lac railroad started in March 1855, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad is considered to be the origin of the North Western railroad system. 
Other lines acquired and added to the network included the Chicago, St. Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad in 1859, the Winona and St. Peter Railroad in 1867, the Chicago, Milwaukee and North Western Railway in 1883, the Sioux City and Pacific Railroad in 1880, the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad in 1884, and the Milwaukee, Lake Shore and Western Railway in 1893. They also held extensive property in Michigan, particularly its Upper Peninsula, to the point where they were one of the largest property owners in the state. By 1899, the company had rostered 1,380 locomotives, 1,176 passenger cars, and 49,484 freight cars.

The first repair facilities for rolling stock were located along the Chicago River near the center of Chicago, but these were abandoned for a more extensive, 240-acre plot of land to the west along West Kinzie Street. The facilities were expanded in 1900 and became known as the 40th Street Shops, which at that point included three roundhouses, extensive locomotive overhauling capabilities, and a complete set of passenger and freight car shops. These shops served the eastern section of the CNW system. Meanwhile, the western section was served by back shops in Clinton, Iowa and the northern section was served by facilities in Winona, Minnesota. In 1911 a new freight yard and shops were built 13 miles west of Chicago in Proviso Township, which featured a mammoth, 58-stall roundhouse (a twin of the one in Fulton, Illinois).

Changing traffic patterns and competition with automobiles and trucking disrupted the railroad&#x27;s profitability by mid-20th century. After nine years in bankruptcy, the CNW was reorganized in 1944. It had turned rapidly to diesel power, and established a huge diesel shop in Chicago. Its Proviso Freight Yard, located west of the city center in suburban Cook County, was constructed between 1926 and 1929 and remained the largest such in the world, with 224 miles of trackage and a capacity of more than 20,000 cars.

Potatoes from the west were one of the main crops carried by the CNW, and its potato sheds in Chicago were the nation&#x27;s largest. It also carried western sugar beets and huge amounts of corn and wheat. This road, like other lines depending strongly on transportation of crops, was adversely affected by government agricultural credit policies, which sealed a lot of products on the farms where they were produced. Although it stood sixteenth in operating revenue in 1938, it was eighth in passenger revenue among American railroads. It served Chicago commuters; its &quot;400&quot; streamliners provided intercity transportation, and it provided an eastern link to bring the Union Pacific&#x27;s passengers from Omaha, Nebraska and points west to Chicago.

The CNW had owned a majority of the stock of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway (Omaha Road) since 1882. On January 1, 1957, it leased the company, and merged it into the North Western in 1972. The Omaha Road&#x27;s main line extended from an interchange with the North Western at Elroy, Wisconsin, to the Twin Cities, south to Sioux City, Iowa, and then finally to Omaha, Nebraska.

The CNW acquired several important short railroads during its later years. It completed acquisition of the Litchfield and Madison Railway on January 1, 1958. The Litchfield and Madison railroad was a bridge road from East St. Louis to Litchfield, Illinois. On July 30, 1968, the North Western acquired two former interurbans — the Des Moines and Central Iowa Railway (DM&amp;CI), and the Fort Dodge, Des Moines and Southern Railway (FDDM&amp;S). The DM&amp;CI gave access to the Firestone plant in Des Moines, Iowa, and the FDDM&amp;S provided access to gypsum mills in Fort Dodge, Iowa.

On November 1, 1960, the CNW acquired the rail properties of the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway. In spite of its name, it ran only from Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Peoria, Illinois. This acquisition provided traffic and modern rolling stock, and eliminated competition.

===1968 to 1984===
On July 1, 1968, the Chicago Great Western Railway merged with the North Western. This railroad extended between Chicago and Oelwein, Iowa. From there lines went to the Twin Cities, Omaha, Nebraska, and Kansas City, Missouri. A connection from Hayfield, Minnesota, to Clarion, Iowa, provided a Twin Cities to Omaha main line. The Chicago Great Western duplicated the North Western&#x27;s routes from Chicago to the Twin Cities and Omaha, but went the long way. This merger provided access to Kansas City and further eliminated competition. After abandoning a plan to merge with the Milwaukee Road in 1970, Benjamin W. Heineman, who headed the CNW and parent Northwest Industries since 1956, arranged the sale of the railroad to its employees in 1972; they formed Northwest Industries to take over the CNW in 1968. The words &quot;Employee Owned&quot; were part of the company logo in the ensuing period. The railroad was renamed from Chicago and North Western Railway to Chicago and North Western Transportation Company. The railroad&#x27;s reporting marks (CNW) remained the same.
After the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (Rock Island) ceased operating on March 31, 1980, the North Western won a bidding war with the Soo Line Railroad to purchase the roughly &quot;Spine Line&quot; between the Twin Cities and Kansas City, Missouri, via Des Moines, Iowa. The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) approved North Western&#x27;s bid of $93 million on June 20, 1983. The line was well-engineered, but because of deferred maintenance on the part of the bankrupt Rock Island, it required a major rehabilitation in 1984. The company then began to abandon the Oelwein to Kansas City section of its former Chicago Great Western trackage, which duplicated Spine Line service.

===1985 to 1995===
In 1985, the CNW Corporation was formed to take over the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company; the employee-owned stock of the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company was transferred to the new CNW Corporation.

In 1988, the Blackstone Capital Partners formed the Chicago and North Western Acquisition Corporation to purchase the CNW Corporation; the CNW Corporation was acquired by Blackstone Capital Partners under the Chicago and North Western Acquisition Corporation subsidiary from the employee owned stock; Blackstone Capital Partners controls the CNW Corporation and the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company under the Chicago and North Western Acquisition Corporation subsidiary. Chicago and North Western Holdings Corporation (or &quot;CNW Holdings Corporation&quot; and &quot;Chicago and North Western Holdings Company&quot;) was formed and took control of the Chicago and North Western Acquisition Corporation, which controlled the CNW Corporation and which the CNW Corporation controlled the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company.

The Chicago and North Western corporate structure under the Blackstone ownership:
*Chicago and North Western Holdings Corporation
**Chicago and North Western Acquisition Corporation
***CNW Corporation
****Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (formerly Chicago and North Western Railway)
In 1993, several of the C&amp;NW&#x27;s routes became flooded by that year&#x27;s Great Flood, which also affected other railroads that operated in the Midwest. The first routes on the C&amp;NW to be flooded were the routes south of St. Paul, Minnesota. Ten miles of their line between North Freedom, Baraboo, and Devil&#x27;s Lake were also flooded, and it isolated the C&amp;NW&#x27;s quarry supply in Rock Springs (a vintage diesel switcher from the nearby Mid-Continent Railway Museum assisted the Rock Springs quarry, until the flood cleared). During July, the C&amp;NW&#x27;s dry mainline through Iowa also became flooded. Upon learning about the flooding, some C&amp;NW employees called into work during their time off, in order to help the railroad through the flood. By the time the flood ended, most of the C&amp;NW&#x27;s rail lines remained intact and were quickly reopened.

In February 1994, the Chicago and North Western Acquisition Corporation and the CNW Corporation merged into the Chicago and North Western Holdings Corporation, leaving only the Chicago and North Western Holdings Corporation and the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company. In May 1994, the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company reverted to its original name, &quot;Chicago and North Western Railway&quot; and the Chicago and North Western Holdings Corporation was renamed to the second &quot;Chicago and North Western Transportation Company&quot;.

The Chicago and North Western corporate structure:
*Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (formerly Chicago and North Western Holdings Corporation)
**Chicago and North Western Railway (formerly Chicago and North Western Transportation Company)

In April 1995, the Union Pacific Corporation acquired the former Chicago and North Western Holdings Corporation (the second Chicago and North Western Transportation Company) under subsidiary UP Rail, Union Pacific controls the former Chicago and North Western Holdings Corporation (now the second Chicago and North Western Transportation Company) and the Chicago and North Western Railway (formerly the first Chicago and North Western Transportation Company) under UP Rail subsidiary.

The Chicago and North Western corporate structure under Union Pacific ownership:
*UP Rail
**Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (formerly Chicago and North Western Holdings Corporation)
***Chicago and North Western Railway (formerly Chicago and North Western Transportation Company)

The Union Pacific Corporation merged UP Rail into Union Pacific and then merged the second Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Chicago and North Western Railway into the Union Pacific Railroad; the Chicago and North Western system became part of the Union Pacific Railroad system. A joint UP-CNW subsidiary, Western Railroad Properties, Inc., was also merged into the Union Pacific system in the acquisition.

===Post CNW===
Chicago and North Western locomotives continued to operate in their own paint schemes for several years after the acquisition (although some of them were gradually repainted into UP colors.) Many former CNW units have received &quot;patches&quot; with a new road number and reporting mark to match their new owner&#x27;s roster. Only 2 &quot;patched&quot; units remain on the Union Pacific, UP AC44CW 6706, and UP C44-9W 9771. Several others work under different owners. However, it is still possible to find untouched CNW units in service. CNW 8646 and 8701 were the last unpatched CNW locomotives on the UP roster which railfans referred to them as the &quot;CNW twins&quot;. In 2017 after years of surviving untouched they were repainted and renumbered to 9750 (ex 8646) and 9805 (ex 8701) respectively. 9750 is in storage as of 2020 while 9805 is active and was rebuilt by GE/Wabtec into a C44ACM. CNW 6847 and CNW 7009 are preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum in their original factory paint. CNW 1518, CNW 411, and CNW 414 (METX 308) are also at IRM, with 1518 and 411 having been restored in CNW paint. CNW 4153 works at a grain elevator in Fremont, NE, while several other GP7&#x27;s, GP9&#x27;s, and a few other CNW locomotives are owned by regional railroads, short lines, or industries. As of 2020, 9771 and 6706 have yet to be repainted.

Union Pacific continues to follow its new tradition of releasing &quot;Heritage&quot; EMD SD70ACe units to represent the paint schemes of companies absorbed by UP. After painting at the Wisconsin and Southern Railroad&#x27;s Horicon, WI shop, UP 1995, painted in a &quot;Heritage&quot; C&amp;NW paint scheme, was unveiled on July 15, 2006, at North Western Station in Chicago, IL. In 2020, Metra repainted METX 90, an EMD F59PHI, in a CNW heritage livery. The North Western Station was rechristened to the Ogilvie Transportation Center in 1997 to honor Richard B. Ogilvie, a former governor of Illinois and well as the creator of the Regional Transportation Authority. The station serves as UP&#x27;s Metra terminus for its three lines (Union Pacific West Line, Union Pacific Northwest Line, and Union Pacific North Line). However, many longtime Chicago residents still refer to the station as &quot;North Western Station,&quot; and many longtime employees still call it &quot;CPT,&quot; for &quot;Chicago Passenger Terminal.&quot;

==Passenger train service==

=== Commercial passenger and commuter service ===


The CNW&#x27;s most famous train, the &quot;Twin Cities 400&quot; from Chicago to Minneapolis/St. Paul, was introduced in 1935 to compete with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy&#x27;s &quot;Zephyr&quot;s and the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s &quot;Hiawatha&quot;s. This train was so named because it traveled the between the cities in 400 minutes. CNW was the first system to start a high-speed Chicago-Twin Cities schedule because it used refurbished rather than new equipment, but in 1939, modernized the &quot;400&quot; with new E3A diesel locomotive pairs and streamlined cars. Other named trains the CNW operated included the &quot;Ashland Limited&quot;, &quot;Duluth-Superior Limited&quot;, and the &quot;North Western Limited&quot;
CNW eventually renamed the first &quot;400&quot; to the &quot;Twin Cities 400&quot; as the CNW labeled almost all of its passenger trains with variations of the &quot;400&quot; moniker, including the &quot;Flambeau 400&quot;, &quot;Minnesota 400&quot;, &quot;Valley &quot;400&quot;&quot;, &quot;Shoreland &quot;400&quot;&quot;, &quot;Dakota 400&quot; and the &quot;Kate Shelley 400&quot;. CNW ceased running the &quot;Twin Cities 400&quot; in 1963, and all intercity passenger service on CNW ended with the formation of Amtrak in 1971.

Amtrak bought a dozen of C&amp;NW&#x27;s bilevel railcars and painted them with the Phase III paint used with Amtrak&#x27;s EMD F40PH locomotives. They are no longer in use.

In conjunction with Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, the North Western operated some long distance passenger trains, including the &quot;Overland Limited&quot;, &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;, &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;City of Denver&quot;, and the &quot;Challenger&quot;. These services lasted from 1889 to 1955, after which the CNW route to Chicago was changed to the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s due to poor track conditions.

Chicago and North Western also operated commuter train service in the Chicago area, where they developed what was perhaps the first control car. A modified gallery car was built in 1960 with locomotive controls to allow push-pull operation. which is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum. The C&amp;NW also pioneered the concept of Head End Power (HEP), generating 480 volt electricity from the locomotive to power the air conditioning, lighting, and heating on the new bi-level cars. This eventually became the standard for all railroads in the United States.

Three commuter lines radiated from North Western Station; the C&amp;NW West Line to Geneva, Illinois; the C&amp;NW Northwest Line to Harvard, Illinois; and the C&amp;NW North Line to Kenosha, Wisconsin. At Crystal Lake Junction, some trains branched off to Williams Bay, Wisconsin. The West Line also had branches to St. Charles, Aurora, Freeport, and Crystal Lake. A fourth commuter line operated on the KD Line between Kenosha and Harvard until 1939.

In 1974, responsibility for the commuter lines and equipment ownership transferred to the newly formed Regional Transportation Authority, whose rail division was later branded in 1984 as Metra. The C&amp;NW continued to run the lines under a &quot;purchase of service&quot; contract, in which the railroad maintained the right-of-way and operated trains on behalf of Metra.

All three C&amp;NW commuter lines live on in the Metra system, and are still operated by Union Pacific under a purchase of service contract, with the Geneva line having been extended west to Elburn. However, service on the branch to Williams Bay was gradually cut back over the years, also resulting in changes to the name of the branch. In 1965, service was abandoned between Williams Bay and Lake Geneva. In 1975, service ended between Lake Geneva and Richmond. In 1981, service between McHenry and Richmond ended. Rails and ties north of the Cargill plant in Ringwood were removed during the 1980s, and the right of way converted to a trail. Service was discontinued to St. Charles in 1951. Service between Geneva and Aurora and Elgin and Crystal Lake was discontinued in the early 1930s. Service to Freeport ceased in the late 1940s. In 2023, Union Pacific decided to hand over the operation of Metra trains to the Metra system itself with the move taking place by mid-2024. UP, however, will continue to own and maintain the ex-C&amp;NW right of ways radiating from Chicago.

=== Short-lived steam program ===
By 1981, following the start of the early 1980s recession and the bankruptcy of the Milwaukee Road, public opinion on railroads around the Milwaukee area was beginning to sour. In response, management of the C&amp;NW explored options to generate public awareness that the C&amp;NW was still a healthy company. Manager of the railroad&#x27;s Wisconsin Division, Chris Burger, pitched the idea of the railroad hosting a steam excursion program, using steam locomotive No. 1385 from the Mid-Continent Railway Museum. Because of the recession, C&amp;NW President James R. Wolfe only approved a limited operation, instead of a full-blown program.

The steam tour took place in May 1982, dubbed the &quot;Prosperity Special&quot;, to promote the C&amp;NW&#x27;s locomotive and rolling stock upgrades. As a result of the &quot;Prosperity Special’&quot;s success, additional steam tours took place in the ensuing years throughout Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois. Some of the trains used C&amp;NW track rights to travel over Milwaukee Road and Burlington Northern trackage. The final steam tour took place in 1987, during the centennial of the City of Chicago. By which time, there was an insurance crisis within the railroad industry. The railroad&#x27;s management had also changed, and enthusiasm on the C&amp;NW to operate steam tours was lost.

==Additional notes==

===Operations===

The CNW was known for running on the left-hand side when running on double track mainlines. In the United States, most railroads used the right-hand track along double-track mainlines, while left-hand running was more common in countries where British companies built the railroads. According to a display in Metra&#x27;s station, the reason for this was a combination of chance and inertia. When originally built as single-line trackage, the C&amp;NW arbitrarily placed its stations on the left-hand side of the tracks (when headed inbound toward Chicago). Later, when a second track was added, it was placed on the side away from the stations so as not to force them to relocate. Since most passengers waiting at the stations were headed toward Chicago, the inbound track remained the one closest to the station platforms. The expense of reconfiguring signals and switches has prevented a conversion to right-hand operation ever since.

The Chicago and North Western was known for its installation of Western Railroad Supply Company wigwag signals at many of its crossing in the 1920–1940s. Almost every town on their route had at least the main crossing in town protected by them. The most common style were the Center Harp shorties. They were almost iconic to the CNW. Many of them, which were grandfathered in after the Federal Railroad Administration ruled them inadequate protection in 1949, survived until the 1970s and a few remain on lines in Wisconsin that have been sold off to other railroads. Lack of available parts and upgrades to roads have replaced all but a few of them.

The railroad operated what was once the largest &quot;potato yard&quot; or potato market, at its Chicago Wood Street yards. Potatoes came to the yard from every point in the United States to be bought or traded by produce dealers and brokers. While the facility came to be known as the &quot;potato yard&quot;, it was also a site where other vegetables could be bought, sold or traded.

===Logo===
In 1891, the CNW adopted the famous &quot;ball and bar&quot; logo, which survived a few modifications throughout its 104-year existence.
This included the changing of text:
* The North Western Line (1891–1902)
* Chicago &amp; North Western Line (1902–1944)
* Chicago &amp; North Western System (1944–1957)
* Chicago &amp; North Western Railway (1957–1971)
* North Western: Employee Owned (1971–1982)
* Chicago &amp; North Western System (1982–1995)

===Reused rolling stock===
The railroad also purchased a great deal of its equipment second-hand. CNW shop forces economized wherever possible, earning the railroad the nickname &quot;Cheap and Nothing Wasted.&quot; Sometimes employees referred to the condition of equipment as &quot;Cardboard and No Wheels.&quot;

===Rail trails===
One of the first rail trails created in the United States was the Elroy-Sparta State Trail in Wisconsin, which used a segment abandoned in 1965.

The 400 State Trail runs from Reedsburg to Elroy on the former main line.

The Cannonball Bike Path runs on a 5-mile stretch in Madison, Wisconsin on the old &quot;Ridgerunner line&quot;. It connects with the Military Ridge State Trail in Fitchburg at a roundabout with the Capital City State Trail, which is not a rail trail. The former Illinois Central line, now the Badger State Trail, runs on a bridge directly above the roundabout and has ramps connecting to the Capital City and Cannonball Paths. This area is known as the &quot;Velo Underround&quot;.

The Cowboy Trail is a rail trail that follows the abandoned CNW line between Chadron, Nebraska and Norfolk, Nebraska. When completed, it will be 321 miles in length.

The Glacial River Trail is a rail trail that follows the abandoned CNW line between Milton, Wisconsin and Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin.

The Military Ridge State Trail runs from Fitchburg to Dodgeville on the former &quot;Ridgerunner&quot; line. It connects with the Cannonball Bike Path in Fitchburg.

The Peace Trail runs between Janesville, Wisconsin and Beloit, Wisconsin next to the existing ex-Milwaukee Road line..

The Sangamon Valley Trail is another rail trail, currently 5.5-mile (8.9 km) in length, on the west side of Sangamon County in Illinois, which skirts Springfield, Illinois. It is a segment of a former St. Louis, Peoria and North Western Railway right-of-way (which was later folded into the CNW) that has been set aside for rail trail use. The entire right-of-way connects Girard, Illinois, on the south end, to Athens, Illinois, at the north end. The right-of-way spans the western half of Sangamon County in a north–south direction, and also traverses small sections of Macoupin County and Menard County.

The Three Eagles Trail runs for a couple miles south of Eagle River, Wisconsin.

The Wild Rivers Trail is a 104-mile-long rail trail that follows the abandoned CNW line between Rice Lake, Wisconsin and Superior, Wisconsin.

The Great Western Trail of 17 miles follows the abandoned Chicago Great Western Railroad from Forest Park to St. Charles.

The Glacial Drumlin State Trail of 52 miles follows the abandoned CNW line between Madison, Wisconsin and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

The Three Rivers Trail Trailhead is located 2 miles west of Eagle Grove, IA extending west 33 miles to Rolfe, IA. It is a crushed limestone trail that has been developed over the abandoned railroad right-of-way. The trail also features a number of rest areas in Thor, Dakota City, Bradgate, and Rutland. The trail crosses the Boone River west of Eagle Grove. It is a Deck Plate Girder and Trestle that is 280 Feet Total, 80 Foot Main Spans.

== Preserved rolling stock ==
There are many Chicago and North Western locomotives still in revenue service with other railroads, such as the Union Pacific Railroad. Some of the older locomotives have been donated to parks and museums for preservation, and a few continue to operate on scenic or tourist railroads. Most of the engines in use with Union Pacific have been repainted. A small few are still &quot;patched&quot;, where the C&amp;NW logos on the sides are replaced by a Union Pacific shield, and new numbers are applied over the old numbers with a Union Pacific sticker.

<text>Spuds MacKenzie (&quot;The Original Party Animal&quot;) is a fictional bull terrier dog character used for an extensive advertising campaign marketing Bud Light beer in the late 1980s. The Spuds MacKenzie mascot and campaign was the idea of a 23-year-old art director, Jon Moore. At the time, he was working at Needham, Harper, and Steers, a Chicago advertising agency. The dog first showed up in a Bud Light Super Bowl XXI ad in 1987. 

The dog was portrayed by a female bull terrier named Honey Tree Evil Eye, or Evie for short. Evie was from Woodstock, Illinois, and lived in North Riverside, Illinois, with her owner&#x27;s family, where she died in 1993. Anheuser-Busch sponsored many dogs from the kennel in Illinois where Evie was born.

The Spuds McKenzie ad campaign was not without its share of controversy. Shortly after Spuds&#x27; rise to fame, it was learned that the dog, portrayed as male in the ads, was actually female. Politicians and advocacy groups criticized the ads for promoting consumption of alcohol by children. Soon after the ads first aired in 1987, Senator Strom Thurmond began his own media campaign, claiming that the beer maker was using Spuds to appeal to children in order to get them interested in their product at an early age. By Christmas 1987, more legal action resulted from Bud Light&#x27;s use of ads featuring Spuds dressed as Santa. Advertisements for alcohol beverages cannot reference Santa Claus in states such as Ohio.

In 1989, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, along with Mothers Against Drunk Driving, alleged that Anheuser-Busch was pitching the dog to children. Although the Federal Trade Commission found no evidence to support that allegation, Anheuser-Busch decided to retire Spuds in 1989, claiming that the character&#x27;s image had started to overshadow the product.

In 2017, the character appeared in Bud Light&#x27;s Super Bowl LI advertisement as a ghost who helps a man named Brian reunite with his friends; the ad was an homage to Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. The house number in this advertisement&#x27;s last segment is 1989, the year Spuds was retired.

<text>Village Roadshow Pictures is an American film company founded in 1989 that co-finances and co-produces major Hollywood motion pictures. It&#x27;s a division of Village Roadshow Entertainment Group (VREG), which in turn is majority-owned by Vine Alternative Investments and Falcon Investment Advisors, with the Australian media company Village Roadshow currently holding a 20% minority stake. 

The company has produced films, including as co-productions with Warner Bros., &quot;The Matrix&quot; series, the &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; series, the &quot;Happy Feet&quot; series, the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s&quot; series, &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;, and &quot;Joker&quot;. The films in the Village Roadshow library have achieved 34 number-one U.S. box office openings and received 50 Academy Award nominations, 19 Oscars, and six Golden Globe Awards.

Village Roadshow Pictures self-distributes its filmed entertainment through affiliates in several territories around the world, including Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore (the latter through Golden Village). JPMorgan Chase and Rabobank also provide funding for the company’s film slate with Warner Bros. Village Roadshow Pictures had a second slate co-financing with agreement with Sony Pictures, which ended in 2016.

==History==
Village Roadshow Pictures was founded in 1989 by Greg Coote, who served as president, when it purchased certain assets of De Laurentiis Entertainment Group. The company’s first film was &quot;The Delinquents&quot; and its first hit was &quot;Fortress&quot; in 1992. In 1993, Village Roadshow Pictures expanded into television production with the launch of its first television series &quot;Paradise Beach&quot;.

In 1995, Village Roadshow Pictures launched a television division headed by Jeffrey Hayes. Also that year, the company started an international sales division called Village Roadshow Pictures International, which was led by Bobby Myers. In 1996, Village Roadshow Pictures Television and Yoram Gross formed a joint venture focused on animation. 

In April 1997, Village Roadshow Pictures and Intermedia formed a joint venture called Village Intermedia Pictures. The deal ended several months later when Village Roadshow Pictures and Intermedia decided to cut ties and became independent again. In September 1997, the company underwent restructuring with Michael Lake joined the company as managing director. In October 1997, Yoram Gross-Village Roadshow signed a co-production alliance with EM.TV &amp; Merchandising a Munich-based distribution and merchandising company to partner on 10 animated series over the next five years. 

In December 1997, Village Roadshow Pictures and Warner Bros. signed an agreement to co-finance and distribute at least 20 movies over the next five years. Under the deal, Village Roadshow would produce the films and Warner Bros. would market and release them worldwide, except in Australia and New Zealand. Bruce Berman, the former Warners’ theatrical production president, signed on as chairman and CEO of the company.

In 1998, Village Roadshow Pictures announced that it would sell its television division in a management buyout to Greg Coote and Jeffrey Hayes, who renamed Village Roadshow Pictures Television to Coote/Hayes Productions. Around the same time, the company announced it was shutting down the international sales unit. As part of its exit plan from the sales business, Roadshow sold international rights to its Western productions to Icon Entertainment International and the Australian films to Beyond Films Limited. Also that year, Village Roadshow Pictures sold off its 50% stake in the Yoram Gross animated studio venture to EM.TV &amp; Merchandising, which would become Yoram Gross-EM.TV.

In 2006, through a group led by Act III Communications, Norman Lear and his partner Hal Gaba purchased 50% of Village Roadshow Pictures (VRP). Their entity, Crescent Film Group, included long-time colleague Michael Lambert through Lambert Media Group and Clarity Partners as investors. Crescent invested $115 million for its interest in VRP. Village Roadshow Pictures used the $115 million invested by Crescent to repay an inter-company loan of $100 million owed to its parent company, as well as pay a $15 million dividend to the existing VRP shareholders and management.

In 2008, Concord Music Group merged into Village Roadshow Pictures to form Village Roadshow Entertainment Group (VREG). Investors in VREG included the shareholders of Crescent, as shown above, as well as Australia&#x27;s Village Roadshow Limited and Tailwind Capital.

In 2012, Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures extended their co-financing first look deal through 2017. In May 2014, VRPG established a supplementary co-financing production deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment which commenced with the release of &quot;The Equalizer&quot; and &quot;Annie&quot;. A second agreement was made due to the large amount of available capital. In 2013, Concord Music Group was sold to Wood Creek Capital, an affiliate of MassMutual, for approximately $120 million.

In 2015, VREG, the holding company of Village Roadshow Pictures and Village Roadshow Television, was recapitalized with a $480 million investment that included funds from Falcon Investment Advisors and Vine Alternative Investments. Vine Alternative Investments and Falcon Investment Advisors added additional capital in April 2017 to take a controlling stake in the company. This was to fund a new strategic plan for an expanded film slate and add production of television programs and other content offerings.

More recently, Phantom Four Films signed a first look deal with Village Roadshow Pictures. On September 27, 2021, Bruce Berman announced that he would step down as CEO of the company. On December 14, 2021, the company had signed a pact with Fox Entertainment to distribute pictures for Tubi and partnered with Kevin Garrett to launch Black Noir Cinema.

<text>Organic semiconductors are solids whose building blocks are pi-bonded molecules or polymers made up by carbon and hydrogen atoms and – at times – heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen. They exist in the form of molecular crystals or amorphous thin films. In general, they are electrical insulators, but become semiconducting when charges are injected from appropriate electrodes or are introduced by doping or photoexcitation.

==General properties==
In molecular crystals the energetic separation between the top of the valence band and the bottom conduction band, i.e. the band gap, is typically 2.5–4 eV, while in inorganic semiconductors the band gaps are typically 1–2 eV. This implies that molecular crystals are, in fact, insulators rather than semiconductors in the conventional sense. They become semiconducting only when charge carriers are either injected from the electrodes or generated by intentional or unintentional doping.

Charge carriers can also be generated in the course of optical excitation. It is important to realize, however, that the primary optical excitations are neutral excitons with a Coulomb-binding energy of typically 0.5–1.0 eV. The reason is that in organic semiconductors their dielectric constants are as low as 3–4. This impedes efficient photogeneration of charge carriers in neat systems in the bulk. Efficient photogeneration can only occur in binary systems due to charge transfer between donor and acceptor moieties. Otherwise neutral excitons decay radiatively to the ground state – thereby emitting photoluminescence – or non-radiatively. The optical absorption edge of organic semiconductors is typically 1.7–3 eV, equivalent to a spectral range from 700 to 400 nm (which corresponds to the visible spectrum).

==History==
===Early history===
In 1862, Henry Letheby obtained a partly conductive material by anodic oxidation of aniline in sulfuric acid. The material was probably polyaniline. In the 1950s, researchers discovered that polycyclic aromatic compounds formed semi-conducting charge-transfer complex salts with halogens. In particular, high conductivity of 0.12 S/cm was reported in perylene–iodine complex in 1954. This finding indicated that organic compounds could carry current.

The fact that organic semiconductors are, in principle, insulators but become semiconducting when charge carriers are injected from the electrode(s) was discovered by Kallmann and Pope. They found that a hole current can flow through an anthracene crystal contacted with a positively biased electrolyte containing iodine that can act as a hole injector. This work was stimulated by the earlier discovery by Akamatu et al. that aromatic hydrocarbons become conductive when blended with molecular iodine because a charge-transfer complex is formed. Since it was readily realized that the crucial parameter that controls injection is the work function of the electrode, it was straightforward to replace the electrolyte by a solid metallic or semiconducting contact with an appropriate work function. When both electrons and holes are injected from opposite contacts, they can recombine radiatively and emit light (electroluminescence). It was observed in organic crystals in 1965 by Sano et al.

In 1972, researchers found metallic conductivity in the charge-transfer complex TTF-TCNQ. Superconductivity in charge-transfer complexes was first reported in the Bechgaard salt (TMTSF)2PF6 in 1980.

In 1973 Dr. John McGinness produced the first device incorporating an organic semiconductor. This occurred roughly eight years before the next such device was created. The &quot;melanin (polyacetylenes) bistable switch&quot; currently is part of the chips collection of the Smithsonian Institution.

In 1977, Shirakawa &quot;et al.&quot; reported high conductivity in oxidized and iodine-doped polyacetylene. They received the 2000 Nobel prize in Chemistry for &quot;The discovery and development of conductive polymers&quot;. Similarly, highly conductive polypyrrole was rediscovered in 1979.

===Organic LEDs, solar cells and FETs===
Rigid-backbone organic semiconductors are now used as active elements in optoelectronic devices such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), organic solar cells, organic field-effect transistors (OFET), electrochemical transistors and recently in biosensing applications. Organic semiconductors have many advantages, such as easy fabrication, mechanical flexibility, and low cost.

The discovery by Kallman and Pope paved the way for applying organic solids as active elements in semiconducting electronic devices, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) that rely on the recombination of electrons and holes injected from &quot;ohmic&quot; electrodes, i.e. electrodes with unlimited supply of charge carriers. The next major step towards the technological exploitation of the phenomenon of electron and hole injection into a non-crystalline organic semiconductor was the work by Tang and Van Slyke. They showed that efficient electroluminescence can be generated in a vapor-deposited thin amorphous bilayer of an aromatic diamine (TAPC) and Alq3 sandwiched between an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) anode and an Mg:Ag cathode. Another milestone towards the development of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) was the recognition that also conjugated polymers can be used as active materials. The efficiency of OLEDs was greatly improved when realizing that phosphorescent states (triplet excitons) may be used for emission when doping an organic semiconductor matrix with a phosphorescent dye, such as complexes of iridium with strong spin–orbit coupling.

Work on conductivity of anthracene crystals contacted with an electrolyte showed that optically excited dye molecules adsorbed at the surface of the crystal inject charge carriers. The underlying phenomenon is called sensitized photoconductivity. It occurs when photo-exciting a dye molecule with appropriate oxidation/reduction potential adsorbed at the surface or incorporated in the bulk. This effect revolutionized electrophotography, which is the technological basis of today&#x27;s office copying machines. It is also the basis of organic solar cells (OSCs), in which the active element is an electron donor, and an electron acceptor material is combined in a bilayer or a bulk heterojunction.

Doping with strong electron donors or acceptors can render organic solids conductive even in the absence of light. Examples are doped polyacetylene and doped light-emitting diodes.

==Materials==
===Amorphous molecular films===
Amorphous molecular films are produced by evaporation or spin-coating. They have been investigated for device applications such as OLEDs, OFETs, and OSCs. Illustrative materials are tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminium, C60, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), pentacene, carbazoles, and phthalocyanine.

===Molecularly doped polymers===
Molecularly doped polymers are prepared by spreading a film of an electrically inert polymer, e.g. polycarbonate, doped with typically 30% of charge transporting molecules, on a base electrode. Typical materials are the triphenylenes. They have been investigated for use as photoreceptors in electrophotography. This requires films to have a thickness of several micrometers, which can be prepared using the doctor-blade technique.

===Molecular crystals===
In the early days of fundamental research into organic semiconductors the prototypical materials were free-standing single crystals of the acene family, e.g. anthracene and tetracene.
The advantage of employing molecular crystals instead of amorphous film is that their charge carrier mobilities are much larger. This is of particular advantage for OFET applications. Examples are thin films of crystalline rubrene prepared by hot wall epitaxy.

===Neat polymer films===
They are usually processed from solution employing variable deposition techniques including simple spin-coating, ink-jet deposition or industrial reel-to-reel coating which allows preparing thin films on a flexible substrate. The materials of choice are conjugated polymers such as poly-thiophene, poly-phenylenevinylene, and copolymers of alternating donor and acceptor units such as members of the poly(carbazole-dithiophene-benzothiadiazole (PCDTBT) family. For solar cell applications they can be blended with C60 or PCBM as electron acceptors.

===Aromatic short peptides self-assemblies===
Aromatic short peptides self-assemblies are a kind of promising candidate for bioinspired and durable nanoscale semiconductors. The highly ordered and directional intermolecular π-π interactions and hydrogen-bonding network allow the formation of quantum confined structures within the peptide self-assemblies, thus decreasing the band gaps of the superstructures into semiconductor regions. As a result of the diverse architectures and ease of modification of peptide self-assemblies, their semiconductivity can be readily tuned, doped, and functionalized. Therefore, this family of electroactive supramolecular materials may bridge the gap between the inorganic semiconductor world and biological systems.

==Characterization==
Organic semiconductors can be characterized by UV-photoemission spectroscopy. The equivalent technique for electron states is inverse photoemission.

To measure the mobility of charge carriers, the traditional technique is the so-called time of flight (TOF) method. This technique requires relatively thick samples; it is not applicable to thin films. Alternatively, one can extract the charge carrier mobility from the current in a field effect transistor as a function of both the source-drain and the gate voltage. Other ways to determine the charge carrier mobility involve measuring space charge limited current (SCLC) flow and &quot;carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV).

In order to characterize the morphology of semiconductor films, one can apply atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (GISAS).

==Charge transport==
In contrast to organic crystals investigated in the 1960-70s, organic semiconductors that are nowadays used as active media in optoelectronic devices are usually more or less disordered. Combined with the fact that the structural building blocks are held together by comparatively weak van der Waals forces this precludes charge transport in delocalized valence and conduction bands. Instead, charge carriers are localized at molecular entities, e.g. oligomers or segments of a conjugated polymer chain, and move by incoherent hopping among adjacent sites with statistically variable energies. Quite often the site energies feature a Gaussian distribution. Also the hopping distances can vary statistically (positional disorder).

A consequence of the energetic broadening of the density of states (DOS) distribution is that charge motion is both temperature and field dependent and the charge carrier mobility can be several orders of magnitude lower than in an equivalent crystalline system. This disorder effect on charge carrier motion is diminished in organic field-effect transistors because current flow is confined in a thin layer. Therefore, the tail states of the DOS distribution are already filled so that the activation energy for charge carrier hopping is diminished. For this reason the charge carrier mobility inferred from FET experiments is always higher than that determined from TOF experiments.

In organic semiconductors, charge carriers couple to vibrational modes and are referred to as polarons. Therefore, the activation energy for hopping motion contains an additional term due to structural site relaxation upon charging a molecular entity. It turns out, however, that usually the disorder contribution to the temperature dependence of the mobility dominates over the polaronic contribution.

== Mechanical Properties ==

=== Elastic Modulus ===
The elastic modulus can be measured through tensile testing, which captures the material&#x27;s stress-strain response. Additionally, the buckling method, employing buckling equations and measured wavelengths, can be used to determine the mechanical modulus of film materials. The elastic modulus significantly impacts the applications of organic semiconductors; lower moduli are preferable for wearable and flexible electronics to ensure flexibility, while higher moduli are required for devices needing greater resistance to mechanical stresses and enhanced structural integrity.

=== Yield Point ===
The yield point of organic semiconductors is the stress or strain level at which the material starts to deform permanently. After this point, the material loses its elasticity and undergoes permanent deformation. Yield strength is usually measured by conducting tensile testing. Understanding and regulating the yield point of organic semiconductors is essential to designing devices that can endure operational stress without permanent deformation. This helps maintain the device&#x27;s functionality and prolong its lifetime.

=== Viscoelasticity ===
As polymers, organic semiconductors exhibit viscoelasticity, meaning they exhibit both viscous and elastic characteristics during deformation. Viscoelasticity allows materials to return to their original shape after being deformed and to exhibit strain that varies over time. Viscoelasticity is typically measured using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Viscoelasticity is crucial for wearable devices, which are subjected to stretching and bending during use. The viscoelastic properties help the materials absorb energy during these processes, enhancing durability and ensuring long-term functionality under continuous physical stress.

<text>Democratic Action (, AD) is a Venezuelan social democratic and centre-left political party established in 1941. The party played an important role in the early years of Venezuelan democracy, leading the government during Venezuela&#x27;s first democratic period (1945–1948). A decade of dictatorship under Marcos Pérez Jiménez followed, which saw AD excluded from power. With the advent of democracy in 1958, four Presidents of Venezuela came from Acción Democrática from the 1950s to the 1990s during the two-party period with COPEI.

Since 2000, the party&#x27;s general secretary has been Henry Ramos Allup. In the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election, AD backed the opposition electoral alliance Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) which managed to grasp a supermajority. AD won 26 constituency representatives out of 167 seats in the unicameral National Assembly, making it the second-largest party in opposition to Nicolás Maduro. In July 2018, AD left the Democratic Unity Roundtable opposition coalition.

== History ==

=== Early years: 1931–1958 ===
The party had a chaotic early history. The &quot;Agrupación Revolucionaria de Izquierda&quot; (ARDI) was founded in 1931 in Colombia by Rómulo Betancourt and other exile Venezuelans. In 1936 this became the &quot;Movimiento de Organización Venezolana&quot; (ORVE), which was then dissolved into the &quot;Partido Democrático Nacional&quot; (PDN). Finally, in 1941, after Isaías Medina Angarita legalized all political parties in Venezuela, Acción Democrática was founded by Betancourt and others. These included Rómulo Gallegos, Andrés Eloy Blanco, Luis Beltrán Prieto, Juan Oropeza, Luis Lander, Raúl Ramos Jiménez, Medardo Medina Febres, Enrique H. Marín, Rafael Padrón, Fernando Peñalver, Luis Augusto Dubuc, César Hernández, José V. Hernández and Ricardo Montilla. Gallegos was a highly prestigious writer, author of the iconic novel, &quot;Doña Bárbara&quot; (1929), while Eloy Blanco was a celebrated Venezuelan poet and witty humorist.

After the October 1945 revolution, Betancourt was President of Venezuela until Rómulo Gallegos won the 1947 election, generally believed to be the first free and fair elections in Venezuelan history. The party won a vast majority of seats in the municipal elections the following year. Gallegos governed until being overthrown in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état. The 1945–48 period is known as the &quot;trienio&quot;. Many of AD&#x27;s founders and early members went into exile during the subsequent dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez, and returned for the restoration of democracy in 1958.

=== Political dominance: 1958–1999 ===
After the restoration of democracy, AD joined the 1958 Puntofijo Pact, initiating a forty-year period of two-party dominance by AD and COPEI. Betancourt won the 1958 election, and Raúl Leoni won the following 1963 elections. AD also won in 1973 (Carlos Andrés Pérez), 1983 (Jaime Lusinchi), and 1988 (Carlos Andrés Pérez again). From 1958 to 1999, AD&#x27;s candidates only lost four out of nine presidential elections (two to COPEI, in 1968 and 1978, two to third-party candidates in 1993 and 1998), and one of those occurred during a major split in AD.

====Splits====
The 1968 presidential election was shaped by the internal split of Democratic Action, with a substantial leftist faction breaking away to form the Movimiento Electoral del Pueblo (MEP). The split was the result of Luis Beltrán Prieto Figueroa&#x27;s victory in the 1967 AD primary election, only to see his nomination overturned by the party&#x27;s reformist social democrat faction (led by Betancourt) in favor of Gonzalo Barrios, with the Betancourt faction considering Prieto too far left.

Prieto Figueroa, at the time President of the Venezuelan Senate as well as President of AD, split from AD over the affair along with a substantial number of his supporters. The result was that the 1968 election marked AD&#x27;s first-ever electoral loss, when COPEI&#x27;s Rafael Caldera won the Presidency with less than 30% of the vote, just ahead of AD&#x27;s Barrios. Prieto Figueroa attained nearly 20%, attaining fourth place behind the Unión Republicana Democrática&#x27;s Miguel Ángel Burelli Rivas.

An earlier split, in 1960, saw the Revolutionary Left Movement break away from AD. Its subsequent engagement in armed struggle against the government meant the split posed less of a partisan problem compared the later MEP split.

=== Chávez/Maduro era: 1999–present ===

The Puntofijo Pact and AD-COPEI duopoly over Venezuelan politics collapsed in the early 1990s in the face of a severe economic and political crisis, culminating in the impeachment of AD member and President of Venezuela Carlos Andrés Pérez for corruption and the 1993 election of former COPEI leader Rafael Caldera on a National Convergence coalition platform. Caldera&#x27;s failure to resolve the economic crisis created the political environment for the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez. In the 2000 elections for the new National Assembly of Venezuela, AD won 29 out of 165 seats; four additional seats were won by an AD-COPEI alliance. At the 2005 legislative elections Democratic Action staged an electoral boycott and consequently did not win any seats.

During the 2010 and 2015 elections, AD was part of the Democratic Unity Roundtable. In the 2015 elections where the Roundtable won the National Assembly in a 109-seat majority, AD won 25 seats. The Roundtable parties boycotted the 2017 elections to the Constituent Assembly and participated in an unofficial referendum against its formation. In July 2018, AD left the Democratic Unity Roundtable, citing &quot;operative problems inside the organization&quot; and difficulties in electing the new secretary general of the coalition.

Acción Democrática&#x27;s Secretary General is Henry Ramos Allup. The trade union confederation CTV is closely linked to AD. AD is a member of the Socialist International, and a member of COPPPAL.

<doc id="1104375" wikidata="Q6141230" url="?curid=1104375" title="USS Sunfish (SS-281)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Sunfish&quot; (SS-281), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the ocean sunfish, &quot;Mola mola&quot;, a plectognath marine fish, having a deep body truncated behind, and high dorsal and anal fins.

==Construction and early career==
&quot;Sunfish&quot; was laid down on 25 September 1941 by the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, launched on 2 May 1942, sponsored by Mrs. J. W. Fowler, and commissioned on 15 July 1942, Commander Richard W. Peterson in command.

&quot;Sunfish&quot; held her shakedown in the San Diego Bay area and then proceeded to San Francisco, California, for post-shakedown repairs. On 26 October 1942, she stood out to sea en route to the Pacific war zone.

== First and second war patrols, November 1942 – April 1943 ==

She arrived at Pearl Harbor, T.H. on 1 November, and departed on her first war patrol on 23 November. Her assigned patrol area was off the coasts of Honshū and Hokkaidō, Japan. The submarine laid a minefield at the entrance to Iseno Imi on the night of 16 December. On 18 December, torpedoed and damaged the &quot;Kyowa Maru&quot;. The patrol ended on 14 January 1943, upon her return to Midway Island.

&quot;Sunfish&quot; began her second patrol on 4 February, which took her into the East China Sea. She torpedoed a ship on the night of 4 March, setting it alight.

Two days later, she fired at a transport with a four-torpedo spread, with three explosions heard. When the submarine raised her periscope, a destroyer passed over the conning tower and attacked with depth charges causing minor damage. On the night of 13 March, &quot;Sunfish&quot; torpedoed and sunk the 3,262-ton &quot;Kosei Maru&quot;, a cargo ship in the approaches to Takarajima (Toro Shima in DANFS) in . The submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 3 April.

== Third and fourth war patrols, May – September 1943 ==

Her third patrol was made from 4 May to 24 June in the shipping lanes near Truk Atoll. The &quot;Sunfish&quot; did not find any enemy shipping, so she reconnoitered Anguar Island on 23 May and shelled a refinery on Fais Island five days later.

From 28 July to 25 September, &quot;Sunfish&quot; patrolled in waters off Formosa. In two attacks on 13 August, she sank a tanker and attacked the converted gunboat &quot;Edo Maru&quot; which exploded, sending flames high. In the early-morning hours of 4 September, &quot;Sunfish&quot; dodged between lighted sampans to attack a 10-ship convoy, sinking the &quot;Kozon Maru&quot;, which also exploded.

== Fifth and sixth war patrols, October 1943 – March 1944 ==

&quot;Sunfish&quot; refitted at Pearl Harbor and sailed on 16 October to patrol area northeast of Formosa. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 December 1943 without finding any worthy targets.

On 14 January 1944, &quot;Sunfish&quot; set off under her new commanding officer Commander Edward E. Shelby to patrol the shipping lanes between the Caroline and Mariana Islands. She made a photographic reconnaissance of Kusaie and another atoll in the Carolines between 21 January and 30 January. On 23 February, the submarine made four attacks on a convoy, sinking the &quot;Kunishima Maru&quot; and the &quot;Shinyubari Maru&quot; with a combined tonnage of 9,437 tons of enemy shipping. When she returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 March, she was routed onward to San Francisco for an overhaul, which was completed in early June.

== Seventh and eighth war patrols, June – September 1944 ==

Following her overhaul, the &quot;Sunfish&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor and departed for her seventh war patrol on 22 June in the Kuril Islands area. She sank the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Shanmai Maru&quot; on the night of 5 July. The next day, the submarine engaged and destroyed a fleet of 14 sampans and trawlers with her deck guns. &quot;Sunfish&quot; mistakenly sank the Soviet merchant ship &quot;Ob&quot; on 6 July and sank the 6,284-ton cargo ship &quot;Taihei Maru&quot; on the morning of 9 July. &quot;Sunfish&quot; steamed to Midway for a refit period from 1 August to 19 August.

&quot;Sunfish&quot; began her eighth war patrol on 20 August when she departed Midway for the Yellow Sea. On 10 September she intercepted a convoy coming out of Tsushima Strait, sinking &quot;Chihaya Maru&quot; and damaging several other targets. On the night of 13 September, the &quot;Sunfish&quot; attacked another convoy sinking the &quot;Etashima Maru&quot; with damage claimed to other targets, including one ship left with her decks awash. The patrol ended at Pearl Harbor on 27 September.

== Ninth war patrol, October – December 1944 ==

&quot;Sunfish&quot; returned to the Yellow Sea on 23 October as part of a &quot;wolf pack&quot; that included and . On 17 November, the &quot;Sunfish&quot; sighted a convoy of eight ships led by the 21,000-ton escort carrier &quot;Shinyo&quot;. The carrier quickly passed out of range of the &quot;Sunfish&quot;, which signalled its find to the other members of the wolfpack. The &quot;Sunfish&quot; attacked the remaining ships of the convoy, sinking two troopships; the with 2,113 lives lost; and the with 448 lives lost. The &quot;Spadefish&quot; torpedoed and sank the &quot;Shinyo&quot;, with 1,130 lives lost. As the battle continued, the &quot;Peto&quot; sank &quot;Aisakasan Maru&quot; and &quot;Chinkai Maru&quot;, while &quot;Spadefish&quot; sank &quot;Submarine Chaser No. 156&quot;.

On 29 November, the &quot;Spadefish&quot; sank &quot;Daiboshi Maru&quot;. The following day the &quot;Sunfish&quot; sank the transport &quot;Dairen Maru&quot;. The patrol ended at Majuro, Marshall Islands, on 19 December 1944, with the wolfpack having sunk a total of 59,000 tons of Japanese shipping.

== Tenth and eleventh war patrols, January – April 1945 ==

&quot;Sunfish&quot; stood out of Majuro on 15 January 1945 to patrol in the East China and Yellow Seas. On 20 February, she collided with an ice floe damaging both periscopes, forcing a premature end to the patrol. The &quot;Sunfish&quot; arrived at Apra Harbor, Guam, on 27 February, for refit and repairs.

&quot;Sunfish&quot; began her eleventh, and last, war patrol on 31 March 1945 with Commander John W. Reed now in command, patrolling off Honshū and Hokkaidō. She operated in the approaches to Ominato in April. On the 9th, she damaged a ship which managed to speed away and enter a protected harbor. Five days later, &quot;Sunfish&quot; launched three torpedoes at a merchantman; but all missed. The submarine carried out a daylight attack on 16 April, sinking the transport &quot;Manryu Maru&quot; and the frigate &quot;Coast Defense Vessel No. 73&quot;. She expended her last torpedoes three days later in night-radar attacks, sinking &quot;Kaiho Maru&quot; and &quot;Taisei Maru&quot;. &quot;Sunfish&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 28 April and departed for the United States two days later.

==Postwar==
&quot;Sunfish&quot; was in the Mare Island Naval Shipyard from 7 May to 31 July for an overhaul and returned to Pearl Harbor on 9 August. She was preparing for another patrol when hostilities with Japan ceased. The submarine sailed out of Pearl Harbor on 29 August en route to the West Coast. She arrived at Mare Island on 5 September for inactivation, and was decommissioned there on 26 December 1945. She was the first submarine of the &quot;Gato&quot; class to be decommissioned after the war. &quot;Sunfish&quot; remained out of commission, serving as a classroom for naval reserve units until she was struck from the Navy List on 1 May 1960.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Sunfish&quot; received nine battle stars for World War II.

<doc id="1104379" wikidata="Q1034681" url="?curid=1104379" title="Rustic capitals">
<text>Rustic capitals () is an ancient Roman calligraphic script. Because the term is negatively connoted supposing an opposition to the more &#x27;civilized&#x27; form of the Roman square capitals, Bernhard Bischoff prefers to call the script &quot;canonized capitals&quot;. The script was used for writing secular texts.
== History ==

The script was used between the 1st century and the 9th century, most often between the 4th and 6th centuries. After the 5th century, rustic capitals began to fall out of use, but they continued to be used as a display script in titles and headings, along with uncial as the script of the main text.

== Structure ==
Rustic capitals are similar to Roman square capitals, but are less rigid, influenced more by pen and ink writing on papyrus or parchment. The letters are thinner and more compressed, use many more curved lines than do square capitals, and have descenders extending below the baseline. 

=== Syntax ===
The scripts written in rustic capitals use &quot;punctus&quot; marks (dots which are placed between the words) to denote word separation, contrary to the common practice of &quot;scriptura continua (&quot;the continuous writing of words without any form of separation see Uncial script).

== Surviving works ==

About fifty manuscripts with rustic capitals survive, including four copies of works by Virgil (including the Vergilius Vaticanus and the Vergilius Romanus), one copy of a work by Terence, and one of a work by Prudentius. The script was usually used for &quot;de luxe&quot; copies of pagan authors; the only works by Christian authors which use this script are those by Prudentius and Sedulius.

<doc id="1104388" wikidata="Q200527" url="?curid=1104388" title="Salisbury steak">
<text>Salisbury steak is a processed meat dish originating in the United States and made from a blend of ground beef and other ingredients, such as chicken and pork, being considered a version of Hamburg steak. Today, Salisbury steak is usually served with a gravy similar in texture to brown sauce, along with various side dishes, such as mashed potatoes and cooked vegetables (typically green beans and occasionally peas or corn). It is a common menu item served by diners and is frequently available as a TV dinner in supermarket frozen food sections.

== Background ==
Hamburg was a common embarkation point for transatlantic voyages during the first half of the 19th century and New York City was the most common destination. Various New York restaurants offered &quot;Hamburg-style American fillet&quot;, or even &quot;beefsteak à Hambourgeoise&quot;. Early American preparations of ground beef were therefore made to fit the tastes of European immigrants.

===Origin of the name===
James H. Salisbury (1823–1905) was an American physician and chemist known for his advocacy of a meat-centered diet to promote health, and the term &quot;Salisbury steak&quot; for a ground beef patty served as the main course has been used in the United States since 1897.

Salisbury recommended this recipe (somewhat different from modern Salisbury steak recipes) for the treatment of alimentation (digestive disorders):
== U.S. standards of identity (for packaged product) ==
United States Department of Agriculture standards for processed, packaged &quot;Salisbury steak&quot; require a minimum content of 65% meat, of which up to 25% can be pork. The exception is if de-fatted beef or pork is used, where the limit is 12% combined. No more than 30% may be fat. Meat byproducts are not permitted; however, beef heart meat is allowed. Extender (bread crumbs, flour, oat flakes, etc.) content is limited to 12%, except isolated soy protein at 6.8% is considered equivalent to 12% of the others. The remainder consists of seasonings, fungi or vegetables (onion, bell pepper, mushroom or the like), binders (can include egg) and liquids (such as water, milk, cream, skim milk, buttermilk, brine, vinegar, etc.). The product must be fully cooked, or else labeled &quot;Patties for Salisbury Steak&quot;.

<doc id="1104389" wikidata="Q7342652" url="?curid=1104389" title="Robert C. Richardson III">
<text>Robert Charlwood Richardson III (January 5, 1918 – January 2, 2011) was an American military officer of the United States Army Air Corps, and subsequently the United States Air Force, eventually attaining the rank of brigadier general. A leader in the early days of the US Air Force, he was a renowned expert in tactical nuclear warfare, NATO, and military long range planning.

==Early career==
Richardson was born in Rockford, Illinois, the son of (future) General Robert C. Richardson Jr. In 1932, he attended the Gunnery School in Washington, Connecticut, and in 1933, entered Valley Forge Military Academy in Wayne, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1935. He received a congressional appointment from Pennsylvania to the United States Military Academy and graduated in June 1939. He joined the expanding US Army Air Forces attending pilot training schools in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Randolph and Kelly fields, Texas, graduating in June 1940. In July 1940, he was assigned as a flight instructor at Randolph Field flying AT-6 Texan and AT-7 Navigator training aircraft and subsequently in the advanced twin-engine school at Barksdale Field, flying Martin B-10 bombers. In September 1941, he was transferred to the 52nd Fighter Group, Selfridge Field, served as squadron commander and group operations officer flying P-40 Warhawk pursuit aircraft, and went with the Group to Norfolk, Virginia, and Florence, South Carolina.

==On Ascension Island==
In April 1942, he took command of the 1st Composite Squadron, a unit of 18 P-39 Airacobras pursuit aircraft and five B-25 Mitchell bombers being organized at Key Field, Meridian, Mississippi. He deployed, in August 1942, to the newly constructed and secret Wideawake Airfield on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean. Their function was to patrol the sea around the island, to detect and destroy any enemy submarines and surface raiders, and to protect Allied ships in the vicinity of the island. Wideawake Airfield was a key refueling base on the only air resupply route in 1942–1943 connecting the United States to the Allied Western Desert Campaign raging in North Africa and the Soviet forces through the Persian Gulf and the Caucuses.

The air route stretched from Florida and Texas across the Caribbean region, down the South American east coast to Natal and Recife Brazil, across the South Atlantic through Ascension Island to the British and Belgian colonies in West Africa, across the bottom of the Sahara Desert to Khartoum Sudan, and up the Nile to Egypt and Allied forces in the Middle East and beyond. This was the only way to get large-to-medium aircraft and urgent military supplies to the British Middle East Command in Egypt (for which the U.S. Ninth Air Force was providing air support) in the Allied 1943 Egypt–Libya Campaign leading up to the defeat of Rommel and securing North Africa following Operation Torch and the Tunisia Campaign in late 1943.

==&quot;Laconia&quot; incident==
On early 15 September 1942, while senior operations officer at Ascension, Captain Richardson was notified by the island&#x27;s British liaison that had been torpedoed. Later that morning a transiting A-20 reported sighting and taking fire from two German U-boats. Two dispatched B-25 bombers found neither the submarines nor &quot;Laconia&quot;. Later that night at about 10 p.m., Richardson was asked to assist in rescue efforts by providing air cover for the en route merchant ships, the nearby &quot;Empire Haven&quot; and HMS &quot;Corinthian&quot; at Takoorida. The next day a transiting B-24D Liberator from the 343rd Bombardment Squadron was sent to investigate and found four U-boats displaying the Red Cross flag engaged in rescue operations from the sinking of &quot;Laconia&quot;.

U-boat commander, Lieutenant Commander Werner Hartenstein, had secured permission to conduct rescue operations after discovering that the ship he had just torpedoed, RMS &quot;Laconia&quot;, carried 1,800 Italian prisoners, a few hundred British and Polish soldiers, plus some number of civilians including women and children, British dependents from Egypt. &quot;U-156&quot; was crammed above and below decks with nearly two hundred survivors, including five women, and had another 200 in tow aboard four lifeboats. On 16 September at 11:25 a.m., &quot;U-156&quot; was spotted by an American B-24 Liberator bomber flying from a secret airbase on Ascension Island. The submarine was travelling with a Red Cross flag draped across her gun deck. Hartenstein signalled to the pilot in both Morse code and English requesting assistance. A British RAF officer also messaged the aircraft: &quot;Laconia survivors on board, soldiers, civilians, women, children&quot;

Lieutenant James D. Harden of the US Army Air Forces did not respond to the messages, and turned away and notified his base of the situation. The senior officer on duty that day, Captain Robert C. Richardson III, who claimed later that he did not know that this was a Red Cross-sanctioned German rescue operation, ordered the B-24 to &quot;sink the sub&quot;. The patrolling bomber loaded with depth charges and bombs reported that the submarine had a white flag with a red cross and they had unsuccessfully challenged the submarine via radio to display its national flag. The submarine blinked via signal light what the bomber crew understood to read &quot;German Sir&quot;. The bomber crew asked Ascension Island what to do next.

This action became known as the &quot;Laconia incident&quot;, and led Grossadmiral Karl Dönitz, chief of German Submarine Operations, to issue the &quot;Laconia Order&quot; to his U-boat commanders that stated in part &quot;No attempt of any kind must be made at rescuing members of ships sunk ...&quot; At the end of the war, the Laconia Order was unsuccessfully used against Admiral Dönitz in his war crime trial, because Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz testified that in the war with Japan the US Navy had followed the same general policy as was set forth in the German admiral&#x27;s directive. The Laconia Incident showed how a small tactical decision can have strategic impact across history.

==Back to the United States and on to Europe==
While on Ascension Island, then-Major Richardson boasted, over drinks, to a visiting Air Staff team that he could successfully ferry a group of P-38 Lightnings via the South Atlantic air route. In March 1943, Richardson was ordered back to the United States as the project officer and flight leader to make good his boast that he could ferry P-38 Lightnings to North Africa via the South Atlantic. In April 1943, he successfully delivered 52 of the original 53 aircraft to Morocco to reinforce US air forces supporting Operation TORCH. From there he was assigned back to the United States as chief of the Aircraft Division, and later as chief of the Fighter Division, Army Air Force Board, Orlando, Florida where he had the opportunity to test fly a number of the experimental aircraft to include the XP-59A, Airacomet, the first US jet fighter, then undergoing testing at Muroc Army Air Field.

In July 1944, he was reassigned to the Operations Division, Headquarters US Strategic Air Force in Europe. He spent the first month touring European fighter units briefing them on what he learned from flying the XP-59A, Airacomet, and on suggested tactics to use against the new German jet aircraft. He then served as an action officer in General Carl Spaatz&#x27;s headquarters in London and Paris through December 1944 where he coordinated what new equipment and weapons coming from the CONUS based Army Force Board with what the European combat units said they needed and experienced. In January 1945, he transferred to the Operations Division of Headquarters, IX Tactical Air Command, Ninth Air Force. In April 1945, he assumed command of the 365th Fighter Group, &quot;The Hell Hawks,&quot; at Fritzlar, Germany. He led the unit in their support of the General Patton&#x27;s final push into Germany then transitioned the P-47 Thunderbolt fighter group from wartime to peacetime operations. Upon the redeployment of the 365th Fighter Group back to the United States in September 1945, he remained in the Occupation Forces as chief of the Aircraft Allocation Division, Headquarters, US Air Forces in Europe. In February 1946, he became assistant chief of staff for operations, European Air Transport Service where it was his task to round up, account for, and dispose of all the US aircraft in the European Theater as the US Army Air Forces rapidly demobilized and sent units back to the United States.

==Evolving into a strategic long-range planner==
In June 1946, then-Lieutenant Colonel Richardson was assigned to the War Plans Division of the Air Staff in Washington, D.C. In July 1947, he was transferred to the Joint War Plans Committee, which in December 1947, upon implementation of the 1947 Unification Act, became Joint Strategic Plans Group, Joint Chiefs of Staff. Upon creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in 1949, newly promoted Colonel Richardson became the first Air Force planner on the NATO Standing Group.

==NATO years==
As one of the original NATO war planners, he prepared the European Theater war plans on how to counter a potential Cold War invasion by the overwhelming Soviet land forces that outnumbered US and NATO conventional forces by a factor of 10-to-1. He worked the negotiation of an agreement for Germany&#x27;s rearmament and for the establishment of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE) in Paris, France. In February 1951, Richardson accompanied General Lauris Norstad to Europe as a member of his planning staff. In July 1951, he was designated as the US Joint Chiefs of Staff representative and military observer to the European Defense Community Treaty Conference in Paris. In July 1953, he was assigned to the Plans Staff of the Air Deputy, SHAPE, when responsibility for US military advice to the European Defense Community was transferred from the US Ambassador to the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. From July 1953 to July 1955, Richardson was special assistant to Air Vice-Marshal Edmund Hudleston, Royal Air Force, Deputy Chief of Staff/Operations SHAPE, and later, the deputy director/policy, Headquarters SHAPE, serving primarily as the US Air Force member of the Inter-Allied Planning Committee (New Approach Group) that developed the concept for an atomic defense of Europe. In that capacity he wrote the original NATO atomic or nuclear war plans and became one of the US military&#x27;s leading authorities on tactical nuclear warfare, strategy, and concepts.

In July 1955, Richardson returned to the United States to attend the National War College, graduating in June 1956. He assumed command of the 83rd Fighter Wing (redesignated 4th Fighter Wing) flying F-86H Sabre and re-opened Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina.

==Atomic weapons and the evolution of theater nuclear warfare==
From his experience thinking of and drafting NATO&#x27;s nuclear war plans under President Eisenhower&#x27;s emphasis on atomic defense to counter Soviet conventional superiority led him in 1955 to publish a series of articles on nuclear and atomic warfare in the &quot;Air University Review.&quot; As a result, Richardson had become an acknowledged military expert in nuclear warfare and a regular lecturer on the subject at the National Defense College and Air War College. In January 1958, he was transferred to Headquarters US Air Force, to become assistant for Long Range Objectives to the deputy chief of staff/plans and programs. He was promoted to brigadier general in May 1960.

With the installation of the new Kennedy Administration, Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara directed the dismantlement of the Air Force and Navy long range plans staffs and ordered the services&#x27; long range planning experts out of Washington and into the field. This along with imposing a more restrictive editorial policy on the military services&#x27; strategy journals removed the services&#x27; key thinkers from the Washington debates arising from the administration&#x27;s new strategic direction with regard to military procurement and military strategy development. As a result, in June 1961, Richardson was transferred to the Military Assistance Division, Headquarters US European Command, Paris, France, and upon arrival was detailed by General Norstad as director of operations for Live Oak, the Tripartite Berlin Plans and Operations Group air force team that coordinated and executed the NATO air responses to the Soviet attempts close down the Berlin air corridors during the Berlin Crisis. Upon termination of the Berlin Crisis, Richardson was assigned as deputy standing group representative, NATO, effective 1 January 1962 through 1 January 1964.

==Air Force System Command and strategic acquisition development==

Given Secretary of Defense McNamara&#x27;s known hostility toward any military service long-range planning and to Richardson&#x27;s strategic thinking, the Air Force assigned Richardson to Headquarters Air Force Systems Command, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. He served as assistant to the commander, then assistant deputy chief of staff for plans, and in August 1965, he was assigned as the deputy chief of staff for science and technology. On 31 July 1966, he reported to Field Command, Defense Atomic Support Agency.

His final military assignment was to Headquarters Field Command, Defense Atomic Support Agency, Sandia Base, New Mexico, as deputy commander for weapons and training where he was responsible for managing atomic weapon development and training activities and the nuclear weapons stockpile.

==Defense policy consultant and learning to influence public policy==
Richardson retired from active duty on 1 August 1967 and began his second career as a writer, lecturer, and consultant on defense issues, nuclear strategy, and aerospace technology management. He joined his long-time friend and former AFSC commander, General Bernard Adolph Schriever, as a senior associate with Schriever &amp; McKee Associate Consultants to bring his aerospace and systems management expertise to bear on the issues facing urban America.

In the 1970s, Richardson greatly expanded his work as an author, lecturer, and policy advocate in the areas of national security, defense theory, defense policy formulation, nuclear strategy, defense technology acquisition, and long range planning. During this decade, he actively advocated conservative viewpoints regarding defense and national security public policy issues serving as:

* consultant to American Enterprise Institute
* assistant editor for Journal of International Security
* member of the American Security Council
* executive director, American Foreign Policy Institute
* secretary-treasurer for Security and Intelligence Fund
* co-chairman of the Coalition for Peace Through Defense

As recognized authority on tactical nuclear warfare and defense technology acquisition, he also served as consultant to Los Alamos National Laboratory (1971–1979), US and European aerospace industries, and Stanford Research Institute.

==High frontier and the space-based missile defense==

In 1981, Richardson teamed up with Lieutenant General Daniel O. Graham on a Heritage Foundation project called High Frontier to formulate a long-term national strategy and plan to build a US space-based missile defense. This plan was the foundation for President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative. Richardson went on to serve as deputy directory for the High Frontier non-profit organization from 1981 to 2003 that not only advocated the maximum use of US space technology for missile defense but also for the industrial and commercial use of space. Over the two decades he was with High Frontier, Richardson successfully advocated for President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative, established the Space Transportation Association, advocated the single-stage-to-orbit (or SSTO) vehicle as a follow-on to the Space Shuttle, and more recently, helped develop a long-term strategy to colonize the Moon.

<text>The Bounty Islands (; &quot;Island of angry wind&quot;) are a small group of uninhabited granite islets and numerous rocks, with a combined area of circa in the South Pacific Ocean. Territorially part of New Zealand, they lie about east-south-east of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, south-west of the Chatham Islands, and north of the Antipodes Islands. The group is a World Heritage Site.

The islands are listed with the New Zealand Outlying Islands. The islands are an immediate part of New Zealand, but not part of any region or district. Rather, they are listed as an &quot;Area Outside Territorial Authority&quot;, similar to all other outlying islands except for the Solander Islands / Hautere.

==History==
Captain William Bligh discovered the Bounty Islands en route from Spithead to Tahiti in 1788, and named them after his ship HMS &quot;Bounty&quot;, just months before the famous mutiny. The location of the islands were only roughly marked on charts. In early 1866 Commander W. H. Norman of HMVS &quot;Victoria&quot; was tasked with determining more accurately their position. He reported them as being latitude 47°50&#x27; South and longitude 179°00&#x27; East. Captain George Palmer, during the search for the &quot;Matoaka&quot;, placed the islands at 47°46&#x27;24&quot; South 178°56&#x27;45&quot; East. Palmer also annexed the islands for New Zealand.

During the 19th century the area was a popular hunting-ground for sealers. The islands were also searched from time to time for missing ships and crews, including those from the &quot;General Grant&quot; and the &quot;Matoaka&quot;.

The &quot;Hinemoa&quot; visited the islands in March 1886 and erected a depot for marooned sailors on the largest island. Captain Fairchild noted that there was no fresh water available on these islands. The depot had been destroyed by the sea by the time the &quot;Stella&quot; visited the island in 1887. A new Admiralty chart 1022 was issued for the area in 1888, which took into account survey work undertaken by the &quot;Hinemoa&quot;.

In November 1891 the &quot;Hinemoa&quot; returned to the islands and built a fresh provisions storage.
==Flora and fauna==
Ecologically, the islands are part of the Antipodes Subantarctic Islands tundra ecoregion. Plants include Cook&#x27;s scurvy grass. The group is home to an endemic spider &quot;Pacificana cockayni&quot;, endemic insects, and large numbers of seabirds.

===Important Bird Area===
The Bounty group has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for erect-crested penguins, Salvin&#x27;s albatrosses and Bounty shags.

==Geography==
There are 13 granite islands that make up the Bounty Island group. The whole chain is only across at its longest axis, and comprises three subgroups: the Main Group, the Centre Group, and the East Group. The total area is only . 

The Main Group is the largest of the three groups, and is located in the northwest of the chain. It includes the group&#x27;s largest island, Depot Island, which is around 700 metres in length and 400 metres across at its widest point. Proclamation and Tunnel Islands are separated from Depot Island by only a narrow cleft, and are joined to it at low tide. A small islet off the north coast of this group&#x27;s Spider Island is the chain&#x27;s northernmost point; the westernmost point is the western tip of Penguin Island.

The Centre Group is located some 1.5 to 2 kilometres to the southeast of the Main Group, and contains three main islands, arrayed in a north–south line. A smaller islet lies immediately to the west. The northernmost of the Centre Group, Funnel Island, contains the chain&#x27;s highest point, at above sea level. 

A further 1.5 kilometres to the east is the East Group, which is also arrayed roughly in a north–south line. The largest island in this group, Molly Cap, is the group&#x27;s southernmost island, and contains the chain&#x27;s second-highest point, above sea level. This group contains two large islets and one small islet, along with several reefs and stacks, one of which is the easternmost point in the chain.

The islands are at the antipodes of Bouillé-Ménard, in France (Pays de la Loire).

<text>Anacapri () is a &quot;comune&quot; on the island of Capri, in the Metropolitan City of Naples, Italy.

Anacapri is located higher on the island than Capri (about higher on average)—the Ancient Greek prefix &quot;ana-&quot; meaning &quot;up&quot; or &quot;above&quot;. Administratively, it maintains a separate status from the &quot;comune&quot; of Capri.

Anacapri is widely known for its picturesque, rural tranquility, broad views of the Bay of Naples, and significant historic sites, including Villa San Michele.

==Overview==
Bus and taxi services connect Marina Grande to Capri and Anacapri via the numerous hairpin turns of Via Giuseppe Orlandi.

A chairlift in Anacapri (&quot;seggiovia&quot;) connects Piazza Vittoria to the Monte Solaro, providing wide views of the south-facing coast.

Punta Carena Lighthouse is located from the main town.

French composer Claude Debussy named one of the pieces from his first book of preludes—No. 5, &quot;Les collines d&#x27;Anacapri&quot; (&quot;The Hills of Anacapri&quot;)—in homage to the community.

<doc id="1104396" wikidata="Q1144893" url="?curid=1104396" title="Piriformis muscle">
<text>The piriformis muscle () is a flat, pyramidally-shaped muscle in the gluteal region of the lower limbs. It is one of the six muscles in the lateral rotator group.

The piriformis muscle has its origin upon the front surface of the sacrum, and inserts onto the greater trochanter of the femur. Depending upon the given position of the leg, it acts either as external (lateral) rotator of the thigh or as abductor of the thigh. It is innervated by the piriformis nerve.

==Structure==

The piriformis is a flat muscle, and is pyramidal in shape.

=== Origin ===
The piriformis muscle originates from the anterior (front) surface of the sacrum by three fleshy digitations attached to the second, third, and fourth sacral vertebra.

It also arises from the superior margin of the greater sciatic notch, the gluteal surface of the ilium (near the posterior inferior iliac spine), the sacroiliac joint capsule, and (sometimes) the sacrotuberous ligament (more specifically, the superior part of the pelvic surface of this ligament).

=== Insertion ===
The muscle inserts onto the greater trochanter of the femur (its tendon unite with the tendons of the superior gemellus, inferior gemellus, and obturator internus muscles prior to insertion).

=== Innervation ===
The piriformis muscle is innervated by the piriformis nerve.

=== Relations ===
The posterior aspect of the muscle lies against the sacrum. The anterior surface of the muscle is related to the rectum (especially on the left side of the body), and the sacral plexus.

The muscle lies almost parallel with the posterior margin of the gluteus medius. It is situated partly within the pelvis against its posterior wall, and partly at the back of the hip joint.

It exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen superior to the sacrospinous ligament.

=== Variation ===
In around 80% of the population, the sciatic nerve travels below the piriformis muscle. In 17% of people, the piriformis muscle is pierced by parts or all of the sciatic nerve. Several variations occur, one of which is the rarely found Beaton&#x27;s type-b where the sciatic nerve divides between and below the piriformis.

It may be united with the gluteus medius, send fibers to the gluteus minimus, or receive fibers from the superior gemellus.

It may have one or two sacral attachments; or it may be inserted into the capsule of the hip joint.

== Function==
The piriformis muscle is part of the lateral rotators of the hip, along with the quadratus femoris, gemellus inferior, gemellus superior, obturator externus, and obturator internus. The piriformis laterally rotates the femur with hip extension and abducts the femur with hip flexion. Abduction of the flexed thigh is important in the action of walking because it shifts the body weight to the opposite side of the foot being lifted, which prevents falling. The action of the lateral rotators can be understood by crossing the legs to rest an ankle on the knee of the other leg. This causes the femur to rotate and point the knee laterally. The lateral rotators also oppose medial rotation by the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus. When the hip is flexed to 90 degrees, piriformis abducts the femur at the hip and reverses primary function, internally rotating the hip when the hip is flexed at 90 degrees or more.

== Clinical significance==

=== Piriformis syndrome ===
Piriformis syndrome occurs when the piriformis irritates the sciatic nerve, which comes into the gluteal region beneath the muscle, causing pain in the buttocks and referred pain along the sciatic nerve. This referred pain is known as &quot;sciatica&quot;. Seventeen percent of the population has their sciatic nerve coursing through the piriformis muscle. This subgroup of the population is predisposed to developing sciatica.
Sciatica can be described by pain, tingling, or numbness deep in the buttocks and along the sciatic nerve. Sitting down, stretching, climbing stairs, and performing squats usually increases pain. Diagnosing the syndrome is usually based on symptoms and on the physical exam. More testing, including MRIs, X-rays, and nerve conduction tests can be administered to exclude other possible diseases. If diagnosed with piriformis syndrome, the first treatment involves progressive stretching exercises, massage therapy (including neuromuscular therapy) and physical treatment. Corticosteroids can be injected into the piriformis muscle if pain continues. Findings suggest the possibility that Botulinum toxin type B may be of potential benefit in the treatment of pain attributed to piriformis syndrome. A more invasive, but sometimes necessary treatment involves surgical exploration; however, the side effects of the surgery could be much worse than alternative treatments such as physical therapy. Surgery should always be a last resort.

===Landmark===
The piriformis is a very important landmark in the gluteal region. As it travels through the greater sciatic foramen, it effectively divides it into an inferior and superior part.

This determines the name of the vessels and nerves in this region – the nerve and vessels that emerge superior to the piriformis are the superior gluteal nerve and superior gluteal vessels. Inferiorly, it is the same, and the sciatic nerve also travels inferiorly to the piriformis.

== History ==
The piriformis muscle was first named by Adriaan van den Spiegel, a professor from the University of Padua in the 16th century.

<doc id="1104398" wikidata="Q2353239" url="?curid=1104398" title="Trolley pole">
<text>A trolley pole is a tapered cylindrical pole of wood or metal, used to transfer electricity from a &quot;live&quot; (electrified) overhead wire to the control and the electric traction motors of a tram or trolley bus. It is a type of current collector. The use of overhead wire in a system of current collection is reputed to be the 1880 invention of Frank J. Sprague, but the first working trolley pole was developed and demonstrated by Charles Van Depoele, in autumn 1885.

An early development of an experimental tramway in Toronto, Ontario, was built in 1883, having been developed by John Joseph Wright, brother of swindler Whitaker Wright. While Wright may have assisted in the installation of electric railways at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), and may even have used a pole system, there is no evidence about this. Likewise, Wright never filed or was issued a patent.

Credit for development of the first working trolley pole is given to Charles Joseph Van Depoele, a Belgian engineer who moved to the United States in 1869. Van Depoele made the first public demonstration of the spring-loaded device on a temporary streetcar line installed at the Toronto Industrial Exhibition (now the CNE) in autumn 1885. Depoele&#x27;s first trolley pole was &quot;crude&quot; and not very reliable, and he reverted to using the troller system of current collection for a commercial installation on a streetcar system in South Bend, Indiana, which opened on November 14, 1885, and on one in Montgomery, Alabama, in April 1886. However, within a few months, Van Depoele switched to the trolley-pole system for the Montgomery operation. Van Depoele and fellow inventor Frank J. Sprague were &quot;working on similar ideas at about the same time&quot;, and Sprague employed trolley-pole current collection on an electric streetcar system he installed in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888, also improving the trolley pole wheel and pole designs. Known as the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, this system was the first large-scale trolley line in the world, opening to great fanfare on February 12, 1888.
The grooved trolley wheel was used on many large city systems through the 1940s and 1950s; it was generally used on systems with &quot;old&quot; style round cross sectional overhead wire. The trolley wheel was problematic at best; the circumferential contact of the grooved wheel bearing on the underside of the overhead wire provided minimal electrical contact and tended to arc excessively, increasing overhead wire wear. The newer sliding carbon trolley shoe was generally used with a newer grooved overhead trolley wire of a roughly &quot;figure 8&quot; cross section. The sliding trolley shoe provided better electrical contact (with a reduction in arcing), and it dramatically reduced overhead wire wear. Many systems began converting to the sliding trolley shoe in the 1920s; Milwaukee, Wisconsin converted its large system in the late 1920s. Philadelphia did not convert its trolley wheels on its remaining streetcars until 1978. Although a streetcar with a trolley wheel may evoke an antique look, the trolley shoe is modern and more practical as well as economical.

==Description of the device==
A trolley pole is not attached to the overhead wire. The pole sits atop a sprung base on the roof of the vehicle, with springs providing the pressure to keep the trolley wheel or shoe in contact with the wire. If the pole is made of wood, a cable brings the electric current down to the vehicle. A metal pole may use such a cable, or may itself be electrically &quot;live&quot;, requiring the base to be insulated from the vehicle body.

On systems with double-ended tram cars capable of running in both directions, the trolley pole must always be pulled behind the car and not pushed, or &quot;dewiring&quot; is very likely, which can cause damage to the overhead wires. At terminus points, the conductor must turn the trolley pole around to face the correct direction, pulling it off the wire either with a rope or a pole and walking it around to the other end. In some cases, two trolley poles are provided, one for each direction: in this case it is a matter of raising one and lowering the other. Since the operator could raise the pole at one end whilst the conductor lowered the other, this saved time and was much easier for the conductor. Care had to be taken to raise the downed pole first, to eliminate the damage caused by arcing between the pole and wire. In the US, the dual-pole system was the most common arrangement on double-ended vehicles. However, pushing of the pole (called &quot;back-poling&quot; in the US or &quot;spear-poling&quot; in Australia), was quite common where the trams were moving at slow speeds, such as at wye terminals (also known as reversers) and whilst backing into the sheds.
Trolley poles are usually raised and lowered manually by a rope from the back of the vehicle. The rope feeds into a spring reel mechanism, called a &quot;trolley catcher&quot; or &quot;trolley retriever&quot;. The trolley catcher contains a detent, like that in an automotive shoulder safety belt, which &quot;catches&quot; the rope to prevent the trolley pole from flying upward if the pole is dewired. The similar looking retriever (see photo) adds a spring mechanism that yanks the pole downward if it should leave the wire, pulling it away from all overhead wire fittings. Catchers are commonly used on trams operating at lower speeds, as in a city, whilst retrievers are used on suburban and interurban lines to limit damage to the overhead at speed.

On some older systems, the poles were raised and lowered using a long pole with a metal hook. Where available, these may have been made of bamboo due to its length, natural straightness and strength, combined with its relative light weight and the fact that it is an insulator. Trolleybuses usually carried one with the vehicle, for use in the event of dewirement, but tram systems usually had them placed along the route at locations where the trolley pole would need reversing.

The poles used on trolleybuses are typically longer than those used on trams, to allow the bus to take fuller advantage of its not being restricted to a fixed path in the street (the rails), by giving a degree of lateral steerability, enabling the trolleybus to board passengers at curbside.

==Single- and double-pole usage==
When used on a &quot;tram&quot; or &quot;trolley car&quot; (i.e. a railway vehicle), a single trolley pole usually collects current from the overhead wire, and the steel rails on the tracks act as the electrical return. To reduce electrolytic corrosion of underground pipes and metallic structures, most tram lines are operated with the wire positive with respect to the rails. &quot;Trolleybuses&quot;, on the other hand, must use two trolley poles and dual overhead wires, one pole and wire for the positive &quot;live&quot; current, the other for the negative or neutral return. The tramway system in Havana, Cuba, also utilized the dual-wire system, as did the Cincinnati, Ohio streetcar system.

==Decline in usage on railways==

All trolleybuses use trolley poles, and thus trolley poles remain in use worldwide, wherever trolleybuses are in operation (some 315 cities ), and several manufacturers continue to make them, including Kiepe, Škoda and Lekov.

However, on most railway vehicles using overhead wire, the trolley pole has given way to the bow collector or, later, the pantograph, a folding metal device that presses a wide contact pan against the overhead wire. While more complex than the trolley pole, the pantograph has the advantage of being almost free from dewiring, being more stable at high speed, and being easier to raise and lower automatically. Also, on double-ended trams, they eliminate the need to manually turn the trolley pole when changing direction (although this disadvantage can be overcome to some extent through the use of trolley reversers). The use of pantographs (or bow collectors) exclusively also eliminates the need for wire frogs (switches in the overhead wiring) to make sure the pole goes in the correct direction at junctions.

The trolley pole with a shoe at its tip is problematic for longer modern streetcars that draw more electricity than older streetcars. In Toronto, the trolley pole shoe contains a carbon insert to provide electrical contact with the overhead wire and to lower the shoe to clear overhead wire hangers. Carbon inserts wear out and must be periodically replaced. The trolley shoe inserts on Toronto&#x27;s modern Flexity Outlook streetcars quickly wear out in rainy conditions, lasting as little as eight hours instead of the expected one to two days for shorter older streetcars. The extra current draw shortens the life of the carbon insert. A worn-out carbon insert would damage the overhead wire, stopping streetcar service.

Apart from heritage streetcar lines, very few tram/streetcar systems worldwide continue to use trolley poles on vehicles used in normal service.

=== Compatibility with pantographs ===
Trams or light rail cars equipped with pantographs normally cannot operate on lines with overhead wiring designed for trolley-pole collection. For this reason, these systems and a few others worldwide retain use of trolley poles, even on new streetcars, in order to avoid the difficulty and expense of modifying long stretches of existing overhead wires to accept pantographs.

However, the Toronto Transit Commission, with the impending replacement of its legacy CLRV and ALRV with new Flexity Outlook cars, converted its overhead power supply to be compatible with both trolley poles and pantographs on an interim basis, as the CLRVs and ALRVs use only trolley poles while the Flexity fleet is equipped for both trolley poles and pantographs.

Large portions of San Francisco&#x27;s surface network are also set up to handle both trolley pole and pantograph operation in order to allow for compatibility both with Muni&#x27;s current fleet of light rail vehicles (pantograph only), as well as Muni&#x27;s historic streetcar fleet (trolley pole only).

==Cultural references==

Upon their introduction, trolley poles and the new electrical technology they represented were fascinating to writers, with their lightning-like sparks and power.

In January 1889, Boston introduced its first electric streetcars, which became so popular and noteworthy that poet Oliver Wendell Holmes composed a verse about the new trolley pole technology, and the sparking contact shoe at its apex:
In 1947, composer Samuel Barber wrote the now-classic orchestral and vocal piece &quot;&quot;, based on the childhood reminiscences of James Agee. Partway through the composition, the singer refers to a noisy passing streetcar, with its overhead trolley pole and sparks:

<doc id="1104401" wikidata="Q640569" url="?curid=1104401" title="Piriformis syndrome">
<text>Piriformis syndrome is a condition which is believed to result from nerve compression at the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle. It is a specific case of deep gluteal syndrome. 

The largest and most bulky nerve in the human body is the sciatic nerve. Starting at its origin it is 2 cm wide and 0.5 cm thick. The sciatic nerve forms the roots of L4-S3 segments of the lumbosacral plexus. The nerve will pass inferiorly to the piriformis muscle, in the direction of the lower limb where it divides into common tibial and fibular nerves. Symptoms may include pain and numbness in the buttocks and down the leg. Often symptoms are worsened with sitting or running.
Causes may include trauma to the gluteal muscle, spasms of the piriformis muscle, anatomical variation, or an overuse injury. Few cases in athletics, however, have been described. Diagnosis is difficult as there is no definitive test. A number of physical exam maneuvers can be supportive. Medical imaging is typically normal. Other conditions that may present similarly include a herniated disc.
Treatment may include avoiding activities that cause symptoms, stretching, physiotherapy, and medication such as NSAIDs. Steroid or botulinum toxin injections may be used in those who do not improve. Surgery is not typically recommended. The frequency of the condition is unknown, with different groups arguing it is more or less common.

== Anatomy ==
The piriformis is a flat, pear-shaped muscle. The thicker side of the piriformis is medial (closer to the center of the body). The function of the piriformis is as an external thigh rotator. When the hip is extended, such as standing, the piriformis rotates the thigh outwards. When the hip is flexed, such as sitting, the piriformis abducts the hip (spreading the legs). The piriformis originates at the anterior surface of the sacrum, passes through the greater sciatic foramen, and inserts at the greater trochanter.

The sciatic nerve is the largest peripheral nerve in the body and innervates significant portions of the skin and muscles of the thigh, leg, and foot. The sciatic nerve originates from spinal nerves L4-S3. It forms in the pelvis from nerves of the sacral plexus, and exits the greater sciatic foramen just underneath the piriformis. A number of anatomic variations exist in the branching pattern of sciatic nerve around the piriformis, such as passing over, through, or under the piriformis, as well as early branching into the tibial nerve and common peroneal nerve before passing the piriformis.

==Signs and symptoms==
Patients with piriformis syndrome may have some of the following symptoms:

* sciatica, or pain felt in the leg along the distribution of the sciatic nerve
* external tenderness near the greater sciatic notch
* buttock pain
* pain on any maneuver that increases piriformis muscle tension
* pain aggravated on sitting
* limitation of the straight leg raise

There are also some reports of gluteal atrophy on the same side as the symptoms for chronic cases, but this is less commonly seen.

==Etiology==
Causes of piriformis syndrome include the following
*Trauma to the hip or buttock area such as a fall is the most common precipitating factor.
* Athletes and weightlifters overtraining or acquiring a repetitive strain injury, causing piriformis irritation or hypertrophy
* Sitting for prolonged periods (office workers, taxi drivers, bicycle riders)
* Anatomic variations which might cause piriformis syndrome have been reported (e.g. sciatic nerve branching, bipartite piriformis muscle, etc), however comprehensive anatomic data on the piriformis morphology is lacking. In other words, patients with piriformis syndrome sometimes have anatomic variations suggesting a cause, but it&#x27;s not known if these anatomic variations actually occur more frequently in patients with piriformis syndrome. 
* A heavily scrutinized anatomic variation involves sciatic nerve branching around the piriformis using the 6 category classification first described by Beaton and Anson. In this classification, the normal anatomy (type A) seen in about 80% of people is where the sciatic nerve passes under the piriformis muscle at the greater sciatic notch. However, the incidence of atypical anatomic variations (types B-F) has not been found to differ significantly between piriformis syndrome patients and cadavers, leading to doubt about the importance of this anatomic variation in the development of piriformis syndrome.

==Pathophysiology==

Under certain conditions, the piriformis muscle is believed to compress the sciatic nerve, also known as sciatic nerve entrapment, causing sciatica. The pathophysiology of piriformis syndrome is not completely understood. There are several mechanisms by which the piriformis muscle is thought to be capable of compressing the sciatic nerve, and these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.

Piriformis muscle spasm may compress the sciatic nerve&quot;.&quot; As the piriformis muscle spasms, it shortens and becomes harder, applying greater pressure on the sciatic nerve against the ischium at the inferior greater sciatic foramen. The empirical evidence supporting this is that patients can often see immediate and permanent relief from local anesthetic and the effectiveness of Botox injections as a muscle relaxer.

Piriformis muscle hypertrophy may cause crowding around the greater sciatic foramen. Both the piriformis and sciatic nerve pass through the greater sciatic foramen and the deep gluteal space. An enlarged (hypertrophic) piriformis muscle may place pressure on nearby structures. The empirical evidence supporting this is that ipsilateral (same-side) piriformis hypertrophy is a common image finding in piriformis syndrome, and that botox injections reduce symptoms (by paralyzing a muscle for months the muscle shrinks).

A single injury, or many smaller injuries, may predispose the piriformis muscle to fibrosis, making the tissue tougher and tighter, applying greater pressure on the sciatic nerve against the ischium at the greater sciatic foramen. Or the formation of scar tissue from a hematoma might restrict normal movement of the sciatic nerve as it passes by the piriformis muscle. 

The piriformis may be capable of dynamically compressing the sciatic nerve with certain hip movements. The empirical evidence supporting this is the presence of electrophysiology testing abnormalities (delayed H reflex) of the sciatic nerve during the FAIR test, as well as the improvement of these electrophysiology results after successful treatment.

==Diagnosis==
Piriformis syndrome does not yet have a validated set of diagnostic criteria, however the diagnosis is primarily clinical, involving a physical examination and an evaluation of patient history. Imaging can assist in excluding other conditions with similar symptoms, such as lumbar disc herniation and spinal stenosis. Diagnostic injections of anesthetic into the piriformis may be used to confirm the diagnosis. Often piriformis syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion.

A complete exam of low back, pelvis, buttocks, lower extremities may be necessary to rule out differential diagnoses. Sciatica secondary to conditions to be ruled out include spinal disc herniation, facet arthropathy, spinal stenosis, lumbar muscle strain, wallet neuritis (sitting on a thick wallet), endometriosis, pelvic tumors, gluteal varicosities, and inferior gluteal artery aneuyrism. Pathology in the sacroiliac joint region, Sacroiliac joint dysfunction and Sacroiliitis are other conditions that present with pain in the low back and hip regions, which may radiate down along the back of the thigh, rarely going down below knee.

The clinical signs may involve unilateral or bilateral buttocks pain that fluctuates throughout the day, the absence of lower back pain, buttocks or sciatica pain when in the sitting position (especially for prolonged periods), sciatic pain with fluctuating periods without pain through out the day, buttocks pain near the piriformis. The pain may be exacerbated with any activity that causes flexion of the hip such as stooping or lifting. 

In a physical exam the piriformis can be palpated externally though it is so deep that it may not be possible to assess tenderness. If the piriformis can be located it may feel cord-like. Internal palpation is also possible which allows better access to assess piriformis muscle tenderness. There are a number of maneuvers that can be done in an attempt to provoke sciatic nerve compression. These tests either stretch the piriformis or cause the piriformis to contract. The most common tests used are the Freiberg test, FAIR test (flexion, adduction, internal rotation), Beatty test, Pace test, seated piriformis stretch test, and straight leg raise (Lasegue sign).

Diagnostic modalities such as EMG, x-rays, ultrasound, CT, MRI is mostly used to exclude other conditions. For example, and MRI of the spine can rule out conditions like radiculopathy and spinal stenosis. MRI of the pelvis can rule out conditions like pelvic tumors. MRI and ultrasound can be used to observe side-to-side differences, a common finding where the symptomatic side often exhibits increased piriformis size measured as increased thickness and cross-sectional area. Specialized sequences and protocols of MRI can be used for sciatic nerve imaging, namely MRN (magnetic resonance neurography) and DTI (diffusion tensor imaging). MRN can assess changes in the path, thickness, and signal intensity of the sciatic nerve. DTI uses the anisotropic diffusion of water to assess structural and functional properties of nerves. Both MRN and DTI can localize nerve lesions, their extension, and their spatial distribution due to conditions such as entrapment. MRN and DTI have also been used to visualize sciatic nerve lesions to diagnose of piriformis syndrome. However, magnetic resonance neurography is considered &quot;investigational/not medically necessary&quot; by some insurance companies. Neurography can determine whether or not a patient has a split sciatic nerve or a split piriformis muscle – this may be important in getting a good result from injections or surgery.

Image-guided injections into the piriformis muscle can assist in the diagnosis. Injections usually involve delivering anesthetic to the piriformis muscle to paralyze it. In the event of a piriformis muscle spasm causing sciatic nerve compression, paralyzing the piriformis muscle will temporarily relieve the symptoms. If successful, there should be a complete or near-complete relief of pain for 4-6 hours. Needle guidance can be done with fluoroscopy, ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Ultrasound is a popular choice due to its low cost, lack of radiation, and accessibility, but lacks the spatial resolution of CT/MRI. While there is no gold standard test to diagnose piriformis syndrome, in deep gluteal syndrome, the generalization of extra-spinal sciatica in the deep gluteal space, diagnostic blocks are considered the gold standard for differentiating alternate sources of pain.

==Prevention==
The most common etiology of piriformis syndrome is that resulting from a specific previous injury due to trauma. Large injuries include trauma to the buttocks while &quot;micro traumas&quot; result from small repeated bouts of stress on the piriformis muscle itself. To the extent that piriformis syndrome is the result of some type of trauma and not neuropathy, such secondary causes are considered preventable, especially those occurring in daily activities: according to this theory, periods of prolonged sitting, especially on hard surfaces, produce minor stress that can be relieved with bouts of standing. An individual&#x27;s environment, including lifestyle factors and physical activity, determine susceptibility to trauma of any given type. Although empirical research findings on the subject have never been published, many believe that taking sensible precautions during high-impact sports and when working in physically demanding conditions may decrease the risk of experiencing piriformis syndrome, either by forestalling injury to the muscle itself or injury to the nerve root that causes it to spasm. In this vein, proper safety and padded equipment should be worn for protection during any type of regular, firm contact (e.g. American football). In the workplace, individuals are encouraged to make regular assessments of their surroundings and attempt to recognize those things in their routine that may produce micro or macro traumas. No research has substantiated the effectiveness of any such routine, however, and participation in one may do nothing but heighten an individual&#x27;s sense of worry over physical minutiae while have no effect in reducing the likeliness of experiencing or re-experiencing piriformis syndrome.

Other suggestions from some researchers and physical therapists have included prevention strategies including warming up before physical activity, practising correct exercise form, stretching and doing strength training, though these are often suggested for helping treat or prevent any physical injury and are not piriformis-specific in their approach As with any type of exercise, it is thought that warmups will decrease the risk of injury during flexion or rotation of the hip. Stretching increases range of motion, while strengthening hip adductors and abductors theoretically allows the piriformis to tolerate trauma more readily.

==Treatment==
The initial treatments are often focused on avoiding/relieving pain such as activity modification (e.g. avoidance of activities that cause pain), heat/ice, NSAIDs, analgesics, muscle relaxants, and medications for neuropathic pain. Physical therapy, especially piriformis stretching, is often done concomitantly while treating pain. For patients who have failed physical therapy, injections into the piriformis muscle using some combination of anesthetic/steroids/botox may be considered. In refractory cases, surgery may be indicated where the sciatic nerve is dissected or the piriformis muscle/tendon is cut. 

Data on treatment outcomes is very limited. In a study of 42 patients with clinically suspected piriformis syndrome with normal MRI/CT imaging findings, 41 saw complete resolution of symptoms within 36 days. Of those 41 patients, 19 had spontaneous resolution of symptoms (46%), 13 improved with NSAIDs only (32%), and 9 improved with NSAIDs and physical therapy (22%). In a study of 14 patients, all (100%) saw improvement with physical therapy and/or injections. Of these patients, 9 (64%) improved with physical therapy alone. The remaining 5 (36%) improved with injections (steroids or ozone). However, 6 months after the end of treatment, only 5/14 patients (36%) had complete resolution of pain. In a study of 250 patients, medication and physical therapy led to complete pain relief in 51% of patients. Of those who did not see improvement with physical therapy, botox injections led to greater than 50% pain relief in 77% of patients. Of those who also did not see improvement with injections, surgery led to greater than 50% pain relief in 79% of patients. Some caution should be applied in interpreting these results as therapy is usually not compared to an untreated control group (patients sometimes get better on their own without treatment), and the diagnosis of piriformis syndrome isn&#x27;t validated (meaning different studies can select patients differently).

===Physical therapy===
Physical therapy for piriformis syndrome follows general rehabilitation principles for musculoskeletal conditions. The goals of physical therapy are to reduce piriformis muscle tightness, improve spine/hip/pelvis mobility, and restore normal biomechanics to the spine/hip/pelvis.

The rehabilitative protocol usually involves piriformis stretching, gluteal muscle massage (to massage the piriformis below it), lumbosacral stabilization (e.g. abdominal muscle exercises, spine stretching), hip strengthening/stretching, and the correction of biomechanical errors. Direct application of heat and ultrasound (which generates heat) and are often suggested before physical therapy. Heat will enhance muscle elasticity and blood flow, which helps with increase the efficacy of stretching. Piriformis stretching is meant to reduce muscle tightness and lengthen the muscle which may relieve pressure on the sciatic nerve. Massage is meant to break up trigger points, increase blood circulation, and lengthen the muscle fibers. Strengthening abdominal muscles (part of core stabilization) is to improve spine stability and to avoid compensatory tension on the hip and buttocks. Stretching the spine and hip muscles is meant to increase flexibility and range of motion. The purpose of correcting poor biomechanics in the hip/pelvis/spine is that they move in coordination, so a biomechanical error may have cascading effects.

In one study, the cure rate of physiotherapy for 250 piriformis syndrome patients was found to be approximately 50% after 3 months. However, this study did not use a control group for physiotherapy and so this may simply reflect the natural history of the syndrome. In other words, patients may often just get better on their own without any particular treatment. The exact benefits of physiotherapy for piriformis syndrome are unclear as well-designed, randomized trials are extremely limited. However, physiotherapy is safe and relatively inexpensive, so it is often recommended before more invasive and expensive treatments.

===Local injections===

Injections are part of multi-modal therapy and can be therapeutic. They may be used with conservative treatments like physical therapy or after the failure of conservative treatments. Injections deliver medication directly to the piriformis muscle through a needle. The needle is placed into the piriformis muscle with image guidance such as fluoroscopy, ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Ultrasound is a popular choice due to a balance of accuracy, accessibility, lack of radiation exposure, and affordability.

The medications injected are local anesthetics (e.g. lidocaine, bupivacaine), corticosteroids, and Botulinum toxin (Botox, BTX), which may be used together or in combination. Local anesthetic will temporarily paralyze a muscle in the hope that it breaks the cycle of chronic muscle spasm. The duration is in hours and consequently doesn&#x27;t lead to long lasting relief from the direct action of the anesthetic. Corticosteroids is used for its anti-inflammatory effects. The duration is unclear but somewhere between 1 week and 3 months. Botulinum Toxin will paralyze a muscle with a much longer duration than local anesthetics, up to 3 months. By paralyzing a muscle for so long the muscle will atrophy (shrink in size), reducing pressure on nearby structures such as the sciatic nerve. In addition to helping break the cycle of chronic muscle spasms, it reverses piriformis hypertrophy where the muscle is enlarged and presses on the sciatic nerve. Though the piriformis muscle becomes inactivated for months, the loss of piriformis muscle function does not cause any deficit in strength or gait as the surrounding muscles quickly take over its role.

Typically the combination of therapies is local anesthetics with corticosteroids (LA+CS), or Botulinum toxin (BTX). Both are more effective than placebo. Comparing local anesthetic with corticosteroids against Botulinum toxin is difficult because existing studies tend to lack controls which means that the effect of the treatment under observation is confounded with the natural history of the disease (patients with piriformis syndrome often see their symptoms resolve even without treatment). When comparative studies exist, Botulinum toxin is found to be more effective and local anesthetic with corticosteroids.

Injections may be more or less curative (with no return to pain), or may have limited timespans of effectiveness.

===Surgery===
Surgical intervention may be considered when conservative treatments fail. Surgery for piriformis syndrome involves resection of the piriformis tendon (or muscle) and a sciatic nerve decompression. This surgery can be done with open surgery or endoscopically. While there is no difference seen in outcomes between open and endoscopic surgery, the endoscopic approach has a lower complication rate and is significantly less invasive (open surgery can involve a 10 cm incision).

Piriformis syndrome surgery is still in the preliminary stages and so there are no randomized, prospective trials or cross-sectional studies. Existing evidence is largely retrospective studies and systematic reviews of those studies. Surgical outcomes are typically assessed by VAS scores (numerical pain scores) and various questionnaires (e.g. Oswestry Disability Index), potentially with a follow up of up to 2 years, however no validated outcome measure exists.

For surgery, results typically show that at least 80% of patients see improvement. When VAS scores (pain scores) are measured, patients typically have severe pain (&gt;7.5) before surgery and at most mild pain (&lt; 3.5) after surgery. A systematic review of deep gluteal syndrome (of which piriformis syndrome is a major cause) found consistently positive results for surgeries in the included studies.

Failure may in part be due to an incorrect diagnosis. Piriformis syndrome does not have well-validated diagnostic criteria and consequently some patients being treated for piriformis syndrome may have a different underlying condition with a similar symptom profile.

==Epidemiology==
Piriformis syndrome (PS) data is often confused with other conditions due to differences in definitions, survey methods and whether or not occupational groups or general population are surveyed. This causes a lack of group harmony about the diagnosis and treatment of PS, affecting its epidemiology. In a study, 0.33% of 1293 patients with low back pain cited an incident for PS. A separate study showed 6% of 750 patients with the same incidence. About 6–8% of low back pain occurrences were attributed to PS, though other reports concluded about 5–36%. In a survey conducted on the general population, 12.2–27% included a lifetime occurrence of PS, while 2.2–19.5% showed an annual occurrence. However further studies show that the proportion of the sciatica, in terms of PS, is about 0.1% in orthopaedic practice. This is more common in women with a ratio of 3 to 1 and most likely due to the wider quadriceps femoris muscle angle in the os coxae. Between the years of 1991–1994, self-selecting patients seeking piriformis syndrome treatment from a group of American physicians had the following distribution: 75% were in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania; 20% in other American urban centers; and 5% in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. The common ages of occurrence happen between thirty and forty, and are scarcely found in patients younger than twenty; this has been known to affect all lifestyles.

Piriformis syndrome is often left undiagnosed and mistaken with other pains due to similar symptoms with back pain, quadriceps pain, lower leg pain, and buttock pain. These symptoms include tenderness, tingling and numbness initiating in low back and buttock area and then radiating down to the thigh and to the leg.
A precise test for piriformis syndrome has not yet been developed and thus hard to diagnose this pain.
The pain is often initiated by sitting and walking for a longer period.
In 2012, one study found that 17.2% of low back pain patients met a clinical diagnosis for piriformis syndrome.
Piriformis syndrome does not occur in children, and is mostly seen in women of age between thirty and forty. This is due to hormone changes throughout their life, especially during pregnancy, where muscles around the pelvis, including piriformis muscles, tense up to stabilize the area for birth.
In 2011, out of 263 patients between the ages of 45 to 84 treated for piriformis syndrome, 53.3% were female. Females are two times more likely to develop piriformis syndrome than males. Moreover, females had longer stay in hospital during 2011 due to high prevalence of the pain in females. The average cost of treatment was $29,070 for hospitalizing average 4 days.
== History ==
The history of piriformis syndrome is interrelated to advances in understanding causes of sciatica. In 1933, the proposal of disc herniation as a cause of sciatica shifted attention to the spine. Although the concept of piriformis syndrome was conceptualized as early as 1928, the incompletely understood pathology and lack of clear diagnostic criteria made this syndrome highly controversial. Advancements in medical technology like anesthesia, antibiotics, electrophysiology, imaging, image-guided injections, and surgery have revived interest around piriformis syndrome. Recently, advances in endoscopic surgery led to discoveries suggesting a broader classification was necessary to describe all the causes of sciatic nerve entrapment in the deep gluteal space. This broader classification is now called deep gluteal syndrome, of which piriformis syndrome is one cause.

Today piriformis syndrome is in the same place herniated disk once were - there is a link between the pathophysiology and the symptoms (it&#x27;s clear why the most studied treatments work), but piriformis syndrome does not have a clear set of diagnostic criteria and a known prevalence. Controlled trials are unlikely to proceed without a sufficiently high prevalence and reliable diagnosis, however the prevalence cannot be determined without a reliable method of diagnosis.

<doc id="1104424" wikidata="Q1604780" url="?curid=1104424" title="Hemidesmosome">
<text>Hemidesmosomes are very small stud-like structures found in keratinocytes of the epidermis of skin that attach to the extracellular matrix. They are similar in form to desmosomes when visualized by electron microscopy; however, desmosomes attach to adjacent cells. Hemidesmosomes are also comparable to focal adhesions, as they both attach cells to the extracellular matrix. Instead of desmogleins and desmocollins in the extracellular space, hemidesmosomes utilize integrins. Hemidesmosomes are found in epithelial cells connecting the basal epithelial cells to the lamina lucida, which is part of the basal lamina. Hemidesmosomes are also involved in signaling pathways, such as keratinocyte migration or carcinoma cell intrusion.

== Structure ==
Hemidesmosomes can be categorized into two types based on their protein constituents. Type 1 hemidesmosomes are found in stratified and pseudo-stratified epithelium. Type 1 hemidesmosomes have five main elements: integrin α6β4, plectin in its isoform 1a, i. e. P1a, tetraspanin protein CD151, BPAG1e, or bullous pemphigoid antigen isoform e, and BPAG2 (also known as BP180 or type 17 collagen). Type 1 hemidesmosomes are found in stratified and pseudostratified epithelial tissue. Type 2 hemidesmosomes contain integrin α6β4 and plectin without the BP antigens.

Hemidesmosomes have two membrane-spanning components: Integrin α6β4 and BPAG2. Integrin α6β4 operates as a laminin-332 receptor. Integrin α6β4 is composed to two α and β subunit dimers. The larger β4 subunit has domains that bind to fibronectin III and calcium. The α6 subunit binds to extracellular BP180, CD151 and laminin-322. When integrin α6β4 binds to Plectin 1a and BPAG1, it associates with the keratin intermediate filaments in the cytoskeleton.

Hemidesmosomes are linked to keratin by plectin isoform 1a from the plakin protein family. Plectin is a 500 kDa protein with a long, rod-like domain and a domain at the end that contains an intermediate filament binding site. BPAG2, or (bullous pemphigoid antigen 2), is a transmembrane protein that exists adjacent to integrins, BPAG2 has domains that bind to plectin, integrin β4 subunit in the cytoplasm and integrin α6 and laminin-332 in the extracellular space. CD151, a protein of the tetraspanin superfamily, resides on the cell surface of keratinocytes and vascular endothelium. CD151 aids in hemidesmosome formation. BPAG1e is an antigen with multiple isoforms that binds to integrin α6β4, BPAG2 and keratin 5 and 14. The main role of BPAG1e is for hemidesmosome stability.

== Diseases ==
Keeping the basal epidermal keratinocytes attached to the basal lamina is vital for skin homeostasis. Genetic or acquired diseases that cause disruption of hemidesmosome components can lead to skin blistering disorders between different layers of the skin. These are collectively coined epidermolysis bullosa, or EB. Typical symptoms include fragile skin, blister development, and erosion from minor physical stress. However, the disease also can manifest as erosions on the cornea, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, esophagus, muscular dystrophy and muscular deformity.

Mutations in 12 different genes that code for parts of the hemidesmosome have led to epidermolysis bullosa. There are three types of EB: EB simplex (EBS), dystrophic EB (DEB) and junctional EB (JEB). In epidermolysis bullosa simplex, layers of the epidermis separate. EBS is caused by mutations coding for keratin, plectin and BPAG1e. With junctional epidermolysis bullosa, layers of the lamina lucida (part of the basal lamina) separate. This is caused by mutations in integrin α6β4, laminin 322 and BPAG2. In dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, the layers of the papillary dermis separate from the anchoring fibrils. This is caused by mutations in the collagen 7 gene.

<doc id="1104436" wikidata="Q5273392" url="?curid=1104436" title="Dick Smith Foods">
<text>Dick Smith Foods was a food brand created by Australian entrepreneur Dick Smith to provide Australian owned and produced alternatives to products from foreign-owned food companies. Generally, the brand focused on producing local alternatives to products with large market shares like Kraft peanut butter and Vegemite. However, Dick Smith Foods did not manufacture its own food products; instead, it sourced products from other Australian-owned companies, which licensed the Dick Smith Foods brand label. Dick Smith Foods also donated a portion of its profits to charitable causes.

On 26 July 2018, Dick Smith announced that the business would close in 2019, blaming competition from German supermarket Aldi.

==History==

Dick Smith Foods was formed in 1999 largely in response to the high market share of international companies such as Kraft, and the increasingly frequent take-over of previously Australian-owned companies including Arnott&#x27;s and Pauls. In particular, Smith was concerned that many companies which were no longer Australian owned still marketed their products as &quot;Australian&quot;: the iconic Australian breakfast spread Vegemite, for example, was owned by Kraft Foods.

In 2004, Smith announced his intention to make Dick Smith Foods a commercial operation, and to list it on the stock market by 2009. In the same year, Smith offered to purchase Vegemite from Kraft, but was unsuccessful. In 2006, the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; newspaper reported that Dick Smith Foods turnover had halved, due in part to the difficulty of finding local suppliers for their products.
In 2011, Smith announced that he would be taking control of the management of the company again, after turnover dropped from $80 million to $8 million over the previous five years. He implemented a vision for the return to Australian-owned, Australian-grown produce where all the profits stay in Australia, instead of heading offshore as they do with the majority of foreign-owned food suppliers. The company had previously been managed, and some of its products produced under licence, by the Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company, which paid Dick Smith Foods for the rights to the company&#x27;s branding.

On 26 July 2018, Dick Smith announced that the business would close in 2019 in order to avoid bankruptcy. Smith blamed competition with German supermarket Aldi&#x27;s products for the demise of the brand.

===Dickheads===

Dickheads were Dick Smith Foods&#x27; brand of matches (1999–2002). is a parody of the Redheads brand of matches, replacing &quot;Red&quot; with Dick Smith&#x27;s first name. The matchboxes were originally printed and made in North Richmond, New South Wales, Australia by Hanna Match, from local and imported materials. The brand&#x27;s graphic designer was Craig Gregory. Later, they were distributed by Steric Trading Pty Ltd in Villawood NSW. Although the matchsticks and matchheads were made overseas, local packaging allowed the product to be labelled &quot;Australian made&quot;. They were first sold in boxes of 25, &quot;DICKHEADS 25&quot;, then 22,&quot;DICKHEADS 22&quot; and finally 20 &quot;DICKHEADS 20&quot;.

The back of the box reads:
==Legal issues==
Dick Smith Foods ran into legal difficulties in 2003, when Arnott&#x27;s Biscuits took the company to court. The issue was a trademark dispute over Dick Smith Foods&#x27; &quot;Temptin&#x27;&quot; brand of chocolate biscuits, which Arnott&#x27;s alleged had diluted their trademark for their similar Tim Tam biscuits, in similarly designed packaging. The case was settled out of court with an agreement to modify package font, and Smith responded by casting Greg Arnott, a member of the Arnott family, in a commercial for the biscuits.

<doc id="1104442" wikidata="Q7766234" url="?curid=1104442" title="The Stanford Daily">
<text>The Stanford Daily is the student-run, independent daily newspaper serving Stanford University. &quot;The Daily&quot; is distributed throughout campus and the surrounding community of Palo Alto, California, United States. It has published since the university was founded in 1892.

The paper publishes weekdays during the academic year. &quot;The Daily&quot; also published several special issues every year: &quot;The Orientation Issue&quot;, &quot;Big Game Issue&quot;, and &quot;The Commencement Issue&quot;. In the fall of 2008, the paper&#x27;s offices relocated from the Storke Publications Building to the newly constructed Lorry I. Lokey Stanford Daily Building, near the recently renovated Old Student Union.

==History==
The paper began as a small student publication called &quot;The Daily Palo Alto&quot; serving the Palo Alto area and the university. It &quot;has been Stanford&#x27;s only news outlet operating continuously since the birth of the University.&quot;

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, as baby boomer college students increasingly questioned authority and asserted generational independence, and Stanford administrators became worried about liability for the paper&#x27;s editorials, the paper and the university severed ties. In 1973, students founded The Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation, a non-profit corporation, to operate the newspaper.

A significant event leading to the paper&#x27;s independence was the 1970 publication of an opinion piece entitled &quot;Snitches and Oppression.&quot; The author of the piece named two witnesses to the protests that led to his arrest and concluded &quot;take care of snitches.&quot; The university president, Richard Lyman, called the piece a &quot;journalistic atrocity&quot; and indicated concern that the university could be held liable for the content of the newspaper and its consequences. During the fall of 1970, the newspaper also announced an editorial policy of destroying unpublished photographs of demonstrations so they could not be used as evidence in court.

In April 1971, little more than a year thereafter, the newspaper&#x27;s policy led Palo Alto Chief of Police, James Zurcher, to initiate a search of the &quot;Daily&quot; offices. This occurred shortly after the occupation of a Stanford Hospital building had been broken up by police, some of whom were attacked and injured by the demonstrators. Believing that photographs of these assaults existed in &quot;Daily&quot; files, detectives spent hours searching the darkroom and staff members&#x27; desks.

The newspaper, aided by the noted constitutional expert Anthony Amsterdam, filed suit claiming a violation of the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution. &quot;Zurcher v. Stanford Daily&quot; went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled against the paper, holding that a state may issue a warrant to search and seize evidence from a third party who is not a criminal suspect (although &quot;particular exactitude&quot; must be exercised when First Amendment considerations are at play). This ruling caused the legislative branch to respond with the Privacy Protection Act of 1980, which increased protections for nonsuspect third parties in legal cases.

In 1991, a volunteer group of alumni incorporated The Friends of &quot;The Stanford Daily&quot; Foundation to provide support for the newspaper.

In 1982, after the Stanford football team officially lost the Big Game against cross-bay rival University of California at Berkeley (&quot;Cal&quot;) due to what has become known as &quot;The Play,&quot; &quot;The Daily&quot; published a fake edition of &quot;The Daily Californian&quot;, Cal&#x27;s student newspaper, announcing officials had reversed the game&#x27;s outcome. Styled as an &quot;extra,&quot; the bogus paper headlined &quot;NCAA AWARDS BIG GAME TO STANFORD&quot;. &quot;The Daily&quot; distributed 7,000 copies around the Berkeley campus early in the morning, before that day&#x27;s Cal student paper was released. The prank has been credited to four Stanford undergraduates: Tony Kelly, Mark Zeigler, Adam Berns and &quot;The Daily&quot;&#x27;s editor-in-chief at the time, Richard Klinger. To cover printing costs, &quot;The Daily&quot; made souvenir copies available on the Stanford campus for $1 apiece.

&quot;The Stanford Daily&quot;″s journalism has sometimes had far-reaching consequences; in the early 1990s a &quot;Daily&quot; staff member, John Wagner, &#x27;91, reported and published an investigative series uncovering significant corruption in the management of the Stanford Bookstore. According to Joanie Fischer&#x27;s 2003 article about the newspaper in &quot;Stanford Magazine&quot;, &quot;Managers of the independent nonprofit had formed a consulting firm that then leased a vacation home to the Bookstore and embezzled Bookstore funds to furnish it.&quot;

In October 2015, &quot;The Daily&quot; was criticized for failing to investigate misconduct at both the student and university level by Vanity Fair&#x27;s David Margolick who wrote &quot;&quot;The Stanford Daily&quot; has proved supine&quot; in a 7,000-word feature on the unfolding scandal at the Graduate School of Business. When GSB Dean Garth Saloner resigned suddenly on September 14, 2015, amid a wrongful termination suit, &quot;The Daily&quot; was scooped by &quot;Poets &amp; Quants&quot;, a blog that covers MBA programs around the world. The lawsuit was filed by a former professor married to fellow GSB professor Deborah H. Gruenfeld, with whom Saloner was having an affair. Though the scandal was covered extensively by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Bloomberg&quot;, and several international outlets, &quot;The Daily&quot; did not do additional reporting beyond its initial announcement of the dean&#x27;s resignation.

On April 28, 2016, &quot;The Daily&quot; reported on former Speaker of the House John Boehner&#x27;s likening of 2016 presidential candidate Ted Cruz to &quot;Lucifer in the flesh&quot; at a campus event. The report was picked up by numerous major outlets, including Politico and The New York Times.

=== Marc Tessier-Lavigne investigation and resignation ===
In November 2022, &quot;The Daily&quot; reported claims of image manipulation in academic publications on which Stanford University President Marc Tessier-Lavigne was a named author. The paper followed up on this reporting the following February with further allegations. Ultimately, Tessier-Levigne announced his resignation after an independent review stated, among other conclusions, that &quot;Dr. Tessier-Lavigne took insufficient steps to correct mistakes&quot;, and that he had &quot;overseen labs that had an &#x27;unusual frequency&#x27; of data manipulations.&quot;

<doc id="1104452" wikidata="Q2506778" url="?curid=1104452" title="Legacy Highway">
<text>The Legacy Highway is a proposed and partially completed freeway in northern Utah, United States, that is planned to eventually connect eastern Juab County (on the south) with eastern Box Elder County (on the north), running along the west sides of Utah, Salt Lake, Davis, and Weber counties in between. Its purpose is to provide an alternate north–south transportation corridor to Interstate 15. It was proposed in 1996, but due to lawsuits over issues with the completeness of the environmental impact statement construction was delayed. Construction of one segment began in 2006. That segment, known as the Legacy Parkway, opened on 13 September 2008.

==Concept==
The highway was proposed in 1996 by then-Utah Governor Michael O. Leavitt. Because of delays and the length of the freeway, it may be 2025 or later until construction on the entire portion is finished, although officials have stated that the complete proposal may, in fact, never be finished.

==Components==
===Legacy South===
From its inception the concept of the Legacy Highway has always included the idea of extending it south through the west side of Utah County to the Nephi area in Juab County. However, there are no proposals for routes south of the southern terminus of the Mountain View Corridor section at SR-73, except that it would have to follow a route somewhere west of Utah Lake.

===Mountain View Corridor===

Another portion of the Legacy Highway is the Mountain View Corridor, which is planned to span the entire length of western Salt Lake County and a few miles south into northwestern Utah County. Construction on this corridor began in 2010. As of June 2013, the frontage road portions of this section have been completed from Porter Rockwell Boulevard (at about 10600 South) north to 5400 South (SR-173) and from Redwood Road (SR-68) to I-15 in northern Lehi. The Mountain View Corridor section of the Legacy Highway is numerically designated as State Route 85.

Early on the Utah Legislature considered making this portion of the Legacy Highway a toll road so that it could be funded for construction sooner. However, while suggested as a possibility, the toll road concept was never adopted.

===Legacy Parkway===

The first portion built was the Legacy Parkway, or South Davis Segment, which runs from Farmington to North Salt Lake. Construction on the Legacy Parkway began in 2004 after many delays. The interchange with Interstate 15 and US-89 was mostly completed before the highway was delayed again as a result of lawsuits over the completeness of the environmental impact statement. Construction began again in 2006 and was completed in September 2008. The Legacy Parkway section of the Legacy Highway is numerically designated as State Route 67.

===Legacy North===
Legacy North is planned to run north from US-89/I-15 in Farmington through the west side of northern Davis County and continue north through the west side of Weber County. The Utah Department of Transportation is working on the optimal route for this section of the Legacy Highway. UDOT has opted to refer the southern portion of this section as the West Davis Corridor. In 2013, UDOT accepted hundreds of proposals from community members on the proposed routing of the freeway, and has stated that they will consider all options, including not building the freeway at all, a stance which is supported by some community and environmental groups who argue that it will destroy sensitive wetlands and prime farmland. The proposed routing is expected to cost $587 million, although funding has not yet been secured. The first portion of the route is not expected to be built until around 2020.

<doc id="1104459" wikidata="Q7749859" url="?curid=1104459" title="The Man Born to Be King">
<text>The Man Born to Be King is a radio drama based on the life of Jesus, produced and broadcast by the BBC during the Second World War. It is a play cycle consisting of twelve plays depicting specific periods in Jesus&#x27; life, from the events surrounding his birth to his death and resurrection. It was first broadcast by the BBC Home Service on Sunday evenings, beginning on 21 December 1941, with new episodes broadcast at 4-week intervals, ending on 18 October 1942. The series was written by novelist and dramatist Dorothy L. Sayers, and produced by Val Gielgud, with Robert Speaight as Jesus.

The twelve plays in the cycle are:
#&quot;Kings in Judea&quot;
#&quot;The King&#x27;s Herald&quot;
#&quot;A Certain Nobleman&quot;
#&quot;The Heirs to the Kingdom&quot;
#&quot;The Bread of Heaven&quot;
#&quot;The Feast of Tabernacles&quot;
#&quot;The Light and the Life&quot;
#&quot;Royal Progress&quot;
#&quot;The King&#x27;s Supper&quot;
#&quot;The Princes of This World&quot;
#&quot;King of Sorrows&quot;
#&quot;The King Comes to His Own&quot;

The project aroused a storm of controversy, even before it was broadcast. Objections arose to the very idea—atheists complained of Christian propaganda, while devout Christians declared that the BBC would be committing blasphemy by allowing the Christ to be impersonated by a human actor—and also to Sayers&#x27; approach to the material. Sayers, who felt that the inherent drama of the Gospel story had become muffled by familiarity and a general failure to think of its characters as real people, was determined to give the plays dramatic immediacy, featuring realistic, identifiable characters with human emotions, motivations, and speech-patterns. The decision to have the characters speak in contemporary colloquial English was, by itself, the cause of much disquiet among those more accustomed to Jesus and his followers using the polished and formal words of the King James Bible.

In the event, although it continued to be criticised by conservative Christians—one group going so far as to proclaim the Fall of Singapore in February 1942 to be a sign of God&#x27;s displeasure with the series—&quot;The Man Born to Be King&quot; was generally considered a great success, both as drama and as biblical representation. The public reaction to the series is described by J. W. Welch, the Director of Religious Broadcasting B.B.C., in his foreword to the play scripts. These were first published in 1943, with Sayers&#x27; lengthy introduction, illuminating her attitude to the work and the reasoning behind particular aspects of her dramatisation, and with notes and commentary by the author on each of the twelve plays. The book of the scripts was published in its 22nd impression in 1957, and subsequently.

==Other versions==
In April 1944 Episodes 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 were repeated as a Crucifixion/Resurrection sequence for Easter Week. Again Gielgud produced and Speaight was Jesus, but they were done afresh - for instance, Deryck Guyler played the disciple Andrew which he had not before.
Four other full versions were made by the BBC:
# Directed by Noel Iliff 1947–48, with Raf de la Torre as Jesus
# Directed by Peter Watts 23 December 1951, with Deryck Guyler as Jesus
# Directed by William Glen-Doepel 17 February 1965, with Tom Fleming as Jesus
# Directed by Raymond Raikes World Service 1967, first aired domestically 19 January 1975

The last version was the first in stereo. It starred John Westbrook as Jesus, Gabriel Woolf, Denys Blakelock, Denise Bryer, Trevor Martin, Norman Shelley and Robert Eddison. This version was repeated from 6–21 December 2007 on BBC 7, after Christmas in 2008–2009 and from 18 April – 3 May 2011 on BBC7&#x27;s replacement, BBC Radio 4 Extra.

The Raymond Raikes production reduced the episodes from one hour to forty-five minutes, and condensed the casts in various ways—for instance by making The Evangelist, the narrator figure, the same voice as John the disciple (an identification strongly supported by the text of the fifth play).

Heron Carvic, originally suggested by the writer, played Caiaphas in every version of the cycle (as well as in the broadcast of Sayers&#x27; Lichfield Passion &quot;The Just Vengeance&quot; in 1947). Alan Wheatley played Judas in all but the 1965 production. Similarly John Laurie played his original parts of Gestas in four of the productions, and John the Baptist in three. Many other castings overlapped — Raf de la Torre, a regular in Sayers&#x27; religious plays, was Jesus in the first full revival, and then had small parts in both of the 1960s productions.

No copies of the original version are held by the BBC, although recordings do exist elsewhere—only &quot;King of Sorrows&quot; from the original broadcast is completely missing. The 1951/2 version is held on vinyl at the British Library.

<text>KNHC (89.5 FM) is a Class C1 high school radio station based in Seattle, Washington. It is the world&#x27;s oldest, still remaining, dance music station.

C89.5 offers a hybrid of current-based EDM product and Rhythmic Top 40 remixes, as well as new dance songs that are potential future hits – all of which are presented in a Top 40-like direction.

It is one of six stations monitored by Nielsen BDS for inclusion in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s weekly Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart. Its best coverage is in the Seattle metro area.

The C in C89.5 stands for Communications.

KNHC broadcasts in the HD Radio format.

==Operations and funding==
KNHC is owned by Seattle Public Schools and is operated by professional staff who provide training to students of Nathan Hale High School in north Seattle, as an electronic media course. Staff supervise students as they perform production, programming, music selection, copy writing, and on-air hosting. Some regular programs are hosted by alumni or non-student volunteers.

The station usually plays general electronic dance music during the day, with a number of specialty, genre-specific shows playing anything from house to industrial and trance after 6 pm. Its in-house live programming includes a four-hour weekday breakfast show, the 15-minute lunchtime mini-mix &quot;8-Bit Work Break&quot;, the drive show &quot;Drive @ 5&quot;, and the new music show &quot;Test Spin&quot;.

Since around 2002, Seattle Public Schools has excluded funding for the station from its annual budget, except for a portion of the salaries and benefits for two staff. In 2019, that amounted to about 12% of the annual operating budget.

In 2015, the station became qualified to receive a Community Service Grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

The remaining operational budget of the station is raised via fund raising efforts, primarily from bi-annual pledge drives and corporate support announcements known as underwriting. As a non-commercial educational station, they cannot air traditional commercial advertisements.

==Broadcast coverage and online content==

The station has one of the widest over-the-air coverage areas for what can be considered a high school radio station. Its signal is broadcast from Entercom&#x27;s backup tower on Cougar Mountain, and covers an area from north of Seattle to roughly halfway into Tacoma, Washington and across the Puget Sound. The signal can be received as far east as Snoqualmie Pass and as far north as Victoria, British Columbia. It is licensed to Seattle. C89.5 attracts as many as 200,000 broadcast listeners per week.

The station also provides multiple live streams from its website, currently operating 32 kbit/s and 128 kbit/s MP3 streams as well as an Ogg stream, which can be received throughout the world via the Internet. C89.5 unveiled a major redesign of its website in March 25, 2018. Other upgrades include a real-time playlist and searchable database of the music that is heard on C89.5.

==History==

KNHC went on the air as a very low power AM station, broadcasting with 100 milliwatts on 1210 kHz, in December 1969. Fairly quickly, however, the high school moved to build an FM station. In September 1970, KNHC received its FM construction permit and went on the air in January 1971. The transmitter was located at Wedgwood Elementary School, and the station broadcast with 10 watts, covering about a 5-mile circle in the north end of Seattle.

In September 1972, the station increased its power to 320 watts, and three months later, stereo broadcasts began. A second power increase, in November 1974, increased the ERP to 1,500 watts directional.

In December 1977, a HEW/NTIA grant created a sister studio at Cleveland High School on Beacon Hill. At the same time, the Mass Communications magnet school program at Hale begins, including courses in radio, television, journalism, photography, and graphic arts. Hence the station&#x27;s call letters K - (U.S. broadcast stations west of the Mississippi), NH - (Nathan Hale H.S.) and C - (Cleveland H.S.).

KNHC&#x27;s format entering the 1980s featured light rock and pop music, with specialty shows in the evenings and on weekends, including jazz and classical. After yet another power increase to 3 kW, this time non-directional, in October 1981, the station overhauled its format the next year to R&amp;B and urban, prompting an increase in listenership. The &quot;C89&quot; name entered use in 1983. New technologies were also deployed; in 1984, a satellite dish was added to receive the urban-oriented Sheridan Broadcasting Networks (an antecedent to today&#x27;s American Urban Radio Networks), and in 1987, a microwave studio-transmitter link was brought into use along with a new and more efficient antenna.

One of the primary challenges in the 1980s was an application filed in December 1983 by the Jack Straw Memorial Foundation and its station, KRAB (now KNDD), to share time with KNHC. The commercial station, which had been facing financial difficulties, set up a noncommercial foundation with the goal of broadcasting in the reserved band between 88 and 92 MHz; Seattle Public Schools saw the filing as a takeover attempt. The case was designated for hearing in 1986, and the courts found in Nathan Hale High School&#x27;s favor in May 1988 and again after Jack Straw appealed. Ultimately, the foundation built a noncommercial station in Everett, KSER 90.7.

In 1988, KNHC filed to increase its power to 30 kW, an increase that was put to use for the first time in 1991. The early 1990s also brought a magnet grant to bolster the high school&#x27;s mass communications program and a renovation to the radio facility that added a second production studio, engineering room, and offices.

In 1995, the station began converting to a digital workflow (a process completed in 2000 with the use of MiniDisc-based equipment), and in 1997, KNHC began streaming on the Internet. The mid-1990s also saw the formation of an articulation agreement with Boise State University to give KNHC students opportunities to further their education.

KNHC&#x27;s transmitter was moved to Cougar Mountain in 2002 after receiving FCC approval the year before. While the effective radiated power dropped, the coverage area was vastly improved with the move to the mountaintop site, primarily to the north of Seattle. The expanded reach of the station and its online stream prompted several distinctions in the decade: across the country, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; named KNHC best high school radio station in its &quot;Best of New York&quot; list in 2003, and in 2004, the station became the first non-commercial station in the United States to be a monitored reporter when they joined the Billboard Magazine Dance Radio Airplay panel. Additional technical and facilities improvements, came in 2008, when KNHC installed a new transmitter on Cougar Mountain and began broadcasting in HD Radio, and in November 2009, when it moved into brand-new digital studios and classrooms at Nathan Hale.

<text>&quot;Rosa&quot; &#x27;Alain&#x27; is a red Floribunda rose variety, bred by Francis Meilland before 1946. Meilland International introduced the rose in France in 1948. It was named for Meilland&#x27;s son, Alain, who was born in 1940. It won the Geneva Gold Medal in 1948.

==Description==
&#x27;Alain&#x27; is a bushy, upright hybrid tea rose, in height, with a spread. Bloom size is . It has a semi-double (17-25 petals) bloom form.. The flowers are bright red and open relatively flat, which exposes the bright yellow stamens to view. Blooms occur in open clusters, up to as many as nine, and bloom repeatedly throughout the season.

==History==
===Meilland International===
The Meilland family is a multi-generational family of French rose breeders. The family&#x27;s first rosarian was gardener, Joseph Rambaux, who first started breeding roses in 1850 in Lyon. He is best known for developing the Polyantha &#x27;Perle d&#x27;Or&#x27;. His wife, Claudine and son-in-law, Francois Dubreuil, took over the nursery after Rambaux died in 1878. Dubreuil became a successful rose breeder and grower. In 1900, Dubreuil hired sixteen year old, Antoine Meilland, as a gardening assistant, where he met Dubreuil&#x27;s daughter, Claudia. Antoine and Claudia married in 1909 and their son, Francis was born in 1912. The couple took over Dubreuil&#x27;s nursery after his death in 1916.

After World War I, Antoine and Claudia bought property in Tassin-la-Demi-Lune, near Lyon and started a new nursery. Their son, Francis, married Marie-Louise (Louisette) Paolino, daughter of an Italian rose breeder in 1939. Francis expanded the rose business over time into a large, international company, and became the most famous and prolific rose breeder in the family. His legendary &#x27;Peace&#x27; rose, brought the family international attention and great commercial success when it was introduced after World War II. The Meilland family merged their business with Francisque Richardier in 1946, so that Francis Meilland could focus solely on breeding roses. After Francis&#x27;s early death in 1958, Louisette continued to breed roses, introducing many awarding winning new varieties. The new company, Meilland-Richardier grew into Meilland International (AKA House of Meilland), and is located in Le Luc en Provence, France. Francis and Louisette&#x27;s children, Alain and Michele, are both successful rose breeders for the company. Meilland International continues to be 100% family owned and managed.

===&#x27;Alain&#x27;===
&#x27;Alain&#x27; was developed by Francis Meilland, a French rose breeder from the prominent Meilland family. The rose was introduced in 1948, and named for the breeder&#x27;s son, Alain Meilland, who was born in 1940. &#x27;Alain&#x27; was developed from a cross of &#x27;Guinée&#x27; and&#x27;Wilhelm&#x27;, in turn crossed with&#x27;Orange Triumph&#x27;. &#x27;Alain&#x27; was selected as &quot;Most Beautiful French Rose&quot; (&quot;Plus Belle Rose de France&quot;) at the Lyon Rose Trials in 1946. In 1948 another gold medal was won at the Geneva Rose Trials. The climbing sport of &#x27;Alain&#x27;, &#x27;Climbing Alain&#x27; was introduced in 1957.

<doc id="1104478" wikidata="Q2465304" url="?curid=1104478" title="Square foot gardening">
<text>Square foot gardening is the practice of dividing the growing area into small square sections. The aim is to assist the planning and creating of a small but intensively planted vegetable garden. It results in a simple and orderly gardening system, from which it draws much of its appeal. Mel Bartholomew coined the term &quot;square foot gardening&quot; in his 1981 book of the same name.

== Description ==


The phrase &quot;square foot gardening&quot; was popularized by Mel Bartholomew in a 1981 Rodale, Inc. book and subsequent PBS television series. Bartholomew, a retired engineer, devised the system.

The square foot gardening method recommends using an open-bottom raised bed, square. The square beds are then divided into a grid of sixteen one-foot squares. Each square is planted with a different crop, and based on the plant&#x27;s mature size either 1, 4, 9 or 16 plants are placed per square. Although beds can be longer than four feet, it is recommended for the width of the bed to be no more than four feet because an adult arm can usually reach 2 feet—the distance from the edge to the center of the bed.

Once a &quot;square foot&quot; is harvested, a different crop can be planted. To encourage a variety of different crops in succession, and to discourage pests, each square is used for a different kind of plant (crop rotation) within the growing season. The number of plants per square depends on an individual plant&#x27;s size. For example, a single tomato plant takes a full square, as might large herbs such as oregano or basil, while lettuce plants would be planted 4 per square, and up to 16 per square of plants such as radish or carrots. Tall-growing crops are planted or trellised on the north side of the bed (in the Northern Hemisphere) to avoid shading shorter plants.

One advantage of densely planted crops is that they can form a living mulch and can also prevent weeds from establishing or even germinating. A variety of crops in a small space also prevents plant diseases from spreading easily.

Since the beds are typically small, making covers or cages to protect plants from pests, cold, wind or too much sun is more practical than with larger gardens. To extend the growing season of a square foot garden, a cold frame may be built around it, and by facing the frame towards the equator, the square foot garden captures more light and heat during colder months of the year.

No specific soil is required although it is recommended to add compost to garden soil. In 2006, Bartholemew began advocating the use of &quot;Mel&#x27;s Mix&quot;, which he described as 1/3 peat moss or coconut coir, 1/3 vermiculite, and 1/3 compost which he claimed yields good results even at only depth.

<doc id="1104490" wikidata="Q201385" url="?curid=1104490" title="Gulf of Naples">
<text>The Gulf of Naples (), also called the Bay of Naples, is a roughly 15-kilometer-wide (9.3 mi) gulf located along the south-western coast of Italy (Metropolitan City of Naples, Campania region). It opens to the west into the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered on the north by the cities of Naples and Pozzuoli, on the east by Mount Vesuvius, and on the south by the Sorrento Peninsula and the main town of the peninsula, Sorrento. The Peninsula separates the Gulf of Naples from the Gulf of Salerno, which includes the Amalfi Coast.

The islands of Capri, Ischia and Procida are located in the Gulf of Naples. The area is a tourist destination, with the seaside Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum at the foot of Mount Vesuvius (destroyed in the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius), along the north coast.

Along with the island of Ischia and gulfs of Pozzuoli and Gaeta, local waters are home to varieties of whales and dolphins including fin and sperm whales.

== History ==
It is said that the Roman emperor Caligula built a bridge of boats across the bay and rode across it in a chariot while wearing the armor of Alexander the Great.

The Gulf of Naples hosted the sailing events for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.

<text>The Dead Sea sparrow (Passer moabiticus) is a species of bird in the Old World sparrow family Passeridae, with one subspecies breeding in parts of the Middle East and another in western Afghanistan and eastern Iran. The eastern subspecies &quot;P. m. yatii&quot; is sometimes considered a separate species known as Yate&#x27;s sparrow.

== Description ==
At long it is one of the smaller species of its family, some shorter than the widespread house sparrow. Like most of its relatives, it is sexually dimorphic with males being more brightly and distinctively marked than females.

The male Dead Sea sparrow has a grey crown, rear neck and cheeks, and a small black bib. It has a pale supercilium shading to buff at the rear, and yellow neck sides. The upperparts are dark-streaked reddish brown, and the underparts are grey-white.

The female looks like a small house sparrow, with a streaked brown back, greyish head and buff-white underparts. She is paler and smaller billed than the house sparrow, and sometimes shows yellow on the neck sides.

The eastern subspecies &quot;P. m. yatii&quot; is sandier, and the male has a yellow wash to the underparts.

The chirping song resembles those of house and Spanish sparrows, but is softer. The flight call is a high-pitched &quot;chi-wit&quot;. This species is often silent.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The range of this species is spotty in the Middle East, largely in corridors along the Jordan River and the Euphrates River, ranging from southern Turkey and Cyprus to the southwestern corner of Iran. The subspecies &quot;P. m. yatii&quot; breeds only in the Sistan region of southwestern Afghanistan and eastern Iran. While the species was initially recorded by scientists breeding only in a restricted range by the Dead Sea, hence the species&#x27; name, more populations were discovered further east and it expanded its known range over the second half of the 20th century. The species was first recorded on the island of Cyprus in 1973 and bred a few years later. Though changes to habitat reduced the size of this population soon after it is thought small numbers still breed in Cyprus. This species is migratory or dispersive away from its breeding season. The eastern subspecies winters in western Pakistan, but the regular wintering grounds of the western subspecies are largely unknown. Winter searches for the species near its western breeding range only find scattered flocks. It is possible they disperse widely in winter, as flocks have been found in winter further south and east than where they breed, including in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

Genetic analysis of birds in Israel revealed high connectivity among different populations indicating migration of individuals between these populations. However, despite this gene flow there is latitudinal variation in wing length and body mass, with individuals in the north of Israel having longer wings and being heavier than those in the south suggesting local adaption in accordance with Bergmann&#x27;s rule.

== Behaviour ==
This species feeds principally on seeds, like other sparrows. It breeds in dry lowlands with some shrubs, including tamarisk, and access to water. It builds a nest in a tree, and four to seven eggs are laid.

<doc id="1104500" wikidata="Q6143092" url="?curid=1104500" title="USS Tinosa (SS-283)">
<text>USS &quot;Tinosa&quot; (SS-283), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tinosa.

==Construction==

The &quot;Tinosa&quot; was laid down on 21 February 1942 at Vallejo, California, by the Mare Island Navy Yard; launched on 7 October 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Katharine Shanks Malloy, wife of Captain William E. Malloy; and commissioned on 15 January 1943, Lt. Comdr. Lawrence Randall Daspit in command.

==Operations during World War II==
After preliminary operations, the submarine proceeded to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 16 April 1943. Over the next two years, she completed twelve war patrols in the Pacific and was credited with sinking 16 enemy ships, totaling 64,655 tons.

=== First and second patrols, May–August 1943 ===

On her first war patrol, conducted from 3 May to 19 June 1943, &quot;Tinosa&quot; damaged three enemy ships in the waters east of Kyūshū, Japan, while sustaining some depth-charge damage herself.

After refitting at Midway, she got underway on 7 July to patrol the sea routes between Borneo and Truk. On 24 July 1943, &quot;Tinosa&quot; encountered the cargo ship &quot;Tonan Maru No. 3&quot;, the largest tanker of the Japanese fleet, 19,262 tons, sailing from Palau to Truk. Codebreaker warning had put Tinosa in a perfect position to shoot the tanker with a spread of four torpedoes. None exploded. The boat&#x27;s commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander L. R. (Dan) Daspit recorded in his log, &quot;Target had been carefully tracked and with spread used [torpedoes] could not have run properly and missed.&quot;

&quot;Tinosa&quot; made herself a second chance by chasing throughout the following day. Daspit also checked the torpedoes he had left and insured that the magnetic influence exploders had been disabled (see below for why). Even so, the first two torpedoes of the second attack had to be shot at an awkward angle and range. They hit and exploded disabling &quot;Tonan Maru&quot;&#x27;s engines. With the target dead in the water &quot;Tinosa&quot; was in an ideal firing position, moving in to fire on the tanker at the submarine equivalent of point blank range. The torpedo appeared to hit its target but did not explode. Daspit and crew continued to fire torpedoes one at a time at the tanker. All of them hit, but none exploded. Daspit&#x27;s log gives time of firing of each and states over and over again &quot;fired [nth] torpedo. Hit. No apparent effect.&quot; Daspit recorded about the sixth one since &quot;Tonan Maru&quot; had become a &quot;sitting duck&quot;, &quot;... Hit. No apparent effect. This torpedo hit well aft on the port side, made splash at the side of the ship and was then observed to have taken a right turn and to jump clear of the water about from the stern of the tanker. I find it hard to convince myself that I saw this.&quot;

He took his sub to the other side of the target and fired the eighth and ninth torpedoes even as he saw a destroyer approaching from the east. As &quot;Tinosa&quot; went deep they heard the last torpedo hit and stop running. Daspit recorded in his log, &quot;No explosion. Had already decided to retain one torpedo for examination by base.&quot; After shooting nine torpedoes at a sitting duck over almost an hour and a half 1009 to 1131, and taking time out to examine the fish in the torpedo room between shots, Lieutenant Commander Daspit took &quot;Tinosa&quot; back to Pearl Harbor with the single remaining weapon.

Daspit stormed into SUBPAC&#x27;s office. He had shot 15 torpedoes at &quot;Tonan Maru&quot; over two days and only 2 of them had worked. The others shot under ideal conditions failed to explode. Rear Admiral Lockwood, COMSUBPAC wrote: &quot;I expected a torrent of cusswords, damning me, the Bureau of Ordnance, the Newport Torpedo Station and the Base Torpedo Shop, and I couldn’t have blamed him – 19,000 ton tankers don’t grow on trees. I think Dan was so furious as to be practically speechless. His tale was almost unbelievable, but the evidence was undeniable.&quot; When, upon inspection, nothing obvious was found wrong with that last torpedo, Commander Swede Momsen suggested conducting tests on actual warshots by firing them against the cliffs of Kahoolawe, a small island south of Maui from the submarine USS Muskallunge. The first two exploded. The third one did not. Within a few days the cause was traced to a firing pin that was mounted athwart-ships such that when the torpedo hit a target dead-on (ninety degree track angle) the deceleration forces slowed the pin&#x27;s motion in its bearings and its spring could not move it fast enough to set off the explosive train. A glancing blow, however, would result in the proper behavior (which is why Daspit&#x27;s first two torpedoes, fired at less optimum track angle, did explode).

Two solutions were worked on. One involved recycling a very light metal alloy that had been melted down from the engine of a Japanese airplane that had crashed on Oahu during the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Both solutions were installed into torpedoes and the submarine force had a mostly reliable weapon 21 months after the war started.

This was the third strike for the Mark 14 torpedo. It started with the USS &quot;Sargo&quot; missing 13 of 13 easy shots in December 1941. Finally in June 1942, Admiral Lockwood, the Commander of Submarines South West Pacific (COMSUBSOWESPAC), arranged to have torpedoes – with special non-exploding warheads (but unlike the exercise heads of that time and later they were filled to make them just as heavy as the actually explosive-filled warheads) – shot at fishnets. They were set to run at . away they went through the nets at depth. The Bureau of Ordnance (BUORD) wouldn&#x27;t accept this until they were forced to face the facts and conduct their own experiment. They confirmed Lockwood&#x27;s experiments on 1 August.

But that was not the end. In April 1943 BUORD admitted that the magnetic influence exploder was susceptible to premature explosions. Even then it wasn&#x27;t until 24 July when Admiral Nimitz ordered that the influence exploders be disabled on all Pacific Fleet submarines. This did not apply, however, to COMSUBSOWESPAC. Admiral Christie then in command had been the officer in charge of testing the super secret influence exploder in the 1930s and he just could not give up on the concept and he ordered that his boats continue to use the defective magnetic exploder.

This set the stage for Dan Daspit, USS &quot;Tinosa&quot; and the &quot;Tonan Maru&quot; to show that the contact exploder was defective as well, as described above.

=== Third patrol, September–October 1943 ===

&quot;Tinosa&quot; next departed Pearl Harbor on 23 September. Near the Carolines on 6 October, &quot;Tinosa&quot; sighted a lone tanker. In a midday torpedo attack, she damaged the ship; then dove to . Four depth charges exploded nearby, springing open lockers and knocking men off their feet in the aft torpedo room. Moments later, a fire broke out in the motor room but was brought under control. Throughout the afternoon, &quot;Tinosa&quot; and continued to harass the tanker until evening, when their target went down.

At sunset on 6 October, &quot;Tinosa&quot; bombarded a radio station on Alet Island, near Truk. She ended the patrol at Midway on 16 October.

=== Fourth patrol, October–December 1943 ===

Departing Midway on 27 October, &quot;Tinosa&quot; headed for the Palau-Truk sea lanes. On 22 November, she sighted two cargo ships and two small escort craft steaming in convoy. The submarine fired six torpedoes, scoring hits on both cargo ships. The entire action took only five minutes and left her between two mortally stricken ships, her position clearly marked by torpedo wakes leading out ahead and astern—a perfect fix for the enemy escorts. Amid the sounds of the cargo vessels breaking up, &quot;Tinosa&quot; dove deep to avoid the certain counter-attack of the escort vessels. A short time later, four depth charges exploded close by the submarine, knocking out her planes, gyro, steering, internal communications, and other equipment. She made a wild climb to , then dove to , before her crew regained control. &quot;Tinosa&quot; then resumed evasive tactics which enabled her to elude the remnants of the convoy late in the afternoon.

During an attack on a convoy on 26 November, &quot;Tinosa&quot; sank Japanese cargo ship &quot;Shini Maru&quot; and then dodged 34 depth charges, none of which caused her any damage. She emerged from this encounter with a torpedo stuck in her number 5 tube but managed to remedy the problem and headed for the Molucca Passage-Palau traffic lanes.

On 3 December, she sighted a large passenger-cargo vessel, the &quot;Azuma Maru&quot;, protected by a single escort. At 18:20, &quot;Tinosa&quot; launched a torpedo attack, damaging the Japanese ship. At 21:01 while maneuvering on the surface as she sought to finish off the &quot;Azuma Maru&quot;, &quot;Tinosa&quot; came under fire from the burning vessel; and, minutes later, she narrowly avoided being rammed by the crippled enemy ship which circled out of control because of a damaged rudder. At 21:20, &quot;Tinosa&quot; fired three more torpedoes, and the &quot;Azuma Maru&quot; sank. She concluded this patrol at Fremantle, Australia, on 16 December 1943.

=== Fifth patrol, January–March 1944 ===

After sailing on 10 January 1944 for the South China Sea, &quot;Tinosa&quot; landed an intelligence team and its supplies at Labian Point, North Borneo, under cover of darkness on 20 January, before proceeding to the Flores Sea. Two days later, she sank &quot;Koshin Maru&quot; and &quot;Seinan Maru&quot; and damaged a third ship in a running attack on a convoy off Viper Shoal. In another action on the night of 15 February – 16 February, &quot;Tinosa&quot; drew gunfire from the ships of a convoy as she torpedoed and sank &quot;Odatsuki Maru&quot; and &quot;Chojo Maru&quot;. She ended her fifth patrol at Pearl Harbor on 4 March 1944.

=== Sixth patrol, March–May 1944 ===

In company with and , &quot;Tinosa&quot; got underway for the East China Sea and her sixth patrol on 29 March. Operating off Japan and the Ryukyus, this wolf pack preyed successfully on passing convoys by stationing units along well-traveled routes. The submarines made six major attacks on this patrol. &quot;Tinosa&quot; herself sank two Japanese cargo ships, &quot;Taibu Maru&quot; and &quot;Toyohi Maru&quot;, in a night attack on 4 May. On this patrol, she also sank a trawler with her gun on 9 May and claimed to have damaged three other vessels. The submarine arrived at Majuro on 15 May.

=== Seventh patrol, June–August 1944 ===

After refitting, &quot;Tinosa&quot; departed the Marshalls on 7 June, bound for the East China Sea. On 18 June, she resorted to unusual tactics in attacking a three-masted 400-ton fishing sampan which had withstood her gunfire. &quot;Tinosa&quot; closed the enemy vessel, doused her with fuel oil, and set her ablaze by tossing flaming, oil-soaked rags on her deck. Shortly after dawn on 2 July, Japanese planes and patrol vessels forced &quot;Tinosa&quot; to go deep near Nagasaki and kept her down until dusk. The following day, the submarine sank two passenger-cargo ships in an attack on a convoy, adding &quot;Konsan Maru&quot; and &quot;Kamo Maru&quot; to her list of kills. Following this patrol, &quot;Tinosa&quot; reported to Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 7 August, for a much needed overhaul.

=== Eighth and ninth patrols, November 1944 – April 1945 ===

&quot;Tinosa&quot; departed San Diego on 7 November 1944 and proceeded, via Pearl Harbor, to Nansei Shoto to reconnoiter its waters and to test new FM sonar equipment in locating Japanese mines. After 58 days at sea, &quot;Tinosa&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor.

On 17 March 1945, &quot;Tinosa&quot; got underway from Tanapag Harbor in the Marshalls. Despite unexplained damage in her bow-plane rigging gear, &quot;Tinosa&quot; proceeded to the Nansei Shoto area and resumed testing the mine-detecting capabilities of her temperamental FM sonar. She also observed Japanese shipping and took reconnaissance photographs before ending the patrol at Apra Harbor, Guam, on 7 April.

=== Tenth patrol, April–May 1945 ===

On 28 April, &quot;Tinosa&quot; headed for Truk. Her FM sonar equipment—which she had received while at Guam—improved her sonar range, and she gathered data on sonar performance throughout the voyage. On 3 May, she narrowly escaped damage from bombs dropped by an enemy airplane off Moen Island.

Although there was no opportunity to attack enemy shipping during this patrol, &quot;Tinosa&quot; bombarded a Japanese installation on Ulul Island on the night of 14 May. She also made numerous photographs which she turned over to intelligence officers upon her arrival at Guam on 16 May.

=== Eleventh and twelfth patrols, May–August 1945 ===

&quot;Tinosa&quot; got underway for the Sea of Japan on 29 May. En route, she rescued 10 survivors of a ditched B-29. Acting on this special mission as a member of a wolf pack selected to initiate Operation Barney, an incursion into the Sea of Japan, &quot;Tinosa&quot; accomplished the dangerous task of plotting mines in Tsushima Strait on 6 June. This patrol is dramatized in the 1950&#x27;s TV series, The Silent Service, produced by Universal Television and hosted by RADM Thomas M Dykers, USN (Ret).

Following the completion of this special mission, &quot;Tinosa&quot; made six aggressive torpedo attacks, sank three cargo ships, and—during the daylight hours of 12 June—launched a brilliant surface battle against the &quot;Keito Maru&quot;, a Japanese sea truck. Having sunk four Japanese vessels and damaged a fifth, she completed her 11th patrol arriving at Pearl Harbor on 4 July.

After refitting, &quot;Tinosa&quot; set course for her 12th patrol on 11 August. Before she reached her assigned area this patrol was terminated by Japan&#x27;s capitulation. On 26 August 1945, she departed Midway for an overhaul at San Francisco. After operating off the West Coast from January to June 1946, she was placed in reserve. In January 1947, &quot;Tinosa&quot; was placed out of commission.

== Second period in commission, 1952–53 ==

The Korean War precipitated her recommissioning in January 1952. However, she was decommissioned on 2 December 1953, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 September 1958. The use of her hull for experimental and training purposes was authorized on 2 March 1959. She was used as an ASW target, then scuttled off Hawaii in November 1960.

<text>The 1998 United States Senate elections were held on November 3, 1998, with the 34 seats of Class 3 contested in regular elections. This was seen as an even contest between the Republican Party and Democratic Party. While the Democrats had to defend more seats up for election, Republican attacks on the morality of President Bill Clinton failed to connect with voters and anticipated Republican gains did not materialize. The Republicans picked open seats up in Ohio and Kentucky and narrowly defeated Democratic incumbent Carol Moseley Braun (Illinois), but these were cancelled out by the Democrats&#x27; gain of an open seat in Indiana and defeats of Republican Senators Al D&#x27;Amato (New York) and Lauch Faircloth (North Carolina). The balance of the Senate remained unchanged at 55–45 in favor of the Republicans, thereby tying these election results with those of 1996 and 2004 as the highest number of Senate seats that the Republicans have held since 1920.

With Democrats gaining five seats in the House of Representatives, this marked the first time since 1934 that the party not in control of the White House failed to gain congressional seats in mid-term election cycles, which would also happen in 2002. These are the last Senate elections that resulted in no net change in the balance of power, the last time Democrats won a U.S. Senate race in South Carolina, and the last time both major parties were on the general election ballot in every race.

== Alabama ==


Incumbent Republican Richard Shelby won re-election to a third term. Shelby had been elected in 1986 and 1992 as a Democrat, but switched to the Republican party in 1994, making this the first election he competed in as a Republican. He beat Democrat Clayton Suddith, an army veteran and former Franklin County Commissioner.




== Alaska ==


Incumbent Republican Frank Murkowski easily won re-election to a fourth term against Democratic nominee Joseph Sonneman, a perennial candidate, earning nearly 75% of the vote.

== Arkansas ==


Incumbent Dale Bumpers retired. U.S. Representative Blanche Lincoln won the open seat.








== California ==


Incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer won re-election to a second term.

== Colorado ==


Incumbent Republican Ben Nighthorse Campbell won re-election to a second term.



Campbell, who was elected in 1992 as a Democrat, switched parties after the 1994 Republican Revolution. He faced a primary challenger, but won with over 70% of the vote. In the general election, Democratic nominee Dottie Lamm criticized Campbell of flip flopping from being a moderate liberal to moderate conservative. In fact, throughout the entire campaign, Lamm mostly sent out negative attack advertisements about Campbell.






== Connecticut ==


Incumbent Democrat Chris Dodd won re-election for a fourth term against former Republican U.S. Congressman Gary A. Franks.




== Florida ==


Incumbent Democrat Bob Graham won re-election to a third term.



Graham defeated Crist in a landslide, as Crist won just four counties in the state. There were no third party or independent candidates.




== Georgia ==


Incumbent Republican Paul Coverdell won re-election to a second term.





== Hawaii ==


Incumbent Democrat Daniel Inouye won re-election to a seventh term over Republican legislative aide Crystal Young.




== Idaho ==


Incumbent Republican Dirk Kempthorne decided to retire after one term to run for governor. Republican nominee Mike Crapo won the open seat.







== Illinois ==


Incumbent Democrat Carol Moseley Braun decided to run for re-election, despite the number of controversies that she had in her first term. Republican State Senator Peter Fitzgerald won his party&#x27;s primary with a slim margin of victory.

He ended up defeating the incumbent, with a margin of victory of approximately 3%. Peter Fitzgerald won all but five counties.

During Moseley Braun&#x27;s term as U.S. Senator, she was plagued by several major controversies. Moseley Braun was the subject of a 1993 Federal Election Commission investigation over $249,000 in unaccounted-for campaign funds. The agency found some small violations, but took no action against Moseley Braun, citing a lack of resources. Moseley Braun only admitted to bookkeeping errors. The Justice Department turned down two requests for investigations from the IRS.

In 1996, Moseley Braun made a private trip to Nigeria, where she met with dictator Sani Abacha. Despite U.S. sanctions against that country, due to Abacha&#x27;s actions, the Senator did not notify, nor register her trip with, the State Department. She subsequently defended Abacha&#x27;s human rights records in Congress.

Peter Fitzgerald, a State Senator, won the Republican primary, defeating Illinois Comptroller Loleta Didrickson with 51.8% of the vote, to Didrickson&#x27;s 48.2%. Fitzgerald spent nearly $7 million in the Republican primary. He had a major financial advantage, as he was a multimillionaire. He ended up spending $12 million in his election victory.

In September, Moseley Braun created controversy again by using the word &quot;nigger&quot; to describe how she claims to be a victim of racism.

Most polls over the first few months showed Moseley Braun trailing badly. However, after she was helped in the final month by notable Democrats such as First Lady Hillary Clinton and U.S. Congressman Luis V. Gutierrez, three polls published in the last week showed her within the margin of error, and, in one poll, running even with Fitzgerald.

Moseley Braun was narrowly defeated by Republican Peter Fitzgerald. Moseley Braun only won five of Illinois&#x27;s 102 counties. Despite this, the race was kept close by Moseley running up massive margins in Cook County, home of Chicago. However, it was not quite enough to win.




== Indiana ==


Incumbent Republican Dan Coats decided to retire instead of seeking a second full term. Democratic nominee, former Governor Evan Bayh won the open seat his father once held.




== Iowa ==


Incumbent Republican Chuck Grassley sought re-election to a fourth term in the United States Senate, facing off against former State Representative David Osterberg, who won the Democratic nomination unopposed. Grassley had not faced a competitive election since 1980; this year proved no different, and Grassley crushed Osterberg to win a fourth term.








== Kansas ==


Incumbent Republican Sam Brownback won re-election to his first full term. Brownback was first elected in a special election held in 1996, when then-Senator Bob Dole resigned to campaign for U.S. President, after 27 years in the Senate. This would&#x27;ve been Dole&#x27;s seventh term in office had he remained in his seat.








== Kentucky ==


Incumbent Democratic U.S Senator Wendell Ford decided to retire, instead of seeking a fifth term. Republican Representative Jim Bunning won the open seat.








== Louisiana ==


Incumbent Democrat John Breaux won re-election to a third term. As of 2022, this is the last time the Democrats have won the Class 3 Senate Seat from Louisiana.





== Maryland ==


Incumbent Democrat Barbara Mikulski won re-election to a third term.










== Missouri ==


Incumbent Republican Kit Bond won re-election to a third term.




== Nevada ==


Incumbent Democrat Harry Reid won re-election to a third term.



Reid won in a close election by 401 votes—even closer than Tim Johnson&#x27;s Senate run in South Dakota in 2002, when he narrowly defeated Congressman John Thune by 524 votes. Ensign did not contest the results, and Reid won the race.




== New Hampshire ==


Incumbent Republican Judd Gregg won re-election to his second term.
 



== New York ==

Incumbent Republican Al D&#x27;Amato was running for re-election to a fourth term, but lost to Chuck Schumer in what was considered by many to be the &quot;high[est] profile and nastiest&quot; contest of the year.

Geraldine Ferraro, former U.S. Representative and nominee for Vice President in 1984, was well known for having been the 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee and had also run but lost in the Democratic primary in the 1992 U.S. Senate election in New York. Mark Green, New York City Public Advocate, had been the Democratic nominee in the 1986 election, but lost in the general election to D&#x27;Amato.

At the start of 1998, Ferraro had done no fundraising, out of fear of conflict of interest with her job hosting the CNN program &quot;Crossfire&quot;, but was nonetheless perceived as the front-runner by virtue of her name recognition; indeed, December and January polls had her 25 percentage points ahead of Green in the race and even further ahead of Schumer. Unlike her previous campaigns, Ferraro&#x27;s family finances never became an issue in 1998. However, she lost ground during the summer, with Schumer catching her in the polls by early August and then soon passing her. Schumer, a tireless fundraiser, outspent her by a five-to-one margin, and Ferraro failed to establish a political image current with the times. In the September 15, 1998, primary, she was beaten soundly by Schumer with a 51 percent to 26 percent margin. Unlike the bitter 1992 Democratic senatorial primary, this contest was not divisive, and Ferraro and third-place finisher Green endorsed Schumer at a unity breakfast the following day.

The primaries were held on September 15, 1998.




During the general campaign, D&#x27;Amato attempted to brand Schumer as a diehard liberal, while Schumer accused D&#x27;Amato of being a liar. When D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s first strategy failed, D&#x27;Amato attacked his opponent&#x27;s attendance record as a member of Congress, which Schumer refuted.

Late in the campaign, D&#x27;Amato called Schumer a &quot;putzhead&quot; in a private meeting with Jewish supporters (&quot;putz&quot; is Yiddish for penis, and can be slang for &quot;fool&quot;). The senator later apologized.

In the last days of the campaign, D&#x27;Amato campaigned with popular Governor George Pataki, who was also running for re-election, and was also supported by New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Mayor Ed Koch (a Democrat) Vice President Al Gore and First Lady Hillary Clinton personally campaigned for Schumer, as D&#x27;Amato was a prominent critic of President Bill Clinton who led the investigation into Whitewater. Though the Republican party was well organized, the Democratic party benefited from robocalls from President Clinton and mobilization from two big unions, United Federation of Teachers and 1199.

Though D&#x27;Amato was effective in obtaining federal government funds for New York State projects during his Senate career, he failed to capitalize on this in the election. Also, Schumer was a tenacious fund-raiser and was aggressive in his attacks. The candidates spent $30 million during the race.

The race was not close with Schumer defeating the incumbent D&#x27;Amato by just over 10%. D&#x27;Amato did win a majority of New York&#x27;s counties, but his wins were in less populated areas. Schumer&#x27;s win is attributed to strong performance in New York City. Schumer also performed well in heavily populated upstate cities, like Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester, and Albany.






:&quot;Per New York State law, Schumer and D&#x27;Amato totals include minor party line votes: Independence Party and Liberal Party for Schumer, Right to Life Party for D&#x27;Amato.&quot;

== North Carolina ==


Incumbent Republican Lauch Faircloth decided to seek re-election to a second term, but was unseated by Democrat John Edwards.

In the Democratic primary, Edwards defeated D. G. Martin, Ella Scarborough, and several minor candidates. In the Republican primary, Faircloth easily defeated two minor candidates.




== North Dakota ==


Incumbent NPL–Democrat Byron Dorgan won re-election to a second term.

Republican Donna Nalewaja, State Senator&#x27;s campaign focused on the suggestion that Dorgan had served in the United States Congress for nearly 20 years, and had accomplished relatively little. Dorgan and Nalewaja won the primary elections for their respective parties. McLain had previously run for North Dakota&#x27;s other Senate seat in 1980 against Mark Andrews.




== Ohio ==


Incumbent Democratic U.S Senator John Glenn decided to retire, instead of seeking a fifth term. Republican Governor George Voinovich won the open seat.



== Oklahoma ==


Incumbent Republican Don Nickles won re-election to his fourth term.
 



== Oregon ==


Incumbent Democratic Ron Wyden won re-election to his first full term, defeating Republican nominee John Lim, a state senator.
 




== Pennsylvania ==


Incumbent Republican Arlen Specter won re-election to a fourth term.

Leading up to this campaign, the state Democratic Party was in dire straits, as it was plagued by prior corruption allegations of several key legislators and by a lack of fund-raising. Just as in the accompanying gubernatorial race, the party had difficulty in finding a credible candidate. State Representative Bill Lloyd, State Representative, who was a well-respected party leader but who had almost zero statewide name recognition, was considered to be a sacrificial lamb candidate. Specter ran a straightforward campaign and attempted to avoid mistakes, while Lloyd&#x27;s bid was so underfunded that he was unable to air a single commercial until two weeks before the election. Lloyd&#x27;s strategy was to portray Republicans as hyper-partisan in wake of their attempt to impeach President Bill Clinton, but he was unable to gain any traction with his message. On Election Day, Specter&#x27;s win was by the second-largest margin in the history of Senate elections in Pennsylvania. Lloyd won in two counties: almost uniformly Democratic Philadelphia and his home county, rural and typically Republican Somerset County.





== South Carolina ==


Incumbent Democrat Fritz Hollings won re-election to his sixth full term. As of 2023, this is the last time Democrats won a U.S. Senate election in South Carolina.


The race between Hollings and Bob Inglis, U.S. Representative gave the voters a choice of two very different visions of and for South Carolina. Hollings was from the Lowcountry, a face of the Old New South, and secured a large amount of federal funds for the state. On the other hand, Inglis came from the Upstate, was a face of the New South, and opposed to pork barrel spending. Hollings viciously attacked Inglis on the campaign trail as a &quot;goddamn skunk&quot; and when Inglis requested that Hollings sign a pledge for campaign courtesy, Hollings replied that Inglis could &quot;kiss his fanny.&quot; Inglis tried to tie Hollings to President Clinton, who had been tainted by the Lewinsky scandal.

Ultimately, Hollings won the race for four crucial reasons. First, Inglis refused to accept PAC donations which allowed Hollings to enjoy a huge financial advantage and blanket the state with his television advertisements. Secondly, Inglis came from the Upstate which already provided GOP majorities whereas Hollings came from the Lowcountry which was a key tossup region in the state. Thirdly, the voters two years prior in the 1996 Senate election had rewarded Strom Thurmond for his long service to the state and it was unlikely that they would then deny re-election to Hollings. Finally, the 1998 South Carolina GOP ticket was dragged down with unpopular Governor David Beasley at the top of the ticket who would go on to lose his re-election campaign to Jim Hodges.





== South Dakota ==


Incumbent Democrat Tom Daschle won re-election to a third term. , this was the last time the Democrats have won the Class 3 Senate Seat from South Dakota.






== Utah ==


Incumbent Republican Bob Bennett won re-election to a second term.





== Vermont ==


Incumbent Democrat Patrick Leahy won re-election to a fifth term.

Notably, the Republican nominee, dairy farmer and actor Fred Tuttle, withdrew from the race and endorsed Leahy, asking Vermonters to vote for his Democratic opponent because he hated Washington DC and he was, as his wife had previously said publicly, unqualified to serve as a United States Senator. His campaign, which had been conducted primarily from his front porch in Tunbridge, VT, spent only $251 during the election season and featured the slogans &quot;Spread Fred!&quot; and &quot;Why Not?&quot; In spite of this, Tuttle still received 48,051 votes, or 22% of the total.










== Washington ==


Incumbent Democrat Patty Murray won re-election to a second term.



== Wisconsin ==


Incumbent Democrat Russ Feingold won re-election to a second term. In September 1997, Mark Neumann, a Republican U.S. Representative, announced his candidacy for the United States Senate against Russell Feingold. Both candidates had similar views on the budget surplus, although Neumann was for banning partial-birth abortion while Feingold was against a ban. Both candidates limited themselves to $3.8 million in campaign spending ($1 for every citizen of Wisconsin), although outside groups spent more than $2 million on Neumann; Feingold refused to have outside groups spend their own &#x27;soft money&#x27; on his behalf. Feingold defeated Neumann by a slim 2% margin in the election. According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Neumann had a 30,000 vote margin outside Milwaukee County, but was overwhelmed by a 68,000 vote margin in Milwaukee County.

<text>&quot;Rosa&quot; &#x27;Anne Harkness&#x27; (aka HARkaramel) is an apricot floribunda rose cultivar developed by Jack Harkness in 1979 and introduced into Great Britain in 1980. The rose makes an outstanding cut flower and is exceptionally long lasting in water.

==History==
The rose cultivar was developed by Jack Harkness of Harkness Roses (R. Harkness &amp; Co. Ltd) at Hitchin, Hertfordshire. The acclaimed nursery, which continues to sell roses today, was established in 1879 in Bedale, Yorkshire by brothers, John Harkness (1857-1933) and (Robert Harkness (1851-1920). Jack Harkness (1918-1994) is the grandson of the original co-founder John Harkness.

&#x27;Anne Harkness&#x27; was bred by Jack Harkness in 1979 and introduced into Britain in 1980. He named the rose, &#x27;Anne Harkness&#x27; to mark the 21st birthday of his niece, Anne Harkness. The parentage of the rose cultivar is a combination of: &quot;Rosa&quot; &#x27;Bobby Dazzler&#x27; × &quot;Rosa&quot; &#x27;Manx Queen&#x27; × &quot;Rosa&quot; &#x27;Prima Ballerina&#x27; × &quot;Rosa&quot; &#x27;Chanelle&#x27; × &quot;Rosa&quot; &#x27;Piccadilly&#x27;. The rose has two child plants: &quot;Rosa&quot; &#x27;Good as Gold&#x27; (Warner, 1994) and &quot;Rosa&quot; &#x27;Penny Lane&#x27; (Harkness, 1998).

==Description==
&#x27;Anne Harkness&#x27; is a medium-tall, narrow, upright shrub, 4 to 5 ft (121-152 cm) in height with a 2 to 3 ft (30-60 cm) spread. It has tall stems bearing large clusters of 6 to 20 flowers. Blooms have an average diameter of 2—3 in (5—7 cm) with a petal count of 26 to 40. The double (17-25), medium-sized flowers are lightly scented. Flowers are apricot or apricot-blend in color with yellow or gold edges. &#x27;Anne Harkness&#x27; is notable for beginning to bloom late in the season. It is a good repeat bloomer. Flowers can last a very long time in water. It is a popular rose with exhibitors and florists, and is well suited for cut flowers. The flowers are outstanding in August and September. The foliage is very healthy and a glossy, dark green. Powdery mildew can be a problem early in the blooming season.

<doc id="1104514" wikidata="Q5150209" url="?curid=1104514" title="Columnar phase">
<text>The columnar phase is a class of mesophases in which molecules assemble into cylindrical structures to act as mesogens. Originally, these kinds of liquid crystals were called discotic liquid crystals or bowlic liquid crystals because the columnar structures are composed of flat-shaped discotic or bowl-shaped molecules stacked one-dimensionally. Since recent findings provide a number of columnar liquid crystals consisting of non-discoid mesogens, it is more common now to classify this state of matter and compounds with these properties as columnar liquid crystals.

Takuzo Aida and co-workers recently reported cyclic peptides that self-assemble into polar columnar organizations. These materials can be unidirectionally aligned over large areas by application of an external electric field.

==Classes==
Columnar liquid crystals are grouped by their structural order and the ways of packing of the columns. Nematic columnar liquid crystals have no long-range order and are less organized than other columnar liquid crystals. Other columnar phases with long-range order are classified by their two-dimensional lattices: hexagonal, tetragonal, rectangular, and oblique phases.

The discotic nematic phase includes nematic liquid crystals composed of flat-shaped discotic molecules without long-range order. In this phase, molecules do not form specific columnar assemblies but only float with their short axes in parallel to the director (a unit vector which defines the liquid-crystalline alignment and order).

==Current topics of interest==
The first discotic liquid crystal was found in 1977 by the Indian researcher Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar. This molecule has one central benzene ring surrounded by six alkyl chains. Since then, a large number of discoid mesogenic compounds have been discovered in which triphenylene, porphyrin, phthalocyanine, coronene, and other aromatic molecules are involved. The typical columnar liquid-crystalline molecules have a pi-electron-rich aromatic core attached by flexible alkyl chains. This structure is attracting particular attention for potential molecular electronics in which aromatic parts transport electrons or holes and alkyl chains act as insulating parts. The advantages of liquid-crystalline conductors are their anisotropy, processibility, and self-healing characteristics for structural defects.

<doc id="1104515" wikidata="Q4347795" url="?curid=1104515" title="1996 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1996 United States Senate elections were held on November 5, 1996, with the 33 seats of Class 2 contested in regular elections. Special elections were also held to fill vacancies. They coincided with the presidential election of the same year, in which Democrat Bill Clinton was re-elected president.

Republicans held a 54–46 majority going into 1996, but a January special election in Oregon resulted in Democrats reducing the majority to 53–47. Despite the re-election of Clinton and Gore, and despite Democrats picking a net two seats up in the elections to the United States House of Representatives held the same day, the Republicans had a net gain of two seats in the Senate, following major Republican gains two years before in the 1994 elections. As such, Clinton became the only president to be re-elected without ever having any Senate coattails since the ratification of the 17th Amendment. The Republicans&#x27; 55–45 majority also marked the highest number of Senate seats that the party has held since 1920; this achievement would later be tied with the results of the 1998 and 2004 elections.

The Republicans won open seats previously held by Democrats in Alabama, Arkansas, and Nebraska. The only Democratic pickup occurred in South Dakota, where Democrat Tim Johnson narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Larry Pressler. The cycle featured an unusually high number of retirements, with 13 in total.

=== Elections leading to the next Congress ===
In these general elections, the winners were elected for the term beginning January 3, 1997; ordered by state.

All of the elections involved the Class 2 seats.

== Closest races ==
Sixteen races, as well as the Oregon special election in January, had margins less than 10%:
== Alabama ==

Incumbent Democrat Howell Heflin decided to retire. Republican and future Attorney General of the United States Jeff Sessions won the open seat, becoming only the second Republican U.S. Senator elected to represent Alabama since Reconstruction. This seat would remain controlled by Republicans until the election of Doug Jones in 2017.

In the 1968 presidential election, Alabama supported American Independent Party candidate George Wallace over both Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey. Wallace was the official Democratic candidate in Alabama, while Humphrey was listed as the &quot;National Democratic&quot;. In 1976, Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter from Georgia carried the state, the region, and the nation, but Democratic control of the region slipped after that.

Since 1980, conservative Alabama voters have increasingly voted for Republican candidates at the Federal level, especially in Presidential elections. By contrast, Democratic candidates have been elected to many state-level offices and, until 2010, comprised a longstanding majority in the Alabama Legislature.

Roger Bedford won the Democratic primary over Glen Browder. Sessions won the Republican primary over Sid McDonald and Charles Woods, defeating McDonald in the runoff. Sessions then defeated Bedford by a seven-point margin.














== Alaska ==

Incumbent Republican Ted Stevens ran for re-election to a sixth term. He defeated Republican Dave W. Cuddy in the open primary.

In the general election, Stevens faced off against Democratic nominee Theresa Obermeyer, a former member of the Anchorage School Board, and Green Party nominee Jed Whittaker, a commercial fisherman.

The race drew national attention for Obermeyer&#x27;s erratic behavior: she blamed Stevens for her husband&#x27;s failure to pass the bar exam and contended that he had passed the bar by fraud. She &quot;trailed&quot; him to campaign events, frequently wearing a prisoner&#x27;s outfit and once dragging a ball and chain behind her. During the campaign, she was arrested and served 30 days in prison in California and Oregon for probation violations.

Stevens was re-elected in an overwhelming landslide and Whittaker finished ahead of Obermeyer.










== Arkansas ==


Incumbent Democrat David Pryor decided to retire. Republican Tim Hutchinson ran unopposed in the Republican primary. Arkansas Attorney General Winston Bryant defeated State Senator Lu Hardin narrowly in the Democratic primary runoff. Hutchinson narrowly prevailed in the general election despite Bill Clinton&#x27;s victory in the state, winning the open seat.



== Colorado ==

Incumbent Republican Hank Brown decided to retire instead of seeking a second term. Republican Congressman Wayne Allard won the open seat after defeating Gale Norton in the primary, beating Democrat Tom Strickland, attorney and former U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, who himself had defeated Gene Nichol in the Democratic primary.









== Delaware ==

Incumbent Democrat Joe Biden won re-election to a fifth term, beating Republican businessman Raymond Clatworthy, who claimed the Republican nomination in a landslide.






== Georgia ==


Incumbent Democrat Sam Nunn decided to retire instead of seeking a fifth term. Republicans nominated Guy Millner, a multi-millionaire businessman who was also the unsuccessful candidate who ran against Zell Miller in the 1994 gubernatorial election. Millner emerged as the victor from a crowded 6-person primary in July 1996, which included State Senator Clint Day and former gubernatorial candidate Johnny Isakson. However, Max Cleland, the Secretary of State of Georgia ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.

Despite being held by Democrats since 1852, the election for this seat became tightly contested between Cleland and Millner. It was the closest race for that seat since at least 1852. Nonetheless, Max Cleland defeated Guy Millner on November 5. Max Cleland narrowly edged out a victory with 1,103,993 votes (48.87%) to Guy Millner&#x27;s 1,073,969 votes (47.54%) – a margin of 1.33%.

The Class 2 United States Senate seat had been reliably Democratic, with a member of that party holding it since 1852. Additionally, no Republican had ever held this seat since it was established in 1789. In fact, during the previous election, Sam Nunn was unanimously re-elected and defeated Mike Hicks by an almost 60% margin in 1984. Republican Paul Coverdell narrowly unseated Democrat Wyche Fowler in Georgia&#x27;s other United States Senate seat in 1992. On October 9, 1995, 4-term incumbent Class 2 Senator Sam Nunn announced his retirement. This left the seat open for the first time since 1972.

After the retirement of Sam Nunn, Democrats began seeking a successor for him. Eventually, Secretary of State of Georgia Max Cleland entered the race. Cleland was the only Democratic candidate to file for election, thus he became the nominee by default on July 9, 1996. During the primary, he received 517,697 votes – 100%.

Republicans also saw opportunity with an open Senate seat in Georgia. Six candidates filled to enter the Primary Election and become the Republican Nominee after July 9, 1996.

After the Republican Primary, Guy Millner emerged as the nominee. Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, noted that defeated rival Johnny Isakson was more likely to win the moderate vote due to his pro-abortion rights views on abortion. Several polls earlier that year showed Cleland defeating both Millner and Isakson. In contrast to Isakson&#x27;s opinion, Guy Millner was opposed to abortion except in the case of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. Johnny Isakson was later elected United States Senator after Zell Miller retired from his seat in 2004. Opponent Max Cleland quickly labeled Millner as an extremist, saying that &quot;I think people in this state want to elect a moderate ... not an extremist, not an ideologue, and not somebody hung up on some ideological agenda.&quot; In response, Millner began campaigning on other issues to capture more moderate voters.

On Election Day, Democratic nominee Max Cleland narrowly won against Republican Guy Millner. It was one of the closest United States Senate Elections in the history of Georgia. Cleland received 1,103,993 votes to Millner&#x27;s 1,073,969 votes. Libertarian candidate Jack Cashin obtained 81,262 votes, while only 8 people voted for Independent Arlene Rubinstein.




== Idaho ==


Incumbent Larry Craig won re-election against Democrat Walt Minnick, businessman and former Nixon Administration official, in a landslide.







== Illinois ==

Incumbent Democrat Paul Simon opted to retire rather than seek a third term. In the Democratic primary, Congressman Dick Durbin emerged victorious over future governor Pat Quinn, while State Representative Al Salvi won the Republican primary in an upset over incumbent Lieutenant Governor Bob Kustra. Though the election was initially anticipated to be close, Durbin defeated Salvi by a comfortable 15-point margin of victory, allowing him to win what would be the first of several terms in the Senate.












== Iowa ==

Incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin sought re-election to a third term unopposed in the Democratic primary, and he was challenged by Congressman Jim Ross Lightfoot from Iowa&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, who won the Republican primary over Maggie Tinsman. Lightfoot had won the Republican primary against two opponents, while Harkin had won his primary uncontested, so both moved on to the general election, where they engaged in a toughly-fought campaign. Ultimately, Harkin was successful in his bid, and defeated Lightfoot, albeit by the thinnest margin of his career — 5.1 points.










== Kansas ==

Due to the resignation of Bob Dole campaigning for the Presidential election, there were two elections in Kansas as both seats were up for election.

=== Kansas (regular) ===
Incumbent Republican Nancy Kassebaum decided to retire instead of seeking a fourth term. Republican Pat Roberts won the open seat, beating the Democratic Kansas State Treasurer Sally Thompson. Thompson faced no primary opposition, while Roberts faced token opposition.

Term limits were an issue during the campaign; while Roberts said that he was not totally opposed to term limits, he was wary of limits that did not apply to current members of Congress, saying that the proposed limits should apply to everyone. While Thompson signed the national term limits pledge from the group Americans for Limited Terms, Roberts declined to do so, becoming the only major party candidate for the U.S. Senate in the 1996 elections to not sign the pledge. However, he did say that &quot;I plan only to serve two terms in the U.S. Senate.&quot; In 2014, he was elected to a fourth term in office.








=== Kansas (special) ===
Incumbent Republican Sheila Frahm, who was recently appointed to the seat, was defeated in the primary by Sam Brownback, who went on to win the general election by ten points over Jill Docking, businesswoman and daughter-in-law of former Kansas Governor Robert Docking, who herself had defeated Joan Finney in the Democratic primary. Brownback would remain in office until 2011, since he retired to run for Governor of Kansas in 2010, a race and a gubernatorial election which he eventually won.









== Kentucky ==

Incumbent Republican Mitch McConnell won re-nomination over Tommy Klein and then won re-election to a third term with a 12.6% margin of victory over Steve Beshear, a former Lieutenant Governor, who had defeated Tom Barlow in the Democratic primary. McConnell&#x27;s landslide victory occurred at the same time President Bill Clinton was re-elected to a second term, winning by a 7.5% margin nationwide, but carrying Kentucky by a 0.9% margin.




In 1996, Beshear started out trailing against McConnell, with an early general election poll placing McConnell ahead of Beshear 50% to 32%. The campaign ultimately became quite harsh, with the McConnell campaign sending &quot;Hunt Man,&quot; a take off of Chicken George dressed in &quot;the red velvet coat, jodhpurs, black riding boots and black helmet of a patrician fox hunter.&quot; This was done as a means of criticizing Beshear&#x27;s membership in a fox hunting club in Lexington, and undercut the Beshear campaign&#x27;s message that McConnell was a Republican in the mold of Newt Gingrich and that Beshear was the only friend of the working class in the race. Beshear did not make much traction with the electorate during the campaign. By October 1996, Beshear had narrowed the gap between himself and McConnell slightly, with McConnell leading Beshear 50% to 38%. Beshear was later elected governor in 2007.





== Louisiana ==

Incumbent Democrat J. Bennett Johnston chose to retire. After the jungle primary election, state treasurer Mary Landrieu went into a runoff election with State Representative Woody Jenkins of Baton Rouge, a former Democrat who had turned Republican two years earlier. She prevailed by 5,788 votes out of 1.7 million cast, the narrowest national result of the thirty-three races for the U.S. Senate that year and one of the closest election margins in Louisiana history. At the same time, Democrat Bill Clinton carried Louisiana by a considerable margin of 927,837 votes to 712,586 cast for Republican Bob Dole.

The multi-candidate field for the primary included Democratic state Attorney General Richard Ieyoub and the former Ku Klux Klan leader, David Duke, running again as a Republican. Among the minor candidates was Peggy Wilson, an at-large member of the New Orleans City Council, and Troyce Guice, who had sought the same seat thirty years earlier when it was held by the veteran Senator Allen J. Ellender.










Jenkins refused to concede and charged massive election fraud, orchestrated by the Democratic political organization of New Orleans, provided Landrieu&#x27;s narrow margin of victory. He took his case to the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate and petitioned for Landrieu&#x27;s unseating pending a new election. In a hearing, carried live by C-SPAN, the Senate Rules Committee in a party-line 8–7 vote agreed to investigate the charges. The decision briefly placed Landrieu&#x27;s status in the U.S. Senate under a cloud.

Only a month into the probe, however, it emerged that Thomas &quot;Papa Bear&quot; Miller, a detective hired by Jenkins to investigate claims of fraud, had coached witnesses to claim they had participated in election fraud. Three witnesses claimed Miller had paid them to claim that they had either cast multiple votes for Landrieu or drove vans of illegal voters across town. The others told such bizarre tales that FBI agents dismissed their claims out of hand. It also emerged that Miller had several felony convictions on his record, including a guilty plea to attempted murder. The Democrats walked out of the probe in protest, but the probe continued.

The investigation dragged on for over ten months, angering the Democrats and exacerbating partisan friction in the day-to-day sessions of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee to which Landrieu was assigned as a freshman member of the 105th Congress. Finally, in October 1997, the Rules Committee concluded that while there were major electoral irregularities, none of them were serious enough to burden Louisiana with a new election at that stage. It recommended that the results stand.

The Landrieu-Jenkins contest was not the only U.S. Senate election in 20th century Louisiana in which the results were hotly disputed. Future Senator John H. Overton claimed the renomination and hence reelection of Senator Joseph E. Ransdell was tainted by fraud. In 1932, Senator Edwin S. Broussard claimed that his primary defeat by Overton was fraudulent. In both cases, the Senate seated the certified winners, Ransdell and Overton, respectively.

== Maine ==


Incumbent Republican William Cohen decided to retire instead of seeking a fourth term. To replace him, Congressman and former Governor of Maine Joseph E. Brennan won the Democratic primary over Sean Faircloth and Richard A. Spencer, while political consultant and 1994 nominee for Governor of Maine Susan Collins won the Republican primary over W. John Hathaway. A competitive general election ensued, but Collins ultimately won out over Brennan, keeping the seat in the Republican column. With Collins&#x27;s election to the Senate in 1996, Maine became only the second state after California to have two sitting women senators.










== Massachusetts ==


Incumbent Democrat John Kerry won re-election to a third term over the Republican Governor of Massachusetts,

On November 29, 1995, Governor Bill Weld announced his candidacy for the Senate seat occupied by U.S. Senator Kerry with a formal announcement on March 27, 1996. Kerry&#x27;s previous two opponents in 1984 and 1990 had no prior elected office experience. The election was one of many competitive senate elections in 1996.

At the federal level, Democrats controlled both U.S. Senate seats and eight of ten U.S. House seats. No Republican won a senate election since 1972. In the 1984 presidential election, President Ronald Reagan won 49 of 50 states, with Massachusetts being his worst performance (excluding Walter Mondale&#x27;s home-state of Minnesota. Reagan carried the state with just 51% of the vote. In 1994, incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy won re-election against businessman Mitt Romney with just 58% of the vote, the lowest percentage since his first senate election campaign in 1962.

The first debate between Weld and Kerry was held in Faneuil Hall on April 8 with a second debate held on June 3. A third debate was held at the Emerson Majestic Theater on July 2. The Weld and Kerry campaigns agreed to eight debates and a spending cap of $6.9 million negotiated at Senator Kerry&#x27;s Beacon Hill home on August 7; Senator Kerry later mortgaged his house to raise funds in October. On the same day the spending cap was agreed upon, Governor Weld jumped into the Charles River. He later spoke at the 1996 Republican National Convention on August 14 before debating U.S. Senator Kerry again on August 19. Senator Kerry spoke at the 1996 Democratic National Convention and debated Governor Weld again on September 16.





== Michigan ==


Incumbent Democrat Carl Levin won re-election to a fourth term over Ronna Romney radio talk show host and former daughter-in-law of Michigan governor George W. Romney. Both ran unopposed in the primary.





== Minnesota ==


Incumbent Democrat Paul Wellstone won re-nomination in a landslide, and he faced Republican Rudy Boschwitz, who had also handily won the Republican nomination in the general election. Wellstone won re-election to a second term with a majority, though he would die before his term expired.






Boschwitz filed to run a rematch against Wellstone. The incumbent was an unapologetic liberal. Rudy released ads accusing Wellstone of being &quot;embarrassingly liberal&quot; and calling him &quot;Senator Welfare&quot;. Boschwitz accused Wellstone of supporting flag burning, a move that some believe possibly backfired. Like the 1990 election, Wellstone had a massive grassroots campaign which inspired college students, poor people and minorities to get involved in politics for the very first time. Prior to that accusation, Boschwitz had significantly outspent Wellstone on campaign advertising and the race was closely contested, but Wellstone went on to beat Boschwitz by a nine-point margin in a three-way race (Dean Barkley received 7%). Despite losing here, Barkley was later appointed near the end of the next term after Wellstone&#x27;s 2002 death.






== Mississippi ==


Incumbent Republican Thad Cochran won re-election to a fourth term, unopposed in the Republican primary, by a landslide over Democrat Bootie Hunt, who defeated Shawn O&#x27;Hara in the Democratic primary.




== Montana ==


Incumbent Democrat Max Baucus, who was first elected in 1978 and was re-elected in 1984 and 1990, ran for re-election. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary, and moved on to the general election, where he faced a stiff challenge in Denny Rehberg, the Lieutenant Governor of Montana and the Republican nominee, who had faced nominal opposition. Despite Bob Dole&#x27;s victory over Bill Clinton and Ross Perot in the state that year in the presidential election, Baucus managed to narrowly win re-election over Rehberg to secure a fourth term in the Senate by just under five percent. Shaw and Heaton&#x27;s totals were greater than Baucus&#x27;s margin of victory over Rehberg. This was the closest election of Baucus&#x27;s senate career, having won every other election by at least ten points.











== Nebraska ==

Incumbent Democrat J. James Exon decided to retire instead of seeking a fourth term. Republican businessman Chuck Hagel won the Republican primary over Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg. Ben Nelson, Governor of Nebraska, was unopposed in the Democratic primary. Hagel won the open seat by 14 points over Nelson. Nelson would later serve alongside Hagel, being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2000.









== New Hampshire ==

Incumbent Republican Bob Smith won re-election to a second term over Democrat Richard Swett. Both were unopposed in their respective primaries. Smith had established himself as the most conservative Senator from the Northeast, and Bill Clinton&#x27;s coattails nearly caused his defeat. On the night of the election many American media networks incorrectly projected that Swett had won. Smith would lose re-nomination to John Sununu in 2002 after briefly leaving the Republican party, and Sununu would succeed him in the Senate.




== New Jersey ==


Incumbent Democrat Bill Bradley decided to retire instead of seeking a fourth term. Democratic Congressman Robert G. Torricelli won the election, beating Republican Congressman Dick Zimmer.

Zimmer was the front-runner for the GOP nomination from the start, getting endorsements from Republican leaders across the state, including Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. Both DuHaime, an anti-abortion candidate, and LaRossa, a pro-gun candidate, attempted to portray Mr. Zimmer as too liberal for the party. But Zimmer treated the two challengers as if they did not exist.



Democratic U.S. Representative Robert Torricelli easily won his party primary unopposed. Republican U.S. Representative Dick Zimmer won his party&#x27;s nomination easily. Torricelli defeated Zimmer in the general election by 10 points, a margin less than President Bill Clinton, who carried New Jersey by almost 18%. Independents made up 4.8% of the vote.

Like other Democratic candidates around the country, Torricelli tried to portray &quot;Zig-Zag Zimmer&quot; as a clone of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and flip flopping on his positions on issues like Medicare, gun control and an increase in the minimum wage during the campaign. Zimmer tried to cast his opponent as a tax-and-spend liberal with ethical flaws. Military morale was also a part of the campaign.





== New Mexico ==


Incumbent Republican Pete Domenici ran for re-election to a fifth term and faced no Republican opposition. Art Trujillo defeated Eric Treisman in the Democratic primary. Domenici defeated Trujilo in a landslide, 65%-30%.








== North Carolina ==


The election was a rematch of the 1990 election: between the Republican incumbent Jesse Helms and the Democratic nominee Harvey Gantt. Gantt won the Democratic primary over Charles Sanders. Helms was unopposed. Helms won re-election to a fifth and final term by a slightly wider margin than in 1990.




Jesse Helms won the Republican Party&#x27;s nomination unopposed.



== Oklahoma ==

Incumbent Republican Jim Inhofe won re-election to his first full term over Democratic businessman James Boren. He improved upon his margin in 1994 in the special election for the remainder of Democrat David Boren&#x27;s term. Both candidates were unopposed in the primary.




== Oregon ==

Oregon had two elections due to a resignation, one in January, and then a second in November.

=== Oregon (special) ===
A special election was held on January 30, 1996, to fill the seat vacated by Republican Bob Packwood, who had resigned October 1, 1995 due to sexual misconduct allegations.

In the primaries held on December 5, 1995, Democratic U. S. Representative Ron Wyden and Republican President of the Oregon State Senate Gordon H. Smith were nominated. Wyden narrowly defeated fellow U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio in the Democratic primary, while Smith won by a large margin, with the next closest candidate being Norma Paulus. Wyden then defeated Smith in the general election by just over one percentage point. Smith would win the regularly-scheduled election to the Senate later that year and serve alongside Wyden until 2009, when he was succeeded by Democrat Jeff Merkley.















=== Oregon (regular) ===
Incumbent Republican Mark Hatfield decided to retire after thirty years in the Senate. Oregon State Senate President Gordon H. Smith, who had run for the Senate earlier that year, won the Republican primary with nominal opposition, while businessman Tom Bruggere won a contested Democratic primary over Harry Lonsdale, who had run in two previous Senate elections and was the Democratic nominee in 1990. The contest between Smith and Bruggere was one of the toughest that year, but ultimately, Smith was able to keep the seat in the Republican column and defeated Bruggere by a four-point margin.







This was the second Senatorial race for Gordon Smith in 1996; he had previously lost to Ron Wyden in the special election to fill Bob Packwood&#x27;s seat.

Both candidates spent heavily from their own resources. Bruggere won the Democratic nomination with $800,000 of his own money in the primary race, and was one of 134 candidates for the U.S. Congress to finance their own elections in excess of $50,000 in that cycle. Smith had already spent $2.5 million of his own money earlier that same year in an unsuccessful effort to defeat Democrat Ron Wyden in the 1996 special election to replace Bob Packwood, who had resigned.

Shortly after their respective primary victories, the rivals met for a highly publicized lunch, and agreed to run issue-oriented campaigns. However, in the final weeks of the campaign, Bruggere supporters ran advertisements alleging a pollution problem with Smith&#x27;s frozen foods business, which the Smith campaign characterized as a breach of that agreement. A &quot;Boston Globe&quot; profile highlighted their similarities as corporate candidates with minimal political experience.

In the general election race, most Oregon daily newspapers endorsed Smith over Bruggere. The race was close, with neither side claiming victory for several days after the elections absentee ballots were tallied. After all votes were counted, Smith won by 4 percentage points. It was the last of the 1996 Senate elections to be determined; overall, the Republicans gained two seats in the Senate, increasing their majority from 53 to 55 seats.





== Rhode Island ==

Incumbent Democrat Claiborne Pell decided to retire. Incumbent U.S. Representative Jack Reed won the Democratic primary with little opposition, while state Treasurer Nancy Mayer won the Republican nomination. Reed defeated Mayer in a landslide, 63%-35%. Rhode Island has been reliably Democratic at the federal level since the 1930s, but Republicans still had success during the 1980s. In fact, Republican John Chafee won re-election just two years earlier in 1994 by a similar margin.









== South Carolina ==

Popular incumbent Republican Strom Thurmond won re-election against Democratic challenger Elliott Springs Close.

The South Carolina Democratic Party held their primary on June 11, 1996. Elliott Springs Close, a 43-year-old political novice from Columbia, entered the Democratic primary and faced opposition from black photographer Cecil J. Williams. Close was a wealthy heir of a textile business, a brother-in-law of President Clinton&#x27;s chief of staff Erskine Bowles, who styled himself as a fiscal conservative and a social moderate. Even though he proclaimed himself as such, he took positions that would align himself with the liberal wing of the Democratic party. Close would not have voted to balance the budget, he agreed with the Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell policy of the military initiated by Clinton and he supported continuing welfare as a federal entitlement program.



The South Carolina Republican Party held their primary on June 11, 1996, and the contest pitted 93-year-old incumbent Senator Strom Thurmond against two relatively unknown candidates. Secretary of State Jim Miles was the only Republican statewide official who had not endorsed Strom Thurmond and it was rumored that he was considering entering the primary. Thurmond&#x27;s press secretary, Mark Goodin, criticized Miles for not endorsing Thurmond and told those who contributed to Miles campaign fund that they were contributing to a contest against Thurmond, not the state&#x27;s other Senator, Democrat Fritz Hollings. Miles soon endorsed Thurmond which left Harold G. Worley, a state representative from Myrtle Beach, and Charlie Thompson, an educator from Charleston, as the only opponents to Thurmond&#x27;s election. Worley spent $600,000 of his own money and based his campaign almost solely on Thurmond&#x27;s age. He questioned Thurmond&#x27;s mental ability to make decisions and whether he had the capacity to fill out a full term, which would put Thurmond at one-hundred years old. Nevertheless, Thurmond cruised to a primary victory and Worley only carried Horry County.


The race between Thurmond and Close boiled down to whether Thurmond could retain the affection of voters who had re-elected him over and over or whether Close could convince the voters that Thurmond&#x27;s age was an impediment to effective service for the state. Thurmond therefore adopted a non-confrontational approach to the campaign. He chose to not debate Close, not only because he had not debated an opponent since Olin D. Johnston in the 1950 Senate election, but also because it would only emphasize the 50-year age difference between the candidates. Thurmond energetically traversed the state greeting the voters and pointed out to them that with his experience, he could more effectively serve the state than a political neophyte.

Close ran television advertisements that highlighted the age issue by declaring that although Thurmond had admirably served the state for over fifty years, it was time for someone new to represent South Carolina. He poured almost a million dollars into his campaign, but his campaign never remained focused. For instance, trying to not appear too wealthy, Close traded his fancy foreign car for a Cadillac. He acquired a speeding ticket in the Cadillac and a newspaper criticized him for driving a luxury automobile. Frustrated, Close then switched his Cadillac for a Buick. Another instance of his jumbled campaign came when said that his family&#x27;s textile factories did not lay off an employee during the Great Depression. Yet a week after this statement, three mills were closed and 850 employees were out of work.

By the day of the election on November 5, polls had shown that the voters thought it was time for Thurmond to retire, but they did not want to throw him out of office. Close spent almost a million dollars of his fortune to defeat Thurmond and his decision to raise a million dollars from outside sources was attacked by the Thurmond campaign of a lack of confidence by Close in his own campaign. Thurmond spent a little more than $2.6 million on the race and was said to have &quot;dodged the bullet&quot; by &quot;The State&quot; reporter Lee Bandy after his victory. The campaign aides of Thurmond stated he could have been defeated had either former Governor Richard Riley or 5th district congressman John M. Spratt, Jr. run against him.





== South Dakota ==


Incumbent Republican Larry Pressler ran for re-election to a fourth term, but narrowly lost to Democratic nominee Tim Johnson by 9,000 votes.

Pressler and Johnson swapped leads in their own polls all year. The two candidates also swapped charges. Pressler said that Johnson was too liberal for the state, while Johnson contended that Pressler was beholden to the out-of-state interests that have fattened his campaign coffers.

Seeking a fourth term, Pressler noted his seniority; his close ties to his longtime Senate colleague, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole; and, most emphatically, the power he wielded as the chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.

Yet the massive changes in telecommunications law that he shepherded through the Senate since becoming chairman last year proved to be a mixed blessing politically for Pressler.

Political action committees related to industries affected by the legislation were generous donors to his campaign, and Pressler assured South Dakota voters that, over the long run, the bill will lower prices and provide jobs. But both telephone and cable television rates had gone up in South Dakota that year, leading Pressler to pull an ad stating that phone rates were going down.

Despite this apparently negative short-term effect, Pressler said that Johnson&#x27;s votes against the &quot;telecom&quot; bill, along with his opposition to the GOP&#x27;s seven-year balanced-budget plan and changes in farm policy, proved Johnson votes inconsistently with his moderate rhetoric.

&quot;You say one thing in South Dakota and vote liberal all the time in Washington,&quot; intoned an announcer in a Pressler TV ad. In another ad, which Pressler called &quot;the essence of my campaign,&quot; the senator himself called Johnson a liberal.

Johnson countered that Pressler&#x27;s vote for the deficit- reducing budget-reconciliation package was a blow against the interests of farmers and seniors, two groups that helped fuel Pressler&#x27;s victories in the past. Johnson also warned that farmers will be more vulnerable in years of poor yield under the new farm law. The so-called Freedom To Farm Act received mixed reviews from major agriculture groups in the state. The results were 51% for Johnson and 49% for Pressler.



== Tennessee ==

Republican Senator Fred Thompson ran for re-election to a second term. Thompson defeated the Democratic challenger, Covington lawyer Houston Gordon in the general election.





== Texas ==

Incumbent Republican Phil Gramm won re-election to a third term over Democratic Navy veteran Victor Morales.

Gramm was easily renominated in the Republican primary. Morales, who never ran for public office before, pulled a major upset in the primary by defeated three politicians: U.S. Congressman John Wiley Bryant, U.S. Congressman Jim Chapman, and former State Supreme Court litigator John Odam. In the March run-off, he defeated Bryant with 51% of the vote. He became the first minority in Texas history to become a United States Senate nominee from either major party. Despite having no staff, raising only $15,000, and not accepting any special interest money he obtained 2.5 million votes.

Gramm previously ran for president earlier in the year, but lost to fellow U.S. Senator Bob Dole in the Republican presidential primary. Gramm was the heavy favorite. A September poll showed Gramm leading 50% to 40%. A late October poll showed him leading with 53% to 31%.

Exit Polls showed that Gramm performed well with Anglos (68% to 31%), while Morales won African Americans (79% to 19%) and Latinos (79% to 20%) respectively.





== Virginia ==

Incumbent Republican John Warner won re-election to a fourth term. Warner, a moderate Republican who held this Senate seat from 1979, remained a popular and powerful political figure. A former United States Secretary of the Navy, he was at this time Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee.


Warner easily won renomination over former OMB director James C. Miller III, despite opposition by a number of conservative Republicans, who distrusted him because of his moderate positions (Warner is pro-abortion rights, pro-gun control and refused to support 1994 Senate nominee Oliver North due to his role in the Iran-Contra Affair).

Warner was endorsed by such notable figures as Bob Dole, George H. W. Bush, Gerald Ford and Colin Powell, while Miller was endorsed by the Christian Coalition of America and the National Rifle Association of America (NRA).



The two Warners (no relation) competed in one of the closest Senate elections in Virginia history. The incumbent, who was a moderate Republican, was very popular and did not even have a major opponent in his last re-election bid in 1990. Although Mark Warner was relatively unknown, he became one of John Warner&#x27;s strongest challengers. The Democrat self-financed his campaign and ended up outspending the Republican. In October, the Democrat outspent the incumbent 5–1.

The incumbent had to compete in a primary against James C. Miller III, who was more conservative, because he decided to endorse an independent in the 1994 U.S. Senate election, opting not to endorse the controversial Republican nominee, Oliver North. Despite this, North did endorse John Warner in the 1996 election. In the general election, the incumbent called the Democrat a &quot;robber baron,&quot; &quot;Carpetbagger,&quot; and a &quot;Connecticut Yankee&quot; who raised money from outside the state. Mark Warner tried to compete in the Southern part of the state, which is traditionally Republican territory. He earned the endorsement from the Reform Party of Virginia.

In June, the incumbent was leading 58%–24%. On September 19, the incumbent led 54%–34%.




Mark Warner lost the parts of the state that are outside the three largest metropolitan areas, 51%–49%, a very impressive result for a Democrat in this heavily Republican territory. However, John Warner&#x27;s strength among moderates enabled him to carry Northern Virginia 55%–45%, which got him over the top. Warner would win election to the U.S. Senate in 2008, receiving John Warner&#x27;s endorsement.

== West Virginia ==
Incumbent Democrat Jay Rockefeller won re-election to a third term victory over Betty Berks.
Incumbent Democrat Jay Rockefeller ran for re-election to a third term. He defeated Bruce Barilla, a Christian activist, in the Democratic primary by a wide margin. He faced Republican Betty A. Burks and won by a wide margin in the general election, 77%-23%. West Virginia, a longtime Democratic stronghold, began to shift red after Arch A. Moore Jr. was twice elected governor. Though Bush started a Republican winning streak at the presidential level in 2000, Rockefeller never faced a competitive re-election campaign in his tenure. 



== Wyoming ==


Incumbent Republican Alan K. Simpson decided to retire. Democrat Kathy Karpan, Wyoming Secretary of State, won the Democratic primary over Mickey Kalinay. Wyoming State Senator Mike Enzi won the Republican primary over John Barrasso and Curt Meier. Barrasso was later appointed to the U.S. Senate after the death of Craig L. Thomas and re-elected in his own right three times.

Enzi defeated Karpan by 12 points in the general election. Wyoming is one of the most Republican states in the country, and Enzi&#x27;s re-election margin was similar to Bob Dole&#x27;s 13-point margin over incumbent U.S. President Bill Clinton in the state.

<text>The State Council () was the supreme state advisory body to the tsar in the Russian Empire. From 1906, it was the upper house of the parliament under the Russian Constitution of 1906.

==18th century==
Early tsars&#x27; councils were small and dealt primarily with external politics.

Peter I of Russia introduced the Secret Council. Catherine I of Russia introduced the Supreme Secret Council. Its role varied during different reigns.

Peter III of Russia created the Imperial Council on 20 May 1762 (&quot;Императорский Совет&quot;), or, formally &quot;The Council at the Highest Court&quot; (&quot;Совет при высочайшем дворе&quot;). It was dismissed shortly after the succession of Catherine II of Russia.

==1810–1906==
The State Council was established by Alexander I of Russia in 1810 as part of Speransky&#x27;s reforms. Although envisaged by Speransky as the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, it was actually an advisory legislative body composed of people whom the tsar could trust. The number of members varied at different periods. Upon its establishment in 1810 there were 35 members; in 1890 there were 60. The main duty of the council was the preliminary investigation, promulgation and abrogation of laws.

There were four departments of the council: Legislative; Civil and Ecclesiastical Administration; State Economy; and Industry, Science and Commerce. Each department had its own presiding officer (State Secretary) and met separately to discuss matters assigned to their departments. There were also plenary sessions of the whole council presided over by the Chairman of the State Council.

The council as a whole examined projects of law proposed by the ministers who were ex-officio members. The majority of their sessions concerned the budget and state expenditures but they would examine anything submitted to them. They had no authority to propose changes to the law, to examine anything that was not submitted to them for examination or decision-making authority. The council only made recommendations to the monarch, who could support the majority, a minority, or disregard the council&#x27;s recommendations altogether, as he saw fit. According to Dominic Lieven it &quot;played no part in the formulation of foreign policy and its members&#x27; access to the emperor was very limited.
==1906–1917==
During 1906–1917, the status of the State Council was defined by the Russian Constitution of 1906. Its chairman was appointed by the Tsar. Half of its members were appointed by the Tsar from persons distinguished at civil and military service, and half by elections from various categories of society, separately:
* 56 seats from Zemstvo (1 from each guberniya),
* 18 seats from Assemblies of Nobility,
* 6 seats from the Russian Orthodox Church: 3 of them from white clergy, and 3 from black clergy,
* 12 seats from stock exchange committees, chambers of commerce and business associations,
* 6 seats from the Russian Academy of Sciences,
* 2 seats from the Diet of Finland, which refused to send delegates.

The State Council was the upper house of the parliament, while the State Duma of the Russian Empire was the lower house. Compared to the contemporary British House of Lords and Prussian Herrenhaus, the Russian upper chamber was more democratically constituted, as half of its members were democratically elected from different sections of society, while the Herrenhaus consisted of hereditary peers, and the House of Lords consisted of hereditary peers and clergy from privileged dioceses.

The State Council ceased to exist after the February Revolution of 1917. The Soviet Union did not replace this council until 1991 when the State Council of the Soviet Union was created amid its imminent breakup. The latter council would be short-lived and dissolved by year end.

<text>Tamatea / Dusky Sound is a fiord on the southwest corner of New Zealand, in Fiordland National Park.

==Geography==

One of the most complex of the many fiords on this coast, it is also the largest at 40 kilometres in length and eight kilometres wide at its widest point. To the north of its mouth is the large Resolution Island, whose Five Fingers Peninsula shelters the mouth of the sound from the northwest; along the east coast of the island, Acheron Passage connects Dusky Sound with Breaksea Sound, to the north.

Several large islands lie in the sound, notably Anchor Island, Long Island, and Cooper Island. The upper reaches of the sound are steep-sided, and the high precipitation of the region leads to hundreds of waterfalls cascading into the sound during the rainy season. Seals and dolphins are often sighted in the sound&#x27;s waters and occasionally visited by whales where the area especially nearby Preservation Inlet was one of earliest shore-based whaling ground for southern right whales, while humpback whales show sudden increases. The Seaforth River is the largest of many small rivers and creeks which flow into the sound.

At its mouth, the sound is wide, and is bordered by the Five Fingers Peninsula to the north and by South Cape and Fannin Bay in the south. The south Island&#x27;s westernmost point, West Cape lies less than 10 kilometres south of the sound&#x27;s mouth. Immediately inside the sound&#x27;s mouth lies the large Anchor Island and numerous small islets, among them the Seal, Petrel, and Many Island groups. To the north of Anchor Island lies Resolution Island, and here its coast in indented by a large triangular cove which separates the Five Fingers Peninsula from the rest of the island. A number of small coves punctuate this coast, including Goose Cove and Earshell Cove. Immediately to the southeast of Anchor Island lies the smaller Indian Island.

To the east of Anchor Island, the sound narrows to about five kilometres and splits into two broad channels, separated by the aptly named Long Island, which stretches for some 15 kilometres in length but is only around 2000 metres wide at its widest point. The narrower of the two channels, Cook Channel, lies to the south of Long Island; Bowen Channel lies to the north. Bowen Channel links with Acheron Passage, a north–south channel which separates Resolution Island from the mainland and links with Breaksea Sound to the north.

Inland from Long Island lies Cooper Island, about eight kilometres long and up to five kilometres wide. Dusky Sound narrows to the east of Cooper Island, reaching its end in two small coves, Shark Cove and Supper Cove. The Seaforth River flows into the eastern end of Supper Cove.

===Important Bird Area===
The sound has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it is a breeding site for Fiordland penguins.

==History==
It is believed that Māori occasionally camped by the sound&#x27;s waters while hunting moa in pre-European times.

The inlet was first sighted by Europeans and Captain Cook noted its entrance during his first voyage to New Zealand in 1770. He named it Dusky Bay. On his second expedition he spent two months exploring the sound in March and April of 1773, and used it as a harbour, establishing workshops and an observatory. It is believed his crew brewed the first beer in New Zealand during his stay. He encountered some Māori with whom he had friendly relations. Later they seemed to have disappeared and it was speculated their countrymen had killed them, perhaps for the presents Cook gave them.

A large battle between Ngāti Moi Moi (the lost tribe) and Ngāi Tahu. It is said that Ngāti Moi Moi took their last stand on the beach but were killed.

Cook saw the place as a good harbour for ships entering the Pacific from Europe by the shortest route, highlighting its maritime significance and overlooking its land-locked character. This gave it an unusual prominence in earliest European visits which disappeared as Europeans became more familiar with New Zealand&#x27;s geography.

Dusky Sound was consequently used as a harbour by other European navigators and merchant ships in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. From 1792 it became a favoured site for seal hunters. Men landed by Captain William Raven from the &quot;Britannia&quot; in that year built the first European house in New Zealand and the first ship in Australasia, and the first European woman known to have been in New Zealand was recorded as a visitor in 1793. A group of 244 Europeans was stranded in Dusky Sound in 1795, which included two women, Elizabeth Bason and Ann Carey, the first known to have lived ashore. The last of this group left in 1797. The attention of the sealers moved to Bass Strait from 1798 but returned to New Zealand, at Dusky Sound, from 1802. In that year Captain Charles Bishop and George Bass in the spent 14 days in Dusky Sound stripping iron from the hulk of Captain Brampton&#x27;s old ship the &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The blacksmith converted the iron into axes which they then used in Tahiti to trade for pork before returning to Sydney by November 1802. Following this, in January 1803, George Bass asked Governor King of New South Wales for a fishing monopoly, from a line bisecting New Zealand from Dusky Sound to Otago Harbour extending south to include the subantarctic Islands. It was not granted, but it indicates the sealers&#x27; area of interest and Dusky Sound&#x27;s place in it. The &quot;Matilda&quot; under Captain Fowler was on this part of the coast in 1814 when six of his lascar (Indian) seamen absconded in an open boat. It seems it was at Dusky Sound they were set upon by Maori when three were killed and eaten and the others enslaved. One or more of them later lived in what is now the Dunedin district. Sealers continued to visit until the late 1820s when the second sealing boom faded.

An attempt was made in 1903 to construct a road from Dusky Sound to Lake Manapouri, but it was never completed, terminating abruptly at Bishop Burn, on the western side of Loch Maree.

In December 2019, the name of the fiord was officially altered to Tamatea / Dusky Sound.

==Access==
Access to the sound is by sea or air only, with no roads reaching the coast at this point. However, the Dusky Track stretches to the upper reaches of the sound, at Supper Cove, from lakes Manapouri and Hauroko.

<doc id="1104529" wikidata="Q3041334" url="?curid=1104529" title="Dungog, New South Wales">
<text>Dungog is a country town on the Williams River in the Hunter region and a small part of the Mid North Coast region of New South Wales, Australia. Located in the middle of dairy and timber country, it is the centre of the Dungog Shire Local Government Area and at the 2021 Census it had a population of people. The area includes the Fosterton Loop, of road, used in the annual Pedalfest. A small portion of Dungog lies in the Mid-Coast Council Local Government Area.

== History ==
The traditional owners of the area now known as Dungog are the Gringai clan of the Wonnarua people, a group of Aboriginal Australian people.

By 1825 Robert Dawson had named the Barrington area, while surveyor Thomas Florance named the Chichester River in 1827. Two years later George Boyle White explored the sources of the Allyn and Williams rivers. Grants along the Williams followed to men such as Duncan Mackay, John Verge, James Dowling (later a NSW Chief Justice) and others, who, with their assigned convicts, began clearing land and building houses around a district that was by the early 1830s centred on a small settlement first known as Upper William. With a Court of Petty Sessions in 1833 and gazetted in 1838 as the village of Dungog (a local Gringai word), it had a court house, lockup and an increasing number of inns, shops and houses.

Lord Streett, as were Dowling, Mackay, Chapman, Hooke, Brown and Myles, were all named after landowners at the time surveyor Francis Rusden drew up his generous 1838 grid plan of Dungog&#x27;s streets. The descendants of some of these, notably the Dowlings, Mackays and Hookes, still live in and around Dungog. Others, such as John Lord, went bankrupt or, as did Myles, sold out early and moved to Sydney.

Dungog village gradually grew from a mere 25 houses in the 1846 Census (three of stone or brick). By 1854, four licences for publicans were granted in Dungog: James Stephenson, Dungog Inn; Joseph Finch, Settlers&#x27; Arms; Joseph Robson, Trades&#x27; Arms; and Edward Tate, Durham Hotel. Two of these continue to operate today.

The plan and street pattern of 1838 gave Dungog generous sized lots that, over the years, have allowed people to build homes with ample space in between, as well as to enjoy cow and horse paddocks close by. Before the 1920s there was relatively little building beyond Lord St. John Wilson, born in Dungog in 1854, described the town as a &#x27;sea of bush and scrub, with a house here and there&#x27;, and with bullock teams and drays having &#x27;to wend their way between stumps and saplings&#x27;. Even in 1892, at the opening of Dungog Cottage Hospital on Hospital Hill to the west, the trek up was largely through open countryside.

Boosted by the dairy industry, which began to develop in the 1890s, Dungog grew more rapidly, receiving a further boost with the arrival of the railway in 1911. Many of the finest houses and commercial buildings still to be seen here were built between the end of the nineteenth and the first two decades of the following century. Coolalie (206 Dowling St) and Coimbra (72 Dowling St), as well as the then Angus &amp; Coote, now J A Rose building (146-148 Dowling St) and the Dark stores (184-190 Dowling St) all date from this period of expansion. All, as the &quot;Dungog Chronicle&quot; continuously proclaimed, were &#x27;up to date&#x27;, and as the Dungog Chronicle also pointed out, modern improvements such as the &#x27;water service and electric light service has made Dungog a desirable place to live in&#x27;. The architects and builders used for these projects were locals; such as C H Button, Town Clerk and architect, or J A Hall, builder, as well as those from Maitland, such as architect J A Pender.

Around 1926, Dowling Street was first fully kerbed and the present alignment of the shop facades was established. Money and new businesses were entering the town at this time. While things may have slowed a little thereafter, many new buildings and houses continued to be built in the following years. The Catholic community built a new place of worship in Brown St in 1933, replacing the church that had stood in Dowling St since 1870 (where the Tall Timbers Motel now stands). In 1935 the Bank of NSW replaced its old building on the corner of Dowling and Mackay Streets with one in the, then, very modern Georgian Revival Style.

World War II was just beginning when the Dungog Chronicle reported: &quot;Recent weeks have seen a progressive building campaign in Dungog. Apart from the palatial new building for the Royal Hotel erected and furnished at a cost of some £20,000, and remodelling of the Court House Hotel and Bank Hotel, nine new residences have been completed within the past month. In addition to these works, the Education Department is clearing and grading the playing grounds at the public school, and has erected an ornate brick fence along those grounds on the Dowling-street frontage, whilst the Municipal Council has had two chains of kerbing and guttering carried out in Mary-street.&quot;

Since the 1950s, few new public buildings and shops have been erected but homes have continued to be built in weatherboard, brick, fibro or concrete; following the fashions of the time. While dairying has declined, the beef industry has remained, and although most timber is now locked up in national parks, many visitors come these days to enjoy the area&#x27;s natural beauty. This trend has also meant that numerous older homes have been saved from deterioration by &#x27;tree-changers&#x27;, who have increasingly bought and renovated older homes in Dungog and its surrounding countryside.

== Culture ==
Popular Dungog events are the Dungog Film Festival hosted at the James Theatre, the Dungog Agricultural Show, Pedalfest, the Dungog Rodeo, and the Thunderbolt Rally. Each of these events showcase local produce and talent and bring tourists to the region.

=== James Theatre ===
Dungog is the home of the James Theatre, the oldest fully enclosed purpose-built cinema continuously operating in Australia, located at 6 Brown Street. It receives new movie releases soon after cinemas in more populated areas. The Dungog Film Society has been operating from the cinema since 1992 and screens fine films monthly to locals as well as bringing Flickerfest to Dungog and an AGOG weekend of foreign films in September. The theatre is the venue for the Dungog Film Festival, which is held annually.

The theatre was first opened on land of James Stuart in December 1912. Originally an open-air theatre, it was roofed by 1914 and in 1918 an enclosed hall built. In order to accommodate &quot;talkie&quot; movies and to provide improved dance facilities, Stuart commissioned major reconstruction works that commenced in 1930. These works were designed by the Newcastle architect, William Jeater.

The reconstruction works included construction of a stage, remodelling the street façade into the Spanish Mission Style, a new dance floor, new northern entrance, a projection room above the foyer and seating arrangement for 400.

It retains the simplicity of a Picture Theatre built in a small country town during the Great Depression. The building is architecturally significant as one of only four Picture Theatres in the New South Wales with Spanish Mission Style facades. The &quot;James Theatre Dungog Community Centre&quot; has been owned by the Dungog Shire Council since 1979.

=== Dungog Film Festival ===

The Dungog Film Festival, inaugurated on 31 May 2007, was a film festival which served the dual purposes of encouraging the local tourism industry and showcasing Australian cinema. It used to take place over four days and some of the proceeds went towards preserving the James Theatre. It used to be held annually in May and was open to Australian filmmakers only. It did not operate in 2013 and in 2014 was replaced by the broader festival of the arts, the Dungog Festival, which is now held on the October Long Weekend.

In 2014, the State Government announced a three year investment to keep the Dungog Film Festival running. As of 2024 the Dungog Film Festival is no longer active.

The screenings were shown in local venues including the James Theatre and the RSL auditorium.

=== Gentlemen of the Road ===

Dungog hosted the &#x27;Gentlemen of the Road&#x27; music festival on 20 October 2012. The Gentlemen of the Road is a single performance special event organised by band Mumford and Sons, for which they select a remote town in the country they are touring and hold a day-long music festival featuring local artists and bands with which they are friends. The &quot;Dungog Stopover&quot; featured Husky, Matt Corby, Willy Mason, Sarah Blasko, Yacht Club DJs, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and headline act Mumford and Sons. Over 13,000 people attended the event held in the town&#x27;s showground. Attendees were accommodated on campgrounds at the edge of the town, while the band members and entourages stayed at motels and pubs in Dungog.

== Education ==
Dungog High School has approximately 680 students, Children from nearly all of the surrounding towns (e.g.: Clarence Town, Gresford, Paterson, Vacy, Wallarobba, Martins Creek, East Gresford, and Glen Martin) attend.

== Historical Society and museum ==
Founded in 1963, Dungog Historical Society is located in the former School of Arts building which also houses the Dungog Museum. The wide collection showcases Dungog&#x27;s history and heritage, including information and material about local aboriginalsnpeoples d family history.

The core of the display is &quot;Dungog: The Making of a Community&quot;, telling the story of Dungog via different themes. The colourful panels were produced with a grant from the NSW Ministry of the Arts. Temporary exhibitions are also held.

== Rail transport ==
The town&#x27;s railway station has been served by the North Coast railway line since 1911. The Great White Train visit in August 1926 was attended by a large crowd. There are three to four intercity Hunter Line and six long-distance NSW TrainLink XPT services from Dungog each day.

== Sport ==

<doc id="1104535" wikidata="Q4294668" url="?curid=1104535" title="Department of Agriculture and Water Resources">
<text>The Australian Government Department of Agriculture and Water Resources was a government department that existed between 2015 and 2019, which was responsible for developing and implementing policies and programs that contribute to strengthening Australia&#x27;s primary industries, delivering better returns for primary producers at the farm gate, protecting Australia from animal and plant pests and diseases, and improving the health of Australia&#x27;s rivers and freshwater ecosystems.

The Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, Daryl Quinlivan, was responsible to the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, The Hon. David Littleproud . The Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources was Senator the Hon Richard Colbeck since August 2018. The Assistant Minister to the former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce was the Hon Luke Hartsuyker MP.

Following the appointment of the Second Morrison Ministry in May 2019, Scott Morrison announced David Littleproud&#x27;s previous ministerial positions were separated, with Bridget McKenzie as Minister for Agriculture and Littleproud as Minister for Water Resources. The Department again changed to the Department of Agriculture.

==Overview==
The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources&#x27; vision was to help drive a stronger Australian economy by building a more profitable, more resilient and more sustainable agriculture sector, and by supporting the sustainable and productive management and use of rivers and water resources.

The department&#x27;s annual reports provide information about its operations and performances in each financial year, and reviews its progress towards its objectives.

The department&#x27;s Corporate Plan sets outs the department&#x27;s eight strategic objectives. Those identified in the 2016–17 plan include:
* building successful primary industries
* supporting agricultural communities
* expanding agricultural, fisheries and forestry exports
* sustaining natural resources for longer-term productive primary industries
* improving water use efficiency and the health of rivers, communities, environmental assets and production systems 
* managing biosecurity and imported food risk
* building an efficient and capable department
* being a best practice regulator.

The department strives to build strong relationships and work with governments, industry, importers and exporters, natural resource managers, primary producers, consumers, research and development organisations, rural communities and travellers.

The department employs approximately 4000 full-time equivalent staff, including accountants, animal and meat inspectors, biosecurity officers, economists, information and communication technology (ICT) staff, policy officers, program administrators, researchers, scientists, survey staff and veterinary officers.

The corporate structure is organised into divisions to support work across a broad range of agricultural, biosecurity, fisheries and forestry and water management activities.

The department is located in regional centres, rural communities and cities throughout Australia. Around 58 per cent of its Australian-based employees work outside Canberra, in capital cities and regional offices, major airports, mail centres, shipping ports, laboratories and abattoirs.

Globally, the department works in Bangkok, Beijing, Brussels, Dubai, Jakarta, New Delhi, Rome, Seoul, Tokyo and Washington, to maintain relationships with Australia&#x27;s trading partners and international organisations.

==History==
The department was formed by way of an administrative order issued on 21 September 2015, replacing the previous Department of Agriculture, following the appointment of Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister of Australia.

The department’s work is grounded in research and science, providing information and analysis on agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries, including:
* commodity forecasts
* economic analysis and modelling
* data and statistics on issues affecting Australian farmers and rural communities
* biophysical science for biosecurity risk assessment, forecasting and diagnostics.

The department collects and audits primary industry levies for marketing, research and development, animal and plant health, residue testing and emergency response.

The department works in partnership and collaboration with its clients, stakeholders, governments and the community by engaging with those who have a vested interest in the way it does business. This engagement consists of:
* public consultations on policy, program and operational proposals
* industry forums
* international delegations and international forums

<text>Harkness Roses (a trading name of R. Harkness &amp; Co. Ltd) are rose breeders based at Hitchin, Hertfordshire in England. The nursery was founded in 1879 in Yorkshire by brothers, John and Robert Harkness. Early varieties include &#x27;Mrs. Harkness&#x27;, &#x27;Frensham&#x27; and &#x27;Ena Harkness&#x27;. Jack Harkness, grandson of original co-founder, John Harkness, established the first rose hybridization program at the company in 1962, developing vigorous, healthy roses by hybridizing from wild rose species. His most successful new rose cultivars include: &#x27;Amber Queen&#x27;, &#x27;Belmonte&#x27; and &#x27;Anne Harkness&#x27;.

==History==

Harkness Roses was established in 1879 in Bedale, Yorkshire by brothers, John Harkness (1857-1933) and Robert Harkness (1851-1920). In 1882, John and Robert began to grow and exhibit roses. Their new rose business was a great success; Queen Victoria purchased her roses from Harkness &amp; Sons in the 1890s. John and Robert soon realized that Yorkshire&#x27;s climate was too cold for an expanding rose growing business. In 1892, they decided to established a branch of the firm in a location with a warmer climate. Neither brother wanted to leave Yorkshire, so it was decided by a coin toss that Robert would move to Hitchin, Hertfordshire to establish the new branch of Harkness and Sons. In 1901, John and Robert decided to dissolve the company and create two separate nurseries. Robert established R. Harkness &amp; Co, today known as Harkness Roses.

Early varieties of Harkness Roses include a sport of hybrid perpetual, &#x27;Heinrich Schultheis&#x27;, introduced in 1893 as &#x27;Mrs. Harkness&#x27;. In the 1950s, Harkness popularized &#x27;Frensham&#x27; and &#x27;Ena Harkness&#x27;, both introduced in 1946 in the United Kingdom 

Jack Harkness (1918-1994) was the grandson of the original co-founder John Harkness. He established the first rose hybridization program at the company in 1962, developing vigorous, healthy roses by hybridizing from wild rose species. Early successes were with hybrid teas, and then later with floribundas. In the 1970s he began breeding with Rosa persica, an unusual rose species with simple leaves. During his career, Harkness developed many successful rose cultivars, including &#x27;Alexander&#x27;, &#x27;Mountbatten&#x27; and &#x27;Amber Queen&#x27;. He is best known for his floribundas and hybrid tea roses.

Robert Harkness, son of Jack Harkness (1951-2012), bred more than seventy rose varieties during his career. Among his best known varieties are: Rosa &#x27;Belmonte&#x27; and &#x27;Princess of Wales&#x27;. Philip Harkness, Jack&#x27;s son and Robert&#x27;s brother continues today as co-owner of Harkness Roses.

Today Harkness Roses is run by Philip Harkness (Chairman) and David White (Managing Director) alongside their small team of horticulturists. Philip, David and their team have recently released a number of extremely popular new cultivars including ‘The Captain Tom’ rose, the ‘John Ystumllyn Rose’, ‘The Duke of Edinburgh Rose’ and ‘The Queen Elizabeth II Rose’ as well as winning a Gold Medal at Chelsea Flower Show in 2021.

Poet, Ted Hughes, worked at the nursery during the summer of 1955: &quot;The job is following round the expert as he grafts expensive rose-buds onto common bushes, and doing all the trimming and tying-up-with-raffia—a back-breaking job apparently, but outside, and with roses, and with good employers.&quot;

<text>In cognitive psychology, fast mapping is the term used for the hypothesized mental process whereby a new concept is learned (or a new hypothesis formed) based only on minimal exposure to a given unit of information (e.g., one exposure to a word in an informative context where its referent is present). Fast mapping is thought by some researchers to be particularly important during language acquisition in young children, and may serve (at least in part) to explain the prodigious rate at which children gain vocabulary. In order to successfully use the fast mapping process, a child must possess the ability to use &quot;referent selection&quot; and &quot;referent retention&quot; of a novel word. There is evidence that this can be done by children as young as two years old, even with the constraints of minimal time and several distractors. Previous research in fast mapping has also shown that children are able to retain a newly learned word for a substantial amount of time after they are subjected to the word for the first time (Carey and Bartlett, 1978). Further research by Markson and Bloom (1997), showed that children can remember a novel word a week after it was presented to them even with only one exposure to the novel word. While children have also displayed the ability to have equal recall for other types of information, such as novel facts, their ability to extend the information seems to be unique to novel words. This suggests that fast mapping is a specified mechanism for word learning. The process was first formally articulated and the term &#x27;fast mapping&#x27; coined Susan Carey and Elsa Bartlett in 1978.

== Evidence against ==
Today, there is evidence to suggest that children do not learn words through &#x27;fast mapping&#x27; but rather learn probabilistic, predictive relationships between objects and sounds that develop over time. Evidence for this comes, for example, from children&#x27;s struggles to understand color words: although infants can distinguish between basic color categories, many sighted children use color words in the same way that blind children do up until the fourth year. Typically, words such as &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;yellow&quot; appear in their vocabularies and they produce them in appropriate places in speech, but their application of individual color terms is haphazard and interchangeable. If shown a blue cup and asked its color, typical three-year-olds seem as likely to answer &quot;red&quot; as &quot;blue.&quot; These difficulties persist up until around age four, even after hundreds of explicit training trials. The inability for children to understand color stems from the cognitive process of whole object constraint. Whole object constraint is the idea that a child will understand that a novel word represents the entirety of that object. Then, if the child is presented with further novel words, they attach inferred meanings to the object. However, color is the last attribute to be considered because it explains the least about the object itself. Children&#x27;s behavior clearly indicates that they have knowledge of these words, but this knowledge is far from complete; rather it appears to be predictive, as opposed to all-or-none.

=== Alternate theories ===
An alternate theory of deriving the meaning of newly learned words by young children during language acquisition stems from John Locke&#x27;s &quot;associative proposal theory&quot;. Compared to the &quot;intentional proposal theory&quot;, associative proposal theory refers to the deduction of meaning by comparing the novel object to environmental stimuli. A study conducted by Yu &amp; Ballard (2007), introduced cross-situational learning, a method based on Locke&#x27;s theory. Cross-situational learning theory is a mechanism in which the child learns meaning of words over multiple exposures in varying contexts in an attempt to eliminate uncertainty of the word&#x27;s true meaning on an exposure-by-exposure basis.

On the other hand, more recent studies suggest that some amount of fast mapping does take place, questioning the validity of previous laboratory studies that aim to show that probabilistic learning does occur. A critique to the theory of fast mapping is how can children connect the meaning of the novel word with the novel word after just one exposure? For example, when showing a child a blue ball and saying the word &quot;blue&quot; how does the child know that the word blue explains the color of the ball, not the size, or shape? If children learn words by fast mapping, then they must use inductive reasoning to understand the meaning associated with the novel word. A popular theory to explain this inductive reasoning is that children apply word-learning constraints to the situation where a novel word is introduced. There are speculations as to why this is; Markman and Wachtel (1988) conducted a study that helps explain the possible underlying principles of fast mapping. They claim children adhere to the theories of whole-object bias, the assumption that a novel label refers to the entire object rather than its parts, color, substance or other properties, and mutual exclusivity bias, the assumption that only one label applies to each object. In their experiment, children were presented with an object that they either were familiar with or was presented with a whole object term. Markman and Watchel concluded that the mere juxtaposition between familiar and novel terms may assist in part term acquisition. In other words, children will put constraints on themselves and assume the novel term refers to the whole object in view rather than to its parts. There have been six lexical constraints proposed (reference, extendibility, object scope, categorical scope, novel name, conventionality) that guide a child&#x27;s learning of a novel word. When learning a new word children apply these constraints. However, this purposed method of constraints is not flawless. If children use these constraints there are many words that children will never learn such as actions, attributes, and parts. Studies have found that both toddlers and adults were more likely to categorize an object by its shape than its size or color.

==Cross-situational learning versus propose but verify==
The next question in fast mapping theory is how exactly is the meaning of the novel word learned? An experiment performed in October 2012 by the Department of Psychology by University of Pennsylvania, researchers attempted to determine if fast mapping occurs via cross-situational learning or by another method, &quot;Propose but verify&quot;. In cross-situational learning, listeners hear a novel word and store multiple conjectures of what the word could mean based on its situational context. Then after multiple exposures the listener is able to target the meaning of the word by ruling out conjectures. In propose but verify, the learner makes a single conjecture about the meaning of the word after hearing the word used in context. The learner then carries that conjecture forward to be reevaluated and modified for consistency when the word is used again. The results of the experiment seems to support that propose but verify is the way by which learners fast map new words.

=== Criticisms ===
There is also controversy over whether words learned by fast mapping are retained or forgotten. Previous research has found that generally, children retain a newly learned word for a period of time after learning. In the aforementioned Carey and Bartlett study (1978), children who were taught the word &quot;chromium&quot; were found to keep the new lexical entry in working memory for several days, illustrating a process of gradual lexical alignment known as &quot;extended mapping.&quot; Another study, performed by Markson and Bloom (1997), showed that children remembered words up to 1 month after the study was conducted. However, more recent studies have shown that words learned by fast mapping tend to be forgotten over time. In a study conducted by Vlach and Sandhofer (2012), memory supports, which had been included in previous studies, were removed. This removal appeared to result in a low retention of words over time. This is a possible explanation for why previous studies showed high retention of words learned by fast mapping.

Some researchers are concerned that experiments testing for fast mapping are produced in artificial settings. They feel that fast mapping doesn&#x27;t occur as often in more real life, natural situations. They believe that testing for fast mapping should focus more on the actual understanding of a word instead of just its reproduction. For some, testing to see if the child can use the new word in a different situation constitutes true knowledge of a word, rather than simply identifying the new word.

== Variables affecting an individual&#x27;s fast mapping ability==

=== Bilingualism ===

When learning novel words, it is believed that early exposure to multiple linguistic systems facilitates the acquisition of new words later in life. This effect was referred to by Kaushanskaya and Marian (2009) as the bilingual advantage. That being said, a bilingual individual&#x27;s ability to fast map can vary greatly throughout their life.

During the language acquisition process, a child may require a greater amount of time to determine a correct referent than a child who is a monolingual speaker. By the time a bilingual child is of school age, they perform equally on naming tasks when compared to monolingual children. By the age of adulthood, bilingual individuals have acquired word-learning strategies believed to be of assistance on fast mapping tasks. One example is speech practice, a strategy where the participant listens and reproduces the word in order to assist in remembering and decrease the likelihood of forgetting .
Bilingualism can increase an individual&#x27;s cognitive abilities and contribute to their success in fast mapping words, even when they are using a nonnative language.

=== Socioeconomic status ===

Children growing up in a low-socioeconomic status environment receive less attention than those in high-socioeconomic status environments. As a result, these children may be exposed to fewer words and therefore their language development may suffer. On norm-references vocabulary tests, children from low- socioeconomic homes tend to score lower than same-age children from a high-socioeconomic environment. However, when examining their fast mapping abilities there were no significant differences observed in their ability to learn and remember novel words. Children from low SES families were able to use multiple sources of information in order to fast map novel words. When working with children from low SES homes, providing a context of the word that attributes meaning, is a linguistic strategy that can benefit the child&#x27;s word knowledge development.

=== Face-to-face interaction ===
Three learning supports that have been proven to help with the fast mapping of words are saliency, repetition and generation of information. The amount of face-to-face interaction a child has with their parent affects his or her ability to fast map novel words. Interaction with a parent leads to greater exposure to words in different contexts, which in turn promotes language acquisition. Face to face interaction cannot be replaced by educational shows because although repetition is used, children do not receive the same level of correction or trial and error from simply watching. When a child is asked to generate the word it promotes the transition to long-term memory to a larger extent.

== Evidence of fast mapping in other animals ==
It appears that fast mapping is not only limited to humans, but can occur in dogs as well.

The first example of fast mapping in dogs was published in 2004. In it, a dog named Rico was able to learn the labels of over 200 various items. He was also able to identify novel objects simply by exclusion learning. Exclusion learning occurs when one learns the name of a novel object because one is already familiar with the names of other objects belonging to the same group. The researchers, who conducted the experiment, mention the possibility that a language acquisition device specific to humans does not control fast mapping. They believe that fast mapping is possibly directed by simple memory mechanisms.

In 2010, a second example was published. This time, a dog named Chaser demonstrated, in a controlled research environment, that she had learned over 1000 object names. She also demonstrated that she could attribute these objects to named categories through fast mapping inferential reasoning. It&#x27;s important to note that, at the time of publication, Chaser was still learning object names at the same pace as before. Thus, her 1000 words, or lexicals, should not be regarded as an upper limit, but a benchmark. While there are many components of language that were not demonstrated in this study, the 1000 word benchmark is remarkable because many studies on language learning correlate a 1000 lexical vocabulary with, roughly, 75% spoken language comprehension.

Another study on Chaser was published in 2013. In this study, Chaser demonstrated flexible understanding of simple sentences. In these sentences, syntax was altered in various contexts to prove she had not just memorized full phrases or inferred the expectation through gestures from her evaluators. Discovering this skill in a dog is noteworthy on its own, but verb meaning can be fast mapped through syntax. This creates questions about what parts of speech dogs could infer, as previous studies focused on nouns. These findings create further questions about the fast mapping abilities of dogs when viewed in light of a study published in Science in 2016 that proved dogs process lexical and intonational cues separately. That is, they respond to both tone and word meaning.

However, excitement about the fast-mapping skills of dogs should be tempered. Research in humans has found fast-mapping abilities and vocabulary size are not correlated in unenriched environments. Research has determined that language exposure alone is not enough to develop vocabulary through fast-mapping. Instead, the learner needs to be an active participant in communications to convert fast-mapping abilities into vocabulary.

It is not commonplace to communicate with dogs, nor any non-primate animal, in a productive fashion as they are non-verbal. As such, Chaser&#x27;s vocabulary and sentence comprehension is attributed to Dr. Pilley&#x27;s rigorous methodology.

== In the deaf population ==
A study by Lederberg et al., was performed to determine if deaf and hard of hearing children fast map to learn novel words. In the study, when the novel word was introduced, the word was both spoken and signed. Then the children were asked to identify the referent object and even extend the novel word to identify a similar object. The results of the study indicated that deaf and hard of hearing children do perform fast mapping to learn novel words. However, compared to children with normal hearing (aging toddlers to 5 years old) the deaf and hard of hearing children did not fast map as accurately and successfully. The results showed a slight delay which disappeared as the children were a maximum of 5 years old. The conclusion that was drawn from the study is that the ability to fast map has a relationship to the size of the lexicon. The children with normal hearing had a larger lexicon and therefore were able to more accurately fast map compared to deaf and hard of hearing children who did not have as large of a lexicon. It is by around age 5 that deaf and hard of hearing children have a similar size lexicon to 5-year-old children of normal hearing. This evidence supports the idea that fast mapping requires inductive reasoning so the larger the lexicon (number of known words) the easier it is for the child to reason out the accurate meaning for the novel word.

In the area of cochlear implants (CIs), there are variegated opinions on whether cochlear implants impact a child&#x27;s ability to become a more successful fast mapper. In 2000, a study by Kirk, Myomoto, and others determined that there was a general correlation between the age of Cochlear Implant implementation and improved lexical skills (e.g. fast mapping and other vocabulary growth skills). They believed that children given implants prior to two years of age yielded higher success rates than older children between five and seven years of age. With that said, researchers at the University of Iowa wish to amend that very generalization. In 2013, &quot;Word Learning Processes in Children with Cochlear Implants&quot; by Elizabeth Walker and others indicated that although there may be some levels of increased vocabulary acquisition in CI individuals, many post-implantees generally were slower developers of his/her own lexicon. Walker bases her claims on another research study in 2007 (Tomblin et al.) One of the purposes of this study was to note a CI child&#x27;s ability to comprehend and retain novel words with related referents. When compared with non-deaf children, the CI children had lower success scores in retention. This finding was based on scorings obtained from their test: from 0 to 6 (0 the worst, 6 the best), CI children averaged a score around a 2.0 whereas non-deaf children scored higher (roughly 3.86).

==In individuals with ADHD==
An experiment was performed to assess fast mapping in adults with typical language abilities, disorders of spoken/written language (hDSWL), and adults with hDSWL and ADHD. 
The conclusion draws from the experiment revealed that adults with ADHD were the least accurate at &quot;mapping semantic features and slower to respond to lexical labels.&quot; 
The article reasoned that the tasks of fast mapping requires high attentional demand and so &quot;a lapse in attention could lead to diminished encoding of the new information.&quot;

==In individuals with language deficits==

Fast mapping in individuals with aphasia has gained research attention due to its effect on speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Research done by Blumstein makes an important distinction between those with Broca&#x27;s aphasia, who are limited in physical speech, as compared to those with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia, who cannot link words with meaning. In Broca&#x27;s aphasia, Blumstein found that whereas individuals with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia performed at the same level as the normal control group, those with Broca&#x27;s aphasia showed slower reaction times for word presentations after reduced voice onset time stimuli. In short, when stimuli were acoustically altered, individuals with Broca&#x27;s aphasia experienced difficulty recognizing the novel stimuli upon second presentation. Bloomstein&#x27;s findings reinforce the crucial difference between one&#x27;s ability to retain novel stimuli versus the ability to express novel stimuli. Because individuals with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia are only limited in their understanding of semantic meaning, it makes sense that the participant&#x27;s novel stimulus recall would not be affected. On the other hand, those with Broca&#x27;s aphasia lack the ability to produce speech, in effect hindering their ability to recall novel stimuli. Although individuals with Broca&#x27;s aphasia are limited in their speech production, it is not clear whether they simply cannot formulate the physical speech or if they actually did not process the stimuli.

Research has also been done investigating fast mapping abilities in children with language deficits. One study done by Dollaghan compared children with normal language to those with expressive syntactic deficits, a type of specific language impairment characterized by simplified speech. The study found that normal and language impaired children did not differ in their ability to connect the novel word to referent or to comprehend the novel word after a single exposure. The only difference was that the language-impaired children were less successful in their production of the novel word. This implies that expressive language deficits are unrelated to the ability to connect word and referent in a single exposure. The problem for children with those deficits arises only when trying to convert that mental representation into verbal speech.

==In individuals with intellectual disabilities==
A few researchers looked at fast mapping abilities in boys with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), also referred to as autism spectrum, and boys with fragile X syndrome (FXS). The experimental procedure consisted of a presentation phase where two objects were presented, one of which was a novel object with a nonsense word name. This was followed by a comprehension testing phase, which assessed the boys&#x27; ability to remember and correctly select the novel objects. Even though all groups in the study had fast mapping performances above chance levels, in comparison to boys showing typical development, those with ASD and FXS demonstrated much more difficulty in comprehending and remembering names assigned to the novel objects. The authors concluded that initial processes involved in associative learning, such as fast mapping, are hindered in boys with FXS and ASD.

==Computational models==
Research in artificial intelligence and machine learning to reproduce computationally this ability, termed one-shot learning. This is pursued to reduce the learning curve, as other models like reinforcement learning need thousand of exposures to a situation to learn it.

<text>The 1992 United States Senate elections, held November 3, 1992, were elections for the United States Senate. The 34 seats of Class 3 were contested in regular elections, along with special elections to fill vacancies. They coincided with Bill Clinton&#x27;s victory in the presidential election. This was the first time since 1956 that the balance of the Senate remained the same.

Both parties swapped a pair of seats, resulting in no net change in the partisan breakdown, which had been at 57–43 since Democrats flipped a seat in Pennsylvania in a special election. Democratic victories over Republicans John F. Seymour in the special California race and Bob Kasten in Wisconsin were canceled out by the defeats of Democrats Wyche Fowler in Georgia and Terry Sanford in North Carolina.

The election of 4 new Democratic women to the Senate was notable with it being referred to in the press as the &quot;Year of the Woman&quot;. Due to a special election in California, both of California&#x27;s Senate seats were up for election in 1992, and these seats were won by Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. Thus, California became the first state to have elected women to occupy both of its Senate seats. Democrat Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, became the first African-American woman in the United States Senate. , this was the last election cycle in which Republicans won a Senate election in New York and Democrats in Kentucky.

==Results summary==
&quot;Seat totals include both the special elections in California and North Dakota, but vote totals exclude the North Dakota total.&quot;

All of the elections involved the Class 3 seats.

== Closest races ==

In thirteen races, the margin of victory was under 10%.

Illinois was the tipping point state, decided by a margin of 10%.

== Alabama ==

Incumbent Democrat Richard Shelby won re-election to a second term, beating Richard Sellers, a conservative activist.





== Alaska ==

Incumbent Republican Frank Murkowski sought re-election to a third term in the United States Senate. Tony Smith, the Democratic nominee and a former Commissioner of Economic Development, won his party&#x27;s nomination in a crowded primary and faced off against Murkowski in the general election. Though Murkowski was held to a lower vote percentage than he received six years prior, he was ultimately re-elected.










== Arizona ==

Incumbent Republican John McCain won re-election to a second term over Democrat Claire Sargent, community activist and Independent former Governor Evan Mecham.





== Arkansas ==

Incumbent Democratic senator Dale Bumpers won re-election to a fourth term. His Republican opponent was future Arkansas lieutenant governor, governor, and two-time presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, a church pastor from Texarkana.

The 1992 election coincided with Arkansas governor Bill Clinton&#x27;s election as President of the United States, in which he also won his home state. In contrast with Bumpers&#x27; landslide where he won over 60% of the vote, Clinton won only 53.21% of the vote. Bumpers would serve another term in the U.S. Senate before deciding to retire in 1998.



== California ==

Due to the resignation of Pete Wilson to become Governor of California, there were two senate elections in California as both seats were up for election and both won by women. California ultimately become the first state to have two sitting women senators.

=== California (regular) ===

Incumbent Democrat Alan Cranston decided to retire. Democratic U.S. Congresswoman Barbara Boxer won the open seat over Republican conservative TV talk show commentator Bruce Herschensohn. Both of California&#x27;s senators were elected for the first time. This is not a unique occurrence; it would happen again in Tennessee in 1994, Kansas in 1996 and Georgia in 2020-2021. Fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein, California&#x27;s other senator, won the special election and was inaugurated in November 1992.

The election between Boxer and Herschensohn was very close. At the eleventh hour, controversy emerged that the Republican nominee attended a strip club, which some Republican operatives later blamed for Herschensohn&#x27;s loss.

Four days before Election Day polls showed Herschensohn had narrowed a double digit deficit, trailing by 3 points. Political operative Bob Mulholland disrupted a campaign appearance with a large poster advertising a strip club shouting &quot;Should the voters of California elect someone who frequently travels the strip joints of Hollywood?&quot; Herschensohn admitted he had visited a strip club once, with his girlfriend and another couple. With press coverage of the story, Herschensohn spent the waning days of the campaign denying related allegations. When the votes were cast and counted, Barbara Boxer won the election by five points. Although Republicans have blamed the defeat on the underhanded tactics of the Boxer campaign, evidence of the connection between Mulholland&#x27;s outburst and the campaign never surfaced.

The election was very close. Boxer was declared the winner by the Associated Press at 1:22 A.M. Pacific Coast Time.





=== California (special) ===


In the 1990 gubernatorial election, Republican senator Pete Wilson had beaten Democrat Dianne Feinstein for governor. He appointed John F. Seymour to the Senate to replace himself. In this special election held simultaneously with the regular Senate election, Feinstein defeated Seymour to serve the remaining 2 years of the term and took office November 4, only 1 day after the election. Fellow Democrat Barbara Boxer won the regular election and was sworn in in January 1993.

Both of California&#x27;s senators were elected for the first time. This is not a unique occurrence; it would happen again in Tennessee in 1994, Kansas in 1996, and Georgia in 2020.






== Colorado ==

Incumbent Democrat Tim Wirth decided to retire instead of seeking a second term. Democratic congressman Ben Nighthorse Campbell won the open seat, beating Republican State senator Terry Considine.








== Connecticut ==

Incumbent Democrat Christopher Dodd won re-election for a third term over Republican businessman Brook Johnson.

Johnson, a millionaire businessman who had never run for public office before, spent about $900,000 during the primary campaign. His television and radio commercials said that he would bring &quot;a dose of success Washington needs.&quot; Dodd had $2 million cash on hand following the primaries.




== Florida ==

Incumbent Democrat Bob Graham won re-election to a second term, beating Republican former U.S. Representative Bill Grant.




Graham defeated Grant in a landslide, as Grant won just one county in the state (Okaloosa County, Florida). There were no third party or independent candidates.
 



== Georgia ==

Incumbent Democrat Wyche Fowler did not receive a simple majority in the general election, which demanded a runoff. Paul Coverdell, former Director of the Peace Corps and former State senator, edged out Fowler in the runoff with a narrow margin.

The general primary was held July 21, 1992. A run-off between the top two Republican contenders was held on August 11, in which Paul Coverdell defeated Bob Barr.

Results for the first round showed that since Paul Coverdell did not win a majority of the vote, a runoff was held between him and Barr. Coverdell subsequently won the runoff.









As no candidate reached a majority on November 3, a runoff election was held on November 24, which Coverdell won.



== Hawaii ==

Incumbent Democrat Daniel Inouye won re-election to a sixth term over Republican State senator Rick Reed.





== Idaho ==

Incumbent Republican Steve Symms decided to retire instead of seeking a third term. Republican Mayor of Boise Dirk Kempthorne won the open seat, beating Democratic congressman Richard H. Stallings.








== Illinois ==

Incumbent Democrat Alan J. Dixon decided to run for re-election a third term, but was defeated in the primary against Carol Moseley Braun, Cook County Recorder of Deeds and former State Representative, who then won the general election over Republican Richard S. Williamson, former Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs. Braun (whose victory coincided with Bill Clinton&#x27;s win in the presidential election and Illinois) made history in this election by becoming the first African-American woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate, and also the first African-American elected to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat.



This defeat shocked observers; at the time no senator had been defeated in a primary in over a decade and Dixon had a long record of electoral success. He was a moderate Democrat, who recently voted to confirm Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. Braun, a black woman and known reformist liberal, got a large share of black, liberal, and women voters (&quot;The Year of the Woman&quot;).

In addition, she carried Cook County, Illinois, by far the most populated county in the state. Another factor was the third candidate in the race, multi-millionaire attorney Al Hofeld. Hofeld drew away some of the moderate and conservative Democrats who normally supported Dixon. He also spent a lot of money running advertisements attacking Dixon, weakening his support.

Moseley Braun won the 1992 Illinois Senate Race by a fairly comfortable margin. Moseley Braun did well as expected in Cook County home of Chicago. Williamson did well in the Chicago collar counties, and most northern parts of the state. Moseley Braun had a surprisingly strong showing in southern Illinois, which Republicans had come to dominate in the last several decades. Braun also did well in Rock Island County.






== Indiana ==

Incumbent Republican Dan Coats won re-election to his first full term, beating the Democratic Indiana Secretary of State Joe Hogsett.

When incumbent Republican Dan Quayle resigned from the Senate after being elected Vice President of the United States in 1988, Coats was appointed to Quayle&#x27;s former seat. He then won election to serve the remainder of the term in 1990.




Coats won 79 of Indiana&#x27;s counties compared to 13 for Hogsett.

== Iowa ==

Incumbent Republican Chuck Grassley ran for re-election to a third term in the United States Senate, which he won easily against his Democratic opponent, State senator Jean Hall Lloyd-Jones.










== Kansas ==

Incumbent Republican senator Bob Dole won re-election to a fifth term, defeating Democratic nominee Gloria O&#x27;Dell, teacher and former journalist. Nearly two decades after his failed vice-presidential bid in 1976, this would be Dole&#x27;s last election to the Senate. He would resign in 1996 while running for President of the United States. Dole also became the Republican Leader of the United States Senate seven years prior.





== Kentucky ==

Incumbent Democratic U.S. senator Wendell Ford won re-election to a fourth term, easily beating Republican State senator David L. Williams. , this was the last Senate election in Kentucky in which a Democrat won.

Denny Ormerod, a machinist from Louisville dropped out before the primary election. Though Williams and Thompson represented opposing factions in the state Republican Party – Williams managed Larry Hopkins&#x27; 1991 primary campaign while Thompson worked full-time for Hopkins&#x27; primary opponent Larry Forgy – the two virtually ignored each other in the primary campaign, choosing instead to focus their rhetoric against Ford. Thompson did question Williams&#x27; conservative credentials on grounds that he voted in favor of the tax increase associated with the Kentucky Education Reform Act. Ormerod&#x27;s campaign largely focused on socially conservative issues, but it was Williams who secured the endorsement of Kentucky Right to Life, who cited his lawsuit to free three anti-abortion bills from committee in the 1992 legislative session. As a result of the largely uninspiring primary campaigns, there was only an 18% voter turnout in the Republican primary. Williams won the nomination.



Ford, the Senate Majority Whip and a former governor, raised $2.4 million for his campaign, about eight times the amount Williams raised. Given his limited finances, Williams relied on news conferences and interviews on small town radio stations to get his message out. Williams repeatedly lamented that Ford would not agree to a formal debate; Ford said that could not be arranged because Congress was still in session and he needed to be in Washington. During the campaign, Williams attempted to paint Ford as too liberal for Kentucky voters, citing his votes against the Gulf War and Clarence Thomas&#x27; confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court. Both candidates declared their support for a Balanced Budget Amendment, but Williams said that Ford&#x27;s support of pork barrel projects for the state and a procedural vote that kept the amendment from a vote in 1991 were evidence that Ford&#x27;s support was not genuine.

Ford had no trouble winning on election night. Ford won easily, despite the fact that fellow Democrat Bill Clinton was not declared the winner of the presidential race in Kentucky until around 10:00 E.S.T. Ford pulled big margins out of the majority of Kentucky&#x27;s 124 counties. This would be Ford&#x27;s last term in the senate. He served his final term from January 3, 1993, to January 3, 1999. Ford died some fifteen years after his retirement at the age of 90.



== Louisiana ==

Incumbent Democrat John Breaux won a majority in Louisiana&#x27;s jungle primary on October 3, 1992, winning re-election to another term.




== Maryland ==

Incumbent Democrat Barbara Mikulski won re-election to a second term over Republican Alan Keyes, former Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs.













== Missouri ==

Incumbent Republican Kit Bond won re-election to a second term over Democratic St. Louis County Councilwoman Geri Rothman-Serot.




== Nevada ==

Although nearly 10% of the electorate voted for neither of the two major U.S. political parties, incumbent Democrat Harry Reid ultimately beat Republican cattle rancher and President of Nevada Cattlemen&#x27;s Association Demar Dahl.






== New Hampshire ==

Incumbent Republican Warren Rudman decided to retire. Republican Governor Judd Gregg won the open seat, beating Democrat John Rauh, former CEO of Griffon Corporation.





== New York ==

Incumbent Republican Al D&#x27;Amato won re-election to a third term over Democrat Robert Abrams, New York State Attorney General and former Borough president of the Bronx. , this was the last Senate election in New York won by a Republican.

Early in the campaign, environmentalist attorney, Laurance S. Rockefeller, Jr. nephew of the former governor Nelson, tried to challenge D&#x27;Amato in the Republican primary, but fell short of the required signatures to get onto the primary ballot. D&#x27;Amato summarily went unchallenged.

The Democratic primary campaign featured State Attorney General Robert Abrams, former U.S. Congresswoman and 1984 vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, Reverend Al Sharpton, Congressman Robert J. Mrazek, and New York City Comptroller and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. Abrams was considered the early front-runner. Ferraro emphasized her career as a teacher, prosecutor, congresswoman, and mother, and talked about how she was tough on crime. Ferraro drew attacks from the media and her opponents over her husband John Zaccaro&#x27;s finances and business relationships.

Ferraro became the front-runner, capitalizing on her star power from 1984 and using the campaign attacks against her as an explicitly feminist rallying point for women voters. As the primary date neared, her lead began to dwindle under the charges, and she released additional tax returns from the 1980s to try to defray the attacks. Holtzman ran a negative ad accusing Ferraro and Zaccaro of taking more than $300,000 in rent in the 1980s from a pornographer with purported ties to organized crime. The final debates were nasty, and Holtzman in particular constantly attacked Ferraro&#x27;s integrity and finances. In an unusual election-eve television broadcast, Ferraro talked about the ethnic slurs made against her as an Italian-American. In the September 15, 1992 primary, Abrams edged out Ferraro by less than percentage point, winning 37 percent of the vote to 36 percent. Ferraro did not concede she had lost for two weeks.

After Abrams emerged as the nominee, the Democrats remained divided. In particular, Abrams spent much of the remainder of the campaign trying to get Ferraro&#x27;s endorsement. Ferraro, enraged and bitter after the nature of the primary, ignored Abrams and accepted Bill Clinton&#x27;s request to campaign for his presidential bid instead. She was eventually persuaded by state party leaders into giving an unenthusiastic endorsement with just three days to go before the general election, in exchange for an apology by Abrams for the tone of the primary.

Abrams was also criticized for calling D&#x27;Amato a fascist, and he narrowly lost the general election as a result of these controversies.






== North Carolina ==

Incumbent Democrat Terry Sanford lost re-election to a second term to Republican Lauch Faircloth, former State Secretary of Commerce.



In 1990, after 40 years as a Democrat, Faircloth switched his party registration and began preparations to seek the Republican Senate nomination in 1992. Enjoying the support of senator Jesse Helms&#x27;s political organization, Faircloth defeated Charlotte mayor Sue Myrick and former congressman Walter E. Johnston, III in the primary. His opponent in the general election was his former ally, Terry Sanford. Although Sanford had helped Faircloth raise money for his failed gubernatorial bid in 1984, he angered Faircloth two years later when he allegedly dismissed Faircloth&#x27;s chances in a statewide contest if the two ran against each other for the Democratic nomination for the Senate. Faircloth withdrew from the 1986 race after Sanford &quot;blindsided&quot; him by announcing his candidacy.

Faircloth attacked Sanford as a tax-and-spend liberal, and despite a poor performance in a September televised debate, Faircloth won the seat by a 100,000-vote margin. Sanford may have been weakened by his unpopular vote against authorizing military force in the Persian Gulf War, and he suffered health problems in the summer of 1992.




== North Dakota ==

Due to the death of Quentin Burdick in September of that year, there were two senate elections in North Dakota.

=== North Dakota (regular) ===

Incumbent North Dakota Democratic NPL Party incumbent Kent Conrad retired, having given a pledge that he would not run for re-election if the federal budget deficit was higher than when he was first elected; however when the other Senate seat became vacant, he ran in the special election. Dem-NPL U.S. Congressman Byron Dorgan won the open seat, beating Republican Steve Sydness, CEO of Endurance International Group.





=== North Dakota (special) ===

The special election was held December 4, 1992 to fill the United States Senate seat vacated by the late Quentin Burdick. Burdick&#x27;s widow, Jocelyn Burdick, was appointed as a temporary replacement until the election was held. Dem-NPLer Kent Conrad, who held North Dakota&#x27;s other senate seat for one term since 1986, had not run for re-election to his own seat, holding himself to a campaign promise pledging to reduce the federal deficit. U.S. senator Kent Conrad won the election over Republican State Representative Jack Dalrymple.

Burdick&#x27;s death provided an opportunity for Conrad to return to the Senate in a fight for an open seat. However, some, particularly his political opponents, saw this as a breach of his promise in spirit if not letter, Conrad&#x27;s high approval ratings as senator carried through to a victory against Republican state legislator Jack Dalrymple.




== Ohio ==

Incumbent Democrat John Glenn won re-election to a fourth term, coinciding with Bill Clinton&#x27;s narrow win during the presidential election. Glenn&#x27;s voting percentage of 51% over Republican Lieutenant Governor of Ohio Mike DeWine represented the worst performance of his four runs for the Senate, likely due to the presence of third-party candidate Martha Grevatt of the far-left Workers World Party. , this is the last time the Democrats have won the Class 3 Senate Seat from Ohio.




== Oklahoma ==

Incumbent Republican Don Nickles won re-election to his third term, beating Democratic former State Representative Steve Lewis.





== Oregon ==

Incumbent Republican Bob Packwood won re-election to his fifth term.

As the election season got underway, analysts from both major parties predicted that Packwood would have one of the toughest seats to defend in what was anticipated to be a volatile election year. Packwood was regarded as one of the nation&#x27;s &quot;most powerful elected officials&quot; with &quot;extraordinary political instincts.&quot; But the state&#x27;s largest newspaper, &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, had described AuCoin (Packwood&#x27;s presumed main challenger) as having &quot;persistence, imagination and clout [that] have made him the most powerful congressman in Oregon and one of the most influential members from the Northwest.&quot;

For AuCoin, however, first came the Democratic primary. He faced Portland attorney Joe Wetzel and Bend businessman Harry Lonsdale in what became a &quot;brutal, bitter&quot; contest. Lonsdale, who had run a close race against incumbent Mark Hatfield for Oregon&#x27;s other Senate seat in 1990, emerged as AuCoin&#x27;s principal rival; Wetzel, who criticized Packwood and AuCoin as long-term, ineffective members of Congress, trailed throughout the race, and was not invited to an April debate sponsored by the City Club of Portland. Lonsdale took on &quot;the Les AuCoin-Mark Hatfield-Bob Packwood coalition&quot; as his primary cause, stating &quot;I consider Les AuCoin a good man who has been corrupted by PAC money over the years&quot;.

In a race the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; called &quot;as negative as many voters can remember,&quot; Lonsdale attacked AuCoin as &quot;corrupt&quot; and tied to the timber industry. Lonsdale&#x27;s environmental credentials also came under scrutiny, and AuCoin noted Lonsdale&#x27;s reversal of support for nuclear power and belated opposition to the re-opening of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant. AuCoin turned accusations of undue influence back on Lonsdale, pointing out that his company (Bend Research) had received millions in federal defense contracts.

Even during the primary, Packwood and AuCoin traded barbs on various issues. Packwood joined Lonsdale in criticizing AuCoin for his involvement in what was reported as a rash of check-bouncing among members of Congress; AuCoin characterized the issue as a series of mistakes, rather than gross abuses. In what was believed to be an unprecedented move, Packwood attempted to influence the Democratic primary&#x27;s outcome by running television ads against AuCoin.

Ultimately, the results of the Democratic primary were so close that an automatic recount was triggered. AuCoin held a news conference on May 23 in the South Park Blocks stating he would wait for the recount, but the margin was currently 248 votes in his favor. On June 18, over a month after the primary election, AuCoin was certified as having won by 330 votes. Upon conceding the race, Lonsdale pondered mounting a write-in campaign, reiterating that Oregon needed an &quot;outsider&quot; in the Senate.




Packwood had gone through a divorce in 1991, and his ex-wife threatened to run against him amid mounting concerns about his &quot;eye for the ladies.&quot; The socially conservative Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA) was at the apex of its statewide prominence with 1992&#x27;s anti-gay Measure 9 and its newly formed American Heritage Party (AHP). The group endorsed Republican challenger Joe Lutz, who had run against Packwood in the past on a family values platform; but Lutz soon withdrew, announcing a divorce of his own. As early as January, the OCA considered backing former gubernatorial candidate Al Mobley as an independent or as a member of the AHP. Mobley ultimately decided in mid-August not to run, stating that he could not bear the idea that he might be responsible for causing AuCoin to be elected. Packwood&#x27;s most significant challenge thus came from little-known conservative Medford attorney John DeZell, who campaigned on the family values issue. Packwood cruised to victory over DeZell and several other candidates.



By the end of June, when the recount was complete, AuCoin was nearly out of campaign funds; Packwood entered the general election race with $3.2 million and was ranked sixth nationwide among senators raising funds outside their home state during the 1990–1992 election season.

AuCoin opposed weakening the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to erase the Northern Spotted Owl&#x27;s impact on the timber industry, but Packwood (“one of the timber industry’s chief allies,” according to Oregon State University political scientist William Lunch) assailed “environmental extremists” and introduced legislation to convene a presidential cabinet committee to exempt the endangered owl from the ESA.

In September, Packwood pulled ads that had falsely criticized AuCoin for missing votes while speaking to special interest groups. By October, Packwood had raised $8 million, spending $5.4 million more than AuCoin, and leading all Senate incumbents. Yet that fall, the two candidates were in a dead heat, with Packwood continuing to criticize AuCoin on attendance, his House bank account and the spotted owl, and AuCoin echoing the campaign of popular Presidential candidate Bill Clinton by accusing Packwood of favoring the wealthy over the middle class.

The outcome of the bruising race was too close to call on election night, but on the following day, Packwood emerged as the winner with about 52% of the vote to AuCoin&#x27;s 47. In his victory press conference, Packwood endorsed AuCoin for Secretary of the Interior in the Clinton administration. When told of Packwood&#x27;s comments, AuCoin responded by saying &quot;I think that&#x27;s real special.&quot;





== Pennsylvania ==

Incumbent Republican Arlen Specter won re-election to a third term over Democratic millionaire Lynn Yeakel director of women&#x27;s studies at Drexel University College of Medicine and daughter of former U.S. Congressman Porter Hardy of Virginia (from Montgomery County).

Despite his powerful position in the Senate, Specter had numerous problems entering the election. A moderate who generally received only tepid support from his party&#x27;s conservative wing, he was criticized by the right for opposing Ronald Reagan&#x27;s nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. Specter subsequently faced a primary challenge from an ultra-conservative State Representative named Stephen Freind; although the incumbent won handily, the battle was expensive and featured many damaging attack ads. The senator was also highly targeted by women&#x27;s groups for his involvement in the Clarence Thomas proceedings; in his questioning of Anita Hill, Specter appeared to show no sympathy for her allegations of sexual harassment. Furthermore, President Bush&#x27;s popularity was rapidly declining in the state over high unemployment rates and was subsequently dragging down Republican candidates.

Yeakel won the five-way primary with 45% of the vote, easily defeating the endorsed candidate, Lieutenant Governor Mark Singel, in an election cycle dubbed by pundits as the &quot;year of the woman.&quot; Polls put her ahead of Specter by double digits. But Specter ran a campaign that was praised by political analysts for being almost flawless. Despite Yeakel&#x27;s personal wealth, her inexperience in politics led to fund raising problems; in turn, Specter ran television ads long before the Democrat. The moderate Specter portrayed Yeakel, despite her liberal attitude, as a member of an elitist blue-blood family; he emphasized her father&#x27;s votes against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 while in Congress, her affiliation with an all-white country club, and her church&#x27;s minister&#x27;s vocal criticism of the Israeli government.

Despite her mistakes, including a frequent tendency to mispronounce the names of places in which she was campaigning, Yeakel continued to perform solidly, and on Election Day, she captured by large numbers the traditional Democratic strongholds of the state, such as Pittsburgh, Scranton, and Erie. However, Specter undercut Yeakel&#x27;s support in the state&#x27;s most critical Democratic county: Philadelphia. Specter campaigned hard in black neighborhoods and received the endorsement of the NAACP. Furthermore, he capitalized on the ambivalence of many Philadelphia Democratic leaders to Yeakel, a self-described reform candidate; as a result, the hugely Democratic city featured a higher than anticipated vote for Specter. Also critical to the campaign was Specter&#x27;s grassroots involvement in Yeakel&#x27;s base, the traditionally GOP but Democratic-trending suburbs of Philadelphia.




== South Carolina ==

Incumbent Democrat Fritz Hollings won re-election to his fifth full term, over Republican former Congressman Thomas Hartnett.



The race between Hollings and Hartnett was between two politicians from the Lowcoutry. Hartnett attacked Hollings for co-sponsoring a bill in 1983 that would have outlawed discrimination against homosexuals and Hollings shot back about questions of Hartnett&#x27;s integrity for pushing for military contracts with a firm he had ties with in North Charleston. The anti-incumbency mood helped to bring Hartnett close to topping Hollings in the general election, but South Carolina voters traditionally support their incumbent politicians and Hollings was elected for another six-year term, albeit with a much reduced margin.




== South Dakota ==

Incumbent Democrat Tom Daschle won re-election to a second term, beating Republican educator Charlene Haar.





== Utah ==

Incumbent Republican Jake Garn decided to retire instead of seeking a fourth term. Republican Bob Bennett won the open seat over Democratic congressman Wayne Owens.




== Vermont ==

Incumbent Democrat Patrick Leahy won re-election to a fourth term, beating Republican Secretary of State of Vermont Jim Douglas.











== Washington ==

Serving one term, incumbent senator Brock Adams was strongly supportive of his party&#x27;s leadership. In 1992 he chose not to be a candidate for re-election after eight women made statements to &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; alleging that Adams had committed various acts of sexual misconduct, ranging from sexual harassment to rape. Adams denied the allegations, but his popularity statewide was weakened considerably by the scandal and he chose to retire rather than risk losing the seat for his party. Chandler seemed to have the upper hand in one of the debates until for some unknown reason he quoted the Roger Miller song &quot;Dang Me.&quot; He was further damaged by the unpopularity of President George H.W. Bush in the Pacific Northwest.



== Wisconsin ==

Incumbent Republican Bob Kasten ran for re-election to a third term, but was defeated by Democratic State senator Russ Feingold.

Feingold, who had little name recognition in the state and was campaigning in a primary against a pair of millionaire opponents, U.S. Congressman Jim Moody and Milwaukee businessman Joe Checota, adopted several proposals to gain the electorate&#x27;s attention. The most memorable of these was a series of five promises written on Feingold&#x27;s garage door in the form of a contract. Also noted was Feingold&#x27;s advertising campaign, which was widely compared to that used by progressive candidate Paul Wellstone in his victorious Senate campaign in Minnesota. Shot in the form of home movies, the ads attempted to portray Feingold, who always referred to himself as &quot;the underdog running for U.S. senate,&quot; as a down-to-earth, Capra-esque figure, taking the audience on a guided tour of the candidate&#x27;s home and introducing them to his children, all of whom were enrolled in public school.

The ads also contained a significant amount of humor. One featured Feingold meeting with an Elvis Presley impersonator, who offered Feingold his endorsement. (Bob Kasten responded to the Elvis endorsement with an advertisement featuring an Elvis impersonator attacking Feingold&#x27;s record.) Another showed Feingold standing next to a pair of half-sized cardboard cut-outs of his opponents, refusing to &quot;stoop to their level&quot; as the two were shown literally slinging mud at one another.

During the primary campaign, Feingold unveiled an 82-point plan that aimed to eliminate the deficit by the end of his first term. The plan, which called for, among other things, a raise in taxes and cuts in the defense budget, was derided as &quot;extremist&quot; by Republicans and &quot;too liberal&quot; by his Democratic opponents. Feingold also announced his support for strict campaign finance reform and a national health care system and voiced his opposition to term limits and new tax cuts.

Feingold won by positioning himself as a quirky underdog who offered voters an alternative to what was seen by many as negative campaigning of opponents Jim Moody and Joe Checota. On primary day, Feingold, whose support had shown in the single digits throughout much of the campaign, surged to victory with 70 percent of the vote. Seven weeks later, while Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Ross Perot split the Wisconsin presidential vote 41%-37%-21%, Feingold beat Kasten by a margin of 53 percent to 46 percent.

<text>Kyle Bryan Boller (born June 17, 1981) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). After playing college football for the California Golden Bears, he was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of the 2003 NFL draft. He was a member of the Ravens from 2003 to 2008, the St. Louis Rams in 2009, and the Oakland Raiders from 2010 to 2011.

==Early life==
Boller was born in Burbank, California. He earned the 1998 California State Player of the Year honors after an outstanding senior season at William S. Hart High School in Santa Clarita, CA. He led Hart to the CIF Southern Section Division III title with a 13–1 record. He passed for California prep record of 4,838 yards and threw for 59 touchdowns, the 2nd-best mark in California prep history, and ended the season completing 290 of 454 passes (63.9%). Because of this, he was considered by many to be the best prospect to emerge from The Valley Region of Los Angeles since John Elway came out of Granada Hills High School in 1979. During the 1998 season, Boller also played the position of safety on defense, and intercepted a pass in the final minute of the sectional championship game. He was rated the number one quarterback prospect in the nation by PrepStar and was that publication&#x27;s national Offensive Co-Player of the Year.

==College career==
In college, Boller was a starter for three and a half seasons at the University of California, Berkeley, and graduated with several Golden Bears&#x27; career and single season records. He is currently No. 3 for all-time career passing yards, No. 3 in total offense and No. 2 for all time touchdown passes.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Baltimore Ravens===
Boller became the Ravens&#x27; first round draft pick in 2003 NFL draft (19th overall pick). He was the second quarterback selected from the Pac-10 conference after the Cincinnati Bengals selected Carson Palmer from USC with the first overall pick. He started the first 9 games of the season, going 5–3, before being injured (thigh) in a game against the St. Louis Rams. He was inactive for most of the rest of the season, being replaced by backup Anthony Wright, as he also had to have surgery to repair a muscle in his quadriceps. Boller rushed 30 times for 62 yards, and completed 116 of 224 passes for 1,260 yards with 7 touchdowns and 9 interceptions.

Boller started all 16 games the only time in his career in 2004. He set career highs, completing 258-of-464 (55.6%) for 2,559 yards with 13 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He also rushed 53 times for 189 yards and his 1st-career rushing touchdown. He had 4 games with QB ratings over 100, including a career-high 112.3 rating while going 18-of-34 for 219 yards, with a career-high four touchdowns and no interceptions against the Giants.

Despite not making the playoffs the previous year, the Baltimore Ravens were seen by the NFL and the sports media as being contenders for the Super Bowl, resulting in four primetime games: two Sunday night games, and two spots featured on Monday Night Football. A factor in this was Boller&#x27;s perceived status of &quot;coming into his own&quot;, and so the Ravens were poised to start what would be a great season by taking on the Indianapolis Colts on the first primetime Sunday Night game of the season. The Ravens held their own in the first half, limiting the Colts to only 3 points, and Boller looked solid in the pocket, leading the offense down the field to the red zone several times. But it did not last, as Boller was injured in the third quarter, suffering a bad case of &quot;turf toe&quot;, that would wind up keeping him out of action for 7 games. The Ravens season went downhill after that, even going four games without a single passing touchdown. 
When Boller came back against the Bengals, after posting an 8.0 QB rating (4-of-12 [33%] for 37 yards and 1 interception) in the 1st half, he exploded in the 2nd half, going 14-of-20 [70%] for 174 yards, 3 touchdowns and 1 interception for a 115.4 QB rating in the final 2 quarters. In back to back games, he (and the entire team) finally seemed to come alive and show the promise everyone had been expecting, as he completed 19-of-27 passes (70.4%) for 253 yards, 3 touchdowns and no interceptions for a career-high 136.8 QB rating in the 48–3 victory in Week 14 vs. the Green Bay Packers. Then, against the Minnesota Vikings, he posted a career-high 70.6 completion percentage (24-of-34) for 289 yards, 3 touchdowns and 1 interception for a 113.5 QB rating.

However, despite this, he still finished 2005 completing a career-high 58.4% of his passes (171-of-293) for 1,799 yards with 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions despite missing almost 8 games due to injury.

Steve McNair, former Tennessee Titans QB, was traded to Baltimore in 2006. Coach Brian Billick declared McNair the starter instead of having the two compete for the job, citing McNair&#x27;s credentials, including 2003 NFL Co-MVP, and Boller&#x27;s propensity to turn over the ball. In Week 6 of the 2006 NFL season, McNair was sacked by Carolina Panthers defenders Mike Rucker and Chris Draft. The result of that play was a mild concussion and a neck injury. McNair left the game and would not return. Boller came in to replace him in the final seconds of the first quarter, and completed 17 of 31 passes for a 58% completion percentage, 3 touchdowns, 226 yards, and one interception. Faced with a 9-point deficit with 5:10 remaining, Boller connected with Mark Clayton for a 62-yard touchdown pass to start a comeback attempt. When the Ravens defense gave up their second touchdown of the day, Boller was called upon to score again. This time, he faced 68 yards and was given 4:08 to score a touchdown, to still be behind in the game. He drove down the field and capped off his drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Todd Heap. The Panthers were then able to run out the clock before the Raven&#x27;s offense could get back on the field, and Baltimore lost 23 – 21. Then, after McNair&#x27;s throwing hand was stepped on against Cleveland on Dec 17, Boller led the Ravens to victory with a 13-of-21, 238-yard and two-touchdown performance (112.3 passer rating), one touchdown being the game highlight, when he connected with explosive rookie receiver Demetrius Williams for the 77 yard score. That victory clinched a playoff berth for the Ravens, who had already all but locked up their division. With McNair as the starting quarterback the Ravens improved to a franchise best mark of 13–3 on the season, as compared to only going 6–10 the previous year with Boller at the helm.
After McNair was injured in the first game of the 2007 season against the Cincinnati Bengals, Boller was given the opportunity to start. He came in late in the game and was unable to pull out a victory. Boller was then named the interim starter in Week 2, in a home game against the New York Jets. He had a strong showing, throwing two touchdowns and no interceptions for 185 yds and a QB rating of 97.9. In Week 3, McNair retook the reins of the team, facing the Arizona Cardinals. The team was up in the 4th, and they switched Boller in to rest McNair, and in spite of a late comeback effort by Kurt Warner, Boller managed to get the team in position for a game-winning field goal. The following 2 games Boller was back on the bench. In weeks 6 and 7, Boller was once again named the interim starter for the Ravens.

Following the Week 8 Bye, the Ravens once again decided to go with McNair as their starter. Two bad losses against division rivals followed. After Week 10, which featured a humiliating loss against the Cincinnati Bengals, during which McNair committed 3 fumbles, it was decided that Boller would officially be the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season. Boller led the Ravens in a hard-fought game against the Cleveland Browns, in which the Ravens attempted to make a late comeback, which ended in what seemed to be a win after a missed field goal attempt by Cleveland. However, the refs reviewed the play and found that it was in fact a good field goal, and the game went into overtime. Boller and the Ravens eventually lost 33–30.

They then faced the New England Patriots on Monday Night Football. Boller finished the game with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. The Ravens lost 27–24.

The Ravens next traveled to Miami to face off against the winless Miami Dolphins. Boller had his season end early with yet another injury, this time a mild concussion. Backup rookie quarterback Troy Smith played the remainder of the game, leading the team into overtime, where they eventually lost, 22–16, giving the Dolphins their sole win of the season.

The 2007 Ravens ended their season with a record of 5–11, which led to the firing of head coach Brian Billick and the drafting of future quarterback Joe Flacco.

Following the retirement of Steve McNair, Boller faced a three-way battle for the starting job between himself, former Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith, and the rookie Flacco, who was drafted with the Ravens&#x27; first round draft choice. Boller was given the starting job against the New England Patriots in the 2008 pre-season opener, but following another injury suffered in a preseason game against the Minnesota Vikings, his season ended when the Ravens placed him on injured reserve on September 3.

===St. Louis Rams===

An unrestricted free agent in the 2009 offseason, Boller signed with the St. Louis Rams on April 4 as the backup to starting quarterback Marc Bulger. Boller saw action on September 27 against the Green Bay Packers after Bulger sustained a bruised rotator cuff. He passed for 164 yards, two touchdowns and an interception along with 31 rushing yards in the 36–17 loss. In Week 4 against the San Francisco 49ers, he threw an interception and fumbled, both returned for touchdowns.

===Oakland Raiders===
On April 15, 2010, Boller signed with the Raiders.
On October 24, 2010, Boller saw some game action in the Raiders-Broncos game. He rushed six times for 11 yards in the Raiders&#x27; blowout 59–14 win.
In March 2011, the Raiders resigned Boller for one year at $1.25 million. In October, Boller became the Raiders&#x27; starting quarterback after Jason Campbell suffered a collarbone injury against the Cleveland Browns. Boller replaced Campbell, and the Raiders held on to beat the Browns.

The following week, due to Campbell&#x27;s injury, Boller started his first game as a Raider against the Chiefs. He was ineffective, throwing three interceptions, and was eventually replaced in the game by the newly acquired Carson Palmer, who went on to throw three interceptions himself. Boller became the primary backup to Palmer for the rest of the season.

===San Diego Chargers and retirement===
An unrestricted free agent in the 2012 offseason, Boller signed with the San Diego Chargers on July 27, 2012, after backup Charlie Whitehurst suffered a knee injury in training camp. After the signing, however, Boller opted to retire.

<text>Musa Smith (; born May 31, 1982) is an American former professional football player who was a running back for five seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs and was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the third round of the 2003 NFL draft. Smith was also a member of the New York Jets.

==Early life==
Smith attended West Perry High School in Perry County, Pennsylvania, where he was a &quot;USA Today&quot; honorable mention &quot;All-USA&quot; selection in football.

==College career==
At the University of Georgia, Smith rushed for 2,202 yards and 19 touchdowns on 454 carries (4.9 yards per carry) during his three-year career at Georgia. This included a spectacular junior campaign in 2002, when he rushed for 1,324 yards and eight touchdowns on 261 carries (5.1 yards per carry), becoming the first Georgia running back to pass 1,000-yards in a season since Garrison Hearst in 1992.

Smith played a starring role in Georgia&#x27;s 2003 Sugar Bowl victory over Florida State on January 1, 2003, carrying the ball 23 times for 145 yards in Georgia&#x27;s 26–13 win.

==Professional career==
===Baltimore Ravens===

Smith was drafted with the 13th pick of the third round (77th overall) in the 2003 NFL draft. He played sparingly for much of 2003 and 2004.

During a Week 11 game with the Dallas Cowboys in 2004, Smith was horse-collar tackled from behind by safety Roy Williams. Smith&#x27;s right leg was trapped under the weight of his body, resulting in a severe compound fracture of his right tibia. The injury basically put Smith out of action for two seasons (he played only one game in 2005) and led to the NFL banning the tackle in May 2005.

In the 2006 Ravens training camp, Smith outplayed Mike Anderson in the battle for the backup running back job behind Jamal Lewis. In three preseason games in 2006, Smith was tied for the NFL lead with LaMont Jordan with 123 rushing yards on 13 carries (7.9 yards per carry).

In total, Smith has rushed for 262 yards and three touchdowns on 62 carries (4.2 yards per carry) in 34 regular season appearances with the Baltimore Ravens, he has also caught 28 passes for 180 yards as of the end of the 2006 season.

He was the backup to Willis McGahee and had an increased role in the 2007 season as in past years he mainly played on special teams. Smith had 264 rushing yards and two touchdowns that year.

Through his stay with the Ravens, Smith collected 132 rushes for 496 yards, and four touchdowns on a 3.8 yard average. He also had 54 catches for 363 yards, on a 6.7 yard receiving average.

===New York Jets===
On May 27, 2008, Smith was signed by the New York Jets. He was later released on August 26 prior to the regular season.

==Personal life==
Smith is a Muslim. His name translates to Moses in Arabic. He has a brother, Taalib, who is a personal trainer at the Big Vanilla Health Club in Arnold, Maryland. Smith has three children.

Smith&#x27;s father, Kelvin Smith, ran training camps for Boy Scouts, law officers from the family farm in New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania, and as an agent with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1999, he was convicted on charges related to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

<doc id="1104574" wikidata="Q2872175" url="?curid=1104574" title="Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service">
<text>The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service was the Australian government agency responsible for enforcing Australian quarantine laws, as part of the Department of Agriculture.

Following a period operating under the name DAFF Biosecurity, it has since been absorbed into divisions in the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources.

==Quarantine in Australia==

AQIS&#x27;s import and export inspection and certification is essential to maintaining Australia&#x27;s highly favourable animal, plant and human health status and access to export markets. Quarantine controls at Australia&#x27;s borders minimise the risk of exotic pests and diseases to protect Australia&#x27;s agriculture industries and environment. AQIS does this by specialist Federal law enforcement officers known as Quarantine &amp; Exports Inspectors, or &#x27;Quarantine Officers&#x27;.

==History==
On 30 March 1908, the Commonwealth Quarantine service came into operation and took over quarantine stations in every Australian state, as allowed in section 2A of the Quarantine Act 1908. The 1956 Summer Olympics, held in Melbourne, were prevented by the quarantine regulations to host the equestrian events; therefore they were held in Stockholm, Sweden five months earlier.

==Role of AQIS==
AQIS was the agency responsible for animal, plant and human quarantine border controls, of passengers and cargo. AQIS officers used X-ray machines and sniffer dogs in airports, seaports and mail centres to search for quarantine risk material.

Along with Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) AQIS administered the Imported Food Programme, ensuring that food commercially imported into Australia meets Australia&#x27;s Quarantine Standards and the Food Standards Code.

AQIS also provided inspection and certification for a range of agricultural products exported from Australia, to ensure compliance with overseas countries importation requirements.

==Biosecurity Australia==
Biosecurity Australia was a prescribed agency within the Australian Government Department of Agriculture from August 2007 to September 2009. In September 2009, a division of DAFF known as Biosecurity Services Group took over their functions. Biosecurity Australia provided policy advice to AQIS concerning the importation of quarantine risk material to Australia when requested by AQIS. Under the &quot;Quarantine Act 1908&quot;, AQIS had responsibility for setting the rules concerning the imports, not Biosecurity Australia.
