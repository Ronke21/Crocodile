<text>Abū Muḥammad ʿAlī ibn [[al-Mu&#x27;tadid|Aḥmad]] ibn [[Al-Muwaffaq|Ṭalḥa]] ibn [[Al-Mutawakkil|Jaʿfar]] ibn [[al-Mu&#x27;tasim|Muḥammad]] ibn [[Harun al-Rashid|Hārūn]] al-Muktafī bi&#x27;Llāh (; 877/78 – 13 August 908), better known by his regnal name al-Muktafī bi-Llāh (), was the caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate from 902 to 908. More liberal and sedentary than his militaristic father al-Mu&#x27;tadid, al-Muktafi essentially continued his policies, although most of the actual conduct of government was left to his viziers and officials. His reign saw the defeat of the Qarmatians of the Syrian Desert, and the reincorporation of Egypt and the parts of Syria ruled by the Tulunid dynasty. The war with the Byzantine Empire continued with alternating success, although the Arabs scored a major victory in the Sack of Thessalonica in 904. His death in 908 opened the way for the installation of a weak ruler, al-Muqtadir, by the palace bureaucracy, and began the terminal decline of the Abbasid Caliphate that ended in 946 with the caliphs becoming puppet rulers under the Buyid dynasty.

==Early life==
Ali ibn Ahmad was born in 877/8, the son of Ahmad ibn Talha, the future caliph al-Mu&#x27;tadid () by a Turkish slave-girl, named Čiček (&quot;flower&quot;, Jijak in Arabic). He was the first caliph named after caliph Ali.

At the time of his birth, the Abbasid Caliphate was still reeling from the decade-long civil war known as the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot;, which had begun with the assassination of Caliph al-Mutawakkil () by dissatisfied soldiers and ended with the accession of al-Mu&#x27;tamid (). Real power, however, lay with al-Mu&#x27;tamid&#x27;s brother, al-Muwaffaq, Ali&#x27;s paternal grandfather. Al-Muwaffaq enjoyed the loyalty of the military, and by 877 had established himself as the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the state. Caliphal authority in the provinces collapsed during the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot;, with the result that by the 870s the central government had lost effective control over most of the Caliphate outside the metropolitan region of Iraq. In the west, Egypt had fallen under the control of Ahmad ibn Tulun, who also disputed control of Syria with al-Muwaffaq, while Khurasan and most of the Islamic East had been taken over by the Saffarids, who replaced Abbasids&#x27; loyal clients, the Tahirids. Most of the Arabian peninsula was likewise lost to local potentates, while in Tabaristan a radical Zaydi Shi&#x27;a dynasty took power. In Iraq, the rebellion of the Zanj slaves threatened Baghdad itself, and it took al-Muwaffaq and al-Mu&#x27;tadid years of hard campaigning before they were finally subdued in 893.

Following his rise to the throne, al-Mu&#x27;tadid continued his father&#x27;s policies, and restored caliphal authority in the Jazira, northern Syria, and parts of western Iran. He established an effective administration, but the incessant campaigning, and the need to keep the soldiery satisfied, meant that it was almost totally geared towards providing the funds necessary to maintain the army. Nevertheless, al-Mu&#x27;tadid managed to accumulate a considerable surplus in his ten-year reign. At the same time the bureaucracy grew in power, it also saw a growth in factionalism, with two rival &quot;clans&quot; emerging, the Banu&#x27;l-Furat and the Banu&#x27;l-Jarrah. The two groups represented primarily different factions in a struggle for office and power, but there are indications of &quot;ideological&quot; differences as well: many of the Banu&#x27;l-Jarrah families hailed from converted Nestorian families and employed Christians in the bureaucracy, in addition to maintaining closer ties with the military, while the Banu&#x27;l-Furat tried to impose firm civilian control of the army and (not quite openly) favoured Shi&#x27;ism.

Al-Mu&#x27;tadid took care to prepare Ali, his oldest son and heir-apparent, for the succession by appointing him as a provincial governor: first in Rayy, Qazvin, Qum and Hamadan, when these provinces were seized from the semi-autonomous Dulafid dynasty in , and in 899 over the Jazira and the Byzantine frontier areas, when al-Mu&#x27;tadid deposed the last local autonomous governor, Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Shaybani. The future al-Muktafi took up residence at Raqqa. The religious scholar Ibn Abi al-Dunya, who enjoyed al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s confidence, was appointed as Ali&#x27;s tutor.

==Caliphate==
When al-Mu&#x27;tadid died on 5 April 902, al-Muktafi succeeded him unopposed. His father&#x27;s vizier, al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah, ordered the oath of allegiance to be taken in his name, and took the precaution of locking up all Abbasid princes until al-Muktafi arrived in Baghdad from Raqqa (20 April).

===Character and government===

The new caliph was 25 years old on his accession. The historian al-Tabari, who lived during his reign, describes him as of &quot;medium size, handsome, of a delicate complexion, with [a full head of] beautiful hair and a luxurious beard&quot;.

Al-Muktafi inherited his father&#x27;s love of buildings. He completed al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s third palace project, the Taj (&#x27;Crown&#x27;) Palace, in Baghdad, for which he reused bricks from the palace of the Sasanian rulers in Ctesiphon. Among its numerous buildings was a semicircular tower, known as the &#x27;Cupola of the Ass&#x27; (). The caliph could ride to its top mounted on a donkey, and from there gaze on the surrounding countryside. On the site of his father&#x27;s palace prisons, he also added a Friday mosque to the palace, the (&#x27;Palace Mosque&#x27;), now occupied by the . He also emulated his father in avarice and parsimony, which allowed him to leave, despite a short reign with almost continuous warfare, a considerable surplus. When al-Muktafi left Baghdad in May 903 and went to the old capital of Samarra, with the intention of moving his seat there, he was quickly dissuaded by the high cost the rebuilding of the city would entail. His easy-going nature, on the other hand, was the antithesis of his father, who was famous for his extreme severity and the cruel and imaginative punishments he inflicted. Al-Muktafi&#x27;s popularity received a major boostr when, soon after his accession, he destroyed his father&#x27;s underground prisons and gave the site to the people, released prisoners and returned lands confiscated by the government. He is also notable for personally attending the sessions of the , where he heard the complaints and petitions of the common people.

===Role of the vizier al-Qasim===
Al-Muktafi was not as steadfast as his father, and was easily swayed by the officials at court. The early period of his caliphate was dominated by the vizier al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah. A very able man, he was also ambitious; he had plotted to assassinate al-Mu&#x27;tadid shortly before the latter&#x27;s death, and now ruthlessly eliminated any rivals for influence over the new caliph.

Thus al-Qasim ordered the execution of the imprisoned Saffarid ruler, Amr ibn al-Layth, when al-Muktafi, immediately after his arrival in Baghdad, asked after his well-being and indicated that he wanted to treat him well. Shortly after, the vizier managed to discredit al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s loyal commander-in-chief, Badr al-Mu&#x27;tadidi. Badr was forced to flee Baghdad but surrendered after being promised a pardon by the vizier&#x27;s agents, only to be executed on 14 August. A few days later, al-Qasim ordered the arrest of an uncle of the Caliph, Abd al-Wahid, a son of al-Muwaffaq, who never heard from again; and in September 903, al-Husayn ibn Amr al-Nasrani, a Christian secretary, whom al-Muktafi initially favoured and who opposed al-Qasim, was denounced and exiled, his offices being given to al-Qasim&#x27;s sons, al-Husayn and Muhammad. Al-Qasim even succeeded in having his little daughter betrothed to al-Muktafi&#x27;s infant son Abu Ahmad Muhammad in March 904, and his eminent position in the state was highlighted by the award, for the first time in the Islamic world, of a special honorific title, .

In the bureaucratic struggles of the period, al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah favoured the Banu&#x27;l-Jarrah and resisted the pro-Shi&#x27;ite leanings of the Banu&#x27;l-Furat. The leading representative of the Banu&#x27;l-Furat, Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Furat, only escaped death due to the vizier&#x27;s own death in 904. Before his death al-Qasim had nominated as his successors either al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara&#x27;i or Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah, but the latter refused the post, and Ali ibn al-Furat quickly gained the favour of al-Abbas al-Jarjara&#x27;i and the Caliph.

===Campaigns===
Al-Muktafi&#x27;s brief reign was dominated by warfare, but he was unlike his father, the &quot; caliph&quot; &quot;par excellence&quot;. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid had actively participated in campaigns, setting a personal example and allowing for the formation of ties of loyalty, reinforced by patronage, between the ruler and the soldiers. Al-Muktafi, on the other hand, did not &quot;in his character and comportment [...], being a sedentary figure, instill much loyalty, let alone inspiration, in the soldiers&quot;, according to the historian Michael Bonner.

====Relations with the eastern warlords====
Al-Mu&#x27;tadid had had a turbulent relationship with the Saffarids, who ruled most of Persia: their rule over the eastern parts of the Islamic world was recognized by Baghdad, but the caliph and the Saffarids contested control over western Persia, notably the provinces of Fars and Kirman. In 901, the Saffarids had seized Fars, and repulsed Badr al-Mu&#x27;tadidi&#x27;s attempts to recover it. At the time of al-Muktafi&#x27;s accession, the Saffarids captured Rayy. A military response was delayed by the affair around Badr al-Mu&#x27;tadidi, and it was not until 5 November that troops were sent to the region. The result of the expedition is unknown, however, and it is known that the Samanids captured Rayy in the same year. Like his father before him, al-Muktafi preferred to reach a &quot;modus vivendi&quot; with the Saffarids, and in the next year confirmed them in their control over Fars.

Baghdad&#x27;s relations with the quasi-independent ruler of Adharbayjan, Yusuf ibn Abi&#x27;l-Saj, had never been settled and became increasingly strained under al-Muktafi. In 908, an army under Hakam al-Muflihi was sent against Ibn Abi&#x27;l-Saj, but after al-Muktafi&#x27;s death soon after, a settlement was reached: Ibn Abi&#x27;l-Saj acknowledged caliphal suzerainty and was named governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan.

====Qarmatian uprisings====
The early caliphates were always threatened by the radical Kharijite sects, which were especially prevalent among the marginalized populations living on the lands between the desert and the settled, agricultural communities and were traditionally hostile to the central authorities. During the 9th century, a range of new movements emerged on the basis of Shi&#x27;ite doctrines, which replaced Kharijism as the main idiom for opposition to established regimes. Zaydism-inspired leaders had already established independent dynasties in the fringes of the Abbasid empire, in Tabaristan (864) and Yemen (897), but by the time of al-Muktafi&#x27;s accession, the core regions of the Caliphate itself were menaced by the Qarmatians, a radical Isma&#x27;ili Shi&#x27;ite sect. The Qarmatians denounced mainstream Sunni Islam for practices they viewed as deviations from the true teachings of the religion, such as the Hajj and the worship of the Kaaba, as well as the dwelling in cities and the marginalization of the Bedouin. Consequently, the Qarmatians gained many adherents among the latter—although the Qarmatian leadership overwhelmingly came from the urban settlers—and began assaulting the neighbouring Muslim communities. Their missionary efforts soon spread: in 899, the Qarmatian missionary Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Jannabi seized Bahrayn, while another base was established in the area around Palmyra. From there the Qarmatians began launching raids against the Abbasid and Tulunid provinces of Syria. In 902, the Qarmatians defeated the increasingly feeble Tulunids and laid siege to Damascus. Although the city withstood the siege, the Qarmatians proceeded to ravage other Syrian towns. At the same time, a Kufan Isma&#x27;ili missionary, Abu Abdallah al-Shi&#x27;i, made contact with the Kutama Berbers in Ifriqiya. His proselytization efforts made rapid headway among them, and in 902, he began his attacks on the Aghlabid emirate there, an Abbasid vassal. Its conquest was completed in 909, laying the foundations of the Isma&#x27;ili Fatimid Caliphate.

In July 903, al-Muktafi decided to personally campaign against the Qarmatians, and left Baghdad for Raqqa at the head of the army. Al-Muktafi remained at Raqqa, and actual command was given to the head of the department of the army (), Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib. Other Abbasid forces, under Badr al-Hammami and al-Husayn ibn Hamdan, also operated against the Qarmatians, defeating them near Damascus in July, but also suffering a defeat near Aleppo the next month. Finally, on 29 November 903, near Hama, Muhammad ibn Sulayman came upon the main Qarmatian army and routed it, capturing or killing its main leaders and dispersing their troops. Al-Muktafi returned to Baghdad with the senior captives, who were thrown into prison. Muhammad ibn Sulayman remained at Raqqa to scour the countryside and round up the remaining rebels. He too then returned to Baghdad, which he entered in triumph on 2 February 904. Eleven days later, on 13 February, Muhammad and the (chief of security) of the capital, Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Wathiqi, presided over the public execution of the Qarmatian leaders and Qarmatian sympathizers rounded up from Kufa and Baghdad. In the same year, the Abbasid governor of Bahrayn defeated the local Qarmatians and recaptured the town of Qatif.

The Abbasid victory near Hama did not yet fully eradicate the Qarmatians from the area. Taking advantage of the absence of the local governor, Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh, who went to suppress a revolt in Egypt, in 906, a part of the Banu Kalb Bedouin rose up in rebellion, led by the Qarmatian Abu Ghanim, called Nasr. They raided the Hawran and Tiberias, and launched an attack on Damascus. Although they defeated its garrison under the deputy governor, Ahmad ibn Nasr, they could not take the city itself, and moved onto Tiberias, which they pillaged. Al-Husayn ibn Hamdan was sent to pursue them, but they withdrew to the desert and poisoned the water holes behind them and escaped. On 16 June 906, they attacked Hit on the Euphrates. The generals Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Kundajiq and Mu&#x27;nis al-Khadim marched against them from Baghdad, while al-Husayn ibn Hamdan moved against them from the west, trying to encircle them. To escape their predicament, the Bedouin killed Nasr and received a pardon by the caliphal authorities. The remaining Qarmatians moved south to Kufa, on the orders of the chief missionary Zikrawayh ibn Mihrawayh. On 2 October they launched an attack on the city, and were repulsed, but they defeated a relief army sent from Baghdad to aid Kufa. Zikrawayh then marched to attack the caravans returning from the pilgrimage to Mecca. In November, three caravans were overwhelmed; the Qarmatians massacred indiscriminately—some 20,000 were reportedly killed in the second caravan alone—and carried off women and children as slaves, along with enormous booty. Finally, in early January 907, caliphal troops under Wasif ibn Sawartakin caught the Qarmatians near al-Qadisiyya and destroyed them. With these defeats, the Qarmatian movement virtually ceased to exist in the Syrian Desert, although their counterparts in Bahrayn remained an active threat for several decades to come.

The distinguished service of al-Husayn ibn Hamdan during these campaigns not only established him as one of the leading Abbasid commanders, but also helped the rise of his family, the Hamdanids, to power and prominence: in 905, his brother Abu&#x27;l-Hayja Abdallah was appointed governor of Mosul, which became the family&#x27;s main powerbase in the decades to come.

====Recovery of Tulunid Syria and Egypt====

The defeat of the Qarmatians at Hama also opened the way for the Abbasids to recover the provinces of southern Syria and Egypt, held by the Tulunid dynasty. The Tulunid regime had already been weakened by internal strife and the rivalries of the various ethnic groups in the army, which led to the defection of the commander Badr al-Hammami and other senior officers to the Abbasids; the regime was further weakened by the destructive raids of the Qarmatians and its inability to deal with it. On 24 May 904, Muhammad ibn Sulayman left Baghdad at the head of an army, numbering 10,000 according to al-Tabari, and tasked with recovering southern Syria and Egypt itself from the Tulunids. His campaign was to be assisted from the sea by a fleet from the frontier districts of Cilicia under Damian of Tarsus. Damian led a fleet up the river Nile, raided its coasts, and prevented supplies for the Tulunid forces from being ferried over it.

The Abbasid advance was mostly unopposed, and in December, the Tulunid emir Harun ibn Khumarawayh was murdered by his uncles Ali and Shayban. Shayban took over the reins of the state, but the murder caused further defections to the Abbasids, including the governor of Damascus, Tughj ibn Juff. In January, the Abbasid army arrived before Fustat, the old capital of Egypt. Shayban abandoned his troops during the night, and the city surrendered. The victorious Abbasids razed the nearby Tulunid-founded capital al-Qata&#x27;i, with the exception of the great Mosque of Ibn Tulun. The members of the Tulunid family and their leading adherents were arrested and brought to Baghdad, while their properties were confiscated. Isa al-Nushari was appointed governor of Egypt. His tenure was troubled from the start: within months, he was forced to abandon Fustat and flee to Alexandria due to a secessionist rebellion under a certain Ibrahim al-Khalanji. He was possibly the same person as a certain Muhammad ibn Ali al-Khalij, who is also recorded to have led a pro-Tulunid revolt at about the same time. Reinforcements arrived from Baghdad under Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh. Al-Khalanji proved victorious in the first encounter with Ibn Kayghalagh at al-Arish in December 905, but in the end he was defeated and captured in May 906 and brought prisoner to Baghdad.

In 906, al-Muktafi married a daughter of the second Tulunid ruler, Khumarawayh. She was probably a half-sister of the famous Qatr al-Nada, another daughter of Khumarawayh who was intended for him but ended up being married to his father in 893.

====Byzantine front====
Al-Muktafi kept up the perennial conflict with the Byzantine Empire, with varying success. In May 902, al-Qasim ibn Sima al-Farghani was appointed to command the frontier districts of the Jazira. In 902 or 903, a naval raid reached the island of Lemnos, dangerously close to the Byzantine capital, Constantinople; the island was plundered and its inhabitants carried off into slavery. Nevertheless, in May 903, the newly appointed governor of Tarsus, Abu&#x27;l-Asha&#x27;ir Ahmad ibn Nasr, was dispatched to the frontier districts with gifts for the Byzantine ruler, Leo VI the Wise (), and in return, Byzantine envoys arrived in Baghdad for negotiations on a prisoner exchange. The exchange eventually took place in September–October 905, at the river Lamus in Cilicia, but was interrupted because the Byzantines reneged on the agreed terms. After further negotiations, the exchange was completed in August 908.
In the summer of 904, a Byzantine renegade in Abbasid service, Leo of Tripoli, led a major naval expedition of 54 vessels from the Syrian and Egyptian fleets, whose initial target reportedly was Constantinople itself. The Arab fleet penetrated the Dardanelles and sacked Abydos, as the Byzantine navy under Eustathios Argyros was reluctant to confront them. Emperor Leo VI replaced Argyros with the more energetic Himerios, but Leo of Tripoli forestalled the Byzantines, turning back west and heading for the Empire&#x27;s second city, Thessalonica, which he sacked after a three-day siege on 31 July 904. The sack of the city brought the Muslim fleet enormous booty and many captives who were taken to be sold as slaves, including the eyewitness John Kaminiates, who wrote the main account of the city&#x27;s siege and fall.

On land, however, the Byzantines held the upper hand: the contemporary Baghdadi historian al-Tabari reports that in spring/early summer 904, a major Byzantine army, &quot;ten crosses with one hundred thousand men&quot;, had invaded the borderlands and plundered as far as Hadath. In November, possibly as a retaliation for the sack of Thessalonica, the Byzantine general Andronikos Doukas invaded Arab territory, and won a major victory over the forces of Tarsus and al-Massisah (Mopsuestia) at Marash (Germanikeia). Further successes followed for both sides. The Byzantines captured Qurus (Cyrrhus) in July 906, destroying the city and carrying off its inhabitants. In October 906, Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh and Rustam ibn Baradu launched a raid that reached as far as the Halys River before turning back laden with spoils and captives. On the sea, Himerios won a victory over an Arab fleet on St. Thomas&#x27;s day, 6 October 906. In spring 907, however, Andronikos Doukas and his son Constantine defected to the Abbasids, the victims of the intrigues of Leo VI&#x27;s powerful eunuch chamberlain, Samonas.

A further and unique case of al-Muktafi&#x27;s diplomatic relations is his correspondence with Bertha, daughter of the King of Lotharingia and wife of Adalbert II, Margrave of Tuscany. In 906, Bertha sent a letter, written in Latin, and rich gifts to al-Muktafi, seeking his friendship and a marriage alliance. Bertha was apparently motivated by the threat posed by the Arab colony at Fraxinetum, and turned to al-Muktafi in the—mistaken—belief that the caliph still exercised real power over the Aghlabid rulers of Ifriqiya. Al-Muktafi in turn replied with a letter of his own, but nothing came of this long-distance correspondence.

==Death and legacy==
Al-Muktafi was a successful ruler, as well as &quot;a man of sensibility, a gourmet and an appreciator of the verses of poets like Ibn al-Rumi&quot;. As the historian Harold Bowen writes, &quot;the Caliphate seemed in his day almost to have regained its former glory&quot;, having overcome the Qarmatian challenge and regained Egypt and Syria. His fiscal policies, building upon those of his father, also ensured prosperity and a full treasury, despite the drain and devastation of continuous warfare.

Al-Muktafi, however, was of a sickly disposition since childhood; indeed, he may have been ill for much of his reign. In late spring 908 he fell gravely ill, and for about three months, the caliph lay incapacitated, his situation alternately improving and deteriorating. It soon became clear, however, that he would not survive his illness. Al-Muktafi had nine sons, but they were all underage, and due to his illness, he was unable to determine a successor. The vizier, al-Abbas al-Jarjara&#x27;i, sounded out the leading officials of the bureaucracy on the issue—an unprecedented act that demonstrated the monopoly of power now exercised by the civilian bureaucrats. Muhammad ibn Dawud al-Jarrah favoured the experienced and capable Abbasid prince Abdallah ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz, but the vizier eventually followed the advice of Ali ibn al-Furat, who suggested al-Muktafi&#x27;s 13-year-old brother Ja&#x27;far, on the grounds that he would be weak and pliable, and easily manipulated by the senior officials. The choice of Ja&#x27;far, who became Caliph al-Muqtadir (), was, in the words of historian Hugh Kennedy, &quot;a sinister development&quot; and inaugurated one &quot;of the most disastrous reigns in the whole of Abbasid history [...] a quarter of a century in which all of the work of [al-Muqtadir&#x27;s] predecessors would be undone&quot;.

Al-Muktafi seems to have recovered just enough to sanction his brother&#x27;s nomination, before dying on 13 August 908. Like his father, he was buried in the Tahirid Palace in Baghdad. Al-Muktafi&#x27;s death marked the &quot;high point of the Abbasid revival&quot; that had been spearheaded by his father and grandfather. Over the next 40 years, the Caliphate would face a succession of power struggles, and lose its outlying provinces to ambitious local dynasts; with the rise of Ibn Ra&#x27;iq to the post of in 936, the caliphs became mere puppet rulers, and Baghdad itself would finally be captured by the Iranian Shi&#x27;a Buyid dynasty in 946.

During these turmoils, al-Muktafi&#x27;s posthumous son, Abdallah, was installed as caliph by the warlord Tuzun in 944–946, with the regnal name al-Mustakfi. Abu Ahmad Muhammad, who had wed al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah&#x27;s daughter, was himself involved in a conspiracy against al-Muqtadir in 930, and was briefly a candidate for the caliphal throne in 932, after al-Muqtadir&#x27;s downfall. He died in 933.

<text>Abū’l-Faḍl Jaʿfar ibn [[Al-Mu&#x27;tadid|Aḥmad]] ibn [[Al-Muwaffaq|Ṭalḥa]] ibn [[Al-Mutawakkil|Jaʿfar]] ibn [[al-Mu&#x27;tasim|Muḥammad]] ibn [[Harun al-Rashid|Hārūn]] Al-Muqtadir bi&#x27;Llāh () (895 – 31 October 932 AD), better known by his regnal name al-Muqtadir bi&#x27;Llāh (, &quot;Mighty in God&quot;), was the eighteenth caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate from 908 to 932 AD (295–320 AH), with the exception of a brief deposition in favour of al-Qahir in 929.

He came to the throne at the age of 13, the youngest Caliph in Abbasid history, as a result of palace intrigues. His accession was soon challenged by the supporters of the older and more experienced Abdallah ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz, but their attempted coup in December 908 was quickly and decisively crushed. Al-Muqtadir enjoyed a longer rule than any of his predecessors, but was uninterested in government. Affairs were run by his officials, although the frequent change of viziers—fourteen changes of the head of government are recorded for his reign—hampered the effectiveness of the administration. The Abbasid harem, where his mother, Shaghab, exercised total control, also exercised a frequently decisive influence on affairs, and especially on the advancement or dismissal of officials. After a period of consolidation and recovery under his father al-Mu&#x27;tadid and older half-brother al-Muktafi, al-Muqtadir&#x27;s reign marks the onset of rapid decline. The full treasury inherited by al-Muqtadir was quickly emptied, and financial difficulties would become a persistent feature of the caliphal government. Ifriqiya fell to the Fatimids, although the commander-in-chief Mu&#x27;nis al-Muzaffar was able to repel their attempts to conquer Egypt as well. Nearer to Iraq, the Hamdanids became autonomous masters of the Jazira and the Qarmatians re-emerged as a major threat, culminating in their capture of Mecca in 929. The forces of the Byzantine Empire, under John Kourkouas, began a sustained offensive into the borderlands of the Thughur and Armenia. As a result, in February 929 a palace revolt briefly replaced al-Muqtadir with his brother al-Qahir. The new regime failed to consolidate itself, however, and after a few days al-Muqtadir was restored. The commander-in-chief, Mu&#x27;nis al-Muzaffar, was by then a virtual dictator. Urged by his enemies, al-Muqtadir attempted to get rid of him in 932, but Mu&#x27;nis marched with his troops on Baghdad, and in the ensuing battle on 31 October 932 al-Muqtadir was killed.

== Birth and background ==
The future al-Muqtadir was born on 14 November 895, as the second son of Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tadid (r. 892–902). His mother was the Byzantine slave concubine Shaghab. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid was the son of al-Muwaffaq, an Abbasid prince who became the Caliphate&#x27;s main military commander, and &quot;de facto&quot; regent, during the rule of his brother, al-Mu&#x27;tamid (r. 870–892). Al-Muwaffaq&#x27;s power relied on his close ties with the &quot;ghilmān&quot;, the foreign-born &quot;slave-soldiers&quot; that now provided the professional mainstay of the Abbasid army. The &quot;ghilmān&quot; were highly proficient militarily, but also very expensive, and a potential political danger, as their first priority was securing their pay; alien to the mainstream of Muslim society, the &quot;ghilmān&quot; had no compunctions about overthrowing a vizier or even a caliph to secure their aims, as demonstrated during the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot; (861–870), when five caliphs succeeded one another.

Caliphal authority in the provinces collapsed during the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot;, with the result that by the 870s the central government had lost effective control over most of the Caliphate outside the metropolitan region of Iraq. In the west, Egypt had fallen under the control of Ahmad ibn Tulun, who also disputed control of Syria with al-Muwaffaq, while Khurasan and most of the Islamic East had been taken over by the Saffarids, who replaced the Abbasids&#x27; loyal governor Muhammad ibn Tahir. Most of the Arabian peninsula was likewise lost to local potentates, while in Tabaristan a radical Zaydi Shi&#x27;a dynasty took power. Even in Iraq, the rebellion of the Zanj slaves threatened Baghdad itself, and further south the Qarmatians were a nascent threat. Until his death in 891, al-Muwaffaq was engaged in a constant struggle to avert complete collapse, but managed to suppress the Zanj and repel the Saffarids. Upon his death, his son assumed his powers, and when Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tamid died in 892, he usurped the throne from his sons. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid would prove to be the epitome of the &quot;warrior-caliph&quot;, spending most of his reign on campaign. He managed to overthrow the local dynasts who had seized power during the Anarchy and restore control over the Jazira, the frontier towns of the Thughur, and the Jibal, but his attempts to capture Fars and Kirman were unsuccessful. In other areas, however, the fragmentation of the Islamic world continued: the Sajid dynasty was established in Adharbayjan, the Armenian princes became &quot;de facto&quot; independent, Yemen was lost to a local Zaydi dynasty, and a new radical sect, the Qarmatians, emerged and in 899 seized Bahrayn. His successor, al-Muqtadir&#x27;s older half-brother al-Muktafi, was a more sedentary figure but continued al-Mu&#x27;tamid&#x27;s policies, and was able to score a major victory over the Qarmatians, and reconquer the Tulunid domains.

All this came at the cost of gearing the state towards war: according to the historian Hugh N. Kennedy, based on a treasury document from the time of al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s accession, &quot;out of the total expenditure of 7915 dinars per day, some 5121 are entirely military, 1943 in areas (like riding animals and stables) which served both military and non-military and only 851 in areas like the bureaucracy and the harem which can be described as truly civilian (though even in this case, the bureaucrats&#x27; main purpose seems to have been to arrange the payment of the army). It seems reasonable to conclude that something over 80 per cent of recorded government expenditure was devoted to maintaining the army.&quot; Paying the army thus became the chief concern of the government, but it became an increasingly difficult proposition as the outlying provinces were lost. The situation was further exacerbated by the fact that in the remaining provinces, semi-autonomous governors, grandees and members of the dynasty were able to establish virtual latifundia, aided by the system of &quot;muqāṭa&#x27;a&quot;, a form of tax farming in exchange for a fixed tribute, which they often failed to pay. Even the revenues of the Sawad, the rich agricultural lands of Iraq, are known to have declined considerably at the time. Nevertheless, through stringent economy, and despite near-constant warfare, both al-Mu&#x27;tadid and al-Muktafi were able to leave a full treasury behind. Thus the restored Caliphate at the time of al-Muktafi&#x27;s death was less than half the size than in its heyday under Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), but it remained a powerful and viable state, with an army that, &quot;though it was very expensive, was probably the most effective in the Muslim world&quot;, and an almost unchallenged legitimacy as the true successors of Muhammad.

== Accession and the revolt of Ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz ==
In 908, al-Muktafi fell ill, and was evidently nearing his end. The issue of succession had been left open, and with the Caliph incapacitated, the vizier al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara&#x27;i took it upon himself to seek out a successor. Two different versions are told of the events: Miskawayh reports that the vizier sought the advice of the most important bureaucrats (&quot;kuttāb&quot;, sing. &quot;kātib&quot;), with Mahmud ibn Dawud ibn al-Jarrah suggesting the older and experienced Abdallah ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz, but Ali ibn al-Furat—who is usually portrayed as a villain by Miskawayh—proposing instead the thirteen-year-old Ja&#x27;far al-Muqtadir as someone weak, pliable, and easily manipulated by the senior officials. The vizier also consulted Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah, who refused to choose, and Muhammad ibn Abdun, whose opinion has not been recorded. In the end, the vizier concurred with Ibn al-Furat, and on al-Muktafi&#x27;s death Ja&#x27;far was proclaimed as heir and brought to the caliphal palace; when the testament of al-Muktafi was opened, he too had chosen his brother as his successor. A different story is reported by the Andalusi historian Arib, whereby the vizier dithered between the candidacies of Ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz and another older Abbasid prince, Muhammad ibn al-Mu&#x27;tamid. The choice of the latter would represent a major political departure, in effect a repudiation of al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s coup that had deprived the offspring of al-Mu&#x27;tamid from power, and of the officials and &quot;ghilmān&quot; that had underpinned al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s regime. The vizier indeed inclined towards Muhammad, but the latter prudently chose to await al-Muktafi&#x27;s death before accepting. Indeed, the Caliph recovered, and was informed that people were discussing both Ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz and Ibn al-Mu&#x27;tamid as his possible successors. This worried al-Muktafi, who in the presence of the &quot;qāḍīs&quot; as witnesses officially nominated Ja&#x27;far as his heir, before dying. The two stories highlight different aspects of al-Muqtadir&#x27;s accession: on the one hand, a cabal of officials choosing a weak and pliable ruler, &quot;a sinister development&quot; that inaugurated one &quot;of the most disastrous reigns in the whole of Abbasid history [...] a quarter of a century in which all of the work of [al-Muqtadir&#x27;s] predecessors would be undone&quot;, while on the other hand, the issue of dynastic succession, and especially the loyalty of al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s &quot;ghilmān&quot; to his family, evidently also played an important role.

Al-Muqtadir&#x27;s succession was unopposed, and proceeded with the customary ceremonies. The full treasury bequeathed by al-Mu&#x27;tadid and al-Muktafi meant that the donatives to the troops could easily be paid, as well as reviving the old practice of gifts to the members of the Hashimite families. The new caliph was also able to display his largess, and solicitude for his subjects, when he ordered the demolition of a &quot;suq&quot; erected by his predecessor near Bab al-Taq, where the merchants were forced to pay rent, instead of being able to offer their wares freely as before. This benefited the poor of the capital. Nevertheless, the intrigues surrounding his accession had not abated. The supporters of Ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz in particular remained determined to get their candidate on the throne. According to Arib, the vizier al-Abbas had been one of the chief conspirators, but had begun to acquiesce to al-Muqtadir&#x27;s rule, hoping to control him. His increasingly arrogant behaviour spurred the other conspirators on, and on 16 December 908, the Hamdanid commander al-Husayn ibn Hamdan led a group of men that killed the vizier as he was riding to his garden. The conspirators then sought to seize the young caliph as well, but the latter had managed to flee to the Hasani Palace, where he barricaded himself with his supporters. The &quot;ḥājib&quot; (chamberlain) Sawsan was the driving force behind the loyalists&#x27; resistance, urging the commanders Safi al-Hurami, Mu&#x27;nis al-Khadim, and Mu&#x27;nis al-Khazin, to defend the caliph. Al-Husayn tried the entire morning to gain entrance, but failed; and then abruptly, and without notifying his fellow conspirators, fled the city to his home of Mosul. In the meantime, the other conspirators, led by Mahmud ibn Dawud ibn al-Jarrah, had assembled in a house and proclaimed Ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz as caliph. This had the support of some of the &quot;qāḍīs&quot;, who regarded al-Muqtadir&#x27;s accession as illegal, but others were opposed, reflecting the uncertainty and indecision of the conspirators themselves. Along with Ibn Hamdan&#x27;s departure, this indecision allowed al-Muqtadir&#x27;s followers to regain the upper hand: Mu&#x27;nis al-Khadim led his &quot;ghilmān&quot; on boats across the Tigris to the house where Ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz and the conspirators had gathered, and dispersed them—Arib records that Mu&#x27;nis&#x27; troops attacked the assembled supporters of Ibn al-Mu&#x27;tazz with arrows, while Miskawayh claims that they fled as soon as the troops appeared.

Whatever the true events, the coup collapsed swiftly. Ali ibn al-Furat, the only one among the leading &quot;kuttāb&quot; to not have had any contact with the conspirators, was named vizier. Muhammad ibn al-Jarrah remained a fugitive and a price was placed on his head. Ibn al-Furat tried to limit retaliations and several of the prisoners were released, but many of the conspirators were executed. The troops, whose loyalty had been decisive, received another donative equal to that of the accession. The &quot;ḥājib&quot; Sawsan, however, was soon purged, as he grew arrogant and overbearing: he was arrested by Safi al-Hurami and died under house arrest a few days later.

== Reign ==
===The queen-mother Shaghab and the harem===
Al-Muqtadir was the first underage Caliph in Muslim history, and as such during the early years of his reign, a regency council (&quot;al-sāda&quot;, &quot;the masters&quot;) was set up, comprising, according to al-Tanukhi, his mother Shaghab, her personal agent (&quot;qahramāna&quot;) Umm Musa, her sister Khatif, and another former concubine of al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s, Dastanbuwayh. Saghab, usually known simply as &quot;al-Sayyida&quot; (&quot;the Lady&quot;), utterly &quot;dominated her son to the exclusion of the other women in his harem, including his wives and concubines&quot;; al-Muqtadir would spend much of his time in his mother&#x27;s quarters. As a result, government business came to be determined in the private quarters of the sovereign rather than the public palace dominated by the bureaucracy, and Saghab became one of the most influential figures of her son&#x27;s reign, interfering in the appointments and dismissals of officials, making financial contributions to the treasury, and undertaking charitable activities. Indeed, a common feature of all accounts by medieval sources is that &quot;mentions of al-Muqtadir are indissolubly tied to mentions not only of his viziers, but also of his female household&quot;, and this was one of the main points of criticism for subsequent historians. Thus the contemporary historian al-Mas&#x27;udi condemned al-Muqtadir&#x27;s reign as one where &quot;those who had power were women, servants and others&quot;, while the Caliph himself &quot;did not concern himself with State affairs&quot;, leaving his officials to govern the state. Likewise, the 13th-century chronicler Ibn al-Tiqtaqa, regarded al-Muqtadir as a &quot;squanderer&quot; for whom &quot;matters concerning his reign were run by women and servants, while he was busy satisfying his pleasure&quot;. Shaghab in particular is usually portrayed as a &quot;rapacious and short-sighted schemer&quot; by later historians.

Shaghab spent most of her life confined in the harem, where she had her own parallel bureaucracy, with her own &quot;kuttāb&quot; devoted to both civil and military affairs. Her power was such that when her secretary Ahmad al-Khasibi was appointed vizier in 925 due to her own and her sister&#x27;s influence, he regretted the appointment, since his post as &quot;kātib&quot; to the queen-mother was more beneficial to himself. The most important members of her court were the stewardesses or &quot;qahramāna&quot;, who were free to exit the harem and act as her agents in the outside world. These women wielded considerable influence, especially as intermediaries between the harem and the court; their influence with Shaghab could lead to the dismissal of even the viziers. The first incumbent was one Fatima, who drowned in the Tigris when her boat was caught in a storm. She was followed by Umm Musa, a descendant of one of the Abbasid clan&#x27;s junior branches. Her plotting for her favourites, the corruption of her family, and her hostility towards the &quot;good vizier&quot; Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah, who was dismissed due to her machinations in 917, are underlined in the chronicles of the period. However, when she married her niece to Abu&#x27;l-Abbas, a grandson of al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861), her rivals were quick to accuse her of aspiring to overthrow the Caliph and place her nephew on the throne. In 922/3, she was arrested and replaced by Thumal, who tortured Umm Musa, her brother, and her sister, until they had revealed where her treasure—reportedly valued at one million gold dinars—was hidden. Thumal enjoyed a reputation for cruelty; her first master, Abu Dulaf, had used her to punish servants who displeased him. Another &quot;qahramāna&quot;, Zaydan, was the antithesis of Thumal: her house was used to jail several senior officials after they were dismissed, but it was a comfortable captivity, and she often provided refuge to those persecuted by their political rivals.

===Policies and events===
The stand that had been made during the last four reigns to stay the decline of the Abbasid power at last came to an end. From al-Muqtadir&#x27;s reign on, the Abbasids would decline. Yet, at the same time, many names that would become famous in the world of literature and science lived during this and the following reigns. Among the best known are: Ishaq ibn Hunayn (d. 911) (son of Hunayn ibn Ishaq), a physician and translator of Greek philosophical works into Arabic; ibn Fadlan, explorer; al Battani (d. 923), astronomer; al-Tabari (d. 923), historian and theologian; al-Razi (d. 930), a philosopher who made fundamental and lasting contributions to the fields of medicine and chemistry; al-Farabi (d. 950), chemist and philosopher; Abu Nasr Mansur (d. 1036), mathematician; Alhazen (d. 1040), mathematician; al-Biruni (d. 1048), mathematician, astronomer, physicist; Omar Khayyám (d. 1123), poet, mathematician, and astronomer; and Mansur al-Hallaj, a mystic, writer and teacher of Sufism most famous for his self-proclaimed attainment of unity with God (which was misunderstood and disputed as divinity), his poetry, and for his execution for heresy by al-Muqtadir.

By the time of al-Muqtadir&#x27;s reign, there had been war for some years between the Muslims and the Greeks in Asia, with heavy losses for the most part on the side of the Muslims, many of whom were taken prisoner. The Byzantine frontier, however, began to be threatened by Bulgarian hordes. So the Byzantine Empress Zoe Karbonopsina sent two ambassadors to Baghdad with the view of securing an armistice and arranging for the ransom of the Muslim prisoners. The embassy was graciously received and peace restored. A sum of 120,000 golden pieces was paid for the freedom of the captives. All this only added to the disorder of the city. The people, angry at the success of the &quot;Infidels&quot; in Asia Minor and at similar losses in Persia, complained that the Caliph cared for none of these things and, instead of seeking to restore the prestige of Islam, passed his days and nights with slave-girls and musicians. Uttering such reproaches, they threw stones at the Imam, as in the Friday service he named the Caliph in the public prayers.

Some twelve years later, al-Muqtadir was subjected to the indignity of deposition. The leading courtiers having conspired against him, he was forced to abdicate in favour of his brother al-Qahir, but, after scenes of rioting and plunder, and loss of thousands of lives, the conspirators found that they were not supported by the troops. Al-Muqtadir, who had been kept in safety, was again placed upon the throne. The state&#x27;s finances fell after this event into so wretched a state that nothing was left with which to pay the city guards. Al-Muqtadir was eventually slain outside the city gate in 320 AH (932 AD).

Al-Muqtadir&#x27;s long reign had brought the Abbasids to their lowest ebb. Northern Africa was lost and Egypt nearly. Mosul had thrown off its dependence and the Greeks could make raids at pleasure along the poorly protected borders. Yet in the East formal recognition of the Caliphate remained in place, even by those who virtually claimed their independence; and nearer home, the terrible Carmathians had been for the time put down. In Baghdad, al-Muqtadir, the mere tool of a venal court, was at the mercy of foreign guards, who, commanded for the most part by Turkish and other officers of foreign descent, were frequently breaking out into rebellion. Because of al-Muqtadir&#x27;s ineffective rule, the prestige which his immediate predecessors had regained was lost, and the Abbasid throne became again the object of contempt at home and a tempting prize for attack from abroad.

===Rivalry between his Court officials===

At court, Mu&#x27;nis was an early and staunch opponent of Ibn al-Furat, and an ally of the latter&#x27;s main rival, Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah and his faction. The conflict between the two came to a head during Ibn al-Furat&#x27;s third vizierate, in 923–924. This was a troubled period, which saw Mu&#x27;nis sent to quasi-exile in Raqqa, the widespread torture of the Banu&#x27;l-Furat&#x27;s political opponents, as well as the resurgence of the Qarmatian threat with the sack of Basra and the destruction of the Hajj caravan returning from Mecca. All this culminated in a military coup, the deposition of Ibn al-Furat, the recall of Mu&#x27;nis, and the subsequent execution of the aged vizier and his son.

This marked the apogee of Mu&#x27;nis&#x27;s career: he was now in virtual control of the government and a decisive voice in the appointment of Ibn al-Furat&#x27;s successors as viziers. At the same time, however, his power created a widening rift between him and the Caliph, with al-Muqtadir even plotting to assassinate his leading general in 927. In the summer of the same year, Mu&#x27;nis led an army to the border around Samosata, which the Byzantines had sacked. The Byzantines managed to catch the Abbasid army by surprise and inflicted a defeat upon them, killing 400 men. In the same year Mu&#x27;nis, with Hamdanid help, successfully defended Baghdad itself against a determined Qarmatian invasion. The Qarmatian raids were particularly troublesome: not only did they devastate the fertile districts of the Sawad—the government&#x27;s chief source of revenue—but also diminished the prestige of the Caliph and the dynasty, especially after the Qarmatians sacked Mecca in 930 and carried off the Black Stone, precipitating the power struggle in Baghdad between Mu&#x27;nis and the court faction.

===Unsuccessful coup against him===
In 928, following the dismissal of his favourite, Ali ibn Isa, from the vizierate, Mu&#x27;nis launched a coup and deposed al-Muqtadir and installed his half-brother al-Qahir in his place, but reneged after a few days. Mu&#x27;nis now possessed virtually dictatorial authority over the Abbasid government.

===Assassination and succession===
In 931, al-Muqtadir rallied enough support to force him to leave Baghdad, but in 932, after gathering troops, Mu&#x27;nis marched onto Baghdad and defeated the caliphal army before the city walls, with al-Muqtadir falling in the field. Triumphant, Mu&#x27;nis now installed al-Qahir as caliph, but the two quickly became estranged. The new caliph resumed contacts with the defeated court faction, and found himself soon under confinement in his palace. Nevertheless, in August 933 al-Qahir managed to lure Mu&#x27;nis and his main lieutenants to the palace, where they were executed.

==Family==
Al-Muqtadir&#x27;s only wife was Hurra. She was the daughter of Commander-in-Chief, Badr al-Mut&#x27;adidi. He was generous towards her. After his death, she remarried a man of lower status. Al-Muqtadir had numerous concubines. One of his concubines was Zalum. She was a Greek, and the mother of al-Muqtadir&#x27;s eldest son, the future caliph al-Radi and Prince Harun. Another concubine was Dimna. She was the mother of Prince Ishaq, and the grandmother of the future caliph al-Qadir. Another concubine was Khalub also known as Zuhra. She was a Greek, and was the mother of the future caliph al-Muttaqi. Another concubine was Mash&#x27;ala. She was a Slavic, and the mother of the future caliph al-Muti&#x27;. Another concubine was Khamrah. She was the mother of Prince Isa, and is described as having been very charitable to the poor and the needy. She died on 3 July 988, and was buried in Rusafah Cemetery. Another concubine was the mother of Prince Ibrahim. Another concubine was the mother of a son, born in 909. She was buried in Rusafah Cemetery. Al-Muqtadir had two daughters. One died in 911, and was buried beside the grave of her grandfather caliph al-Mu&#x27;tadid in the Dar of Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir. The second died in 917, and was buried in Rusafah Cemetery.

<text>Abū al-Manṣūr Muḥammad ibn [[Al-Mu&#x27;tadid|Aḥmad]] ibn [[Al-Muwaffaq|Ṭalḥa]] ibn [[Al-Mutawakkil|Jaʿfar]] ibn [[al-Mu&#x27;tasim|Muḥammad]] ibn [[Harun al-Rashid|Hārūn]] al-Qāhir bi&#x27;Llāh (), usually known simply by his regnal title al-Qahir bi&#x27;Llah (), was the nineteenth caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate from 932 to 934. He was born 286 AH (899 C.E.) and died 339 AH (950 C.E.).

==Early life==
Al-Qahir was a son of the 16th Abbasid caliph, al-Mu&#x27;tadid (), and brother of the 18th Caliph, al-Muqtadir (). The mother of al-Qahir was a concubine called Fitnah. His full name was Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Mu&#x27;tadid al-Qahir bi&#x27;llah, and his was Abu Mansur.

==Rise to the throne==
Al-Qahir came to the throne as part of his brother&#x27;s conflict with the increasingly powerful commander-in-chief, Mu&#x27;nis al-Muzaffar. He was first chosen as Caliph in March 929, when Mu&#x27;nis launched a coup and deposed al-Muqtadir. Although al-Muqtadir was restored after a few days, Mu&#x27;nis now possessed virtually dictatorial authority over the Abbasid government.

In 932, after another breach with al-Muqtadir, Mu&#x27;nis marched on Baghdad. Al-Muqtadir tried to confront him, and was killed in the ensuing battle. However, in the subsequent assembly of dignitaries, Mu&#x27;nis&#x27; candidacy of al-Muqtadir&#x27;s son Ahmad (the future al-Radi) was rejected in favour of al-Qahir (31 October 932). He was then 35 years old.

==Caliphate==
The new caliph had a pronounced &quot;headstrong and vindictive personality&quot;, according to Dominique Sourdel, which made itself felt soon after his accession, when he tortured his brother&#x27;s sons and officials, as well as al-Muqtadir&#x27;s mother Shaghab, to extract their fortune. He was more energetic than his predecessor and cultivated an image of austerity and puritanism at his court, in deliberate contrast to the extravagantly dissolute life led by al-Muqtadir, but behind the scenes he too indulged in drunkenness.

Trying to counteract the influence of Mu&#x27;nis and of the vizier Ibn Muqla, who controlled government, and re-assert the power of his office, al-Qahir resumed contacts with the defeated court faction through Muhammad ibn Yaqut. This alarmed Mu&#x27;nis and his supporters, but they were too late. In July 933, al-Qahir struck: the plans of the chamberlain Ibn Yalbaq to depose him were thwarted, and he and Mu&#x27;nis were arrested and executed, while Ibn Muqla was forced to flee the capital.

Al-Qahir appointed Muhammad ibn al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah as vizier. Al-Qahir embarked on a firmly anti-Shi&#x27;a policy, declaring himself the &quot;Avenger of the enemies of the Faith&quot; (&quot;al-muntaqim min aʿdāʾ dīn Allāh&quot;), a slogan which he even put on his coins. Despite his support of the Caliph&#x27;s anti-Shi&#x27;a policies, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim was soon dismissed in favour of Ahmad al-Khasibi. Like his predecessor, however, al-Khasibi was unable to overcome the mounting financial crisis of the state.

The contemporary Baghdadi historian al-Mas&#x27;udi, in his &quot;Meadows of Gold&quot;, reports that &quot;His fits of violence made him the fear and terror of his subjects&quot;. He went about armed with a lance, striking down those who displeased him. However, the very &quot;inconstancy of his behaviour and the horror inspired by his rages&quot; alienated the populace and the court alike, and prepared the ground for his downfall.

==Downfall and death==
The exiled vizier Ibn Muqla continued plotting against al-Qahir; he won over the caliphal guard, which on 24 April 934 staged a coup and took the Caliph prisoner while the latter was drunk.

Refusing to abdicate in favour of al-Radi (), he was blinded and cast into prison. According to al-Mas&#x27;udi, al-Radi &quot;kept news of him hidden&quot;, so that he vanished from common knowledge. He was not freed until eleven years later, when al-Mustakfi () came to the throne and discovered him locked away in a remote room in the palace. He lived the remainder of his life as a beggar, dying in October 950.

<text>A Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) is an Australian visa category issued to persons who had been recognised as refugees fleeing persecution. TPVs are issued to persons who apply for refugee status after making an unauthorised arrival in Australia, and is the main type of visa issued to refugees when released from Australian immigration detention facilities. TPVs were initially introduced by the Howard government on 20 October 1999, abolished by the Rudd government in August 2008, reintroduced by the Abbott government in October 2013, before being abolished again by the Albanese government in February 2023.

After being granted a TPV, refugees are required to reapply after three years, in case conditions change in their homeland. TPV holders are eligible for only some of the special settlement services funded by the Commonwealth to assist new arrivals in Australia. Unlike permanent visa (PV) holders, TPV recipients have no family reunion rights and no right to re-enter the country if they depart Australia. TPV holders do have the right to work and have access to job matching by Centrelink. They are also eligible for Special Benefit, Rent Assistance, Family Tax Benefit, Child Care Benefit, Medicare, Early Health Assessment and Intervention Program, torture and trauma counselling, and English as a second language classes (for TPV minors only).

==Criticism and abolition ==
The scheme was controversial, with the government claiming it was a necessary response to the misuse of the asylum process by unauthorised arrivals. Refugee advocates described TPVs as a cruel way to treat people which left asylum seekers with an uncertain future. The granting of a TPV prevents a refugee from applying for permanent protection.

The Rudd government committed itself to abolition of TPVs as part of its Budget 2008–09 announcements made in May 2008. The regulations providing for the granting of permanent protection visas (PPVs) to all refugees who had established a claim for protection in Australia were introduced into the federal Parliament in August 2008. From that date, a person applying in Australia for refugee protection was granted a PPV. Individuals who held a TPV became eligible to apply for a Resolution of Status Visa, which was akin to a PPV, which was granted subject to the TPV applicant undergoing health and ASIO/AFP security checks.

==Re-instatement==
On 18 October 2013, the Abbott government announced the re-instatement of the TPVs. On 2 December 2013, Labor and the Greens voted in the Senate to disallow the return of TPVs.

On 11 September 2014 the High Court ruled the issuing of TPVs without the appropriate legislative powers invalid. To overcome the High Court objections, on 5 December 2014, legislation was passed to reintroduce TPVs to specifically deal with the backlog of 30,000 asylum seekers yet to be processed left by the former Labor government. The legislation was passed by the Coalition government with support of the cross bench in the Senate.

<text>Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Muhammad ibn Ja&#x27;far al-Muqtadir (; 1 January 909 – 13 December 940), usually simply known by his regnal name al-Radi bi&#x27;llah (), was the twentieth Caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate, reigning from 934 to his death. He died on 23 December 940 at the age of 31. His reign marked the end of the caliph&#x27;s political power and the rise of military strongmen, who competed for the title of .

== Early life ==
The future al-Radi was born on 20 December 909, to the caliph al-Muqtadir () and a Greek-born slave concubine named Zalum. At the age of four, he received the nominal governorship of Egypt and the Maghreb, and was sent with the commander-in-chief Mu&#x27;nis al-Muzaffar to Egypt, who became his tutor.

When Mu&#x27;nis and al-Muqtadir fell out in 927, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas and the vizier Ibn Muqla tried to mediate between his father and the powerful commander-in-chief, but to no avail. In 930, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas received the governorship over Syria from his father, although he remained in Baghdad, residing in his palace in the Muharrim quarter of the city. In the next year, rumours circulated that Mu&#x27;nis intended to abduct Abu&#x27;l-Abbas, take him to Syria, and declare him caliph there. This alarmed al-Muqtadir, who had his son brought to reside with him in the caliphal palace.

When his father was killed in 932, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas was proposed as a successor, but eventually his uncle al-Qahir () was chosen. Abu&#x27;l-Abbas was imprisoned as a dangerous rival, and his properties confiscated. He remained confined until the deposition of al-Qahir, when he was freed and raised to the throne (24 April 934).

== Caliphate ==
The contemporary historian al-Masudi describes him as pleasing in appearance, using scents in large amounts, and of a generous nature, being notable for the lavish gifts he gave his courtiers. According to al-Masudi, the caliph &quot;enjoyed talking of the men and things of the past and sought out scholars and men of letters and frequently summoned them to his presence and lavished marks of his liberality upon them&quot;. Unlike the forceful al-Qahir, he quickly became a figurehead ruler, while ambitious men seized authority in the state.

After the distinguished former vizier Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah declined to be reappointed to the office on account of his advanced age, Ibn Muqla, who had led the conspiracy against al-Qahir, received the post. However, for the first months of the reign, Muhammad ibn Yaqut continued to be the most powerful member of the court until his downfall in April 935; only then did Ibn Muqla truly gain control of the administration. In 935, the government was forced to take measures to confront the turmoil in Baghdad because of the behaviour of some Hanbali fanatics. Supported by popular sentiment, they accosted people in the streets, forced their way into private dwellings, emptied vessels of wine wherever found, broke musical instruments and mistreated female singers, pried into the details of trade, beat up their Ash&#x27;ari rivals, and generally acted in an arbitrary manner against anyone who transgressed against their strict interpretation of Islamic law and custom.

By this time, the greatest threat faced by the Caliphate was the increasing independence of the regional governors, who had taken advantage of the internal quarrels in the Abbasid court to strengthen their own control over their provinces and withheld the taxes due to Baghdad, leaving the central government crippled. Ibn Muqla resolved to reassert his control over the neighbouring provinces by military force, and chose the Hamdanid-controlled Jazira as his first target: in 935 he launched a campaign that took the Hamdanid capital, Mosul, but he was forced to return to Baghdad. Another attempt in 936 to launch a campaign against the rebellious governor of Wasit, Muhammad ibn Ra&#x27;iq, failed to even get started. Coupled with his failure to counter the mounting financial crisis, this last disaster led to Ibn Muqla&#x27;s downfall. In April 936, Ibn Muqla was arrested by Muhammad ibn Yaqut&#x27;s brother, al-Muzaffar, who forced al-Radi to dismiss him as vizier.

Ibn Muqla&#x27;s dismissal marked the end of the independence of the Abbasid caliphs, for, shortly thereafter, al-Radi appointed Ibn Ra&#x27;iq to the new post of (&quot;commander of commanders&quot;), a military office that became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of what remained of the Caliphate. The caliph retained only control of Baghdad and its immediate environs, while all government affairs passed into the hands of Ibn Ra&#x27;iq and his secretary. The name of the was even commemorated in the &quot;khutba&quot; of the Friday prayer, alongside that of the caliph.

Al-Radi is commonly spoken of as the last of the real Caliphs: the last to deliver orations at the Friday service, to hold assemblies with philosophers to discuss the questions of the day, or to take counsel on the affairs of State; the last to distribute largess among the needy, or to interpose to temper the severity of cruel officers.

And yet, with all this he was the mere dependent of another. Beyond the Wasir&#x27;s shadow, there was little left at home. And abroad, even less: the rich East was gone, Berber Africa and Egypt also, along with the greater part of Syria and Mesopotamia; Mosul was independent; peninsular Arabia was held by Carmathians and native chieftains; even Basra and Wasit rose in revolt. The advance of the &#x27;Greeks&#x27; (Byzantine Empire) was stayed only by the brave Hamdanid prince who was deservedly styled &quot;Sayf al-Daula&quot; &#x27;Sword of the Nation&#x27;.

<doc id="1091247" wikidata="Q1344225" url="?curid=1091247" title="Rashid Karami">
<text>Rashid Karami (; 30 December 1921 – 1 June 1987) was a Lebanese statesman. He is considered one of the most important political figures in Lebanon for more than 30 years, including during much of the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990), and served as prime minister eight times, according to the Guinness Book of World Records this would make him the most elected democratic prime minister in history. He was assassinated in 1987.

==Early life and education==
Rashid Karami was born in Tripoli, North Lebanon, on 30 December 1921 into one of Lebanon&#x27;s most prominent Sunni political families. He was the eldest son of Abdul Hamid Karami, an architect of Lebanese independence from France. His father was also the Grand Mufti, or supreme religious judge, of Tripoli, and served as Prime Minister in 1945. Rashid Karami graduated from Cairo University with a law degree in 1946.

==Career==
Following his graduation, Karami practiced law in Cairo for three years. On his return to Lebanon, he established a legal practice in Tripoli. He was first elected to the National Assembly in 1951 to fill a vacancy caused by the death of his father. He retained this seat until his death in 1987. One month after being elected he was appointed minister of justice in the government led by Prime Minister Hussein Al Oweini. In 1953, he was also appointed minister of the economy and social affairs in Abdallah El-Yafi&#x27;s government.

From 1955 to 1987 Karami held office eight times as prime minister, under every President. These terms were from 1955 to 1956, 1958 to 1960, 1961 to 1964, 1965 to 1966, 1966 to 1968, 1969 to 1970, 1975 to 1976, and from 1984 until his death. Karami was thirty-four years old when he first became Prime Minister in 1955. He was the Minister of Finance from 1958 to 1960, 1961 to 1964, 1965 to 1966, 1966 to 1968, 1969 to 1970 and 1975 to 1976. He was the Minister of Defense from 1958 to 1960, 1965, 1975 to 1976. He also served as Minister of Foreign Affairs several times.

He had a stormy relationship with Lebanon&#x27;s Presidents, who appointed him because of his political connections, despite substantial political differences. He was popularly known as a man for all crises because of a penchant of Lebanon&#x27;s presidents to turn to him in times of major national strife or political upheaval.

==Personality==

What made the lawyer from the northern port city of Tripoli so often the man of the hour was a talent for leading the opposition without burning his bridges with the Lebanese president.
Mr. Karami enjoyed political prominence, and an unparalleled popularity. Unlike Nabih Berri of the Shiite Muslims and Walid Jumblat, the Druse leader, he had no militia. While his public statements were often in the florid style common among Arab politicians, he was a skillful practitioner of the intricacies of Lebanese politics. He repeatedly strove to remain as leader of the Government until he decided it was useless to carry on amid the turmoil and violence of Lebanese politics.
While he was fluent in French and had a good command of English, he was always accompanied by an interpreter in interviews with foreign correspondents, because he insisted on speaking Arabic. He was celebrated for being a Statesman with courtly manners, soft-spokenness and taste in clothes. He [...] was often described in the Lebanese press as &quot;al effendi&quot; - &quot;the gentleman.&quot;
==Policies==
Karami was a strong proponent of increasing political power of Lebanon&#x27;s Muslim community, which in his time increased to outnumber the Christian population for the first time in Lebanese history, causing major ripples in the social fabric of the country. He attempted, without success, to gain greater representation for Muslims in the National Assembly, where they were allocated 45 percent of the seats, a figure that was not adjusted to take account of changing demographics. In 1976, Karami helped broker an agreement to provide for equal parliamentary representation of Christians and Muslims, but this agreement was never implemented. One concession that was made by Christian politicians was to allow legislation signed by the President to be countersigned by the Prime Minister, from 1974 onward, giving the Prime Minister (always a Sunni Muslim) an effective veto.

Karami was a part of the Muslim-Leftist faction in Lebanese politics. During the 1950s, he was a political follower of the Pan-Arabism of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. He was first appointed Prime Minister by President Camille Chamoun on 19 September 1955. By the following year, however, he had seriously fallen out with Chamoun over the latter&#x27;s refusal to sever diplomatic relations with the western powers that had attacked Egypt in the 1956 Suez Crisis of 1956. He again opposed Chamoun in the 1958 Lebanon Crisis, a Nasserist uprising with considerable support in the Muslim community which erupted in May 1958 and attempted to topple the government and join Egypt and Syria in the new United Arab Republic. By September, when Chamoun had quelled the uprising with the aid of United States Marines, Karami formed a government of national unity under the new president, Fuad Chehab.

===The Arab–Israeli conflict===
Karami served four more times as prime minister throughout the 1960s. During this time, he championed the Palestinian cause, and is believed to have argued for Lebanon to play a more active role against Israel in the Six-Day War of June 1967, a position which was unpopular with many Christians. Increasing clashes between the Lebanese army and the Palestine Liberation Organization forced his resignation in April 1970, but he returned to office in 1975 after an accord had been signed between Lebanon and the PLO. In August that year, however, Suleiman Frangieh, an enemy of Karami, was elected president. Karami resigned and was succeeded by Saeb Salam.

==Civil war==
The Civil war erupted in Lebanon in April 1975. Multiple factions were involved and the political and military situation was extremely complex, but broadly speaking, the civil war was fought mainly between right-wing, mainly Christian militias (the most prominent of which was the Phalange), and leftist, mainly Muslim militias and their Palestinian allies. Desperate to stabilize the situation, Frangieh dismissed Prime Minister Rashid al-Solh and called on his old adversary Karami to form a government on 1 July. He retreated somewhat from his previous strong support for the Palestinians and supported the Syrian military intervention of June 1976. Despite Karami&#x27;s political connections and many years of experience, he was unable to end the war, however, and on 8 December 1976 he resigned. Elias Sarkis, who had succeeded Frangieh as president in September 1976, appointed Selim Hoss as the new Prime Minister.

Karami had his militia in Tripoli. He was reconciled to his old enemy, Suleiman Frangieh, in the late 1970s, after Frangieh had fallen out with the Phalangist militia leader, Bachir Gemayel. Together with Frangieh and Walid Jumblatt, Karami founded the National Salvation Front, pro-Syrian coalition of Sunni Muslim, Druze, and some Christians, mainly in the north of Lebanon in July 1983. The National Salvation Front stood in opposition to the presidency of Amine Gemayel and the pact between Lebanon and Israel that was financially supported by the US.

In April 1984, following conferences in Switzerland, Karami became Prime Minister for the eighth time, heading government of national reconciliation. This period saw increasing Syrian influence in the wake of the partial Israeli withdrawal following their invasion of Lebanon in 1982, which Karami had strongly opposed. In 1986 he rejected the National Agreement to Solve the Lebanese Crisis, which had been drafted with minimal Sunni Muslim participation. This opposition created a tense relationship with President Amine Gemayel. Continuing problems led Karami to resign on 4 May 1987, but Gemayel, seeing no viable alternative, refused to accept his resignation.

==Personal life and death==
Karami never married.
On 1 June 1987, Karami was killed when a bomb weighing 300 g, planted behind his seat on the Aérospatiale Puma helicopter he was taking from Tripoli to Beirut, exploded. It was triggered remotely after the helicopter took off from an army airfield; its remote-control trigger had a range of 10 km. Karami was the only one killed in the blast. Interior Minister Abdullah Rasi and at least three other aides and crew members aboard the helicopter were reported wounded. In 1994, Maronite militia leader Samir Geagea was accused of ordering the assassination.

===Burial===
Rashid Karami was buried in a cemetery in the Bab al Raml neighborhood of Tripoli.

The condolences were received in the International fair of Tripoli, a project designed by Oscar Niemeyer.

===Perpetrators===
Following the assassination, an unidentified man called a Western news agency in Beirut and claimed responsibility for the killing on behalf of the previously unknown Lebanese Secret Army, .

In 1999, Samir Geagea and ten other members of the Lebanese Forces were found guilty of the assassination. Soon after Syria&#x27;s withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005, Samir Geagea and the others were provisionally pardoned and released from jail. However, it has been suggested, by Ashraf Rifi, that a Syrian officer purposely led Karami to the booby-trapped helicopter to assassinate him.

<text>Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn Jaʿfar al-Muqtadir () better known by his regnal title al-Muttaqi (908 – July 968, ) was the Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad from 940 to 944. His reign marked the start of the &#x27;later Abbasid period&#x27; (940–1258).

==Biography==
Al-Muttaqi was the son of al-Muqtadir and his concubine named Khalub also known as Zuhra. She was a Greek, and was the mother of Ibrahim (the future Caliph al-Muttaqi). His full name was Ibrahim ibn Jaʿfar al-Muqtadir and his Abu Ishaq.

Of such little importance the Caliphate had become by now that when the previous Caliph al-Radi died, Bajkam, &quot;amir al-umara&quot; (Amir of Amirs), contented himself with despatching to Baghdad his secretary, who assembled the chief men to elect a successor. The choice fell on the deceased Caliph&#x27;s brother al-Muttaqi, who assumed the office after it had been some days vacant; and whose first act was to send a banner and dress of honor to Bajkam, a needless confirmation of his rank.

Bajkam, before returning to Wasit, where he now held his court, went out on a hunting party, and met his death at the hands of a band of marauding Kurds. The Capital again became the scene of renewed anarchy. 

==Rivalry between officials==
With vizier Abu Abdallah al-Baridi gone, on 3 July Kurankij was appointed as &quot;amir al-umara&quot; by the powerless caliph al-Muttaqi. On the same night, the Turk Takinak was arrested and drowned. Kurankij chose Abu&#x27;l-Faraj ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Isfahani as his secretary (&quot;katib&quot;), and called on Ali ibn Isa ibn al-Jarrah and his brother Abd al-Rahman to become heads of the administration, but without the title of vizier. This arrangement did not last long, however: within a few days, the Banu&#x27;l-Jarrah brothers were dismissed, and Abu Ishaq Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Qarariti appointed vizier. As al-Baridi had gathered new forces and come up from his base in Basra to Wasit, Kurankij sent his own troops under another Daylamite commander, Ispahan, to confront them. On the news of their approach, the Baridis abandoned Wasit and retreated to Basra.

In the meantime, a previous &quot;amir al-umara&quot;, Muhammad ibn Ra&#x27;iq, who had fled to Syria, was strengthened by an influx of Turkic commanders leaving Baghdad, and received a letter from al-Muttaqi inviting his return to the Abbasid capital. When Kurankij received news of Ibn Ra&#x27;iq&#x27;s march on Baghdad, he recalled Ispahan from Wasit, which almost immediately was captured by the Baridis. On 22 August, he also dismissed the vizier al-Qarariti and replaced him with Abu Ja&#x27;far Muhammad ibn Qasim al-Karkhi.

As Ibn Ra&#x27;iq approached Baghdad, Kurankij exited the city and made for Ukbara. The two armies fought for several days, but Ibn Ra&#x27;iq was unable to secure victory. Nevertheless, on 23 August a detachment of Ibn Ra&#x27;iq&#x27;s army under Ibn Muqatil entered Baghdad, followed two days later by the bulk of Ibn Ra&#x27;iq&#x27;s army, with Kurankij following behind a day later. Kurankij and his men were reportedly contemptuous of their opponent, and Ibn Ra&#x27;iq himself is said to have contemplated returning to Syria. But in a fight that broke out in the city itself, some of Ibn Ra&#x27;iq&#x27;s men managed to attack the Daylamites from behind. The Daylamites panicked and were routed, as they were also being attacked by the populace. Kurankij went into hiding, and Ibn Ra&#x27;iq&#x27;s ascendancy was secured. On 22 September, Ibn Ra&#x27;iq had the surviving Daylamites executed, and on the next day, he was raised to &quot;amir al-umara&quot;. Kurankij was discovered and imprisoned in the palace.

Muhammad ibn Ra&#x27;iq, Caliph&#x27;s &quot;amīr al-umarāʾ&quot;, persuaded the Caliph to flee with him to Mosul.

Al-Muttaqi was welcomed there by the Hamdanid dynasty, who organized a campaign to restore him to the capital. However, their ends were purely selfish; they assassinated Ibn Ra&#x27;iq, and having added his Syrian government to their own, turned their ambition towards Baghdad. The Hamdanid chief, with the title of Nasir al-Dawla, advanced on Baghdad with the Caliph.

But, however powerful the Hamdanid chiefs were at home amongst their Arab brethren, and splendid their victories over the Greeks, they found it a different thing to rule at Baghdad, due to foreign mercenaries and the well-organised Turkish forces in the city.

And so in less than a year, the Hamdanid chieftains had to return to Mosul; for a Turkish general called Tuzun entered Baghdad in triumph, and was saluted as &quot;amir al-umara&quot;. However, fresh proceedings against his enemy obliged Tuzun to quit the capital; and during his absence a conspiracy broke out which placed the Caliph in danger, and obliged him again to appeal to the Hamdanid prince for help. Troops sent in response enabled him to escape; he fled to Mosul and after that to Nusaybin.

Shortly after, peace being restored between Tuzun and the Hamdanid chiefs, al-Muttaqi took up his residence at Raqqa — a fugitive in the city which had so often been the proud court of his illustrious ancestors.

==Downfall and succession==
Later, al-Muttaqi threw himself into the hands of Tuzun, who swore with the most sacred oaths that he would render true and faithful service. But he soon after deposed him and had him blinded. The same day, Tuzun installed the ex-caliph&#x27;s cousin as his successor, with the title of al-Mustakfi, &quot;For whom the Lord suffices&quot;.

<text>The Fourier operator is the kernel of the Fredholm integral of the first kind that defines the continuous Fourier transform, and is a two-dimensional function when it corresponds to the Fourier transform of one-dimensional functions. It is complex-valued and has a constant (typically unity) magnitude everywhere. When depicted, e.g. for teaching purposes, it may be visualized by its separate real and imaginary parts, or as a colour image using a colour wheel to denote phase.

It is usually denoted by a capital letter &quot;F&quot; in script font (formula_1), e.g. the Fourier transform of a function formula_2 would be written using the operator as formula_3.

It may be thought of as a limiting case for when the size of the discrete Fourier transform increases without bound while its spatial resolution also increases without bound, so as to become both continuous and not necessarily periodic.

==Visualization==
The Fourier operator defines a continuous two-dimensional function that extends along time and frequency axes, outwards to infinity in all four directions. This is analogous to the DFT matrix but, in this case, is continuous and infinite in extent. The value of the function at any point is such that it has the same magnitude everywhere. Along any fixed value of time, the value of the function varies as a complex exponential in frequency. Likewise along any fixed value of frequency the value of the function varies as a complex exponential in time. A portion of the infinite Fourier operator is shown in the illustration below.

Any slice parallel to either of the axes, through the Fourier operator, is a complex exponential, i.e. the real part is a cosine wave and the imaginary part is a sine wave of the same frequency as the real part.

Diagonal slices through the Fourier operator give rise to chirps. Thus rotation of the Fourier operator gives rise to the fractional Fourier transform, which is related to the chirplet transform.

<doc id="1091253" wikidata="Q293640" url="?curid=1091253" title="Al-Mustakfi">
<text>Abu al-Qasim Abd Allah ibn Ali (11 November 908 – September/October 949), commonly known by his regnal name al-Mustakfi, was the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad from 944 to 946.

Al-Mustakfi was a younger son of Caliph al-Muktafi, and hence a rival to the line of Caliph al-Muqtadir that reigned in 908–944, a period during which the Abbasid Caliphate nearly collapsed, and caliphs became puppets at the hands of rival warlords. Al-Mustakfi himself was installed on the throne by Tuzun, a Turkish general who deposed and blinded the previous caliph, al-Muttaqi. In the power vacuum left after Tuzun&#x27;s death in August 945, al-Mustakfi tried to regain some of his freedom of action, initiating anti-Shi&#x27;a measures, but the same vacuum allowed the Buyids to capture Baghdad. Al-Mustakfi was forced to recognize the Buyids as legitimate rulers and awarded them regnal titles, but was soon accused of plotting against them and deposed in January (or March) 946. He spent the final years of his life in prison. His son attempted to claim the caliphate in , but failed.

==Biography==
===Early life and character===
Al-Mustakfi was born on 11 November 908, a son of Caliph al-Muktafi () and a Greek concubine, Ghusn. He is described by the chroniclers as being fond of sports and games, partial to (fermented drinks). He is said to have been sympathetic to the Shi&#x27;a, and maintained close contact with the (urban vagabonds and fighters) of Baghdad. His ties to the , and his participation in &#x27;vulgar&#x27; games was an affront to the more pious sections of society.

===Background: the decline of the Abbasid Caliphate===
By the 930s, the once mighty Abbasid Caliphate had fallen into decline: its outlying provinces lost to local dynasts, its finances in ruin, and warlords—the Hamdanids of Mosul, the Baridis of Basra, the Buyids of western Iran, as well as various military strongmen—competing for control of the very capital of the caliphate, Baghdad, and the title of (commander-in-chief), which carried with it the &quot;de facto&quot; control over the Abbasid government. At the same time, the Abbasid dynasty itself was consumed by rivalries and infighting, chiefly between the descendants of al-Muktafi on the one hand and those of his brother and successor, al-Muqtadir (), on the other. Under al-Muqtadir&#x27;s son al-Radi (), three of al-Muktafi&#x27;s sons were executed or imprisoned, while the Caliph faced challenges from two of his own brothers and other collateral lines of Abbasid princes as well.

Al-Radi&#x27;s brother, al-Muttaqi (), was raised to the throne by the Bajkam. He tried to exploit the rivalries of the regional warlords to recover the independence and authority of his office, but his attempts failed, and he was deposed and blinded by the Tuzun in September 944. For the 11th-century historian al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, this unprecedented deed signalled the final collapse of caliphal authority. In al-Muttaqi&#x27;s stead, al-Mustakfi was raised to the throne, at the age of 41.

===Al-Mustakfi&#x27;s caliphate===
Al-Mustakfi&#x27;s accession meant the restoration of the line of al-Muktafi&#x27;s line to the throne after 36 years, and from the start the new caliph made deliberate allusions to his father: the chosen regnal name deliberately echoed that of al-Muktafi, and he is said to have worn his father&#x27;s ceremonial headdress (the ) on his entry in Baghdad. This, and the quick appointment of his son, Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Muhammad, as heir-apparent, show that al-Mustakfi confidently intended to emulate his father&#x27;s successful reign, but in reality, the new caliph was a puppet of the Turkic troops, facing an empty treasury, and with the resulting chaos and poverty threatening even Baghdad with famine. The only freedom for political manoeuvre remaining to the caliphs of this period was to choose which of the neighbouring warlords to ally with. For the warlords, the caliph was a source of legitimacy, and an astute caliph might be able rotate his support among the different warlords in the same way his predecessors had previously changed their viziers.

At the same time, al-Mustakfi persecuted potential rivals, in the person of al-Fadl, the chief of the remaining sons of al-Muqtadir and brother of the two previous caliphs, al-Muttaqi and al-Radi. Al-Mustakfi and al-Fadl were said to have hated each other already during their stay in the Tahirid Palace as young princes. When al-Mustakfi was enthroned, al-Fadl prudently went into hiding, and the vengeful al-Mustakfi had his house burned down. The new regime in Baghdad was threatened from the east and south by the Buyids, who had allied themselves with the Baridis of Basra. A Buyid attempt to capture Wasit in spring 944 failed, as did a thrust on Baghdad while Tuzun was preoccupied in the north in the summer 944. In spring 945, the Buyids managed to occupy Wasit, but after Tuzun concluded peace with the Hamdanids, they were forced to retreat.

Tuzun was able to fend off various challengers to retain control of Baghdad, but he died in August 945 and was replaced by his secretary Ibn Shirzad, who did not enjoy the same authority with the troops. Ibn Shirzad&#x27;s weakness was quickly exploited by the Caliph, who assumed a new title, that of &#x27;Rightful Imam&#x27; (), to bolster his claim to Islamic leadership. He also took measures against Shi&#x27;a followers, imprisoning the Shi&#x27;a leader al-Shafi&#x27;i, and dismissed corrupt judges, including the chief , Muhammad ibn Abi al-Shawarib.

Finding himself unable to control affairs, Ibn Shirzad requested the aid of the Hamdanid Nasir al-Dawla from Mosul. Just then the governor of Wasit surrendered to the Buyid leader Ahmad ibn Buya, and joined him in his march on Baghdad. Left leaderless, the Turkic troops of the capital made no preparations to resist. Ibn Shirzad and the Caliph went into hiding, emerging only when the Turks had left the city to join the Hamdanids. When a messenger of Ahmad ibn Buya arrived at the capital, al-Mustakfi pretended to be delighted at their arrival.

===Downfall and death===
The Buyid forces entered Baghdad without opposition, and on 21 December, al-Mustakfi was forced to recognize the Buyids&#x27; authority. Ahmad was granted the honorific title of Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla (&quot;Magnifier of the Dynasty&quot;); similar titles were granted to his two brothers, Hasan (Rukn al-Dawla, &quot;Pillar of the Dynasty&quot;) and Ali (Imad al-Dawla, &quot;Prop of the Dynasty&quot;). In accordance with the family-based Buyid system, the title of passed not to Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla, but to the oldest brother, Imad al-Dawla, who was the chief Buyid emir. As al-Mustakfi was now under Buyid control, the Hamdanids promptly stopped recognizing him as caliph, and proclaimed their allegiance to the former caliph al-Muttaqi.

Al-Mustakfi himself reportedly intrigued with some of the Buyids&#x27; Daylamite officers against Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla. As a result, he was deposed on 29 January 946 (or 9 March, according to other accounts) on Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla&#x27;s orders. The reason given for al-Mustakfi&#x27;s deposition was likely a mere pretext; historian Harold Bowen called the act a &quot;political necessity&quot; that also was highly symbolic, making clear where power now resided.

Although the Buyids and their followers were Shi&#x27;a sympathizers, Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla preferred not to risk installing a Shi&#x27;a caliph (or recognizing the Isma&#x27;ili Fatimid caliphs), for fear of his men obeying the caliph rather than him. Instead, he raised al-Fadl, who emerged from hiding, to the caliphate with the name al-Muti. Lacking any real power, the new caliph was effectively a puppet ruler who granted the Buyid regime legitimacy. Following the conclusion of a peace agreement in summer 946, the Hamdanids acknowledged al-Muti as caliph, but in the east, the Samanids continued to recognize al-Mustakfi as caliph until 955.

Al-Mustakfi was also blinded, apparently as a revenge act initiated by al-Muti, and spent the rest of his life as a prisoner in the caliphal palace, where he died in September 949. Some attempts were made to reclaim the caliphate from al-Muti by members of al-Muktafi&#x27;s line, but these were unsuccessful. One of al-Mustakfi&#x27;s nephews, Abu&#x27;l-Nasr Ishaq, tried to raise a revolt in Adharbayjan in 960, taking the caliphal name al-Mustajir bi&#x27;llah (&quot;Seeking Support in God&quot;), but was defeated by the local Musafirid rulers. After the death of Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla in 967, al-Mustakfi&#x27;s son and designated heir, Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Muhammad, came to Iraq and managed to gather a considerable following by hiding his identity and claiming to be the Mahdi, but eventually he was discovered and captured. Although he managed to escape, his hopes of seizing the throne were never realized. This marked the end of the caliphal pretensions of the line of al-Mustakfi as well.

<text>Abū ʾl-Qāsim al-Faḍl ibn al-Muqtadir (; 913/14 – September/October 974), better known by his regnal name of al-Mutīʿ li-ʾllāh (), was the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad from 946 to 974, ruling under the tutelage of the Buyid emirs.

Al-Muti&#x27;s reign represented the nadir of the Abbasid caliphate&#x27;s power and authority. In previous decades, the secular authority of the caliphs had shrunk to Iraq, and even there had been curtailed by powerful warlords; with the Buyid conquest of Baghdad, it was now abolished entirely. Al-Muti&#x27; was raised to the throne by the Buyids and was effectively reduced to a rubber-stamp figurehead, albeit with some vestiges of authority over judicial and religious appointments in Iraq. The very fact of his subordination and powerlessness helped restore some stability to the caliphal institution: in stark contrast to his short-lived and violently deposed predecessors, al-Muti&#x27; enjoyed a long and relatively unchallenged tenure, and was able to hand over the throne to his son al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;.

Al-Muti&#x27;s prestige as the nominal leader of the Muslim world sharply declined during his tenure. Regional rivals to the Buyids delayed their recognition of al-Muti&#x27;s caliphate, seeing in him only a Buyid puppet, and his inability to respond effectively to Byzantine advances tarnished his reputation. More importantly, the rise of Shi&#x27;a regimes across the Middle East directly challenged Sunni and Abbasid predominance. The Buyids themselves were Shi&#x27;a, but they retained the Abbasid caliphate out of expedience. Further west, the expanding Fatimid Caliphate posed a direct ideological and political challenge to the Abbasids. During al-Muti&#x27;s reign, the Fatimids conquered Egypt and started to expand into the Levant, threatening Baghdad itself.

==Biography==
===Early life===
The future al-Muti&#x27; was born in Baghdad in 913/14 as al-Fadl, a son of the Abbasid caliph, al-Muqtadir (), and a Slavic concubine, Mash&#x27;ala. He was the brother of caliphs al-Radi () and al-Muttaqi (). Al-Muti&#x27; grew up in a time of crisis. Al-Muqtadir&#x27;s reign was marked by factional strife, attacks by the Qarmatians, economic decline and revenue shortages that led to military unrest, culminating in the murder of the caliph in 932. During the subsequent reigns of al-Radi and al-Muttaqi, the Abbasid central government lost control of the provinces to regional military strongmen. Even in the Abbasid metropolitan region of Iraq, military strongmen deprived the caliphs of real authority, and vied with one another for the title of (commander-in-chief, ) and the attendant control of the Abbasid government apparatus in Baghdad, that would allow them to pay their restive troops. Al-Muttaqi himself had been raised to the throne by the Bajkam, but attempted to play off the regional warlords—notably the Hamdanids of Mosul—to recover the independence and authority of his office. These attempts ended in failure, and resulted in his deposition and blinding by the Tuzun in September 944.

As the chief of the remaining sons of al-Muqtadir and brother of the two previous caliphs, al-Fadl was an obvious candidate for the throne. Tuzun instead chose al-Mustakfi (), a son of Caliph al-Muktafi (). The medieval sources report that al-Mustakfi and al-Fadl hated each other, and quarreled already during their stay in the Tahirid Palace as young princes. Not only were they members of two rival lines of succession, but their characters were diametrically opposed: though al-Fadl, like his father, was renowned for his piety, al-Mustakfi offended pious opinion by his association with the militia—drawn from the poorer urban classes, they were often decried as troublemakers and suspected for their association with heterodox and sectarian groups like the Sufis—and his participation in &#x27;vulgar&#x27; games. Once al-Mustakfi was enthroned, he sent his agents to capture al-Muti&#x27;, but the latter had already gone into hiding, and the caliph had to satisfy himself with demolishing his house. This futile act only served to mark al-Fadl as a serious rival; on hearing of it, the veteran vizier, Ali ibn Isa, is said to have remarked that &quot;This day he [al-Fadl] has been acknowledged heir to the throne.&quot;

===Caliphate===
====Rise to the throne====

In December 945, the Daylamite troops of the Buyid ruler Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla () seized Baghdad. Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla became the &quot;de facto&quot; &#x27;protector&#x27; of the Abbasid caliph, although the title of apparently passed to his older brother, Imad al-Dawla, who was reckoned as the chief Buyid emir. On 29 January 946 (or 9 March, according to other accounts), al-Mustakfi was deposed, and on the same day, Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla raised al-Fadl to the caliphate, with the regnal name of (). The sudden reappearance of al-Muti&#x27;, and his rise to the throne, was apparently a surprise to contemporaries, and led to stories that he had conspired with the Buyids already since the time of al-Muktafi&#x27;s accession.

Medieval sources tended to justify this change on religious grounds. The Buyids and their followers were Shi&#x27;a sympathizers, and two later chroniclers, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik al-Hamadhani (d. 1127) and Ibn al-Athir (d. 1233), report that Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla toyed with the idea of deposing the Abbasids outright and installing an Alid on the throne of Baghdad, only to be dissuaded by his secretary, Abu Ja&#x27;far al-Saymari, who pointed out that in a clash between himself and a Shi&#x27;a caliph, the Daylamite soldiery were likely to side with the latter. This is clearly a later anachronistic interpolation, and the historian John Donohue disclaims any religious motivation in al-Mustakfi&#x27;s deposition. Other chroniclers provide different reasons, such as the caliph&#x27;s intrigues with the Hamdanids, or al-Fadl&#x27;s emerging from hiding and inciting the Buyid ruler against his cousin, but the chief reason was likely simply that Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla wished to have a caliph who was under his full control with no external sources of support.

The deposed al-Mustakfi was blinded, apparently as a revenge act initiated by al-Muti&#x27;, and spent the rest of his life as a prisoner in the caliphal palace, where he died in September 949.

====Role and relations with the Buyids====
Al-Muti&#x27; was a weak figure, for all intents and purposes a puppet ruler of the Buyid ruler of Iraq, first Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla, and then his son, Izz al-Dawla (). As a result of his lack of real power, al-Muti&#x27; himself barely figures in the chronicles of his reign, and medieval historians generally considered his tenure as the lowest ebb of the Abbasid caliphate, an opinion shared by modern scholars as well.
In theory, the Buyids and all their officials in Iraq continued to act in the name of the Abbasid caliph, and all appointments and legal acts continued to be made in his name. In practice, al-Muti&#x27; was deprived of any meaningful authority. In exchange for being allowed to lead a comfortable and secure life in the vast caliphal palaces, he served to provide legitimacy to the upstart Buyid regime in the eyes of the Muslim world. The options of abolishing the caliphate or installing an Alid as caliph were quickly rejected, if they were ever seriously entertained: such an act would cause widespread opposition, another Sunni caliphate might easily be set up elsewhere, but a docile caliph under Buyid control would help maintain the obedience of the Sunni majority to the new regime, as well as lend its symbolic weight to the Buyids in their relations with the other Muslim princes. Furthermore, there was a lack of suitable Alid candidates: the last imam of the Twelver Shi&#x27;a, who represented the main strand of Shi&#x27;a followers in the Buyid domains, was held to have gone into occultation seventy years earlier, and Zaydi doctrine held that the imams had to seize power themselves if they were to be legitimate.

The Buyids quickly integrated themselves into the traditional Abbasid system and eagerly sought the legitimacy conferred by the caliph, in the form of honorific titles and diplomas of governorship, or in his signature in treaties. At the same time, al-Muti&#x27; was effectively reduced to a salaried state official, and his responsibility was curtailed to the oversight over the judiciary, religious institutions, and the affairs of the members of the wider Abbasid clan. The caliph&#x27;s chief secretary was no longer termed &#x27;vizier&#x27; (), but merely &#x27;secretary&#x27; (), and his role was limited to the management of the , a department managing the caliph&#x27;s properties, the formal conferment of titles and offices and certificates in the name of the caliph, and the appointment of judges and jurors. In reality, judicial appointments too were under the purview of the Buyid emir, but at least for the more senior ones, such as the chief of Baghdad, the caliph was expected to provide his assent, the robe of honour and the requisite diploma. With one known exception, al-Muti&#x27; generally complied with the emir&#x27;s appointments.

The Buyids kept a close watch on the caliph, especially during their periodic conflicts with the Hamdanids, lest he might try to defect to them, as al-Muttaqi had done. During the battles of summer 946, when the Hamdanids briefly occupied East Baghdad, he was kept under house arrest in a church in West Baghdad, and not released until he had sworn an oath of loyalty to the Buyids. Whenever Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla campaigned against rebels south of Baghdad, al-Muti&#x27; was forced to accompany the Buyid ruler, lest he defect north to the Hamdanids. Conversely, when the Buyid campaigned against the Hamdanids in the north, al-Muti&#x27; was left behind in Baghdad. In 948/49, Ispahdost, Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla&#x27;s brother-in-law, was arrested on suspicion of conspiring with al-Muti&#x27; (or with an unnamed Alid).
Upon taking power, Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla distributed the former caliphal crown domains for the upkeep of the army, and al-Muti&#x27; had to content himself with a daily salary of 2,000 silver dirhams. When Basra was recovered from the Baridi family shortly after, he was assigned extensive possessions there, raising his income to 200,000 gold dinars per year. Although the general decline of Iraq later reduced his income by three quarters of its original value, this allowed the caliph to financially support members of the Abbasid clan in need, and to make rich gifts to the Kaaba. The income also sufficed for the construction of a series of pavilions in the caliphal palace grounds: the Peacock Palace (), the Octagon House () and the Square House ().

The troubled relations between the caliph and the Buyids gradually assumed a more regular and tranquil character: the Buyids at least formally respected the caliph&#x27;s remaining responsibilities, and al-Muti&#x27; apparently accepted his subservient role, regained some freedom of action, and maintained cordial relations with Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla. In 955/56, Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla even appointed his 13-year-old son, the future Izz al-Dawla, as the caliph&#x27;s chamberlain. The most notable exception to the good relationship between the caliph and the was the latter&#x27;s attempt to rent out the appointment of chief of Baghdad to Abdallah ibn Abi al-Shawarib for 200,000 dirhams per year between 961 and 963. This was opposed by both Sunni and Shi&#x27;a scholars as illegal, and al-Muti&#x27; refused to sign the appointments made by Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla during this period. This is also almost the only reference in the sources to al-Muti&#x27;s activity in the religious or judicial sphere; otherwise his reign is passed over in silence.

A positive corollary of this subservience was stability. Although of a sickly disposition, al-Muti&#x27; reigned as caliph for 29 Hijri years and four months, in stark contrast to his short-lived predecessors, and unlike them had to contend with remarkably few rival pretenders to the caliphate. A grandson of al-Muktafi rebelled in Armenia in 960 and claimed the caliphate as al-Mustajir Billah before being defeated by the local Sallarid rulers. In 968, Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Muhammad, a son of al-Mustakfi, who had fled to the Ikhshidid court in Egypt, gained considerable support in Iraq by hiding his identity and posing as the Mahdi (the Islamic messiah). The leading convert to his cause was a Buyid commander, the Turk Sübüktegin al-Ajami, who gave him protection and was preparing to mount a coup in his name, before his identity was uncovered and he was handed over to al-Muti&#x27;. The caliph did not severely punish him, other than ordering his nose cut off, thereby disqualifying him from the succession; although Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Muhammad eventually managed to escape, his hopes of seizing the throne were never realized, and the caliphal succession henceforth firmly remained with the line of al-Muqtadir.

====Facing the Shi&#x27;a and Byzantine challenges====

Outside the Buyid domains, on the other hand, the Abbasid caliph&#x27;s authority over the wider Muslim world declined. Until the conclusion of a peace with the Buyids in 955, the Samanids of Khurasan refused to acknowledge his caliphate, and, in the west, the rival Isma&#x27;ili Shi&#x27;a Fatimid Caliphate was growing more and more powerful, conquering Egypt in 969 and beginning its expansion into the Levant. Even in Baghdad, the pro-Shi&#x27;a sympathies of the Buyids meant that Shi&#x27;a influence, although numerically small, was growing. Shi&#x27;a practices were introduced in the city, such as the ritual condemnation of the Umayyad caliph Mu&#x27;awiya, or the celebration of the Ghadir Khumm festival, attested since 963. Alids assumed the leadership of the annual Hajj caravans, and street clashes between Sunni and Shi&#x27;a partisans are recorded in several years during this period.

At the same time, al-Muti&#x27; played a leading role as a mediator in the formation of an anti-Fatimid coalition that included the Qarmatians under al-Hasan al-A&#x27;sam and the Hamdanid ruler of Mosul, Abu Taghlib, with the backing of the Buyids. This coalition managed to stop the Fatimid expansion into the Levant until 973/74. In the process, the Qarmatians recognized al-Muti&#x27;s suzerainty in the (Friday sermon) and their coins, and denounced the Fatimids as impostors. In 951, when the Qarmatians returned the Black Stone to the Kaaba in Mecca, whence they had taken it in 930, al-Muti&#x27; is rumoured to have paid them 30,000 gold dinars as the Stone&#x27;s ransom.

Another source of danger was the Byzantine advance against the Hamdanids in Upper Mesopotamia and northern Syria. In the 960s the Byzantines broke the centuries-old border at the Taurus Mountains and seized Cilicia and Antioch, reducing the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo to a tributary vassal in the process. In 972, the Byzantine raids reached Nisibis, Amida, and Edessa. Muslim refugees from these cities flooded to Baghdad and clamoured for protection. Unwilling and unable to help, Izz al-Dawla pointed them to al-Muti&#x27;, since the jihad was still formally the caliph&#x27;s responsibility. Bereft of any military or financial resources, al-Muti&#x27; was powerless to help them, and his prestige suffered accordingly; the riots engulfed the Shi&#x27;a quarter of Karkh, which went up in flames. Izz al-Dawla used the opportunity to pressure al-Muti&#x27; into selling off his valuables and providing 400,000 dirhams, ostensibly to be used to employ soldiers against the Byzantines. Al-Muti&#x27; protested in a much-quoted letter, but had no option but to comply; the money was soon squandered by the profligate Buyid ruler. This act proved to be a costly political mistake for Izz al-Dawla, further alienating Sunni sympathies in Baghdad, where his control grew even more tenuous.

====Abdication and death====
Over the years, Izz al-Dawla increasingly alienated his Turkic soldiery, under their commander Sabuktakin, culminating in a failed assassination attempt on the latter. The Turks had also gained the support of the Sunni populace in Baghdad after putting down the riots in 972. As a result, on 1 August 974, Sabuktakin seized control of Baghdad from Izz al-Dawla.

When the coup happened, al-Muti&#x27; left Baghdad along with the members of the Buyid clan, but Sabuktakin forced him back and confined him to his palace. Of advanced years, and with his right side paralyzed following a stroke in 970, al-Muti&#x27; was induced to abdicate with his health as a pretext, and was replaced by his son Abd al-Karim, as al-Ta&#x27;i (), on 5 August. This was the first father-to-son succession of the caliphate since al-Muktafi in 902.

Sabuktakin had himself appointed by the new caliph, and left Baghdad to campaign against the Buyids, accompanied by both al-Muti&#x27; and al-Ta&#x27;i. Al-Muti&#x27; died on the way, at Dayr al-Aqul, on 12 October 974. He was buried at the mausoleum of his paternal grandmother, Shaghab, in the Baghdad quarter of al-Rusafa, where his brother al-Radi had also been buried.

<text>Abu Bakr ʿAbd al-Karīm ibn al-Faḍl (; 932 – 3 August 1003), better known by his regnal name al-Ṭāʾiʿ liʾllāh/biʾllāh (), was the Abbasid caliph of Baghdad from 974 to his deposition in 991. He was in office during the domination of Iraq by the Shi&#x27;a Buyid dynasty, and as a result is generally considered a powerless figurehead under the thumb of the Buyid emirs. His tenure was also marked by strife between rival Buyid rulers and the frequent change of hands of Baghdad: al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; himself was raised to the throne by a rebel Turkic general, Sabuktakin, who deposed al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;s father, al-Muti&#x27;. During periods of such strife, al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; was able to exert some measure of political independence, but under stronger rulers he was sidelined, and was obliged to marry the daughters of the emirs Izz al-Dawla and Adud al-Dawla. Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;s status suffered under Adud al-Dawla in particular, who turned to pre-Islamic Persian models for legitimacy, and relegated Iraq to the status of a simple province ruled from Fars. Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; was deposed on 22 November 991 by Baha al-Dawla, and replaced with his cousin, al-Qadir. He spent the rest of his days, until his death in 1003, confined to the caliphal palace.

==Origin and early life==
Abd al-Karim, the future al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;, was born in Baghdad in 929 as the son of the Abbasid prince al-Fadl, son of Caliph al-Muqtadir, and a concubine of Greek origin, called Utb. As an adult, al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;s face was marked by smallpox, and he had a prominent nose, which became the object of satire by contemporaries.

His father came to the throne as caliph al-Muti&#x27; in 946, following the capture of Baghdad by the Buyid dynasty. While themselves espousing Shi&#x27;a beliefs, the Buyids nevertheless decided to retain the Abbasid caliphs out of expediency, and to provide them legitimacy in the eyes of the other Muslim rulers. In practice, however, al-Muti&#x27; was a puppet of the ruling Buyid emir of Iraq. A positive corollary of this subservience was that it brought stability to the caliphal throne: al-Muti&#x27; reigned as caliph for 29 Hijri years and four months, in stark contrast to his short-lived predecessors, and unlike them had to contend with remarkably few rival pretenders to the caliphate.

==Caliphate==
===Rise to the throne===
On 1 August 974, the Turkic general Sabuktakin seized control of Baghdad from the Buyid ruler Izz al-Dawla. When the coup happened, al-Muti&#x27; left Baghdad along with the expelled members of the Buyid clan, but Sabuktakin forced him back and confined him to his palace. Al-Muti&#x27; was induced to abdicate with his health as a pretext, and was replaced by his oldest son, Abu Bakr Abd al-Karim, as Caliph al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; li&#x27;llah on 5 August 974 (13 Dhu&#x27;l-Qa&#x27;dah 363 AH). This was the first father-to-son succession of the caliphate since al-Muktafi in 902.

Like his father, al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; is considered by medieval and modern historians alike to have been a powerless figurehead, limited to appending his name to certificates of appointment and official correspondence, with others holding the real power. He played no role even in the numerous religious controversies of his day, and little is known about his activities other than his often conducting the Friday prayer at the Kadhimayn mosque, and his rebuilding the , one of the principal gates to the caliphal palace complex. The historian Heribert Busse however points out that al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; managed to maintain his office for sixteen years in a very turbulent time, involving no fewer than six regime changes in Baghdad, and credits him with political acumen and flexibility.

The new caliph promptly named Sabuktakin as the chief emir (), with the honorific title . Before long, Sabuktakin, accompanied by al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; and al-Muti&#x27;, marched on Wasit, where the Buyid forces under Izz al-Dawla and his cousin, Adud al-Dawla, the ruler of Fars, gathered. Sabuktakin died on the way, and was succeeded by another Turkic , Alptakin. The Turks were defeated in January 975 near the Diyala River, and withdrew north to Tikrit, before they fled to Syria, while the Buyids entered Baghdad. Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;s position under the Turks is unclear. He sent letters to Izz al-Dawla berating him of his errors and omissions as governor, but in later public letters he cursed them and claimed that he had been using dissimulation () in apparently siding with them. Thus, historian John Donohue writes of the &quot;brief six months of independence that the caliphate enjoyed under the Turk rebels&quot;, while Heribert Busse writes of the caliph as being virtually the prisoner of the Turks.

At any rate, al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; was soon able to recover his position at least somewhat, making use of the Buyids&#x27; quarrels and their need for legitimacy: in Baghdad, Adud al-Dawla deposed his cousin and assumed rule of the city. Leaving Tikrit, al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; returned to Baghdad, where Adud al-Dawla received him with respect and restored to him his domains, that had apparently been confiscated (it is unclear by whom, likely by Izz al-Dawla). There are indications that he consulted with al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; for a formal investment as emir, and his name was included in the Friday prayer before that of Izz al-Dawla. In the event, Adud al-Dawla bowed to pressure by his father, the senior Buyid emir Rukn al-Dawla, to withdraw and allow Iraq to remain a separate emirate under Izz al-Dawla.

===Under Izz al-Dawla===

Following Adud al-Dawla&#x27;s departure, Izz al-Dawla tried to consolidate his regime and gather allies against his cousin&#x27;s hegemonic ambitions. This effort was also in al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;s interests, and included the awarding by the caliph of several honorific titles with the suffix to regional potentates, as well as Izz al-Dawla&#x27;s vizier, Ibn Baqiyya.

When Rukn al-Dawla died in September 976, Adud al-Dawla seized control of the eastern half of the Buyid realm, while Izz al-Dawla in Iraq made himself &quot;de facto&quot; independent. Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; seized the opportunity to deepen the rift between the two cousins by conceding to the ambitious Izz al-Dawla high privileges that made him the co-equal of Adud al-Dawla: Ibn Baqiyya was named joint vizier of Izz al-Dawla and the caliph, Izz al-Dawla&#x27;s titles were extended, and finally, the caliph himself married a daughter of the Buyid emir. Offended and challenged in his authority as successor of Rukn al-Dawla, Adud al-Dawla moved against his cousin. After a suitable delay likely meant to demonstrate his independence, al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; joined Izz al-Dawla at his camp at Khuzistan, and sent a letter proposing peace to Adud al-Dawla. When this was rejected and Adud al-Dawla marched on his cousin, in a symbolic assertion of his independence, the caliph left the camp and returned to Baghdad. Adud al-Dawla defeated Izz al-Dawla in July 977, entering Baghdad on 23 December.

===Under Adud al-Dawla===
In a formal ceremony, Adud al-Dawla was invested as by al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;, with extensive new honours: he was awarded a crown and jewel-studded necklace, given the honorific (&#x27;Crown of the Muslim Community&#x27;), as well as a banner for himself and his heir, something hitherto reserved for the designated heirs of the caliphs. Adud al-Dawla also requested two special privileges: allowing him to enter the caliphal audience chamber on horseback, and the erection of a curtain so that when he prostrated himself in front of the caliph, this gesture of submission would not be seen by his companions. The caliph pointedly refused these demands, and even had a barrier built in front of the audience chamber, so that the Buyid ruler had no choice but dismount and enter on foot. Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; did, however, agree to the addition of some details to the ceremony that hearkened back to ancient Persian protocol, and that made it appear to the Buyid&#x27;s companions as if Adud al-Dawla had been crowned king by the caliph. It is unclear whether al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; was aware of the significance of these changes. Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; also agreed to accompany Adud al-Dawla in his campaign that defeated the remnants of Izz al-Dawla&#x27;s forces at Samarra in May 978, whereupon he returned to Baghdad.

As the coronation episode reveals, Adud al-Dawla, and the Buyids generally, relied increasingly on pre-Islamic Persian traditions, ceremonies, and titles to bolster their position and claim an independent source of legitimacy. According to C. E. Bosworth, the Buyid ruler aimed at &quot;a division of power between the caliphate and the monarchy, equivalent to the mediaeval European theories of church and empire&quot;, a conception entirely alien to al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;s worldview. Perhaps obliged to acquiesce to caliphal slights in order to secure recognition of his rule over Iraq, Adud al-Dawla initially treated al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; with deference, restoring him all his privileges and paying for the renovation of the caliphal palace.

As soon as Izz al-Dawla and his Hamdanid allies in Upper Mesopotamia were defeated though, Adud al-Dawla launched a purge against the caliph&#x27;s immediate environment, imprisoning the vizier Ibrahim al-Sabi, the chief Ibn Ma&#x27;ruf, and other senior members of the Baghdad court. The dismissal of Ibn Ma&#x27;ruf in particular was a violation of the main remaining prerogative of the caliph under Buyid rule, namely the appointment of the chief of Baghdad and Iraq. The posts of both the vizier and the chief of Iraq were left vacant, and substituted by those for the Buyid capital province of Fars. Iraq was thus effectively reduced to a regular province of the Buyid empire, governed from a new imperial centre. Adud al-Dawla even usurped the last remaining, symbolic aspects of the caliph&#x27;s office, namely the nomination of officials and governors in his name.

When Adud al-Dawla returned to Baghdad in 980, following his eastern campaigns, al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; in person led the Buyid emir into the city; an unprecedented event, but, as Bosworth comments, &quot;once again the caliph seems to have failed to appreciate the significance of the ceremony in which he was taking part&quot;. In a further move to bind the caliph closer to himself, in the second half of 980, Adud al-Dawla arranged for the marriage of one of his daughters with al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;. If Adud al-Dawla may have hoped, as the contemporary historian Miskawayh has it, that the offspring of this union would one day unite the Abbasid caliphate with the Buyid kingship, it was not to be. Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; saw this marriage at worst as forced upon him, and at best as a token of distinction and condescension towards the Buyid emir, and resolutely refused to consummate it. This led to the final breach between al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; and Adud al-Dawla, who introduced the provocative, Persian-derived and entirely un-Islamic title of (&#x27;King of Kings&#x27;) into his coinage even in Iraq.

===Under Adud al-Dawla&#x27;s successors===
Adud al-Dawla died on 26 March 983 at the age of 49, leaving behind a large but unconsolidated empire, and an unregulated succession. Initially, the Buyid commanders gave the oath of allegiance to Adud al-Dawla&#x27;s second son, Marzuban, under the name of Samsam al-Dawla. Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; recognized the succession, investing Samsam al-Dawla with the title of Shams al-Milla. Adud al-Dawla&#x27;s oldest son, Shirdil, known as Sharaf al-Dawla, refused to accept this and seized Fars, thus limiting Samsam al-Dawla to Iraq, but even there the latter faced challengers: Upper Mesopotamia was lost to the Kurd Badh, while two younger sons of Adud al-Dawla held Khuzistan and Basra. In the eastern territories of the Buyid empire, at the same time, their uncle Fakhr al-Dawla laid claim to Adud al-Dawla&#x27;s succession, claiming the tile of for himself.

The Buyid quarrels offered opportunities for al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;: the officials ousted by Adud al-Dawla were reinstated, and the danger of Iraq&#x27;s permanent relegation to a province ruled from elsewhere was ended for now, as it once again became a separate political unit under one of the Buyid emirs. Samsam al-Dawla reverted, at least formally, to making all appointments &#x27;on the command of the Commander of the Faithful&#x27;, and the disunity of the Buyids would allow the caliph to play a political role as arbiter between the quarreling emirs. In , he granted a subsidy to the Samanids towards the protection of the frontiers of Islam, and mediated a peace agreement between Samsam al-Dawla and Sharaf al-Dawla, after the latter occupied Khuzistan and Basra. In the treaty, concluded in June 986, Sharaf al-Dawla was recognized as the chief emir, and his name included in the Friday prayers in Baghdad. Both parties explicitly placed themselves under the caliph&#x27;s formal authority. In the event, Sharaf al-Dawla quickly reneged on the agreement: using clashes between Daylamites and Turks in Baghdad as a pretext, he marched on the city, captured and imprisoned his brother in January 987, and was invested by the caliph as chief emir in May 987.

Sharaf al-Dawla&#x27;s ascendancy was brief, as he died at Baghdad on 7 September 988. As his two sons were underage, he was succeeded by his younger brother Abu Nasr Firuz, with the regnal name of Baha al-Dawla. Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; recognized the succession, and invested Baha al-Dawla with the title of Diya al-Milla. Baha al-Dawla was quickly attacked by Fakhr al-Dawla, but the two Buyid emirs quickly came to terms—again with the caliph as arbiter—recognizing each other as rulers over their respective realms.

==Deposition and succession==
Bereft of money with which to pay his army, the Buyid emir followed the advice of the powerful head of the chancery, Abu&#x27;l-Hasan ibn al-Mu&#x27;allim, to depose al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; in order to seize the caliphal treasury. On 22 November 991 (12 Ramadan 381 AH), under the pretext of an audience, Baha al-Dawla&#x27;s men seized the caliph. While the caliphal palace was plundered, the caliph was wrapped in a robe and brought to the emir&#x27;s residence, where he was placed under arrest. He was succeeded by his cousin Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Ahmad, who took the throne as al-Qadir.

Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; had had strained relations with his cousin: in 988, the latter&#x27;s half-sister, apparently motivated by an inheritance dispute, reported him as seeking to replace al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; as caliph. To escape capture, Ahmad went into hiding for a while, before seeking refuge with the governor of the swamps of Bathihah near Basra, Muhadhdhib al-Dawla, for about three years. From there, Ahmad plotted against al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;, harping on his own loyalty to the Buyids, and drawing contrast to the fact that al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; had been installed by a Turk.

Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; remained under arrest until September 992, when he was allowed to move to the caliphal palace. Despite their previous differences, al-Qadir treated him well. Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; was not blinded, as had been the case for previous deposed caliphs, and he was accorded treatment due to a reigning caliph. Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27; died at the palace on 3 August 1003, and was buried in Rusafa, at a mausoleum he had erected across from the tombs of his father, al-Muti&#x27;, and of his great-grandmother, the mother of al-Muqtadir, Shaghab.

Al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;s deposition had a long denouement: considering al-Qadir a puppet of the Buyids, the eastern dynasties of the Samanids and Ghaznavids refused to recognize the succession until 999/1000, continuing to use al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;s name in the Friday prayer and on coins until then. Furthermore, a relative of the deposed caliph, Abdallah ibn Ja&#x27;far, managed to escape custody in Baghdad and fled to Gilan, where he persuaded the local ruler that he was indeed al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;. Only after Baghdad found out about this pretender was his true identity revealed.

<text>Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Ahmad ibn Ishaq (; 28 September 947 – 29 November 1031), better known by his regnal name al-Qadir (, , ), was the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad from 991 to 1031.

Born as an Abbasid prince outside the main line of succession, al-Qadir received a good education, including in the tenets of the Shafi&#x27;i school of Islamic jurisprudence. He rose to the throne after his cousin, at-Ta&#x27;i, was deposed by the Buyid ruler of Iraq, Baha al-Dawla. Although still under Buyid tutelage and with limited real power even in Baghdad, al-Qadir was able to gradually increase the authority of his office over time, exploiting the rivalries of the Buyid emirs and the caliphate&#x27;s role as a fount of legitimacy and religious guidance. Al-Qadir was able to nominate his own heirs without interference by the Buyids, and was instrumental in securing control of Baghdad for the Buyid emir Jalal al-Dawla. At the same time, he sought champions further afield, notably in the person of Mahmud of Ghazni, who sought caliphal recognition for his conquests, providing funds in return. In the religious sphere, al-Qadir placed himself as the champion of Sunni Islam against Shi&#x27;a Islam, represented by the Buyids as well as by the Fatimid Caliphate of Cairo. He denounced the Fatimids in the Baghdad Manifesto of 1011, and issued proclamations that for the first time codified Sunni doctrine in the so-called &#x27;Qadiri Creed&#x27;, taking the side of the traditionalist Hanbali school against the rationalist Mu&#x27;tazilites. Al-Qadir&#x27;s religious policies cemented the Sunni–Shi&#x27;a split, as the followers of divergent doctrines were denounced as infidels and made licit to be killed as a result. His reign heralded the re-emergence of the Abbasid caliphate as an independent political actor, and presaged the so-called &#x27;Sunni Revival&#x27; later in the century.

==Early life==
Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Ahmad, the future al-Qadir, was born on 28 September 947 in Baghdad. His father Ishaq was a son of caliph al-Muqtadir (), and his mother Tammani or Dimna was a slave concubine.

Shortly before his birth, in December 945, Baghdad and the rest of Iraq had been taken over by the Buyids. Although the Buyids were pro-Shi&#x27;a, they had retained the Abbasid caliphate for reasons of legitimacy. The Buyids ruled Iraq ostensibly as caliphal commander-in-chiefs (), but in practice they had reduced the Abbasid caliphs to puppet rulers, confined to their palaces. Like many Abbasid princes of the time, Ahmad lived in the Tahirid Palace of Baghdad.

As an Abbasid prince, Ahmad received a good education. When his father Ishaq died in March 988, Ahmad quarreled with his half-sister, Amina, over the inheritance. She reported him to their cousin, Caliph al-Ta&#x27;i (), as plotting to replace him as caliph. To escape capture, Ahmad went into hiding for a while, before seeking refuge with the governor of the swamps of Bathihah near Basra, Muhadhdhib al-Dawla, for about three years. From there, Ahmad plotted against al-Ta&#x27;i, harping on his own loyalty to the Buyids, whereas al-Ta&#x27;i had been installed by a Turkic general, Sabuktakin.

==Caliphate==

In 991, the Buyid ruler of Iraq, Baha al-Dawla (), deposed al-Ta&#x27;i, because the latter had been showing signs of independence. In his stead, Baha al-Dawla appointed al-Qadir to the caliphate on 22 November 991 (12 Ramadan 381 AH). The deposed al-Ta&#x27;i was kept in captivity until his death twelve years later. Despite their previous differences, al-Qadir treated his predecessor well: al-Ta&#x27;i was not blinded, as had been the case for previous deposed caliphs, and he was accorded the treatment due to a reigning caliph.

===Early years===
The accession of the new caliph was not without its troubles: on his way from Bathihah he was held up by Turkic soldiery who extracted promises of a donative payment, and the first solemn Friday sermon () in his name was likewise delayed by Turkic and Daylamite troops clamouring for money. At 45 years, al-Qadir was the oldest Abbasid caliph to ascend the throne; and it was expected that he would be a pliant figurehead. At first, al-Qadir indeed seemed to bear out this image, approving Baha al-Dawla&#x27;s nominations of officials and supporting his policies. New titles were conferred on Baha al-Dawla, and al-Qadir even agreed to marry the Buyid&#x27;s daughter, although in the event she died just before the wedding was to take place. Seeing him as a Buyid puppet, the dynasts of the eastern Islamic world delayed recognition, and it was not until 1000 that the Samanids and Ghaznavids recognized al-Qadir&#x27;s caliphate. Even the Buyid emir Fakhr al-Dawla, who ruled large parts of central and northern Iran until his death in 997, refused to recognize al-Qadir, continuing to mint coins in al-Ta&#x27;i&#x27;s name. The only independent actions taken during the first decade of his caliphate were the completion in 993/4 of a Friday mosque in the Harbiyya quarter of Baghdad, begun by his uncle al-Muti&#x27; (), and the public proclamation of his son Muhammad, then just eight or nine years old, as heir apparent, with the title of al-Ghalib Bi&#x27;llah, in 1001.

Al-Qadir faced two usurpation attempts during this time. About 998, a certain Abdallah ibn Ja&#x27;far, a close relative of the deposed al-Ta&#x27;i, pretended to be the escaped caliph in Gilan and even gained the backing of the local ruler for a time, before he was discovered. At about the same time, in Transoxiana, another distant cousin, Abdallah ibn Uthman, a descendant of the 9th-century caliph al-Wathiq, pretended to be al-Qadir&#x27;s designated heir and won the support of the local Karakhanid ruler. Al-Qadir used the event as an excuse to publicly proclaim his son as heir, bypassing the need to seek Buyid approval. The Karakhanids soon recognized the Abbasid caliph&#x27;s suzerainty for the first time, and dropped their support of the pretender. The pretender then arrived in Baghdad, where he secretly gathered support, before moving again to the east via Basra, Kufa, and Kirman. He was finally arrested by the Ghaznavids on al-Qadir&#x27;s orders, and died in captivity.

===Relations with the Buyids===
Ambitious to subdue the Buyid emirates to the east under his own rule, Baha al-Dawla forced al-Qadir to finance the military preparations to that effect, which progressively emptied the caliphal coffers. Nevertheless, Baha al-Dawla&#x27;s successes also had positive corollary: following his conquest of western Iran in 998, the Buyid moved his residence to Shiraz. This effectively downgraded Baghdad and Iraq to a mere province, but also left al-Qadir more room for independent activity, which he used to strengthen his authority. While Baha al-Dawla had previously imposed his own candidates even as members of the caliphal court, al-Qadir was now able to establish his own chancery and nominate his own officials, often from among officials who had served under al-Ta&#x27;i. Al-Qadir is also recorded as having a separate postal and information service, which he may have (re-)established. The appointment of a vizier on the other hand had to wait the next reign; al-Qadir&#x27;s chief ministers had to content themselves with the title of &#x27;secretary&#x27; (). For most of al-Qadir&#x27;s caliphate, this post was held by al-Hajib al-Nu&#x27;man, who served from 992 until his death in 1030, with a brief interruption in 998.

Baha al-Dawla died in 1012, and was succeeded by his son, Sultan al-Dawla (). The succession did nothing to halt the decline of the Buyid power in Iraq, or the mounting Sunni–Shi&#x27;a tensions. The Buyid emirs that followed Baha al-Dawla were also increasingly engaged in an unrestrained competition for supremacy amongst themselves, in which control of Baghdad and of the caliph, who could dispense titles and tokens of legitimacy, was of central importance. This in turn gave al-Qadir greater freedom of action, and placed him on much better and more equal footing with Baha al-Dawla&#x27;s successors, who were careful to maintain good relations with the caliph. Sultan al-Dawla did not come to Iraq for his investiture ceremony as , which was carried out in absentia. In contrast to previous occasions, the gifts sent to the caliphal court were modest, while the poverty of al-Qadir had reached such extent that the palace had to be decorated for the occasion with rugs and drapes provided by the governor of Baghdad.

In 1021, Sultan al-Dawla ceded rule over Iraq to his younger brother, Musharrif al-Dawla (). The latter came to Baghdad in March 1023, and ordered al-Qadir to come to him. Al-Qadir complied, but when Musharrif al-Dawla went on to renew the oath of allegiance of the Turkic military officers without asking for the Caliph&#x27;s permission, al-Qadir protested, and in return secured a pledge of fidelity from Musharrif al-Dawla. When the latter died in 1025, Musharrif al-Dawla&#x27;s brother Jalal al-Dawla () and his nephew, Abu Kalijar, clashed over his inheritance. The latter was proclaimed as by the soldiery, and initially recognized as such by the Caliph, but he was toppled when the troops eventually defected to Jalal al-Dawla. The caliph played a central role in these events, mediating with the Turkic soldiery in favour of Jalal al-Dawla, so that, according to the historian Heribert Busse, &quot;the installation of Jalal al-Dawla was the achievement of al-Qadir&quot;. Jalal al-Dawla entered Baghdad in 1026 and began curtailing the caliph&#x27;s powers, but his rule was short-lived, as once again the troops turned against him. Al-Qadir sent a delegation to inform him that he must leave the capital, and prohibited him from returning for several years.
Al-Qadir&#x27;s efforts to re-establish his authority against the Buyids were aided by the broad popular support he could count on among the Sunni population of Baghdad, the decline of Buyid power, and the emergence of Mahmud of Ghazni () in the east, who was not only a political opponent of the Buyids, but also a champion of Sunni orthodoxy. The recognition of Mahmud by al-Qadir took place independently of the Buyids, while conversely Mahmud&#x27;s recognition of his suzerainty was a boost to the caliph&#x27;s position. The Ghaznavid ruler regularly kept al-Qadir informed of his campaigns, requesting caliphal confirmation for his rule over the countries he had conquered. Al-Qadir had reports of Mahmud&#x27;s victories read publicly in the mosques, a gesture that historian Tayeb El-Hibri describes as a barely veiled gibe against the Buyids, and in turn rewarded Mahmud with lofty titles, (&#x27;friend of the commander of the faithful&#x27;) and (&#x27;right hand of the state and trustee of the community&#x27;). As the historian Michael Brett explains, this arrangement suited both men: for al-Qadir, nominating a powerful prince as his surrogate was a substitute for real power; while for Mahmud, caliphal recognition legitimized his position and his plans for conquests against diverse &#x27;infidels&#x27;, primarily India to the south, but also the Buyids to the west. Mahmud&#x27;s lavish gifts also helped alleviate somewhat the poverty of the caliph as a result of Buyid exactions; nevertheless, at his death, al-Qadir left an empty treasury.

===Championing of Sunnism===
Although al-Qadir held no temporal political power, he nevertheless managed to exploit the opportunities he was presented with to greatly restore the moral and religious authority of the caliphate. In this, he made good use of his own education in Islamic jurisprudence (), which gave him an authority to speak as a member of the emerging class of religious scholars (). The Abbasids had traditionally been followers of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence, but this association was broken in the Buyid period, in favour of the Shafi&#x27;i school. The Shafi&#x27;is were supported by the Buyids, in large part due to the convergence between Shafi&#x27;i and Shi&#x27;a doctrines. As a young prince, al-Qadir was thus taught by the Shafi&#x27;i scholar Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Harawi, and his credentials in were enough for the 14th-century Shafi&#x27;i scholar Taqi al-Din al-Subki to count among the prominent scholars belonging to his school. As caliph, however, al-Qadir was to hew closer to the doctrines of the conservative traditionalist Hanbali school.

The first major clash with the Buyids over religious issues came with the appointment by Baha al-Dawla of the prominent pro-Shi&#x27;a Alid and dean of the Alids (), Abu Ahmad al-Husayn ibn Musa, as the chief (judge) at Baghdad in 1003/4. Seeing in this an attempt to impose Twelver jurisprudence against Sunni practices, al-Qadir put himself at the head of a popular Sunni reaction, and succeeded in reverting the nomination. From this point on, the caliph identified himself with a broad Sunni backlash against the Shi&#x27;a, both of the Twelver variant espoused by the Buyids, as well as the Isma&#x27;ili branch that was led by the rival Fatimid Caliphate. In this cause he succeeded in restoring the Sunni and Abbasid form of the in Yamamah and Bahrayn. In 1006, a violent controversy broke out over a recension () of the Quran claimed to have belonged to Ibn Mas&#x27;ud, which was espoused by Shi&#x27;a scholars against the canonical version, but firmly rejected by the Sunnis. Al-Qadir summoned a commission of scholars that condemned the recension in April 1006, and ordered the execution of a Shi&#x27;a partisan who anathematized those who burned it. It was only the intervention of Baha al-Dawla that calmed matters and prevented the disorders from spreading. To further lend authority to the canonical version of the Quran, in 1010 al-Qadir assisted at public readings from it during the Friday prayers, wearing the Mantle of Muhammad.

The affair had also highlighted another threat, namely the inroads of Fatimid propaganda in Baghdad, where the name of the Fatimid caliph, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah () was hailed during the riots over Ibn Mas&#x27;ud&#x27;s recension. This was a development that threatened the Sunni Abbasids and the Twelver Buyids alike. The Fatimid threat became especially apparent in August 1010, when Qirwash ibn al-Muqallad, the Uqaylid emir of Upper Mesopotamia, whose power stretched to the outskirts of Baghdad, recognized the suzerainty of the Fatimid caliph. Al-Qadir responded by sending an embassy to Baha al-Dawla that succeeded in getting the Buyid ruler to apply pressure on the Uqaylid emir, who soon returned to Abbasid allegiance. The Emirs of Mecca also recognized Fatimid suzerainty, and for many years, Hajj pilgrims from Iraq were unable to visit the city as the security of their passage could not be guaranteed. Al-Qadir tried to secure the protection of the pilgrim caravans from being attacked and extorted by Bedouin tribes by giving rule over the Yamamah in central Arabia to the Bedouin chieftain Usayfir, but this had little success. Throughout the period, the safe passage of the caravans had to be purchased, often with donations provided by Islamic princes such as Mahmud of Ghazni for the purpose. Al-Qadir also tried to make the Emir of Mecca, Abu&#x27;l-Futuh, abandon the Fatimids and return to Abbasid allegiance, but without success.

As a further reaction against the Fatimids, in November 1011 al-Qadir issued the Baghdad Manifesto, signed by both Sunni and Twelver scholars. The document not only condemned the Fatimid Isma&#x27;ili doctrine as false, but denounced the Fatimid dynasty&#x27;s claims to descent from Ali as fraudulent, and their followers as enemies of Islam. Singling out the Fatimids as the first target of his active involvement in public affairs was a clever move, as the Buyids not only tolerated it but regarded it as useful for their own purposes, and an attack on the rival Shi&#x27;a sect gathered support even from Twelver notables. This also left room for the Twelvers to reach an accommodation with the Abbasid caliphate; stories circulated that Ali himself, the fourth caliph and first Shi&#x27;a imam, had appeared in a dream prophesying his ascent to the throne. Twelver Alids continued to play an important role in Baghdad and Iraqi politics of the time, most prominently the brothers al-Sharif al-Radi and al-Sharif al-Murtada, sons of Abu Ahmad al-Husayn, who maintained close relations with the caliphal court and succeeded their father as .

Al-Qadir&#x27;s next target was the rationalist Mu&#x27;tazilite school, which had enjoyed the protection of the Buyids and whose members had often held the post of chief in Baghdad under Buyid rule. Mu&#x27;tazilism had in the past been supported by Abbasid caliphs, most notably al-Ma&#x27;mun (), who even instituted the Inquisition-like to persecute the traditionalists who refused to accept the Mu&#x27;tazilite doctrine of Quranic createdness. In the event, the persecution not only failed, but backfired: the was suspended, and the traditionalist Hanbali school emerged with its prestige strengthened and its doctrines more influential than before. In 1017, al-Qadir unequivocally sided with his predecessors&#x27; opponents: he condemned Mu&#x27;tazilite as well as Shi&#x27;a doctrines, prohibited the teaching of Mu&#x27;tazilite doctrines or theological debate (), and ordered those Hanafi jurists who had shown Mu&#x27;tazilite tendencies to do penance, on pain of corporal punishment and exile. Shortly after, on 27 January 1019, inspired by Hanbali ideas, the caliph issued a decree, the (&#x27;Epistle of al-Qadir&#x27;), which for the first time explicitly formulated Sunni doctrine. The decree condemned Shi&#x27;a, Mu&#x27;tazilite, and even Ash&#x27;arite doctrines, and affirmed the veneration of the first four caliphs (the &#x27;Rashidun&#x27;) and of the Companions of Muhammad, as an obligation for all Muslims, against Shi&#x27;a beliefs that the first three caliphs had been illegitimate, as they had deprived Ali (the fourth caliph) of his rightful inheritance. All speculative theological debate was prohibited, along with the denigration of any of the Companions or even examination of the disputes in which they had been involved, and which had given rise to the first schisms in Islam. Quranic createdness was again singled out as heresy, its supporters branded as infidels &quot;whose blood may legitimately be shed&quot;.

In 1029, al-Qadir reiterated and reinforced his theological doctrines; In three sessions on 2 September, 2 October, and 11 November, each more lengthy and elaborate than the previous one and held before an assembly of Alids, jurists, and other notables, the caliph once again denounced Mu&#x27;tazilism, condemned the doctrine of Quranic createdness, and reaffirmed the special status of the Rashidun caliphs and the need of &quot;enjoining good and forbidding wrong&quot;. This coincided with the campaigns of Mahmud of Ghazni against the Shi&#x27;a, the Buyids (Ray was captured in 1029 and Kirman attacked two years later), and the Ghaznavid expansion into India, but also with the presence of Jalal al-Dawla on the Buyid throne, who was dependent on the caliph&#x27;s goodwill. Thus al-Qadir was able to secure the dismissal of pro-Alid preachers, and the protection by armed escort of Sunni ones that were threatened by Shi&#x27;a partisans.

===Death and succession===
As al-Ghalib had died in January 1019, in 1030 al-Qadir named his younger son Abu Ja&#x27;far, the future al-Qa&#x27;im, as his heir, a decision also taken completely independently of the Buyid rulers. Al-Qadir died after an illness on 29 November 1031. Initially he was buried in the caliphal palace, but in the next year he was ceremonially moved to al-Rusafa, to a family mausoleum that may have been the same one as constructed by his father, al-Ta&#x27;i, where al-Qadir&#x27;s parents were also buried. The succession of al-Qa&#x27;im was smooth and uncontested.

==Legacy==
Medieval sources generally give a favourable view of al-Qadir as a mild-mannered and gentle person. He went out in disguise among the people, gave alms to the poor, and regularly attended public sessions where the commoners could voice their complaints (). The renowned 12th-century Muslim religious scholar Ibn al-Jawzi lauded al-Qadir&#x27;s personal religious devotion and piety, and held him to have been &quot;one of the best Abbasid caliphs&quot;; his personal austerity was such that the late 11th-century vizier and historian, Abu Shuja al-Rudhrawari, called him &quot;the monk of the Abbasids&quot;. Both Ibn al-Jawzi and the slightly later historian Ibn al-Athir stress that during al-Qadir&#x27;s reign, the Abbasid dynasty and the office of the caliphate began to recover their previous prestige and authority.

Al-Qadir&#x27;s reign was an important turning point in the history of the Abbasid caliphate and Sunni Islam. Previous Abbasid caliphs had sympathized with rationalist schools like the Mu&#x27;tazilites, and been opposed by the conservative traditionalist Sunni scholars. One of the most notable Sunni scholars, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, founder of the Hanbali school, had been persecuted by the Inquisition-like , founded by Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun (). Al-Qadir on the other hand succeeded in repositioning the caliphate as the champion of conservative Sunnism, specifically of the Hanbali branch. Apart from the decrees issued in his own name, he commissioned works by theologians and jurists. Al-Mawardi&#x27;s &quot;al-Iqna&quot; or even his famous &quot;al-Ahkam al-Sultaniyya&quot;, the &quot;Mukhtasar&quot;s of al-Quduri and Abd al-Wahhab al-Maliki, as well as a refutation of doctrines by Ali ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Istakhri, are said to have been composed on his request.

Al-Qadir&#x27;s edicts do not survive in full in the sources, but a consolidated &#x27;Qadiri Creed&#x27; (), that has come down to the present day, was current by the reign of al-Qa&#x27;im. The establishment of such a creed a seminal moment in the history of Sunni Islam. Until then, the Sunnis had defined themselves mostly in opposition to the Shi&#x27;a, but, as the historian Hugh Kennedy put it, &quot;now there was a body of positive belief which had to be accepted by anyone claiming to be a Sunni&quot;. Al-Qadir&#x27;s statement of faith provided a definition of belief, and, conversely, of unbelief; giving Sunni jurists a template by which to issue rulings (). The condemnation of Shi&#x27;a practices further created a sharp distinction between Sunni and Shi&#x27;a, that had not hitherto been the case. The effect was, according to Kennedy, that &quot;it was no longer possible to be simply a Muslim, one was either a Sunni or a Shi&#x27;a&quot;. Al-Qadir thus laid the ideological foundations for what has been termed the &#x27;Sunni Revival&#x27; of the 11th century, which culminated with the destruction of the Buyids by the Seljuk Turks, a new steppe power who saw themselves as champions of Sunnism and of the Abbasid caliph.

Al-Qadir&#x27;s forty-year rule, followed by a similarly long reign under al-Qa&#x27;im (1031–1075) that was in many ways a continuation of his own, restored stability to the Abbasid caliphate, and marked the re-emergence of the Abbasid caliphs as independent political actors. Although their direct authority was limited to Baghdad and its environs, the Abbasids wielded considerable influence across the wider Muslim world as sources of political legitimacy, and in the 12th century even managed to re-establish enough independent military power to secure rule of Iraq under their direct control.

<text>Abū Ja&#x27;far Abdallah ibn Aḥmad al-Qādir (), better known by his regnal name al-Qā&#x27;im bi-amri &#x27;llāh () or simply as al-Qā&#x27;im; 8 November 1001 – 3 April 1075), was the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad from 1031 to 1075. He was the son of the previous caliph, al-Qadir. Al-Qa&#x27;im&#x27;s reign coincided with the end of the Buyid dynasty&#x27;s dominance of the caliphate and the rise of the Seljuk dynasty.

== Early life ==
Al-Qa&#x27;im was born on 8 November 1001. He was the son of Abbasid caliph al-Qadir (r. 991–1031) and his concubine named Qatr al-Nada (died 1060), an Armenian or Greek, also known as Alam. 

His father, Al-Qadir had publicly proclaimed his just nine-year-old son Muhammad (elder brother of Al-Qa&#x27;im) as heir apparent, with the title of al-Ghalib Bi&#x27;llah, in 1001. However, Muhammad died before his father and never ascended to the throne.

In 1030, al-Qadir named his son &quot;Abu Ja&#x27;far&quot;, the future Al-Qa&#x27;im, as his heir, a decision taken completely independently of the Buyid emirs. Al-Qadir died after an illness on 29 November 1031. Initially he was buried in the caliphal palace, but in the next year he was ceremonially moved to al-Rusafa. Al-Qa&#x27;im, meanwhile, received &quot;the usual oath of allegiance&quot; on 12 December 1031.

== Reign ==
During the first half of al-Qa&#x27;im&#x27;s long reign, hardly a day passed in the capital without turmoil. Frequently the city was left without a ruler; the Buwayhid Emir was often forced to flee the capital. 

At this point, the caliph had &quot;very limited personal resources at his command&quot;, but he had recovered a bit of power from earlier periods and was able to arbitrate between the Buyid emirs Jalal al-Dawla and Abu Kalijar. In 1032, al-Qa&#x27;im sent the jurist al-Mawardi to meet with Abu Kalijar in secret; he was to refuse to grant him any title but &quot;Malik al-Dawla&quot;.

While the Seljuk dynasty&#x27;s influence grew, Chaghri Beg married his daughter, Khadija Arslan Khatun, to Al-Qa&#x27;im in 1056.

The Seljuk ruler Tughril overran Syria and Armenia. He then cast an eye upon Baghdad. It was at a moment when the city was in the last agony of violence and fanaticism. Toghrül, under cover of intended pilgrimage to Mecca, entered Iraq with a heavy force, and assuring the Caliph of pacific views and subservience to his authority, begged permission to visit the capital. The Turks and Buwayhids were unfavorable, but Tughril was acknowledged as Sultan by the Caliph in the public prayers. A few days after, Tughril himself — having sworn to be true not only to the Caliph, but also to the Buwayhid amir, al-Malik al-Rahim, made his entry into the capital, where he was well received both by chiefs and people.

The Turkic general Arslan al-Basasiri revolted in 1058 and successfully took Baghdad while Tughril was occupied with his brother&#x27;s revolt in Iran. Al-Qa&#x27;im originally stayed in Baghdad during these events but was later exiled to Anah on al-Basasiri&#x27;s orders. For about a year, al-Basasiri kept al-Qa&#x27;im as his hostage in Anah, as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Tughril. Tughril ended up securing al-Qa&#x27;im&#x27;s freedom by going directly to the amir guarding him, bypassing negotiations with al-Basasiri altogether.

After al-Basasiri died and his revolt came to an end, the Seljuks were left as the single dominant power over al-Qa&#x27;im&#x27;s caliphate. They were similar to the Buyids in this regard, although the Sunni Seljuks were more closely aligned with al-Qa&#x27;im in religious matters. Sectarian conflict was a prominent issue during this part of al-Qa&#x27;im&#x27;s reign. A notable incident concerned the opening of the Nizamiyya of Baghdad, a &quot;madrasa&quot; affiliated with the Shafi&#x27;i legal school, in 1067; its opening inflamed tensions with the Hanbalis. Al-Qa&#x27;im was reluctant to act without first consulting with the Seljuk sultan and was ultimately unable to control the situation.

Fakhr ad-Dawla Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Jahir was appointed as vizier by al-Qa&#x27;im in 1062. Fakhr ad-Dawla arrived and was &quot;showered with gifts, robes of honor, and the title &quot;Fakhr ad-Dawla&quot; (&#x27;glory of the dynasty&#x27;).&quot; According to Sibt ibn al-Jawzi, he was also given the additional title &quot;Sharaf al-wuzarā&quot;&#x27;.

Fakhr ad-Dawla&#x27;s first tenure lasted until 1068, when he was dismissed for a series of &quot;infractions&quot; (&quot;dhunūb&quot;) he had committed. The reasons included &quot;his presence in the &quot;Bāb al-Hujra&quot; (Privy Chamber) without permission, and his wearing of &#x27;Adud ad-Dawla&#x27;s ceremonial robes.&quot; In other words, he had been acting above his station. According to the diary of Abu Ali ibn al-Banna, the dismissal was on Tuesday, 9 September 1068. Fakhr ad-Dawla was &quot;despondent and apologetic&quot; and &quot;acquiesced in tears&quot;. He was escorted out of Baghdad on Thursday night (11 September) and ended up traveling to the court of the Banu Mazyad ruler Nur ad-Dawla Dubays. His belongings were later sent to him.

The competition to replace Fakhr ad-Dawla as vizier was fierce. Three different candidates were seriously considered, but none of them successfully took office as vizier. The caliph&#x27;s initial choice was Abu Ya&#x27;la, father of Abu Shuja al-Rudhrawari, but he died on 11 September - before Fakhr ad-Dawla had even left Baghdad. Another early front-runner was the &quot;za&#x27;im&quot; Ibn Abd ar-Rahim, who was sent a letter to inform him of his selection to the vizierate before someone brought his sordid past to the caliph&#x27;s attention: he had been part of al-Basasiri&#x27;s entourage during his rebellion in 1058, and he had taken part in looting the caliph&#x27;s palace and &quot;attacking&quot; the women of the harem. His name was immediately removed from contention. At this point, around mid-late November, Ibn al-Banna wrote that a rumor had started to go around that al-Qa&#x27;im would reinstate Fakhr ad-Dawla as vizier. At some point, another candidate, a Hanbali named Abu&#x27;l-&#x27;Ala&#x27;, was considered, but he never took office.

Meanwhile, Nur ad-Dawla Dubays had been making &quot;entreaties to the caliph&quot; on Fakhr ad-Dawla&#x27;s behalf. Eventually, Fakhr ad-Dawla was brought back to serve as vizier. A group of administrative officials went out to meet with him on Sunday, 7 December, in advance of his return to Baghdad. Ibn al-Banna&#x27;s diary gives the date of his reentry to Baghdad as Wednesday, 10 December 1068. Crowds came to watch and he was &quot;met by the troops, the courtiers, and the leading figures&quot;. Vizieral robes of honor were made ready for him on 29 December, and they were bestowed upon him on Wednesday, 31 December. People went to congratulate him the next day. Then on Friday, 2 January 1069, he went on horseback to the Jami al-Mansur in the robes of honor; again, crowds gathered to see him, and in some places they &quot;sprinkled&quot; coins on him.

Al-Qa&#x27;im does not seem to have held a grudge against Fakhr ad-Dawla and entrusted him and his son Amid ad-Dawla with a wide range of duties. Sometime around 1071, there was a &quot;diplomatic fracas&quot; between Fakhr ad-Dawla and the Seljuk administration involving a delay in exchanging robes of honor. When Alp Arslan died in 1072, the Banu Jahir were tasked with overseeing the official mourning as well as the ceremonial exchange of loyalty and robes of honor between al-Qa&#x27;im and the new Seljuk sultan Malik-Shah I. On 26 September 1073, Fakhr ad-Dawla oversaw the signing of the controversial Hanbali scholar Ibn Aqil&#x27;s public recantation of his beliefs at the caliphal chancery. This document of retraction is the only one of its kind to survive in full from the middle ages to the present day; the episode marked the ascendancy of traditionalism in Baghdad in the 11th century.

During this and the previous caliphs&#x27; period, literature, especially Persian literature, flourished under the patronage of the Buwayhids. The famous philosopher al-Farabi died in 950; al-Mutanabbi, acknowledged in the East as the greatest of Arabic poets, and himself an Arab, in 965; and the Persian Abu Ali Husayn ibn Abdallah ibn Sina (Avicenna) in 1037.

In 1058 in Bahrain, a dispute over the reading of the &quot;khutba&quot; in Al-Qa&#x27;im&#x27;s name between members of the Abd al-Qays tribe and the millenarian Ismaili Qarmatian state prompted a revolt led by Abu al-Bahlul al-Awwam that threw off Qarmatian rule and led to the unravelling of the Qarmatian state which finally collapsed in al-Hasa in 1067.

==Family==
One of Al-Qa&#x27;im&#x27;s wives was the sister of Abu Nasr bin Buwayh also known as Malik Rahim. She died in 1049–50. Another wife was Chaghri Beg&#x27;s daughter Khadija Arslan Khatun. She had been betrothed to his only son Dhakhirat al-Mulk Abu&#x27;al-Abbas Muhammad. However, Muhammad died, and Khadija Arslan married Al-Qa&#x27;im in 1056. After Al-Qa&#x27;im&#x27;s death in 1075, she married Ali ibn Faramurz. One of Al-Qa&#x27;im&#x27;s concubines was Al-Jiha al-
Qa&#x27;mya, an Armenian.

His son Muhammad had a son, Al-Muqtadi, who succeeded his grandfather, born to an Armenian concubine named Urjuwan also known as Qurrut al-Ayn.

Al-Qa&#x27;im had a daughter named Sayyida. In 1061, Seljuk Sultan Tughril I sent the &quot;qadi&quot; of Ray to Baghdad, to ask her hand in marriage to him. The marriage contract was concluded in August–September 1062 outside Tabriz, with a marriage proportion of one hundred thousand dinars. She was brought to the Sultan&#x27;s palace in March–April 1063. After Tughril&#x27;s death, his successor Sultan Alp Arslan sent her back to Baghdad in 1064. In 1094, Caliph Al-Mustazhir compelled her to remain in her house lest she should intrigue for his overthrow. She died on 20 October 1102.

== Death ==
When al-Qa&#x27;im was on his deathbed in 1075, Fakhr ad-Dawla took charge of his personal care - al-Qa&#x27;im did not want bloodletting but Fakhr ad-Dawla had it done anyway. Before he died, al-Qa&#x27;im advised his grandson and successor al-Muqtadi to keep the Banu Jahir in their position: &quot;I have not seen better persons for the &quot;dawla&quot; than Ibn Jahir and his son; do not turn away from them.&quot;

Al-Qa&#x27;im died on 3 April 1074 at the age of 73. He was succeeded by his grandson Al-Muqtadi as the twenty-seventh Abbasid Caliph.

<text>Abū&#x27;l-Qasim ʿAbd Allāh ibn Muhammad ibn al-Qa&#x27;im (Arabic: أبو القاسم عبد الله بن محمد بن القائم) better known by his regnal name al-Muqtadi (Arabic: المقتدي &#x27;the follower&#x27;; 1056 – February 1094) was the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad from 1075 to 1094. He succeeded his grandfather caliph al-Qa&#x27;im in 1075 as the twenty-seventh Abbasid caliph.

== Biography ==
He was born to Muhammad Dhakirat, the son of caliph Al-Qa&#x27;im, and an Armenian slave girl named Urjuman. His full name was ʿAbd Allāh ibn Muhammad ibn al-Qa&#x27;im and his Kunya was Abū&#x27;l-Qasim. He was born in 24 July 1056.

When al-Qa&#x27;im was on his deathbed in 1075, Fakhr ad-Dawla took charge of his personal care - al-Qa&#x27;im did not want bloodletting but Fakhr ad-Dawla had it done anyway. Before he died, al-Qa&#x27;im advised his grandson and successor al-Muqtadi to keep the Banu Jahir in their position: &quot;I have not seen better persons for the &quot;dawla&quot; than Ibn Jahir and his son; do not turn away from them.&quot; Al-Muqtadi ascended to the throne on 2 April 1075.

In 1077, deadly riots broke out in Baghdad between the city&#x27;s Hanbali and Ash&#x27;ari factions when Abu Nasr ibn al-Ustadh Abi al-Qasim al-Qushayri arrived in town to become lecturer at the city&#x27;s nizamiyya. During the riots, Nizam al-Mulk&#x27;s son Mu&#x27;ayyad al-Mulk&#x27;s life was endangered. Nizam al-Mulk blamed Fakhr ad-Dawla for the whole affair and in 1078 sent his representative Gohar-A&#x27;in to the caliph to demand Fakhr ad-Dawla&#x27;s removal and to have the Banu Jahir&#x27;s followers arrested. Gohar-A&#x27;in arrived on 23 July and was granted an audience on Tuesday, 14 August, during which he handed over a letter requesting Fakhr ad-Dawla&#x27;s removal. Al-Muqtadi initially balked at the demand, but by 27 August Gohar-A&#x27;in was threatening to attack the palace unless he complied. At that point, al-Muqtadi had no choice – the Abbasids lacked a military of their own and were powerless to resist Seljuk interference. Fakhr ad-Dawla apparently resigned (instead of being fired) and al-Muqtadi had him placed under house arrest.

Meanwhile, Amid ad-Dawla had left for Isfahan once he heard of Nizam al-Mulk&#x27;s plans. He took a circuitous route through the mountains to avoid running into Gohar-A&#x27;in on the way, and he reached Isfahan on 23 July – the same day that Gohar A&#x27;in reached Baghdad. Amid ad-Dawla met with Nizam al-Mulk and the two parties eventually reconciled, which they sealed with a marriage contract between Nizam al-Mulk&#x27;s granddaughter and Amid ad-Dawla. Al-Muqtadi did not initially rehire the Banu Jahir and instead kept them under house arrest, but Nizam al-Mulk later intervened and got them rehired.

Also during Ramadan of 1078 (March–April), Fakhr ad-Dawla had had a minbar (pulpit) made at his expense and bearing the titles of al-Muqtadi. It later ended up broken up and burned down.

In 1081, the caliph sent Fakhr ad-Dawla to Isfahan, laden with gifts and over 20,000 dinars, to negotiate marriage with Malik-Shah&#x27;s daughter. Malik-Shah was grieving the death of his son Da&#x27;ud and did not take part i; the negotiations; rather, Fakhr ad-Dawla went to Nizam al-Mulk. The two worked together this time; they went to the princess&#x27;s foster mother, Turkan Khatun, to make their request. She was disinterested at first because the Ghaznavid ruler had made a better offer: 100,000 dinars. Khadija Arslan Khatun, who had been married to al-Qa&#x27;im, told her that a marriage with the caliph would be more prestigious, and that she should not be asking the caliph for more money.

Eventually, Turkan Khatun agreed to the marriage, but with heavy conditions imposed on al-Muqtadi: in return for marrying the Seljuk princess, al-Muqtadi would pay 50,000 dinars plus an additional 100,000 dinars as &quot;mahr&quot; (bridal gift), give up his current wives and concubines, and agree to not have sexual relations with any other woman. This was an especially heavy significant burden on the Abbasid caliph, since the Abbasids had been tightly controlling their &quot;reproductive politics&quot;, with all their heirs being born to &quot;umm walads&quot; and therefore unrelated to any rival dynasties. By agreeing to Turkan Khatun&#x27;s terms, Fakhr ad-Dawla was putting al-Muqtadi at a severe disadvantage while also benefitting the Seljuks considerably.

In 1083, al-Muqtadi removed the Banu Jahir from office by decree. The circumstances of their removal from office are somewhat unclear - historians gave varying accounts. In Sibt ibn al-Jawzi&#x27;s version, al-Muqtadi had become suspicious of the Banu Jahir, prompting them to leave for Khorasan without requesting official permission; this further aroused al-Muqtadi&#x27;s suspicions and he retroactively fired them after they had left. He then wrote to the Seljuks, telling them not to employ the Banu Jahir in their administration. In Ibn al-Athir&#x27;s version, the Seljuks at some point approached al-Muqtadi and asked to employ the Banu Jahir themselves, and al-Muqtadi agreed. Al-Bundari offers no details about the firing itself but wrote instead that the Seljuks sent representatives to meet the Banu Jahir in Baghdad (rather than in Khorasan).

According to Ibn al-Athir&#x27;s account, the Banu Jahir left Baghdad on Saturday, 22 July 1083. They were succeeded as viziers by Abu&#x27;l-Fath al-Muzaffar, son of the &quot;ra&#x27;is al-ru&#x27;asa&quot;&#x27;, who had previously been &quot;in charge of the palace buildings&quot;.

Al-Muqtadi was honored by the Seljuk sultan Malik-Shah I, during whose reign the Caliphate was recognized throughout the extending range of Seljuk conquest. Arabia, with the Holy Cities, now recovered from the Fatimids, acknowledged again the spiritual jurisdiction of the Abbasids.

Malik-Shah I arranged a marriage between his daughter and al-Muqtadi, possibly planning on the birth of a son who could serve as both caliph and sultan. Though the couple had a son, the mother left with her infant to the court of Isfahan. Following the failure of the marriage, the Sultan grew critical of the Caliph&#x27;s interference in affairs of state, and sent an order for him to retire to Basra. The death of Malik-Shah I shortly after, however, made the command inoperative.

In 1092, when Malik Shah I was assassinated shortly after Nizam al-Mulk, Taj al-Mulk nominated Mahmud as Sultan and set out for Isfahan. Mahmud was a child, and his mother Terken Khatun wished to seize power in his stead. To accomplish this, she entered negotiations with the Caliph al-Muqtadi to secure her rule. The Caliph opposed both a child and a woman as ruler, and could not be persuaded to allow the &quot;khutba&quot;, the sign of the sovereign, to be proclaimed in the name of a woman. Eventually, however, the Caliph agreed to let her govern if the khutba was said in the name of her son, and if she did so assisted by a vizier he appointed for her, a condition she saw herself forced to accept.

== Treatment of Jews ==
Obadiah the Proselyte, who lived in Baghdad towards the end of al-Muqtadi&#x27;s reign, records:Al-Muqtadi told Abu Shuja, his vizier, to mark the Jews dwelling in the city of Baghdad with distinctive dress, and he sought many times to destroy them, but the God of Israel thwarted his intent and hid them from his wrath. [Abu Shuja] put a yellow sign upon on the head of each Jew and a silver-&quot;mithqal&quot; of lead on the neck of each Jew, which was inscribed &quot;dhimmi&quot;—for the Jews were to be taxed. He also required the Jews to wear [yellow] girdles. Abu Shuja had two signs placed upon the Jewish women: the shoes belonging to each woman had to be one red and the other black, and each woman had to wear a small brass bell on her shoe or neck, in order by their sound to distinguish between Jewish and gentile women. He further appointed cruel men over the Jewish men, and cruel women over the Jewish women, to oppress them with every kind of curse, spite, and shame. The gentiles would mock them, and the &quot;am ha&#x27;aretz&quot; and their children would strike the Jews in all the areas of the city. Now this was the tax which [Al-Muqtadi] ordered to be levied over the Jews. . .

==Family==
Al-Muqtadi&#x27;s first wife was Sifri Khatun. She was the daughter of Sultan Alp Arslan. In 1071–72, his father Al-Qa&#x27;im sent his wazir Ibn Al-Jahir to ask her hand in marriage, to which demand the Sultan agreed. His second wife was Mah-i Mulk Khatun, daughter of Sultan Malik-Shah I. In March 1082, Al-Muqtadi sent Abu Nasr ibn Jahir to Malik Shah in Isfahan to ask for her hand in marriage. Her father gave his consent and the marriage contract was concluded. She arrived Baghdad in March 1087. The marriage was consummated in May 1087. She gave birth to Prince Ja&#x27;far on 31 January 1088. But then Al-Muqtadi began to avoid her and she asked permission to return home. She left Baghdad for Khurasan on 29 May 1089, accompanied by her son. Subsequently, news of her death reached Baghdad. Her ailing father, brought her son back to Baghdad in October 1092. Prince Ja&#x27;far was taken back to the Caliphal Palace, where he remained until his death on 21 June 1093. He was buried near the caliphal tombs in the Rusafah Cemetery. One of Al-Muqtadi&#x27;s concubines was Kalbahaar or Jalb&#x27;har, also known as Tayf al-Khayal. She was a Turkish and was the mother of caliph Al-Mustazhir.

== Succession ==
Al-Muqtadi died in 1094 at the age of 37–38. He was succeeded by his 16-year-old son Ahmad al-Mustazhir as Caliph.

<text>De La Rue plc (, ) is a British company headquartered in Basingstoke, England, that produces secure digital and physical protections for goods, trade, and identities in 140 countries. It sells to governments, central banks, and businesses. Its authentication division provides government revenue technology, brand protection, and ID security, such as polycarbonate data pages for passports. Its currency division designs and produces banknotes, secure polymer substrate and banknote security features. This includes security holograms, security threads and security printed products for central banks and currency issuing authorities. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange. It is the world&#x27;s largest commercial printer of banknotes.

==History==
The company was founded by Thomas de la Rue, who moved from Guernsey to London in 1821 and set up in business as a Leghorn straw hat maker, then as a stationer and printer. In 1831 he secured a Royal Warrant for his business to produce playing cards. In 1855 it started printing postage stamps and in 1860 banknotes. The company&#x27;s first banknotes were made for Mauritius. In 1896, the family partnership was converted into a private company.

In 1921, the de la Rue family sold their interests. The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1947. Then called &quot;Thomas De La Rue &amp; Company, Limited&quot;, it changed its name in 1958 to &quot;The De La Rue Company Limited&quot;. A takeover bid for De La Rue was made by the Rank Organisation in 1968, but this was rejected by the Monopolies commission as being against the public interest. In 1991 the company&#x27;s name was changed again – this time to De La Rue plc.

In 1965 De La Rue established a joint venture with the Italian printer and inventor Gualtiero Giori called De La Rue Giori. Based in Switzerland, the company specialized in building banknote printing equipment. The company printed banknotes for the Central Bank of Iran during the 1960s.

In 1995, the company acquired Portals Limited which had been listed on the London stock market since 1904. For almost 300 years Portals had been one of the leading banknote paper manufacturers in the world, having manufactured banknote paper for the Bank of England since 1724.

In 1997, De La Rue acquired Harrison and Sons, the stamp and banknote printers based in High Wycombe. The factory closed permanently in 2003.

In early 2002, De La Rue purchased Sequoia Voting Systems, a California based company that was a large provider of electronic voting systems in the United States, from Jefferson Smurfit plc for $23 million.

Following the Panama Papers leak, it was revealed that from 2002 until 2010, De La Rue had secretly contracted New Delhi businessman Somendra Khosla to obtain contracts in exchange for a 15% commission.

In 2003, the company acquired the Debden based banknote printing operations of the Bank of England. In 2003 and 2004 the company supplied banknotes to Iraq.

The company was recognised by Hermann Simon as a role model for other small- to medium-sized businesses in his book &quot;Hidden Champions&quot;.

The Highest Perfection, a history of De La Rue was published in 2011. Written by Peter Pugh for De La Rue, it covered the years 1712–2003.

In August 2014, the company announced the appointment of Martin Sutherland (formerly of BAE Systems Applied Intelligence) as chief executive officer.

In 2016, the Cash Handling division (Cash Processing Systems) was sold to Privet Capital. In December 2016, the company announced it had purchased the DuPont Authentication division.

In March 2018, the company sold the paper business. De La Rue retained a 10% share in the new business, Portals International Limited. In April 2018, the company decided to appeal against the decision of the British government to manufacture passports in France. It subsequently decided against appealing.

In October 2019 the company sold its Identity Solutions business to HID Global for £42m.

On 26 July 2019, the Serious Fraud Office opened an investigation into De La Rue plc for suspected corruption in South Sudan. They later decided to close the case.

In April 2023, it was announced that chairman Kevin Loosemore was stepping down in May 2023 to &quot;draw a line under recent speculation surrounding the leadership of the company&quot;. Following the launch of a fast-track search for a replacement, the company appointed Clive Wiley in May 2023.

In February 2024, it was announced that the company had been contracted, alongside the Bank of England, to design new bank notes carrying King Charles III&#x27;s portrait.

<doc id="1091272" wikidata="Q293632" url="?curid=1091272" title="Al-Mustazhir">
<text>Abu&#x27;l-Abbas Ahmad ibn Abdallah al-Muqtadi () usually known simply by his regnal name Al-Mustazhir billah () (b. April/May 1078 – 6 August 1118 d.) was the Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad from 1094 to 1118. He succeeded his father al-Muqtadi as the Caliph. The main and important events during his reign are; appearance of the First Crusade in Western Syria, Muslim protest in Baghdad against crusaders, his efforts to help Mawdud to organize several expeditions to reconquer lands from the Crusaders.

== Biography ==
Al-Mustazhir&#x27;s father was caliph Al-Muqtadi. His mother was Tayf al-Khayal, a Turkish concubine. He was born in 1078 (the 5th Islamic century). Al-Mustazhir&#x27;s full name was Ahmad ibn Abdallah al-Muqtadi and his kunya was &quot;Abu&#x27;l-Abbas&quot;. 

When his father died on 3 February 1094 at the age of 37 – 38. Al-Mustazhir succeeded him. At the time of accession to the throne, he was just sixteen years old.

Amid ad-Dawla would remain Abbasid vizier until 1099 or 1100, when he was removed from office and imprisoned by the Seljuk sultan Berkyaruq. There are different accounts for Amid ad-Dawla&#x27;s downfall – in one, Mu&#x27;ayyad al-Mulk, who had succeeded his father Nizam al-Mulk as Seljuk vizier, had offered the Abbasid vizierate to al-A&#x27;azz, and the two collaborated to remove him from office without input from Barkyaruq. In another, Barkyaruq himself fired Amid ad-Dawla and fined him &quot;an enormous sum&quot; for misappropriating government funds before imprisoning him. In any case, Amid ad-Dawla died in prison shortly after, in 1100.

After Amid ad-Dawla&#x27;s downfall, his brother al-Kafi served as vizier to the Abbasid caliph al-Mustazhir from 1102/3 until 1106/7 and then again from 1108/9 until 1113/4.

During Al-Mustazhir&#x27;s twenty-four year incumbency he was politically irrelevant, despite the civil strife at home and the appearance of the First Crusade in Syria. An attempt was even made by crusader Raymond IV of Toulouse to attack Baghdad, but he was defeated near Mersivan during the Crusade of 1101. The global Muslim population had climbed to about 5 per cent as against the Christian population of 11 per cent by 1100.

In the year 492 AH (AD 1099), Jerusalem was captured by the crusaders and its inhabitants were massacred. Preachers travelled throughout the caliphate proclaiming the tragedy and rousing men to recover from infidel hands Al-Aqsa, the scene of the Prophet&#x27;s heavenly flight. But whatever the success elsewhere, the mission failed in the eastern provinces, which were occupied with their own troubles, and moreover cared little for the Holy Land, dominated as it then was by the Fatimid faith. Crowds of exiles, seeking refuge in Baghdad, joined there with the populace in crying out for war against the Franks (the name used by Muslims for the crusaders). For two Fridays in 1111 the insurgents, incited by Ibn al-Khashshab, the &quot;qadi&quot; of Aleppo, stormed the Great Mosque, broke the pulpit and throne of the caliph in pieces, and shouted down the service, but neither the sultan nor the caliph were interested in sending an army west.

==Family==
One of Al-Mustazhir&#x27;s wives was Ismah Khatun. She was the daughter of Seljuk Sultan Malik-Shah I. Al-Mustazhir married her in Isfahan in 1108–9. She later came to Baghdad and took up residence in the Caliphal Palace. On 3 February 1112, she gave birth to Abu Ishaq Ibrahim, who died of smallpox in October 1114, and was buried in the mausoleum of al-Muqtadir in Rusafah Cemetery, beside his uncle Ja&#x27;far, son of the caliph al-Muqtadi. Upon the death of Al-Mustazhir, Ismah returned to Isfahan, where she died, and was buried within the law college that she had founded there on Barracks Market Street. She died in 1141–42. One of his concubines was Lubanah. She was from Baghdad, and was the mother of the future Caliph Al-Mustarshid. She died in 1133–34. Another concubine was Ashin. She was from Syria, and was the mother of the future Caliph Al-Muqtafi. Some other concubines were Nzhh, an Ethiopian, Aqblan, a Turkish and Razin. Another son was Amir Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Ali. He died in June 1131.

== Succession == 
Al-Mustazhir died in the year 1118 at the age of 40. He was succeeded by his son Al-Mustarshid as the 29th Abbasid Caliph.

<text>Abu Mansur al-Faḍl ibn Ahmad al-Mustazhir (; 1092 – 29 August 1135) better known by his regnal name Al-Mustarshid Billah () was the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad from 1118 to 1135. He was son of his predecessor, caliph al-Mustazhir. He succeeded his father in the year 1118 as the Abbasid caliph.

== Biography ==
Al-Mustarshid was born in 1092. He was son of Caliph Al-Mustazhir. His mother was a Slavic concubine named Lubanah. She was from Baghdad. His was named Al-Fadl by his father. His full name was Al-Fadl ibn Ahmad al-Mustazhir and his Kunya was &quot;Abu Mansur&quot;. After the death of his father in 1118, he succeeded him as Caliph. He achieved more independence as a ruler while the Seljuk sultan Mahmud II was engaged in war in the East.

In 1122, al-Mustarshid deposed and imprisoned his vizier Amid al-dawla Jalal al-Din Hasan ibn Ali. Mahmud II then imposed Ahmad ibn Nizam al-Mulk as al-Mustarshid&#x27;s vizier. Ahmad later fought against the &quot;Mazyadid&quot; chief Dubays ibn Sadaqa. Ahmad also fortified the walls around Baghdad.

One year later, Mahmud II removed Shams al-Mulk Uthman as his vizier, and had him executed. The Abbasid caliph then used this opportunity to get rid of Ahmad as his vizier. Ahmad then retired to a school in Baghdad which was founded by his father, the Nezamiyeh, where he lived the last 25 years of his life, dying in 1149/1150.

In 1123, Banu Mazyad chieftain Dubais ibn Sadaqah tried to take advantage of the momentary lack of power and, after plundering Bosra, attacked Baghdad together with a young brother of the sultan, Ghiyath ad-Din Mas’ud (known as Mas&#x27;ud). He was however crushed by an army under Zengi and Ahmad ibn Nizam al-Mulk. During the same year, al-Mustarshid removed Ahmad ibn Nizam al-Mulk as his vizier. In 1125, it was the time of al-Mustarshid to rebel. He sent an army to take Wasit but was defeated near Baghdad and imprisoned in his palace the next year.

After the death of Mahmud II, a civil war broke out in the Seljuk western territories. Zengi was recalled to the east by certain rebel members, stimulated by the caliph and Dubais. Zengi was beaten and fled. The caliph pursued him to Mosul, and besieged him there but without success for three months. It was nonetheless a milestone in the revival of the military power of the caliphate.

Zengi now resumed operations in Syria and, in 1134, laid siege to Damascus, but was induced, partly by the bravery of the enemy, partly at the instance of the caliph, to whom Zengi had made some concession in the public prayers, to relinquish the attempt. Recalled again by troubles in the east, he was unable to do much against the Crusaders till after al-Mustarshid&#x27;s death.

Not long after the siege of Damascus, al-Mustarshid launched a military campaign against Seljuk sultan Mas&#x27;ud, who had obtained the title in Baghdad in January 1133 by the caliph himself. The rival armies met near Hamadan. The caliph, deserted by his troops, was taken prisoner, and pardoned on the promising not to quit his palace. Left in the caliphal tent, however, in the sultan&#x27;s absence, he was found murdered while reading the Quran, as is supposed, by an emissary of the Assassins, who had no love for the caliph. Modern historians have suspected that Mas&#x27;ud instigated the murder although the two most important historians of the period Ibn al-Athir and Ibn al-Jawzi did not speculate on this matter.

Physically, al-Mustarshid was a red-haired man with blue eyes and freckles. He was succeeded by his son al-Rashid.

==Family==
Al-Mustarshid&#x27;s only wife was Amira Khatun, the daughter of Seljuk sultan Ahmad Sanjar. They married in 1124. One of his concubines was Khushf. She was from Iraq, and was the mother of his son, the future Caliph Al-Rashid Billah. He had another son who died of smallpox in 1131 aged twenty one.

==Succession==
He was succeeded by his son al-Rashid Billah in the year 1135. He ruled for just one year from 1135 up to his deposition on 17 August 1136. When the populace of Baghdad rose in revolt against him. His son was succeeded by his half-brother al-Muqtafi on 17 September 1136.

Al-Muqtafi was the son of al-Mustazhir from his concubine named Ashin. She was from Syria.

<doc id="1091276" wikidata="Q2707827" url="?curid=1091276" title="HMS Indefatigable (1784)">
<text>HMS &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was one of the 64-gun third-rate ships-of-the-line designed by Sir Thomas Slade in 1761 for the Royal Navy. She was built as a ship-of-the-line, but most of her active service took place after her conversion to a 44-gun razee frigate. She had a long career under several distinguished commanders, serving throughout the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. She took some 27 prizes, alone or in company, and the Admiralty authorised the issue of four clasps to the Naval General Service Medal in 1847 to any surviving members of her crews from the respective actions. She was broken up in 1816.

==Construction==
&quot;Indefatigable&quot; was ordered on 3 August 1780 (long after Slade&#x27;s death), and her keel was laid down in May 1781 at the Bucklers Hard shipyard in Hampshire owned by Henry Adams. She was launched in early July 1784 and completed from 11 July to 13 September of that year at Portsmouth Dockyard as a 64-gun two-decked third rate for the Royal Navy. She had cost £25,210 4s 5d to build; her total initial cost including fitting out and coppering was £36,154 18s 7d. By that time, she was already anachronistic for the role of a ship of the line as the French only built the more powerful 74-gun ships, and was never commissioned in that role.

===Design modification===
In 1794, she was razéed; her upper gun deck was cut away to convert her into a large and heavily armed frigate. The original intention was to retain her twenty-six 24-pounder guns on her gundeck, and to mount eight 12-pounder guns on her quarterdeck and a further four on her forecastle, which would have rated her as a 38-gun vessel. However, it was at this time that the carronade was becoming more popular in the Navy, and her intended armament was altered on 5 December 1794 with the addition of four 42-pounder carronades to go on her quarterdeck and two on her forecastle. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was thereafter rated as a 44-gun fifth-rate frigate, along with and , which were converted at about the same time. The work was carried out at Portsmouth from September 1794 to February 1795 at a cost of £8,764. On 17 February 1795, a further two 12-pounder guns were added to her quarterdeck, though her official rating remained unchanged.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
===Captain Sir Edward Pellew===

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; was first commissioned in December 1794 under Captain Sir Edward Pellew. He commanded her until early 1799.

On 9 March 1795, &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, , and captured numerous French prizes: &quot;Temeraire&quot;, &quot;Minerve&quot;, &quot;Gentille&quot;, &quot;Regeneration&quot;, and a brig and sloop of unknown names. In October, the Dutch East Indiaman &quot;Zeelilee&quot; was wrecked in the Isles of Scilly with the loss of 25 of her 70 crew. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; rescued the survivors.

On 20 March 1796, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and her squadron chased three French corvettes, of which the &quot;Volage&quot; of 26 guns ran ashore under a battery at the mouth of the Loire. &quot;Volage&quot; lost her masts in running ashore, but the French were later able to refloat her. Her two consorts and &quot;Eclatant&quot; escaped into the river. In this action, had four men wounded.

Between 11 and 21 March &quot;Indefatigable&quot;″s squadron captured the vessels &quot;Favorite Sultana&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Providence&quot;, &quot;Four Marys&quot;, &quot;Aimable Justine&quot;, and &quot;Nouvelle Union&quot;. They also destroyed two unnamed brigs and a chasse maree. The vessels sharing in the prize money were: &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, &quot;Concorde&quot;, , &quot;Amazon&quot;, , and the hired armed cutter &quot;Dolly&quot; and hired armed lugger &quot;Duke of York&quot;.

On 13 April 1796, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was in pursuit of a French frigate. Pellew signalled to &quot;Révolutionnaire&quot; to cut her off from the shore. &quot;Révolutionnaire&quot; then captured the French frigate &quot;Unité&quot; after having fired two broadsides into her. &quot;Unité&quot; had nine men killed and 11 wounded; &quot;Révolutionnaire&quot; had no casualties. The Royal Navy took the frigate into service as HMS &quot;Unite&quot;.
On the morning of 20 April 1796, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; sighted the French 44-gun frigate off the Lizard. &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, &quot;Amazon&quot;, and &quot;Concorde&quot; chased &quot;Virginie&quot;, with &quot;Indefatigable&quot; catching her just after midnight on 21 April after a chase of 15 hours and . After an hour and three quarters of fighting, she still had not struck and had somewhat outmaneuvered &quot;Indefatigable&quot; when &quot;Concorde&quot; arrived. Seeing that she was outnumbered, &quot;Virginie&quot; struck.

&quot;Virginie&quot; carried 44 guns, 18 and 9-pounders, and had a crew of 340 men under the command of Citizen Bergeret, Capitaine de Vaisseau. She had 14 or 15 men killed, 17 badly wounded, and 10 slightly. She also had four feet of water in her hold from shot holes. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; had no casualties. Pellew sent &quot;Virginie&quot; into Plymouth under the escort of &quot;Concorde&quot;, and followed the next day with &quot;Amazon&quot;, which had sustained some damage. The Royal Navy took &quot;Virginie&quot; into service as .

In July 1796, there was an initial distribution of £20,000 of prize money for the capture of &quot;Unite&quot; and &quot;Virginie&quot;. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; shared this with &quot;Amazon&quot;, &quot;Révolutionnaire&quot;, &quot;Concorde&quot;, and &quot;Argo&quot;. Apparently, &quot;Duke of York&quot; also shared in some or all of the prize money. In 1847, the Admiralty authorised the issue of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;Indefatigable 20 Apl. 1796&quot;.

On 12 June, &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, &quot;Amazon&quot;, &quot;Concorde&quot;, &quot;Revolutionaire&quot;, and took two French brigs off Ushant – the &quot;Trois Couleurs&quot; and the &quot;Blonde&quot; (alias &quot;Betsey&quot;) – after a chase of 24 hours. &quot;Trois Couleurs&quot; carried 10 guns and a crew of 70. &quot;Blonde&quot; had 16 guns and a crew of 95 men. Each was under the command of an &quot;ensign de vaisseau&quot; and both vessels had left Brest two days earlier for a six-week cruise, but had not yet taken any prizes.

In September 1796, &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, &quot;Phoebe&quot;, &quot;Révolutionnaire&quot;, and &quot;Amazon&quot; captured five Spanish ships.

On 1 October, &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, &quot;Amazon&quot;, &quot;Révolutionnaire&quot;, &quot;Phoebe&quot;, and &quot;Jason&quot; shared in the capture of the &quot;Vrow Delenea Maria&quot;. The next day, Pellew and &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured the privateer schooner &quot;Ariel&quot; of Boston off Corunna. Earlier, Pellew had recaptured the brig &quot;Queen of Naples&quot;, which had been sailing from Lisbon to Cork. From her, he learned that there were two privateers around Corunna, one of which had captured a brig from Lisbon with a cargo of bale goods two days earlier. Pellew immediately set off towards Corunna and was able to intercept the &quot;Ariel&quot;. She had 12 guns and a crew of 75 men. She was 14 days out of Bordeaux. Her consort, the schooner &quot;Vengeur&quot;, was of the same strength, and Pellew yet hoped to catch her, too. The brig from Bristol, however, had made it into the port of Ferrol, where Pellew had earlier chased two French frigates.

In January 1797, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and &quot;Amazon&quot; captured the packet &quot;Sangossee&quot;. On 7 January, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and &quot;Amazon&quot; captured the &quot;Emanuel&quot;. Later that month, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; fought her most famous battle.

The Action of 13 January 1797 was an engagement off the Penmarks involving the two frigates &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and &quot;Amazon&quot; against the French , a 74-gun ship of the line. The battle ended with &quot;Droits de l&#x27;Homme&quot; being driven onto shore in a gale. &quot;Amazon&quot; also ran onto the shore; still, almost her entire crew survived both the battle and the grounding and were captured. Despite being embayed and having damaged masts and rigging, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was able to repair the damage and beat off the lee shore, showing excellent seamanship. She had only 19 officers and men wounded, with most of those not being serious. This action resulted the award of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;Indefatigable 13 Jany. 1797&quot; for any crew surviving in 1847.

On 18 January &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was at Falmouth. There she saved all on board when a fire destroyed the American merchantman .

Subsequently, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; or Pellew&#x27;s squadron took more vessels, including privateers, primarily in the Channel. Thus, Pellew reported that, on 30 April 1797, &quot;we&quot; captured the French brigantine privateer &quot;Basque&quot;. She was armed with eight guns and carried a crew of 50 men.

On 11 May, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; in company with &quot;Phoebe&quot;, , , and &quot;Duke of York&quot; captured &quot;Nouvelle Eugénie&quot;. She was a razee privateer of 16 guns and carried a crew of 120 men. She was four days out of Nantes on a 30-day cruise, but had taken no prizes. The Royal Navy took her into service as .

On 21 July, the &quot;Duke of York&quot; returned, having chased a French privateer lugger into the hands of Lieutenant Bray, who commanded the Revenue Cutter &quot;Hind&quot;. &quot;Hind&quot; also recaptured a sloop that the privateer had captured. The lugger was armed with two guns and carried a crew of 25 men.

On 14 October, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; arrived at Teneriffe. There at midnight she captured the French brig corvette . &quot;Ranger&quot; was armed with 14 guns and carried a crew of 70 men. She had been carrying dispatches to the West Indies, which she was able to destroy before capture. The next day, Pellew captured a Spanish schooner carrying a cargo of fish. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was short of water, so he put the crew of &quot;Ranger&quot; on board the schooner (though not &quot;Ranger″&quot;s officers) and sent them ashore at Santa Cruz.

Ten days after that, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured the privateer &quot;Hyène&quot; after a chase of eight hours. She was armed with twenty-four 9-pounder guns and had a crew of 230 men. She was two weeks out of Bayonne but had not captured anything. &quot;Hyène&quot; had apparently mistaken &quot;Indefatigable&quot; for a vessel from Portuguese India. Pellew estimated that, had she not lost her foretopmast in the chase, she might have escaped. She had been the post-ship until her capture in 1793; the Royal Navy took her back into service under her original name.

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; returned to the Channel. On 11 January 1798, she was in company with and &quot;Childers&quot; when they captured the French privateer schooner &quot;Vengeur&quot;. &quot;Vengeur&quot; was a new vessel of 12 guns and 72 men. She was eight days out of Ostend but had taken no prizes. Pellew sent her into Falmouth.

Five days later, in the evening of the 16th, Pellew&#x27;s squadron captured the French privateer &quot;Inconcevable&quot;. She was armed with eight guns and had a crew of 55 men. She was 10 days out of Dunkirk and had taken nothing. Prize money was paid to &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, &quot;Cambrian&quot;, and .

On 28 January, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and &quot;Cambrian&quot; captured the privateer &quot;Heureuse Nouvelle&quot;. She was armed with 22 guns and had a crew of 130 men. She was 36 days out of Brest and, during that time, had captured only one ship, a large American vessel named the &quot;Providence&quot; which had a cargo of cotton and sugar. Pellew sent &quot;Cambrian&quot; in pursuit. &quot;Duke of York&quot; also shared in the capture.

On 30 April 1798, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured the brigantine privateer &quot;Basque&quot;. She was armed with eight guns and had a crew of 50 men. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; captured the &quot;Hope&quot; on 11 July.

At daylight on 4 August, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; sighted the privateer &quot;Heureux&quot; together with a prize and gave chase. The two separated, with the prize heading directly for Bayonne. After a chase of 32 hours on a great circular route, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and her quarry found themselves off Bayonne where &quot;Indefatigable&quot; intercepted the prize and captured her. The privateer was the &quot;Heureux&quot;, of 16 guns and 112 men. Her prize was the &quot;Canada&quot;, John Sewell Master, which had been sailing from Jamaica to London, having stopped in Charlestown, with a cargo of sugar, rum, and coffee. Pellew exchanged prisoners, taking off the crew of the &quot;Canada&quot; and putting on her the crew of &quot;Heureux&quot;. He then drove &quot;Canada&quot; on shore where he hoped that her cargo at least would be destroyed.

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured the French corvette &quot;Vaillante&quot; while cruising in the Bay of Biscay on 8 August, after a chase of 24 hours, which was under the command of Lieutenant de Vaisseau La Porte. The corvette fired a few shots before she struck. She was armed with twenty-two 9-pounder guns and had a crew of 175 men. She had left Rochefort on 1 August, and the Île de Ré on the 4th, where she had picked up 25 banished priests, 27 convicts, and a Madame Rovere and family, all of whom she was taking to Cayenne. She was only 18 months old, coppered, and a fast sailer. The British took her into service as . On 15 November 1798, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured &quot;Mercurius&quot;.

At dawn on 31 December 1798, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured the &quot;Minerve&quot;, five leagues off Ushant. She was armed with 16 guns and carried a crew of 140 men. She was four weeks out of Saint-Malo and was waiting to enter Brest when captured. She had taken several prizes, one of which, the &quot;Asphalon&quot;, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured on 1 January 1799. &quot;Aspahalon&quot;, a Newcastle vessel, had been sailing from Halifax to London with a cargo of sugar, coffee, and tobacco. Other vessels which &quot;Minerve&quot; had captured included &quot;Martinus&quot; (Bremen brig), &quot;Tagus&quot; (Portuguese brig ), &quot;Minerva&quot; (English snow), and &quot;Ann and Dorothea&quot; (aka &quot;Beata Maria&quot;, Danish schooner).

On 14 January 1799, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; recaptured &quot;Argo&quot;, Rich, master, which had been sailing from Gothenburg for Boston when a French privateer had captured her. After her recapture &quot;Argo&quot; arrived at Falmouth.

More captures or recaptures of merchantmen followed. &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, , and recaptured the &quot;Providence&quot; on 10 January 1799, the &quot;Pomona&quot; on 5 February, and the &quot;Wohlfarden&quot; on 9 February.

===Subsequent commanders===
From March 1799 until the end of 1800 &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was under the command of Captain Henry Curzon. On 31 May she captured the brig &quot;Vénus&quot;. &quot;Venus&quot; was armed with twelve 4-pounder guns and two 9-pounders, and carried a crew of 101 men. She was nine weeks out of Rochefort and had captured two prizes, the schooner &quot;Clarence&quot;, sailing from Lisbon to London, and a ship from Lisbon sailing to Hamburg with a cargo of salt. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was apparently also in company with &quot;Fisgard&quot; and &quot;Diamond&quot;.

On 9 October 1799 &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, &quot;Diamond&quot;, &quot;Cambrian&quot;, , &quot;Nymphe&quot; and shared in the capture of the Spanish brig &quot;Nostra Senora de la Solidad&quot;. Then on 7 November &quot;Nymphe&quot;, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and &quot;Diamond&quot; shared in the recapture of the ship &quot;Brailsford&quot;.

Then on 6 January 1800 &quot;Indefatigable&quot; shared with , , and &quot;Stag&quot; in the capture of the French brig &quot;Ursule&quot;. On 11 February &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured the &quot;Vidette&quot;.

On 12 June 1800, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured the French privateer brig &quot;Vengeur&quot;. She was armed with six long 4-pounders and ten 18-pounder carronades, and carried a crew of 102 men. She was two days out of Bordeaux and sailing for the coast of Brazil. &quot;Vengeur&quot; was sailing in company with three letters of marque – a ship, a brig and a schooner – that were bound for Guadeloupe. On 11 June &quot;Vengeur&quot; had captured the Jersey-privateer lugger &quot;Snake&quot;. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; shared the prize money with &quot;Sirius&quot;.

On 3 July &quot;Indefatigable&quot; recaptured the brig &quot;Cultivator&quot;, from the French. Eleven days later, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and &quot;Sirius&quot; captured the French ship &quot;Favori&quot;. The next day &quot;Bordelais&quot; (or &quot;Bourdelois&quot;) captured the &quot;Phoenix&quot;. &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, &quot;Sirius&quot; and shared with &quot;Bordelais&quot; by agreement, and further shared with &quot;Bordelais&quot;.

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; then was with Sir John Borlase Warren&#x27;s squadron at Ferrol. She apparently did not participate in the attack on a fort at the bay of Playa de Dominos (Doniños) on 25 August 1800.

On 22 October &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, took the French 28-gun frigate off the Portuguese coast. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; had been chasing &quot;Venus&quot; from the morning when in the afternoon &quot;Fisgard&quot; came in sight and forced &quot;Venus&quot; to turn. Both British vessels arrived at &quot;Venus&quot; at almost the same time (7pm). &quot;Venus&quot; was armed with 32-guns and had a crew of 200 men. She was sailing from Rochefort to Senegal. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and &quot;Fisgard&quot; shared the prize money with &quot;Boadicea&quot;, &quot;Diamond&quot;, , and the hired armed schooner .

In January 1801 &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was under Captain Matthew Scott. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was part of the squadron that shared by agreement in the prize money from the &quot;Temeraire&quot;, which had captured on 30 May. Similarly, the same vessels shared by agreement in &quot;Dasher&quot;″s capture of &quot;Bien Aimé&quot; on 23 July 1801. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was then paid off later that year. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was laid up in ordinary at Plymouth in March to April 1802, as a result of the peace of October 1801.

==Napoleonic Wars==
Following the resumption of hostilities, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was fitted out for sea between July and September 1803. She was recommissioned under Captain Graham Moore, younger brother of Sir John Moore of Rifle Brigade and Corunna fame.

On 9 August 1804 &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was in sight when recaptured the West Indiaman off Bayonne.

===Action of 5 October 1804===
&quot;Indefatigable&quot;, with Moore as commodore, and frigates , , and intercepted four Spanish frigates off Cadiz under the command of Rear-Admiral Don Joseph Bustamente, Knight of the Order of St. James, on 5 October 1804. They were carrying bullion from Montevideo, South America to Spain. Spain was a neutral country at the time, but was showing strong signs of declaring war in alliance with Napoleonic France. Acting on Admiralty orders, Moore required the Spaniards to change their course and sail for England. Admiral Bustamente refused and a short engagement ensued.

First &quot;Mercedes&quot; blew up. Then &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured &quot;Medée&quot;, and &quot;Lively&quot; captured &quot;Clara&quot;. After a further chase, &quot;Lively&quot; and &quot;Medusa&quot; captured &quot;Fama&quot;.
* &quot;Medée&quot; the flagship was armed with forty-two 18-pounder guns on her main deck and had a crew of 300 men. She lost two men killed and 10 wounded.
* &quot;Fama&quot;, the Commodore&#x27;s ship, was armed with thirty-six 12-pounder guns on her main deck and had a crew of 180 men. She lost 11 killed and 50 wounded.
* &quot;Clara&quot; was armed with thirty-six 12-pounder guns on her main deck and had a crew of 300 men. She lost seven killed and 20 wounded.
* &quot;Mercedes&quot; was armed with thirty-six 12-pounder guns on her main deck and had a crew of 280 men. After she exploded, the British were only able to rescue her second captain and 40 men.

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; had no casualties. &quot;Amphion&quot; had five men wounded, one badly. &quot;Lively&quot; had two killed and four wounded. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and &quot;Amphion&quot; escorted &quot;Medée&quot; and &quot;Fama&quot; to Plymouth. &quot;Medusa&quot; and &quot;Lively&quot; brought in &quot;Clara&quot;. The Royal Navy took &quot;Medea&quot; into service as and &quot;Clara&quot; as .

The value of the treasure was very large and, if it had been treated as Prize of War, then Moore and his fellow captains would have become extremely wealthy. As it was, the money and ships were declared to be &quot;Droits of Admiralty&quot; on the grounds that war had not been declared. Hence the captains and crew shared a relatively small &quot;ex gratia&quot; payment of £160,000 for the bullion, plus the proceeds of the sale of the hull and cargo.

===Normal operations===
In October 1805 &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, now under Captain John Tremayne Rodd (−1809), was part of the blockade of Brest. One boat each from the ships of the line of the squadron, plus three boats each from &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and entered the Gironde on 15 July 1806 to attack two French corvettes and a convoy. A change in the wind permitted all but one corvette to escape. The British captured the French corvette (or &quot;Caesar&quot;), which the Royal Navy took into service as HMS &quot;Cesar&quot;. She was armed with 18 guns, had a crew of 86 men, and was under the command of Monsieur Louis Francois Hector Fourré, &quot;lieutenant de vaisseau&quot;. The French were expecting the attack and put up a strong resistance. The British lost six men killed, 36 wounded and 21 missing. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; alone lost two killed and 11 wounded. The 21 missing men were in a boat from ; a later report suggested that most, if not all, had been taken prisoner. Most of the boats in the attack were so shot through that the British later abandoned them. The vessels claiming prize money included and the hired armed lugger , in addition to the various ships of the line and frigates. This cutting out expedition resulted in the participants qualifying for the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;16 July Boat Service 1806&quot;.

About a year later, on 19 October 1806, &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, , and captured the chasse marees &quot;Achille&quot;, &quot;Jenny&quot;, and &quot;Marianne&quot;. On 5 December 1807 &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured the &quot;Pamelia&quot;. Then on the day after Christmas, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and captured the American ship &quot;Eliza&quot;.

On 7 January 1808 &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and &quot;Tribune&quot; captured the French galiot &quot;Fanny&quot; and her cargo.

Then on 31 July, &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, in company with the gun-brig , captured the letter of marque &quot;Diane&quot;, which was on her way to Île de France, carrying naval stores, as well as letters and dispatches that she threw overboard during the chase. She was six years old, had a burthen of 482 tons (bm), was armed with fourteen 9 and 6-pounder guns, and had a crew of 68 men. She had left the Gironde the evening before on this, her second voyage, to India.

On 19 August &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, still in company with &quot;Conflict&quot;, captured &quot;Adele&quot;. In December a distribution of £10,000 was payable for the proceeds from &quot;Diane&quot; and &quot;Adele&quot;. On 1 and 9 September 1808 &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured two American ships, &quot;Sally&quot; and &quot;Peggy&quot;. and were in company with &quot;Indefatigable&quot; at the time. On 1 November &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured &quot;Bonne Louise&quot;.

On 14 January 1809 &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured French privateer lugger &quot;Clarisse&quot; in the Channel. She was pierced for 14 guns but had only three mounted. She had left Saint-Malo the evening before and had not made any captures. At the time of the capture, &quot;Amazon&quot;, &quot;Iris&quot;, , and &quot;Goldfinch&quot; were in sight. They shared with &quot;Indefatigable&quot; in the proceeds for the hull, but not the bounty money for the captured crew. On 20 February captured the French schooner &quot;Matilda&quot;. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was in company.

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; arrived at the Basque Roads on 25 February. While there she captured two vessels, the Danish ship &quot;Neptunus&quot; on 24 March and the French ship &quot;Nymphe&quot; on 28 March. For the capture of &quot;Neptunus&quot;, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was in company with the sloops and . &quot;Foxhound&quot; was also in company for the capture of &quot;Nymphe&quot;.

In April 1809 &quot;Indefatigable&quot; participated in the battle of the Basque Roads. The action earned her crew another clasp to the Naval General Service Medal: &quot;Basque Roads 1809&quot;.

In October 1809 &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was under Captain Henry E. R. Baker. Captain John Broughton succeeded him in December 1809 and remained in command until 1812.

On 11 January 1810, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured &quot;Mouche № 26&quot; near Cap de Peñas. Under the command of &quot;Enseigne de vausseau provisorie&quot; Fleury, she had sailed from Pasajes with despatches for Île de France. The next day &quot;Mouche № 26&quot; foundered near the Penmarks. Fleury, presumably among others, was drowned.

Four months later, on 6 May &quot;Indefatigable&quot; captured two French chasse marees, &quot;Camilla&quot; and &quot;Bonne Rencontre&quot;; and were in company. Next, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; recaptured &quot;Flora&quot; on 13 June. On 20 October &quot;Indefatigable&quot; re-captured the Portuguese brig &quot;Intrigua&quot;.

On 15 January 1811, captured &quot;Matilda&quot; and her cargo. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and were in sight.

Then in June 1812, under Captain John Fyffe, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was on the South American station, where she visited the Galápagos Islands. During this cruise she gave the second largest island, now known as Santa Cruz island, its English name – Indefatigable.

By July &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was back in Portsmouth. When news of the outbreak of the War of 1812 reached Britain, the Royal Navy seized all American vessels then in British ports. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was among the Royal Navy vessels then lying at Spithead or Portsmouth and so entitled to share in the grant for the American ships &quot;Belleville&quot;, &quot;Janus&quot;, &quot;Aeos&quot;, &quot;Ganges&quot;, and &quot;Leonidas&quot; seized there on 31 July 1812.

On 17 September &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, , , , , and &quot;Cretan&quot; shared in the capture of &quot;Dankbarheide&quot;. When the gun-brig &quot;Hearty&quot; detained the Prussian vessel &quot;Friede&quot; on 29 September, &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, &quot;Desiree&quot;, &quot;Primrose&quot;, &quot;Cretan&quot;, &quot;Drake&quot;, were either in company or sharing by agreement.

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; was reported to have been at Lima on 11 July 1815, about to sail for the Galápagos Islands.

==Fate==
&quot;Indefatigable&quot; was finally paid off in 1815. She was broken up at Sheerness in August 1816.

==Legacy==
&quot;Indefatigable&quot; is the namesake of Indefatigable Island, the alternative English name of Santa Cruz Island in the Galapagos Archipelago.

<text>Abu Ja&#x27;far al-Mansur ibn al-Faḍl al-Mustarshid bi&#x27;llah (; 1109 – 6 June 1138) usually known by his regnal name Al-Rashid bi&#x27;llah () was the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad from 1135 to 1136. He succeeded his father al-Mustarshid in the year 1135. He ruled for just one year from 1135 up to his deposition on 17 August 1136 when the populace of Baghdad rose in revolt against him.

== Biography ==
Al-Rashid bi&#x27;llah was the son of caliph Al-Mustarshid and his mother was one of Al-Mustarshid&#x27;s concubines was called Khushf. She was from Iraq, and was the mother of his son Mansur, the future Caliph Al-Rashid Billah. His full name was Mansur ibn al-Faḍl al-Mustarshid and his Kunya was &quot;Abu Jaʿfar&quot;. He was nominated as heir by his father al-Mustarshid. As a prince, he spend his life in magnificent city of Baghdad. His name was minted on coins of Baghdad also on Seljuq coins along with the Caliph. When his father was mysterious killed in 1135, he smoothly ascended to the throne.
Like his father, al-Mustarshid, al-Rashid made another failed attempt at independence (militarily) from Seljuk Turks. To avenge his father&#x27;s death, he insulted the envoy of sultan Ghiyath ad-Din Mas&#x27;ud who came to demand a heavy largess, incited the mob to plunder his palace, and then, supported by Zengi, who was equally hostile to the sultan because of the murder of Dubais ibn Sadaqah, set up a rival sultan. Mas&#x27;ud hastened to the rebellious capital and laid siege to it. Baghdad, well defended by the river and its canals, resisted the attack; but in the end the caliph and Zengi, hopeless of success, escaped to Mosul. The sultan&#x27;s power restored, a council was held, the caliph deposed, and his uncle al-Muqtafi was appointed as the new caliph.

Al-Rashid fled to Isfahan where he was assassinated by a team of four Nizari Ismailis (Assassins) in June 1138. This was celebrated in Alamut for a week.

== Death ==
Ar-Rashid was assassinated by a team of four Nizari Shia Ismailis (Assassins) in June 1138.

A Mausoleum was built on his last resting place known as Al-Rashid Mausoleum is a historical mausoleum in Isfahan city. It dates back to the &quot;Later Abbasid era of Seljuqs&quot; and is located on the northern bank of Zayanderud beside the Shahrestan bridge. This structure is the burial place of &quot;Al-Rashid&quot; the 30th Abbasid Caliph, who left his palace and fled from Baghdad to Isfahan, when Mahmud captured Baghdad. Two years later, Al-Rashid was stabbed and killed by Hashshashins in 1138. The only decorative element of the mausoleum is a stucco Kufic inscription.

<text>Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Mustazhir (; 9 April 1096 – 12 March 1160), better known by his regnal name al-Muqtafi li-Amr Allah (), was the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad from 1136 to 1160, succeeding his nephew al-Rashid, who had been forced to abdicate by the Seljuks. The continued disunion and contests between Seljuk Turks afforded al-Muqtafi opportunity of not only maintaining his authority in Baghdad, but also extending it throughout Iraq.

==Birth and background==
The future caliph al-Muqtafi was born on 9 April 1096 as Abu Abdallah Muhammad, the son of the Abbasid caliph al-Mustazhir (). His mother was Ashin, a slave girl from Syria. After his father&#x27;s death his half-brother al-Mustarshid succeeded him on 6 August 1118. Al-Mustarshid (r. 1118–1135) ruled for sixteen years as Caliph but the last three years of his reign were occupied with war against Seljuq sultan Mas&#x27;ud (his deputy). Not long after the siege of Damascus, al-Mustarshid launched a military campaign against Seljuk sultan Mas&#x27;ud, who had obtained the title in Baghdad in January 1133 by the caliph himself. The rival armies met near Hamadan. The caliph, deserted by his troops, was taken prisoner, and pardoned on the promising not to quit his palace. Left in the caliphal tent, however, in the sultan&#x27;s absence, he was found murdered while reading the Quran, as is supposed, by an emissary of the Assassins, who had no love for the caliph. Modern historians have suspected that Mas&#x27;ud instigated the murder although the two most important historians of the period Ibn al-Athir and Ibn al-Jawzi did not speculate on this matter. Physically, al-Mustarshid was a red-haired man with blue eyes and freckles.

Al-Mustarshid was succeeded by his son and heir apparent, Al-Rashid Billah on 29 August 1135. Like his father al-Mustarshid, al-Rashid Billah made another attempt of military independence (forming his own military) from the Seljuks. To avenge his father&#x27;s death, he insulted the envoy of sultan Ghiyath ad-Din Mas&#x27;ud who came to demand a heavy largess, incited the mob to plunder his palace, and then, supported by Zengi, who was equally hostile to the sultan because of the murder of Dubais ibn Sadaqah, set up a rival sultan. Mas&#x27;ud hastened to the rebellious capital and laid siege to it. Baghdad, well defended by the river and its canals, resisted the attack; but in the end the caliph and Zengi, hopeless of success, escaped to Mosul. The sultan&#x27;s power restored, a council was held, the caliph deposed, and his uncle al-Muqtafi succeeded as the new caliph. Al-Rashid Bi&#x27;llah fled to Isfahan where he was assassinated by a team of four Nizari Ismailis (Assassins) in June 1138. This was celebrated in Alamut for a week.

== Reign ==
Al-Muqtafi was proclaimed caliph on 17 September 1136. He was able to use the infighting of the Seljuks to safeguard his own control over Baghdad, and even gradually extend his rule over much of Iraq. 

In 1148, he successfully fought off a group of Seljuk generals who rebelled against Sultan Mas&#x27;ud and marched on Baghdad. According to some sources, a similar attempt followed in the next year, and was likewise defeated by the caliph&#x27;s troops. Following the death of Mas&#x27;ud in October 1152, and the ensuing contest for the sultanate among the Seljuks, al-Muqtafi played an active role. In the months after Mas&#x27;ud&#x27;s death, he seized Wasit and al-Hilla. In the Seljuk succession struggle, he supported Mas&#x27;ud&#x27;s brother, Suleiman-Shah, against Mas&#x27;ud&#x27;s nephew, Muhammad II, extracting from the former a pledge not to interfere in Iraq. 

After Muhammad defeated Suleiman-Shah, however, the Seljuks marched on Baghdad and forced the caliph to take refuge in the eastern quarter, initiating the Seljuk siege of Baghdad of 1157. The siege was eventually abandoned as Muhammad faced the rebellion of Malik-Shah III in Hamadan, and over time al-Muqtafi restored good relations with Muhammad. During his last years, al-Muqtafi attacked Tikrit twice in vain, but captured the town of Lihf.

Awn al-Din ibn Hubayra was appointed as the vizier of the Caliph, a post he kept for sixteen years until his death on 27 March 1165, commonly attributed to poisoning through his physician, who was in the pay of his rivals.

During his caliphate, the Crusades were raging and Zengi, the atabeg of Mosul and founder of Zengid dynasty, obtained high distinction as a brave and generous warrior. At one time hard pressed, Zengi made urgent appeal for help to Baghdad. The sultan and the caliph dispatched 20,000 men in response. But in reality neither the Seljuks, nor the caliph, nor their emirs, had any enthusiasm for war against the Crusaders.

Al-Muqtafi is praised by contemporary Muslim historians as virtuous, capable and brave. During his caliphate of twenty-five years, he conducted many minor expeditions against enemies throughout Iraq and Syria.

A charter of protection granted by al-Muqtafi in 1139 to the Nestorian patriarch Abdisho III was published in 1926 by the Assyrian scholar Alphonse Mingana.

==Family==
One of his wives was Fatimah Khatun, the daughter of Sultan Muhammad I Tapar and his wife Nistandar Jahan. They married in 1137. She died in September 1147. One of his concubines was Thawus, a Greek. She was the mother of Al-Mustanjid, who became his successor. Another concubine was Umm Abu Ali. She was the mother of his son Abu Ali. She wanted her own son to succeed and after her husband&#x27;s death in 1160, She gained over many amirs to her side, and had their slave-girls armed with daggers to kill the new caliph. Al-Mustanjid discovered the plot and placed the rebel son and mother in prison.

One of his daughters was Zubaydah. She was the wife of sultan Ghiyath ad-Din Mas&#x27;ud. They married in 1140. Her dowry was one hundred thousand dinars. The wedding procession was delayed for five years because of her young age. However, the marriage was never consummated because of Masud&#x27;s ultimate death in 1152. Another daughter was Kerman Khatun. She was wife of sultan Muhammad II. They married towards the end of 1158 or in early 1159. He was, however, unable to consummate the marriage owing to his illness. After his death, she married Arslan-Shah in November 1160.

==Death==
Al-Muqtafi died on 12 March 1160 at the age 64. He was succeeded by his son Yusuf better known by his regnal name al-Mustanjid. He was born in 1124, and assumed the throne at the age of 36 after the death of his father al-Muqtafi.

<doc id="1091280" wikidata="Q909220" url="?curid=1091280" title="Palmerston, New Zealand">
<text>Palmerston is a town in Otago in the South Island of New Zealand. Located 50 kilometres to the north of the city of Dunedin, it is the largest town in the Waihemo Ward of the Waitaki District, with a population of 890 residents. Palmerston grew at a major road junction: State Highway 1 links Dunedin and Waikouaiti to the south with Oamaru and Christchurch to the north, while State Highway 85 (known colloquially as &quot;The Pigroot&quot;) heads inland to become the principal highway of the Maniototo. The Main South Line railway passes through the town and the Seasider tourist train travels from Dunedin to Palmerston and back once or twice a week. From 1880 until 1989, the town acted as the junction between the main line and a branch line that ran inland, the Dunback and Makareao Branches.

Palmerston stands near the banks of the Waihemo / Shag River, five kilometres inland from the Pacific coast. Between it and the sea stands the lone hill of Puketapu (Māori for &quot;sacred hill&quot;, known by Southerners as Holy Hill), crowned with a monument to the 19th century Otago politician Sir John McKenzie. An annual race takes place up to the memorial and back, which is called the Kelly&#x27;s canter, dedicated to Albert Kelly who ran up Puketapu as a constable in the Palmerston police force every day during World War II. This cairn is the second around Palmerston dedicated to MacKenzie – an earlier cairn was built on a hill to the north of the town, near Shag Point, but collapsed owing to the unstable geology of the site.

Many people confuse the town of Palmerston with the much more populous North Island city of Palmerston North, whose residents often call their home simply &quot;Palmerston&quot;. As a result, Palmerston is sometimes called &quot;Palmerston South&quot; to disambiguate the two towns. Otago&#x27;s town has the earlier claim to the name, however – its surveying dates from 1862, whereas the northern city did not receive its name until 1871. Both towns take their names from Lord Palmerston, the 19th-century British Prime Minister.

The nearby Shag River is named for the cormorant, a sea bird that ventures a little inland, colloquially known as a &#x27;shag&#x27;. The river&#x27;s Māori name, &#x27;Waihemo&#x27;, has been translated as &#x27;Dwindle River&#x27;. It is thought to arise from the river&#x27;s tendency to reduce in summer to a small stream. Palmerston used to be the capital of the Waihemo County, the surrounding district, before it was amalgamated with the Waitaki District in 1989.

==History and legend==
The area is rich in history and legend. Modern archaeology favours a date for the first settlement of New Zealand by Polynesian people about 1150 AD when population was concentrated on the east coast of the South Island. There is a substantial early settlement site of the Archaic or moa hunter phase of Māori culture near Palmerston on the sea coast at the mouth of the Shag River. It has been known to Europeans since the 1840s and was investigated from an early time by archaeologists. In 1987 and 1989 it was very thoroughly re-excavated by a team including Professor Atholl Anderson. It was determined it had been in permanent, year round occupation &#x27;for a period of perhaps 20–50 years in the 14th century AD&#x27;. (Anderson and others, 1996, p. 67.)

The area is also the traditional site of the wreck of the Arai Te Uru canoe. There are several versions of the tradition but they tell of the arrival of Rākaihautū from the ancestral homeland Hawaiki who met the Kahui Tipua people who were already here. He showed them kumara, or sweet potatoes, and they built canoes including Arai Te Uru to go to Hawaiki and bring back this new and valuable food. However, on its return the vessel became waterlogged off the Waitaki River mouth. It spilled food baskets on Moeraki and Katiki beaches and was wrecked at Shag Point / Matakaea, where it turned into what is now called Danger Reef. Its steersman, Hipo, sits erect at the stern. After this the crew explored the southern South Island giving many place names. Kahui Tipua are &#x27;ghost or giant people&#x27; with mythic or magical attributes, although they are also the real ancestors of people living now. (Anderson, 1983, p. 7.) If the explorers did not get back before dawn they turned into hills and other natural features. One of them was a woman Puketapu who got as far south as Owaka in South Otago. When she got back to the Waihemo Valley dawn broke and she was turned into the hill Puketapu overlooking Palmerston.

The story is seen as an allegorical explanation of the fact that kūmara does not grow south of Banks Peninsula. Arai Te Uru is an ancestral canoe of the Kāti Māmoe people who came to the south before Kāi Tahu (Ngāi Tahu in modern standard Māori) but were preceded by earlier peoples. The Arai Te Uru tradition reflects this with its reference to the preceding Kahui Tipua. It is tempting to identify the occupants of the river mouth archaeological site with the people of Arai Te Uru but that can only be speculation.


In 1814 an open boat from the &quot;Matilda&quot;, Captain Fowler, under the first mate Robert Brown, with two other Europeans and five lascars, or Indian seamen, came up the east coast past Palmerston and camped for the night ashore north of Moeraki. They were seen and attacked by Māori because of a feud started four years earlier by the theft of a shirt. According to the Creed manuscript, discovered in 2003, two men &#x27;escaped through the darkness of the night &amp; fled as far as Goodwood Bobby&#x27;s Head&#x27; a little south of Palmerston on the coast. They were two days and nights on the way and the Māori people there fed them. However &#x27;30 Natives went to the place &amp; massacred them – eat them.&#x27; One of the Europeans put up a grim struggle and the mere or club which dispatched him was long remembered. There was a dispute about killing these men after they had been entertained but those bent on vengeance prevailed.

In May 1826 Thomas Shepherd, (1779–1835), passing this coast in the &quot;Rosanna&quot;, made a sketch of it which still survives in the Mitchell Library, Sydney.

There were European visitors in the 1840s, such as Edward Shortland. Charles Suisted took up land in the area in the 1850s and Palmerston came into existence as a camp site in 1862 as the beginning of a route by the Shag Valley to the Central Otago gold diggings. It was surveyed and named in 1864. There is a handsome Presbyterian Church made of a local sandstone, designed by David Ross in 1876. A marble statue of Zealandia by Carlo Bergamini in the centre of the town is a Boer War memorial.

A few kilometres inland, at the Shag Valley Station, Frank Bell made the first New Zealand to England radio contact on 18 October 1924, an event which attracted international media attention as the first round-the-world radio broadcast.

<text>Abu al-Muẓaffar Yusuf ibn Muhammad al-Muqtafi (; 1124 – 20 December 1170) better known by his regnal name al-Mustanjid bi-llah () was the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad from 1160 to 1170. He was the son of previous Caliph al-Muqtafi.

== Biography ==
Al-Mustanjid was born in 1124. He was the son of caliph al-Muqtafi and his mother was an Umm walad named Thawus. His full name was Yusuf ibn Muhammad al-Muqtafi and his Kunya was &quot;Abu al-Muzaffar&quot;. When Yusuf was a young prince his father became Caliph in 1136. His father ruled for almost twenty-four years until his death in 1160. When his father died, he ascended to the throne. He continued the policies of his father and he also confirmed Awn al-Din ibn Hubayra as his vizier. Awn al-Din had previously served as the vizier to his father. Awn al-Din&#x27;s Tenure marked the final decline of the Seljuq influence in the Abbasid court (cf. Abbasid–Seljuk war), and saw a flowering of Hanbali learning in Baghdad. Ibn Hubayra was also involved in the conquest of Fatimid Egypt by Nur ad-Din Zangi.

One of al-Muqtafi&#x27;s wives, al-Mustanjid&#x27;s stepmother, wanted her own son to succeed. She gained over many amirs to her side, and had their slave-girls armed with daggers to kill the new caliph. Al-Mustanjid discovered the plot and placed the rebel son and mother in prison.

Around this time, Fatimid dynasty was at last extinguished, having lasted for 260 years. Their conqueror, Saladin, though himself an orthodox Muslim, initially didn&#x27;t proclaim the Sunni faith in the midst of a people still devoted to the tenets and practice of the Shi&#x27;a sect. But he soon found himself able to do so; and thus the spiritual supremacy of the Abbasids again prevailed, not only in Syria, but throughout Egypt and all its dependencies.

There is little else to say than that this caliph continued to occupy a more or less independent position, with a vizier and courtly surroundings, and supported by only a small force sufficient for an occasional local campaign.

<doc id="1091289" wikidata="Q293646" url="?curid=1091289" title="Al-Mustadi">
<text>Abu Muhammad Hasan ibn Yusuf al-Mustanjid (; 1142 – 27 March 1180) usually known by his regnal title al-Mustadi () was the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad from 1170 to 1180. He succeeded his father al-Mustanjid.

== Biography ==
Al-Mustadi was the son of caliph al-Mustanjid and his mother was Ghaddha, an Armenian concubine. He was born in 1142. His full name was Hasan ibn Yusuf al-Mustanjid and his Kunya was Abu Muhammad. He was named after 5th caliph al-Hasan. When his father al-Mustanjid died on 18 December 1170, he succeeded him.

Al-Mustadi&#x27;s reign is noted in general for its extensive building activities. He is said to have rebuilt al-Taj palace in Baghdad which was first constructed by 10th-century Abbasid caliph al-Muktafī (r. 902–908) and there was a great construction project of mosques, schools, religious endowments in his reign. His two spouses Sayyida Banafsha and Zumurrud Khatun, where especially prolific in these efforts. Banafsha was the follower of Hanbali school of thought, ordered the construction of a bridge in Baghdad in 570 AH/1174 CE, that was named after her.

Like his predecessor, he continued to occupy a more or less independent position, with a vizier and courtly surroundings, and supported by only a small force sufficient for an occasional local campaign. During his reign, Saladin ended the Shia Fatimid Caliphate, became the Sultan of Egypt and declared his allegiance to the Abbasids.

Towards the end of 1169, Saladin, with reinforcements from Nur ad-Din, defeated a massive Crusader-Byzantine force near Damietta. Afterward, in the spring of 1170, Nur ad-Din sent Saladin&#x27;s father to Egypt in compliance with Saladin&#x27;s request, as well as encouragement from the Baghdad-based Abbasid caliph, al-Mustanjid, who aimed to pressure Saladin in deposing his rival caliph, al-Adid. Saladin himself had been strengthening his hold on Egypt and widening his support base there. He began granting his family members high-ranking positions in the region; he ordered the construction of a college for the Maliki branch of Sunni Islam in the city, as well as one for the Shafi&#x27;i denomination to which he belonged in al-Fustat.

After establishing himself in Egypt, Saladin launched a campaign against the Crusaders, besieging Darum in 1170. Amalric withdrew his Templar garrison from Gaza to assist him in defending Darum, but Saladin evaded their force and captured Gaza in 1187. In 1191 Saladin destroyed the fortifications in Gaza build by King Baldwin III for the Knights Templar. It is unclear exactly when, but during that same year, he attacked and captured the Crusader castle of Eilat, built on an island off the head of the Gulf of Aqaba. It did not pose a threat to the passage of the Muslim navy but could harass smaller parties of Muslim ships and Saladin decided to clear it from his path.

According to Imad ad-Din, Nur ad-Din wrote to Saladin in June 1171, telling him to reestablish the Abbasid caliphate in Egypt, which Saladin coordinated two months later after additional encouragement by Najm ad-Din al-Khabushani, the Shafi&#x27;i &quot;faqih&quot;, who vehemently opposed Shia rule in the country. Several Egyptian emirs were thus killed, but al-Adid was told that they were killed for rebelling against him. He then fell ill or was poisoned according to one account. While ill, he asked Saladin to pay him a visit to request that he take care of his young children, but Saladin refused, fearing treachery against the Abbasids, and is said to have regretted his action after realizing what al-Adid had wanted. He died on 13 September, and five days later, the Abbasid &quot;khutba&quot; was pronounced in Cairo and al-Fustat, proclaiming al-Mustadi as caliph.

During the reign of the caliph, al-Mustadi, Ibn al-Jawzi began to be recognized &quot;as one of the most influential persons in Baghdad.&quot; As this particular ruler was especially partial to Hanbalism, Ibn al-Jawzi was given free rein to promote Hanbalism by way of his preaching throughout Baghdad. The numerous sermons Ibn al-Jawzi delivered from 1172 to 1173 cemented his reputation as the premier scholar in Baghdad at the time; indeed, the scholar soon began to be so appreciated for his gifts as an orator that al-Mustadi even went so far as to have a special dais (Arabic &quot;dikka&quot;) constructed specially for Ibn al-Jawzi in the Palace mosque. Ibn al-Jawzi&#x27;s stature as a scholar only continued to grow in the following years.

By 1179, Ibn al-Jawzi had written over one hundred and fifty works and was directing five colleges in Baghdad simultaneously. It was at this time that he told al-Mustadi to engrave an inscription onto the widely venerated tomb of Ibn Hanbal (d. 855) – the revered founder of the Hanbali rite – which referred to the famed jurist as &quot;&quot;Imām&quot;.&quot;

Benjamin of Tudela, who traveled to this area between 1160 and 1173, noted: &quot;Two days from Akbara stands Baghdad. The large metropolis of Calif Emir-al-Mumenin al Abassi Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin, of the family of their prophet, who is chief of the Mahometan religion. All Mahometan kings acknowledge him, and he holds the same dignity over them which the Pope enjoys over the Christians. The palace of the Caliph at Baghdad is three miles in extent. It contains a large park filled with all sorts of trees, both useful and ornamental, and all kinds of beasts, as well as a pond of water carried thither from the river Tigris; and whenever the Caliph desires to enjoy himself and to sport and carouse, birds, beasts and fishes are prepared for him and for his courtiers, whom he invites to his palace. This great Abassid is extremely friendly towards the Jews, many of his officers being of that nation; he understands all languages, is well versed in Mosaic law, and reads and writes the Hebrew tongue. He enjoys nothing but what he earns by the labor of his own hands, and therefore manufactures coverlets, which he stamps with his seal, and which his officers sell in the public market...&quot;

In 1180, Caliph Al-Mustadi died and was succeeded by his son Al-Nasir.

==Family==
One of Al-Mustadi&#x27;s concubines was Zumurrud Khatun. She was a Turkish, and was the mother of the future Caliph Al-Nasir. She died in December 1202 – January 1203, or January–February 1203, and was buried in her own mausoleum in Sheikh Maarouf Cemetery. Another of his concubines was Al-Sayyida Banafsha. She was the daughter of Abdullah, a Greek, and was Al-Mustadi&#x27;s favourite concubine. She died on 27 December 1201, and was buried in the mausoleum of Zumurrud Khatun in Sheikh Maarouf Cemetery. Another concubine was Sharaf Khatun. She was a Turkish, and was the mother of Prince Abu Mansur Hashim. She died on 27 December 1211, and was buried in the Rusafah Cemetery. Some other concubines were Khtalj Khatun and al-Abbasah. Both of them were Turkish.

<text>Abū al-ʿAbbās Aḥmad ibn al-Hasan al-Mustaḍīʾ (), better known by his al-Nāṣir li-Dīn Allāh (; 6 August 1158 – 5 October 1225) or simply as al-Nasir, was the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad from 1180 until his death. His literally can mean &quot;The One who Gives Victory to the Religion of God&quot;. He continued the efforts of his grandfather al-Muqtafi in restoring the caliphate to its ancient dominant role and achieved a surprising amount of success as his army even conquered parts of Iran. According to the historian, Angelika Hartmann, al-Nasir was the last &quot;effective Abbasid&quot; caliph.

In addition to his military success al-Nasir built many monuments in Baghdad that are still standing such as Zumurrud Khatun Mosque and Mausoleum.

== Biography==
Al-Nasir was the son of Caliph al-Mustadi and a Turkish &quot;umm walad&quot; called &quot;Zumurrud&quot; (Emerald). His reign was unusual for the rise of the futuwwa groups in his reign, connected to Baghdad&#x27;s long-standing ayyarun. These urban social groups had long existed in Baghdad and elsewhere, and they were often involved in urban conflicts, especially sectarian riots. Al-Nasir made them into an instrument of his government, reorganizing them along Sufi lines and ideology.

In the early years of his caliphate, his goal was to crush the Seljuq power and replace it with his own. He incited rebellion against the Seljuq Sultan of Persia, Toghrul III. The Khwarezm Shah, Ala ad-Din Tekish, at his instigation, attacked the Seljuq forces, and defeated them in 1194; Toghrul was killed and his head exposed in the caliph&#x27;s palace. Tekish, recognized now as supreme ruler of the East, bestowed on the caliph certain provinces of Persia that had been held by the Seljuqs.

Al-Nasir&#x27;s mother &quot;Zumurrud&quot; died in December 1202–January 1203, or January–February 1203, and was buried in her own mausoleum in Sheikh Maarouf Cemetery. Her mausoleum is known as Zumurrud Khatun Mausoleum.

Al-Nasir sent his vizier to Tekish with some gifts, but the vizier irritated Tekish, who attacked the caliph&#x27;s troops and routed them. Thereafter hostile relations prevailed for many years. The Caliph assassinated a governor of Tekish by using an Ismaili emissary. Tekish responded by having the body of al-Nasir&#x27;s vizier, who died on a campaign against him, exhumed, and the head stuck up at Khwarizm. Irritated at this and other hostile acts, the Caliph retaliated by treating with indignity the pilgrims who came from the East under Khwarizm&#x27;s flag. But beyond such poor revenge, he was powerless for any open enmity.

Tekish&#x27;s son, Muhammad II (1200–1220), annoyed at the actions of the caliph, set up a Shi&#x27;a Caliph to paralyse al-Nasir&#x27;s spiritual power. Following up this act, he turned his army on Baghdad. In response, some medieval historians write that al-Nasir appealed to Genghis Khan, the rising Mongol chief, to check Muhammad&#x27;s progress. This point is controversial, but it is likely that the caliph had some contacts to the non-Muslims Mongols.

The caliph soon found Genghis Khan to be quite threatening. The steppes of Central Asia were set in motion by Genghis Khan, and his hordes put to flight the Khwarizm Shah, who died an exile in an island of the Caspian.

==Policies and events==
During the caliphate of al-Nasir several important political changes, incidents and developments took place. He also took part in them directly and sometimes indirectly.

===Events between 1187 and 1190===

In 1186 a conflict broke between sultan Toghrul III and Qizil Arslan. This conflict possibly prevented Toghrul III and Qizil Arslan from aiding Muhammad b. Bahram Shah, the last Seljuk Sultan of Kirman, who had been driven from Kirman by Oghuz rebels driven out from Khurasan in 1186

The rebel army consisted of the forces of the Amirs of Zenjan and Maragha, the retainers of both Kamal Ai-Aba, head of the Mamluks, and of Saif al-Din Rus, husband of Innach Khatun, while Toghrul himself received significant support from Turkmens, and their combined army forced Qizil Arslan to leave Hamadan after some clashes. Toghrul undertook two diplomatic ventures in 1187, he journeyed to Mazandaran to request aid from Bavandid Husam al-Daula Ardashir, and received troops from him, and Toghrul also sent messages to al-Nasir, asking him to restore the palace of the Seljuk Sultan in Baghdad for him, but the Caliph razed the palace and then sent aid to Qizil Arslan, who agreed to become the Caliph&#x27;s vassal. The Caliph sent an army numbering 15,000 under his vizier Jalal al-Din &#x27;Ubaidallah b. Yunus, which attacked Hamadan in 1188 without waiting for Qizil Arslan&#x27;s army to arrive, he was defeated and captured, Toghrul secured victory by charging the enemy center after his right wing was battered, but this was a Pyrrhic victory, as Toghrul&#x27;s army suffered grievous losses in the battle. The Sultan next tried to reform his administration and coordinate strategy with available resources, but his rash behavior regarding a dispute over the command of the army, led to the execution of Kamal Ai-Aba, Saifuddin Rus and several of the Sultan&#x27;s opponents, and the desertion of his allies.

Qizil Arslan had declared Sanjar b. Suleiman-Shah as the Seljuk Sultan of Iraq, and reinforced by troops sent by the Caliph now invaded Hamadan, Toghrul, unable to resist the invasion, first retreated to Isphahan, then to Urmia. He was joined by an army led by his brother in law Hasan Kipchiq, and Toghrul also tried to get help from the Ayyubids and the Caliph, even sent his infant son as hostage to Baghdad in a futile gesture. Toghrul invaded Azerbaijan and sacked the towns of Ushnu, Khoy, Urmiya and Salmas. Qizil Arslan reconciled with his nephews and defeated and captured Toghrul when he again invaded Azerbaijan in 1190. Qizli Arslan imprisoned Toghrul and his son Malik Shah in Kuhran fortress near Tabriz. Qizil Arslan, encouraged by the Caliph, soon declared himself Sultan, married Innach Khatun, his brother&#x27;s widow, and was poisoned by her in September, 1191. His nephews began to rule independently, and one of the Mamluks of Jahan Pahalvan, Mahmud Anas Oglu, freed Toghrul III from his prison in May 1192.

===Events of 1192–1194===
Toghrul eluded the pursuers sent by Abu Bakr and quickly assembled an army from his supporters and Turkmens, then marched east and defeated the army of Qutlugh Inanch Muhammad and Amir Amiran Umar near Qazvin on June 22, 1192, and won over a large part of the enemy soldiers after his victory. Qutlug-Inach and Amiran Omar then attacked Abu Bakr in Azerbaijan and was beaten, Aimiran Umar sought refuge with his father in law Shirvanshah Akhsitan I (1160-1196), while Qutlug-Inach moved to Rey. Toghrul occupied Hamadan, secured the treasury and came to rule over Isphahan and Jibal, but did not attempt to negotiate an agreement with Abu Bakr, against Qutlug Innach. Qutlugh Innach now appealed to Khwarazmshah Ala ad-Din Tekish for aid, and Tekish invaded and captured Rey in 1192, forcing Qutlug Innach to flee the city.

===Toghrul&#x27;s Truce with Tekish===
Sultan Toghrul III opened negotiations with Tekish, and eventually agreed to become a vassal of Khwarizm, marriage of his daughter The Tekish&#x27;s son Yunus Khan, and in return Tekish kept Rey, garrisoned his newly acquired territory, collected taxes, then installed Tamghach as the governor, and returned home to quell the rebellion of his brother Sultan Shah. Toghrul now had the chance to negotiate with the Atabeg of Yazd, Langar ibn Wardanruz, or the Salghurid ruler of Fars, Degle ibn Zangi, both were nominally loyal to the Seljuks but no initiatives were taken to unite against their common enemy.

===Breaking of Truce and War declaration of Tekish and al-Nasir===
Toghrul felt threatened with the presence of a hostile force in Rey, which was a strategic town commanding communication with Jibal and Azerbaijan was unacceptable to the Sultan. The Sultan marched towards Rey with his available forces in March 1193, defeated and killed Tamghach, captured Rey and drove out the Khrarizmian forces from the province. Toghrul III next married Innach Khatun, mother of Qutlug Innach and Amirin Umar, as part of the peace agreement on her request, however, she was executed after the discovery of a plot to poison the Sultan. The Sultan returned to Hamadan, Qutlug Innach fled to Zanjan, from where he sent messages to Tekish, and al-Nasir also asked the Tekish to move against Toghrul. Toghrul again moved east in 1194 and defeated Qutlug Innach in battle despite the presence of 7,000 Khwarazmian troops aiding Qutlug Innach. Qutlug Innach and other survivors moved east and joined up with the main Khwarizmian army led by Shah Tekish at Semnan.

Tughril was defeated in the battle of Ray by Tekish with the help of al-Nasir. Ala ad-Din Tekish sent Toghrul&#x27;s head to al-Nasir who displayed it at the Nubi Gate in front of his palace, while his body was hanged at Rey.
===His Rejection of Khwarezmid&#x27;s claim===
By 1217, Muhammad had conquered all the lands from the river Jaxartes to the Gulf. He declared himself shah and demanded formal recognition from the caliph. When the caliph al-Nasir rejected his claim, Ala ad-Din Muhammad gathered an army and marched towards Baghdad to depose al-Nasir. However, when crossing the Zagros Mountains, the shah&#x27;s army was caught in a blizzard. Thousands of warriors died. With the army decimated, the generals had no choice but to return home.

==Death==
Al-Nasir spent his last three years paralysed and nearly blind. He suffered from dysentery for twenty days and then died.
He was succeeded by his son al-Zahir in the year 1225 as the thirty-fifth Abbasid caliph. His son ruled for a short period, al-Zahir lowered the taxes, and built a strong army to resist invasions. He died on 10 July 1226, nine months after his accession. He was succeeded his son (al-Nasir&#x27;s grandson) al-Mustansir.

<doc id="1091294" wikidata="Q366452" url="?curid=1091294" title="Jeff Hostetler">
<text>William Jeffrey Hostetler (born April 22, 1961) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants, Los Angeles/Oakland Raiders, and Washington Redskins. He won Super Bowl XXV with the Giants after taking over midseason for an injured Phil Simms. His nickname is &quot;Hoss.&quot;

==College career==

===Penn State===
Hostetler started his career at Penn State, where he started three games for the 1980 season. But Todd Blackledge soon beat him out for the starting quarterback job, and Hostetler transferred to West Virginia. Hostetler sat out the 1981 season, due to NCAA transfer rules.

===West Virginia===
Hostetler&#x27;s first game as a Mountaineer was a 41–27 win over the #9 1982 Oklahoma Sooners football team, when he threw for four touchdowns and 321 yards. The upset victory earned Hostetler Offensive Player of the Week honors from &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Another big win that season was a week later against the Maryland Terrapins, who were led by Boomer Esiason. The Mountaineers won 19–18 against the Top 10 ranked Terps. The Terps lost the game on a two-point conversion, while Hostetler threw for 285 yards and a touchdown. Hostetler led the Mountaineers to the 1982 Gator Bowl, where they lost to Florida State 31–12. Hostetler totaled 1,916 yards with ten touchdown passes that season.

In 1983, Hostetler led the #7 Mountaineers over Big East rival Pitt after a fourth quarter run to beat the Panthers 24–21, the first victory over Pitt in seven years. Hostetler led the game-winning drive that he capped out with a bootleg touchdown run for victory. In the 1983 Hall of Fame Bowl, Hostetler pulled out a come-from-behind 20–16 victory over the University of Kentucky, throwing two touchdowns. Hostetler finished his college career in the 1984 Hula Bowl and in the Japan Bowl. Hostetler threw for 2,345 yards and 16 touchdowns his senior season.

Hostetler was honored as a third-team All-American for 1983 by Gannett News Service.

Hostetler&#x27;s two-year tenure at WVU led him to an 18–6 record under coach Don Nehlen. Hostetler ranks among single-season leaders at WVU in total offense, passing yards, pass completions, pass attempts, touchdown passes and passing efficiency. Hostetler also is the career leader in interception avoidance. Hostetler was named to the WVU all-time roster. In 1998, Hostetler was inducted into the West Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.

Hostetler was named to the 1984 GTE/CoSIDA academic All-America team and that same year won the National Football Foundation postgraduate scholarship. He was also a fan favorite in Morgantown and inspired a record, &quot;Ole Hoss (The Ballad of West Virginia&#x27;s Jeff Hostetler)&quot;.

==Professional career==
===New York Giants===
Hostetler was drafted by the Giants in the third round of the 1984 NFL draft. In his first five seasons, he played sparingly, rarely making an appearance as he was the third-string quarterback behind Phil Simms and Jeff Rutledge. The first time he ever touched a football in a regular season game was in the 1986 season, when he blocked a punt in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles. His first start came late in the 1988 season, where he helped lead the Giants to victory in a road game against the New Orleans Saints. In 1989, he started a key game in the middle of the season, leading the Giants to a Monday night victory over the Minnesota Vikings. However, outside of these games, Hostetler&#x27;s primary roles were mop-up duty and as a holder for kickers Raul Allegre, Bjorn Nittmo, and Matt Bahr. In 2007, in the episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Game: The Super Bowl Champions&quot; that profiled the 1990 Giants team, Hostetler noted that he was frustrated with his lack of playing time and volunteered to play other positions, including wide receiver and blocker on the punt return team.

Hostetler finally seemed to reach his breaking point in December 1990. He had seen meaningful action in only one game that season, replacing Simms in the Giants&#x27; first game against the Phoenix Cardinals. Although he led the team to victory by engineering a late comeback with the team down 19–10 (they would win 20–19), Simms resumed his starting position the next week. Heading into Week 15 against the Buffalo Bills, Hostetler had decided that at the end of the season, he was retiring from the NFL and returning home. Something happened that week, however, that would eventually lead him to change his mind.

In the second half of the Buffalo game, which the Giants would go on to lose, Simms again went down with an injury. The Giants lost the game; Hostetler, speaking again to NFL Network, did not believe that Simms was hurt badly and figured that he was only a placeholder until Simms returned. As it turned out, Simms had suffered a severe foot injury and thus would be out for the remainder of the season, giving Hostetler his long-awaited opportunity. He led the Giants to two victories, a second win to secure a season sweep over the Cardinals and a surprisingly close victory over the team with the worst record in the league, the New England Patriots, and secured them a first-round bye with a 13–3 record. The Giants then beat the Chicago Bears in the divisional playoff.

In the NFC Championship against the San Francisco 49ers, Hostetler suffered a knee injury in the fourth quarter when Jim Burt, his former teammate, hit him low after Hostetler released the ball. Although he was injured, Hostetler was able to walk off the field on his own and later returned to the game and engineered two late scoring drives, that culminated with a Bahr field goal, and a 15–13 victory.

Hostetler started Super Bowl XXV; the Giants defeated the heavily favored Bills 20–19. He completed 20 of 32 passes for 222 yards with one touchdown. In 2008, ESPN ranked Hostetler&#x27;s performance the 30th best quarterback performance in Super Bowl history. After reconsidering his retirement, he elected to return for the 1991 season.

During the summer of 1991, new coach Ray Handley made a decision regarding his quarterbacks. Instead of giving the starting job back to the now-healthy Simms, the coach held an open competition that Hostetler would ultimately win. He then led the Giants to victory in the season opener against the 49ers at home, snapping their NFL-record 18 game road winning streak. In his twelfth start against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Hostetler broke his back and missed the rest of the season. Of the games Hostetler started (including the one he didn&#x27;t finish), the Giants went 7–5. Simms, meanwhile, lost his first three starts against the lowly Cincinnati Bengals (who won only three times that year), the Philadelphia Eagles (a loss which eliminated the Giants from playoff contention), and the eventual Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins. The Giants managed to win their final matchup against the Houston Oilers to finish 8–8.

When the 1992 season began, Hostetler was again the backup as Simms managed to regain the starter&#x27;s spot. However, the veteran&#x27;s proneness to injury again caught up with him, and in Week 4, Simms suffered a severe elbow injury that ended up costing him the rest of the season. Hostetler was once again given the helm but he also had injury issues, including suffering a concussion. He missed three games after resuming his starting position but finished with five victories in his nine starts, including three wins against winning teams. Despite that, he only managed to throw for eight touchdowns, and the Giants, who went through four quarterbacks that season, finished 6–10.

After the 1992 season, Ray Handley was fired, and former Denver Broncos coach Dan Reeves was hired as his replacement. Simms would be named the starter and Hostetler&#x27;s contract was not renewed for 1993.

===Los Angeles / Oakland Raiders===

In the 1993 offseason, Hostetler moved west and signed a contract with the Los Angeles Raiders. He would become their starter and once again found success as the Raiders finished with a 10–6 record and made the playoffs as a wild card.

Following the 1993 regular season, Hostetler led the Raiders to an impressive 42–24 playoff win over the Denver Broncos. The veteran quarterback threw for 294 yards and three touchdowns in what would be the last NFL playoff game played in Los Angeles until the 2017 season, when the LA Rams hosted the Atlanta Falcons in the wild card round.

In 1994, Hostetler was voted to his only career Pro Bowl after leading the Raiders to a 9–7 record. With the Raiders back in Oakland for the 1995 campaign, Hostetler got his team off to an impressive 8–2 record. However, a shoulder injury kept him out for all but the final game of the season. The Raiders lost their final six games and finished 8–8.

Hostetler&#x27;s final year in Oakland saw him reach a career high in touchdown passes with 23, as he started thirteen games and finished with a 7–6 record. Once again, however, the Raiders missed the playoffs and at the end of the season, Hostetler was again out of work as the Raiders did not offer him a contract.

===Washington Redskins===
The 36-year old Hostetler signed a contract with the Washington Redskins for 1997, with the team signing him as a backup for their fourth-year starter Gus Frerotte.

Late in the 1997 season, Hostetler returned to the starting lineup after an odd series of events. During a late season Sunday night matchup against Hostetler&#x27;s former team the Giants, Frerotte scored what would prove to be the Redskins&#x27; only touchdown in a 7–7 tie. After he did so, Frerotte walked over to a padded concrete wall in the back of the end zone and headbutted it, causing a neck injury that ended his season. Hostetler finished the game and then started the remaining three, finishing with a 2–1 record. His loss came at the hands of his former team, as the Giants defeated the Redskins in the penultimate game of the season to win the NFC East championship.

Hostetler retired after the 1998 season, which he spent on injured reserve. He nearly came out of retirement in 1999 after a tryout with the St. Louis Rams where he would have backed up newly signed quarterback Trent Green, who supplanted both Hostetler and Frerotte as the starter in Washington in 1998. However, the Rams instead drafted Ohio State quarterback Joe Germaine in the 1999 NFL draft to serve as their third-stringer and elevating holdover Kurt Warner to second string; Warner would have been third string behind Hostetler had the latter signed with the Rams. It can be argued that the Rams not signing Hostetler helped kick-start The Greatest Show on Turf era due to Green&#x27;s injury in the subsequent preseason and Warner&#x27;s unexpected rise to stardom and eventual induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Hostetler finished with 1,357 of 2,338 completions for 16,430 yards and 94 touchdowns, with 71 interceptions. He also rushed for 1,391 yards and 17 touchdowns. Perhaps most impressive about Hostetler was his ability to perform very well in the post-season. In five playoff games, he completed 72 of 115 passes (62.6 percent) for 1,034 yards, seven touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 112.0 passer rating while going 4–1.

==Personal==
Hostetler now lives in Morgantown, West Virginia, and owns a construction company. Hostetler is a descendant of the Amish-Mennonite immigrant, Jacob Hochstetler, member of the Northkill Amish Settlement, the first identifiable Amish settlement in the United States. With his wife, Vicky (daughter of his college coach, Don Nehlen), he has three sons. Hostetler graduated with a 3.85 GPA and a degree in finance from West Virginia University. His nephew is Ryan Nehlen, who played wide receiver for the West Virginia Mountaineers.

Chris Cuomo of ABC News interviewed Hostetler as part of &quot;One Moment in Time: The Life of Whitney Houston&quot;, a two-hour special on ABC shortly after the 2012 death of singer Whitney Houston. In Super Bowl XXV, Houston performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, and Hostetler and Super Bowl XXV MVP Ottis Anderson reflected on Houston&#x27;s performance in that game.

He is the uncle of former Buffalo Bills tight-end Jonathan Stupar and former New York Giants linebacker Nate Stupar.

<text>Abū Nasr Muhammad ibn al-Nāsir (; 1175 – 11 July 1226), better known with his regnal name al-Ẓāhir bi-Amr Allāh (, ), was the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad from 1225 to 1226. He succeeded his father al-Nasir in the year 1225 as the thirty-fifth Abbasid Caliph.

==Biography==
Al-Zahir bi-Amr Allah was the son of al-Nasir and Asma Umm Muhammad. His full name was Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Nāsir and his Kunya was Abu Nasr. He was named as successor in 1189. In his short reign, he lowered the taxes, and built a strong army to resist invasions. He died on 10 July 1226, nine months after his accession.

==Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia==
When it became known that Genghis Khan was marching towards Khwarazm, Jalal al-Din proposed to his father to meet the Mongols in one decisive battle near the Syr Darya. However, Muhammad II relied on his well-fortified fortresses and did not assemble troops, distributing them instead among the major towns of his empire. Meanwhile, the Mongols swiftly took one city after another. At the beginning of 1220, Bukhara fell, followed by Samarqand. Muhammad started to retreat west, and after a series of unsuccessful battles, was left with a handful of soldiers and his sons. The huge and undisciplined Khwarazmian army was unable to defeat the enemy, which was much inferior in number.

Legend has it that Muhammad, who fled to the Caspian Sea, being terminally ill, gathered his sons: Jalal ad-Din, Aqshah, and Uzlagh Khan and announced that he appointed Jalal ad-Din as heir to the throne, because only he could confront the enemy. Summoning the younger sons to obedience, he hung his sword on the belt of Jalal ad-Din. A few days later, Muhammad died and Jalal ad-Din was proclaimed a Khwarazmshah.

Following the defeat of his father, Ala ad-Din Muhammad II by Genghis Khan in 1220, Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu came to power and retreated with the remaining Khwarazm forces, while pursued by a Mongol army and at the Battle of Parwan, north of Kabul, defeated the Mongols.

Due to the Mongol invasion, the sacking of Samarkand and being deserted by his Afghan allies, Jalal ad-Din was forced to flee to India. At the Indus River, however, the Mongols caught up with him and slaughtered his forces, along with thousands of refugees, at the Battle of the Indus. He escaped and sought asylum in the Sultanate of Delhi but Iltutmish denied this to him in deference to the relationship with the Abbasid caliphs. The cities of Herat, Ghazni and Merv were destroyed and massacred by the Mongols, for his resistance or rebelliousness.

==Family==
One of al-Zahir&#x27;s concubines was Hayat Khatun. She was of Turkish origin, a favored and trusted concubine, and the mother of one of his sons. She was manumitted upon his death and became 
a free woman. She died on 16 August 1241, and was buried in the mausoleum of the caliph al-Mustadi. Another of his concubines was Bab Jawhar. She was a Turkish slave who was also a favorite of al-Zahir. She died on 1 August 1241, and was buried near the caliphal tombs in the Rusafah Cemetery. Another of his concubines was a Turkish slave. She was the mother of the future Caliph al-Mustansir. Al-Zahir&#x27;s other notable son was Abu al-Qasim Ahmad.

==Succession== 
Al-Zahir was succeeded by al-Mustansir bi-llah.

<text>The live-ball era, also referred to as the lively ball era, is the period in Major League Baseball since 1920. It contrasts with the pre-1920 period known as the &quot;dead-ball era&quot;. The name &quot;live-ball era&quot; comes from the dramatic rise in offensive statistics, a direct result of a series of rule changes (introduced in 1920) that were colloquially said to have made the ball more &quot;lively&quot;. Upon entering the live-ball era, baseball regained relevance and exploded in popularity.

==Dead-ball era (pre-1920)==
Prior to the rule changes in 1920, the same ball would often be used throughout an entire game, only being replaced if it began to unravel. Pitchers were also allowed to deface or scuff the ball, apply foreign substances to it (such as dirt or spit), and cut into the ball with an emery board. Balls would not even be replaced after a foul ball or home run, with fans instead throwing the ball back onto the field to be re-used. As a result, the ball would become increasingly dirty and worn as the game progressed, making it difficult to see and making its movement erratic. Furthermore, the physical wear on the ball reduced its elasticity as the game progressed, making it increasingly difficult to hit for distance. These factors ultimately gave pitchers a major advantage over batters, resulting in low-scoring games.

There were also rules in force prior to 1920 that contributed to the low-scoring games. In 1901, the National League adopted the &quot;foul-strike rule,&quot; which counted foul balls as strikes. Before this rule, batters could safely swing at many marginal pitches, which not only tired out the pitcher but also allowed for more hits because a &quot;flukey&quot; hit could land in play. With the introduction of the foul-strike rule, the batter had to let many more pitches &quot;go&quot; without being swung on, dramatically reducing the total number of hits. The American League followed suit in 1903, making the rule universal.

==Rule changes==
Rather than change the construction of the balls, which remained consistent between the transition from the &quot;dead-&quot; to &quot;live-ball eras&quot;, rule changes were instituted around how the balls were treated. Starting in 1920, balls were replaced at the first sign of wear, resulting in a ball that was much brighter and easier for a hitter to see. Additionally, pitchers were no longer allowed to deface, scuff, or apply foreign substances to the ball, but 17 pitchers who mostly threw the spitball were allowed to throw it until they retired. The last one to legally throw it was Burleigh Grimes on September 20, 1934.

===Impact of 1920 rule changes===

The impact of the rule changes was felt almost immediately. In 1920, the game changed from typically low-scoring to high-scoring games, with a newfound reliance on the home run. That year, Babe Ruth set a record for slugging percentage and hit 54 home runs (smashing his old record of 29). Aiding in Ruth&#x27;s success was that he held the bat lower and swung with an uppercut, essentially trying to hit home runs. His 54 home runs in 1920 were a total greater than 14 of the other 15 teams at the time, and it nearly tripled fellow slugger George Sisler&#x27;s second-highest total of 19 that season. Seeing his success (and his popularity that followed), young players who debuted in the 1920s, including Lou Gehrig and Mel Ott, followed Ruth&#x27;s example. The home run has been a significant part of baseball since. Ruth broke his own record in 1921, hitting 59 home runs; six years later, he passed his own mark once again by hitting 60 home runs, a single-season record that stood for 34 years.

While the rule changes instituted in 1920 were a major factor in the increased scoring and number of home runs seen in Major League Baseball, established sluggers who had been successful prior to 1920 (including Sisler, Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker) were able to maintain their previous successful hitting styles into the 1920s. Such success is attributed to Sisler (and others) choking up on the bat, resulting in fewer strikeouts and more doubles. In 1920, George Sisler also set his long-standing record of 257 hits in a single season, which would not be eclipsed until 84 years later in 2004 when the Seattle Mariners&#x27; Ichiro Suzuki hit 262.

The live-ball era also had a lasting impact on pitchers. Between 1910 and 1920, the last decade of the dead-ball era, eight pitchers had 30-win seasons. Since the beginning of the 1921 season, the first full season of the live-ball era, only three pitchers have had 30-win seasons: Lefty Grove in 1931; Dizzy Dean in 1934; and Denny McLain in 1968.

<text>Abu Ahmad Abdallah ibn al-Mustansir bi&#x27;llah (), better known by his regnal title Al-Mustaʿṣim bi-llāh (; 1213 – 20 February 1258), was the 37th and last caliph from the Abbasid dynasty ruling from Baghdad. He held the title from 1242 until his death in 1258.

==Biography==
Abu Ahmad Abdallah (future caliph Al-Musta&#x27;sim) was a son of the Abbasid caliph al-Mustansir, and his mother was Hajir. He was born in 1213. After the death of his father, al-Musta&#x27;sim succeeded to the throne in late 1242.

He is noted for his opposition to the rise of Shajar al-Durr to the Egyptian throne during the Seventh Crusade. He sent a message from Baghdad to the Mamluks in Egypt that said: &quot;If you do not have men there tell us so we can send you men.&quot; However, al-Musta&#x27;sim had to face the greatest menace against the caliphate since its establishment in 632: the invasion of the Mongol forces that, under Hulagu Khan, had already wiped out any resistance in Transoxiana and Khorasan. Shortly thereafter, in 1255-1256, Hulagu Khan forced the Abbasid Caliphate to lend him their forces for his campaign against the Alamut region in modern-day Iran.

News of the murder of al-Muazzam Turanshah and the inauguration of Shajar al-Durr as the new sultan reached Syria. The Syrian emirs were asked to pay homage to Shajar al-Durr but they refused and the Sultan&#x27;s deputy in Al Karak rebelled against Cairo. The Syrian emirs in Damascus gave the city to an-Nasir Yusuf, the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo, and the Mamluks in Cairo responded by arresting the emirs who were loyal to the Ayyubids in Egypt. In addition to the Ayyubids in Syria, the Abbasid caliph al-Musta&#x27;sim in Baghdad also rejected the Mamluk move in Egypt and refused to recognize Shajar al-Dur as a sultan. The refusal of the Caliph to recognize Shajar al-Durr as the new sultan was a great setback to the Mamluks in Egypt, as the custom during the Ayyubid era was that the Sultan could gain legitimacy only through the recognition of the Abbasid caliph.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shayyal, p.115/vol.2&quot;&gt;Shayyal, p. 115, vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Mamluks, therefore, decided to install Izz al-Din Aybak as a new sultan. He married Shajar al-Durr, who abdicated and passed the throne to him after she had ruled Egypt as sultan for about three months. Though the period of Shajar al-Durr&#x27;s rule as a sultan was of short duration, it witnessed two important events in history: the expelling of Louis IX from Egypt, which marked the end of the Crusaders&#x27; ambition to conquer the southern Mediterranean basin; and the death of the Ayyubid dynasty and the birth of the Mamluk state which would dominate the southern Mediterranean for decades.

To please the Caliph and secure his recognition, Aybak announced that he was merely a representative of the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad. To placate the Ayyubids in Syria, the Mamluks nominated an Ayyubid child named al-Sharaf Musa as a co-sultan. But this did not satisfy the Ayyubids, and armed conflict between the Mamluks and the Ayyubids broke out. The Caliph in Baghdad, preoccupied with the Mongols who were raiding territories not far from his capital, preferred to see the matter settled peacefully between the Mamluks and the Ayyubids. Through the negotiation and mediation of the Caliph that followed the bloody conflict, the militarily superior Mamluks reached an agreement with the Ayyubids that gave them control over southern Palestine, including Gaza, Jerusalem and the Syrian coast. By this agreement, the Mamluks not only added new territories but also gained recognition for their rule.
In 1258, Hulagu invaded the Abbasid domain, which then consisted of only Baghdad, its immediate surroundings, and southern Iraq. In his campaign to conquer Baghdad, Hulagu Khan had several columns advance simultaneously on the city, and laid siege to it. The Mongols kept the people of Abbasid Caliphate in their capital and executed those who tried to flee.

Baghdad was sacked on 10 February and the caliph was killed by Hulagu Khan soon afterward. It is reckoned that the Mongols did not want to shed &quot;royal blood&quot;, so they wrapped him in a rug and trampled him to death with their horses. Some of his sons were massacred as well. One of the surviving sons was sent as a prisoner to Mongolia, where Mongolian historians report he married and fathered children, but played no role in Islam thereafter.

&quot;The Travels of Marco Polo&quot; reports that upon finding the caliph&#x27;s great stores of treasure which could have been spent on the defense of his realm, Hulagu Khan locked him in his treasure room without food or water, telling him &quot;eat of thy treasure as much as thou wilt, since thou art so fond of it.&quot;

==Siege of Baghdad==
Hulagu sent word to al-Musta&#x27;sim, demanding his acquiescence to the terms imposed by Möngke. Al-Musta&#x27;sim refused, in large part due to the influence of his advisor and grand vizier, Ibn al-Alkami. Historians have ascribed various motives to Ibn al-Alkami&#x27;s opposition to submission, including treachery and incompetence, and it appears that he lied to the caliph about the severity of the invasion, assuring al-Musta&#x27;sim that, if the capital of the caliphate was endangered by a Mongol army, the Islamic world would rush to its aid.

Although he replied to Hulagu&#x27;s demands in a manner that the Mongol commander found menacing and offensive enough to break off further negotiation, al-Musta&#x27;sim neglected to summon armies to reinforce the troops at his disposal in Baghdad. Nor did he strengthen the city&#x27;s walls. By 11 January, the Mongols were close to the city, establishing themselves on both banks of the Tigris River so as to form a pincer around the city. Al-Musta&#x27;sim finally decided to do battle with them and sent out a force of 20,000 cavalry to attack the Mongols. The cavalry were decisively defeated by the Mongols, whose sappers breached dikes along the Tigris River and flooded the ground behind the Abbasid forces, trapping them.

===Siege===
The Abbasid Caliphate could supposedly call upon 50,000 soldiers for the defense of their capital, including the 20,000 cavalry under al-Musta&#x27;sim. However, these troops were assembled hastily, making them poorly equipped and disciplined. Although the caliph technically had the authority to summon soldiers from other sultanates (caliphate&#x27;s deputy states) to defence, he neglected to do so. His taunting opposition had lost him the loyalty of the Mamluks, and the Syrian emirs, whom he supported, were busy preparing their own defenses.

On 29 January, the Mongol army began its siege of Baghdad, constructing a palisade and a ditch around the city. Employing siege engines and catapults, the Mongols attempted to breach the city&#x27;s walls, and, by 5 February, had seized a significant portion of the defenses. Realizing that his forces had little chance of retaking the walls, al-Musta&#x27;sim attempted to open negotiations with Hulagu, who rebuffed the caliph. Around 3,000 of Baghdad&#x27;s notables also tried to negotiate with Hulagu but were murdered.

Five days later, on 10 February, the city surrendered, but the Mongols did not enter the city until the 13th, beginning a week of massacre and destruction.

===Destruction and massacre===
Many historical accounts detailed the cruelties of the Mongol conquerors. Contemporary accounts state Mongol soldiers looted and then destroyed mosques, palaces, libraries, and hospitals. Priceless books from Baghdad&#x27;s thirty-six public libraries were torn apart, the looters using their leather covers as sandals. Grand buildings that had been the work of generations were burned to the ground. The House of Wisdom (the Grand Library of Baghdad), containing countless precious historical documents and books on subjects ranging from medicine to astronomy, was destroyed. Claims have been made that the Tigris ran red from the blood of the scientists and philosophers killed. Citizens attempted to flee, but were intercepted by Mongol soldiers who spared no one, not even children. 

The caliph al-Musta&#x27;sim was captured and forced to watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury plundered. According to most accounts, the caliph was killed by trampling. The Mongols rolled the caliph up in a rug, and rode their horses over him, as they believed that the earth would be offended if it were touched by royal blood. All but one of al-Musta&#x27;sim&#x27;s sons were killed, and the sole surviving son was sent to Mongolia, where Mongolian historians report he married and fathered children, but played no role in Islam thereafter.

Hulagu had to move his camp upwind of the city, due to the stench of decay from the ruined city.

Baghdad was a depopulated, ruined city for several decades and only gradually recovered some of its former glory. The historian David Morgan has quoted Wassaf (who himself was born seven years after the razing of the city in 1265) describing the destruction: 

They swept through the city like hungry falcons attacking a flight of doves, or like raging wolves attacking sheep, with loose reins and shameless faces, murdering and spreading terror...beds and cushions made of gold and encrusted with jewels were cut to pieces with knives and torn to shreds. Those hiding behind the veils of the great Harem were dragged...through the streets and alleys, each of them becoming a plaything...as the population died at the hands of the invaders.
===Aftermath===
Hulagu left 3,000 Mongol soldiers behind to rebuild Baghdad. Ata-Malik Juvayni was later appointed governor of Baghdad, Lower Mesopotamia, and Khuzistan after Guo Kan went back to the Yuan dynasty to assist Kublai&#x27;s conquest over the Song dynasty. Hulagu&#x27;s Nestorian Christian wife, Dokuz Khatun, successfully interceded to spare the lives of Baghdad&#x27;s Christian inhabitants. Hulagu offered the royal palace to the Nestorian Catholicos Mar Makikha, and ordered a cathedral to be built for him.

Initially, the fall of Baghdad came as a shock to the whole Muslim world; after many years of utter devastation, the city became an economic center where international trade, the minting of coins and religious affairs flourished under the Ilkhans. The chief Mongol darughachi was thereafter stationed in the city.

Berke, who had converted to Islam in 1252, became enraged that Hulagu destroyed Baghdad. Muslim historian Rashid al Din quoted Berke Khan as sending the following message to Mongke Khan, protesting the attack on Baghdad, (not knowing Mongke had died in China): &quot;He [Hulagu] has sacked all the cities of the Muslims. With the help of God I will call him to account for so much innocent blood.&quot;

Although hesitant at first to go to war with Hulagu out of Mongol brotherhood, the economic situation of the Golden Horde led him to declare war against the Ilkhanate. This became known as the Berke–Hulagu war.

===Legacy===

Al-Musta&#x27;sim ruled from 5 December 1242 to 20 February 1258, a period of 15 years, 2 months and 15 days. His death marked the final end of the caliphate as a political and religious entity. The Mamluk Sultans of Egypt and Syria later appointed an Abbasid prince as caliph of Cairo, but these Mamluk Abbasid caliphs were marginalized and merely symbolic, with no temporal power and little religious influence. Even though they kept the title for about 250 years more, other than installing the Sultan in ceremonies, they were of little importance. After the Ottomans conquered Egypt in 1517, the caliph of Cairo, al-Mutawakkil III was transported to Constantinople.

<doc id="1091318" wikidata="Q3641229" url="?curid=1091318" title="Blurring the Edges">
<text>Blurring the Edges is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Meredith Brooks. It was released on May 6, 1997, by Capitol Records. Following the release of her self-titled debut studio album (1986) and her departure from the short-lived band the Graces, Brooks temporarily retired from the music industry. Uninterested in the cynicism of grunge music that reigned in the early nineties, Brooks became re-inspired to write music with a more positive message. Brooks co-wrote the album with her friend Shelly Peiken, with further songwriting contributions from Larry Dvoskin, Christopher Ward, Stan Lynch, John Corey, Kevin Dukes, and Tom DeLuca. Brooks enlisted David Ricketts to produce the effort, with Geza X helming production on a single song.

Music critics were divided in their opinions of &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot;. Some critics praised Brooks&#x27;s lyricism and hooks, while others believed that the album tread familiar grounds. Many critics also compared Brooks to her contemporaries, Alanis Morissette and Sheryl Crow. &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; was a commercial success. In the United States, the album peaked at number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album was also certified Gold in the United Kingdom and received a multi-platinum certification in Canada. &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; has sold over three million copies worldwide.

The album was supported by four singles. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Bitch,&quot; was an international commercial success, reaching the top twenty in 16 countries. The song was certified Gold in New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States, while receiving a Platinum certification in Australia. As a result of the song&#x27;s success, Brooks is often cited as a one-hit wonder. Follow-up singles &quot;What Would Happen&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot; achieved moderate commercial success in the United States, while &quot;I Need&quot; had little commercial impact. To further promote the album, Brooks made a variety of radio and television appearances, embarked on a month-long tour, and opened for the Rolling Stones on tour.

==Background==
In 1986, Brooks released her self-titled debut studio album; released exclusively in Europe, the album received minimal recognition. The following year, Brooks formed the pop rock band the Graces, alongside Charlotte Caffey and Gia Ciambotti, who experienced moderate success with their 1989 single &quot;Lay Down Your Arms&quot;. Disenchanted by the music industry due to the rise in success of the grunge genre, Brooks exited the group in 1991 and temporarily retired as a recording artist. Brooks explained: &quot;I was really bored with music, to a point, during the grunge period ... I wasn&#x27;t interested in being necessarily a part of that, and I wasn&#x27;t finding a lot of interest for what I was writing about.&quot; However, Brooks eventually became re-inspired to go against this prevailing trend in rock music and write songs with a more positive message. Brooks began writing music with her friend, Shelly Peiken, which resulted in a song titled &quot;Bitch&quot;. In 1995, Brooks signed to Capitol Records after her manager, Lori Leve, played &quot;Bitch&quot; for the record label&#x27;s vice president of A&amp;R, Perry Watts-Russell.

==Recording and production==
The entirety of the album—sans &quot;Bitch&quot;—was recorded at the Salt Mines and Alpha Studios in Hollywood and Burbank, respectively, and produced by David Ricketts. &quot;Bitch&quot; was recorded at City Lab Sound Design in Hollywood, whilst production on the track was helmed by Geza X. Influenced by guitarists such as Eric Clapton, Lindsey Buckingham, and James Honeyman-Scott, Brooks set out to play lead guitar throughout the entirety of the album. Brooks claimed that Chrissie Hynde was the album&#x27;s strongest influence and that she was fearful people would view &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; as an imitation of Hynde&#x27;s work. Brooks cited &quot;Pollyanne,&quot; a song about expressing positivity when faced with a cynical partner, as most illustrative of her mindset at the time of writing the album.

==Music and lyrics==
Brooks described the overall theme of the album as about resurrection. &quot;My Little Town&quot; was inspired by Brooks&#x27; experience growing up and moving away from her hometown of Corvallis, Oregon. &quot;Shatter&quot; has a theme of nonconformity, which was inspired by Brooks&#x27; efforts to create a record that aligns with her own vision and to not give in to pressures by music industry officials.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; was first released on May 6, 1997 in the United States. Promotion for the album began in April 1997, where Brooks performed across the country at small venues to introduce herself to new audiences. The vice president of marketing at Capitol Records, Steve Rosenblatt, explained: &quot;We&#x27;re going to send [Brooks] around the country and set up little events where it&#x27;ll just be Meredith and her music, where she can talk to people and talk about her songs, and then play her songs in a very intimate setting.&quot; To further promote the album, Brooks embarked on a month-long tour that commenced on August 3 in her hometown of Portland, Oregon. This tour included several stops at the Lilith Fair tour. A recorded performance of &quot;Wash My Hands&quot; was later included on the live album &quot;Lilith Fair: A Celebration of Women in Music&quot; (1998). In September 1997, Brooks opened for the MTV Video Music Awards through a webcast. This performance marked the first ever multi-camera webcast and was the first time MTV live streamed audio and video. In July 1997, Brooks paid promotional visits to the United Kingdom and Germany, with further performances throughout Europe in September. In 1998, Brooks was an opening act for the Rolling Stones on their Bridges to Babylon Tour. After playing two songs from her ten-song set, the crowd began to boo and threw bottles, batteries, and coins at her.

&quot;Wash My Hands&quot; was intended as the lead single from the album, before it was replaced with &quot;Bitch&quot;.

On January 20, 2023, an expanded edition of &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; was released in celebration of the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

==Critical reception==

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic compared Brooks to Alanis Morissette, stating that &quot;&quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad album -- Brooks is a competent melodicist and her lyrics are occasionally promising -- yet it isn&#x27;t a distinctive one.&quot; Steven Mirkin of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; similarly noted that the album touches on familiar material, specifically comparing it to Sheryl Crow&#x27;s &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club&quot; (1993). However, Mirkin went on to praise the album as &quot;leavened with hooks and humor and a refreshing, unself-conscious swagger.&quot; In a more critical review, Paul Verna of &quot;Billboard&quot; referred to Brooks as an Alanis Morissette imitator, commenting that &quot;[Brooks&#x27;] ample writing and performing talents are underserved by her tendency to follow rather than lead.&quot;

Mala Mortensa of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; noted &quot;Bitch&quot; as a highlight from the album. She further discussed the album&#x27;s influence, stating, &quot;[t]he alt-rock showcase was a stunning showcase of the &#x27;bad bitch&#x27; mentality that largely defines the alternative scene. No doubt, [Brooks&#x27;] fiery energy has inspired many aspiring women to date.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
In the United States, &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; debuted at number 25 on the US &quot;Billboard 200&quot; for the chart dated May 24, 1997. The album reached its peak position of number 22 the following week and ultimately spent 47 weeks on the chart, with its final appearance being on the chart dated April 11, 1998. On the year-end chart for 1997, &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; reached a position of number 83. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album Platinum, which denotes one million album-equivalent units.

Originally released in 1986 as Meredith Brooks by Ariola, the album was reissued on November 11, 1997, by Bizarre Planet Entertainment. The record label intended to capitalize on Brooks&#x27; newfound success following the release of her second album, &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; (1997).

<text>BL Lacertae or &quot;BL Lac&quot; is a highly variable, extragalactic active galactic nucleus (AGN or active galaxy). It was first discovered by Cuno Hoffmeister in 1929, but was originally thought to be an irregular variable star in the Milky Way galaxy and so was given a variable star designation. In 1968, the &quot;star&quot; was identified by John Schmitt at the David Dunlap Observatory as a bright, variable radio source. A faint trace of a host galaxy was also found. In 1974, Oke and Gunn measured the redshift of BL Lacertae as z = 0.07, corresponding to a recession velocity of 21,000 km/s with respect to the Milky Way. The redshift figure implies that the object lies at a distance of 900 million light years.
Due to its early discovery, BL Lacertae became the prototype and namesake of the class of active galactic nuclei known as &quot;BL Lacertae objects&quot; or &quot;BL Lac objects&quot;. This class is distinguished by rapid and high-amplitude brightness variations and by optical spectra devoid (or nearly devoid) of the broad emission lines characteristic of quasars. These characteristics are understood to result from relativistic beaming of emission from a jet of plasma ejected from the vicinity of a supermassive black hole. BL Lac objects are also categorized as a type of blazar.

BL Lacertae changes in apparent magnitude over fairly small time periods, typically between values of 14 and 17. In January 2021, it exhibited extreme flaring behavior and was reported to reach magnitude 11.45 in the R filter band.

<doc id="1091331" wikidata="Q730930" url="?curid=1091331" title="Deconstruction (Meredith Brooks album)">
<text>Deconstruction is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Meredith Brooks. It was released on September 28, 1999, by Capitol Records. Following the album&#x27;s disappointing commercial reception, Brooks was dropped from the record label.

==Recording==
Unlike her involvement with &quot;Meredith Brooks&quot; (1986) and &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot; (1997), Brooks sought to take more control over the compositions on &quot;Deconstruction&quot;. With the exception of &quot;Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)&quot;, Brooks wrote or co-wrote and played lead guitar on every song on the album, in addition to co-producing the album with David Darling. Thematically, Brooks claims that the material on &quot;Deconstruction&quot; was a direct reaction to her experiences with the success of &quot;Bitch&quot;. She explained: &quot;The new album is about deconstructing everything, letting people know that I&#x27;m not just any one thing.&quot;

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Deconstruction&quot; was released on September 28, 1999. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Brooks released rough mixes of several album tracks on her official website. There are two unreleased songs from these sessions titled Deconstruction and Strangely Erotic. Fans had the opportunity to vote for their favorite songs and discuss the then-upcoming album with Brooks on the site&#x27;s message board.

In an effort to promote the album, Brooks opened for the Eurythmics on their Peace Tour (1999).

Two singles were released from the album. The first was a cover version of Melanie&#x27;s &quot;Lay Down (Candles In The Rain)&quot;, which also featured Queen Latifah. 

The second single, &quot;Shout,&quot; was written by Brooks, and included references to pop culture events at the time, such as the scandal between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, as well as the Y2K scare. It was featured on the February 2000 in-store playlist at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.

==Critical reception==

Tom Demalon of AllMusic referred to the album as &quot;another pleasant if somewhat derivative helping of adult rock [from Brooks].&quot; Demalon highlighted &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Home&quot; and &quot;I Said&quot; as the standout tracks from the album. Beth Johnson of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; remarked that the album starts off strong with &quot;Shout,&quot; before delving into &quot;sound-alikes of Sheryl Crow, late-&#x27;90s Madonna, and (oh so annoyingly) Blondie&#x27;s rap.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
In the United States, &quot;Deconstruction&quot; was considered a commercial disappointment in comparison to Brooks&#x27; previous effort, &quot;Blurring the Edges&quot;. &quot;Deconstruction&quot; failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and the album only sold approximately 20,000 units over two months after release.

<doc id="1091333" wikidata="Q2275081" url="?curid=1091333" title="Paris When It Sizzles">
<text>Paris When It Sizzles is a 1964 American romantic comedy film directed by Richard Quine from a screenplay by George Axelrod, based on the 1952 French film &quot;Holiday for Henrietta&quot; by Julien Duvivier and Henri Jeanson. The film stars William Holden and Audrey Hepburn, with Grégoire Aslan, Raymond Bussières, Noël Coward, and Tony Curtis.

The film&#x27;s title derives from the Cole Porter song &quot;I Love Paris&quot;:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;&quot;I love Paris in the springtime&quot;
&quot;I love Paris in the fall&quot;
&quot;I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles&quot;
&quot;I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

==Plot==
Alexander Meyerheim hires veteran playboy screenwriter Richard Benson to write a screenplay. Overly immersed in his playboy lifestyle, Benson procrastinates writing the script until two days before the due date. Gabrielle Simpson, a temp secretary Benson hired to type the script, arrives at Richard&#x27;s hotel room, only to discover that little has been written. Richard tells her that Alexander will be in Paris by Sunday morning, in two days&#x27; time, and that they have that long to write a 138-page script.

Richard and Gabrielle then begin to weave a script together, and Richard is awakened and inspired by the beautiful Gabrielle. They imagine various scenarios for his screenplay, &quot;The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower&quot;, which is based on their unfolding romance as Gabrielle goes back and forth between thinking Richard is a good man and her budding attraction to him, and her hesitancy when considering he described himself as a &quot;liar and a thief&quot; for taking Meyerheim&#x27;s money and not delivering the script earlier. The screenplay, with small but inspired and comedic roles for Noël Coward, Tony Curtis, and other famous stars of the era, spoofs the movie industry, actors, studio heads, and itself, and is rife with allusions to the earlier film roles of Hepburn and Holden.

After killing off his character tragically at the end of the script, Richard confesses to Gabrielle that he is just an old washed-up alcoholic and does not deserve love or a happy ending. Calling the script they&#x27;ve just finished lousy, he admits that his creative peak is well behind him and he no longer cares about his work. Committed to continue scamming people and galavanting through life, he sends her away for her sake and drunkenly falls asleep.

Eventually, Richard comes to his senses. He seeks out Gabrielle to tell her he loves her and that they have a new script to write. Richard and Gabrielle run off with each other; Richard drops the pages of the old script into some sparking fireworks which are going off for Bastille Day. The two lovers kiss, as the words &quot;kiss&quot; and &quot;fade out&quot; appear on the screen.

==Cast==
Some members of the cast have roles in &quot;The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower&quot;, the film-within-the-film.

;Cast notes:
*In addition to the uncredited role played by Tony Curtis, first dressed in a red sweater, white pants and riding a Vespa, later in a dark green suit and a light green shirt and tie, the film also features uncredited cameo appearances by Marlene Dietrich as herself, dressed in white, stepping out of a white Bentley, and Mel Ferrer, Hepburn&#x27;s real-life husband at the time, who plays a party guest dressed as Dr. Jekyll. Frank Sinatra sings a few bars of the opening song, &quot;The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower&quot;.

==Production==
The film, whose working title was &quot;Together in Paris&quot;, is a remake of the 1952 French film &quot;Holiday for Henrietta&quot;, directed by Julien Duvivier. Paramount exercised an option on their contracts with both Hepburn and Holden, forcing them to make the film together. Holden, having had an affair with Hepburn during the making of &quot;Sabrina&quot; a decade earlier and been in love with her ever since, attempted without success to rekindle a romance with the now-married actress. Holden&#x27;s alcoholism was also a constant challenge for Quine, who moved into a rented house next to Holden&#x27;s during production to keep an eye on him. Holden later commented on both of the problems:
Curtis was brought into the production to film during a week when Holden was undergoing treatment for his alcoholism at the prompting of the director. Noel Coward worked on the film for three days, and a cameo from Marlene Dietrich meant to duplicate the many cameos of &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956).

The film was shot at the Billancourt Studios and on location around Paris. The film&#x27;s sets were designed by the art director Jean d&#x27;Eaubonne. Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s choice for cinematographer was Franz Planer who had photographed her in several of her films. With Planer being ill, Hepburn agreed to the use of Claude Renoir, however Charles Lang replaced Renoir as the director of photography during production, a change demanded by Hepburn after she saw what she felt were unflattering dailies.

Hepburn shot the film in the summer of 1962, back-to-back with &quot;Charade&quot;, which she shot that fall. The films shared several locations, most notably a Punch and Judy puppet theatre in the park in front of the Théâtre Marigny.

Though shooting finished in October 1962, a screening at Paramount led the studio to deem the film unreleasable with the exception of the attraction of its two stars.

In the film, the characters make passing mention of other films, and film topics, including &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and two contemporary films in which Hepburn played the lead: &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;Paris When It Sizzles&quot; &quot;marshmallow-weight hokum&quot;, and quoted a line from the film as an apt description of the film itself: &quot;contrived, utterly preposterous, and totally unmotivated&quot;; it complimented the two leads, saying Hepburn is a &quot;refreshingly individual creature in an era of the exaggerated curve&quot;, and Holden &quot;handles his assignment commendably&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine said the film was &quot;a multimillion dollar improvisation that does everything but what the title promises&quot; and suggested that &quot;writer George Axelrod (&quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;) and director Richard Quine should have taken a hint from Holden&#x27;s character Richard Benson, who writes his movie, takes a long sober look at what he has wrought, and burns it.&quot;

Turner Classic Movies notes that &quot;critics uniformly panned&quot; the film, but said it &quot;has earned a reputation as a guilty pleasure for those who enjoy in-joke movie spoofs and an absurdist storyline played out against the glorious backdrop of the City of Light&quot;.

==Paperback novelization==
In February 1964, Dell Publishing issued a paperback novelization (with a cover price of 40¢) by then-veteran tie-in author Saul Cooper. There may have been some editorial confusion in coordinating the copyediting and design stages of the book&#x27;s production, however, because the byline on the cover is &quot;Michael Milner&quot; (Cooper&#x27;s occasional pseudonym), while on the title page, the byline is that of fictional screenwriter &quot;Richard Benson&quot;, the story&#x27;s male lead. The Benson attribution is amusingly fitting, as Cooper&#x27;s novelistic approach was to narrate the story in the first person, using Benson&#x27;s voice and perspective. But that&#x27;s what makes it seem to be a publishing glitch that the cover byline should be yet another pseudonym, rather than a follow-through with the literary conceit.

<text>Sienna Rose Diana Miller (born 28 December 1981) is an American-British actress. Born in New York City and raised in London, she began her career as a photography model, appearing in the pages of Italian &quot;Vogue&quot; and for the 2003 Pirelli Calendar. Her acting breakthrough came in the 2004 films &quot;Layer Cake&quot; and &quot;Alfie&quot;. She subsequently portrayed socialite Edie Sedgwick in &quot;Factory Girl&quot; (2006) and author Caitlin Macnamara in &quot;The Edge of Love&quot; (2008), and was nominated for the BAFTA Rising Star Award in 2008. Her role as The Baroness in &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot; (2009) was followed by a brief sabbatical from the screen amid increased tabloid scrutiny.

Miller returned to prominence with her role as actress Tippi Hedren in the 2012 television film &quot;The Girl&quot;, for which she was nominated for the BAFTA Television Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film. She has since starred in several notable films, including &quot;Foxcatcher&quot; (2014), &quot;American Sniper&quot; (2014), &quot;The Lost City of Z&quot; (2016), &quot;Live by Night&quot; (2016), and &quot;American Woman&quot; (2018), as well as the miniseries &quot;The Loudest Voice&quot; (2019) and &quot;Anatomy of a Scandal&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Miller was born in New York City, in &quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot; theatre, and moved to London with her family when she was 18 months old. She later boarded at the Heathfield School in Ascot, Berkshire. Her father, Edwin Miller, is an American dealer in Chinese art, previously a banker. Her mother, Josephine, is a British former model who was born in South Africa to British parents and was a personal assistant to David Bowie and onetime manager of the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York.

==Acting career==

=== 2001–2003: Early acting credits ===
Miller&#x27;s screen debut came in the romantic comedy &quot;South Kensington&quot; (2001), opposite Rupert Everett and Elle Macpherson. In 2002, she had supporting roles in &quot;High Speed&quot; and its follow-up &quot;The Ride&quot;, and guest-starred in &quot;The American Embassy&quot; and &quot;Bedtime&quot;. She had a regular role as the combative yet caring flatmate of an NYPD detective in the television drama series &quot;Keen Eddie&quot; (2003). It was Miller&#x27;s first exposure to American audiences. FOX cancelled it after only seven episodes.

=== 2004–2008: Breakthrough and tabloid notoriety ===

With roles in two commercial films and a higher public profile due to her relationship with actor Jude Law, 2004 was a turning point for Miller&#x27;s career. The crime thriller &quot;Layer Cake&quot;, directed by Matthew Vaughn and starring Daniel Craig, featured her as the love interest of a London-based cocaine supplier. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Miller &quot;a new It Girl who barely registers on-screen despite wearing little more than lacey filaments that make her look like a gift meant to be unwrapped very quickly&quot;. In &quot;Alfie&quot;, the remake of Bill Naughton&#x27;s 1966 film, she played the girlfriend of a cockney limo driver and sex addict (Jude Law). Of her It Girl status, she said at the time: &quot;I&#x27;m not very happy about it, to be honest. It makes me uncomfortable because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as a result of having a film come out, [but] being scrutinised because of the relationship I&#x27;m in&quot;.

Miller portrayed a writer of illegal feminist books and the love interest of Giacomo Casanova (Heath Ledger) in the 2005 period dramedy &quot;Casanova&quot;. It made $37.6 million, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, in a favorable review, wrote: &quot;Ms. Miller has a modern, smart-girl look about her; her Francesca is neither too tough to melt nor too glittering from the Emma Thompson school of smarties&quot;. Also in 2005 she made her West End debut in a revival of &quot;As You Like It&quot; at the Wyndhams Theatre, receiving lukewarm reviews. Paul Taylor of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote: &quot;She approaches an emotion with the finesse of someone beating a carpet&quot; and that she &quot;brings to it all the ripe professional stage experience that can be mustered from appearing in three movies&quot;.

Miller took on the role of 1960s socialite and Andy Warhol&#x27;s muse Edie Sedgwick in the 2006 biographical drama &quot;Factory Girl&quot;. Johnny Vaughan of &quot;Sun&quot; Online concluded, &quot;[i]t&#x27;s Sienna Miller&#x27;s star that shines brightest in this heartbreaking cautionary tale&quot;, but Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; critical consensus reads: &quot;Despite a dedicated performance by Sienna Miller, &quot;Factory Girl&quot; delves only superficially into her character, and ultimately fails to tell a coherent story.&quot; In 2007, Miller had a role as the love interest of a young man from a fictional British town in Matthew Vaughn&#x27;s adaptation &quot;Stardust&quot;, and played a starlet in Steve Buscemi&#x27;s &quot;Interview&quot;, a remake of Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh&#x27;s 2003 movie of the same name. Budgeted at $65 million, &quot;Stardust&quot; grossed $137 million worldwide, while critics felt that Buscemi&#x27;s and Miller&#x27;s &quot;captivating performances&quot; in &quot;Interview&quot; made &quot;a seemingly simple premise gripping and entertaining&quot;.

In &quot;The Mysteries of Pittsburgh&quot; (2008), a film adaptation of Michael Chabon&#x27;s novel, Miller played a woman romantically involved with a rebellious bisexual man. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and received a limited release. She created a minor stir in Pittsburgh when, in a 2006 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, she called the city &quot;Shitsburgh&quot;, saying, &quot;Can you believe this is my life? Will you pity me when you&#x27;re back in your funky New York apartment and I&#x27;m still in Pittsburgh? I need to get more glamorous films and stop with my indie year.&quot; Miller was parodied in Pittsburgh media (including one article headlined &quot;Semi-famous actress dumps on the &#x27;Burgh&quot;) and criticised for making what was seen as an unnecessarily disparaging remark, given the special treatment the film&#x27;s cast and crew had received from the visitors&#x27; bureau and other city offices. Miller apologised and said her remarks were taken out of context.

In the 2008 British biographical drama &quot;The Edge of Love,&quot; Miller appeared alongside Keira Knightley as Caitlin Macnamara, the wife of poet Dylan Thomas. Despite a mixed critical reception, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; critic Ray Bennett wrote that it was a &quot;wonderfully atmospheric tale of love and war&quot;, and that &quot;the film belongs to the women, with Knightley going from strength to strength (and showing she can sing!) and Miller again proving that she has everything it takes to be a major movie star.&quot; Miller earned a BIFA nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. She also voiced a circus fox in the animated film &quot;A Fox&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2008) and played an undead newlywed in the romantic comedy &quot;Camille&quot;.

=== 2009–2011: Screen hiatus ===

Miller was cast as The Baroness in the live-action film adaptation of the &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; franchise &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot; (2009), her first—and to date, only—mainstream Hollywood blockbuster. She auditioned because it did not involve &quot;having a breakdown or [being] addicted to heroin or dying at the end, something that was just maybe really great fun and that people went to see and actually just had a great time seeing.&quot; She sprained her wrist after slipping on a rubber bullet while filming a fight scene with Rachel Nichols. &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; was not well received by most critics, but made $302.5 million worldwide.

She appeared on the UK motorsport show &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2009 on the segment &quot;star in a reasonably priced car&quot; and set a lap time of 1:49.8, having passed her driving test only five days before.

&quot;The Irish Independent&quot; observed that Miller&#x27;s professional trajectory had reached &quot;its lowest ebb&quot; with &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, an experience that &quot;convinced her she had well and truly lost her way&quot;; in an interview with UK&#x27;s &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, she said that roles dried up because &quot;people don&#x27;t want to see films with people they don&#x27;t approve of in them&quot;.

She opted to take a hiatus from films for the next two years and work in theater instead. She later said, &quot;I was sick of myself, to be honest, or sick of that perception of me. It all felt so fucking dirt&quot;.

In 2009, Miller played the title role in Patrick Marber&#x27;s &quot;After Miss Julie&quot; on Broadway. She told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;This is what I have always wanted, to be on Broadway. I&#x27;m living my dream, and that&#x27;s all you can ask for. At a certain point, you have to ignore all the rest&quot;. On her performance, &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated: &quot;Miller masters it intermittently—an accomplishment, however incomplete.&quot; She starred as a former starlet caught up in a love-triangle in Trevor Nunn&#x27;s 2011 production of &quot;Flare Path&quot; at London&#x27;s Theatre Royal Haymarket.

=== 2012–2017: Resurgence ===

After her professional slump, Miller experienced what journalists called a &quot;career revival&quot; She played more complex, dramatic parts in a series of critically acclaimed films. &quot;All the directors speak to each other,&quot; she said in an interview. &quot;And once you crack that upper echelon of incredible directors, you&#x27;ve got people rooting for you. People who people listen to. I&#x27;ve never had that before&quot;.

In &quot;The Girl&quot; (2012), an HBO and BBC film, Miller portrayed actress Tippi Hedren, the muse of director Alfred Hitchcock. As part of her research, Miller (who was in the early stages of pregnancy) spoke to Hedren several times during filming, and they became friends. Live birds were used for the recreation of the attic scene in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot;. Miller told the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, &quot;I did go through a bird attack for two hours. It pales in comparison to what [Hedren] was subjected to, but it was pretty horrible. There were men off-camera with boxes of birds, throwing seagulls and pigeons in my face&quot;. The film received mixed reviews, but the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;″s Jane Simon wrote: &quot;[G]liding gracefully through it all (and with an impeccable American accent) Sienna Miller brings untouchable beauty and icy glamour, but also captures the extraordinary resilience Hedren must have had to withstand everything Hitchcock threw at her.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, Clive James said &quot;[a] better choice [to play Hedren] could not have been made than Sienna Miller, who is even lovelier than Hedren was&quot;. She garnered nominations for the BAFTA Television Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film. In 2012, she also played a socialite in the dramedy &quot;Two Jacks&quot;, the hysterical sister of an elementary teacher in the drama &quot;Yellow&quot;, and a housewife who aspires to complete in a belly-dance competition in the made-for-television film &quot;Just like a Woman&quot;.

In 2014, Miller portrayed Nancy Schultz, the wife of murdered Olympic gold medal-winning wrestler Dave Schultz, in Bennett Miller&#x27;s &quot;Foxcatcher,&quot; and Taya Renae Kyle, the wife of United States Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s &quot;American Sniper&quot;. Both films were highly acclaimed, and &quot;American Sniper&quot; emerged as the highest-grossing war film of all time. In 2015, she took on the roles of a prostitute in the road drama &quot;Mississippi Grind&quot;, the former boss of a hard-working small business owner in the comedy &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;, a single mother in the dystopian film &quot;High-Rise&quot;, and that of a sous-chef in the drama &quot;Burnt&quot;, which reunited her with Bradley Cooper. For &quot;High-Rise&quot;, she received a BIFA nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Miller also took the role of Sally Bowles in the Broadway revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; after Emma Stone&#x27;s scheduled departure from the production and performed for the last six weeks of the show&#x27;s engagement, in February and March 2015. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; praised her &quot;cocky and steely&quot; performance and wrote that her approach to the role &quot;works well in the Kander and Ebb songs &#x27;Don&#x27;t Tell Momma&#x27; and &#x27;Perfectly Marvelous&#x27;.&quot; She was selected to be on the jury for the main competition section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.

Miller appeared in Paramount Pictures and Plan B Entertainment&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Lost City of Z&quot; (2016), directed by James Gray, portraying Nina Fawcett, the wife of British geographer Percy Fawcett. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her &quot;wonderful&quot; in her role, while &quot;Time&quot; described her as &quot;luminous and astute&quot;. In Ben Affleck&#x27;s period crime drama &quot;Live by Night&quot; (2016), Miller played the mistress of a notorious gangster and the love interest of a World War I veteran. In 2017, Miller starred in the drama &quot;The Private Life of a Modern Woman&quot;, which screened out of competition at the 74th Venice International Film Festival, and in a West End production of the Tennessee Williams classic &quot;Cat On A Hot Tin Roof&quot;, at the Apollo Theatre.

===2018–present===
In 2018, Miller appeared in the war film &quot;The Catcher Was a Spy&quot; as Estella, the girlfriend of Moe Berg, a catcher for the Boston Red Sox who joined the OSS during World War II, as well as the drama &quot;American Woman&quot;, in which she portrays a single mother faced with raising her grandson after her daughter goes missing under mysterious circumstances. &quot;American Woman&quot;, which gave Miller some of the best reviews of her career, was her first role as the main character not bolstered by any other actors, and marked the first time she was able to delve into a woman character&#x27;s life in &quot;nuanced ways&quot;. Miller remarked: &quot;These opportunities have been few and far between, and that&#x27;s intrinsic to being a woman in film. I think it&#x27;s quite rare; not necessarily specific to me, but at 37 years old, I&#x27;m thrilled I&#x27;ve had this opportunity. I&#x27;ve done good supporting work in fantastic films and had to work very hard to show something in smaller moments. I loved being able to have the space and time to really do everything I want to with a character&quot;.

Miller starred as a narcotics detective in the 2019 action film &quot;21 Bridges&quot; alongside Chadwick Boseman. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that she was &quot;vocally channelling Edie Falco from &quot;The Sopranos&quot;&quot;, and with a worldwide gross of $50 million, the film was a moderate commercial success. She next took the role of Beth Ailes, the wife of television executive Roger Ailes (played by Russell Crowe), in the miniseries &quot;The Loudest Voice&quot; (2019), which aired on Showtime. Miller struggled to find material on which to base her performance aside from the script and Gabriel Sherman&#x27;s book &quot;The Loudest Voice in the Room&quot;. During an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, she said: &quot;There&#x27;s very little footage of her that I had access to. But there were these two speeches which she gave, which were on YouTube, and another little interview, so I really kind of based my research around that, and relied on the script because there&#x27;s just not a lot of information on her out there. But the interview and the speeches I found really revealing&quot;.

In February 2024, she joined the short film &quot;Marion&quot; as an executive producer.

==Other endeavours==
===Modelling===
Before her professional acting career, Miller worked as a photography model. She signed with Tandy Anderson of Select Model Management London, and modelled for Coca-Cola, Italian &quot;Vogue&quot;, and posed topless in the 2003 Pirelli Calendar. She went on to appear on the covers of &quot;Vogue&quot;&#x27;s American, British, Australian and Portuguese editions, as well as other international fashion magazines such as &quot;Nylon&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, and &quot;Porter Edit&quot;.

Miller signed a two-year contract with Madrid-based denim label Pepe Jeans London. The first ad campaign appeared on magazines in March 2006 and was shot by photographer Mikael Jansson and stylist Karl Templer. In February 2009, Hugo Boss Fragrances announced that she would be the new ambassador for their &quot;BOSS Orange&quot; women&#x27;s perfume. In March 2016, she announced as the new face of Swedish fashion chain Lindex, starring in the 1970s-inspired Sienna Hearts Lindex spring campaign. Miller appeared as a guest at a Rome retro-styled dinner party in Gucci&#x27;s Cruise 2020 campaign, which was directed and photographed by American film director Harmony Korine.

===Fashion design===
In 2007, Miller, along with her sister Savannah, a fashion designer, launched a complete fashion label. Called Twenty8Twelve, it gets its name from Miller&#x27;s birthdate and is financially backed by Pepe Jeans. The sisters remained at the helm of the label until 2012, when they announced they were stepping down as co-creative directors.

===Charity===
Miller is the Global Ambassador for the International Medical Corps. She travelled with them to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in April 2009 and blogged about the experience. She also visited Haiti with the group after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Miller also worked alongside Global Cool during their 2007 eco-friendly campaign.

Miller is an ambassador for the UK branch of the Starlight Children&#x27;s Foundation, which works with seriously ill children and their parents. On 1 July 2007, she appeared as a speaker at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London to celebrate the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death. Proceeds from the concert went to Diana&#x27;s charities as well as to charities of which her sons Princes William and Harry are patrons.

==Public image==

Miller&#x27;s relationship with Jude Law, after they starred together in the 2004 film &quot;Alfie&quot;, brought both her and her style of dress media headlines in the mid-2000s. In December 2004, &quot;Vogue&quot; featured Miller on its cover and called her &quot;the girl of the year&quot;.

Miller has been closely associated with the style of fashion known as boho chic. She told &quot;Vogue&quot; she had a laid-back approach to grooming, including cutting her own hair. Miller has adopted other styles of dress and her shorter, bobbed hairstyle—a feature of bohemian fashion in the 1920s—helped define a trend in 2007.

In the late 2000s, Miller was better known for her tabloid persona and fashion sense than her professional work. &quot;The Irish Independent&quot; wrote in 2015 that &quot;she was one of the most famous young actresses of her generation, but still boasted precious little credibility in the industry&quot;. In a 2017 interview with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, she said: &quot;I definitely feel like I&#x27;m in a place now where people are more focused on my career than on my private life and clothes, which is refreshing. There&#x27;s not the same drama around me that there was&quot;.

Miller has appeared in several magazines&#x27; lists of the world&#x27;s most beautiful women. She ranked 48th, 46th, 11th, 27th, and 51st in &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot 100 Women in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. She ranked 86th and 2nd in &quot;Askmen&quot;&#x27;s top 99 &quot;most desirable&quot; women lists of 2005 and 2006. She was also 63rd in &quot;FHM&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Sexiest Women in the World&quot; 2006 supplement.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
On Christmas Day 2004, Miller became engaged to her &quot;Alfie&quot; co-star Jude Law. On 18 July 2005, Law issued a public apology to Miller for having an affair with his children&#x27;s nanny. After attempting to salvage their relationship, Miller and Law separated in November 2006. During their relationship, tabloids leaked news of Miller&#x27;s pregnancy, which she ultimately aborted. In 2008, Miller had a highly publicised affair with married actor Balthazar Getty. She later sued two British tabloids for publishing photos of her and Getty together.

In December 2009, it was reported that Law and Miller had rekindled their relationship after starring in separate shows on Broadway in late 2009. They spent Christmas 2009 in Barbados with three of Law&#x27;s children. They announced they had split again in February 2011.

From 2011 to 2015, Miller dated and became engaged to actor Tom Sturridge, with whom she has a daughter, who was born on 7 July 2012.

Miller began dating actor Oli Green in late 2021. Their daughter was born in December 2023.

===Phone hacking scandal===

Following a High Court hearing in May 2011, Miller was awarded £100,000 in damages from &quot;News of the World&quot; after the newspaper admitted hacking into her phone. Later, as a core participant, she gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry in November 2011, including the following:

In November 2021, Miller accepted a financial settlement from News Group Newspapers, publishers of &quot;The Sun&quot;, over an alleged phone hacking claim. Her lawyer David Sherborne told the court the payout is &quot;tantamount&quot; to an admission of illegal activity by &quot;The Sun&quot;. Outside the High Court on 9 December 2021, Miller said of &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper, &quot;They very nearly ruined my life. I have certainly seen how they have ruined the lives of others.&quot;

<text>Legislative elections were held in French Polynesia on 23 May 2004 to elect members of the Assembly.

In a surprise result Oscar Temaru&#x27;s pro-independence progressive coalition formed Government with a one-seat majority in the 57 seat parliament, defeating the conservative party led by Gaston Flosse (see also List of political parties in French Polynesia). On October 8, 2004, the Gaston Flosse led opposition party succeeded in passing a censure motion against the Government. This provoked a political crisis, and controversy about whether the national government of France should use its exceptional power to call for new elections in a local government, in case of a grave political crisis.

==Timeline==

23 May 2004: Elections for the Assembly of French Polynesia (&quot;Assemblée de la Polynésie française&quot;), the territorial assembly of French Polynesia, held. A progressive coalition led by pro-independence Oscar Temaru wins 26 (27 respectively) seats and forms a coalition with 3 (2 respectively) autonomist members to form a Government with a majority of one (see also List of political parties in French Polynesia). The conservative party led by Gaston Flosse has 28 seats.

10 June 2004: Former President, Gaston Flosse, and his conservative party, Tahoeraa Huiraatira, stayed away from the presidential (&quot;Le président de la Polynésie française&quot;) election, thus invalidating it, as a three-fifths quorum was required. He subsequently lost one defector to Oscar Temaru.

14 June 2004: Oscar Temaru elected President (&quot;Le président de la Polynésie française&quot;) (when a simple majority quorum was required), gaining 30 out of 57 votes. 

5 October 2004: Two motions of censure tabled in the Assembly of French Polynesia (&quot;Assemblée de la Polynésie française&quot;). One from Gaston Flosse&#x27;s Tahoeraa Huiraatira party, and one from a new group, Te Ara, that includes three former members of Flosse’s party.

9 October 2004: A motion of censure tabled by the conservative Tahoeraa Huiraatira, was adopted by 29 votes out of 57. The motion was proposed by opposition leader Gaston Flosse after Oscar Temaru ordered an audit of the previous government, which was led by Gaston Flosse. A second censure motion was not voted upon.

12 October 2004: Tahoeraa Huiraatira, endorses its President, Gaston Flosse, as its official candidate for the Presidency in the French administered territory of French Polynesia (&quot;Le président de la Polynésie française&quot;).

The President of the Assembly of French Polynesia (&quot;Le président de l&#x27;Assemblée de la Polynésie française&quot;), Antony Géros, from Oscar Temaru&#x27;s coalition government, insisted that the parliament should meet on October 25 to elect a new government president (&quot;Le président de la Polynésie française&quot;). However, this date was against the advice of the French High Commissioner of the Republic in French Polynesia (&quot;Le Haut-Commissaire de la République en Polynésie française&quot;) Michel Mathieu who stated in written letters that the Assembly of French Polynesia (&quot;Assemblée de la Polynésie française&quot;) is required to vote on a new government president (&quot;Le président de la Polynésie française&quot;) within 15 days of the passage of a censure motion. The third Vice president of the Assembly of French Polynesia, Lana Tetuanui from Gaston Flosse’s party, called for the Assembly to sit on October 20, 2004.

15 October 2004: Second request by Oscar Temaru for fresh elections denied by French minister for overseas Territories (&quot;la Ministre de l’Outre-mer&quot;) Brigitte Girardin.

16 October 2004: More than 20,000 people march through Papeete on Tahiti, the main island of French Polynesia, in support of Oscar Temaru demanding new elections. Demonstrations also occur across French Polynesia.

19 October 2004: French Polynesia’s caretaker government president, Oscar Temaru, has asked the Papeete administrative court (&quot;Le Tribunal administratif de la Polynésie française&quot;) to suspend, then cancel the October 9 adopted censure motion.

20 October 2004: The Assembly of French Polynesia meets, but is unable to elect a new president (&quot;Le président de la Polynésie française&quot;) as there is not a required quorum in attendance due to a boycott of members supporting Oscar Temaru.

22 October 2004: The Assembly of French Polynesia meets to elect President (&quot;Le président de la Polynésie française&quot;). Simple Majority required. Gaston Flosse was re-elected (&quot;Le président de la Polynésie française&quot;) by a one-vote majority and sworn in immediately during a parliamentary session boycotted by caretaker President Oscar Temaru. The parliament elected Flosse with 29 of 57 votes; the 28 pro-independence members boycotted the vote.

Antony Géros, the president of the Assembly of French Polynesia (&quot;Le président de l&#x27;Assemblée de la Polynésie française&quot;), did not participate in Friday’s session, and also described Flosse’s election Friday as an &quot;election of the president of the Tahoeraa Huiraatira&quot;, which is a reference to Flosse’s pro-autonomy and anti-independence party. Geros said that Monday, October 25, is the only legitimate date for the parliament to elect a government president following the censure motion.

23 October 2004: a Council of State (French national supreme administrative court) judge rejected two petitions from Tahiti to suspend the October 9 censure motion that toppled French Polynesia President (&quot;Le président de la Polynésie française&quot;) Oscar Temaru’s majority coalition government.

26 October 2004: Tensions remain high in French Polynesia as the Leadership remains in doubt. The Legislative Assembly failed to sit on Monday, October 25. Assembly Speaker (&quot;Le président de l&#x27;Assemblée de la Polynésie française&quot;), Antony Géros, failed to turn up and chair the sitting he himself had scheduled. Gaston Flosse, who was elected President (&quot;Le président de la Polynésie française&quot;) by an assembly sitting on October 22, attempted to enter the Presidential palace on the weekend but was met by closed gates.

15 November 2004: The Council of State, judging on a request from Gaston Flosse, cancels the May elections in the Windward Islands-circonscription () for the reason that the neutrality of election officials was not observed in one of the communes, which, given the small difference of vote counts, may have altered the electoral results.

13 February 2005: By-elections for the Assembly of French Polynesia are held in the Windward Islands-circumscription () The pro-independence-coalition wins 30 seats: Part of the pro-independence-coalition is the Union for the Democracy (&quot;Union pour la Démocratie&quot;) with Oscar Temaru&#x27;s Tavini Huiraatira (&quot;People&#x27;s servant&quot;) which wins 27 seats and the Alliance for a New Democracy (&quot;Alliance pour une Démocratie Nouvelle&quot;) which wins 3 seats. The Conservative coalition (consisting of one party only), the pro-autonomy, anti-independence Tahoera&#x27;a Huiraatira (&quot;Popular Rally&quot;), wins only 27 seats.

3 March 2005: Oscar Temaru elected President of French Polynesia (&quot;Le président de la Polynésie française&quot;) for the second time.

<doc id="1091340" wikidata="Q3632674" url="?curid=1091340" title="Bad Bad One">
<text>Bad Bad One is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Meredith Brooks. It was released on May 21, 2002, by Gold Circle Records. Following the commercial disappointment of her previous album, &quot;Deconstruction&quot; (1999), Brooks was dropped from Capitol Records. Brooks subsequently signed to Gold Circle Records and built a home studio to record and produce the album herself, with additional production from frequent collaborator David Darling. &quot;Bad Bad One&quot; received little commercial recognition, with Gold Circle Records folding shortly after the album&#x27;s release. Despite this minimal commercial recognition, the album received praise from music critics. In 2004, the album was reissued under the title Shine by Kissing Booth Records. The reissue had a rearranged track listing and included an additional remix of &quot;Shine,&quot; which was featured as the theme song for &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; from 2004 to 2008.

==Recording==
Brooks recorded over 50 songs for the album over the course of two years before she finalized a track listing of 12 songs. With &quot;Bad Bad One&quot;, Brooks sought to take more control over her music, resulting in her building a home studio and learning Pro Tools so that she could freely engineer and produce the entire album herself. Speaking on the freedom that this home studio allowed her, Brooks commented: &quot;Musically, lyrically, vocally, and guitar-wise, I realized that for the first time I could do everything I wanted to do. If I didn&#x27;t like my vocal, I could just go down at 2 a.m. and redo it. It allowed me to develop more.&quot; Brooks described &quot;Bad Bad One&quot; as a complete fulfillment of her creative vision, claiming that she was not under the usual pressure to be &quot;politically, spiritually or romantically correct.&quot;

==Release==
The release of &quot;Bad Bad One&quot; was met with several delays. The album had two set release dates—April 23 and then May 5—before finally being released on May 21, 2002. Gold Circle Records folded almost immediately after the album&#x27;s release, resulting in it receiving very minimal promotion. In 2004, Dr. Phil selected &quot;Shine&quot; to be the theme song for his eponymous talk show. This renewed interest in the song resulted in a reissue of &quot;Bad Bad One&quot; on September 21, 2004, by Savoy Records. The reissue was titled &quot;Shine&quot; and featured a rearranged track listing and an additional remix of &quot;Shine&quot; used during &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;.

==Critical reception==

MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic praised the versatile and carefree nature of the album. She commented: &quot;Meredith Brooks captured the moment and claimed victory on &quot;Bad Bad One&quot;. She found an inspiration -- it&#x27;s fiery and passionate while also literate and cathartic -- and ran with it.&quot; Michael Paoletta of &quot;Billboard&quot; referred to the effort as a &quot;welcome return that shows the kids a thing or two.&quot; Paoletta highlighted &quot;Shine,&quot; &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me,&quot; and &quot;Where Lovers Meet&quot; as standouts from the album.

<doc id="1091346" wikidata="Q1356395" url="?curid=1091346" title="Alfie (2004 film)">
<text>Alfie is a 2004 romantic comedy-drama film inspired by 1966 British film of the same name and its 1975 sequel, starring Jude Law as the title character, originally played by Michael Caine in the 1966 film and Alan Price in the 1975 sequel. The film was co-written, directed, and produced by Charles Shyer.

==Plot==
Alfie Elkins is a Cockney limo driver living in Manhattan. A sex addict, he regularly has one-night stands with numerous women. In addition, he maintains a casual relationship with single mother Julie, his &quot;semi-regular-quasi-sort-of-girlfriend thing&quot;, and unhappily married Dorie. Once Dorie wants more than casual sex, he stops calling.

Alfie and his coworker and best friend Marlon want to open a company together, but Marlon needs to get back with his ex, Lonette. When Alfie goes to put in a good word for him, he finds her at her bar. But after getting drunk, they have sex. Alfie meets Marlon the next day, terrified he knows about it, but is relieved when Marlon says he and Lonette got back together and are getting married.

When Alfie goes to Julie&#x27;s for a booty call, she immediately asks him to leave, confronting him as she had discovered Dorie&#x27;s underwear in her rubbish bin—he had discarded them after finding them in his pocket. Intending to reconcile with her on her son&#x27;s birthday, Alfie sees Julie has returned to her estranged husband. He later discovers Lonette is pregnant with his child, and (without telling Marlon) they go to a clinic for an abortion. Soon afterward, Marlon and Lonette unexpectedly move upstate, without saying goodbye.

Following repeated failures to achieve an erection, Alfie sees a doctor, who tells him he is perfectly healthy, and his impotence is due to stress. However, he finds a lump on Alfie&#x27;s penis. They immediately run a test at the clinic and he spends a few anxious days awaiting the results. On a trip to the hospital, Alfie meets Joe, a widower, in the bathroom. Joe gives life advice to the depressed Alfie: &quot;Find somebody to love, and live every day like it&#x27;s your last&quot;. Soon afterward, Alfie finds out he&#x27;s cancer-free.

Believing he&#x27;s been given a second chance, Alfie decides to &quot;aim higher&quot; in his love life. He meets Nikki, a beautiful but unstable woman, and they quickly embark on a passionate, turbulent relationship. Moving in together, Alfie finds it hard to put up with her mood swings, especially after she goes off her medication. Distancing himself, he focuses on an older woman, Liz. A sultry cosmetics mogul, she inspires him to &quot;aim higher&quot;. He becomes infatuated, but she wants to keep it strictly sexual. Alfie then ends it with Nikki.

Running into Julie in a coffee shop, Alfie realizes he has feelings for her; however, she&#x27;s now with someone else. On a trip upstate to visit Marlon and his now-wife, Lonette, she reveals she never had the abortion, and, Marlon knows Alfie is the father, but nonetheless decided to stay. Upon seeing Marlon with hurt in his eyes, Alfie visits Joe, who tells him to get his life together. Alfie turns to Liz for comfort but is crushed that she has an even younger man in her life.

Alfie has a chance meeting with Dorie late one night. As he tries to get back into her life, she wants no part of him. Apologizing for not calling, he admits he has trouble expressing himself, running from relationships when they become too serious. She wishes him luck. The film ends with Alfie talking about genuinely changing his ways.

==Cast==
A black and white photograph of Michael Caine representing Alfie Elkins Sr. appears during the film&#x27;s credits.

==Production==
The film was shot throughout England, mostly locations doubling for New York City, along with on-set shooting in Manhattan.
* Liverpool, England
* Manchester, England
* Port of Tilbury, England (some dock scenes)
* Park Avenue, Manhattan, New York City, US
* Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Manhattan, New York City, US

==Music==

The music score was composed by Mick Jagger, Dave Stewart and John Powell, featuring 13 original songs and a remake of the original 1966 title song. Further songs are by Wyclef Jean and The Isley Brothers.

For the song &quot;Old Habits Die Hard&quot;, Jagger and Stewart won the BFCA Award, the Golden Globe, a Sierra Award, and the World Soundtrack Award.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Alfie&quot; grossed $13,399,812 in the US and $21,750,734 in other countries for a worldwide total of $35,150,546 on a $60 million budget. The film opened on November 5, 2004, in the United States and grossed $2,206,738 on the first day. That weekend, the film was #5 in the box office with $6,218,335 behind &quot;The Incredibles&quot;″ opening weekend, &quot;Ray&quot;″s second, &quot;The Grudge&quot;″s third, and &quot;Saw&quot;″s second. When compared to its $60 million budget, &quot;Alfie&quot; was a box office bomb.

===Critical response===
&quot;Alfie&quot; received mixed reviews. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 48% based on 152 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;This unnecessary remake wants &quot;Alfie&quot; to have his cake and eat it, too, but a lack of sexual fizz and a sour performance by Jude Law conspire to deliver audiences a romantic comedy that isn&#x27;t romantic or funny.&quot;

Todd McCarthy from &quot;Variety&quot; describes the film as &quot;a breezy, sexy romp with a conscience that reflects in obvious but interesting ways on societal changes over the intervening 38 years.&quot;

Roger Ebert enjoyed the film, praising Law&#x27;s performance and saying that &quot;on its own terms, it&#x27;s funny at times and finally sad and sweet.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B−&quot;, praising the actresses and Law, but also noting &quot;Jude Law would appear to have all the attributes of a movie star: looks, humor, rogue charm. Yet there&#x27;s one he could use more of — an anger that might ignite his smooth presence.&quot;

Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; states:

Unlike the 1966 British film on which it is based, with its abrasive star-making turn from Michael Caine, the new &quot;Alfie&quot; doesn&#x27;t chase social significance – it just wants us to have a good time. The story&#x27;s observations about male behavior aren&#x27;t earth shattering...but what gives it its kick is how Alfie takes the film audience into his confidence. In both films, the character talks directly into the camera, a disarming strategy that brings us closer to this serial seducer than we might want. Playing narrator turns Alfie into a tour guide and something of his own defense attorney; it also means he has to enrapture the audience along with his conquests.

In 2024, Law expressed dissatisfaction with the film, &quot;I was in a really strong position [at that time] because I&#x27;d just had another [Oscar] nomination on the back of &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, and for &quot;Alfie&quot; to be the film I chose to do quite soon after that, I think was a bad move.&quot; Law also felt that the film &quot;was made for too much money&quot; and that he &quot;was probably paid too much money, which I underestimated at the time.&quot;

<text>Schmitz Park, also known as Schmitz Preserve Park, is a park around 15 blocks east of Alki Point in West Seattle, Washington. It features Schmitz Park Creek and one of the last stands of old-growth forest in the city.

The Lushootseed name for the area that is now the park is , meaning &quot;place of disease.&quot;

Ferdinand and Emma Schmitz donated of the park to the city in 1908. They wanted their land to be used as a park. (Ferdinand was a German immigrant who moved to Seattle in 1887 and was the city&#x27;s Parks Commissioner from 1908 to 1914). Additions to the park were purchased in 1909, 1930, 1947, and 1958, making the park grow over 20 more acres (8 ha). 

In 1949, a &quot;preservation policy&quot; was applied to Schmitz Park. It stated that only foot trails were allowed and all signs were to be removed from inside the park&#x27;s borders. This policy still remains today.

In 1953, Schmitz Park Elementary School opened to the public. The school sits adjacent to Schmitz Park.

In January 2018 Seattle City Council Bill No. CB 119169 authorized the purchase of a 5,000-sq. ft. lot at the southeast edge of the park from Bruce Stotler for $225,000, less than half its assessed value.

<doc id="1091363" wikidata="Q1059530" url="?curid=1091363" title="BanYa">
<text>BanYa (반야), sometimes spelled BANYA or Banya, was the South Korean arcade game company Andamiro&#x27;s musical group responsible for creating original songs for &quot;Pump It Up&quot;. The style of its music varies greatly, from hip hop to electronic, from rock to classical crossovers.

Classical remixes are among BanYa&#x27;s most popular productions. Several sonatas, symphonies and other pieces feature in different versions. Mixing violins, guitars and heavy beats, these songs draw particular attention from players and passers-by. BanYa also composes original music including trance, techno, hardcore and ambient breaks.

Beginning in &quot;Pump It Up NX&quot;, former BanYa member Yahpp became a solo artist and in turn his new music became credited to him. Starting in &quot;Pump It Up Fiesta&quot;, msgoon, another former member, did the same. All other former members, starting on &quot;NX&quot;, became credited as &quot;BanYa Production&quot;. For the consistency of the article, all songs by the original BanYa collective are listed here.

==Song catalogue==
The group&#x27;s first two releases under the name of BanYa were &quot;Ignition Starts&quot; and &quot;Hypnosis&quot;, although &quot;Bee&quot;, &quot;Solitary&quot; and &quot;Final Audition&quot; had been already recorded by Yahpp as an independent artist. Up to 2004 they released 3 albums, however some nonstop remixes of several BanYa songs have also been made for &quot;Pump It Up&quot;.

On &quot;Pump It Up Exceed 2&quot;, &quot;Radezky Can Can&quot; was moved from the &quot;K-Pop Channel&quot; to the &quot;BanYa Channel&quot;, even though it was made by F2 System, who worked with Andamiro to make &quot;Pump It Up Extra&quot;. &quot;Holiday&quot;, the other F2 song, has only showed up on &quot;Extra&quot;, &quot;The PREX&quot; and &quot;The PREX 2&quot;.

==Discography==

=== The 1st Step to the BanYa ===
This album comprised all their songs from &quot;Pump It Up: The 1st Dance Floor&quot; to &quot;The O.B.G: The Season Evolution Dance Floor&quot;, excluding &quot;Creamy Skinny&quot; and &quot;Koul&quot;, from &quot;The 2nd Dance Floor&quot;. It also included an electric guitar version of &quot;Ignition Starts&quot; instead of the original hardcore version, a version of &quot;Hate&quot; sung by Pp (the same girl who sang &quot;Pumping Up&quot;) and a completely new song, a ballad entitled &quot;Warm Shadow in a Stranger&#x27;s Eyes&quot; (rough translation, as it&#x27;s very hard to translate this title from Korean). All the songs that existed in a version longer than the one appearing in the arcade were included in their original versions, except &quot;Final Audition&quot;.

<text>Passiflora caerulea, the blue passionflower, bluecrown passionflower or common passion flower, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It has been introduced elsewhere. It is a vigorous, deciduous or semi-evergreen tendril bearing vine growing to or more. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and its fragrant flowers are blue-white with a prominent fringe of coronal filaments in bands of blue, white, yellow, and brown. The ovoid orange fruit, growing to , is edible, but is variously described as having a bland, undesirable, or insipid taste. In South America, the plant is known for its medicinal properties, and is used by both the Toba and the Maka peoples.

==Etymology==
The specific epithet &quot;caerulea&quot; means &quot;qara and refers to the blue coronal filaments.

==Description==

===Vegetative characteristics===
&quot;Passiflora caerulea&quot; is a woody vine capable of growing to high where supporting trees are available. The leaves are alternate, palmately five-lobed (sometimes three, seven, or nine lobes), and are up to in length while being linear-oblong shaped. The base of each leaf has a flagellate-twining tendril long, which twines around supporting vegetation to hold the plant up.
===Generative characteristics===
The flower is complex, about in diameter, with the five sepals and petals similar in appearance, whitish in colour, surmounted by a corona of blue or violet filaments, then five greenish-yellow stamens and three purple stigmas. The fruit is an oval orange-yellow berry, long by in diameter, containing numerous seeds. It is edible to humans when ripe, but tends to have an undesirable flavour unless allowed to fully ripen in a warm climate and fall naturally from the vine, when it has a mild blackberry flavour, though with a lower sugar content than commonly eaten species.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Passiflora caerulea&quot; is widely cultivated as a wall-climber or as groundcover. Though hardy down to , it requires a sheltered position facing south or west (in the Northern Hemisphere). It can become invasive, the twining shoots constantly appearing unless eradicated. It is the only Passiflora species which volunteers in California. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Cultivars===

A number of cultivars have been produced from the species:

*&#x27;Chinensis&#x27; (corona filaments paler blue)
*&#x27;Constance Elliott&#x27; was raised by Kucombe and Prince in Exeter, Great Britain. It has pure white, fragrant flowers; not as free-flowering as many other clones. It has also won the Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society.
*&#x27;Pierre Pomie&#x27;, a pale pink flower form

==Chemical constituents==
Compared to &quot;Passiflora incarnata&quot;, this plant contains higher amounts of the MAO-inhibitor harmine.

==Uses==

Though the fruit is edible, it is rather insipid when eaten raw. A tea can be made of the flower or leaves; however, tetraphyllin B and epi-tetraphyllin B, cyanogenic glycosides which liberate hydrogen cyanide when activated by enzymes, have been found in the leaves. It is possible to boil away most of the cyanide.

In South America, the plant is known for its medicinal uses. It is used in both herbal tea and dietary supplements, as well as in marmalades, ice creams, syrups and beverages. It is also used by the indigenous Argentinian Toba and Maka people.

&quot;Passiflora caerulea&quot; is sometimes used as a rootstock, to which is grafted a scion of the edible &quot;Passiflora edulis&quot;.

The passion flower is the national flower of Paraguay. Its intricate structure has generated Christian symbolism, each part representing a different part of the Passion of Christ. The &quot;Etymology and names&quot; section of &quot;Passiflora&quot; contains more information about this symbolism.

<text>The small town of Herbert, formerly Otepopo, lies in North Otago, New Zealand, north of Dunedin and south-west of Oamaru. It lies on the edge of the Herbert Forest.

Herbert consists of a group of houses and three churches clustered around State Highway 1. A service station is also the postal agency. Two main industries operate in Herbert; an agricultural, industrial and forestry helicopter base and a poultry unit. Surrounding the settlement is rolling and fertile pastureland.
The poultry farm, Craigs Poultry, was a finalist for the 2007 Otago Ballance Farm Environment Awards.
The Main South Line also passes through Herbert, and a station existed here until its closure in 1980; only the crossing loop remains. The short 220-metre Otepopo railway tunnel is also in the vicinity.

On a north-facing site from the town was the Otepopo School. This was a primary school for children from 5 to about 13 years old. Thereafter, the children went to Oamaru for further education. Otepopo school was closed in September 2010, due to a rapid decline in the school roll. From 22 pupils in 2009, its roll had dropped to 4 before its closure.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;place of the decayed wood&quot; for &quot;Ōtepopo&quot;.

Some five kilometres south of Herbert is the farming settlement of Waianakarua. The old stone bridge at Waianakarua is the oldest that is still used by the New Zealand State Highway network. This bridge was dismantled stone by stone in 2004, and rebuilt 2 metres wider. In 2005 it was reopened as part of the State Highway network again. Alongside this bridge is an early example of a flourmill (now meals and accommodation – The Mill House]) and 3 km upstream from the bridge is an historical site of another early flourmill, alongside the remains of a dam. Among Waianakarua&#x27;s more well-known landmarks is &quot;The Big Chicken&quot;, a topiary bird standing several metres tall, next to which is a Moeraki boulder &quot;egg&quot;.

The son of Burt Munro, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in the film &quot;The World&#x27;s Fastest Indian&quot;, resides in Waianakarua and has Burt&#x27;s (now famous) motorcycle among his possessions.

Pig hunting and sea and river fishing are some of the activities available in the Herbert and Waianakarua district.

Of those at least 15 years old, 12 (14.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 24 (28.6%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $22,400, compared with $31,800 nationally. 9 people (10.7%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 33 (39.3%) people were employed full-time, 15 (17.9%) were part-time, and 3 (3.6%) were unemployed.

<text>Clarence Victor Grimmett (25 December 1891 – 2 May 1980) was a New Zealand-born Australian cricketer. He was one of the finest spin bowlers of his all time and usually credited as the developer of the flipper.

==Early life in New Zealand==
Grimmett was born in Caversham, Dunedin, New Zealand, on Christmas Day 1891, leading Bill O&#x27;Reilly to say that he &quot;must have been the best Christmas present Australia ever received from that country.&quot;

A schoolmaster encouraged him to concentrate on spin bowling rather than fast bowling. He played club cricket in Wellington, and made his first-class debut for Wellington at the age of 17. At that time, New Zealand was not a Test cricketing nation, and in 1914 he moved to neighbouring Australia.

==Life in Australia==

He played club cricket in Sydney for three years. In his first match in senior cricket, he took 12 wickets for 65 runs. After marrying a Victorian, he moved to Melbourne, where he played first-class cricket for Victoria. He moved to South Australia in 1923, but it is for his performances in Test cricket for the Australian cricket team that he is best remembered.

Grimmett played 37 Tests between 1924 and 1936, taking 216 wickets at an average of 24.21. He took two five wicket hauls on debut against England in Sydney in 1925. He became the first bowler to reach the milestone of taking 200 Test wickets, and is one of only five Test bowlers who played in their first Test after the age of thirty to take more than 100 wickets, the other four being Dilip Doshi, Saeed Ajmal, Ryan Harris and Mohammed Rafique. He took an average of six wickets per match. Many wickets in the last four years of his Test career were taken bowling in tandem with fellow leg-spinner Bill O&#x27;Reilly. Grimmett remains the one of the few bowlers with career figures of over 200 wickets in fewer than 40 Tests. He held the record for the fastest bowler to take 200 wickets in Tests, doing so in his 36th match. The record stood for 82 years, until Yasir Shah of Pakistan broke that mark in December 2018.

He took a five-wicket haul on 21 occasions, seven times finishing with ten wickets or more in a match. His Test career only began when he was aged 33, and ended when he was 44, playing his last Test against South Africa in Durban. Despite taking 44 wickets in the series, and continued success in first-class cricket, he was dropped for the 1936/7 series at home against England, replaced by Frank Ward, and did not join the 1938 tour to England.

His first-class records hold a total of 1,424 wickets in 248 matches between 1911 and 1941, again at a rate close to six wickets per match. This total included 5 wicket bags on over 120 occasions and – in one performance for a touring Australian side against Yorkshire in 1930, he took 10 wickets for 37 runs off 22.3 overs, one of only a very small number of players to have claimed all of the wickets in an innings. He took 513 wickets in his 79 Sheffield Shield matches.

Grimmett was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1931, the same year as Donald Bradman. He died in Kensington Park, Adelaide, in 1980, but was posthumously inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members. On 30 September 2009, Grimmett was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1091379" wikidata="Q383509" url="?curid=1091379" title="Viking Age arms and armour">
<text>Knowledge about military technology of the Viking Age (late 8th to mid-11th century Europe) is based on relatively sparse archaeological finds, pictorial representations, and to some extent on the accounts in the Norse sagas and laws recorded in the 12th–14th centuries.

According to custom, all free Norse men were required to own weapons, and permitted to carry them at all times. Indeed, the &quot;Hávamál&quot;, purported to be sage advice given by Odin, states &quot;Don&#x27;t leave your weapons lying about behind your back in a field; you never know when you may need all of sudden your spear.&quot;

As war was the most prestigious activity in Viking Age Scandinavia, beautifully finished weapons were an important way for a warrior to display his wealth and status. A wealthy Viking would likely have a complete ensemble of a spear, a wooden shield, and either a battle axe or a sword. Battle axes were considered the &quot;normal weapon&quot; for middle class Vikings. Swords were normally reserved for the upper class and nobles. Much poetry was associated with Viking weapons. The richest might have a helmet and mail armour; these are thought to have been limited to the nobility and their professional warriors (retainers). Several layers of thick woollen clothing may have been used by poorer warriors. The average farmer was likely limited to a spear, shield, and perhaps a common axe or large knife (&quot;seax&quot;). Some would also bring their hunting bows (mostly long bows or flat bows) to use in the opening stages of battle.

== Weapons ==

=== Knife (dagger) === 
Two distinct classes of knives were in use by Vikings. The more common one was a rather plain, single edge knife of normal construction, called a . These are found in most graves, being the only weapon allowed for all, even slaves. Smaller versions served as the everyday utility tool, while longer versions were likely meant for hunting or combat or both. Weapon knives sometimes had ornamental inlays on the blade. The construction was similar to traditional Scandinavian knives. The tang ran through a more or less cylindrical handle, the blade was straight with the edge sweeping upward at the tip to meet the back of the blade in a point. The knife apparently played an important role for all Scandinavians. This is evidenced by the large number of knives found in burial sites of not just the men, but the women and the children too.
The other type was the &quot;seax&quot;. The type associated with Vikings is the so-called broken-back style &quot;seax&quot;. It was usually a bit heavier than a regular knife and served as a machete- or falchion-like arm. A wealthier man might own a larger &quot;seax&quot;, some being effectively swords. With the single edge and heavy blade, this somewhat crude weapon was relatively simple to use and produce, compared to the regular sword. A rather long tang is fitted to many examples, indicating that they may have had a longer handle for two-handed use. The smaller knife-like &quot;seaxes&quot; were likely within the fabrication ability of a common blacksmith.

The &quot;seax&quot; was in widespread use among the migration period Germanic tribes, and is even eponymous of the Saxons. It appears in Scandinavia from the 4th century, and shows a pattern of distribution from the lower Elbe (the Irminones) to Anglo-Saxon England. While its popularity on the continent declines with the end of the migration period, it remained in the British Isles where it was taken up by the Vikings. The large, sword-like &quot;seaxes&quot; are primarily found in connection with Viking settlements in England and Ireland, but do not appear very commonly in Scandinavia.

=== Sword ===

The Viking Age sword was for single-handed use to be combined with a shield, with a double edged blade length of up to . Its shape was still very much based on the Roman &quot;spatha&quot; with a tight grip, long deep fuller and no pronounced cross-guard. It was not exclusive to the Vikings, but rather was used throughout Europe.

Swords were very costly to make, and a sign of high status. Many were rarely used and some swords found in graves were probably not sturdy enough for battle or raiding, and instead were likely decorative items. Like Roman &quot;spathae&quot;, they were worn in leather-bound wooden scabbards suspended from a strap across the right shoulder. Early blades were pattern welded, a technique in which strips of wrought iron and mild steel were twisted and forged together, with the addition of a hardened edge. Later blades of homogeneous steel, imported probably from the Rhineland, many bearing inlaid makers&#x27; marks and inscriptions, such as Ingelrii or Vlfberht. Local craftsmen often added their own elaborately decorated hilts, and many swords were given names, such as Leg-biter and Gold-hilt. The sword grip was usually made of an organic material, such as wood, horn, or antler (which does not often survive for archaeological uncovering), and may well have been wound around with textile.

Owning a sword was a matter of high honour. Persons of status might own ornately decorated swords with silver accents and inlays. Most Viking warriors would own a sword as one raid was usually enough to afford a good blade. Most freemen would own a sword with &quot;goðar&quot;, &quot;jarls&quot; and sometimes richer freemen owning much more ornately decorated swords. The poor farmers would use an axe or spear instead but after a couple of raids they would then have enough to buy a sword. One sword mentioned in the &quot;Laxdæla saga&quot; was valued at half a crown, which would correspond to the value of 16 milk-cows. Constructing such weapons was a highly specialized endeavour and many sword-blades were imported from foreign lands, such as the Rhineland. Swords could take up to a month to forge and were of such high value that they were passed on from generation to generation. Often, the older the sword, the more valuable it became.

A distinct class of early single edged swords is known from Eastern Norway at the time. These had the same grips as the double edged swords, and blades of comparable length. The blades varied from long and slim, like the more common two edged swords, to somewhat heavy, giving the weapon a more cleaver-like balance. Confusingly, the same finds are sometimes classified as &quot;sabres&quot; or &quot;seaxes&quot; in English literature.

As mentioned above, a sword was so valued in Norse society that good blades were prized by successive generations of warriors. There is even some evidence from Viking burials for the deliberate and possibly ritual &quot;killing&quot; of swords, which involved the blade being bent so that it was unusable. Because Vikings were often buried with their weapons, the &quot;killing&quot; of swords may have served two functions, namely a ritualistic function in retiring a weapon with a warrior, and a practical one in deterring any grave robbers from disturbing the burial in order to get one of these costly weapons. Indeed, archaeological finds of the bent and brittle pieces of metal sword remains testify to the regular burial of Vikings with weapons, as well as the habitual &quot;killing&quot; of swords.

=== Axe ===
 The most common hand weapon among Vikings was the axe – swords were more expensive to make and only wealthy warriors could afford them. The prevalence of axes in archaeological sites can likely be attributed to its role as not just a weapon, but also a common tool. This is supported by the large number of grave sites of female Scandinavians containing axes. Several types of larger axes specialized for use in battle evolved, with larger heads and longer shafts, including various types of bearded axes. The larger forms were as long as a man and made to be used with both hands, called the Dane Axe. Some axe heads were inlaid with silver designs. In the later Viking era, there were axe heads with crescent shaped edges measuring up to called &quot;breiðöx&quot; (broadaxe). The double-bitted axes depicted in modern &quot;Viking&quot; art would have been very rare as it used more material and was seen as a waste during hard times, if they existed at all. No surviving examples, authentic artwork or clear descriptions from records support the existence of double-bitted axes used by Vikings. Double-bitted axes were not forged by the Norse. Just about every axe they forged was single headed.

Vikings most commonly carried sturdy axes that could be thrown or swung with head-splitting force. The Mammen Axe is a famous example of such battle-axes, ideally suited for throwing and melee combat.

An axe head was mostly wrought iron, with a steel cutting edge. This made the weapon less expensive than a sword, and was a standard item produced by blacksmiths, historically.

Like most other Scandinavian weaponry, axes were often given names. According to Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, axes were often named after she-trolls.

=== Spear ===

The spear was the most common weapon of the Scandinavian peasant class. Throwing spears were constantly used by the warrior class; despite popular belief, it was also the principal weapon of the Viking warrior, an apt fit to their formations and tactics. They consisted of metal heads with a blade and a hollow shaft, mounted on wooden shafts of two to three metres in length, and were typically made from ash wood. The spear heads could measure between twenty and sixty centimetres with a tendency towards longer heads in the later Viking Age. Spear heads with wings are called &quot;krókspjót&quot; (hooked spear) in the sagas. Some larger-headed spears were called &quot;höggspjót&quot; (chopping spear) and could also be used for cutting. The barbed throwing spears were often less decorated than the ostentatious thrusting spears, as the throwing spears were often lost in battle.

The spear was used both as a throwing weapon and as a thrusting weapon, although there was some specialization in design. Lighter, narrower spearheads were made for throwing; heavier broader ones, for stabbing.
Most evidence indicates that they were used in one hand. Limited evidence from a saga indicates that they may have been used with two hands, but not in battle. The head was held in place with a pin, which saga characters occasionally pull out to prevent a foe from re-using the weapon.

Compared with a sword, the spear can be made with inferior steel and far less metal overall. This made the weapon cheaper and probably within the capability of a common blacksmith to produce. Despite this, the spear held great cultural significance to the Viking warrior, as the primary weapon of Odin, the king of the Norse gods and the god of warfare, was the spear Gungnir. The &quot;Eyrbyggja saga&quot; alludes that a customary start to a battle included throwing a spear right over the enemy army to claim it for Odin. Possibly due to its cultural significance, pattern welded blades are common in spear heads, and the sockets were often decorated with silver inlaid patterns.

=== Other polearms ===

A polearm known as the &quot;atgeir&quot; is mentioned in several sagas of Icelanders and other literature. &quot;Atgeir&quot; is usually translated as &quot;halberd&quot;, akin to a glaive. Gunnar Hámundarson is described in &quot;Njáls saga&quot; as cutting and impaling foes on his &quot;atgeir&quot;.

Several weapons (including the &quot;kesja&quot; and the &quot;höggspjót&quot;) appearing in the sagas are Viking halberds. No weapon matching their descriptions have been found in graves. These weapons may have been rare, or may not have been part of the funerary customs of the Vikings. A more likely explanation however is that these polearms are descriptions of early medieval weapons that have been added into the sagas; likely because they were written down during the same period.

=== Sling ===
The Viking age sling was easy to manufacture, consisting of a rope and sometimes a leather cup to assist with loading, giving many of the lower class access to a formidable weapon. Slingers make effective light infantry due to their lack of heavy equipment and open formation, and the concussive effect of slingstones even through metal armour.

=== Bows and arrows ===

The bow and arrow was used for both hunting and warfare. They were made from yew, ash or elm. The draw force of a 10th-century bow may have reached some 90 pounds force (400 N) or more, resulting in an effective range of at least depending on the weight of the arrow. A yew bow found at Viking Hedeby, which probably was a full-fledged war bow, had a draw force of well over 100 pounds. Replica bows using the original dimensions have been measured to between draw weight. A unit of length used in the Viking Age called a bow shot corresponded to what was later measured as . Illustrations from the time show bows being pulled back to the chest, rather than to the corner of the mouth or under the chin, as is common today.

Arrowheads were typically made from iron and produced in various shapes and dimensions, according to place of origin. Most arrowheads were fixed onto the arrow shaft by a shouldered tang that was fitted into the end of a shaft of wood. Some heads were also made of wood, bone or antler. Evidence for eagle feather flights has been found with the feathers being bound and glued on. The end of the shaft was flared with shallow self nocks, although some arrows possessed bronze cast nocks. The historical record also indicates that Vikings may have used barbed arrows, but the archaeological evidence for such technology is limited.

The earliest find of these relics were found in Denmark, seemingly belonging to the leading-warrior class based on the graves in which they were found.

== Shields ==
=== Round shields ===
The shield was the most common means of defence. The sagas specifically mention linden wood for shield construction, although finds from graves show mostly other timbers, such as fir, alder and poplar with steel or iron shield boss. These timbers are not very dense and are light in the hand. They are also not inclined to split, unlike oak. Also, the fibres of the timber bind around blades preventing the blade from cutting any deeper unless a lot more pressure is applied. In conjunction with stronger wood, Vikings often reinforced their shields with leather or, occasionally, iron around the rim. Round shields seem to have varied in size from around in diameter but is by far the most common.

The smaller shield sizes came from the pagan period for the Saxons and the larger sizes from the 10th and 11th centuries. Most shields are shown in illuminations as being painted a single colour although some have a design painted onto them; the most common designs are simple crosses or derivations of sun wheels or segments. The few round shields that survived have much more complicated designs painted on them and sometimes very ornate silver and gold work applied around the boss and the strap anchors.

The Gokstad ship has places for shields to be hung on its railing and the Gokstad shields have holes along the rim for fastening some sort of non-metallic rim protection. These were called shield lists and they protected ship crews from waves and the wind. Some Viking shields may have been decorated by simple patterns although some skaldic poems praising shields might indicate more elaborate decoration and archaeological evidence has supported this. In fact, there is a complete subgenre of Skaldic poetry dedicated to shields, known as &quot;shield poems&quot;, that describe scenes painted on shields. For example, the late-9th-century skaldic poem, &quot;Ragnarsdrápa&quot;, describes some shields painted with mythological scenes. Viking shields were also heavily used in formations. The shield wall or &quot;skjaldborg&quot; was a main formation in which accomplished Viking warriors would create a line of interlocked shields and thrust spears at adversaries. Other notable tactics included the &quot;svinfylking&quot; &quot;boar battle formation&quot;, in which warriors would create a wedge configuration and attempt to burst through the front line of nearby foes.

=== Kite shields ===
It has been proposed that the medieval era &quot;kite shield&quot; favoured by the Normans was introduced to Europe by the Vikings. However, no documentation or remains of kite shields from the Viking period have been located by archaeologists, and the idea has been discarded.

It is commonly admitted that the kite shield originated in the Byzantine Empire, from where it quickly spread to Western Europe, where it was notably used by Franks. Eleventh century Normans most probably ended up using kite shield as result of their close cultural ties with Western Franks, who are also the origin of the Normans&#x27; famous nasal helmet, hauberk, and heavy cavalry tactics.

== Armor ==

=== Helmet ===

The remains of six helmets from the Viking Age are known to exist:

* the Tjele helmet fragment;
* two fragments from Gotland;
* one fragment from Kyiv;
* the Gjermundbu helmet;
* the Yarm helmet, found in Yarm, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, England.

Of the four helmet fragments found in Scandinavia, only the remains from Gjermundbu were of use in significant reconstruction.

The Gjermundbu helmet dates to the 10th century. It was excavated on a farm called Gjermundbu in Ringerike in central Norway. Gjermundbu is located in Haugsbygd, a village in northeast of Hønefoss, in Buskerud, Norway. This helmet was made of iron from four plates after the spangenhelm pattern. This helmet has a rounded cap, and there is evidence that it also may have had a mail aventail. It has a &quot;spectacle&quot; guard around the eyes and nose which formed a sort of mask, which suggests a close affinity with the earlier Vendel Period helmets.

The Yarm helmet was discovered in the 1950s by workmen digging pipe trenches in Chapel Yard, Yarm, near the River Tees. Research led by Chris Caple of Durham University, and published in 2020, established that the helmet dates to the 10th century. This helmet is made of iron bands and plates, riveted together, with a simple knop at the top. Below the brow band it has a &quot;spectacle&quot; guard around the eyes and nose forming a sort of mask, which suggests an affinity with earlier Vendel Period helmets. The lower edge of the brow band is pierced with circular holes, where a mail curtain (or aventail) may have been attached.

From runestones and other illustrations, it is known that the Vikings also wore simpler helmets, often caps with a simple noseguard. Research indicates that Vikings may have only rarely used metal helmets. Helmets with metal horns, presumably for ceremonial use, are known from the Nordic Bronze Age, 2,000 years prior to the Viking Age.

Despite popular culture, there is no evidence that Vikings used horned helmets in battle as such horns would be impractical in a melee, but it is possible that horned head dresses were used in ritual contexts. The horned and winged helmets associated with the Vikings in popular mythology were the invention of 19th-century Romanticism. The horned helmet may have been introduced in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; operas (set in Germany): The male chorus wore horned helmets, while the other characters had winged helmets.

===Chain mail ===
Once again, a single fragmented but possibly complete mail shirt has been excavated in Scandinavia, from the same site as the helmet—Gjermundbu in Haugsbygd. Scandinavian Viking Age burial customs seems to not favour burial with helmet or mail armour, in contrast to earlier extensive armour burials in Sweden Valsgärde or possibly only a small amount of Vikings could afford it. Probably worn over thick clothing, a mail shirt protected the wearer from being cut, but offered little protection from blunt trauma and stabbing attacks from a sharp point such as that of a spear. The difficulty of obtaining mail armour resided in the fact that it required thousands of interlinked iron rings, each one of which had to be individually riveted together by hand. As a result, mail was very expensive in early medieval Europe, and would likely have been worn by men of status and wealth.

Hjortspring boat contained several incomplete suits of mail.

The mail worn by Vikings was almost certainly the &quot;four-on-one&quot; type, where four solid (punched or riveted) rings are connected by a single riveted ring. Mail of this type is known as a &quot;&quot; from Old Norse &quot;brynja&quot;. Given scarcity of archeological evidence for Viking armor and the fact that Vikings on a raid tried to avoid pitched battles, it&#x27;s possible that mail was primarily worn only by the professional warriors going into battle, such as the Great Heathen Army of the mid-9th century in England or at Harald Hardrada&#x27;s invasion of Northumbria at the Battle of Fulford in 1066, and wealthy nobles.

=== Lamellar ===
More than 30 &quot;lamellae&quot; (individual plates for lamellar armour) were found in Birka, Sweden, in 1877, 1934 and 1998–2000. They were dated to the same approximate period as the Gjermundbu mailshirt (900‒950) and may be evidence that some Vikings wore this armour, which is a series of small iron plates laced together or sewed to a stout fabric or leather cats shirt. There is considerable debate however as to whether the lamellae in question were in the possession of a Scandinavian resident or a foreign mercenary.

=== Cloth and leather ===

Quilted cloth (a gambeson) is conjectured as possible options for lower-status Viking warriors, though no reference to such are known from the sagas. Such materials survive poorly in graves, and no archaeological finds have been made. Some runestones depict what appears to be armour which is likely not chain mail. The armour in question may have been the lamellar armour mentioned above, or may not have been armour at all. Several layers of stout linen or hemp canvas would provide a good level of protection, at reasonable expense, as would winter clothing made from thick woollen cloth. Practical experience with maille also suggests an undergarment of some sort would have been worn between the maille and the regular tunic, to protect the latter from dirt and excessive wear, but the descriptions of the effect of axes in the Sagas indicate such garments were lightly padded if at all.

Leather was far pricier during the period than today and thus less affordable for the casual warrior. In the &quot;Legendary Saga of St. Olaf&quot;, the kingsbane Thorir Hund is said to have worn a tunic made from reindeer fur, enchanted by &quot;Finns&quot; (Sámi), defending him from sword blows. The tunic is described as &quot;magically&quot; enhanced which may indicate that it may not represent a typical example of such a garment. Leather clothing does, however, occasionally turn up in archaeological finds, and would have offered some degree of protection in combat.

All in all, the case for non-metal forms of armour remains inconclusive. It is likely that the average Viking fought whilst wearing ordinary clothing, with the shield as the only form of protection.

== Foreign origins of Viking arms and armour ==

A number of foreign-made, specifically Frankish, weapons and armour have been found in Scandinavia. Norsemen attained them first through trade, and after Frankish bans on the sale of weapons, as plunder. Their possession and display by any individual would signify their station in the social hierarchy and any political allegiances they had. 

Although local sources provided useful raw iron, e.g. free from sulfur and phosphorus, while containing manganese and nickel, during the 10th century Frankish swordsmiths developed superior steels. Frankish swords like the VLFBERHT had a higher carbon content, making them more durable, and their design was much more manoeuvrable compared to Scandinavian made swords. Although smaller weapons like daggers, knives, and arrowheads could be manufactured in Scandinavia, the best swords and spearheads were undoubtedly imported. Nevertheless, of the more than 3000 viking swords found in Norway alone, only some 170 swords are of undisputed Frankish origin. (ref TP)

Many of the most important Viking weapons were highly ornate—decorated lavishly with gold and silver. Weapons adorned as such served large religious and social functions. These precious metals were not produced in Scandinavia and they too would have been imported. Once in Scandinavia, the precious metals would have been inlaid in the pommels and blades of weapons creating geometric patterns, depictions of animals, and (later) Christian symbols.

Vikings also used foreign armour. According to &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, one hundred Vikings appeared &quot;in coats of ring-mail, and in foreign helmets&quot; at the Battle of Nesjar in 1016.

During the mid-9th century, there was an influx of these high-quality weapons into Scandinavia, and Frankish arms became the standard for all Vikings. As Ahmad ibn Fadlan observed in his account of his journey to Russia, every Viking carried a &quot;sword of the Frankish type&quot;. The Franks attempted to limit the Vikings&#x27; use of weapons and armour produced in Francia—fearing that they would eventually face equally armed opponents. Chapter 10 of the &quot;Capitulare Bononiense&quot; of 811 made it illegal for any clerical functionary to supply swords or armour to non-Frankish individuals. Laws like this were enacted throughout Francia. Ultimately, in 864, King Charles the Bald of West Francia made the practice punishable by death.

Some scholars have proposed that such laws proved so effective at stemming the flow of Frankish weapons that they initiated the practice of raiding for which Vikings became notorious.

== Viking Weapon Quality and Decoration ==
Viking weapons were not only functional tools for warfare but also symbols of status and prestige as mentioned above. The quality and decoration of the Vikings weapons were integral to their value, both on the battlefield and in the context of social relationships. Weapons with elegant shapes and noble metal ornamentation not only provided their owner with an effective tool in combat but also served as valuable gifts often being exchanged to build political alliances. Well-crafted weapons were a reflection of a Viking’s wealth, prestige, and social status.

=== Quality of Viking Weapons ===
A good Viking weapon was expected to meet certain practical standards, including a sharp, durable edge and optimal balance. Balance is crucial to the heft of any weapon: in swords, the centre of mass must be close to the handle, otherwise the weapon would be unwieldy when going blow for blow in battle. A sword, for instance, was prized for its flexibility and ability to maintain its sharpness and shape under stress. A blade that could easily bend in battle was known as a &quot;deigr&quot;, a term akin to the modern Norwegian word for &#x27;dough&#x27;. The ideal sword blade was elastic and able to bend and return to its original shape without suffering a permanent bend or break. Several medieval sources, such as &quot;Svarfdæla saga&quot; and &quot;Ásmund Kæmpebanes saga&quot;, describe the ultimate test for a sword&#x27;s quality: bending the point of the blade back to touch the hilt, then allowing it to spring back without sustaining any permanent deformation. This demonstrated the high value placed on elasticity and resilience in Viking weaponry.

=== Decoration and Ornamentation ===
While functionality was important, the appearance of Viking weapons was also of great meaning. Decorative elements on weapons and armour not only enhanced the visual appeal of a weapon but also gave it symbolic meanings representing power and the owner&#x27;s status. As mentioned above, Viking shields were occasionally decorated with paintings and poetry. The commonest designs on shields were simple crosses or derivations of sun wheels or segments. Elegant designs on their weapons would sometimes feature precious metals like copper or silver as well adding a layer of artistry to their warrior identity. Weapons that had intricate patterns or engravings were seen as prestigious and were often used in diplomatic exchanges or as gifts to cement political relationships.

The technique of pattern forging was a key method used to decorate primarily swords, spears, and knives. This technique involved the forging of two, three, or sometimes four twisted iron bars, which were laid parallel to one another and then welded together. After this, the laminated blade would feature a distinctive pattern with a decorative design covering the blade&#x27;s surface, including the fuller (the central groove running along the blade). Notably, the cutting edge of the blade always remained undecorated. This was to ensure that it retained its functionality while still showcasing the craftsmanship of the smith. This decorative pattern forging was typically not applied to axes, which remained more basic in design.

Pattern-forged sword blades had already been in use in Europe centuries before the Viking Age but reached their peak during this period. After the Viking Age, the widespread use of pattern forging declined, making these swords a distinctive feature of Viking weaponry. The intricacy of the patterns that were forged into their blades made these swords highly prized, and became major items of value in Viking society.

==Change of era==
* 1555 : The era name was changed to mark an event or a number of events. The old era ended and a new once commenced in &quot;Tenbun&quot; 24.

The name originates from the following Chinese passage: 「祇承宝命、志弘治体」.

==Events of the &quot;Kōji&quot; era==
* 1555 (&quot;Kōji 1, 1st month&quot;): A border war began between Mōri Motonari, &quot;daimyō&quot; of Aki Province, and Sue Harukata, daimyō of Suō Province.
* 1555 (&quot;Kōji 1, 11th month&quot;): The Mōri forces surrounded the Sue defenders in the Battle of Itsukushima. When the outcome of the battle became clear, Sue Harutaka committed suicide; and others, including Odomo-no Yoshinaga, followed Harutaka in suicide. This victory, and the subsequent consolidation of the Mōri holdings were owing to Motonari&#x27;s four sons: Mōri Takamoto, Kikkawa Motoharu, Hoda Motokiyo, and Kobayakawa Takakage.
* 1555 (&quot;Kōji 1&quot;): The forces of Takeda Shingen and Uesugi Kenshin met at the confluence of the Saigawa and the Chikumagawa in Shinano Province; and the fighting was known as the Battles of Kawanakajima.
* 1556 (&quot;Kōji 2&quot;): The Ōmori silver mine fell into the control of the Mōri clan during a campaign in Iwami Province.
* September 27, 1557 (&quot;Kōji 3, 5th day of the 9th month&quot;): Emperor Go-Nara died at age 62.

<text>John Lyon School (prior to 1965 The Lower School of John Lyon) is an academically selective private co-educational day school for pupils aged 3 to 18 in Harrow on the Hill, Greater London, England.

The school was founded in 1876, by the Governors of Harrow School for the education of local boys, in keeping with the belated wishes of John Lyon, Harrow School&#x27;s founder. The school is a successor to the &#x27;English Form&#x27; established in 1853, to educate local scholars. John Lyon School maintains historic ties with Harrow School, and the two schools are closely partnered being part of the &#x27;Harrow Family of Schools&#x27;. Until September 2021, it was a boys&#x27; school, becoming a mixed school for new pupils aged 11 and ending its single-sex school status at this time. The school is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference (HMC). As of 2023, the school charges fees of around £20,000 per year; however, some academic scholarships are available to help reduce this fee.

Until 2020, John Lyon was an 11 to 18 senior independent HMC boys&#x27; day school in Harrow-on-the-Hill. In 2020, John Lyon amalgamated with what was then called Quainton Hall Prep, located in central Harrow, to become an all-through School. The School became co-educational and welcomed its first cohort of girls in September 2021. From January 2024, Quainton Hall Preparatory School was rebranded as a constituent part of the John Lyon School.


==Structure and curriculum==
The governing body of Harrow School retains some control of the John Lyon School; most responsibilities, however, are delegated to a John Lyon board of governors (officially styled &quot;Committee of Management&quot;). A number of Harrow governors serve on this committee, alongside co-opted governors. Unlike many previous governing bodies in British schools, there is no academic staff involvement in overall school government.

<text>Football in Burundi has been affected by the civil war that broke out in Burundi. Before that, Burundi football had been doing well. Football is the most popular sport in Burundi.

==History==
The football club Vital&#x27;O reached the final of the most prestigious African competition; Inter FC and reached the semifinals.

Just two nights before the war broke out in Burundi, the national team was in Guinea to play the host in the second leg of the playoffs to qualify for the African Nations Cup. The Burundian youth team reached the semi-final of the African Nations Youth Cup as well as qualifying in the World Youth Championship in Qatar.

In the Homeless World Cup, Burundi won the 2006 INSP Trophy, defeating Argentina in the final.

Saido Berahino is the most famous Burundian footballer.

<doc id="1091403" wikidata="Q700719" url="?curid=1091403" title="Nakajima Ki-84">
<text>The is a single-seat fighter flown by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service in the last two years of World War II. The Allied reporting name was &quot;Frank&quot;; the Japanese Army designation was . The Ki-84 is generally considered the best Japanese fighter to operate in large numbers during the conflict. The aircraft boasted high speed and excellent maneuverability with an armament (up to two 30 mm and two 20 mm cannon) that gave it formidable firepower. The Ki-84&#x27;s performance matched that of any single-engine Allied fighter it faced, and its operational ceiling enabled it to intercept high-flying B-29 Superfortress bombers. Pilots and crews in the field learned to take care with the plane&#x27;s high-maintenance Nakajima Homare engine and landing gear prone to buckling. The difficulties of Japan&#x27;s situation late in the war took a toll on the aircraft&#x27;s field performance as manufacturing defects multiplied, good quality fuel proved difficult to procure, and experienced pilots grew scarce. Nevertheless, a well-maintained Ki-84 was Japan&#x27;s fastest fighter. A total of 3,514 aircraft were built.

==Design and development==
Design of the Ki-84 commenced in early 1942 to meet an Imperial Japanese Army Air Service requirement for a replacement to Nakajima&#x27;s own, earlier Ki-43 fighter, then just entering service. The specification recognized the need to combine the maneuverability of the Ki-43 with performance to match the best western fighters, and heavy firepower. The Ki-84 first flew in March 1943 and deliveries from Nakajima&#x27;s Ota factory commenced the following month. Although the design was itself solid, growing difficulties in securing skilled pilots, proper fuel and construction materials, and adequate manufacture often prevented the aircraft from reaching its full potential in the field.

The design of the Ki-84 addressed the most common complaints about the popular and highly maneuverable Ki-43: insufficient firepower, poor defensive armor, and lack of climbing speed. The Ki-84 was a cantilever low-wing monoplane of all-metal construction, except for the fabric-covered control surfaces, with conventional landing gear.
Armament comprised two fuselage-mounted, synchronized 12.7 mm (.50 in) machine guns — these proved challenging to synchronize properly with the &quot;Hayate&quot;&#x27;s four-blade propeller — and two wing-mounted 20 mm cannon, a considerable improvement over the two 12.7 mm (.50 in) machine guns used in the Ki-43 &quot;Hayabusa&quot;. Defensive armor offered &quot;Hayate&quot; pilots better protection than the unsealed wing tanks and light-alloy airframe of the Ki-43. In addition, the Ki-84 used a 65 mm (2.56 in) armor-glass canopy, 13 mm (.51 in) of head and back armor, and multiple bulkheads in the fuselage, which protected both the methanol-water tank (used to increase the effectiveness of the supercharger) and the centrally located fuel tank.

It was the Nakajima firm&#x27;s own-designed displacement, Ha-45 Homare (&quot;Praise&quot; or &quot;Honor&quot;) air-cooled eighteen-cylinder radial engine, first accepted for military use in 1941, that gave the &quot;Hayate&quot; its high speed and prowess in combat. Derived from the Nakajima Homare engines common to many Japanese aircraft, the &quot;Hayate&quot; used several versions of the Homare engine, including the carbureted model 21 and the fuel-injected model 23 versions of the engine. Most Homare engines used water injection to aid the supercharger in giving the Ki-84 a rated 1,491 kW (2,000 hp) at takeoff. This combination theoretically gave it a climb rate and top speed roughly competitive with the top Allied fighters. Initial &quot;Hayate&quot; testing at Tachikawa in early summer 1943 saw test pilot Lieutenant Funabashi reach a maximum level airspeed of 624 km/h (387 mph) in the second prototype. In 1946, US Technical Intelligence bench-tested a Homare 45, Model 21 engine and verified the engine&#x27;s maximum horsepower output using 96 octane AvGas, plus methanol injection.

The complicated Ha-45-21 carbureted engine was a compact design (only larger in diameter than the Ki-43&#x27;s 14-cylinder Nakajima Sakae radial) that required a great deal of care in construction and maintenance and it became increasingly difficult to maintain the type&#x27;s designed performance as the Allies advanced toward the Japanese homeland. To compound reliability problems, the Allied submarine blockade prevented delivery of crucial components, such as the landing gear. Many landing gear units were compromised by the poor-quality heat treatment of late-war Japanese steel. As a result, many &quot;Hayate&quot;s suffered strut collapses on landing. Further damage was caused by inadequately trained late war pilots, who sometimes found it difficult to transition to the relatively &quot;hot&quot; Ki-84 from the comparatively docile Ki-43, which had a significantly lower landing speed.

==Operational service==
The first major operational involvement was during the Battle of Leyte at the end of 1944, and, from that moment until the end of the Pacific War, the Ki-84 was deployed wherever the action was intense. The 22nd Sentai was re-equipped with production &quot;Hayate&quot;s. Though it lacked sufficient high-altitude performance, it performed well at medium and low levels. Seeing action against the USAAF 14th Air Force, it quickly gained a reputation as a combat aircraft to be reckoned with. Fighter-bomber models also entered service. On April 15, 1945, eleven &quot;Hayate&quot;s attacked US airfields on Okinawa, destroying many aircraft on the ground.

In the final year of the war, the Ki-84, the Ki-100 (essentially a radial-engined version of the inline-powered Kawasaki Ki-61), and Kawanishi&#x27;s N1K2-J were the three Japanese fighters best suited to combat the newer Allied fighters.

==Variants==

* Ki-84-a: Prototype.
* Ki-84-b: Evaluation model.
* Ki-84-c: Pre-production model.
* Ki-84-I Ko: Armed with 2 × 12.7 mm Ho-103 machine guns &lt;br&gt;and 2 × 20mm Ho-5 cannons in wings (most widely produced version).
* Ki-84-I Otsu: Armed with 4 × 20 mm Ho-5 cannon. &lt;br&gt;(Limited production run, may not have equipped a full Sentai)
* Ki-84-I Hei: Armed with 2 × 20 mm Ho-5 cannon and 2 × 30 mm Ho-155 cannon in wings.
* Ki-84-I Tei: Night fighter variant of Ki-84 Otsu. Equipped with an additional Ho-5 20 mm cannon (300 shells) placed at 45-degree angle behind the cockpit in Schräge Musik configuration. Rare variant, two built.
* Ki-84-I Ko - Manshu Type: Manufactured in Manchukuo for Manshūkoku Hikōki Seizo KK by Nakajima License.
* Ki-84-II: Sometimes known as the &#x27;Hayate-Kai&#x27;, the Ki-84-II had certain duralumin components replaced with ones made of wood and plywood, mainly concerning the rear fuselage, tail unit elements, wing tips, push-pull rods and other, minor components. This model was produced with the designations Ko, Otsu and Hei depending on the armament.
* Ki-84-III: A planned conversion of the Ki-84 into a high-attitude interceptor after development of the Ki-87 prototype was delayed. Replaced the Homare engine with a 2450 hp Nakajima Ha-44 12 Ru air cooled radial engine with a turbo-supercharger mounted under the fuselage. The airframe remained unchanged, aside from the engine mountings to support the larger diameter engine. The airplane did not progress beyond the design stage.
* Ki-84 Sa Go: Oxygen injection system replacing the traditional water-methanol injection system to improve high attitude performance. No prototypes were built.
* Ki-84-N: 1st high-altitude interceptor variant of the Ki-84, with a 2500 hp Nakajima Ha-219 air cooled radial engine and with wing area increased to 249.19 square feet. The Ki-84-N production model was assigned to the &quot;Kitai&quot; &#x27;Ki-117&#x27;. Neither aircraft left the design stage before the war&#x27;s end. 
* Ki-84-P: 2nd high-altitude interceptor variant of the Ki-84, with a 2500 hp Nakajima Ha-219 air cooled radial engine and with wing area increased to 263.4 square feet. Cancelled in favor of further development of the Ki-84-R, which was proving to be a less ambitious project. 
* Ki-84-R: 3rd high-altitude interceptor variant of the Ki-84, with a 2000 hp Nakajima Ha-45-44 with a mechanically driven two-stage three-speed supercharger. The prototype was 80% completed at war&#x27;s end.
* Ki-106: Prototype, constructed mainly out of wood. Three built.
* Ki-113: Based on the Ki-84 Otsu, with certain steel components on different areas of the aircraft. The project was an attempt to sustain light alloys, which were becoming very scarce later in the war. It employed steel sheet skinning and the cockpit section, ribs, and bulkheads were made of carbon steel.
* Ki-116: Evaluation model, equipped with a Mitsubishi Ha-112-II (Ha-33-62), 1,120 kW (1,500 hp). One built.
* Ki-117: Production designation of the Ki-84N.

==Production==
Not included:
* Pre-production started with two prototypes completed in March and April 1943. 
* A further 94 Ki-84-I Ko&#x27;s were assembled at Mansyu Hikoki Seizo K.K. aircraft plant in Harbin.

==Operators==
Wartime
* Imperial Japanese Army Air Service

Post-war
* People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force operated captured aircraft from 1945 until the 1950s.
* Chinese Nationalist Air Force held some Ki-84 in reserve in case American aid was cut.
* Indonesian Air Force - In 1945, Indonesian People&#x27;s Security Force (IPSF) (Indonesian pro-independence guerrillas) captured a small number of aircraft at numerous Japanese air bases, including Bugis Air Base in Malang (repatriated 18 September 1945). Most aircraft were destroyed in military conflicts between the Netherlands and the newly proclaimed Republic of Indonesia during the Indonesian National Revolution of 1945–1949.

==Surviving aircraft==
After the war a number of aircraft were tested by the allied forces, two at the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit - South-West Pacific Area (ATAIU-SWPA) as S10 and S17 and a further two in the United States as FE-301 and FE-302 (Later T2-301 and T2-302).

One example captured at Clark Field during 1945, serial number 1446, was transported aboard the USS &quot;Long Island&quot; aircraft carrier to the United States. In 1952 it was sold off as surplus to Edward Maloney, owner of the Ontario Air Museum (Planes of Fame Air Museum) and restored to flying condition before being returned to Japan for display at the Arashiyama Museum in Kyoto in 1973. With unsupervised access allowed to the aircraft, parts were stolen from the Ki-84, and coupled with the years of neglect it could no longer fly. Following the museum&#x27;s closure in 1991, the aircraft was transferred to the Tokko Heiwa Kinen-kan Museum, Kagoshima Prefecture, where it still is displayed to this day. It is the only surviving Ki-84.

<text>West Los Angeles is an area within the city of Los Angeles, California, United States. The residential and commercial neighborhood is divided by the Interstate 405 freeway, and each side is sometimes treated as a distinct neighborhood, mapped differently by different sources. Each lies within the larger Westside region of Los Angeles County.

==Geography==

===West Los Angeles Community Plan===
The West Los Angeles Community Plan area recognized by the city of Los Angeles is generally bounded by Centinela Avenue on the west; Wilshire Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard on the north; National Boulevard, Pico Boulevard, and Exposition Boulevard on the south; and Durango Avenue, Robertson Boulevard, and Canfield Avenue on the east. Among the neighborhoods included within it are Sawtelle, Rancho Park, Beverlywood, Cheviot Hills, Castle Heights, and Century City. The Community Plan area itself is part of the larger West Los Angeles Area Plan Commission area (i.e., the Westside region).

===Automobile Club of Southern California===
The Automobile Club of Southern California does not mark boundaries on its map, but centers the neighborhood of West Los Angeles proper as south of Santa Monica Boulevard, west of Interstate 405, north of Olympic Boulevard and east of Barrington Avenue. The borders of the official West Los Angeles Neighborhood Council correspond closely to this definition. Specifically, its district stretches from the 405 freeway in the east to Centinela Avenue in the west and Wilshire Boulevard in the north and the 10 freeway in the south. This is roughly the same area labeled as &quot;Sawtelle&quot; in the Mapping L.A. website of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

===The Los Angeles Times===
In 2003, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; correspondent noted:
The meaning of the term West Los Angeles varies widely. Some use it to describe the entire Westside including Santa Monica, Venice and stretching east to Western Avenue. More precisely, though, it is the portion of incorporated Los Angeles between the Santa Monica city limits on the west, Wilshire Boulevard on the north, Century City to the east and extending just beyond National Boulevard on the south. Sections of West L.A. run the gamut from stylish Cheviot Hills to a cluster of generic homes east of Bundy Drive.

That report on the meaning of West Los Angeles also included Rancho Park, located at Pico and Beverly Glen, and the Westdale Trousdale area near National Boulevard and Barrington Avenue.

===City of Los Angeles===

The 2004 &quot;City of Los Angeles &amp; Communities&quot; map by the Los Angeles Almanac shows West Los Angeles as a neighborhood south of Santa Monica Boulevard and north of Culver City. West Los Angeles is book-ended with Mid-City, Mid-City West and Mid-Wilshire on the east and Sawtelle on the west. Century City, Rancho Park, and Cheviot Hills are shown (without boundaries) as sub-neighborhoods in West Los Angeles.

Together, the areas east and west of Sepulveda Boulevard/I-405 comprise a large portion of the official West Los Angeles Community Plan area.

===Frommer&#x27;s Guide===

The Frommer&#x27;s Guide described West Los Angeles as &quot;a label that generally applies to everything that isn&#x27;t one of the other Westside neighborhoods.&quot; It lies &quot;south of Santa Monica Boulevard, north of Venice Boulevard, east of Santa Monica and Venice, and west and south of Century City.

===Mapping L.A.===
In 2009, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Mapping L.A. project defined West Los Angeles as south of Santa Monica Boulevard, west of Beverly Glen Boulevard, north of Pico Boulevard and east of Sepulveda Boulevard. Profiling the neighborhood in 2018, the &quot;Times&quot; described it as follows: 
Nowadays, West L.A. is a marooned rump of the once-mighty West Los Angeles of old, which stretched from Century City to the Santa Monica city limits, and which has atomized over the years into a handful of disparate neighborhoods. ... Many people assume West Los Angeles refers to all that lies between the sea and Robertson Boulevard (or wherever their own arbitrary border of central Los Angeles lies). But it is its own place, not just a toponym to be used interchangeably with &quot;the Westside.&quot;

<text>The Dahomey Amazons (Fon: Agojie, Agoji, Mino, or Minon) were a Fon all-female military regiment of the Kingdom of Dahomey (in today&#x27;s Benin, West Africa) that existed from the 17th century until the late 19th century. They were the only female army in modern history. They were named Amazons by Western Europeans who encountered them, due to the story of the female warriors of Amazons in Greek mythology. 

The emergence of an all-female military regiment was the result of Dahomey&#x27;s male population facing high casualties in the increasingly frequent violence and warfare with neighbouring West African states. This led to Dahomey being one of the leading states in the slave trade with the Oyo Empire, which used slaves for commodity exchange in West Africa until the slave trade in the region ended. The lack of men likely led the kings of Dahomey to recruit women into the army. The formation of a female-only army unit was a retaliation and maneuver around the forced tribute of male slaves to Oyo each year.

== Origin ==

King Houegbadja (who ruled from 1645 to 1685), the third King of Dahomey, is said to have originally started the group which would later become the &quot;Mino&quot; as a corps of elephant hunters called the &quot;gbeto&quot;. The &quot;gbeto&quot; may even predate Houegbadja, as there is a tradition where he merely organized pre-existing groups into a corps, and another were the &quot;gbeto&quot; themselves offered to serve the king.

Houegbadja&#x27;s daughter Queen Hangbe (ruling from 1716 to 1718) established a female bodyguard. European merchants recorded their presence. According to tradition, her brother and successor King Agaja successfully used them in Dahomey&#x27;s defeat of the neighbouring kingdom of Savi in 1727. The group of female warriors was referred to as &quot;Mino&quot;, meaning &quot;Our Mothers&quot; in the Fon language, by the male army of Dahomey. Other sources contest the claim that King Agaja&#x27;s older sister Queen Hangbe was the ruler to establish the units, some even going so far as to question whether or not Queen Hangbe actually existed.

From the time of King Ghezo (ruling from 1818 to 1858), Dahomey became increasingly militaristic. Ghezo placed great importance on the army, increasing its budget and formalizing its structure from ceremonial to a serious military. While European narratives refer to the women soldiers as &quot;Amazons&quot;, they called themselves &quot;ahosi&quot; (king&#x27;s wives) or &quot;Mino&quot; (our mothers).

== Recruitment ==

Ghezo recruited both men and women as soldiers from foreign captives. Female soldiers were also recruited from free Dahomean women, with some enrolled from as young as eight years of age. Other accounts indicate that the &quot;Mino&quot; were recruited from among the &quot;ahosi&quot; (&quot;king&#x27;s wives&quot;), of which there were often hundreds. Some women in Fon society became soldiers voluntarily, while others were involuntarily enrolled if their husbands or fathers complained to the king about their behaviour.

Membership among the &quot;Mino&quot; was supposed to hone any aggressive character traits for the purpose of war. During their membership they were not allowed to have children or be part of married life (though they were legally married to the king). Many of them were virgins. The regiment had a semi-sacred status, which was intertwined with the Fon belief in Vodun. Oral Dahomean tradition holds that, upon recruitment, the Amazons were subjected to female genital mutilation.

The &quot;Mino&quot; trained with intense physical exercise. They learned survival skills and indifference to pain and death, storming acacia-thorn defences in military exercises and executing prisoners. Discipline was emphasised.

Serving in the &quot;Mino&quot; offered women the opportunity to &quot;rise to positions of command and influence&quot; in an environment structured for individual empowerment. The &quot;Mino&quot; were also wealthy and held high status.

== Political role ==

The &quot;Mino&quot; took a prominent role in the Grand Council, debating the policy of the kingdom. From the 1840s to 1870s (when the opposing party collapsed), the majority of &quot;Mino&quot; generally supported peace with the Egba of Abeokuta arguing instead to raid smaller, less defended tribes. This set them at odds with their male military colleagues, who supported a full-on assault of Abeokuta. Civilian council members who allied with the Agojie also advocated for stronger commercial relations with Britain, favouring the trade of palm oil above that of slaves.

Apart from the council, the Annual Customs of Dahomey included a parade and reviewing of the troops, and the troops swearing an oath to the king. The celebrations on the 27th day of the Annual Customs consisted of a mock battle in which the Agojie attacked a &quot;fort&quot; and &quot;captured&quot; the slaves within, a custom recorded by the priest Francesco Borghero in his diaries.

== Combat and structure ==

The women soldiers were rigorously trained in pain, endurance and speed. Once training was completed they were given uniforms. By the mid-19th century, they numbered between 1,000 and 6,000 women, about a third of the entire Dahomey army, according to reports written by visitors. The reports also noted that the women soldiers were consistently judged to be superior to the male soldiers in effectiveness and bravery in battle.

The women soldiers were said to be structured in parallel with the army as a whole, with a centre wing (the king&#x27;s bodyguards) flanked on both sides, each under separate commanders. Some accounts note that each male soldier had a &quot;mino&quot; counterpart. In one mid-19th-century account by an English observer, it was documented that the women who had three stripes of whitewash around each leg were honoured with marks of distinction.

The women&#x27;s army consisted of a number of regiments: huntresses, riflewomen, reapers, archers and gunners. Each regiment had different uniforms, weapons and commanders.

In the latter period, the Dahomean female warriors were armed with Winchester rifles, clubs and knives. Units were under female command. An 1851 published translation of a war chant of the women claims the warriors would chant: &quot;[a]s the blacksmith takes an iron bar and by fire changes its fashion so have we changed our nature. We are no longer women, we are men.&quot;

=== Conflict with neighbouring kingdoms ===

The Agojie battles consisted mainly within Africa against various kingdoms and tribes. During that time period it was customary that once an enemy was defeated they would be killed or enslaved. Many African tribes participated in this and Dahomey was no exception. They would often enslave their enemies and sell them to European slave traders in exchange for weaponry for battle. As early as 1728, under the direction of King Agaja, the Dahomean army conquered the kingdoms of Whydah, and Popos. In 1840, they helped to capture the fortress of the Mahee at Attahapahms. However, it was at the hands of their long-standing enemy Abeokuta that they suffered crushing defeat, resulting in many casualties.

== Conflict with France ==

=== First Franco-Dahomean War ===
The European encroachment into West Africa gained pace during the latter half of the 19th century, and in 1890 King Béhanzin started fighting French forces in the course of the First Franco-Dahomean War. European observers noted that the women &quot;handled admirably&quot; in hand-to-hand combat, but fired their flintlocks from the hip rather than firing from the shoulder.

The &quot;Mino&quot; participated in one major battle: Cotonou, where thousands of Dahomeans (including many &quot;Mino&quot;) charged the French lines and engaged the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. The &quot;Mino&quot; were decisively crushed, with several hundred Dahomey troops being gunned down. Reportedly, 129 Dahomey fighters were killed in melee combat within the French lines.

=== Second Franco-Dahomean War ===
By the end of the Second Franco-Dahomean War, special units of the &quot;Mino&quot; were being assigned specifically to target French officers. After several battles, the French prevailed in the Second Franco-Dahomean War and put an end to the independent Dahomean kingdom. French soldiers, particularly of the French Foreign Legion, were impressed by the boldness of the Amazons and later wrote about their &quot;incredible courage and audacity&quot; in combat.

Against a military unit with decidedly superior weaponry and a longer bayonet, however, the Dahomey &quot;Mino&quot; could not prevail. During a battle with French soldiers at Adegon on October 6, 1892, during the second war, the bulk of the Mino corps were wiped out in a matter of hours in hand-to-hand combat after the French engaged them with a bayonet charge. The Dahomey lost 86 regulars and 417 Dahomey Mino, with nearly all of those deaths being inflicted by bayonets; the French lost six soldiers.

== Disbandment and legacy ==

The troops were disbanded when the kingdom became a French protectorate in 1894. Oral tradition states that some surviving Mino secretly remained in Abomey afterwards, where they quietly assassinated a number of French officers. Other stories say the women pledged their services in protection of Agoli-Agbo, the brother of Béhanzin, disguising themselves as his wives in order to guard him.

Some of the women married and had children, while others remained single. According to a historian who traced the lives of almost two dozen former Mino, all the women displayed difficulties adjusting to life as retired warriors, often struggling to find new roles in their communities that gave them a sense of pride comparable to their former lives. Many displayed a tendency to start fights or arguments that frightened their neighbours and relatives.

Between 1934 and 1942, several British travellers in Abomey recorded encounters with former Mino, then old women who spun cotton or idled around courtyards. An unknown number of women are said to have trained with the members of the Dahomey Mino after they were disbanded, in effect continuing the tradition. They never saw combat. Around 2019, Lupita Nyong&#x27;o interviewed one of these who was still alive, for the TV documentary &quot;Warrior Women with Lupita Nyong&#x27;o&quot;.

=== Nawi, the last Dahomey Mino ===

The last survivor of the Dahomey Mino is thought to have been a woman named Nawi. In a 1978 interview in the village of Kinta, a Beninese historian met Nawi, who claimed to have fought the French in 1892. Nawi died in November 1979, aged well over 100.

== In popular culture ==
Dahomey Mino are mentioned in the sci-fi novel &quot;Robur the Conqueror&quot; (1886) by Jules Verne (Chapter XV: A skirmish in Dahomey).

Dahomey Mino were represented in the 1987 film &quot;Cobra Verde&quot; by German director Werner Herzog.

Ghezo&#x27;s Mino play a significant role in the 1971 novel &quot;Flash for Freedom!&quot; by George MacDonald Fraser.

The warriors are also the main focus and written about in Layon Gray&#x27;s stage play &quot;The Dahomey Warriors&quot;.

The Dora Milaje, warriors and bodyguards of the Marvel Comics character Black Panther, are partially based on the Dahomey Mino.

In &quot;Age of Empires II: The African Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Age of Empires III: The African Royals&quot; there is a female unit named Gbeto that is influenced by and named after Dahomey Mino.

In the video game &quot;&quot; you can recruit Dahomey Mino units if you have conquered certain regions in North Africa.

In the &quot;Lovecraft Country&quot; episode &quot;I Am&quot;, Hippolyta is transported to a world where she becomes a Dahomey Mino.

In 2015, UNESCO published the comic novel &quot;The Women Soldiers of Dahomey&quot; as part of their UNESCO Series on Women in African History. As an artistic and visual interpretation intended for private or public use in classrooms, it tells the story of the Mino in connection with European colonial rule in Africa and ends with their legacy for the present-day Republic of Benin: &quot;In addition to the imprint that they have left on the collective memory, the women soldiers bequeathed to the Republic of Benin dances that are performed to this day in Abomey, songs and legends. There are many women soldiers in the Benin Armed Forces today. They keep the memory of the women soldiers of the Kingdom of Dahomey alive.&quot;

&quot;The Last Amazon of Dahomey&quot; is a play in the Booker Prize-winning novel of 2019 called &quot;Girl, Woman, Other&quot;, by Bernardine Evaristo.

The Ahosi are featured in the 2021 graphic novel &quot;&quot; by Rebecca Hall and Hugo Martinez.

The Dahomey Mino are the subject of the 2022 American film &quot;The Woman King&quot;, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood.

Dahomey Amazons are represented as Minos in the novel &quot;Sister Mother Warrior&quot; by Vanessa Riley (William Morrow, July 12, 2022).

&quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; has the Umgadi, which are references to the Dahomey Minos.

<doc id="1091427" wikidata="Q5359277" url="?curid=1091427" title="Elephant's Memory">
<text>Elephant&#x27;s Memory (also billed as Elephants Memory, without the apostrophe) was an American rock band formed in New York City in the late 1960s, known primarily for backing John Lennon and Yoko Ono from late 1971 to 1973. For live performances with Lennon and Ono, the band was known as the Plastic Ono Elephant&#x27;s Memory Band.

==History==
===Formation and early career (1967–1972)===
Elephant&#x27;s Memory was formed between 1967 and 1968, by Stan Bronstein (saxophone, clarinet, and vocals) and Rick Frank Jr. (drums). In 1968, they briefly added Carly Simon as a vocalist. By 1969, the line-up had expanded to include John Ward (bass) with Danny Adler (guitar and keyboards) who originally performed in the Blues Doctors (1964–1966), Chester Ayers (guitar), Myron Yules (bass trombone), R. Sussmann (keyboards), Michal Shapiro (vocals), Guy Peritore (guitar and vocals), David Cohen (guitar, keyboards, and vocals), and Michael Rose on guitar.

Two of the band&#x27;s songs, &quot;Jungle Gym at the Zoo&quot; and &quot;Old Man Willow&quot;, appeared on the 1969 soundtrack to the film &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;. Elephant&#x27;s Memory received a gold disc for their contribution to the soundtrack.

In 1970, the band had a minor hit single with the song &quot;Mongoose&quot; on Metromedia Records, peaking at number 50 on the Hot 100 on October 17, 1970, but at number 5 on Chicago&#x27;s WCFL on November 23, 1970 and reaching number 1 in Pittsburgh on KQV. In Canada, &quot;Mongoose&quot; reached number 71 on September 26, 1970. In 1971 the band released the single &quot;Skyscraper Commando,&quot; of which &quot;Record World&quot; said &quot;the lyric is powerful and the instrumental track is right up there with &#x27;Mongoose&#x27;.&quot;

Between 1970 and 1973, the line-up remained more or less constant around Bronstein and Frank, together with guitarists Wayne &quot;Tex&quot; Gabriel, keyboardist Adam Ippolito and bassist Gary Van Scyoc.

===Work with Lennon and Ono, and later career (1972–1976)===
Known around the Greenwich Village area as a politically active street band, Elephant&#x27;s Memory backed Lennon and Ono on their album &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot; during recording sessions in March 1972. The album was released in June 1972 in the United States, and in September 1972 in the UK.

Later in 1972, they were billed as the Plastic Ono Elephant&#x27;s Memory Band and performed with Lennon and Ono on various TV shows, albums and concerts. On August 30, 1972, with the addition of John Ward on bass and Jim Keltner on drums, the band played with Lennon and Ono at the famous One to One Concert organized by Geraldo Rivera, to benefit the Willowbrook State School for children with intellectual disabilities. The concert was filmed and recorded, later released in February 1986 as the album &quot;Live in New York City&quot;. On September 4, they played live again with Lennon and Ono at the &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot;, performing &quot;Imagine&quot;, &quot;Now or Never&quot; and &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot;.

In April and May 1972, the band recorded their second self-titled album, co-produced by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and released on the Beatles&#x27; Apple Records label, together with an accompanying single &quot;Power Boogie.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; called it a &quot;selection of good, strong unpretentious rock.&quot; It also contains various contributions by Lennon himself on guitar and vocals. This album has never been re-issued on compact disc. From October to November, the band recorded material for Ono&#x27;s double album &quot;Approximately Infinite Universe&quot;, released in January 1973.

On September 5, 1973, the band appeared at the Hells Angels &quot;Pirate Party&quot; held on the SS &quot;Bay Belle&quot;, together with a band featuring Jerry Garcia. This performance was later featured in the 1983 documentary film &quot;Hells Angels Forever&quot;.

The line-up of Elephant&#x27;s Memory included at various times, Daria Price on castanets, Robert O&#x27;Leary on bass, and John La Bosca on piano. However, the line-up that recorded &quot;Angels Forever&quot; in 1974, was Stan Bronstein and Richard Frank, plus Gary Van Scyoc on bass, Chris Robison and Jon Sachs.

In 2010, Van Scyoc and Ippolito appeared in &quot;LENNONYC&quot;, a documentary about John Lennon for the PBS American Masters series.

In May 2010, guitarist Wayne &quot;Tex&quot; Gabriel died at the age of 59.

<text>The Dobson River () is a river in the South Island of New Zealand. It flows south between the Neumann and Ohau ranges for from its source on the west slope of Mount Edgar Thomson, in the Southern Alps, before joining with the Hopkins River, close to the latter&#x27;s entry into the northern end of Lake Ōhau in the Mackenzie Country. The river flows over wide shingle beds, and has no rapids of interest to whitewater enthusiasts. It was named by Julius von Haast in the 1860s for his father-in-law, Edward Dobson, who was the Canterbury Provincial Engineer. The Māori name, also given as &quot;Otao&quot; in some works, means &quot;driftwood,&quot; and has also been applied to the Hopkins River into which the Dobson/Ōtaao flows.

The New Zealand Department of Conservation maintains a tramping track and several backcountry huts in the river valley. Two of the huts are accessible by 4WD vehicle.

There is no direct geographical link with the West Coast town of Dobson.

<text>was a after &quot;Bunshō&quot; and before &quot;Bunmei&quot;. This period spanned the years from March 1467 through April 1469. The reigning emperor was .

==Change of era==
* 1467 : The era name was changed to mark an event or a number of events. The old era ended and a new one commenced in &quot;Bunshō&quot; 2.

==Events of the &quot;Ōnin&quot; era==
The &quot;Ōnin War&quot;: This conflict began as a controversy over whether at Ashikaga Yoshimasa&#x27;s retirement as shōgun he should be succeeded by his brother (Yoshimi) or his son (Yoshihisa); but this succession dispute was merely a pretext for rival groups of &quot;daimyōs&quot; to fight in a struggle for military supremacy. In the end, there was no clear-cut winner. The complex array of factional armies simply fought themselves into exhaustion.

* 1467 (&quot;Ōnin 1, 1st month&quot;): Yamana Sōzen and Hatakeyama Yoshinari took up positions around the Muromachi-dono, the Ashikaga residence in Heian-kyō where the Shōgun made his headquarters. They sent for Ashikaga Yoshimi, and they also invited former-Emperor Go-Hanazono and Go-Tsuchimikado to come themselves to Muromachi to witness for themselves that Hosokawa Katsumoto and Hatakeyama Michinaga would be put to death. For his part, Yoshimi first tried to ameliorate the escalating situation. Failing that, Yoshimi ordered Yoshinari to kill Masanaga, but Yoshinari was overpowered and Masanaga fled the capital. These events caused Souzen and Yoshinari to feel afraid of what might happen next.
* 1467 (&quot;Ōnin 1, 1st month&quot;): The &quot;nadaijin&quot; Sayensi-no Saneto was replaced by Hino-no Katsumitsi.
* 1467 (&quot;Ōnin 1, 2nd month&quot;): Shiba-no Yoshikado became &quot;kanrei&quot;; and from this moment forward, the confidence and activities of Katsumoto ceased entirely. He didn&#x27;t go out at all, and he began to regret that he hadn&#x27;t joined Masanaga. At the same time, Souzen and Yoshinari despaired as they secretly occupied themselves with preparations for armed confrontation. They informed their clans of their plans, and they began to believe that with support from outside the capital, it would be possible to surmount any number of obstacles.
* 1467 (&quot;Ōnin 1, 5th month&quot;): Nijō Mochimitsi was removed from his role as &quot;kampaku&quot;, and Ichijō Kaneyoshi became his successor.

===Higashiyama-dono===
The emperor honored Yoshimasa&#x27;s villa with a special name – &quot;Higashiyama-dono.&quot; Construction begins on the Silver Pavilion, but the work is interrupted by a range of disruptions associated with the Ōnin War. Significant dates in this evolving crisis were:
* 1460 (&quot;Chōroku 3&quot;): Yoshimasa initiated planning for construction of a retirement villa and gardens as early as 1460; and after his death, this property would become a Buddhist temple called Jisho-ji (also known as Ginkaku-ji or the &quot;Silver Pavilion&quot;).
* February 21, 1482 (&quot;Bunmei 14, 4th day of the 2nd month&quot;): The long-delayed construction of the &quot;Silver Pavilion&quot; is actually commenced.

<doc id="1091441" wikidata="Q1347588" url="?curid=1091441" title="Lake Pukaki">
<text>Lake Pukaki () is the largest of three roughly parallel alpine lakes running north–south along the northern edge of the Mackenzie Basin on New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. The others are Lakes Tekapo and Ōhau. All three lakes were formed when the terminal moraines of receding glaciers blocked their respective valleys, forming moraine-dammed lakes. The Alps2Ocean mountain bike trail follows the edge of Lake Pukaki for part of its length.

==Geography==
The glacial feed to the lakes gives them a distinctive blue colour, created by glacial flour, the extremely finely ground rock particles from the glaciers.
Lake Pukaki covers an area of , and the surface elevation of the lake normally ranges from above sea level.

The lake is fed at its northern end by the braided Tasman River, which has its source in the Tasman and Hooker Glaciers, close to Aoraki / Mount Cook. To the west of Lake Pukaki lies the Ben Ohau mountain range with Ben Dhu () and Betty Hill () closest to the lake. On the eastern side there is some farmland on the flatter contours between Lake Pukaki and Lake Tekapo.

Good views of the taller mountains in Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park, to the north can be had from the southern shore of the lake.

== Tahr statue ==
There is a life size bronze statue of a Himalayan Tahr standing upon a boulder near the visitor centre on the southern shores of Lake Pukaki, This was the site of a protest by hunters fighting against the Department of Conservation’s controversial tahr culling programme in 2020.

==Hydroelectricity==
The lake is now part of the Waitaki hydroelectric scheme.
The lake&#x27;s original outflow was at its southern end, into the Pukaki River.
The outflow has been dammed, and canals carry water from Lake Pukaki and Lake Ōhau through the Ōhau A power station to Lake Ruataniwha.
Pukaki is also fed by the waters of Lake Tekapo, which are diverted through a canal to a power station on Pukaki&#x27;s eastern shore (Tekapo B station). The lake has been raised twice to increase storage capacity (by in 1952, and in 1976), submerging Five Pound Note Island, which once appeared on New Zealand&#x27;s five pound note. The current lake has an operating range of (the level within which it can be artificially raised or lowered), giving it an energy storage capacity of 1,595 GWh. Along with Lake Tekapo&#x27;s 770 GWh storage, it provides over half New Zealand&#x27;s hydroelectricity storage capacity. In September 2012, Environment Canterbury approved a change in conditions of Meridian Energy&#x27;s resource consent controlling the water levels and flows of Lake Pukaki. The change allows Meridian to lower the lake a further from the minimum level of above sea level in the event of an energy crisis.

==Nearby settlements==
There was previously a seasonal Ngāi Tahu food-gathering settlement on the southern shore of Lake Pukaki called Punatahu.

The closest town to Lake Pukaki is Twizel, to the south of the lake and Tekapo is 47 km (32 minutes drive) to the northeast. skirts the southern end of the lake, and runs north along the length of its western shore, to Mount Cook Village in the Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park.

The nearby Pukaki Scientific Reserve is home to the Nationally Endangered moth species &quot;Izatha psychra.&quot;

== Road safety ==
State Highway 8 runs along the edge of Lake Pukaki. Numerous crashes have occurred here as drivers have come around a blind corner, seen Lake Pukaki and wanted to stop at an unsafe location to enjoy the view.

== 2020 fire ==
A significant scrub fire burnt on the shores of Lake Pukaki in August 2020. Both State Highway 8 and SH80 were closed. Firefighters fought the fire with 14 monsoon bucket equipped helicopters, two fixed-wing aircraft, and 10 fire engines. The fire destroyed 3500 hectares and took 12 days to put out. $1 million was spent fighting it. Environmentalists believe that the spread of wilding pines in the Mackenzie District along with the dry conditions allowed the scrub fire to become so destructive.

== Pukaki Scientific Reserve ==
The Pukaki Scientific Reserve is a small scientific reserve of located on the western side of Lake Pukaki next to the Mount Cook road. The Pukaki Scientific Reserve is home to the endangered &quot;Izatha psychra&quot; moth. The Lake Pukaki area is also home to the &quot;Data Deficient&quot; fly species &quot;Anabarhynchus albipennis&quot;.

<text>Blekingska Nationen is one of thirteen student nations of Lund University in Sweden. It has 1,099 members and is thus the ninth-largest student nation in Lund - ranking behind Sydskånska but ahead of Hallands nation.

The nation was founded in 1697. Today, it is one of thirteen student nations concentrating on musical activities at Lund University in Sweden. Its emphasis is on alternative music, and several well-known bands have performed on their stage. These include The Cardigans, Alphaville, bob hund, The Soundtrack of Our Lives, Broder Daniel, The Ark, The Hives, Spearmint, Bad Cash Quartet, Jens Lekman, Ballboy, My Favorite, The Radio Dept., The Hidden Cameras, The Knife and Moneybrother.

Blekingska Nationen&#x27;s Friday club, Indigo, celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2004, which has carried the organisation forwards. Before the club was founded in 1994, the organisation had only 500 members. At the tenth anniversary of the club, this number had grown to 2000.

== Move ==
Plans for the nation to move were announced in 2016, citing needs of having purpose-built facilities for the nation&#x27;s activities and music performances in particular. In 2018, Blekingska sold their first property on Måsvägen in western Lund where the nation had been housed since the 1960s. Construction on their new estate in the Ideon area in north-east Lund started in 2019, after 60 million SEK had been accrued through donations and the sale of the old property. Later in the year, an additional 10 million SEK for the construction were donated by Ingvar Backhamre. The two new nation houses were inaugurated in 2022 and has 162 apartments.

<text>Lake Tekapo () is the second-largest of three roughly parallel lakes running north–south along the northern edge of the Mackenzie Basin in the South Island of New Zealand (the others are Lake Pukaki and Lake Ōhau). It covers an area of and is at an altitude of above sea level. 
== In Māori culture ==
&quot;Tekapo&quot; is a misspelling of , the name of the lake in the Māori language. means &quot;to leave in haste at night&quot;.

In 2021, the Mackenzie District Council announced that it will start using the dual names of Tekapo and Takapō when referring to Lake Tekapo.

According to Ngāi Tahu mythology, Lake Tekapo being one of the lakes dug by the Waitaha explorer Rākaihautū using his Polynesian digging stick, which was called Tūwhakaroria. After arriving in the Uruao waka at Nelson, Rākaihautū divided his people into two groups. Rākaihautū led his group down the middle of the island, digging the South Island freshwater lakes. His son, Rakihouia, led the other group down the east coast of the South Island.

=== Motuariki island ===

Motuariki is a small island in the middle of Lake Tekapo. The legends of Ngāi Tahu tell of Motuariki, who was an ancestor of the &quot;Āraiteuru&quot; waka that capsized near Shag Point on the Otago coastline. After the waka capsized, many of the passengers went ashore to explore the land. Legend states that they needed to be back at the waka before daylight. Many did not make it, including Motuariki, and he was instead transformed into the island of Motuariki.

== Geography ==

The lake covers an area of and is at an altitude of above sea level. It is fed at its northern end by both the braided Godley River and Macaulay River, which have their sources in the Southern Alps to the north. The meltwater from the Southern Alps is tinged with a light turquoise colour from the glacial silt. This gives Lake Tekapo its distinctive colour. To the east of Lake Tekapo lies the Two Thumb Range with Mount Toby (2,222 m); Braun Elwert Peak (2,086 m); Dobson Peak (2,095 m) and Mount Maude (1,797 m) amongst the mountains overlooking Lake Tekapo. On the western side of Lake Tekapo. Mount John (1,031 m) is closest to the town with Lake Alexandrina further north and Mistake Peak (1,931 m) sitting towards the head of the lake. Cowans Hill (783m) lies at the southern end of Lake Tekapo behind the township and next to the Tekapo River.

The average water temperature on the surface of the lake varies between a low of 5.8 to 5.9 °C in September and a high of 17 °C in January.

The lake is a popular tourist destination, and several resort hotels are located in the township of Lake Tekapo at the lake&#x27;s southern end. The Lake Tekapo Regional Park, administered by Environment Canterbury, is located on the lake&#x27;s southern shore. State Highway 8 runs past Lake Tekapo at its southern end.

On a clear day, the taller snow-capped peaks of Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park are visible from Lake Tekapo.

An astronomical observatory is located at Mount John, which is to the north of the town, and south of the small Lake Alexandrina.

=== Climate ===

Lake Tekapo is one of the sunniest places in New Zealand with annual sunshine hours averaging more than 2,400 each year.

== Dark-Sky Reserve ==
Lake Tekapo and the surrounding district were designated in 2012 as the Aoraki Mackenzie International Dark Sky Reserve. The area of the reserve is and as of 2024, this makes it the largest dark-sky reserve in the southern hemisphere. The dark-sky reserve accreditation recognises that the night skies in the area of the reserve are almost completely free of light pollution and ideal for star-gazing. Lake Tekapo and its observatories are a popular destination among astronomers, astrophotographers and tourists interested in star-gazing.

== Lupins ==
Lake Tekapo is also known for its stunning seasonal display of Lupin that bloom along its shores from around Mid November until the end of December. Russell lupins were introduced in the Mackenzie Basin in the 1940s from sowings or lupins planted in garden which had seeds that spread widely. In 1949 Connie Scott, of Godley Peaks Station, scattered lupin seeds along the roadside after purchasing about £100 worth from the local stock and station agent. Although beautiful, they modify the ecosystems of braided rivers. There were fewer lupins around Lake Tekapo in December 2020, due to the water level in the lake being too high at a vital time in their growth cycle, causing them to fail to flower.

Drivers have been warned to take care during the lupin season, as many visitors to the area slow down or pull over to admire the lupins along State Highway 8, but this may be unsafe and create the potential for accidents.

==Hydroelectricity==
The lake&#x27;s original outflow was at its southern end, into the Tekapo River. In 1938, construction commenced on a power station, originally due to be finished in 1943 but halted in 1942 by the Second World War. At the same time, control gates were constructed to regulate outflows to the Waitaki Dam downstream. Work restarted in 1944, and the power station, now known as Tekapo A, came online in 1951.

Water from the lake is diverted through a tunnel under the town to the power station, with the water originally being returned to the river. With development of the Upper Waitaki hydroelectric scheme in the 1970s, water is now fed into a canal which leads to Tekapo B Power Station on the shores of Lake Pukaki.

In 2008, Tekapo A and Tekapo B hydro stations were refurbished following the upgrade of Benmore and Waitaki.

On 1 June 2011, ownership of Tekapo A and B hydropower stations were transferred from Meridian Energy to Genesis Energy on instruction from the Government.

In February 2021, Genesis Energy finished an upgrade that strengthened the Tekapo A power station to withstand earthquakes. It involved five years of planning, two years of construction and cost $26.5 million. It was a challenging build to upgrade the infrastructure and tunnels which were built in the 1940s. The Tekapo A power station provides power to almost 100,000 homes.

==Skifield==

On the north side of the lake, from the Tekapo township is the Roundhill Ski Area situated in the Two Thumb Range, which caters primarily to beginner and intermediate skiers. For advanced skiers, Roundhill Ski Area also has the world&#x27;s longest and steepest rope tow which runs to the top of the Richmond Range at elevation.

==Buildings and other structures==

=== Church of the Good Shepherd ===
Situated on the shores of Lake Tekapo is the Church of the Good Shepherd, which, in 1935, was the first church built in the Mackenzie Basin. The church at Lake Tekapo was designed by Christchurch architect R.S.D. Harman, based on sketches by a local artist, Esther Hope. The church is one of the most photographed in New Zealand, and features an altar window that frames views of the lake and mountains.

=== Bronze sheepdog ===
Close to the Church of the Good Shepherd is a well-known bronze statue of a New Zealand Collie sheepdog. Mackenzie Country residents commissioned the statue in recognition of the indispensable role of the sheepdog in their livelihoods. The sculptor was Innes Elliott of Kaikōura, with a dog called Haig, belonging to a neighbour, being the model. Elliott reported the sculpting process took approximately fifteen months. Clay for the model came from the insulator works in Temuka, with a plaster cast of it made and sent to London in 1966, where the statue was cast.

== Fishing ==
Large brown trout and rainbow trout can be caught in Lake Tekapo. Trolling a lure from a boat is one option for fishing Lake Tekapo. Fishing from the shore is also possible. The best spots for fishing from the shore are to be found around the mouths of the many small streams that flow into the lake. These include the Cass River; Mistake River; Boundary Stream; Glenmore Station Tarn; Coal River and the Macauley River. In 2016 the Fish and Game Council released 45,000 baby salmon into Lake Tekapo to improve fishing stocks and a further 50,000 were released in 2020. The upper half of the Tekapo Canal will be closed to fishing over the winter of 2021 to conserve stocks while spawning. The Tekapo Canal is known for very large (trophy-size) rainbow trout.

==Change of era==
* 1457 : The era name was changed to mark an event or a number of events. The old era ended and a new one commenced in &quot;Kōshō&quot; 3.

==Events of the &quot;Chōroku&quot; era==
* 1457 (&quot;Chōroku 1&quot;&#x27;): Tarō Sayemon attempted to retrieve the Sacred Jewel for Emperor Go-Hanazono; and he actually did manage to gain possession of it for a brief time. A counterattack prevented the success of this dangerous mission in Yoshino. In 1443 (&quot;Kakitsu 3, 23rd day of the 9th month&quot;), an armed group of rebels penetrated the palace defenses. A fire was started and one of the men sought to kill Emperor Go-Hanazono, but the emperor escaped. However, the intruders managed to steal the Sacred Treasures – the mirror, the sword and the jewel. Later, a guard found the mirror and a priest found the sword, but the location of the jewel was not known until the 8th month of &quot;Bunnan gannen.&quot;
* 1458 (&quot;Chōroku 2, 8th month&quot;): The Sacred Jewel is retrieved from the former Southern Court. It is returned to Kyoto to join the other Sacred Treasures which comprise the Imperial Regalia of Japan.
* 1459 (&quot;Chōroku 3&quot;): Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa provided a new &quot;mikoshi&quot; and a complete set of robes and other accouterments for this festival on the occasion of repairs to the Atsuta Shrine in the 1457-1459 (&quot;Chōroku 1-3&quot;).

<doc id="1091454" wikidata="Q1113362" url="?curid=1091454" title="Okot p'Bitek">
<text>Okot p&#x27;Bitek (7 June 1931 – 19 July 1982) was a Ugandan poet, who achieved wide international recognition for &quot;Song of Lawino&quot;, a long poem dealing with the tribulations of a rural African wife whose husband has taken up urban life and wishes everything to be westernised. &quot;Song of Lawino&quot; was originally written in the Acholi dialect of Southern Luo, translated by the author into English, and published in 1966. It was a breakthrough work, creating an audience among anglophone Africans for direct, topical poetry in English; and incorporating traditional attitudes and thinking in an accessible yet faithful literary vehicle. It was followed by the &quot;Song of Ocol&quot; (1970), the husband&#x27;s reply.

The &quot;East African Song School&quot; or &quot;Okot School poetry&quot; is now an academic identification of the work following his direction, also popularly called &quot;comic singing&quot;: a forceful type of dramatic verse monologue rooted in traditional song and phraseology.

== Early life ==

Okot p&#x27;Bitek was born in 1931 in Gulu, in the North Uganda grasslands. His father, Jebedayo Opi, was a schoolteacher, while his mother, Lacwaa Cerina, was a traditional singer, storyteller and dancer. His ethnic background was Acholi, and he wrote first in the Acholi dialect, also known as Lwo. Acholi is a dialect of Southern Luo, one of the Western Nilotic languages.

At school he was noted as a singer, dancer, drummer and athlete. He was educated at Gulu High School, then at King&#x27;s College, Budo, where he composed an opera based on traditional songs. He went on to study at universities in the United Kingdom.

== University ==
He travelled abroad first as a player with the Ugandan national football team, in 1958. He gave up on football as a possible career, stayed in Britain, and studied education at the University of Bristol and then law at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. He then took a Bachelor of Letters degree in social anthropology at the University of Oxford, with a 1963 dissertation on Acholi and Lango traditional cultures.

It is reported that Oxford deliberately failed his Ph.D. in 1970. The dissertation was published nearly unchanged in 1971 as &quot;The Religion of the Central Luo&quot; by a Kenyan publisher.

According to George Heron, p&#x27;Bitek lost his commitment to Christian belief during these years. This had major consequences for his attitude as a scholar of African tradition, which was by no means accepting of the general run of earlier work, or what he called &quot;dirty gossip&quot; in relation to tribal life. His character Lawino also speaks for him, in some places, on these matters.

== Career ==
He wrote an early novel, &quot;Lak Tar Miyo Kinyero Wi Lobo&quot; (1953), in Lwo, later translated into English as &quot;White Teeth&quot;. It concerns the experiences of a young Acholi man moving away from home, to find work and so a wife. Okot p&#x27;Bitek organised an arts festival at Gulu, and then at Kisumu. Subsequently he taught at Makerere University (1964–66) and then was Director of Uganda&#x27;s National Theatre and National Cultural Centre (1966–68).

He became unpopular with the Ugandan government, and took teaching posts outside the country. He took part in the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa in 1969. He was at the Institute of African Studies of University College, Nairobi from 1971 as a senior research fellow and lecturer, with visiting positions at University of Texas at Austin and University of Ife in Nigeria in 1978/9. He remained in exile during the regime of Idi Amin, returning in 1982 to Makerere University, to teach creative writing. He participated in the inaugural International Book Fair of Radical Black and Third World Books in London in April 1982, when he performed extracts from his poems &quot;Song of Lawino&quot; and &quot;Song of Ocol&quot; in what would be his last public appearance.

Apart from his poetry and novels, he also took part in an ongoing debate about the integrity of scholarship on traditional African religion, with the assertion in &quot;African Religions in Western Scholarship&quot; (1971) that scholars centred on European concerns were &quot;intellectual smugglers&quot;. His point, aimed partly at Africans who had had a training in Christian traditions, was that it led to a concentration on matters distant from the actual concerns of Africans; this has been contested by others. He was an atheist.

== Death ==
He died in Kampala of a stroke in 1982. He was survived by daughters Agnes Oyella, Jane Okot p&#x27;Bitek who wrote a &quot;Song of Farewell&quot; (1994), Olga Okot Bitek Ojelel and Cecilia Okot Bitek who work as nurses, Juliane Okot Bitek who writes poetry, and a son George Okot p&#x27;Bitek, who is a teacher in Kampala. Olga, Cecilia, and Juliane all live in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In 2004 Juliane was the recipient of an award in the Commonwealth Short Story Contest for her story &quot;Going Home&quot;. These are the daughters of his wife Caroline.

<doc id="1091464" wikidata="Q901252" url="?curid=1091464" title="Daimler-Benz DB 601">
<text>The Daimler-Benz DB 601 was a German aircraft engine that was built during World War II. It was a liquid-cooled inverted V12, and powered the Messerschmitt Bf 109, Messerschmitt Bf 110, and many others. Approximately 19,000 601s were produced before it was replaced by the improved Daimler-Benz DB 605 in 1942.

At its core, the DB 601 was an improved DB 600 with direct fuel injection. Fuel injection required power to be taken off the drive shaft, but in return, improved low-RPM performance significantly and provided aerobatic performance in maneuvers where early versions of carbureted engines like the British Rolls-Royce Merlin lost power when the carburetor float bowl ran dry.

The 601&#x27;s fuel injection provided a significant boost in performance which its competitor, the Junkers Jumo 210, did not match for some time. By the time the fuel-injected 211 arrived, the 601 had already cemented its place as the engine for high-performance designs like fighters, high-speed bombers, and similar roles. The 211 was relegated to use in bombers and transport aircraft. In this respect, the 601 was the counterpart to the Merlin engine of roughly the same size and power.

The DB 601Aa was licence-built in Japan by Aichi as the [[Aichi Atsuta|Atsuta]], by Kawasaki as the [[Kawasaki Ha40|Ha40]], and in Italy by Alfa Romeo as the R.A.1000 R.C.41-I &quot;Monsone&quot;.

==Development==
Based on the guidelines laid down by the German &quot;Reichverkehrsministerium&quot; (Reich Ministry of Transport), in 1930 Daimler-Benz began development of a new aero engine of the displacement class: a liquid-cooled inverted-vee 12-cylinder piston engine. This was designated F4, and by 1931 two prototypes were running on the test bench. These were followed by the improved F4B, which became the prototype for the DB 600.

In 1933, Daimler-Benz finally received a contract to develop its new engine and to build six examples of the DB 600. For the year after, the DB 600 was the only German aero engine in the 30-litre class. In total, 2,281 DB 600s were built.

The DB 601A-1 was a development of the DB 600 with mechanical direct fuel injection. Like all DB 601s, it had a 33.9 litre displacement. The first DB 601A-1 prototype, designated as F4E, was test run in 1935, and an order for 150 engines was placed in February 1937.

Serial production began in November 1937, and ended in 1943, after 19,000 examples of all types were produced.

==Variants==

;DB 606 A/B
:Project initiated in February 1937, to &quot;twin-up&quot; two DB 601As or Es coupled to work on a single propeller shaft with all-up weight of some 1.5 tonnes; for use in Heinkel He 119 (one DB 606) and Messerschmitt Me 261 (twin DB 606) designs, where they worked well in their prototype airframes; saw first combat use with early Heinkel He 177As - 2,700 PS (1,986 kW) at sea level with a mirror-imaged starboard component engine supercharger. Derided as &quot;welded-together engines&quot; by &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring in August 1942, from the problems they caused with engine fires in the He 177A during service from their inadequate installation design.

<text>Ditherington is a suburb of the town of Shrewsbury, the county town of Shropshire, England. It is the fourth most deprived ward in the Shropshire unitary authority area.

There has been much regeneration work in the southern part of Ditherington, which is close to Shrewsbury town centre. Various residential developments have occurred, but little has been finished.

Ditherington was the location of the Arriva Midlands (former Midland Red) Shrewsbury bus depot until 2012, when it was replaced by a newly built one in Harlescott. The Ditherington depot was then demolished and acquired by the nearby Flax Mill, but as of July 2024 is still undeveloped.

==Ditherington Flax Mill==
The Flax Mill (also locally known as the &quot;Maltings&quot;) is the oldest iron-framed building in the world and is seen as the &quot;grandfather of skyscrapers&quot;. It was designed by Charles Bage and built in 1797 for John Marshall of Leeds and his partners. 

It is a Grade I listed building. After decades of being derelict, it was restored and rejuvenated by Historic England, in partnership with the Friends of the Flaxmill Maltings and other organisations. The restored building opened to the public in September 2022 with a new visitor experience centre, café, offices and hirable venue space. In the long term, it is hoped that the building will be able to make sufficient money to be self-supporting, but reaching this stage will require much investment.

==Canal==
The Shrewsbury and Newport Canal terminated in Ditherington, but no longer exists. This may also one day be restored.

<text>Hillston is a township in western New South Wales, Australia, in Carrathool Shire, on the banks of the Lachlan River. It was founded in 1863 and at the had a population of 1,547.

==History==
John Oxley and his exploration party were the first European visitors to the Hillston district, in 1817. Oxley wrote in his journal: &quot;country uninhabitable and useless for all purposes of civilised man&quot;.
In 1839 William Hovell followed the Lachlan River to near the site of present-day Hillston and took up a pastoral holding called &quot;Bellingerambil&quot; (later named &quot;Cowl Cowl&quot;).

===Redbank===
The locality of present-day Hillston was a crossing-place for stock on the Lachlan River. The earliest European name for the place was &#x27;Daisy Plains&#x27; or ‘Daisy Hill’. Later it became known as &quot;Redbank&quot; (following the Wiradjuri name &#x27;Melnunni&#x27;, meaning &quot;red soil&quot;). In 1863 a stockman named William Ward Hill from nearby &quot;Roto&quot; station established an inn – the Redbank Hotel – at the location. William Hill died on 10 July 1867 of &quot;exhaustion from intemperance&quot; and his widow, Elizabeth, took over the licence of the Redbank Hotel (which she held until about 1871). In 1869, when the first post office was opened, the township was renamed Hillston, after its founding publican.

The site of Hillston was originally on land owned by John McGee, who obtained a sub-division and sold lots by public auction, &quot;the lots realising high prices&quot;. The Government also surveyed a township just north of McGee’s land. Sixty-four lots at Hillston North were also auctioned, bringing &quot;up to £100 per acre&quot;. Thus two townships developed side-by-side.

Hillston developed as a service centre to the surrounding pastoral holdings, so the pace of development of the township was closely linked to prevailing conditions as they affected the district pastoral enterprises. Due in large measure to drought conditions in the district there was little or no progress of the township during the mid-1860s. However more favourable seasons by the end of the decade, with the return of more reliable rainfall, led to a revitalization of Hillston’s prospects.

===Township development===
Hillston developed as a service centre to the surrounding pastoral holdings. The Moss brothers, who were successful store-owners at Hay, established a store at Hillston by 1869. Hillston Post Office opened on 1 February 1869. In mid-1871 the partnership between the brothers was dissolved and Louis Moss ran the Hillston store on his own account.

The first Police Court at Hillston was held on 28 August 1873 in a room at one of the hotels in the town.

The first church at Hillston was of the Anglican denomination.  A Roman Catholic church was built during the 1880s.  The first Pastoral and Agricultural Show was held at Hillston in 1881.  A hospital was erected in the township in 1882; the cost of the building was raised by voluntary subscription.  A new post-office was completed in 1883 (in the charge of Mr. W. S. Bellamy).  A courthouse at Hillston was completed in about 1883.

Hillston became a municipality in 1888.

The store that became known as Nall, Jackson &amp; Co. Ltd. was established in 1889; the firm had changed its name on various occasions, being known as &quot;Villa and Rossi&quot;, &quot;Villa, Rossi and Nall&quot;, &quot;J. T. Jackson&quot;, and &quot;Nall, Jackson &amp; Co.&quot;  Nall, Jackson &amp; Co., which later opened branches at Merriwagga and Goolgowi, became a mainstay of the Hillston and district community.

A Presbyterian Church was built at Hillston in 1890.

A magistrate was resident at Hillston until 1916, after which the Hay magistrate visited once a month.

Following the First World War, the Hillston area was divided into relatively small rural properties onto which returning soldiers were repatriated under the New South Wales soldier settlement scheme. The railway between Griffith and Hillston was completed in 1923 and large areas of Crown land along the route were made available for selection.

By the end of the 1920s, with the influx of population to the district, the prevailing optimistic mood led to progress and growth at Hillston.  A lighting system was installed at Hillston in 1929. During the same year the old Club House Hotel was replaced by a two-storey building and the Royal Mail Hotel was extended. The firm of Messrs. Parker and Cordato built rows of shops in the township. In early 1931 the Hillston to Roto railway was completed.

In the wake of a land boom during the mid to late-1920s, the reality of marginal nature of the land became manifest and the soldier settlement blocks were found to be too small to be economically viable. The personal and financial hardships experienced during the inter-war decades resulted in many of these families walking off their blocks, and Hillston began to experience a decline.

The wool boom of the 1950s led to reconstruction of the town, and gave new optimism, only to enter a decline again in the 1960s and 1970s.

Until the bitumen sealing of the Kidman Way from Griffith was completed in the early 1970s, the rough dirt road was an effective barrier to communications with other communities. A train service existed until the mid-1970s, but since then there has been no public transport service to Hillston.

In the late 1990s, the introduction of cotton saw a boom period once again which, after a severe drought 2002–2007, is again establishing itself.

In August 2021, a new high resolution doppler weather radar was opened in Hillston. It is operated by the Bureau of Meteorology, providing coverage across the Riverina and western New South Wales.
== Heritage listings ==
Hillston has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Willandra National Park: Willandra Homestead

==Climate==
Hillston has a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) with long, hot summers and relatively cool winters. Rainfall records have been kept for Hillston since 1881, while those of mean temperature since 1907. Seasonal range is quite marked. The highest temperature recorded was on 11 January 2017; the lowest was on 3 August 2014, though extreme temperature records are only available to 1957. The average annual rainfall is . Snow has never been recorded in Hillston.

==Industry==
Agriculture is the main industry in Hillston mostly oriented towards livestock, grain, cotton, citrus and vegetables, utilising irrigation from the Lachlan River and underground water sources.

Because of the proximity of Hillston to the Kidman Way, Lachlan Valley Way and the Cobb Highway many road transport companies operate in Hillston.
==Amenities==
Town facilities include Lake Woorabinda, a man-made lake for water-skiing encircled by a scenic walking track between the river and the lake, community hall for sport and cultural events, and an art gallery in the main street.

Between Lake Woorabinda and the community hall lie a 25m public swimming pool and the Lions&#x27; Park, which incorporates children&#x27;s play equipment and a barbecue area.

Hillston has two schools; Hillston Central School, a K-12 public school, and St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School, a K-6 Catholic school.

Stan Peters Oval is the local sports ground, home to the Hillston Swans Australian Rules club in the Northern Riverina Football League and the Hillston Bluebirds Rugby League club in Group 17.

Hillston is the terminus of the open section of the Temora–Roto railway line. Passenger services were discontinued in 1974, but the line remains open to Hillston for goods services.

<doc id="1091470" wikidata="Q647205" url="?curid=1091470" title="SS Imperator">
<text>SS &quot;Imperator (known asRMS &quot;Berengaria for most of her career) was a German ocean liner built for the Hamburg America Line, launched in 1912. At the time of her completion in June 1913, she was the largest passenger ship in the world, surpassing the new White Star liner &quot;Olympic.&quot;

&quot;Imperator&quot; was the first of a trio of successively larger Hamburg America liners that included &quot;Vaterland&quot; (later the United States Liner &quot;Leviathan&quot;) and &quot;Bismarck&quot; (later the White Star Line &quot;Majestic&quot;) all of which were seized as war reparations.

&quot;Imperator&quot; served for 14 months on HAPAG&#x27;s transatlantic route, until the outbreak of World War I, after which she remained in port in Hamburg. After the war, she was briefly commissioned into the United States Navy as USS &quot;Imperator&quot; (ID-4080) and employed as a transport, returning American troops from Europe. Following her service with the U.S. Navy, &quot;Imperator&quot; was purchased jointly by Britain&#x27;s Cunard Line and White Star Line as part of war reparations, due to the loss of the &quot;RMS Lusitania,&quot; where she sailed as the flagship RMS &quot;Berengaria&quot; for the last 20 years of her career. William H. Miller wrote that &quot;despite her German heritage and the barely disguised Teutonic tone of her interiors, she was thought of in the 1920s and 30s as one of Britain&#x27;s finest liners.&quot;

==Construction and early career==

The first plates of the keel were laid in 1910 at the Vulcan Shipyards in Hamburg, Germany, and the ship made its maiden voyage in 1913. At 52,117 gross register tons, &quot;Imperator&quot; was the largest ship in the world until &quot;Vaterland&quot; sailed in May 1914. After the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; in April 1912, the shipyard added more lifeboats to &quot;Imperator&quot; to ensure there was more than enough room for all passengers and crew. In total, &quot;Imperator&quot; would carry 83 lifeboats capable of holding 5,500 people between them, 300 more than the ship&#x27;s maximum capacity.

Before her launch on 23 May 1912, Cunard announced that its new ship, , which was under construction at the time at the John Brown shipyards in Glasgow, would be longer by , causing dismay in Hamburg. Several weeks later, she was fitted with a figurehead, an imposing bronze eagle, increasing her length past that of &quot;Aquitania&quot;. The eagle was created by Professor Bruno Kruse of Berlin, and adorned her forepeak with a banner emblazoned with HAPAG&#x27;s motto &quot;Mein Feld ist die Welt&quot; (&quot;My field is the world&quot;). The eagle&#x27;s wings were torn off in an Atlantic storm during the 1914 season, after which the figurehead was removed and replaced with gold scroll-work similar to that on the stern.

During her initial sea trials, the ship ran aground on the Elbe river due to insufficient dredging and a flash fire in the engine room which resulted in eight crewmen being taken to hospital. During her official trials, she suffered overheating of the turbines and some stability issues were discovered. The trials were therefore abandoned and the builders were called in to carry out emergency work. Coincidentally, 1913 was the silver jubilee year for the Kaiser, so he was going to be treated to an overnight cruise on the North Sea before the ship would make its maiden voyage. The overnight cruise was canceled; it was eventually carried out in July of that year.

&quot;Imperator&quot; left on her maiden voyage on Wednesday, 11 June 1913, with Commodore Hans Ruser in command and Hamburg-Amerika appointing four other subordinate captains for the journey to make sure that everything went smoothly. On the way, she stopped at Southampton and Cherbourg before proceeding across the Atlantic to New York, arriving on 19 June 1913. On board were 4,986 people, consisting of 859 first-class passengers, 647 second-class passengers, 648 third-class passengers, 1,495 in steerage, and 1,332 crew. The ship returned to Europe from Hoboken, New Jersey, on 25 June 1913.

On his first arrival, the harbor pilot assigned to bring her into the Ambrose channel, Captain George Seeth, noted that the ship listed from side to side when the helm changed the ship&#x27;s direction. She was soon nicknamed &quot;Limperator&quot;.

In October 1913, &quot;Imperator&quot; returned to the Vulcan shipyard to facilitate drastic work to improve handling and stability, as it had been discovered that her center of gravity was too high (see metacentric height). To correct the problem, the marble bathroom suites in first class were removed and heavy furniture was replaced with lightweight wicker cane. The ship&#x27;s funnels were reduced in height by . Finally, 2,000 tons of cement was poured into the ship&#x27;s double bottom as ballast. This work cost £200,000, which had to be borne by the shipyard as part of their five-year warranty to the shipowners. At the same time, an advanced fire sprinkler system was fitted throughout the ship, as several fires had occurred on board since the vessel had entered service.

During the 1914 refit of &quot;Imperator&quot;, Commodore Ruser handed over command of the ship to Captain Theo Kier and left to take command of the new larger flagship &quot;Vaterland&quot;, which was nearing completion. &quot;Imperator&quot; returned to service on 11 March, arriving in New York five days later on the 19th.

Whereas German ships are usually referred to with the feminine article (), &quot;Imperator&quot; was instead referred to with the masculine article (), on the explicit personal wishes of Emperor Wilhelm II.

===Interiors===
The architect and designer Charles Mewès was responsible for the interior design of the &quot;Imperator&quot; and his sister ships. One German critic commented on the prevalence of French-style décor on the new ship: 

One contemporary review noted how the ship&#x27;s &quot;great size...has enabled her designers to allow unusual space for passenger accommodation.&quot; This was echoed in &quot;The Master, Mate, and Pilot&quot;, which stated that &quot;taking advantage of his great dimensions, the ships&#x27; public cabins, and staterooms have been made so large as to avoid any suggestion of crowding.&quot; Space-saving devices like berths and folding washbasins were eliminated in the First-Class staterooms on &quot;Imperator&quot;, all of which had free-standing beds and marble-topped washstands with hot and cold running water. Almost all First-Class cabins were &quot;outside&quot; cabins, meaning they had portholes or windows for natural light and ventilation. Over 200 cabins were reserved for single occupancy, and 150 had en-suite bathrooms. The two &quot;Imperial&quot; suites had 12 rooms each, including a breakfast room, private veranda, sitting room, and servants&#x27; quarters.

The main First-Class dining room was on F Deck and there were two restaurants on B Deck. The main dining room could accommodate 700 diners at tables for between 2 and 8 people. The Ritz-Carlton restaurant, which was joined with a winter garden/palm court in the Directoire style, was managed by staff from the Carlton Hotel in London. There was also a Grill Room at the aft end of B Deck, a tea garden, and a Veranda café. Other First-Class public rooms included a 72-foot-long lounge/ballroom, several ladies sitting rooms, and a smoking room. The Tudor style smoking room was decorated with brick from a demolished Tudor-era cottage in England. The lounge, or &quot;Social Hall&quot;, as it was called, was hung with Gobelins tapestries and included a stage for theatrical performances to be held. In the evening the carpet could be removed for dancing. Off the entrance halls were amenities like a bookshop, florist, pharmacy, doctor&#x27;s office, and the offices of the purser, chief steward, and baggage master.

&quot;Imperator&quot; introduced a two-deck-high, Pompeiian-style swimming pool for its First-Class passengers. It was inspired by a similar swimming pool built in London in 1907 for the Royal Automobile Club, of which Charles Mewès was also one of the architects. Connected to the pool were Victorian-style Turkish baths, steam baths, electric baths, massage and hairdressing rooms. The gymnasium was &quot;the largest and most luxurious that has ever been fitted up on a passenger steamer...&quot;, according to &quot;The Marine Engineering and Naval Architect&quot;. For the first time on an ocean liner, Second-Class had its own gymnasium as well. Second-Class passengers also had their own smoking room, reading and writing rooms, dining room, and music room.

While the Cunard refit changed plates identifying switches and valves were reversed and reinscribed in English, drains in cabin bathtubs remained marked &quot;AUF&quot; and &quot;ZU&quot; and ashtrays still read &quot;ZIGARREN&quot;.

==World War I and U.S. Navy service==
In August 1914, as World War I began, she was laid up at Hamburg and remained inactive for more than four years, falling into dilapidation. Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918, &quot;Imperator&quot; was taken over by the Allied Food Shipping and Finance Agreement, and allocated to the United States for temporary use as a transport alongside &quot;Vaterland&quot;, which was now renamed SS &quot;Leviathan&quot; and bringing American service personnel home from France.


She was commissioned as the USS &quot;Imperator&quot; (ID-4080) in early May 1919. After embarking 2,100 American troops and 1,100 passengers, &quot;Imperator&quot; departed Brest, France on 15 May 1919, arriving at New York City one week later. Operating with the Cruiser and Transport Force from 3 June to 10 August, she made three cruises from New York to Brest, returning over 25,000 troops, nurses, and civilians to the United States.

While en route to New York City on 17 June, &quot;Imperator&quot; assisted the , which had broken down in the Atlantic Ocean. The then president-elect of Brazil Epit%C3%A1cio Pessoa was on board &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; and &quot;Imperator&quot; received him and his party for transport to the United States, arriving there several days later.

Decommissioned at Hoboken, New Jersey in early 1919, &quot;Imperator&quot; was transferred to the British Shipping Controller on 20 September, and it was decided that Cunard would operate her. Captain Charles A. Smith and a full crew were sent out to New York on the new operators and the official handover from the British Shipping Controller to Cunard took place on 24 November. &quot;Imperator&quot; was then transferred to Cunard&#x27;s Pier 54 for Cunard service.

==Cunard service as &quot;Berengaria&quot;==

The ship arrived at Southampton on Sunday 10 December 1919 and then proceeded to Liverpool for what was planned to be a quick overhaul (he was scheduled to leave on his first voyage for the new owners on 10 January 1920). Upon inspection, the ship was found to be in poor condition. During dry-docking on 6 January, it was found that the ship&#x27;s rudder had a piece missing and the propellers were suffering from erosion on their leading edges. These issues were attended to while the ship was refurbished with items borrowed from the Cunard vessels &quot;Transylvania&quot; and &quot;Carmania&quot;.

Due to the extent of the work that had to be carried out, &quot;Imperator&quot; remained at Liverpool until 21 February and during this time the company&#x27;s annual dinner was held on board before the ship returned to service on the North Atlantic. On 2 March 1920, the ship left New York, taking nine days to reach Southampton. During the voyage, &quot;Imperator&quot; developed a severe list that was found to be caused by a faulty ash ejector. Cunard decided that the ship was in need of a major overhaul and she was withdrawn from service.

Sir Arthur Rostron of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; passenger rescue fame and former captain of took command of &quot;Imperator&quot; in July 1920. The following year both &quot;Imperator&quot; and &quot;Aquitania&quot; were sent to Armstrong Whitworth shipyards to be converted from coal firing to oil.

The ship was renamed after the English queen Berengaria of Navarre, wife of Richard the Lionheart, in February 1921. The name deviated from the usual Cunard practice of naming ships after Roman provinces, but still retained the &quot;-ia&quot; suffix that was typically seen with other Cunard ships at the time.

In September 1925, a security alert at sea was triggered when the Cunard company offices in New York received a message stating there was a bomb aboard &quot;Berengaria&quot;; the vessel was then 1,200 miles out from New York, bound for Southampton. The ship was searched although the passengers and most crew were not informed about the reason. A fire drill was held just before the supposed time of detonation, so passengers could be placed close to their lifeboat stations without arousing suspicion. The bomb threat failed to materialize.

On 11 May 1932, &quot;Berengaria&quot; ran aground in the Solent. She was refloated an hour later.

In May 1934, &quot;Berengaria&quot; was again in the headlines when she ran aground on mud banks at Calshot on the Solent. She was pulled free by four tugs from Southampton. The vessel suffered no damage and the incident did not affect her sailing schedule.

Despite her German heritage, &quot;Berengaria&quot; served as flagship of the Cunard fleet until replaced by her sister ship, (also German: ex-&quot;SS Bismarck&quot;), in 1934 after the merger of Cunard with White Star Line. In later years, &quot;Berengaria&quot; was used for discounted Prohibition-dodging cruises, which earned her jocular nicknames like &quot;Bargainaria&quot; and &quot;Boringaria&quot;.

Toward the end of her service life, the ship suffered several electrical fires caused by aging wiring, and Cunard-White Star opted to retire her in 1938. She was sold to Sir John Jarvis, who had also purchased &quot;Olympic&quot;, to provide work for unemployed shipbuilders in Jarrow, County Durham. &quot;Berengaria&quot; sailed for the River Tyne under the command of Captain George Gibbons to be scrapped down to the waterline. Due to the size of the vessel and the outbreak of the Second World War, the final demolition took place only in 1946.

<doc id="1091473" wikidata="Q572741" url="?curid=1091473" title="Kwame Anthony Appiah">
<text>Kwame Akroma-Ampim Kusi Anthony Appiah ( ; born 8 May 1954) is an English-American philosopher and writer who has written about political philosophy, ethics, the philosophy of language and mind, and African intellectual history. Appiah is Professor of Philosophy and Law at New York University, where he joined the faculty in 2014, and has been a Silver Professor since 2025. He was previously the Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University. Appiah was elected President of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in January 2022.

==Early life and education==
Appiah was born in London, England, to Peggy Cripps Appiah (née Cripps), an English art historian and writer, and Joe Appiah, a lawyer, diplomat, and politician from Ashanti Region, Ghana. For two years (1970–1972) Joe Appiah was the leader of a new opposition party that was made by the country&#x27;s three opposing parties. Simultaneously, he was the president of the Ghana Bar Association. Between 1977 and 1978, he was Ghana&#x27;s representative at the United Nations.

Kwame Anthony Appiah was raised in Kumasi, Ghana, and educated at Bryanston School and Clare College, Cambridge, where he earned his BA (First Class) and PhD degrees in philosophy. He has three sisters: Isobel, Adwoa and Abena. As a child, he spent a good deal of time in England, staying with his grandmother Dame Isobel Cripps, widow of the English statesman Sir Stafford Cripps. 

== Ancestry ==
Appiah&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family has a long political tradition: Sir Stafford was a nephew of Beatrice Webb and was Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer (1947–1950) under Clement Attlee; his father, Charles Cripps, was Labour Leader of the House of Lords (1929–31) as Lord Parmoor in Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s government; Parmoor had been a Conservative MP before defecting to Labour. Through his grandmother Isobel Cripps, Appiah is a descendant of the British pharmacist James Crossley Eno.

Through Appiah&#x27;s father, a Nana of the Ashanti people, he is a direct descendant of Osei Tutu, the warrior emperor of pre-colonial Ghana, whose reigning successor, the Asantehene, is a distant relative of the Appiah family. Also among his African ancestors is the Ashanti nobleman Nana Akroma-Ampim I of Nyaduom, a warrior who Appiah was named after.

== Personal life ==
He lives with his husband, Henry Finder, an editorial director of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, in an apartment in Manhattan, and a home in Pennington, New Jersey with a small sheep farm.

Appiah became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1997. His nephew is the actor Adetomiwa Edun.

==Career==

Appiah taught philosophy and African-American studies at the University of Ghana, Cornell, Yale, Harvard, and Princeton Universities from 1981 to 1988. Until 2014, he was the Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor of Philosophy at Princeton (with a cross-appointment at the University Center for Human Values) and also was the Bacon-Kilkenny Professor of Law at Fordham University in the fall of 2008. Appiah also served on the board of PEN American Center and was on a panel of judges for the PEN/Newman&#x27;s Own First Amendment Award. He has lectured at many other institutions in the US, Germany, Ghana and South Africa, and Paris. Until the fall of 2009, he served as a trustee of Ashesi University College in Accra, Ghana. Since 2014, he has been a professor of philosophy and law at NYU.

His Cambridge dissertation explored the foundations of probabilistic semantics. In 1992, Appiah published &quot;In My Father&#x27;s House&quot;, which won the Herskovitz Prize for African Studies in English. Among his later books are &quot;Colour Conscious&quot; (with Amy Gutmann), &quot;The Ethics of Identity&quot; (2005), and &quot;Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers&quot; (2006). He has been a close collaborator with Henry Louis Gates Jr., with whom he edited &quot;Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African-American Experience&quot;. Appiah was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1995.

In 2008, Appiah published &quot;Experiments in Ethics&quot;, in which he reviews the relevance of empirical research to ethical theory. In the same year, he was recognised for his contributions to racial, ethnic, and religious relations when Brandeis University awarded him the first &quot;Joseph B. and Toby Gittler Prize&quot;.

As well as his academic work, Appiah has also published several works of fiction. His first novel, &quot;Avenging Angel&quot;, set at the University of Cambridge, involved a murder among the Cambridge Apostles; Sir Patrick Scott is the detective in the novel. Appiah&#x27;s second and third novels are &quot;Nobody Likes Letitia&quot; and &quot;Another Death in Venice&quot;.

Appiah has been nominated for, or received, several honours. He was the 2009 finalist in the arts and humanities for the Eugene R. Gannon Award for the Continued Pursuit of Human Advancement. In 2010, he was named by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine on its list of top global thinkers. On 13 February 2012, Appiah was awarded the National Humanities Medal at a ceremony at the White House.

Appiah currently chairs the jury for the Berggruen Prize, and serves on the Berggruen Institute&#x27;s Philosophy &amp; Culture Center&#x27;s Academic Board. He was elected as President of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in January 2022.

===Ideas===
Appiah&#x27;s early philosophical work dealt with probabilistic semantics and theories of meaning, but his more recent books have tackled philosophical problems of race and racism, identity, and moral theory. His current work tackles three major areas: 1. the philosophical foundations of liberalism; 2. the questioning of methods in arriving at knowledge about values; and 3. the connections between theory and practice in moral life, all of which concepts can also be found in his book &quot;Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers&quot;.

On postmodern culture, Appiah writes, &quot;Postmodern culture is the culture in which all postmodernisms operate, sometimes in synergy, sometimes in competition; and because contemporary culture is, in a certain sense to which I shall return, transnational, postmodern culture is globalthough that emphatically does not mean that it is the culture of every person in the world.&quot;

====Cosmopolitanism====
Appiah has been influenced by the cosmopolitan philosophical tradition, which stretches from Greek thinkers such as Diogenes to African American thinkers like W. E. B. Du Bois, among others. In his article &quot;Education for Global Citizenship&quot;, Appiah outlines his conception of cosmopolitanism. He therein defines cosmopolitanism as &quot;universality plus difference&quot;. Building from this definition, he asserts that the first takes precedence over the latter, that is: different cultures are respected &quot;not because cultures matter in themselves, but because people matter, and culture matters to people.&quot; Accordingly, cultural differences are to be respected in so far as they are not harmful to people and in no way conflict with our universal concern for every human&#x27;s life and well-being.

In his book &quot;Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers&quot; (2006), Appiah introduces two ideas that &quot;intertwine in the notion of cosmopolitanism&quot; (Emerging, 69). The first is the idea that we have obligations to others that are bigger than just sharing citizenship. The second idea is that we should never take for granted the value of life and become informed of the practices and beliefs of others. Kwame Appiah frequents university campuses to speak to students. One request he makes is, &quot;See one movie with subtitles a month.&quot;

In &quot;Lies that Bind&quot; (2018), Appiah attempts to deconstruct identities of creed, colour, country, and class.

====Criticism of Afrocentric world view====
Appiah has been a critic of contemporary theories of Afrocentrism. In his 1997 essay &quot;Europe Upside Down: Fallacies of the New Afrocentrism&quot;, he argues that current Afrocentricism is striking for &quot;how thoroughly at home it is in the frameworks of nineteenth century European thought&quot;, particularly as a mirror image to Eurocentric constructions of race and a preoccupation with the ancient world. Appiah also finds an irony in the conception that if the source of the West lies in ancient Egypt via Greece, then &quot;its legacy of ethnocentrism is presumably one of our moral liabilities.&quot;

==In popular culture==
* In 2007, Appiah was a contributing scholar in the PBS-broadcast documentary &quot;Prince Among Slaves&quot; produced by Unity Productions Foundation.
* In 2007, he also appeared in the TV documentary series &quot;&quot; as an on-screen contributor.
* Appiah appeared alongside a number of contemporary philosophers in Astra Taylor&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Examined Life&quot;, discussing his views on cosmopolitanism.
* In 2009, he was an on-screen contributor to the movie &quot;Herskovits: At the Heart of Blackness&quot;.
* In 2015, he became one of three contributors to the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; column &quot;The Ethicist&quot;, before assuming sole authorship of the column later that year.
* He delivered the BBC&#x27;s Reith Lectures in late 2016 on the theme of &quot;Mistaken Identities&quot;.
* In late 2016, he contended that Western civilization did not exist, and argued that many ostensibly unique Western attributes and values were instead shared among many &quot;non-western&quot; cultures and/or eras.
* In 2018, Appiah appeared in the episode &quot;Can We Live Forever?&quot; of the documentary series &quot;Explained&quot;.

LXVII, no. 2 (13 February 2020), pp. 18–20. Appiah concludes his review (p. 20): &quot;Lévi-Strauss... was... an inspired interpreter, a brilliant &quot;reader&quot;... When the landmarks of science succeed in advancing their subject, they need no longer be consulted: physicists don&#x27;t study Newton; chemists don&#x27;t pore over Lavoisier... If some part of Lévi-Strauss&#x27;s scholarly oeuvre survives, it will be because his scientific aspirations have not.&quot;

<doc id="1091476" wikidata="Q1383354" url="?curid=1091476" title="Harry Callahan (photographer)">
<text>Harry Morey Callahan (October 22, 1912 – March 15, 1999) was an American photographer and educator. He taught at both the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, and the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence.

Callahan&#x27;s first solo exhibition was at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1951. He had a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1976/1977. Callahan was a recipient of the Edward MacDowell Medal and the National Medal of Arts. He represented the United States in the Venice Biennale in 1978.

==Early life==
Harry Morey Callahan was born in Detroit, Michigan. He worked at Chrysler when he was a young man then left the company to study engineering at Michigan State University. He dropped out, returned to Chrysler and joined its camera club. Callahan began teaching himself photography in 1938. He formed a friendship with Todd Webb who was also to become a photographer. A talk given by Ansel Adams in 1941 inspired him to take his work seriously. In 1941, Callahan and Webb visited Rocky Mountain State Park but didn&#x27;t return with any photographs. In 1946 he was invited to teach photography at the Institute of Design in Chicago by László Moholy-Nagy. He moved to Rhode Island in 1961 to establish a photography program at the Rhode Island School of Design, eventually inviting close friend and fellow artist Aaron Siskind to join him, teaching there until his retirement in 1977.

==Career==
Callahan left almost no written records—no diaries, letters, scrapbooks or teaching notes. His technical photographic method was to go out almost every morning, walk through the city he lived in and take numerous pictures. He then spent almost every afternoon making proof prints of that day&#x27;s best negatives. Yet, for all his photographic activity, Callahan, at his own estimation, produced no more than half a dozen final images a year.

He photographed his wife and daughter and the streets, scenes and buildings of cities where he lived, showing a strong sense of line and form, and light and darkness. Even prior to birth, his daughter showed up in photographs of Eleanor&#x27;s pregnancy. From 1948 to 1953 Eleanor, and sometimes Barbara, were shown out in the landscape as a tiny counterpoint to large expanses of park, skyline or water.

He also worked with multiple exposures. Callahan&#x27;s work was a deeply personal response to his own life. He encouraged his students to turn their cameras on their own lives, leading by example. Callahan photographed his wife over a period of fifteen years, as his prime subject. Eleanor was essential to his art from 1947 to 1960. He photographed her everywhere—at home, in the city streets, in the landscape; alone, with their daughter, in black and white and in color, nude and clothed, distant and close. He tried several technical experiments—double and triple exposure, blurs, large and small format film.

Callahan was one of the few innovators of modern American photography noted as much for his work in color as for his work in black and white. In 1955 Edward Steichen included his work in The Family of Man, MoMA&#x27;s popular international touring exhibition.

In 1956, he received the Graham Foundation Award, which allowed him to spend a year in France with his family from 1957 to 1958. He settled in Aix-en-Provence, where he took many photographs.

Along with the painter Richard Diebenkorn, he represented the United States in the Venice Biennale in 1978.

In 1994, he selected 130 original prints with the help of the gallery owner Peter MacGill, and brought them together under the name of &quot;French Archives,&quot; to offer them to the Maison Européenne de la Photographie in Paris. Some of these images were taken in Aix-en-Provence and in the South of France, and are the subject of a temporary exhibition at the Granet Museum in Aix-en-Provence in 2019.

Callahan left behind 100,000 negatives and over 10,000 proof prints. The Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona maintains his photographic archives. In 2013, Vancouver Art Gallery received a gift of almost 600 Callahan photographs from the Larry and Cookie Rossy Family Foundation.

==Personal life==
Callahan met his future wife, Eleanor Knapp, on a blind date in 1933. At that time she was a secretary at Chrysler Motors in Detroit and he was a clerk in the parts department. They married three years later. In 1950 their daughter Barbara was born.

Callahan died in Atlanta in 1999. His wife Eleanor died on February 28, 2012, in Atlanta at the age of 95.

<text>Fishbourne is a village between Wootton and Ryde, on the Isle of Wight.

The name &quot;Fishbourne&quot; might mean &quot;stream of fish&quot; or &quot;fish spring.&quot;

It is positioned on the eastern bank of Wootton Creek, and includes the terminal for the Wightlink car ferry from Portsmouth.

Fishbourne, together with the adjoining Kite Hill area, became a civil parish in 2006 and has a parish council. The parish includes the ruined Norman abbey (founded 1132) and the Benedictine monastery including Quarr Abbey (founded in the early 1900s).

The Royal Victoria Yacht Club and the &#x27;Fishbourne Inn&#x27; are located near the ferry terminal.

Public transport is provided by Southern Vectis bus routes 4 and 9, which stop on the main road, and operate to East Cowes, Newport and Ryde.

==Governance==
Fishbourne is part of the electoral ward called Binstead and Fishbourne. This ward covers much of the Binstead district of Ryde parish and at the 2011 Census had a total population of 3,185.

<doc id="1091486" wikidata="Q3282901" url="?curid=1091486" title="It Just Gets Worse">
<text>It Just Gets Worse is the sixth album by the grindcore band Anal Cunt, released on November 9, 1999, on Earache Records.

==Recording information==
The album was recorded between August 1998 and August 1999 (except tracks 38 and 39 which were recorded and mixed in August 1997), although the majority of it was recorded after the band&#x27;s 1998 tour in Japan. The guitar and drums were recorded on a 4-track at Anal Cunt&#x27;s practice space and the vocals were recorded on a PA in the studio, where vocalist Seth Putnam mixed it. The album was then released after their 1999 European tour with the band Flächenbrand and was the last of the band&#x27;s albums released under the Earache label which they got dropped from in May 2000. &quot;Your Kid Committed Suicide Because You Suck&quot; was originally titled &quot;Connor Clapton Committed Suicide Because His Father Sucks&quot;. &quot;Chris Barnes Is a Pussy&quot; was based on an alleged incident that involved Putnam being attacked by Six Feet Under&#x27;s roadies, while their vocalist Chris Barnes fled to his tour bus after a scuffle between the two.

<doc id="1091488" wikidata="Q392615" url="?curid=1091488" title="Siemens Combino">
<text>The Siemens Combino is a low-floor tram produced by Siemens Mobility (formerly Duewag). The first prototype was produced in 1996 at the Duewag works in Düsseldorf; the trams were later built in Krefeld-Uerdingen.

Due to its modular design using standardised components, and the resulting reduced costs, the Combino was for a time one of the most successful tram types. They were sold in six countries and a further development was sold to two others.

In 2007, a new generation of Combinos was sold to Bern, known as the Combino Classic. This was an updated version of the original design intended to correct defects in the joints between modules. Fourteen of these were produced in 2011 with 12 going to Erfurt and two to Nordhausen. Subsequently, the model was again renamed and is now known as the Avenio M.

The original Combino trams were a multi-articulated design with alternating wheeled and suspended sections. For Metro Transportes Sul de Tejo and in Budapest, Siemens developed a new version called the Combino Plus or Combino Supra. Unlike the Combino, it does not have suspended sections but rather two axles under each body section. In essence, it is like a train of two axle cars. This design has been developed into the Avenio.

==Technical specifications==
The tram is largely made out of aluminium, with a welded underframe to which the body framework is bolted in sections, which means that the Combino can easily be adapted to different lengths, widths and gauges. The length of the trams varies from for the three-section version used in Erfurt, Nordhausen and Melbourne, to a world record for the six-section Combino Plus in Budapest, accommodating between 100 and 250 passengers. All versions are designed to have a floor height and a axle load and can be built as a one-way or a two-way vehicle.

They usually take 600 V DC overhead power and convert this to 400 V 3-phase AC power for the regenerative low wear motors via 3 IGBT PWM inverters. On board controls, lighting and air conditioning run at 24 V DC.

For Nordhausen, three Combino Duo trams were built with an additional diesel propulsion system, courtesy of a BMW M67 3.9-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine. They are used on a tram-train service along part of the unelectrified Harzquerbahn.

==2004 recall==

On March 12, 2004, Siemens admitted to problems concerning the stability of the car bodies and, as a precautionary measure, instructed all public transportation services to take all Combinos with a service distance of more than out of service. The torsion forces produced when the tram travelled through reverse curves were much higher than anticipated, leading to cracks around the articulations between modules. Subsequently, hairline cracks were found in the joints of the aluminium bodies, which could cause the roof to collapse in the case of an accident.

The problem was acute in Combino cars that had run more than . Cracks were reported on the connections between the sidewalls and the roof girders such that the safety of passengers in the wheel-less modules could not be assured in the event of a severe collision. These flaws were reported in many cities that had adopted the Combinos, such as Düsseldorf, Freiburg, Augsburg, Erfurt, Hiroshima, Nordhausen, Basel, Potsdam, Bern, Amsterdam and Melbourne.

Siemens launched a three-stage process of rebuilding the 454 vehicles affected. Under this process the Combino modules were reinforced to give an expected 30-year life.

==Operators==

===Overview===

Around 500 trams went into service in the following cities:

Twenty-two trams were ordered for a planned tram network in Verona and ten for the Alicante tram network, but the contracts were cancelled because of the technical problems noted in this article.

The prototype Combino tram was also demonstrated on tram networks in other cities, including Barcelona in 1997.

===Potsdam===
In 1997 the public transportation authorities of the city of Potsdam were the first to purchase Combino cars when they ordered a total of 48 cars, each long to be delivered from 1998 to 2009. The advantages of its low-floor technology were stressed during the introduction. A total of 48 cars were to be bought through 2009. The order from Potsdam was of great importance for advertising the Combino in other cities. Cars from Potsdam were frequently used for demonstrations.

After a short period of service, many inhabitants of Potsdam noticed noises during the operation of the cars louder than those of the previously used Tatra cars. In March 2004, the 16 Potsdam cars were taken out of service. As a replacement, several Tatra cars which had been given to museums were taken back into service. The shortage was aggravated by the fact that several old cars had been sold to Hungary just a month before. In June 2004, Potsdam and Siemens &quot;amicably&quot; declared that the at the time 32 outstanding cars were not going to be delivered. This decision is likely to have consequences for other cities.

Between 2017 and 2019 eight of the Potsdam Combinos were extended with an extra two modules, increasing their length to .

===Amsterdam===

In June 2004, the first Amsterdam Combinos passed the mileage threshold of and were taken out of service. Earlier, Siemens technicians had identified stress fractures in the door segments of two of Amsterdam&#x27;s oldest cars. But, according to Siemens, those turned out not to be dangerous, which is why the cars continued to be used. At the end of April 2004, it was decided not to call upon the twelve undelivered cars which were outstanding at that time.

===Kaohsiung Demonstrator===

A D2-class Melbourne tram was borrowed by Siemens for a demonstrator in Kaohsiung for a three-month period in 2003–2004.

The city did not follow through with purchasing the cars or building a line after the trial. In 2013 the city began construction of the Circular LRT line, which utilises CAF Urbos vehicles.

===Poznań===

Poznań announced in 2002 a tender for low-floor trams. Siemens won the contract with Combino. Poznań ordered 14 trams, each consisting of five modules, three double doors and three bogies, identical to the Amsterdam version. The first Combino entered service at the end of 2003. Due to flaws in construction, not all trams were in active service. An agreement between Poznań and Siemens provided that the city would pay the fraction (31%) of trams&#x27; cost only after the refit of all 14 Combinos. Combinos were usually used on the Poznański Szybki Tramwaj (Poznań Fast Tram) (light rail), that is on lines 14, 15 and 16 until they got replaced by Solaris Tramino trams. Starting from then Combinos are used on different lines to provide access to low-floor trams in other parts of Poznań.

==Siemens Combino Supra==

The original Combino model (Combino MkI) is produced on request but sold as &quot;Avenio M&quot;. To Budapest (Hungary) and Almada (Portugal), Siemens provided trams based on an older ADtranz design, under the name Combino Supra. These Combinos have thin stainless steel rather than aluminium carbodies. Siemens also expressed a desire to sell the Viennese Ultra Low Floor (ULF), another 100%-low-floor model, to other cities. The first two Combino Supras were delivered on 14 March 2006 to Budapest.

After serious initial teething problems in Budapest, which involved problems with the door mechanism and led the trams being taken out of service, the Combino Supra trams there began regular service during 2006. After they had been repaired, Budapest&#x27;s government decided that they would return them to Siemens. However, this did not happen because of contractual terms. The local public transport company began using them in 2007 and they eventually began working successfully again.

<text>The yellow oriole (Icterus nigrogularis) is a passerine bird in the family Icteridae. It should not be confused with the green oriole, sometimes alternatively called the Australasian yellow oriole (&quot;Oriolus flavocinctus&quot;), which is an Old World oriole.

==Distribution and habitat==
The yellow oriole is also called the plantain and small corn bird, and in Venezuela it is known as &quot;gonzalito&quot;. It breeds in northern South America in Colombia, Venezuela, Trinidad, the Guianas, and parts of northern Brazil, (northern Roraima state, and eastern Amapá). The yellow oriole is a bird of open woodland, scrub, and gardens.

==Breeding==
Its nest is a -long hanging basket, suspended from the end of a branch. The normal clutch is three pale green or grey eggs.

==Description==
This bird is long, and weighs , with mainly yellow plumage, as its name suggests. The adult male has a black eye mask, thin black throat line, black tail, and black wings, with a white wing bar and some white feather edging.

The female is similar, but slightly duller, and the juvenile bird has an olive-tinged yellow back, and lacks black on the face.

==Taxonomy==
Of the four subspecies of yellow oriole, three are restricted to islands. They differ from the widespread nominate race of the mainland in body and bill size, and minor plumage details.

==Diet==
The species eats mainly large insects, but also consumes nectar and some fruit (such as berries, cherries, mangoes and bananas).

==Call==
The song of the yellow oriole is a pleasant, melodious fluting, with some buzzing. The calls include a cat-like whine and chattering noises.

<doc id="1091492" wikidata="Q1531455" url="?curid=1091492" title="Holden Nova">
<text>The Holden Nova is a compact car which was manufactured by Toyota Australia as a badge engineered Toyota Corolla between August 1989 and 1996. It was a result of the Button car plan which attempted to rationalise the Australian car manufacturing industry. The Nova was sold and marketed under the Holden nameplate, and although referred to as the GM S platform, was nearly identical to the Corolla. However it received minor stylistic changes. The Nova was sold as a four-door sedan and five-door hatchback.

Initially assembled at Toyota&#x27;s Dandenong plant, in 1994 production was transferred to Altona.

In all years, the Nova was outsold by the Toyota Corolla in Australia, and the car was replaced by the Holden Astra in 1996.

== First generation (LE, LF; 1989–1994) ==
The LE and LF series, based on the Corolla E90 were sold between August 1989 and September 1994. The LE was offered with Toyota&#x27;s 1.4-litre engine (hatchback only) and 1.6-litre engine, in Holden&#x27;s traditional SL (hatchback only), SLX and SLE trims. The LF Nova, available from October 1991, added fuel injection to the 1.6-litre unit, now rated at . The SLE hatchback was replaced by a GS model, although SLE continued as a trim on the sedan, then in October 1992, a fuel-injected 1.8-litre engine was offered for the GS hatchback. The 1.4-litre option and the SLEs were unavailable from 1993.


== Second generation (LG; 1994–1996) ==
The LG Nova was sold between 1994 and 1996, although a smaller range was offered. The SLX trim level was equipped with a 1.6-litre engine, while the GS trim level denoted the fitment of the 1.8-litre engine. Four-door sedan and five-door hatchback options were offered for both levels, and all engines featured fuel injection.

<doc id="1091494" wikidata="Q5645990" url="?curid=1091494" title="Hampden House">
<text>Hampden House is a country house in the village of Great Hampden, between Great Missenden and Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire. It is named after the Hampden family. The Hampdens (later Earls of Buckinghamshire) are recorded as owning the site from before the Norman conquest. They lived continually in the house until 1938.

==Early history==
The core of the present house is Elizabethan. However the south wing known as King John&#x27;s tower, for some anachronistic reason, dates to the 14th century. This tower is constructed of clunch, a building material peculiar to Buckinghamshire, which is a combination of chalk and mud. The tower has traceried Gothic windows and the remains of the original spiral staircase.

A legend, relevant to this part of the house, is that King Edward III and the Black Prince stayed at Hampden House. During the stay the prince and his Hampden host were jousting, when a quarrel arose, during which the prince was punched in the face by his host. This act of &quot;lèse majesté&quot; caused the king and Prince to quit the place in great wrath, and cause their host to forfeit some of his estates to the crown. There is, however no documentary evidence for this act, or of the subsequent revenge although the Black Prince is known to have possessed land in nearby Princes Risborough during his life.

The greater part of the original house was rebuilt in brick in the 17th century, this was again altered in the 18th century. The East wing overlooking the gardens is of a severe classical 18th century style, built between two earlier wings.

The chief feature of the grounds is &#x27;The Glade&#x27;, an avenue through the woods bordered by rhododendrons and ancient oaks. It is terminated by two small lodges known, because of their design, as the &#x27;Pepper Pots&#x27;. It is said that the avenue was cut through the wood to facilitate easy access to the house for Queen Elizabeth I when she was entertained at Hampden, during one of her progresses, by Griffith Hampden Esq.

==Gothic rebuilding==
It is the north and west ranges of the house that have never received the architectural acclaim they deserve, remodelled circa 1750 to a design by the architect Thomas Iremonger, with battlements and ogee topped windows, they are a form of gothic known as Strawberry Hill. This style predates the so-called invention of Strawberry Hill Gothic at Horace Walpole&#x27;s house by nearly twenty years.

The interior of the house was also remodelled at this time, when a suite of magnificent state rooms were created with remarkable rococo ceilings, and superb marble fireplaces. One fireplace is of especial note carved by Sir Henry Cheere. The , panelled, Great Hall with its huge fireplace is the largest room in the house.

==Hampden and Hobart families==
Also in the grounds is the parish church, containing many memorials to the Hampden family including a monument to John Hampden, the celebrated patriot, who died of wounds received at the Battle of Chalgrove during the English Civil War in 1643 fighting for the Parliamentarians. He had earlier achieved fame and notoriety by his refusal to pay the Ship Money tax, introduced by the near bankrupt Charles I. Hampden was prosecuted for refusing to pay the tax on his lands in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. He was tried and found guilty, and consequently became a public hero, known as &#x27;The Patriot&#x27;. The spot where he refused to pay is marked by a monument in the grand avenue at Hampden House, although the exact location of the actual site is in dispute.

Like many old and aristocratic families, the Hampdens, for generations closely associated with the Whig party, eventually found themselves with financial problems. These were exacerbated by Richard Hampden who, while Treasurer of the Navy, invested heavily personally, and with government funds, in the South Sea Bubble; the resultant crash in 1720 was devastating for the family fortune. Large parts of the estate were sold until only the house and its immediate surroundings remained in the family&#x27;s hands. The family never completely regained its former position or wealth.

The true male line of the Hampden family eventually died out. In 1824, the 5th Earl of Buckinghamshire inherited Hampden House and its estates from the heirless Hampden family. In 1656, his ancestor Sir John Hobart, 3rd Baronet had married Mary Hampden, daughter and co-heiress of &quot;the Patriot&quot; John Hampden. The 5th Earl then joined the Hampden name to his own. The present head of the family is George Hobart-Hampden, 10th Earl of Buckinghamshire.

==Hampden House today==

As a result of the family&#x27;s financial problems, Hampden House suffered; cracked brickwork was not repaired but rendered in cement, necessary repairs were not carried out, and general deterioration set in, until in 1938 the family decided to let the house. The first tenants were a private girls&#x27; school. The interiors suffered greatly under this regime. The second tenants, Hammer film company, specialising in the making of horror films, no doubt saw the gothic aspects of the house as an attraction as they appeared in many of their films, and notably the 1980 &quot;Hammer House of Horror&quot; UK TV series and 1984s Hammer House of Mystery and Suspense.

Salvation for Hampden House finally came with its freehold sale, to Market Run-off Services, now Hampden Plc, a Specialist Insurance and Financial Support Services company, which between 1986 and 1989 executed a huge programme of essential rebuilding. The magnificent state rooms were restored to their former glory, while the unseen upper floors and service areas were converted to internally modern offices. These offices have since been converted to luxurious bedrooms.

The house and grounds are still used occasionally for filming, and though not open to the public, the state rooms are available for hire as a wedding venue Hampden Weddings. The estate also boasts a driven pheasant shoot voted one of the twenty best in England by &#x27;The Field&#x27; magazine The building is a Grade I listed building.

<doc id="1091502" wikidata="Q1090878" url="?curid=1091502" title="General Prologue">
<text>The &quot;General Prologue&quot; is the first part of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer. It introduces the frame story, in which a group of pilgrims travelling to the shrine of Thomas Becket in Canterbury agree to take part in a storytelling competition, and describes the pilgrims themselves. The Prologue is arguably the most familiar section of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, depicting traffic between places, languages and cultures, as well as introducing and describing the pilgrims who will narrate the tales.

==Synopsis==
The frame story of the poem, as set out in the 858 lines of Middle English which make up the General Prologue, is of a religious pilgrimage. The narrator, Geoffrey Chaucer, is in The Tabard Inn in Southwark, where he meets a group of &#x27;sundry folk&#x27; who are all on the way to Canterbury, the site of the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket, a martyr reputed to have the power of healing the sinful.

The setting is April, and the prologue starts by singing the praises of that month whose rains and warm western wind restore life and fertility to the earth and its inhabitants. This abundance of life, the narrator says, prompts people to go on pilgrimages; in England, the goal of such pilgrimages is the shrine of Thomas Becket. The narrator falls in with a group of pilgrims, and the largest part of the prologue is taken up by a description of them; Chaucer seeks to describe their &#x27;condition&#x27;, their &#x27;array&#x27;, and their social &#x27;degree&#x27;. The narrator expresses admiration and praise towards the pilgrims&#x27; abilities.

The pilgrims include a knight; his son, a squire; the knight&#x27;s yeoman; a prioress, accompanied by a nun and the nun&#x27;s priest; a monk; a friar; a merchant; a clerk; a sergeant of law; a franklin; a haberdasher; a carpenter; a weaver; a dyer; a tapestry weaver; a cook; a shipman; a doctor of physic; a wife of Bath; a parson and his brother, a plowman; a miller; a manciple; a reeve; a summoner; a pardoner; the Host (a man called Harry Bailey); and Chaucer himself. At the end of this section, the Host proposes that the group ride together and entertain one another with stories. He lays out his plan: each pilgrim will tell two stories on the way to Canterbury and two on the way back. Whoever has told the most meaningful and comforting stories, with &quot;the best sentence and moost solaas&quot; (line 798) will receive a free meal paid for by the rest of the pilgrims upon their return. The company agrees and makes the Host its governor, judge, and record keeper. They set off the next morning and draw straws to determine who will tell the first tale. The Knight wins and prepares to tell his tale.

==Structure==
The &quot;General Prologue&quot; establishes the frame for the &quot;Tales&quot; as a whole (or of the intended whole) and introduces the characters/storytellers. These are introduced in the order of their rank in accordance with the three medieval social estates (clergy, nobility, and commoners and peasantry). These characters are also representative of their estates and models with which the others in the same estate can be compared and contrasted.

The structure of the General Prologue is also intimately linked with the narrative style of the tales. As the narrative voice has been under critical scrutiny for some time, so too has the identity of the narrator himself. Though fierce debate has taken place on both sides, (mostly contesting that the narrator either is, or is not, Geoffrey Chaucer), most contemporary scholars believe that the narrator is meant to be Chaucer himself to some degree. Some scholars, like William W. Lawrence, claim that the narrator is Geoffrey Chaucer in person. Others, like Marchette Chute for instance, contest that the narrator is instead a literary creation like the other pilgrims in the tales.

Chaucer makes use of his extensive literary and linguistic knowledge in the &quot;General Prologue&quot; by interplaying Latin, French, and English words against each other. French was considered a hierarchal, courtly, and aristocratic language during the Middle Ages, whereas Latin was the language of learning. The opening lines of The Canterbury Tales show a diversity of phrasing by including words of French origin like &quot;droghte,&quot; &quot;veyne,&quot; and &quot;licour&quot; alongside English terms for nature: &quot;roote,&quot; &quot;holt and heeth,&quot; and &quot;croppes.&quot;

==Sources==

John Matthews Manly attempted to identify pilgrims with real fourteenth-century people. In some instances, such as the Summoner and the Friar, he attempts localization to a small geographic area. The Man of Law is identified as Thomas Pynchbek (also Pynchbeck), who was chief baron of the exchequer. Sir John Bussy, an associate of Pynchbek, is identified as the Franklin. The Pembroke estates near Baldeswelle supplied the portrait for the unnamed Reeve.

Sebastian Sobecki argues that the General Prologue is a pastiche of the historical Harry Bailey&#x27;s surviving 1381 poll-tax account of Southwark&#x27;s inhabitants.

Jill Mann argued that the descriptions of pilgrims representing a spectrum of social roles is best understood as standing in the tradition of medieval Estate satire. Stephen Rigby observed the General Prologue as commenting on medieval social inequality, noting that Chaucerians are divided in their interpretations of Chaucer&#x27;s outlook: some see Chaucer as defending the social order; others argue that he meant to criticize it; and others still hold that he intended to leave it open to the reader&#x27;s interpretation. On such interpretations, the pilgrims are less likely to correspond to historical individuals and more likely to be versions of representative &#x27;types&#x27;: the friar, for example, being a figure out of existing anti-fraternal literature.

==Translation==

The following are the first 18 lines of the General Prologue. The text was written in a dialect associated with London and spellings associated with the then-emergent Chancery Standard.

In modern prose:

When April with its sweet showers has pierced March&#x27;s drought to the root, bathing every vein in such liquid by whose virtue the flower is engendered, and when Zephyrus with his sweet breath has also enlivened the tender plants in every wood and field, and the young sun is halfway through Aries, and small birds that sleep all night with an open eye make melodies (their hearts so goaded by Nature), then people long to go on pilgrimages, and palmers seek faraway shores and distant saints known in sundry lands, and especially they wend their way to Canterbury from every shire of England to seek the holy blessed martyr, who helped them when they were ill.

<text>Sawtelle is a neighborhood in West Los Angeles, on the Westside of Los Angeles, California. The short-lived City of Sawtelle grew around the Pacific Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, later the Sawtelle Veterans Home, and was incorporated as a city in 1899. Developed by the Pacific Land Company, and named for its manager W. E. Sawtelle, the City of Sawtelle was independent for fewer than 30 years before it was annexed by the City of Los Angeles.

Sawtelle is noted for its thriving Japanese American community, busy restaurants and arthouse movie theaters. It has strong roots in Japanese-American history. In recognition of its historical heritage, the area was designated Sawtelle Japantown in 2015.

==History ==

=== Early history ===
The future site of Sawtelle has been an important location in the Los Angeles Basin for centuries, due to its abundant spring water. The village of Kuruvungna, translated as &quot;place where we are in the sun,&quot; has been inhabited for thousands of years by the Tongva people, centered on the Kuruvungna Village Springs. The springs still flow today, although they are constrained by urban development, especially their vicinity to University High School.

The first Europeans to visit the area were Gaspar de Portolá and his party, who camped in the area in 1769. Portolá and his party encountered an active community amidst lush greenery, centered on the springs. In 1839, the future site of Sawtelle was included in the Rancho San Vicente y Santa Mónica, a rancho granted to Francisco Sepúlveda II. By 1874, the owners of the land were Robert Symington Baker and John Percival Jones.

The Pacific Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, an old soldiers&#x27; home, opened in 1888 in the vicinity. The institution grew steadily, and the continuous expansion of the veterans&#x27; home prompted the construction of multiple railroad lines to the complex. With the growth of the Pacific Branch, the residents of the established city of Santa Monica quickly began objecting to the veterans&#x27; large economic and political influence, as well as their drunkenness. After an 1895 Santa Monica school board election was decided by the votes of the veterans, the Santa Monica school district boundaries were redrawn to exclude the veterans&#x27; home. Despite this animosity by Santa Monica, other parties remained interested in the area, with its large population of veterans drawing federal pensions.

=== Founding ===
In 1896, the Pacific Land Company purchased a tract, just south of the veterans&#x27; home, and hired S. H. Taft to develop a new town. When the Pacific Land Company attempted to secure a post office for the new town, the postal authorities objected to the name &quot;Barrett,&quot; after veterans&#x27; home manager A. W. Barrett, on account of its similarity to the city of Bassett. In 1899, the name of the town was formally changed to &quot;Sawtelle,&quot; after Pacific Land Company associate W. E. Sawtelle, who became the company president in 1900.

The Pacific Branch served as an attraction for both tourists and local real estate speculators. In 1906, the Pacific Branch became a stop on the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad&#x27;s “Balloon Route”, a popular tour of local attractions conducted by an entrepreneur who escorted tourists via a rented streetcar, often from downtown Los Angeles to the ocean and back. In 1905, residential lots and larger tracts in the new Westgate Subdivision, which joined “the beautiful Soldier’s Home”, and which were owned and promoted by Jones and Baker’s Santa Monica Land and Water Company, were for sale. The new community of Sawtelle developed around the Pacific Branch when veterans’ families, as well as veterans themselves who were drawing relief, settled there. Most of Sawtelle thus grew up after the veterans home was established.

=== Annexation by Los Angeles ===
The city of Los Angeles was steadily growing in the early 20th century, with the annexation of both incorporated and unincorporated land in Los Angeles County, empowered by its water supply from the newly constructed Los Angeles Aqueduct. Sawtelle residents began discussing the possibility of annexation in 1913, and voted for annexation on May 14, 1917, by a margin of three votes. The annexation was opposed by the city Board of Trustees, and was quickly contested in court by residents who claimed that they were not properly informed about Los Angeles&#x27; municipal debt. While the case was still pending in court, Los Angeles staged a coup.

The Los Angeles Police Department raided Sawtelle City Hall early on a Friday morning in 1918, seizing most of the city records, including the seal and the safe. One notable exclusion was the meeting minutes of the city Board of Trustees, which were in the personal custody of a trustee. Despite the seizure of City Hall by Los Angeles, the Sawtelle trustees held meetings in the council chamber for two months, until they moved to the home of the City Clerk in April 1918. The City of Sawtelle functioned as a government-in-exile for over two years, holding regular meetings, and unsuccessfully attempting to organize elections. The California Supreme Court declared the annexation invalid in September 1921, ending a conflict described by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as “one of the longest and most bitter fights in the history of municipal governments in the State.&quot; The Board of Trustees returned to City Hall on November 1, where they found that Los Angeles had taken their new firehoses and most of the chairs.

Despite their initial success, the Sawtelle city officials who resisted the annexation were replaced in the next municipal election by a slate of pro-annexation candidates. A second annexation referendum was held on June 2, 1922, and passed by a margin of over 800 votes. Sawtelle officially became a part of the City of Los Angeles in July 1922, in the 36th annexation in the city&#x27;s history.

=== Interwar period (1930s to 1950s) ===

Sawtelle&#x27;s history is in part defined by its Japanese American community, which formed as a response to exclusionary policies in other areas of Los Angeles. Many of Sawtelle&#x27;s early Japanese residents took up farming, despite a lack of bank loans and land ownership restrictions from the California Alien Land Law. By 1941, 26 garden centers were in operation in Sawtelle, most operated by Japanese immigrants and their descendants.

These are remnants of a larger Japanese American presence in the area before the population was disrupted by World War II, when many were displaced by Japanese-American internment.

=== The 1950s through the present day ===

There is some gang activity within the area, but it has decreased considerably since the early 2000s. The Sotel 13 gang has claimed Stoner Park and its surrounding community as its territory since the 1950s, and as of 2012 gang graffiti could still be found throughout the neighborhood.

==Geography==

The name Sawtelle may refer to a larger district that is part of Los Angeles, a smaller unincorporated area of Los Angeles County that by definition is not part of the city of Los Angeles, or a combination of these, sometimes known as the Sawtelle area. The name has also been used to refer only to the Veterans Administration complex, including the modern hospital (West Los Angeles Medical Center) and north of Wilshire Boulevard, the former site of the historical Sawtelle Veterans Home and outbuildings.

The incorporated area of Sawtelle, to the south of the unincorporated area, includes the Sawtelle neighborhood, a district of Los Angeles. It is roughly bounded by the Interstate 405 freeway to the east, National Boulevard to the south, Centinela Avenue to the west, and Bringham Avenue, San Vicente Boulevard, and the V.A. grounds on the north. Greater Los Angeles Health Center is in the unincorporated area. The area extends about to either side of Santa Monica Boulevard, running westward about 1.3 miles (2.1 km) from Interstate 405 (the San Diego Freeway) and Sawtelle Boulevard, toward Santa Monica, ending at Centinela Avenue. Because the incorporated Sawtelle area now represents the northern part of West Los Angeles, it is bounded on the north by Brentwood and Westwood, which bound West Los Angeles. To the south is the rest of West Los Angeles, which is not considered part of the Sawtelle district.

The smaller unincorporated area of Sawtelle is 576.5 acres, or , and completely surrounded by Los Angeles. On the south, the unincorporated area abuts the Sawtelle city district that is now part of West Los Angeles and the greater city of Los Angeles. On the north, it is bordered by Brentwood and Westwood. This unincorporated area consists of six parcels near the intersection of the San Diego Freeway and Santa Monica Boulevard, owned either by the US government or the state of California. A private utility company owns the seventh parcel. This area is under the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors&#x27; zoning control within the Third Supervisorial District. The unincorporated area contains the Wilshire Federal Building, the Los Angeles National Cemetery, the Wadsworth VA Hospital/West Los Angeles Medical Center, and many smaller federal office buildings.

The entire Sawtelle area includes portions of ZIP Codes 90049, 90064, and 90025 and all of ZIP Code 90073 (a P.O. ZIP Code within the 90025 area, used exclusively by the West Los Angeles Medical Center/Veterans Affairs Wadsworth Medical Hospital).

==Transportation==
Bus service in Sawtelle is primarily provided by Los Angeles Metro Bus and Santa Monica Big Blue Bus, with additional service from Culver CityBus. The Metro E Line runs along the south side of the neighborhood, with its Sawtelle stop at the Expo/Bundy station. The Westwood/VA Hospital station of the D Line Extension is expected to open in 2027, connecting the Sawtelle neighborhood to Downtown Los Angeles, Koreatown, and other notable Los Angeles neighborhoods via rapid transit.

Sawtelle is part of LA Department of Transportation&#x27;s Slow Streets program. By limiting car traffic and prompting drivers to slow down, the pilot program was implemented to reclaim neighborhood roads for pedestrians, joggers, children and people with disabilities. The neighborhood was rated one of Los Angeles&#x27;s 10 most walkable neighborhoods in 2017.

Sawtelle Boulevard is a major thoroughfare, and is the center of the local Japanese community. Other major streets in Sawtelle include Santa Monica Boulevard and Olympic Boulevard; freeway access is provided by the Santa Monica Freeway and the San Diego Freeway.

== Arts and culture ==
Sawtelle is home to two independent arthouse movie theaters that are important cultural institutions to greater Los Angeles&#x27;s film community. The Nuart Theatre was built in 1929. It showcases domestic and foreign independent films and holds regular screenings of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; and other midnight movies. Laemmele Royal Theater, originally known as the Tivoli, was built in 1924 and is one of Southern California&#x27;s last remaining single-screen theaters in daily operation.

The Village recording studio, located on Butler Avenue, has been used by many iconic artists. Albums recorded at The Village include Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;Aja&quot;, Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Joe&#x27;s Garage&quot;, and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Planet Waves&quot;. Many major motion picture and television soundtracks were also recorded here, including &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, &quot;Walk the Line&quot;, &quot;The X Files&quot;, &quot;Wall-E&quot;, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;. It has a famous mural on its south wall.

The Japanese Institute of Sawtelle, a cultural center for West Los Angeles&#x27;s Nikkei community, is on Sawtelle&#x27;s southern edge, on Corinth Avenue.

Stoner Park is a natural hub of the Sawtelle neighborhood with its attendant tennis courts, children&#x27;s playground, skate plaza, seasonal outdoor pool, recreation center and Japanese garden. It is at the end of Stoner Avenue.

As of 2024, Asahi Gakuen&#x27;s Santa Monica, Orange, and Torrance campuses have high school classes.

==Veterans Administration hospital, office buildings, and national cemetery==

The grounds of the former Veterans Home, which was established in 1888, along with a cemetery and hospital for former soldiers and sailors, is also referred to as &quot;Sawtelle.&quot; This area, containing former hospital and apartment buildings and the historical veteran&#x27;s home, and now converted to research and office space, is mostly north of Wilshire Boulevard. Since 1977, this area has formally included the Veterans Affairs (VA) Wadsworth Medical Center (now the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center), which is south of Wilshire Boulevard from the former veteran&#x27;s home site (see illustration above). This major hospital serves as part of the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. The veterans home and hospital areas are both located west of the modern Interstate 405 freeway (San Diego Freeway), which bisects this federal parcel of land. It was part of a controversial plan in the 1960s, in which the property was proposed to be exchanged for Hazard Park in Boyle Heights, which would become home to a new VA hospital. The plan was shelved after seven years because of heavy public opposition., and instead, the present West Los Angeles Medical Center was built as the new hospital, in 1977. The Los Angeles National Cemetery, which is located east of Interstate 405, between Sepulveda Boulevard and Veteran Avenue, contains the remains of some 85,000 veterans and family members from the Mexican War to the present. The Wilshire Federal Building (photo at right, description below) is also east of the 405 freeway, immediately south of Wilshire Boulevard and the cemetery.

=== Wilshire Federal Building ===
A major stand-alone federal office building in the area is the 19-story Wilshire Federal Building (completed 1969) at 11000 Wilshire Blvd, Westwood, Los Angeles. The federal building is the most prominent symbol of federal power in the Los Angeles area, and is thus a popular site for protests against government policies.

It includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Los Angeles field office.

==Demographics==
From the 1980 U.S. Census to the 1990 U.S. Census an increase in construction caused the population to increase by 6.7%; the addition of 692 dwelling units increased the units in Sawtelle by 10.6%. The 1990 census stated that there were 14,042 residents in Sawtelle. There was no racial majority at that time. Barbara Koh of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The racial percentages in Sawtelle in the 1990 Census were virtually unchanged from 1980&quot;. In 1990, 48% of the residents were Non-Hispanic White, 26% were Latino or Hispanic, 23% were Asian, and 3% were Black. According to 2005 Los Angeles County government estimates, the population of the unincorporated area of Sawtelle is 634.

==Public services==
The Los Angeles Police Department operates the West Los Angeles Community Police Station at 1663 Butler Avenue, 90025.

The Los Angeles Fire Department&#x27;s Station 59, located at 11505 West Olympic Boulevard, provides fire protection for Sawtelle and surrounding areas. In the LAFD&#x27;s command structure, it is organized in the West Bureau.

The West Los Angeles Regional Branch Library, a branch of the Los Angeles Public Library, is located at 11360 Santa Monica Boulevard.

==In fiction and popular culture==

* Neal Stephenson&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Snow Crash&quot; coins the name Fedland for the unincorporated Sawtelle area, because in the novel it is one of the few bits of land still under the direct control of the United States government (the rest of the city having been taken over by corporations).
* Director Michel Gondry filmed part of Beck&#x27;s video for &quot;Deadweight&quot; at the Nuart Theatre.
* Because of University High School&#x27;s proximity to major Hollywood studios, it has served as a shooting location for many films and television series, including &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;, &quot;Pineapple Express&quot;, &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Straight Outta Compton and&quot; &quot;Arrested Development&quot;.
* Khalid&#x27;s music video &quot;Young Dumb &amp; Broke&quot; and Janelle Monae&#x27;s &quot;Tightrope&quot; were shot at University High School.
* John Waters starred in a &quot;No Smoking&quot; theatrical trailer projected first at the Nuart Theatre in which he advised patrons to &quot;smoke anyway&quot;.
