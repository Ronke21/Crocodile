<text>Mehmed Said Pasha (‎; 1838–1914), also known as Küçük Said Pasha (&quot;Said Pasha the Younger&quot;) or Şapur Çelebi or in his youth as [[Mabeyn-i hümayun|Mabeyn]] Başkâtibi Said Bey, was an Ottoman monarchist, senator, statesman and editor of the Turkish newspaper &quot;Cerîde-i Havâdis&quot;. He served as grand vizier for nine years in total, seven times during the reign of Abdul Hamid II and twice during the Second Constitutional Monarchy. He was known for his opposition to the extension of foreign influence in the Ottoman Empire. He was among the statesmen who were disliked by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). However, in his last two grand vizierships, Said Pasha was supported by the CUP in the Chamber of Deputies, and his last grand vizierate ended in 1912 with a military memorandum against the Unionists.

== Early life ==
Mehmed Said was born in Erzurum. His father was Ali Namık Efendi, a foreign minister. According to his contemporary Petre Kharischirashvili, he was of Georgian descent. His education was in the madrasa, which started in Erzurum and continued in Istanbul. There he learned French. He joined the Kalemiye in Istanbul, and soon the petty civil service.

== Bureaucratic career ==
He returned to Erzurum for his first civil service assignment in 1853 where he worked in the eyalet&#x27;s bureau of commutations (&quot;tahrirat kalemi&quot;). In 1857 he joined the Anatolian army&#x27;s bureau of communications. Said went back to Istanbul, where he was the deputy clerk of the Supreme Council (&quot;Meclis-i Vâlâ halife kâtip).&quot; He then became chief of the Archipelago Vilayet municipal council (&quot;Adalar Bölgesi Belediye Dairesi reisi&quot;) and chief clerk of the Rumeli Inspection Committee (&quot;Rumeli Teftiş Heyeti başkatibi&quot;) following which he became the chief clerk of the government printing office (&quot;Matbaa-i Amire başkatibi&quot;). After a brief stint as chief clerk of the Court of Cassation (&quot;Dîvân-ı Ahkâm-ı Adliyye&quot; &quot;muhakemat başkatibi&quot;) he became director of communication of the Ministry of Trade (&quot;Ticaret Nezareti mektupçusu&quot;) before taking on the same role in the Ministry of Education.

Mehmed Said contributed to the provincial reform by writing the Regulation on the General Administration of Provinces (&quot;İdare-i Umumiye-i Vilayet Nizamnamesini&quot;). This caught the attention of Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha.

== High politics ==
He became first secretary to Sultan Abdul Hamid II shortly after the sultan&#x27;s accession, and is said to have contributed to the realizations of his majesty&#x27;s design of concentrating power in his own hands; later he became a senator, minister of the interior, minister of finance, royal treasurer, then governor of Ankara and then Bursa, justice minister, finally reaching the high post of grand vizier in 1879. It is not known what his role was in the 1876 coups d&#x27;état.

He was grand vizier seven times under Abdul Hamid II, and twice under his successor, Mehmed V.

=== First premiership ===
October 1879 can be accepted as the date when the political uncertainties of the beginning of Abdul Hamid&#x27;s reign ended and the power without question passed to the palace. During Said Pasha&#x27;s first grand viziership, he mostly dealt with financial and economic measures and tried to reduce government expenditures. He was dismissed from the position of grand vizier in June 1880.

=== Second premiership ===
He began his second term as Grand Vizier on September 12, 1880. The most important events of the premiership were the trial of Mithat Pasha in Yıldız Palace. Ottoman debts were then collected through the establishment of Ottoman Public Debt Administration with the Muharrem Decree. In 1881, France declared Tunisia a French colony a brief military campaign while in Egypt Urabi Pasha lost his nationalist struggle against the Europeans. Due to these events, Mehmed Said Pasha did not succeed in measures to reduce state debts and provide stability. He was dismissed as grand vizier on May 2, 1882, due to the direct intervention of the British in the Egypt issue.

=== Third premiership ===
However, two months later, the new grand vizier Abdurrahman Nureddin Pasha was dismissed as Grand Vizier since Abdul Hamid did not share his concern on the European attempts to invade Egypt, which started with the bombing of Alexandria in July. Mehmed Said Pasha was appointed grand vizier for the third time on 12 July 1882. This period began when Egypt came under British control. He was dismissed two months later on 30 November 1882 due to clashes between himself and the sultan. He was arrested three days later.

=== Fourth premiership ===

He was brought back to the grand viziership for the forth time on 3 December 1882. This time his ministry lasted for two years and two months. In this period, there was civil service reform. Recruitment, appointment, promotion and retirement of civil servants were reformed and reorganized. He also brought about educational reforms. First of all, importance was given to the opening of a large number of new schools in the country. However, he wanted to suppress the Bulgarian nationalist revolt that broke out in Eastern Rumelia, but Sultan Abdul Hamid thought that these troops could use them against him, so he vetoed the operation. On September 18, 1885, Eastern Rumelia was annexed by Bulgaria. He was dismissed from office a week later. For ten years he was without a job.

=== Fifth premiership ===
During the height of the Hamidian massacres, Western states demanded reforms. In order to implement these reforms, Said Pasha was brought to the grand viziership for the fifth time on 8 June 1895. This time, he was at odds with the Sultan because of the Armenians demonstrating in Istanbul. Said Pasha claimed that the War Mınıster Nazım Pasha was negligent in his duties of quelling unrest and demanded that he be removed from office. However, Abdul Hamid did not agree to this and dismissed Said Pasha after less than three months.

Two months later the took refuge at the British embassy in Constantinople, and, though then assured of his personal liberty and safety, remained practically under house arrest with his son for six years.

=== Sixth premiership ===

In November 1901, he was appointed grand vizier again after he wrote to the Sultan that he would serve as a Grand Vizier like a bailiff. However this new interpretation of his role in government was too much for him and he complained that the premiership was reduced to being like a scarecrow. After two years in this post, he had a disagreement with the War Minister Mehmed Rıza Pasha about the problems in the Rumelian army. He gave an ultimatum to the Sultan that if he did not arrest Rıza, he would resign. Said was instead dismissed one month after this resignation threat.

=== Seventh premiership ===
He came into temporary prominence again during the revolution of 1908. On 22 July he succeeded Mehmed Ferid Pasha as grand vizier, and mediated the declaration of the Second Constitutional Monarchy. However, in the first two weeks, disagreements arose within the government delegation over who would be the minister of war and who would be the minister of the navy. Said Pasha was uneasy about the sultan&#x27;s intervention in the establishment of this government. For this reason, he resigned on 6 August 1908, after two weeks of vizierate, citing the Sultan&#x27;s interference in the cabinet list, and he was replaced by the more liberal Kâmil Pasha, at the insistence of the Young Turks.

Also during 1908, Mehmed Said Pasha bought the famed Istanbul arcade in the Beyoğlu district, today known as Çiçek Pasajı (&quot;Flower Passage&quot;). The modern name became common in the 1940s; during Mehmed Said Pasha&#x27;s ownership in the 1900s and 1910s, the arcade was known as &quot;Sait Paşa Pasajı&quot; (&quot;Said Pasha Passage&quot;).

=== Eighth and ninth premiership ===
Following the resignation of Ibrahim Hakkı Pasha in the wake of Italy&#x27;s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire in 1911, he was again called to the premiership. He attempted to resign on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1911 on disagreements with his cabinet on whether to dissolve parliament, but he was reappointed the same day. His time as Grand Vizier was under the de facto rule of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) and the War Minister Mahmut Şevket Pasha.

In the &quot;election of clubs&quot; held in February 1912, he allowed the CUP to seize the parliament through egregious voter fraud and intimidation. However, with Şevket Pasha&#x27;s departure from government and another Albanian revolt, a military clique known as the Savior Officers who backed the defeated Freedom and Accord Party forced him to resign from the grand viziership for the last time.

Following his departure Said Pasha became head of the Council of State and then as the head of the Ottoman Senate.

== Death ==
Just before the start of World War I, he developed bronchitis and died on 1 March 1914 in Istanbul. He was buried at the entrance of Eyüp Sultan Mosque.

<text>Stephen Wade (14 December 1887 – 22 December 1956) was one of England&#x27;s executioners from 1940 until 1955. He assisted Tom and Albert Pierrepoint on 31 occasions and also carried out 28 executions as principal executioner.

One of his first assignments was on 31 October 1942, assisting Albert Pierrepoint in his first execution as a senior, that of Antonio Mancini at HMP Pentonville. After the Second World War, he worked for a time at a coach dealership in his home town of Doncaster. His first execution as principal executioner was the hanging of Arthur Charles at HMP Durham on 26 March 1946. Following this, he was usually selected by the Sheriff of Yorkshire for executions at HMP Armley from 1947 onwards. The execution of Walter Sharpe (aged 20) took place at the prison on 30 March 1950, when he was assisted by Harry Allen.

His final assignment was the execution of Alec Wilkinson (aged 22), whom he hanged at Leeds on 12 August 1955. Wade&#x27;s assistant at this execution was Robert Leslie Stewart. Wilkinson had been convicted of murdering Clara Farrell, his mother-in-law.

Wade died in Doncaster Royal Infirmary, of stomach cancer, shortly after his 69th birthday.

<doc id="1099178" wikidata="Q1214915" url="?curid=1099178" title="The Muppets Take Manhattan">
<text>The Muppets Take Manhattan is a 1984 American musical comedy-drama film directed by Frank Oz and the third theatrical film featuring the Muppets. The film stars Muppet performers Jim Henson, Oz, Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Richard Hunt, Jerry Nelson, as well as special appearances by Art Carney, James Coco, Dabney Coleman, Gregory Hines, Linda Lavin, Liza Minnelli, Joan Rivers, and Brooke Shields. Filmed in New York City during the prior summer, it was released theatrically on July 13, 1984, by TriStar Pictures. A fantasy sequence in the film introduced the Muppet Babies characters.

&quot;Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; was the first film to be directed solely by Oz, who previously co-directed &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; with Henson. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics with praise for its puppetry, humor, songs and characters but criticism for some of its writing. The film was a box office success, grossing $25.5 million on a budget of $8 million.

==Plot==
The Muppets perform their theatrical production of &quot;Manhattan Melodies&quot; for their graduating class at (fictional) Danhurst College, and encouraged by the audience&#x27;s enthusiastic response, decide to take the show to Broadway, certain they will become instant stars. Arriving in Manhattan, the group meet producer Martin Price, but are interrupted by the police, who have arrived to arrest him as a wanted con artist, whose real name is Murray Plotsky. The Muppets try other producers to no avail, depleting both their morale and their finances. Thinking they are becoming a burden to Kermit when he snaps at them, the rest of the Muppets agree to go their separate ways to find work, though Miss Piggy secretly remains in Manhattan to keep an eye on Kermit. Though disappointed by the development, Kermit vows to make the show a hit and enlists the assistance of diner owner Pete, his aspiring fashion designer daughter Jenny, and the diner&#x27;s staff of rats led by Rizzo.

Kermit&#x27;s attempts to promote the show fail, while he learns from letters received from his friends that Scooter manages a Cleveland, Ohio movie theater; Fozzie has joined some other bears hibernating in Maine but cannot sleep; Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem have a gig in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, performing in a retirement home; Gonzo and Camilla are trying to make a successful water skiing act in Michigan; and Rowlf is working at a dog kennel in Delaware. In Central Park, Jenny comforts Kermit about his setbacks, while an envious Piggy watches. While she is distracted, Piggy&#x27;s purse is stolen but she gives chase and, in the ensuing chaos, reunites with Kermit, and takes a job at Pete&#x27;s.

Kermit receives a letter from producer Bernard Crawford, who is interested in the musical. However, Kermit discovers the letter was actually written by his son Ronnie, who is eager to prove himself as a producer and believes that &quot;Manhattan Melodies&quot; is a worthwhile endeavor. His father reluctantly agrees to support him. Thrilled, Kermit heads back to the diner but is so distracted that he walks into oncoming traffic and is struck by a passing taxi.

Piggy summons the rest of the Muppets back to New York, and informs them that Kermit has disappeared. At the hospital, Kermit has lost his memory. He finds his way to Madison Avenue where he meets a trio of frogs, Bill, Gill and Jill, who work in advertising and offer him a job. The rest of the Muppets search in vain for Kermit, and on opening night reluctantly accept that the show will have to go on without him. Meanwhile, Bill, Gill, Jill and Kermit have ended up at Pete&#x27;s diner, and Kermit&#x27;s friends recognize him when he unknowingly taps out a tune from the show on glasses of water. At the Biltmore Theatre, Kermit still does not remember his friends, but when he ridicules the idea of being in love with Piggy, she karate chops him, curing his amnesia. As they hurriedly prepare for the opening number, the Muppets ask Kermit if their new friends can watch from backstage. Kermit, realizing the show needs more Muppets, suggests that the Madison Avenue frogs, the dogs, the bears, the chickens and others become supernumerary actors.

The show is a smash hit, culminating in what is intended to be a staged wedding between Kermit and Piggy&#x27;s characters, only for a real minister to appear in lieu of Gonzo. With all of the Muppets, including several from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; present, the show ends with their marriage.

==Production==
Under the working title of &quot;Muppet Movie III&quot;, Jim Henson initially planned to film in late spring 1983. Having directed &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; and &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; back-to-back, Henson decided to serve as executive producer while David Lazer served as producer. Upon selecting fellow Muppet performer and &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; co-director Frank Oz to handle directorial duties, Henson stated, &quot;I was looking at the year ahead and I thought my life was very busy and I thought maybe it was a time to have Frank directing one of these.&quot;

The first draft titled &quot;The Muppets: The Legend Continues&quot;, written by &quot;Muppet Caper&quot; screenwriters Jay Tarses and Tom Patchett, was dismissed by Oz for being &quot;way too over jokey&quot;. After being given Henson&#x27;s encouragement to tinker with the script, Oz revised the screenplay in an effort to develop the &quot;&quot;oomph&quot; of the characters and their relationships&quot;. Once the script was completed and the sets were built, special consultant David Misch was brought in to write cameos for some guest star appearances. Originally, this list of guest stars contained Dustin Hoffman, Steve Martin, Michael Jackson, Lily Tomlin, Richard Pryor and Laurence Olivier, to name a few. According to Misch, Hoffman was going to play a Broadway producer and planned to do an imitation of film producer Robert Evans (&quot;The Godfather&quot;), which he later did in the 1997 film &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;. However, at the last minute, Hoffman decided that the role could be offensive to Evans and dropped out, following which all the other big names left as well. Because of the dropped cameos, Misch and Oz ended up rewriting most of the dialogue.

==Music==
&quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan: The Original Soundtrack&quot; contains all of the songs written by Jeff Moss and prominent score cues composed by Ralph Burns from the film, as well as several portions of dialogue and background score. The album reached No. 204 on Billboard&#x27;s Bubbling Under the Top LPs chart and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording for Children, but lost to Shel Silverstein&#x27;s audio edition of &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot;.

This is the only Muppet film soundtrack that has not been released on CD. However, three tracks from the album can be found on the 2002 compilation album &quot;The Muppet Show: Music, Mayhem, and More&quot;. A new version of &quot;Together Again (Again)&quot; was performed in the 2014 film &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot; and its soundtrack.

Jeff Moss was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the music he composed for &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot;, but lost to &quot;Purple Rain&quot; by Prince.

==Release==
===Marketing===
&quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; was adapted by Marvel Comics in 1984, as the 68-page story in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; #32. The adaptation was later re-printed into a three-issue limited series, released under Marvel&#x27;s Star Comics imprint (November 1984 – January 1985). The film&#x27;s script was adapted into comic form by writer Stan Kay with art by Dean Yeagle and Jacqueline Roettcher. Unlike in the film, the comic depicts Gonzo, Floyd Pepper, Animal, Janice, Dr. Teeth, and Zoot in their outfits from &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

Additionally, a book-and-record set of the film was released in the form of a vinyl record through the Muppet Music Records label.

===Home media===
Unlike Henson&#x27;s previous films (&quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;, and &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;), &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; was originally released by TriStar Pictures and not produced by ITC Films, mainly because ITC was suffering from extreme financial difficulties at the time. Therefore, unlike the previous films, the distribution rights to &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; remained under control of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, who re-issued the film on home media in partnership with The Jim Henson Company in 1998 (as Sony distributed Henson Company-owned works on home video at the time as part the Henson-Sony partnership which formed Jim Henson Pictures) but did not revert to The Walt Disney Company in 2004. Because of this, it is one of three Muppet films (along with &quot;Muppets from Space&quot; and the direct-to-video feature &quot;Kermit&#x27;s Swamp Years&quot;) whose home video and television distribution rights are still controlled by Sony Pictures, and not the Walt Disney Studios.

&quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; was first released on VHS and the now defunct CED Videodisc format by CBS/Fox Video in 1985, which then reissued it in 1991, followed by a release from Columbia TriStar Home Video and Jim Henson Home Entertainment on June 1, 1999. The 1999 VHS contained a slightly edited cut from previous versions, possibly derived from the TV broadcast version. Cuts include removal of the audio from the TriStar logo, the scenes of Animal shouting &quot;Bad man!&quot; to Mr. Price, the sound of Kermit&#x27;s panting for breath immediately after leaving Leonard Winesop&#x27;s office, removal of the words &quot;Oh my God&quot; in one scene, and scenes with Miss Piggy hitting the purse snatcher.

A DVD version was released on June 5, 2001 with the cuts from the 1999 VHS version restored. A Blu-ray edition was released on August 16, 2011, and contains the same bonus features as the DVD. A 4K remaster of the film was released on October 24, 2023, on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, making it the first film that features the Muppets to receive a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release.

==Reception==
===Box office===
On its opening weekend, &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; grossed $4.4 million, ranking in fifth place at the box office. The film ultimately earned $25.5 million in the United States and Canada, placing it as the second highest-grossing G-rated film of 1984 (behind a re-issue of Walt Disney Productions&#x27; &quot;Pinocchio&quot;).

===Critical reaction===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 85% of 26 critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7/10. The site&#x27;s consensus stated that &quot;If it&#x27;s not quite as sharp as &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; is still a smart, delightfully old-fashioned tale that follows the formula established by the first two movies -- a madcap adventure assisted by a huge group of human stars.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 64 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; three stars (out of four), stating in his review that &quot;the plot of [the] movie has been seen before.&quot; However, Ebert went on to say that just about everything in the film was enjoyable and that Kermit finally solves his long-lasting identity crisis. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film stars (out of four) writing it was &quot;a most enjoyable backstage musical, culminating, as you probably have heard, with a wedding ceremony between you-know-who and you-know-who.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; positively stated: &quot;&quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; is a genuinely fun confection of old-fashioned entertainment that will appeal to both children and their parents, weaned on Henson&#x27;s syndicated tv series.&quot; Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, who expressed disappointment in &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot;, felt the Muppets &quot;have found their footing adroitly now; the emphasis is back on real values and identifiable emotions.&quot; In his annual &quot;Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin gave the film a three star rating (out of four) as well citing that the film is an &quot;enjoyable outing with bouncy songs, [with a] nice use of N.Y.C. locations.&quot;

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the film as being &quot;progressively lackluster&quot;, finding the Muppets&#x27; disbandment to be a &quot;misbegotten juncture that the script proceeds to unravel, losing a unified storytelling thread while keeping tabs on the scattered troupe until the inevitable reunion.&quot; He further felt the film lacked &quot;rousing musical numbers&quot;, in which he blamed Henson and Oz for pinning &quot;everything on a poorly calculated and staged marital spectacular, as Miss Piggy finally cons Kermit to the altar -- a terminally sappy bad idea to begin with.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;This may be only an impression, based on the fact that the past always looks greener than the present, but &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; seems just a little less extraordinaire than the two other features.&quot; Kathleen Carroll of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave the film a 2½ star rating out of four, remarking that &quot;despite the contribution of such well known actors as Mayor Koch, &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; is strangely flat. It&#x27;s no wonder that the Muppets&#x27; severest critics, the grumpy Waldorf and Statler, are less than pleased with this mushy movie. Watching Miss Piggy and &quot;Kermie&quot; cuddle together in a hansom cab, Waldorf grimly notes, &#x27;They&#x27;re in love.&#x27; Growls Statler: &#x27;Kind of makes you sick, doesn&#x27;t it?&#x27;.&quot; Rob Salem of &quot;The Toronto Star&quot;, remarked that &quot;the Muppet charm has been as stretched as far is it can go. Now that the pig and the frog are blissfully wedded, it&#x27;s time to lay them to rest. Better that Jim Henson and associates continue to branch out, as they did with &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, into new and very different stories and characters. Otherwise, in &quot;Muppet Movie IV&quot;, they&#x27;ll be forced to deal with the reality of married life between a pretend pig and a phony frog. And that could get a little tricky.&quot;

==Abandoned follow-up series==
On February 7, 2019, it was announced that &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; showrunners Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz were working with actor Josh Gad on a TV series titled &quot;Muppets Live Another Day&quot;, set after the film&#x27;s events, for Disney+. The series was to focus on the Muppets, who disbanded some time after the film&#x27;s events, reuniting after Rowlf disappears. However, on September 9, 2019, it was announced that the series had been scrapped due to creative differences following an executive change at The Muppets Studio.

<text>The Humanist International (also known as the International Humanist Party) is a consortium of political parties adhering to universal humanism founded in 1952.

The five basic principles of Humanist International are:

# The value of human life as the central value, above money and power, etc.
# Equality of all human beings.
# Freedom of belief and ideas.
# Development and creation of alternative economic models to the current neoliberal one.
# Methodology of active non-violence.

== History ==
Humanist International was founded in Florence, Italy, on January 4, 1989, by the approval of foundational documents and statutes by over 40 Humanist Parties from around the world. These foundational documents included the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a declaration of principles, a thesis and a basis for political action.

The second congress of the Humanist International was held in Moscow in October 1993. In this meeting, the document of the Humanist Movement was added to the foundational documents.

In January and July 1999, the Humanist International launched the regional bodies of Latin America and Europe respectively. Africa and Asia are in the process of forming their own regional bodies.

In December 1989, in Chile, Laura Rodríguez became the first elected representative of any Humanist Party in the world after winning a seat as part of the &quot;Concertación&quot; coalition, after Augusto Pinochet handed over power.

The Argentine Humanist Party won a seat in the Deliberative Council in Santa Rosa, La Pampa in 2015.

The Chilean Humanist Party was a part of the Broad Front coalition for the 2017 parliamentary elections. The coalition won 20 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, three of which went to the Humanist Party.

<text>Ahmed Şefik Midhat Pasha (; 1822 – 26 April 1883) was an Ottoman politician, reformist, and statesman. He was the author of the Constitution of the Ottoman Empire.

Midhat was born in Istanbul and educated from a private . In July 1872, he was appointed grand vizier by Abdulaziz (), though was removed in August. During the First Constitutional Era, in 1876, he co-founded the Ottoman Parliament. Midhat was noted as a kingmaker and leading Ottoman democrat. He was part of a governing elite which recognized the crisis the Empire was in and considered reform to be a dire need. Midhat was reportedly killed in al-Ta&#x27;if.

== Life ==
=== Early life and family ===
Ahmed Shefik Midhat Pasha was born in Istanbul in the Islamic month of Safar in 1238 AH, which began on 18 October 1822. His family consisted of well-established Muslim scholars. His father, Rusçuklu Mehmed Eşref, was a native of Ruse. The family seem to have been professed Bektashis. Born into an Ilmiye family, he received a private and medrese education.

He spent his youth in his parents&#x27; home in Vidin, Lovech and later Istanbul, where his father held judicial office.

=== Early political career ===
In 1836 he worked in the secretariat of the grand vizier, and in 1854 the Grand Vizier Kıbrıslı Mehmed Emin Pasha gave him the task of pacifying the province of Adrianople, and he succeeded in putting down banditry in the Balkans in 1854–1856. In 1858 he spent six months traveling in western Europe for studies, including in Vienna, Paris, Brussels and London. While he was second secretary of the Supreme Council of Judicial Ordinances, he took part in the investigation of the Kuleli Incident.

=== Governorships ===
==== Niš and Danube governorship ====

In 1861 he was appointed governor of Niš, where he was instrumental in introducing the vilayet system in the Balkans. Fuad Pasha, in order to implement the 1864 Vilayet Law, began with a pilot program in the form of the model and experimental vilayet of the Danube, in which Midhat Pasha was appointed its first Vali. He was governor of the Danube Province from 1864 to 1868. He played a major role in the accommodation of Muslim refugees from Serbia, who were expelled by the government in 1862. During his governorship, he built countless schools and educational institutes, built hospitals, granaries, roads and bridges, paying for these projects through voluntary contributions from the people. Within two years Midhat Pasha restored order, introduced the new reformed hierarchy, provided agricultural credits (through the first agricultural credit co-operatives), extended roads, bridges, and waterways, started industries, opened schools and orphanages, founded a newspaper, and increased the revenues of the province from 26,000 to 300,000 purses. He clashed with the Grand Vizier Mehmed Emin Ali Pasha, which led to his appointment as governor of Baghdad in 1869, as the appointment to such a remote posting was intended as a punishment.

==== Baghdad governorship ====

After his arrival in Baghdad in 1869, he opened a series of government schools, as the city previously had no state educational institutions. He also emphasized reforming the Sixth Army, and to that end he opened military schools. The military schools were to have the more lasting impact: by 1900, the civil preparatory high school was attended by only 96 students, compared to 256 for the military preparatory school, and 846 for the military middle school in the same year.

He helped modernize the province, and he re-established Ottoman rule in al-Hasa. He enacted the vilayet system in Baghdad, and applied the 1858 land decree under which miri land could be granted to individuals, under a system known as nizam tapu. Sir Henry Dobbs recognised the three years of Midhat Pasha&#x27;s governorship as the most stable and secure period of Ottoman rule in the region. He left the post in 1872, returning to Istanbul.

=== Grand Viziership ===

In 1872, he was appointed grand vizier by Abdulaziz (). His first tenure came to an abrupt end, mainly due to his clashes with Abdulaziz over financial and economic issues. He was dismissed after two months. He also served as Minister of Justice in 1873 and 1875, but his tenure in these offices was short-lived, owing to his inclination towards a constitutional regime.

The emerging internal, financial and diplomatic crises of 1875–1876 provided him with a chance to introduce the constitution of 1876.

On 15 June 1876, an Ottoman infantry officer named Çerkes Hasan assaulted a meeting in the mansion of Midhat Pasha, where all the chief ministers were present. The Minister of War Huseyin Avni Pasha was shot, and the Foreign Minister Rashid Pasha was killed, as was one of Midhat&#x27;s servants, named Ahmed Aga. In total, 5 were killed and 10 were wounded, and Hasan was sentenced to death for the crime, in an incident known as the Çerkes Hasan incident.

Midhat Pasha was again appointed Grand Vizier, in place of Mehmed Rushdi Pasha, on 19 December 1876. When he was appointed, he promised to continue on the path of reform, and announced on 23 December 1876 that a constitution would be promulgated and a representative parliament established. Though not a member of the commission that drafted the constitution, he played an important part in its adoption. The constitution provided for equal rights for all citizens without distinction of race or creed, abolition of slavery, an independent judiciary based on civil (rather than religious) law, universal elementary education, and a bicameral parliament, with a Senate appointed by the Sultan and a directly elected Chamber of Deputies. Midhat Pasha asserted in the &quot;Nineteenth Century&quot; that &quot;in Islam the principle of government rests upon bases essentially democratic, inasmuch as the sovereignty of the people is therein recognized.&quot;

Popular support for the constitution began to plummet when it became known that it was to grant equal rights for non-Muslims. The , which had been Midhat&#x27;s supporters just months earlier, became largely opposed. Midhat Pasha managed to pressure Abdul Hamid II into approving the constitution, but the Sultan was able to include the notorious article 113, which gave him the power to banish anyone from the empire without trial or other legal procedure.

Abdul Hamid had no real interest in constitutionalism, and on 5 February 1877, he exiled Midhat Pasha. Sent to Brindisi on the imperial yacht, from there he visited France, Spain, Austria-Hungary and the United Kingdom, where he wrote memoranda supporting the Ottoman cause in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, and a pamphlet defending Ottoman reforms. Midhat&#x27;s popularity in Europe, coupled with British pressure, led Abdul Hamid to allow him to return from exile, and he arrived in Crete on 6 September 1878.

After the war ended, Sultan Abdul Hamid II dismissed the government and returned to despotic rule.

=== Governorship of Syria ===
The intervention of the British led to his appointing as governor again, and he became governor of the Vilayet of Syria in November 1878, a post he held until 31 August 1881. During his tenure he endeavoured to reform the province. He used a charitable association for education, which had been formed by some of Beirut&#x27;s prominent Muslim citizens, into a centrepiece of his educational reform, and encouraged the formation of similar associations in Damascus and elsewhere.

He admitted many Arabs in the civil service, including in the positions of qaimaqam and mutasarrif, and gave minorities broad representation in the administration. He encouraged the development of the press, and the number of newspapers rose to more than twelve. He took an interest in the construction of roads, and in the maintenance of security. He involved local notables in the financing of local projects, such as the tramway system in Tripoli and the founding of the Beirut Chamber of Commerce. He then resigned the post, as he felt Istanbul was offering him an insufficient amount of support. His reputation in Europe was that his reforming zeal was an aberration, based on individual strength of personality. They believed Midhat Pasha could not succeed, citing the inefficient and corrupt nature of the Ottoman state, and the fractured nature of its society.

=== Imprisonment and death ===
He served briefly in İzmir as governor of the vilayet of Aydin, but on 17 May 1881, after only a few months on that post, he was arrested. Ahmed Cevdet Pasha, the justice minister, brought him to Istanbul, where he was charged with the murder of Sultan Abdulaziz. The interrogation and court proceedings took place at Yildiz. In conclusion, he was convicted and charged with the murder, and was sentenced to death. However the execution was commuted to life imprisonment in Taif in Hejaz.

Some historians claim that these to be trumped-up accusations as they believe that confessions were extracted from some suspects through the use of torture, and the use of forged evidence and paid witnesses led to his conviction. However, they claim that the British pressure impeded his execution, so he was imprisoned in the fortress of Taif, in Hejaz. It was reported that, soon after his arrival, the Emir of Mecca received a message from Istanbul demanding the death of Midhat from &quot;an accident&quot;. The incumbent Emir Abdul Muttalib was a close friend of Midhat however, and no action was taken by him. As a result, Osman Pasha (&quot;Uthman Pasha&quot;), governor of Hejaz, surrounded the Emir&#x27;s summer residence in Taif and imprisoned him. After that, Midhat Pasha&#x27;s fate was sealed. He was assassinated in his cell on 26 April 1883.

Midhat Pasha&#x27;s remains were brought from Taif and interned in the Monument of Liberty on 26 June 1951, in a ceremony attended by President Celâl Bayar.

== Legacy ==

The British historian Caroline Finkel describes Midhat as &quot;a true representative of Tanzimat optimism, who believed that separatist tendencies could be best countered by demonstrating the benefits of good government.&quot; The Midhat Pasha Souq in Damascus still bears his name. Bernard Lewis describes Midhat Pasha &quot;one of the ablest administrators in the Ottoman service.&quot; Going on to state &quot;[his] term of office as Vali of the Danube province showed that, given the necessary goodwill and ability, the new system could work very well.&quot; Midhat Pasha is described as a person with a liberal attitude.

<text>Missile defense is a system, weapon, or technology involved in the detection, tracking, interception, and also the destruction of attacking missiles. Conceived as a defense against nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), its application has broadened to include shorter-ranged non-nuclear tactical and theater missiles.

China, France, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Russia, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States have all developed such air defense systems.

==Missile defense categories==
Missile defense can be divided into categories based on various characteristics: type/range of missile intercepted, the trajectory phase where the intercept occurs, and whether intercepted inside or outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere:

===Type/range of missile intercepted===
These types/ranges include strategic, theater and tactical. Each entails unique requirements for intercept; a defensive system capable of intercepting one missile type frequently cannot intercept others. However, there is sometimes overlap in capability.

====Strategic====
Targets long-range ICBMs, which travel at about 7 km/s (15,700 mph). Examples of currently active systems: Russian A-135, which defends Moscow, the US Ground-Based Midcourse Defense that defends the United States from missiles launched from Asia and the Israeli Arrow 3 which defends Israel from ICBMs. Geographic range of strategic defense can be regional (Russian system) or national (US and Israeli system&#x27;s).

====Theater====
Targets medium-range missiles, which travel at about 3 km/s (6,700 mph) or less. In this context, the term &quot;theater&quot; means the entire localized region for military operations, typically a radius of several hundred kilometers; defense range of these systems is usually on this order. Examples of deployed theater missile defenses: Israeli Arrow 2 missile and David&#x27;s Sling, American THAAD, and Russian S-400.

====Tactical====
Targets short-range tactical ballistic missiles, which usually travel at less than 1.5 km/s (3,400 mph). Tactical anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs) have short ranges, typically 20–80 km (12–50 miles). Examples of currently-deployed tactical ABMs are the Israeli Iron Dome, American MIM-104 Patriot and Russian S-300V.

===Trajectory phase===

Ballistic missiles can be intercepted in three regions of their trajectory: boost phase, midcourse phase, or terminal phase.

====Boost phase====
Intercepting the missile while its rocket motors are firing, usually over the launch territory.

Advantages:
*Bright, hot rocket exhaust makes detection and targeting easier.
*Decoys cannot be used during boost phase.
*At this stage, the missile is full of flammable propellant, which makes it very vulnerable to explosive warheads.

Disadvantages:
*Difficult to geographically position interceptors to intercept missiles in boost phase (not always possible without flying over hostile territory).
*Short time for intercept (typically about 180 seconds).

====Mid-course phase====
Intercepting the missile in space after the rocket burns out (example: American Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Chinese SC-19 &amp; DN-series missiles, Israeli Arrow 3 missile).

Advantages:
*Extended decision/intercept time (the coast period through space before reentering the atmosphere can be several minutes, up to 20 minutes for an ICBM).
*Very large geographic defensive coverage; potentially continental.

Disadvantages:
*Requires large, heavy anti-ballistic missiles and sophisticated powerful radar which must often be augmented by space-based sensors.
*Must handle potential space-based decoys.

====Terminal phase====
Intercepting the missile after it reenters the atmosphere (examples: American Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, Chinese HQ-19, American THAAD, American Sprint, Russian ABM-3 Gazelle)

Advantages:
*Smaller, lighter anti-ballistic missile is sufficient.
*Balloon decoys do not work during reentry.
*Smaller, less sophisticated radar required.

Disadvantages:
*Very short intercept time, possibly less than 30 seconds.
*Less defended geographic coverage.
*Possible blanketing of target area with hazardous materials in the case of detonation of nuclear warhead(s).

===Intercept location relative to the atmosphere===
Missile defense can take place either inside (endoatmospheric) or outside (exoatmospheric) the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The trajectory of most ballistic missiles takes them inside and outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and they can be intercepted in either place. There are advantages and disadvantages to either intercept technique.

Some missiles such as THAAD can intercept both inside and outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, giving two intercept opportunities.

====Endoatmospheric====
Endoatmospheric anti-ballistic missiles are usually shorter ranged (e.g., American MIM-104 Patriot, Indian Advanced Air Defence).

Advantages:
*Physically smaller and lighter
*Easier to move and deploy
*Endoatmospheric intercept means balloon-type decoys won&#x27;t work

Disadvantages:
*Limited range and defended area
*Limited decision and tracking time for the incoming warhead

====Exoatmospheric====
Exoatmospheric anti-ballistic missiles are usually longer-ranged (e.g., American GMD, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense).

Advantages:
*More decision and tracking time
*Fewer missiles required for defense of a larger area
*May be able to destroy multiple weapon/decoy equipped targets before staging

Disadvantages:
*Larger and heavier missiles required
*More difficult to transport and place compared to smaller missiles
*May need to handle decoys

== Countermeasures to missile defense ==

Given the immense variety by which a defense system can operate (targeting nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), tactical, and theater missiles), there are some unarguably effective exoatmospheric (outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere) countermeasures an attacking party can use to deter or completely defend against certain types of defense systems, ranges of ACBM&#x27;s, and intercept locations. Many of defenses to these countermeasures have been implemented and taken into account when constructing missile defense systems, however, it does not guarantee their effectiveness or success. The US Missile Defense Agency has received scrutiny in regards to their lack of foresight of these countermeasures, causing many scientists to perform various studies and data analysis as to the true effectiveness of these countermeasures.

=== Decoys ===
A common countermeasure that attacking parties use to disrupt the efficacy of Missile Defense Systems are the simultaneous launching of decoys from the primary launch site or from the exterior of the main attacking missile itself. These decoys are usually small, lightweight dud rockets that take advantage of the interceptor sensors tracking and fool it by making many different targets available in an instant. This is accomplished via the releasing of decoys in certain phases of flight. Because objects of differing weights follow the same trajectory when in space, decoys released during the midcourse phase can prevent interceptor missiles from accurately identifying the warhead. This could force the defense system to attempt to destroy all incoming projectiles, which masks the true attacking missile and lets it slip by the defense system.

==== Common types of decoys ====
Since there can be many forms of this type of deception of a missile system, different categorizations of decoys have developed, all of which operate and are designed slightly different. Details of these types of decoys and their effectiveness were provided in a report by a variety of prominent scientists in 2000.

===== Replica decoys =====
This categorization of decoy is the most similar to the standard understanding of what a missile decoy is. These types of decoys attempt to mask the attacking ICBM via the release of many similar missiles. This type of decoy confuses the missile defense system by the sudden replication and the sheer amount that the defense has to deal with. Knowing that no defense system is 100% reliable, this confusion within the targeting of the defense system would cause the system to target each decoy with equal priority and as if it was the actual warhead, allowing the real warheads chance of passing through the system and striking the target to increase drastically.

===== Decoys using signature diversity =====
Similar to replica decoys, these types of decoys also take advantage of the limitations in number within the missile defense systems targeting. However, rather than using missiles of similar build and trace to the attacking warhead, these types of decoys all have slightly different appearances from both each other and the warhead itself. This creates a different kind of confusion within the system; rather than creating a situation where each decoy (and the warhead itself) appears the same and is therefore targeted and treated exactly like the &quot;real&quot; warhead, the targeting system simply does not know what is the real threat and what is a decoy due to the mass amount of differing information. This creates a similar situation as the result of the replica decoy, increasing the chance that the real warhead passes through the system and strikes the target.

===== Decoys using antisimulation =====
This type of decoy is perhaps the most difficult and subversive for a missile defense system to determine. Instead of taking advantage of the missile defense system&#x27;s targeting, this type of decoy intends to fool the operation of the system itself. Rather than using sheer quantity to overrun the targeting system, an anti-simulation decoy disguises the actual warhead as a decoy, and a decoy as the actual warhead. This system of &quot;anti-simulation&quot; allows the attacking warhead to, in some cases, take advantage of the &quot;bulk-filtering&quot; of certain missile defense systems, in which objects with characteristics of the warhead poorly matching those expected by the defense are either not observed because of sensor filters, or observed very briefly and immediately rejected without the need for a detailed examination. The actual warhead may simply pass by undetected, or rejected as a threat.

=== Cooled shrouds ===
Another common countermeasure used to fool missile defense systems are the implementation of cooled shrouds surrounding attacking missiles. This method covers the entire missile in a steel containment filled with liquid oxygen, nitrogen, or other coolants that prevent the missile from being easily detected. Because many missile defense systems use infrared sensors to detect the heat traces of incoming missiles, this capsule of extremely cold liquid either renders the incoming missile entirely invisible to detection or reduces the system&#x27;s ability to detect the incoming missile fast enough.

=== Other types of infrared stealth ===

Another commonly applied countermeasure to missile defense is the application of various low-emissivity coatings. Similar to cooled shrouds, these warheads are fully coated with infrared reflective or resistant coatings that allow similar resistance to infrared detection that cooled shrouds do. Because the most effective coating discovered so far is gold, though, this method is often overstepped by cooled shrouds.

=== Biological and chemical weapons ===
This is perhaps the most extreme approach to countering missile defense systems that are designed to destroy ICBMs and other forms of nuclear weaponry. Rather than using many missiles equipped with nuclear warheads as their main weapon of attack, this idea involves the release of biological or chemical sub-munition weapons or agents from the missile shortly after the boost phase of the attacking ICBM. Because missile defense systems are designed with intent to destroy main attacking missiles or ICBMs, this system of sub-munition attack is too numerous for the system to defend against while also distributing the chemical or biological agent across a large area of attack.
There is currently no proposed countermeasure to this type of attack except through diplomacy and the effective banning of biological weaponry and chemical agents within war. However, this does not guarantee that this countermeasure to missile defense system will not be abused via extremists or terrorists. An example of this severe threat can be further seen in North Korea&#x27;s testing of anthrax tipped ICBMs in 2017.

=== Dynamic trajectories ===
Countries including Iran and North Korea may have sought missiles that can maneuver and vary their trajectories in order to evade missile defense systems.

In March 2022, when Russia used a hypersonic missile against Ukraine, Joe Biden characterized the weapon as &quot;almost impossible to stop&quot;. Boost-glide hypersonic weapons shift trajectory to evade current missile-defense systems.

Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) will provide defense against maneuvering hypersonic weapons.

==== Multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles ====
Another way to counter an ABM system is to attach multiple warheads that break apart upon reentry. If the ABM is able to counter one or two of the warheads via detonation or collision the others would slip through radar either because of limitations on ABM firing speeds or because of radar blackout caused by plasma interference. The first MRV was the Polaris A-3 which had three warheads and was launched from a submarine. Before regulations on how many warheads could be stored in a MIRV, the Soviets had up to twenty to thirty attached to ICBMs.

=== Jammers ===
Jammers use radar noise to saturate the incoming signals to the point where the radar cannot discern meaningful data about a target&#x27;s location with meaningless noise. They can also imitate the signal of a missile to create a fake target.  They are usually spread over planned missile paths to enemy territory to give the missile a clear path to their target. Because these jammers take relatively little electricity and hardware to operate, they are usually small, self-contained, and easily dispersible.

== Command and control ==

=== Command and control, battle management, and communications (C2BMC) ===
Command and control, battle management, and communications (C2BMC) systems are hardware and software interfaces that integrate a multitude of sensory information at a centralized center for the ballistic missile defense system (BMDS). The command center allows for human management in accordance to the incorporated sensory information- BMDS status, system coverage, and ballistic missile attacks. The interface system helps build an image of the battle scenario or situation which enables the user to select the optimal firing solutions.
The first C2BMC system became operational in 2004. Since then, many elements have been added to update the C2BMC, which act to provide further sensory information and allow for enhanced communications between combatant commanders. A C2BMC is even capable of initiating live planning system before any engagement has even started.

=== GMD fire control and communication ===
The function of ground-based midcourse defense (GMD) systems is to provide combatants the ability to seek and destroy intermediate- and long-range ballistic missiles en route to the US homeland. Data are transmitted from the defense satellite communication system, and compiles an image using the coordinated information. The system is able to relay real-time data once missiles have been launched. The GMD can also work to receive information from the C2BMC, which allows Aegis SPY-1, and TPY-2 to contribute to the defense system.

A problem with GMD is that the ground systems have increasingly becoming obsolete as the technology was initially installed as early as the 1990s. So, the ground sensors had been replaced sometime in 2018. The update was to add the capability of handling up to 44 systems; it would also reduce overlapping redundancies and inefficiencies.

Missiles are a link that connects communication between land, air, and sea forces to support joint operations and improve operability. The system is intended to improve the interoperability for joint operations of NATO and coalition forces. Link-16 is also used by the US Army and Navy for air and sea operations. An important feature of Link-16 is its ability to broadcast information simultaneously to as many users as needed. Another feature of Link-16 is its ability to act as nodes, which allows for a multitude of distributed forces to operate cohesively.

The newest generation of Link-16 is the multifunctional information distribution system low-volume terminal (MIDS LVT). It is a much smaller unit that can be fitted on air, ground, and sea units to incorporate data. The MIDS LVT terminals are installed on most bombers, aircraft, UAVs, and tankers, allowing for the incorporation of most air defense systems.

=== Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System ===

The Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) is an unified command and control network developed by the US Army. It is designed to integrate data relay between weapon launchers, radars, and the operators, which allows air-defense units to fire interceptors with information being relayed among radars. The advantage of such a system is it can increase the area an air unit can defend and reduce interceptor spending by ensuring than no other air defense unit would engage the same target. The IBCS will be able to integrate with air defense networks of foreign military as the global C2BMC system.
IBCS engagement stations will integrate raw data from multiple sensors and process it into a single air picture, and choose elect different weapons and launcher locations depending on the detected threat instead of being limited to particular unit capabilities.

The IBCS system is intended to be operational in 2019; between 2016 and 2017, implementation of IBCS had to be put on hold due to software issues with the system. In 2021, F-35 sensor data were linked via airborne gateway to ground-based IBCS, to conduct a simulated Army fires exercise, for future Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2).

==History==
The problem was first studied during the last year of the Second World War. The only countermeasure against the V-2 missile that could be devised was a massive barrage of anti-aircraft guns. Even if the missile&#x27;s trajectory were accurately calculated, the guns would still have a small probability of destroying it before impact with the ground. Also, the shells fired by the guns would have caused more damage than the actual missile when they fell back to the ground. Plans for an operational test began anyway, but the idea was rendered moot when the V-2 launching sites in the Netherlands were captured.

In the 1950s and 1960s, missile defense meant defense against strategic (usually nuclear-armed) missiles. The technology mostly centered around detecting offensive launch events and tracking inbound ballistic missiles, but with limited ability to actually defend against the missile. The Soviet Union achieved the first nonnuclear intercept of a ballistic missile warhead by a missile at the Sary Shagan antiballistic missile defense test range on 4 March 1961. Nicknamed the &quot;Griffon&quot; missile system, it would be installed around Leningrad as a test

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the United States Project Nike air defense program focused initially on targeting hostile bombers before shifting focus to targeting ballistic missiles. In the 1950s, the first United States anti-ballistic missile system was the Nike Hercules, which had the ability to intercept incoming short-range ballistic missiles, but not intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) or ICBMs. This was followed by the Nike Zeus, which was capable of intercepting ICBMs by using a nuclear warhead, upgraded radar systems, faster computers, and control systems that were more effective in the upper atmosphere. However it was feared the missile&#x27;s electronics may be vulnerable to x-rays from a nuclear detonation in space. A program was started to devise methods of hardening weapons from radiation damage. By the early 1960s the Nike Zeus was the first anti-ballistic missile to achieve hit-to-kill (physically colliding with the incoming warhead).

In 1963, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara diverted funds from the Zeus missile program, and instead directed that funding to the development of the Nike-X system, which used the high-speed, short-range Sprint missile. These missiles were meant to intercept incoming warheads after they had descended from space and were only seconds from their targets. To accomplish this, Nike-X required advances in missile design to make the Sprint missile quick enough to intercept incoming warheads in time. The system also included advanced active electronically scanned array radar systems and a powerful computer complex.

During the development of Nike-X, controversy over the effectiveness of anti-ballistic missile systems became more prominent. Critiques of the Nike-X included an estimate that the anti-ballistic missile system could be defeated by Soviets manufacturing more ICBMs, and the cost of those additional ICBMs needed to defeat Nike-X would also cost less than what the United States would spend on implementing Nike-X. Additionally, McNamara reported that a ballistic missile system would save American lives at the cost of approximately $700 per life, compared to a shelter system that could save lives at a lower cost of approximately $40 per life. As a result of these estimations, McNamara opposed implementation of Nike-X due to the high costs associated with construction and perceived poor cost-effectiveness of the system, and instead expressed support for pursuing arms limitations agreements with the Soviets. After the Chinese government detonated their first hydrogen bomb during Test No. 6. in 1967, McNamara modified the Nike-X program into a program called Sentinel. This program&#x27;s goal was to protect major US cities from a limited ICBM attack, especially on one from China.
This would be done by building fifteen sites across the continental US, and one site in each of Alaska and Hawaii. This in turn reduced tensions with the Soviet Union, which retained the offensive capability to overwhelm any US defense. McNamara favored this approach as deploying the Sentinel program was less costly than a fully implemented Nike-X program, and would reduce congressional pressures to implement an ABM system. In the months following the announcements regarding the Sentinel program, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated: &quot;Let me emphasize—and I cannot do so too strongly—that our decision to go ahead with a limited ABM deployment in no way indicates that we feel an agreement with the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic nuclear offensive and defensive forces is in any way less urgent or desirable.

With the conclusion of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the withdrawal of Soviet missiles from their strategic positions in Cuba, the USSR started to think about a missile defense systems. A year after the crisis in 1963 the Soviets created the SA-5. Unlike its predecessors like the SA-1 or Griffon systems, this system was able to fly much higher and further  and was fast enough to intercept some missiles however its main purpose was to intercept the new XB-70 supersonic aircraft the US was planning to make. However, since these types of aircraft never went into production in the US, the project was abandoned, and the Soviets reverted to the slower, low altitude SA-2 and SA-3 systems. In 1964 the Soviets publicly unveiled their newest interceptor missile named the &quot;Galosh&quot; which was nuclear armed and was meant for high altitude, long range interception. The Soviet Union began installing the A-35 anti-ballistic missile system around Moscow in 1965 using these &quot;Galosh&quot; missiles and would become operational by 1971. It consisted of four complex around Moscow each with 16 launchers and two missile tracking radars. Another notable feature of the A-35 was that it was the first monopulse radar. Developed by OKB 30, the Russian Special Design Bureau, the effort design to create a monopulse radar started in 1954. This was used to conduct the first successful intercept in 1961. There were known flaws with the design such as an inability to defend against MIRV and decoy style weapons.The reason for this was because the detonation of a nuclear interceptor missile like the &quot;Galosh&quot; creates a cloud of plasma that temporarily impairs radar readings around the area of the explosion limiting these kinds of systems to a one-shot capacity. This means that with MIRV style attacks the interceptor would be able to take out one or two but the rest would slip though. Another issue with the 1965 model was that it consisted of 11 large radar stations at six locations on the borders of Russia. These bases where visible to the US and could be taken out easily leaving the defense system useless in a concentrated and coordinated attack. Finally, the missiles that could be held on each base was limited by the ABM treaty to only 100 launchers maximum, meaning that in a massive attack they would be depleted quickly. During installation, a Ministry of Defense commission concluded that the system should not be fully implemented, reducing the capabilities of the completed system. That system was later upgraded to the A-135 anti-ballistic missile system and is still operational. This upgrade period started in 1975 and was headed by Dr. A.G. Basistov. When it was completed in 1990, the new A-135 system had a central control multifunctional radar called the &quot;Don&quot; and 100 interceptor missiles. Another improvement was the layering of interceptor missiles where high acceleration missiles are being added for low flying targets and the &quot;Galosh&quot; style missiles where improved further for high altitude targets. All of these missiles where moved underground into silos to make them less vulnerable, which was a flaw of the previous system.
The SALT I talks began in 1969, and led to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972, which ultimately limited the US and USSR to one defensive missile site each, with no more than 100 missiles per site. This included both ABM interceptor missiles as well as launchers. Originally, the agreement made by the Nixon administration and the Soviet Union stated that both of the two nations were each allowed to have two ABM defensive systems present in their own countries. The goal was to effectively have one ABM defense system located near each nation&#x27;s capital city as well as another ABM defense system placed near the nation&#x27;s most important or strategical ICBM field. This treaty allowed for an effective form of deterrence for both sides as if either side were to make an offensive move, the other side would be capable of countering that move. However, a few years later in 1974 both sides reworked the treaty to include only one ABM defensive system present around an ICBM launch area or the nation&#x27;s capital city. This occurred once both sides determined the other side was not going to construct a second ABM defensive system. Along with limiting the amount of ballistic missile defense systems each nation could have, the treaty also stated if either country desired to have a radar for incoming missile detection, the radar system must be located on the outskirts of the territory and must be aligned in the opposite direction of one&#x27;s own country. This treaty would end up being the precedent set for future missile defense programs, as any systems that were not stationary and land-based were a violation of the treaty.

As a result of the treaty and of technical limitations, along with public opposition to nearby nuclear-armed defensive missiles, the US Sentinel program was re-designated the Safeguard Program, with the new goal of defending US ICBM sites, not cities. The US Safeguard system was planned to be implemented in various sites across the US, including at Whiteman AFB in Missouri, Malmstrom AFB in Montana, and Grand Forks AFB in North Dakota. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 placed a limit of two ABM systems within the US, causing the work site in Missouri to be abandoned, and the partially-completed Montana site was abandoned in 1974 after an additional agreement between the US and USSR that limited each country to one ABM system. As a result, the only Safeguard system that was deployed was to defend the LGM-30 Minuteman ICBMs near Grand Forks, North Dakota. However, it was deactivated in 1976 after being operational for less than four months due to a changing political climate plus concern over limited effectiveness, low strategic value, and high operational cost.

In the early 1980s, technology had matured to consider space based missile defense options. Precision hit-to-kill systems more reliable than the early Nike Zeus were thought possible. With these improvements, the Reagan administration promoted the Strategic Defense Initiative, an ambitious plan to provide a comprehensive defense against an all-out ICBM attack. In pursuit of that goal, the Strategic Defense Initiative investigated a variety of potential missile-defense systems, which included systems using ground-based missile systems and space-based missile systems, as well as systems using lasers or particle beam weapons. This program faced controversy over the feasibility of the projects it pursued, as well as the substantial amount of funding and time required for the research to develop the requisite technology. The Strategic Defense Initiative earned the nickname &quot;Star Wars&quot; due to criticism from Senator Ted Kennedy in which he described the Strategic Defense Initiative as &quot;reckless Star Wars schemes.&quot;. Reagan established the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) to oversee the development of the program&#x27;s projects. Upon request by the SDIO, the American Physical Society (APS) performed a review of the concepts being developed within SDIO and concluded that all of the concepts pursuing use of Directed Energy Weapons were not feasible solutions for an anti-missile defense system without decades of additional research and development. Following the APS&#x27;s report in 1986, the SDIO switched focus to a concept called the Strategic Defense System, which would use a system of space-based missiles called Space Rocks which would intercept incoming ballistic missiles from orbit, and would be supplemented by ground-based missile defense systems. In 1993, the SDIO was closed and the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) was created, which focuses on ground-based missile defense systems using interceptor missiles. In 2002, BMDO&#x27;s name was changed to its current title, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). See National Missile Defense for additional details. In the early 1990s, missile defense expanded to include tactical missile defense, as seen in the first Gulf War. Although not designed from the outset to intercept tactical missiles, upgrades gave the Patriot system a limited missile defense capability. The effectiveness of the Patriot system in disabling or destroying incoming Scuds was the subject of congressional hearings and reports in 1992.

In the time following the agreement of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, it was becoming increasingly more and more difficult for the United States to create a new missile defense strategy without violating the terms of the treaty. During the Clinton administration, the initial goal the United States had interest in, was to negotiate with the former Soviet Union, which is now Russia, and hopefully agree to a revision to the treaty signed a few decades prior. In the late 1990s the United States had interest in an idea termed NMD or National Missile Defense. This idea essentially would allow the United States to increase the number of ballistic missile interceptors that would be available to missile defense personnel at the Alaska location. While the initial ABM treaty was designed primarily to deter the Soviet Union and help create a period of détente, the United States was primarily fearing other threats such as Iraq, North Korea, and Iran. The Russian government was not interested in making any sort of modification to the ABM treaty that would allow for technology to be developed that was explicitly banned when the treaty was agreed upon. However, Russia was interested in revising the treaty in such a way that would allow for a more diplomatic approach to potential missile harboring countries. During this period, the United States was also seeking assistance for their ballistic missile defense systems from Japan. Following the testing of the Taepo Dong missile by the North Korean government, the Japanese government became more concerned and inclined to accept a partnership for a BMD system with the United States. In late 1998, Japan and the United States agreed to the Naval Wide Theater system which would allow the two sides to design, construct, and test ballistic missile defense systems together. Nearing the end of Clinton&#x27;s time in office, it had been determined that the NMD program was not as effective as the United States would have liked, and the decision was made to not employ this system while Clinton served out the rest of his term. The decision on future of the NMD program was going to be given to the next president in line, who ultimately would end up being George W. Bush.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the issue of defense against cruise missiles became more prominent with the new Bush administration. In 2002, President George W. Bush withdrew the US from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, allowing further development and testing of ABMs under the Missile Defense Agency, as well as deployment of interceptor vehicles beyond the single site allowed under the treaty. During the Bush&#x27;s time in office, the potentially threatening countries to the United States included North Korea as well as Iran. While these countries might not have possessed the weaponry that many countries containing missile defense systems had, the Bush administration expected an Iranian missile test within the next ten years. In order to counter the potential risk of North Korean missiles, the United States Department of Defense desired to create missile defense systems along the west coast of the United States, namely in both California and Alaska.There are still technological hurdles to an effective defense against ballistic missile attack. The United States National Ballistic Missile Defense System has come under scrutiny about its technological feasibility. Intercepting midcourse (rather than launch or reentry stage) ballistic missiles traveling at several miles per second with a &quot;kinetic kill vehicle&quot; has been characterized as trying to hit a bullet with a bullet. Despite this difficulty, there have been several successful test intercepts and the system was made operational in 2006, while tests and system upgrades continue. Moreover, the warheads or payloads of ballistic missiles can be concealed by a number of different types of decoys. Sensors that track and target warheads aboard the kinetic kill vehicle may have trouble distinguishing the &quot;real&quot; warhead from the decoys, but several tests that have included decoys were successful. Nira Schwartz&#x27;s and Theodore Postol&#x27;s criticisms about the technical feasibility of these sensors have led to a continuing investigation of research misconduct and fraud at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In February 2007, the US missile defense system consisted of 13 ground-based interceptors (GBIs) at Fort Greely, Alaska, plus two interceptors at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The US planned to have 21 interceptor missiles by the end of 2007. The system was initially called National Missile Defense (NMD), but in 2003 the ground-based component was renamed Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD). As of 2014, the Missile Defense Agency had 30 operational GBIs, with a total 44 GBIs in the missile fields in 2018. In 2021 an additional 20 GBIs of 64 total were planned, but not yet fielded. They are tasked with meeting more complex threats than those met by the EKV. 

Defending against cruise missiles is similar to defending against hostile, low-flying crewed aircraft. As with aircraft defense, countermeasures such as chaff, flares, and low altitude can complicate targeting and missile interception. High-flying radar aircraft such as AWACS can often identify low flying threats by using doppler radar. Another possible method is using specialized satellites to track these targets. By coupling a target&#x27;s kinetic inputs with infrared and radar signatures it may be possible to overcome the countermeasures.

In March 2008, the US Congress convened hearings to re-examine the status of missile defense in US military strategy. Upon taking office, President Obama directed a comprehensive review of ballistic missile defense policy and programs. The review&#x27;s findings related to Europe were announced on 17 September 2009. The Ballistic Missile Defense Review (BMDR) Report was published in February 2010.

==NATO missile defense system==

===Mechanisms===
The Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) is the senior NATO committee which acts as the tasking authority for the theater missile defense program. The ALTBMD Program Management Organization, which comprises a steering committee and a program office hosted by the NATO C3 Agency, directs the program and reports to the CNAD.
The focal point for consultation on full-scale missile defense is the Reinforced Executive Working Group. The CNAD is responsible for conducting technical studies and reporting the outcome to the Group.
The NRC Ad hoc Working Group on TMD is the steering body for NATO-Russia cooperation on theater missile defense.

In September 2018, a consortium of 23 NATO nations met to collaborate on the Nimble Titan 18 integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) campaign of experimentation.

===Missile defense===
By early 2010, NATO will have an initial capability to protect Alliance forces against missile threats and is examining options for protecting territory and populations. This is in response to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, including missiles of all ranges. NATO is conducting three missile defense–related activities:

====Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense System capability====
Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense System is &quot;ALTBMD&quot; for short.

As of early 2010, the Alliance has an interim capability to protect troops in a specific area against short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles (up to 3,000 kilometers).

The end system consists of a multi-layered system of systems, comprising low- and high-altitude defenses (also called lower- and upper-layer defenses), including Battle Management Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (BMC3I), early warning sensors, radar, and various interceptors. NATO member countries provide the sensors and weapon systems, while NATO has developed the BMC3I segment and facilitate the integration of all these elements.

====Missile Defense for the protection of NATO territory====
A Missile Defense Feasibility Study was launched after NATO&#x27;s 2002 Prague summit. The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) and NATO&#x27;s Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) were also involved in negotiations. The study concluded that missile defense is technically feasible, and it provided a technical basis for ongoing political and military discussions regarding the desirability of a NATO missile defense system.

During the 2008 Bucharest summit, the alliance discussed the technical details as well as the political and military implications of the proposed elements of the US missile defense system in Europe. Allied leaders recognized that the planned deployment of European-based US missile defense assets would help protect North American Allies, and agreed that this capability should be an integral part of any future NATO-wide missile defense architecture. However, these opinions are in the process of being reconstructed given the Obama administration&#x27;s decision in 2009 to replace the long-range interceptor project in Poland with a short/medium range interceptor.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has stated that NATO&#x27;s pattern of deployment of Patriot missiles indicates that these will be used to defend against Iranian missiles in addition to the stated goal of defending against spillover from the Syrian civil war.

====Aegis-based system====
In order to accelerate the deployment of a missile shield over Europe, Barack Obama sent ships with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System to European waters, including the Black Sea as needed.

It was said that in 2012 the system would achieve an &quot;interim capability&quot; that would for the first time offer American forces in Europe some protection against IRBM attack. However, these interceptors may be poorly placed and of the wrong type to defend the United States, in addition to American troops and facilities in Europe.

The Aegis ballistic missile defense-equipped SM-3 Block II-A missile demonstrated it can shoot down an ICBM target on 16 Nov 2020.

====ACCS Theater Missile Defense 1====
According to BioPrepWatch, NATO has signed a 136 million euro contract with ThalesRaytheonSystems to upgrade its current theater missile defense program.

The project, called ACCS Theater Missile Defense 1, will bring new capabilities to NATO&#x27;s Air Command and Control System, including updates for processing ballistic missile tracks, additional satellite and radar feeds, improvements to data communication and correlation features. The upgrade to its theater missile defense command and control system will allow for NATO to connect national sensors and interceptors in defense against short and medium-range ballistic missiles. According to NATO&#x27;s Assistant Secretary General for Defense Investment Patrick Auroy, the execution of this contract will be a major technical milestone forward for NATO&#x27;s theater missile defense. The project was expected to be complete by 2015. An integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) capability will be delivered to the operational community by 2016, by which time NATO will have a true theater missile defense.&lt;ref name = &quot;AN/SPY-6(V) AMDR supersedes AN/SPY-1&quot;&gt;John Keller (3 September 2019) The Navy&#x27;s Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense Is About to Get a Major Radar Upgrade by 2025&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="1099203" wikidata="Q629524" url="?curid=1099203" title="Theta Xi">
<text>Theta Xi () is a North American Greek-letter social college fraternity. It was founded at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) on April 29, 1864. Of all the social fraternities today, Theta Xi was the only one founded during the Civil War. Its Grand Lodge is headquartered in downtown Atlanta. Since its inception, Theta Xi has grown to include more than 60,000 initiated members. Currently, there are approximately 45 active chapters, and 1 colony. The Theta Xi Fraternity Chapter House at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==
Theta Xi was founded on April 29, 1864 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York as an engineering fraternity however, now a social fraternity. Its founders were:

All of the original founders were members of a local fraternity called Sigma Delta, established in 1859 to rival Theta Delta Chi, which was then a secret society at RPI. Debates were common and encouraged at Sigma Delta meetings; however, on the evening of October 30, 1863, George Brainerd tendered his resignation to the society. This resignation was unanimously declined, but ultimately created a rift. Soon after, talks began circulating of affiliating with a larger organization such as Sigma Phi. However, when Sigma Phi declined to issue a charter, this only increased tensions.

On March 12, 1864, voting took place for members of a new organization, and on April 1, a committee consisting of Waite, Buel, Brainerd, and Packard began preparing a new constitution. By April 6, Buel presented monograms for two new names, Theta Xi and Theta Psi. Theta Xi was chosen to avoid confusion regarding a local fraternity called Theta Psi at Yale.

Within its first forty years, six chapters were established at Yale, Stevens Institute of Technology, MIT, Columbia University, Cornell University, and Lehigh University. It was not until 1905 that a westward expansion occurred with chapters at Purdue and, a month later, Washington University in St. Louis. The first west coast chapter came in 1910 at UC Berkeley, and in April 1921, the first southern chapter was founded at LSU.

In 1962, talks began of folding Kappa Sigma Kappa, a smaller, struggling fraternity into Theta Xi. The merger was completed on August 20, 1962. As a direct result, several of Theta Xi&#x27;s traditions were altered. The coat-of-arms&#x27; fleur-de-lis was changed to have crescent moons in tradition with Kappa Sigma Kappa and the “pledge” pins were also changed to incorporate Kappa Sigma Kappa&#x27;s traditions diagonal white band. The fraternity flower was changed from the white carnation to the blue iris. Finally, the membership manual was changed from &quot;The Theta Xi Pledge Manual&quot; to &quot;The Quest for Theta Xi&quot;. In 1964, as a commemoration for the fraternity&#x27;s centennial, a new Memorial Headquarters was formally dedicated in St. Louis. This served as the official home of the Grand Lodge until 2001.

In 1974, the &quot;Beta Alpha chapter&quot; at Georgia Tech became a Christian chapter while remaining a full member of Theta Xi and the Georgia Tech IFC. The chapter remains Christian today and is the only Christian chapter of a secular national fraternity in the United States. Their model expanded to the &quot;Gamma Phi chapter&quot; at Georgia Southern University in 2008, however that chapter has since reverted to the traditional non-religious status.

Beginning in 1999, Theta Xi began offering Leadership academies to its active brothers. That year, the first President&#x27;s Academy was held to train new chapter presidents, funded by the Theta Xi Foundation. In 2006, this was expanded to include Rising Stars Academy, which aims to make first-year initiates more active in the fraternity.

The Theta Xi Fraternity Chapter House at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.

In 2014, Theta Xi celebrated its sesquicentennial. In honor of this occasion, the National Convention was held in Troy, New York to commemorate the founding of Theta Xi.

William S. Mason, considered to be one of the greatest benefactors and supporters of Theta Xi, was the main supporter of the fraternity&#x27;s adoption of Benjamin Franklin as its patron saint.

Although the fraternity had been headquartered in St. Louis since 1924, on October 3, 2022, it opened new headquarters at 260 Peachtree Street in Atlanta with the address for the Theta Xi Foundation remaining in St. Louis.

== Purpose ==
The Purpose of Theta Xi is to provide a college home environment for its active members in which fellowship and alumni guidance lead to wholesome mental, moral, physical, and spiritual growth. To that end Theta Xi actively supports and augments college and community efforts to make individual members more mature and chapter groups more useful units of society. Through its alumni and undergraduate leadership Theta Xi endeavors to assist each member to develop: ONE, intellectual curiosity that assures the highest scholarship rating consistent with his ability; TWO, habits that lead to better mental and physical health; THREE, sincerity in his association with others and confidence in himself; FOUR, responsibility to chapter, college, community, and country; FIVE, leadership that comes from practicing the principles of democratic self-government; SIX, interests and activities outside regular scholastic studies that employ spare time to advantage; SEVEN, spiritual understanding that provides a reservoir of strength to draw upon when faced with conditions beyond comprehension.

== Service projects ==

At the 111th Anniversary Convention held on August 12, 1974 Theta Xi announced its adoption of the fight against Multiple Sclerosis as its National Service Project. At the 129th Anniversary Convention held on August 4–6, 1993 the fraternity announced its second alternate NSP as Habitat for Humanity.

These charities are a mainstay among all chapters of the fraternity, as well as the numerous other charities supported by individual chapters. On June 20, 1986 Theta Xi was named the Outstanding Volunteer Organization for 1985-86 by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Theta Xi takes exceptional pride in its members&#x27; involvement in these and other charities.

== Theta Xi Foundation ==

The Theta Xi Foundation was founded in 1949 in order to promote the education and growth of members of the fraternity. It is set up to aid in developing the members into responsible citizens that will contribute to the well-being of society. Contributions that mostly come from alumni and friends provide the money for the Foundation. The Foundation consists of two Funds, the Chapter Education Fund and the Unicorn Fund. The funds raised are used to sponsor several programs such as President&#x27;s Academy, Rising Stars Academy, and the District Leadership Academies.

<text>La Serena () is a city and commune in northern Chile, capital of the Coquimbo Region. Founded in 1544, it is the country&#x27;s second oldest city after the national capital, Santiago. As of 2012, it had a communal population of roughly 200,000, and was one of the fastest-growing areas of Chile.

The city is an important tourist destination for Chileans and Argentines, especially during the summer, where people go to visit the beaches. It is the headquarters of the University of La Serena and also is home to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of La Serena, one of five Catholic Archdioceses of the Catholic Church in Chile.

==History==
The sector is currently located where the city was inhabited by the pre-Hispanic village called Viluma or Vilumanque (Mapudungún Snakes and condors). 
La Serena was founded on the orders of the Spaniard Pedro de Valdivia in order to provide a sea link to maintain permanent contact between Santiago and Lima in the Viceroyalty of Peru. For this he would need a place for his troops to rest and eat. The village was founded by captain Juan Bohón with the name &quot;Villanueva de La Serena&quot;. Although the exact date is disputed, probable dates include 15 November or 30 December 1543 and 4 September 1544. Many historians simply say that it was founded in 1544. Five years later, from the night of 11 January 1549 until the following day, a native uprising totally destroyed and burned the village, killing nearly every Spaniard. Pedro de Valdivia ordered Captain Francisco de Aguirre to re-establish the city later the same year on 26 August under the name of &quot;San Bartolomé de La Serena&quot; (now patron saint of the city), in the same place where the &quot;Plaza de Armas&quot; stands today. A few years later, on 4 May 1552, King Carlos I of Spain by royal decree gave it the title of city. One of the reasons to establish La Serena was to control Mapuche groups that had begun to migrate north following the Spanish founding of Santiago in 1541. Indeed, northern Mapuche groups appear to have responded to the Spanish conquest by abandoning their best agricultural lands and moving to remote parts away from the invaders.

During the 17th century, the city suffered repeated attacks from privateers, including Francis Drake who opened the Pacific route to the English in 1578. Bartholomew Sharp, who partly burned and looted in 1680, and Edward Davis, who set fire to the convent of Santo Domingo in 1686, caused great fear among the population, forcing the defence of the city in 1700. In addition to these attacks, the city was almost totally destroyed by the earthquake of 8 July 1730.

During the Revolution of 1859, a rebellion against the conservative government, the city was taken by forces led by Pedro Leon Gallo. Gallo&#x27;s forces were defeated at the Battle of Cerro Grande [es] by an army from Santiago, which then occupied the city.

==Architecture==

Between 1948 and 1952, president Gabriel González Videla prepared the Plan Serena, a project in which the city was renewed with investments and urban redevelopment that would imprint a single seal on the country. It began to take hold in the role of services, to rescue and to develop its own architectural style known as Colonial Revival. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of La Serena. The cathedral, built from the same stone and clade, dates from the 19th century. It must be said that although it lacks the same historical value as the older churches, this is a stone building in a country prone to seismic activity, and has survived various earthquakes. Indeed, during centuries of existence, there is almost no visible damage. All of these churches, along with others of minor importance, provide a unique urban landscape, an image for the city, giving it the nickname &quot;&quot;The City of Churches&quot;.&quot;

Its traditional architecture consists of a series of housing and public buildings, of late 19th-century vintage style, built with wood from the US state of Oregon brought to Chile as counterweight in vessels sailing to the nearby port of Coquimbo to load copper and other minerals for transport back to the US. This Oregon pine and the use of adobe create the genuine image of the city.

There is also a number of remarkable and valuable small churches built of sedimentary stone quarried to the north of the Elqui River, having a characteristic color and texture formed by myriad small shells. These churches are all roughly 350 years old and have undergone restoration to varying degrees, bringing them back to their original form. San Francisco, San Agustín, Santo Domingo are the names of a few of them. In 1920, he began to take shape a new economic boom in the mining of iron, attracting capital and human contingent, resulting in a further change in the urban structure.

Currently, the city has its own architectural style (known as &quot;neocolonial&quot;), which is differentiated from other cities, preserving old buildings in colonial style, with many important National Monuments, mixing it with modern buildings but each one in turn follows the regulatory framework in the construction of these structures which should each have features to maintain the colonial style of the city. In the center of the city until 2008, it is still not possible to identify buildings over eight stories high for a municipal status, however towards the coastal area of the Avenida del Mar, one begins to see a great real estate boom that is distinguished by high-rise buildings, ranging from La Serena running south and along the coast to the neighboring city of Coquimbo.

==Demography==
As of the 2012 census, La Serena had a communal population of 198,164, and the Greater La Serena area had a population of around 400,000.

As of the 2002 census (of the National Statistics Institute) it had 160,148 inhabitants (77,385 men and 82,763 women). Of these, 147,815 (92.3%) lived in urban areas and 12,333 (7.7%) in rural areas. The population grew by 32.6% (39,332 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses, making it one of the fastest-growing regions of the country. Had that growth continued, INE estimated the population would increase to 205,120 by 2008 and 244,070 by 2012, so the growth rate has dropped since then.

In 2002 155,815 persons lived in the city proper, and La Serena was part of the country&#x27;s fourth largest conurbation (pop. 300,000) with nearby Coquimbo, with a total area of . A few of the major city sectors are: El Centro (&quot;downtown&quot;), Peñuelas (actually a suburb between La Serena and Coquimbo), San Joaquín (neighborhood on a hill overlooking the ocean), La Florida, Las Compañías (&quot;the companies&quot;), Cerro Grande (&quot;big hill&quot;), La Antena and the new El Milagro (&quot;the miracle&quot;) development.

==Geography==

The commune spans a surface area of . The city is located on ocean terraces, which are clearly noticeable from the coastal area, through downtown to the eastern sector Vicuña way. The rest of the urban area is based on several small hills, valleys and plains.
The city is commonly divided into various sectors. In the north is the airline sector, subdivided into two sub-sectors called High and Low Company. Nearby is San Pedro Creek. To the south are the areas of La Pampa, San Joaquin and the El Milagro. To the east are the sectors of La Antena, Juan XXIII, La Florida, Colina El Pino and the University District. Finally, to the west is the area of Avenida del Mar. Areas surrounding the city are mainly areas for growing vegetables, and there are a large number of plantations for the cultivation of chirimoyas, avocados and oranges, in addition to where vegetation has an average with some areas found mainly eucalyptus forests. These areas are normally conducive to wildfires sparked during the summer season (January–February).

===Climate===
La Serena has a cool desert climate, similar to nearby places in that it is clearly seasonal – in summer there is an absence of precipitation, but with abundant morning cloudiness and drizzle. which dissipates around noon, giving way to clear skies and days.

In winter, the temperatures descend to between . Being located in a coastal zone, the minimums and maximums are moderated by the maritime influence and the temperature of the cold Humboldt Current. Winter (specifically from May to August) is the rainy season, with a total rainfall of approximately annually in a normal year, notable exceptions being the year 1997 which experienced a total rainfall in the city near , 1880 with and 1888 when as much as fell including in August. The driest year has been 1979 with only , whilst recent years, as in central Chile and Zona Sur, have tended to be drier than the long-term mean.

==Political administration==

As a commune, La Serena is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by a mayor who is directly elected every four years. Since October 2024, the city&#x27;s interim mayor is Luis Henríquez.

Within the electoral divisions of Chile, La Serena is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Mario Bertolino (RN) and Marcelo Díaz (PS) as part of the 7th electoral district, (together with La Higuera, Vicuña, Paihuano and Andacollo). The commune is represented in the Senate by Sergio Gahona Salazar (UDI), Daniel Núñez Arancibia (PC) and Matías Walker Prieto (PDC) as part of the fourth senatorial constituency (Coquimbo Region).

==Economy==

In the last decades, tourism has turned into one of the most important economic activities. The population doubles in the summer months, principally for the beaches, recreational activities, musical festivals, concerts, and Fashion Week. In addition, the city is an obligatory stop for hundreds of pilgrims that arrive to the city of Coquimbo, where during The Serenade they find lodging for visiting the zone and Valle de Elqui.

In this city there are located branches of the more important chain stores of the country, Mall Plaza La Serena, which has the national shops Falabella and París. Also Mall Puerta Del Mar, contains two supermarkets, and regional multistores, such as La Elegante, and shops for home and construction. The downtown is one of the places with major economic and financial institutions of the Coquimbo Region.

===Tourism===
The old part of the city is the largest and most important urban &quot;traditional area&quot; (&quot;zona típica&quot;) in Chile. The churches are distinguished by many styles of belfries, which led to the city being nicknamed &quot;the city of the belfries&quot;.

The Church Cathedral of La Serena was designated a Historical Monument in 1981. Construction was initiated by the French architect Jean Herbage in 1844, and dedicated in 1856. It is the largest temple in the city, constructed in Neoclassic style, measuring long by wide, with three central bodies. Inside there is an organ donated by the philanthropist Juana Ross de Edwards. The belfry dates back from the 20th century.

The town has retained its historic architecture and this, along with a selection of beaches (known as &quot;Avenida del Mar&quot;, &quot;Sea Avenue&quot;), has caused the city to become a significant tourist destination, attracting many foreigners (most of them Argentines from San Juan and Mendoza provinces) during January, and later Santiago residents fleeing February heat.

The beaches of the &quot;Avenida Del Mar&quot; are some of the most crowded in La Serena, which run from the &quot;El Faro Monumental&quot; in the south to Peñuelas&#x27;s beach in neighboring Coquimbo, an extension of . However, the beaches of La Serena have very rough water and are not suitable for swimming. In comparison, beaches in Coquimbo, such as The Horseshoe, have very calm waters and clean sands.

The twelve beaches along the &quot;Avenida del Mar&quot; are El Faro, Los Fuertes, Mansa, Blanca, La Barca, Cuatro Esquinas, La Marina, El Pescador, El Corsario, Hipocampo, Las Gaviotas, and Canto del Agua. All of them except the beacon are suitable for the swimming and aquatic and nautical sports. In recent years the &quot;La Serena Song Festival&quot; (created in 2004) has been gaining national importance, due to the high quality of the invited artists. A new international airport has also been improved. Real estate development along the beach has created a tourist residential development along the Elqui River.

The most famous beach near La Serena is &quot;Morrillos&quot; with of sand and dunes. In the southern part of Morrillos is Guanaqueros, a beautiful spot with calm waters. Water temperatures can reach in summer. The best surf spot is Totoralillo beach with good waves. &quot;El Cacho&quot; wave is one of the famous and works awesome with swells.

The best Enduro mountainbike spot is Cerro Grande just behind La Serena with several trails only for advanced to expert riders.

==Transport==
La Serena relies on diverse means of transport to connect downtown with peripheral neighborhoods and Coquimbo, such as collective taxis, taxis and tour buses. In the past the city was the principal railway center for passenger transport to travel to the interior zone of Vicuña and Ovalle. Today, the only railroad that passes through parts of the city carries iron ore from &quot;El Romeral&quot; mine to Guayacán&#x27;s port in Coquimbo.

The city relies on a bus station to provide transport from La Serena to most of the country, as well as an airport with daily flights to Santiago, Antofagasta, Arica, Copiapó and other destinations. Today there is a project to move the La Florida Airport to an area near Tongoy, Coquimbo, due to population growth close to the current airport with all the danger that this implies.


==Sports==
The city has a football team called Club Deportes La Serena that plays in the second tier of the Chilean league of football. Their home games are played at the La Portada stadium, which has seating for approximately 18,000 spectators. Their biggest rivals are near-neighbors Coquimbo Unido. They are nicknamed &quot;Los Papayeros&quot;, because of the papayas that are grown near La Serena in the Elqui Valley.

Since 2007, there has been a professional tennis tournament, the Challenger de La Serena, on the courts of the Estadio Universidad del Mar, in which the first champion was the Argentine Mariano Zabaleta. The courts also hosted the Davis Cup series between Chile and Russia at the beginning of February 2007.

<text>Walton-on-Thames, known locally as Walton, is a market town on the south bank of the Thames in northwest Surrey, England. It is in the Borough of Elmbridge, about southwest of central London. Walton forms part of the Greater London Built-up Area, sits within the KT postcode, and is served by a wide range of transport links. According to the 2011 Census, the town has a total population of 22,834. The town itself consists mostly of suburban streets, with a historic town centre of Celtic origin. It is one of the largest towns in Elmbridge, alongside Weybridge.

== History ==
The name &quot;Walton&quot; is Anglo-Saxon in origin and is cognate with the common phonetic combination meaning &quot;Briton settlement&quot; (literally, &quot;Welsh Town&quot; – weal(as) tun). Before the Romans and the Saxons were present, a Celtic settlement was here. The most common Old English word for the Celtic inhabitants was the &quot;Wealas&quot;, originally meaning &quot;foreigners&quot; or &quot;strangers&quot;. William Camden identified Cowey Stakes or Sale, Walton as the place where Julius Caesar forded the River Thames on his second invasion of Britain. A fisherman removed several wooden stakes about thigh-width and high that were very black and hard enough to turn an axe, and shod with iron. He sold these to John Montagu, 5th Earl of Sandwich, who used to come to the neighbouring Shepperton bank to fish, for half a guinea apiece. Elmbridge Museum requires definitive evidence of these stakes, the evidence at present limited to pre 20th-century secondary sources that conflict as to detail.

Walton lay within the Anglo-Saxon district of Elmbridge hundred, in the shire (later county) of Surrey.

Walton appears in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 as &quot;Waletona&quot;. The settlement was held jointly as overlords in the feudal system by Edward de Sarisber (Salisbury) and Richard de Tonbrige. Its &quot;Domesday&quot; assets were: 6 hides; 1 church (St. Mary&#x27;s), 2 mills worth £1 5s 0d, 1 fishery worth 5s, 14 ploughs, of meadow, supporting 50 hogs. It rendered £28.

The nucleus of the village is in the north, while later development took place in the southern manors on all sides of the railway station. About half of the land was south of the South Western Main Line. This included, from west to east, Walton Heath, Burwood manor and Hersham manor; these together became the civil parish of Hersham in the 19th century. On a smaller scale, the majority of Oatlands village, to the south-west, formed part of the town. St. Mary&#x27;s Parish Church has some Saxon material and an architectural structure of the 12th century, with later additions. The square flint tower, supported by a 19th-century brick buttress, has a working ring of eight bells, the oldest bearing the date 1606. In the north aisle is a large monument (1755) by the French rococo sculptor and bust maker Roubiliac to Richard Boyle, 2nd Viscount Shannon, commander-in-chief in Ireland, who lived at the former manor and house of Ashley Park in the parish; this was demolished and its many acres subdivided in 1920. Also in the north aisle is a brass to John Selwyn (1587), keeper of Oatlands Park, with figures of himself, his wife and eleven children. An unusual relic kept in the church is a copy of a scold&#x27;s bridle presented to the parish in the 17th century, which is mentioned in Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s classic &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot;. The royal palace of Oatlands, built by Henry VIII in 1538, was a mile upstream to the west.
John Bradshaw lived in the Tudor manor house in the 17th century. He presided at Charles I&#x27;s trial. Under the (39 &amp; 40 Geo. 3. c. lxxxvi) there were enclosed (privatised from common land or manorial land subjected to agrarian rights of others) of the Walton manors, which included holdings at Chertsey and of arable common fields.

The world&#x27;s first documented game of baseball was played in 1749 in Ashley Park, on the estate belonging to the wife of Charles Sackville, Earl of Middlesex. The Earl played in the match along with his friend, Frederick, Prince of Wales.

A School Board was formed in 1878. A previously existing school was enlarged in 1881. The infant school was built in 1884. The Methodist Church, with a spire taller than the tower of the Anglican Church, was built in 1887. The Baptist Church was built in 1901.

A Public Hall, in High Street, was built in 1879 by Mrs Sassoon, who resided at Ashley Park House. This is still in existence and is visible behind the present shopfront. Ashley Park Golf Club was laid out in the 1890s, but ceased to exist prior to 1918.

During World War I, troops from New Zealand were hospitalised in the No. 2 New Zealand General Hospital at Mount Felix House, which is now demolished except for its stable block and clock tower. They are remembered by a memorial in the cemetery, where those who died at Mount Felix are buried, and one in St Mary&#x27;s Church where an annual service of remembrance is held. They are also remembered in the street name New Zealand Avenue, the Wellington Pub (formerly The Kiwi), and a small memorial in the Homebase car park.

Walton upon Thames Urban District merged with Weybridge Urban District to form Walton and Weybridge Urban District in 1933.

In World War II, owing largely to the proximity of important aircraft factories at nearby Brooklands, the town was bombed on various occasions by the Luftwaffe. On 27 September 1940, fighter pilot F/Sgt. Charles Sydney, who was based with 92 Squadron at RAF Biggin Hill, died when his Spitfire (R6767) crashed in Station Avenue. He was buried in Orpington and was commemorated by a memorial plaque adjacent to the former Birds Eye HQ at Walton Court on Station Avenue, close to the crash site although this has recently disappeared with current major redevelopment of the Birds Eye site with new apartments. Hopefully the memorial will be re-erected and re-dedicated later.

Hersham and Walton Motors (HWM) constructed its own racing car in the early 1950s. Stirling Moss competed in his first Formula One Grand Prix in an HWM. HWM was the world&#x27;s first Aston Martin dealership that diversified into Alfa Romeo in 2009.

Walton Town Hall, which was commissioned to serve as the offices of Weybridge Urban District Council, was designed by Sir John Brown Henson and Partners in the modernist style, featured a curved structure built from concrete with stone cladding and was completed in 1966. It became surplus to requirements and was subsequently demolished after Walton on Thames was absorbed into the Borough of Elmbridge in 1974.

The name of the town has resurfaced in the media in March 2023 in relation to Levi Bellfield and his bid to get married while in prison.

==Demography and housing==

The accommodation included 28% detached houses, and 22.6% apartments.
The proportion of households in the town who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

===Demographic change===
For information on the 1851–1901 change in population see Transport below. In 2001 and after boundary changes the population was just over 1,500 lower at 22,834. According to the 2001 census, the population of central Walton was 5,862, with Elmbridge&#x27;s population being 121,936. Central Walton had a male population of 2,791 against Elmbridge&#x27;s male population of 58,867, and the female population of central Walton was 3,071 against Elmbridge&#x27;s 63,069.

== Commerce ==
The GSS (ONS specifically) identifies a Built-up Area of its name generally cited for other articles of this work as to their populations e.g. Guildford, Salisbury, which has a population of 66,566 and extends to Hersham, Sunbury-on-Thames and Shepperton.

The Heart of Walton is the name given to the re-development of Walton town centre alongside the relatively short High Street. This main area of the town centre was built in the 1960s and had become run down owing to poor maintenance. The redevelopment includes a shopping mall and 279 one- and two-bedroom apartments, many with views over the private gardens, avenues and public section of Ashley Park. The main part of the centre, a covered walkway, has several brand retailers including Next, Waterstone&#x27;s, River Island and Desire by Debenhams. The public library was moved here. Further redevelopment has upgraded or built new shops, widening the scope high-end fashion, jewellery, bakery and supermarkets. Restaurants along the New Zealand Avenue side of The Heart include three independents, Nando&#x27;s, Pizza Express, Gourmet Burger Kitchen and Wagamama. Further restaurants exist along the High Street axis and at the far north-eastern and southern parades within the town boundaries. Around the periphery automotive, construction and landscaping businesses have a large presence and the Walton station area has a number of headquarters sized office buildings, including Kia Motors. As well as this, the long-awaited redevelopment of Walton bridge finished in 2013.

==Transport==

Walton-on-Thames is served by Walton-on-Thames railway station, which provides 4 trains per hour to London Waterloo, consisting of 2 semi-fast services and 2 stopping services, with the semi-fast services taking only 25 minutes to reach the terminus. This has proven pivotal to the demographics and to the nature and degree of the town&#x27;s development – in 1851 its population was 4,106 which more than quadrupled in the 60 years to 1911, when its population reached 19,142.

Walton has regular bus services supported by Surrey County Council to nearby towns Weybridge, Shepperton, Hersham, Molesey and Kingston-upon-Thames. A pleasure boat service runs regularly on a stretch of the river that includes a loop around Desborough Island.
Local taxis: there is taxi rank at the Walton-on-Thames Station for approximately 12 taxi cars, which is served between 6:30am and 1:00am.

=== Walton Bridge ===
Six versions of Walton Bridge have crossed the Thames, each westward, to Shepperton. Before the first bridge there was a ferry which went back at least to the early 17th century.

The first bridge, constructed between 1748 and 1750, was a timber structure that stood until 1783. Canaletto painted a picture of this bridge in 1754. The painting, which shows the rococo-style of this bridge, may be seen in the Dulwich Picture Gallery.

The second bridge was constructed in 1788 and stood until 1859. Constructed of brick and stone, it lasted much longer than its predecessor. This bridge was painted by J. M. W. Turner in 1805 following his sketching tour of the River Thames and River Wey.

After the second bridge collapsed a ferry crossing resumed until the construction of the third bridge in 1864. This was a girder bridge on stone piers. At the same time, a brick viaduct was constructed to span the flood plain to the south of the river. The viaduct is still standing.

The third bridge was damaged during World War II in 1940, leading to a permanent weight restriction. To alleviate this a fourth temporary bridge was constructed in 1953 on the downstream side of the old bridge; this was relegated to use by cyclists and pedestrians only until finally demolished in 1985.

The fourth bridge was constructed from prefabricated sections designed by A. M. Hamilton in 1930; built by Callender Cables Ltd, it was called the Callender-Hamilton Bridge. In 1999, the fourth bridge was replaced by yet another temporary, fifth bridge occupying the line of the original bridges. This initially had several problems and had to be resurfaced a number of times causing huge traffic disruptions. The fourth bridge was restricted for use by cyclists and pedestrians only once the fifth bridge was completed.

Building a sixth bridge began in 2011 and was completed in summer 2013, being opened to traffic on 22 July. The two previous bridges were removed. The supplemental brick viaduct to the east remains for cycle and pedestrian use. The £32.4 million bridge is single span (has no piers in the river), which increases views from upstream and downstream and particularly navigation for boats – the first such bridge heading up the River Thames. This is also the only parabolic tied-arch bridge without piers across this river.

== Sport ==

The Elmbridge Xcel Leisure Centre is to the east of the town, near the Thames. The centre includes two swimming pools, an extensive gym, indoor courts and a climbing wall.

The River Thames offers extensive opportunities for water-based sports, including rowing, canoeing, kayaking, skiffing, punting and sailing. Walton Rowing Club, Thames Valley Skiff Club and St George&#x27;s College, are on the river towpath between the town centre and the Elmbridge Xcel Leisure Centre. Weybridge Rowing Club is further upstream in Weybridge.

Walton Athletics Club was founded in 1942 and is based at the new Waterside Drive Athletic Arena. The club has around 200 members ranging in age from 9 years to over 60 years old. The club provides qualified coaching in all athletics disciplines and participates in a number of different leagues to provide appropriate competition for all age groups in track and field, cross country and road running.

Walton-on-Thames Cricket Club are based in Ashley Park with the first team captained by Daniel Roberts. They will play in the Surrey Championship Division two in 2020, having previously won Division Two in 2015 &amp; 2018. Over the years, Walton have had a host of players who have gone on to further honours including Mark Bainbridge (Surrey CCC &amp; England Under-19s), Stephen Murdoch (Wellington), Anthony Alleyne (West Indies Under-19s) and Greg Lamb (Hampshire CCC &amp; Zimbabwe). The club has four Saturday league senior sides and enjoyed a successful 2015 with three of the four sides gaining promotion. The club&#x27;s training is run by Brian Berthoud.

Walton Casuals are a football club who are currently in the Isthmian League Division One South, a level above their neighbours Walton &amp; Hersham. Nicknamed the Stags, they play at Church Road in a ground share with Whyteleafe while developments take place at the Waterside Drive Sports Hub. They previously played at the Waterside Stadium, just off Waterside Drive and adjacent to the modern Elmbridge Xcel Leisure Centre. They are expected to move into their new home ahead of the 2017–18 season. The club play in a tangerine orange and black home kit and a blue and white away kit.

Walton &amp; Hersham are a football club who are currently in the Combined Counties League Premier Division. Nicknamed the Swans, they play at the Elmbridge Xcel Sports Hub. The club play in a red and white home kit and a yellow away kit. In 1973, they won the FA Amateur Cup in its penultimate year, beating Slough Town 1–0 in front of 41,000 spectators (the third largest crowd of the day) at Wembley. Later that year, they achieved a shock 4–0 win over Brian Clough&#x27;s Brighton &amp; Hove Albion (then a Football League Third Division side) in the FA Cup.

Motor cycle racing was staged at Walton Bridge in October 1938. An event was staged on October 30 records that Walton Bridge raced a team from Hounslow at a venue described as Walton Bridge Speedway (on the programme). It is not clear if the event was a grass track meeting or a speedway meeting.

== Local politics ==
Walton-on-Thames is part of the parliamentary constituency of Esher and Walton, which after the 2019 General Election became a marginal Conservative seat, with the Liberal Democrats taking second place. In the 2024 General Election the Liberal Democrats came in first with Monica Harding winning the seat. Becoming the first MP not from the Conservative Party since 1906.

In local elections, recent contests for seats on Elmbridge Borough Council and Surrey County Council have been between the local Conservatives, local Liberal Democrats and the local Residents Association, the Walton Society.

The Walton Society was founded in 1975 by the writer and intellectual Ronald Segal, and entered local politics in 1980 with Gordon Chubb who served until his death in 2006. At one point there were nine Society councillors in all four Walton wards during the period of Residents Groups&#x27; control of Elmbridge from the 1990s to 2006. Following the 2012 elections, the Society held all three Walton Central seats, with the Conservatives holding all eight seats in the Ambleside, North and South wards. Following the 2024 elections, The Walton Society had only one Walton Central seat remaining, whilst the Conservatives held no seats in any ward. Both had lost power after a marked increase in support for the Liberal Democrats. Walton&#x27;s most recent Labour councillor was defeated in 2000.

From 2005 to 2013 the Walton division of Surrey County Council was held by The Walton Society&#x27;s Tom Phelps-Penry. Upon his retirement at the 2013 elections, the seat was gained by Conservative Rachael Lake who had previously held the seat from 1997 to 2005. The Walton South &amp; Oatlands division has been Conservative held since it was created in 1973.

<text>Carr&#x27;s is a British biscuit and cracker manufacturer, currently owned by Pladis Global through its subsidiary United Biscuits. The company was founded in 1831 by Jonathan Dodgson Carr and is marketed in the United States by Kellogg&#x27;s.

==History==
In 1831, Carr formed a small bakery and biscuit factory in the English city of Carlisle in Cumberland; he received a royal warrant in 1841. Within 15 years of being founded, it had become Britain&#x27;s largest baking business.
Carr&#x27;s business was both a mill and a bakery, an early example of vertical integration, and produced bread by night and biscuits by day. The biscuits were loosely based on dry biscuits used on long voyages by sailors. They could be kept crisp and fresh in tins, and despite their fragility could easily be transported to other parts of the country by canal and railway.

Jonathan Carr protested against the Corn Laws, which placed steep tariffs on imported wheat to keep the price of British wheat artificially high. This meant bread was expensive even in times of famine. Carr died in 1884, but by 1885, the company was making 128 varieties of biscuit and employing 1000 workers.

In 1894, the company was registered as Carr and Co. Ltd., but reverted to being a private company in 1908. Carrs Flour Mills Limited was incorporated after acquiring the flour-milling assets. Jonathan&#x27;s four sons were less skilled at managing the business, but biscuit production remained in the family. It became part of Cavenham Foods in 1964 until 1972, when it was sold to United Biscuits group, along with Cavenham&#x27;s other biscuit brands Wright&#x27;s Biscuits and Kemps for $10million. United Biscuits was sold by its private equity owners to the Turkish-based multinational Yıldız Holding in 2014; in 2016, all UB brands including Carr&#x27;s were combined with Yıldız&#x27;s other snack brands to form pladis.

Among members of the Carr family who worked for the business was former Commando Capt. Richard Carr MBE. He was decorated for repeated escape attempts from Italian and German prisoner-of-war camps in the Second World War.

==Business==
Since 1972, the Carr&#x27;s biscuit factory has been part of United Biscuits, and the Carr&#x27;s branded products are marketed in the US by Kellogg&#x27;s. The factory today is known officially as McVitie&#x27;s, but still known locally as Carr&#x27;s.

Carr&#x27;s Flour Mills and the later established agricultural supplies and feeds businesses became Carr&#x27;s Milling Industries plc, which is still based in Carlisle and now known as Carr&#x27;s Group PLC. Its products have since the 1990s appeared in UK supermarkets through the Carr&#x27;s Breadmaker flour range. Carr&#x27;s Group also own companies involved in light engineering. In 2016, Carr&#x27;s Group sold the flour-milling division to Whitworths Holdings Ltd.

In March 2012, it was announced that Carr&#x27;s Table Water Biscuits had lost its royal warrant due to &#x27;changing tastes&#x27; in the Royal Households. Carr&#x27;s promptly licensed the coat of arms of the City of Carlisle to replace the coat of royal arms on their packaging.

==Flooding==
In 2005, the Caldewgate factory in Carlisle lost two months&#x27; production due to flooding.

In 2016, the local newspaper &quot;News and Star&quot; stated that the factory had reopened with a £1 million government grant. However, that same month United Biscuits announced that the factory in Caldewgate, Carlisle, had experienced five feet (over 150cm) of floodwater on 6 December 2015, which damaged the brick ovens and would result in product shortages on retail shelves.

After closure of the works for a month to repair and clear flood damage, production and distribution gradually resumed in spring 2016.

<doc id="1099225" wikidata="Q1937747" url="?curid=1099225" title="Latrodectus bishopi">
<text>Latrodectus bishopi is the scientific name for the red widow spider, which is endemic to the Florida scrub habitat of central and southern Florida, where it lives primarily in sand dunes dominated by sand pine, &quot;Pinus clausa&quot; – a type of vegetation found only in Florida and coastal Alabama.
==Description==

The red widow, &quot;L. bishopi&quot;, has a red-orange cephalothorax, its abdomen is black with yellow rings outlining the rows of red spots and its legs are vermillion red. On its underside, it does not have the familiar hourglass marking and instead usually has one or two small red marks. Females are almost double the size of the male. 
==Taxonomy==
The species was first described in 1938 by B. J. Kaston as the variety &quot;bishopi&quot; of the species &quot;Latrodectus mactans&quot;. The name &quot;bishopi&quot; honors Marshall B. Bishop who collected the specimens on which the description was based. &quot;Latrodectus bishopi&quot; was raised to a full species in 1964 by John D. McCrone and Herbert W. Levi. It can be distinguished from &quot;L. mactans&quot; by features of the male and female genitalia: the embolus of the male palpal bulb has one fewer loop as do the connecting ducts leading to the female spermatheca. 
==Distribution and Ecology==
&quot;L. bishopi&quot; is endemic to central and southern Florida. It is restricted to sand-pine scrub – inland areas of dry sand dunes dominated by sand pine, &quot;Pinus clausa&quot;. Within these areas, the species makes most of its webs in palmetto bushes (&quot;Serenoa repens&quot; and &quot;Sabal etonia&quot;) at heights of 30 cm or more above the ground. The webs are tangled, with a funnel shaped retreat for the spider below. The spider also stores its egg sacs in this retreat. The species is a known predator of &quot;Hemisphaerota cyanea&quot;. Possible predators of &quot;L. bishopi&quot; include sphecid wasps and the Florida scrub jay.

==Toxicity==
&quot;L. bishopi&quot; has been reported to be venomous like the other &quot;Latrodectus&quot; members, and although no bites by this spider are recorded in the medical literature, a bite has been captured on video and documented by biologist Spencer Hoffman on the YouTube channel MyWildBackyard on April 15, 2023. The bite resulted in a mildly painful throbbing sensation that lasted several hours. Unlike cosmopolitan species such as the black and brown widows, it seldom comes into contact with humans. The median lethal dose () of the spider&#x27;s venom has been measured in mice as 2.20 mg/kg (with a confidence interval of 1.29-3.74), and each spider contains about 0.157 mg.

==Conservation Status==
&quot;L. bishopi&quot; is a threatened species in the United States.

<doc id="1099226" wikidata="Q1366695" url="?curid=1099226" title="Urinary retention">
<text>Urinary retention is an inability to completely empty the bladder. Onset can be sudden or gradual. When of sudden onset, symptoms include an inability to urinate and lower abdominal pain. When of gradual onset, symptoms may include loss of bladder control, mild lower abdominal pain, and a weak urine stream. Those with long-term problems are at risk of urinary tract infections.
Causes include blockage of the urethra, nerve problems, certain medications, and weak bladder muscles. Blockage can be caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), urethral strictures, bladder stones, a cystocele, constipation, or tumors. Nerve problems can occur from diabetes, trauma, spinal cord problems, stroke, or heavy metal poisoning. Medications that can cause problems include anticholinergics, antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, cyclobenzaprine, diazepam, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), Stimulants, and opioids. Diagnosis is typically based on measuring the amount of urine in the bladder after urinating.
Treatment is typically with a catheter either through the urethra or lower abdomen. Other treatments may include medication to decrease the size of the prostate, urethral dilation, a urethral stent, or surgery. Males are more often affected than females. In males over the age of 40 about 6 per 1,000 are affected a year. Among males over 80 this increases 30%.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Onset can be sudden or gradual. When the onset is sudden, symptoms include an inability to urinate and lower abdominal pain. When of gradual onset, symptoms may include loss of bladder control, mild lower abdominal pain, and a weak urine stream. Those with long-term problems are at risk of urinary tract infections.
=== Complications ===

Acute urinary retention is a medical emergency and requires prompt treatment. The pain can be excruciating when urine is not able to flow out. Moreover, one can develop severe sweating, chest pain, anxiety and high blood pressure. Other patients may develop a shock-like condition and may require admission to a hospital. Serious complications of untreated urinary retention include bladder damage and chronic kidney failure. Urinary retention is a disorder treated in a hospital, and the quicker one seeks treatment, the fewer the complications.

In the longer term, obstruction of the urinary tract may cause:
* Bladder stones
* Atrophy of the detrusor muscle (atonic bladder is an extreme form)
* Hydronephrosis (congestion of the kidneys)
* Hypertrophy of the detrusor muscle (the muscle that squeezes the bladder to empty it during urination)
* Diverticula (formation of pouches) in the bladder wall (which can lead to stones and infection)

== Causes ==

===Bladder===
* Infection
* Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia
* Neurogenic bladder (commonly spinal cord damage, pelvic splanchic nerve damage, cauda equina syndrome, pontine micturition or storage center lesions, demyelinating diseases, multiple system atrophy, genital herpes, or meningitis-retention syndrome)
* Iatrogenic (caused by medical treatment/procedure) scarring of the bladder neck (commonly from removal of indwelling catheters or cystoscopy operations)
* Damage to the bladder

===Prostate===
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
* Prostate cancer and other pelvic malignancies
* Prostatitis

===Penile urethra===
* Congenital urethral valves
* Phimosis or pinhole meatus
* Circumcision
* Obstruction in the urethra, for example a stricture (usually caused either by injury or STD), a metastasis or a precipitated pseudogout crystal in the urine
* Pseudodyssynergia
* STD lesions (gonorrhoea causes numerous strictures, leading to a &quot;rosary bead&quot; appearance, whereas chlamydia usually causes a single stricture)
* Emasculation

===Postoperative===
Risk factors include
* Age: Older people may have degeneration of neural pathways involved with bladder function and it can lead to an increased risk of postoperative urinary retention. The risk of postoperative urinary retention increases up to 2.11 fold for people older than 60 years.
* Medications: Anticholinergics and medications with anticholinergic properties, alpha-adrenergic agonists, opiates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), calcium-channel blockers and beta-adrenergic agonists, may increase the risk.
* Anesthesia: General anesthetics during surgery may cause bladder atony by acting as a smooth muscle relaxant. General anesthetics can directly interfere with autonomic regulation of detrusor tone and predispose people to bladder overdistention and subsequent retention. Spinal anesthesia results in a blockade of the micturition reflex. Spinal anesthesia shows a higher risk of postoperative urinary retention compared to general anesthesia.
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia: Men with benign prostatic hyperplasia are at an increased risk of acute urinary retention.
* Surgery related: Operative times longer than 2 hours may lead to an increased risk of postoperative urinary retention 3-fold.
* Postoperative pain.

===Chronic===
Chronic urinary retention that is due to bladder blockage which can either be as a result of muscle damage or neurological damage. If the retention is due to neurological damage, there is a disconnect between the brain to muscle communication, which can make it impossible to completely empty the bladder. If the retention is due to muscle damage, it is likely that the muscles are not able to contract enough to completely empty the bladder.

The most common cause of chronic urinary retention is BPH.

===Other===
* Tethered spinal cord syndrome.
* Psychogenic causes – psychosocial stresses, fear associated with urination, paruresis (&quot;shy bladder syndrome&quot;) – in extreme cases, urinary retention can result.
* noradrenergic drugs, that includes tricyclic antidepressants, as well as duloxetine, reboxetine, atomoxetine, venlafaxine, and stimulants, such as methylphenidate, amphetamine and MDMA.
* Use of NSAIDs, or drugs with anticholinergic properties.
* Stones or metastases, which can theoretically appear anywhere along the urinary tract, but vary in frequency depending on anatomy.
* Muscarinic antagonists such as atropine and scopolamine.
* Malfunctioning artificial urinary sphincter.

== Diagnosis ==
Analysis of urine flow may aid in establishing the type of micturition (urination) abnormality. Common findings, determined by ultrasound of the bladder, include a slow rate of flow, intermittent flow, and a large amount of urine retained in the bladder after urination. A normal test result should be 20–25 ml/s peak flow rate. A post-void residual urine greater than 50 ml is a significant amount of urine and increases the potential for recurring urinary tract infections. In adults older than 60 years, 50-100 ml of residual urine may remain after each voiding because of the decreased contractility of the detrusor muscle. In chronic retention, ultrasound of the bladder may show massive increase in bladder capacity (normal capacity is 400-600 ml).

Non-neurogenic chronic urinary retention does not have a standardized definition; however, urine volumes &gt;300mL can be used as an informal indicator. Diagnosis of urinary retention is conducted over a period of 6 months, with 2 separate measurements of urine volume 6 months apart. Measurements should have a PVR (post-void residual) volume of &gt;300ml.

Determining the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) may help diagnose or rule out prostate cancer, though this is also raised in BPH and prostatitis. A TRUS biopsy of the prostate (transrectal ultrasound guided) can distinguish between these prostate conditions. Serum urea and creatinine determinations may be necessary to rule out backflow kidney damage. Cystoscopy may be needed to explore the urinary passage and rule out blockages.

In acute cases of urinary retention where associated symptoms in the lumbar spine are present such as pain, numbness (saddle anesthesia), parasthesias, decreased anal sphincter tone, or altered deep tendon reflexes, an MRI of the lumbar spine should be considered to further assess cauda equina syndrome.

== Treatment ==
In acute urinary retention, urinary catheterization, placement of a prostatic stent, or suprapubic cystostomy relieves the retention. In the longer term, treatment depends on the cause. BPH may respond to alpha blocker and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy, or surgically with prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).

Use of alpha-blockers can provide relief of urinary retention following de-catheterization for both men and women. In case, if catheter can&#x27;t be negotiated, suprapubic puncture can be done with lumbar puncture needle.

===Medication===
====α1-receptor antagonists and 5α-reductase inhibitors====
Urinary retention, including drug-induced cases, may be an early sign of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Treatment typically includes α1-receptor antagonists such as tamsulosin, which relaxes smooth muscle in the bladder neck, and 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride and dutasteride, which reduce prostate enlargement. Clinical trials have demonstrated that combining these medications improves urinary symptoms and lowers the likelihood of retention recurrence.

====Striated muscle relaxants====
Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, acts on GABAergic interneurons in the sacral intermediolateral cell column, facilitating the relaxation of the striated urinary sphincter during voiding. Some evidence suggests it may be beneficial for women with bladder outlet obstruction and pediatric patients.

====Opioid antagonists====
Naloxone, has been tested for urinary retention following epidural or intrathecal anesthesia. While effective, it also reverses analgesia, making it unsuitable for postoperative cases. Nalbuphine, a mixed agonist/antagonist opioid modulator, has shown promise in a reported case of postoperative urinary retention, preserving analgesia while relieving retention. Further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy.

=== Pelvic floor muscle training and biofeedback ===
Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), sometimes combined with biofeedback, is a treatment that aim to teach patients to relax their pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) and striated urinary sphincter during voiding. It has been shown that pelvic floor muscle contraction, especially in women with pelvic floor dysfunction, can significantly reduce vaginal resting pressure and surface electromyography (EMG) activity. However, the majority of evidence supporting PFMT for dysfunctional voiding comes from studies of children, not adults.

=== Electrical stimulation ===
Electrical stimulation, or neuromodulation involves the application of electrodes to induce controlled contraction and relaxation of the pelvic floor muscles. The goal of this intervention is to facilitate relaxation of the external sphincter and pelvic floor muscles, which may assist in voiding. Different methods of electrical stimulation are used, including:

* Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS): This FDA-approved method involves applying electrodes to the skin. TENS has been studied as a treatment for idiopathic non-obstructive urinary retention (NOUR). Studies show that TENS can be applied at different locations, such as transvaginally, over the symphysis pubis and ischial tuberosity to stimulate the pudendal nerve, or at the second sacral foramina and lower abdomen.
:In adults with idiopathic NOUR, transvaginal TENS has demonstrated a subjective success rate of 80% with patients reporting a stronger stream when voiding. Another study showed that TENS applied to the sacral foramina and lower abdomen combined with conservative treatment resulted in a 43% decrease in the number of patients relying on catheterization.
:In children with idiopathic NOUR, TENS combined with pelvic floor muscle training reduced postvoid residual and urinary tract infections.

* Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS): This minimally invasive FDA-approved method involves placing a needle electrode near the tibial nerve. The objective success rate of PTNS (defined as a 50% or greater decrease in catheterizations or catheterized volume) ranges from 25% to 41%. Subjective success rates, based on patient&#x27;s desire to continue treatment, range from 46.7% to 59%.

* Implantable neuromodulator devices: An implantable device is used to stimulate the sacral nerves leading to the contraction of the detrusor muscle. This technique can be combined with posterior rhizotomy to reduce detrusor hyperreflexia.

=== Extracorporeal magnetic stimulation ===
Extracorporeal magnetic stimulation is a non-invasive method that involves the patient sitting on a device that induces consistent pelvic floor muscles contraction and relaxation at a set frequency and interval by repeated magnetic stimulation of motor nerves.

=== Catheter ===
Acute urinary retention is treated by placement of a urinary catheter (small thin flexible tube) into the bladder. This can be either an intermittent catheter or a Foley catheter that is placed with a small inflatable bulb that holds the catheter in place.

Intermittent catheterization can be done by a health care professional or by the person themselves (clean intermittent self catheterization). Intermittent catheterization performed at the hospital is a sterile technique. Patients can be taught to use a self catheterization technique in one simple demonstration, and that reduces the rate of infection from long-term Foley catheters. Self catheterization requires doing the procedure periodically during the day, the frequency depending on fluid intake and bladder capacity. If fluid intake/outflow is around 1.5 litres per day, this would typically be performed roughly three times per day, i.e. roughly every six to eight hours during the day, more frequently when fluid intake is higher and/or bladder capacity lower.

For acute urinary retention, treatment requires urgent placement of a urinary catheter. A permanent urinary catheter may cause discomfort and pain that can last several days.

Older people with ongoing problems may require continued intermittent self catheterization (CISC). CISC has a lower infection risk compared to catheterization techniques that stay within the body.

Challenges with CISC include compliance issues as some people may not be able to place the catheter themselves.

===Surgery===
The chronic form of urinary retention may require some type of surgical procedure. While both procedures are relatively safe, complications can occur.

In most patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), a procedure known as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) may be performed to relieve bladder obstruction. Surgical complications from TURP include a bladder infection, bleeding from the prostate, scar formation, inability to hold urine, and inability to have an erection. The majority of these complications are short lived, and most individuals recover fully within 6–12 months.

===Sitting voiding position===
A meta-analysis on the influence of voiding position on urodynamics in males with lower urinary tract symptoms showed that in the sitting position, the residual urine in the bladder was significantly reduced, the maximum urinary flow was increased, and the voiding time was decreased. For healthy males, no influence was found on these parameters, meaning that they can urinate in either position.

== Epidemiology ==
Urinary retention is a common disorder in elderly males. The most common cause of urinary retention is BPH. This disorder starts around age 50 and symptoms may appear after 10–15 years. BPH is a progressive disorder and narrows the neck of the bladder leading to urinary retention. By the age of 70, almost 10 percent of males have some degree of BPH and 33% have it by the eighth decade of life. While BPH rarely causes sudden urinary retention, the condition can become acute in the presence of certain medications including antihypertensives, antihistamines, and antiparkinson medications, and after spinal anaesthesia or stroke.

In young males, the most common cause of urinary retention is infection of the prostate (&quot;acute prostatitis&quot;). The infection is acquired during sexual intercourse and presents with low back pain, penile discharge, low grade fever and an inability to pass urine. The exact number of individuals with acute prostatitis is unknown, because many do not seek treatment. In the US, at least 1–3 percent of males under the age of 40 develop urinary difficulty as a result of acute prostatitis. Most physicians and other health care professionals are aware of these disorders. Worldwide, both BPH and acute prostatitis have been found in males of all races and ethnic backgrounds. Cancers of the urinary tract can cause urinary obstruction but the process is more gradual. Cancer of the bladder, prostate or ureters can gradually obstruct urine output. Cancers often present with blood in the urine, weight loss, lower back pain or gradual distension in the flanks.

Urinary retention in females is uncommon, occurring 1 in 100,000 every year, with a female-to-male incidence rate of 1:13. It is usually transient. The causes of UR in women can be multi-factorial, and can be postoperative and postpartum. Prompt urethral catheterization usually resolves the problem.

<text>São Paulo Forum (FSP), also known as the Foro de São Paulo, is a conference of left-wing political parties and organizations from the Americas, primarily Latin America and the Caribbean. It was launched by the Workers&#x27; Party () of Brazil in 1990 in the city of São Paulo.

The Forum of São Paulo was constituted in 1990, when the Brazilian Workers&#x27; Party approached other parties of Latin America and the Caribbean to debate the new international scenario after the fall of the Berlin Wall and rising adoption of some economic liberalization policies implemented at the time by right-leaning governments in the region. The stated main objective of the conference was to argue for alternatives to neoliberalism.

The first meeting held in São Paulo in July 1990 was attended by members of 48 parties and organizations from Latin American and the Caribbean. The original name given to the meeting was Meeting of Left and Anti-imperialist Parties and Organizations of Latin America (). Since the 1991 meeting in Mexico City, it started being alternately called Foro de São Paulo in reference to the location of the first meeting. Subsequent meetings have been hosted by many of the parties throughout the region.

==Political stance==
According to FSP, more than 100 parties and political organizations participate in its conferences today. Their political positions vary across a wide spectrum, which includes: social-democratic parties, left-wing grassroots labor and social movements inspired by the Catholic Church, ethnic and environmentalist groups, anti-imperialist and nationalist organizations, communist parties, and armed guerrilla forces. The latter, however, is true only so far as one is willing to think of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia as an actual member of the FSP, when actually the FARC, although never formally banned from the Forum, have been barred from participating in its meetings as early as 2005, when they were refused admittance to that year&#x27;s meeting of the FSP in São Paulo.

These groups differ on a range of topics which go from the use of armed force in revolutions to the support of representative democracy. The Communist Party of Cuba, for example, has adopted a single-party system for decades, while Brazil&#x27;s Workers&#x27; Party (PT) supports and participates in a multi-party system of representative democracy. Some parties such as Chile&#x27;s Social Convergence advocate for radical democracy, participatory democracy, and workplace democracy instead of representative democracy as a primary value. These differences grant special relevance to FSP&#x27;s final declarations, released at the end of each conference, which state the collective position of its members.

Ever since FSP&#x27;s first meeting (1990), the Declaration which was approved expressed the participants&#x27; &quot;willingness to renew leftist and socialist thought, to reaffirm its emancipating character, to correct mistaken conceptions, and to overcome all expressions of bureaucratism and all absence of true social and massive democracy.&quot;

The first Declaration manifests &quot;an active compromise with the validity of human rights, of democracy and of popular sovereignty as strategic values, which place the constant challenge of leftist, socialist and progressive forces renewing their thoughts and actions.&quot;

At the second conference (Mexico, 1991), FSP expanded its objectives to add the proposal of working toward Latin American integration, an interchange of experiences, the discussion of the political left&#x27;s differences and searching for consensus in action. The following conferences reinstate the participants&#x27; willingness to exchange experiences and develop a dialogue, while at the regional and continental level FSP&#x27;s influence grows, with some of its members achieving electoral success and their candidates reaching the presidency of many countries.

During the early 1990s, the FSP was seen by some as expressing the emergence of a new Latin American leftist paradigm: non-authoritarian, de-militarized and grassroots-friendly. As others have noted, however, there is a marked contradiction between the fiery and quasi-revolutionary rhetoric about &quot;socialism of the 21st century&quot; indulged in sometimes by many FSP&#x27;s leaders, and the plain fact that the positions of power held by such leaders depend, on most cases, on their holding positions in governments which have emerged through the electoral road. In a statement made in 2008 in Lima, before a gathering of Peruvian businessmen, however, Brazil&#x27;s President Lula would declare, approvingly, that the FSP had &quot;educated&quot; the Left in the understanding of the existence of possibilities of running for elections and gaining power through the democratic way – a declaration that prompted a comment from AFP, reproduced at the Rede Globo site, to the effect that the hallmark of FSP&#x27;s activities had been its &quot;very moderate&quot; character.

Nevertheless, almost since its inception, the FSP has been the target of criticism from the right in the United States and Latin America, especially in Brazil, describing it as an organization promoting terrorism and/or a revival of communism, something regarded even by mainstream conservatives as unfounded and &quot;exaggerated to say the least&quot;. The allegedly subversive character of the Foro&#x27;s activities, however, was revived during the 2010 Brazilian presidential election campaign, as the vice-presidential candidate in the José Serra ticket, Antônio Pedro de Siqueira Indio da Costa, denounced repeatedly the supposed connection, by way of the Foro, between the Brazilian Workers&#x27; Party and the FARC. Alternatively, the Foro is seen also as more than a simple regular gathering, in that policies that had been advised by it came to be actively implemented later – such as the strengthening of Mercosur, or the setting up of Unasur – but that the Foro was better understood as a &quot;brainstorming organization&quot;, a &quot;think-tank for politicians&quot;. 

During the fifth meeting (Montevideo, 1995) a dispute arose about the attendance of the Movimiento Bolivia Libre, which was charged, in a motion presented by ten parties, led by Argentina&#x27;s Partido Obrero, of support to the repressive actions of the neoliberal government of Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada in Bolivia. The refusal of the motion by the Foro&#x27;s plenum led to the permanent withdrawal of Partido Obrero from the meeting. Partido Obrero had already declared itself in opposition to the Foro&#x27;s positions, having previously made public a note in which it protested against the change in the official name of the organization, as &quot;offering evidence of putting, in the place of actual making of common policies, a kind of purely academic workshop, [a sure sign] of conscious depoliticization leading eventually to the cover-up of rightist policies&quot;.

During the 14th meeting in El Salvador, it was resolved that the Foro should organize a number of subordinate organizations and facilities: an electronic bulletin on the Net, a politic-cultural festival, an electoral observatory and a cadre school.

In the final declaration of the FSP&#x27;s 15th meeting in Montevideo, there is a reinstatement and updating of the Foro&#x27;s goals: to aid &quot;the progressive forces in the continent who are in power and strive in various ways to build projects which – according to each country&#x27;s particular characteristics – allow them to face the main problems generated by neoliberalism&quot; – something which added to the statement made at the same time by Belela Herrera, International Relations chargé of the Uruguayan Broad Front, that issues like ecology, exclusion, racism and xenophobia had added themselves inseparably to the Left&#x27;s traditional agenda. The meeting also debated the ongoing Colombian armed conflict, which prompted a declaration by the International Relations Secretary of the Brazilian Workers&#x27; Party, Valter Pomar, who exposed what in his view was the Foro&#x27;s general stance towards the current Colombian situation: &quot;In Colombia we have a military confrontation that has been going on for decades, having as its players the [Colombian] State, as well as the paramilitary and insurgent forces. The Foro is interested in achieving peace and in having a negotiated process towards reaching this goal&quot;.

In the 16th meeting, which opened on 20 August 2009 in Mexico City, the Foro was expected to concentrate discussion on the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis as well as engaging in efforts to the restoration of the deposed Honduran president Manuel Zelaya. The Vice president of the Mexican Senate, Yeidckol Polevnsky, has invited the Honduran MP Silvia Ayala, as a member of the Democratic Unification Party and leader of the manifestations in support of Zelaya held in San Pedro Sula, to attend the meeting – something that attracted the fury of the pro-government Honduran press.

The ongoing meeting in Mexico will also be the first to organize a parallel youth meeting, where member parties will discuss the impact of the global economic crisis on Latin American youth and the responses that could be offered to it.

In January 2010, the European Left – the broad front of European national Left parties formed in view of a common stand in European politics – at the opening of its Third Congress, expressed its interest in strengthening ties with the FSP.

The Democratic Socialists of America became associate members of the forum in 2023.

<text>Arlington West is a series of projects in coastal California intended to draw public attention to, and to open a discourse on the subject of both military and civilian deaths during the invasion and occupation of Iraq in the early 21st century. The projects, consisting of symbolic grave markers established at beaches, have been implemented at beaches in Santa Barbara, Santa Monica, San Diego, and elsewhere. There is also a similar, but differently named Lafayette Hillside Memorial in the San Francisco Bay Area.

==Memorial==
Arlington West refers to the &quot;temporary cemetery&quot; itself, as well as Veterans for Peace&#x27;s project of installing the temporary memorial. The name, Arlington West, was given to the memorial by WWII Veteran, Ensign Theodore Berlin of PT 167, and reflects the name of the national cemetery of the United States, Arlington National Cemetery, a burial place of honor for fallen war heroes. Arlington National Cemetery is the location of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and is also the final resting place for John F. Kennedy. Arlington West—in a manner similar to &quot;real&quot; cemeteries—is intended by the project organizers to be a place to mourn, reflect, contemplate, grieve, and meditate, to honor and acknowledge those who have lost their lives, and to reflect upon the costs of war.
The memorial in Santa Barbara, which was first put together on November 2, 2003 by local activist Stephen Sherrill, was soon adopted by the local chapter of Veterans for Peace. It is installed each Sunday by a team of volunteers on the beach immediately west of Stearns Wharf. Visitors walking to the tourist attractions on the wharf have a clear view, from the boardwalk, along the beach with the white crosses in the foreground. From the walkway, visitors can see a flag-draped coffin and more than 3,000 crosses, made of wood, which are intended to resemble and represent traditional military grave markers. In addition to the simulated graveyard, a placard listing all the fallen American military personnel since the U.S. invaded and occupied Iraq is prominently displayed; this list is updated weekly. Due to logistical constraints, the number of new crosses was halted at just over 3000 even though the latest death toll has exceeded 4400. Adjacent to the placards is a sign containing the message: &quot;At 3000 crosses, the Arlington West Memorial is 141 feet wide and 310 feet long. A memorial for the Iraqi dead would be 141 feet wide and 12.8 miles long.&quot;
The second Arlington West was installed in Santa Monica, California on February 15, 2004, a Sunday. It was built on the sand just north of the pier at Santa Monica Beach, &quot;as a way to acknowledge the costs and consequences of the addiction to war as an instrument of international policy&quot; (quote from &quot;Veterans for Peace&quot;). Like the initial memorial in Santa Barbara, it has been reinstalled each Sunday and Fourth of July since its inception.

Because of the difficulty of finding out the faiths and/or philosophies of the people who died, the cross (a common symbol of Christianity) was selected to be used as a default marker. But both memorials have many markers that are the Star of David or crescents.

Approximately twenty similar memorials have been installed in various locations across the United States and on the West Coast of the U.S.. The San Diego Veterans For Peace, Chapter 91, installs the memorial 6–8 times/year on beaches and parks in San Diego County.

On December 14, 2003 Arlington West Santa Barbara was illuminated by 455 candles in red cups for the city&#x27;s annual Parade of Lights. The cups glowed a blood red while the light projected upward from the cups caused the white crosses to glow in a flickering, living light. Photojournalists on hand commented that the sight of the illuminated memorial &quot;upstaged the Parade of Lights&quot; (boats in the harbor decked out in Christmas lights). The display drew thousands of spectators during the two hours the candles burned.

Veterans For Peace, an official non-governmental organization founded in 1985 includes men and women veterans from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, and other conflicts, as well as peacetime veterans. The group has published a &#x27;how-to&#x27; for organising, planning and constructing and erecting Arlington West. Several other Memorials have been erected by chapters of Veterans for Peace and other groups.

In the spring and summer of 2005, a similar Arlington West display was taken on a U.S. tour, being installed at places such as Ohio&#x27;s Kent State University (for the 35th commemoration of the shootings of May 4, 1970), as well as at &quot;Camp Casey,&quot; the site of anti-war protester Cindy Sheehan&#x27;s vigil outside the ranch of President George W. Bush near Crawford, Texas.

In August 2010, the members of the Santa Barbara chapter of Veterans for Peace decided to replace the traditional Arlington West memorial with one which focuses on the War in Afghanistan. The 3000+ crosses for the casualties in Iraq were removed and replaced with 1200+ plastic tombstones representing the fatalities in Afghanistan, ending the memorial dedicated specifically to the Iraq war.

==Film==
There was a related film, &quot;Arlington West: The Film&quot;.

==Similar memorials==
In September 2003, a similar display of ninety white crosses laid out in a military configuration and in the shape of a cross was created by American artist Scott Hemeon and included as one of the art installations for Project One&#x27;s annual Wind/Sea/Sky beach sculpture exhibition on Easton&#x27;s Beach in Newport, Rhode Island. This installation, entitled &quot;CrossCurrents&quot;, predated Arlington West by several months.

First created in 2003, the Lafayette hillside memorial, which overlooks a busy highway in Lafayette, California (near Oakland), has generated considerable controversy since November 2006, when it was expanded and a large sign was added.

<doc id="1099254" wikidata="Q374306" url="?curid=1099254" title="Tewfik Pasha">
<text>Mohamed Tewfik Pasha ( &quot;Muḥammad Tawfīq Bāshā&quot;; April 30 or 15 November 1852 – 7 January 1892), also known as Tawfiq of Egypt, was khedive of Egypt and the Sudan between 1879 and 1892 and the sixth ruler from the Muhammad Ali Dynasty. He inherited a state suffering under the financial and political mismanagement of his predecessor Isma&#x27;il. Disaffection in the Egyptian army as well as Anglo-French control of the state in the 1880s culminated in the anti-foreign Urabi revolt. Tewfik also took interest in matters concerning irrigation, education and justice; as well as selling his father&#x27;s female slaves and closing the court&#x27;s harem quarters.

==Early life==
He was the oldest son of Khedive Isma&#x27;il, and was born on April 30 or November 15, 1852. His mother was Princess Shafaq Nur Hanim. He was not sent to Europe to be educated like his younger brothers, but grew up in Egypt.

He spoke French and English fluently.

In 1866 Isma&#x27;il succeeded in his endeavour to alter the order of succession to the Khedivate of Egypt. The title, instead of passing to the oldest living male descendant of Muhammad Ali, was now to descend from father to son. Ismail sought this alteration mainly because he disliked his uncle, Halim Pasha, who was his heir-presumptive, and he had imagined that he would be able to select whichever of his sons he pleased as his successor. But he found, after the change had been made, that the Great Powers (Britain, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) interpreted the new arrangement as applying strictly to the eldest son. Tewfik therefore became heir-apparent. He was given a palace near Cairo to live in, and for twelve years he led an uneventful life, farming and establishing a reputation for good sense and fair dealing with his fellow tenants.

==Marriage==
In Cairo on 15 January 1873 he married Princess Emina Ilhamy (Constantinople, 24 May 1858Bebek, Istanbul, 19 June 1931), daughter of Prince Ibrahim al-Hami and Parlanta Qadin.

==Presidency==
In 1878 he was appointed president of the council after the dismissal of Nubar Pasha. He held this office only for a few months; but this was long enough to show that he had the wisdom to refrain from taking part in the intrigues which then dominated the political life in Egypt and Sudan.

He went back to his estate, and settled down once more to a quiet country life. He was undisturbed only for a short time. On 26 June 1879, Isma&#x27;il, at the insistence of Britain and France, was deposed by Sultan Abdul Hamid II, who sent orders at the same time that Tewfik should be proclaimed Khedive.

==Reign==
The new khedive was so displeased by the news of his accession that he soundly boxed the ears of the servant who first brought the tidings to him. Egypt and Sudan at that time was involved in financial and political troubles brought about by the policy of Isma&#x27;il, and the situation was made worse by the inaction of Britain and France for some months following Tewfik&#x27;s accession. Tewfik&#x27;s people were dissatisfied, his army disaffected; his advisers were nearly all of the adventurer class, with their own ends to gain; and he himself had neither the character of a strong ruler nor the experience that would have enabled him to secure an orderly administration of affairs.

Disorder prevailed until November 1879, when the dual control was reestablished by the governments of Britain and France. For over two years Major Evelyn Baring (afterwards Lord Cromer), Auckland Colvin, and &quot;Monsieur&quot; Ernest de Blignières practically governed the country, endeavouring to institute reforms while possessing no means of coercion.

During all this time the disaffection in the Egyptian army was increasing. Tewfik had been blamed for his failure to take a firm line with the rebels, but his attitude was governed by his relations with Britain and France, and he was unable to control events. The dissatisfaction culminated in the anti-foreign movement headed by Urabi Pasha, who had gained complete command of the army. In July 1882 the attitude of Urabi, who was carrying out defensive works on a large scale, made the British admiral (Sir Beauchamp Seymour, afterwards Lord Alcester) to declare that he would bombard the forts of Alexandria unless they were handed over to him.

Before the bombardment began it was suggested to Tewfik that he should leave the city and embark either upon a man-of-war belonging to one of the neutral powers, or in his own yacht, or in a mail steamer which was then in the port. His answer was, &quot;I am still Khedive, and I remain with my people in the hour of their danger.&quot; At his palace of Qasr el-Raml, three miles (five kilometers) from the town, he was beyond reach of the shells, but his life was nevertheless imperiled. When the rebel soldiers attacked the palace he managed to make his escape and to reach another palace after passing through the burning streets of Alexandria. Here he was obliged to agree that a guard of British bluejackets should protect him from further risk. He showed his courage equally during the cholera epidemic at Alexandria in 1883.

He had gone back to Cairo after the Battle of Tel al-Kebir, had consented to the reforms insisted upon by Britain, and had assumed the position of a constitutional ruler under the guidance of Lord Dufferin, the British special commissioner. When cholera broke out, he insisted upon going to Alexandria. His wife accompanied him, and he went round the hospitals, setting an excellent example to the authorities of the city, and encouraging the patients by kind and hopeful words.

Egyptian Fundamental Ordinance of 1882, a constitution, followed an abortive attempt to promulgate a constitution in 1879. The document was limited in scope and was effectively more of an organic law of the Consultative Council to the khedive than an actual constitution.

In 1884, Sir Evelyn Baring (Lord Cromer) went back to Egypt as diplomatic agent and Consul-General of Britain. His first task was to demand that Tewfik should abandon the Turco-Egyptian Sudan. Tewfik gave his consent with natural reluctance, but, having consented, he did everything he could to ensure the success of the policy which Baring had been sent to carry out. He behaved with equal propriety during the negotiations between Sir H. Drummond Wolff and the Turkish envoy, Mukhtar Pasha, in 1886. His position was not a dignified one but that of a titular ruler compelled to stand by while others discussed and managed the affairs of his country. The Sultan was his suzerain; in Britain he recognized his protector: to the representative of each he endeavoured to show friendliness and esteem. As time went on his confidence in Baring increased, until at last he deferred to the British agent in almost everything. On occasion, however, he acted on his own initiative, as when in June 1888 he dismissed Nubar Pasha and summoned Riaz Pasha to form a ministry, an action influenced, nevertheless, by Tewfik&#x27;s knowledge of the divergence of views between Nubar and the British agent. Baring encouraged Tewfik to show his activity in matters of administration, and he took a great interest in all matters connected with irrigation, education and justice. He was not an imposing man, but he showed a genuine desire to govern his country for its own benefit. He understood the importance to Egypt of British assistance and support; his natural shrewdness made him accept the British conditions; his natural good feeling kept him from any inclination to intrigue.

== Personal life ==
He was courteous and amiable, he had no desire to keep up the unapproachable state of an oriental ruler. In many ways his manners and habits were less oriental than European. He married in 1873 his ethnic Albanian kinswoman, Emina Ilhamy, with whom he lived very happily. She was his only wife and Tewfik was a strong advocate of monogamy. When Tewfik ascended the throne, he closed the harem quarters in the imperial palace, and sold all of his father&#x27;s female slaves to slave markets.

==Death==
He died on 7 January 1892, at the Helwan Palace near Cairo, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Abbas II.

==Issue==
By his wife he had the following children:
*Abbas Hilmi II Pasha, Khedive of Egypt;
*Prince Mohammed Ali Tewfik (Kubba Palace, Cairo, 9 November 1875Lausanne, Switzerland, 18 March 1955, and buried in Khedive Tawfik Mausoleum, Kait Bey, Cairo);

*Princess Nimatullah Hanim (Cairo, 23 October 1882Nice, France, 1965, and buried there at the cimetière de Caucade).

A fleet submarine, &quot;Raton&quot; was laid down on 29 May 1942 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin. She was launched on 24 January 1943, sponsored by Mrs. C. C. West, and commissioned on 13 July 1943.

==Service history==
===World War II===
====July–October 1943====
Following training in Lake Michigan, &quot;Raton&quot; moved to Coco Solo in the Panama Canal Zone for additional training. She was off Coco Solo on 11 August 1943 when the merchant ship ′s United States Navy Armed Guard mistakenly opened fire on her, firing one and two rounds. &quot;Raton&quot; immediately crash-dived and sustained no damage.

&quot;Raton&quot; departed Panama for the South West Pacific Area on 19 September 1943, and upon arriving at Brisbane, Australia, on 16 October 1943, joined Submarine Force, United States Seventh Fleet.

==== First war patrol, November – December 1943 ====

From Brisbane, &quot;Raton&quot; headed for Tulagi in the Solomon Islands for her first war patrol which she conducted from 20 November to 6 December 1943 — in the Bismarck Archipelago–Solomons–New Guinea area. On 24 November 1943, while patrolling west of Massau, &quot;Raton&quot; sighted a Japanese convoy of two cargo ships escorted by two destroyers and a Nakajima A6M2-N (Allied reporting name &quot;Rufe&quot;) floatplane. She trailed the convoy and that night made a torpedo attack, sinking the cargo ship &quot;Onoe Maru&quot;. Displaying excellent antisubmarine warfare proficiency, the two destroyers thwarted four attempts &quot;Raton&quot; made to sink the remaining cargo ship.

On 28 November 1943, &quot;Raton&quot; sighted a Rabaul-bound Japanese convoy of five cargo ships accompanied by two escorts. In a submerged attack, &quot;Raton&quot; sank two of the cargo ships, &quot;Hokko Maru&quot; and &quot;Yuri Maru&quot;. After a severe pounding by the escorts, &quot;Raton&quot; escaped, but she remained in the area to renew her attack on the convoy. In a night attack, she heavily damaged a third cargo ship, then called for assistance, as her torpedoes were nearly expended. The submarine arrived and joined the attack, only to be attacked by the two Japanese destroyers. &quot;Raton&quot; surfaced and raced at flank speed to draw the escorts away from &quot;Gato&quot; and succeeded, allowing &quot;Gato&quot; to sink the cargo ship &quot;Columbia Maru&quot;. &quot;Raton&quot; concluded her patrol with her return to Milne Bay, New Guinea, for rest and refit there alongside the submarine tender .

==== Second and third war patrols, December 1943–April 1944 ====

&quot;Raton&quot; departed Milne Bay on her second war patrol— conducted from 11 December 1943 to 25 January 1944 — bound for the Mindanao–Celebes–Halmahera area. On 24 December 1943, she attacked a Japanese convoy of four merchant ships and two destroyers in Morotai Strait, sinking the merchant ship &quot;Heiwa Maru&quot; and damaging an auxiliary aircraft carrier.

On 2 January 1944, &quot;Raton&quot; encountered two Japanese tankers escorted by a northwest of Faland Island on the Palau shipping lane. She scored hits on one tanker, but then the Japanese escorts interrupted her attack. &quot;Raton&quot; departed the patrol area on 19 January 1944 and reached Fremantle, Australia, on 25 January 1944 for refit by the submarine tender .

&quot;Raton&quot; conducted her third war patrol from 18 February to 14 April in the Java Sea, the Karimata Strait, and the South China Sea. The submarine sank the only two ships &quot;Raton&quot; contacted during the patrol.

==== Fourth war patrol, May–June 1944 ====

&quot;Raton&quot;′s fourth patrol began on 19 May when she got underway for a patrol area in the South China Sea and Java Sea, which provided good hunting. On 23 May 1944, she intercepted two small intercoastal cargo ships north of the Tambelan Islands and sank both with her deck gun. That same evening, she contacted the Japanese fast convoy Hi-63, which consisted of three transports and four destroyers. She sank the destroyer , and damaged a transport.

On 27 May 1944, &quot;Raton&quot;′s logbook reported:

&quot;0615 (H) Ship shaken up considerably by either two underwater explosions or by striking submerged object. People in forward torpedo room thought we had struck something or had been struck by something.&quot;

This turned out to be two torpedoes fired by the submarine . &quot;Lapon&quot; was looking for a Japanese submarine passing through the area and mistook &quot;Raton&quot; for that submarine. &quot;Lapon&quot;′s commanding officer checked fire on the second set of torpedoes realizing he was not shooting at an enemy submarine. Later dry-dock inspection of &quot;Raton&quot; showed dents where the torpedoes hit. This is the only known friendly fire incident in World War II between two U.S. submarines.

On 28 May 1944, &quot;Raton&quot; sighted and tracked a Japanese Type L submarine, but was unable to attack due to an unfavorable firing angle.

On 6 June 1944, a bright moonlit night allowed &quot;Raton&quot; to sight a large Japanese convoy of 11 ships with four destroyer-type escorts. Three hits from a spread of torpedoes &quot;Raton&quot; fired blew apart one frigate, but &quot;Raton&quot; received a severe pounding from a prolonged depth charge attack before making her escape.

A boarding party from &quot;Raton&quot; captured a small sailing vessel on 13 June 1944, taking 11 prisoners-of-war and scuttling the craft. On 17 June 1944, &quot;Raton&quot; sighted a small cargo ship, sinking it with one torpedo and rescuing nine survivors. &quot;Raton&quot; returned to Fremantle on 23 June 1944 for upkeep alongside the submarine tender .

==== Fifth and sixth war patrols, July–December 1944 ====

&quot;Raton&quot;′s fifth war patrol, conducted from 18 July to 10 September 1944 with a patrol area in the South China Sea off Luzon, gave her only one victory, a Japanese tanker left beached off Dasol Bay, in the Philippines on 4 August 1944.

&quot;Raton&quot; had better luck on her sixth war patrol, which she began on 6 October 1944, again with a patrol area in the South China Sea. On the night of 18 October 1944, &quot;Raton&quot; slipped into the center of a nine-ship Japanese convoy for a surface attack. She fired both sets of torpedo tubes, her bow tubes at six overlapping targets and her stern tubes at a large cargo ship. Two merchant ships — &quot;Shiranesan Maru&quot; and &quot;Taikai Maru&quot; — sank, and another vessel was damaged. A final attack resulted in damage to another cargo ship. With her torpedo supply running low and a typhoon approaching, &quot;Raton&quot; pulled into Mios Woendi in the Schouten Islands for more fuel and torpedoes with which to finish the patrol.

Leaving Mios Woendi 27 October 1944, &quot;Raton&quot; encountered a Japanese task group of two heavy cruisers and five escort vessels on 6 November 1944. In a submerged attack, she scored three hits on the &quot;Mogami&quot;-class heavy cruiser , but did not put &quot;Kumano&quot; out of action.

On 11 November 1944, &quot;Raton&quot; and the submarine attacked a four-ship Japanese convoy guarded by three escorts. In a surface action, &quot;Raton&quot; sank &quot;Unkai Maru&quot; and &quot;Kurasaki&quot; with four torpedoes. Then, both submarines fired torpedoes at the remaining auxiliary ships with unconfirmed results. With only four torpedoes remaining, &quot;Raton&quot; headed for the United States, arriving at San Francisco, California, on 1 December 1944.

==== Seventh and eighth war patrols, April–July 1945 ====

On 13 March 1945, after an overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California, &quot;Raton&quot; headed west for Pearl Harbor, HAwaii, for refresher training. She departed for the Yellow Sea on 20 April 1945 to begin her seventh war patrol. On 2 May 1945, she blew up a loaded Japanese tanker, &quot;Toryu Maru&quot;, in a night torpedo attack off China′ Shantung Peninsula despite gunfire from two Japanese escorts. That same day, &quot;Raton&quot; sank a medium-sized Japanese cargo ship, &quot;Rezikan Maru&quot;, in a submerged torpedo approach. On 16 May 1945, she made a submerged attack on two Japanese transports, sinking the larger one, &quot;Eiju Maru&quot;. &quot;Raton&quot; concluded the patrol with her arrival at Guam on 25 May 1945 for upkeep alongside the submarine tender .

&quot;Raton&quot; departed Guam on 22 June 1945 for her final patrol of World War II, tasked with lifeguard duty off Hong Kong. No Allied planes went down in the area, and she made no contact with Japanese forces. Arriving at Subic Bay in the Philippines on 23 July 1945 for upkeep, &quot;Raton&quot; was preparing for her next patrol when the war ended on 15 August 1945.

=== Post-World War II service, 1946–1948 ===

====1945–1949====
On 31 August 1945. &quot;Raton&quot; departed the Philippines for the United States, arriving at San Francisco in mid-September 1945. Following overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, &quot;Raton&quot; transited the Panama Canal, and arrived Naval Submarine Base New London in New London, Connecticut, on 12 March 1946, where she was assigned to the United States Second Fleet. As the Cold War began, she spent the next 2½ years in training exercises in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. After being placed in reserve in the fall of 1948, &quot;Raton&quot; was decommissioned at Atlantic Reserve Fleet, New London on 11 March 1949.

==== Radar picket submarine (SSR-270), 1953–1959 ====
&quot;Raton&quot; remained in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at New London until July 1952, when she was towed to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for conversion to a radar picket submarine. Accordingly redesignated SSR-270 on 18 July 1952, she was recommissioned on 21 September 1953, Commander J. K. Wills in command. Departing Philadelphia on 8 December 1953, &quot;Raton&quot; underwent training for several months in the Norfolk, Virginia, area, operating from Naval Station Norfolk. Ordered to the Pacific, she arrived at San Diego, California, on 7 March 1954 via the Panama Canal.

&quot;Raton&quot; spent the next year in local operations before departing San Diego on 11 May 1955 for a six-month deployment to the western Pacific as a unit of the United States Seventh Fleet, her first post-World War II deployment to the Western Pacific. She returned to San Diego on 6 November 1955, and subsequently trained off the United States West Coast. She deployed to the western Pacific for her second post-World War II Seventh Fleet deployment on 13 May 1957. She returned to San Diego on 8 November 1957 and resumed training activities.

After overhaul at Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco from 7 July to 24 November 1958 and subsequent underway training, &quot;Raton&quot; made a third post-World War II deployment in the Seventh Fleet in the western Pacific from early March to mid-November 1959, participating in operations with forces of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. In early 1960, &quot;Raton&quot; was engaged in local operations in the San Diego area, including evaluation of new sonar concepts and the training of Underwater Demolition Team personnel in covert reconnaissance.

====Auxiliary research submarine (AGSS-270), 1960–1968 ====

On 1 July 1960, &quot;Raton&quot; was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine and redesignated AGSS-270. After a major overhaul at Mare Island Naval Shipyard from January to April 1961, she headed west for her fourth post-World War II western Pacific deployment with the Seventh Fleet on 3 July 1961, returning to San Diego on 19 December 1961. She spent 1962 in fleet training operations off the U.S. West Coast, providing services for air, surface, and submarine forces. On 9 April 1962, it was reported that a kite had snagged on &quot;Raton&quot;, and this incident was referenced in the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip of 19 May 1962, wherein it is implied that the kite had belonged to the long-suffering Charlie Brown, whose problems with flying kites was a standard running gag of the strip.

&quot;Raton&quot;′s fifth post-World War II western Pacific deployment, from January to June 1963, included participation in two major anti-submarine warfare exercises with U.S. and SEATO forces. Following an overhaul period from November 1963 to early March 1964, &quot;Raton&quot; deployed again to the western Pacific from 6 July to 23 December 1964, where she operated with naval forces of Thailand, the Philippines, and the Republic of China, under the Military Assistance Program.

&quot;Raton&quot; engaged in local fleet and type operations in the San Diego area during 1965 and early 1966. In mid-April 1966, she got underwat for another tour of duty with the Seventh Fleet. While deployed, she exercised with SEATO naval units in Exercise Sea Imp. On 17 October 1966, she returned to San Diego.

&quot;Raton&quot; spent 1967 in the San Diego area in local operations, conducting United States Naval Reserve training and undergoing a semiannual overhaul. On 20 and 21 May 1968, she served as a test ship to determine whether a small fleet tug could rescue men from a sunken submarine resting on the ocean floor. &quot;Raton&quot; commenced her final western Pacific deployment 15 July 1968, arriving at Yokohama, Japan, on 7 August 1968. During her deployment, she provided training services to Seventh Fleet and SEATO units. She returned to San Diego on 20 December 1968.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Raton&quot; was decommissioned at Mare Island Naval Shipyard and stricken from the Navy List on 28 June 1969. Her stripped hull was designated as a target ship for United States Pacific Fleet gunnery exercise. She was sold for scrapping on 10 December 1973.

<doc id="1099256" wikidata="Q650050" url="?curid=1099256" title="Intraocular pressure">
<text>Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the fluid pressure inside the eye. Tonometry is the method eye care professionals use to determine this. IOP is an important aspect in the evaluation of patients at risk of glaucoma. Most tonometers are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

==Physiology==
Intraocular pressure is determined by the production and drainage of aqueous humour by the ciliary body and its drainage via the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral outflow. The reason for this is because the vitreous humour in the posterior segment has a relatively fixed volume and thus does not affect intraocular pressure regulation.

An important quantitative relationship (Goldmann&#x27;s equation) is as follows:

:formula_1

Where:
* formula_2 is the IOP in millimeters of mercury (mmHg)
* formula_3 the rate of aqueous humour formation in microliters per minute (μL/min)
* formula_4 the resorption of aqueous humour through the uveoscleral route (μL/min)
* formula_5 is the facility of outflow in microliters per minute per millimeter of mercury (μL/min/mmHg)
* formula_6 the episcleral venous pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

The above factors are those that drive IOP.

==Measurement==

Palpation is one of the oldest, simplest, and least expensive methods for approximate IOP measurement, however it is very inaccurate unless the pressure is very high. Intraocular pressure is measured with a tonometer as part of a comprehensive eye examination. Contact lens sensors have also been used for continuous intraocular pressure monitoring.

Measured values of intraocular pressure are influenced by corneal thickness and rigidity. As a result, some forms of refractive surgery (such as photorefractive keratectomy) can cause traditional intraocular pressure measurements to appear normal when in fact the pressure may be abnormally high. A newer transpalpebral and transscleral tonometry method is not influenced by corneal biomechanics and does not need to be adjusted for corneal irregularities as measurement is done over upper eyelid and sclera.

==Classification==
Current consensus among ophthalmologists and optometrists defines normal intraocular pressure as that between 10 mmHg and 20 mmHg. The average value of intraocular pressure is 15.5 mmHg with fluctuations of about 2.75 mmHg.

Ocular hypertension (OHT) is defined by intraocular pressure being higher than normal, in the absence of optic nerve damage or visual field loss.

Ocular hypotension, hypotony, or ocular hypotony, is typically defined as intraocular pressure equal to or less than 5 mmHg. Such low intraocular pressure could indicate fluid leakage and deflation of the eyeball.

==Influencing factors==
=== Daily variation ===
Intraocular pressure varies throughout the night and day. The diurnal variation for normal eyes is between 3 and 6 mmHg and the variation may increase in glaucomatous eyes. During the night, intraocular pressure may not decrease despite the slower production of aqueous humour. Glaucoma patients&#x27; 24-hour IOP profiles may differ from those of healthy individuals.

=== Fitness and exercise ===
There is some inconclusive research that indicates that exercise could possibly affect IOP (some positively and some negatively).

=== Musical instruments ===
Playing some musical wind instruments has been linked to increases in intraocular pressure. A 2011 study focused on brass and woodwind instruments observed &quot;temporary and sometimes dramatic elevations and fluctuations in IOP&quot;.
Another study found that the magnitude of increase in intraocular pressure correlates with the intraoral resistance associated with the instrument, and linked intermittent elevation of intraocular pressure from playing high-resistance wind instruments to incidence of visual field loss.
The range of intraoral pressure involved in various classes of ethnic wind instruments, such as Native American flutes, has been shown to be generally lower than Western classical wind instruments.

=== Drugs ===
Intraocular pressure also varies with a number of other factors such as heart rate, respiration, fluid intake, systemic medication and topical drugs. Alcohol and marijuana consumption leads to a transient decrease in intraocular pressure and caffeine may increase intraocular pressure.

Taken orally, glycerol (often mixed with fruit juice to reduce its sweet taste) can cause a rapid, temporary decrease in intraocular pressure. This can be a useful initial emergency treatment of severely elevated pressure.

The depolarising muscle relaxant succinylcholine, which is used in anaesthesia, transiently increases IOP by around 10 mmHg for a few minutes. This is significant for example if the patient requires anaesthesia for a trauma and has sustained an eye (globe) perforation. The mechanism is not clear but it is thought to involve contraction of tonic myofibrils and transient dilation of choroidal blood vessels. Ketamine also increases IOP.

==Significance==
Ocular hypertension is the most important risk factor for glaucoma.

Intraocular pressure has been measured as an outcome in a systematic review comparing the effect of neuroprotective agents in slowing the progression of open angle glaucoma.

Differences in pressure between the two eyes are often clinically significant, and potentially associated with certain types of glaucoma, as well as iritis or retinal detachment.

Intraocular pressure may become elevated due to anatomical problems, inflammation of the eye, genetic factors, or as a side-effect from medication. Intraocular pressure laws follow fundamentally from physics. Any kinds of intraocular surgery should be done by considering the intraocular pressure fluctuation. Sudden increase of intraocular pressure can lead to intraocular micro barotrauma and cause ischemic effects and mechanical stress to retinal nerve fiber layer. Sudden intraocular pressure drop can lead to intraocular decompression that generates micro bubbles that potentially cause multiple micro emboli and leading to hypoxia, ischemia and retinal micro structure damage.

<doc id="1099259" wikidata="Q133242" url="?curid=1099259" title="Apocynum">
<text>Apocynum, commonly known as dogbane or Indian hemp, is a small genus of the flowering plant family Apocynaceae. Its name comes from Ancient Greek , from &quot;away&quot; and &quot;dog&quot;, referring to dogbane (&quot;Cionura erecta&quot;), which was used to poison dogs. The genus is native to North America, temperate Asia, and southeastern Europe.

&quot;Apocynum&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the mouse moth and the queen butterfly.

==Uses==
&quot;Apocynum cannabinum&quot; is used as a source of fiber by Native Americans. &quot;Apocynum venetum&quot; () is used as an herbal tea in China. Dogbane contains cymarin, a cardiotonic agent formerly used to treat cardiac arrhythmia in humans.

==Species==
Almost 300 names have been proposed in the genus for species, subspecies, and forms. , only the following five species and hybrids are currently recognized, with several subspecies and varieties accepted for &quot;A. androsaemifolium&quot; and &quot;A. venetum&quot; (see their respective species pages).

* &quot;Apocynum androsaemifolium&quot; – Canada, United States, northeastern Mexico
* &quot;Apocynum cannabinum&quot; – Canada, United States
* &quot;Apocynum × floribundum&quot; (a hybrid of &quot;A. androsaemifolium&quot; and &quot;A. cannabinum&quot;) – Canada, United States, northern Mexico
* &quot;Apocynum pictum&quot; – China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan
* &quot;Apocynum venetum&quot; – southeastern Europe and Asia

<doc id="1099274" wikidata="Q5136895" url="?curid=1099274" title="Clyde Crashcup">
<text>Clyde Crashcup is a fictional character from the early 1960s animated television series &quot;The Alvin Show&quot;. He is a scientist in a white coat who tends to &quot;invent&quot; things that had already been invented; his experiments invariably fail. He usually invented by penciling the concept in air, with the picture becoming the actual object. The character has also appeared in comics and other Alvin and the Chipmunks works after &quot;The Alvin Show&quot;.

== Creation ==
Clyde Crashcup was created by Ross Bagdasarian. He is voiced by Shepard Menken mimicking the enunciation of Richard Haydn&#x27;s nasal-voiced character Edwin Carp.
Clyde had one of the four segments of each episode of &quot;The Alvin Show&quot;, and the Chipmunks starred in the other three (two of which were musical segments).

== Character details ==
Crashcup is a scientist in a white coat whose experiments invariably fail. His was the only voice heard in many of the episodes because the other main character in the series was his assistant Leonardo, who only whispered into Clyde&#x27;s ear.

Clyde Crashcup was primarily an inventor rather than a researcher, although he tended to &quot;invent&quot; things that had already been invented. However, in one episode, he built a functioning time machine. He typically would invent something by taking a pencil out of his lab coat&#x27;s pocket and drawing a picture in midair of his conception: the picture would then become the actual object.
With the release of &quot;This Is Your Life Clyde CrashCup&quot; it shows him for the first time of wearing black pants and black bowtie and a grey shirt.

Clyde&#x27;s catchphrase was to break down the name of his invention into its metonymic elements to explain his thought process. For example, when asked to justify the invention of the telephone, he would say &quot;That&#x27;s &#x27;tele-&#x27; for &quot;tele&quot; and &#x27;-phone&#x27; for &quot;phone&quot;: telephone.&quot;

In one episode, Clyde invented a wife, voiced by June Foray.

== Other media ==
* Dell Comics published 5 issues of a &quot;Clyde Crashcup&quot; comic book from Aug-Oct 1963 to Sept-Nov 1964. During a period spanning parts of 1963 and 1964, Dell also published a 12¢ and a 25¢ comic book titled &quot;Alvin and His Pals in Merry Christmas with Clyde Crashcup and Leonardo&quot;, in which Clyde and Leonardo appear throughout. All were written by John Stanley.
* In 1981, Crashcup appeared on the TV-special &quot;A Chipmunk Christmas&quot;, in a dream sequence; he told Alvin that he&#x27;d just invented Santa Claus. True to Crashcup&#x27;s earlier form, his Santa is shown as Abraham Lincoln in a hollowed out pumpkin. Charles Berendt provides the voice of Clyde Crashcup. Recent television airings of &quot;A Chipmunk Christmas&quot; edit out the dream sequence due to time constraints concerning broadcast commercial time.
* Crashcup later had a special guest spot in the modern &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; 1990 episode &quot;Back to Our Future&quot;, in which he showed up in the time of the new show with a time machine and brought the modern Chipmunks back to his time, where they temporarily switched places with the &quot;Alvin Show&quot; Chipmunks. It was later released on VHS on April 14, 1994, as &quot;Back to Alvin&#x27;s Future&quot;.
* In &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman&quot;, the Chipmunks and the Chipettes go to school at Clyde C. Crashcup Elementary School, a school apparently named after him.

<text>Enigma is a 1982 Anglo-American thriller film directed by Jeannot Szwarc and starring Martin Sheen, Sam Neill, Brigitte Fossey, and Kevin McNally. Based on Michael Barak&#x27;s novel &quot;Enigma Sacrifice&quot;, the film centers on a CIA agent who tries to infiltrate Soviet intelligence in order to stop a murderous plot.

==Plot==
East German dissident Alex Holbeck (Martin Sheen), living in Paris, hosts a radio program aimed at Iron Curtain countries. Bodley (Michael Lonsdale), a CIA agent, recruits Alex to take on a dangerous assignment.

Alex is sent to East Berlin on a mission to steal an Enigma code scrambler. This is part of an attempt to stop the Russian assassination of five Soviet dissidents planned for Christmas Day. What Alex does not know is that the CIA already has a code scrambler. By stealing the scrambler in Berlin, they are trying to convince the Russians that they do not have a copy.

On arrival in Berlin, Alex finds that the East German police and KGB knows that he is there. Alex must use numerous disguises and escape from a number of capture attempts. He seeks shelter with his former lover, Karen Reinhardt (Brigitte Fossey), before moving on, as it is too dangerous for her. Karen and a number of Alex&#x27;s other old friends are arrested and tortured by the police in an attempt to gain information about Alex&#x27;s whereabouts.

As he gets more desperate, Alex enlists Karen&#x27;s help again; she seduces Dimitri Vasilikov (Sam Neill), the KGB man in charge of the hunt for Alex, to obtain information. In the end, Dimitri catches Alex and Karen and finds the scrambler hidden in an exhibition artifact. As he is in love with Karen, he lets them go, but keeps the scrambler, which was in fact not needed. On Christmas Day, the assassination attempt is successfully thwarted.

==Cast==

==Production==
Goldcrest Films put up $58,000 in development costs and invested £985,000 in the budget of $8.1 million. The company received £355,000, losing £630,000.

&quot;Enigma&quot; was shot partly, in 1982, at Paris–Le Bourget Airport. A scene was shot in the terminal, in the hall of eight columns, disused at the time, others on the terrace or in front of the entrance.

The aircraft in &quot;Enigma&quot; are: 
* Dassault Super Mystère B.2 
* Dassault Mystère IVA, F-TENN
* Dassault MD.450 Ouragan, F-TEUU 
* Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle, F-BJTR 
* Lockheed L-749 Constellation, F-ZVMV

==Reception==
Janet Maslin in her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, decried the &quot;wise-guy&quot; attitude in &quot;Enigma&quot;, writing: &quot;There are plenty of mysteries about &quot;Enigma&quot; but they aren&#x27;t necessarily the ones the film makers intended. As directed by Jeannot Szwarc, best known for &quot;Jaws 2&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, this is the spy film at its most absurdly hard-boiled and at its most icily perfunctory. It is punctuated by crisp titles (indicating the date of each scene), played very close to the vest and riddled with false alarms ...&quot;

Film historian and critic Leonard Maltin in &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide 2013&quot; (2012) noted a &quot;fine cast does its best with so-so material&quot;.

<text>An eye examination, commonly known as an eye test, is a series of tests performed to assess vision and ability to focus on and discern objects. It also includes other tests and examinations of the eyes. Eye examinations are primarily performed by an optometrist, ophthalmologist, or an orthoptist.
Health care professionals often recommend that all people should have periodic and thorough eye examinations as part of routine primary care, especially since many eye diseases are asymptomatic. Typically, a healthy individual who otherwise has no concerns with their eyes receives an eye exam once in their 20s and twice in their 30s.

Eye examinations may detect potentially treatable blinding eye diseases, ocular manifestations of systemic disease, or signs of tumors or other anomalies of the brain.

A full eye examination consists of a comprehensive evaluation of medical history, followed by 8 steps of visual acuity, pupil function, extraocular muscle motility and alignment, intraocular pressure, confrontational visual fields, external examination, slit-lamp examination and fundoscopic examination through a dilated pupil.

A minimal eye examination consists of tests for visual acuity, pupil function, and extraocular muscle motility, as well as direct ophthalmoscopy through an undilated pupil.
== Medical history ==
Collecting medical history is the first and an essential step in eye examination. Many eye conditions are associated with systemic health, and many diseases can have manifestations in the eye. Certain systematic medications can carry ocular side effects and warrant routine eye exams. Personal and family history of eye diseases can help providers identify individuals at higher risk, allowing for early interventions.

=== Common chief complaints ===
Common chief complaints for an eye exam include vision loss (transient or persistent), blurry vision, double vision, seeing flashes of light, and seeing floaters.

=== Medical conditions ===

==== Diabetes Mellitus ====
Diabetes mellitus, or diabetes, can lead to changes in the eye. Individuals with diabetes can develop early cataract and diabetic retinopathy in the long term.

==== Hypertension ====
Longstanding hypertension can contribute to microvascular damage of the blood vessels in the retina, leading to hypertensive retinopathy.

Malignant hypertension can lead to papilledema, which is the swelling of the optic nerve. This is a medical emergency and can lead to blindness.

==== Autoimmune disorders ====
Autoimmune disorders can affect the eyes in different ways. Most commonly, Grave&#x27;s disease can lead to Grave&#x27;s ophthalmolopathy or Thyroid Eye Disease (TED). Sjogren&#x27;s disease manifest as dry eye.

=== Medication use ===

==== Hydroxychloroquine ====
Hydroxychloroquine, also known as Plaquenil, is an antimalaria medication commonly used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Individuals who are on long-term hydroxychloroquine for more than 5 years are recommended to have a comprehensive eye exam annually. Patients usually receive a baseline exam before starting the medication to document their baseline eye condition as well.

==== Corticosteroids ====
Corticoteroids can have ocular side effects. It can increase the intraocular pressure, which can lead to glaucoma.

=== Personal history of eye conditions ===
Collecting one&#x27;s personal history of eye conditions provides valuable information for the eye examination. History of trauma to the eye, such as open globe injury, and prior surgeries, such as refractive surgeries, cataract surgeries, and minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures are usually gathered during an eye examination.
=== Family history of eye conditions ===
A family history of glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and other inherited eye diseases are often collected, as these diseases have a genetic component.

==The 8-Point eye exam==

===Visual acuity===

Visual acuity is the eyes ability to detect fine details and is the quantitative measure of the eye&#x27;s ability to see an in-focus image at a certain distance. The standard definition of normal visual acuity (20/20 or 6/6 vision) is the ability to resolve a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc. The terms 20/20 and 6/6 are derived from standardized sized objects that can be seen by a &quot;person of normal vision&quot; at the specified distance. For example, if one can see at a distance of 20 ft an object that normally can be seen at 20 ft, then one has 20/20 vision. If one can see at 20 ft what a normal person can see at 40 ft, then one has 20/40 vision. Put another way, suppose you have trouble seeing objects at a distance and you can only see out to 20 ft what a person with normal vision can see out to 200 feet, then you have 20/200 vision. The 6/6 terminology is used in countries using the metric system, and that represents the distance in meters.

This is often measured with a Snellen chart or LogMAR chart.

==== Measuring visual acuity ====
Visual acuity is usually measured with a Snellen or LogMAR chart with a lit background to give the reader the best chance of detecting the optotypes (letters or non-letter symbols). Distance visual acuity and near visual acuity are often measured separated. Usually, one eye is measured at a time, first without corrections (glasses or pinhole), then with corrections.

Best corrected visual acuity refers to the best visual acuity one can achieve with corrective lenses. When corrective lenses are not available, a pinhole is often used to simulate the effect of glasses. Any improvement from corrective lenses or/and pinholes are often documented to indicate the individual&#x27;s refractive potential.

The visual acuity is assigned in the form of a fraction. Visual acuity is recorded as &quot;20/20&quot; (or another fraction like 20/40) when all optotypes (letters or symbols) on a specific line of the eye chart are correctly identified. When an individual correctly identifies additional 2 letters in the next 20/30 lines, then they will be assigned 20/40+2. Alternatively, if an individual correctly identifies all optotypes on the 20/40 lines except 2, they will be assigned 20/40-2.

When an individual cannot read the chart, visual acuity is assessed using alternative methods that do not involve the chart. CF is used when an individual can see and count fingers at a certain distance. For example, CF@2 ft&#x27; refers to &quot;count fingers at 2 feet&quot;. HM (hand motion) is used when an individual can only see the direction of hand movement close to the face. LP (light perception) is used when an individual can only detect light but not shapes, motions or colors. NLP (no light perception) is assigned when an individual cannot detect any light.

===Pupil function===
An examination of pupilary function includes inspecting the pupils for equal size (1 mm or less of difference may be normal), regular shape, reactivity to light, and direct and consensual accommodation. These steps can be easily remembered with the mnemonic &quot;PERRLA (D+C)&quot;: Pupils Equal and Round; Reactive to Light and Accommodation (Direct and Consensual).

A swinging-flashlight test may also be desirable if neurologic damage is suspected.
The swinging-flashlight test is the most useful clinical test available to a general physician for the assessment of optic nerve anomalies.
This test detects the afferent pupil defect, also referred to as the Marcus Gunn pupil. It is conducted in a semidarkened room.
In a normal reaction to the swinging-flashlight test, both pupils constrict when one is exposed to light.
As the light is being moved from one eye to another, both eyes begin to dilate, but constrict again when light has reached the other eye.

If there is an efferent defect in the left eye, the left pupil will remain dilated regardless of where the light is shining, while the right pupil will respond normally.
If there is an afferent defect in the left eye, both pupils will dilate when the light is shining on the left eye, but both will constrict when it is shining on the right eye. This is because the left eye will not respond to external stimulus (afferent pathway), but can still receive neural signals from the brain (efferent pathway) to constrict.

If there is a unilateral small pupil with normal reactivity to light, it is unlikely that a neuropathy is present.
However, if accompanied by ptosis of the upper eyelid, this may indicate Horner&#x27;s syndrome.

If there is a small, irregular pupil that constricts poorly to light, but normally to accommodation, this is an Argyll Robertson pupil.

=== Extraocular motility and alignment ===
Ocular motility should always be tested, especially when patients complain of double vision or physicians suspect neurologic disease. First, the doctor should visually assess the eyes for deviations that could result from strabismus, extraocular muscle dysfunction, or palsy of the cranial nerves innervating the extraocular muscles. Saccades are assessed by having the patient move his or her eye quickly to a target at the far right, left, top and bottom. This tests for saccadic dysfunction whereupon poor ability of the eyes to &quot;jump&quot; from one place to another may impinge on reading ability and other skills, whereby the eyes are required to fixate and follow a desired object.

The patient is asked to follow a target with both eyes as it is moved in each of the nine cardinal directions of gaze. The examiner notes the speed, smoothness, range and symmetry of movements and observes for unsteadiness of fixation. These nine fields of gaze test the extraocular muscles: inferior, superior, lateral and medial rectus muscles, as well as the superior and inferior oblique muscles.

===Intraocular pressure===

Intraocular pressure (IOP) can be measured by tonometry devices. The eye can be thought of as an enclosed compartment through which there is a constant circulation of fluid that maintains its shape and internal pressure. Tonometry is a method of measuring this pressure using various instruments. The normal range is 10-21 mmHg.

===Confrontational visual fields===
Testing the visual fields consists of confrontation field testing in which each eye is tested separately to assess the extent of the peripheral field.

To perform the test, the individual occludes one eye while fixated on the examiner&#x27;s eye with the non-occluded eye. The patient is then asked to count the number of fingers that are briefly flashed in each of the four quadrants. This method is preferred to the &quot;wiggly finger test&quot; that was historically used because it represents a rapid and efficient way of answering the same question: is the peripheral visual field affected?

Common problems of the visual field include scotoma (area of reduced vision), hemianopia (half of visual field lost), homonymous hemianopsia and bitemporal hemianopia.

===External examination===

External examination of eyes consists of inspection of the eyelids, surrounding tissues and palpebral fissure. Palpation of the orbital rim may also be performed depending on the presenting signs and symptoms, especially when a fracture is suspected or there was a history of trauma to the head. The general contour and shape of the eyes are observed and compared between two eyes. The position of the eyelids are checked for abnormalities such as ptosis which is an asymmetry between eyelid positions. Any asymmetry, discharge, pus, changes in color and structure around the eyelid will be noted.

The white part of the eye, the conjunctiva and sclera, is examined next. The conjunctiva and sclera can be inspected by having the individual look up, and shining a light while retracting the upper or lower eyelid. Any changes in color of the conjunctiva or the shapes of the blood vessels will be observed. The conjunctiva that lines the inner side of the eyelids can be observed with gentle pulling and inversion of the eyelids.

===Slit-lamp examination===
Close inspection of the anterior eye structures and ocular adnexa are often done with a slit lamp which is a table mounted microscope with a special adjustable illumination source attached. A small beam of light that can be adjusted to vary in width, height, incident angle, orientation and color, is passed over the eye. Often, this light beam is narrowed into a vertical &quot;slit&quot;, during slit-lamp examination. The examiner views the illuminated ocular structures, through an optical system that magnifies the image of the eye and the patient is seated while being examined, and the head stabilized by an adjustable chin rest and a bar around the forehead.

The slit lamp also allows inspection of all the ocular media, from cornea to vitreous, plus magnified view of eyelids, and other external ocular related structures. Fluorescein staining of the tear film before slit lamp examination may reveal etiologies of the surface of the eye, such as corneal abrasions or keratitis due to herpes simplex viral infection.

The binocular slit-lamp examination provides stereoscopic, dimensional and magnified view of the eye structures in striking detail, enabling exact anatomical diagnoses to be made for a variety of eye conditions. Specifically, it allows for assessment of height of elevation and indentation of the structures.

Also ophthalmoscopy and gonioscopy examinations can also be performed through the slit lamp when combined with special lenses. These exams help to see the specific structures, such as the retina and optic nerve, which is at the back of the eye, and the drainage system that controls the intraocular pressure, which is in the angle formed between the cornea and the iris.

These lenses include the Goldmann 3-mirror lens, gonioscopy single-mirror/Zeiss 4-mirror lens for (ocular) anterior chamber angle structures and +90D lens, +78D lens and +66D lens the examination of retinal structures is accomplished.

===Fundoscopic examination===

Examination of retina (fundus examination) is an important part of the general eye examination. Dilating the pupil using dilating eye drops greatly enhances the view and permits an extensive examination of peripheral retina. A limited view can be obtained through an undilated pupil, in which case best results are obtained with the room darkened and the patient looking towards the far corner. The appearance of the optic disc and retinal vasculature are also recorded during fundus examination.

Findings that can be identified with fundoscopic examination include different types of retinal hemorrhages and vitreous hemorrhages, neovascularization, cotton wool spots, drusen, changes in the caliber or shape of the retinal blood vessels, changes in optic nerve color and shape, changes in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), uveal nevus and melanoma, retinal holes, tears or detachments.

===Refraction===

In physics, &quot;refraction&quot; is the mechanism that bends the path of light as it passes from one medium to another, as when it passes from the air through the parts of the eye. In an eye exam, the term refraction is the determination of the ideal correction of refractive error. Refractive error is an optical abnormality in which the shape of the eye fails to bring light into sharp focus on the retina, resulting in blurred or distorted vision. Examples of refractive error are myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia and astigmatism. The errors are specified in diopters, in a similar format to an eyeglass prescription. A refraction procedure consists of two parts: objective and subjective.

====Objective refraction====
An objective refraction is a refraction obtained without receiving any feedback from the patient, using a retinoscope or auto-refractor.

To perform a retinoscopy, the doctor projects a streak of light into a pupil. A series of lenses are flashed in front of the eye. By looking through the retinoscope, the doctor can study the light reflex of the pupil. Based on the movement and orientation of this retinal reflection, the refractive state of the eye is measured.

An auto-refractor is a computerized instrument that shines light into an eye. The light travels through the front of the eye, to the back and then forward through the front again. The information bounced back to the instrument gives an objective measurement of refractive error without asking the patients any questions.

====Subjective refraction====

A subjective refraction requires responses from the patient. Typically, the patient will sit behind a phoropter or wear a trial frame and look at an eye chart. The eye care professional will change lenses and other settings while asking the patient for feedback on which set of lenses give the best vision.

== Eye exams for children ==

The eye exam for children can be different from that for adults, especially for children at a young age who are unable to read the letters in the Snellen chart or cooperate with the more complex components of the assessment.

It is often recommended that children should have their first eye exam at six months old, or earlier if a parent suspects something is wrong with the eyes. Across the world, screening programs are important for identifying children who have a need for spectacles but either do not wear any or have the wrong prescription. Often, children who are suspected of having amblyopia are too young to be able to verbally recognize letters on the Snellen chart, making the eye examination challenging.

It is critical to identify eye conditions early in children, as early detection and intervention can save vision and lives. Retinoblastoma is a rare but life-threatening eye cancer that primarily affects children under the age of 5. Amblyopia, often also called lazy eye, is a common condition in children where the neurological connection between the eye and brain fails to fully establish, resulting the brain&#x27;s inability to process the visual information from the eye, despite normal structure and function of the eye. The treatment of amblyopia usually involves patching of the good eye. However, this intervention needs to happen in a critical period of time, usually before the age of 12, ideally before the age of 7 or 8, in order for affected children to achieve full visual potential in adulthood. Refractive errors, congenital or early childhood cataract, and strabismus, can all contribute to the development of amblyopia. Thus, it is crucial to address all these ophthalmic conditions in childhood urgently.

=== Visual acuity in infant and toddlers ===
The information about the mother&#x27;s pregnancy, the child&#x27;s birth and in the neonatal period is often critical. Specific details that might be collected include maternal health, gestation age at birth, and neonatal history. The examination begins as soon as the infant or toddler enters the room. Close attention is paid to the infant&#x27;s visual behaviors, such as tracking and following moving items or people, head position, and abnormal facial features.

Visual acuity is often assessed qualitatively documented based on their ability to fix and follow (F&amp;F). The fixation behavior can be further characterized as central, steady, and maintained (CSM).

In infants born prematurely, with history of oxygen use in the neonatal period, and with low birth weight, there is an increased risk of developing retinopathy of prematurity. Screening of ROP is often initiated promptly while the infants are still in the hospital, and they are often followed up closely in the first few weeks to months of life to monitor the normal development of blood vessels in the premature retina.

=== Visual acuity in preschool children ===

For preschool children, depending on their level of literacy, different types of optotypes (eg. LEA symbols, tumbling E chart) can be used for the assessment of visual acuity. For children who know some letters, the HOTV chart, which only has these 4 letters H, O, T, and V, can be used to reduce confusion. Sometimes, crowded visual acuity test is used to diagnose subtle amblyopia as well.

=== Red reflex ===
Red reflex examination, also called Bruckner Test, is a useful test in children to look for misalignment of the eyes and significant refractive errors. A red reflex can be seen when looking at a patient&#x27;s pupil through a direct ophthalmoscope. This part of the examination is done from a distance of about 1m and is usually symmetrical between the two eyes. An opacity may indicate a cataract.

=== Visual field ===
Visual field testing in young children is often done after they are able to fixate reliably (usually around 4 months). An object is presented from far peripheral and slowly moves into the center of the vision, while the child maintains fixation on a central target. The point at which the peripheral object captures the child’s attention and prompts a shift in gaze or fixation marks the boundary of their visual field.

=== Cycloplegic refraction ===
Young children have the greatest ability to accommodate, but this strong accommodative ability interferes with the accurate measurement of refractive errors. Accommodation is the ability of eyes to adjust to various different distances of focus. This is accomplished by the ciliary muscles that change the shape of the lens of the eye. Therefore, to achieve the most accurate measure of refractive errors, cycloplegic refraction, which paralyzes the ciliary muscle and prevents accommodation, is often performed. This involves using cycloplegic eye drops, such as cyclopentolate and tropicamide. Often, the effect of the medications could last for several hours to a day.

Retinoscopy is often used in children to measure their refractive errors. This method is a type of objective refraction. It involves the provider shining a narrow beam of light into the eye to see the red reflex of the retina while adjusting differently powered lenses in front of the eye to look for a neutralized point of the reflex. The main advantage of this method is that it does not require verbal feedback from the children and is easy for cooperation.

Children need the following basic visual skills for learning:
* Near vision
* Distance vision: Tumbling E chart, Landolt C chart
* Eye teaming (binocularity)
* Eye movement
* Accommodation (focusing skills)
* Peripheral vision
* Eye–hand coordination

<text>Skiddaw Little Man, also called Little Man, is a fell in the English Lake District; it is situated four kilometres north of the town of Keswick and reaches a height of .

==Topography==
Little Man is often overlooked and disregarded as an independent and distinct fell owing to its name making it sound like a minor top of its parent fell Skiddaw, which in fact lies northwest. With a topographical prominence of , Little Man qualifies comfortably as a Hewitt and Nuttall hill and is regarded as a separate fell by renowned mountain writers Alfred Wainwright and Bill Birkett. The fell is actually called Little Man on Ordnance Survey maps and by many guide books.

To the north and east Little Man is connected to the Skiddaw massif, Lonscale Fell being the nearest separate fell to the east, away. To the south and the west the fell falls away steeply, with fast flowing streams draining the fell into the River Derwent. southeast of the main summit lies an lower top called Lesser Man, which is adorned with an unusual cairn consisting of rocks and old fence posts. A further southeast of Lesser Man, on the other side of the bridleway from Keswick to Skiddaw, stands Jenkin Hill (), this flat-topped height being regarded as an outlier of Little Man.

==Geology==
Geologically, Little Man consists of Skiddaw slate and the summit of the fell is made up of grassy patches within large areas of slate.

==Summit==
Little Man has one big advantage over Skiddaw in that its convex southern slopes make it a far better viewpoint than its higher neighbour. In fact the panorama from Little Man is regarded as one of the best in the national park, taking in the valleys and lakes of northern Lakeland as well as all of the best-known fells of the district.

==Ascents==
Many people climb Little Man via the tourist path from Keswick on the way to the summit of Skiddaw. However, there are several better and more interesting but steep ascents from the hamlets of Millbeck and Applethwaite to the south of the fell. One of the routes from Millbeck is a scrambler&#x27;s route up the steep south west Arête.

<text>Peter Joseph Kentenich, SAC (16 November 1885 – 15 September 1968) was a German Pallottine priest and founder of the Schoenstatt Apostolic Movement. Kentenich was a theologian, educator, and founder of a Catholic movement, whose teachings underwent a series of challenges from political and ecclesiastical powers. The process for his beatification was opened in 1975.

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===
Kentenich was born on November 16, 1885, in Gymnich, Erftstadt near Cologne, and baptized &quot;Peter Josef Kentenich&quot; on 19 November at the parish church of St.Kuniberts. His father was Matthias Köp, a manager on a farm in Oberbolheim, where his mother Katharina Kentenich was one of the domestic staff. Because his parents never married, Joseph was born at the house of his maternal grandparents, Anna Maria and Matthias Kentenich, where he spent the first years of his life. In 1894 Kentenich was sent to St. Vincent orphanage in Oberhausen.

=== Entrance into the seminary ===
In 1897, Kentenich expressed the wish to become a priest for the first time. Two years later, he entered the Pallottines minor seminary in Ehrenbreitstein. In 1904, he entered the novitiate of the Pallottines in Limburg an der Lahn. However, he faced difficulties because of his intellectualist character. He was obsessed by the philosophical question: &quot;Is there a truth, and how to know it?&quot;. He strove for perfection, but felt an incapacity to love God and his neighbor. He later noted that his devotion to Mary allowed him to overcome this crisis and discover the personal love of God.

=== Priesthood ===

Admitted to the religious profession in 1909, Kentenich was ordained as a priest in Limburg an der Lahn on 8 July 1910. Although he wished to become a missionary in Africa with the Pallottines, his poor health prevented him from doing so and he taught at the minor seminary of the Pallottine Fathers in Vallendar-Schoenstatt, near Koblenz.

=== Chaplain ===
During his time at Vallendar-Schoenstatt students began to protest against the internal regulations that they considered too severe; some protesters spread graffiti on the walls. Two priests in charge of their spiritual direction resigned. Kentenich was named as a replacement.

In his first talk, he said to his students: &quot;I am at your disposal with all that I am and all that I have: my knowledge and my ignorance, my competence and my incompetence, but especially my heart... We will learn to educate ourselves under the protection of Mary, to become strong, free and priestly men.&quot;

== Founding the Schoenstatt Movement ==

=== Beginning the &quot;Covenant of Love&quot; with Mary ===
 Kentenich interpreted the ideas of his order&#x27;s founder, Vincent Pallotti, as a call for a worldwide effort to involve lay people in apostolic work, and to unite the various factions in the church.

On 18 October 1914, Kentenich brought together several of his students to found a Marian Congregation. In an old chapel of St. Michael, formerly abandoned and used for the storage of the gardening tools, he gathered about twenty seminarians and they sealed what he called the &quot;Covenant of Love&quot; with the Mother of God. This &quot;Covenant&quot; is conceived not as a symbol, but a bilateral contract between the two contracting parties. The Virgin Mary was requested to establish her throne in the chapel to spread her treasures. Each group member agreed to give their life entirely to the Mother of God, and to let themselves be guided by her through their existence. This was the first milestone of the foundation of the Schoenstatt Movement. The speech Kentenich delivered on this occasion is considered the Schoenstatt Movement&#x27;s Foundation Act. The organisation was named after its place of origin, a word meaning &quot;Beautiful Place&quot;.
In 1915, a teacher gave Kentenich a picture of the Virgin and Child. The tenderness of Mary&#x27;s gesture impressed him and he placed the icon above the altar. Venerated under the name Mater ter admirabilis (Mother Thrice Admirable), the picture appears in every Schoenstatt site.

Several of the seminarians died during World War I. The Servant of God Joseph Engling was killed on 4 October 1918 by a shell in Northern France, next to Thun-Saint-Martin. His process of beatification is underway.

=== Between WWI and WWII ===
The movement, initially purely local, expanded rapidly after the World War I. It gradually encompassed many categories; young people, priests, women, sisters, and pilgrims. 

Father Kentenich traveled through all of Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Switzerland, to preach retreats and lead training sessions. From 1928 to 1935, he preached every year for more than 2,000 priests, and many other lay retreatants.

In 1926, Kentenich founded the Schoenstatt Sisters of Mary.

== During Hitler&#x27;s reign ==
Kentenich observed the rise of Nazism with concern, ranking it among the products of what he called &quot;the idealistic and mechanistic thinking&quot; that engulfed Europe since the nineteenth century. In 1933, when the Nazis took power in Germany and closed several religious houses, Kentenich quickly sent groups of the Schoenstatt Sisters of Mary to South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay to allow the movement to survive in case the persecution of the Church in Germany intensified.

His opposition to Nazism attracted persecutory reactions towards him. Father Kentenich said about the swastika: &quot;We, it is the Cross of the Christ that we follow.&quot; About Nazism, he said, &quot;I see no place where the water of baptism could run there&quot;.

=== Arrest by the Gestapo ===

Once in power, the Nazis classified Schoenstatt as one of their main opposition groups. On 20 September 1941, Kentenich was summoned by the Gestapo. During the interview, the officers quoted some of his private words which had been reported by an informer: &quot;My mission is to reveal the inner emptiness of National Socialism, and by there to defeat it.&quot; The police imprisoned him for a month in what had previously been a Reichsbank vault. He was then transferred to a prison in Koblenz, a former Carmelite convent. He spent 5 months there, after which he was sent on to Dachau concentration camp, where he was held until the end of the war.

===At Dachau concentration camp ===
When Kentenich was sent to Dachau in March 1942, there were 12,000 prisoners, including 2,600 priests. He was inmate number 29392. The Germans were grouped in a block where they had the right to attend daily Mass. On 19 March 1943 Kentenich celebrated his first Mass at the camp and later gave nightly talks to his fellow prisoners.

Kentenich came under the protection of the &quot;kapo&quot; (inmate block chief), a communist named Guttmann, after Guttman saw Kentenich sharing his daily bread and soup with another detainee. 
Guttmann later saved his life; due to poor health, the priest was due to be sent to the gas chamber but Guttmann hid him from the S.S. physician.

=== Foundation of Schoenstatt International at Dachau ===
Kentenich restarted his apostleship each time he was transferred into a new block.On 16 July 1942 two new Schoenstatt branches were created at Dachau under the responsibility of two lay deportees: the Secular Institute of the Families and the Institute of the Brothers of Mary.

During the winter of 1944, epidemics and the tightening of the Nazi regime caused the death of 10,000 prisoners in Dachau. At this point Kentenich formed the International Movement. He wrote treaties on spirituality and prayers, as well as a didactic poem of over 20,000 verses. In December, Bishop Gabriel Piguet, a French prisoner, secretly ordained a seminarian from Schoenstatt (now Blessed Karl Leisner). Suffering from tuberculosis, Leisner would celebrate only one Mass before dying a few weeks after the camp was liberated; he was beatified by John Paul II on 23 June 1996.

On 6 April 1945, upon the arrival of American troops, the prisoners are released. On 20 May, at the feast of Pentecost, Father Kentenich returned to Schoenstatt. He immediately restarted his work, in order to establish a barrier against those whom he considered the biggest dangers to the world: communism in the East, and practical materialism in the West. The experience of deportation helped him teach his disciples on how to maintain inner freedom. Schoenstatt priests Albert Eise (who died of illness while in Dachau) and Franz Reinisch, (who was executed by the Nazis) were invoked as heavenly protectors by all members of the Movement.

== International development of Schoenstatt ==

In March 1947, Kentenich was received in a private audience by Pope Pius XII. He thanked the Pope for the publication, two days earlier, of the constitution Provida Mater Ecclesia, which created the Secular Institutes.In October 1948, the Holy See erected in a Secular Institute the Schoenstatt Sisters of Mary. At the same time, Kentenich traveled to Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, the United States, and Africa to establish the movement there, with the construction of replicas of the Schoenstatt Shrine, training centers, and religious houses.

== Exile ==
At this time concerns were raised that the role of the founder was deemed too exclusive. The Bishop of Trier, in whose diocese Schoenstatt is located, ordered a canonical visitation. The visitor, auxiliary Bernhard Stein, praised the movement, but made some criticisms pertaining to the perceived lack of autonomy regarding the sisters.

Kentenich responded by writing a long document on the work of Schoenstatt which was presented as a cure for what he saw as the disease of Western thought, idealism. For Kentenich, Schoenstatt was an antidote to this poison, as it is not an abstract theory but a practical application of Christian doctrine. The Apostolic Visitor, sent the file to the Holy Office in Rome. In 1951, Father Tromp, a Dutch Jesuit, was appointed Apostolic Inspector with extensive powers. Puzzled by the unconventional terminology used by Kentenich, he accused him of being an agitator, an innovator, and a sectarian. After being stripped of all his functions in the movement, Kentenich was assigned a residence in the convent of Pallottines in Milwaukee; all further correspondence with the leaders of the work was prohibited.

His exile lasted fourteen years. He accepted the transfer and wrote: &quot;God does not speak clearly by events? The Church wants to test our obedience, to recognize that if the work and the holder of the work are marked by God.&quot; More than three decades later, when witnesses were examined for the cause of Kentenich&#x27;s beatification, a 78-year-old priest still in office declared, &quot;Kentenich never received any official act of indictment. There was no official lawyer and he was never brought before a judge, much less faced a complainant or a witness.&quot;

In 1959, Kentenich was appointed as parish priest of the German-speaking Catholic community of Milwaukee.

In 1953, it was suggested to Pope Pius XII that he dissolve Schoenstatt; he declined. The question was raised if the movement should be integrated into the Congregation of the Pallottines, or retain its autonomy. The superiors of the Order advocated for the first option, but other Pallottines agreed with Father Kentenich that Schoenstatt should be fully autonomous. In 1962, under the intervention of several bishops, John XXIII entrusted the case to the Congregation for Religious.
== Return from exile ==
In December 1963, Pope Paul VI appointed Bishop Höffner, from Münster, as moderator and protector of Schoenstatt. A new apostolic visitor was appointed, who delivered a favorable report. In 1964, under the unanimous opinion of the German bishops, a papal decree declared the separation of Schoenstatt from the Pallottines.

In October 1965, Kentenich was reinstated at the direction of the Movement. Now in his eighties, he was received by Paul VI a few days after the closing of the Second Vatican Council. He predicted that the council &quot;will bear fruit, but will have first negative effects, because of the uncertainty of large sections of the hierarchy, clergy and laity about the image of the Church... This uncertainty can be overcome by turning our eyes to Mary, the first image and Mother of the Church.

=== His last actions in Schoenstatt: a father to many ===
On Christmas of 1965, Kentenich was welcomed at Schoenstatt. His work now included five secular institutes: the Schoenstatt Fathers, the Diocesan Priests, the Brothers of Mary, the Sisters of Mary, the Ladies of Schoenstatt, and the Families. This also encompassed the several Federations and Leagues gathering priests, lay people, and families.

Kentenich stressed the fatherhood of God and that of the priesthood in the Church, especially the episcopate. The fatherhood, with the motherly presence of Mary were both essential points of the movement; the practical way to live this was by the covenant of love with the Mother Thrice Admirable.
==Death==
In a speech at the annual conference of German Catholics in 1967, Kentenich said: &quot;We are living in apocalyptic times... Heavenly and devilish powers clash in this earth... This confrontation is to challenge the domination of the world; today this is clearly visible.&quot; The solution is to appeal to the Virgin Mary, &quot;favorite weapon in the hands of the living God&quot;.

During the last year of his life he often returned to this theme: &quot;The task of Mary is to bring Christ to the world and the world to Christ... We are convinced that the great crises of the present times cannot be overcome without Mary&quot; (12 September 1968).

On 15 September 1968, on the Feast of Our Lady of Sorrows, Kentenich celebrated Mass at the recently inaugurated Church of the Adoration. Six hundred Sisters of Mary attended the ceremony. Just after Mass, he went into the sacristy for the thanksgiving prayer and suffered a heart attack; after receiving the last sacraments he died minutes later.

He is buried in the Church of the Adoration. On his tomb, according to his wish, is the inscription: &quot;Dilexit Ecclesiam&quot; (&quot;He loved the Church&quot;; Eph 5:25). This was influenced by the same inscription engraved on the tomb of Cardinal Gaspard Mermillod, Bishop of Geneva (Switzerland) who was exiled from his own country for 11 years in the 19th century, for refusing to adhere to a national church separated from Rome.

== Beatification process ==
The process for his beatification was opened on 10 February 1975 in the Diocese of Trier. Life-size sculptures of Kentenich, created by American artist Gwendolyn Gillen, now stand outside Schoenstatt chapels in Lamar, Texas, Pewaukee, Wisconsin, Rome, Puerto Rico and many other countries.

On 3 May 2022 the Bishop of Trier announced that the process had been suspended because of allegations of abuse.

== Investigations into accusations of sexual abuse ==

In July 2020, Alexandra von Teuffenbach, a former professor at the Pontifical Lateran University and the Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum, alleged that Kentenich manipulated and coerced community members, specifically from the Schoenstatt Sisters of Mary, into sexually inappropriate conduct. Von Teuffenbach cited particular accusations found in documents of the archives of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith after Pope Francis had allowed the consultation of documents concerning the pontificate of Pius XII. She also claimed that these accusations were the reason for Kentenich&#x27;s investigation by Fr. Sebastiaan Tromp (Apostolic Visitator from the Holy See), in the 1950s and eventual separation from the Schoenstatt Movement during his exile from 1951 to 1965.

The possibility of sexual or psychological abuse was strongly denied by the General Presidency of the Schoenstatt Movement. In a formal statement the movement indicated that the allegations had long been known about and the fact that Kentenich was reinstated from exile by the Vatican in 1965 was evidence that the allegations were not considered true. It was also stated that at the opening of Kentenich&#x27;s process of beatification in 1975 a &quot;nihil obstat&quot; (&quot;no obstructions&quot;) was granted by the church and that this would not have been granted if the previously known accusations were found to have any substance.

The Schoenstatt Sisters of Mary also released their own formal statement. The Sisters emphatically rejected the accusations and said that &quot;successive generations of our community have experienced the founder as an authentic and credible personality.” As with the statement from Schoenstatt&#x27;s General Presidency, the Sisters noted that they were already aware of the allegations made against Kentenich and emphasized that when he was reinstated as the founder and returned from his exile in 1965, all accusations had already been considered by the Church and deemed insufficiently substantiated to make a formal accusation.

A few days after the reports and responses, the postulator of Kentenich&#x27;s cause and key representatives of Schoenstatt met with Bishop Stephan Ackermann of the Diocese of Trier. The result was an announcement of an independent commission of historians, organized by the diocese, to review the beatification process of Kentenich. It will also be the task of the commission &quot;to reconcile the newly found material with what has already been gathered and evaluated from other archives by the previous commission.&quot; At the end of their work, the commission &quot;will write a report in which a statement will also be made about the personality and spirituality of Fr. Josef Kentenich as depicted in the collected documents.&quot;

Reacting to the announcement, Fr. Juan Pablo Catoggio (international president of the Schoenstatt Movement) issued a statement addressed to the “Schoenstatt Family throughout the world”, saying that “we very much welcome this decision of the bishop,&quot; since in this way &quot;the clarification of the questions regarding the person and actions of Father Kentenich” can be found.

Fr. Eduardo Aguirre, postulator for the cause of beatification of Kentenich, pointed out that Kentenich was not formally accused by the Holy Office (at that time the highest tribunal of the Church), at any time before, during, or after the exile for immoral conduct of any form, including the mention of sexual misconduct or deviance of any kind. Aguirre claims that &quot;any assertion to the contrary is simple false.&quot;

On 3 May 2022, the Bishop of Trier announced that Kentenich&#x27;s sainthood process had been suspended because of the allegations of abuse.

<text>Mehmed Fuad Pasha (1814 – February 12, 1869), sometimes known as Keçecizade Mehmed Fuad Pasha and commonly known as Fuad Pasha, was an Ottoman administrator and statesman, who is known for his prominent role in the Tanzimat reforms of the mid-19th-century Ottoman Empire, as well as his leadership during the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war in Syria. He represented a modern Ottoman era, given his openness to European-style modernization as well as the reforms he helped to enact.

Among other posts, he served as Grand Vizier, the equivalent of Prime Minister, on two occasions between 1861 and 1866. He is often regarded, along with Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha, as one of the most influential Ottoman statesmen, who favoured a French-inspired civil code for the newly established civil courts in 1868.

Fuad Pasha was a fervent supporter of keeping the empire an absolute monarchy, rejecting the ideas of being legally bounded or restricted by a constitution or legislature. He often clashed with liberal intellectuals like Namık Kemal, Ziya Pasha and İbrahim Şinasi.

==Early life==
Fuad Pasha was born in 1814 to a prominent ulema family. His father, , was a famous poet, and Fuad continued this trend as both a littérateur and a poet. He received a medrese education but had to leave his education when his father was dismissed and banished to the provinces. His mother was a descendant of Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Pasha a 17th-century grand vizier. He studied in the medical school &quot;Tibhane-i Amire&quot; for four years with no family support and then proceeded to serve as a doctor for the Admiralty.

==Career beginnings==
Fuad Pasha was fluent in French, which led him to a job as scribe to the governor of Tunisia, Tahir Pasha, from 1832 to 1836. Upon the governor&#x27;s death, Fuad Pasha entered the service of the Grand Vizier, Mustafa Reşid Pasha, and began working with Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha. His title, &quot;Pasha&quot;, was given to a high-ranking member of the Ottoman government and could only be given by the Sultan as an honorary title. Mehmed Emin Aali had been in the Grand Vizier&#x27;s service for a considerable amount of time. While Mustafa Reşid and Mehmed Emin Aali were on a diplomatic trip to London, Fuad secured a position as the First Translator of the Porte, a position which he held from 1838 to 1852.

Fuad continued to study history, modern languages, international law, and political economics with the hope of rising to a diplomatic career. His translator position led him to become a prótege of Mustafa Reşid&#x27;s while he was in power for the first two years after the Edict of Gülhane from 1839 to 1841 and again from 1846 to 1852. The Edict was launched by Sultan Abdülmecid I at the recommendation of Mustafa Reşid and effectively began the Tanzimat reforms. Although Mehmed Emin Aali and Fuad were the same age, Fuad was somewhat slower in rising to position. This changed, however, in 1848 when Fuad demonstrated his skills in his negotiations with Russian officials in Bucharest and St. Petersburg regarding refugees flooding into the Empire as a result of the 1848 revolutions in Europe. Czar Nicholas I of Russia demanded the extradition of the men who had started the revolutions who were now seeking refuge in the Empire. Mustafa Reşid had previously refused the Czar&#x27;s demands and the threat of war was growing. Fuad, however, traveled to St. Petersburg and, through his negotiations, the Czar relinquished his demands for extradition and settled for Fuad&#x27;s promise that the revolutionaries would be kept far from the Russian borders. Fuad demonstrated this same talent for negotiations in 1852 when he worked with Muhammad Ali of Egypt&#x27;s successor, Prince Abbas, in Egypt.

Because of these diplomatic successes, Fuad became Mehmed Emin Aali&#x27;s equal, both in political rank and influence with Mustafa Reşid. Mustafa Reşid was removed as Grand Vizier in 1852 by the sultan and Mehmed Emin Aali was then named as his successor. Mehmed Emin Aali recommended to the Sultan that Fuad succeed him as Foreign Minister, and in 1852, this recommendation was accepted. The beginning of Fuad&#x27;s term as Foreign Minister and Mehmed Emin Aali&#x27;s as Grand Vizier marked an important shift in Ottoman foreign policy and sharp division between Mustafa Reşid and his former protégés. While Mustafa Reşid had displayed a preference for Great Britain, Fuad and Mehmed Emin Aali were strong supporters of France. This, however, would ultimately lead to their fall as both men supported France in the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war between the Catholic Maronites (supported by the French), and the Druze Muslims (supported by the British and, subsequently, Mustafa Reşid) over power in Mount Lebanon before the Crimean War. Because of this fall, both Fuad and Mehmed Emin Aali took a step back from their governmental careers and turned to the Council of the Tanzimat, of which Mehmed Emin Aali was chairman and Fuad was a member.

==Tanzimat period==
===Member of the Council of the Tanzimat===
Fuad Pasha was an important reformer during the Tanzimat period. The goal of the program was to, “promote reform, fend off the powers and forestall rebellion”. The Council of the Tanzimat was established to codify the actions enacted by the Tanzimat reforms. These reforms were designed to centralize power through “modernization [and] centralization” to “increase revenue [and] prevent fragmentation”. It was enacted on November 3, 1839 through an imperial decree given by Mustafa Reşid Pasa called the Edict of Gülhane. This period demonstrated the Empire&#x27;s increased efforts towards Westernization and acceptance by the Concert of Europe, as well, as Western schools were opened to train bureaucrats for future governmental positions. Councils of State, Justice, and Education were all established, as well as provincial councils to represent all religious and social groups residing in the Empire. Fuad hoped that the Tanzimat reforms would, “find salvation for the empire by creating among its peoples the bond of equal citizenship based on Ottoman nationality”. He realized the importance of change and saw it as a necessary evolution that the Ottoman Empire needed to make. However, in his efforts to create an image of a modern Ottoman Empire, Fuad Pasha believed that by giving non-Muslim subjects of the Empire equal rights via the Millet system would “dull their nationalist and separatist tendencies.” He, along with the other three reformers, believed that in order to save the empire, a sense of “Ottomanism” needed to be created. The goal was to create an “Ottoman” nation and unify the Jews, Christians, and Muslims into an Ottoman nationality. The Council of the Tanzimat took complete charge of preparing legislation, and because both Fuad and Ali wanted immediate progress, the Council was made separate from the ministries and the chairman was “given direct access to the sultan,” which represented increasing efforts towards centralization. The old Supreme Council, however, still remained an influential factor as its existence and functions, though de jure limited to judicial matters, caused much confusion.

===Chairman of the Council of the Tanzimat===
In 1856, Fuat was given the task of reforming the financial and provincial problems that plagued the Empire and was thus named chairman of the Council of the Tanzimat. These stemmed from “a shortage of trained bureaucrats and inadequacies in tax collection.” Though reforms had been started by Resid in 1841, their initial success was interrupted by the outbreak of the Crimean War. Two years of study resulted in the Provincial Regulation of 1858. The main idea behind the Regulation was concentrating power back into the offices of the provincial governors and spreading the Tanzimat reforms across the entire Empire. It kept the provincial government structure that was already in place, but ensured that the governors of each province were the main source of authority as well as the chief representative of the central government in Istanbul through whom, all communications with the central government were made. In addition to administration councils’ structures being reformed, a Cadastral Department in each province was responsible for registering every male resident, whether they be Muslim or non-Muslim, Ottoman or foreign resident. Each of these residents was issued a “population tax certificate&quot; (&quot;vergi nüfus tezkeresi&quot;) which stated his tax obligation and also served as an identity card.” A new conscription system was also introduced that better reflected the needs and population makeup of each province. Fuat also worked on reforming the financial system of the Empire. These reforms included the introduction of an annual budget system and the budgets of each ministry subject to the scrutiny of the treasury to keep in check with annual revenues. To increase these revenues, the inefficient tax farming system was ended in 1861 with the establishment of the Excise Tax Administration which was separate from the bureaucracy of the Ministry of Finance and replaced the former Customs Administration.

==Foreign Minister 1858-1860: The Mount Lebanon Crisis==
In 1860, violence broke out in the Mount Lebanon region of modern-day Lebanon between the Maronite and Druze communities over which group would control the region. Ultimately, the Druzes dominated and pillage nearly every Maronite town nearby. Fuad, as the foreign minister was sent to investigate these massacres and carry out the Empire’s foreign policy initiatives. Due to his success at executing the changes of the Tanzimat program, Fuad was sent to Syria and arrived in Beirut on July 17, 1860, armed with extreme power granted to him by the Sultan. He brought in a nationalistic viewpoint that these conflicts were “local sectarian characteristics that Ottoman reform ultimately would discipline.” He was sent by Sultan Abdulmecid along with the new Western-style army to work with a newly established International Commission (Britain, France, Austria, Russia, and Prussia) to bring stability to the region. Fuad began what some have called a “reign of terror” in which he executed hundreds of the accused pillagers, arrested Druze leaders, and sentenced them to death after a trial in a military court for “failing to protect the Christians”. His rather strict reaction to the Mount Lebanon crisis reflected a push towards modernity and order throughout the Empire, as well as a growing sentiment of nationalism called &quot;Osmanlilik&quot;, as demonstrated in a statement he gave to the people of Syria in 1861, announcing his return to Istanbul. He referred to the power of the Sultan as a “father-figure” who must be obeyed lest they suffer his merciless punishment, but who also treated all of his subjects with equality, regardless of their religion. This strictness also reflects the Empire&#x27;s immense desire to prove to its counterparts in Europe that it was fully capable of acting in accordance with modern law, especially considering the deployment of European troops to Syria in July 1860. Fuad chaired the aforementioned International Commission, called the Beirut Committee, which established the reorganization of Mount Lebanon in March 1861. In this, Mount Lebanon would remain a subject of the Sublime Porte and would be “ruled by a non-local Christian governor, independent from the governors of Beirut and Damascus.” Fuad worked closely with Great Britain&#x27;s representative to the Committee, Lord Dufferin, as they both had similar interests in preventing French domination in the region. Though Dufferin spoke critically of the corruption and lack of communication he believed to exist in the Empire, he proposed the creation of a semi-independent Syria with Fuad as a “governor-general” This was due to Dufferin&#x27;s great respect towards Fuad, whom he described as “tall, handsom, well-versed in French, and of charming manners.” Fuad, however, signed an agreement General de Beaufort, the commander of the French troops, in order to use the French to their advantage in the region. This smooth diplomatic skill was attributed to his sense of humor, and “subtlety and tact of the polished diplomat.” This agreement resulted in the establishment of the Law of the Provinces, of which Fuad was an architect, which created the province of Syria.

==Grand Vizier, 1861–1863, 1863–1866==
In 1861, Sultan Abdülaziz named Fuad as Grand Vizier, replacing his colleague Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha. Abdülaziz preferred Fuad&#x27;s quick and decisive manner, though he did not grant Fuad the same sort of independence and autonomy that Mehmed Emin Aali had enjoyed under Sultan Abdülmecid, which Fuad sought. Fuad was appointed to two full terms as Grand Vizier, though he resigned in 1866 because of his opposition to Abdülaziz&#x27;s plan to marry Isma&#x27;il Pasha&#x27;s (the Khedive of Egypt) daughter.

==Later career and death==
===Foreign Minister, 1867–1869===

Sultan Abdülaziz reappointed Fuad to his final term as foreign minister, due to French and British insistence during revolts in Crete and the threat of Russian intervention. As Foreign Minister, he wrote a political testament with advice to the Sultan regarding an alliance with Great Britain and France based on shared interests and a common enemy of Russia. Fuad demonstrated understanding of Russian expansion and confessed that, “I too would have turned the world upside-down to capture Istanbul.” He called for the modernization of the Empire to gain legitimacy in France&#x27;s eyes in order to strengthen these alliances against Russia. He considered Great Britain as the Empire&#x27;s most important ally and stated, “the English people...will always be the first to have our alliance and we will hold fast to that alliance to the last” and that “we should relinquish several of our provinces rather than see England abandon us” Regarding France, the Empire should maintain polite relations in order to prevent conflict, rather than hope for protection.

===Death, 1869===

Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha was also reappointed as Grand Vizier and went to Crete from 1867 to 1868. While Mehmed Emin Aali was successfully ending the revolt, Fuad was acting Grand Vizier and Foreign Minister, and accompanied Sultan Abdülaziz on a trip through Europe in the summer of 1867. The double burden put considerable strain on Fuad, however, and he sought medical attention and rest in France. He died in Nice on February 12, 1869. His body was returned to Constantinople by the French Navy on board the aviso .

== Personality and ideology ==
Fuad was described as being tall, handsome, and loquacious. Compared to Âli, Fuad was couth in western mannerisms, as well as having a more prestigious upbringing and family. Fuad Pasha was an early advocate of laïcité, and to that end, secularism, in the Ottoman/Turkish politics, the belief that the state should be above religion. He was generally willing to go farther than Âli in reform.

== Personal life ==
Mehmed Fuad married Emine Behiye Hanım, and had two sons, Ahmed Nazım Bey and Kazım Bey. His elder son, Nazım Bey (died 1863) married Nimetullah Hanım (21 November 1838 – 25 January 1905), daughter of Şevket Bey, and had two sons, Mustafa Hikmet Bey (2 July 1857 – 6 August 1911) and Reşad Fuad Bey (6 June 1861 – 12 June 1921). 

Mustafa Hikmet married Mihrünnisa Hanım, daughter of Hayrullah Efendi and Münteha Hanım, and sister of poet Abdülhak Hâmid Tarhan. They had one son, Ahmed Nazım Bey, and one daughter who died in infancy. Reşad Fuad married Behiye Hanım, daughter of Hayreddin Pasha and his fourth wife Kamer Hanım, and had four sons, Mehmed Hayreddin Fuad Keçeci, Mehmed Salih Keçeci (1893 – 1954), Mehmed Fuad Keçeci (died 1967), and Ali Şevket Fuad Keçeci.

Mehmed Fuad&#x27;s younger son, Kazım Bey (died 1859) married Gülbiz Ikbal Hanım, a former Circassian slave, and had a son Izzet Fuad Pasha (1860 — 1925). Izzet Fuad married the Egyptian princess Fatima Aziza Amina Hanim (1854 – 1895), second daughter of Prince Mustafa Fazıl Pasha, and his wife Rengi Gul Hanim. They had one son, Kazım Bey.

Fuad Pasha was a freemason.

<doc id="1099298" wikidata="Q1004449" url="?curid=1099298" title="Fuzzy Logic (Super Furry Animals album)">
<text>Fuzzy Logic is the debut album by the Welsh rock band Super Furry Animals. Recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales, and released on the Creation label in May 1996, it was positively received by critics, who felt it was an eclectic if inconsistent mix of psychedelic music and glam rock, and was included in &quot;Q Magazine&#x27;s&quot; list of recordings of the year. It has retained a modest respect among some critics; it was listed in &quot;Q&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Best British Albums Ever&quot; in July 2004, and is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It contains two top 20 hits in &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Want Me to Destroy You&quot; and &quot;Something 4 the Weekend&quot;; it also contains the singles &quot;God! Show Me Magic&quot; and &quot;Hometown Unicorn&quot;. It reached number 23 in the UK Albums Chart on release. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 245 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

==Recording==
In a 2008 interview with &quot;Uncut&quot; Gruff Rhys described the process of making the album:

Although the album was conceived as a reaction to Britpop which the band felt represented a &quot;conservative backwards movement in music&quot; they soon realised that they were in an &quot;old 70&#x27;s studio making [a] 70&#x27;s rock album&quot;. Former members Rhys Ifans and Dic Ben contributed to the track &quot;Long Gone&quot; by leaving an answerphone message which plays as the song comes to a close.

The album cover is a montage of photos of Welsh-born drug smuggler Howard Marks, the subject of the song &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Howard Marks&quot;. Marks visited Rockfield during the making of the album at the band&#x27;s request.

==Reception==

Reviewing &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot; in 1996 for &quot;NME&quot;, Simon Williams commented that debut albums &quot;rarely come as multi-layered, as lovingly-manipulated as this&quot;. A rave review in &quot;Alternative Press&quot; praised the album as &quot;the stuff of which fearless dreams are forged&quot;. Jon Wiederhorn of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt it was &quot;rich in hallucinogenic spirit and shimmering guitars&quot; and invoked the spirit of early 1970s pop music. James Delingpole in a January 1997 review in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote the band had produced a &quot;strange mix of Bowie-esque glam rock, school-of-Syd-Barrett psychedelia and DIY kitsch&quot;, which resulted in a &quot;delightfully skewed&quot; album. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic later commented that on &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot;, the band combined psychedelia and art rock with pop melodies in an &quot;intoxicating&quot; manner, and that despite not being fully cohesive as an album, &quot;the individual pleasures of each song become more apparent with each listen&quot;. &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot; was named the third best album of 1996 by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and fourth best by &quot;NME&quot;. The album was also included in &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of recordings of the year.

&quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot; reached number 23 in the UK Albums Chart on release.

==Legacy==
In a June 2005 &quot;Pitchfork&quot; review of the 2005 reissue, Marc Hogan felt the album was a good introduction to the band&#x27;s &quot;candy-factory chameleon act&quot; with music styles including &quot;synth-laced punk-pop&quot;, &quot;slanted pop&quot; and &quot;&quot;Pipers&quot;-era Floyd&quot;, despite its inconsistency. Rod Stanley in the 2005 book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; felt that the band would go on to record better albums, but that the inventiveness of the album&#x27;s blend of &quot;Sixties pop, punk rock, and psychedelia, with an underlying Nineties dance sensibility&quot;, made it both joyful and exciting. Reviewing the album in 2016, &quot;Uncut&quot;″s John Lewis wrote that its &quot;quizzical&quot; lyrics and influences from &quot;1970s guilty pleasures&quot; set Super Furry Animals apart from their contemporaries in the 1990s Britpop scene.

In 1999, critic Ned Raggett ranked &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot; at number 74 on his list of &quot;The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties&quot; for &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot;. &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot; was listed at number 42 in &quot;Q&quot;″s 2004 list of the &quot;50 Best British Albums Ever&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked the album at number 27 on its list of the 50 best Britpop albums. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 245 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

<text>An apse line, or line of apsides, is an imaginary line defined by an orbit&#x27;s eccentricity vector. It is strictly defined for elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic orbits.

For such orbits the apse line is found:
* for elliptical orbitsbetween the orbit&#x27;s periapsis and apoapsis (also known as the major axis) 
* for parabolic and hyperbolic orbitsbetween the orbit&#x27;s periapsis and focus

For circular orbits, the apse line is not defined because the eccentricity is equal to zero. As it is required as a base for the definition of true anomaly, it is usually arbitrarily assumed (as a line pointing into the direction of the vernal equinox).

<doc id="1099317" wikidata="Q1087172" url="?curid=1099317" title="Christocentrism">
<text>Christocentrism is a doctrinal term within Christianity, describing theological positions that focus on Jesus Christ, the second person of the Christian Trinity, in relation to the Godhead/God the Father (theocentric) or the Holy Spirit (pneumocentric). Christocentric theologies make Christ the central theme about which all other theological positions/doctrines are oriented.

== Augustinism ==
Certain theological traditions within Christianity can be described as more heavily &quot;Christocentric&quot;. Notably, the teachings of Augustine of Hippo and Paul of Tarsus, which have been very influential in the West, place a great emphasis on the person of Jesus in the process of salvation.

For instance, in Reformed theology, the Lutheran tradition is seen as more theologically &quot;Christocentric&quot;, as it places its doctrine of justification by grace, which is primarily a Christological doctrine, at the center of its thought. Meanwhile, the Calvinist tradition is seen as more theologically &quot;theocentric&quot;, as it places its doctrine of the sovereignty of God (&quot;the Father&quot;) at the center.

== John Duns Scotus ==
Duns Scotus is famous for his belief in the primacy of Jesus, whereby the &quot;Logos&quot; would have become incarnate even had the Fall never taken place. Scotus writes, &quot;that God predestined this soul [of Christ] to so great a glory does not seem to be only on account of [redemption], since the redemption or the glory of the soul to be redeemed is not comparable to the glory of Christ’s soul. Neither is it likely that the highest good in creation is something that was merely occasioned only because of some lesser good; nor is it likely that He predestined Adam to such good before He predestined Christ; and yet this would follow [were the Incarnation occasioned by Adam’s sin]. In fact, if the predestination of Christ’s soul was for the sole purpose of redeeming others, something even more absurd would follow, namely, that in predestining Adam to glory, He would have foreseen him as having fallen into sin before He predestined Christ to glory&quot;. As such, Scotus&#x27;s theology is grounded in the claim that Creation exists for the sake of Jesus, regardless of whether any individual chooses to sin.

== John Paul II ==
John Paul II&#x27;s magisterium has been called &quot;Christocentric&quot; by Catholic theologians. He further taught that the Marian devotions of the Rosary were in fact Christocentric because they brought the faithful to Jesus through Mary.

== Biblical hermeneutics ==
The Christocentric principle is also commonly used for biblical hermeneutics. The aim behind it is to read and interpret the narratives of the Old Testament in light and primacy of the revelation of Jesus. It is usually employed to demonstrate the Christ typologically (&quot;or via allegoresis&quot;) through the Hebrew Bible (&quot;since Christ did not fulfill any prophecy in the authorial context&quot;), but not in a grammatical or authorial sense as understood today. Another aim behind it is to purge away detrimental and/or theologically incoherent ideas of God found in the texts of the Old Testament. The Christocentric method (&quot;as in Christ is the interpretive telos or goal behind reading the Law&quot;) is mentioned by the apostle Paul in Romans 10:4, and Ignatius of Antioch thematically demonstrates that the Christ (&quot;or the revelation of Christ&quot;) is the magisterial and &quot;“inviolable”&quot; record, or the &quot;“charters”&quot; according to J. B. Lightfoot and Kirsopp Lake; Ignatius considers the incarnation of the Christ to be superior to the Jewish writings when he disagrees with the religious Jews on what is considered authoritative (Philadelphians 8:2-9:2). Ignatius repeats this idea by writing, &quot;“But the Gospel has its own preeminence: the advent of the Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ, His passion, and the resurrection,” or “ ἐξαίρετον δέ τι ἔχει τὸ εὐαγγέλιον, τὴν παρουσίαν τοῦ σωτῆρος, κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, τὸ πάθος αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν ἀνάστασιν”. The Greek is found in Kirsopp’s edition.&quot;

This interpretive technique is employed by early Christians like Paul of Tarsus when he argues (&quot;through a rhetorical, dichotomous question&quot;) that the Mosaic command for the care of oxen was not inspired by God in its original context, but in its spiritual form for believers (1st Corin. 9:9-10), when he argues that the mosaic rites acted as symbols or types for Jesus (Colo. 2:16-17), like the patristic Pseudo-Barnabas, who argued that God never forbade the consumption of pork, nor commanded circumcision since these things were interpreted naively due to an evil angel misleading them, but these served as spiritual lessons (ibid. 9:1, 4, 6, 10:2-3, 9), like Origen of Alexandria when he argued that infantile Christians had vicious and irrational ideas of God (&quot;an interpretive mistake similarly employed by the Gnostics and Jews&quot;) due to literalism and a lack of the pneumatic, interpretive approach (First Prin. IV.8-9), like Saint Athanasius, who cited Colossians 2:17 and Hebrews 9:10, argued that God never commanded sacrifice through the law of Moses, &quot;“nor even when they came to mount Sinai,”&quot; but He prefigured the symbols towards Christ (Letter 19, Section 3–4), like Gregory of Nyssa when he wrote that the Exodus narrative where the firstborn die for the sins of their fathers is an idea so impious that he considers it unworthy of God; thus, he reinterprets it as &quot;“The teaching is this: When through virtue one comes to grips with any evil, he must completely destroy the first beginnings of evil”&quot; (Life of Moses 2.89-101), and even an early Christian document, the Didascalia, speaks of Christ fulfilling the types and it denies God commanding sacrifice in the beginning to Cain and Abel (ibid. Chapter 26, translated by R. Hugh Connolly).

== Interfaith and ecumenism ==
Christocentrism is also a name given to a particular approach in interfaith and ecumenical dialogue. It teaches that Christianity is absolutely true, but the elements of truth in other religions are always in relation to the fullness of truth found in Christianity. The Holy Spirit is thought to allow inter-religious dialogue and to influence non-believers in their journey to Christ. This view is notably advocated by the Catholic Church in the declarations &quot;Nostra aetate&quot;, Unitatis Redintegratio and Dominus Iesus.

<doc id="1099336" wikidata="Q2964639" url="?curid=1099336" title="Chris Addison">
<text>Christopher David Addison (born 5 November 1971) is a British comedian, writer, actor, and director. He is perhaps best known for his role as a regular panellist on &quot;Mock the Week&quot;. He is also known for his lecture-style comedy shows, two of which he later adapted for BBC Radio 4.

In addition to stand-up, Addison played Ollie Reeder in the BBC Two satire series &quot;The Thick of It&quot; (2005) and Toby Wright in its spin-off film &quot;In the Loop&quot; (2009), starred in the Sky Living comedy-drama &quot;Trying Again&quot; (2014) and appeared in three episodes of series 8 of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He also co-created and starred in the BBC Two sitcom &quot;Lab Rats&quot; (2008). On radio, he previously hosted the weekly comedy news satire show &quot;7 Day Sunday&quot; on BBC Radio 5 Live from 2009 to 2010. In 2020 he co-created the FX parental comedy series &quot;Breeders&quot; starring Martin Freeman.

== Early life ==
Addison was born in Cardiff, Wales, to English parents and moved back with his parents to Worsley, Salford, England, when he was four. On the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, he stated that he considers himself a middle class Mancunian. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School, an independent school for boys in Manchester. At MGS rather than playing cricket he played the game podex. This was followed by the University of Birmingham, where he studied English Literature with the original intent of becoming a theatre director. After his directing plans did not work out, he drifted into comedy as an alternative creative outlet.

==Career==

===Stand-up===

Addison&#x27;s first solo show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe was in 1998, for which he was nominated for Best Newcomer at the Perrier Awards. He continued to bring shows to the Fringe for several years, gaining two Perrier Award nominations – for his 2004 show &quot;Civilisation&quot; and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Atomicity&quot;.
In 2005 he won the City Life Comedian of the Year Award, a stand-up competition in the North West of England.

===Radio===
First broadcast in 2004, Addison co-wrote and co-starred in the political satire &quot;The Department&quot;, along with John Oliver and Andy Zaltzman. It ran for 14 episodes over three series on BBC Radio 4, ending in 2006.

In August 2005, Radio 4 aired &quot;The Ape That Got Lucky&quot;, Addison&#x27;s adaptation of his 2002 Edinburgh Festival Fringe show of the same name. This programme featured fellow comedians Geoffrey McGivern, Jo Enright and Dan Tetsell. On 8 May 2006, &quot;The Ape That Got Lucky&quot; won the gold award in the comedy production category at the Sony Radio Academy Awards.

In 2006, Addison recorded &quot;Chris Addison&#x27;s Civilization&quot;, again for Radio 4, based on his Edinburgh Fringe show of 2004; this again featured McGivern, Enright and Tetsell and was aired in four parts over the summer.

He has been a panellist on three of Radio 4&#x27;s comedy panel games: &quot;Armando Iannucci&#x27;s Charm Offensive&quot;, first appearing in 2006, &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, first appearing in 2007, and &quot;The Unbelievable Truth&quot;, first appearing in 2009.

Addison hosted a series of the Radio 4 comedy series &quot;4 Stands Up&quot;, which showcases up-coming and established comedy talent. As host, Addison performs a short opening set and introduces the acts, in the style of a compère at a comedy club. The first episode was broadcast on 2 April 2009.

On 10 May 2009, Addison hosted the &quot;Sunday Night Show&quot; on Absolute Radio in place of fellow stand-up comedian Iain Lee who was away due to being on his honeymoon.

Addison hosted &quot;7 Day Sunday&quot;, a satirical news show on BBC Radio 5 Live along with his co-hosts Sarah Millican and Andy Zaltzman. The first episode aired in January 2010. Addison presented the second series of the show until February 2011, when he was replaced by Al Murray.

He is also good friends with Geoff Lloyd on Absolute Radio and has made a few appearances on &quot;Geoff Lloyd&#x27;s Hometime Show&quot;.

===Television===

====&quot;The Thick of It&quot;====
From 2005 to 2012, Addison appeared in the BBC television satirical comedy series &quot;The Thick of It&quot; as Oliver &quot;Ollie&quot; Reeder, Junior Advisor (later Special Advisor) to the Secretary of State (Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship). He appeared in all of the four series, as well as the two specials &#x27;Rise of the Nutters&#x27; and &#x27;Spinners and Losers&#x27;.

Addison also featured in the film spin-off of &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, titled &quot;In the Loop&quot;, playing Toby Wright, a character very similar to his part in the television original.

====&quot;Lab Rats&quot;====
In July 2008, BBC Two aired &quot;Lab Rats&quot;, a sitcom starring Addison and co-written with Carl Cooper. &quot;Lab Rats&quot; featured cast members Jo Enright, Geoffrey McGivern and Dan Tetsell, with whom Addison had worked previously on the radio adaptations of his one-man shows &quot;The Ape That Got Lucky&quot; and &quot;Civilisation&quot;.

&quot;Lab Rats&quot; was a return to the traditional, joke-heavy, studio based sitcom format that has fallen out of fashion in recent times in favour of the single-camera sitcom. The series was not generally well received by critics and was not renewed for a second series.

====&quot;Mock the Week&quot;====
After several guest appearances on the comedy panel show &quot;Mock the Week&quot;, in September 2011 Addison became a regular panellist, appearing in every episode since the second part of series 10 until series 12 (2013). He appeared alongside other regular panellists Hugh Dennis and Andy Parsons and the show&#x27;s host, Dara Ó Briain.

====Other TV acting projects====
In 2014 Addison starred in the Sky Living series &quot;Trying Again&quot;.

====Guest appearances and hosting====
In 2000 Addison co-hosted the short-lived Channel 4 comedy series &quot;Dotcomedy&quot; with Gail Porter. This was a late-night, risque show featuring video clips and other humour derived from the Internet.

He has appeared on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; six times, &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; once and &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot; twice. Addison also appeared in episode 3 of series 5 of &quot;Live at the Apollo&quot;. He has thrice appeared on &quot;QI&quot;.

Addison appeared on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; on 16 April 2009 promoting &quot;In the Loop&quot;. On 18 April 2010 he appeared on &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; to comment on the week&#x27;s political issues, including the volcanic ash cloud from Iceland and The First Election Debate.

He appeared on &quot;Skins&quot; as Professor David Blood, the college director of Roundview College and father of third Generation character Grace Violet. On 4 November 2010 Addison hosted the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;, having previously been a guest on the show.

In the summer of 2011 Addison hosted an E4 comedy chat show called &quot;Show and Tell&quot;, with each of the 8 episodes featuring three guest stand-up comedians.

Addison has also made an appearance in children&#x27;s television show &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;.

In August 2014, it was announced that Addison would make a guest appearance in the two-part series finale of the eighth series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; with his former &quot;The Thick of It&quot; co-star Peter Capaldi, who plays the Twelfth Doctor. His character, Seb, first appeared in the mid-series episode &quot;The Caretaker&quot; and then appeared in further episodes including &quot;Dark Water&quot; and &quot;Death in Heaven&quot;.

====Directing and producing====
In 2013, he began working as a director on Armando Iannucci&#x27;s HBO sitcom &quot;Veep&quot;. He directed 13 episodes. In 2016, he won the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series and received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. Alongside directing, he also served as executive producer in 2015. For this work on Series 3, he and the other producers on the show received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. They won the award for Series 4 and 5.

In 2020, sitcom &quot;Breeders&quot; premiered on both US TV channel FX and Britain&#x27;s Sky One. Breeders was co-created by Addison, main co-star Martin Freeman and comedy writer Simon Blackwell and is based on Freeman&#x27;s own experience as a parent. It went on for 4 successful series with Sky and Addison directed 15 episodes.

===Film===

Addison directed the 2019 comedy &quot;The Hustle&quot;, starring Rebel Wilson and Anne Hathaway, a remake of &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; (1988), which in turn was a remake of &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; (1964).

In 2022, Addison directed Ralph Fiennes playing George Frederick Handel in a period comedy-drama, &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.

===Other work===

<text>Eustache de Saint Pierre is the best-known figure of the group of six known as The Burghers of Calais, the first to volunteer and surrender, wearing &quot;a shirt and a rope around his neck&quot; to the King of England at that time, Edward III, to save the people of Calais (August 1347).

According to the chronicler Jean Froissart, the king pardoned him at the request of his wife, Philippa of Hainault.

The scene of the surrender of the mayor of Calais was immortalized in a bronze statue by Rodin and can be seen in twelve copies, including the Belfry square in Calais, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Victoria Tower Gardens adjoining Parliament in London, or at the art museum Glyptotek in Copenhagen (Denmark), and the Rodin Museum in Paris. A cast of the figure representing Saint Pierre is in the Museo Soumaya in Mexico City. A cast is also in Memorial Plaza at The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.

<text>Winchester railway station serves the city of Winchester, in the county of Hampshire, England. It is a stop on the South West Main Line and was known as Winchester City from 1949–67, to distinguish it from Winchester (Chesil) station. It is down the line from .

Despite its prominence, the station only has two platforms. One is on the western side, with the line running in a northerly direction via Basingstoke, Woking and Clapham Junction, towards the terminal at Waterloo. The other is on the eastern side, with the line running in a southerly direction, towards Eastleigh, where it splits and runs towards Southampton Central, Bournemouth and or .

==History==
The station was opened on 10 June 1839 by the London and Southampton Railway (later the London and South Western Railway). It became a temporary terminus for the Winchester to Southampton section. On the same day, another station was opened at Basingstoke, which was a temporary terminus of the London to Basingstoke section.

In the following year, a line was built joining Winchester and Basingstoke and the line was complete. This line was the trickiest to construct; it had four tunnels and a single station called &quot;Andover Road&quot; (now Micheldever), rather optimistically given that Andover lay west. Winchester became a through station on 30 March 1840.

As the line bypassed Kingston upon Thames, Winchester was the only major settlement on the line between London and Southampton. Since the original Southampton line ran via the then small market town of Basingstoke, where lines to the west would be built, it was not very direct. Another line was constructed to run via Guildford, Farnham and Alton, which joined the main line north of Winchester. The present day line runs via Aldershot instead of Guildford, and the line finishes at Alton. British Rail closed the line from Alton to Winchester in 1973, but a section from Alton to Alresford is preserved as the Watercress Line. The final gap from Alresford to Winchester is unlikely ever to be reinstated, owing to housing and the M3 having been built on the former trackbed.

Later, the Great Western Railway built the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway. This passed at a separate station on the eastern side of Winchester, called &quot;Winchester Cheesehill&quot;; in 1949, it was renamed , whilst Winchester&#x27;s main station was renamed &quot;Winchester City&quot;. This did not last long; in 1966, Chesil closed and an alternative diversionary route to Oxford, Birmingham and beyond, bypassing Basingstoke and Reading, was consequently lost. The following year, British Rail changed the station name from &quot;Winchester City&quot; to &quot;Winchester&quot;.

Renovations in summer 2004 gave the western side of the station a refurbished entrance and second ticket office, albeit with shorter opening hours than that on the eastern side.

In summer 2009, both platforms received ticket barriers with CCTV, with the entrance to platform 2 from the forecourt reorganised as part of South West Trains&#x27; plan to fit or refit ticket barriers on the busiest stations on the network.

In July 2013, a brand new footbridge was constructed between the platforms and also features lifts.

===Romsey Rail Link===
There was a rail-bus link, operated on behalf of South West Trains, that was known as the &quot;Romsey Rail Link&quot; service. It followed the same route as the X66, linking the station with Romsey via Hursley and Ampfield but with limited stops. Guards were equipped with rail ticket machines and were able to issue tickets for the entire rail network as well as weekly season tickets, thereby saving passengers the necessity of queuing at the station ticket office.

The service ceased on 28 July 2008 when South West Trains withdrew its subsidy, citing lack of use, despite a protest group having formed and collecting a petition of over 1,000 signatures to oppose the closure.

As part of the superseded X66 timetable, Stagecoach South continue to operate two of the early morning peak services, which were well used alongside the existing hourly services (now half-hourly on weekdays) but without the facility to purchase rail tickets on the buses. The route (now known simply as &quot;Route 66&quot;) has been extended with variants through the day, and increased journey times, to serve Romsey&#x27;s outlying housing estates at Woodley, Cupernham and Abbotswood.

===Accidents and incidents===
In 1937, a boat train caught fire due to an electrical defect in one of the carriages. Four carriages were destroyed.

===Goods yard and motive power depot===
A small engine shed was built by the Southern Railway in 1927. This housed a shunting locomotive which worked in the local goods yard. It was closed in 1963, together with the goods yard. There were formerly extensive sidings on both sides of the station and a coal yard, all now largely converted to car parks. On the eastern side, in the area now occupied by retail units, there was a cattle dock for livestock arriving by rail for the adjacent Winchester Cattle Market in Andover Road.

==Services==
The station is served by two train operating companies:
* South Western Railway provides three trains per hour to , with the fastest taking 61 minutes. Southbound, there is one train per hour to , one to and one to . There is also an hourly local service to Southampton Central that starts from here.
* CrossCountry services between and , via and , call hourly in each direction.

<text>The NTR Telugu Desam Party (Lakshmi Parvathi) (NTRTDP-LP) was a regional political party in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It was founded by Lakshmi Parvathi, the second wife of the film star and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) founder N. T. Rama Rao (NTR) in 1996. The party was formed after NTR&#x27;s death to counter the TDP but failed to make any significant electoral impact. In 2014, Parvathi joined the YSR Congress Party and NTRTDP-LP was delisted by the Election Commission of India in 2016.

==History==
The NTR Telugu Desam Party (Lakshmi Parvathi) (NTRTDP-LP) was founded in 1996 by Lakshmi Parvathi, the second wife of NTR, following his death and an internal coup within the TDP in 1995. The coup was triggered by widespread dissatisfaction among party members and legislators over Lakshmi Parvathi&#x27;s interference in party and state affairs after her marriage to NTR in 1993. With the majority of TDP legislators supporting N. Chandrababu Naidu, this ultimately led to NTR’s removal as the party leader. The NTRTDP-LP was formed as a counter to the TDP under Naidu&#x27;s leadership.

In the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, it contested all 42 constituencies in Andhra Pradesh and polled 10.66% of the vote share in the state, but it failed to win a single seat. In the 1998 elections, the party allied with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but the alliance did not yield significant results. The party’s candidates collectively secured only 1.2% of the vote share in Andhra Pradesh.

After the 1998 elections, the party began to decline as several leaders left, and the BJP allied with Naidu&#x27;s TDP. In the 1999 elections, the NTRTDP (LP) fielded candidates in the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections but performed poorly, with negligible vote shares.

By the 2004 elections, the party’s influence had diminished significantly, fielding only a single Lok Sabha candidate and 18 state assembly candidates, none of whom were successful. Lakshmi Parvathi herself secured only 946 votes in the Atmakur constituency.

The party failed to recover politically and Lakshmi Parvathi herself joined the YSR Congress Party in 2014. It was delisted by the Election Commission of India in 2016.

<doc id="1099348" wikidata="Q183252" url="?curid=1099348" title="Morphology (biology)">
<text>Morphology (from Ancient Greek μορφή (morphḗ) &quot;form&quot;, and λόγος (lógos) &quot;word, study, research&quot;) is the study of the form and structure of organisms and their specific structural features.

This includes aspects of the outward appearance (shape, structure, color, pattern, size), as well as the form and structure of internal parts like bones and organs, i.e., anatomy. This is in contrast to physiology, which deals primarily with function. Morphology is a branch of life science dealing with the study of the overall structure of an organism or taxon and its component parts.

== History ==
The etymology of the word &quot;morphology&quot; is from the Ancient Greek (), meaning &quot;form&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;word, study, research&quot;.

While the concept of form in biology, opposed to function, dates back to Aristotle (see Aristotle&#x27;s biology), the field of morphology was developed by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1790) and independently by the German anatomist and physiologist Karl Friedrich Burdach (1800).

Among other important theorists of morphology are Lorenz Oken, Georges Cuvier, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Richard Owen, Carl Gegenbaur and Ernst Haeckel.

In 1830, Cuvier and Saint-Hilaire engaged in a famous debate, which is said to exemplify the two major deviations in biological thinking at the time – whether animal structure was due to function or evolution.

== Divisions of morphology ==
* Comparative morphology is an analysis of the patterns of the locus of structures within the body plan of an organism, and forms the basis of taxonomical categorization.
* Functional morphology is the study of the relationship between the structure and function of morphological features.
* Experimental morphology is the study of the effects of external factors upon the morphology of organisms under experimental conditions, such as the effect of genetic mutation.
* Anatomy is a &quot;branch of morphology that deals with the structure of organisms&quot;.
* Molecular morphology is a rarely used term, usually referring to the superstructure of polymers such as fiber formation or to larger composite assemblies. The term is commonly not applied to the spatial structure of individual molecules.
* Gross morphology refers to the collective structures of an organism as a whole as a general description of the form and structure of an organism, taking into account all of its structures without specifying an individual structure.

== Morphology and classification ==
Most taxa differ morphologically from other taxa. Typically, closely related taxa differ much less than more distantly related ones, but there are exceptions to this. Cryptic species are species which look very similar, or perhaps even outwardly identical, but are reproductively isolated. Conversely, sometimes unrelated taxa acquire a similar appearance as a result of convergent evolution or even mimicry. In addition, there can be morphological differences within a species, such as in &quot;Apoica flavissima&quot; where queens are significantly smaller than workers. A further problem with relying on morphological data is that what may appear morphologically to be two distinct species may in fact be shown by DNA analysis to be a single species. The significance of these differences can be examined through the use of allometric engineering in which one or both species are manipulated to phenocopy the other species.

A step relevant to the evaluation of morphology between traits/features within species, includes an assessment of the terms: homology and homoplasy. Homology between features indicates that those features have been derived from a common ancestor. Alternatively, homoplasy between features describes those that can resemble each other, but derive independently via parallel or convergent evolution.

==3D cell morphology: classification==
The invention and development of microscopy enabled the observation of 3-D cell morphology with both high spatial and temporal resolution. The dynamic processes of this cell morphology which are controlled by a complex system play an important role in varied important biological processes, such as immune and invasive responses.

<doc id="1099357" wikidata="Q1321958" url="?curid=1099357" title="Marxist feminism">
<text>Marxist feminism is a philosophical variant of feminism that incorporates and extends Marxist theory. Marxist feminism analyzes the ways in which women are exploited through capitalism and the individual ownership of private property. According to Marxist feminists, women&#x27;s liberation can only be achieved by dismantling the capitalist systems in which they contend much of women&#x27;s labor is uncompensated. Marxist feminists extend traditional Marxist analysis by applying it to unpaid domestic labor and sex relations.

Because of its foundation in historical materialism, Marxist feminism is similar to socialist feminism and, to a greater degree, materialist feminism. The latter two place greater emphasis on what they consider the &quot;reductionist limitations&quot; of Marxist theory but, as Martha E. Gimenez notes in her exploration of the differences between Marxist and materialist feminism, &quot;clear lines of theoretical demarcation between and within these two umbrella terms are somewhat difficult to establish.&quot;

== Theoretical background in Marxism ==
Marxism follows the development of oppression and class division in the evolution of human society through the development and organization of wealth and production, and concludes the evolution of oppressive societal structure to be relative to the evolution of oppressive family structures, i.e., the normalization of oppressing the female sex marks or coincides with the birth of oppressive society in general.

In &quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State&quot; (1884), Friedrich Engels writes about the earliest origins of the family structure, social hierarchy, and the concept of wealth, drawing from both ancient and contemporary study. He concludes that women originally had a higher social status and equal consideration in labor, and particularly, only women were sure to share a family name. As the earliest men did not even share the family name, Engels says, they did not know for sure who their children were or benefit from inheritance.

When agriculture first became abundant and the abundance was considered male wealth, as it was sourced from the male work environment away from the home, a deeper wish for male lineage and inheritance was founded. To achieve that wish, women were not only granted their long-sought monogamy but forced into it as part of domestic servitude, while males pursued a hushed culture of &quot;hetaerism&quot;. Engels describes this situation as coincidental to the beginnings of forced servitude as a dominant feature of society, leading eventually to a European culture of class oppression, where the children of the poor were expected to be servants of the rich.

Engels rewrites a quote in this book, by himself and Marx from 1846, &quot;The first division of labor is that between man and woman for the propagation of children,&quot; to say, &quot;The first class opposition that appears in history coincides with the development of the antagonism between man and woman in monogamous marriage, and the first class oppression coincides with that of the female sex by the male.&quot;

Gender oppression is reproduced culturally and maintained through institutionalized inequality. By privileging men at the expense of women and refusing to acknowledge traditional domestic labor as equally valuable, the working-class man is socialized into an oppressive structure which marginalizes the working-class woman.

== Productive, unproductive, and reproductive labor ==
Marx categorized labor into two categories: productive and unproductive.

*Productive labor is labor that creates surplus value, e.g. production of raw materials and manufacturing products.
*Unproductive labor does not create surplus value and may in fact be subsidized by it. This can include supervisory duties, bookkeeping, marketing, etc.

Early Marxist and Socialist feminists began creating working women&#x27;s organizations within broader worker movements in the early 1910s. These organizers considered the needs of working women to be different to those of the feminist movements that had been developed by the bourgeoise. Separating gender from class as a means for liberation was unthinkable for these women, and they found various levels of success within communist and socialist parties for their ideas. Marxist feminists such as Mary Inman established networks of likeminded members within these organizations that were able to lobby for women&#x27;s oppression to be considered a key policy issue by the 1940s. 

Marxist feminist authors in the 1970s, such as Margaret Benston and Peggy Morton, relied heavily on analysis of productive and unproductive labor in an attempt to shift the perception of the time that consumption was the purpose of a family, presenting arguments for a state-paid wage to homemakers, and a cultural perception of the family as a productive entity. In capitalism, the work of maintaining a family has little material value, as it produces no marketable products. In Marxism, the maintenance of a family is productive, as it has a service value, and is used in the same sense as a commodity.

=== Wages for housework ===
Focusing on exclusion from productive labor as the most important source of female oppression, some Marxist feminists advocated for the inclusion of domestic work within the waged capitalist economy. The idea of compensating reproductive labor was present in the writing of socialists such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1898) who argued that women&#x27;s oppression stemmed from being forced into the private sphere. Gilman argued that conditions for women would improve when their work was located, recognized, and valued in the public sphere.

Perhaps the most influential effort to compensate reproductive labor was the International Wages for Housework Campaign, an organization launched in Italy in 1972 by members of the International Feminist Collective. Many of these women, including Selma James, Mariarosa Dalla Costa, Brigitte Galtier, and Silvia Federici published a range of sources to promote their message in academic and public domains. Despite beginning as a small group of women in Italy, the Wages for Housework Campaign was successful in mobilizing on an international level. A Wages for Housework group was founded in Brooklyn, New York, with the help of Federici. As Heidi Hartmann acknowledges (1981), the efforts of these movements, though ultimately unsuccessful, generated important discourse regarding the value of housework and its relation to the economy. 

=== Domestic slavery ===

Many Marxist feminist scholars analyzing modes of oppression at the site of production note the effect that housework has on women in a capitalist system. In Angela Davis&#x27; &quot;Women, Race and Class&quot;, the concept of housework is utilized to deconstruct the capitalist construct of gendered labor within the home and to show the ways in which women are exploited through &quot;domestic slavery&quot;. To address this, Davis concludes that the &quot;socialisation of housework – including meal preparation and child care – presupposes an end to the profit-motive&#x27;s reign over the economy.&quot;

Attempts to address these challenges were regularly met with resistance. Attempts to address the exploitation of domestic labor were met with pushback by critics who argued that this type of gendered housework should be considered a social good. In this manner, Marxist feminists argue that unquestioned domestic slavery upholds the structural inequities faced by women in all capitalist economies.

Other Marxist feminist have noted the concept of domestic work for women internationally and the role it plays in buttressing global patriarchy. In Paresh Chattopadhyay&#x27;s response to Custer&#x27;s &quot;Capital Accumulation and Women&#x27;s Labor in Asian Economies&quot;, Chattopadhyay notes the ways in which Custer analyzes &quot;women&#x27;s labor in the garments industry in West Bengal and Bangladesh as well as in Bangladesh&#x27;s agricultural sector, labor management methods of the Japanese industrial bourgeoisie and, finally, the mode of employment of the women laborers in Japanese industry&quot; in demonstrating the ways in which the domestic sphere exhibits similar gender-based exploitation of difference. In both works, the gendered division of labor, specifically within the domestic sphere, is shown to illustrate the methods the capitalist system exploits women globally.

=== Responsibility of reproductive labor ===
Another solution proposed by Marxist feminists is to liberate women from their forced connection to reproductive labor. In her critique of traditional Marxist feminist movements such as the Wages for Housework Campaign, Heidi Hartmann (1981) argues that these efforts &quot;take as their question the relationship of women to the economic system, rather than that of women to men, apparently assuming the latter will be explained in their discussion of the former.&quot; Hartmann believes that traditional discourse has ignored the importance of women&#x27;s oppression as women, and instead focused on women&#x27;s oppression as members of the capitalist system. Similarly, Gayle Rubin, who has written on a range of subjects including sadomasochism, prostitution, pornography, and lesbian literature, first rose to prominence through her 1975 essay &quot;The Traffic in Women: Notes on the &#x27;Political Economy&#x27; of Sex&quot;, in which she coins the phrase &quot;sex/gender system&quot; and criticizes Marxism for what she claims is its incomplete analysis of sexism under capitalism.

Through these works, Marxist feminists like Hartmann and Rubin framed the oppression of women as a social phenomenon that occurred when hierarchies based on perceived difference were enforced. This has been challenged within Marxist feminist circles as overcorrecting Marxism&#x27;s issues with sexism by divorcing the social oppression of women from their economic oppression. In response to Rubin&#x27;s writings, theorist Brooke Meredith Beloso argued that Marxist feminist critique &quot;must challenge the political economy that has taken and continues to take advantage of anything it can, including feminism, in order to take advantage of millions.&quot;

Many Marxist feminists have shifted their focus to the ways in which women are now potentially in worse conditions as a result of gaining access to productive labor. Nancy Folbre proposes that feminist movements begin to focus on women&#x27;s subordinate status to men both in the reproductive (private) sphere, as well as in the workplace (public sphere). In an interview in 2013, Silvia Federici urges feminist movements to consider the fact that many women are now forced into productive &quot;and&quot; reproductive labor, resulting in a double day. Federici argues that the emancipation of women cannot occur until they are free from the burden of unwaged labor, which she proposes will involve institutional changes such as closing the wage gap and implementing child care programs in the workplace. Federici&#x27;s suggestions are echoed in a similar interview with Selma James (2012) and have even been touched on in recent presidential elections.

=== Affective and emotional labor ===
Scholars and sociologists such as Michael Hardt, Antonio Negri, Arlie Russell Hochschild and Shiloh Whitney discuss a new form of labor that transcends the traditional spheres of labor and which does not create product, or is byproductive. Affective labor focuses on the blurred lines between personal life and economic life. Whitney states, &quot;The daily struggle of unemployed persons and the domestic toil of housewives no less than the waged worker are thus part of the production and reproduction of social life, and of the biopolitical growth of capital that valorizes information and subjectivities.&quot;

The concept of emotional labor, particularly the emotional labor that is present and required in pink collar jobs, was introduced by Arlie Russell Hochschild in her book &quot;The Managed Heart: Commercialization of Human Feeling&quot; (1983) in which she considers the affective labor of the profession as flight attendants smile, exchange pleasantries and banter with customers. Marxist feminists identify this as part of the social reproduction of labor, which reinforces gender and racial hierarchies.

=== Equal pay for equal labour ===
In 1977 the British feminist sociologist Veronica Beechey published &#x27;Some Notes on Female Wage Labour&#x27;, which argued that women should be understood as an unrecognised &#x27;reserve arm of labour&#x27;. In response, Floya Anthias published &#x27;Woman and the Reserve Army of Labour: A Critique of Veronica Beechy&#x27;, to query Beechey&#x27;s arguments, while also recognising that it Beechey&#x27;s was &quot;the most sophisticated and influential attempt to analyse women&#x27;s wage labour by using or reconstituting the categories of Marx&#x27;s Capital&quot;. In 1987 Verso published Beechey&#x27;s collected essays on women&#x27;s participation in labour as the book &quot;Unequal Work&quot;.

== Intersectionality and Marxist feminism ==
The emergence of intersectionality as a widely popular theory of current feminism saw different responses from Marxist feminists. Traditional Marxist feminists remain critical of its reliance on bourgeois identity politics, arguing that intersectionality limits conceptions of class and power by overemphasizing the individual and not the collective proletariat experience. In this view, differing identities are to be collectively overcome in order to challenge capitalist structures.

Marxist feminists consider intersectionality as a lens to view the interaction of different aspects of identity as a result of structured, systematic oppression. Intersectional Marxist feminism challenges the separation of class and social identity as being an incomplete critique of capitalism, that reproduces bourgeois hierarchy. While class is considered the root cause of systemic oppression in this model, Marxist feminists may use an intersectional lens to understand how class is socially produced on a global scale.

== Accomplishments and activism ==
The nature of Marxist feminists and their ability to mobilize to promote social change has enabled them to engage in important activism. As activists, Marxist feminists insist &quot;on developing politics that put women&#x27;s oppression and liberation, class politics, anti-imperialism, antiracism, and issues of gender identity and sexuality together at the heart of the agenda.&quot; Though their advocacy often receives criticism, Marxist feminists challenge capitalism in ways that facilitate new discourse and shed light on the status of women. These women throughout history have used a range of approaches in fighting hegemonic capitalism, which reflect their different views on the optimal method of achieving liberation for women.

A few women who contributed to the development of Marxist Feminism as a theory were Chizuko Ueno, Anuradha Ghandy, Claudia Jones, and Angela Davis. Chizuko Ueno is well known for being one of the first women to introduce Marxist Feminism in Japan, as one of the primary developers of feminist theories across Japan. Among other renowned Marxist Feminists, their influence impacted nations such as Ukraine, India, Russia, United States, and Trinidad and Tobago.

Marxist feminism has also been influential on feminist movements that have grown out of Latin American nations. The 2010s feminist movement in Argentina used Marxist feminism to address the relationship between various social and economic factors that contributed to gender violence in the country. Argentinian feminist theorist and activist Verónica Gago wrote in her book, &quot;Feminist International: How to Change Everything&quot;&quot;,&quot; about the use of strikes to address femicide, abortion access, and gender-based economic hardship in Argentina through feminist movements such as Ni una menos.

== Marxist feminist critiques of other branches of feminism ==
Clara Zetkin and Alexandra Kollontai were opposed to forms of feminism that reinforce class status. They did not see a true possibility to unite across economic inequality because they argue that it would be extremely difficult for an upper-class woman to truly understand the struggles of the working class. For instance, Kollontai wrote in 1909: For what reason, then, should the woman worker seek a union with the bourgeois feminists? Who, in actual fact, would stand to gain in the event of such an alliance? Certainly not the woman worker.Kollontai avoided associating herself with the term &quot;feminism&quot; as she deemed the term to be too closely related to that of the bourgeois feminism that shut out the capability of other classes to benefit from the term.

Kollontai was a prominent leader in the Bolshevik party in Russia, defending her stance on how capitalism had shaped a rather displeasing and oppressing position for women who are part of its system. She recognized and emphasized the difference between the proletariat and bourgeois women in society, though it has been expressed by Kollontai&#x27;s thought that all women under a capitalist economy were those of oppression. One of the reasons Kollontai had a strict opposition of the bourgeois women and proletariat or working-class women to have an alliance is because the bourgeois was still inherently using the women of the working class to their advantage, and therefore prolonging the injustice that women in a capitalist society are treated. She theorized that a well-balanced economic utopia was ingrained in the need for gender equality, but never identified as a feminist, though she greatly impacted the feminist movement within the ideology of feminism within and throughout socialism. Kollontai had a harsh stance on the feminist movement and believed feminists to be naïve in only addressing gender as the reason inequality was happening under a capitalist rule. She believed that the true issue of inequality was that of the division of classes that led to the immediate production of gender struggles, just how men in the structure of the classes shown a harsh divide as well. Kollontai analyzed the theories and historical implications of Marxism as a background for her ideologies, which she addressed the most profound obstacle for society to address be that of the gender inequality, which could never be eradicated under a capitalist society. 

As capitalism is inherently for private profit, Kollontai&#x27;s argument toward the eradication of women suffrage within society under a capitalist rule also delved into how women cannot and will not be abolished under a capitalist society because of the ways in which women&#x27;s &quot;free labor&quot; has been utilized. Kollontai criticized the feminist movement as also neglecting to emphasize how the working class, while trying to care and provide for a family and being paid less than that of men, was still expected to cater to and provide for the bourgeois or upper-class women who were still oppressing the working-class women by utilizing their stereotypical type of work. Kollontai also faced harsh scrutiny in being a woman leader in a time of a male dominated political stance during the Bolshevik movement. In keeping with her unusual position during her time, she also kept diaries of her plans and ideas on moving towards a more &quot;modern&quot; society where socialism would help uproot that of capitalism and the oppression that different groups of gender and class had been facing. Kollontai was a great example of a woman who was indeed still oppressed by the times and was removed from her own ideologies and progress for the mere fact she was a woman in times where being so in a powerful position was frowned upon and &quot;great women&quot; were only allowed to be placed alongside &quot;great men&quot; in history. Kollontai&#x27;s most pertinent presence in feminist socialism was her stance on reproductive rights and her view on women being allowed the same luxuries that men have in finding love not only to be stable and supported, and to also be able to make their own money and be secure on their own two feet. She focused her attention on opening up society&#x27;s allowance of women&#x27;s liberation from a capitalist and bourgeois control and emphasizing women&#x27;s suffrage in the working-class.

Critics like Kollontai believed liberal feminism would undermine the efforts of Marxism to improve conditions for the working class. Marxists supported the more radical political program of liberating women through socialist revolution, with a special emphasis on work among women and in materially changing their conditions after the revolution. Additional liberation methods supported by Marxist feminists include radical &quot;Utopian Demands&quot;, coined by Maria Mies. This indication of the scope of revolution required to promote change states that demanding anything less than complete reform will produce inadequate solutions to long-term issues.

<text>Onyame, Nyankopon (Onyankapon) or Odomankoma is the supreme god of the Akan people of Ghana, who is most commonly known as Anyame. The name means &quot;The one who knows and sees everything&quot;, and &quot;omniscient, omnipotent sky deity&quot; in the Akan language.

== Names ==

=== Odomankoma ===
The name Odomankoma means &quot;Creator&quot; which is said to be derived from the literal translations of the two sections of his name, &quot;Dom&quot; (meaning state or universe) and &quot;Anko-ma&quot; (meaning &quot;who alone gives&quot;). The name &quot;Odomankoma&quot; therefore means, in the literal sense, &quot;The only one who gives the universe or world&quot;. However, others believe Odomankoma is an abbreviation of Odomankoma&#x27;s full and true name: O-doma-ara-nko-ma in which all parts of the name (excluding the first o) has a meaning: &quot;Doma&quot; meaning &#x27;abundance&#x27;, &quot;nko&quot; meaning &quot;only&quot; or &quot;alone&quot;, &quot;ma&quot; meaning &quot;full of&quot;, coming together to mean &quot;The one who is uninterruptedly, infinitely, and exclusively full of the manifold, namely, the interminable, eternally, infinitely, universally filled entity&#x27;. 

Odomankoma is also known by the name Odomankoma wuo, which means &quot;The Creator&#x27;s death&quot;, referencing Odomankoma as the creator of Death (Owuo), later being killed in return. Odomankoma also goes by various other epithets: &quot;Oboade&quot; meaning &quot;Creator&quot;, &quot;Oboo nkwa&quot; meaning &quot;The Creator of life&quot;, and &quot;Oboo-wuo&quot; meaning &quot;The Creator of death&quot;, which once again references to Odomankoma creating Owuo.

Odomankoma also bears the epithets &quot;Borebore&quot;, meaning &quot;Architect&quot;, and &quot;Ananse Kokuroko&quot;, meaning &quot;The great designer&quot; or, if interpreted literally, &quot;The great spider&quot;. This name shows that beyond the fact that Odomankoma possesses a Godly level of wisdom as in the Akom belief, it is believed that the wisdom of the spider is greater than that of all the world. It also shows his connection to Ananse, who is a spider and additionally might be directly Odomankoma&#x27;s son. Odomankoma is also known as &quot;Amaomee&quot; meaning &quot;The giver of plenty&quot;, linking to him being the creator in the Akom religion.

=== Onyankapon ===
The name Onyankapon literally means &quot;The Only Great Onyame&quot; which is said to be derived from the 3 parts that supposedly make up Onyankapon&#x27;s name: &quot;Onyame&quot; shortened to &quot;Onyan&quot;, &quot;Koro&quot; shortened to &quot;Ka&quot; meaning one and &quot;Pon(g)&quot; meaning great. His full name is Onyankapong.

Onyankapon also goes by other epithets: Otumfoo meaning &quot;the powerful one&quot;, Otweadeapon Kwame meaning &quot;the Great one who appeared on Saturday&quot; symbolising that was born on a Saturday and Twidiampon(g) meaning &quot;all powerful Nyankapon(g) and Amowia meaning &quot;The giver of the sun&quot;, referencing to Nyankapon&#x27;s link to the sun. Onyankopon also shares names with Odomankoma as Odomankoma became the spirit of Onyankapon after Owuo killed Odomankoma, so along with other names for Odomankoma, the names Opanyin or Nana are used, meaning &quot;Grand Ancestor&quot;. Nyankapon might also be the Fante patron God Bobowissi, as well as the God stated as the supreme God in other traditional religions of peoples in Akan dominated countries such as Ivory Coast and Ghana specifically. However, they could either be their own Supreme God or Onyame, another aspect of the Akom Trinity and the parent to Onyankapon.

== Description ==
Odomankoma is an epithet referencing the creative traits, corresponding to reason, reality and the Absolute, is the spirit of the Universe and is one of the most dynamic and complex modalities of the trinity. Odomankoma is consistently cast in the role of creator. This creative function of Odomankoma is embodied in several maxims. One saying of the Akan surrounding Odomankoma is &quot;Odomankoma boo ade&quot;, meaning Odomankoma created the &quot;Thing&quot; (the universe). Odomankoma created not only the &quot;Thing,&quot; i.e., the universe. He also created life and created death as well. Mysteriously Odomankoma himself succumbed to death. This juxtaposition of life (himself, the creator) with death in Odomankoma is expressed by the most enigmatic and unutterable of all Akan maxims: &quot;Odomankoma boo owuo na owuo kum no&quot;, which means Odomankoma created death (Owuo) and death killed him. Odomankoma accommodates the contraries of life and death within his being. As the creator of both life and death, he transcends both experiences. The story of Odomankoma does not end with Owuo killing him as after his death, it is said that life (himself, as he is the creator) came to him and woke him up. From here he revived as Kra, and lives through Nyankapon, becoming Nyankapon&#x27;s sunsum (soul), as stated in the Akan maxim &quot;Onyankapon onye Odomankoma sunsum&quot; which means Nyankapon is Odomankoma&#x27;s personality, symbolising that Nyankapon is Odomankoma&#x27;s successor (as Odomankoma used to be the aspect of the Nyame trinity that controlled everything until Owuo killed him). Odomankoma is also powerful and smart as after his &quot;revival&quot;, Nyankapon/Odomankoma had a great struggle with Owuo in which they defeat Owuo with resistance to Owuo&#x27;s venom, kra (whom was now Odomankoma). Odomankoma then managed to achieve a total triumph over Death, as stated in the maxim &quot;Odomankoma na orna owuo di akane&quot;, which means it was none but Odomankoma who made Death eat poison. In this second meeting between Odomankoma and his final creation, Owuo, Odomankoma unleashes his creative might upon Owuo as, after having been vanquished, death is made to eat his poison. However, despite defeating Owuo, Owuo is still alive and causes death to mortals.

It is said that he talks through a drum and has a drummer for that drum called Odomankoma Kyerema, the Drummer of Odomankoma who is said to be the most knowledgeable person regarding Asante traditional history. Odomankoma has a set of stories and tales called Adomankomasem, similar to Ananse.

Odomankoma is also represented by two animals: vultures and spiders. Odomankoma&#x27;s link to vultures is expressed in the Akan maxim: &quot;Odomankoma a oboadee, ne kyeneboa ne opete&quot;, meaning the animal that symbolizes Odomankoma who created the world is the vulture. The spider connotation comes the belief by the Akan that spiders are the wisest of all animals, and it was possibly Ananse that advised Odomankoma to create humans. However, Odomankoma goes by the name Ananse Kokuroko, so it might have been just him. Odomankoma also has a human form, but storyteller rarely treat him as having a human form.

== Symbol==
Nyame is the Twi word for God, and the Adinkra symbol &quot;Gye Nyame&quot; means &quot;I Fear None Except God&quot;. 

The symbol has adopted a different use and meaning in today&#x27;s Akan culture due to the influence of Christianity.

<text>Mark E. Hyman is an American political commentator and former television executive. He was vice president for corporate relations for Sinclair Broadcast Group, the largest chain of local television stations in the United States, until 2005. Hyman became a visible presence during local news broadcasts over Sinclair&#x27;s stations, many of which aired on &quot;The Point—&quot;a controversial daily televised commentary presented by Hyman. In 2010, Hyman&#x27;s commentaries returned to select Sinclair-owned stations under the title &quot;Behind the Headlines with Mark Hyman&quot;.

==Biography==
Hyman is a 1981 graduate of the United States Naval Academy and was a captain in the United States Navy Reserve. He was a vice president and spokesman of Sinclair Broadcast Group and until 2000 was its lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

==&quot;The Point&quot;==
Beginning in 2001, he created conservative one-minute editorial segments called, &quot;The Point&quot; that were broadcast on many of the group&#x27;s 62 stations, at the end of local news programs.

The program became known for its political commentary. Hyman gave his opinions on topics such as perceived liberal bias in media, rise of agnosticism in America, and terrorism. During the 2004 US presidential election period he favored incumbent George W. Bush, and criticized Democratic opponent John Kerry. Sinclair Broadcast supported the US-led war in Iraq, and Hyman went to Iraq with a Sinclair news crew to find positive stories to counteract negative media coverage.

On November 2, 2006, after more than five years and 2,000 daily commentaries, Hyman announced he planned to drop his daily commentary at the end of the month, citing a desire to spend more time with his four children. The final &quot;The Point&quot; commentary aired on November 30.

==After &quot;The Point&quot;==
Hyman continues to offer his conservative opinions in print and online for &quot;American Spectator&quot; magazine. Hyman&#x27;s editorials returned to select Sinclair-owned stations in a dozen TV markets under the title &quot;Behind the Headlines with Mark Hyman&quot; in December 2010.

Hyman retired from &quot;Behind the Headlines&quot; in 2018, due to brain tumor that was later found to be non-cancerous.

He authored a book about various scandals in American history, published in October 2019: &quot;Washington Babylon: From George Washington to Donald Trump, Scandals that Rocked the Nation&quot;.

<text>James Aloysius Hickey (October 11, 1920 – October 24, 2004) was an American Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Washington from 1980 to 2000, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1988. Hickey previously served as Bishop of Cleveland from 1974 to 1980. 

Hickey presided over a significant expansion of social services for the poor and sick in the Washington region by the Archdiocese of Washington. He was also a strong critic of American foreign policy in Nicaragua and El Salvador, and an advocate for nuclear disarmament. 

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
James Hickey was born on October 11, 1920, in Midland, Michigan, to James and Agnes (née Ryan) Hickey; he had an older sister, Marie. James Hickey was a dentist who, during the Great Depression, treated patients who could not pay for their dental care. At age 13, James Hickey entered St. Joseph Minor Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He graduated as valedictorian from Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit in 1942. While in the seminary, Hickey helped provide pastoral care to migrant workers. He then attended The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. 

=== Priesthood ===
Hickey was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of Saginaw by Bishop William Murphy on June 15, 1946. He then served as an associate pastor at St. Joseph&#x27;s Parish in Saginaw, Michigan until 1947. Hickey went to Rome in 1947 to further his studies. He earned a Doctor of Canon Law degree from the Pontifical Lateran University in 1950, and a Doctor of Theology degree from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) in 1951. 

After returning to Michigan, he served as secretary to Bishop Stephen Woznicki from 1951 to 1966. He was also the founding rector of St. Paul Seminary. From 1962 to 1965, Hickey attended the Second Vatican Council in Rome as a &quot;peritus&quot; for Bishop Woznicki. Hickey was raised to the rank of domestic prelate of his holiness on October 31, 1963.

=== Auxiliary Bishop of Saginaw ===
On February 18, 1967, Hickey was appointed as auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Saginaw and titular bishop of &quot;Taraqua&quot; by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on April 14 1957, from Archbishop John Dearden, with Bishops Woznicki and Stephen Leven serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of St. Mary. Hickey selected as his episcopal motto: &quot;Veritatem In Caritate&quot;, meaning, &quot;Truth in Charity&quot; (Ephesians 4:15).

Hickey served as chairman of priestly formation within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) from 1968 to 1969. In March 1969, he became rector of the Pontifical North American College in Rome, where he would oversee the formation of American seminarians for the next five years.

===Bishop of Cleveland===
Hickey was named the eighth bishop of the Diocese of Cleveland on May 31, 1974 by Paul VI. Replacing Bishop Clarence Issenmann, he was installed on July 16 1974. During his tenure in Cleveland, Hickey was a advocate of racial unity and became active in justice issues involving El Salvador. In 1980, he traveled to El Salvador to attend the funeral of Archbishop Óscar Romero. Sister Dorothy Kazel and Jean Donovan, two women whom Hickey had commissioned to serve as missionaries in El Salvador, were later murdered there; he kept their photographs on the wall of his private chapel for the rest of his life.

===Archbishop of Washington===
Pope John Paul II appointed Hickey as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Washington on June 17, 1980. During the 1980&#x27;s, Hickey lobbied members of the United States Congress to stop sending aid to the Contra insurgents in Nicaragua. He also pushed his fellow American bishops to take strong stands against increased military spending and in favor of nuclear disarmament. Hickey was one of the first American bishops to address the issue of sexual abuse by clergy, which would become a nationwide scandal in 2002.

During the Salvadoran Civil War, Hickey opposed the Reagan administration&#x27;s support for the military government of El Salvador. In 1981, Hickey told the US House Subcommittee on Inter-American Affairs: &quot;Our position is to oppose military aid and intervention from all outside powers.&quot; He feared a Communist takeover in El Salvador but opposed sending military assistance, believing such weapons would strengthen repressive elements in security forces. In 1983, Hickey was dispatched by John Paul II on an apostolic visitation to investigate liturgical abuses in the Archdiocese of Seattle, then led by Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen. Commenting on the visitation, Hickey said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t easy, you know.&quot;

=== Cardinal ===
John Paul II created Hickey as cardinal priest of &quot;Santa Maria Madre del Redentore a Tor Bella Monaca&quot; in the consistory of June 28, 1988. At that point, Hickey was one of thirteen Americans in the College of Cardinals. That same year, Hickey was invited to lead a retreat for the pope and his household. Within the USCCB, Hickey served as chairman of the Committee on Doctrine (1979–81), of the Committee on Human Values (1984–1987), and of the Committee on the Pontifical North American College (1989–1991; 1994–1997).

Hickey&#x27;s tenure in Washington D.C. oversaw a significant expansion of Catholic Charities, which became the region&#x27;s largest private social service agency. He also established:

* The Archdiocesan Health Care Network 
* The Archdiocesan Legal Network, which provides &quot;pro bono&quot; care for the region&#x27;s low income residents 
* Birthing and Care, which provides pre-natal, delivery and post-natal medical care to women in financial need
* Faith in the City, an initiative to revitalize inner-city Catholic schools 
* Victory Housing, which develops assisted and independent living for senior citizens 

In conjunction with Mother Teresa, Hickey also founded a Washington convent of the Missionaries of Charity for the care of the homeless and terminally ill. He once declared, &quot;We serve the homeless not because they are Catholic, but because we are Catholic. If we don&#x27;t care for the sick, educate the young, care for the homeless, then we cannot call ourselves the church of Jesus Christ.&quot;Hickey resigned as archbishop on November 21, 2000, after twenty years of service.

==Views==

In addition to his social activism, Hickey was known for his orthodox views regarding Catholic doctrine.

===LBGT ministries===
Hickey ordered New Ways Ministry, an unauthorized ministry for LGBT Catholics, to stop any operations on archdiocese property in the early 1980s. He also forced Georgetown University to stop DignityUSA, a national LBGT ministry organization, from celebrating Mass on campus in 1987. 

=== Liturgical abuses ===
Hickey complained about liturgical abuses at Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown, even sending then auxiliary bishop William E. Lori to investigate the Jesuit-run parish.

===Contraception and abortion===
Hickey halted archdiocesan funding for a crisis pregnancy center in College Park, Maryland, after it declined to stop dispensing contraceptives.

===Dissident clergy===
As chancellor of The Catholic University of America, Hickey handled the ouster of theologian Charles Curran from the university&#x27;s faculty in 1987. Curran had dissented from the church position on contraceptives In 1989, Hickey excommunicated African-American priest George Stallings, a one-time protégé, after Stallings formed the unauthorized Imani Temple African-American Catholic Congregation.

===HIV/AIDS===
Hickey and Rev. Michael Peterson, a gay psychiatrist dying from AIDS on whom Hickey had relied for advice in treating pedophile priests, wrote a joint letter in 1987 to the American bishops acknowledging Peterson&#x27;s diagnosis; Hickey wrote, &quot;Father Peterson&#x27;s illness reminds us in a personal way of the terrible human tragedy of AIDS in our midst. His suffering challenges us to reach out with renewed conviction and compassion to those with AIDS and their families and friends.&quot;

===Capital punishment===
In early 2000, following on the Pope&#x27;s calls for Catholics to oppose capital punishment, Hickey appealed to Maryland Governor Parris Glendening to commute the death sentence of Eugene Colvin-El.

===Labor===
While Archbishop of Washington, Hickey ordered all large scale building projects in the archdiocese to be union jobs.

==Death==
Hickey died at the Jeanne Jugan Home of the Little Sisters of the Poor in Washington, D.C., at age 84. Following a funeral Mass at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, he was buried in St. Francis Chapel at St. Matthew&#x27;s Cathedral. When asked by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1989 what he would like people to say about him after his death, Hickey replied, &quot;First, I&#x27;d like them to say that he was always loyal to his Church. Second, that he was a friend to Catholic education. And third, if they don&#x27;t want to say the first two, at least I hope they would chisel on the stone, &#x27;He served the poor.&#x27;&quot;According to a 2020 Vatican report, Hickey failed to act on credible accusations of sexual abuse against then-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and continued to offer his support and endorsement to McCarrick. While this assertion assumes the reader never read the 461-page document in which no such accusations were made, any reference to Hickey&#x27;s supposed support was the following, &quot;He (McCarrick) welcomed prominent prelates to the new Diocese, including Archbishop Laghi,124 Archbishop James A. Hickey,125 Sebastiano Cardinal Baggio,126 and Joseph Cardinal Bernardin ...While the Nunciature has been aware of these accusations, the Nuncio has affirmed that they have been investigated and not substantiated, and is basically convinced that they are not really credible. Nevertheless, this Dicastery would note that, in his letter of April 4, 1994, while Cardinal James Hickey mentions that [McCarrick] should be presumed innocent, he wrote: “All this does not completely eliminate the possibility of some wrongdoing; my counsel is to proceed very slowly and cautiously”

<doc id="1099382" wikidata="Q2495073" url="?curid=1099382" title="Kōji Morimoto">
<text>is a Japanese anime director. Some of his works include being an animator in the &quot;Akira&quot; film; shorts in &quot;Robot Carnival&quot;, &quot;Short Peace&quot;, and &quot;The Animatrix&quot;; and key animation in anime such as &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;, &quot;City Hunter&quot;, and &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;. He is the co-founder of Studio 4°C. He has hosted the independent creative team &quot;phy&quot; since 2009.

==Biography==
Born in Wakayama, Japan, he graduated from the Osaka Designers&#x27; college in 1979 and a couple of years later joined the studio Annapuru as an animator for the TV series &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Joe&quot;. While working there, he saw some animation by Takashi Nakamura in &quot;Gold Lightan&quot;, an otherwise standard mecha TV series by a rival studio. He was impressed, and it inspired him to quit his job and become a freelance animator.

Morimoto often collaborated with Nakamura, most notably in Katsuhiro Otomo’s &quot;The Order to Stop Construction&quot; segment of the anthology film &quot;Neo-Tokyo&quot;. This opened many doors for him, from working as animation director on Otomo&#x27;s landmark feature &quot;Akira&quot; and a chance to direct a short for the &quot;Robot Carnival&quot; anthology. Around this time he founded Studio 4°C with producer Eiko Tanaka and fellow animator Yoshiharu Sato.

Since then, Morimoto has focused almost exclusively on his directing work. His work became increasingly unusual with time. This is best represented by the concert scenes in &quot;Macross Plus&quot; and his short film &quot;Noiseman Sound Insect&quot;.

Aside from a small cult following, his films have been ignored outside Japan. This has begun to change in recent years, with his artwork being featured in Takashi Murakami&#x27;s Superflat exhibitions worldwide, the Proto Anime Cut exhibition, and was invited by The Wachowskis to direct &quot;Beyond&quot;, a segment of &quot;The Animatrix&quot;. He is currently working on &quot;Sachiko&quot;, his second feature-length film.

<doc id="1099383" wikidata="Q738797" url="?curid=1099383" title="Joseph Bramah">
<text>Joseph Bramah (13 April 1748 – 9 December 1814) was an English inventor and locksmith. He is best known for having improved the flush toilet and inventing the hydraulic press. Along with William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong, he can be considered one of the two fathers of hydraulic engineering.

==Early life==
Joseph Bramah was the second son in the family of Joseph Bramma (note the different spelling of the surname), a farmer, and his wife, Mary Denton. He was educated at the local school in Silkstone in South Yorkshire, and on leaving school he was apprenticed to a local carpenter. On completing his apprenticeship he moved to London, where he started work as a cabinet-maker. In 1783 he married Mary Lawton of Mapplewell, near Barnsley, and the couple set up home in London. They subsequently had a daughter and four sons. The couple lived first at 124 Piccadilly, but later moved to Eaton Street, Pimlico.

==Improved water closet==
In London, Bramah worked for a Mr Allen, installing water closets (toilets) which were designed to a patent obtained by Alexander Cumming in 1775. He found that the current model being installed in London houses had a tendency to freeze in cold weather. Although it was Allen who improved the design by replacing the usual slide valve with a hinged flap that sealed the bottom of the bowl, 
Bramah obtained the patent for it in 1778, and began making toilets at a workshop in Denmark Street, St Giles.

==Bramah Locks company==

After attending some lectures on technical aspects of locks, Bramah designed a lock of his own, receiving a patent for it in 1784. In the same year he started the Bramah Locks company at 124 Piccadilly, which is today based in Fitzrovia, London and Romford, Essex.

The locks produced by his company were famed for their resistance to lock picking and tampering, and the company famously had a &quot;Challenge Lock&quot; displayed in the window of their London shop from 1790 mounted on a board containing the inscription:

&quot;The artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock shall receive 200 guineas the moment it is produced.&quot;

The challenge stood for over 67 years until, at the Great Exhibition of 1851, the American locksmith Alfred Charles Hobbs was able to open the lock and, following some argument about the circumstances under which he had opened it, was awarded the prize. Hobbs&#x27; attempt required some 51 hours, spread over 16 days.

The Challenge Lock is in the Science Museum in London. An examination of the lock shows that it has been rebuilt since Hobbs picked it. Originally it had 18 iron slides and 1 central spring; it now has 13 steel slides, each with its own spring.

Bramah received a second patent for a lock design in 1798.

==Machine tools==

Partly due to the precision requirements of his locks, Bramah spent much time developing machine tools to assist manufacturing processes. He relied heavily on the expertise of Henry Maudslay whom he employed in his workshop from the age of 18. Between them they created a number of innovative machines that made the production of Bramah&#x27;s locks more efficient, and were applicable to other fields of manufacture.

Just before Bramah died, his workshops also employed Joseph Clement who among other things made several contributions in the field of lathe design.

==Hydraulic press==
Bramah&#x27;s most important invention was the hydraulic press. The hydraulic press depends on Pascal&#x27;s principle, that pressure change throughout a closed system is constant. The press had two cylinders and pistons of different cross-sectional areas. If a force was exerted on the smaller piston, this would be translated into a larger force on the larger piston. The difference in the two forces would be proportional to the difference in area of the two pistons. In effect the cylinders act in a similar way that a lever is used to increase the force exerted. Bramah was granted a patent for his hydraulic press in 1795.

Bramah&#x27;s hydraulic press had many industrial applications and still does today. At the time Bramah was bringing his concepts to fruition, the field of hydraulic engineering was an almost unknown science. Bramah and William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong were the two pioneers in the field.

The hydraulic press is still known as the Bramah Press after its inventor.

==Other inventions==
Bramah was a very prolific inventor, though not all of his inventions were as important as his hydraulic press. They included: a beer engine (1797), a planing machine (1802), a paper-making machine (1805), a machine for automatically printing bank notes with sequential serial numbers (1806), and a machine for making quill pen nibs (1809). He also patented the first extrusion process for making lead pipes and also machinery for making gun stocks (Patent No. 2652).
His greatest contribution to engineering was his insistence on quality control. He realised that for engines to succeed, they would have to be machined to a much better standard than was the practice. He taught the Cornish engineer Arthur Woolf to machine engines to a close tolerance. This enabled Cornish engines to run with high-pressure steam, vastly increasing their output. Woolf became the leading Cornish steam engineer and his designs were adopted by all the engine designers of the day. The 15-HP engines of Watt and others of circa 1800 gave way to 450-HP engines by 1835. Bramah can be viewed as a founding father in industrial quality control.

==Death and legacy==
One of Bramah&#x27;s last inventions was a hydrostatic press capable of uprooting trees. This was put to work at Holt Forest in Hampshire. While superintending this work Bramah caught a cold, which developed into pneumonia. He died at Holt Forest on 9 December 1814. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary on Paddington Green Church.

The historian Ian Mortimer summarises Bramah thus:

&quot;“Joseph Bramah - that blessing of a genius who gives us the modern flushing loo - is also the inventor of the beer pump. Few people in history can claim to have done so much for our physical comfort - both in filling ourselves up at one end and in emptying ourselves at the other.”&quot;

The Brazilian Brahma beer brand is named for him. In 2006, a pub in Barnsley town centre was opened named the Joseph Bramah in his memory.

Bramah was a prolific inventor, and obtained 18 patents for his designs between 1778 and 1812.

<text>Akhil Bharatiya Sena (&quot;lit.&quot; All India Army) is a political party founded in 1997 in Mumbai, Maharashtra by Arun Gawli (alias &#x27;Daddy&#x27;). Gawli had earlier been close to the Shiv Sena supremo, Bal Thackeray, but in 1996 a bloody feud surged between them when Arun Gawli mercilessly slew several Sena party legislators and party workers. Gawli then formed a separate party.

In the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections 2002 the ABS candidate Sunil Ghate defeated the Sena candidate in Gawli&#x27;s home turf.
Ghate is today the sole ABS corporator in BMC.

In the Lok Sabha elections 2004 Gawli got 92,210 votes (26.5%) in the constituency Mumbai South Central.

In the Maharashtra state assembly elections later the same year ABS launched 20 candidates. One (Gawli) got elected.

The trade union wing of ABS is called Akhil Bharatiya Kamgar Sena.

In 2007 BMC elections (Mumbai city council) ABS won 2 seat. His daughter Geeta Gawali won and became corporator on ABS ticket.
In 2009 ABS supported Congress party and its candidate Milind Deora on Mumbai South.
In 2010 Arun Gawali and all his candidates lost the election for (vidhan sabha) Maharashtra Assembly election.
In 2017 new candidate Santosh (Henry) Alfred DSaoza joined Akhil Bhartiya Sena from Ward No 209. However, he lost the election and he is now Byculla Taluka Adhyaksha.

Currently, Gawali is lodged in jail.

<doc id="1099391" wikidata="Q1895998" url="?curid=1099391" title="Polypharmacy">
<text>Polypharmacy (polypragmasia) is an umbrella term to describe the simultaneous use of multiple medicines by a patient for their conditions. The term polypharmacy is often defined as regularly taking five or more medicines but there is no standard definition and the term has also been used in the context of when a person is prescribed 2 or more medications at the same time. Polypharmacy may be the consequence of having multiple long-term conditions, also known as multimorbidity and is more common in people who are older. In some cases, an excessive number of medications at the same time is worrisome, especially for people who are older with many chronic health conditions, because this increases the risk of an adverse event in that population. In many cases, polypharmacy cannot be avoided, but &#x27;appropriate polypharmacy&#x27; practices are encouraged to decrease the risk of adverse effects. Appropriate polypharmacy is defined as the practice of prescribing for a person who has multiple conditions or complex health needs by ensuring that medications prescribed are optimized and follow &#x27;best evidence&#x27; practices. 

The prevalence of polypharmacy is estimated to be between 10% and 90% depending on the definition used, the age group studied, and the geographic location. Polypharmacy continues to grow in importance because of aging populations. Many countries are experiencing a fast growth of the older population, 65 years and older. This growth is a result of the baby-boomer generation getting older and an increased life expectancy as a result of ongoing improvement in health care services worldwide. About 21% of adults with intellectual disability are also exposed to polypharmacy. The level of polypharmacy has been increasing in the past decades. Research in the USA shows that the percentage of patients greater than 65 years-old using more than 5 medications increased from 24% to 39% between 1999 and 2012. Similarly, research in the UK found that the number of older people taking 5 plus medication had quadrupled from 12% to nearly 50% between 1994 and 2011.

Polypharmacy is not necessarily ill-advised, but in many instances can lead to negative outcomes or poor treatment effectiveness, often being more harmful than helpful or presenting too much risk for too little benefit. Therefore, health professionals consider it a situation that requires monitoring and review to validate whether all of the medications are still necessary. Concerns about polypharmacy include increased adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, prescribing cascade, and higher costs. A prescribing cascade occurs when a person is prescribed a drug and experiences an adverse drug effect that is misinterpreted as a new medical condition, so the patient is prescribed another drug. Polypharmacy also increases the burden of medication taking particularly in older people and is associated with medication non-adherence.

Polypharmacy is often associated with a decreased quality of life, including decreased mobility and cognition. Patient factors that influence the number of medications a patient is prescribed include a high number of chronic conditions requiring a complex drug regimen. Other systemic factors that impact the number of medications a patient is prescribed include a patient having multiple prescribers and multiple pharmacies that may not communicate.

Whether or not the advantages of polypharmacy (over taking single medications or monotherapy) outweigh the disadvantages or risks depends upon the particular combination and diagnosis involved in any given case. The use of multiple drugs, even in fairly straightforward illnesses, is not an indicator of poor treatment and is not necessarily overmedication. Moreover, it is well accepted in pharmacology that it is impossible to accurately predict the side effects or clinical effects of a combination of drugs without studying that particular combination of drugs in test subjects. Knowledge of the pharmacologic profiles of the individual drugs in question does not assure accurate prediction of the side effects of combinations of those drugs; and effects also vary among individuals because of genome-specific pharmacokinetics. Therefore, deciding whether and how to reduce a list of medications (deprescribe) is often not simple and requires the experience and judgment of a practicing clinician, as the clinician must weigh the pros and cons of keeping the patient on the medication. However, such thoughtful and wise review is an ideal that too often does not happen, owing to problems such as poorly handled care transitions (poor continuity of care, usually because of siloed information), overworked physicians and other clinical staff, and interventionism.

==Appropriate medical uses==
While polypharmacy is typically regarded as undesirable, prescription of multiple medications can be appropriate and therapeutically beneficial in some circumstances. “Appropriate polypharmacy” is described as prescribing for complex or multiple conditions in such a way that necessary medicines are used based on the best available evidence at the time to preserve safety and well-being. Polypharmacy is clinically indicated in some chronic conditions, for example in diabetes mellitus, but should be discontinued when evidence of benefit from the prescribed drugs no longer outweighs potential for harm (described below in Contraindications).

Often certain medications can interact with others in a positive way specifically intended when prescribed together, to achieve a greater effect than any of the single agents alone. This is particularly prominent in the field of anesthesia and pain management – where atypical agents such as antiepileptics, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, NMDA antagonists, and other medications are combined with more typical analgesics such as opioids, prostaglandin inhibitors, NSAIDS and others. This practice of pain management drug synergy is known as an &quot;analgesia sparing&quot; effect.

===Examples===
* A legitimate treatment regimen in the first year after a myocardial infarction may include: a statin, an ACE inhibitor, a beta-blocker, aspirin, paracetamol and an antidepressant.
* In anesthesia (particularly IV anesthesia and general anesthesia) multiple agents are almost always required – including hypnotics or analgesic inducing/maintenance agents such as midazolam or propofol, usually an opioid analgesic such as morphine or fentanyl, a paralytic such as vecuronium, and in inhaled general anesthesia generally a halogenated ether anesthetic such as sevoflurane or desflurane.

== Special populations ==
People who are at greatest risk for negative polypharmacy consequences include elderly people, people with psychiatric conditions, patients with intellectual or developmental disabilities, people taking five or more drugs at the same time, those with multiple physicians and pharmacies, people who have been recently hospitalized, people who have concurrent comorbidities, people who live in rural communities, people with inadequate access to education, and those with impaired vision or dexterity. Marginalized populations may have a greater degrees of polypharmacy, which can occur more frequently in younger age groups.

It is not uncommon for people who are dependent or addicted to substances to enter or remain in a state of polypharmacy misuse. About 84% of prescription drug misusers reported using multiple drugs. Note, however, that the term &quot;polypharmacy&quot; and its variants generally refer to legal drug use as-prescribed, even when used in a negative or critical context.

Measures can be taken to limit polypharmacy to its truly legitimate and appropriate needs. This is an emerging area of research, frequently called deprescribing. Reducing the number of medications, as part of a clinical review, can be an effective healthcare intervention. Clinical pharmacists can perform drug therapy reviews and teach physicians and their patients about drug safety and polypharmacy, as well as collaborating with physicians and patients to correct polypharmacy problems. Similar programs are likely to reduce the potentially deleterious consequences of polypharmacy such as adverse drug events, non-adherence, hospital admissions, drug-drug interactions, geriatric syndromes, and mortality. Such programs hinge upon patients and doctors informing pharmacists of other medications being prescribed, as well as herbal, over-the-counter substances and supplements that occasionally interfere with prescription-only medication. Staff at residential aged care facilities have a range of views and attitudes towards polypharmacy that, in some cases, may contribute to an increase in medication use.

==Risks of polypharmacy==
The risk of polypharmacy increases with age, although there is some evidence that it may decrease slightly after age 90 years. Poorer health is a strong predictor of polypharmacy at any age, although it is unclear whether the polypharmacy causes the poorer health or if polypharmacy is used because of the poorer health. It appears possible that the risk factors for polypharmacy may be different for younger and middle-aged people compared to older people.

The use of polypharmacy is correlated to the use of potentially inappropriate medications. Potentially inappropriate medications are generally taken to mean those that have been agreed upon by expert consensus, such as by the Beers Criteria. These medications are generally inappropriate for older adults because the risks outweigh the benefits. Examples of these include urinary anticholinergics used to treat incontinence; the associated risks, with anticholinergics, include constipation, blurred vision, dry mouth, impaired cognition, and falls. Many older people living in long term care facilities experience polypharmacy, and under-prescribing of potentially indicated medicines and use of high risk medicines can also occur. Medicine use rises from 6.0 ± 3.8 regular medicines on average when people enter long term care to 8.9 ± 4.1 regular medicines after two years.

Polypharmacy is associated with an increased risk of falls in elderly people. Certain medications are well known to be associated with the risk of falls, including cardiovascular and psychoactive medications. There is some evidence that the risk of falls increases cumulatively with the number of medications. Although often not practical to achieve, withdrawing all medicines associated with falls risk can halve an individual&#x27;s risk of future falls.

Every medication has potential adverse side-effects. With every drug added, there is an additive risk of side-effects. Also, some medications have interactions with other substances, including foods, other medications, and herbal supplements. 15% of older adults are potentially at risk for a major drug-drug interaction. Older adults are at a higher risk for a drug-drug interaction due to the increased number of medications prescribed and metabolic changes that occur with aging. When a new drug is prescribed, the risk of interactions increases exponentially. Doctors and pharmacists aim to avoid prescribing medications that interact; often, adjustments in the dose of medications need to be made to avoid interactions. For example, warfarin interacts with many medications and supplements that can cause it to lose its effect.

===Pill burden===
Pill burden is the number of pills (tablets or capsules, the most common dosage forms) that a person takes on a regular basis, along with all associated efforts that increase with that number - like storing, organizing, consuming, and understanding the various medications in one&#x27;s regimen. The use of individual medications is growing faster than pill burden. A recent study found that older adults in long term care are taking an average of 14 to 15 tablets every day.

Poor medical adherence is a common challenge among individuals who have increased pill burden and are subject to polypharmacy. It also increases the possibility of adverse medication reactions (side effects) and drug-drug interactions. High pill burden has also been associated with an increased risk of hospitalization, medication errors, and increased costs for both the pharmaceuticals themselves and for the treatment of adverse events. Finally, pill burden is a source of dissatisfaction for many patients and family carers.

High pill burden was commonly associated with antiretroviral drug regimens to control HIV, and is also seen in other patient populations. For instance, adults with multiple common chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, lymphedema, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, and clinical depression may be prescribed more than a dozen different medications daily. The combination of multiple drugs has been associated with an increased risk of adverse drug events.

Reducing pill burden is recognized as a way to improve medication compliance, also referred to as adherence. This is done through &quot;deprescribing&quot;, where the risks and benefits are weighed when considering whether to continue a medication. This includes drugs such as bisphosphonates (for osteoporosis), which are often taken indefinitely although there is only evidence to use it for five to ten years. Patient educational programs, reminder messages, medication packaging, and the use of memory tricks has also been seen to improve adherence and reduce pill burden in several countries. These include associating medications with mealtimes, recording the dosage on the box, storing the medication in a special place, leaving it in plain sight in the living room, or putting the prescription sheet on the refrigerator. The development of applications has also shown some benefit in this regard. The use of a polypill regimen, such as combination pill for HIV treatment, as opposed to a multi-pill regimen, also alleviates pill burden and increases adherence. 

The selection of long-acting active ingredients over short-acting ones may also reduce pill burden. For instance, ACE inhibitors are used in the management of hypertension. Both captopril and lisinopril are examples of ACE inhibitors. However, lisinopril is dosed once a day, whereas captopril may be dosed 2-3 times a day. Assuming that there are no contraindications or potential for drug interactions, using lisinopril instead of captopril may be an appropriate way to limit pill burden.

== Interventions ==
The most common intervention to help people who are struggling with polypharmacy is deprescribing. Deprescribing can be confused with medication simplification, which does not attempt to reduce the number of medicines but rather reduce the number of dose forms and administration times. Deprescribing refers to reducing the number of medications that a person is prescribed and includes the identification and discontinuance of medications when the benefit no longer outweighs the harm. In elderly patients, this can commonly be done as a patient becomes more frail and treatment focus needs to shift from preventative to palliative. Deprescribing is feasible and effective in many settings including residential care, communities and hospitals. This preventative measure should be considered for anyone who exhibits one of the following: (1) a new symptom or adverse event arises, (2) when the person develops an end-stage disease, (3) if the combination of drugs is risky, or (4) if stopping the drug does not alter the disease trajectory.

Several tools exist to help physicians decide when to deprescribe and what medications can be added to a pharmaceutical regimen. The Beers Criteria and the STOPP/START criteria help identify medications that have the highest risk of adverse drug events (ADE) and drug-drug interactions. The Medication appropriateness tool for comorbid health conditions during dementia (MATCH-D) is the only tool available specifically for people with dementia, and also cautions against polypharmacy and complex medication regimens. 

Barriers faced by both physicians and people taking the medications have made it challenging to apply deprescribing strategies in practice. For physicians, these include fear of consequences of deprescribing, the prescriber&#x27;s own confidence in their skills and knowledge to deprescribe, reluctance to alter medications that are prescribed by specialists, the feasibility of deprescribing, lack of access to all of patients&#x27; clinical notes, and the complexity of having multiple providers. For patients who are prescribed or require the medication, barriers include attitudes or beliefs about the medications, inability to communicate with physicians, fears and uncertainties surrounding deprescribing, and influence of physicians, family, and the media. Barriers can include other health professionals or carers, such as in residential care, believing that the medicines are required.

In people with multiple long-term conditions (multimorbidity) and polypharmacy deprescribing represents a complex challenge as clinical guidelines are usually developed for single conditions. In these cases tools and guidelines like the Beers Criteria and STOPP/START could be used safely by clinicians but not all patients might benefit from stopping their medication. There is a need for clarity about how much clinicians can do beyond the guidelines and the responsibility they need to take could help them prescribing and deprescribing for complex cases. Further factors that can help clinicians tailor their decisions to the individual are: access to detailed data on the people in their care (including their backgrounds and personal medical goals), discussing plans to stop a medicine already when it is first prescribed, and a good relationship that involves mutual trust and regular discussions on progress. Furthermore, longer appointments for prescribing and deprescribing would allow time explain the process of deprescribing, explore related concerns, and support making the right decisions.

The effectiveness of specific interventions to improve the appropriate use of polypharmacy such as pharmaceutical care and computerised decision support is unclear. This is due to low quality of current evidence surrounding these interventions. High quality evidence is needed to make any conclusions about the effects of such interventions in any environment, including in care homes. Deprescribing is not influenced by whether medicines are prescribed through a paper-based or an electronic system. Deprescribing rounds has been proposed as a potentially successful methodology in reducing polypharmacy. Sharing of positive outcomes from physicians who have implemented deprescribing, increased communication between all practitioners involved in patient care, higher compensation for time spent deprescribing, and clear deprescribing guidelines can help enable the practice of deprescribing. Despite the difficulties, a recent blinded study of deprescribing reported that participants used an average of two fewer medicines each after 12 months showing again that deprescribing is feasible.

<text>Near-death studies is a field of psychology and psychiatry that studies the physiology, phenomenology and after-effects of the near-death experience (NDE). The field was originally associated with a distinct group of North American researchers that followed up on the initial work of Raymond Moody, and who later established the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS) and the &quot;Journal of Near-Death Studies&quot;. Since then the field has expanded, and now includes contributions from a wide range of researchers and commentators worldwide. Research on near-death experiences is mainly limited to the disciplines of medicine, psychology and psychiatry.

==Research – history and background==

===Precursors===

Individual cases of NDEs in literature have been identified in ancient times. During the 1880s and 1890s, near-death phenomena were part of the investigation of paranormal phenomena. Precursors to the field of near-death studies include the work of paranormal investigators, such as William Crookes and Frederick W.H. Myers, and the work of parapsychological societies, such as the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in England, and its American counterpart. The work attracted skepticism from contemporary branches of science. Also in the 1800s, two efforts moved beyond studying individual cases—one privately done by Mormons and one in Switzerland.
According to sources the first academic note on a near-death experience was reported by Albert von St. Gallen Heim in 1892.

The early 1900s was a period of disinterest in the topic, only marked by occasional contributions, including the commentaries of Gardner Murphy and the research of Donald West. In 1948 West investigated the occurrence of psi-phenomena in a small sample of the British population. He found that &quot;14 percent of his sample had undergone a hallucinatory experience and 9 percent had reported seeing apparitions of the dead&quot;. During the 1970s the work of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross attracted attention and she addressed the topic publicly. Interest in the topic was also spurred by autobiographical accounts, such as the books of George Ritchie.

=== Formative period – early profiles ===

Commentators note that the launch of the field of near-death studies started with work of Raymond Moody. Moody got interested in the subject of near-death experiences at the start of his career. In the mid-seventies, while doing his medical residency as a psychiatrist at the University of Virginia, he conducted interviews with near-death experiencers. He later published these findings in the book &quot;Life After Life&quot; (1976). In the book Moody outlines the different elements of the NDE. These features were picked up by later researchers, and the book brought public attention to the topic of NDEs. N
Early contributions to the field of near-death studies also include the work of Russell Noyes, who collected NDE stories from personal accounts and medical records. According to commentators his work signalled the first big shift in perspective within the field, pulling the methodology away from parapsychology and towards the principles of medicine. In the 1970s Noyes and Kletti reported on the phenomenon of depersonalization related to life-threatening danger.
According to literature Noyes and Kletti&#x27;s 1977-article, &quot;Depersonalization in Response to Life-threatening Danger”, is the most cited article in the field of Near-death studies, as of 2011.

In 1977 a group researchers met in Charlottesville, Virginia, in order to prepare further investigations of the NDE-phenomenon. The late seventies saw the establishment of the &quot;Association for the Scientific Study of Near-Death Phenomena&quot;, an initial group of academic researchers, including John Audette, Raymond Moody, Bruce Greyson, Kenneth Ring and Michael Sabom, who laid the foundations for the field of near-death studies, and carried out some of the first NDE research in the wake of Moody&#x27;s work. The Association was a forerunner to the International Association for Near-death Studies (IANDS), which was founded in the early eighties and which established its headquarters at the University of Connecticut, Storrs. One of the first publications associated with this group of researchers was a treatment of several NDE case-reports originally collected by Fred Schoonmaker. The treatment was carried out and published by John Audette in 1979. This group of researchers, but especially Ring, was responsible for launching &quot;Anabiosis&quot;, the first peer-reviewed journal within the field. The journal later became &quot;Journal of Near-Death Studies&quot;.

Even though NDEs were introduced to the academic setting, the subject was often met with academic disbelief, or regarded as taboo. The medical community has been reluctant to address the phenomenon of NDEs, and funding for research has been limited. However, both Ring and Sabom made contributions that were influential for the newly established field. Ring published a book in 1980 called &quot;Life at Death: A Scientific Investigation of the Near-Death Experience&quot;. In the book Ring identified the core near-death experience, with its corresponding stages. This early research was followed in 1984 by Ring&#x27;s book &quot;Heading Toward Omega: In Search of the Meaning of the Near-Death Experience&quot;, where he described the mystical and transcendent features of the NDE, and the futuristic visions described by near-death experiencers. The early work of Michael Sabom also brought attention within the academic community. Besides contributing material to academic journals, he wrote a book called &quot;Recollections of Death&quot; (1982) which is considered to be a significant publication in the launching of the field.

Some of the early retrospective work was being carried out by Greyson and Stevenson who published their findings in the &quot;American Journal of Psychiatry&quot; in 1980. The authors used questionnaires, interviews, and medical records in order to study the phenomenology of NDEs and suggested that social and psychological factors explained some, but not all, components of the NDE. Greyson has also addressed different aspects of the NDE, such as the psychodynamics of the experience, the typology of NDEs, the varieties of NDEs, and the biology of NDEs. In addition, he brought attention to the NDE as a focus of clinical attention, suggesting that the aftermath of the NDE, in some cases, can lead to psychological problems. As research in the field progressed, both Greyson and Ring developed measurement tools that can be used in a clinical setting. to Kinsella, no other researcher, besides Moody, has done more to &quot;influence public opinion on the subject of NDEs&quot; than Kenneth Ring. 

The 1980s also introduced the research of Melvin Morse, who profiled near-death studies. Morse and colleagues investigated NDEs in a pediatric population. They found that children reported NDEs that were similar to those described by adults. Morse later published two books, co-authored with Paul Perry, that were aimed at a general audience: &quot;Closer to the light: learning from children&#x27;s near-death experiences&quot; (1990) and &quot;Transformed by the light: the powerful effect of near-death experiences on people&#x27;s lives&quot; (1992). British neuropsychiatrist Peter Fenwick started to collect NDE stories in the 1980s, following their appearances in television programs. The responses from near-death experiencers later served as the basis for his book published in 1997, &quot;The Truth in the light&quot;, co-authored with his wife Elizabeth Fenwick. In the book the authors investigated more than 300 NDEs and concluded that the &quot;subjective experience&quot; is the key to understanding the phenomenon of NDEs. Co-operating with other researchers, such as Sam Parnia, Fenwick has reviewed and researched the potential relationship between near-death experiences and cardiac arrest.

Early investigations into the topic of near-death experiences were also conducted at the University of Virginia, where Ian Stevenson founded the Division of Perceptual Studies in the late sixties. The division went on to produce research on a number of phenomena that were not considered to be mainstream. In addition to near-death experiences this included: reincarnation and past lives, out-of-body experiences, apparitions and after-death communications, and deathbed visions. Stevenson, whose main academic interest was the topic of reincarnation and past lives, also made contributions to the field of near-death studies. In a 1990 study, co-authored with Owens and Cook, the researchers studied the medical records of 58 people who were thought to have been near death. The authors judged 28 candidates to actually have been close to dying, while 30 candidates, who merely thought they were about to die, were judged to not have been in any medical danger. Both groups reported similar experiences, but the first group reported more features of the core NDE than the other group.

According to Loseu and colleagues, who published an analysis of the published literature in the field of near-death studies, there was a peak in the output of articles in the 15-year period between 1980 and 1995, followed by a decreasing trend.

=== Later period – new profiles, prospective studies ===

The first decades of near-death research were characterized by retrospective studies. From 1975 to 2005, some 2500 self reported individuals in the US had been reviewed in retrospective studies of the phenomena with an additional 600 outside the US in the West, and 70 in Asia. However, the late 1980s marked the beginning of prospective studies in the field. Prospective studies (which are more expensive) review groups of individuals and find who had an NDE. They had identified 270 individuals by 2005. Kovoor and colleagues performed a scoping review of research on NDE&#x27;s in Cardiac Arrest situations. They identified a total of 60 prospective studies, 11 of which were included in their review (Table 1). 

Pim van Lommel (cardiologist) was one of the first researchers to bring the study of NDEs into the area of Hospital Medicine. In 1988 he launched a prospective study that spanned 10 Dutch hospitals. 344 survivors of cardiac arrest were included in the study. 62 patients (18%) reported NDE. 41 of these patients (12%) described a core experience. The aim of the study was to investigate the cause of the experience, and assess variables connected to frequency, depth, and content. Prospective studies were also taking place in the U.S. Schwaninger and colleagues collaborated with Barnes-Jewish Hospital, where they studied cardiac arrest patients over a three-year period (April 1991 – February 1994). Only a minority of the patients survived, and from this group 30 patients were interviewable. Of these 30 patients 23% reported an NDE, while 13% reported an NDE during &quot;a prior life-threatening illness&quot;.

In a prospective study from 2001, conducted at Southampton General Hospital, Parnia and colleagues found that 11.1% of 63 cardiac-arrest survivors reported memories of their unconscious period. Several of these memories included NDE features. Greyson conducted a 30-month survey of patients admitted to the cardiac inpatient service of the University of Virginia Hospital. He found that NDEs were reported by 10% of patients with cardiac arrest and 1% of other cardiac patients. Up to 2005, 95% of world cultures have been documented making some mention of NDEs. In all, close to 3500 individual cases between 1975 and 2005 had been reviewed by some 55 researchers or teams of researchers.

During the next decade, prospective studies were also starting to emerge from other parts of the world. In a study from 2010 Klemenc-Ketis and colleagues reported on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors, later admitted to intensive care units, at medical centers in Slovenia. 21.2% of the patients in the study reported NDEs. The researchers also found that &quot;NDE occur more often in patients with higher petCO2 and pCO2&quot;; &quot;higher serum levels of potassium correlate with higher score on Greyson&#x27;s NDE scale&quot;; and &quot;NDEs occur more often in patients with previous NDEs&quot;.

The work of Jeffrey Long has also attracted attention to the topic of NDEs in both the academic, and the popular field. Long is a near death experience researcher who believes in life after death. In 2010 he released a book, co-authored with Paul Perry, called &quot;Evidence of the Afterlife: The Science of Near-Death Experiences&quot;. In the book Long presented results from research conducted over the previous decade.

Based on the results from an analysis of scholarly NDE-related periodical literature, the decade between 2001 and 2011 signaled an expansion of the field of near-death studies by including new authors and new publication venues. Research has also entered into other fields of interest, such as the mental health of military veterans. Goza, Holden &amp; Kinsey studied NDEs among combat veterans. They found, among other things, that combat soldiers reported &quot;less intense&quot; near-death experiences, compared to NDErs in the civilian population.

The first clinical paper from The AWARE-project (AWAreness during REsuscitation), another prospective study, was published in 2014. The research was a multicenter observational study including US, UK and Austrian medical sites. In the study Parnia and colleagues found that 9% of patients who completed stage 2 interviews reported experiences compatible with NDEs. A follow-up study, AWARE II, was completed in November 2022 (not yet peer-reviewed), and has resulted in 28 participants completing interviews, with 6 reporting a NDE.

As of 2011 Bruce Greyson has the greatest output of material and remains the leading scholar in the field of near-death studies. Other researchers with a large output of material includes P. M. H. Atwater and neuropsychiatrist Peter Fenwick

==Explanatory models==

Explanatory models for the phenomenology and the elements of the NDE can, according to sources, be divided into a three broad categories: psychological, physiological, and transcendental. In a study published in 1990, Owens, Cook and Stevenson presented results that lent support to all of these three interpretations. Christian Agrillo notes that literature reports two main theoretical frameworks: (1) &quot;biological/psychological&quot; (in-brain theories), or (2) &quot;survivalist&quot; (out-of-brain theories).

Each model contains a number of variables:

* Psychological theories have suggested that the NDE can be a consequence of mental and emotional reactions to the perceived threat of dying, or a result of expectation. Other psychological variables that are considered by researchers include: imagination, depersonalization, dissociation, proneness to fantasy, and the memory of being born.
* Physiological theories tend to focus on somatic, biological or pharmacological explanations for the NDE, often with an emphasis on the physiology of the brain. Variables that are considered, and often summarized by researchers, include: anoxia; cerebral hypoxia; hypercarbia; endorphins; serotonin or various neurotransmitters; temporal lobe dysfunction or seizures; the NMDA receptor; activation of the limbic system; drugs; retinal ischemia; and processes linked to rapid eye movement sleep or phenomena generated on the border between sleep and wakefullness.
* Transcendental theories, consider a number of categories that fall outside the scope of physiological or psychological explanations. This explanatory model considers whether the NDE might be related to: the existence of an afterlife, a changing state of consciousness, mystical (peak) experiences, or mind-body separation.

Several researchers in the field have expressed reservations towards explanations that are purely psychological or physiological. Van Lommel and colleagues have argued for the inclusion of transcendental categories as part of the explanatory framework. Other researchers, such as Parnia, Fenwick, and Greyson, have argued for an expanded discussion about the mind-brain relationship as well as the possibilities of human consciousness.

==Psychometrics==
Several psychometric instruments have been adapted to near-death research. Early contributions included the instruments developed by Kenneth Ring and Bruce Greyson In 1980, Ring developed the &quot;Weighted Core Experience Index&quot; in order to measure the depth of NDEs,and this index has been used by other researchers for this purpose. The index has also been used to measure the impact of near-death experiences on dialysis patients. According to some commentators the index has improved the consistency in the field. However, Greyson notes that although the index is a &quot;pioneering effort&quot;, it is not based on statistical analysis, and has not been tested for internal coherence or reliability. In 1984 Ring developed an instrument called the &quot;Life Changes Inventory&quot; (LCI) in order to quantify value changes following an NDE. The instrument was later revised and standardized and a new version, the LCI-R, was published in 2004.

Greyson developed &quot;The Near-Death Experience Scale&quot;. This 16-item scale was found to have high internal consistency, split-half reliability, and test-retest reliability and was correlated with Ring&#x27;s &quot;Weighted Core Experience Index&quot;. Questions formulated by the scale address such dimensions as: cognition (feelings of accelerated thought, or &quot;life-review&quot;), affect (feelings of peace and joy), paranormal experience (feelings of being outside of the body, or a perception of future events) and transcendence (experience of encountering deceased relatives, or experiencing an unearthly realm). A score of 7 or higher out of a possible 32 was used as the standard criterion for a near-death experience. The scale is, according to the author, clinically useful in differentiating NDEs from organic brain syndromes and nonspecific stress responses. The NDE-scale was later found to fit the Rasch rating scale model. The instrument has been used to measure NDEs among cardiac arrest survivors, coma survivors, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients/survivors, substance misusers, and dialysis patients.

In the late 1980s Thornburg developed the &quot;Near-Death Phenomena Knowledge and Attitudes Questionnaire&quot;. The questionnaire consists of 23 true/false/undecided response items assessing knowledge, 23 Likert scale items assessing general attitudes toward near-death phenomena, and 20 Likert scale items assessing attitude toward caring for a client who has had an NDE. Content validity was established by using a panel of experts selected from nursing, sociology, and psychology. The instrument was also found to satisfy the criteria for internal consistency. The instrument has been used to measure attitudes toward, and knowledge of, near-death experiences in a college population, among clergy, among registered psychologists, and among hospice nurses.

Martial and colleagues developed the &quot;Near-Death Experience Content (NDE-C) scale&quot;, a 20-item scale constructed in order to reassess the Greyson NDE-scale and to validate the new NDE-C scale. The authors found weaknesses in the original NDE-scale, but good psychometric properties for the new NDE-C scale.

Greyson has also used mainstream psychological measurements in his research, for example: &quot;The Dissociative Experiences Scale&quot;, a measure of dissociative symptoms; and &quot;The Threat Index&quot;, a measure of the threat implied by one&#x27;s personal death.

==Near death studies community==

=== Research organizations and academic locations ===

The field of near-death studies includes several communities that study the phenomenology of NDEs. One of the most influential is IANDS, an international organization based in Durham, North Carolina, US, that promotes research and education on the phenomenon of near-death experiences. Among its publications is the peer-reviewed &quot;Journal of Near-Death Studies&quot;. The organization also maintains an archive of near-death case histories for research and study.

Another research organization, the Louisiana-based Near Death Experience Research Foundation, was established by radiation oncologist Jeffrey Long in 1998. The foundation maintains a website and a database of near-death cases.

Several universities have been associated with near-death studies: the University of Connecticut (US), Southampton University (UK), University of North Texas (US) and the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University of Virginia (US).

===Conferences===

IANDS holds conferences on the topic of near-death experiences. The first meeting was a medical seminar at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, in 1982. The first clinical conference was in Pembroke Pines, Florida, and the first research conference was in Farmington, Connecticut in 1984. Since then conferences have been held in major U.S. cities, almost annually. Many of the conferences have addressed a specific topic, defined in advance of the meeting. In 2004 participants gathered in Evanston, Illinois, under the headline: &quot;Creativity from the light&quot;. A few of the conferences have been arranged at academic locations. In 2001 researchers and participants gathered at Seattle Pacific University. In 2006 the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center became the first medical institution to host the annual IANDS conference.

The first international medical conference on near-death experiences was held in 2006. Approximately 1,500 delegates, including people who claim to have had NDEs, attended the one-day conference in Martigues, France. Among the researchers at the conference were Moody and anesthetist and intensive care doctor Jean-Jacques Charbonnier.

===Relevant publications===

IANDS publishes the quarterly &quot;Journal of Near-Death Studies&quot;, the only scholarly journal in the field. IANDS also publishes &quot;Vital Signs&quot;, a quarterly newsletter that is made available to its members and that includes commentary, news and articles of general interest.

One of the first introductions to the field of near-death studies was &quot;A Collection of Near-Death Research Readings: Scientific Inquiries Into the Experiences of Persons Near Physical Death,&quot; edited by Craig R. Lundahl and released in 1982. An early general reader was &quot;The Near-Death Experience: Problems, Prospects, Perspectives,&quot; published in 1984. In 2009, the &quot;Handbook of Near-Death Experiences: thirty years of investigation&quot; was published. It was an overview of the field based on papers presented at the IANDS conference in 2006. &quot;Making Sense of Near-Death Experiences: A Handbook for Clinicians&quot; was published in 2011&quot;.&quot; The book had many contributors and described how the NDE could be handled in psychiatric and clinical practice. In 2017 the University of Missouri Press published &quot;The Science Of Near-death Experiences,&quot; a compilation of articles that were originally published in the medical journal &quot;Missouri Medicine&quot; between 2013 and 2015.

==Recognition and criticism==

According to literature the field of near-death studies is associated with discovery, challenges, and controversy. Cant and colleagues note that &quot;curiosity about the origin and prevalence of NDEs has escalated as technology and resuscitation techniques have improved&quot;. The topic attracts a lot of interest, which is reflected in search engine results, medical literature, opinion pieces and commentary. Kopel and Webb note that there has been a &quot;burgeoning literature on near-death experiences&quot;, reflecting both the naturalistic perspectives of neurology and physiology, as well as perspectives that are not naturalistic.

Skepticism towards the findings of near-death studies, and the validity of the near-death experience as a subject for scientific study, has been widespread. According to Knapton, in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the subject was, until recently, controversial. Both scientists and medical professionals have, in general, tended to be skeptical. According to commentators in the field the early study of near-death experiences was met with &quot;academic disbelief&quot;. Acceptance of NDEs as a legitimate topic for scientific study has improved, but the process has been slow. 

According to literature &quot;psychiatrists have played a role in the recognition of the &quot;near-death&quot; phenomenon as well as popularization of the subject and subsequent research&quot;. Kinsella noted that &quot;Growing scholarly interest has followed popular interest in the subject&quot;. While there is not yet any academic consensus as to what the philosophical implications of NDE studies might be, the question of whatever the true and fundamental nature of human consciousness might be yet remains both unanswered, and highly contentious. Still, NDE researchers are in general agreement that NDE research is now a legitimate academic field of scientific research, and many recent discoveries in this field give rise to the hopes by some researchers that a &quot;breakthrough&quot; in the modern day understanding of the dying process may be imminent.

Kovoor and colleagues noted that there are some &quot;methodological concerns within many of the prospective studies&quot; mapped by their scoping review. They note that: &quot;Longer-term outcomes may have been biased by clinical characteristics and comorbidities, rather than near-death experiences, and this should remain a pertinent consideration&quot;. 

Skeptics have remarked that it is difficult to verify many of the anecdotal reports that are being used as background material in order to outline the features of the NDE.

Internet Infidels commentator Keith Augustine has criticized the survivalist interpretation of NDEs. He also criticized &quot;weaknesses in the research methodology, paucity of the data, and gaps in the arguments&quot;. Greyson responded by suggesting that the materialist model favored by Augustine is supported by even less data than the &quot;mind-brain separation model&quot; favored by many researchers within the field of near-death studies.

The findings of NDE research have been contested by several writers in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. Susan Blackmore has contested the findings of NDE research, and has instead argued in favour of a neurological explanation. Psychologist Christopher French has reviewed several of the theories that have originated from the field of near-death studies. This includes theories that present a challenge to modern neuroscience by suggesting a new understanding of the mind-brain relationship in the direction of transcendental, or paranormal, elements. In reply to this French considers the conventional scientific understanding, and introduces several non-paranormal factors, as well as psychological theory, that might explain those near-death experiences that defy conventional scientific explanations. However, he does not rule out a future revision of modern neuroscience, awaiting new and improved research procedures.

Jason Braithwaite, a Senior Lecturer in Cognitive Neuroscience in the Behavioural Brain Sciences Centre, University of Birmingham, issued an in-depth analysis and critique of the survivalist&#x27;s neuroscience of some NDE researchers, concluding, &quot;it is difficult to see what one could learn from the paranormal survivalist position which sets out assuming the truth of that which it seeks to establish, makes additional and unnecessary assumptions, misrepresents the current state of knowledge from mainstream science, and appears less than comprehensive in its analysis of the available facts.&quot;

Martens noted the &quot;lack of uniform nomenclature&quot;, and &quot;the failure to control the studied population with an elimination of interfering factors&quot;, as examples of criticism directed towards near-death research. Engmann points out that NDE research does not fulfil quality criteria of medical studies, namely objectivity.

But criticism of the field has also come from commentators within its own ranks. In an open letter to the NDE community, Ring has pointed to the &quot;issue of possible religious bias in near-death studies&quot;. According to Ring, the field of near-death studies, as well as the larger NDE movement, has attracted a variety of religious and spiritual affiliations, from a number of traditions, which makes ideological claims on behalf of NDE research. In his view, this has compromised the integrity of research and discussion.

<text>In pharmaceutical sciences, drug interactions occur when a drug&#x27;s mechanism of action is affected by the concomitant administration of substances such as foods, beverages, or other drugs. A popular example of drug–food interaction is the effect of grapefruit on the metabolism of drugs. 

Interactions may occur by simultaneous targeting of receptors, directly or indirectly. For example, both Zolpidem and alcohol affect GABAA receptors, and their simultaneous consumption results in the overstimulation of the receptor, which can lead to loss of consciousness. When two drugs affect each other, it is a drug–drug interaction (DDI). The risk of a DDI increases with the number of drugs used. 

A large share of elderly people regularly use five or more medications or supplements, with a significant risk of side-effects from drug–drug interactions.

Drug interactions can be of three kinds:

* additive (the result is what you expect when you add together the effect of each drug taken independently), 
* synergistic (combining the drugs leads to a larger effect than expected), or 
* antagonistic (combining the drugs leads to a smaller effect than expected). 

It may be difficult to distinguish between synergistic or additive interactions, as individual effects of drugs may vary. 

Direct interactions between drugs are also possible and may occur when two drugs are mixed before intravenous injection. For example, mixing thiopentone and suxamethonium can lead to the precipitation of thiopentone.

== Interactions based on pharmacodynamics ==

Pharmacodynamic interactions are the drug–drug interactions that occur at a biochemical level and depend mainly on the biological processes of organisms. These interactions occur due to action on the same targets; for example, the same receptor or signaling pathway.
Pharmacodynamic interactions can occur on protein receptors. Two drugs can be considered to be &quot;homodynamic&quot;, if they act on the same receptor. Homodynamic effects include drugs that act as (1) pure agonists, if they bind to the main locus of the receptor, causing a similar effect to that of the main drug, (2) partial agonists if, on binding to a secondary site, they have the same effect as the main drug, but with a lower intensity and (3) antagonists, if they bind directly to the receptor&#x27;s main locus but their effect is opposite to that of the main drug. These may be c&quot;ompetitive antagonists&quot;, if they compete with the main drug to bind with the receptor. or u&quot;ncompetitive antagonists,&quot; when the antagonist binds to the receptor irreversibly. The drugs can be considered &quot;heterodynamic&quot; competitors, if they act on distinct receptor with similar downstream pathways.

The interaction my also occur via signal transduction mechanisms. For example, low blood glucose leads to a release of catecholamines, triggering symptoms that hint the organism to take action, like consuming sugary foods. If a patient is on insulin, which reduces blood sugar, and also beta-blockers, the body is less able to cope with an insulin overdose.

== Interactions based on pharmacokinetics ==
Pharmacokinetics is the field of research studying the chemical and biochemical factors that directly affect dosage and the half-life of drugs in an organism, including absorption, transport, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Compounds may affect any of those process, ultimately interfering with the flux of drugs in the human body, increasing or reducing drug availability. 

=== Based on absorption ===
Drugs that change intestinal motility may impact the level of other drugs taken. For example, prokinetic agents increase the intestinal motility, which may cause drugs to go through the digestive system too fast, reducing absorption. 

The pharmacological modification of pH can affect other compounds. Drugs can be present in ionized or non-ionized forms depending on pKa, and neutral compounds are usually better absorbed by membranes. Medication like antacids can increase pH and inhibit the absorption of other drugs such as zalcitabine, tipranavir and amprenavir. The opposite is more common, with, for example, the antacid cimetidine &quot;stimulating&quot; the absorption of didanosine. Some resources describe that a gap of two to four hours between taking the two drugs is needed to avoid the interaction.

Factors such as food with high-fat content may also alter the solubility of drugs and impact its absorption. This is the case for oral anticoagulants and avocado. The formation of non-absorbable complexes may occur also via chelation, when cations can make certain drugs harder to absorb, for example between tetracycline or the fluoroquinolones and dairy products, due to the presence of calcium ions. . Other drugs bind to proteins. Some drugs such as sucralfate bind to proteins, especially if they have a high bioavailability. For this reason its administration is contraindicated in enteral feeding.

Some drugs also alter absorption by acting on the P-glycoprotein of the enterocytes. This appears to be one of the mechanisms by which grapefruit juice increases the bioavailability of various drugs beyond its inhibitory activity on first pass metabolism.

=== Based on transport and distribution===
Drugs also may affect each other by competing for transport proteins in plasma, such as albumin. In these cases the drug that arrives first binds with the plasma protein, leaving the other drug dissolved in the plasma, modifying its expected concentration. The organism has mechanisms to counteract these situations (by, for example, increasing plasma clearance), and thus they are not usually clinically relevant. They may become relevant if other problems are present, such as issues with drug excretion.

=== Based on metabolism ===
Many drug interactions are due to alterations in drug metabolism. Further, human drug-metabolizing enzymes are typically activated through the engagement of nuclear receptors. One notable system involved in metabolic drug interactions is the enzyme system comprising the cytochrome P450 oxidases.

==== CYP450 ====
Cytochrome P450 is a very large family of haemoproteins (hemoproteins) that are characterized by their enzymatic activity and their role in the metabolism of a large number of drugs. Of the various families that are present in humans, the most interesting in this respect are the 1, 2 and 3, and the most important enzymes are CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4.
The majority of the enzymes are also involved in the metabolism of endogenous substances, such as steroids or sex hormones, which is also important should there be interference with these substances. The function of the enzymes can either be stimulated (enzyme induction) or inhibited (enzyme inhibition).

==== Through enzymatic inhibition and induction ====
If a drug is metabolized by a CYP450 enzyme and drug B blocks the activity of these enzymes, it can lead to pharmacokinetic alterations. A. This alteration results in drug A remaining in the bloodstream for an extended duration, and eventually increase in concentration.

In some instances, the inhibition may reduce the therapeutic effect, if instead the metabolites of the drug is responsible for the effect.

Compounds that increase the efficiency of the enzymes, on the other hand, may have the opposite effect and increase the rate of metabolism. 

==== Examples of metabolism-based interactions ====
An example of this is shown in the following table for the CYP1A2 enzyme, showing the substrates (drugs metabolized by this enzyme) and some inductors and inhibitors of its activity:

Some foods also act as inductors or inhibitors of enzymatic activity. The following table shows the most common:
=== Based on excretion ===

==== Renal and biliary excretion ====
Drugs tightly bound to proteins (i.e. not in the free fraction) are not available for renal excretion.
Filtration depends on a number of factors including the pH of the urine. Drug interactions may affect those points. 

== With herbal medicines ==
Herb-drug interactions are drug interactions that occur between herbal medicines and conventional drugs. These types of interactions may be more common than drug-drug interactions because herbal medicines often contain multiple pharmacologically active ingredients, while conventional drugs typically contain only one. Some such interactions are clinically significant, although most herbal remedies are not associated with drug interactions causing serious consequences. Most catalogued herb-drug interactions are moderate in severity. The most commonly implicated conventional drugs in herb-drug interactions are warfarin, insulin, aspirin, digoxin, and ticlopidine, due to their narrow therapeutic indices. The most commonly implicated herbs involved in such interactions are those containing St. John’s Wort, magnesium, calcium, iron, or ginkgo.

=== Examples ===
Examples of herb-drug interactions include, but are not limited to:

* St. John&#x27;s wort affects the clearance of numerous drugs, including cyclosporin, SSRI antidepressants, digoxin, indinavir, and phenprocoumon. It may also interact with the anti-cancer drugs irinotecan and imatinib.
* Salvia miltiorrhiza may enhance anticoagulation and bleeding among people taking warfarin.
* Allium sativum has been found to decrease the plasma concentration of saquinavir, and may cause hypoglycemia when taken with chlorpropamide.
* Ginkgo biloba can cause bleeding when combined with warfarin or aspirin.
* Concomitant Ephedra and caffeine use has been reported to, in rare cases, cause fatalities.

=== Mechanisms ===
The mechanisms underlying most herb-drug interactions are not fully understood. Interactions between herbal medicines and anticancer drugs typically involve enzymes that metabolize cytochrome P450. For example, St. John&#x27;s Wort has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein in vitro and in vivo.

== Underlying factors ==
The factors or conditions that predispose the appearance of interactions include factors such as old age. This is where human physiology changing with age may affect the interaction of drugs. For example, liver metabolism, kidney function, nerve transmission, or the functioning of bone marrow all decrease with age. In addition, in old age, there is a sensory decrease that increases the chances of errors being made in the administration of drugs. The elderly are also more vulnerable to polypharmacy, and the more drugs a patient takes, the higher is the chance of an interaction.

Genetic factors may also affect the enzymes and receptors, thus altering the possibilities of interactions. 

Patients with hepatic or renal diseases already may have difficulties metabolizing and excreting drugs, which may exacerbate the effect of interactions.

Some drugs present an intrinsic increased risk for a harmful interaction, including drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, where the difference between the effective dose and the toxic dose is small. The drug digoxin is an example of this type of drug. 

Risks are also increased when the drug presents a steep dose-response curve, and small changes in the dosage produce large changes in the drug&#x27;s concentration in the blood plasma.

==Epidemiology==
As of 2008, among adults in the United States of America older than 56, 4% were taking medication and/ or supplements that put them at risk of a major drug interaction. Potential drug-drug interactions have increased over time and are more common in the less-educated elderly even after controlling for age, sex, place of residence, and comorbidity.

<doc id="1099406" wikidata="Q1992204" url="?curid=1099406" title="Birdsongs of the Mesozoic">
<text>Birdsongs of the Mesozoic is an American musical group founded in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, in 1980.

The music of Birdsongs of the Mesozoic is almost entirely instrumental, and incorporates many different musical elements; critic Rick Anderson writes, &quot;Very few bands have ever managed to straddle the worlds of modern classical music and rock as successfully as this one did.&quot; In his liner notes for their &quot;Beat of the Mesozoic&quot; EP, Boston rock critic Eric Van dubbed them &quot;the world&#x27;s hardest-rocking chamber music quartet.&quot; Another memorable description came from Jim Sullivan of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;: &quot;classical-punk-jazz-car-wreck music.&quot;

==Band history==
===Origins===
Birdsongs owes its origins to the 1978 breakup of the Boston post-punk band Moving Parts, which included Erik Lindgren (vocals, keyboards) and Roger Miller (vocals, guitar). Miller went on to form the seminal post-punk group Mission of Burma (1979–1983; 2002–present), while Lindgren concentrated on production work in his home recording studio.

While the Parts&#x27; breakup had been civil, Lindgren felt the need for an act of overt reconciliation, and in late 1980, he offered free studio time to his former bandmate should Miller have any non-Burma material he wanted to record. Miller had just written his first solo piano pieces in years, and jumped at the offer. Lindgren volunteered to provide some keyboard overdubs. Given that musical differences had led to the breakup of their earlier band, both musicians were surprised at the effectiveness of the collaboration. Burma tape loop artist Martin Swope was then enlisted for further overdub work on electric guitar.

The recording project might have ended there had not Boston&#x27;s Modern Method record label approached Miller and asked for a Burma track for a compilation album. Miller instead offered &quot;Pulse Piece&quot; from the sessions, naming the makeshift group &quot;Birdsongs of the Mesozoic,&quot; a reference to a &quot;Birdsongs of America&quot; album that Swope had sampled during the sessions and to then-new theories about the dinosaur ancestry of birds (Miller having been a dinosaur aficionado as a young child). The Mesozoic era covered the period of roughly 66 million years ago to 248 million years ago, and is sometimes called the &quot;age of dinosaurs.&quot; The band created a Pterosaur silhouette as a logo, which they still use as of 2007, in a slightly modified version.

===Birdsongs established and performs live===
Nothing further might have come from the project had not Modern Method also asked Miller if Birdsongs could perform at the album&#x27;s 1981 record release party. For this performance, a lineup was assembled consisting of Miller on piano, Lindgren on synthesizer, Swope on guitar, and Rick Scott on electronic organ, with all members doubling on percussion instruments. Miller and Scott had both previously lived in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where they had been bandmates in the short-lived Red Ants.

While there had been no intention to play more than the one gig, audience response was so strong that further shows were booked. The ensemble became a significant side project for Miller and Swope, and recorded a six-song eponymous EP (virtually the entire repertoire at the time) for Burma&#x27;s label Ace of Hearts. Birdsongs opened for Burma at least once, and Burma&#x27;s drummer Peter Prescott contributed to Birdsongs recordings and performances. 

When Miller&#x27;s tinnitus worsened in 1982, the existence of Birdsongs as a quieter alternative was a significant factor in Miller&#x27;s decision to end Mission of Burma in 1983. In fact, he stopped writing Burma material and began writing more aggressive material for Birdsongs, such as &quot;Shiny Golden Snakes&quot; (which became the lead track of their first full-length album, &quot;Magnetic Flip.&quot;) After Burma&#x27;s breakup, Birdsongs became democratized, and Swope, Scott, and especially Lindgren began composing original material. They toured regularly, mostly in the eastern United States and usually at rock music venues. Birdsongs of the Mesozoic opened for bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Fall and Prescott&#x27;s Volcano Suns. Jon Pareles, music critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, gave a positive review to the group&#x27;s New York City debut, comparing their basic style to the minimalism of Philip Glass delivered with the energy and brevity of rock music: &quot;In fact, most of the music is far more eventful, and less repetitious, than the average pop hit single.&quot;

They did occasional cover songs, which demonstrated the breadth of their influences: Adaptations of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, the theme songs to two animated television shows (&quot;Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;) and two different versions of Brian Eno&#x27;s &quot;Sombre Reptiles&quot;.

===After Miller and Swope leave===
In 1987 Miller left the group he founded to concentrate on his Maximum Electric Piano project, which he had recently begun as a side project to Birdsongs. Miller was replaced by another Ann Arbor expatriate, saxophonist/keyboardist Steve Adams of Your Neighborhood Saxophone Quartet (who had shared many bills with Birdsongs). With Adams on board, Birdsongs music had a new jazz element to their sound. Within six months, however, Adams was offered a position in the Rova Saxophone Quartet, and was replaced by saxophonist/flautist/keyboardist Ken Field. This lineup recorded two albums for Cuneiform Records (the first featuring Adams as well).

Swope left in 1993 and was replaced by guitarist Michael Bierylo. This lineup has remained stable to 2009, and has recorded several further albums for Cuneiform. The music of the current lineup has less punk sound and more modern classical and jazz colorings than the original line-up, but their music is still very eclectic.

In 2006, Birdsongs released &quot;Extreme Spirituals&quot;, a collection of traditional American gospel songs and spirituals, with singer Oral Moses.

<text>Natasha Margaret Kaplinsky (born 9 September 1972) is an English newsreader, TV presenter and journalist, best known for her roles as a studio anchor on Sky News, BBC News, Channel 5 and ITV News. As of September 2022, she is the president of the British Board of Film Classification.

After two years on Sky News, Kaplinsky joined BBC News in 2002 where she co-hosted &quot;Breakfast&quot; until 2005, when she became the host of the &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. In October 2007, Kaplinsky was recruited to help relaunch Five (now known as Channel 5), reportedly for the highest fee ever paid to a UK newsreader, where she presented a new look, retitled &quot;Five News with Natasha Kaplinsky&quot; for three years. After leaving Channel 5, she went on to join ITV News as a presenter.

Kaplinsky has hosted light entertainment and factual programmes during her career, including &quot;Children in Need&quot; and &quot;Born to Shine&quot;. She was the subject of an episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot;. She was the winner of the first series of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2004. Kaplinsky has co-founded a mother and baby company, Mum &amp; You.

In 2014, the Prime Minister David Cameron asked Kaplinsky to become a Holocaust Commissioner leading a project to interview 112 survivors. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2017 for her services to the Holocaust Commission.

==Early life==
Kaplinsky was born to Raphael Kaplinsky, a South African political refugee, Professor of International Development at the Open University, and his wife, Catherine Kaplinsky (née Charlewood), a psychotherapist.

Kaplinsky&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Jewish, originating from the town of Slonim (then part of Poland, now located in western Belarus), and emigrated to South Africa in 1929. Kaplinsky was born in Brighton, but spent her early life in Kenya; she has stated that she was fluent in Swahili. The family emigrated to the United Kingdom and Kaplinsky was brought up in Barcombe, East Sussex. She attended Ringmer Community College, until the age of sixteen when she moved to Varndean College in Brighton.

After graduating with a degree in English from Hertford College, Oxford in 1995, one of Kaplinsky&#x27;s first jobs was working in the press offices of Labour leaders Neil Kinnock and John Smith.

Kaplinsky was the subject of an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, in which well-known people trace their family trees. Kaplinsky&#x27;s programme was broadcast on 6 September 2007. She followed her paternal line to Slonim and was shown official documentation relating to her cousin&#x27;s family. This included the death of family members during the &quot;liquidation&quot; – massacre – of the Słonim Ghetto by the Germans and another&#x27;s escape to the partisans in the Second World War and eventual immigration to Australia. Her maternal line included an apothecary to King George III.

==Career==

She then moved to presenting early morning news bulletins at Meridian. Within six months, she was co-presenting their evening news programme &quot;Meridian Tonight&quot;. In 1999, Kaplinsky moved to ITV&#x27;s London News Network where she hosted &quot;London Today&quot; and &quot;London Tonight&quot; as well as a political programme called &quot;Seven Days&quot;.

In November 2000, Kaplinsky joined Sky News, where she initially co-presented breakfast news programme &quot;Sunrise&quot;; she later moved to early evening bulletin &quot;Live at Five&quot;, which she presented alongside Jeremy Thompson.

===BBC News===
Kaplinsky joined the BBC in November 2002 to present &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; from Monday to Thursday with Dermot Murnaghan, before moving on the host the &quot;BBC News at Six&quot;.

In 2006, Kaplinsky became only the third (and youngest) woman to present the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Ten O&#x27;Clock News.&quot;

Kaplinsky was recruited from the corporation to join Five to help relaunch the channel.

===Five News===
On 18 February 2008, Kaplinsky relaunched Five.

On 21 August 2008, Kaplinsky began her first maternity leave from Five, followed by a second period after the birth of her daughter.

On 14 October 2010, Kaplinsky announced that she was leaving her job at Channel 5 at the end of 2010, having spent most of her three years at the network on maternity leave. On 23 December 2010, she presented her final bulletin for &quot;Five News&quot;.

===ITV===
Kaplinsky&#x27;s first presenting role with ITV was in the summer of 2011, when she hosted a new Sunday entertainment series &quot;Born to Shine&quot;, which raised awareness for the charity Save the Children, of which Natasha is an ambassador.

In September 2011, she made a return to &quot;London Tonight&quot;, fronting the programme in place of then lead anchor Nina Hossain. In addition, she occasionally presented numerous ITV News programmes.

On 19 August 2013, Kaplinsky presented &quot;The People&#x27;s Medal&quot;, a documentary about The Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List.

On 29 October 2013, Kaplinsky hosted the documentary &quot;On the Run&quot;, alongside journalist Mark Williams-Thomas. The pair then presented a second documentary, &quot;Missing Without Trace&quot;, on 12 November 2013.

===&quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;===

In 2004, Kaplinsky participated in the first series of the celebrity ballroom dancing competition &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and went on to win the competition with partner Brendan Cole. Kaplinsky then co-presented the first half of the second series in 2004 with Bruce Forsyth, when regular presenter Tess Daly went on maternity leave. Kaplinsky returned to the show in 2012, taking part in the Christmas Special and in 2018 as part of the BAFTA tribute to Sir Bruce Forsyth.
===British Board of Film Classification===
In 2022, she became the latest president of the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), after the former president, Patrick Swaffer, stepped down after a 10-year contract. 

==Personal life==
On 21 August 2005, Kaplinsky married Justin Bower. In April 2008, Kaplinsky announced she was pregnant with their first child, six weeks after her debut on &quot;Five News&quot;. On 25 September 2008, &quot;Five News&quot; revealed that Kaplinsky had given birth to a son. On 9 April 2010, Kaplinsky gave birth to a daughter. Speaking live on the 14 October 2020 on ITVs &quot;This Morning&quot; Kaplinsky revealed she had suffered multiple miscarriages and had participated in Channel 5&#x27;s discussion, &quot;Miscarriage: Our Story&quot; broadcast 15 October 2020.

On 8 February 2011, Kaplinsky commented in a BBC radio interview on &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot; that she and Bower had performed as disguised extras for the English National Ballet although she &quot;had insisted that her name was not used in the programme&quot;. In a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the London Coliseum, she performed as &quot;Wench Number 7&quot;.

Kaplinsky is teetotal and a vegetarian.

===2018 boat accident===
In April 2018, Kaplinsky, her father and eight-year-old daughter, Angelica were seriously hurt when the boat they were holidaying in burst into flames off the Greek island of Corfu. The family were rescued by local fishermen, who helped put out a fire that had spread from the engine room and towed them ashore. Kaplinsky&#x27;s daughter was flown back to Britain for emergency treatment. A Corfu Port Authority spokesman said: 
&quot;The vessel suffered a mechanical failure which caused a fire in the engine room, which was immediately extinguished by the people on the boat.&quot; At first the girl was rushed to hospital in Corfu Town with burns to her face and hands. &quot;Her mother and grandfather were treated at a private clinic. It was then decided to fly them home.&quot;

===Charity===
Kaplinsky became a celebrity ambassador for the UK charity Save the Children in 2010. For over a decade she has been an active ambassador and fundraiser for Save the Children, travelling extensively for them around the world.

She is a patron of the Bevern Trust and she is an ambassador for Wellbeing of Women. Kaplinsky is also Patron for the National Maternity Support Foundation and The Willow Foundation.

Kaplinsky volunteered to record 112 testimonies of Holocaust survivors who had never spoken before. She continues to serve as a board member for the Holocaust Memorial Foundation.

She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to the Holocaust Commission.

In October 2018, Kaplinsky and Michael Sheen became vice presidents (an ambassadorial role) of the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH).

In July 2019, it was announced that Kaplinsky had taken on the role as Barnardo&#x27;s President. Kaplinsky was welcomed into this position at the annual Parliamentary reception by Javed Khan, CEO of Barnardo&#x27;s, as well as other celebrity champions. Kaplinsky said, &quot;I&#x27;m delighted to be joining Barnardo&#x27;s as the charity&#x27;s new President. There are so many challenges for children these days. It must be frightening growing up now. They have so many concerns, environmental changes, the internet, difficulties breaking into jobs, and believing they&#x27;ll never be affording a house. It&#x27;s even harder for the most vulnerable children Barnardo&#x27;s supports – like children growing up in the care system. My aim is to visit as many services as I can and meet as many young people as possible, to learn more about the challenges they face and how the charity is helping them.&quot;

<doc id="1099413" wikidata="Q208474" url="?curid=1099413" title="Orbital eccentricity">
<text>In astrodynamics, the orbital eccentricity of an astronomical object is a dimensionless parameter that determines the amount by which its orbit around another body deviates from a perfect circle. A value of 0 is a circular orbit, values between 0 and 1 form an elliptic orbit, 1 is a parabolic escape orbit (or capture orbit), and greater than 1 is a hyperbola. The term derives its name from the parameters of conic sections, as every Kepler orbit is a conic section. It is normally used for the isolated two-body problem, but extensions exist for objects following a rosette orbit through the Galaxy.

==Definition==
In a two-body problem with inverse-square-law force, every orbit is a Kepler orbit. The eccentricity of this Kepler orbit is a non-negative number that defines its shape.

The eccentricity may take the following values:
* Circular orbit: 
* Elliptic orbit: 
* Parabolic trajectory: 
* Hyperbolic trajectory: 

The eccentricity is given by

formula_1

where is the total orbital energy, is the angular momentum, is the reduced mass, and formula_2 the coefficient of the inverse-square law central force such as in the theory of gravity or electrostatics in classical physics:
formula_3
(formula_2 is negative for an attractive force, positive for a repulsive one; related to the Kepler problem)

or in the case of a gravitational force:
formula_5

where is the specific orbital energy (total energy divided by the reduced mass), the standard gravitational parameter based on the total mass, and the specific relative angular momentum (angular momentum divided by the reduced mass).

For values of from to just under the orbit&#x27;s shape is an increasingly elongated (or flatter) ellipse; for values of just over to infinity the orbit is a hyperbola branch making a total turn of decreasing from 180 to 0 degrees. Here, the total turn is analogous to turning number, but for open curves (an angle covered by velocity vector). The limit case between an ellipse and a hyperbola, when equals , is parabola.

Radial trajectories are classified as elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic based on the energy of the orbit, not the eccentricity. Radial orbits have zero angular momentum and hence eccentricity equal to one. Keeping the energy constant and reducing the angular momentum, elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic orbits each tend to the corresponding type of radial trajectory while tends to (or in the parabolic case, remains ).

For a repulsive force only the hyperbolic trajectory, including the radial version, is applicable.

For elliptical orbits, a simple proof shows that formula_6 gives the projection angle of a perfect circle to an ellipse of eccentricity . For example, to view the eccentricity of the planet Mercury (), one must simply calculate the inverse sine to find the projection angle of 11.86 degrees. Then, tilting any circular object by that angle, the apparent ellipse of that object projected to the viewer&#x27;s eye will be of the same eccentricity.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;eccentricity&quot; comes from Medieval Latin &quot;eccentricus&quot;, derived from Greek &quot;ekkentros&quot; &quot;out of the center&quot;, from &quot;ek-&quot;, &quot;out of&quot; + &quot;kentron&quot; &quot;center&quot;. &quot;Eccentric&quot; first appeared in English in 1551, with the definition &quot;...a circle in which the earth, sun. etc. deviates from its center&quot;. In 1556, five years later, an adjectival form of the word had developed.

==Calculation==
The eccentricity of an orbit can be calculated from the orbital state vectors as the magnitude of the eccentricity vector:
formula_7
where:
* is the eccentricity vector (&quot;Hamilton&#x27;s vector&quot;).

For elliptical orbits it can also be calculated from the periapsis and apoapsis since formula_8 and formula_9 where is the length of the semi-major axis.formula_10
where:
* is the radius at apoapsis (also &quot;apofocus&quot;, &quot;aphelion&quot;, &quot;apogee&quot;), i.e., the farthest distance of the orbit to the center of mass of the system, which is a focus of the ellipse.
* is the radius at periapsis (or &quot;perifocus&quot; etc.), the closest distance.

The semi-major axis, a, is also the path-averaged distance to the centre of mass, while the time-averaged distance is a(1 + e e / 2).

The eccentricity of an elliptical orbit can be used to obtain the ratio of the apoapsis radius to the periapsis radius:
formula_11

For Earth, orbital eccentricity , apoapsis is aphelion and periapsis is perihelion, relative to the Sun.

For Earth&#x27;s annual orbit path, the ratio of longest radius () / shortest radius () is formula_12

==Examples==

The table lists the values for all planets and dwarf planets, and selected asteroids, comets, and moons. Mercury has the greatest orbital eccentricity of any planet in the Solar System (&quot;e&quot; = ), followed by Mars of . Such eccentricity is sufficient for Mercury to receive twice as much solar irradiation at perihelion compared to aphelion. Before its demotion from planet status in 2006, Pluto was considered to be the planet with the most eccentric orbit (&quot;e&quot; = ). Other Trans-Neptunian objects have significant eccentricity, notably the dwarf planet Eris (0.44). Even further out, Sedna has an extremely-high eccentricity of due to its estimated aphelion of 937 AU and perihelion of about 76 AU, possibly under influence of unknown object(s).

The eccentricity of Earth&#x27;s orbit is currently about ; its orbit is nearly circular. Neptune&#x27;s and Venus&#x27;s have even lower eccentricities of and respectively, the latter being the least orbital eccentricity of any planet in the Solar System. Over hundreds of thousands of years, the eccentricity of the Earth&#x27;s orbit varies from nearly to almost 0.058 as a result of gravitational attractions among the planets.

Luna&#x27;s value is , the most eccentric of the large moons in the Solar System. The four Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto) have their eccentricities of less than 0.01. Neptune&#x27;s largest moon Triton has an eccentricity of (), the smallest eccentricity of any known moon in the Solar System; its orbit is as close to a perfect circle as can be currently measured. Smaller moons, particularly irregular moons, can have significant eccentricities, such as Neptune&#x27;s third largest moon, Nereid, of .

Most of the Solar System&#x27;s asteroids have orbital eccentricities between 0 and 0.35 with an average value of 0.17. Their comparatively high eccentricities are probably due to under influence of Jupiter and to past collisions.

Comets have very different values of eccentricities. Periodic comets have eccentricities mostly between 0.2 and 0.7, but some of them have highly eccentric elliptical orbits with eccentricities just below 1; for example, Halley&#x27;s Comet has a value of 0.967. Non-periodic comets follow near-parabolic orbits and thus have eccentricities even closer to 1. Examples include Comet Hale–Bopp with a value of , Comet Ikeya-Seki with a value of and Comet McNaught (C/2006 P1) with a value of . As first two&#x27;s values are less than 1, their orbit are elliptical and they will return. 
McNaught has a hyperbolic orbit but within the influence of the inner planets, is still bound to the Sun with an orbital period of about 105 years. Comet C/1980 E1 has the largest eccentricity of any known hyperbolic comet of solar origin with an eccentricity of 1.057,&lt;ref name=&quot;C/1980E1-jpl&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and will eventually leave the Solar System.

Oumuamua is the first interstellar object to be found passing through the Solar System. Its orbital eccentricity of 1.20 indicates that Oumuamua has never been gravitationally bound to the Sun. It was discovered 0.2 AU ( km;  mi) from Earth and is roughly 200 meters in diameter. It has an interstellar speed (velocity at infinity) of 26.33 km/s ( mph).

The exoplanet HD 20782 b has the most eccentric orbit known of 0.97 ± 0.01, followed by HD 80606 b of 0.93226 .

==Mean average==
The mean eccentricity of an object is the average eccentricity as a result of perturbations over a given time period. Neptune currently has an instant (current epoch) eccentricity of , but from 1800 to 2050 has a mean eccentricity of .

==Climatic effect==
Orbital mechanics require that the duration of the seasons be proportional to the area of Earth&#x27;s orbit swept between the solstices and equinoxes, so when the orbital eccentricity is extreme, the seasons that occur on the far side of the orbit (aphelion) can be substantially longer in duration. Northern hemisphere autumn and winter occur at closest approach (perihelion), when Earth is moving at its maximum velocity—while the opposite occurs in the southern hemisphere. As a result, in the northern hemisphere, autumn and winter are slightly shorter than spring and summer—but in global terms this is balanced with them being longer below the equator. In 2006, the northern hemisphere summer was 4.66 days longer than winter, and spring was 2.9 days longer than autumn due to orbital eccentricity.

Apsidal precession also slowly changes the place in Earth&#x27;s orbit where the solstices and equinoxes occur. This is a slow change in the orbit of Earth, not the axis of rotation, which is referred to as axial precession. The climatic effects of this change are part of the Milankovitch cycles. Over the next years, the northern hemisphere winters will become gradually longer and summers will become shorter. Any cooling effect in one hemisphere is balanced by warming in the other, and any overall change will be counteracted by the fact that the eccentricity of Earth&#x27;s orbit will be almost halved. This will reduce the mean orbital radius and raise temperatures in both hemispheres closer to the mid-interglacial peak.

==Exoplanets==
Of the many exoplanets discovered, most have a higher orbital eccentricity than planets in the Solar System. Exoplanets found with low orbital eccentricity (near-circular orbits) are very close to their star and are tidally-locked to the star. All eight planets in the Solar System have near-circular orbits. The exoplanets discovered show that the Solar System, with its unusually-low eccentricity, is rare and unique. One theory attributes this low eccentricity to the high number of planets in the Solar System; another suggests it arose because of its unique asteroid belts. A few other multiplanetary systems have been found, but none resemble the Solar System. The Solar System has unique planetesimal systems, which led the planets to have near-circular orbits. Solar planetesimal systems include the asteroid belt, Hilda family, Kuiper belt, Hills cloud, and the Oort cloud. The exoplanet systems discovered have either no planetesimal systems or a very large one. Low eccentricity is needed for habitability, especially advanced life. High multiplicity planet systems are much more likely to have habitable exoplanets. The grand tack hypothesis of the Solar System also helps understand its near-circular orbits and other unique features.

<doc id="1099416" wikidata="Q5224992" url="?curid=1099416" title="Darren Johnson">
<text>Darren Paul Johnson (born 1966) is a former English politician who was a prominent member of the Green Party of England and Wales. He represented the Green Party on the London Assembly from 2000 to 2016 and was a Green councillor in the London Borough of Lewisham. He is now a writer and has had several rock music biographies published.

==Early life and career==
Johnson was born in Southport, Lancashire, and at school, studied A-Levels in English, Theatre Studies and Journalistic Studies. Johnson admitted to his &quot;shame&quot; that his first foray into politics was standing in a school mock election in 1979 as a Conservative Party candidate.

He lived in Hull for three years before moving with a friend to Wembley in London in 1990. He also lived in Finsbury Park and Golders Green before settling in Lewisham. His first job in London was &quot;in accounts with an advertising firm in Goodge Street&quot;. He took a degree at Goldsmiths College (part of the University of London) in 1994, eventually gaining a first-class BA (hons.) degree in Politics and Economics. He apparently &quot;started to work on his PhD until the London Assembly distracted him&quot;. He was also once a &quot;paid consultant to Friends of the Earth&quot;.

==Political career==
Johnson joined the Green Party in 1987 at the age of 20 &quot;after the Chernobyl Disaster&quot;, which &quot;had a big impact&quot; on him. He was Male Principal Speaker of the party in 2002.

According to the &quot;Knitting Circle&quot; (a website with &quot;resources on lesbian and gay issues&quot;), his campaigning experience includes infiltrating &quot;the military base at Aldershot dressed as Ivan the Terrible during an arms fair. He was saluted by the guards as he drove through the gates in a large limousine with tinted windows. He tried to buy arms with Monopoly money&quot;.

===London Assembly member===
In 2000, Johnson was elected to the inaugural London Assembly as part of a three-strong Green Group, including Jenny Jones AM and Victor Anderson (who resigned in March 2003 and was replaced by Noel Lynch for the remainder of the term). The 2004 elections would see the Greens lose the seat held by Lynch, leaving Johnson and Jones as the two remaining members of the Green Group. Both won re-election in the 2008 election, when the Greens held on to their two seats. He served as Deputy Chair of the Assembly 2008–09 and again in 2012–13 and was elected Chair of the Assembly in May 2009 and again in 2013.

As a London Assembly Member, Johnson was Chair of the Housing Committee and a member of the Business Management and Administration Committee, Budget and Performance Committee and the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA). Johnson issued a report on the sustainability measures involved in planning for London&#x27;s hosting of the Olympics in 2012, and also chaired an inquiry on nuclear waste trains for the London Assembly. He was previously Chair of the Environment Committee (between 2004/9 and 2010/11). The committee produced a number of reports,
including investigations into the loss of street trees, and the effects of paving over front gardens in the city. Along with his long-standing colleague Jenny Jones, he stood down at the 2016 election.

===Lewisham councillor===
In the 2002 local elections, Johnson was elected as a councillor for the Brockley ward in the London Borough of Lewisham, the Greens&#x27; first councillor in Lewisham, polling 1026 votes and coming top in the ward. He was re-elected in 2006, when the Greens gained a further five seats in Lewisham. He came top of the ward again, polling 1583 votes. In 2010, he was the only Green councillor in Lewisham to be re-elected and served until 2014 when he did not seek re-election.

In his time as a councillor, Johnson was successful in getting the council to adopt a Fair Trade policy. He opposed the closure of Ladywell Leisure Centre and put forward alternative sites for a new school. He also successfully campaigned for a new pedestrian crossing on Brockley Road, secured improvements to the traffic calming scheme and managed to halt evictions at St Norberts Allotments. In addition, he served as a member of Lewisham &#x27;s Housing Select Committee, Sustainable Development Select Committee, Council Urgency Committee, Elections Committee, Licensing (Supplementary) Committee, Licensing Committee, Overview and Scrutiny Committee and Marsha Phoenix Memorial Trust. He has represented Lewisham on the Local Government Association General Assembly.

===Mayoral candidate===
Johnson was the Green Party&#x27;s candidate for Mayor of London in 2000 and 2004. In the 2000 election, he won 2.2% of first preference votes (38,121 votes), taking sixth place. He also came third in unallocated second preference votes with 192,764-second preferences (13.6%). In the 2004 election, he received 57,331 votes in the first round (2.9%) taking seventh place, and took 10.9% of unallocated second preferences (208,686).

Johnson chose not to seek selection as mayoral candidate for a third time. On 12 March 2007, the London Green Party voted to select Siân Berry as their mayoral candidate in the 2008 mayoral election, replacing Johnson. The winner in this election was Boris Johnson.

===Parliamentary candidate===
Having fought Brent South in 1992, Johnson was the Green Party&#x27;s parliamentary candidate in the Lewisham Deptford constituency in 2001, 2005 and 2010. He came fourth in the constituency in the 2001 general election, polling 1,901 votes (6.5%). In the 2005 general election, Johnson, backed by the Fire Brigades Union (after being the only London Assembly member to vote against cuts in the brigade), received 11.1% of the votes (3,367 votes), coming fourth. In the 2010 general election he came fourth again, but his vote slipped back to 2,772 (6.7%).

===Suspension by the Green Party===
On 28 May 2024, Johnson revealed he had been suspended by the Green Party, following social media posts criticising the Green Party&#x27;s response to the Cass Review. In December 2024 he resigned from the Green Party after 37 years&#x27; membership.

==Personal life and writing==
Johnson, who is gay, lives in St Leonards, East Sussex. Johnson is a keen supporter of live music (rock and folk) and writes a live review blog. His book &quot;The Sweet in the 1970s&quot; was published by Sonicbond Publishing on 30 July 2021. This was followed by a second book &quot;Suzi Quatro in the 1970s&quot; published by the same publisher in July 2022; and a third book &quot;Slade in the 1970s&quot; published in May 2023.

<doc id="1099418" wikidata="Q213786" url="?curid=1099418" title="Christoph Friedrich von Ammon">
<text>Christoph Friedrich von Ammon (January 16, 1766 – May 21, 1850) was a German theological writer and preacher. He was born at Bayreuth, Bavaria and died at Dresden.

== Life ==
Early life

He was one of five children born to Philipp Michael Paul von Ammon and Eleonore Maria Eusebia Griesshammer. His father was a privy councillor attached to the Prussian court while his mother came from a family of clergymen. Ammons paternal grandfather Johann Christoph Ammon was also a clergyman and theological writer who had successfully debated with Lorenz Christoph Mizler on whether there existed music in heaven.

Through a daughter of his younger brother Friedrich Daniel Jonathan he was the grand-uncle of the author August Engelhardt.

=== Education ===
Ammon was educated by private teachers. He was also taught by his relatives; like his maternal grandfather Christoph Heinrich Griesshammer whom he often visited and his father&#x27;s brother Georg Conrad Lorenz Ammon who lived in Ansbach.

Ammon also received guidance from the Lutheran theologian Friedrich Immanuel Schwarz. His teachers encouraged him and instilled a love for languages and sciences. Additionally he read Homer, studied the Hebrew language, learned to act out the prose and metrical writings of the Old Testament and was therefore immediately placed in the top class of the Gymnasium in Bayreuth on January 19, 1783.

=== Career ===
After completing his studies at Erlangen, he held various professorships in the philosophical and theological faculties of Erlangen and Göttingen, succeeded Franz Volkmar Reinhard (1753–1812) in 1813 as court preacher and member of the Upper Consistory of the Church of Saxony at Dresden .

Seeking to establish for himself a middle position between rationalism and supernaturalism, he declared for a &quot;rational supernaturalism,&quot; and contended that there must be a gradual development of Christian doctrine corresponding to the advance of knowledge and science. But at the same time he sought, like other representatives of this school of thought, such as Karl Bretschneider and Julius Wegscheider, to keep in close touch with the historical theology of the Protestant churches. The term &quot;Offenbarungsrationalismus&quot; (&quot;epiphanic rationalism&quot;) has been used to express Ammon&#x27;s intermediate views.

He was a man of great versatility and extensive learning, a philologist and philosopher as well as a theologian, and a very voluminous author. His principal theological work was the &quot;&quot;Fortbildung des Christenthums zur Weltreligion&quot;, in 4 volumes (Leipzig, 1833–1840); &quot;Entwurf einer reinen biblischen Theologie&quot; appeared in 1792 (2nd edition, 1801), &quot;Summa Theologiae Christianas&quot; in 1803 (other editions, 1808, 1816, 1830); &quot;Das Geschichte des Lebens Jesu&quot; in 1842, and &quot;Die wahre und falsche Orthodoxie&quot;&quot; in 1849.

Von Ammon&#x27;s style in preaching was terse and lively, and some of his discourses are regarded as models of pulpit treatment of political questions.

== Marriage ==
In 1790 July 31 ,at Erlangen he married Elisabetha Breyer, daughter of clergyman and philosopher Johann Friedrich Breyer. One year after his marriage he became brother-in-law to Wilhelm Friedrich Hufnagel, who married Elisabethas younger sister Karoline. Hufnagel was a supporter of theistic rationalism and had previously been Ammons teacher. 

This was not only the important family connection gained through the marriage; Ammons father-in-law was also the cousin of the father of Hegel and had served as the godfather at his baptism. Therefore, though the relation was somewhat distant Hegel corresponded with von Ammon and is also known to have visited von Ammon in Dresden. 

The couplehad two sons and three daughters;

* Wilhelm Friedrich Philipp (b. 1792- d.1856) Married Mathilde Wilhelmine Klingspohr and had issue.
* Wilhelmine Friederike Luise (b. 1793- d.1873) Married to August Ludwig Gottlob Krehl and mother to Ludolf Krehl 
* Dorothea Sabine 
* Leonore Friederike Karoline 
* Friedrich August Married Natalie Redlich and had issue.
* Wilhelm Karl Tobias

After her death von Ammon married Marianne Becker on 9 June 1823. She was the daughter the court councillor and former inspector of the Cabinet of Antiquities Dr. Becker. This marriage was without issue.

== Later life ==
In 1846 his granddaughter Anna (the daughter of his son Friedrich August) gave birth to her second son. The then aged eighty-year-old von Ammon baptized the child who was named Max Lothar von Hausen.

In 1849 he retired from his position as court preacher.

== Death ==
He died at Dresden.

<doc id="1099436" wikidata="Q698862" url="?curid=1099436" title="Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval">
<text>Lieutenant General Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval (; 15 September 1715 – 9 May 1789) was a French artillery officer and engineer who revolutionised the French cannon, creating a new production system that allowed for lighter, more uniform guns without sacrificing range. 
His Gribeauval system superseded the de Vallière system. These guns proved essential to French military victories during the Napoleonic Wars. Gribeauval is credited as the earliest known advocate for the interchangeability of gun parts. He is thus one of the principal influences on the later development (over many decades by many people) of interchangeable manufacture.

==Early life==
Jean-Baptiste was born in Amiens, the son of a magistrate. He entered the French royal artillery in 1732 as a volunteer, and became an officer in 1735. For nearly twenty years regimental duty and scientific work occupied him, and in 1752 he became captain of a company of miners. In 1755, he was employed in a military mission in Prussia.

In 1757, being then a lieutenant colonel, he was lent to the Austrian army on the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War, and established the Austrian sapper corps. He led the sapping operations at the Siege of Glatz and the defence of Schweidnitz. At Schweidnitz, his 1748 design of fortification gun was tested and significantly improved by Master Carpenter Richter.

In 1762, he reported back to the Paris authorities on the Austrian artillery system compared with the existing French de Vallière guns. While with the Austrian army he also worked on the continued development of mining in siegecraft.

The empress Maria Theresa rewarded him for his work with the rank of &quot;Feldmarschallleutnant&quot; and the Grand Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. On his return to France he was made &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; (major general), in 1764 Inspector of artillery, and in 1765 &quot;lieutenant général&quot; and commander of the Order of Saint Louis.

==Gribeauval system==

Subsequently, he was for some years in disfavour at court. However, he became first inspector of artillery in 1776, in which year also he received the grand cross of the St Louis Order. He was now able to carry out the reforms in the artillery arm which are his chief title to fame. The &quot;Table des constructions des principaux attirails de l&#x27;artillerie ... de M. de Gribeauval&quot; covers all the French artillery equipment in detail. He was also responsible for the &quot;règlement&quot; for the French artillery issued in 1776. Although much of the work is not directly attributable to Gribeauval, these systems of organisation and uniformity in ordnance have been called &quot;le système Gribeauval&quot;.

<text>Mahonri Mackintosh Young (August 9, 1877 – November 2, 1957) was an American social-realist sculptor and artist. During his lengthy career, he created more than 320 sculptures, 590 oil paintings, 5,500 watercolors, 2,600 prints, and thousands of drawings. However, he is primarily recognized for his sculpture. His work includes landscapes, portraits, busts, life-size sculptures, monuments, and engravings. Regardless of his medium of choice, his work is characterized by spontaneity; he often preferred to prepare his work with quick sketches on the scene. He felt this made his work more natural as compared to using a model in the studio. He was fairly commercially successful during his life, though he did not find success until his mid-30s. Large commissions for sculptures from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) were particularly lucrative for him.

Born into a family of rich Mormon pioneer heritage, Young was the grandson of the second President of the LDS Church and first Governor of Utah, Brigham Young. Young was introduced to art by his father at an early age. He quit school at seventeen years old and worked engraving and portrait making jobs at various newspapers in Salt Lake City to make money for art lessons and for art school in New York and later, Paris. He lived most of his life in New York City where he became associated with &quot;The Eight&quot; and the Ashcan School. He ignited his commercial success in New York; however, arguably two of his most famous works, the This Is The Place Monument and the Seagull Monument are featured prominently in Salt Lake City, Utah. One of his other well-known works is a statue of Brigham Young which resides at the Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. At various times during his career, Young taught at the Art Students League. Most of Young&#x27;s work resides at Brigham Young University.

==Early years==
Mahonri Mackintosh Young was born on August 9, 1877, in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. He was the oldest child of Mahonri Moriancumer Young, owner of Deseret Woolen Mill which he had inherited from his father Brigham Young, and Agnes Mackintosh. Young enjoyed the time he spent living in rural Utah at the factory; he considered this his &quot;golden age&quot; in Utah. Young was given the name of his father, named after the character Mahonri Moriancumer from the Book of Mormon, widely known as the &quot;Brother of Jared&quot;. Moriancumer was omitted due to its peculiarity and was, instead, replaced by Mackintosh, his mother&#x27;s maiden name. His grandfather, Brigham Young, was the second president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), governor of Utah territory in 1851, and director of the Mormon pioneers to Utah. Mahonri Mackintosh was likely the last grandchild born before the death of Brigham Young on August 29 and the last to receive a blessing from him.

Young&#x27;s mother came from a polygamist marriage in the Midwestern United States. Though she did not meet her father, Daniel Mackintosh until she was older than one, he died when she was three years old and her mother raised her alone. Young&#x27;s parents had attended the University of Deseret (now University of Utah) together. They married in October 1876 in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City. After their marriage, Agnes&#x27;s mother Ellen moved into their home. Young&#x27;s twin brothers, Winfield Scott (Winnie) and Waldemar (Wally) were born on July 1, 1880; they grew to be successful, a newspaperman and a screenwriter respectively. While ill with appendicitis, his father introduced Young to sculpture by carving objects for him out of wood. For his safety, his father gave him clay to model animals, sparking his interest in art at a young age. Young&#x27;s father died when he was about seven years old. His father&#x27;s death provided Young with the motivation to become a successful sculptor. His mother never remarried but was forced to sell the factory for less than half its worth due to financial concerns. Despite this, Agnes was able to provide for the living expenses of her family.

His family moved into a small house in Salt Lake City where Young began school. At eleven years old, his mother bought him a woodcarving kit from which he carved a four-inch bas relief of Julius Caesar from a fence post. After seeing the piece, a book salesman called him a &quot;genius&quot;, leading his family to call him &quot;the genius&quot;. Due to mediocre grades and always feeling behind his classmates, Young quit school after eighth grade. He spent time reading and studying about art, making friends with other young, aspiring artists. His childhood friends included John Held Jr. and Lee Greene Richards. He created his first sculpture when he was thirteen. At a young age, Young found formal education to be a waste of time. Young said that the only thing he learned that was of any value to him was that he should look at the point where a line would end rather than the point of the pencil. However, despite his disinterest in formal education, he read avidly with favorite authors being Ralph Waldo Emerson and Montaigne. Early influences from the Mormon families around him led him to be disinterested in maintaining LDS Church activity. Examples of these influences included abuse of the law of plural marriage and excessive piety among church members.

Young was athletic and participated in baseball and football teams. However, after an injury during a football game, he broke his left arm and after it was incorrectly reset and then rebroken to be properly set, his left arm remained slightly smaller than his right for the entirety of his life. His early interest in athletics influenced the subject of his art, as he often sculpted and depicted athletes competing in various sports, the most prominent sport being boxing. He also developed his interest in nature and bird watching which further influenced themes and subjects of his art. His uncle introduced Young to ranch life, in which he became extremely interested. His mother was adamant that he pursue a different career. Although Young did not become a rancher, themes of ranching and the American West were frequent in his art. Young learned about the art style of Jean-François Millet from reading magazines, which taught him about form, space, light, and movement in art. An article about Millet convinced Young to quit school, get a job, and take art lessons. Determined to become a sculptor, Young realized that he had not sculpted since he was five years old, so he decided he may have better luck being an illustrator.

==Salt Lake City and New York education==

Rather than attend ninth grade, Young chose to pursue an artistic education under local artist James Taylor Harwood, John Hafen, and Edwin Evans. He had initially applied to the University of Utah, but his application was denied because he had not graduated high school. Instead, Young worked in a curio shop and a stationery shop to make money for lessons with Harwood. However, he was delayed in attending lessons due to a necessary appendectomy. Harwood was unimpressed by Young, believing that he was a lazy artist and did not work hard. Young&#x27;s philosophy, however, was that there is no virtue in working hard, but rather thinking hard. Furthermore, Young liked to quickly sketch an observation which he would later turn into a drawing, but being a traditionalist, Harwood viewed this technique as cheating and an &quot;artistic crime&quot;. Although Young had not yet sculpted in class, one day, Young and a classmate sculpted the mask of &quot;Laocoön&quot; with details from the &quot;David&quot; and &quot;Laughing Faun&quot;. Young was not trained in sculpture and had not sculpted since he was five years old. Despite his lack of experience, his instructors praised his sculptures and his natural talent. However, he would not sculpt again until he studied in Paris. Young saved money earned as a &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; portrait artist, but took his subsequent demotion to an engraver as a blow to his ego.

Using the money he saved, he attended the Art Students League of New York between 1899 and 1901. In New York, Young was fascinated by the Industrial Revolution and decided that he would make art to reflect the themes of the Industrial Revolution. At the Art Students League, Young took classes with George Bridgeman and Kenyon Cox. He began using realist techniques; he would look at artistic models quickly and then attempt to draw his or her memorized features. Although Young disliked Bridgeman as an instructor, Young maintained a spot as second in the class. In contrast, Young greatly admired Cox as an instructor. During his time in New York, he suffered from insomnia, which he attempted to remedy by reading Shakespeare and magazines. Young lived on a tight budget and spent most of his time studying or attending art exhibits. After running out of money, Young had to return to Salt Lake City after eight months instead of his intended nine.

==Paris education==
In Salt Lake City, Young worked for the &quot;Salt Lake Herald&quot; as an engraver and did some drawings for &quot;Deseret News&quot;. Even though he contracted the Spanish flu, Young became manager of the photoengraving shop for the &quot;Herald&quot; and saved enough money to travel to Paris, France, in 1901 to study at the Académie Julian. Young received extra money to study from his mother who had arranged for a settlement of a part of Brigham Young&#x27;s estate as well as donations from family and members of the LDS Church.

He studied until 1905, where he studied with Jean-Paul Laurens and Jean-Antoine Injalbert. Unimpressed by the traditional styles taught in Paris, Young did not believe he learned anything at the Académie in France until 1903, when he was able to work more independently and develop his realistic style. He started studying painting and after achieving personal goals painting and after more artistic education from a trip to Italy, he returned to studying sculpture and etching in 1903. Young indicated that one must learn to be thick skinned in class to be able to withstand the criticism of both professors and other students. Most of his instruction in anatomy came from independent study of books. He found that he could not stomach anatomy classes at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, not because of cadavers, because he had not yet made it to that point in the lectures, but because of the overwhelming stench of un-showered students and sweat which gave him unbearable headaches.

Young&#x27;s most important etching in Paris was &quot;The Forge Rue St. Jacque&quot;. It was exhibited in 1903, bringing public attention to Young&#x27;s etchings. His first original sculptures, &quot;The Shoveler&quot; and &quot;The Man Tired&quot; were completed in 1903. Young did not agree with the use of models in his sculpting, because he believed it took away from the naturalness of the piece. For his sculptures, he found that sketches and observation over time made for more natural results and a better depiction of motion. He nervously sent &quot;Man Tired&quot; and &quot;The Shoveler&quot; to the American Art Association show in 1903 and achieved great success. His sculptures were featured in the &quot;Paris Herald&quot; in an article about the American Art Association show. His sculptures were sent to the New Salon in Paris for liberal art, were placed in the main gallery, and received critical acclaim. He spent all of his time looking at art in exhibitions or sketching on the street which garnered him criticism from his classmates for being lazy. Young, however, felt that he could learn more by observing rather than by working and studying in the studio.

During the summer of 1903, Young returned to Salt Lake City, having run out of money. In Salt Lake City, Young continued to sketch. Fortunately for Young, his mother borrowed enough money for him to spend another two years studying in Paris. In New York, on his way to Paris, Young participated in an amateur boxing match and broke his thumb which prevented him from sculpting for a few months, so he attempted water coloring instead. He had some modeled drawings hung in the Paris Old Salon, which led him to experiment drawing with more models. His model &quot;Bovet-Arthur&quot; was displayed in the New Salon. Young frequently used this man Bovet-Arthur as a model for his work while he was in Paris. Young did a parody piece called &quot;The Toilet&quot;, but it was never exhibited, and Young destroyed it in 1905. He destroyed some other work that was not accepted to salons. He later admitted regretting destroying his work and never destroyed another piece. Heber J. Grant, president of the LDS European Church mission at the time, gave Young money to cast some of Young&#x27;s statues in bronze. During his last two years studying in France, he visited galleries and studios of well-known artists. Continuing to develop his style of realism, Mahonri Young was one of the first young American sculptural realists.

==Career==

Mahonri Young returned to Utah in 1905, needing to find a way to make a living. Due to his lack of success and financial troubles, Young considered years 1905 to 1910 his &quot;five years of exile&quot;. His first commission was a butter sculpture for Frost Creamery for the Utah State Fair called &quot;The Dairy Maid&quot;. Later, Young established a mildly successful art class at the YMCA, but the class was canceled after one of his students started an art club that took away his students in 1906. He managed to maintain some private lessons. Young hoped to make a commission by making and selling a bust of B.H. Roberts, but he did not have money to bronze it until 1908. However, Robert&#x27;s first wife refused to buy the bust because it did not adequately portray her husband&#x27;s personality. Young finally received more commission when he and Lee Greene Richards completed a mural for the Isis Movie Theatre, using themselves as models for the characters. This was the first outside mural done in Utah and the only one done by Young. However, news stories about the murals kept being killed, leading Young to believe there was a conspiracy against realist artists. However, there were few career prospects in the United States, as the art scene was dominated by conservative juries who were unwilling to take a chance on unknown artists and were uninterested in unique or groundbreaking styles. Museums and exhibitionists wanted to showcase academic art and did not want to showcase American art. Consequently, Young found it difficult to sell or exhibit his work in the United States. He found little success during his first five years back in the United States. However, a group of realists called &quot;The Eight&quot; hosted an independent exhibition in 1908 in Philadelphia, igniting the success realist artists could find in the United States.

Young improved his reputation by making a bust of Alfred Lambourne. In early 1907, the LDS Church granted Mahonri Young permission to create a life-size sculpture of Joseph Smith, the first president of the LDS Church, using his death mask. After the LDS Church rejected his work, Young offered to redo the piece and make an additional statue of Hyrum Smith, Joseph Smith&#x27;s brother. These statues were accepted and currently reside on Temple Square. Despite financial troubles, Young married Cecelia Sharp on February 19, 1907. Young had initially seen Sharp while both in Paris where Sharp had been studying piano; they had not yet met and Sharp had to travel back to Utah due to her father&#x27;s health began to fail. In Utah, they attended the same LDS Church where Sharp&#x27;s father was a bishop, but they had not yet met because Sharp was five years older than Young. Young and Sharp met in 1906 while Sharp was giving private piano lessons in Salt Lake City and fell in love. Young made a bust of Sharp in 1906. Polished and beautiful, the bust was different than anything he created during his career.

Young and Sharp&#x27;s first child, Cecelia Agnes Young, known as &quot;Agnes&quot; or &quot;Aggie&quot;, was born on April 25, 1908. Continually aware of the revolt of &quot;The Eight&quot;, Young traveled to New York in 1908 and 1909 to determine whether he could be successful in New York. After he presented an idea to construct a &quot;Seagull Monument&quot; to the LDS Church, they were excited about the project, but were unable to fund it. He instead sculpted a frieze to go above the LDS Gymnasium. This was the last project he completed in Utah before he moved to New York. Young felt that he could relate to the styles and the goals of &quot;The Eight&quot;, so he and his family moved to New York in 1910. In New York, Young was a founding member of the Society of American Etchers. He did not find success until 1912, which was a turning point in his career. In 1911, Young won the Helen Foster Barnett prize for &quot;Bovet-Arthur a Laborer&quot;, displayed at the National Academy. His first New York exhibition was held in 1912. &quot;Stevedore&quot; was shown at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. In the same year, Young was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate. Moreover, in 1912, Young proposed the &quot;Seagull Monument&quot; to the LDS Church a second time, stressing the personal importance of the monument to Presiding Bishop of the LDS Church Charles W. Nibley. The LDS Church offered Young a contract for the completion of the &quot;Seagull Monument&quot;, offering him a $200 per month advance for his living expenses. Mahonri &quot;Bill&quot; Sharp Young was born on July 23, 1911, in New York.

Following the Seagull contract, Young was offered a contract to create art for a Hopi Indian exhibition for the American Museum of Natural History. He visited Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah to get inspiration and then returned to New York to complete the project with his colleague Howard MacCormick. Young was offered some commission to create dioramas for Navajo and Apache tribes as well. The &quot;Seagull Monument&quot; was unveiled and dedicated on Temple Square on October 1, 1913. A member of the Association of American Painters and Sculptors and because of the similar artistic goals and interests, Young became friends with some members of the Ashcan School and joined them in arranging the 1913 Armory show, which sought to introduce patrons to new styles and movements in art. The Armory show included realism and introduced more abstract styles such as Cubism. Young disliked abstract art styles. In fact, Young believed the emerging styles of surrealism and abstract expressionism that began to appear later in his life were &quot;a greater threat than Communism&quot;. In 1915 Young became a member of The Brooklyn Society of Etchers (Today known as the Society of American Graphic Artists or SAGA). The Society&#x27;s objective was, as it is today, to advance the fine works of American etchers. Young&#x27;s six etchings, &quot;Noon&quot;, &quot;Ensign Peak&quot;, &quot;The Main Digger&quot; (which was listed for $18), &quot;Kite Fliers&quot;, &quot;Pavers&quot; and &quot;The Sand Pit&quot; were all exhibited at The Brooklyn Society of Etcher&#x27;s first exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum, NY in 1916. Also in 1915, he featured nine pieces at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition where he was awarded the silver medal. Young&#x27;s Apache sculptures were unveiled at the American Museum of Natural History in 1916. Cecelia Sharp died of cancer in 1917 after which Young returned to Paris to continue studying art. He resided in Paris from 1925 to 1927. In Paris, he taught students, one of whom was Mary Tarleton. Tarleton and Young maintained a romantic relationship for a few years. Tarleton, 27 years his junior, confessed her love to Young but refused his many marriage proposals. Their relationship and consistent correspondence came to an end in 1930. In 1923, Young was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Academician. In 1924, Young unveiled his Navajo statues at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.

In 1926, E. W. Marland commissioned a statue of a pioneer woman; he invited twelve artists to submit sculptures to be considered for the monument. Young submitted a sculpture but lost to Bryant Baker. Young considered this the greatest disappointment of his career. Young&#x27;s statues of Prize Ring boxer bronzes were shown at the Rehn Galleries in New York in 1928, their first exhibition. In 1929, Young crafted a bronze of Joe Gans for Winfield Sheehan, a Fox Film executive at the time. Young married Dorothy Weir, daughter of painter J. Alden Weir on February 17, 1931 and promptly moved to the Weir family farm in Connecticut. Young maintained a studio at the Weir estate which has become Weir Farm National Historic Site. Young first met Weir at 1921 at a dinner to discuss plans for the Phillips Memorial Gallery, one of the books for the gallery was intended to be dedicated to Weir&#x27;s father. When Young returned to Paris to teach and work on his art from 1925 to 1927, they were reacquainted and became friends. After returning to New York, Young proposed marriage to Weir a few times, but she hesitated having never been married and feeling responsibility to care for her aging stepmother.

In 1932, Young competed in the Art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics with eight boxing statues. &quot;The Knockdown&quot;, which he had sculpted in the 1920s in Paris, won the gold medal for sculpture. In 1934, he began teaching at the Art Students League. The same year, his etching &quot;Pont Neuf&quot; was featured in &quot;Fine Prints of the Year&quot;, 1933. In 1941 Life magazine called him &quot;the George Bellows of American sculpture.&quot; &quot;Industry&quot; and &quot;Agriculture&quot;, a statue of factory worker with tools and a statue of a farmer sharpening his blade, were displayed at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. These large sculptures stood at the fair&#x27;s entrance.
==&quot;This is the Place Monument&quot;==

Mahonri Young had a unique relationship with the LDS Church. Since his teenage years, he did not attend church, follow the Word of Wisdom, or pay tithing to the LDS Church. However, he did admire several LDS Church leaders and was proud of his pioneer heritage. Despite his lack of activity in the LDS Church, he lobbied heavily to work on several projects for the church. Largely considered to be his most important artistic work, Young was especially proud of &quot;This Is The Place&quot; Monument located at This Is the Place Heritage Park in the foothills of Salt Lake City. The most artistically significant relief on the monument depicts the Donner Party. The monument was intended to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Brigham Young and the Mormons&#x27; arrival in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. As early as 1935, a committee had been chosen to consider artists&#x27; proposals of the monument. Young did extensive research and sketching for the project, confident he would be awarded the chance to create the monument. After lobbying the committee for almost five months, he returned to New York, frustrated that he had not yet secured the project. He decided to lobby U.S. senators from Utah to gained federal funding for the project which offended committee member John D. Giles. Giles told Young that he could not give him a contract because they were waiting on funding from the LDS Church; however, Giles was actually stalling time to find a different artist to complete the project. The committee decided to make the monument proposal a competition, which worried Young because of his experience with the Pioneer Woman Competition. John Fairbanks, a younger artist, had already completed prominent statues and memorials for the LDS Church; he was Young&#x27;s fiercest competition. LDS President Heber J. Grant chose Young&#x27;s design in 1939, because it highlighted prominent figures Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Wilford Woodruff rather than a covered wagon, as in the Fairbanks design.
Young was awarded $50,000 to build the monument in 1939 when he was 62 years old. After he was granted the contract, many of the artistic qualities sought by Young were vetoed by representatives from Utah state government, the LDS Church, and descendants of pioneers. For example, Young wanted pioneer leaders in realistic clothing like they would have worn when entering the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. However, Young&#x27;s vision of leaders like Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball in suspenders and bloomers was deemed undignified. Instead, pioneer leaders were portrayed in heavy formal overcoats. Young worked on the statues at Weir farm, assisted by Spero Anargyros. The monument was dedicated on July 24, 1947, on the one-hundredth anniversary of Brigham Young&#x27;s party reaching the Great Salt Lake Valley. It is the largest sculpted monument in Utah. Even though Young was paid $50,000 for the monument, he believed that he was owed $11,000 extra according to the terms of the contract. He was angry when he was denied the money and eventually became frustrated enough to write to the president of the LDS Church George A. Smith directly. George Q. Morris of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles severely reprimanded Young for contacting Smith and Young was never paid the extra $11,000. Young resented this alleged contract breach for the rest of his life.

In 1947, Young was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Dorothy Weir died on May 28, 1947. Young continued to live there after her death. His last major work was for the State of Utah. He created a six-foot monument of Brigham Young seated for the Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol Building. The work was unveiled in Washington, D.C., in 1950. He carved this work at the American Academy in Rome, Italy. During a visit to Utah in the same year, he was made an honorary member of the Sons of Utah Pioneers Club. In 1955, Young participated in the Armory Show Commemorative Exhibition in New York City. In January 1957, Young had a serious stroke and in October 1957, he had an ulcer attack. Young died in Norwalk, Connecticut, on November 2, 1957, from the result of bleeding ulcers complicated by pneumonia; he was eighty years old. He was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery at the Young family plot, next to Cecelia Young.

==Style and works==
Although Mahonri Young was taught the classical style which prevailed in the French art institutes of the time, and was surrounded by colleagues who sought to reject the classical style with impressionistic and post-impressionistic styles, Young was disinterested in depicting idyllic or naturalistic images and was more concerned with depicting the realities of life that surrounded him. Consequently, Young&#x27;s work is often associated with social realism, as his work depicted laborers, immigrants, minorities, the West, and man&#x27;s interaction with nature. At the time, Young felt isolated by his traditionalist instructors and colleagues who penned Young&#x27;s work as &quot;dishonest&quot;. The size of his work ranged from larger monuments to small sculptures which he typically did in the social realist style. His most recurring subject matter included animals, Native Americans, the boxing ring, ranch life, and laborers. Young greatly admired the work of Cyrus Dallin and Young&#x27;s work often had parallels to that of Dallin&#x27;s.

Mahonri Young was versatile in his subject matter and methods, yet his works were united in &quot;powerful elegance&quot;. He was proficient in various mediums and techniques such as etching, drawing, watercolor, oil, gouache, and sculpture, which included his lesser known work on medals and reliefs. Even though he is known for his sculpture, he always kept a sketchbook with him and would use pen and ink, oil, and watercolor to depict scenes he saw on the farm. However while art critic, Frank Jewett Mather praised Young&#x27;s drawings, etchings, and sculpture, he qualified Young&#x27;s painting as average, suggesting that Young may have commenced painting at too old of an age or perhaps did not approach it with the same effort and care with which he approached his other mediums. Additionally, compared Young&#x27;s work to that of Jean-François Millet, Honoré Daumier, and Constantin Meunier. Though Young vehemently denied it, some critics accused Young of imitating Millet&#x27;s work. Young&#x27;s work, particularly his earlier pieces, was also heavily influenced by Auguste Rodin. Young&#x27;s sculpture of fighting boxers, &quot;Right to the Jaw&quot; is characteristic of Rodin&#x27;s style with its curves and opposing diagonal movements. Young&#x27;s experience as a sketch artist for the &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; gave him a spontaneous style that he believed benefited his art. Young excelled in &quot;depicting figures in motion&quot; and &quot;the psychological nuances of gesture&quot;. Rather than emphasize light, appearance, and technical skill as had prevailed in traditionalist art, Young preferred to emphasize rhythm, balance, movement, form, and design.

==Legacy==
Mahonri Young&#x27;s career lasted more than fifty years with his works displayed in over fifty museums and galleries in the United States and Europe. Upon his death, his estate constituted 320 pieces of sculpture, 590 oil paintings, 5,500 watercolors, 2,600 prints, and thousands of drawings. Young was the first Utah artist to have his work displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Moreover, Young received nearly every award offered to artists in Utah. The Springville Museum of Art called Young &quot;Utah&#x27;s most famous New York-based artist&quot;. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Mormonism&quot;, Young gained a national reputation for his sculpture and graphic art. Guy Pène du Bois said, &quot;Mahonri Young belongs among...those who of the strain of Michelangelo, Titian, Rubens, Goya, Renoir, and Millet...he is a rare sculptor in America&quot;. Young was a member of the American Watercolor Society. In 1940, the Addison Gallery of American Art hosted a retrospective exhibit of Young&#x27;s various works. In 1999, the Brigham Young University Museum of Art in Provo, Utah opened a year-long exhibition of Mahonri Young&#x27;s work called &quot;Mahonri: A Song of Joys&quot;. The Young family donated over 7,000 various works of Young to Brigham Young University. Additionally, the BYU Museum of Art held an exhibition of Young&#x27;s work during summer 2019.

<text>Miramar is a suburb of Wellington, New Zealand, south-east of the city centre. It is on the Miramar Peninsula, directly east of the isthmus of Rongotai, the site of Wellington International Airport.

==History==
Miramar Peninsula was originally an island, separated from Kilbirnie by a sea channel called Te Awa-a-Taia (the channel of Taia); this was where the Rongotai isthmus is now. The original Māori name for the whole area when it was still an island was Te Motu Kairangi (meaning &quot;esteemed&quot; or &quot;precious&quot; island). 

&#x27;Miramar&#x27; means &#x27;sea view&#x27; in Spanish. The name was chosen by the first European to settle in the area, Scotsman Coutts Crawford (1817–1889). Crawford was a former Royal Navy officer turned businessman and colonist, who arrived in Wellington in 1840. Crawford established a farm on Miramar Peninsula, which at the time was known as Watt&#x27;s Peninsula, and drained a large lagoon known as Burnham Water. This lagoon covered much of the low-lying land on the peninsula; now this area is occupied by suburban houses, streets, parks and shops in the suburb of Miramar.

On 18 November 1904 Miramar Borough was formed. In April 1921, Miramar was incorporated into the City of Wellington. The records of the Miramar Borough Council were transferred to the City of Wellington at the time of amalgamation and can still be accessed today through Wellington City Council.

== Location ==
As of 2024, the suburb of Miramar consists of the mainly-flat central basin of Miramar Peninsula, separated from surrounding suburbs from the northwest around to the east by a ring of hills. In the northwest and north, Miramar&#x27;s boundary with Maupuia lies roughly along the ridgeline, and to the east Nevay Road and Seatoun Heights Road separate Miramar from Karaka Bays and Seatoun. In the flatter west and south, Miramar is bounded by Calabar Road and Wellington Airport to the west and by Broadway and Strathmore Park to the south.

The employment status of those at least 15 was that 4,302 (54.1%) people were employed full-time, 1,071 (13.5%) were part-time, and 282 (3.5%) were unemployed.

==Film==

Prior to World War II in 1936 the then government purchased an independent film company called Filmcraft in Darlington Rd, Miramar and set up a full body, government film production operation, to cover New Zealand&#x27;s contribution in the war (and the 1940 Centennial celebrations). It was called the National Film Unit. In 1979 the NFU moved to Avalon, Lower Hutt, next to the national television entity Avalon Studios. In the late nineties, film director Sir Peter Jackson purchased the Film Unit, as it was then known, to produce his films. He used the NFU&#x27;s facilities while making &quot;Braindead&quot;. Since then, Jackson has brought the Film Unit back to Miramar, which would now be seen as a sunset arm of his empire.

Jackson and his colleagues Sir Richard Taylor (VFX) and Jamie Selkirk (Editor) have built a series of multi million-dollar studios, sound stages, and pre- and post-production facilities in Miramar that include Stone Street Studios, Park Road Post, Weta Digital, and Weta Workshop. Jackson filmed the studio scenes of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and &quot;King Kong&quot; in Miramar. Miramar has been hailed by Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro as &quot;Hollywood the way God intended it&quot;.

===Roxy Cinema===

The Roxy Cinema building at the Miramar shopping centre in Park Road was built by local businessman Sidney Morrison, and opened as Capitol Theatre in January 1929. The Capitol closed in 1964 and the building then became the Capitol Court shopping plaza. After lying abandoned for many years, the building was bought by Camperdown Studios Group in 2003. The façade was retained but the rest of the building was demolished and rebuilt as a two-screen movie theatre, opening in 2011. As of 2022 the Roxy was owned by Jamie Selkirk and his wife Ann, Weta Workshop founder Tania Rodger, local foodie Valentina Dias, Daminda Dias, and renowned bartender and cocktail master Ray Letoa. The interior of the building is designed in a lush 1930s style. The upstairs lobby features a large ceiling mural by Greg Broadmore of Weta Workshop, which was inspired by the film &quot;Metropolis.&quot; An Oscar won by Jamie Selkirk was on display in the theatre&quot;,&quot; and a statue of Gandalf stands in front of the building.

<text>Tres Cantos () is a municipality of Spain located in Community of Madrid.

Originally belonging to Colmenar Viejo, it seceded from the latter municipality in 1991, becoming the youngest municipality in the region. The urbanised area was conceived as a &quot;satellite city&quot; of Madrid developed by urban planners in the 1970s. It has a population of 48 326 inhabitants in 2020.
The city, as other planned cities, has a distinctive structure. It consists of three &quot;phases&quot; and a newer development &quot;Nuevo Tres Cantos&quot;. The two first phases are subdivided in &quot;sectors&quot;. Most sectors, especially in the first phase (North), include internally pedestrian public spaces, being surrounded by streets. The names of urban places are usually related to the sector in which they are located–for example, the &quot;Sector Océanos&quot; consists of five streets named after the five oceans.

The town hosts a number of Spanish headquarters of companies such as Siemens, Danone, Beiersdorf, advanced research at Merck, GSK, and a chapter of the Spanish High Committee of Scientific Research CSIC.

== History ==

In 1969 to 1973, Vicente Mortes, the Minister of Housing (Ministro de la Vivienda), commissioned by the dictator Francisco Franco, was the first to establish and develop the town over a rural area. This was not the Tres Cantos we know today, because it was the old version of it. Later on, they decided to regenerate the city, copying what some English cities did during those times. In 1976, the company “Tres Cantos S.A.” was created and which regenerated the city. It is one of the company&#x27;s projects planned on paper. Residential occupation began from 1982.

A separatist party promoted the independence of Tres Cantos, obtaining support from the PSOE municipal councillors (with the opposition of the People&#x27;s Party; PP), and thus, Tres Cantos seceded from Colmenar Viejo in 1991, becoming a standalone municipality. Despite the opposition to independence from the PP ranks, the municipality has eventually become a PP stronghold. Infrastructure development has continued apace, with a current (2005) 5-year development plan by local government authorities allowing for expansion of up to 60,000 inhabitants. The first mayor of Tres Cantos was Antonio Osuna with an 80% level of support from the population.

== Geography and location ==

Tres Cantos was built on former rural lands, about halfway from the northern outskirts of suburban Madrid to the Guadarrama mountain range, which are frequently snow-capped in winter. It lies in a slight valley formed with two eastwards-flowing creeks, bounded to the south by a higher plateau leading to Madrid, and to the west and north by more hilly terrain, which separates the area from the watershed of the Manzanares River. General elevation of the township is around 680 m, with a highest elevation within the municipality&#x27;s borders of 730 m. The terrain rises towards the foothills of the Guadarrama range to the north and northwest, reaching elevations in excess of 800 m across the border in Colmenar Viejo. Within the urban area the terrain is gently undulating. It also an enormous new phase where there has been construction of new houses for new people for a long time. This new part of Tres Cantos is going to be named the Third Phase and is only composed of modern buildings and new houses for the city to expand.

The climate of Tres Cantos is typical for continental Spain. Summers are warm, with maximum temperatures of 33 °C which can sometimes reach the 39 °C. Night temperatures are more pleasant, because they decrease till 20 °C. There are cold winters, with minimum temperatures of 0 °C and below, and maximum temperatures of around 9 °C. Due to its geographical location, 22 kilometers from the capital, with its altitude and proximity to the mountains, the annual average precipitation is greater than in Madrid (above 500 mm).

== Demographics ==
In 2004 the residential population of Tres Cantos was 38,882 according to National Institute of Statistics (&quot;Instituto Nacional de Estadística&quot;, or INE) figures; however later estimates put the figure at around 45,000. Population growth has been in decline since the peak of the initial influx of residents in the early 1990s, however future plans for expansion are designed to cater for an eventual population of around 60,000.

A feature of Tres Cantos&#x27; demographic profile is the large proportion of young professionals (aged 45 and under) with children, compared to Madrid and the national average. This population structure reflects the nucleus of those who left the crowded confines of Madrid to settle in the new community of Tres Cantos in the 1980s and 1990s, resulting in a predominance of young, double-income and home-owning families of 2 to 3 children. Some 40% of the town&#x27;s population are under 20 (almost double the national average), and less than 6% are over the age of 65 (considerably less than half the national average). The birth rate is also double the national average.

Some 10% of the population are foreign-born (&quot;extranjeros&quot;), with those from Latin American countries representing over half of these, and those from other European countries a further 33%. Again, many of the immigrant population are professionals employed by multinational companies in fields such as technology, who have settled in Spain after first arriving on work assignment, many of whom are married to Spanish nationals.

Educational accreditation among Tres Cantos inhabitants is also above the national average, with some 60% of prime income earners holding a tertiary qualification or higher. Average income levels reflect these education levels and professional employment opportunities, with over 55% having salaries in the upper-middle or higher income range. Many households have dual-incomes. Approximately 15% of households are classified as lower-middle and low-income households.

An overwhelming majority of the employed work in the services sector, either in Madrid or in Tres Cantos itself. A majority of working residents regularly commute to Madrid for work, with only about a quarter of the workforce having employment in Tres Cantos itself. Those who remain behind are joined by a daily influx of approximately 20,000 who commute from Madrid and its environs to Tres Cantos for work. Light and medium industries account for some 20% of employment in Tres Cantos, the construction sector providing a further 7.4%; a bare handful (0.2%) are employed in agriculture.

== Economy and industry ==

Tres Cantos&#x27; main economic activity is derived from the existence of various high-tech factories and headquarters in designated zones, including from the pharmaceutical, aerospace and computing industries.

A production hub of Netflix is also found here.

Approximately 20,000 employees from outside of Tres Cantos (predominantly Madrid) commute daily to work in its industrial zones its &quot;Technological Park,&quot; home of cutting-edge companies in the aerospace industry, such as GMV Innovating Solutions. Other multinational corporations with offices and/or production in Tres Cantos are: Lucent Technologies, BP Solar, BDF Nivea, Nokia Siemens Networks, Samsonite, Altair, Hella, Siemens, Dannon, GMV, IFS and Sener Aeronáutica. The once largest cable provider in Spain, SOGECABLE, relocated here. The headquarters of both the Real Automóvil Club de España and the (CEM) are located in Tres Cantos.

== Sister cities ==

Tres Cantos is a sister city to the planned cities of Columbia, Maryland, United States, Cergy-Pontoise, France and Nejapa, El Salvador.

<text>Te Motu Kairangi / Miramar Peninsula is a large peninsula on the southeastern side of the city of Wellington, New Zealand. It is located at the entrance to Wellington Harbour, in Wellington&#x27;s eastern suburbs. According to Māori legend, it was formed when the taniwha Whaitaitai beached as he tried to escape the confines of the harbour. It contains the suburbs of Miramar, Seatoun, Strathmore Park, and Karaka Bays.

==Geography==
From above, the peninsula resembles the shape of a shark. Northwards, it juts into Wellington Harbour (formerly known as Port Nicholson, and in Māori as Te Whanganui-a-Tara, the Great Harbour of Tara). To the south are Cook Strait and the South Pacific Ocean. The suburbs of Kilbirnie, Lyall Bay, Hataitai and Newtown, and the inner city, lie to the west. To the east a narrow stretch of water connects Wellington Harbour with Cook Strait and the open sea; beyond this channel are the scrubby Eastbourne hills, and the high and forested Ōrongorongo Ranges. From the peninsula&#x27;s high points, an observer can look north to the Hutt Valley and the Tararua Ranges, or southwest across Cook Strait, to the high peaks of the Inland and Seaward Kaikōura Ranges, which are often snowbound in winter.

The peninsula has an area of . The coastline is rocky, with many coves, steep cliffs, and small pinnacles and caves, but there are also sweeping and sandy beaches, notably at Breaker Bay, Worser Bay, Scorching Bay, Moa Point and Tarakena Bay. A high ridge running on an approximate north–south axis forms the spine of the peninsula, with high points Mount Crawford in the north and Beacon Hill in the south. The peninsula has a large area of low-lying land, the Miramar flats, and a smaller area of flat land at Seatoun, both of which are mainly covered in residential housing.

The peninsula is largely urbanized, with large suburbs of Miramar, Maupuia, Strathmore and Seatoun, and narrow strips of houses along the coast at Breaker Bay, Karaka Bay and Moa Point. The urban area is a mix of suburban housing, retail outlets, schools, light and service industries, recreation grounds (such as a golf course and sports fields), and Wellington Airport. There are also extensive areas of regenerating native bush, pine forest, and remnant farmland, as well as urban gardens. A narrow two-lane road circles the peninsula, providing a picturesque route around the many bays, coves and headlands.

At the entrance to Wellington Harbour, the rocks of Barrett Reef lie close to the shore of the peninsula. On 10 April 1968 , an inter-island ferry, foundered on Barrett Reef and later capsized near Steeple Rock, a pinnacle just off Seatoun. 53 people were killed.

===Climate===
The peninsula is exposed to Wellington&#x27;s prevailing northwest wind and the southerly wind. During southerly storms, big waves and swells batter the peninsula&#x27;s rocky southern shore. The peninsula&#x27;s topography, with its high ridges and small bays and coves, provides shelter from the wind in many places. On 15 August 2011, during a prolonged southerly storm, snow fell across the peninsula in the late morning, settling in light drifts on trees, streets and fields. Like other parts of Wellington, snowfall at sea level is a very rare occurrence.

==Notable landmarks==
Notable landmarks include:

; Wellington International Airport: Its runway runs north–south along the western side, separating Miramar from Rongotai, Lyall Bay and Kilbirnie. A tunnel for pedestrians and cyclists runs on a west–east axis beneath the runway, from Miro Street in Miramar to Coutts Street in Rongotai.
; Massey Memorial: The marble mausoleum of Prime Minister William Massey (1856 - 1925) sits on a headland at Point Halswell, at the northern tip of the peninsula. It can be accessed from Massey Road, along a short walking track.

; Atatürk Memorial: A plinth on a cliff overlooking Tarakena Bay and Cook Strait commemorates Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the Republic of Turkey, statesman and general, who led Turkish troops in action against New Zealand soldiers at Gallipoli in the First World War.

; Rangitatau and Poito: Site of a Māori kainga (village) and pa in bush above Tarakena Bay, near the Atatürk Memorial. In pre-European times, people of the Ngai Tara and Ngāti Ira iwi lived here, using the site for fishing in Cook Strait. In 1819–20, Ngā Puhi and Ngāti Toa raiders attacked and sacked the pa, and killed, enslaved or drove off its inhabitants.

; Eastern Walkway: A walking track that traverses the main ridge from the Pass of Branda to Tarakena Bay. It runs for 2.5 km, passing mainly through regenerating native forest, and provides excellent views of Wellington city, the Miramar Peninsula, Wellington Harbour and Cook Strait.

; The Cutting:The Cutting was constructed through a low ridge on the peninsula&#x27;s eastern side in the late 1890s, and widened in 1910. It provides a thoroughfare from Cobham Drive to Miramar Avenue and central Miramar.

; Wellington Blown Away sign: A sign on a hill near the Miramar Cutting spells out &#x27;Wellington&#x27; with the last few letters looking like they are blowing away in Wellington&#x27;s famous winds. Originally Wellington Airport announced it would install a sign saying &#x27;Wellywood&#x27;, referencing the area&#x27;s film industry, but this proposal was not popular so a competition was created by the airport and promoted by the Dominion Post newspaper. The winner of the design competition was &#x27;Wellington Blown Away&#x27;, designed by Matt Sellars and Raymond McKay of Saatchi and Saatchi. The sign was installed in 2012, and is intended to be seen from the air when landing from the north at Wellington Airport.

; Shelly Bay buildings: From 1885 to 1995, Shelly Bay was a naval and air force base, and many barracks, workshops, stores, wharves and slipways were built. Concrete munitions magazines are in pine forest above the bay. The area was previously owned by local iwi, through the Port Nicholson Trust. The land was sold to a developer with plans for it to become the site of a major residential development, but the project was cancelled in September 2023, and the land sold to Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh.

; Fort Ballance: Fort Ballance was the premier fort in the Wellington area for 26 years (1885-1911). Used by the military over a period of 60 years (1885-1945), the 1880s layout of Fort Ballance is largely unaltered and a good impression of the original nineteenth century fort remains. The fort is a permanent reminder of the technology used in the coastal defence network of the 1880s and it is an early example of the use of concrete as a building material.

; Mt Crawford Prison: Wellington Prison, commonly known as Mt Crawford Prison, was located at the top of Mt Crawford, a peak on the ridge of hills forming a spine at the north end of the Miramar peninsula. The prison was opened in 1927 to replace the Victorian-era Terrace Gaol and was fully occupied by 1929. The prison included a gallows and four men were hanged there, all in the 1930s. The prison closed in 2012. LINZ took over management of the site, which is owned by the Defence Force and the Department of Corrections, but as of 2021 nothing had been done with it and the building remained derelict and the site a dumping ground for rubbish. In 2019 there was a proposal by Taranaki Whānui – the commercial arm of the Port Nicholson Block Settlement Trust – to build 300 homes on the site. However a group of Taranaki Whānui members known as Mau Whenua opposed the housing development, saying they believe the land is sacred. In 2021 preliminary geotechnical drilling investigation was done at the site.

;Seatoun Tunnel
: The Seatoun Tunnel, constructed 1906-1907, greatly improved access to the suburb of Seatoun, previously only reachable by ferry or bush track. It was funded by the Crawford Family, early owners of much of the Miramar peninsula.

==Transport links==
Cobham Drive is the main road connecting Miramar with the rest of Wellington city. It runs around the north end of Wellington Airport, at Evans Bay. Several bus routes run between Miramar peninsula and the city, with express buses at peak times. A cycle path runs from Miramar to the central city, starting at Burnham Wharf and continuing along Cobham Drive, Evans Bay Parade and Oriental Parade.

==Sports clubs==
The peninsula has several sports clubs: Miramar Rangers, a semi-professional football club, founded in 1907; Seatoun AFC, an amateur football club founded in 1909; and Oriental Rongotai Football Club (&#x27;Ories&#x27;), an amateur rugby club formed in 1888. The Eastern Suburbs Cricket Club, in nearby Kilbirnie, covers junior and senior cricketers on the peninsula.

==Film industry==
Film director Peter Jackson has based his film production empire in Miramar, with studios, sound stages, and pre- and post-production facilities. Weta Workshop, involved in many movies directed by Jackson, such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, &quot;King Kong&quot;, and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, is also in Miramar.

==History==

The Māori name for the area when it was still an island was Te Motu Kairangi (meaning &quot;esteemed&quot; or &quot;precious&quot; island). The island was separated from the main island (Te Ika a Māui) by a sea channel called Te Awa-a-Taia (the channel of Taia); this was where Kilbirnie is now. The peninsula area later became known as Hataitai or Whataitai.

=== Kupe and centuries of tangata whenua ===

The island of Te Motu Kairangi was first settled as long ago as 950 AD when Kupe the explorer arrived. Kupe first landed near Seatoun, and a large rock near the shore still bears the name Te Ure-o-Kupe (Kupe&#x27;s penis) or Te Aroaro-o-Kupe (Kupe&#x27;s presence). The area was home in turn to Ngai Tara, Rangitane, Ngati Kahungungu, Ngai Tahu, Mua Upoko, Ngāti Ira, and Te Ati Awa. Other iwi who may have dwelt here include Waitaha, Ngati Mamoe, Ngati Kuia, Ngati Kuru, and Ngati Mutunga.

Ngai Tara were the first to settle on the island, and built the first pā, named &quot;Whetu Kairangi&quot; (bountiful stars) on the hill overlooking Worser Bay. The name of Wellington Harbour &quot;Whanganui-a-Tara&quot; (harbour of Tara) was also named for Tara.

Ngai Tahu lived in the peninsula on their long multi-generation migration southwards. They occupied pa already built as well as building their own.

Around 1460 AD an earthquake named &quot;Haowhenua&quot; (earth swallower) raised the land, eliminating the shallow channel and joining the island to the mainland. This created a flat plain and freshwater lake in the centre of the peninsula. The lake was first called &quot;Te Rotokura&quot; (red lagoon) and later &quot;Para&quot;. When Pākehā settled they named this lagoon &quot;Burnham Water&quot;.

With the water channel in the east gone following the earthquake more fortifications and defensive pa were needed. Many pā (a village, sometimes also a fortress) and kainga (homes/dwellings) existed over many centuries with many changes, and include the following

* Kakariki-hutia Pa (built by Ngāti Ira) overlooking modern day Awa Road
* Kau-whakaara-waru on the east side of Point Halswell
* Mahanga (Te Mahanga Pa) near Kau Bay and above Mahanga Bay
* Manu-kai-kura, a kainga in the small bay north of Shelly Bay
* Mataki-kai-poinga on the western hill below Mount Crawford was originally built by Ngāti Kaitangata (a hapu of Ngāti Ira under their chief Tuahitiri and later occupied by Ngai Tahu under their chief TioTio
* Maupuia Pa, a stockaded village built by Ngāti Hinepare, a hapu of Ngāti Kahungnunu on the narrow part of Rongotai Ridge near the Wellington sign/Miramar cutting today
* Oruaiti Pa (the place of the small pit) built by Te Rerewa of Rangitane on the ridge at point Dorset
* Paewhenua, a kainga at Eve Bay west of Breaker Bay
* Poito Pa, a fortified village of Ngāti Ira near the Poti stream at Tarakena Bay (attacked and burned along with Rangitatau Pa in 1819–1820)
* Puhirangi Pa on the hill about the stream flowing into Scorching Bay on the ridge above Karaka Bay
* Rangitatau Pa was built by Ngai Tara. It was located above Seatoun and may have stretched as far as Pilot Hill and over to Lyall Bay. The principal whare of the pa was called &quot;Raukawa&quot; and a fishing rock offshore was called &quot;Te Kai-whatawhata&quot;. Rangitatau was the largest pa on the peninsula and was inhabited over many centuries. It was often described as a &quot;citadel&quot; and was used by people living in nearby Poito village as a refuge during attacks. Both Poito and Rangitatau were destroyed by raiders in 1819-1820
* Tapu-te-Rangi pa is recorded on the map by McLeod and on plans by Crawford as being in Kilbirnie but this may be a mistake, as Tapu-te-Ranga is a name for the motu in island bay
* Te Whetu-kairangi, a kainga of Ngai Tara and Muaupoko was above Worser Bay
* Paekawakawa Kainga is mentioned on McLeod&#x27;s map but is believed by later historians to be mistaken for a place of the same name in Island Bay.

=== Pākehā arrival ===
Captain Cook anchored off the coast near Miramar on his first visit to New Zealand, and mapped much of the coastline but didn&#x27;t record the harbour entrance. On his second voyage to New Zealand he noted the entrance to Whanganui-a-Tara, and attempted unsuccessfully to enter the harbour. His diary entry reads:November 2, 1773. We discovered on the east side of Cape Teerawhitte a new inlet I had never observed before. Being tired with beating against the N.W. winds, I resolved to put into this place, if I found it practicable, or to anchor in the bay which lies before it ……… At one o&#x27;clock we reached the entrance of the inlet, just as the tide of ebb was making out; the wind likewise against us, we anchored in twelve fathoms water, the bottom a fine sand. The easternmost of the Black Rocks, which lie on the larboard side of the entrance of the inlet, bore N. by E. one mile distant; Cape Teerawhitte, or the west point of the bay, west, distant about two leagues; and the east point of the bay N. by E. four or five miles.

Soon after we had anchored, several of the natives came off in their canoes; two from one shore, and one from the other. It required but little address to get three or four of them on board. These people were extravagantly fond of nails above every other thing. To one man I gave two cocks and two hens, which he received with so much indifference as gave me little hopes he would take proper care of them.

We had not been at anchor here above two hours, before the wind veered to N.E., with which we weighed, but the anchor was hardly at the bows before it shifted to south. With this we could but just lead out of the bay.

=== Musket wars and the fall of Rangitatau ===
The citadel of Rangitatu was sacked and destroyed in late 1819–1820. The attack was led by Tuwhare the Toa. The first people killed at the pa were working in nearby kumara fields. They included: Te Urahi and Puahu of Ngati Rangi, Te Wawapo of Ngati Ira, Takatua of Ngati Rakai, and a number of others, including Pauata, Kopani, Te Rongarua, Puakato, Hungahunga, Koroua and Huatoki, all men. Women slain were Huirua, Te Arahe, Pukurua, Te Koki, Te Rehu, Tangiaru, Hineuhi and Tihitihi. In all some 50 died.

Henry Maynard Christie recorded in 1899 that the burned totara palisades were still in the ground.

The land of Miramar was held by Te Āti Awa 20 years later when the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840.

=== Farming ===
James Coutts Crawford arrived in Wellington in 1839 and purchased five land orders from The New Zealand Company for 1,300 guineas, which included five acres of town land and 5,000 acres of country land, thus he acquired the Miramar peninsula which was then known as &quot;Watt&#x27;s Peninsula&quot;. Crawford established his cattle farm at the north end of the lake and named it &quot;Glendavar&quot;. Crawford wrote in 1840 that the hills were &quot;chiefly clothed with the common fern mixed with flax&quot; and:the flat may be said to have been chiefly occupied by water spread over about 200 acres of central area, and the water from it extended up the large swamps both to the north and south, lying, in general, nearly flush with the surface of the swamps.Henry Maynard Christie documented two farms on the peninsula by 1847 which he called &quot;Glandavar&quot; and &quot;Tetcott&quot;. Glandavar was in the north end close under the hills. Tetcott was owned by Francis Molesworth and was in the south east corner of the plain. Christie also mentions that Māori brought eels from Heretaunga (Hutt River) and kept them in the lake as a store.

The Rotokura/Burnham Waters lake was drained by James Coutts Crawford via a drainage tunnel built in 1847 (and widened in 1859) which was apparently New Zealand&#x27;s first tunnel. This tunnel through Rongotai ridge is still there north of the &#x27;Wellington&#x27; sign on Shelly Bay Road.

James Coutts Crawford named his house &quot;Miramar&quot; which is Spanish for &quot;sea view&quot;. When the farmland was purchased by the City Council in 1901 to be sold for housing, the land was named as &quot;Miramar Estate&quot; which lead to the suburb retaining the name &quot;Miramar&quot;.

New Zealand&#x27;s first permanent racecourse was created in 1847 in Miramar: The &quot;Wellington Independent&quot; published the announcement of the new race course on 2 October 1847 as: &quot;The undersigned, having made arrangement with the proprietor of the land situated between Burnham Water, and Lyall&#x27;s Bay, for the formation of a Race Course&quot;.

In the 1880s the &quot;Russian Scare&quot; was gripping the nation, with people fearing an invasion by Russia. New Zealand embarked on building fortifications to defend itself from attack by sea. In an era when naval power was based mainly on battleships, Miramar Peninsula&#x27;s strategic position made it ideal for coastal guns to prevent enemy warships from entering Wellington Harbour. Large coastal artillery fortifications were built at Fort Ballance in 1885, and at Fort Dorset from 1908

=== Miramar Borough ===
In the first years of the 20th century Miramar was still within &quot;Hutt County&quot; (which encompassed the whole Wellington region south of the Waikanae river, excluding Wellington City). The rates levied by the county in 1902 rose from ¼d per £1 of the property&#x27;s value up to a new rate of 1d per £1 of value. Very little had been spent in Miramar by the county for the previous decade, and locals expressed their anger at the increased rates, resulting in a reduction back to ¾d per £1. A local resident (Mr C.J. Crawford) contested this in the Supreme Court, winning a ruling that &quot;the rate charged must be in accordance with service rendered in each Riding&quot;. The anger continued when the Hutt County Council threatened to appeal to the Privy Council. A petition was collected among Miramar residents and presented to the Governor, and on 10 November 1904 the Seatoun Road Board District was constituted as a Borough and proclaimed in the New Zealand Gazette. Mr C.J. Crawford was subsequently elected the first Mayor of Miramar Borough Council. Miramar was not yet linked to Wellington city by road. There were three ferries from Miramar, Karaka Bay and Seatoun wharves. Some early accounts mention a land approach by &quot;rough bullock track&quot; over Constable Street hill over the sand isthmus. Miramar plain was entirely surrounded by hills at this time. Miramar Borough amalgamated with Wellington City on 31 January 1921.

=== 1900s ===
Miramar Gas Works open in 1907(closed 1972) 

Shelly bay Naval base opened in 1907 and expanded in World War Two when ownership was transferred from the navy to the newly formed Air Force.

Wonderland amusement park opened in Miramar in 1907. It included a Japanese Tea-House, distorting mirrors, a helter-skelter and an artificial lake. The park ran into financial troubles in 1910 and was sold to new owners, then shut permanently in 1912.

=== 1910s ===
A brick factory operated on the eastern hills from 1919 to 1968. All that remains now is a brick wall lining Ira street. The streets of Miramar plain were lined with red bricks as curbing. Some still remain in south Miramar streets.

=== 1920s ===
Miramar Borough amalgamated with Wellington City on 31 January 1921.

Rongotai aerodrome opened in 1929. This was in approximately the same location as Burger King Miramar is today.

=== 1930s ===
New Zealand&#x27;s first state house was built at 7 Fife Lane Miramar. Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage and several cabinet ministers helped to carry in the furniture of Wellington bus conductor David McGregor and his wife Mary on 18 September 1937.

=== 1940s ===
In the 1940s and the Second World War the peninsula was still an important component of an evolving coastal defence system, designed to protect the capital, harbour and hinterland from naval attack. . A lookout post was built at Palmer Head in 1938. In the Second World War, the advent of naval air power made these coastal fortifications largely redundant, because an enemy could carry out aerial attacks, using planes launched from aircraft carriers well beyond the range of even the largest shore-based guns.

=== 1950s ===
The hill to the west of the Miramar plain was flattened in the 1950s and used to reclaim land from the sea to form the new airport runway. The residential street of Rongotai Tce ran along the hill ridge and was completely removed and all houses demolished. Over the years since the airport was built the suburb names have drifted location. The houses in south west Miramar from the gasometer to the golf course were in Rongotai but the name has now drifted south west towards Rongotai College. Likewise a shore point named &quot;Moa point&quot; was subsumed into the southern end of the runway resulting in the name now only being used by to describe remaining houses to the east.

Wellington Airport in its current location was opened on 24 October 1959, replacing Rongotai Aerodrome.

=== 21st century ===
In early November 2023, Miramar Peninsula was declared pest free. This was the result of 11,000 bait stations, 450 cameras, and the work of 20,000 Miramar residents. This resulted in a 71% increase in birdlife since the project began.

<text>Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation, known in Europe &amp; Australia as Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Reverie, is a 1995 role-playing video game developed by Heartbeat and published by Enix for the Super Famicom as a part of the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series and as the last &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game in the Zenithian Trilogy. It was released in Japan in December 1995, developed by Heartbeat; whereas the previous &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games were developed by Chunsoft. In 2011, a remake of the game, along with &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot;, was released worldwide for the Nintendo DS, making this the first time the game was released in English. Another version of the game for Android and iOS devices was released in Japan in June 2015.

As the sixth installment to the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series, the graphics and gameplay remain close to the other games, with minor additions and upgrades. The graphics were vastly improved from &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot;, which was also for the Super Famicom, but had more rudimentary graphics due to being an early game on the console. Navigation remains largely unchanged from the previous games and the turn-based battles are still in first-person. The class system from &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; returns, with minor adjustments. &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; sold over three million copies in Japan, becoming the best selling game of 1995. The DS version sold an additional one million copies by March 2010.

The story follows the traditional &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; &quot;Hero&quot; on a quest to save the world. In this particular installment, the heroes also have to endure the personal struggle of amnesia, as many of the main characters do not initially remember who they are. After completing a series of quests, the player learns that in addition to a Real World, there is also a Dream World, made up of people&#x27;s dreams, and that there is a great evil that wants to conquer both. The Hero and his new party work together to save both worlds from the ever-growing threat.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; is a traditional, turn-based role-playing video game (in an overhead perspective) that features random battles and a character class system that the Hero and his party members acquire new skills and spells.

The Hero travels around the world gathering a party throughout his adventure. To progress in the story, the party must defeat specific boss monsters or trigger specific flags. In order to defeat the bosses, the player must spend time training the party by gaining experience points from battles to advance in character and class levels.

Other new features were added to the series, such as: the monsters being animated when they attack. The Slime Arena and Best Dresser Contest were new mini-games introduced; the casinos return from previous &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games.

Like previous games, mini medals can be found hidden throughout the worlds and can be traded for items. There are bonus dungeons and a few extra characters after beating the main storyline. There is a day and night system, as in some previous installments; with certain storyline events happening at night.

While the Monster Master class can catch monsters in the original Super Famicom version it is not a major part of the game. Another returning feature from the past two games is the use of the wagon, which allows characters to be swapped out for other ones on the world map.

=== Class system ===
This &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, similar to &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot;, has a class system. Once the party gets to Alltrades Abbey, they have the option of becoming one of several starter classes. Each class has eight levels, which are gained by winning a specific number of battles (unlike character levels, which are gained by earning experience points), and advancing in level teaches a character new spells and / or skills, which are retained across class changes.

Once a character has mastered a specific set of two or three starter classes, they can change into a hybrid class that builds on their themes. For example: mastering Warrior and Martial Artist unlocks the Gladiator Class, which learns powerful physical attacks, and mastering certain hybrid classes unlocks the Hero class.

Some of the classes give special bonuses beyond their stats and abilities such as the Merchant who gives a small bonus to the party&#x27;s income after every battle, or the Sage who receives a discount to MP costs.

To master a class, the character must fight a set number of battles as that class. Once certain hybrid classes are mastered, a stat relating to that class will permanently go up. There are two secret classes as well, Dragon (Hackasaurus) and Liquid Metal Slime, which are unlocked through consumable books.

Dragon Quest VI was the first game in the series to include (special attacks and other techniques that are not spells and usually do not cost MP) for human party members. These special techniques were added to the remakes of III, IV and V later on.

==Plot==

===Setting===
Like the other &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games in the series, the setting of &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; is medieval, complete with castles, knights, and magic. The main world is divided into the &quot;Real World&quot; and &quot;Dream World&quot;, each with a separate, but similar map. To get from one world to the other, the party uses special warps (such as in wells), by ascending/descending stairs on the world map or falling through holes in the &quot;Dream World&quot; to the &quot;Real World&quot;. If something cannot be found in the &quot;Real World&quot;, it may appear in the &quot;Dream World&quot;, such as with Spiegelspire, at the middle of the game.

===Story===
&quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; opens as the Hero and his party of a mysterious woman and a bulky man approach Murdaw, the demon king&#x27;s castle. After the woman uses an ocarina to summon a dragon, the party enters the castle and comes face to face with the Dreadfiend Murdaw (Demon King Mudō &quot;魔王ムドー&quot; in Japanese version). Overpowering the trio, the demon king appears to destroy each member of the party, but suddenly, the Hero wakes up in the mountain town Weaver&#x27;s Peak. Tania, a young woman from Weaver&#x27;s Peak, insists that he was having a bad dream and introduces herself as his sister.

After getting out of bed, the town elder tasks the Hero to get a crown in preparation for the annual Mountain Spirit festival, which takes him to Haggleton. The hero finds out the man who is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The Hero heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds, but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the Hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The Hero receives a tip from one of the townspeople: There is a special well to the north from which people who enter never come back; the Hero heads in that direction, enters the well, and returns to his world.

After receiving the ceremonial crown from the crown maker for no charge after saving his life, the Hero heads back to Weaver&#x27;s Peak just in time for the festival to begin. During the festival, the Hero receives a mysterious vision that a great evil will take over the world; the elder asks him to leave the village in preparation for this disaster. The next day, the Hero finds out that the world that he stumbled onto was called the &quot;Phantom World&quot; and is given a pass by the elder that allows him entry into Somnia, where he can meet the king.

At Somnia, the Hero meets Carver, who does not seem to remember the Hero. The Hero then meets Captain Blade, leader of Somnia&#x27;s military, who gives the potential soldier candidates a task to find a special item in a tower. The Hero manages to find this item successfully and formally becomes a soldier of Somnia. After a task, the Hero and Carver work together to obtain a horse for an old man. Carver also becomes a soldier of Somnia. The Hero and Carver speak to the king, who informs them that to defeat Murdaw, they need the Mirror of Ra. The Hero and Carver discover another portal similar to the one near Haggleton, which eventually leads them to Port Haven, another town where they can not be seen. Milly, also appearing to have lost her memory, sees them and helps them become visible via Madame Luca&#x27;s help.

The party discovers a Somnia Castle in the “Phantom World” and learns that the prince—who looks like the Hero—is missing. They also meet Captain Rusty, who bears a striking resemblance to Captain Blade. Gaining entrance to the Moonmirror Tower, the party meets Ashlynn, a woman who was invisible in the “Phantom World” at first, too, and together they find the Mirror of Ra.

The party travels to Murdaw&#x27;s castle in the original world. After defeating Murdaw, the Hero uses the Mirror on him. Murdaw then turns into the King of Somnia, confused and unaware of what happened. The king reveals that the original world is in fact the Dream World and the Phantom World is the Real World. Upon traveling back to the Real World, the King of Somnia thanks the party for defeating Murdaw in his dreams, but the real Murdaw lives and that the party must travel to Ghent to retrieve a boat to get to Murdaw&#x27;s lair. In Ghent, Nevan, a healer, joins the party and allows them to use the Ghent Clan&#x27;s ship. During the fight with the real Murdaw, the Hero is again sent back to Weaver&#x27;s Peak. With the Mirror of Ra, however, the Hero warps back into the battle and defeats Murdaw.

The Queen of Somnia tells the Hero to discover who he really is. This quest leads the party to Arkbolt, where a terrible monster is blocking a nearby cave. The reward for defeating the monster is the famed Sunderbolt Blade, but before the party can strike the final blow, a warrior by the name of Terry kills the monster, winning the sword. After traveling both worlds, the party learns that Murdaw was not the only evil in the world, having fought several other monsters that all seem to be connected.

In Sorceria, the party learns that this is Ashlynn&#x27;s home. The elders tell Ashlynn that the Demon Lord is watching her and give her the powerful spell Magic Burst to fight him. The party also learns that the only way to get to the Demon Lord is through Zenith Tower, but to activate the tower, they need to collect the sword, armor, shield, and helmet of legend. While doing so, the Hero meets his double in Real Weaver&#x27;s Peak, who gets spooked, and speaks &#x27;Y-You. Y-You&#x27;re m-m-me!&#x27;, and says that he must prove himself to be faithful to his family if he is to join powers. Returning to Real Somnia, the King and Queen tell the Hero that he is indeed the prince. When he fused with his clone, the Hero gained his memory back, much like Ashlynn and Carver previously.

The party reaches Cloudsgate Citadel and meets Dhuran (デュラン), who claims to have taken over the castle. He summons Terry to fight the party and then fights the party himself. Dhuran then reveals that all the enemies the party has faced were just pawns of Mortamor, the Archfiend. Milly reveals that Terry is her brother and Terry decides to join the party and fight against Mortamor.

Once Cloudsgate Citadel returns to normal, the party speaks to King Zenith who informs them of Mortamor&#x27;s doings and how to reach the Dread Realm. Mortamor plans on merging both worlds. The party&#x27;s horse fuses with Pegasus, allowing the party to fly to the Dread Realm. Several challenges await in the Dread Realm, including the party&#x27;s strength suddenly and unexpectedly plummeting. With the help of two Supreme Sage brothers, Benjamin and Isaac, the party enters Mortamor&#x27;s Castle. After solving many puzzles, they come face to face with Mortamor and defeat him. Isaac reveals that the Dread Realm is falling apart and Pegasus helps them escape. After returning to the Real World, everyone parts ways, with Ashlynn having to return to the Dream World since her Real World self no longer exists. With Mortamor&#x27;s link between the Real World and the Dream World severed, the Dream World vanishes, with only Cloudgate Castle remaining visible in the Real World. Ashlynn is then shown in the castle, taking care of the newly hatched Zenithian Dragon.

==Development==

===Production===
The scenario designer, as in all previous &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games, was Yuji Horii. Similarly, the lead artist was Akira Toriyama and the sound was composed by Koichi Sugiyama. This is the last game in the series to feature in the Zenithia (天空の城, &quot;Tenkū no Shiro&quot; lit. &quot;Sky Castle&quot;) trilogy. The appearance of the character Terry was originally Toriyama&#x27;s design for the game&#x27;s Hero, but it was rejected by Horii and given to a companion instead.

A prequel, &quot;Dragon Warrior Monsters&quot; (&quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Terry&#x27;s Wonderland&quot; in Japan), was released in 1998. This game featured Terry and Milly years before the events of &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot;. It was released in North America the next year, even though &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; was never released in North America. Along with Terry and Milly, several of the main enemies, including Mortamor, reappear. Their previous roles have been eliminated, however, making them appear as just normal enemies. Mortamor and Murdaw (DeathMore and Mudou, respectively, in the localization) do appear as very challenging, very late in-game bosses, though.

===Release===
The initial release was delayed over a year because of Enix wanting to further develop their game. The game was eventually shown at Shoshinkai in November 1995. &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; was released a few weeks later on December 9, with the very steep price of 11,400 yen (roughly over 100 U.S. dollars). The game went on to sell over 3.2 million copies. In Japan, the game made the news in 2005, when a Japanese student threatened another student over an argument about which &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; is the best, the student doing the threatening favoring &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot;.

Like its predecessor, &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; did not receive an English-language localization because of being cost-ineffective. At 4MB, it was one of the largest games made for the Super Famicom as well as the largest the console could support without adding bank-switching circuitry to the cartridge, and translating it would have necessitated even bigger and more expensive ROMs. In addition, the game was a late release for the Super Famicom and by the time an English localization could be finished, Enix had already dropped support for the console in North America and moved to the PlayStation.

=== Nintendo DS remake ===
The &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; enhanced remake for the Nintendo DS was announced in late 2007 by Square Enix and was developed by ArtePiazza. The game was released in Japan on January 28, 2010, in North America on February 14, 2011, and in Europe on May 20, 2011.

This version has a few differences

* The after-battle monster recruitment has been removed. In the original 1995 Super Famicom version of Dragon Quest VI, certain types of monsters can be randomly recruited if they are defeated with a Monster Master in the party. In the 2010 DS remake, this system has been removed, instead, there are certain Slimes that will join you once you accomplish a specific task. Lizzie still remains recruitable.
* Since this version comes with a built in map of both worlds on the top of the screen, the World Map and the Magic Map have been removed.
* The &#x27;Tag Mode&#x27; system from Dragon Quest IX has been implemented, which allows wireless communication and data transfer between two DS systems.
* A Slime Curling mini-game was added.
* The names of the following characters from this game were changed in Dragon Quest IX as follows: Mireille (Mireyu) as Milly, Hassan as Carver, Barbara (Bābara) as Ashlynn, Redach (Reidakku) as Somnia, and San Marino as Port Haven.

On April 28, 2008, it was reported that Square Enix has applied for the trademark &quot;The Realms of Reverie&quot; at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, leading to speculation that it was the localized title for this game. On May 20, 2008, Square Enix opened up the North American site featuring the three Dragon Quest DS remakes, acknowledging &quot;Realms of Reverie&quot; as the official subtitle, as well as confirming a release in North America. The title was later changed to &quot;Realms of Revelation&quot; just prior to release. Listings in some stores, including on price tags and the like, still use the &quot;Reverie&quot; title.

Mark Franklin, director of Public Relations at Nintendo, made the claim that &quot;Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation&quot; “will give fans unique access to a classic game in the series for the first time” outside Japan.

The iOS and Android versions replaced the orchestrated music with the synthesized MIDI music in the title screen, which is performed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra. However, the synthesized music is entirely remastered in the iOS and Android versions, other than the synthesized music in the DS version.

=== Soundtracks ===

As with every &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, Koichi Sugiyama composed the music and directed all the associated spinoffs. Three soundtracks were released for the music of &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot;. The first was a two-disk soundtrack, which included an orchestral performance and an OST. The second soundtrack was released on August 23, 2000, and just had the orchestral version. This version was released by SPE Visual Works (now Aniplex), and was named &quot;Dragon Quest VI ~The Dream World~ Symphonic Suite&quot;. This version was featured on &quot;Dragon Quest Daizenshu Vol. 2&quot;, which is a compilation of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; music. A second Symphonic Suite edition of the OST was performed in March 2005 and released on July 19, 2006, also by Aniplex. The Symphonic Suite track list is as follows:

===Manga===
A 10-volume manga adaptation of the game was also made, which titled . It was authored by Masaomi Kanzaki and published by Enix in the &quot;Monthly Shōnen Gangan&quot; between 1997 and 2001. The storyline roughly follows that of the video game from which it was based but with several differences, such as the inclusion of the character Kizu Buchi, a spotted slime.

==Reception==
Kurt Kalata of &quot;Gamasutra&quot; praised the game&#x27;s storyline, particularly its innovative scenario. While comparable to the light-dark world setting of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; featured a unique real world and dream world setting, which he suggests had an influence on the later Square role-playing games &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. Kalata also praised the gameplay improvements, including its class system that improves on &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; and is now more similar to &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;, and the addition of a bag that improves on the inventory management of previous games. He concludes that it is &quot;still a fantastic game.&quot;

===Sales===

Despite the very high price of (), &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; launched with 1,274,857 sales, and sold in December alone. It went on to sell copies in Japan, resulting in it becoming the best-selling game of 1995. In 2010, &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; for the Nintendo DS sold almost a million copies in Japan in its first week. The game sold over 1.2 million copies by March 2010.

According to &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; was originally planned for North American release in the spring of 1996 under the title &quot;&quot;Dragon Warrior V&quot;.&quot; The Super NES localization of the game never happened, however, as Enix had already given up on the U.S. market. Square, one of the only companies still willing to bring console role-playing video games to the United States, was also still struggling to get their games to sell in the United States, and therefore, &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; had no companies willing to take a risk for it. In &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; vol. 81, the staff wrote an article on &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot;, hoping the game would find a North American release. They also suggested why the series might not appeal to the American audience: there is too much fighting and not enough adventuring. Other critics have mentioned that class building becomes tedious and that the dual worlds are too overwhelming, both possible reasons against a US release. &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; was listed as #7 among the 10 Best Japanese Games Never Released in the U.S. by &quot;GamePro&quot; magazine in their May 2005 issue.

<text>Henrik Johan Walbeck (11 October 1793 – 23 October 1822) was a Finnish geodesist and astronomer who studied the size and figure of the Earth by means of arc measurements.

Walbeck was born in Turku (Åbo). In 1817, he was made a corresponding member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and, in 1820, of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Mathematische Gesellschaft in Hamburg. He committed suicide in 1822, also in Åbo.

The asteroid 1695 Walbeck is named after him.

<text>Karl Gottlieb Bretschneider (February 11, 1776 in Gersdorf, Saxony – January 22, 1848 in Gotha, Thuringia) was a German Protestant scholar and theologian from Gersdorf, Saxony. He is noted for, among other things, having planned and founded the monumental &quot;Corpus Reformatorum&quot;. He is the father of Carl Anton Bretschneider, a mathematician.

In 1794, he entered the University of Leipzig, where he studied theology for four years. After some years of hesitation he resolved to be ordained, and in 1802 he passed with great distinction the examination for candidatus theologiae, and attracted the regard of Franz Volkmar Reinhard (1753–1812), author of the &quot;System der christlichen Moral&quot; (1788–1815), then court-preacher at Dresden, who became his warm friend and patron during the remainder of his life.

From 1804 to 1806, Bretschneider was &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at the University of Wittenberg, where he lectured on philosophy and theology. During this time he wrote his work on the development of dogma, &quot;Systematische Entwicklung aller in der Dogmatik vorkommenden Begriffe nach den symbolischen Schriften der evangelisch-lutherischen und reformirten Kirche&quot; (1805, 4th edition 1841), which was followed by others, including an edition of Sirach with a Latin commentary.

On the advance of the French army under Napoleon into Prussia, he determined to leave Wittenberg and abandon his university career. Through the good offices of Reinhard, he became pastor of Schneeberg in Saxony (1807). In 1808, he was promoted to the office of superintendent of the church of Annaberg, in which capacity he had to decide, in accordance with the Canon law of Saxony, many matters belonging to the department of ecclesiastical law. But the climate did not agree with him, and his official duties interfered with his theological studies. With a view to a change he took the degree of doctor of theology in Wittenberg in August 1812. In 1816, he was appointed general superintendent at Gotha, where he remained until his death. This was the great period of his literary activity.

In 1820, was published his treatise on the Gospel of John, entitled &quot;Probabilia de evangelii et epistolarum Ioannis Apostoli indole et origine cruditorum&quot;, which attracted much attention. In this work, he collected with great fulness and discussed with marked moderation the arguments against Johannine authorship. This called forth a number of replies. To the astonishment of every one, Bretschneider announced in the preface to the second edition of his &quot;Dogmatik&quot; in 1822, that he had never doubted the authenticity of the gospel, and had published his &quot;Probabilia&quot; only to draw attention to the subject, and to call forth a more complete defence of its genuineness.

Bretschneider remarks in his autobiography that the publication of this work had the effect of preventing his appointment as successor to Karl Christian Tittmann (1744–1820) in Dresden, the minister Detlev von Einsiedel (1773–1861) denouncing him as the slanderer of John (&quot;Johannisschander&quot;). His greatest contribution to the science of exegesis was his &quot;Lexicon Manuale Graeco-Latinum in libros Novi Testamenti&quot; (1824, 3rd edition 1840). This work was valuable for the use which its author made of the Greek of the Septuagint, of the Old and New Testament Apocrypha, of Josephus, and of the apostolic fathers, in illustration of the language of the New Testament.

In 1826, he published &quot;Apologie der neuern Theologie des evangelischen Deutschlands&quot;. Hugh James Rose had published in England (1825) a volume of sermons on the rationalist movement (&quot;The State of the Protestant Religion in Germany&quot;), in which he classed Bretschneider with the rationalists; and Bretschneider contended that he himself was not a rationalist in the ordinary sense of the term, but a rational supernaturalist. Some of his numerous dogmatic writings passed through several editions. An English translation of his &quot;Manual of the Religion and History of the Christian Church&quot; appeared in 1857.

His dogmatic position seems to be intermediate between the extreme school of naturalists, such as Heinrich Paulus, Johann Friedrich Röhr (1777–1848) and Julius Wegscheider on the one hand, and DF Strauss and FC Baur on the other. Recognizing a supernatural element in the Bible, he nevertheless allowed to the full the critical exercise of reason in the interpretation of its dogmas (cp. Otto Pfleiderer, &quot;Development of Theology&quot;, pp. 89 ff.).
