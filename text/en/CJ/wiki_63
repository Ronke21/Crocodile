<text>A peace walk or peace march, sometimes referred to as a peace pilgrimage, is a form of nonviolent action where a person or group marches a set distance to raise awareness for particular issues important to the walkers.
== 350 km Long Peace Walk New Zealand==
Kharlzada Kasrat Rai, twice the World Record holder for Peace Walks, has devoted his life for the cause of Peace, Education, Health and Cultural activities. He has achieved a widespread fame for the sake of his noble cause.

He has conducted several walks with the flag of peace within and beyond the boundaries of Pakistan.

In 2020, he made a 350 km Long Peace Walk from Wellington to Christchurch in commemoration of the Christchurch Mosques Attack. He is doing this walk voluntarily for the sake of humanity and Peace. The Peace Walk will start from New Zealand Parliament on 5 March.

==India==
Starting in 1951, Vinoba Bhave undertook a peace walk with many of his followers throughout India for land reform. He walked for more than a decade, asking landowners to consider him a son and give him one-sixth of their land for him to distribute to the poor.

A peace walk campaign called &quot;Freedom Walk&quot; was organized by the Free Software Community in Kerala in 2008. Four volunteers walked from one end of the state to the other to promote free software.

==Europe==
During the Second World War, peace pilgrimages took place across Europe with the aim of bringing an end to the conflict. In Italy, pilgrims prayed at Loreto and Assisi. In Wales they went on pilgrimage to St David&#x27;s Cathedral, in France they went on pilgrimage to Our Lady of Pontmain who had saved the French in an earlier war. In Ireland and Switzerland, pilgrims prayed that the war would not spread across their borders.

===Hungary and Italy===
In 2014, a group launched the first permanent peace walk route, which runs from Budapest along the former division between Eastern and Western Europe, and ends in Trieste, Italy. Donol Corcoran of Ireland had completed the &quot;European Peace Walk&quot; six times by July 2019.

 A peace walk for the Unity of Hungary occurred in March 2014.

===United Kingdom===
In 1984, members of a peace camp walked 26 miles from RAF Daws Hill to Naphill through country roads to raise money for &quot;The Angry Pacifist&quot; magazine.

==United States==

Various peace organizations throughout the United States organized marches to protest wars, including the Iraq War, on a regular basis. Sometimes these marches are coordinated to take place on the same day across the nation. In San Diego, the greatest number of anti-war protesters, an estimated 7,000, turned out for a demonstration on 15 March 2003, five days before the beginning of the Iraq War.

Native Americans have organized numerous cross-country peace walks, including the &quot;Longest Walk&quot; in 1978 and the &quot;Long Walk for Survival&quot; in 1980. The projects raised awareness not only for peace, but environmental issues and protection of native sites. In 1984, several walks crossed the nation, including &quot;On the Line,&quot; which traced the route of trains carrying nuclear weapons from Bangor Base, Washington, to Charleston, South Carolina, and the &quot;Peace Pilgrimage of Europeans.&quot;

The Carter-King Peace Walk at Freedom Park in Atlanta opened in 2003. The 1.5-mile stretch connects the landmarks that commemorate the only two Georgia winners of the Nobel Peace Prize: Martin Luther King Jr. and Jimmy Carter.

The Bridge Walk for Peace is held every year since 2008 on April 4 in Philadelphia to commemorate the assassination anniversary of Dr. King is the longest such observance in the country. The event gathers individuals at sunrise at the foot of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge to walk to the pinnacle and offer a prayer for peace.

==International==
===From India across the world===
From 1963 to 1965, two members of Gandhi&#x27;s Sarvodaya movement, Satish Kumar and E.P. Menon, walked an estimated 8,000 miles from New Delhi to Washington, D.C., via Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Russia, Poland, Germany, France, and Belgium. They crossed the channel and Atlantic Ocean via ships. Their prior experience of Bhave gave two gifts to Kumar and Menon: pennilessness, i.e. voluntary poverty, and vegetarianism.

From 1982 through 1986, Prem Kumar walked more than 17,000 kilometers (about 10,500 miles) around the world for international peace and disarmament. He organized walks in India involving participants from all over the world and founded social service organizations.

===Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life===
The &quot;Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life&quot; started in Auschwitz, Poland, on 8 December 1994, and ended in Nagasaki on the 50th anniversary of the Nagasaki bombing on 9 August 1995. It was led by Nipponzan-Myōhōji-Daisanga Japanese Buddhist monks. The monks, however, were dwarfed in number by American, European, South American, and Japanese lay people.

The trip was organized to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II as well as to be a witness to suffering in contemporary war zones. From Auschwitz, the group walked to Vienna, then traveled through Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. They crossed the front lines of the Bosnian War in Mostar and held a day of vigil, fasting and prayer there. The next leg took them through Israel, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Jordan and Iraq.

The group traveled across the front lines in Cambodia, where they joined the Dhammayietra, an annual Cambodian peace walk led by Maha Ghosananda, known by some as the &quot;Gandhi of Cambodia.&quot; They then visited war sites in Vietnam and the Philippines before going to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

This walk was one of many peace pilgrimages organized by the Nipponzan-Myōhōji-Daisanga monks, but this one was among the largest and longest. More than 1,000 people participated in at least part of the pilgrimage, including Buddhists, Quakers, Catholics, Muslims and Jews.

===A Walk to Moscow===

&quot;A Walk to Moscow&quot; was one of many walks for peace in the 20th century. They were specially organized by groups of pacifists and peace activists who wanted to protest against the politics of war and the use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.

In 1960–61, the Committee for Non-Violent Action organized the &quot;San Francisco to Moscow Walk for Peace.&quot; The group covered some 6,000 miles in ten months and was able to walk through Russia. Walk organizer Bradford Lyttle wrote a book on the project called &quot;You Come with Naked Hands.&quot;

In 1981–83, a group walked across the United States and Europe to Moscow to show solidarity with all people and to demonstrate in a grassroots way that all people are linked by their right to live on the earth in peace and safety. This walk was conceived by organizers while on another peace walk called &quot;A Walk for Survival&quot;, which went from Santa Cruz, California, to Bangor Base, Washington, in 1980. While at a requested meeting with the Russian Consulate in San Francisco, co-organizer Jack Chalmers asked if the group continued to walk eastward across the U.S. and then to Europe, would it be allowed to walk to Moscow? The Consulate official answered, &quot;Of course.&quot;

So when &quot;A Walk for Survival&quot; ended at the site of a Trident nuclear submarine base in Bangor, organizers immediately started planning &quot;A Walk to Moscow.&quot; The project began in Bangor on 1 March 1981, and reached the East Coast in time to stay for the winter in Boston. Members flew to Europe in March 1982 and walked across the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Federal Republic of Germany. Members took some side trips to Ireland and West Berlin by bus, returning to the starting point so the walking route could continue uninterrupted. Advance teams were sent a few weeks ahead to cities and towns along a prospective route to organize media opportunities, speaking engagements and accommodations. Decisions were made by complete consensus, which often led to long and stormy meetings.

The German Democratic Republic had refused entry to the group, so members walked south to Bavaria and stayed there for the winter while negotiating for visas to enter Czechoslovakia, Poland and the USSR. &quot;A Walk to Moscow&quot; (the indefinite article, rather than the definite &quot;The Walk,&quot; was important to many original walkers, as it implied that it was only one initiative and others would hopefully follow. The distinction was, however, lost on people in the Eastern countries as Slavonic languages do not have words for &quot;an&quot; or &quot;the.&quot;) spent nearly a year in Europe working from an old mill house in Regnitzlosau, Germany.

It was difficult to get the governments then in the Communist Bloc to allow the group to walk through their territory. While some group members negotiated, other walkers visited places on foot in Germany and gave talks to local peace groups. Some members got involved in passive resistance, chaining themselves to railings over conscription in Germany, and others fasted for peace in the world. Some went to Denmark to meet with peace groups and talk about the walk.

In 1983, visas were obtained for Czechoslovakia and Poland, and a continuous walking route was planned and successfully carried out as far as the border between Poland and the USSR. Relations with official peace groups in those countries were tricky; the Czech government tried to incorporate the initiative into its showpiece pro-Warsaw Pact 1983 conference in Prague. However, the group did not participate, although a few members lobbied delegates outside and were invited in for one discussion.

Walking across the USSR was not permitted, however. The group entered and transited to Minsk, then Smolensk, hoping for some compromise in negotiations. But that did not happen. At this point, many members chose to return and not go to Moscow; some tried to walk to Moscow anyway but were immediately apprehended and sent to rejoin the others in Minsk. When the walk finished, some people from the group talked at a CND rally about their work and the passive resistance movement. The group membership was international, as people came from all over the world to join and make a difference.

Some Walk to Moscow participants later met with other walks that crossed the U.S. and Europe, including Walk of the People - A Pilgrimage for Life, which occurred from 1984 to 1985. That project was also not allowed to walk in Russia, but some members rode a train to Moscow to meet with officials and ordinary people.

===Women Cross DMZ===

The Women Cross DMZ (Korean demilitarized zone) group, which included noted American feminist and activist Gloria Steinem, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire, and organizer Christine Ahn, conducted a peace symposium in Pyongyang in May 2015. The all-women group was allowed to cross the DMZ, separating North and South Korea, for peace a few days after the symposium.

On 24 May 2015, International Women&#x27;s Day for Disarmament, thirty women— including feminist leader Gloria Steinem, two Nobel Peace laureates and retired Colonel Ann Wright— from 15 different countries linked arms with 10,000 Korean women, stationing themselves on both sides of the DMZ to urge a formal end to the Korean War (1950–1953), the reunification of families divided during the war, and a peace building process with women in leadership positions to resolve decades of hostility. It was unusual for South Korea and North Korea to reach consensus on allowing peace activists to enter the tense border area, one of the world&#x27;s most dangerous places, where hundreds of thousands of troops are stationed in a heavily mined zone that divides South Korea from nuclear North Korea.

In the weeks leading up to the walk, feminist Gloria Steinem told the press, &quot;It’s hard to imagine any more physical symbol of the insanity of dividing human beings.&quot;

On the day of the crossing, South Korea refused to give the women permission to walk through Panmunjom, a border town where the 1953 truce was signed, so the women had to eventually cross the border by bus. Nevertheless, Steinem labeled the crossing a success. &quot;We have accomplished what no one said can be done, which is to be a trip for peace, for reconciliation, for human rights and a trip to which both governments agreed.&quot;

In addition to Steinem, participants in the crossing included organizer Christine Ahn from Hawaii; feminist Suzuyo Takazato from Okinawa; Amnesty International human rights lawyer Erika Guevara of Mexico; Liberian peace and reconciliation advocate Leymah Gbowee; Philippines lawmaker Liza Maza; Northern Ireland peace activist Mairead Maguire and Colonel Ann Wright, a retired officer who resigned from the U.S. military to protest the US invasion of Iraq.

Supporters of the crossing met criticism with insistence that war, which divides and destroys families, impacts women, as well as men; therefore, if governments led by men cannot or will not lead the peace process, grassroots women have every right to take to the streets—and even the DMZ. Participants said the crossing focused global attention on the unnecessarily protracted Korean War, with support from world leaders, including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama, former US President Jimmy Carter and South Korean lawmakers.

For Ahn and the others, the crossing symbolized a reaffirmation of peace through dialogue, as opposed to an escalating arms race.

Crossing participant Kozue Akibayashi, International President, Women&#x27;s League for Peace and Freedom, wrote, &quot;Addressing the division and bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula is not only the task for North and South Korea, but a responsibility of the international community.&quot; Akibayashi said Women Cross DMZ strongly condemns the North Korean government&#x27;s human rights violations while recognizing that such violations must be viewed through the lens of a &quot;society where the priorities of the military outweigh the basic needs of its people.&quot; Akibayashi also featured as a keynote speaker at the first annual Peace Education Conference, held virtually in September 2021.

<doc id="1102559" wikidata="Q524154" url="?curid=1102559" title="Eugène Grasset">
<text>Eugène Samuel Grasset (; 25 May 1845 – 23 October 1917) was a Swiss decorative artist who worked in Paris, France in a variety of creative design fields during the Belle Époque. He is considered a pioneer in Art Nouveau design.

==Biography==
Grasset was born in Lausanne, Switzerland on 25 May 1845. He was raised in an artistic environment as the son of a cabinetmaker and sculptor who taught him at an early age how to use the chisel and the gouge. He studied drawing under Francois-Louis David Bocion (1828–1890) and in 1861 went to Zürich to study architecture. After completing his education, he visited Egypt, an experience that would later be reflected in a number of his poster designs. He became an admirer of Japanese art, which influenced some of his designs as well.

Between 1869 and 1870, Grasset worked as a theater painter and sculptor in Lausanne. Here he met Viollet le Duc, whose reflection on the Middle Ages and the method advocating the link between form, function and material came to permeate Grasset&#x27;s work. In 1871 he moved to Paris and he started to design furniture, wallpapers, fabrics, and tapestries as well as ceramics and jewelry. He created architectural elements of woodwork that were integrated into buildings. His fine art decorative pieces were crafted from ivory, gold, and other precious materials in unique combinations, and his creations are considered a cornerstone of Art Nouveau motifs and patterns.

In 1877 Eugène Grasset turned to graphic design, producing income-generating products such as postcards and eventually postage stamps for both France and Switzerland. It was poster art, based on the work of Viollet le Duc, that quickly became his &quot;forte&quot;. Some of his works became part of the Maîtres de l&#x27;Affiche, including his lithograph, &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc Sarah Bernhardt&quot;. In 1890, he designed the &quot;Semeuse who spreads seeds of dandelion&quot; logo used by the dictionary publishers, Éditions Larousse. Grasset&#x27;s commercial work would be based &quot;on the drawings of Viollet le Duc.&quot; 

With the growing popularity of French posters in the United States, Grasset was soon contacted by several American companies. In the 1880s, he did his first American commission and more success led to his cover design for the 1892 Christmas issue of Harper&#x27;s Magazine. In 1894 he created &quot;The Wooly Horse&quot; and &quot;The Sun of Austerlitz&quot; for &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; to help advertise their serialized story on the life of Napoleon Bonaparte. The &quot;Wooly Horse&quot; image proved so popular that Louis Comfort Tiffany recreated it in stained glass. Grasset&#x27;s work for U.S. institutions helped pave the way for Art Nouveau to dominate American art.

Grasset taught design at the École Guérin from 1890 to 1903, at the École d’Art graphique in the rue Madame from 1903 to 1904, at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière from 1904 to 1913, and at the École Estienne in Paris. Grasset had freely adapted the alphabet of Nicolas Jenson (1471) with the intention of using it to print a book on his own method for ornamental composition, inspired by the courses he gave to the Guérin school. Georges Peignot acquired Grasset&#x27;s alphabet and obtained an official patent on 7 October 1897 for the typeface under the name, &quot;Grasset&quot;. He then gave Henri Parmentier, the workshop&#x27;s punchcutter, the mission to engrave it.

In 1896 he published a dissertation on the use of plants in designs, that featured images of designs prepared by his students. Among his students were Paul Berthon, Georges Bourgeot, Paul Follot, Marcelle Gaudin, Augusto Giacometti, Arsène Herbinier, Anna Martin, Mathurin Méheut, Juliette Milési, Otto Ernst Schmidt, Auguste Silice, Maurice Pillard Verneuil, Aline Poitevin, Pierre Selmersheim, Tony Selmersheim, Camille Gabriel Schlumberger, Eliseu Visconti, and Philippe Wolfers

At the Universal Exhibition of 1900 in Paris, the G. Peignot et Fils typefoundry introduced the &quot;Grasset&quot; typeface, an Italic design created by Eugène Grasset in 1898 for use on some of his posters. Additionally, Grasset collaborated with jeweler Henri Vever, showcasing works such as the intricate &#x27;Hercules&#x27; pendant, praised for its detailed artistry and mythological inspiration.

Grasset died in 1917 in Sceaux in the Hauts-de-Seine département, southwest of Paris.

<text>Stuart Patrick Jude Zender (born 18 March 1974) is an English bassist. He is best known as a former member of the band Jamiroquai.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Zender was born in Sheffield, England. He comes from a family with a musical background: Zender&#x27;s father was a musician, his uncle was a flamenco guitarist, and his older sister participated in punk bands. His family relocated to Norristown, Pennsylvania, when Zender was seven years old. He moved back to England at age 15, where he attended Leighton Park School in Reading, UK, for a year in 1988–89 before being expelled. Zender played the snare drums for his school&#x27;s marching band before he started to play bass at age 16. He practiced the instrument playing by ear to &quot;Black Market&quot; by Weather Report, and he was able to play all of the bass parts in two weeks. Before leaving his home at age 17, Zender&#x27;s mother had saved for him £2,000 for the occasion. Zender initially played in pubs with a punk rock band, but he had creative differences with the band. He recalled being &quot;stuck onstage, playing these little four-chord songs. I would always jazz the whole thing up and start doing solos and things like that, and they would just tell me to shut up.&quot;

Zender admitted that he never had good business acumen, so instead of investing his mother&#x27;s parting cash gift in a traditional way, he visited a music store and bought a Warwick Streamer bass guitar, which cost nearly the whole amount given to him by his mother. Before picking up a Warwick, Zender played a Music Man Stingray bass guitar. Of his early bands, the most famous was the prank rock group Fabulous, a 1991 outfit chiefly made up of &quot;NME&quot; writers and photographers.

=== Jamiroquai (1993–1998) ===
Zender met Jamiroquai&#x27;s original drummer Nick van Gelder through his sister. He auditioned for the band in 1993 as the band&#x27;s bassist, and he played on studio albums from &quot;Emergency on Planet Earth&quot; (1993) to &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot; (1996). From there, Zender was asked to become an official Warwick basses endorser. He received a number of unique customised Streamer models.

Zender left Jamiroquai in 1998 during the recording of their fourth album, &quot;Synkronized&quot;, primarily because of conflicts with the band leader Jay Kay. A spokesperson for the band said that Zender also expressed his desire to spend more time with his new wife Melanie Blatt and their new baby. 

===1998–present===
After Jamiroquai, Zender had his own project with the British soul artist Don-E called AZUR, which signed a record deal with d&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s label. However, the project was shelved and was then available on the Internet for a short time. He has also played bass guitar with other artists, including All Saints, Omar, Lauryn Hill, D&#x27;Angelo, Gorillaz, Samuel Purdey, Ms. Dynamite and Stevie Wonder.

In summer 2006, Zender became the musical director and bass guitar player for Mark Ronson. The release of the album &quot;Version&quot; in 2007 proved to be a larger success than first expected. He has played bass guitar for Ronson at events such as BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend, Wireless Festival, Global Gathering, and Glastonbury, and festivals all over Europe, including Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland and North Sea Jazz Festival in Rotterdam. They were also special guests on Jay-Z&#x27;s UK tour.

Having left the Mark Ronson band in 2011, Zender started his own record label, White Buffalo Recordings, and formerly ran the music publishing company Made Youth Inc.

Some of Zender&#x27;s most recent work was with the band Leroi. Zender explained they were signed to Geffen Records in Los Angeles but that the deal fell through after the heads of the company, Polly Anthony and Jordan Shurr, who signed them, were made redundant.

In March 2023, Zender released the song &quot;Happy Feelings&quot;, featuring Omar and Ana Tijoux, on all major streaming platforms.

In November 2024, Zender released the song &quot;Run&quot; (originally recorded in 2000) on all major streaming platforms under the alias LeRoi74.

==Artistry==
Zender has cited players such as Nathaniel Phillips, Stanley Clarke, Alphonso Johnson, Chuck Rainey, Larry Graham, Bootsy Collins, Verdine White, James Jamerson, Bernard Edwards, Paul Jackson, Hellmut Hattler as his influences.

==Personal Life==
Zender and All Saints singer Melanie Blatt got married in 1998; the couple divorced in early 2006. They have one daughter, named Lilyella, born 20 November 1998.

<text>Cléopâtre-Diane de Mérode (27 September 1875 – 17 October 1966) was a French dancer of the Belle Époque. She has been referred to as the &quot;first real celebrity icon&quot; and the &quot;first modern celebrity&quot;. She was also the first woman whose photographic image, due in particular to photographers Nadar and Léopold-Émile Reutlinger, was distributed worldwide.

==Biography==
Cléo de Mérode was born in Paris, France on 27 September 1875 at 7:00 P.M. She was the illegitimate daughter of Viennese Baroness Vincentia Maria Cäcilia Catharina de Mérode (1850–1899). Vincentia was estranged from Cléo&#x27;s father, who was the Austrian judge, lawyer, and pioneer of tourism Theodor Christomannos. Through Christomannos&#x27; marriage to Aloysia Wellzensohn, she had three half-siblings. Cléo met her father as a young adult at a train station in Merano, and upon seeing him jokingly exclaimed, &quot;I really hope that you are wealthy, because I am used to luxury and the good life.&quot; Upon Christomannos&#x27; death in 1911, de Mérode left an inscription on his grave in German which reads, &quot;The man who wanted everything for others and nothing for himself&quot;. She was raised Catholic and affectionately called &quot;Lulu&quot; by her family. At the age of eight, she was sent to study dance with the Sisters of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, and she made her professional debut at the Paris Opéra at age eleven. According to a 1964 interview with Cecil Beaton, she became a dancer because she was fond of music.

De Mérode became renowned for her glamour even more than for her dancing skills, and her image began appearing on such things as postcards and playing cards. At 16, she debuted her signature hairstyle, a chignon, which became the talk of Parisian women and was quickly adopted as a popular style for all. In Sweden, the hairstyle nearly instigated a strike against female workers when they were ordered to cease wearing the chignon to work. The hairstyle persisted in popularity for decades; as late as 1941, American newspapers called it the &quot;Cléo de Mérode hairdo&quot;. At the same time, the hairstyle, which covered her ears, caused rumors to circulate that de Mérode was missing one of or both of her ears. She responded to the rumors by going out in public the following day with her ears exposed. de Mérode later said of the trendsetting hairstyle, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t thought out at all; it just happened. As a child I wore a square fringe. This would fall in my eyes when I was a coryphée at the Opéra ballet, and I kept pushing it back from the center; gradually the hair grew and, in order to keep it from falling forward, I knotted it in a bun. When big hats came in it was difficult to fix them on without padding, but I invented a little hidden crown.&quot; In 1895, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec did her portrait, as would Charles Puyo, Alfredo Müller, Edgar Degas, Manuel Benedito, Georges Clairin, Friedrich August von Kaulbach (who painted her twice), József Rippl-Rónai, François Flameng, Carlos Vázquez Úbeda, Einar Nerman, Paul-Eugène Mesplès, Henri Gervex, and Giovanni Boldini. She was sculpted by the likes of Alexandre Falguière (who sculpted her twice), Mariano Benlliure, Alphonse Mucha, Ernst Seger, and Eugène-Denis Arrondelle. A sculpture of her done by an anonymous artist can be found at the Galerie Tourbillon, and a wax mask of her by Georges Despret is preserved at the Musée Fin-de-Siècle Museum in Brussels. Georges Goursat also drew several caricatures of de Mérode during the 1900s. Her picture was taken by some of the most illustrious photographers of the day, including Nadar and his son and successor Paul Nadar, Léopold-Émile Reutlinger and his son Jean Reutlinger, Charles Ogerau, Henri Manuel, and Otto Sarony.

In the fall of 1895, a rumor began that de Mérode was King Leopold II&#x27;s latest mistress, and the two were dubbed &quot;Cléopold&quot; by the media. Because the King had had two children with a woman reputed to be a prostitute, de Mérode&#x27;s reputation suffered, and she was labeled a &quot;courtesan&quot; or &quot;demimondaine&quot;, both of which she is still referred to as today. In an attempt to settle the rumors, de Mérode&#x27;s mother wrote a letter to the editor of &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, which was published and then subsequently mocked due to poor spelling. Two years later her mother said in an interview, &quot;It is false, absolutely false. His majesty has no idea of doing such a ridiculous thing. When Lulu was dancing at the Grand Opera - where, you know, she must report every night, because she is not a premiere at all, and has no favors granted her which other members of the corps do not also receive - it happened that one night His Majesty the King of the Belgians and his suite were at the opera. The royal party sat very near the stage in one of the avant scenes. His Majesty the King sent to my daughter a flattering message, telling how much pleasure she had given him, and asked if he might beg the favor of meeting her. My daughter met the King, but never in her life except in my presence.&quot; In the same interview, de Mérode added, &quot;It is horrible that they should so pursue me with such monstrous lies! The King of the Belgians is no more to me than any other great man who has admired me on the stage, whom I have seen for a few moments off the stage very rarely, and always in the presence of many other persons. His Majesty sent me gifts. I have no hesitation in saying that I accepted them, but that is permissible for an artist in France. I have never accepted any attentions from the King of Belgium, and he has never received a favor from me which I could not accord to any gentleman under the circumstances. I have never been alone with him.&quot; However, the French agent Xavier Paoli recorded in his 1911 book &quot;Their Majesties as I Knew Them&quot; that the King claimed that he had never met nor seen de Mérode perform and was unsure of how the rumors began. When he finally met de Mérode after the rumors were already rife, he apologized to her: &quot;Allow me to express my regrets,&quot; he told her, &quot;if the good fortune people attribute to me has offended you at all. Alas, we no longer live in an age when a king&#x27;s favor was not looked upon as compromising! Besides, I am only a little king.&quot; de Mérode wrote in her autobiography of the rumor, &quot;I was completely bewildered by the dimensions that this story took on. The tale of my liaison with Léopold sped along, across France, throughout Europe, and around the world. Caricatures, gossip columns, songs, skits, showed the king and me, snuggling, sharing a restaurant table, cracking open champagne at Maxim&#x27;s, on a cruise, in a Pullman, and so on...I did not know what to make of such inordinate publicity; it stunned me.&quot; According to Georg Stefan Troller, who interviewed her, Leopold II had promised her the Belgian Congo if she married him. Michael Garval, de Mérode&#x27;s biographer, claims that the rumors began after the King accosted de Mérode in the Foyer de la Danse at the Paris Opéra, and that the King may have staged the affair to conceal his actual relations with Émilienne d&#x27;Alençon. Garval has also said that although de Mérode posed as a courtesan to increase her fame, she never worked as one. 
In the spring of 1896, a second scandal erupted due to the exhibition of the sculpture &quot;La Danseuse&quot; by Alexandre Falguière at the Salon des Artistes Française. The sculpture was a life-size nude in white marble that was carved from a plaster cast of de Mérode&#x27;s body. Despite the grain of skin visible on the plaster, proving a live cast, de Mérode accused Falguière of having fabricated a scandalous work by molding the body of the statue on another female model, whereas she posed only for the head. The scandal followed her throughout her career; almost a decade later, in 1904, &quot;The Sketch&quot; wrote, &quot;Cléo de Mérode is, of course, well known because of her beauty and the Falguière statue, and not on account of her quality as dancer, which is not remarkable.&quot; Although de Mérode vehemently denied posing for the sculpture, she later incorporated the work into a stage production in which she starred. The sculpture can be seen at the Musée d&#x27;Orsay.

In the summer of 1896, de Mérode appeared in a simulated nude scene in the title role of &quot;Phryné&quot;, a three act ballet-pantomime staged at the Casino Municipal in the seaside resort of Royan. She later recalled, &quot;I appeared before the jury enveloped in a dark grey-blue drapery. I danced in this costume and my gestures made the long folds of fabric undulate in a pretty manner. Underneath I wore a pale rose maillot, covered with a light rose gauze tunic, which hugged my form. When the moment came to seduce the judges, a follower, with one gesture, raised the immense cape and spread it behind me to its full extent. Against this rather dark ground, I was a pink silhouette, and from a distance, with a certain suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience, the flesh-colored feminine form gave the illusion of a nude body.&quot; That year she was also elected “Beauty Queen” by 3,000 out of 7,000 votes by readers of &quot;L&#x27;Illustration&quot;. She garnered almost 1,000 votes more than other celebrated names, including Sarah Bernhardt and Gabrielle Réjane.

Despite the two scandals, de Mérode became an international star, performing across Europe and in the United States. In Germany, she danced at Hamburg&#x27;s Hansa-Theater and Berlin&#x27;s Wintergarten, and in France she appeared in the plays &quot;Les Deux Pigeons&quot;, &quot;La Korrigane&quot;, and &quot;Étoile&quot;, and Gustave Charpentier engaged her for the role of La Beauté in &quot;Le Couronnement de la Muse&quot;. In 1897, she arrived in New York City, where she appeared for a month at Koster and Bial&#x27;s in the play &quot;Faust&quot;. During her stay in New York, she was besieged by reporters and followed down the street by girls begging for her autograph. de Mérode&#x27;s performance was heavily anticipated, but was disappointing, and though the press praised her beauty, they said she could not dance; &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot; said of her, &quot;Cléo de Mérode can go back to her inconspicuous position among the ballet dancers at the Paris Opéra, crowned with the distinction of having made the most successful failure of the season. Critics and public joined in a chorus of disappointment after her first appearance at Koster &amp; Bial&#x27;s, and yet she has set a new fashion in personal adornment, crowds mark her progress on the street, and large audiences assemble to see her.&quot; de Mérode responded to the criticism by saying, &quot;The papers stated that I was a failure, but they lied. I pleased the Americans vastly. The papers pretended that I danced badly, as if Americans could tell. They know nothing about dancing and don&#x27;t like ballets.&quot; In a separate interview she stated, &quot;I dance the ancient dances, the Louis XIII, the Louis XV, the gavot, the pavan, the minuet, and I led at Royan Louis Ganne&#x27;s ballet of Phryne. I am gowned by a real dressmaker. I know music very well and play the piano as little as possible. I know how to arrange a basket of fruit, place flowers in a jardiniere, and touch a book without spoiling it. I have read the poets and the historians, and I do not write. I wear stockings that are as fine as a woven mist. What other accomplishments shall I speak of?&quot; Although she criticized American culture, she celebrated American women, noting, &quot;It would be outrageous not to admire the women of America. They are not like us. It is too bad for them that they are not French, but that cannot be helped. They know much more than we do and have ambitions in many directions that we in our country never feel. I think as a whole they are prettier than we are. I do not wonder that the men from Europe fall in love with the American girls. They are so chic and charming, you know. I have heard so many stories of them that at first, I did not know what to think, and when I walked about on the great steamer that brought me here, I looked at your countrywomen very curiously. The more I looked the better I liked them. Perhaps it was because they seemed to like me, but that does not matter. My opinion of them is all that I could wish and that is saying a great deal, for I wish to speak and think everything kindly of the women of America.&quot; Despite the letdown, de Mérode made over forty times her regular monthly Parisian salary, which drew criticism, resulting in de Mérode being dismissed as an &quot;article de Paris&quot; – alluring, but worthless.

In 1898, de Mérode was awarded first prize at an exhibit of the New York Camera Club as being the most beautiful woman in Paris. In 1900, she caused a sensation at the Exposition Universelle when she performed traditional Javanese and Khmer dances. She also appeared in two films, one of which was hand-tinted in color; both showed her dancing. In 1901, Édouard Marchand organized for her to dance at the Folies Bergère in a three-act pantomime titled &quot;Lorenza&quot;, taking the risk to do something other elites of the ballet had never done before. Her performance gained her a new following, and her popularity further increased. In 1902, de Mérode performed at the Alhambra in London, where her performance was not well received. In contrast, she was popular in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, visiting there in 1903 and 1904. In Stockholm, crowds in the street would prevent her from returning to her hotel. Upon returning to Paris, de Mérode turned over 3,000 love letters from her German and Scandinavian admirers to the editor of &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, many of which were subsequently printed. In 1904, she reprised her role as Phryne at the Olympia. That same year, she performed alongside dancer Paul Franck in &quot;Tanagra&quot;, a dance in Ancient Greek style. During her stay in Munich from 1903 to 1904, she was the model for the painters Friedrich August von Kaulbach and Franz von Lenbach. In 1906, it was reported that 50,000,000 photographs of de Mérode had been sold and that a single Berlin firm produced 4,000,000 a year. The following year, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Magazine&quot; compared her to the Virgin Mary. Jean Cocteau called her the &quot;Belle of the beautiful ones&quot; and wrote of her, &quot;She is the beauty of beauty, the virgin who is not, the Pre-Raphaelite lady who walks with downcast eyes through groups [...] The profile of Cléo is so graceful, so divine that the cartoonists break it.&quot;

In 1908 she danced for the German Emperor Wilhelm II, and portrayed Phoébe in &quot;Endymion et Phoébe&quot; at the Opéra-Comique alongside Régina Badet. In 1912, de Mérode appeared in the opera &quot;La Danseuse de Pompeii&quot; as part of the corps de ballet at the Opéra-Comique. The following year in late June, she appeared in the revue &quot;Come Over Here&quot; at the London Opera House. During World War I, she entertained wounded soldiers. After the war ended, she toured in the French provinces with Serge Peretti, reluctant to accept engagements abroad. She continued to dance until her late forties; Rupert Doone&#x27;s partnering of de Mérode in a 1924 social dance recital reportedly inspired Frederick Ashton to pursue a career in dance. Throughout the early 1920s, de Mérode performed at galas and benefit concerts, the earliest being a fundraiser for Benoît-Constant Coquelin old actors&#x27; home in Couilly-Pont-aux-Dames. de Mérode retired in 1924 to the seaside resort of Biarritz in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques département of France. She also spent time at the Château de Rastignac with the Lauwick family. At the request of theater director Henri Varna, she reappeared on stage at the Alcazar on 15 June 1934 in &quot;Viens poupoule&quot; alongside the dancer George Skibine and the actress and singer Cassive. She did four routines: one in a Norman peasant costume, the traditional Khmer dance she had first performed at the Exposition Universelle in 1900, a Second Empire scene, and &quot;la Valse 1900&quot;. de Mérode later reflected, “I was wearing a pink satin dress, boned at the waist, very long, with a ruching at the bottom. We danced five waltzes in a row; we ended with a big whirlwind, and Skibine carried me in his arms to the back of the stage.” She then taught ballet before retiring in 1965 at 90 years old. As a hobby, she crafted figurines of dancers, shepherds, and shepherdesses in the classical style which she then sold.

In 1923, de Mérode unsuccessfully sued the owners of the film Peacock Alley (1922) for 100,000 francs in damages, alleging that the film injured her reputation by burlesquing incidents in her career.

In 1950, de Mérode sued Simone de Beauvoir for libel, claiming five million francs in damages. de Beauvoir had &quot;wrongly described her as a prostitute who came from peasant stock and had taken an aristocratic sounding stage name as self promotion&quot; in her book &quot;The Second Sex&quot;. de Mérode won the lawsuit, and the passage was taken out of the book. However, de Mérode only received one franc in damages because &quot;the judge found that Cléo had permitted the rumors during the course of her career for their publicity value&quot;.

In 1955, she published her autobiography, &quot;Le Ballet de ma vie&quot; (&quot;The Dance of My Life&quot;).

In 1964, de Mérode was photographed by Cecil Beaton and featured in the 15 February 1964 issue of &quot;Vogue.

de Mérode never married or had children, which has led some biographers to categorize her as a lesbian. Paul Klee, who personally knew de Mérode, called her &quot;probably the most beautiful woman alive&quot; and said she &quot;seemed asexual&quot; in a 1902 diary entry. The French novelist Félicien Champsaur reportedly became obsessed with de Mérode and proposed marriage to her multiple times. In her autobiography &quot;La ballet de ma vie&quot;, de Mérode claimed that she had only been involved with two men in her life. She was engaged to a French aristocrat for nearly ten years before he died of Typhoid fever in 1904, and she was the companion of the Spanish sculptor and diplomat Luis de Périnat, Marquis de Périnat from 1906 to 1919. He left her for Spanish Baroness Ana Maria Elío y Gaztelu, with whom he had a son. In an 1897 interview, de Mérode spoke of her engagement to her French aristocrat fiancé, saying, &quot;I am going to get married. First, because the man seems good to me, and also because, you know, in France a woman is never independent until she is married. You see, I have my mother with me wherever I go. What would they think of me if I went about without a chaperone? Impossible. Do you think Monsieur whom I shall marry would be happy if he thought I were over here in this great country with no one but my little self to keep away the people that always follow me? No, no, no.&quot; In the same interview, she proclaimed that her greatest love was dance, remarking, &quot;My soul is in my feet sometimes I think. I know the dance, I know the figure, but some way I forget it all and leave it to my feet. They know. They never make mistakes. How long shall I dance? As long as I live and can move about. I do not wish to be thought one of those women who will ever confess that they are passe. I never shall be, never.&quot; de Mérode was close friends with the musician Reynaldo Hahn, who she met when she was seventeen. She lived with her mother in an apartment in Paris until her mother&#x27;s death in 1899.

She was a vegetarian.

Suffering from dementia, de Mérode died on 17 October 1966 in her Paris apartment at 15 Rue de Téhéran, and was interred at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Division 90. A statue of her by Luis de Périnat, mourning her mother, who is interred in the same plot, decorates the gravestone.

==In popular culture==
In 1896, de Mérode was featured in The American Tobacco Company&#x27;s Sweet Caporal brand pinback series of celebrated actresses. More de Mérode-themed items followed, including a nightgown, artificial flowers, cigars, and underwear; the latter two sold for decades.

The 1897 French operetta &quot;Les Fêtards&quot; parodied de Mérode and King Leopold II&#x27;s rumored affair, with their names being changed to Théa and Ernest III. The musical comedy &quot;The Rounders&quot;, on Broadway and on tour nationwide from 1899 to 1900, was based on &quot;Les Fêtards&quot;, and the character of Théa was portrayed by Phyllis Rankin.

In December 1897, Koster and Bial&#x27;s traveling company presented &quot;The Big Burlesque Extravaganza &#x27;Gayest Manhattan&#x27;&quot; at the Taylor Opera House in Trenton, New Jersey, which featured Gertie Reynolds as &quot;The American Cléo de Mérode&quot;.

In May 1900, the John P. Dousman Milling Co. of De Pere released a blotter calendar with de Mérode&#x27;s photograph on it. The following year, Gimbels and Palais Royal released a line of Cléo de Mérode dolls, complete with clothing and accessories.

Liane de Pougy&#x27;s 1904 novel &quot;Les Sensations de Mlle de la Bringue&quot; places de Mérode and King Leopold II at a sabbath; she refers to de Mérode as &quot;Méo de la Clef&quot;, who &quot;personified love without making it&quot; and calls King Leopold II &quot;a grand old man with a white beard, her devoted eunuch&quot;.

In 1918, she was played by Dorothy Newall in the musical revue &quot;Hitchy-Koo&quot;. The following year, a comic character named after de Mérode appeared in the operetta &quot;Sì&quot;. In 1921 she appeared as a romance novel heroine in Karl Reissmann&#x27;s novel &quot;A Dancer&#x27;s Dream of Joy&quot;. She is mentioned in Henry William Fischer&#x27;s 1922 book &quot;Abroad with Mark Twain and Eugene Field&quot;.

The character &quot;Cleo of Paris&quot;, played by Mae Murray in the 1922 American silent film &quot;Peacock Alley&quot;, was a parody of de Mérode. She was portrayed by Fern Andra in the lost German silent film &quot;Women of Passion&quot; (1926). Upon learning of the film and its portrayal of her as a courtesan, she protested in an open letter in the theatrical daily &quot;Comœdia&quot;, saying, &quot;I lead and have always led the quietest of lives, I do not seek any publicity, and I really do not wish to be given any against my will, especially that sort of publicity.&quot; The character Lea de Castro (played by Saffron Burrows) in the Austrian art-house film &quot;Klimt&quot; (2006) is based on de Mérode. The film focuses on an imaginary romance between the artist Gustav Klimt and Lea de Castro, a Parisian dancer. The character was supposed to be named after de Mérode, but was changed to Lea de Castro – a riff on Laetitia Casta, who was originally supposed to portray her, and Cléo de Mérode. In reality, de Mérode and Klimt never met or had an affair, and de Mérode was not one of his art subjects or muses.

In 1940, artist and filmmaker Joseph Cornell constructed a glass-fronted shadow box dedicated to de Mérode called, &quot;L’Egypte de Mlle. Cléo de Mérode&quot;. In 2011, Charles Simic published a poem about the box and de Mérode, which read, &quot;Doll&#x27;s forearm, loose red sand, wood ball, German coin, several glass and mirror fragments, 12 corkstopped bottles, cutout sphinx [&quot;sic&quot;] head, yellow filaments, 2 intertwined paper spirals, cut out of Cléo de Mérode&#x27;s head, cutout of camels and men, loose yellow sand, 6 pearl beads, glass tube with residue of dried green liquid, crumpled tulle, rhinestones, pearl beads, sequins, metal chain, metal and glass fragments, threaded needle, red wood disc, bone and frosted glass fragments, blue celluloid, clear glass crystals, rock specimen, 7 balls, plastic rose petals, three miniature tin spoons for a dollhouse.&quot;

In the last decade, there has been a resurgence of interest in de Mérode. In 2011, Silvano Faggioni published a biography about de Mérode&#x27;s father titled &quot;Theodor Christomannos: Brilliant pioneer of tourism in the Dolomites&quot;. In the book, Faggioni describes de Mérode and her father first meeting and her relationship with him as an adult; it is the first time de Mérode&#x27;s father&#x27;s identity was made public. The following year, Michael D. Garval published the book &quot;Cléo de Mérode and the Rise of Modern Celebrity Culture&quot;, which explores the legacy of de Mérode and studies the neglected prehistory of a visual culture populated by, and obsessed with, celebrities. In 2016, Aaron Jaffe and Jonathan Goldman reaffirmed this in their book &quot;Modernist Star Maps: Celebrity, Modernity, Culture&quot;. The following year, de Mérode was briefly mentioned in Edward Ross Dickinson&#x27;s book &quot;Dancing in the Blood: Modern Dance and European Culture on the Eve of the First World War&quot;, which is about the impact of modern dance on European cultural life in the early twentieth century. In November 2019, &quot;Vogue Spain&quot; published an article about de Mérode&#x27;s contribution to the celebrity phenomenon. In 2020, Greg Jenner published the book &quot;Dead Famous: An Unexpected History of Celebrity from Bronze Age to Silver Screen&quot;, which is about how instrumental modernity’s earlier technologies were in propelling celebrity culture, such as daily newspapers, and how the celebrity phenomenon has changed and stayed the same. The book briefly talks about de Mérode and her rise to fame. In January 2021, &quot;Alto Adige&quot; published an article about de Mérode&#x27;s father Theodor Christomannos and touches on her relationship with him. In April 2021, &quot;Vanity Fair France&quot; wrote an article about de Mérode and King Leopold II&#x27;s rumored affair.

<text>The Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera is a mid-size car manufactured and marketed for model years 1982–1996 by the Oldsmobile Division of General Motors — over a single generation. Body styles included a 2-door coupe, 4-door sedan, and the 4-door wagon.

The Cutlass Ciera shared the front-wheel drive A platform with the Buick Century, Pontiac 6000 and Chevrolet Celebrity.

==Background==
The Cutlass Ciera and its A-Body platform twins, featured MacPherson strut front suspension, body-color urethane bumpers, flush-mounted glass, front-wheel drive, and on many models, fuel injection.

The Cutlass Ciera shared the Cutlass nameplate with the smaller Cutlass Calais and the upscale Cutlass Supreme. Oldsmobile had previously used the Celebrity brand in the 1960s, but GM chose to give that name to Chevrolet. With the Ciera, Oldsmobile established Cutlass as sub-brand for its line of mainstream sedans and coupes.

Initially, the Cutlass Ciera and its platform mates were marketed as premium mid-sized cars, above the X-Body, from which they were derived, and the N-Body Calais, which would follow for 1985.

The Ciera and Cruiser replaced the rear-wheel drive G-Body Cutlass models, but strong sales kept the higher trim Cutlass Supreme in production until the 1988 model year when it was replaced by the W-Body models. As such, these front-wheel drive sedans carried the A-Body designation, previously reserved for their rear-wheel drive showroom companions. In order to keep both lines in production, General Motors rechristened the rear-wheel drive mid-sized platform as the G-Body beginning with the 1982 model year.

When the W-Body coupes were introduced for 1988, Oldsmobile reduced the number of options and configurations available. During the model years that followed, luxury and performance options such as FE3 suspension, auto calculator, bucket seats, leather seating areas, sunroofs, and full instrumentation were gradually eliminated.

Originally for 1990, the Cutlass Ciera, as with the rest of the A-body range, was intended to be phased out in favor of the more modern W-body midsized sedans. However, the Ciera, as well as its sister the Buick Century, continued to remain popular nearing the end of their initial runs. Thus, it was decided that the older Cutlass Ciera and Century would instead continue production alongside their proposed replacements, the Cutlass Supreme and Regal respectively, as lower priced alternatives.

After 1990, special editions of the Cutlass Ciera were dropped from the American market and by the end of 1991, the coupe was discontinued. Although reduced to two trim levels and two body styles, sedan and wagon, the Cieras remained the brand&#x27;s best-selling line for 1996.

==1982–1988==

Production began September 28, 1981, at Doraville Assembly in Georgia for the 1982 model year. In 1984, the Cutlass Cruiser station wagon model moved to the Cutlass Ciera&#x27;s platform; previously, the nameplate used the rear wheel drive G-body. The Cutlass Ciera came in three trim levels: the base, LS, and Brougham.

The standard engine was a 2.5 L four-cylinder Tech IV (Pontiac Iron Duke) engine. All models also included standard bench seats and cloth interior. Available on all models were a 3.0 L Buick V6 engine, or a 4.3 L Oldsmobile Diesel V6 engine. Brougham trim added a plush interior with vinyl accents, leatherette interior door pulls, additional chrome trim, and a reading lamp. The base coupe and sedan were initially dropped after 1982 due to poor sales, leaving LS and Brougham trim as the only available from 1983 until 1985, excluding special editions. During the model year, production ended at the Fremont GM Assembly Plant when that facility closed.

The 1983 model year added a new ES trim package for the coupe and sedan models. This would be the last year for the standard 13-inch wheels. During the spring of 1983, a special edition Holiday Coupe was added to the option list as part of the Oldsmobile Road Show sales promotion.

For 1984, the line added a new Cruiser wagon, replacing the former G-Body Cutlass Cruiser. A 3.8 L Buick V6 became available and the Holiday Coupe package returned to the options list for its first full year as did a 4-speed manual transmission for diesel models. This transmission was dropped in the fall of 1983 from the option list. A 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive was first available for 1984, optional with the 3.0L V6 and 4.3L diesel V6, and standard with the 3.8L V6.

For 1985, the Cutlass Ciera received its first facelift with a revised grille, headlamps, taillights, and interiors. The GT coupe was added as a companion to the ES sedan. In spring 1985 the Oldsmobile designed 4.3 L diesel was dropped due to poor sales. Canadian models added the 2.8 L 2bbl V6 this year.

For 1986, the Cutlass Ciera&#x27;s grille had expanded ventilation sections than the similar 1985 model. The coupe received a revised roofline that was not initially shared with the other GM A-body models, but later migrated to the Buick Century coupe. These models are identifiable by their revised roofline and updated VIN identification, which replaced the &quot;27&quot; coupe designation used from 1982 until March 1986 with &quot;37&quot;. 1986 also saw the addition of the 2.8 L V6 in place of the previously offered Buick 3.0 L V6 in the American market. The 2.8 L engine had previously been offered in Canadian Ciera&#x27;s with the 2-barrel carburetor. In compliance with safety regulations, the 1986 Ciera was the first to have a high mount brake light as standard equipment. The Cutlass Ciera nameplate appeared on the rear fiberglass panel, just below the trunk lid.

For 1987, the Cutlass Ciera was facelifted again with a new grille, an updated steering wheel had the Oldsmobile logo moved from the right to the very center, and the 2.8 L &quot;LE2&quot; V6 engine was dropped in favor of the more powerful LB6 unit. In addition, Brougham and GT models received composite headlamps as standard equipment. The 2.5 L Iron Duke 4 cylinder received minor updates, including a serpentine belt, which replaced the previous engine belt set up, for a boost of 6 horsepower, to 98. Ciera&#x27;s tail lamps were slightly revised, adding ribs to their lower quarter.
For 1988, the base Cutlass Ciera received composite headlamps, the new &quot;International Series&quot; models were introduced, and this would be the last year for the &quot;Brougham&quot;, which was rechristened the Brougham SL on coupe models. The &quot;International Series&quot; included the emblem with the flags of various countries in a circular pattern on the front header panel and b pillars with the name &quot;International Series&quot; written across a black and chrome globe in the center. The International Series was available in coupe and sedan body styles. This model came equipped with a standard Buick 3.8 L V6 engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, sporty exhaust system, front bucket seats, and power windows. Composite headlamps were made standard on all Cutlass Ciera models. Sedan models could have the new power sliding sunroof for the first time.

==1989–1996==
The Cutlass Ciera was updated for 1989, with the sedan receiving a roofline similar to the coupe, revised body side moldings, deletion of hood ornaments and addition of rear seat shoulder belts. Both coupe and sedan models received updated rear-end treatments. The older Buick 3.8 L V6 was dropped in favor of GM&#x27;s new 3300 V6 engine. The Brougham trim level was discontinued and replaced by an upper-level SL version. The XC trim level became optional on the station wagon.

For 1990, the front seat belts were moved from the B-pillars to the doors. This would also be the last year for the &#x27;International Series&#x27; and &#x27;XC&#x27;.

The 1991 Cutlass Ciera was given a new taillight treatment with body-colored frames to divide the lenses into three horizontal slots at the expense of the Oldsmobile rocket insignias. Interior changes for 1991 included a new instrument cluster with a trip odometer and an engine temperature gauge. Six-speaker sound systems were added as were a remote lock fob and improved body acoustics. This would be the last year for the coupe in the United States and Canada, but it would continue on in the Mexican market.

For 1992, the coupe was dropped, and the line-up included only sedans and station wagons in &#x27;S&#x27; or &#x27;SL&#x27; designations. The wagon now competed internally with the Oldsmobile Silhouette minivan (based on the Cutlass Supreme&#x27;s W-platform), offering buyers a choice of wagon or a minivan. The Ciera remained Oldsmobile&#x27;s best-selling model line, with over 132,000 sedans and an additional 7,793 station wagons produced this year.

For 1993, the 2.5 L Tech IV engine was replaced by the 2.2 L &quot;2200&quot; OHV engine with a 3-speed automatic transmission.

In 1994, the &#x27;SL&#x27; designation was dropped. The &#x27;Cutlass Ciera S&#x27;, available in sedan or station wagon form, featured a driver airbag as standard equipment, along with anti-lock brakes, adjustable steering column, electric rear-window defogger, automatic door locks, and delay wipers. The 3.1 L, Chevrolet V6 engine with a 4-speed automatic transmission replaced the prior year&#x27;s 3300 Buick V6. This engine was standard on the Cruiser wagon and optional on the sedan. The 2200 I-4 received minor updates, resulting in a 10-horsepower increase.

For 1995, the &#x27;SL&#x27; designation returned in place of the &#x27;S&#x27;. The 1995 Cutlass Ciera SL featured a new shift interlock system that required stepping on the brake pedal before moving the gear shift out of the park position.

For 1996, the final model year, the &#x27;Cutlass&#x27; nomenclature was dropped and the car was now known simply as the &#x27;Ciera SL&#x27;, which continued to be available in &#x27;Series I&#x27; or &#x27;Series II&#x27; equipment levels. The chrome &quot;Oldsmobile&quot; badge above the driver&#x27;s headlight was deleted. As Oldsmobile attempted to reposition itself as a European-styled upscale make with new products such as the Aurora, the Cutlass Ciera continued to have strong sales. Because the tooling for the A-body platform had long since been monetized, GM was guaranteed a profit off each Cutlass Ciera and Buick Century sold. At the same time, GM was losing money on its other midsized platform, the W-platform. Production of the Ciera ended on August 30, 1996. It was replaced in the U.S. by the N-body 1997 Oldsmobile Cutlass, also built at the Oklahoma City assembly plant. As a result, the 1996 Cruiser wagon was the final Oldsmobile station wagon model produced. Sales of this Cutlass peaked at 53,438 in 1998 and it was discontinued in 1999.

==Special editions==
Factory specialty models of the Cutlass Ciera included the Holiday Coupe, GT, ES, XC, and International Series models – the latter had a stock body kit.

Holiday Coupe - From 1984 to March 1986, Oldsmobile offered a special edition Holiday Coupe package, option WJ5, on the Brougham coupe. This package included a unique landau vinyl roof (RPO C10), opera windows, special rooftop trim, and painted pinstripes. The Holiday Coupe package required tinted glass and could not be ordered with standard pinstripes. It was discontinued partway through the 1986 model year when Oldsmobile introduced the updated coupe roofline. All Holiday coupes were converted by the American Sunroof Company (ASC) outside of the factory. Oldsmobile would ship ASC Brougham coupes equipped with tinted glass to modify at their facility. These models have an ASC decal in the driver&#x27;s side door frame indicating the factory authorized conversion.

ES - The ES (RPO W48) sedan was available from 1983 through 1985 model years. These vehicles feature unique wheel covers, blacked-out trim, F41 performance suspension, black sidewall tires, a center console with bucket seats, and a sports steering wheel. For 1985 only the ES sedan returned, as the coupe had been renamed GT.

GT - The GT (RPO W45) was first offered as an option on the 1985 Ciera coupe. It featured blacked-out trim, V6 engine, a center console with bucket seats, fog lamps factory body kit, alloy wheels, and performance suspension. For 1986, it was expanded to the four-door sedan, replacing the ES. Following the 1987 model year, it was replaced by the International Series.

International Series - From 1988 through 1990 model years, the International Series (RPO W45/W49) was the top performance trim available on the Ciera. It featured the 3.8 L V6 for 1988 and the 3.3 L V6 for 1989 and 1990. Available on coupe and sedan models, it featured a factory body kit, bucket seats with console, FE3 performance suspension, alloy wheels, full instrumentation, air conditioning, JA2 heavy-duty brakes, extra capacity cooling, and unique ornamentation.

XC - The XC was introduced as part of Oldsmobile&#x27;s 90th Anniversary celebrations (XC being Roman Numeral for 90) and remained on the option sheet from 1988 until 1990. It was available on coupe and sedan models. Sharing much of its sporty appearance with the International Series, the XC is distinguished by orange body side stripes in place of the typical black and chrome trim. Unlike the similar-looking International Series, the XC package did not include a standard V6, 4-speed automatic, or other higher-end features. These had to be ordered in addition to the XC package.

==Convertible==

Oldsmobile never officially produced a factory-built convertible of the Cutlass Ciera for public sale, but many dealers made them available via aftermarket conversions. Between 1983 and 1986, 814 Cutlass Ciera convertibles were made by Hess &amp; Eisenhardt/Car Craft. These vehicles were Brougham (1983 to mid-1986) and SL (mid-1986) coupes, modified with leather interior and chassis reinforcement to provide the needed structural rigidity that was lost by removing the roof.

==International sales==
Throughout much of its history, the Cutlass Ciera was offered in several global markets. In Mexico, local production allowed for unique models under the name Cutlass (by General Motors). Many people were confused by this since it was invoiced as a Chevrolet and they were sold through Mexican Chevrolet dealers, but these models never wore Chevrolet badges. They were available as Cutlass and Cutlass Eurosport (similar to the American International Series) with more sporty orientation. Early models were produced with the 2.8 L MPFI V6, and later variants from 1992 got it replaced by a 3.1 L. In 1993, the Cutlass Eurosport received a redesign. The Mexican Cutlass was available in sedan and coupé until their discontinuation in 1996. The Cutlass was only available with a 3 speed automatic transmission and the Cutlass Eurosport was available with both the 5-speed manual transmission and the 3-speed automatic.

==Awards==
The Cutlass Ciera consistently ranked among the highest-rated vehicles by J.D. Power and Associates; it was ranked the &quot;Best in Price Class&quot; on July 30, 1992, and the &quot;Top-Ranked American-Made Car&quot; on May 28, 1992. It was also named &quot;Safe Car of the Year&quot; by &quot;Prevention Magazine&quot; on March 6, 1992.

<text>The Oldsmobile Calais is a compact car that was manufactured and marketed by Oldsmobile from 1985 through 1991, superseding the Oldsmobile Omega and named after the city of Calais, France. Renamed the Cutlass Calais for 1988, the Calais shared the GM N platform with the Pontiac Grand Am and the Buick Skylark/Buick Somerset—and was superseded by the Oldsmobile Achieva in 1992. Previously, the Cutlass Calais nameplate was used on top-line versions of the Cutlass Supreme coupé (differing from the Supreme only in minor trim details) from 1978 to 1984. There was also a Cadillac Calais model, sold from 1965 to 1976.

== Models ==
The Calais was initially offered in an unnamed base and Supreme models. For 1986, four-door models were added across the lineup, and GT and the ES models were introduced. Distinguishing features of these two sportier models included composite headlamps (replacing quad sealed beam units), FE3 sport tuned suspension and various body cladding. In 1987, the ES was dropped and the lineup consisted of the base, Supreme and GT. Composite headlamps were on all models, and passive restraints were added to all models. The standard powerplant was the Tech-IV four-cylinder, with the 3.0 V6 (automatic only) was optional on all models.

In 1988, the Quad 4 engine became available for all models. It was showcased in a special limited edition of the Calais GT, (sometimes known as the GT Quad 4). Offered across several Oldsmobile models, the Calais was also available in the International Series trim. Available as both a 2-door or a 4-door and featured exclusive options for the range including lower front and rear facias, lower rocker extensions, and quad-tipped sport exhaust. Changes inside include thickly bolstered sport seats which feature driver-side power controls and were available in cloth with leather accents or full leather. The International Series came standard with power locks and windows with driver&#x27;s side auto-down, a multifunction Driver Information Center in the center console, full gauges, cruise control, and the FE3 sport suspension. Optional equipment on the International series included keyless entry and a Delco CD player.

For 1989, the GT was dropped; however, the Quad 4 engine continued to be available for all models.

In 1990, standard engine for the International was the new Quad 4 H.O. although the normal Quad 4 L.O. and automatic transmission were an option.

== Special Editions ==

=== First Production Model ===
The first production model (VIN 1G3NT27UXFM200001), was a white Calais Supreme two-door with a gray velour interior. Equipped with an automatic transmission and the 92 horsepower, 151 CID pushrod four-cylinder engine (also known as GM&#x27;s &quot;Iron Duke&quot; Tech-IV), this particular model was outfitted with nearly every available option, including wire wheel covers. While this front-wheel drive car was maintained by the R.E. Olds Transportation Museum in Lansing, Michigan, it was one of more than 700 vehicles that made up the GM Heritage Collection. The Calais Supreme was auctioned in April, 2021, and sold for $8,585.

=== 1985 Indianapolis Pace Car ===
Oldsmobile provided the vehicles for the 1985 Indianapolis 500, including two specially built convertibles (a body style never offered by GM) as actual on-track pace cars. The convertibles, one of which was driven by actor James Garner, were painted candy-apple red with a red and silver interior. At least one of the convertible cars is still in existence and was offered at auction in 2019. In addition to the on-track cars Oldsmobile supplied &quot;Calais 500&quot; coupes with decals and special paint, they were otherwise stock. Records indicate 2,998 &quot;Calais 500&quot; editions were built for both track use and for public sale.

=== Quad 442 ===
Between 1990 and 1991, Oldsmobile offered the Quad-442. The 442 named was a call back to the previous high performance Oldsmobile automobiles. In the Calais application, the designation translated to four cylinders, four valves per cylinder and two camshafts. It used a high-output version of the four-cylinder coupled to a Getrag 5-speed manual transmission. This same High Output version was also available in the top-of-the-line Cutlass Calais International Series.

==Engines==
* 1985–1988 Tech IV I4, 92-98 hp and 
* 1989–1991 Tech IV I4, and 
* 1987–1991 Quad 4 I4, 150-160 hp and

<doc id="1102585" wikidata="Q3586351" url="?curid=1102585" title="1987 New Brunswick general election">
<text>The 1987 New Brunswick general election was held on October 13, 1987, to select the 58 members of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick of the 51st Legislature of the Canadian province of New Brunswick. The Liberal Party won power for the first time since 1967. They did so in a landslide, winning all 58 seats in the legislature. This feat was only accomplished one other time in Canadian history, in the 1935 Prince Edward Island election.

==Background==
The popularity of Richard Hatfield, who had served as a popular premier from 1970 through the 1982 election, fell due to scandals in his last term. In 1984, during an official visit to New Brunswick by Queen Elizabeth II, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers found marijuana in Hatfield&#x27;s luggage. Hatfield was later acquitted of marijuana possession charges. As reported by the media, Hatfield was also alleged to have hosted parties with young men where illegal drugs were used. He was criticized by opposition parties and by the media for extravagant use of the government plane, which he used to travel to New York City where he visited night clubs, earning him the nickname &quot;Disco Dick&quot;.

In 1985, three Saint John-area Progressive Conservative members of the legislature (MLAs) challenged Hatfield&#x27;s leadership and led a brief caucus revolt after the Liberals won two by-elections in previously Tory seats, but Hatfield led the party through a fifth election.

==Campaign==
Hoping to boost his popularity enough to avoid defeat, Hatfield delayed calling the election as long as possible. It was finally held on October 13, 1987, five years and a day since the last election—the longest allowed by the Constitution of Canada. The Tories lost all of their seats, and Hatfield himself lost his own seat to Liberal challenger Allison DeLong by 19 points. Taking full responsibility for the defeat, he announced his resignation the night of the election while being interviewed by media outside of his Hartland home. Tory supporters had crowded into Hatfield&#x27;s home, but abandoned him early in the evening as the returns began to come in.

Frank McKenna&#x27;s Liberals were virtually assured victory from day one, thanks to Hatfield&#x27;s scandals. However, they ran a very successful campaign that enabled them to garner an unprecedented clean sweep of the legislature. The New Democrats also suffered a moral defeat, losing their one seat—something they had won for the first time in 1982.

<text>The Cumberland Gap is a pass in the eastern United States through the long ridge of the Cumberland Mountains, within the Appalachian Mountains and near the tripoint of Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee. At an elevation of above sea level, it is famous in American colonial history for its role as a key passageway through the lower central Appalachians.

Long used by Native American nations, the Cumberland Gap was brought to the attention of settlers in 1750 by Thomas Walker, a Virginia physician and explorer. The path was used by a team of frontiersmen led by Daniel Boone, making it accessible to pioneers who used it to journey into the western frontiers of Kentucky and Tennessee. An important part of the Wilderness Road, it is now part of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park.

==Geography==
The Cumberland Gap is one of many passes in the Appalachian Mountains, but one of the few in the continuous Cumberland Mountain ridgeline. It lies within Cumberland Gap National Historical Park and is located on the border of present-day Kentucky and Virginia, approximately northeast of the tri-state marker with Tennessee.

The V-shaped gap serves as a gateway to the west. The base of the gap is about above the valley floor, even though the north side of the pass was lowered during the construction of Old U.S. Route 25E. To the south, the ridge rises above the pass, while to the north the Pinnacle Overlook towers above at an elevation of .

Centrally located in the eastern United States, the region around Cumberland Gap experiences all four seasons. The summers are typically sunny, warm, and humid with average high temperatures in the mid to upper 80s °F (29-32 °C). In the winter months, January through March, temperatures range in the 30s to 40s °F (0s °C) and are generally mild with rain and few periods of snow.

The nearest cities are Middlesboro, Kentucky and Harrogate, Tennessee. The nearby town of Cumberland Gap, Tennessee is named after the gap.

==Geology==

The gap was formed by the development of three major structural features: the Pine Mountain Thrust Sheet, the Middlesboro Syncline, and the Rocky Face Fault. Lateral compressive forces of sedimentary rocks from deep layers of the Earth&#x27;s crust pushing upward 320 to 200 million years ago created the thrust sheet. Resistance on the fault from the opposing Cumberland Mountain to Pine Mountain caused the U-shaped structure of the Middlesboro Syncline. The once flat-lying sedimentary rocks were deformed roughly 40 degrees northwest. Further constriction to the northwest of Cumberland Mountain developed into a fault trending north-to-south called the Rocky Face Fault, which eventually cut through Cumberland Mountain. This combination of natural geological processes created ideal conditions for weathering and erosion of the rocks.
The discovery of the Middlesboro impact structure has proposed new details in the formation of Cumberland Gap. Less than 300 million years ago a meteorite, &quot;approximately the size of a football field&quot;, struck the earth, creating the Middlesboro Crater. One of three astroblemes in the state, it is a diameter meteorite impact crater with the city of Middlesboro, Kentucky built entirely inside it. Detailed mapping by geologists in the 1960s led many to interpret the geological features of the area to be the site of an ancient impact. In 1966 Robert Dietz discovered shatter cones in nearby sandstone, proving recent speculation. Shatter cones, a rock-shattering pattern naturally formed only during impact events, are found in abundance in the area. The presence of shatter cones found also helped confirm the origin of the impact. In September 2003, the site was designated a Distinguished Geologic Site by the Kentucky Society of Professional Geologists.

Without the Rocky Face Fault, it would have been difficult for pack-horses to navigate this gap and the gap in Pine Mountain near Pineville, and it would be improbable that wagon roads would have been constructed at an early date. Middlesboro is the only place in the world where coal is mined inside an astrobleme. Special mining techniques must be used in the complicated strata of this crater.

==History==

The earliest written account of Cumberland Gap dates to the 1670s, by Abraham Wood of Virginia. Sometime before 1748, Samuel Stalnaker is believed to have passed through the gap while exploring the region.

The gap was named for Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, son of King George II of Great Britain, who had many places named for him in the American colonies after the Battle of Culloden. The explorer Thomas Walker gave the name to the Cumberland River in 1750, and the name soon spread to many other features in the region, such as the Cumberland Gap. In 1769 Joseph Martin built a fort nearby at present-day Rose Hill, Virginia, on behalf of Walker&#x27;s land claimants. But Martin and his men were chased out of the area by Native Americans, and Martin did not return until 1775.

In 1775 Daniel Boone, hired by the Transylvania Company, arrived in the region leading a company of men to widen the path through the gap to make settlement of Kentucky and Tennessee easier. On his arrival, Boone discovered that Martin had already arrived in Powell Valley, where Martin and his men were clearing land for their own settlement – the westernmost settlement in English colonial America at the time. By the 1790s, the trail that Boone and his men built had been widened to accommodate wagon traffic and became known as the Wilderness Road.

Several American Civil War engagements occurred in and around the Cumberland Gap and are known as the Battle of the Cumberland Gap. In June 1862, Union Army General George W. Morgan captured the gap for the Union. In September of that year, Confederate States Army forces under Edmund Kirby Smith occupied the gap during General Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Kentucky Invasion. The following year, in a bloodless engagement in September 1863, Union Army troops under General Ambrose Burnside forced the surrender of 2,300 Confederates defending the gap, gaining Union control of the gap for the remainder of the war.

It is estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 European-American settlers passed through the gap on their way into Kentucky and the Ohio Valley before 1810. Today 18,000 cars pass beneath the site daily, and 1.2 million people visit the park on the site annually. The park features many hiking trails.

U.S. Route 25E passed overland through the gap before the completion of the Cumberland Gap Tunnel in 1996. The original trail was then restored.

===Historic district===
The gap and associated historic resources were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district on May 28, 1980.

==Biology and ecology==
===Flora===
Within the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park there are currently 855 known species of vascular plants identified, but that number is expected to increase with reports from National Park Service inventory and monitoring programs. There are 15 various vegetation communities throughout the park, with some of them in special locations, such as mountain bogs, low-elevation wetlands, and rocky bluffs.

===Fauna===
Of the 371 species of animals listed as of 2014 within the park, 33 are mammals, 89 are birds, 29 amphibians, 15 reptiles, 27 fish, and 187 are insects, however many others remain to be included. Visitors to the park can expect to see gray squirrels, white-tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, songbirds, hawks, snakes, turtles, and perhaps black bear or bobcat. Over 120 species of birds have been logged in the park on the website eBird.

==In popular culture==
===Music===

The gap has been mentioned in many songs and is the title of many, including:
* &quot;Cumberland Gap&quot; (first recorded in 1924) is a popular folk song recorded and performed by American folk and bluegrass musicians such as Woody Guthrie and Earl Scruggs, and by British skiffle artists such as Lonnie Donegan and the Vipers Skiffle Group.
* &quot;Cumberland Gap&quot;, by American band Ragged Mountain String Band
* &quot;Cumberland Blues&quot;, by the Grateful Dead on the 1970 album Workingman&#x27;s Dead
* &quot;Cumberland Gap&quot;, by Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit
* &quot;Cumberland Gap&quot;, by David Rawlings on his 2017 album &quot;Poor David&#x27;s Almanack&quot;
* &quot;Mighty Joe Moon&quot;, by Grant Lee Buffalo on their album Mighty Joe Moon
* &quot;Wagon Wheel&quot;, by Old Crow Medicine Show
* &quot;Wagon Wheel&quot;, by Darius Rucker – Rucker&#x27;s version reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart and was certified triple platinum by the RIAA in March 2014

<text>The United States Maritime Commission was an independent executive agency of the U.S. federal government that was created by the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, which was passed by Congress on June 29, 1936, and was abolished on May 24, 1950. The commission replaced the United States Shipping Board which had existed since World War I. It was intended to formulate a merchant shipbuilding program to design and build five hundred modern merchant cargo ships to replace the World War I vintage vessels that comprised the bulk of the United States Merchant Marine, and to administer a subsidy system authorized by the Act to offset the cost differential between building in the U.S. and operating ships under the American flag. It also formed the United States Maritime Service for the training of seagoing ship&#x27;s officers to man the new fleet.

As a symbol of the rebirth of the U.S. Merchant Marine and Merchant Shipbuilding under the Merchant Marine Act, the first vessel contracted for was . Owned by the United States Lines, she briefly operated in the passenger liner and cruise service before being converted into a high-speed transport, per her design.

From 1939 through the end of World War II, the Maritime Commission funded and administered the largest and most successful merchant shipbuilding effort in world history. By the end of the war, U.S. shipyards working under Maritime Commission contracts had built a total of 5,777 oceangoing merchant and naval ships and many smaller vessels.

A huge postwar contraction followed, with massive sell-offs to foreign militaries and commercial fleets. The last major shipbuilding project undertaken by the Commission was to oversee the design and construction of the super passenger liner which was intended to be both a symbol of American technological might and maritime predominance but also could be quickly converted into the world&#x27;s fastest naval troop transport.

The Maritime Commission was abolished on 24 May 1950, and its functions were divided between the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission which was responsible for regulating shipping trades and trade routes and the United States Maritime Administration, which was responsible for administering the construction and operating subsidy programs, maintaining NDRF, and operating the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy which had been built and opened during World War II and which continues to be funded as the nation&#x27;s federally operated maritime academy under 46 USC 310.

==History==
===Purposes===
The purpose of the Maritime Commission was multifold as described in the Merchant Marine Act&#x27;s Declaration of Policy. The first role was to formulate a merchant shipbuilding program to design and then have built over a ten-year period 500 modern fast merchant cargo ships which would replace the World War I-vintage vessels which made up the bulk of the U.S. Merchant Marine prior to the Act. Those ships were intended to be chartered (leased) to U.S. shipping companies for their use in the foreign seagoing trades for whom they would be able to offer better and more economical freight services to their clients. The ships were also intended to serve as a reserve naval auxiliary force in the event of armed conflict which was a duty the U.S. merchant fleet had often filled throughout the years since the Revolutionary War. The second role given to the Maritime Commission was to administer a subsidy system authorized by the Act which would offset the differential cost between both building in the U.S. and operating ships under the American flag. Another function given to the Commission involved the formation of the U.S. Maritime Service for the training of seagoing ship&#x27;s officers to man the new fleet. The actual licensing of officers and seamen still resided with the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation.

===Pre-World War II===
President Roosevelt nominated Joseph P. Kennedy first head of the Commission. Kennedy held that position until February 1938 when he left to become US Ambassador to Great Britain. After Kennedy&#x27;s departure, the chairmanship was assumed by Rear Admiral Emory S. Land, USN (ret.), who had been the head of U.S. Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction and Repair prior to his appointment to the Commission on the behest of the President and where he had been a deputy commissioner since the founding of the body. The other four members of the Commission in the years before the beginning of World War II were a mix of retired naval officers and men from disciplines of law and business. The man most notable in the group Land brought to the Commission was Commander Howard L. Vickery, USN, who, like Land, was a naval officer closely involved in the construction of new Navy vessels. Vickery became responsible for overseeing the Commission&#x27;s shipbuilding functions including the design and construction of the ships, developing shipyards to build them and companies to manufacture the complicated and highly specialized ship&#x27;s machinery. As World War II drew closer, Vickery was very much at the forefront of putting into place the Emergency Shipbuilding Program which men like Henry J. Kaiser were so instrumental in developing into an industry which would perform some of the greatest feats of wartime industrial production ever previously witnessed and never since matched.

As a symbol of the rebirth of the U.S. Merchant Marine and Merchant Shipbuilding under the Merchant Marine Act, the first vessel contracted for was , which was owned by the United States Line and operated in the passenger liner and cruise service during 1940-1. Upon the U.S. entry into World War II, &quot;America&quot; was requisitioned by the U.S. Navy and became . In the prewar years, several dozen other merchant ships were built for the Commission under its original 500 ship Long Range Shipbuilding Program but it was not until the late fall of 1940 the critical importance of the Commission to the defense of the lifeline to Great Britain and to the national mobilization for war became apparent when the beginnings of the Emergency Shipbuilding program were laid. Together, all the Maritime Commission&#x27;s shipbuilding program became known as and great pride was taken in it by the many thousands of ordinary citizens went to work in the shipyards and joined the ranks of the shipbuilding workforce.

===World War II===
From 1939 through the end of World War II, the Maritime Commission funded and administered the largest and most successful merchant shipbuilding effort in world history, producing thousands of ships and other vessels, including Liberty ships, Victory ships, and others, notably Type B barges; Type C1, Type C2, Type C3, and Type C4 freighters; Type R refrigerator ships; T1, T2, and T3 tankers, and Type V tugs. Most of the C2s and C3s were converted to Navy auxiliaries, notably attack cargo ships, attack transports, and escort aircraft carriers and many of the tankers became fleet replenishment oilers. The Commission also was tasked with the construction of many hundred &quot;military type&quot; vessels such as Landing Ship, Tank (LST)s and s (PF)s and large troop transports for the Navy and Army Transportation Corps. By the end of the war, U.S. shipyards working under Maritime Commission contracts had built a total of 5,777 oceangoing merchant and naval ships.

In early 1942 both the training and licensing was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard for administration, but then late in the fall of 1942, the Maritime Service was transferred to the newly created War Shipping Administration which itself was created for the purpose of overseeing the operation of the fleet of merchant ships being built by the Emergency Program for the needs of the U.S. Armed Services. The WSA was added to the list of wartime agencies created within the Roosevelt Administration and was intended to relieve the already full plate of responsibilities of the Commission, yet they shared the same Chairman in Admiral Land and so worked very closely together.

===Post World War II===
With the end of World War II, both the Emergency and Long Range shipbuilding programs were terminated as there were far too many merchant vessels now for the Nation&#x27;s peacetime needs. In 1946, the Commission was chaired by Vice admiral William W. Smith and the Merchant Ship Sales Act was passed to sell off a large portion of the ships previously built during the war to commercial buyers, both domestic and foreign. This facilitated the rebuilding of the fleets of both allied nations such as Great Britain, Norway and Greece which had lost a majority of their prewar vessels to the Battles of the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Although not sold outright to nations that were enemies during the war, U.S. merchant ships helped nations such as Japan, which had lost many hundreds of its merchant vessels to the Allies&#x27; submarine offensive in the western Pacific, recover their merchant shipping capacity via the loan of vessels and the carrying of relief cargoes to war ravaged Europe. Ships were also used in both the rebuilding programs under the Marshall Plan and the transport of food aid sent during the desperate winter of 1945-46 when famine loomed large over much of the European continent. For the next 25 years, in ports all around the world one could find dozens of ships which had been built during the war but which now were used in peace. Many of those same ships continued to sail until the early 1980s but most had been sold for scrap in the 1960s and 1970s as more modern designs were developed and more efficient slow speed diesel engines introduced to replace the steamships which predominated those built by the Commission during the war years.

Ships not disposed of through the Ship Sales Act were placed into one of eight National Defense Reserve Fleet(NDRF) sites maintained on the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf coasts. On several occasions in the postwar years ships in the reserve fleets were activated for both military and humanitarian aid missions. The last major mobilization of the NDRF came during the Vietnam War. Since then, a smaller fleet of ships called the Ready Reserve Force has been mobilized to support both humanitarian and military missions.

====SS &quot;United States&quot;====
The last major shipbuilding project undertaken by the Commission was to oversee the design and construction of the super passenger liner , which was intended to be both a symbol of American technological might and maritime predominance but also could be quickly converted into the world&#x27;s fastest naval troop transport.

===Abolition===
The Maritime Commission was abolished on 24 May 1950, and its functions were divided between the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission which was responsible for regulating shipping trades and trade routes and the United States Maritime Administration, which was responsible for administering the construction and operating subsidy programs, maintaining NDRF, and operating the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy which had been built and opened during World War II and which continues to be funded and operated today as one of the five Federal Service Academies.

<text>The Clearance Divers Breathing Apparatus (CDBA) is a type of rebreather made by Siebe Gorman in England.

The British Royal Navy used it for many years. It was for underwater work rather than for combat diving. The main oxygen cylinders are on the diver&#x27;s back. The oxygen cylinders at the front of the diver are for bailout. In its basic mode it was an oxygen rebreather; but some of the cylinders could be replaced by diluent cylinders for nitrox mode (which the Navy called &quot;mixture&quot;), and then the set was sometimes called CDMBA. The Royal Navy was using nitrox from 1944, but did not reveal its nitrox techniques, and in the 1960s and afterwards civilian divers had to retread the same ground and develop nitrox diving independently. In later years it was called DSSCCD from &quot;Diving Set, Self-Contained, Clearance Diver&quot;.

==Design==

The CDBA was very popular with the clearance divers. It is comfortable since there is no cylinder on the middle of the back, no bulky buoyancy compensator, and it requires very little weight.

As the rebreather has a single &quot;pendulum&quot; breathing tube, the diver must breathe deeply to avoid carbon dioxide build-up. The counterlung is eight litres. As with all rebreathers, the diver should breathe continuously to keep the gas flowing over the absorbent. Dives on the unit are limited to 90 minutes.

Instead of a weight belt there is a weight pouch at the back, full of lead ball weights in diameter. In an emergency, the diver could pull a line which opened the weight pouch to jettison these weights.

It is intended to be used with a fullface mask with one breathing tube. At first (during World War II and after) a mask with an oval or circular flat window (as seen in images at this link) was used; later the mask with the newer type of rectangular window mostly flat but folded back at the sides was used.

==Modes of setting up the CDBA==
The front cylinders were intended as a bailout; the main cylinders are on the back.

For a short dive the set could be used without the back cylinders, using only the front cylinders; this made the set very light and compact and suitable for getting through small holes. Even with the back cylinders the diver is much more compact and streamlined and agile than most recreational open circuit scuba.

The front and the back of the harness can unclip from each other at the shoulders. There is no automatic gas control: so safe use of the set relied entirely on training.

==Other similar rebreathers==

British &quot;frogman&#x27;s&quot; sets used the same shape of counterlung as the CDBA but different cylinders. One type was the &quot;Swimmer Canoeists Breathing Apparatus&quot; (SCBA), which had oxygen cylinders on the back, vertically for better streamlining in swimming, the oxygen connections thinner, and no cylinders on the front, leaving the diver&#x27;s lower front uncluttered for climbing in and out of small boats. The SCBA gave 90 minutes dive duration with no reserve. In mixture (nitrox or heliox) mode it was called SCMBA. An old photograph seems to show the cylinders (and perhaps also the weights) in a tied or laced canvas casing rather than held on with metal clamps, and a rectangular fullface mask as with the CDBA. There is a British armed forces manual about the SCBA, dated 1984 as if the SCBA was still in use then, showing separate eyes-and-nose mask and strapped-in mouthpiece and no canvas pouch, and separate sport-type weight belt with buckle-shaped weights all at the back. The design of the Swimmer Canoeists Breathing Apparatus likely changed down the years.

The LOSE (Lightweight Oxygen Swimmers Equipment), a diving rebreather formerly made by Siebe Gorman, was similar to a Swimmer Canoeist&#x27;s Breathing Apparatus including the cylinder backpack.

Other British frogmen&#x27;s sets had no back cylinders and one or more big cylinders across the belly: one of these modes was the UBA (Underwater Breathing Apparatus).

===Other meanings of those initials===
*The letters &quot;SCBA&quot; had two other meanings connected to breathing sets:
**Submerged Chamber Breathing Apparatus (formerly used to aerate submerged air-chambers).
**Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (its modern meaning, it means industrial breathing sets (usually open-circuit) for use on land)

For other uses of the letters &quot;UBA&quot; see UBA.

<doc id="1102633" wikidata="Q63659" url="?curid=1102633" title="Gabriel Heinze">
<text>Gabriel Iván Heinze (; born 19 April 1978) is an Argentine football coach and former player. As a player, he operated as a defender, either as a left-back or a centre-back.

Nicknamed &quot;Gringo&quot;, he made a name for himself at Paris Saint-Germain, moving in 2004 to Manchester United and subsequently to Real Madrid, winning three trophies in total with the latter two clubs. He started and finished his 18-year professional career with Newell&#x27;s Old Boys.

Heinze played 72 times for the Argentina national team, including at two FIFA World Cup and two Copa América tournaments. In 2015, he began working as a manager, leading four teams in the Argentine Primera División.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Heinze was born in Crespo, Entre Ríos to a father of Volga German descent and a mother of Italian descent, thus also holding an Italian and a German passport. He began his career in his home country with Newell&#x27;s Old Boys and, following attention from various European clubs, the 19-year-old signed for Real Valladolid in Spain, not managing one single La Liga appearance in his first season and also being loaned to Sporting CP in December 1998.

After the 2000–01 campaign, where he appeared in 36 league games to help the Castile and León side narrowly avoid top flight relegation, Heinze moved to Paris Saint-Germain, where he amassed over 100 overall appearances in three years, helping to the 2004 conquest of the Coupe de France.

===Manchester United===
In June 2004, Heinze joined Manchester United for a fee of £6.9 million. He marked his debut on 11 September with a goal in a 2–2 away draw against Bolton Wanderers, and immediately established himself as first-choice left-back, being regularly lauded by fans with the chant of &quot;Ar-gen-tina!&quot; and eventually voted the club&#x27;s best player for the 2004–05 season.

On 14 September 2005, Heinze was injured in a UEFA Champions League match with Villarreal and was ruled out of first-team action for the rest of the campaign. Previously, he had scored two goals in the same competition, the 3–0 second-leg qualifier away win over Debreceni. He made a comeback with the reserve team in April 2006, but a minor injury picked up in his third game back prevented him from making a first-team appearance before the end of the season. The consequence of this injury was the signing of Patrice Evra, who went on to become the club&#x27;s first-choice left-back in the following years.

Heinze returned to action for United in 2006–07, and eventually won a place in the side back as a central defender, due to an injury crisis. After the team had sealed the Premier League title, he was named captain for the last two games of the season, away to Chelsea and at home to West Ham United.

After becoming disillusioned with manager Alex Ferguson by his lack of regular first-team action, Heinze demanded a transfer to Liverpool during the close season. United rejected the bid, believed to be in the region of £6.8 million.

===Real Madrid===

On 22 August 2007, Heinze joined Real Madrid on a four-year deal, becoming the third United player to join the Spaniards (after David Beckham and Ruud van Nistelrooy), for a reported £8 million fee. He made his debut on 2 September against Villarreal, coming on as a substitute for Raúl. On 30 March 2008 he netted his first goal for the &quot;Merengues&quot;, in a 3–1 home win over Sevilla, and finished his debut season with 20 appearances to help win the league.

Heinze was more regularly used in his second year at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, but the club came out empty in silverware, with the exception of that year&#x27;s Supercopa de España.

===Marseille===

On 30 July 2009, Heinze joined Marseille on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee, reuniting at the Ligue 1 club with countryman Lucho González. In his first year he scored a career-best four league goals in 27 matches, as &quot;L&#x27;OM&quot; won both the national championship and the season&#x27;s Coupe de la Ligue. On 27 March 2010 he was a starter as his team defeated Bordeaux in the latter competition&#x27;s final, for Marseille&#x27;s first major title since 1993; on 5 May, he netted the opener in a 3–1 home win against Rennes, which clinched the league. Manager Didier Deschamps later described the season&#x27;s events as an &quot;extraordinary human adventure&quot;.

Heinze was again a defensive stalwart in the 2010–11 season. On 20 March 2011, he scored from a free kick to help defeat his former club PSG 2–1 at home in the &quot;Clasico&quot;.

On 1 June 2011, it was announced on Marseille&#x27;s website that 33-year-old Heinze would leave the club at the end of the season.

===Later years===
Heinze joined Serie A side AS Roma on 22 July 2011, after being released by Marseille at the end of June. He made his competitive debut on 11 September, in a 1–2 home loss against Cagliari.

On 19 March 2012, after appearing in his 25th official game, Heinze had his contract automatically renewed for another year. However, just five months later, it was announced on Roma&#x27;s official website that he was being released from his contract with immediate effect; the day after his release he joined his original club, Newell&#x27;s Old Boys, on a two-year deal.

==International career ==
Heinze first represented Argentina on 30 April 2003, in a friendly away win with Libya. The following year, he was selected as one of the three overage players then Argentina U23 won the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He scored in a 6–0 win over Serbia and Montenegro in the group stage.

Despite missing most of 2005–06 with Manchester United due to injury, Heinze was called up for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals in Germany. In the quarter-final clash against the hosts, he started as Argentina lost on penalties.

Heinze participated in the 2007 Copa América, scoring with his head from a Juan Román Riquelme free kick in the semi-finals against Mexico, a 3–0 win for the eventual runners-up. In the 2010 FIFA World Cup he played in four of Argentina&#x27;s five matches in South Africa, netting the game&#x27;s only goal – his third international – in a group stage victory over Nigeria.

==Coaching career==
===Early years===
Even though he still did not possess the proper license, Heinze began working as a manager in June 2015, being appointed at Godoy Cruz in the Argentine Primera División. On 12 July, he won 3–0 at home to Crucero del Norte on his debut. He was sacked on 27 September, following two wins, two draws and six defeats.

Heinze signed at Argentinos Juniors in June 2016. In July of the following year, after achieving top-level promotion, he resigned.

On 11 December 2017, Heinze was appointed at Vélez Sarsfield. Having led the team to two consecutive Copa Sudamericana qualifications, he chose not to continue past the end of the 2019–20 season.

===Atlanta United===
On 18 December 2020, Heinze was named manager of Major League Soccer club Atlanta United on a two-year contract. On his debut the following 6 April, the side won by one goal away to Alajuelense of Costa Rica, in the last-16 first leg of the CONCACAF Champions League.

Heinze banished Atlanta&#x27;s star striker Josef Martínez from training, and publicly said that this was his own decision, rather than a precaution based on the Venezuelan&#x27;s COVID-19 diagnosis at the 2021 Copa América. On 18 July that year, having won just twice in 13 games, he was dismissed from his job.

===Newell&#x27;s Old Boys===
On 25 October 2022, Heinze was hired by Newell&#x27;s, having rejected an offer from the club the previous December. His team were knocked out in the last 64 of the Copa Argentina on 22 February, 1–0 at home to fourth-tier Club Atlético Claypole. He left after one year at the club, in which they had a mid-table league finish and elimination from the last 16 of the Copa Sudamericana by Sport Club Corinthians Paulista.

==Personal life==
Heinze was named in the Panama Papers, a 2016 leak of offshore accounts used for tax evasion. In 2005, he signed an endorsement with Puma AG in which at least a million dollars was paid to him over a period of five years through an account in his mother&#x27;s name in the British Virgin Islands.

An urban myth, published in sources including UEFA&#x27;s website, alleged that Heinze was a member of &quot;Y Wladfa&quot;, the Welsh-speaking colony in Patagonia. This was proven false by a Manchester United spokeswoman.

<doc id="1102634" wikidata="Q897298" url="?curid=1102634" title="Brahma Sutras">
<text>The Brahma Sūtras (), also known as the Vedanta Sūtra (Sanskrit: वेदान्त सूत्र), Shariraka Sūtra, and Bhikshu-sūtra, are a Sanskrit text which criticizes the metaphysical dualism of the influential Samkhya philosophy, and instead synthesizes and harmonizes divergent Upanishadic ideas and practices about the essence of existence, postulating God-like Brahman as the only origin and essence of everything. It is attributed to the sages Bādarāyaṇa, who is also called Vyāsa (arranger), but probably an accumulation of incremental additions and changes by various authors to an earlier work, completed in its surviving form in approx. 400–450 CE. The oldest version may be composed between 500 BCE and 200 BCE, with 200 BCE being the most likely date.

The &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; consist of 555 aphoristic verses (sutras) in four chapters, dealing with attaining knowledge of Brahman. Rejecting the &quot;smriti&quot; as a base of knowledge, it declares that the Vedic Upanishads are the only acceptable source of truth, unfallible revelations describing the same metaphysical Reality, Brahman, which cannot be different for different people. The text attempts to synthesize and harmonize diverse and sometimes apparently conflicting &quot;vidyas&quot; (&quot;knowledges&quot;) of, and &quot;upasanas&quot; (meditation, worship) of the essence of existence, stating they are actually synonyms for Brahman. It does so from a bhedabheda-perspective, arguing, as John Koller states: &quot;that Brahman and Atman are, in some respects, different, but, at the deepest level, non-different (advaita), being identical.&quot; 

The first chapter rejects Samkhya&#x27;s view on pradhana, stating that an inert first principle cannot account for a universe which reflects purpose and intelligence. It harmonizes different views of Absolute Reality found in the Upanishads, subsuming them under the concept of Brahman. The second chapter reviews and addresses the objections raised by samkhya and other competing orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, Nyaya, Yoga, Vaisheshika and Mimamsa, as well as heterodox schools such as Buddhism and Jainism. The third chapter compares the &quot;vidyas&quot; and &quot;upasanas&quot; found in the Upanishads, deciding which are similar and can be combined, and which are different. The last chapter states why such a knowledge is an important human need.

The &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; is one of three most important texts in Vedanta along with the Principal Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. It has been influential to various schools of Indian philosophies, but interpreted differently by the non-dualistic Advaita Vedanta sub-school, and the Vaishnav theistic Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita Vedanta sub-schools, as well as others. Several commentaries on the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; are lost to history or yet to be found; of the surviving ones, the most well studied commentaries on the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; include the bhashya by Adi Shankara, and the Vaishna-exegetes Ramanuja, Madhvacharya, Bhaskara, Baladeva Vidyabhushan, Ramanandacharya.

==Author and chronology==
The &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; or &quot;Brahmasutra&quot; are attributed to Badarayana. In some texts, Badarayana is also called &quot;Vyasa&quot;, which literally means &quot;one who arranges&quot;.

Badarayana was the Guru (teacher) of Jaimini, the latter credited with authoring Mimamsa Sutras of the Mimamsa school of Hindu philosophy. This is likely, given that both Badarayana and Jaimini quote each other as they analyze each other&#x27;s theories, Badarayana emphasizing knowledge while Jaimini emphasizes rituals, sometimes agreeing with each other, sometimes disagreeing, often anti-thesis of the other.

The &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; text is dated to centuries that followed Buddha and Mahavira, because it mentions and critiques the ideas of Buddhism and Jainism in Chapter 2. The text&#x27;s relative chronology is also based on the fact that Badarayana quotes all major known orthodox Hindu schools of philosophy except Nyaya. The exact century of its composition or completion in final form is unknown. 200 BCE seems to be the most likely date for its initial composition, with scholars such as Lochtefeld suggesting that the text was composed sometime between 500 and 200 BCE, while Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Dasgupta independently suggest the 2nd century BCE as more likely. Paul Deussen places it between 200 BCE and 400 CE.

Hermann Jacobi in early 20th century suggested that Madhyamaka Buddhist concepts such as &quot;Sunyavada&quot;, acknowledged in the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot;, may be a late invention, and suggests that both Sunyavada and &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; may therefore have emerged between 200 and 450 CE. Daniel Ingalls disagreed with Jacobi chronology in his 1954 paper, critiquing Jacobi&#x27;s assumptions and interpretation of sutras 2.2.28-32 in dating the entire document, and stating that &quot;the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; could not have been composed later than the start of the common era&quot;. According to Hajime Nakamura, the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; were likely complete in the current form between 400 and 450 CE. The existence of earlier versions of the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot;, and multiple authors predating Badarayana, is supported by textual evidence.

Some scholars, such as Sengaku Mayeda, state that the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; that have survived into the modern times may be the work of multiple authors but those who lived after Badarayana, and that these authors composed the currently surviving &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; starting about 300 BCE through about 400-450 CE. Nakamura states that the original version of &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; is likely very ancient and its inception coincides with the Kalpa Sutras period (1st-millennium BCE).

Natalia Isaeva states, &quot;on the whole, scholars are rather unanimous, considering the most probable date for &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; sometime between the 2nd-century BCE and the 2nd-century CE.

Assigning a later date because of mention of concepts of Buddhism etc., is rejected by Madhvacharya in his work, Anuvyakhyana. He explains the mention of different philosophies and their criticism in the &quot;Brahma&quot; &quot;Sūtras&quot; as refutations of general ideas, which are eternal, and not of specific schools of thought like Buddhism etc. So, there is no necessity to assign a later date.

==Structure==
The &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; consist of 555 aphorisms or sūtras, in four chapters (&quot;adhyāya&quot;), with each chapter divided into four parts (&quot;pāda&quot;). Each part is further subdivided into sections called &quot;Adhikaraņas&quot; with &quot;sutras&quot;. Some scholars, such as Francis Clooney, call the &quot;Adhikaraņas&quot; as &quot;case studies&quot; with a defined hermeneutic process.

Each &quot;Adhikaraņa&quot; of &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; has varying numbers of sutras, and most sections of the text are structured to address the following:
# &quot;Sangati&quot; (सङ्गति): connection between sections, synthesis, or coming together of knowledge. Setting the context.
# &quot;Vishaya&quot; (विषय): subject, issue or topic
# &quot;Vismaya&quot; (विस्मय): doubt, uncertainty or perplexity. Also called &quot;Sandeha&quot; (संदेह)
# &quot;Purva-paksha&quot; (पूर्वपक्ष): prima facie view, or prior part and arguments
# &quot;Siddhanta&quot; (सिद्धान्त): theory and arguments presented, proposed doctrine, or conclusions

The &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; text has 189 &quot;Adhikaranas&quot;. Each section (case study) in the text opens with the &quot;Mukhya&quot; (chief, main) sutra that states the purpose of that section, and the various sections of the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; include &quot;Vishaya-Vakyas&quot; (cite the text sources and evidence they use).

Sutras were meant to assist the memory of the student who had gone through long discussions with his guru, as memory aids or clues and maximum thoughts were compressed in a few words which were unambiguous, giving the essence of the arguments on the topic. The Sutras of the text, states Adi Shankara in his commentary, are structured like a string that ties together the Vedanta texts like a garland of flowers.

==Contents==
The text is part of the Prasthanatrayi, or the three starting points for the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. The Principal Upanishads constitute the &quot;Sruti prasthāna&quot; or &quot;starting point of heard scriptures,&quot; while the Bhagavad Gita constitutes the &quot;Smriti prasthāna&quot; or the &quot;starting point of remembered canonical base&quot;, and the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; constitute the &quot;Nyāya prasthāna&quot; (न्याय प्रस्थान) or &quot;starting point of reasoning canonical base.&quot;

Sengaku Mayeda states that the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; distills and consolidates the extensive teachings found in a variety of Upanishads of Hinduism, summarizing, arranging, unifying and systematizing the Upanishadic theories, possibly &quot;written from a Bhedābheda Vedāntic viewpoint.&quot; The Vedic literature had grown into an enormous collection of ideas and practices, ranging from practical rituals (karma-kanda) to abstract philosophy (jnana-kanda), with different and conflicting theories on metaphysical problems, diverse mutually contradicting unsystematized teachings on rituals and philosophies present in the Upanishads. Traditions of textual interpretation developed. While Jaimini&#x27;s Mimamsa-sutra focused on externalized rituals as the spiritual path, Badarayana&#x27;s &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot;, the only surviving work of several of such compendia, focused on internalized philosophy as the spiritual path.
The text reviews and critiques the major orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy as well as all heterodox Indian philosophies such as Buddhism; especially Samkhya and Yoga philosophies are noted, which seem to have been hold in high regard in his time. It recurrently refers to them in all its four chapters, adding in sutras 2.1.3 and 4.2.21 that Yoga and Samkhya are similar. The text cites and quotes from the ten Principal Upanishads often, particularly the Kaushitaki Upanishad and the Shvetashvatara Upanishad in several sutras. Additionally, it also mentions Upanishads that are now unknown and lost. The contents of the text also acknowledge and analyze the various Vedic schools, and mentions the existence of multiple, diverging versions of the same underlying text.

The sutras of the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; are aphorisms, which Paul Deussen states to be &quot;threads stretched out in weaving to form the basis of the web&quot;, and intelligible &quot;when the woof is added&quot; with a commentary.

===Chapter 1: Harmonisation of views on Brahman===
The central theme of the first chapter is considered &quot;Samanvaya&quot; (Harmony), because it aims to distill, synchronize and bring into a harmonious whole the seemingly diverse and conflicting passages in various Sruti texts. It consists of 134 sutras, with eleven &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; in the first &quot;Pada&quot;, seven &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; in second, fourteen &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; in third, and eight in the fourth &quot;Pada&quot;. The different sub-schools of Vedanta have interpreted the sutras in the last &quot;Pada&quot; differently, and some count only seven &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; in the fourth &quot;Pada&quot;.
This &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; chapter asserts that all the Upanishads primarily aim to and coherently describe the knowledge and meditation of Brahman, the ultimate reality. According to Mayeda, &quot;the &quot;Brahmasutra&quot; made a special point of refuting the dualism of the then prevailing Samkhya school which posited &quot;Purusha&quot; (Spirit) and &quot;Prakriti&quot; (Matter) as the independent causes of the Universe. The &quot;Brahmasutra&quot; maintained instead that &quot;Brahman&quot; alone is the absolute ultimate cause of the Universe.&quot; Brahman is the source from which the world came into existence, in whom it inheres and to which it returns. The only source for the knowledge of this Brahman is the Sruti or the Upanishads.

The first word (&quot;atha&quot; - now, then) of the first &quot;sutra&quot; has occasioned different interpretations. Ramanuja and Nimbarka argue that it refers to the position of knowledge of Brahman as coming &quot;after the knowledge of &quot;karman&quot; and its fruits&quot;. Shankara takes it as referencing the &quot;acquisition of the four requisite&quot; qualities: &quot;discrimination between eternal and non-eternal things, aversion to the enjoyment of the objects of sense here and in the next world, possession of self-restraint, tranquillity etc., and the desire to be absolutely free&quot;. Vallabha disagrees that one needs the four qualities before entering into an inquiry about Brahman, and interprets &quot;atha&quot; as merely initiating the beginning of a new topic.

The sutras 1.1.5-11 address the Samkhya school&#x27;s view that &quot;pradhana&quot; (prakriti) is the primal matter and the cause of the world, and that the Principle of the world is unconscious. The text refutes this claim by using scriptural references to establish that the Principle of the world is conscious and the Brahman itself. The remaining sutras in Pada 1.1 and all sutras in Padas 1.2 and 1.3 assert that Brahman is the primary focus of the Upanishads, is various aspects of empirical reality, quoting various verses in support, from Taittiriya Upanishad, Chandogya Upanishad, Kaushitaki Upanishad, Mundaka Upanishad, Katha Upanishad, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and Prashna Upanishad.

The first chapter in sutras 1.4.1-15 presents the Samkhya theories on Prakriti, and rejects its theories by demonstrating that they are inconsistent with and misinterpretations of the Katha, Brihadaranyaka, Shvetashvatara and Taittiriya Upanishad. Sutras 1.4.23-27 argue, according to many schools, that Brahman is the efficient cause and the material cause of the world. The last sutra of the first chapter extends the arguments that refutes Samkhya theories to the atomists&#x27; theories (the Vaisheshika school of Hindu philosophy).

===Chapter 2: Rejection of competing theories===
Second chapter (&quot;Avirodha&quot;: non-conflict, non-contradiction): discusses and refutes the possible objections to Vedānta philosophy, and states that the central themes of Vedanta are consistent across the various Vedic texts. The Brahma Sūtra states, examines and dismisses the refutations raised by other schools of thought, those now classified under Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. The second chapter consists of 157 sutras, with thirteen &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; in the first &quot;Pada&quot;, eight in second, seventeen &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; in third, and nine in the fourth &quot;Pada&quot;. Whereas the entire first chapter is focused on demonstrating that the Samkhya doctrine that the world created by the unconscious &quot;pradhana&quot; is wrong, and that the Upanishads substantiate the conscious Brahman as the cause of the world, the second chapter is engaged in responding to objections against the doctrine of Brahman raised in other schools. The first &quot;Adhikarana&quot; argues that when a &quot;smriti&quot; (texts of speculative reasoning) conflicts with the &quot;sruti&quot; (the Vedas), only that which is supported by the Vedas must be affirmed.

The second chapter of the &quot;Brahma Sūtra&quot; has been variously interpreted by various monist, theistic and other sub-schools of Vedanta. The Advaita school for example, states Francis Clooney, asserts that the &quot;identity of Atman and Brahman&quot; based Advaita system is the coherent system while other systems conflict with the Upanishads, or are internally inconsistent, or incoherent with observed reality and cosmos. The theistic sub-schools interpret the text to be stating that Atman is different from Brahman, and thereafter each explains how other systems conflict with the Upanishads or are incoherent.

The Pada 2.1 opens with &quot;Adhikarana&quot; on Samkhya and Vaisheshika schools argument that Smritis should be a basis for examining the concept of Brahman, and their objections to the Vedanta theory of reflection. The &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; asserts in 2.1.13 through 2.1.20 that the subject and object are one in Brahman, which agrees with Samkhya that there is an identity in cause and effect, adding that the Brahman and the empirical world are therefore one. The sutras 2.1.21 through 2.1.36 present the problem of evil, offering its own doctrine to address it, asserting that Brahman is neither unjust nor cruel, and that inequality and evil exists in the world because of will, choices and circumstances created by actions of living beings over time.

The sutras in Pada 2.1 are variously interpreted by Advaita, Dvaita, Vishishtadvaita and other sub-schools of Vedanta. The monist Advaita school holds that ignorance or &quot;Avidya&quot; (wrong knowledge) is the root of &quot;problem of evil&quot;; in contrast, dualistic Vedanta schools hold karma and samsara to be the root.

The atomistic physico-theological theories of Vaisheshika and Samkhya school are the focus of the first seventeen sutras of Pada 2.2. The theories of Buddhism are refuted in sutras 2.2.18 through 2.2.32, while the theories of Jainism are analyzed by the text in sutras 2.2.33 through 2.2.36.

The theories of other orthodox traditions are discussed in 2.2.37 through 2.2.45. Ramanuja and Shankara disagree in their formulation as well as critique of then extant orthodox traditions, in their respective commentaries, but both agree that the theory on emergence of &quot;Pradyumna&quot; (intellect) in the competing orthodox system is the primary flaw.

The first eight case studies in the third &quot;Pada&quot; of chapter 2 discuss whether the world has an origin or not, whether the universe is co-eternal with Brahman or is an effect of Brahman (interpreted as dualistic God in theistic sub-schools of Vedanta), and whether the universe returns into Brahman periodically. The last nine &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; of the third &quot;Pada&quot; discuss the nature of soul, whether it is eternal, is soul an agent, soul&#x27;s relationship to Brahman, and states its proof that the soul exists and is immortal.

The last &quot;Pada&quot; of the second chapter extracts and summarizes the theories of human body, sensory organs, action organs and their relationship to &quot;Prana&quot; (vital breath) in the various Vedic Brahmanas and Upanishads. The &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; states that the organs inside a living being are independent principles, in the seventh and eighth &quot;Adhikarana&quot; of the fourth &quot;Pada&quot;. The various sub-schools of Vedanta interpret the sutras in the fourth &quot;Pada&quot; differently.

===Chapter 3: The means to spiritual knowledge===

Third chapter (&quot;Sādhana&quot;: the means): describes the process by which ultimate emancipation can be achieved. The topics discussed are diverse. The third chapter is the longest and consists of 186 sutras, with six &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; in its first &quot;Pada&quot;, eight in second, thirty six in third, and fourteen &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; in the fourth &quot;Pada&quot;.

====The nature of liberating knowledge====
The third chapter focuses on the yearning for knowledge of Brahman, and the means to attain it. Dissatisfaction with mundane life and strengthening the wish for liberation is invoked, treating the theory of death and rebirth, karma and importance of conduct and free will, and the connection between Atman (Self, Soul) and the Brahman are discussed in sections 3.1 and 3.2 of the text.

Sections 3.3 and 3.4 describe the need for self-study, reflection of texts read, meditation, etc., as steps while one makes progress and the role of sannyasa (monk, mendicant) in the pursuit of spiritual knowledge.

====&quot;Upasana&quot; (worship, meditation)====
The third &quot;pada&quot;, states George Thibaut, opens a new section and theme in chapter 3 of the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot;, describing how &quot;the individual soul is enabled by meditation on Brahman to obtain final release,&quot; and harmonising the different Upanishadic views on this. The Upanishads describe many &quot;upasanas&quot; on Brahman, with considerable similarities, but also with differences, due to the variations in transmission in the different Vedic schools. The Brahma-sutra, in &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; of third and fourth pada, states Thibaut, assert that there is no contradiction in these teachings and that &quot;the different Upanishads have to be viewed as teaching the same matter, and therefore the ideas must be combined in one meditation&quot;.

The most referred to texts in these sections are the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Chandogya Upanishad, the Kaushitaki Upanishad, the Katha Upanishad, and the non-Upanishadic parts of Shatapatha Brahmana and &quot;Aitereya Aranyaka&quot;. The topic of meditation, state the Brahma-sutras, is the spiritual knowledge of Brahman; the object of this knowledge, states Thibaut, is &quot;Brahman viewed as the inner Self of all&quot;.

While &quot;upasana&quot; may be regarded as a kind of meditation, it is more than &quot;dhyana&quot; or sitting in meditation; it is a continuous practice of &quot;constant remembrance&quot; of Brahman or the Divine throughout the day, as the culmination of a life of spiritual development.

The Brahma Sutras, in addition to recommending meditation, suggest that rituals and rites are unnecessary because it is knowledge that achieves the purpose.

In sutras 3.4.26 and 3.4.27, the text adds that rituals, however, can spiritually prepare a mind, remove impurities within, empower calmness and distractions from sensory pursuits, and therefore assist in its ability to meditate and gain the ultimate knowledge. The text also discusses, in sutras 3.4.28 to 3.4.31 whether there are restrictions on food (meat) one can ingest, during the spiritual journey. The sutras, translates Thibaut, derive from the Vedic texts that there is &quot;a prohibition of doing harm to any living creature&quot;, however, the scriptures state, &quot;only in danger of life, in cases of highest need, food of any kind is permitted to be eaten&quot;.

The last three sutras of the chapter 3 assert that a person, pursuing means to spiritual knowledge, should seek a childlike state of innocence, a psychological state that is free of anger, self-centeredness, pride and arrogance. The text declares that according to the Vedic literature knowledge is possible in this life, that one is one&#x27;s own obstruction in this journey, that liberation and freedom is the fruit of knowledge.

===Chapter 4: The benefits of spiritual knowledge===
Fourth chapter (&quot;Phala&quot;: the result): talks of the state that is achieved in final emancipation. This is the shortest chapter with 78 sutras and 38 adhikaranas. The last chapter contains fourteen &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; in its first &quot;Pada&quot;, eleven in second, six in third, and seven &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; in the fourth. The last chapter of the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; discusses the need and fruits of self-knowledge, the state of freedom and liberation.

The opening sutras of chapter 4 continue the discussion of meditation as means to knowledge, with sutra 4.1.3 summarizing it to be the state where the person accepts, &quot;I am Brahman, not another being&quot; (Adi Shankara), as &quot;Thou indeed I am, O holy divinity, and I indeed thou art, O holy divinity&quot; (Jabalas), and &quot;God is to be contemplated as the Self&quot; and the individual is as the body of God (Ramanuja).

The liberated soul, asserts the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot;, is of the nature of Brahman, with inner power and knowledge, free from evil, free from grief, free from suffering, one of bliss and &quot;for such there is freedom in all worlds&quot;.

==Commentaries==
Numerous commentaries have been written on the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; text, but many such as that of Bodhayana, Upavarsa, and eighteen out of twenty one mentioned by Narayana in &quot;Madhvavijaya-bhava-prakashika&quot; are considered lost. Of the surviving commentaries, the earliest extant one is by Adi Shankara.

The diversity of &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; commentaries by various sub-schools of Hinduism (see table) attests to the central importance of the Upanishads, that the text summarizes.

===Exegesis===
The sutras in the text can be, and have been read in different ways. Some commentators read each line separately, while others sometimes read two as one treating some sutras as contextually connected. Creative readers have read the last word of a sutra as the starting word for the next, some treat a given verse as &quot;Purva-paksha&quot; (opposing viewpoint) while others read the same verse as &quot;Siddhanta&quot; (proposed doctrine, or conclusion). For example, states Gregory Darling, Adi Shankara in his commentary on sutra 4.3.14 considers &quot;Saguna&quot; Brahman mentioned therein as &quot;Purva-paksha&quot;, but acknowledges that some scholars interpret this sutra as a &quot;Siddhanta&quot;. Another example is Shanakra&#x27;s interpretation of a set of sutras (2.3.19-28) as reflective of the &quot;Purva-paksha&quot; and Ramanuja&#x27;s taking the same set of sutras to be reflective of the &quot;Siddhanta&quot;. Shankara argues that the description of the individual self (&quot;jiva&quot;) as atomic in size in these sutras marks the &quot;Purva-paksha&quot;, whereas Ramanuja takes it to be the &quot;Siddhanta.&quot; A point of disagreement between commentators concerns where to divide the text into &quot;Adhikaranas&quot;. Although there is a clear division of &quot;Adhyayas&quot; and &quot;Padas&quot; in the text, no division of &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; is universally affirmed, leading to disagreements about how the sutras in each &quot;Adhikaranas&quot; should be divided&quot;.&quot;

Another aspect of the sutra text that leads to variance in exegeses is that words in the sutras can mean different things. In sutra 2.3.15, the word &quot;antarā&quot; is used, which would mean both &quot;without&quot; and &quot;in the midst&quot;. Shankara, Ramanuja, and Nimbarka agree that the word means &quot;in the midst&quot;, but Madhva argues that the word must mean &quot;without&quot;. It is very likely that the interpretations given by Shankara, Ramanuja, Nimbarka, and Madhva did not originate out of nowhere, and their key elements most probably existed even before the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; themselves were written. It is extremely difficult to determine which of the commentators&#x27; interpretations are actually faithful to the original, and there is a possibility that the author of the &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; did not have a philosophical system in mind that Shankara, Ramanuja, Nimbarka, Madhva, and their successors have expressed.

===Translations===
The &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; has been translated into German by Paul Deussen, and in English by George Thibaut. The Thibaut translation is, state De Bary and Embree, &quot;probably the best complete translation in English&quot;. Vinayak Sakaram Ghate of Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute has done a comparative analysis of the Brahma Sutra commentaries of Nimbarka, Ramanuja, Vallabha, Adi Shankara and Madhvacharya in detail and has written the conclusion that Nimbarka&#x27;s and Ramanuja&#x27;s balanced commentaries give the closest meaning of the Brahma Sutras taking into account of both kinds of Sutras, those which speak of oneness and those which speak of difference.

==Influence==
The impact of &quot;Brahma Sūtras&quot; text on Vedanta, and in turn Hinduism, has been historic and central:

<doc id="1102641" wikidata="Q4040144" url="?curid=1102641" title="HMS London (1840)">
<text>HMS &quot;London&quot; was a two-decker 90-gun second-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 28 September 1840 at Chatham Dockyard. In 1854 she took part in the bombardment of the Konstantin Battery at Sevastopol during the Crimean War, where she sustained damage. In 1858 she was converted to screw propulsion, and reduced to 72 guns.

By 1873, she was a hulk, serving as a depot ship in Zanzibar Bay, off the east coast of Africa, but in March 1878 she was recommissioned to assist in the suppression of the slave trade in the area, serving as a central repair depot, hospital and storage ship for many smaller steam screw boats. At this time there were Africans from West Africa (Kroomen or Krumen) and East Africa (Seedies or Sidis) serving on board. There were also Zanzibari and Arab interpreters and cooks from Portuguese Goa (India). In 1880 Lieutenant Charles Stewart Smith, an officer on another ship, led patrols which captured seven dhows and 185 enslaved people. In 1883, three years later, Lieutenant Smith was seconded to the post of Vice-Consul, Zanzibar to Sir John Kirk, the British Consul-General.

Captained by Charles J Brownrigg, &quot;London&quot; herself and her crew made several patrols aimed at hindering the slave trade and, on 3 December 1881, caught up with a slave dhow captained by Hindi bin Hattam. This dhow had around 100 enslaved people on board and was transporting them between Pemba and Zanzibar. Captain Brownrigg led a boarding party to release the enslaved people but bin Hattam&#x27;s men then attacked the sailors, killing Brownrigg and some of his party before sailing away. Sir Lloyd William Mathews led a force to Wete on Pemba and, after a short battle, took a mortally wounded bin Hattem (Hindi-bin-Khartoum) prisoner before returning to Zanzibar.

In late 1881, while the vessel was at Zanzibar, it suffered damage of a nature such that repairs were urgently required. The type of wood desired to make the repairs was teak, which &quot;could not readily be procured in the open market.&quot; The Sultan was, however, known to have a store of the desired timber and so he was requested to assist with supplying it. This he did and the repairs done. However, the Sultan refused to accept any payment for the supplies. In the eyes of the commander of HMS &quot;London&quot;, it put the British Royal Navy &quot;in an awkward position&quot; because it would be very difficult to make similar requests in the future.

The final entry in the ship&#x27;s log is dated 22 January 1883. Captain Luxmoore writes &quot;Paid ship off&quot; &quot;Sent ships company to transport in passage to England&quot;. In 1884 she was sold and broken up.

<text>HMAS &quot;Perth&quot; (FFH 157) is an &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigate of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The last ship of the class to be completed, she was built by Tenix Defence and commissioned into the RAN in 2006. In 2007, &quot;Perth&quot; became the first major warship of the RAN to be commanded by a woman. During 2010 and 2011, the frigate was used as the testbed for a major upgrade to the &quot;Anzac&quot; class&#x27; ability to defend themselves from anti-ship missiles.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Anzac&quot; class originated from RAN plans to replace the six River-class destroyer escorts with a mid-capability patrol frigate. The Australian shipbuilding industry was thought to be incapable of warship design, so the RAN decided to take a proven foreign design and modify it. Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships&#x27; requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987. Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted. By August 1987, the tenders were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss&#x27;s MEKO 200 design, the M class (later &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; class) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders. In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne-based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defence) would build the modified MEKO 200 design. The Australians ordered eight ships, while New Zealand ordered two, with an unexercised option for two more.

The &quot;Anzac&quot;s are based on Blohm + Voss&#x27; MEKO 200 PN (or &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot; class) frigates, modified to meet Australian and New Zealand specifications and maximise the use of locally built equipment. Each frigate has a full load displacement. The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a full load draught of . A Combined Diesel or Gas (CODOG) propulsion machinery layout is used, with a single, General Electric LM2500-30 gas turbine and two MTU 12V1163 TB83 diesel engines driving the ship&#x27;s two controllable-pitch propellers. Maximum speed is , and maximum range is over at ; about 50% greater than other MEKO 200 designs.
As designed, the main armament for the frigate is a 5-inch 54 calibre Mark 45 gun, supplemented by an eight-cell Mark 41 vertical launch system (for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow or RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles), two machine guns, and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets (initially firing Mark 46 torpedoes, but later upgraded to use the MU90 Impact torpedo). They were also designed for but not with a close-in weapons system (two Mini Typhoons fitted when required from 2005 onwards), two quad-canister Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers (which were installed across the RAN vessels from 2005 onwards), and a second Mark 41 launcher (which has not been added). The Australian &quot;Anzac&quot;s use a Sikorsky S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter; plans to replace them with Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprites were cancelled in 2008 due to ongoing problems.

&quot;Perth&quot; was laid down at Williamstown, Victoria, on 24 July 2003. The ship was assembled from six hull modules and six superstructure modules; the superstructure modules were fabricated in Whangarei, New Zealand, and hull modules were built at both Williamstown and Newcastle, New South Wales, with final integration at Williamstown. She was launched on 20 March 2004, and commissioned into the RAN on 26 August 2006 in Fremantle, Western Australia (the closest port to the ship&#x27;s namesake city). &quot;Perth&quot; was the final &quot;Anzac&quot;-class ship to be constructed.

==Operational history==
In mid-2007, Commander Michele Miller became the first woman to command a major RAN warship when she assumed command of &quot;Perth&quot;.

On 18 January 2010, &quot;Perth&quot; docked at the Australian Marine Complex in Henderson, Western Australia to be modified under the Anti-Ship Missile Defence Project. The upgrade, intended to improve the class&#x27; anti-ship self-defence capability, included the fitting of CEA Technologies&#x27; CEAFAR and CEAMOUNT phased array radars, a Vampir NG Infrared Search and Track system, and Sharpeye Navigational Radar Systems, along with improvements to the operations room equipment and layout. Both of the frigate&#x27;s masts were replaced; the top of the aft mast now sits at , making &quot;Perth&quot; the second-tallest ship in the RAN. Because of the added equipment, additional ballast was added to improve the frigate&#x27;s stability, and the ship&#x27;s quarterdeck was enclosed. The additional weight brought the ship&#x27;s full load displacement to 3,810 tons. After the upgrade was completed in October 2010, &quot;Perth&quot; was used to trial the modifications before they were rolled out to the rest of the Australian &quot;Anzac&quot;s: alongside and harbour trials at were successfully completed in February 2011, and full sea trials began on 21 February. On 27 April, the frigate sailed to the east coast of Australia to continue trials, with further testing to occur at the United States Navy&#x27;s Pacific Missile Range Facility, then during Exercise Talisman Sabre. Testing was completed by July 2011, and the rollout of the ASMD upgrade across the class was approved in November 2011.

In October 2013, &quot;Perth&quot; participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney.

During February and March 2015, an MH-60R Seahawk Romeo helicopter from 725 Squadron RAN was embarked aboard &quot;Perth&quot; for at-sea trials of the new helicopter.

In June 2016 &quot;Perth&quot; was deployed to the Middle East Region on &quot;Operation Manitou&quot; as part of the coalition taskforce to stop criminal activities such as piracy and drug trafficking. &quot;Perth&quot; was the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s 63rd ship rotation since 1991.

In 2017 the Navy decided to place &quot;Perth&quot; in &#x27;extended readiness&#x27; from December that year as it was unable to crew the vessel. From late 2018, &quot;Perth&quot; underwent the Anzac-class frigate Midlife Capability Assurance Program (AMCAP) upgrade at the Australian Marine Complex, Henderson, Western Australia. In 2019 it was reported that &quot;Perth&quot; would not re-enter service until 2021 as the Navy still did not have enough sailors to form a crew. The crew of were transferred to &quot;Perth&quot; in early 2021, and the ship was scheduled to begin sea trials following the upgrades in June that year.

<text>Stephen Girard (born Étienne Girard; May 20, 1750 – December 26, 1831) was a French-born American banker and philanthropist. Born in Bordeaux, Girard subsequently immigrated to the Thirteen Colonies where he established himself in the American banking industry. During the War of 1812, Girard single-handedly saved the federal government of the United States from bankruptcy by personally financing the American war effort. 

Eventually accumulating a large estate which included a slave plantation in Louisiana, a 2007 article in &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; estimated that he was the fourth-richest American in history. Having no children, Girard devoted much of his fortune to philanthropy, in particular the education and welfare of orphans, and his estate continues to fund philanthropic endeavors in the present day.

==Early life==
Girard was born in Bordeaux, France on May 20, 1750, the son of a sea captain. He lost the sight in his right eye at the age of eight and had little education. In 1760, he travelled to the colony of New York as a cabin boy and stayed there, working in the coastal trader system along the east coast and as far south as the Caribbean. He was licensed as a captain in 1773, visited New York in 1774, and with the assistance of a New York merchant began to trade to and from New Orleans and Port au Prince. In May 1776, after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Girard sailed into the port of Philadelphia to avoid a group of Royal Navy warships and settled there, running a grocery and liquor shop. In 1783, Stephen&#x27;s brother John Girard left him with a slave, a woman in her twenties named Hannah, during a visit from Saint-Domingue.:89-91 Pennsylvania&#x27;s 1780 Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery had many loopholes and although it was amended throughout Girard&#x27;s life, Hannah remained his slave until his death in 1831. An 1828 listing of taxable inhabitants reported that she was the only enslaved person in Philadelphia at that time.

By 1790, Girard had a fortune of $6,000 and a small fleet of trading vessels. In 1791, his merchantmen in the former colony of Saint-Domingue were involved in salvaging goods owned by French planters during the Haitian Revolution. He was left with $10,000 of goods stowed on his ships, the owners of which were likely massacred. Because the owners of the goods were not found, Girard added the goods to his possessions. He also participated in the Old China Trade, financing voyages to Canton. These voyages profited Girard through the sale of legitimate goods as well as opium, which was smuggled into China. Girard&#x27;s business ventures in China ended in 1824 following an incident between one of his ships, the &quot;Terranova&quot;, and Chinese authorities.

==Marriage==
In 1776, Girard met Mary Lum, a Philadelphia native nine years his junior. They married soon afterwards, and Girard purchased a home at 211 Mill Street in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey. Mary was the daughter of John Lum, a shipbuilder who died three months before the marriage. In 1778 Girard became a resident of Pennsylvania. By 1785 Mary had begun succumbing to sudden, erratic emotional outbursts. Mental instability and violent rages ensued, leading to a diagnosis of incurable mental instability. Though Girard was initially devastated, by 1787 he took a mistress, Sally Bickham. In August 1790 Girard committed his wife to the Pennsylvania Hospital (today part of the University of Pennsylvania) as an incurable lunatic, providing her every luxury for comfort. During this time she gave birth to a girl whose sire is not entirely certain. The child, baptized with the name Mary, died a few months later while under the care of Mrs. John Hatcher, who had been hired by Girard as a nurse. Girard spent the remainder of his life with mistresses.

==Yellow fever==
In 1793, there was an outbreak of yellow fever in Philadelphia. Although many other well-to-do citizens chose to leave the city, Girard stayed to care for the sick and dying. He supervised the conversion of a mansion outside the city limits into a hospital and recruited volunteers to nurse victims, and personally cared for patients. For his efforts, Girard was feted as a hero after the outbreak subsided. Again during the yellow fever epidemic of 1797-1798 he took the lead in relieving the poor and caring for the sick.

==Girard&#x27;s Bank==
After the charter for the First Bank of the United States expired in 1811, Girard purchased most of its stock and its facilities on South Third Street in Philadelphia, and reestablished it under his direct personal ownership. He hired George Simpson, the cashier of the First Bank, as cashier of the new bank, and with seven other employees opened for business on May 18, 1812. He allowed the Trustees of the First Bank of the United States to use some offices and space in the vaults to continue the process of winding down the affairs of the closed bank at a very nominal rent. Although Pennsylvania law prohibited an association of individuals from banking without a charter, it made no such prohibition on a single individual doing so. Philadelphia banks balked at accepting the notes that Girard issued on his personal credit and lobbied the state to force him to incorporate, without success.

Girard&#x27;s Bank was the principal source of government credit during the War of 1812, worth an outstanding $1 million. Towards the end of the war, when the financial credit of the U.S. government was at its lowest, Girard placed nearly all of his personal resources at the disposal of the government and underwrote up to 95 percent of the war loan issue, which enabled the United States to carry on the war. After the war, he became a large stockholder in and one of the directors of the Second Bank of the United States.

Girard&#x27;s Bank ceased operations upon his death in 1831, but Philadelphia businessmen, eager to cash in on Girard&#x27;s reputation, opened a bank called the Girard Trust Company, and later Girard Bank. It merged with Mellon Bank in 1983, and was largely sold to Citizens Bank two decades later. Its monumental headquarters building still stands at Broad and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia.

==Death, will and legacy==

On December 22, 1830, Stephen Girard was seriously injured while crossing the street near Second and Market Streets in Philadelphia. He was knocked down by a horse and wagon, and one of its wheels ran over the left side of his face, lacerating his cheek and ear as well as damaging his good (left) eye. Despite his advanced age of 80 years old, he got up unassisted and returned to his nearby home, where a doctor dressed his wound. He threw himself back into his banking business, although he remained out of sight for two months. Nevertheless, Girard never fully recovered and he died on December 26, 1831. He was buried in the vault he built for his nephew in the Holy Trinity Catholic cemetery, then at Sixth and Spruce Streets. Twenty years later, his remains were re-interred in the Founder&#x27;s Hall vestibule at Girard College behind a statue by Nicholas Gevelot, a French sculptor living in Philadelphia.

At the time of his death, Girard was the wealthiest man in America. Michael Klepper and Robert Gunther, in their book &quot;The Wealthy 100&quot;, posit that, with adjustment for inflation, Girard was the fifth-wealthiest American of all time as of 1996, behind John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and John Jacob Astor. He was worth around $7.5 million at the time of his death, equal to $255.9 million today.

Girard was an atheist throughout his life, and he included his views on religion in his last testament.

Girard&#x27;s will was contested by his family in France but was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in a landmark case, &quot;Vidal et al. vs Girard&#x27;s Executors&quot;, 43 U.S. 127 (1844).

He bequeathed nearly his entire fortune to charitable and municipal institutions of Philadelphia and New Orleans, including an estimated $6 million (approximately $ in ) for establishing a boarding school for &quot;poor, male, white orphans&quot; in Philadelphia, primarily those who were the children of coal miners, which opened as Girard College in 1848.

Girard also made a bequest of $10,000 to the public schools of Philadelphia, with the income from its investment to be used for the purchase of books for the school libraries, and a bequest for the establishment of funds to procure medals for deserving pupils.

To his friend the judge Henry Bree, he bequeathed the plantation he owned in Louisiana, including thirty slaves.

When Girard&#x27;s former counting house on 22 North Water Street near the corner of Front and Market Streets was demolished in 1907, a set of underground cells were uncovered. At the time of discovery, it was alleged that the cells were used to incarcerate slaves.

Although no longer in common use, people used to use the phrase &quot;Stephen Girard work&quot; or &quot;Stephen Girard job&quot; to refer to useless work. Girard did not believe in idleness, and in a time when people were loath to take handouts, he instead would pay for useless work. An example is paying workers to move bricks from one side of a yard to another (and then back again).

<doc id="1102649" wikidata="Q522464" url="?curid=1102649" title="Laccolith">
<text>A laccolith is a body of intrusive rock with a dome-shaped upper surface and a level base, fed by a conduit from below. A laccolith forms when magma (molten rock) rising through the Earth&#x27;s crust begins to spread out horizontally, prying apart the host rock strata. The pressure of the magma is high enough that the overlying strata are forced upward, giving the laccolith its dome-like form.

Over time, erosion can expose the solidified laccolith, which is typically more resistant to weathering than the host rock. The exposed laccolith then forms a hill or mountain. The Henry Mountains of Utah, US, are an example of a mountain range composed of exposed laccoliths. It was here that geologist Grove Karl Gilbert carried out pioneering field work on this type of intrusion. Laccolith mountains have since been identified in many other parts of the world.
==Description==
A laccolith is a type of igneous intrusion, formed when magma forces its way upwards through the Earth&#x27;s crust but cools and solidifies before reaching the surface. Laccoliths are distinguished from other igneous intrusions by their dome-shaped upper surface and level base. They are assumed to be fed by a conduit from below, though this is rarely exposed. When the host rock is volcanic, the laccolith is referred to as a cryptodome. Laccoliths form only at relatively shallow depth in the crust, usually from intermediate composition magma, though laccoliths of all compositions from silica-poor basalt to silica-rich rhyolite are known.

A laccolith forms after an initial sheet-like intrusion has been injected between layers of sedimentary rock. If the intrusion remains limited in size, it forms a sill, in which the strata above and below the intrusion remain parallel to each other and the intrusion remains sheetlike. The intrusion begins to lift and dome the overlying strata only if the radius of the intrusion exceeds a critical radius, which is roughly:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the pressure of the magma, formula_3 is the lithostatic pressure (weight of the overlying rock), formula_4 is the thickness of the overlying rocks, and formula_5 is the shear strength of the overlying rock. For example, in the Henry Mountains of Utah, US, the geologist Grove Karl Gilbert found in 1877 that sills were always less than in area while laccoliths were always greater than 1 square kilometer in area. From this, Gilbert concluded that sills were forerunners of laccoliths. Laccoliths formed from sills only when they became large enough for the pressure of the magma to force the overlying strata to dome upwards. Gilbert also determined that larger laccoliths formed at greater depth. Both laccoliths and sills are classified as &quot;concordant&quot; intrusions, since the bulk of the intrusion does not cut across host rock strata, but intrudes between strata.

More recent study of laccoliths has confirmed Gilbert&#x27;s basic conclusions, while refining the details. Both sills and laccoliths have blunt rather than wedgelike edges, and sills of the Henry Mountains are typically up to thick while laccoliths are up to thick. The periphery of a laccolith may be smooth, but it may also have fingerlike projections consistent with Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the magma pushing along the strata. An example of a fingered laccolith is the Shonkin Sag laccolith in Montana, US. The critical radius for the sill to laccolith transition is now thought to be affected the viscosity of the magma (being greater for less viscous magma) as well as the strength of the host rock. A modern formula for the shape of a laccolith is:
:formula_6

where formula_7 is the height of the laccolith roof, formula_8 is the acceleration of gravity, formula_9 is the elastic modulus of the host rock, formula_10 is the horizontal distance from the center of the laccolith, and formula_11 is the outer radius of the laccolith. Because of their greater thickness, which slows the cooling rate, the rock of laccoliths is usually coarser-grained than the rock of sills.

The growth of laccoliths can take as little as a few months when associated with a single magma injection event, or up to hundreds or thousands of years by multiple magmatic pulses stacking sills on top of each other and deforming the host rock incrementally.

Over time, erosion can form small hills and even mountains around a central peak since the intrusive rock is usually more resistant to weathering than the host rock. Because the emplacement of the laccolith domes up the overlying beds, local topographic relief is increased and erosion is accelerated, so that the overlying beds are eroded away to expose the intrusive cores.

==Etymology==

The term was first applied as &quot;laccolite&quot; by Gilbert after his study of intrusions of diorite in the Henry Mountains of Utah in about 1875. The word &quot;laccolith&quot; was derived in 1875–1880, from Greek &quot;lákko(s)&quot; &#x27;pond&#x27; plus &quot;-lith&quot; &#x27;stone&#x27;.

==Where laccoliths form==
Laccoliths tend to form at relatively shallow depths and in some cases are formed by relatively viscous magmas, such as those that crystallize to diorite, granodiorite, and granite. In those cases cooling underground may take place slowly, giving time for larger crystals to form in the cooling magma. In other cases less viscous magma such as shonkinite may form phenocrysts of augite at depth, then inject through a vertical feeder dike that ends in a laccolith.

Sheet intrusions tend to form perpendicular to the direction of least stress in the country rock they intrude. Thus laccoliths are characteristic of regions where the crust is being compressed and the direction of least stress is vertical, while areas where the crust is in tension are more likely to form dikes, since the direction of least stress is then horizontal. For example, the laccoliths of the Ortiz porphyry belt in New Mexico likely formed during Laramide compression of the region 33 to 36 million years ago. When Laramide compression was later replaced by extension, emplacement of sills and laccoliths was replaced by emplacement of dikes. Dating of the intrusions has helped determine the point in geologic time when compression was replaced with extension.

==Examples==

In addition to the Henry Mountains, laccolith mountains are found on the nearby Colorado Plateau in the La Sal Mountains and Abajo Mountains.

The filled and solidified magma chamber of Torres del Paine (Patagonia) is one of the best exposed laccoliths, built up incrementally by horizontal granitic and mafic magma intrusions over 162 ± 11 thousand years. Horizontal sheeted intrusions were fed by vertical intrusions.

The small Barber Hill syenite-stock laccolith in Charlotte, Vermont, has several volcanic trachyte dikes associated with it. Molybdenite is also visible in outcrops on this exposed laccolith. In Big Bend Ranch State Park, at the southwesternmost visible extent of the Ouachita orogeny, lies the Solitario. It consists of the eroded remains of a laccolith, presumably named for the sense of solitude that observers within the structure might have, due to the partial illusion of endless expanse in all directions.

One of the largest laccoliths in the United States is Pine Valley Mountain in the Pine Valley Mountain Wilderness area near St. George, Utah.

A system of laccoliths is exposed on the Italian island of Elba, which form a &quot;Christmas tree&quot; laccolith system in which a single igneous plumbing system has produced multiple laccoliths at different levels in the crust.

==Problems reconstructing shapes of intrusions==

The original shape of intrusions can be difficult to reconstruct. For instance, Devils Tower in Wyoming and Needle Rock in Colorado were both thought to be volcanic necks, but further study has suggested they are eroded laccoliths. At Devils Tower, intrusion would have had to cool very slowly so as to form the slender pencil-shaped columns of phonolite porphyry seen today. However, erosion has stripped away the overlying and surrounding rock, so it is impossible to reconstruct the original shape of the igneous intrusion, which may or may not be the remnant of a laccolith. At other localities, such as in the Henry Mountains and other isolated mountain ranges of the Colorado Plateau, some intrusions demonstrably have the classic shapes of laccoliths.

==Extraterrestrial laccoliths==

There are many examples of possible laccoliths on the surface of the Moon. Some are centered in impact craters and may form as part of the post-impact evolution of the crater. Others are located along possible faults or fissures. Laccoliths on the Moon are much wider but less thick than those on Earth, due to the Moon&#x27;s lower gravity and more fluid magmatism.

Possible laccoliths have also been identified on Mars, in western Arcadia Planitia.

<text>HMAS &quot;Toowoomba&quot; (FFH 156) is the seventh &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigate of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). She was laid down in 2002 by Tenix Defence and commissioned in 2005.

In 2007, &quot;Toowoomba&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Slipper. Her second deployment to the Middle East occurred during the second half of 2009. As part of this, she became the first RAN vessel to operate with the counter-piracy Combined Task Force 151.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Anzac&quot; class originated from RAN plans to replace the six River-class destroyer escorts with a mid-capability patrol frigate. The Australian shipbuilding industry was thought to be incapable of warship design, so the RAN decided to take a proven foreign design and modify it. Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships&#x27; requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987. Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted. By August 1987, the tenders were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss&#x27;s MEKO 200 design, the M class (later &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; class) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders. In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne-based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defence) would build the modified MEKO 200 design. The Australians ordered eight ships, while New Zealand ordered two, with an unexercised option for two more.
The &quot;Anzac&quot;s are based on Blohm + Voss&#x27; MEKO 200 PN (or &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot;-class) frigates, modified to meet Australian and New Zealand specifications and maximise the use of locally built equipment. Each frigate has a full load displacement. The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a full load draught of . A Combined Diesel or Gas (CODOG) propulsion machinery layout is used, with a single, General Electric LM2500-30 gas turbine and two MTU 12V1163 TB83 diesel engines driving the ship&#x27;s two controllable-pitch propellers. Maximum speed is , and maximum range is over at ; about 50% greater than other MEKO 200 designs. The standard ship&#x27;s company of an &quot;Anzac&quot; consists of 22 officers and 141 sailors.

As designed, the main armament for the frigate is a 5-inch 54 calibre Mark 45 gun, supplemented by an eight-cell Mark 41 vertical launch system (for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow or RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles), two machine guns, and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets (initially firing Mark 46 torpedoes, but later upgraded to use the MU90 Impact torpedo). They were also designed for but not with a close-in weapons system (two Mini Typhoons fitted when required from 2005 onwards), two quad-canister Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers (which were installed across the RAN vessels from 2005 onwards), and a second Mark 41 launcher (which has not been added). The Australian &quot;Anzac&quot;s use a Sikorsky S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter; plans to replace them with Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprites were cancelled in 2008 due to ongoing problems.

&quot;Toowoomba&quot; was laid down at Williamstown, Victoria on 26 July 2002. The ship was assembled from six hull modules and six superstructure modules; the superstructure modules were fabricated in Whangarei, New Zealand, and hull modules were built at both Williamstown and Newcastle, New South Wales, with final integration at Williamstown. She was launched on 16 May 2003 by Judy Blight, and commissioned into the RAN on 8 October 2005.

==Operational history==

&quot;Toowoomba&quot; began her first deployment to the Middle East Area of Operations (MEAO) as part of Operation Slipper on 4 January 2007.

On 18 June 2008, the frigate became the first RAN warship to fire an MU90 Impact anti-submarine torpedo, after they replaced the American Mark 46 anti-submarine torpedoes originally fitted.

In June 2009, &quot;Toowoomba&quot; sailed from Fleet Base West, Western Australia to embark upon the ship&#x27;s second MEAO deployment. In September, the frigate was assigned to Combined Task Force 151 (CTF-151); &quot;Toowoomba&quot; was the first Australian warship to work with CTF-151, a US-led, multinational force tasked with protecting merchant vessels from pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia. &quot;Toowoomba&quot; was assigned to escort merchant shipping and conduct overt patrols in the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC), a shipping lane extending the Gulf of Aden towards the Somali Basin and the Horn of Africa, in support of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1846 and 1851. The frigate also operated with the counter-terrorism Combined Task Force 150 (CTF-150) in the Arabian Sea.

On 20 September 2009, &quot;Toowoomba&quot; responded to a call for assistance from the merchant vessel &quot;BBC Portugal&quot;, and successfully prevented an act of high-seas piracy. A Japanese P-3 Orion aircraft and a naval helicopter from the German frigate &quot;Bremen&quot; provided surveillance support while &quot;Toowoomba&quot; closed in. A boarding party from &quot;Toowoomba&quot; confiscated several weapons from the attackers, including a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, six AK-47 assault rifles, and a G3 assault rifle, before the skiff was directed to leave the IRTC.

&quot;Toowoomba&quot; returned to Fleet Base West on 7 December 2009, having been relieved in the MEAO by . The ship and her company were awarded with a &quot;Certificate for Exceptional Services Rendered to Shipping and Mankind&quot; by the International Maritime Organization in November 2009. The deployment is the subject of &quot;Australian Pirate Patrol&quot;, a four-episode documentary series produced by Prospero Productions, and first aired on the National Geographic Channel on 18 October 2010.

In early April 2013, &quot;Toowoomba&quot; operated with the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Carrier Strike Group Three in the South China Sea.

In late March 2014, &quot;Toowoomba&quot; was pulled from asylum seeker patrols and directed to join the hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, allowing to return to port for replenishment.

&quot;Toowoomba&quot; will be docked in October 2015 to undergo the Anti-Ship Missile Defence (ASMD) upgrade. The upgrade will include the fitting of CEA Technologies&#x27; CEAFAR and CEAMOUNT phased array radars on new masts, a Vampir NG Infrared Search and Track system, and Sharpeye Navigational Radar Systems, along with improvements to the operations room equipment and layout.

In early 2020 she was deployed to the Strait of Hormuz during the 2019 Persian Gulf crisis.

In November 2023 &quot;Toowoomba&quot; operated off Japan as part of Operation Argos, which is Australia&#x27;s contribution to efforts to enforce sanctions against North Korea. Several RAN divers were slightly injured by sonar from a Chinese warship during this deployment, when the sonar was activated close to the Australian frigate while they were removing a fishing net from its propellers.

<doc id="1102657" wikidata="Q4885563" url="?curid=1102657" title="Ben Dunne (businessman, born 1949)">
<text>Bernard Dunne (11 March 1949 – 18 November 2023) was an Irish businessman. Director of his family firm, Dunnes Stores, one of the largest chains of department stores in Ireland, he then owned a chain of fitness centres called Ben Dunne Gyms.

==Early life==
Ben Dunne was born in Cork on 11 March 1949, to Nora Maloney and Ben Dunne, a businessman who founded Dunnes Stores. He was the youngest of six children. Together with his family, he lived at Browningstown Park on the Douglas Road and Ringmahon House on the Mahon peninsula.

== Career ==
Dunne worked for Dunnes Stores, which had been founded by his father, from a young age. He rose to become director of the company, until he was ousted by his family members following controversy in 1992.

===Kidnapping===
On the morning of Friday 16 October 1981, Dunne was on his way to open a new supermarket in Portadown, County Armagh when he was kidnapped by the IRA. Dunne was driving northwards when a car coming in the opposite direction overtook a lorry and blocked the lorry&#x27;s path. The lorry stopped, and Dunne swerved and avoided a collision. Believing an accident had occurred, Dunne stopped and got out of his car to help. The other car reversed towards him, and four men, armed with at least one rifle, got out, surrounded Dunne, put him into the car, and left the scene. Dunne was held for seven days. He was released unharmed in a graveyard in Cullyhanna, County Armagh after his friend and fellow businessman, Patrick Gallagher, paid his £1 million ransom. He initially hid in an open grave, but then, fearing his kidnappers might return and shoot him and fill in the grave, he climbed back out.

===Florida arrest===
In 1992, Dunne was arrested for cocaine possession and soliciting while on a golf holiday in Florida. He was arrested by police after allegedly being found in a hotel room with drugs and a prostitute. His arrest triggered the end of his leadership of Dunnes Stores, as family turmoil led to control falling to his sister Margaret Heffernan and the company paying IR£100 million for Ben Dunne&#x27;s share of the business.

===Political donations controversy===
Dunne was again embroiled in scandal in the mid-1990s when it emerged he had given large amounts of money to a number of Irish politicians, mainly from the Fianna Fáil party including the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. He also gave money to Michael Lowry of Fine Gael. Mr Justice Brian McCracken, sole member of The McCracken Tribunal which was established by the Irish Government in 1997, found that Dunne had knowingly assisted Lowry in evading his tax obligations. The Tribunal said Dunne and Haughey had a &quot;strange and complex&quot; relationship, with Dunne having made at least five payments in the period of November 1987 to December 1991 to Haughey which totalled to 1.3 million Irish pounds.

On 22 March 2011, the Moriarty Tribunal concluded of Ben Dunne&#x27;s dealings with Michael Lowry that &quot;What was contemplated and attempted on the part of Mr. Dunne and Mr. Lowry was profoundly corrupt to a degree that was nothing short of breathtaking&quot;; the report referring to its finding that Lowry sought to influence a rent review of a building part-owned by Dunne.

===Gyms===
Dunne went on to run a chain of fitness centres called Ben Dunne Gyms, located in Dublin and Liverpool. He personally promoted the gyms on radio, using recent Irish advertising legislation which allows direct comparisons to named competitors. Dunne was working on a new health club, to open in Dún Laoghaire in Dublin, but abandoned the project due to complaints from local residents.

In April 2005, Dunne paid £3,000,000 for a site in Motspur Park, New Malden (South London), former home of BBC Football Club and other BBC sports facilities. His intent was to apply for planning permission to build a leisure and fitness centre, but he did not do so. Instead, in February 2008, his company Barkisland Developments Limited submitted a planning application to the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Council for change of use of the sports ground to a cemetery. The application to change the former BBC Sports Ground into a cemetery was withdrawn on 3 October 2008. It had become clear that planning permission was likely to be refused. Objections were lodged by many local residents, sports clubs, Sport England and the Mayor of London.

===BenDunne.com===
In 2009, Dunne established an online marketplace, BenDunne.com, competing with Buy and Sell, DoneDeal and Adverts.ie. Following its soft opening, the new website was affected by glitches and was unable to handle sufficient traffic without going down. Its official launch was cancelled and the website was taken offline to address the problems. It was relaunched in 2010 but failed within a year. Dunne admitted that &quot;The internet is one of my failures. I can&#x27;t work it out. I can&#x27;t get people to advertise on BenDunne.com for nothing and I can&#x27;t get them to pay €3.&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
Ben Dunne was married to Mary, and the couple had a daughter and three sons.

Dunne died in Dubai on 18 November 2023, at the age of 74, of a heart attack.

<doc id="1102662" wikidata="Q7642783" url="?curid=1102662" title="Super Soaker">
<text>Super Soaker is an American brand of recreational water gun that uses manually-pressurized air to shoot water with greater power, range, and accuracy than conventional squirt pistols. The Super Soaker was invented in 1989 by engineer Lonnie Johnson. The prototype combined PVC pipe, acrylic glass, and an empty plastic soda bottle.

Originally sold by Larami and now produced by Hasbro under the Nerf brand, Super Soaker has generated more than $1 billion in total sales. The first Super Soaker went on sale in 1990 and was originally called the Power Drencher. Rebranding the name to Super Soaker occurred in 1991 together with a series of TV advertisements that resulted in two million water guns being sold. Super Soakers were popular for many years—so popular, in fact, that the term &quot;super soaker&quot; is sometimes used generically, to refer to any type of toy pressurized water gun.

== History ==

In 1985 Air Force and NASA engineer Lonnie Johnson conceived of the idea of a pressurized water gun after shooting a powerful stream of water in his bathroom while performing experiments for a new type of refrigeration system. Several months later he built a prototype in his basement, using Plexiglas, PVC pipe, O-ring seals and a two-liter soda bottle for the reservoir. Johnson originally wanted to produce the toy himself, but realized that the costs were out of his reach. He attempted to arrange partnerships with toy companies to bring the product to market, but it was not until 1989 that he found success. While at the American International Toy Fair in New York City he met the vice president of the toy company Larami, who showed interest in the idea.

Johnson built an improved prototype and made a trip to the Larami headquarters in Philadelphia where he made a successful sales pitch. Refinements made with Larami design director William Raucci and engineering consultant Bruce D&#x27;Andrade made its mass production feasible, and the first commercial version of the water gun appeared in stores the following year as the Power Drencher. In 1991 it achieved commercial success under its new name, Super Soaker.

In 1992, Larami was sued for patent infringement by Talk to Me Products, who claimed the Super Soaker was a copy of their American Gladiator water gun, which was patented in 1978. However, Talk to Me Products lost their case as their patent referred to a water gun &quot;having a chamber therein&quot;. The Super Soaker used a water chamber on top of the gun, that was detachable for filling.

The revenue that Johnson received from the Super Soaker licensing provided enough money for him to create Johnson Research &amp; Development Co., Inc.

==Technology==

===Piston pumper===
Piston water guns have been produced for many years. These guns do not have triggers; they are fired simply by pumping. Although this design feature allows them to reload rapidly, piston pumpers tend to have less range and less power than other designs.

===Air pressure with pressurized reservoir===
Originally made popular by the Super Soaker 50, pressurized reservoir systems are still common for small water guns. A water gun using this system is pressurized by air being pumped and compressed into its reservoir. When the trigger is pulled, a valve is opened and the compressed air pushes the water out of the nozzle. 
Super Soaker started with two pressurized reservoir water guns, and has continued to produce them in various shapes and sizes.

===Air pressure with separate chamber===
This is a more powerful air pressure system that was also first introduced by Super Soaker. It is designed so that water is pumped from the reservoir into an empty plastic container. As the water is pumped in, the air sitting inside becomes compressed. When the trigger is pulled, the valve opens and the compressed air forces the water out. The brand first used separate air pressure in 1991 on the Super Soaker 100 and has since used the technology in many other water guns.

===Spring-powered===
Super Soaker has made a few spring-powered water guns. They first made the Quick Blast in 2008. The Quick Blast was a triggerless gun which functioned similarly to piston pumpers, but had a spring-loaded piston inside. The Quick Blast had a firing valve, which automatically opened once a certain pressure was reached. The spring would then push the water out the nozzle.

The Super Soaker Shot Blast, released in 2010, used a system nearly identical to the Quick Blast with different styling.

In 2013, Super Soaker produced the Flash Blast. While this blaster was spring-powered, this pistol-sized blaster used a system different from the previous two. Its slide was cocked back once. Then the trigger was pulled, firing a short stream of water. Function of this gun is similar to Nerf guns.

===Motorized===

Super Soaker later made many motorized water guns. In 2011, they released the Thunderstorm, which used an electric pump to push water directly out the nozzle. In 2012, Super Soaker made two motorized water guns: The Lightningstorm, a reproduction of the Thunderstorm with added accessories, and the Electrostorm, a smaller motorized gun. Each required four AA batteries to run.

===CPS (Constant Pressure System)===

The Constant Pressure System is the most powerful system used by Super Soaker. The user pumps water from the reservoir into a rubber bladder, which expands as more water is forced into it. The stretched rubber exerts a constant pressure on the water, giving the blaster a thick and constant stream throughout the entire shot. In most older models, the resulting blast is forceful enough that recoil can be felt.

Hasbro has implemented the Constant Pressure System in Super Soaker blasters a number of times since completing the takeover of Larami Corp in 2002. The most recent implementation was in the 2011 &#x27;Hydro Cannon&#x27;, while the largest post-takeover pressure chamber (at 900ml) is found in the 2007 &#x27;HydroBlitz&#x27; blaster.

==Original series models of Super Soakers==
The following are the original models of Super Soaker guns:
;Super Soaker 10 : Weighing less than three ounces, the SS10 was a sub-compact, pistol-type model that was easily concealable due to its small size (56 mL tank volume, model year 1993)
;Super Soaker 20 : The SS20 was a pistol-type model which came with an either a rear-mounted or a grip-mounted pump. (115 mL tank volume, model year 1992)
;Super Soaker 25 : Designed with the grip-mounted pump, the SS25 came with a belt and additional, surplus water tank. (177 mL tank volume, model year 1992)
;Super Soaker 30 : The original pistol-sized gun, the SS30 was released with the very first models in 1991. While only slightly heavier than the SS20, it holds more than twice the water in its reservoir. (265 mL tank volume, model year 1991)
;Super Soaker 40 : With a design similar to that of the classic SS50, the SS40 possessed somewhat more compact size dimensions. While it also came with a significantly smaller water reservoir, the SS40 was a later model of more durable construction and was touted on its accompanying packaging as &quot;the most powerful watergun ever!&quot; (490 mL tank volume, model year 1993)
;Super Soaker 50 : The original mid-size weapon, the SS50 was a best-selling model. Known for its impressive range due to its novel air pressure system, the SS50 has become a cultural icon. In 2015, the SS50 was the model exemplified when the Super Soaker brand was nominated for the National Toy Hall of Fame. (730 mL tank volume, model year 1991)
;Super Soaker MDS: An acronym for &quot;Multi-directional system&quot;, and the first of the &quot;gimmick&quot; blasters, the MDS had a nozzle that could be turned at angles independently of the gun itself. This was advertised as being useful for firing around corners. It was also slightly larger than the SS 50, and made of slightly more modern and durable construction like the SS 40. Like the SS100, it has a separate pressure reservoir.
;Super Soaker 60 : The SS60 was, in effect, a repainted MDS but with the MDS gimmick removed. This made it a cheaper, lighter alternative to the SS 100
;Super Soaker 100 : Befitting its triple-digit number designation, this larger-sized weapon was the biggest Super Soaker until the release of the SS200. It came with a weight and tank reservoir double that of most mid-sized models, and was accordingly known for its range and capacity (1500 mL tank volume, model year 1991). It was the first soaker to have a separate pressure chamber.
;Super Soaker 200 : The biggest and heaviest of all the original weapons until the release of the SS300, the Super Soaker 200 came with a carry-strap to increase its ergonomics. This model also came with dual full-size water tanks, a large pressure chamber, and multiple, adjustable nozzle settings. (2050 mL tank volume, model year 1992)
;Super Soaker 300 : Armed with three air-pressured firing chambers and a large 6.5 L tank, the backpack-fed Super Soaker 300 came with an appropriately wider nozzle-opening for increased output. While the model had some weight and durability issues, it possessed the ability to outclass all other models, particularly in terms of sheer water volume (6500 mL tank volume, model year 1993). Larami would not make another backpack soaker until the CPS 3000.

===Super Soaker XP series===

Unlike the classic super soaker series or the CPS series, the XP (&quot;eXtra Power&quot;) series did not have a linear relationship between the model number and the size and power of the gun. It also coexisted with the Classic series for a number of years before replacing them. Some unsuccessful concepts, such as quick-twist tanks, were experimented with and abandoned during this transition period. By the time the Classic series had been fully phased out in 1996, the XP series had settled on the following lineup:

;XP 15 : As a micropistol and the smallest XP soaker ever made, this was roughly equivalent to the SS 10
;XP 35 : As a light rifle, this arguably filled the same role as the former SS 30
;XP 65 : As a medium rifle, this was the effective replacement for the SS 50
;XP 105: As a heavy rifle, and as the lightest one still in production with a separate pressure reservoir, this effectively replaced the SS 100
;XXP 175 : Featuring two tanks and two barrels, and being the second-largest blaster in the lineup, this was the successor to the SS 200
;XXP 275 : Despite being a single-piece blaster, this inherited many design principles from the SS 300, such as the fact that it was fired by pulling a lever on top of the barrel rather than by pulling a trigger.

These were replaced every two years by successive generations of models until finally the XP series itself was replaced by the Max-D series.

===Super Soaker CPS series===

The &quot;Super Soaker CPS 2000&quot; is a Constant Pressure System (CPS) class water gun released in 1996 by Larami. It was the first model in the CPS line, which initially included only a single blaster. While a fearsome sight, it was often acknowledged as being overpowered, depleting its pressure chamber too quickly, and needing pumping too frequently. A second version of the CPS 2000 was released shortly after, though Larami did not announce or publicly acknowledge any changes.

After two years, the CPS 2000 was discontinued, and four new CPS blasters were launched:

;CPS 1000: The molded casing made this appear to have only a single, spherical pressure reservoir
;CPS 1500: The molded casing made this appear to have two spherical pressure reservoirs
;CPS 2500: By far the most similar in appearance to the CPS 2000, but with an adjustable nozzle for more moderate output and longer-lasting shots, this was once said by Lonnie Johnson to be his favorite Super Soaker model
;CPS 3000: The first backpack blaster since the SS 300, and the second one ever.

After two more years, those models were replaced by the CPS 1200, 1700, 2700, and 3200. After two more years, the final CPS models were the 2100 and 4100.

==Awards==
In 2011, the Nerf Super Soaker Shot Blast was awarded &quot;Outdoor Toy of the Year&quot; at the 11th Annual Toy of the Year Awards, which is held at the American International Toy Fair in New York City.

In 2015, Super Soaker was inducted to National Toy Hall of Fame.

==Legal issues==
In 2010, Buzz Bee Toys was successfully sued by Hasbro for patent infringement. Hasbro claimed that Buzz Bee Toys infringed on a patent related to its &quot;Super Soaker water toy.&quot; Although it is unknown exactly what the dispute was over, it is likely that Hasbro was suing for the Water Warriors Hydro-Power water guns, which were becoming too similar to Super Soaker&#x27;s Constant Pressure System. Since then, the Water Warriors line has not contained a single Hydro-Power water gun.

In November 2013, Lonnie Johnson and his company Johnson Research and Development Co. were awarded nearly US$73 million following a dispute with Hasbro over underpaid royalties from 2007 to 2012.

<text>HMAS &quot;Warramunga&quot; (FFH 152) is an &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigate of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). One of ten frigates built for the Australian and New Zealand navies, &quot;Warramunga&quot; was laid down by Tenix Defence in 1997 and commissioned in 2001. During her career, the frigate has operated in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Catalyst, and undertaken anti-piracy operations off Somalia. &quot;Warramunga&quot; underwent the Anti-Ship Missile Defence (ASMD) upgrade during 2014. She is active as of October 2022.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Anzac&quot; class originated from RAN plans to replace the six River-class destroyer escorts with a mid-capability patrol frigate. The Australian shipbuilding industry was thought to be incapable of warship design, so the RAN decided to take a proven foreign design and modify it. Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships&#x27; requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987. Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted. By August 1987, the tenders were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss&#x27;s MEKO 200 design, the M class (later &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; class) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders. In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne-based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defence) would build the modified MEKO 200 design. The Australians ordered eight ships, while New Zealand ordered two, with an unexercised option for two more.

The &quot;Anzac&quot;s are based on Blohm + Voss&#x27; MEKO 200 PN (or &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot; class) frigates, modified to meet Australian and New Zealand specifications and maximise the use of locally built equipment. Each frigate has a full load displacement. The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a full load draught of . A Combined Diesel or Gas (CODOG) propulsion machinery layout is used, with a single, General Electric LM2500-30 gas turbine and two MTU 12V1163 TB83 diesel engines driving the ship&#x27;s two controllable-pitch propellers. Maximum speed is , and maximum range is over at ; about 50% greater than other MEKO 200 designs. The standard ship&#x27;s company of an &quot;Anzac&quot; consists of 22 officers and 141 sailors.

As designed, the main armament for the frigate is a 5-inch 54 calibre Mark 45 gun, supplemented by an eight-cell Mark 41 vertical launch system (for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow or RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles), two machine guns, and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets (initially firing Mark 46 torpedoes, but later upgraded to use the MU90 Impact torpedo). They were also designed for but not with a close-in weapons system (two Mini Typhoons fitted when required from 2005 onwards), two quad-canister Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers (which were installed across the RAN vessels from 2005 onwards), and a second Mark 41 launcher (which has not been added). The Australian &quot;Anzac&quot;s use a Sikorsky S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter; plans to replace them with Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprites were cancelled in 2008 due to ongoing problems.

&quot;Warramunga&quot; was laid down at Williamstown, Victoria on 26 July 1997. The ship was assembled from six hull modules and six superstructure modules; the superstructure modules were fabricated in Whangarei, New Zealand, and hull modules were built at both Williamstown and Newcastle, New South Wales, with final integration at Williamstown. She was launched on 23 May 1998, and commissioned into the RAN on 31 March 2001. On commissioning, the ship was assigned to Fleet Base West. Had the New Zealand government exercised their option for two more frigates, &quot;Warramunga&quot; was one of the ships that would have been designated for the RNZN.

==Operational history==

On 31 July 2006, &quot;Warramunga&quot; departed Fleet Base West for her first deployment to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Catalyst, taking over duties from . While on station in the Gulf, &quot;Warramunga&quot; conducted 150 boardings and security patrols, 320 flying hours were logged by her embarked Seahawk helicopter, and 450 investigative queries of merchant vessels were made. &quot;Warramunga&quot; returned to Fremantle on 2 February 2007 after 186 days at sea.

On 29 May 2009, it was announced that &quot;Warramunga&quot; would be re-tasked with protecting civilian vessels from piracy in Somali waters. The ship was assigned to Combined Task Force 151, which was tasked with preventing pirate attacks on commercial vessels in the shipping lanes off the Horn of Africa and Somalia.

During July and August 2010, &quot;Warramunga&quot; was one of three RAN ships to participate in the RIMPAC 2010 multinational exercise. During RIMPAC, the frigate participated in the sinking of the decommissioned amphibious assault ship , firing several rounds from her main gun.

&quot;Warramunga&quot; was the fourth ship of the class to undergo the Anti-Ship Missile Defence (ASMD) upgrade. The upgrade occurred across 2014 and early 2015, the upgrade included the fitting of CEA Technologies&#x27; CEAFAR and CEAMOUNT phased array radars, on new masts, a Vampir NG Infrared Search and Track system, and Sharpeye Navigational Radar Systems, along with improvements to the operations room equipment and layout. As well as the ASMD upgrade, &quot;Warramunga&quot; was the first ship of the RAN to be painted with the polysiloxane-based Haze Grey paint, which has greater durability and infrared-reflection capabilities than the Storm Grey polyurethane paint used for the previous 60 years. A new ship&#x27;s company (that of sister ship , which was docked for upgrading) was assigned on 31 March 2015, and the ship was relaunched on 8 April. On reentering service, the ship&#x27;s homeport was changed to Fleet Base East, where she arrived on 2 September.

In November 2017, &quot;Warramunga&quot; deployed to the Middle East as part of a combined Australian and Canadian task force. The ship carried out patrol activities in the Arabian Sea until late May 2018, intercepting and boarding 13 vessels suspected of drug trafficking. A total of 28 tonnes of heroin and hashish were seized by &quot;Warramunga&quot;″s crew during these operations.

&quot;Warramunga&quot; participated in RIMPAC 2022.

On 7 April 2024, &quot;Warramunga&quot; conducted a joint patrol in the South China Sea with BRP Antonio Luna and BRP Valentin Diaz of the Philippine Navy, USS Mobile of the US Navy, and JS Akebono of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. This marked the first multinational patrol between the nations.

<text>HMAS &quot;Ballarat&quot; (FFH 155) is an &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigate of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The frigate was laid down in 2000 and commissioned into the RAN in mid-2004. Since entering service, &quot;Ballarat&quot; has been involved in border protection as part of Operation Relex II, was deployed to the Gulf for Operation Catalyst, and was one of the two ships involved in the Operation Northern Trident 2009 round-the-world voyage. &quot;Ballarat&quot; has undergone the Anti-Ship Missile Defence (ASMD) upgrade, completing in 2015.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Anzac&quot; class originated from RAN plans to replace the six River-class destroyer escorts with a mid-capability patrol frigate. The Australian shipbuilding industry was thought to be incapable of warship design, so the RAN decided to take a proven foreign design and modify it. Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships&#x27; requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987. Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted. By August 1987, the tenders were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss&#x27;s MEKO 200 design, the M class (later &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; class) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders. In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne-based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defence) would build the modified MEKO 200 design. The Australians ordered eight ships, while New Zealand ordered two, with an unexercised option for two more.
The &quot;Anzac&quot;s are based on Blohm + Voss&#x27; MEKO 200 PN (or &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot;-class) frigates, modified to meet Australian and New Zealand specifications and maximise the use of locally built equipment. Each frigate has a full load displacement. The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a full load draught of . A Combined Diesel or Gas (CODOG) propulsion machinery layout is used, with a single, General Electric LM2500-30 gas turbine and two MTU 12V1163 TB83 diesel engines driving the ship&#x27;s two controllable-pitch propellers. Maximum speed is , and maximum range is over at ; about 50% greater than other MEKO 200 designs. The standard ship&#x27;s company of an &quot;Anzac&quot; consists of 22 officers and 141 sailors.

As designed, the main armament for the frigate is a 5-inch 54 calibre Mark 45 gun, supplemented by an eight-cell Mark 41 vertical launch system (for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow or RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles), two machine guns, and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets (initially firing Mark 46 torpedoes, but later upgraded to use the MU90 Impact torpedo). They were also designed for but not with a close-in weapons system (two Mini Typhoons fitted when required from 2005 onwards), two quad-canister Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers (which were installed across the RAN vessels from 2005 onwards), and a second Mark 41 launcher (which has not been added). The Australian &quot;Anzac&quot;s use a Sikorsky S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter; plans to replace them with Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprites were cancelled in 2008 due to ongoing problems.

&quot;Ballarat&quot; was laid down at Williamstown, Victoria on 4 August 2000. The ship was assembled from six hull modules and six superstructure modules; the superstructure modules were fabricated in Whangarei, New Zealand, and hull modules were built at both Williamstown and Newcastle, New South Wales, with final integration at Williamstown. She was launched on 25 May 2002, and commissioned into the RAN on 26 June 2004. She was the eighth ship of the class to be constructed, and the sixth to enter service in the Royal Australian Navy. The motto and badge of HMAS &quot;Ballarat&quot; are references to the events of the Eureka Stockade, which occurred at Ballarat in 1854.

==Operational history==
At the start of 2005, &quot;Ballarat&quot; was involved in Operation Relex II, a border protection operation in Australia&#x27;s northern waters. &quot;Ballarat&quot; ran aground off Christmas Island near Flying Fish Cove on 22 January 2005 causing damage to the rudder and propellers from the sand and coral. There were no injuries to the crew.
In March 2006, &quot;Ballarat&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf to relieve HMAS &quot;Parramatta&quot; as part of Operation Catalyst, the Australian Defence Force&#x27;s contribution to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq.

In December 2006 a request by members of the ship&#x27;s company led to a re-launching of Ballarat Bitter, a beer originally brewed in Ballarat but stopped in 1989. Proceeds from the sale of the two limited releases were donated to the United Way charities. The brand&#x27;s mascot, Ballarat Bertie, has been adopted by the ship as a mascot.

On the morning of 13 March 2009, &quot;Ballarat&quot; was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. The frigate was one of the thirteen ships involved in the ceremonial entry through Sydney Heads, and anchored in the harbour for the review.

On 20 April 2009, &quot;Ballarat&quot; and the &quot;Adelaide&quot;-class frigate departed from Sydney as part of Operation Northern Trident, a six-month round-the-world voyage by the two vessels, with numerous diplomatic visits and joint exercises with foreign navies. During the night of 17 May, &quot;Ballarat&quot; and &quot;Sydney&quot; provided aid to two merchant vessels in the Gulf of Aden, driving off two separate groups of Somali pirates attacking the ships. &quot;Ballarat&quot; escorted an impromptu convoy of eight ships, including the two that were attacked, to safety, while &quot;Sydney&quot; remained in the area to report the incidents to Combined Task Force 151.

&quot;Ballarat&quot; completed the Anti-Ship Missile Defence (ASMD) upgrade in September 2015. The upgrade included the fitting of CEA Technologies&#x27; CEAFAR and CEAMOUNT phased array radars on new masts, a Vampir NG Infrared Search and Track system, and Sharpeye Navigational Radar Systems, along with improvements to the operations room equipment and layout.

In September 2018, &quot;Ballarat&quot; sailed at short notice to participate in the rescue of two round-the-world sailors in the southern Indian Ocean. The ship transported one of them back to Australia from Île Amsterdam after he was rescued by a French fishing boat.

In April 2021, &quot;Ballarat&quot; took part in the search for the missing Indonesian Navy submarine KRI Nanggala (402). The next month the ship participated in efforts to enforce sanctions against North Korea as part of Operation Argos.

<doc id="1102670" wikidata="Q14475873" url="?curid=1102670" title="Simon Thomas (presenter)">
<text>Simon Thomas (born ) is an English television presenter who hosts &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; on Sky Sports. Thomas also worked on &quot;Blue Peter&quot; for six years, and presented live Premier League football for Sky Sports from 2016 to 2018.

==Early life==
Thomas was born in Norwich, Norfolk, to Andrew and Gill Thomas. He has two sisters, Hannah and Rebecca. Although Thomas initially grew up in Cromer, and then Grimston, where he attended Grimston Primary and Middle School, the family later moved to Surrey, where he attended Aberdour School in Tadworth, Surrey and St. John&#x27;s School, Leatherhead. After leaving school, he went to Birmingham University, where he graduated with a 2:1 BA Hons degree in history.

==Broadcasting career==

===&quot;Blue Peter&quot;===
Having applied for the job three times, Thomas began presenting the children&#x27;s programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; on 8 January 1999 replacing the sacked presenter Richard Bacon. Previously he had worked as a runner at Children&#x27;s BBC and the radio station LBC. During his tenure at &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, he ran in the London Marathon twice and two Great North Runs, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and Mont Blanc, completed over 40 solo sky dives with the Royal Air Force, presented a medal at the Commonwealth Games, ran in the 60 metres sprint at the Norwich Union Indoor Athletics against Frankie Fredericks and Darren Campbell and even directed an edition of the show. He also presented the Queen with a Gold Blue Peter badge when she visited the studio and remarked on presenting Her Majesty with the badge that &quot;she could get into the Tower of London free with it.&quot;

Thomas co-presented with Stuart Miles, Katy Hill, Konnie Huq, Matt Baker, Liz Barker and Zöe Salmon.

Thomas announced his intention to leave &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in January 2005, and his last live show was aired on 25 April of that year.

===BBC===
Thomas presented &quot;CBBC Proms in the Park&quot; in Hyde Park in 2001 with Matt Baker and Faye Tozer, and in 2002 with Fearne Cotton. He also presented BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Making Tracks&quot; with Matt Baker.

===Sky Sports===
After leaving the BBC, Thomas joined Sky Sports in June 2005 and presented the 15:00–19:00 shift on Sky Sports News, alongside Georgie Thompson. He also presented Cricket AM during the summer on Sky Sports 1 with Sarah-Jane Mee and has presented the Sky Sports Victory Shield, England&#x27;s U21s games, Centenary Shield, International Cricket, &quot;Sky Sports News Cricket World Cup Report&quot;, the Mosconi Cup from Las Vegas, Sky Sports World Cup report from Cape Town 2010 and Sky Sports News&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 Ryder Cup.

At the start of the 2010/2011 Football Season, Thomas became the lead presenter of Sky Sports&#x27; live Football League coverage, leaving his position on Sky Sports News. From 2014, Thomas began presenting live League Cup football on Sky Sports, following Ben Shephard stepping down from all live match presenting duties. From August 2016, Thomas has presented live Premier League coverage, most notably on Saturday lunch times and bank holidays, following the departure of Ed Chamberlin to ITV Racing, and David Jones&#x27; subsequent promotion to Super Sunday and Monday Night Football lead presenter. Thomas regularly works alongside pundits such as Graeme Souness, Jamie Redknapp and Thierry Henry.

===&quot;This Morning&quot;===

In May 2019 Thomas took part in a three-part mini series for &quot;This Morning&quot; called &#x27;Pursuits of Happiness&#x27;. The series showed three different activities people took part in to overcome and deal with their mental health issues.

In September 2019 Thomas appeared on the show to raise awareness for blood cancer symptoms.

==Other work==
In August 2009 and August 2010, Thomas compered on the Main Stage at Greenbelt, a Christian music and arts Festival held at Cheltenham Racecourse.

==Personal life==
Thomas lives in Buckinghamshire and has a son. He is a Christian and a lifelong supporter of Norwich City and vice-president of the Norwich City Supporters Trust.

Thomas&#x27;s first wife, Gemma, died on 24 November 2017, just three days after being diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.

In July 2021, Thomas married his girlfriend Derrina Jebb at Norwich Cathedral. On 6 October 2022 he announced the premature birth of a daughter.

<doc id="1102674" wikidata="Q1032421" url="?curid=1102674" title="Canadice (grape)">
<text>Canadice is a cultivar of seedless red grape with a bit of a spicy flavor. It is a late season cultivar ripening about mid-September into October and is hardy up to -20 degrees Fahrenheit. It is used as a table grape and is described as productive with a flavor similar to Delaware grapes. Also, these grapes come in large, cylindrical and somewhat compact clusters and are medium in individual size. Negative attributes of this particular grape are that it is highly susceptible or sensitive to black rot as well as moderately susceptible or sensitive to downy mildew and &quot;Botrytis&quot;. It is also slightly susceptible or sensitive to powdery mildew. However, tests have shown that Canadice grapes will maintain a high quality for up to four months in storage with high post-harvest sulfur dioxide fumigation.

Canadice resulted from a cross of Bath by Himrod and was released by the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York, in 1977. Like several other releases from this program, it was named for one of the Finger Lakes, Canadice Lake.

<doc id="1102675" wikidata="Q1208347" url="?curid=1102675" title="Kenny">
<text>Kenny is a surname, a given name, and a diminutive of several different given names.

In Ireland, the surname is an Anglicisation of the Irish Ó Cionnaith, also spelt Ó Cionnaoith and Ó Cionaodha, meaning &quot;descendant of Cionnaith&quot;. It was once popular in the 16th-century in Leinster, Munster, parts of Connacht and in County Tyrone in Ulster, and was Anglicised as O&#x27;Kenna, O&#x27;Kenny, O&#x27;Kinney, Kenna, Kenney, Kenny, and Kinney amongst other variations.

One bearer of the name was Cainnech of Aghaboe, better known in English as Saint Canice - a sixth-century Irish priest and missionary from near Dungiven, after whom the city and county of Kilkenny is also named. The Irish form &quot;Cill Chainnigh&quot; means &quot;Church of Canice&quot;.

It is thought that the &quot;Ó Cionnaith&quot; sept was part of the Uí Maine kingdom, based in Connacht. Within this area, the name is associated traditionally with counties Galway and Roscommon.

Kenny is ranked at number 76 in the list of the most common surnames in Ireland. Other spellings include O&#x27;Kenny, Kenney, Kennie, Kinnie and Kinny.

The given name, Kenny, is most often used as a short form of the name Kenneth and a diminutive form of Ken.

<text>Himrod is a white table grape, released in 1952 by the New York Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York. It is seedless and known for its sweet flavor and ripening quickly . Himrod is considered very productive and reliable.

Himrod resulted from a cross of Ontario by Thompson Seedless, a particularly successful cross which resulted in the eventual release of four cultivars, the others being Interlaken, Romulus, and Lakemont. All were named for towns in the Finger Lakes region, near Geneva, New York. These grapes are all quite productive, but they have some differences.

<text>Normanton is a town in the civil parish of Normanton and Altofts, in the City of Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England. It is north-east of Wakefield and south-west of Castleford. The civil parish extends west and north to the River Calder, and includes the large village of Altofts. At the time of the 2011 Census, the population of the civil parish was 20,872.

The Normanton ward of the Wakefield City Council does not include Altofts, but includes the civil parish of Warmfield cum Heath to the south-west of Normanton. The ward had a population of 16,220 in 2011.

Normanton is home to the amateur rugby league Normanton Knights club in the National Conference League.

==History==
The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; gives information on &#x27;Norman-tune&#x27; as:

In Normantune there are 10 carucates for geld, which 5 plows can plough. 2 thegns had 2 manors there T.R.E. Now, in the King&#x27;s hand there are 6 villeins there, and 3 bordars, a priest and a church, with 3 ploughs, of meadow. Pasturable wood (land) 6 furlongs in length and 1 in breadth. The whole of this land lies in the soc of Wachefelt, except the Church. T.R.E. it was worth 12s: now (it is worth) 10s.

Normanton was originally surrounded by a moat, and in Norman times was the site of an enclosed settlement (chosen for its strategic view points across the surrounding area), and became known as &#x27;Norman – tune&#x27;, or &#x27;Norman – ton&#x27;.

At the time the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; was compiled in 1086, the occupation of Yorkshire by the Normans was underway. Archaeological evidence at today&#x27;s Normanton points to Haw Hill (or How Hill), an eminence that was probably a Norman defensive strategic mound once reinforced by a wooden palisade. The evidence of a Norman motte-and-bailey fortification at the town, and the name, is likely evidence that Normanton&#x27;s name derived from the Anglo-Norman presence in the area. Nearby, after all, were Tickhill, the fortress of Norman magnate Roger de Busli, as well as other new Norman power centres. Although the area had once been part of the Scandinavian Danelaw, William the Conqueror&#x27;s scorched earth northern campaign had left the area ripe for exploitation by his Lords. By all measures, Normanton likely owes its name to these new invaders.

One of the earliest buildings to survive within the village is Hanson House. This is set back from the church and has a timber-frame construction. The building was constructed in the mid-15th century, with a later wing added in the 18th century. A fire has damaged the building, which is being restored and modernised.

On 1 April 1938 Altofts parish was abolished and merged with Normanton. On 1 April 2023 the merged parish was renamed from &quot;Normanton&quot; to &quot;Normanton and Altofts&quot;, at the same time part was moved to Featherstone. In 1931 the parish of Normanton (prior to the merge) had a population of 15,684.

===Growth===

A grammar school was founded in Normanton by John Freeston (now the &#x27;Parish Rooms&#x27;..later moved to the site of the, Normanton Junior School on Church Lane) in 1592, but the town remained very small until it became the focus of several railway lines in the mid-19th century. Work began in 1837 under the supervision of George Stephenson on the construction of the North Midland Railway from Derby to Leeds. This was soon followed by an addition to the York and North Midland Railway from York and then the Manchester and Leeds Railway from Manchester which all extended to Normanton thereby giving the town access to much of the country. The Leeds and Manchester lines crossed a stretch across the Pennines and at the time had the world&#x27;s longest railway station platform at Normanton, a quarter of a mile long. The station was, for the next ten years or so, the most important in England, employing over 700 people who looked after the station&#x27;s 700,000 passengers a year.

In Victorian times Normanton station was one of the most important stations in Northern England, and Queen Victoria stopped over in the Station Hotel. The town also served as an important part of the transport infrastructure for national and local industries including coal and bricks, although most of this was lost during the 1950s and 1960s with the last remaining operational brickworks eventually closing in the mid-1990s. There were three brickworks in town which were all built within the small area of Newland, taking advantage of the abundance of clay from the area. A fourth works was founded in the 1890s by a Thomas Kirk from Nottingham, who had heard rumours that Normanton was rapidly turning into an important junction on the railways. Both Kirk and his sons used their life savings and formed the Normanton Brick Company at nearby Altofts which finally closed in 2011

The coming of the railways enabled the locally mined coal to be sent across the country. Demand soon outstripped supply and many more shafts were sunk to reach the coal seams under the town. In 1871 Dom Pedro, the Emperor of Brazil, visited Normanton with his Empress and gave his name (in a slightly altered form) to the Don Pedro Colliery at Hopetown. Today roads in the area of the former colliery retain the name. At their peak the collieries employed over 10,000 men, most of whom wanted to move themselves and their families to Normanton. The town enjoyed a boom period with more mines opening and more shafts being sunk in order to meet the increasing demand for coal until, by the mid-1970s, most coal seams in the Normanton area were worked-out.

===Decline===
The disputes surrounding the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–85 meant that many mines across the country were to close although by this stage there were no collieries still in production in Normanton. However, the strike still affected many families in the area, as Normanton colliers still worked in pits in neighbouring towns. The area once occupied by the St John&#x27;s or Newland Colliery is now part of the controversial Welbeck landfill site which has been the subject of both local and national media attention since its development as a toxic tip. The site attracted so much negative attention that the group Residents Against Toxic Scheme (RATS) was established to halt planning permission for the disposal of toxic chemicals at the site, claiming the scheme was an extreme health hazard.

Normanton suffered decline in the years following the miners&#x27; strike. The railway station was in such a state of neglect and disrepair that the decision was made to demolish it in 1986; the section of railway line between Goosehill Junction and Crofton Interchange were lifted the year after. Very little now remains of Normanton&#x27;s railway and mining heritage.

===Modern===
Normanton has become a growing commuter suburb of the Leeds City Region, with relatively cheap housing and efficient transport links. The town is still accessible via Normanton railway station, and is currently served by an unmanned island platform station with regular trains to Leeds, Castleford, Wakefield and Sheffield Meadowhall Interchange.

The addition and expansion of the Eurolink Industrial Estate at Junction 31 of the M62 attracted national and multi-national corporations to locate their distribution depots to Normanton. Being centrally located within the UK, the town is served by three major motorway networks: the M62 linking Liverpool to Hull (west to east); the M1 linking Leeds to London (North to South); and the North of England via a new link between the M62 and the A1(M) at nearby Ferrybridge.

==Landmarks==
===Church===

All Saints&#x27; is the Church of England parish church of Normanton, West Yorkshire. It is believed to have existed since at least 1256 and is built in the Perpendicular style.

===Newland===
The Newland estate was a small township on the outskirts of Normanton and lies on the north bank of the River Calder. Existing since 1213 when it was established by King John as a preceptory of the Knights Templar, it was later transferred to the similar organisation, the &quot;Knights Hospitaller&quot; in 1256. The property belonging to the Hospitallers was dissolved by King Henry VIII who bestowed the property upon himself. The earliest known preceptor of the Knights Hospitaller was Simon Paccable in 1313. Newland was once held by the Levett family, and William Levett, who was lord of the manor, was admitted tenant of the Knights Hospitaller on 2 October 1447.

The estate changed hands of ownership a number of times since King Henry VIII sold the land in 1544, with final ownership landing on the Warmfield Company Limited in 1926, who ran brickworks until the mid-20th century.

Newland today is kept as a nature reserve, with the remains of the estate overgrown with shrubs and plant life, the remains of Newland Hall still stand in the woodlands as a derelict building that last saw occupancy in 1972. A small fishing area just outside the Newland Estate is used by local fishermen.

==Filmography==
The old Normanton brickyard, situated just off of the A655 Wakefield Road, was used in the late-1990s as the fictional setting of a murder in the ITV series &quot;A Touch Of Frost&quot;. The structure was intact but abandoned at the time of filming and was the ideal location favoured by the ITV production team. In the series a body was found by the Police in one of the factory&#x27;s old kilns. Within 18 months of filming, the structure had been declared unsafe, and was partially demolished, leaving only the chimney stack standing.

<doc id="1102682" wikidata="Q4391454" url="?curid=1102682" title="Reactive mind">
<text>The reactive mind is a concept in Scientology formulated by L. Ron Hubbard, referring to that portion of the human mind that is unconscious and operates on stimulus-response, to which Hubbard attributed most mental, emotional, and psychosomatic ailments:

What can it do? It can give a man arthritis, bursitis, asthma, allergies, sinusitis, coronary trouble, high blood pressure and so on, down the whole catalog of psychosomatic ills, adding a few more which were never specifically classified as psychosomatic, such as the common cold.
: — L. Ron Hubbard (&quot;&quot;, 1999 paperback edition, p. 69)

Despite the lack of scientific basis for his claims, Hubbard&#x27;s book &quot;Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health&quot; claimed that the reactive mind is composed of impressions of past events of pain and unconsciousness, which he called engrams.

In Scientology, an auditor uses an E-meter (a galvanic skin response detector) to locate engrams in the parishioner which are then erased, using Dianetics. Scientology promotes such treatments to clear engrams believed to limit the individual&#x27;s spiritual ability, to halt the decline of their spiritual awareness, and to increase their survival potential.

From the end of the 1950s until the early 1970s, author William S. Burroughs used Hubbard&#x27;s reactive mind theory as the basis of his cut-up method, which was applied to novels such as &quot;The Soft Machine&quot;.

==Criticism==
University of Oxford biology professor Richard Dawkins wrote that Scientology purports to use scientific tools such as its controversial E-meter to augment the &quot;gullibility&quot; of this already &quot;gullible age&quot;.

<doc id="1102694" wikidata="Q5583582" url="?curid=1102694" title="Goodricke College, York">
<text>Goodricke College is a college of the University of York. It was founded in 1968 and named after the astronomer John Goodricke. The college has approximately 1500 undergraduate members, of which some 500 live in college accommodation, and about 140 postgraduate members, of which most live in college accommodation.

==History==
===Heslington West===
Goodricke College was opened on 18 October 1968 by Michael Swann and was the fifth college to be built. The opening of Goodricke is commemorated by a plaque on the outside of the Old Dining Hall – now part of James College.

While Goodricke College was located on Heslington West, it had four accommodation blocks: A, B, C and D. Blocks A and B were standard university accommodation, built to the CLASP system, and situated near the main college &quot;Nucleus&quot;. C-block and D-block were whitewashed brick buildings, considered to provide a lower quality of accommodation to A- and B-blocks. C-block was located next to the college &quot;Nucleus&quot;, while D-block was situated on the other side of the university lake from the main college buildings. The reason for the detached nature of D-block is that it was once part of Wentworth College. The internal walls of Blocks C and D were noted for their lack of plaster. Campus legend has it that this lack of plaster is due to fire regulations requiring a minimum width in corridors.

During the 2002 York University Students&#x27; Union (YUSU) &#x27;Collegeopoly&#x27; campaign about accommodation rent Goodricke College C Block was deemed to be the worst accommodation at York University, inspiring the unflattering nickname &quot;Cell Block C&quot;. The Campaigns Officers created a mockup of a Monopoly board with different accommodation blocks taking the places of the traditional streets. &quot;Goodricke C-block&quot; took the place of &quot;Old Kent Road&quot;.

In 2002–2003, the Goodricke Student Junior Common Room Committee, ran a campaign to Grade C list C- and D-blocks to raise awareness amongst students and administration regarding the university&#x27;s lack of maintenance of the accommodation. Over 10 years after the previous makeover, the blocks were finally given new carpeting, kitchen units, furniture and internet access. However, the rooms were upgraded to &#x27;Standard&#x27; instead of &#x27;Economy&#x27; by administration, thus forcing the inhabitants to pay the same amount as for more spacious accommodation. C- and D-blocks, meant to be demolished for a number of years, have exceeded their stated lifetime, but due to shortages in accommodation campus-wide, they have had to serve longer.

In 2003 the college saw the closure of its old dining facilities and the opening of The Roger Kirk Centre, now part of James College. The centre is a new purpose built amenities building and consists of a large dining room, and smaller coffee and snack bar. It is named after Roger Kirk, a former member of the University Court.

===Move to Heslington East===
In 2003, the university set out plans to create a campus for 5,000 additional students, Heslington East. In May 2008 the City of York planners approved the design for the new campus. It was decided that rather than create a new college that an existing College should be moved. Goodricke College was selected for this and moved onto the new campus in 2009 with James College taking over its building on Heslington West. The old Goodricke buildings were divided between James College and Vanbrugh College.

2009 marked the 40th anniversary of Goodricke College, with celebrations throughout the academic year to mark the occasion.

==Buildings and services==
Goodricke Nucleus is the name of the main administrative and facility building in Goodricke College and is located on the Heslington East campus. It also houses the Junior Common Room and the General Common Room. Portering services are provided from the Ron Cooke Hub. Goodricke consists of a mixture of standard and en-suite accommodation and a large, central, &#x27;nucleus&#x27; with large JCR, GCR and offices for staff. This approximately doubled the capacity of the college to over 600 students, including 100 postgraduate students.

The new college accommodation is divided into Courts, each named after a member of the university who has made a significant contribution to its life: Oliver Sheldon, Janet Baker and Kenneth Dixon. Originally, each of the Courts has a resident member of college staff. The College Dean lived in Janet Baker Court while at least one College Tutor lived in each of the other Courts.

Heslington East is connected to the Heslington West campus by the 66, 67, and 68 buses, all of which are free to students not travelling further than these campuses.

==Student life==
===Junior Common Room===

<doc id="1102696" wikidata="Q866398" url="?curid=1102696" title="Bislett Games">
<text>The Bislett Games is an annual track and field meeting at the Bislett Stadium in Oslo, Norway. Previously one of the IAAF Golden League events, it is now part of the Diamond League.

==History==
The first international athletics meeting at Bislett was held in 1924. Until 1937 the competitions are known as &quot;The American Meetings&quot;, similar to the international meetings in Zürich. Different organizers staged the meetings between 1947 and 1965 until the three athletics associations BUL, Vidar and Tjalve formed the Bislett Alliance. At this year Arne Haukvik founded the Bislett Games. He was a former politician and director of the meeting, who used to invite the athletes, sponsors and the press to his home for his traditional &quot;strawberry party&quot; the day before the event each year. He died of cancer in 2002 at age 76. The tradition however is continued.

Bislett Stadium was used for speed skating events at the Olympics, but nowadays it is better known for its Bislett Games athletics meeting. Bislett Games attract the best track and field athletes from all over the world, and 65 world records have been set on its forgiving, brick-coloured track so far. Due to the building of the new Bislett Stadium in Oslo, which started in April 2004, the 2004 edition of the traditional athletics meeting was staged on Fana stadion in Bergen under the name Bergen Bislett Games.

In 2009, a severe storm delayed proceedings and even caused damage to the track-side clock display. Sanya Richards recorded the fastest women&#x27;s 400 metres time since 2006 while the Dream Mile brought a number of records with winner Deresse Mekonnen improving upon his Ethiopian record, Kenyan William Biwott Tanui setting a world junior record and third-placed Augustine Choge beating his personal best. Former javelin winners Andreas Thorkildsen and Tero Pitkämäki continued their five-year shared dominance of the Bislett Games, with Pitkämäki taking the victory this time.

=== Alternative events ===
During 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic prevented Bislett Games from taking place, instead an event called &quot;Impossible Games&quot; was held. In 2021 there were still restrictions which caused the main event to be postponed to July 1. A restricted event called &quot;Night of Highlights&quot; was additionally held on June 4, 2021.

==Editions==
During some of the earliest editions, there were two meetings held per year.


==World records==
Over the course of its history, numerous world records have been set at the Games and former athletics meetings at Bislett stadium. In 1985 three new records were set at the same evening.

<doc id="1102701" wikidata="Q3431359" url="?curid=1102701" title="Boundary Waters">
<text>The Boundary Waters, also called the Quetico-Superior Country, is a region of wilderness straddling the Canada–United States border between Ontario and Minnesota, in the area just west of Lake Superior. While &quot;Boundary Waters&quot; is a common name for this region, the two nations also share extensive &quot;boundary waters&quot; along their border, beyond this region. This region is part of the Superior National Forest in northeastern Minnesota, and in Canada it includes La Verendrye and Quetico Provincial Parks in Ontario. Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota may also be considered part of the Boundary Waters. The name &quot;Boundary Waters&quot; is often used in the U.S. to refer specifically to the U.S. Wilderness Area protecting its southern extent, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

The Boundary Waters region is characterized by a vast network of waterways and bogs within a glacially-carved landscape of Precambrian bedrock covered in thin soils and boreal forests. The Boundary Waters is a popular destination for recreationalists pursuing camping, canoeing, and fishing as well as for those simply looking for natural scenery and relaxation. The area is one of several distinct regions of Minnesota.

== Communities ==

The following communities are located anywhere from two to twenty miles from the boundary waters: Ely, Cook, Grand Marais, and Tofte in Minnesota and Atikokan in Ontario.

==Protected areas==

Protected areas in the Boundary Waters region in Minnesota include Superior National Forest, Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Voyageurs National Park and Grand Portage National Monument. Protected areas in Ontario include Quetico and La Verendrye provincial parks.

<text>James Richardson Spensley (17 May 1867 – 10 November 1915) was an English medical doctor, footballer, manager, Scout leader and medic from Stoke Newington, London. He is considered to be one of the &quot;Fathers of Italian football&quot;, due to his association with Genoa CFC and his contribution to the modern day variation of the game in Italy and of Italian scouting.

==Biography==
He was born in 1867 in the Stoke Newington district of London to William Spensley and Elizabeth Alice Richardson. Although he was born and grew up in London, the Spensley family were originally from the Swaledale area in Yorkshire.

Richardson Spensley had the opportunity to travel far and wide as an adult. Amongst the most keen interests which he had acquired whilst travelling were eastern religions, languages (he was versed in Greek and Sanskrit), boxing and football. In addition to working as a doctor, he spent some time as a correspondent for the British newspaper the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

===Football in Genoa===
Richardson Spensley arrived in Genoa in 1896, initially for the purpose of curing English sailors on the coal ships. He joined Genoa Cricket &amp; Athletics Club, a cricket and athletics club formed by British expatriates. He opened the footballing section of the club on 10 April 1897 and was put in place as its first ever manager. This was innovative as the modern day footballing scene in Italy was in its embryonic stages: if it had not been for Edoardo Bosio who founded four clubs in Turin, there would have been no football at all in Italy at the time of Richardson Spensley&#x27;s arrival.

Richardson Spensley acted as player-manager for Genoa in the first ever Italian Football Championship (which he initiated) during 1898 which his club won. The following season, he switched position from defender to goalkeeper, playing on until 1906.

Including the first title, Genoa won the Italian league six times while Richardson Spensley was at the helm. After retiring from playing when he was almost 40 years old, he stayed on in the management role for one more year, before leaving entirely.

===Scouting===
While living in England he became acquainted with Robert Baden-Powell who founded the Scout Movement, from whom he had received a signed copy of &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;. In 1910 genoan pedagogist Mario Mazza, who had founded in 1905 a youth movement called &quot;Le gioiose&quot;, decided to join scouting with his group. He approached Sir Francis Vane, another Briton living in Italy and former collaborator of Baden-Powell, who had founded the first Italian scout troop in Bagni di Lucca in 1908. Vane came to Genoa to hold a lecture, and referred Mazza to Spensley. Spensley and Mazza together founded the first scout troops in Genoa and joined the newly born association Ragazzi Esploratori Italiani (REI), the first scout association in Italy. Mazza was Section Secretary and Spensley regional commissioner for Liguria. The Genoa section was one of the most active in the early years of scouting in Italy, and Mazza and Spensley are counted amongst the pioneers of Italian scouting.

=== Death ===
During World War I, he worked in the medical field putting his scouting abilities to use as a lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was injured on the battle field while tending to the wounds of an enemy out of compassion. As an officer, he was interned in the Fortress of Mainz, in Germany, where he died for his wounds not long after. 

His body was one of many moved in 1922 from smaller graveyards to larger cemeteries in Germany (no British bodies were returned to Britain). Spensley was reburied at Niederzwehren War Cemetery south of Kassel. His final burial location remained unknown until 1993, when two Italian scouts, after long research, managed to locate it again.

<doc id="1102713" wikidata="Q818249" url="?curid=1102713" title="Bentham, North Yorkshire">
<text>Bentham is a civil parish in North Yorkshire, England, with a population of 3,027 at the 2011 Census. The parish includes the town of High Bentham, occasionally known as Higher Bentham or just Bentham, and the older adjacent village of Low Bentham.

The town lies on the River Wenning, just west of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and on the northern edge of the Forest of Bowland. The original centre of the town lay in Low Bentham, but a market was granted to High Bentham in the 14th century, and it became a centre for weaving from the 18th century, particularly after weavers in the town discovered how to weave hosepipes from flax.

It was historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. From 1974 to 2023 it was part of the Craven District.

== Governance ==

An electoral ward of the same name exists. This ward includes Burton in Lonsdale and well as the Bentham (Town) ward and has a total population taken at the 2011 census of 3,606. The ward falls within the Skipton and Ripon parliamentary constituency.

The Bentham Town Council, which is responsible for local matters, is based at Bentham Town Hall, built in 1877. This facility includes several bookable spaces used by community groups and available for hire on a private basis, as well as housing the town&#x27;s tourist information centre.

NHS Cumbria CCG is responsible for health matters for the population across the civil parish. Bentham Medical Practice is located centrally within the town.

==Community==

The town has hosted an agricultural show since the middle of the 19th century. The show, which take place annually on the first Saturday of September, is a traditional agricultural show with handicraft and horticulture as well as sheep, cattle and poultry competitions, but no horse classes. The 146th Bentham Agricultural Show was held in 2018 at the Bentham Auction Mart.

In addition to the traditional agricultural show, the town also hosts an annual Carnival procession in June of each year. In addition to a themed street parade, the event usually culminates with a funfair and stalls hosted at the Bentham Auction Mart.

The town&#x27;s Auction Mart was founded in 1903 and provides an important venue for community events as well as regular livestock sales. The site hosts bonfire night fireworks and Christmas market events in addition to the Agricultural Show and Carnival.

Bentham is served by Bentham Community Primary School, which caters for children aged three to eleven and, as of 2016 had just under 150 students on its roll.

The &quot;Bentham News&quot; is the monthly community publication for the town. Established in 1982 the publication currently circulates over 2,000 copies which are delivered free by volunteers to every household in Bentham. The publication is also available at central points in the town and outlying areas.

== Walking: Heritage Trails ==
Bentham has several circular heritage trails. There are three trails in total and these are colour coded, purple, pink and blue. The Purple Trail is long with a route through Ridding Lane Farm and over Shaky Bridge. This route is largely on footpaths and includes a number of stone styles along a circular route along the Wenning valley. The Pink Trail is long and extends the purple trail further along the river valley and also passes close by the Old Quarry in the northeast of the town, with a short section, about , on the road.
The Blue Trail is the longest of the three trails at over . This route climbs up out of the town to the South and into the Forest of Bowland. The route included several ladder styles, and takes in the Great Stone of Fourstones known locally as Big Stone, where walkers can take in impressive views of the Yorkshire Three Peaks.

== Railway ==

The Leeds to Morecambe railway passes through the unmanned Bentham Station. The station was opened in 1850 and has about 18,000 users per year. When it first opened it was owned by the &quot;Little&quot; North Western Railway, it was later bought by the Midland Railway and is now operated by Northern. The station is supported Friends of Bentham Station (FOBS), a community group which has formally registered a stakeholder interest with Northern Rail.

==Media==
Since the town is closest to the Lancashire and North Yorkshire border, local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and Granada Television that broadcast from Salford. The town is served by both BBC Radio Cumbria and BBC Radio Lancashire. Other radio stations that are also received the town are Greatest Hits Radio Harrogate and the Yorkshire Dales and Dales Radio. Local newspapers are &quot;Lancaster Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Westmorland Gazette&quot;, &quot;Craven Herald &amp; Pioneer&quot; and &quot;Bentham News&quot; is a monthly local community newspaper which is delivered free by volunteers to every household in Bentham and to central points in local towns and villages. 

==Churches==
There are two churches in High Bentham: St Boniface Roman Catholic Church and Bentham Methodist Chapel. St John the Baptist Church and Bentham Quakers Meeting House are in Low Bentham. Bentham has several youth groups for teenagers including the Bentham Youth Café (BYC) which is on Main Street and Monday&#x27;s Youth Club which is organised by 4Youth. There are also separate youth drop-in sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays of each week which are also run by and held at the Youth Cafe. For younger children Springboard and Adventurers groups are held at the Methodist Church. St Margaret&#x27;s Church in High Bentham closed in 2013 due to lack of funding for basic maintenance. It has now been carefully renovated and converted into two private homes.
St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church, Low Bentham is one of the oldest churches in the area, and was noted in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; in 1086. It is a grade II* listed building.

==Golf Club==
Bentham Golf Club is located on Robin Lane to the northern edge of the town. The Club has an 18-hole course which was established in the 1920s plus a driving range and &#x27;footgolf&#x27; course. The course is set in the countryside to the south of the Three Peaks and is privately owned.

<text>Amazing Facts is a non-profit Seventh-day Adventist evangelistic ministry based in Granite Bay, California, which broadcasts daily television programming worldwide. It is based on the teachings of Scripture, and especially focuses on the Three Angels&#x27; Messages of Revelation 14. Beginning as a radio program dedicated to Christian evangelism, it later expanded into television and online Bible study ministries.

==History==
&quot;Amazing Facts&quot; was founded in 1965 by Joe Crews in Baltimore, Maryland. Inspired by the success of &quot;The Rest Of The Story&quot;, hosted by Paul Harvey, Joe Crews&#x27; original objective for &quot;Amazing Facts&quot; was to reach out to both Christian and non-Christian listeners via daily 15-minute programs by opening with a scientific or historic fact, and how it applies to the overall Biblical messages. Later, the program offered accompanying home Bible study courses, as well as books written by Crews himself. In 1987, &quot;Amazing Facts&quot; initiated a television ministry that has expanded to four programs as well as periodic evangelism series.

Shortly before his death in 1994, Crews invited Doug Batchelor to assume the position of president, which he holds to this day. Today, the &quot;Amazing Facts&quot; radio program &quot;Bible Answers Live&quot; broadcasts mainly out of Granite Bay, California each Sunday evening to about 100 national stations. At the end of 2018, Amazing Facts became an independent ministry and changed its name to Amazing Facts International.

==Media programming==

<text>The Voice of Prophecy, founded in 1929 by H. M. S. Richards, is a Seventh-day Adventist religious radio ministry headquartered in Loveland, Colorado. 

Initially airing in 1929 on a single radio station in Los Angeles, the &quot;Voice of Prophecy&quot; has since grown to numerous stations throughout the United States and Canada. It was one of the first religious programs in the United States to broadcast nationally. Under the leadership of Shawn and Jean Boonstra, the ministry has now expanded into additional forms of media, including the weekly &quot;Authentic&quot; broadcast and &quot;Discovery Mountain&quot; radio adventure series for kids. Additional projects include humanitarian efforts in countries such as India and Myanmar.

==History==
H.M.S. Richards, Sr. began a regular radio program on October 19, 1929, on KNX (AM) in Los Angeles.

Richards earliest studio was his South Gate Tabernacle near Long Beach, where he was presenting nightly evangelistic meetings. His office was a renovated chicken coop in Walnut Park, California. Seventh-day Adventist Church members donated their old eyeglasses and gave teeth with gold fillings and jewelry and watches to help buy the first radio time on Long Beach station KGER.

Later Richards presented daily live broadcasts of &quot;The Tabernacle of the Air&quot; over KGER in Long Beach, California, and live weekly remote broadcasts from his tabernacle to KMPC (AM) in Beverly Hills.

In January 1937 the broadcast footprint expanded over a network of several stations of the Don Lee Broadcasting System, and the name of the broadcast was changed to the &quot;Voice of Prophecy&quot;. The first &quot;Voice of Prophecy&quot; coast-to-coast broadcast was over 89 stations of the Mutual Broadcasting System on Sunday, January 4, 1942. It was one of the first religious programs to broadcast nationally.

Up until the early 1950s broadcasts were produced live. Mispronounced names and singer mistakes went out unedited to the listeners. By 1980, Richards had a $6 million budget. The &quot;Voice of Prophecy&quot; broadcast each Sunday to 700 stations around the world.

Throughout the years &quot;Voice of Prophecy&quot; broadcasts were marked by an opening theme song of &quot;Lift Up the Trumpet&quot; performed by the King&#x27;s Heralds quartet and closed with Richard&#x27;s poem &quot;Have Faith in God&quot; each week having a new verse written.

==Speakers==
Richards, Sr. was speaker from 1929 to 1969. In 1969, Richards&#x27; son, Richards, Jr., succeeded him and was speaker from 1969 to 1992. Later speakers included Pastor Lonnie Melashenko, Fred Kinsey, and Shawn Boonstra.


==Musicians==
Various musicians perform on the broadcast.
Female vocalist Del Delker began as a regular on the program since 1947. The male quartet King&#x27;s Heralds also performed weekly on the program from 1936 until 1982.
Wayne Hooper served as musical director until his retirement in 1980.

==Discover Bible School==
A key program of &quot;Voice of Prophecy&quot; is the &quot;Discover Bible School&quot;. Introduced on February 1, 1942, as &quot;The Bible School of the Air&quot;, it was one of the first correspondence Bible schools in North America.

Later known as the &quot;Discover Bible School&quot; it offers free Bible guides by mail or online and has affiliate schools in over 120 countries with lessons in over 80 languages and dialects.

In 2010, the Bible School celebrated its one millionth graduate.

== Evangelists ==
Jim Reinking became a Voice of Prophecy evangelist in 1998 and served the ministry for 13 years.

<doc id="1102731" wikidata="Q8843631" url="?curid=1102731" title="It Is Written">
<text>It Is Written is an internationally broadcast Seventh-day Adventist Christian television program founded in 1956 by George Vandeman. Its title comes from the Gospel of Matthew: &quot;It is written, &#x27;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. The programs are produced by the Adventist Media Center in California.

&quot;It Is Written&quot; was the first religious television program to air in color, and the first to take advantage of satellite technology. The program broadcasts to millions of viewers in more than 140 countries.

==History==
The program aired in March 1956 with founder Pastor George Vandeman as speaker. It made history as the first religious telecast to air in color. Over the next half-century, &quot;It Is Written&quot; grew exponentially. Under Pastor Vandeman&#x27;s direction, It Is Written entered many new evangelism arenas. His live “Revelation Seminars” attracted tens of thousands of eager visitors, and the telecast entered millions of homes in numerous countries.

In 1991, Vandeman retired, and Pastor Mark Finley accepted the position as the ministry&#x27;s new speaker/director. He also shared Pastor Vandeman&#x27;s vision for evangelism, and in 1995 made history with a satellite evangelistic series called &quot;NET ’95&quot;.

NET ’96 followed one year later, and whereas &quot;NET ’95&quot; had targeted North America, &quot;NET ’96&quot; reached the world with messages in 13 languages. It is estimated that 2,200 churches from 45 countries participated in at least one of the &quot;NETs&quot;, and more than 30,000 people were baptized at the conclusion of the meetings.

&quot;It Is Written&quot; was the first major Christian ministry to utilize satellite uplink technology. The next major It Is Written satellite effort took place from 1999 through 2001 with &quot;ACTS 2000&quot;, when the ministry covered the entire globe with multiple satellite meetings. Pastor Finley conducted a total of 10 series to a combined audience of 3 million people.

By this time, the program&#x27;s reach had expanded by leaps and bounds. Although hundreds of other Christian broadcasts had flooded the airwaves, It Is Written maintained its rank as one of the top 10 religious programs in North America and received more than 30 awards for excellence in programming.

It Is Written entered a new era in January 2005 as Pastor Shawn Boonstra became the third speaker/director. Finley passed the mantle to Boonstra with his blessing.

Pastor Boonstra came to the It Is Written headquarters from It Is Written Canada, where he had served as speaker/director for four years. As someone who joined the Adventist Church after attending an It Is Written evangelistic series, Pastor Boonstra passionately believes in the mission of the ministry.

The next five years were a whirlwind of outreach via technology and public evangelism. Pastor Boonstra&#x27;s &quot;Revelation Speaks Peace&quot; evangelistic series in cities like Phoenix, Portland, Los Angeles, India, and Rome energized attendees and church members alike with the hope in Christ that is revealed through the final book of the Bible.
In January 2011, Pastor John Bradshaw was named new speaker/director for It Is Written.

In May 2011, Bradshaw conducted a short series live from Las Vegas called &quot;Babylon Rising&quot;. This effort was broadcast worldwide via satellite and the Internet. Following the success of the &quot;Babylon Rising&quot; series, Bradshaw presented a month-long series called &quot;Revelation Today&quot; live from the Cashman Center in Las Vegas in January 2012. He followed this series with meetings in Paris, Dayton, Southern Mexico, Costa Rica, Prague, New York, Charlotte and more.

==Ministry facts==
&quot;It Is Written&quot; can be viewed each week in approximately 7,000 cities in the United States and 700 cities in Canada. The telecast&#x27;s reach extends to at least 140 countries. An average of 1.5 million people view the North American telecast each week and the program consistently ranks as one of the top 10 religious programs in the United States according to the Nielsen ratings.

In addition to broadcasting on regular network and cable stations, the telecast regularly airs on six satellite networks: Trinity Broadcasting Network, the Hope Channel, and 3ABN. 

&quot;It Is Written&quot; has an inventory of over 1,100 recorded programs, with at least 36 new broadcasts produced each year. Over the last 50 years, the ministry has received 30 Angel Awards, 10 Telly Awards, and three Aurora Awards. 

==Outreach==
Several Bible study tools on the It Is Written site include “The Discover Bible Guides,&quot; &quot;New Beginnings,&quot; &quot;Unsealing Daniel&#x27;s Mysteries,&quot; and &quot;The Search for Certainty.&quot;
In 2004, &quot;It Is Written&quot;—in conjunction with the Joni and Friends ministry—shipped wheelchairs to Rwanda in an effort to assist with a shortage in local hospitals.

The ministry partnered with the Pilgrim Relief Society in 2006 to deliver 1,500 “Godpods” to the San people of the Kalahari Desert. Since the San people have no written language, these solar-powered devices—which are the size of a garage door opener—contain the entire Bible in the clicking San language. In addition to this Bible project, &quot;It Is Written&quot; is also building solar-powered water wells to help the San people combat the problem of dehydration. 

In 2007, &quot;It Is Written&quot; traveled to the Arctic to deliver hundreds of Bibles in Inuktitut to Inuit who live in remote areas.

==&quot;It Is Written&quot; on the internet==
&quot;It Is Written&quot; became one of the first Christian television programs to broadcast free video podcasts via iTunes in 2006. 

On Sept. 3, 2007, the ministry launched a daily (Monday – Friday) internet-based devotional program called &quot;A Better Way to Live&quot;. The tagline for the online program is &quot;A daily spiritual boost for busy people&quot; and in each program, Boonstra takes one Bible verse and applies it to daily life. 

This was followed by Bradshaw&#x27;s launch of a daily one-minute &quot;Every Word&quot; devotional in 2011.

It Is Written TV network is available on Internet, Apple TV (current and future models), Roku, Amazon Fire TV and other means.

==&quot;It Is Written&quot; on mobile==
&quot;It Is Written&quot; offers email sign-ups, gifting opportunities, access to weekly programs and more, via its mobile presence. In 2011, the mobile site won both a Silver W3 Award and a Silver Davey Award in the category of Best Mobile Website. The mobile site was designed and developed by Trinet Internet Solutions.

<text>&quot;Home on Lagrange (The L5 Song)&quot; is a filk song, written in 1977 by William S. Higgins and Barry D. Gehm, intended to be sung to the tune of &quot;Home on the Range&quot;. It was inspired by the idea of placing large, self-contained space colonies into stable equilibrium at the or Lagrange points, which had been advocated by Gerard O&#x27;Neill. The song&#x27;s lyrics satirize the enthusiasm of space-colony advocates.

A U.S. copyright has been registered on &quot;Home on Lagrange (The L5 Song).&quot; 
Higgins and Gehm originally published it in the magazine &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot; in 1978. It was subsequently republished in many other media, including the &quot;NESFA Hymnal&quot; and the &quot;L5 Society&quot; magazine &quot;L5 News&quot;.
It was anthologized in &quot;The Endless Frontier&quot;, a collection of stories about space colonization. The song was also quoted by historian W. Patrick McCray in his book &quot;The Visioneers&quot;. Today, it can be found at various websites on the Internet, often without attribution.

The chorus of &quot;Home On Lagrange:&quot;

:: &quot;Home, home on Lagrange,&quot;
:: &quot;Where the space debris always collects,&quot;
:: &quot;We possess, so it seems, two of Man&#x27;s greatest dreams:&quot;
:: &quot;Solar power and zero-gee sex.&quot;

<doc id="1102756" wikidata="Q7894167" url="?curid=1102756" title="Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Corley">
<text>Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Corley (originally known as Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes), 273 F.3d 429 (2nd Cir., 2001), was a court ruling at the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. This ruling was the first circuit-level test of the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

== Background ==
Eight plaintiffs, all movie studios, sought an injunction against the distribution of DeCSS, a program capable of decrypting video content that had been encrypted by the Content Scramble System, which was commonly used to protect DVDs from unauthorized copying. DeCSS was developed by Norwegian teenager Jon Johansen and released in October 1999 via LiViD, a mailing list focused on producing programming tools and software libraries relevant to DVD use on the Linux operating system. DeCSS was distributed by LiViD and other Internet communities without authorization from the DVD Copy Control Association, the trade organization responsible for DVD copy protection.

== District court proceedings ==
In January 2000, the movie studios filed suit under the title Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes at the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The defendants were Eric Corley (publisher of &quot;2600: The Hacker Quarterly&quot; magazine, which copied the DeCSS code for its readers), Shawn Reimerdes (who had posted the code on dvd-copy.com, a personal website), Roman Kazan (who ran an Internet hosting service that provided access to DeCSS), and 2600 Enterprises, Inc. The studios claimed that the defendants, by making DeCSS available, were trafficking in circumvention devices, an illegal act under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The studios sought an injunction that would prohibit the distribution and use of the DeCSS program, as well as monetary damages.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the district court granted a preliminary injunction barring the defendants from posting the code for DeCSS. The court felt this precaution was necessary given that the movie studios made a reasonable argument that widespread dissemination of DeCSS would cause irreparable harm to their interests. Reimerdes and Kazan then entered into consent decrees with the plaintiffs and were subsequently dropped from the suit. Both were then barred from posting the DeCSS code or providing links to sites where the code could be found.

Corley removed the DeCSS code from 2600.com after the preliminary injunction was issued, but did not reach a settlement of his own with the plaintiffs and remained a defendant in the suit. In what Corley termed an act of &quot;electronic civil disobedience,&quot; 2600.com continued to host links to other websites that themselves provided the source code for DeCSS. Corley also moved for the court to overturn the Digital Millennium Copyright Act altogether as a violation of the First Amendment, because it restricted citizens from distributing and discussing programming code, which in turn is an item of expression.

In August 2000, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. Kaplan acknowledged the tension in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act between copyright holders and those who wish to use new technologies, but concluded that the language of the act provided relief for the plaintiffs against unauthorized copying of their copyrighted works. In Kaplan&#x27;s words, &quot;For now, at least, Congress has resolved this clash in the DMCA and in plaintiffs&#x27; favor. Given the peculiar characteristics of computer programs for circumventing encryption and other access control measures, the DMCA as applied to posting and linking here does not contravene the First Amendment.&quot;

Judge Kaplan also held that the Corley and 2600.com had violated the DMCA by continuing to post the code that ran afoul of the act&#x27;s anti-circumvention provisions. Kaplan issued another injunction against Corley, prohibiting him from posting the DeCSS code or providing links to sites where the code could be found.

Corley appealed this ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

== Circuit court ruling ==
Corley&#x27;s appeal at the Second Circuit, now under the name Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Corley because Shawn Reimerdes had been removed as a defendant, received numerous &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs from both the entertainment industry and supporters of Internet innovations.

In November 2001, the Second Circuit upheld Kaplan&#x27;s ruling at the lower court. However, the circuit court found merit in Corley&#x27;s view that computer programs are a form of protected speech regardless of whether they are in source code or object code form, which commentators regarded as significant. The circuit court opined that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act could be subjected to intermediate scrutiny as a partial restriction on free speech. Citing the Supreme Court precedent &quot;Hill v. Colorado&quot;, the circuit court held that some laws can restrict speech for reasons that are &quot;justified without reference to the content&quot; if there are larger public benefits from the speech restrictions. Hence, due to the conflict with the DMCA in the present case, DeCSS was held to be a form of speech but it could be restricted due to its functionality (anti-circumvention that is prohibited per the DMCA) and not its content.

The circuit court also considered Corley&#x27;s fair use defense, as Corley argued that DeCSS allowed users to watch encrypted DVDs, which prior to that point had been impossible on Linux machines. The circuit court held that the specific facts of the present case were beyond the types of fair use that are permissible under the DMCA. According to the court, &quot;the Appellants do not claim to be making fair use of any copyrighted materials, and nothing in the injunction prohibits them from making such fair use. They are barred from trafficking in a decryption code that enables unauthorized access to copyrighted materials.&quot;

== Impact and subsequent developments ==
Both the district and circuit court rulings were controversial, and have been widely criticized by free speech advocates such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, as well as the American Library Association, the author of &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, and others, due to upholding legal restrictions on expressive programming code. On the other hand, some media and content-owning organizations, such as the National Football League and Major League Baseball, supported the decisions.

Corley initially planned to appeal the circuit court decision to the Supreme Court, but decided not to after consultation with his lawyers. Despite the courts&#x27; rulings, the DeCSS code is still widely available on the Internet.

<doc id="1102758" wikidata="Q945069" url="?curid=1102758" title="Sonnets from the Portuguese">
<text>Sonnets from the Portuguese, written and published first in 1850, is a collection of 44 love sonnets written by Elizabeth Barrett Browning. The collection was acclaimed and popular during the poet&#x27;s lifetime and it remains so today. Despite what the title implies, the sonnets are entirely Browning&#x27;s own, and not translated from Portuguese.

The first line of Sonnet 43 has become one of the most famous in English poetry: &quot;How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.&quot;

==Title==
Barrett Browning was initially hesitant to publish the poems, believing they were too personal. However, her husband Robert Browning insisted they were the best sequence of English-language sonnets since Shakespeare&#x27;s time and urged her to publish them. To offer the couple some privacy, she decided to publish them as if they were translations of foreign sonnets. She initially planned to title the collection &quot;Sonnets translated from the Bosnian&quot;, but Robert Browning proposed that she claim their source was Portuguese, probably because of her admiration for Camões and Robert&#x27;s nickname for her: &quot;my little Portuguese&quot;. The title is also a reference to &quot;Les Lettres Portugaises&quot; (1669).

==Numbers 33 and 43==
The most famous poems from the collection are numbers 33 and 43:

===Number 33===
===Number 43===


== In popular culture ==
The first line of Sonnet 43 has been used in a number of titles and works.

<text>Intermediate Perl is a book about the Perl programming language by Randal L. Schwartz, brian d foy and Tom Phoenix, published in 2006 by O&#x27;Reilly Media. It was released as a retitled second edition of &quot;Learning Perl Objects, References &amp; Modules&quot; () by Schwartz and Phoenix, published by O&#x27;Reilly Media in 2003 to favorable reviews. A second edition of &quot;Intermediate Perl&quot; was released in 2012.

&quot;Intermediate Perl&quot; is a follow-up to &quot;Learning Perl&quot;. Just as &quot;Learning Perl&quot; features a llama on its cover, its follow-up features an alpaca. For this reason, they are sometimes referred to as, respectively, &quot;the llama book&quot; and &quot;the alpaca book&quot;.

This book is written in very much the same style as its predecessor. It picks up right where &quot;Learning Perl&quot; left off, and takes the reader from the most basic features of Perl references all the way through to creating Perl modules and distributing them to CPAN.

<text>Herbert Romulus O&#x27;Conor (November 17, 1896March 4, 1960) was an American lawyer serving as the 51st Governor of Maryland from 1939 to 1947. He also served in the United States Senate, representing Maryland from 1947 to 1953. He was a Democrat.

O&#x27;Conor was born in Baltimore, Maryland to James P. A. O&#x27;Conor and Mary Ann (Galvin) O&#x27;Conor. He received his B.A. degree from Loyola College and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1920. While in school, O&#x27;Conor was a reporter for the Baltimore Sun and Baltimore Evening Sun from 1919 to 1920. On November 24, 1920, O&#x27;Conor married Mary Eugenia Byrnes (1896–1971) and they had five children, Herbert R. Jr., Eugene F., James Patrick, Robert and Mary Patricia.

From 1921 to 1922, O&#x27;Conor served as the assistant State&#x27;s Attorney of Baltimore. In 1923, he was elected State&#x27;s Attorney of Baltimore City, and served there until he was elected as the Attorney General of Maryland in 1934. O&#x27;Conor also served in the National Association of Attorneys General in 1937. His secretary, Camilla Conroy, died in the burning of the luxury liner &quot;SS Morro Castle&quot; in 1934. O&#x27;Conor identified her body which was found floating face down close to the wreck site.

O&#x27;Conor was elected as Governor of Maryland in 1938, defeating incumbent Republican governor Harry W. Nice. In doing so, he became the first Roman Catholic of Irish descent to serve in that position. As governor, O&#x27;Conor created the Maryland Council of Defense during the Second World War. He also worked towards improving the state transportation system, and worked towards the construction of new bridges over the Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers. He also worked with other states to encourage inter-state cooperation, and served in positions including the Chairman of the Governor&#x27;s Conference in 1941, and the President of the Council of State Government in 1943.

Near the end of World War II, O&#x27;Conor sought to improve the effects of the War and founded the Commission on Post War Reconstruction and Development. He also sought to improve the Maryland healthcare system.

O&#x27;Conor was elected to the United States Senate in 1946, but chose not to run for re-election in 1952. In the Senate, O&#x27;Conor served as chairman of the Special Committee on Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce from May to September, 1951, during the Eighty-first Congress. After his tenure in the Senate, he continued the practice of law in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., until his death in Baltimore. He is interred in New Cathedral Cemetery.

<doc id="1102777" wikidata="Q377099" url="?curid=1102777" title="Henri Donnedieu de Vabres">
<text>Henri Donnedieu de Vabres (; 8 July 1880 – 14 February 1952) was a French jurist who took part in the Nuremberg trials after World War II and a president of the AIDP. He was the primary French judge during the proceedings, with Robert Falco as his alternate.

Donnedieu was born in Nîmes to a Protestant and bourgeois family. Prior to the war, he had campaigned for the concept of an International Criminal Court while serving as a professor of criminal law at the University of Paris. He continued to serve as a law professor in Vichy France. He also became director of the Paris Institute of Criminology. Later in 1947, he would again submit his idea before the United Nations&#x27; Committee on the Progressive Development of International Law and its Codification.

In 1935 Donnedieu accepted an invitation to Berlin from Hans Frank, Hitler&#x27;s personal lawyer and later Governor-General of occupied Poland. They debated the idea of an international criminal court. 

Donnedieu was the only one of the trial judges who was not a professional judge; this is likely because judges under the Vichy regime would have had to swear allegiance to the regime, whereas Donnedieu as a professor did not. During the trials, Donnedieu was noted for protesting against the charges of &quot;Conspiracy to Wage War&quot; as he felt it was too broad to be served in such a monumental trial. As a corollary of this view, he strongly protested against the conviction of Colonel-General Alfred Jodl, stating that it was a miscarriage of justice for the professional soldier to be convictedwhen he held no allegiance to Nazism. Jodl was later exonerated posthumously by a German court, citing Donnedieu&#x27;s statement. On 28 February 1953, a West German denazification court declared Jodl not guilty of breaking international law. This not guilty declaration was revoked on 3 September 1953, by the Minister of Political Liberation for Bavaria. His trial secretary was Yves Beigbeder.

Donnedieu was also the one to suggest that a firing squad might be a more honourable way to execute those found guiltythough that was strongly contested by Francis Biddle and Iona Nikitchenko.

Along with Raphael Lemkin (the Academic who devised the term &quot;genocide&quot; in his 1944 book &quot;Axis Rule in Occupied Europe&quot;) and Vespasian V. Pella, he was consulted by John Peters Humphrey to prepare the United Nations Secretariat Draft for the Convention on the Prevention of Genocide.

Donnedieu died in Paris in 1952.

Donnedieu&#x27;s son, Jean Donnedieu de Vabres, joined Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s government early and served as his &quot;chargé de mission&quot; in his cabinet from 1944 to 1946. His grandson Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres served as France&#x27;s Minister of Culture from 2004 to 2007.

<doc id="1102780" wikidata="Q476721" url="?curid=1102780" title="Vishera (Perm Krai)">
<text>The Vishera () is a river in Perm Krai, Russia, a left bank tributary of the Kama. It is long, and its drainage basin covers . The Vishera freezes in late October or early November and stays under the ice until the end of April. There are diamond deposits in the basin of the Vishera.

The Vishera used to be part of the Cherdyn Route and is still considered one of the most picturesque rivers of the Urals. It starts on the extreme northeast of Perm Krai, near the border with the Komi Republic and Sverdlovsk Oblast. It flows on the west foothills of Ural Mountains and is a mountain river for most of its length. There are many rapids and shoals in the channel and many rocks along its banks. 

The Vishera Nature Reserve is along the upper reaches of the river.
== Geography ==

=== Main tributaries ===
Main tributaries (from source to mouth):
* Left: Niols, Moyva, Vels, Uls, Akchim, Yazva, Vizhaikha;
* Right: Lypya, Yelma, Bolshaya Vaya, Pisanka, Govorukha, Kolva.

== Etymology ==
Komi people call the river &quot;Viser&quot;. Experts in the Komi language noticed that this element is also in names of other rivers in Ural. A. K. Matveyev supposes that Vishera can mean &quot;Northern River&quot; or &quot;Midnight River&quot; (in Sami languages).

<text>Nicholas Valensi (born January 16, 1981) is an American musician, best known for his role as lead and rhythm guitarist in the American rock band The Strokes. Since 2001, the band has released six studio albums, some of which Valensi has also contributed keyboard and backing vocals to. 

In 2013, Valensi founded the band CRX, for which he acts as singer, songwriter, and lead and rhythm guitarist. Their debut album, &quot;New Skin&quot;, was released in 2016, and was followed by the 2019 album &quot;Peek&quot;. Valensi has also worked as a songwriter and session guitarist with various artists, including Sia, Regina Spektor, Kate Pierson, Kesha and Ringo Starr.

==Early life==
Valensi was born in New York City, to a Tunisian father and a French mother, Danielle. His mother was from a Catholic family in South Western France, near Bordeaux, and his father was a Tunisian Jew. Valensi&#x27;s mother had moved to Boston as a teenager and met his father in New York; his mother converted to Judaism to marry his father.

Valensi was raised on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with two sisters, Céline and Alessandra. Until the age of 16, Valensi spent summers at his grandfather&#x27;s home near Bordeaux. He began learning guitar at the age of five, following an impromptu strum on one of his father&#x27;s guitars. His father described him as a natural guitarist, due to his quickness at picking up the ability to strum along with the rhythm of songs at a young age. Valensi&#x27;s father died when Nick was nine. Valensi was arrested at age 11 and was assigned a probation officer for a year.

Valensi attended New York City public schools while growing up. He began attending The Dwight School at age 13, where he met Julian Casablancas on the first day of the school&#x27;s orientation program. Soon after, he met classmate Fabrizio Moretti and the three formed a band. He was once quoted as saying, &quot;I always thought I wanted to be able to play any song you could name. But once I started playing with Julian, that&#x27;s when I really started to understand music.&quot; Through Casablancas, Valensi also met Nikolai Fraiture during this time. The two later attended Hunter College together.

== Career ==

=== The Strokes ===

In the late 1990s, Valensi was part of an informal band with vocalist Casablancas and drummer Moretti in high school, and continued after he and Casablancas left Dwight. Nikolai Fraiture started playing as the bassist and the band was formed when guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. joined in fall 1998. Their first show as The Strokes was at the Spiral in New York City on September 14, 1999. The band released The Modern Age EP in 2001 under Rough Trade Records and was signed for a five-album record deal by RCA Records. The band released six LPs including &quot;Is This It&quot;, &quot;Room on Fire&quot;, &quot;First Impressions of Earth&quot;, &quot;Angles&quot;, &quot;Comedown Machine and The New Abnormal&quot; with tours and festival sets in the North America, Europe, South America, East Asia and Australia. Following the completion of their album contract deal with RCA Records in 2013, the band has continued to release new music through Casablancas&#x27; Cult Records.

=== CRX ===

In 2013, Valensi co-founded the Los Angeles-based rock band CRX. He is the frontman of the group, and is backed by drummer Ralph Alexander, multi-instrumentalist Brad Oberhofer, bassist Jon Safley, and guitarist Darian Zahedi. The band released their debut album, &quot;New Skin&quot;, on October 28, 2016. This was followed by the 2019 record &quot;Peek&quot;. Valensi has described the band&#x27;s sound as a mix of power pop and heavy metal, and has named The Cars, Cheap Trick and Elvis Costello as influences.

===Other projects===
While much of his career has been focused on playing and writing for The Strokes and CRX, Valensi has also contributed as a session musician and songwriter to some of his contemporaries. One of his first notable credits was playing guitar for Regina Spektor&#x27;s song &quot;Better,&quot; which was released on her 2006 album &quot;Begin to Hope&quot; and also published as a single in a slightly different version on which the guitar parts are rearranged.

He has collaborated with artists Devendra Banhart, The Stroke&#x27;s Moretti, and Sia on multiple occasions. Nick Valensi sang backing vocals and played guitar for Devendra Banhart&#x27;s song &quot;Shabop Shalom&quot; on the 2007 album &quot;Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon&quot;. Furthermore, he contributed backing vocals on the self-titled debut album of his bandmate Fab Moretti&#x27;s band, Little Joy. He appears in the video for &quot;No One&#x27;s Better Sake&quot; by Little Joy as drummer. He also appears in the video for &quot;Adam &amp; Steve,&quot; a song by Devendra Banhart and Moretti&#x27;s side project Megapuss.

He plays guitar on Sia&#x27;s album 2010 &quot;We Are Born&quot; and has also written several hooks and melodies on it. Sia has also stated that she and Valensi are planning to write songs together for other artists. He also co-wrote the track &quot;Hostage&quot; on Sia&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;1000 Forms of Fear&quot;. Other credits include co-writing with Brody Dalle in 2014, Kate Pierson for her 2015 album &quot;Guitars and Microphones,&quot; Kesha, and again with Sia for the 2017 Blondie track, &quot;Best Day Ever.&quot;

==Instruments and influences==

Valensi&#x27;s main guitar, which he uses for nearly every live show and recorded song, is a 1995 Epiphone Riviera with Gibson P-94 pick-ups, which was given to him by friend and fellow Strokes guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. In a 2004 interview with Epiphone, he called it &quot;the greatest guitar never made&quot; because Gibson had never produced a semi-hollow with humbucker-sized P-94 pickups. He has several models in different colours (all with P-94s), including multiple naturals, one in vintage sunburst, one in red, and a 12-string elite in red. In 2005, Epiphone released a signature model of his guitar, the Elitist Nick Valensi Riviera P-94, and followed it up with a standard model Nick Valensi Riviera P-94 in 2007. Back-up/warm-up guitars include an Epiphone Dot fitted with 2 P-94s, an Epiphone Casino, an Epiphone Sheraton, and a Gibson Faded Special Double Cutaway with 2 P-90s. Valensi often borrows fellow Strokes guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr.&#x27;s backup guitars, which include a Gibson Les Paul Jr. and a Les Paul Special. New guitars used for the First Impressions of Earth tour include a Les Paul Custom in black, a Fender Telecaster Custom (which he can be seen using in the music video for Under Cover of Darkness ), and a Duesenberg semi-hollow. Valensi&#x27;s main amplifier is a 2x12&quot; Fender Hot Rod DeVille, used with Fender 4x12&quot; extension cabinets during live shows. He also recently purchased a Carr amplifier to use on the last few stops of the First Impressions tour.

His pedalboard has included the Visual Sound Jekyll &amp; Hyde Ultimate overdrive pedal, Boss TR-2 Tremolo, Vox Cooltron Bulldog Distortion, MXR Micro Amp, Boss TU-2 Chromatic Tuner, Electro-Harmonix Memory Man, and Boss Blues Driver. He uses a Fender Super-Sonic 100-watt head into two Fender 2x12&quot; cabinets.

He cites his influences as The Velvet Underground, The Cars, George Harrison, Slash, Bob Marley, and Blondie.

== Personal life ==
In summer 2006, Valensi married his girlfriend of five years, English photographer and television personality Amanda de Cadenet. With De Cadenet, Valensi has fraternal twins, Silvan and Ella. He has a step-daughter, Atlanta, through de Cadenet&#x27;s first marriage. De Cadenet published a book of photographs entitled &quot;Rare Birds&quot; in 2005, which includes several pictures of Valensi, whom she refers to as her &quot;muse&quot; on her website. Valensi has lived with his family in Los Angeles since the mid-2000s. In the past, they have lived in the neighborhoods of Van Nuys and Studio City in Los Angeles and in Midtown Manhattan and Park Slope in New York City.

Valensi speaks French.

<doc id="1102801" wikidata="Q707980" url="?curid=1102801" title="Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres">
<text>Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres (; born 13 March 1954 in Neuilly-sur-Seine), often known as RDDV, is a French politician, France&#x27;s Minister of Culture from 2004 to 2007. He is a member of the UMP center-right party, and the grandson of Henri Donnedieu de Vabres.

==Biography==
Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres has a degree in economics, and a diploma from the Paris Institute of Political Studies, a traditional starting point for attending the École nationale d&#x27;administration (ENA), a school for high-level civil servants, which he entered in 1978.

After graduating in 1980 from ENA, he started his career in the prefectoral administration as a sub-prefect, chief of staff of the Indre-et-Loire prefect, then was secretary-general for the police in the Centre region (1980–1981), secretary-general of the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence prefecture (1981–1982), sub-prefect of the Château-Thierry &quot;arrondissement&quot; (1982–1985).

==Political career==
From 1986 to 2001 he was regional councillor in the Centre region, president of the UDF group and reporter for the budget (1986–1993).

He began his national political career as an aide to François Léotard when the latter was Minister of Culture (1987–1988) in the government of then prime minister Jacques Chirac, then as chief of staff in the Republican Party, then one of the components of the UDF. Starting from 1990, he became a member of the political bureau of the party, then delegate-general from 1995 to 1997.

From 1993 to 1995, he was an aide to François Léotard, Minister of Defence in the government of then prime minister Édouard Balladur. Within this role, he participated in the negotiation of an important sale of two anti-air frigates to Saudi Arabia by a company affiliated with the Ministry; the contract, for approximately 19 billion French francs, was signed on 19 November 1994. There were suspicions that this contract generated massive kickbacks for the funding of the Republican Party and, as a consequence, a complex judicial enquiry was started. Finally, on 16 February 2004, the correctional court of Paris convicted Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres of money laundering, with a €15,000 fine. He was not, however, deprived of the right to run for office.

During the 1995 presidential election, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres was in the campaign team of Édouard Balladur. In March 2001, he was the right-wing candidate in the municipal election in Tours in March 2001, but he was beaten by the outgoing PS mayor, Jean Germain.

From 1997 to 2002 he was deputy to the National Assembly for the first constituency of Indre-et-Loire, from the UDF center-right party. In 1999, he voted against the PACS, a domestic partnership law aimed at enabling homosexuals to form legal couples. During the 2002 presidential election, he distanced himself from the UDF leader François Bayrou and supported Jacques Chirac&#x27;s reelection bid. At the ensuing legislative election, he was reelected deputy.

On 7 May 2002, he was appointed delegate minister for European affairs in the government of Jean-Pierre Raffarin, a position that he quit in the 16 June cabinet reshuffle as a result of the announcement of the aforementioned criminal investigation in the financial affairs of the Republican Party. He became deputy secretary general of the UMP party, the party supporting Jacques Chirac, then spokesperson in 2003.

Despite his 16 February 2004, conviction, he was, on 31 March, appointed Minister of Culture and communication in the third cabinet of prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, and was kept at this position on 2 June 2005, for the government of Dominique de Villepin.

In 2005, he rose to fame by defending the controversial DADVSI copyright bill before the French parliament, resulting in a variety of criticism against him from both the opposition and members of his own party. On this occasion, president of the National Assembly Jean-Louis Debré, a fellow UMP member, is reported to have declared that Donnedieu de Vabres was &quot;a zero who put us in the shit and, from the start, dragged us into an adventure&quot;. Because of his staunch support for the law, he is the target of a campaign of Google bombing mapping &quot;ministre blanchisseur&quot; (&quot;laundering minister&quot;) to a press article about his conviction.

Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres ran unsuccessfully in the 2007 legislative elections.

<text>Darwinia is a 2005 real-time tactics and real-time strategy video game for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It is the second game developed by Introversion Software, and is set within a computer environment that simulates artificial intelligence. It received favourable reviews and won three awards at the 2006 Independent Games Festival. A multiplayer sequel, &quot;Multiwinia&quot;, was released for Windows in 2008. &quot;Darwinia&quot; and &quot;Multiwinia&quot; were released together as Darwinia+ for the Xbox 360 in 2010.

==Plot==
&quot;Darwinia&quot; was created as a digital theme world for artificially intelligent polygons by Dr. Sepulveda. Housed in a massive network of surplus Protologic 68000 machines from the 1980s, Darwinia is a world where the single-poly Darwinians, with their simple, but growing AI, can grow and evolve. Darwinia is also where the world can visit to see them frolicking in their natural, fractal habitat. A Darwinian lives a life working and growing, until the eventual death of the Darwinian, which releases their digital soul to later be reincarnated.

However, the player arrives in the midst of an emergency. Darwinia has been infected by a computer virus, and Sepulveda is in near panic, watching decades of research being corrupted and being used up. Sepulveda enlists the player, a curious hacker who stumbled across Darwinia by accident, to aid him in rescuing the Darwinians and drive off the computer virus. The player is given access to the combat programs, simple tools that originally began as mini-games. These are now the only means of attack against the virus. As the player progresses, it soon becomes clear this is not enough, and that triggers the third aspect of the gameplay, which is evolution.

The first two levels of the video game act as an introduction and allow the player to familiarize themselves with the controls. After that, Dr. Sepulveda begins assigning tasks that span several levels to achieve a long-term objective. The first task involves clearing the virus population from and reactivating the Mines and Power Generator to provide resources for the Construction Yard. Once done, the Yard begins producing armored units, allowing the player to move on. The next task involves the reincarnation of Darwinians: the Soul Repository in the center of Darwinia collects the floating souls, and sends them down to the Receiver, where the Darwinians gather them and send them to the Pattern Buffer to be reprogrammed with the main Darwinian blueprint code, where they are sent to the Biosphere to be reborn. The player must clear the Viruses from all the facilities and reactivate them.

In the final level of the game, Sepulveda traces the Viral infection back to its source, which is e-mail spam. After Sepulveda had accidentally flashed an image of his face across the skies of Darwinia, The Darwinians had assumed him to be God. They then re-aligned a portal inside Darwinia in an attempt to communicate with God. The Darwinians managed to access Sepulveda&#x27;s computer, downloading several files and eventually downloading the Spam. The e-mails were infected with a very nasty strain of internet virus which corrupted the Darwinians. The player is tasked to destroying the few remaining e-mails.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Darwinia&quot; mixes elements from strategy, action, puzzle, hacker and God games alike, meaning that it does not fall under a specific video game genre. The player has the ability to run several programs through the Task Manager, similar to units used in many real-time strategy games. Research allows the player to upgrade programs and weapons, which is critical as the enemy develops. Mission objectives are given at each location/level, as the player and the Darwinians attempt to wipe out the Viruses.

==Development==
&quot;Darwinia&quot; was inspired by the theme of the first Indie Game Jam, where a group of programmers experimented with generating tens of thousands of sprites on screen at once. Introversion began prototyping a war game with more units on screen than had ever been done at that point. After months of iteration and development, this coalesced into the gameplay for &quot;Darwinia&quot;.

The initial beta testing of &quot;Darwinia&quot; began on 27 August 2004, and the beta testing of the full game started on 26 November, the same year. A demo level of &quot;Darwinia&quot; was released 3 months later on 21 January, and can be downloaded from the &quot;Darwinia&quot; website. &quot;Darwinia&quot; was released in Europe on 4 March 2005 (the U.S. version followed on 12 June 2006), while the Macintosh version was released 30 March 2005 by publisher Ambrosia Software. A patch was released on 28 April 2005 for Microsoft Windows, bringing the version to 1.2. New features included an improved unit selection system, as well as numerous modding updates including the ability to create custom strings. Another patch (version 1.3) was released in September 2005, which includes the option (enabled by default) of clicking icons or using keyboard shortcuts to create units instead of using the gesture system. A new demo, using features of the above-mentioned version 1.3 patch and an entirely new level &quot;Launchpad&quot; not in the full game, was released in September 2005.

&quot;Darwinia&quot; was released on Steam on 14 December 2005. This helped solve some of Introversion&#x27;s distribution problems, and allowed for localized versions to be developed; a German translation was included with the Steam release. A new patch was released on 10 March 2006 bringing the version up to 1.42 and adding difficulty settings ranging from 1 to 10. Higher difficulties increase the number, speed, and health of monsters. It also increases the speed of the player&#x27;s own units. eGames-owned Cinemaware on 4 April 2006 issued a press release announcing they would bring &quot;Darwinia&quot; to US markets in June 2006. Beta testing signups for version 1.5.x started on 15 December 2006. A Windows Vista exclusive version of &quot;Darwinia&quot; with extra eye candy and 3 additional levels was released on 31 January 2007. Version 1.5.1.1 patch released on 18 June 2007, providing support for DirectX 9c, including extra eye candy and the &quot;Launchpad&quot; level.

In 2010 in context of a Bundle sale the source code of the game was made available for purchase under a non-open-source license.

On April 18, 2022, the remastered version of &quot;Darwinia&quot; was released via an update for Steam and GOG releases to celebrate its &quot;10000th anniversary&quot;. The remaster includes updated graphics, numerous bugfixes, support of surround sound up to 7.1 and the Steam integration, native support of Steam Deck included.

==&quot;Darwinia+&quot;==
&quot;Darwinia+&quot; is the version of &quot;Darwinia&quot; for the Xbox 360, released on the Xbox Live Arcade on 11 February 2010. It includes updated versions of both &quot;Darwinia&quot; and &quot;Multiwinia&quot;. This was Introversion Software&#x27;s first venture onto a video game console.

==Reception==

&quot;Darwinia&quot; and &quot;Darwinia+&quot; were positively received by critics, garnering &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to Metacritic. The PC version won the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at IGF 2006, as well as the Technical Excellence and Innovation in Visual Art awards. New Age Gaming magazine awarded the game a score of 97, its highest ever as of June 2007, and an Editor&#x27;s Choice award. It scored 90% from &quot;PC Gamer&quot; UK and reached number 21 on its &#x27;Top 100 PC Games&#x27; list. PC Review described it as &quot;one game that simply has to be played&quot;.

===Awards===

&quot;Darwinia&quot; won &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s 2005 &quot;Special Achievement in Creativity&quot; award. The editors wrote, &quot;Part RTS game, part sandbox, part Sea Monkeys — &quot;Darwinia&quot;″s retro-cool is backed up with intense and often surprising strategic moments.&quot; It was nominated for Best Game in the GameShadow Innovation in Games Awards 2006 and listed in &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Seif Adnan Kanaan (died 22 October 2004) was an Iraqi citizen who was abducted in Iraq and beheaded on 22 October 2004. The reason given by the kidnappers, the Army of Ansar Al-Sunna, was that he was employed by the United States Army.

==Murder==
On 22 October 2004, a video was posted on the website of the Army of Ansar Al-Sunna, apparently showed the beheading of Kanaan. Kanaan was shown in a picture surrounded by the three hooded gunmen with a banner of the Army of Ansar Al-Sunna in the background. They accused him of being an American spy recruited in Mosul. In the video the man makes a statement: &quot;My name is Seif Adnan Kanaan. I work at Mosul airport... My second job is to supply beverages to the US army&quot;.

One of the gunmen then reads a statement saying that &quot;the mujahedeen (Islamic fighters) in Mosul were able to capture ... a crusader spy recruited by US forces to spy and inform on the mujahedeen in Mosul.&quot; The gunman said the purported spy worked at a US base in Mosul airport and &quot;was known for his allegiance to the Americans and his hatred for the mujahedeen.&quot; He had &quot;publicly insulted (Islam&#x27;s) Prophet Mohammed...We tell people like him: the door of repentance is open... Announce your repentance and live in peace among your kin,&quot; the gunman said. He then warned that &quot;The mujahedeen will catch those who persist in working with US forces, and settle for nothing less than beheading them.&quot;

Kanaak was beheaded after &quot;confessing to all the actions he carried out.&quot; The group also posted the statement on its website, accompanied by pictures of the beheading. The video showed the man who read the statement later beheading the victim with a knife. He placed the head on the back of the victim, who lay in a pool of blood. The man had been killed &quot;to serve as a lesson for others,&quot; the murderer said.

<text>In formal language theory, a noncontracting grammar is in Kuroda normal form if all production rules are of the form:
:&quot;AB&quot; → &quot;CD&quot; or
:&quot;A&quot; → &quot;BC&quot; or
:&quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; or
:&quot;A&quot; → &quot;a&quot;

where A, B, C and D are nonterminal symbols and &quot;a&quot; is a terminal symbol. Some sources omit the &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; pattern.

It is named after Sige-Yuki Kuroda, who originally called it a linear bounded grammar, a terminology that was also used by a few other authors thereafter.

Every grammar in Kuroda normal form is noncontracting, and therefore, generates a context-sensitive language. Conversely, every noncontracting grammar that does not generate the empty string can be converted to Kuroda normal form.

A straightforward technique attributed to György Révész transforms a grammar in Kuroda normal form to a context-sensitive grammar: &quot;AB&quot; → &quot;CD&quot; is replaced by four context-sensitive rules &quot;AB&quot; → &quot;AZ&quot;, &quot;AZ&quot; → &quot;WZ&quot;, &quot;WZ&quot; → &quot;WD&quot; and &quot;WD&quot; → &quot;CD&quot;. This proves that every noncontracting grammar generates a context-sensitive language.

There is a similar normal form for unrestricted grammars as well, which at least some authors call &quot;Kuroda normal form&quot; too:
:&quot;AB&quot; → &quot;CD&quot; or
:&quot;A&quot; → &quot;BC&quot; or
:&quot;A&quot; → &quot;a&quot; or
:&quot;A&quot; → &quot;ε&quot;

where ε is the empty string. Every unrestricted grammar is weakly equivalent to one using only productions of this form.

If the rule AB → CD is eliminated from the above, one obtains context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form. The Penttonen normal form (for unrestricted grammars) is a special case where first rule above is &quot;AB&quot; → &quot;AD&quot;. Similarly, for context-sensitive grammars, the Penttonen normal form, also called the one-sided normal form (following Penttonen&#x27;s own terminology) is:

:&quot;AB&quot; → &quot;AD&quot; or
:&quot;A&quot; → &quot;BC&quot; or
:&quot;A&quot; → &quot;a&quot;

For every context-sensitive grammar, there exists a weakly equivalent one-sided normal form.

<text>Fairbanks, Morse and Company was an American manufacturing company in the late 19th and early 20th century. Founded in 1823 as a manufacturer of weighing scales, it later diversified into pumps, engines, windmills, coffee grinders, radios, farm tractors, feed mills, locomotives, and industrial supplies. It was purchased by the Penn-Texas conglomerate in 1958.

There are three separate corporate entities that could be considered successors to the company, none of which is a complete and direct descendant of the original company. All claim the heritage of Fairbanks Morse and Company: 
* Fairbanks Scales is a privately owned company in Kansas City, Missouri, that manufactures scales
* Fairbanks Morse Defense, a subsidiary company of Arcline Investment Management, is a company based in Beloit, Wisconsin, that manufactures and services engines
* Fairbanks Nijhuis is a part of Pentair Water in Kansas City, Kansas, and manufactures pumps

==Founding and early history==

Fairbanks Morse and Company began in 1823 when inventor Thaddeus Fairbanks opened an ironworks in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, to manufacture two of his patented inventions: a cast iron plow and a heating stove. In 1829 he started a hemp dressing business for which he built the machinery. Though unsuccessful in fabricating for fiber factories, another of Morse&#x27;s inventions, the platform scale, formed the basis for the later company. It was patented in June 1832, and a generation later, with his brother Erastus Fairbanks, the E. &amp; T. Fairbanks &amp; Company was selling thousands of scales, first in the United States, later in Europe, South America, and Imperial China. Fairbanks scales won 63 medals over the years in international competition.

In Wisconsin, former missionary Leonard Wheeler designed a durable windmill for pumping water, the Eclipse windmill. Wheeler set up shop in Beloit just after the Civil War. Soon half a million windmills dotted the landscape throughout the West and as far away as Australia. At about the same time, a Fairbanks &amp; Company employee, Charles Hosmer Morse, opened a Fairbanks office in Chicago, from which he expanded the company&#x27;s territory of operation and widened its product line. As part of this expansion, Morse brought Wheeler and his Eclipse Windmill pumps into business with the Fairbanks company. Morse later became a partner in the Fairbanks Company and by the end of the nineteenth century, it was known as Fairbanks Morse &amp; Company and was headquartered in Chicago. Canadian and American cities had branch dealerships, with Fairbanks first coming to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1876 and later opening a factory there.

==Market expansion==

In the late nineteenth century, business expanded in the Western United States, as did the company&#x27;s catalog. It grew to include typewriters, hand trucks, railway velocipedes, pumps, tractors, and a variety of warehouse and bulk shipping tools. The company became an industrial supplier distributing complete &quot;turn-key&quot; systems: tools, plumbing, gauges, gaskets, parts, valves, and pipe. Its 1910 catalog contained over 800 pages.

The Fairbanks Morse Company began producing oil and naptha engines in the 1890s with the purchase of the Charter line of engines (the first commercially available gas engine). They had the idea that an engine could be used as backup power for when one of their Eclipse windmills wasn&#x27;t getting wind. The Fairbanks Morse gas engine became a success with farmers. Electricity generation and oilfield work also used these engines. Small lighting plants built by the company were also popular. Fairbanks Morse power plants evolved by burning kerosene in 1893, coal gas in 1905, then to semi-diesel engines in 1913 and to full diesel engines in 1924. The Model N was popular in stationary industrial applications. 

In 1934, Fairbanks-Morse entered the radio business by acquiring the Audiola Radio Co. After a 1939 factory fire FM decided to exit the radio business. Fairbanks-Morse radios are well known for their colorfulness. The company also had brief forays into building automobiles, tractors, corn shellers, hammermills, cranes, televisions, and refrigerators, but output was small in these fields.

After the expiration of Rudolf Diesel&#x27;s American license in 1912, Fairbanks Morse (FM) entered the large engine business. The company&#x27;s larger Model Y semi-diesel became a standard workhorse, and sugar, rice, timber, and mine mills used the engine. The model Y was available in sizes from one through six cylinders, or 10 to . The Y-VA engine was the first high-compression, cold-start, full diesel developed by Fairbanks Morse without the acquisition of any foreign patent. This machine was developed in Beloit and introduced in 1924. The company expanded its line to the marine CO engine (Many 100 H.P. CO marine engines were used in the Philippine Islands to power ferry boats) as well as the mill model E, a modernized Y diesel. From this, Fairbanks-Morse became a major engine manufacturer and developed plants for railway and marine applications. The development of the diesel locomotive, tug, and ship in the 1930s fostered the expansion of the company.

==&quot;Z&quot; Engine Line==
Fairbanks-Morse renamed their headless Model to &quot;Z&quot; in July 1914, according to engine historian C.H. Wendel. On all &quot;Z&quot; engines the gasoline tank is located in the base. In 1917, they expanded the line to include more sizes. In 1918, they stopped making headless models and adapted the 1.5 H.P. to have a head, and larger H.P. engines could now run on Kerosene. In 1928 The &quot;Z&quot; style &quot;D&quot; was introduced, and was entirely enclosed. The Z was made in incremental sizes of 3, 6, 12, 15 and up to . Over a half million units were produced in the following 30 years. In the early 1980s the line was sold off to Bell. The model Z found favor with farmers, and is a collectable today.

==Marine diesel engines==
During World War I, a large order of 60 30 H.P. CO marine engines were installed in British decoy fishing ships to lure German submarines within range of their 6&quot; naval guns. In 1939 Fairbanks-Morse developed a marine engine using an unusual opposed piston (OP) design, similar in arrangement to a series of German Junkers aircraft diesels. The most common variant for submarines through the 1990s was the 38D 8-1/8 engine, ranging from 4 to 12 cylinders. This engine was delivered to the U.S. Navy in large numbers, often for use in fleet submarines, which used 9- or 10-cylinder versions as main engines in World War II. When the innovative but faulty EMD 16-338 &quot;pancake&quot; engines of the proved unworkable, they were replaced with World War II-style Fairbanks-Morse engines, and these remained standard on US diesel-powered submarines through the early 1960s. These and other Fairbanks-Morse OP engines were also used as backup power on US nuclear submarines through the of the 1990s. Fairbanks-Morse ranked 60th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts. The US Navy has had Fairbanks-Morse diesels in operation on its submarines almost continuously since 1938. They remain in service on -, &quot;Seawolf&quot;-, and nuclear submarines of the US Navy. In addition to OP engines (used in the USCGC &quot;Hamilton&quot; class), Fairbanks-Morse license builds Pielstick (used in the s and s), Alco (used in ), and M.A.N. design engines.

Other World War II era models are the 875 hp 5-cylinder Model 37E16 installed in some T1 tankers.

==Railroad locomotives==

Shortly after it won its first U.S. Navy contract, the company introduced its bore by stroke opposed piston diesel to the rail industry, installing the engine in various self-propelled railcars. This engine proved unreliable, and was superseded by a larger 5-cylinder bore by stroke engine that produced 800 hp and was installed in the OP800 railcars in 1939.

In 1935, F-M launched a long-term plan to build locomotives in-house. It hired electrical engineer John K. Stotz from Westinghouse Electric Corporation and began developing plans for a 1,000 hp switcher and a 2,000 hp multipurpose locomotive. While the company was ready to begin production of the units in 1940, the War Production Board (WPB) denied it permission, citing the national interest of F-M&#x27;s production of submarine engines and a locomotive market supplied by existing manufacturers. In 1943, the WPB approved F-M&#x27;s plans to sell locomotives, and it introduced the 1,000 hp switcher H-10-44 in 1944, followed by the 2,000 hp cab unit, dubbed the Erie-built for its outsourced assembly location, in late 1945. The early locomotives soon proved unreliable, as high-stress railroad service exposed weaknesses in the engine that had not been seen in less demanding marine applications. In 1947, F-M reorganized its locomotive division, hiring new managers and building a dedicated factory the following year.

In 1947, F-M introduced two new road switcher models, the 1,500 hp H-15-44 and the 2,000 hp H-20-44. In late 1949, the company&#x27;s new cab units, named the Consolidated Line, were introduced to replace the Erie-builts in its catalog. None of the late-1940s models sold as well as competing units from EMD and Alco, and the Consolidated Line fared particularly poorly as cab units fell out of favor on American railroads. In 1951 F-M began designing a new large locomotive, and in 1953 it introduced the 2,400 hp H-24-66 Train Master, then the highest-powered locomotive available. It also proved unpopular. In 1956, the Santa Fe ordered three specialized units, based on the H12-44, for terminal switching in Chicago&#x27;s Dearborn Station: the H12-44TS (&quot;TS&quot; for &quot;Terminal Switcher&quot;). They remained in service until the early 1970s.

In 1958, F-M built its last locomotive for the American market, followed in 1963 by its final delivery to a Mexican customer. In total, it sold 1,460 diesel locomotives.

==Post-war power products==
Fairbanks Morse continued to build diesel and gas engines, as it had been doing for the first half of the twentieth century. This is in addition to the pump and engine division, which produced Canadian Fairbanks Morse-branded products for farms, factories and mines.

Export offices were established in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; a factory was opened in Mexico, where model Z engines were built well into the 1980s. An Australian branch factory, similar to the Canadian Branch operation, was opened; remote sheep stations benefited from their products. It dated from 1902, when Cooper Sheep Shearing Machinery Ltd was set up in Sydney, and became an agent for Fairbanks Morse in that hemisphere.
The company sold and updated the Eclipse model of windmill pumps in North America until they became obsolete with widespread rural electrification in the 1940s. Low-cost electricity from the grid eliminated the need for local power production by small and medium diesel plants. While many Fairbanks Morse engines dutifully served into the late twentieth century, they could not compete with modernization, regional plant closures, and electricity.

An inter-family feud for control of the company in 1956 between the sons of Charles Morse weakened the company. Consequently, Fairbanks-Morse was merged with Penn-Western in 1958. The downhill slide continued for the next few decades, with assets being sold off, and branches of the company closed. Regional sales offices were closed, and the one-shop model no longer appealed to buyers in the new consumer age. Automakers, tractor makers, and locomotive builders made inroads into Fairbanks-Morse&#x27;s market share. Thus the company spiraled down, and was sold.

==Corporate disposition==
Fairbanks Morse and Company merged with Penn-Texas Corporation in 1958 to form Fairbanks Whitney Corporation. Fairbanks Whitney was reorganized as Colt Industries in 1964, taking the name from Colt Manufacturing, the maker of firearms and an asset of Penn-Texas. In 1988, the Fairbanks Morse Pump division was sold off to private investors to become Fairbanks Morse Pump. It was subsequently purchased by Pentair as part of an acquisition of General Signal Pump Group in 1997. In 1988, the scale business was sold off by Colt Industries and became Fairbanks Scales, still an independent company.

In 1990, Colt Industries sold its firearms business to C.F. Holdings Corp as Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company, Inc. and became Coltec Industries, Inc., which later became a subsidiary of EnPro Industires, Inc. EnPro was then the parent company of Fairbanks Morse Engine until January 21, 2020, when Fairbanks Morse was sold to Arcline Investment Management.

As a result, there are now three companies using either the Fairbanks or Fairbanks Morse trademarks, with lineage to the original Fairbanks Morse and Company. Fairbanks Scale and Fairbanks Morse Pump claim lineage back to E &amp; T Fairbanks Company.

==Modern descendants==
* In the 1990s, Fairbanks Morse merged with ALCO to make the FM | ALCO line. In October 2013, FM signed a joint development and licensing agreement with Achates Power to reduce emissions and fuel consumption of Fairbanks Morse proprietary and dual-fuel opposed-piston engines. The opposed-piston (OP) diesel engine once made by Fairbanks-Morse is still (August 2019) manufactured. Also, Fairbanks-Morse still (November 2021) manufactures large four-stroke diesel engines such as the FM 48/60 CR series, which ranges from 7,200 to 19,200 kWm in output.
* Fairbanks Scales has dropped the Morse from the name as most scales made by FM had.
* Fairbanks Nijhuis makes pumps.

<text>Gerardus Joseph&quot;Joop&quot;Zoetemelk (; born 3 December 1946) is a Dutch former professional racing cyclist. He started and finished the Tour de France 16 times, which were both records when he retired. He also holds the distance record in Tour de France history with 62,885 km ridden. He won the 1979 Vuelta a España and the 1980 Tour de France.

Besides winning the Tour de France he also finished the Tour in 8th, 5th, 4th (three times) and 2nd (six times) place for a total of eleven top 5 finishes which is a record. He was the first rider to wear the Tour de France&#x27;s polka dot jersey as the King of the Mountains and even though he never won this classification in the Tour de France, he did win it in the 1971 Vuelta a España and was considered one of the best climbers of his generation.

If not for a ten minute time penalty for a doping infraction in 1977, he would have finished in the top 5 in each of the first 12 Tours he entered.

He won the World Professional Road Championship in 1985 at the age of 38, with a late attack surprising the favorites of LeMond, Roche, Argentin and Millar. He completed a total of 16 World Championships which is notable considering more than half the field abandons nearly every World Championship and in addition to his win he has come in the top 10 seven other times. As of 2024, he is the oldest men&#x27;s individual road race world champion.

His record number of starts in the Tour de France was surpassed when George Hincapie started for the 17th time, but Hincapie was disqualified from three tours in October 2012, for doping offenses, giving the number of starts record back to Zoetemelk. Nobody other than Zoetemelk achieved sixteen Tour de France finishes until Sylvain Chavanel did so in the 2018 Tour de France. Currently, three riders have had more than 16 starts in the Tour de France, but no one has yet exceeded the record of finishing the event 16 times. He retired from the sport to run a hotel at Meaux, France.

== Early life and career ==
Zoetemelk was raised in Rijpwetering, the son of Maria and Gerard Zoetemelk. He started working as a carpenter. He became a speed-skater and a regional champion before turning to cycling in 1964. He joined the Swift club in Leiden and made a fast impression, winning youth races in his first season. He rode particularly well as a senior in multi-day races. He won the Tour of Yugoslavia, the Circuit des Mines, three stages and the mountains prize in the Tour of Austria, and the 1969 Tour de l&#x27;Avenir. He also won a gold medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City in the 100 km team time-trial with Fedor den Hertog, Jan Krekels and René Pijnen.

== Professional career ==
Zoetemelk turned professional for Briek Schotte&#x27;s Belgian Mars–Flandria team in 1970. Initially he was riding in support of team leader Roger De Vlaeminck, but the Belgian abandoned the race due to a crash near the end of the first week. Zoetemelk proved to be by far the strongest remaining rider on the team. Of his teammates who finished the race the highest placed was 69th, with the majority of others coming in the range of 80th to 100th place. While he admitted that Eddy Merckx was the strongest rider in the world in that year&#x27;s Tour de France, and was not challenging him for victory, he managed to finish on the podium in 2nd place and was the only rider to finish within 15:00 of Merckx during his first two Tour victories in 1969 and 1970.

He would wear the yellow jersey for the first time in the 1971 Tour de France, following a stage in which he, Luis Ocaña and Bernard Thévenet were able to drop Merckx for the first time. On stage 10 however, Ocaña stole the show in one of the most memorable attacks in Tour history taking the jersey from Zoetemelk and distancing all of the other favorites. On stage 14 Ocaña and Zoetemelk were involved in one of the most famous crashes in Tour history on the Col de Menté. Zoetemelk managed to survive the impact but Ocaña was seriously injured and had to be taken to the hospital. From that point on Merckx would lead the race and Zoetemelk would finish 2nd for the second consecutive year.

He wore the yellow jersey for the second time after winning the Prologue in the 1973 Tour de France, which took place in his home country of the Netherlands. He also picked up another stage win in that year&#x27;s edition.

Zoetemelk won Paris–Nice, the Semana Catalana and the Tour de Romandie in 1974. He then had a near-death experience during a violent crash, once again involving Luis Ocaña, except this time Zoetemelk had to be taken to the hospital as he crashed heavily into a car left unattended at the finish of the Midi Libre in Valras-Plage, France. He cracked his skull and came close to dying.

He returned the next season to win Paris–Nice again, and then caught meningitis. He never fully recovered and the head injury reduced his sense of taste. Nevertheless, he won 20 races that season, including Paris–Nice, the Tour of Holland and the Dwars door Lausanne and a stage of the Tour de France. He also came fourth in the 1975 Tour de France. During that year&#x27;s Tour he won stage 15 and finished strongly overall, placing behind only Thévenet, Merckx and Lucien Van Impe in a Tour where the next closest contenders were close to 20:00 or more behind the winner.

In the 1976 Tour de France he won stage 9 up Alp d&#x27;Huez by :03 in a hard-fought climb where he and Van Impe dropped all other riders and were alone crossing the finish. In stage 10 Zoetemelk once again won the stage, this time beating Van Impe and Thévenet by just one second, in the process coming within just seven seconds of the Yellow Jersey. On stage 14 however, Van Impe attacked and for all intents and purposes won the tour. Zoetemelk would win again on Stage 20 but he remained more than 4:00 behind Van Impe as every other rider was more than 12:00 back.

In the 1977 Tour de France he would have the worst Tour placing of his career up to that point, which was partially because he was penalized ten minutes and had a stage win revoked. He still finished in the Top 10 overall.

During the 1978 Tour de France he won stage 14 and going into the stage on Alp d&#x27;Huez Zoetemelk, Michel Pollentier and Tour debutant Bernard Hinault were separated from one another by only 0:18. At the end of the stage he led Hinault by +0:14 but was 2nd in the overall classification to Pollentier; however due to the Pollentier doping incident following the post-stage drug test, he took over the yellow jersey. He rode strongly and kept his narrow lead, which he would hold for several stages before losing it to Hinault on the final time trial.

In 1979 he rode the Vuelta a España for the second time in his career. He previously rode the 1971 edition where he placed 6th overall and won the King of the Mountains competition. He would win the 1979 edition.

In the 1979 Tour de France he survived the &quot;hell of the north&quot; cobbles of Roubaix on Stage 9, which is a notorious stage where several riders can get multiple flat tires and there are always many crashes. Zoetemelk survived with four other riders in the winning group, won 3:45 over the next finishers and moved into the yellow jersey, which he would hold for 6 stages. Following the stage 11 time trial it was a two-way battle between him and Hinault and it was possible that he would win the Vuelta-Tour Double.

Hinault steadily chipped away at Zoetemelk&#x27;s lead and then steadily built his lead over Zoetemelk while all other GC contenders were distanced further and further. Zoetemelk was able to drop Hinault on Alpe d&#x27;Huez and claim the stage win. He was able to take back just under a minute, but he needed to win by +3:00.

In the end Hinault would keep the lead and he and Zoetemelk finished nearly a half hour ahead of the rest of the field as Zoetemelk refused to give up and attacked on the final stage into Paris. It was not enough to break Hinault however as he took 2nd place on the podium for the 5th time.

The following year he was riding with a new team in TI–Raleigh, who was one of the strongest cycling teams in the world and they grew even stronger after signing Zoetemelk. At one point in this Tour TI–Raleigh won seven stages in a row, one of which was an ITT won by Zoetemelk where he gained 1:39 on Hinault and pulled within 0:21 of the overall lead prior to the first stages in the high mountains. Hinault withdrew and Zoetemelk remained the strongest rider in the Tour despite suffering a violent crash on Stage 16 which cut his arm and leg open. He would also claim another stage win during the final ITT winning the 1980 Tour de France by nearly 7:00 over Hennie Kuiper and Raymond Martin.

In 1981 he would finish 4th overall and he would finish 2nd for the 6th and final time during the 1982 Tour de France. While he was in his late 30s during his final Tours between 1982 and 1986 and was no longer a pre-race favorite he still remained the strongest GC general classification rider on his team and always had a respectable placing in the overall standings. Including in his final Tour, which he rode wearing the rainbow jersey as reigning World Champion and late in his career he was still good enough to win major races including the 1985 World Championship, Tirreno–Adriatico and the Amstel Gold Race.

Going into the 1985 World Championship the primary favorites were thought to include Bernard Hinault, Greg LeMond and being as it was thought the course could produce a sprint finish riders like Sean Kelly or even defending world champion Claude Criquielion. There were several early breakaways, but none of them included any riders considered threats to stay away and never extended their gap much beyond two minutes. There were two major crashes, both of which Zoetemelk managed to avoid but the second crash on lap 12 (of 18) allowed a breakaway to form with five riders including Jens Veggerby, Dominique Arnaud and Johan van der Velde. This group built up a gap of over two minutes before the surviving peloton began reeling them back in. Hinault had an off day, suffered a flat tire and abandoned the race, as did several other strong riders including Hennie Kuiper, Dietrich Thurau and Urs Freuler. By lap 17 the race had come back together and riders such as Moreno Argentin, Australian Michael Wilson and Criquielion had launched attacks but before long they had been brought back. By the final lap Zoetemelk had been all but invisible within the pack no different than many other riders, but he was still in the race as riders like Stephen Roche of Ireland and Kim Andersen of Denmark launched attacks that were eventually brought back. Following the final climb there were less than 20 riders still in contention, but it was a very strong surviving group that was going to come down to a sprint finish with riders including former champs LeMond and Criquielion, as well as Andersen, Roche, Robert Millar, Marc Madiot, Italian riders Argentin and Claudio Corti, who finished 2nd the previous year, as well as three Dutch riders in Zoetemelk, Van der Velde and Gerard Veldscholten. Knowing he would not win a sprint against the youngest, strongest riders in the world he launched an attack with over a kilometer to go. Going into the second to last turn Zoetemelk got to the front of the group, moved all the way to the outside of the road then swept back along the inside charging forward into the straightaway. Perhaps, as he was by far the oldest rider in the group and considered long past his prime, his attack caught the surviving contenders by surprise and he quickly opened a gap of fifty meters. His teammates in Van der Velde and Veldscholten moved to the front of the group, but we&#x27;re not actually chasing Zoetemelk down and were therefore slowing the chase group. As he went under the flamme rouge banner he had a gap of over 300 meters and was continuing to pull away from the best riders in the world. With 400 meters to go in the race he had a gap of 500 meters and Argentin was at the front of the pack trying to bring back Zoetemelk&#x27;s attack but couldn&#x27;t, so he actually put his arm in the air and waved for someone else to come forward and help. No one did, including LeMond who stated after the race that he just wasn&#x27;t strong enough to bring back this final attack after chasing down the attacks of other riders all day long. As the finish line approached he looked over his shoulder one final time and began celebrating. He crossed the line with his hands in the air and as his teammates Van der Velde and Veldscholten crossed the line in 9th and 14th place, they too threw their hands in the air in celebration. As of 2020 Zoetemelk is still the oldest world champion in the history of this event and of the other top 10 finishers in the 1985 race all of them were between 24 and 28 years old.
Regarding his victory in the 1980 Tour de France, Peter Post, directeur sportif of the team in the Netherlands, approached Zoetemelk through his wife, Françoise, after the world championship in 1979. Zoetemelk had long lived in France and ridden for French teams. His sponsor, the bicycle company Mercier, had ended its sponsorship and Zoetemelk was looking for a new team. The following year Zoetemelk won his – and &#x27;s – only Tour de France. The pre-race favourite, Bernard Hinault had retired halfway due to knee-problems. Zoetemelk objected to claims that he had won only because Hinault had dropped out, saying: &quot;Surely winning the Tour de France is a question of health and robustness. If Hinault doesn&#x27;t have that health and robustness and I have, that makes me a valid winner.&quot;

Gerald O&#x27;Donovan, the director behind sponsorship of the team, said:

:&quot;We needed a winner and for 1980 signed Joop Zoetemelk, who had an outstanding record of places but had probably enjoyed less support than we could give him. We cleaned up the Tours of Belgium, Holland and Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré in preparation and waited for the big day. The big plan to control Bernard Hinault, who had won for the previous two years, came to fruition. The team attacked his every move; this was &quot;Panzer Group Post&quot; at its most formidable. About halfway through the race he abandoned the lead to Zoetemelk and pulled out of the race. We arrived in Paris with the overall lead, 12 stage wins and the team prize, to say nothing of a whole bundle of francs. We had pounded away winning the battles for the previous four years; at last we had won the war.&quot;

Of one-day races he won La Flèche Wallonne in 1976, and the Grand Prix d&#x27;Automne in 1977 and 1979. He came in fourth in the World Championships of 1976 &amp; 1982, and placed in the top 10 in 1972, 1973, 1975, 1978 and 1984 before winning in 1985. Of the major week long stage races he won Tirreno–Adriatico, the Tour de Romandie and three editions of Paris–Nice. While he was never victorious in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, he did place in the top 10 on eight occasions.

In 18 years as a professional (1969–1987), Zoetemelk had a remarkable record of consistency. In grand tours and major stage races he entered 57 races, completing 55 of them, or 96.5% of them. Of these 55 completed races he finished inside the top 10 thirty-eight times, made the podium twenty-one times and claimed seven victories. He only finished outside the top 25 on four occasions.

He entered the Tour de France sixteen times and finished the race sixteen times, the latter of which is a record that Sylvain Chavanel tied when he finished the 2018 Tour de France. He holds the record for total kilometers ridden, a record that will be very difficult to break as modern stages are considerably shorter than they were during Zoetemelk&#x27;s era. Another record he held was for the most stages completed in TDF history with 365, a record that was not broken until 2018 by Chavanel.

== Doping ==
During the 1977 Tour de France he won the mountain time trial on stage 15B, several days later it was revealed he took a banned substance and had the stage win revoked and was penalized ten minutes.

In the 1979 Tour de France Zoetemelk tried attacking Hinault on the final stage of the race into Paris. Hinault and Zoetemelk stayed away for the entire stage and Zoetemelk was given a ten-minute doping penalty after the race was over.

During the 1983 Tour de France he was given a doping penalty. At his stage of his career, he was no longer a favorite for victory and was not taking substances for &quot;performance enhancement&quot;, but just to &quot;survive&quot; the race. Much later it was revealed by riders from this era they would often times take substances just to finish the race.

He was not implicated during his Tour win in 1980.

== Assessment ==

Zoetemelk is one of the most successful Tour riders of all time; he finished second a record six times and won once. His career coincided with the rise and fall of both Eddy Merckx and Bernard Hinault, riders considered by many to be the #1 and #2 in all of Tour de France history. While Merckx was rivaled by Luis Ocaña and Hinault by Laurent Fignon and Greg LeMond, by the end of most of their Tour victories it was Zoetemelk who proved to be the only rider in the entire field capable of keeping either one of them within striking distance. Specifically in Merckx&#x27;s 1969 and 1970 Tour wins nobody was able to keep him within fifteen minutes in 1969 and in 1970 Zoetemelk was the only rider to do so. He also finished 2nd to Merckx in 1971 following Ocana&#x27;s infamous crash on the Col de Menté, a crash in which Zoetemelk was involved but somehow managed to avoid injury. In fact, early in the 1971 Tour de France Zoetemelk wore the Yellow Jersey for the first time becoming the first GC contender to take the Yellow from Merckx. Then in the 1979 Hinault victory nearly the entire field finished a half hour or more behind him, but Zoetemelk was able to keep him within about three minutes to finish in second place, becoming the only rider in Tour history to challenge the yellow jersey on the final stage into Paris in the process. Zoetemelk finished second to Hinault in 1978 and 1979, before outlasting and defeating him in 1980, and again during his sixth and final second-place finish in 1982.

During his remarkable career Zoetemelk spent 22 days in the Yellow Jersey and won 10 individual stages in the Tour de France, was the overall winner of the Vuelta a España in 1979, the King of the Mountains in 1971, and won the 1985 UCI Road World Championships.

A fellow Tour rider, Rini Wagtmans, said: &quot;Joop Zoetemelk is the best rider that the Netherlands has ever known. There has never been a better one. But he could not give instructions. He was treated and helped with respect. But when Zoetemelk won the Tour, the instructions had to come from Gerrie Knetemann and Jan Raas.&quot;

Peter Post said: &quot;Joop would fit in any team. I&#x27;ve known only a few riders who were so easy. He followed the rules, he got on with people. That&#x27;s the way he is. He never asked for domestiques. Joop never demanded anything.&quot;

== Personal life and retirement ==

After retiring, Zoetemelk became a directeur sportif with Superconfex, which became Rabobank in 1996. Zoetemelk stayed with Rabobank for 10 years, retiring as a directeur sportif and from the sport after the 2006 Vuelta a España.

Zoetemelk married Françoise Duchaussoy, daughter of the Tour de France executive, Jacques Duchaussoy. They owned and ran the Richemont hotel in Meaux, near Paris. Their son, Karl, was a French mountain bike rider and champion.

== Recognition ==
Joop Zoetemelk was the second Dutch winner of the Tour de France after Jan Janssen. The Dutch cycling federation, the KNWU, named Zoetemelk the best Dutch rider of all time at a gala to mark its 75th anniversary. A statue of him at Rijpwetering, where he grew up, was unveiled on 31 May 2005. He was named sportsman of the year in the Netherlands in 1980 and 1985. Between 1972 and 1985, he won the Gerrit Schulte Trophy nine times as best rider of the year, more than anybody else in Dutch professional racing.
The Joop Zoetemelk Classic, a cyclo-sportive over 45, 75 or 150 km, is held every March, organised by the Swift club of which Zoetemelk is a member. The course passes his statue.

<doc id="1102874" wikidata="Q62204" url="?curid=1102874" title="Rudi Altig">
<text>Rudi Altig (; 18 March 1937 – 11 June 2016) was a German professional track and road racing cyclist who won the 1962 Vuelta a España and the world championship in 1966. After his retirement from sports he worked as a television commentator.

==Amateur career==

Rudi Altig was born in Mannheim, Baden, Germany, an area which had produced good track riders. He began racing in 1952, following his older brother, Willi. The brothers teamed for madison and other two-man races, becoming the best in the country. The British promoter, Jim Wallace, booked Altig to ride with Hans Jaroszewicz at a meeting on Herne Hill velodrome in Good Friday in 1956. He said:

What a pair they made! They just about slaughtered a top-class field of international riders, with all our best home lads. Only Michel Rousseau, later that year to become world sprint champion, was able to take a points sprint from them. That was in the first sprint, too; thereafter the German pair gained not only every sprint for points but every prime [lap prize] as well ... They went on to Coventry [another meeting held over Easter] and did much the same thing, winning everything in which they rode, so classy was their performance.

Altig became national sprint champion in 1957 and 1958. Then Karly Ziegler, a coach, took over his preparation when he joined the Endspurt Mannheim club and Altig became a pursuiter. He won the 1959 national pursuit championship and won the madison championship with his brother. Later that year he beat many of the world&#x27;s best pursuiters to become world champion in Amsterdam.

==Professional track career==
Altig was allowed by the Union Cycliste Internationale to turn professional in 1960 within a year of his world championship. He rode his first professional six-day, in Denmark, that winter. Wallace said:

No man ever settled down better or quicker to a pro career than the able Altig. In the hurly-burly world of indoor track racing. Rudi never seemed a novice. Settling down at once, tearing strips off established stars, he soon started to fill indoor tracks which had long forgotten the welcome sight of a &#x27;house full&#x27; sign. He brought back the biggest winter racing boom to Germany for many years, reminiscent of the balmy pre-war days. With seven tracks at home - more than in the rest of Europe - Altig had a busy time and was soon in the big money.

He won the world pursuit championship in 1960 and 1961 and won 62 races on the track. He won 22 six-day races, particularly in Germany, including four in Cologne and Dortmund. He never rode the Giro di Lombardia because it clashed with the start of the winter season on the track. He said:

I rode the track because I could win money. If I hadn&#x27;t been able to win money on the track, I wouldn&#x27;t have travelled all the velodromes of the world to ride six-days. Now, riders are better paid and they don&#x27;t need to hammer themselves on the road and the track. We, in our era, we did everything to try to win money. Modern times are different, you have to understand that. You can&#x27;t compare the two eras. But I don&#x27;t regret ours.

Altig, who was tall and weighed , sprinted on the track on 52 or 53 × 16 and rode pursuits on 52 × 15. &quot;He gave his bikes as hard a time as he gave his adversaries,&quot; said the writer, Olivier Dazat.

==Road career==
Altig started his professional career as a track rider; it was Raphaël Géminiani who persuaded him his future was on the road. Altig agreed because fame on the road would give him better contracts on the track. He won the Vuelta a España and three of its stages in 1962. He led the general classification for five days in his first Tour de France that same season, winning three stages and the points competition, and finishing 31st.

He won his first classic in 1964, the Tour of Flanders after riding 60 km alone and winning by four minutes. In the same year he won the German National Road Race. In 1965 he finished second to Englishman Tom Simpson in the professional road championship in San Sebastián, Spain. Simpson said:

I could not accept that Altig could beat me. Going round the back of the circuit we came to a gentleman&#x27;s agreement. Both of us had worked hard in our little break and therefore we each deserved an equal chance of victory. We agreed to separate when we reached the one kilometre to go board and ride in side by side. Altig was quite happy about this for I am sure he thought he could put it across me. So there we were, two gentlemen virtually fighting a duel over the last kilometre. I was glad that Altig had accepted my proposal for it was the fairest way out. I have always regarded him as a great rider and his showing that day did nothing to make me change my mind.

But the world title was not denied for long: he won the 1966 championship not too far away from his home, at the Nürburgring. There was controversy because Altig had been helped by Gianni Motta, riding that day for Italy but normally Altig&#x27;s companion in the Molteni team. The concern was quickly overshadowed by the refusal of the first three riders to give urine samples for a drugs check. They were protesting at what they saw was the laxity with which tests were carried out and at what they considered restrictions on the way they prepared themselves. Altig said: &quot;We are professionals, not sportsmen.&quot; The three were disqualified and suspended but ten days later the Union Cycliste Internationale allowed the result to stand.
Altig took three stages in that year&#x27;s Tour, finishing 12th place overall, and two more in the Giro d&#x27;Italia, in which he came 13th.

The second and final classic win came in the 1968 Milan–San Remo. He also took two stages of that year&#x27;s Vuelta, finishing 18th overall. In 1969 he finished 9th in the Giro, and won the prologue individual time trial of the Tour de France.

===Jacques Anquetil===
Altig rode his first Tour as a domestique and as team sprinter for Jacques Anquetil. The two developed a rocky relationship in the Tour of Spain that hardened when Altig took the yellow jersey early in the Tour de France. Anquetil criticised him because his team would have to ride at the front and chase every attack to protect a rider too heavy to keep his lead through the mountains. The two never became close until they rode for different teams.

That same year the two were paired for the Trofeo Baracchi, a 111 km two-man time-trial in Italy. The writer René de Latour wrote:

Generally in a race of the Barrachi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints of no more than 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check - and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn&#x27;t even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things I have ever seen in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years&#x27; association with the sport - something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front - and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did not this just once but dozens of times.

Anquetil reached the stadium where the race finished and hit a pole. He was helped away with staring eyes and with blood streaming from a cut to his head. The pairing nevertheless won by nine seconds. Altig said: &quot;Jacques wasn&#x27;t happy [during the race], it didn&#x27;t please him at all, but I wanted us to win. So I got him by the saddle, I got him by the shorts, and &quot;hop!&quot;.&quot;

==Retirement==
Altig became directeur sportif of the Puch-Wolber team when he stopped racing and worked for five years as national coach. He was a television commentator. He said of the American rider, Lance Armstrong: &quot;He is a tyrant who exploits his team-mates without leaving them the least initiative.&quot; Of his fellow German, Jan Ullrich, he said he would do better to talk less about what he was going to do and get on and do it.

He died on 11 June 2016 in Remagen, Germany, as a result of cancer.

<text>Viktor Andriiovych Yushchenko (, ; born 23 February 1954) is a Ukrainian politician who was the third president of Ukraine from 23 January 2005 to 25 February 2010. He aimed to orient Ukraine towards the West, European Union and NATO.

Yushchenko&#x27;s first career was in the banking industry. In 1993, he became governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, presiding over their response to hyperinflation and the introduction of a national currency. From 1999 to 2001 he was prime minister under President Leonid Kuchma. After his dismissal as prime minister, Yushchenko went into opposition to President Kuchma and founded Our Ukraine Bloc, which at the 2002 parliamentary election became Ukraine&#x27;s most popular political force.

As an informal leader of the Ukrainian opposition coalition, he was one of the two main candidates in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, the other being Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych. During the election campaign in late 2004, Yushchenko became the victim of an assassination attempt when he was poisoned with dioxin. He suffered disfigurement as a result of the poisoning, but survived. The runoff election in November 2004, won by Yanukovych, was marred by widespread accusations of election fraud, leading to the Orange Revolution and an order by the Ukrainian Supreme Court to repeat the vote. Yushchenko won the revote 52% to 44%.

Yushchenko&#x27;s influence declined soon after assuming the presidency, especially after falling out with his prime minister and leading political ally Yulia Tymoshenko, as did his and his party&#x27;s popularity and electoral standing. The rest of his presidency was marked by infighting, legislative deadlock and coalition crises in 2007 and in 2008. He lost re-election to Yanukovych in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election, finishing in fifth place in the first round with 5.5% of the vote. Yushchenko again led Our Ukraine in the 2012 parliamentary election, but they failed to win representation.

==Early life==
Yushchenko was born on 23 February 1954, in Khoruzhivka, Sumy Oblast, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union, into a family of teachers. His father, Andriy Andriyovych Yushchenko (1919–1992) fought in the Second World War, was captured by German forces and imprisoned as a POW in a series of concentration camps in the German Reich, including Auschwitz-Birkenau. His father survived the ordeal, and after returning home taught English at a local school.

Viktor&#x27;s mother, Varvara Tymofiyovna Yushchenko (1918–2005), taught physics and mathematics at the same school. The Sumy Oblast region where he was born is predominantly Ukrainian-speaking, and this differentiated him in later life from his political counterparts, for whom Russian was the mother tongue.

Yushchenko graduated from the Ternopil Finance and Economics Institute in 1975. He began work as an accountant, as a deputy to the chief accountant in a kolkhoz. From 1975 to 1976, he served as a conscript in the Transcaucasian Military District on the Soviet–Turkish border.

==Central banker==
In 1976, Yushchenko began a career in banking. In 1983, he became the Deputy Director for Agricultural Credit at the Ukrainian Republican Office of the Soviet Union State Bank. From 1990 to 1993, he worked as vice-chairman and first vice-chairman of the JSC Agroindustrial Bank &quot;Ukraina&quot;. In 1993, he was appointed Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine (Ukraine&#x27;s central bank). In 1997, Verkhovna Rada, the parliament of Ukraine, re-appointed him.

As a central banker, Yushchenko played an important part in the creation of Ukraine&#x27;s national currency, the hryvnia, and the establishment of a modern regulatory system for commercial banking. He also successfully overcame a debilitating wave of hyper-inflation that hit the country—he brought inflation down from more than 10,000 percent to less than 10 percent—and managed to defend the value of the currency following the 1998 Russian financial crisis.

In 1998, he wrote a thesis entitled &quot;The Development of Supply and Demand of Money in Ukraine&quot; and defended it in the Ukrainian Academy of Banking. He thereby earned a doctorate in economics.

==Prime minister==

In December 1999, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma unexpectedly nominated Yushchenko to be the prime minister after the parliament failed by one vote to ratify the previous candidate, Valeriy Pustovoytenko.

Ukraine&#x27;s economy improved during Yushchenko&#x27;s cabinet service. However, his government, particularly Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, soon became embroiled in a confrontation with influential leaders of the coal mining and natural gas industries. The conflict resulted in a no-confidence vote by the parliament on 26 April 2001, orchestrated by the Communist Party of Ukraine, who opposed Yushchenko&#x27;s economic policies, and by centrist groups associated with the country&#x27;s powerful &quot;oligarchs.&quot; The vote passed 263 to 187 and resulted in Yushchenko&#x27;s removal from office.

==&quot;Our Ukraine&quot; leader==

In 2002, Yushchenko became the leader of the &quot;Our Ukraine&quot; (&quot;Nasha Ukrayina&quot;) political coalition, which received a plurality of seats in the year&#x27;s parliamentary election. However, the number of seats won was not a majority, and efforts to form a majority coalition with other opposition parties failed. Since then, Yushchenko has remained the leader and public face of the Our Ukraine parliamentary faction. 

In 2001, both Yushchenko and Tymoshenko broached at creating a broad opposition bloc against the incumbent President Kuchma in order to win the Ukrainian presidential election 2004.

In late 2002 Yushchenko, Oleksandr Moroz (Socialist Party of Ukraine), Petro Symonenko (Communist Party of Ukraine) and Tymoshenko (Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc) issued a joint statement concerning &quot;the beginning of a state revolution in Ukraine&quot;. Though the communists stepped out of the alliance and though Symonenko opposed having one single candidate from the alliance in the 2004 presidential election, the other three parties remained allies until July 2006.

On 2 July 2004, Our Ukraine and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc established the &quot;Force of the people&quot;, a coalition which aimed to stop &quot;the destructive process that has, as a result of the incumbent authorities, become a characteristic for Ukraine&quot;, at the time Kuchma and Yanukovych were the incumbent authorities in Ukraine. The pact included a promise by Yushchenko to nominate Tymoshenko as prime minister if he won the October 2004 presidential election.

Yushchenko was widely regarded as the moderate political leader of the anti-Kuchma opposition, since other opposition parties were less influential and had fewer seats in parliament. Since becoming President of Ukraine in 2005, he has been an honorary leader of the &quot;Our Ukraine&quot; party.

From 2001 to 2004, his rankings in popularity polls were higher than those of Kuchma. In later public opinion polls, though, his support plummeted from a high of 52% following his election in 2004 to below 4%.

However, in the parliamentary elections of March 2006, the Our Ukraine party, led by Prime Minister Yuriy Yekhanurov, received less than 14% of the national vote, taking third place behind the Party of Regions and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc. In a poll by the Sofia Social Research Centre between 27 July and 7 August 2007 more than 52% of those polled said they distrusted Yushchenko while 48% said they trusted him.

==Presidential election of 2004==
In 2004, as Kuchma&#x27;s term came to an end, Yushchenko announced his candidacy for president as an independent. His major rival was Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych. Since his term as prime minister, Yushchenko had slightly modernized his political platform, adding social partnership and other liberal slogans to older ideas of European integration, including Ukraine&#x27;s joining NATO and fighting corruption. Supporters of Yushchenko were organized in the &quot;Syla Narodu&quot; (&quot;Power to the People&quot;) electoral coalition, which he and his political allies led, with the Our Ukraine coalition as the main constituent force.

Yushchenko built his campaign on face-to-face communication with voters, since the government prevented most major TV channels from providing equal coverage to candidates. Meanwhile, his rival, Yanukovych, frequently appeared in the news and even accused Yushchenko, whose father was a Red Army soldier imprisoned at Auschwitz, of being &quot;a Nazi,&quot; even though Yushchenko actively reached out to the Jewish community in Ukraine and his mother is said to have risked her life by hiding three Jewish girls for one and a half years during the Second World War.

==TCDD poisoning==

Yushchenko became seriously ill in early September 2004. He was flown to Vienna&#x27;s Rudolfinerhaus clinic for treatment and diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, accompanied by interstitial edematous abnormalities, due to a serious viral infection and chemical substances that are not normally found in food products. Yushchenko claimed that he had been poisoned by government agents. After the illness, his face has shown signs of chloracne.

British toxicologist Professor John Henry of St Mary&#x27;s Hospital in London declared the abnormalities in Yushchenko&#x27;s face were due to chloracne, which results from dioxin poisoning. Dutch toxicologist Bram Brouwer also stated his abnormalities in appearance were the result of chloracne, and found dioxin levels in Yushchenko&#x27;s blood 6,000 times above normal.

On 11 December, Michael Zimpfer of the Rudolfinerhaus clinic declared that Yushchenko had ingested TCDD dioxin and had 1,000 times the usual concentration in his body.

Many have linked Yushchenko&#x27;s poisoning to a dinner with a group of senior Ukrainian officials (including Volodymyr Satsyuk) that took place on 5 September.

Since 2005, Yushchenko has been treated by a team of doctors led by Professor Jean Saurat at the University of Geneva Hospital. Analysis of Yushchenko&#x27;s body fluids and tissues provided useful information on the human toxicokinetics of TCDD and its metabolites.

Yushchenko himself implicated Davyd Zhvania, the godfather of one of his children, of involvement in his dioxin poisoning.

In August 2009, &quot;The Lancet&quot; published a scientific paper by Swiss and Ukrainian researchers on the monitoring, form, distribution, and elimination of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD) in Yushchenko in relation to his severe poisoning. The 2004 TCDD levels in Yushchenko&#x27;s blood serum were 50,000 times greater than those in the general population. This new study also concluded that the dioxin &quot;was so pure that it was definitely made in a laboratory&quot;.

On 27 September 2009, Yushchenko said in an interview aired on Channel 1+1 that the testimony of three men who were at a dinner in 2004 at which he believes he was poisoned is crucial to finishing the investigation, and he claimed these men were in Russia. Ukrainian prosecutors said Russia has refused to extradite one of the men, the former deputy chief of Ukraine&#x27;s security service, Volodymyr Satsyuk, because he holds both Russian and Ukrainian citizenship. Satsyuk returned to Ukraine in 2012 and tried to relaunch his political career, but did not succeed.

==Presidency==

===Inauguration===
At 12 pm (Kyiv time) on 23 January 2005 the inauguration of Yushchenko as the President of Ukraine took place. The event was attended by numerous foreign dignitaries.

===Presidency===
The first hundred days of Yushchenko&#x27;s term, 23 January 2005 through 1 May 2005, were marked by numerous dismissals and appointments at all levels of the executive branch. He appointed Tymoshenko as prime minister and the appointment was ratified by parliament. Oleksandr Zinchenko was appointed the head of the presidential secretariat with a nominal title of Secretary of State. Petro Poroshenko, a fierce competitor of Tymoshenko for the post of prime minister, was appointed Secretary of the Security and Defense Council.

In May 2005, Ukraine hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in the capital of Kyiv. Some accused Yushchenko of attempting to gain political capital from the event, with his appearance on stage at the end criticised as &#x27;undignified&#x27; by certain commentators. During 2005, Yushchenko was in confident mood, making such pledges as solving the Gongadze case to the removal of Russia&#x27;s Black Sea Fleet.

In August 2005, Yushchenko joined with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili in signing the Borjomi Declaration, which called for the creation of an institution of international cooperation, the Community of Democratic Choice, to bring together the democracies and incipient democracies in the region around the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas. The first meeting of presidents and leaders to discuss the CDC took place on 1–2 December 2005 in Kyiv.

According to former Security Service of Ukraine Chairman Oleksandr Turchynov, in the summer of 2005 Yushchenko prevented an investigation into allegedly fraudulent practices in the transport of Turkmen natural gas to Ukraine and the arrest of Yuri Boyko for abuse of office while heading Naftogaz.

===Dismissal of other Orange Revolution members===
On 8 September 2005, Yushchenko fired his government, led by Tymoshenko, after resignations and claims of corruption. On 9 September, acting Prime Minister Yekhanurov tried to form a new government. His first attempt, on 20 September, fell short by 3 votes of the necessary 226, but on 22 September the parliament ratified his government with 289 votes.

Also in September 2005, former president Leonid Kravchuk accused exiled Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky of financing Yushchenko&#x27;s presidential election campaign, and provided copies of documents showing money transfers from companies he said were controlled by Berezovsky to companies controlled by Yushchenko&#x27;s official backers. Berezovsky confirmed that he met Yushchenko&#x27;s representatives in London before the election, and that the money was transferred from his companies, but he refused to confirm or deny that the money was used in Yushchenko&#x27;s campaign. Financing of election campaigns by foreign citizens is illegal in Ukraine.

In August 2006, Yushchenko appointed his onetime opponent in the presidential race, Yanukovych, to be the new prime minister. This was generally regarded as indicating a rapprochement with Russia.

===First dissolution of Parliament===

On 2 April 2007, Yushchenko signed an order to dissolve the parliament and call early elections. Some consider the dissolution order illegal because none of the conditions spelled out under of the Constitution of Ukraine for the president to dissolve the legislature had been met. Yushchenko&#x27;s detractors argued that he was attempting to usurp the functions of the Constitutional Court by claiming constitutional violations by the parliament as a pretext for his action. The parliament appealed the Constitutional Court itself and promised to abide by its ruling.

In the meantime, the parliament continued to meet and banned the financing of any new election pending the Constitutional Court&#x27;s decision. Competing protests took place and the crisis escalated. In May 2007, Yushchenko illegally dismissed three members of Ukraine&#x27;s Constitutional Court, thus preventing the court from ruling on the constitutionality of his decree dismissing Ukraine&#x27;s parliament.

===Second dissolution of Parliament (2007) and conflict with Tymoshenko (2008–2009)===
Yushchenko again tried to dissolve the parliament on 9 October 2008 by announcing parliamentary elections to be held on 7 December. Yushchenko&#x27;s decree was suspended and subsequently lapsed. Yushchenko in defense of his actions said, &quot;I am deeply convinced that the democratic coalition was ruined by one thing alone—human ambition. The ambition of one person.&quot; Political groups including members of his own Our Ukraine party contested the election decree and politicians vowed to challenge it in the courts.

In December 2008, following a back room revolt from members of Our Ukraine-Peoples&#x27; Self Defense Party a revised coalition was formed between members of Our Ukraine (OU-PSD), the Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko (BYuT), and the Lytvyn Bloc (LB), increasing the size of the governing coalition by an additional 20 members. Yushchenko in responding to journalists questions claimed &quot;The fact is that the so-called coalition was formed on basis of political corruption, this coalition will be able to work only if the Communist Party will join it. Speaking about such a type of coalition, it is even more shameful.&quot; Yushchenko also stated that Tymoshenko&#x27;s desire to keep her job as Prime Minister was the main motive for creating the coalition and that he wanted to expel the OU-PSD lawmakers who supported the creation of the coalition from the list of members of parliament.

Yushchenko claimed (19 March 2009) that his conflicts with Tymoshenko are not due to personal differences, but to the incompleteness of the constitutional reforms of 2004.

On 23 July 2009, under the terms of Ukraine&#x27;s Constitution the president cannot dismiss the parliament within six months from the expiration of his five-year term of authority, which ended on 23 January 2010.

==2010 presidential election and later career==

===2010 presidential election===

On 10 November 2009, Yushchenko was nominated for a second term as president, with the election to be held on 17 January 2010. In late November 2009, he stated he was going to leave politics after his possible second term. During the campaign, Yushchenko claimed that his fellow candidates &quot;Tymoshenko and Yanukovych are not ideologists who care about the fate of Ukraine and its interests. They are two political adventurers&quot; and that Ukraine&#x27;s independence and sovereignty were at the time more jeopardized than five to ten years earlier.

The first round of the elections took place on 17 January 2010, and Yushchenko dropped to a distant fifth place with only 5.45% of the vote. His result became the worst result for any sitting president.

Yushchenko stated that he wanted to continue to defend democracy in Ukraine and that he wanted to return to the presidency.

On 22 January 2010, as outgoing President, Yushchenko officially rehabilitated one of Ukraine&#x27;s most controversial figures from the era of World War II, the ultranationalist leader Stepan Bandera, awarding him the title of Hero of Ukraine. Yushchenko&#x27;s decision immediately caused an uproar and was condemned by the European Parliament and Russian, Polish, and Jewish organizations and was declared illegal by the following Ukrainian government and a court decision in April 2010. In January 2011, the award was officially annulled.

In the second round of Ukraine&#x27;s presidential election, Yushchenko did not support either of the candidates, Yanukovych or Tymoshenko.

Yushchenko attributed his low popularity ratings to his adherence to his principles. &quot;Ukraine is a European democratic country&quot;, Yushchenko said at the polling station. &quot;It is a free nation and free people.&quot; In the following days, he said that &quot;Ukraine doesn&#x27;t have a decent choice&quot; for his replacement. &quot;Both candidates are alienated from national, European, and democratic values. I don&#x27;t see a principal difference between them.&quot; However, his low approval ratings may also be attributable to his tacit support for his former adversary Yanukovych between rounds one and two. Yushchenko removed the Kharkiv and Dniproptrovsk governors, who had expressed support for Tymoshenko and had refused to provide administrative resources for Yanukovych&#x27;s campaign.

Yushchenko did not attend the inauguration ceremony of Yanukovych.

On 10 March 2010, Yushchenko indicated his future plans would largely depend on Yanukovych&#x27;s performance. A day earlier, Yushchenko&#x27;s former ally turned rival, Tymoshenko, took up the mantle as leader of the democratic opposition. But Yushchenko warned that her leadership would end in disaster, noting, &quot;[e]very political force that united with Tymoshenko ended badly.&quot; On 31 May 2010 Yushchenko stated that Tymoshenko was his &quot;worst mistake&quot;: &quot;The most serious mistake was to give power to her twice&quot;.

===Later career including 2012 parliamentary elections===
Yushchenko testified against his former ally Tymoshenko during her trial over a 2009 natural gas treaty she brokered with Russia; a trial he called &quot;a normal judicial process&quot;. Yushchenko&#x27;s view differed from that of the European Union&#x27;s (EU) foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who said in a statement the Tymoshenko verdict showed justice was being applied &quot;selectively in politically motivated prosecutions&quot;.

Late September 2011 Yushchenko stated he intended to run for parliament on an Our Ukraine party ticket at the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary elections. Mid-February 2012 Yushchenko stated he was ready to take part in this election on a list of the united opposition, but not in a majority constituency. In these election Yushchenko headed the election list of Our Ukraine; the party won 1.11% of the national votes and no constituencies and thus failed to win parliamentary representation.

In February 2013 Yushchenko intended to be a candidate during the next presidential election (at the time scheduled to be in 2015).

====Euromaidan and 2014 election====
In an interview with the French radio station Europe 1 in March 2014, Yushchenko stated that he supported the Euromaidan protests and opposed the Russian invasion in Crimea, noting that in his view &quot;Putin dreams of reconstructing the Soviet empire under the name of Russia. He is so obsessed with this that he hasn&#x27;t understood power balance.&quot; He further stated that &quot;Crimea isn&#x27;t Russian; rather it is Ukrainian&quot;.

With regard to the 2014 presidential election, Yushchenko indicated his support for Vitali Klitschko, and described Tymoshenko as &quot;the candidate of Moscow&quot;. Yushchenko himself did not stand as a candidate in these elections.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===
In a 2024 interview, Yushchenko criticized the US Congress&#x27;s delay in approving military aid to Ukraine, describing it as “a colossal waste of time” that allowed Russia to “attack, ruin infrastructure, rampage all over Ukraine”. He also supported President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s handling of the situation and opposed giving up territory to end the war, saying that it would give Vladimir Putin &quot;five or seven years to get stronger and then start this misery again&quot;.

==Political positions==

On 31 March 2009, in his address to the nation before Parliament, Yushchenko proposed sweeping government reform changes and an economic and social plan to ameliorate current economic conditions in Ukraine and apparently to respond to standing structural problems in Ukraine&#x27;s political system.

The proposal, which Yushchenko called a &#x27;next big step forward for fairness and prosperity in Ukraine&#x27; included the following proposals:
* Restore financial stability in the country by implementing the International Monetary Fund reforms and a balanced budget
* Abolish parliamentary immunity
* Fair pension system based on the number of years of work and salary received
* Pass a realistic state budget for 2009 that reduces inflation and stabilizes the hryvnia
* Have the state assume responsibility for struggling banks
* Rejuvenate rural areas by eliminating state interference in agriculture production
* Promote Ukrainian products abroad to increase sales for Ukraine&#x27;s producers
* European Union membership and increased trade while simultaneously improving relations and trade with Russia
* Allow voters to elect members of parliament from the areas where they live
* Open up party lists for both parliamentary and local elections
* Create bicameral parliament to bring stability to the legislative branch
* Reduce the number of members of parliament

Yushchenko also advocates NATO membership for Ukraine and is against promoting Russian as the second state language in Ukraine.

According to Yushchenko, a good future for the country is impossible without national unity. Yushchenko also advocates the formation of a single Orthodox Church of Ukraine, thus unifying the current three branches of the Orthodox church in Ukraine (the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kyiv Patriarchate and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church).

Actions by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army have been praised by Yushchenko, and he has tried to give anti-Soviet partisans who fought in World War II the status of war veterans.

According to Yushchenko the difficulties of relations between Ukraine and Russia are because the countries follow different directions and have different system of values. Yushchenko thinks that &quot;the Russia-Georgia war of August 2008 poses a threat that European leaders still haven&#x27;t addressed&quot;. He has called for a demarcation of borders between Russia and Ukraine, which has been delayed by Russia since Ukraine won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. 

During the campaign for the Ukrainian presidential election, 2010 Yushchenko said Russia&#x27;s influence was again a factor in the upcoming election and warned of &quot;interference&quot; from Moscow in the distribution of Russian passports to residents of Crimea. He stated (on 10 December 2009) &quot;Russia is a friendly country and that it would be a great mistake for Ukraine to lose these relations or to slow down their development; I believe that there will appear politicians in Russia, who will respect the rights of all neighbors, including Ukraine&quot;.

Yushchenko&#x27;s 2010 presidential election program promised visa-free travel with EU, the withdrawal of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation by 2017 and &quot;an active dialogue with all of Ukraine&#x27;s neighbours based on the principles of equal rights, good neighbourly relations and mutual trust&quot;, but did not mention NATO membership. Yushchenko also believed that the 2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis could be tackled with the help of reconstruction, including road reconstruction. The program banned tax collection in advance, would return non-reimbursed VAT, create equal tax rules for everybody and stop government interference in certain enterprises and whole sectors of the economy.

Yushchenko considers an open list of candidates for parliamentary elections as one of the conditions for eradicating corruption.

On 2 March 2022, Yushchenko described Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 as &quot;the Moscow junta and the Russian fascist regime&quot;.

==Family and personal life==
In 1977, Yushchenko married Svitlana Ivanivna Kolesnyk, with whom he has two children and three grandchildren:
* Vitalyna (b. 15 April 1980) currently married to Oleksiy Khakhlyov and has two children.
** Oleksiy Khakhlyov is a director of the Tar-paper Factory in Slavuta, Khmelnytskyi Oblast
* Andriy (b. 1985) and has a daughter

A practicing member of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Yushchenko often emphasizes the important role of his religious convictions in his life and worldview.

Yushchenko has been criticized for using many words of Russian origin when speaking Ukrainian. His main hobbies are Ukrainian traditional culture (including art, ceramics, and archaeology), mountaineering, and beekeeping. He is keen on painting, collects antiques, folk artifacts, and Ukrainian national dress, and restores objects of Trypillya culture. Each year he climbs Hoverla, Ukraine&#x27;s highest mountain. After receiving a checkup in which doctors determined he was healthy despite the previous year&#x27;s dioxin poisoning, he successfully climbed the mountain again on 16 July 2005. 

==Cultural and political image==
As a politician, Yushchenko is widely perceived as a mixture of Western-oriented and Ukrainian nationalist. He advocates moving Ukraine in the direction of Europe and NATO, promoting free market reforms, preserving Ukraine&#x27;s culture, rebuilding important historical monuments, and remembering Ukraine&#x27;s history, including the famine of 1932–1933, commonly referred to as The Holodomor. His opponents (and allies) sometimes criticize him for indecision and secrecy, while his advocates argue that the same attributes indicate Yushchenko&#x27;s commitment to teamwork, consensus, and negotiation. He is also often accused of being unable to form a unified team without infighting.

United States Ambassador to Ukraine John F. Tefft, described Yushchenko, in a document uncovered during the United States diplomatic cables leak, as discredited among the population because of his weakness of leadership, continuous conflicts with Tymoshenko, needless hostility towards Russia and his NATO ambitions.

Yushchenko&#x27;s former Minister of Internal Affairs Yuriy Lutsenko, while awaiting trial on corruption charges for which he was subsequently convicted, accused Yushchenko of betraying the Orange Revolution by bringing Yanukovych to power.

In December 2011, Russian Prime Minister Putin claimed that the organizers of the 2011 Russian protests were former (Russian) advisors to Yushchenko during his presidency and were transferring the Orange Revolution to Russia.

===Public opinion polls===
In March 2009, Yushchenko&#x27;s popularity plunged to just 22%. According to a poll carried out by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology between 29 January and 5 February 2009, nearly 70% of Ukrainian voters believed that Yushchenko should leave his post, whereas just over 30% believed he should stay. When asked if Yushchenko should be impeached, over 56% of those polled were in favor with 44% against.

According to a public opinion poll conducted by FOM-Ukraine in September/October 2009, 88.5% of those polled did not support the actions of Yushchenko as president, while 11.5% welcomed them. A Razumkov Center opinion poll conducted in October 2011 told that 80% of Ukrainians did not support his actions, while 20% of Ukrainians supported his actions; it was the highest negative rating of any Ukrainian politician.

<text>Luis Alberto &quot;Lucho&quot; Herrera Herrera, known as &quot;El jardinerito&quot; (&quot;the little gardener&quot;; born May 4, 1961, in Fusagasugá, Colombia), is a retired Colombian road racing cyclist. Herrera was a professional from 1985 to 1992 but had a successful amateur career before that in Colombia.

He entered his first Vuelta a Colombia in 1981 where he finished 16th overall and 3rd in the New Rider competition. Although he abandoned his second Vuelta a Colombia in 1982, he won Colombia&#x27;s second major stage-race, the Clásico RCN. In 1983 Herrera won Clásico RCN again as well as two stages and finished second overall to Alfonso Florez Ortiz in the 1983 Vuelta a Colombia. In 1984 he won the Vuelta a Colombia, and the Clásico RCN.

In 1984 he won stage 17 to Alpe d&#x27;Huez in the 1984 Tour de France, becoming the first Colombian to win a stage of the race, and the first amateur cyclist to win a stage in the history of the Tour de France. He won the Vuelta a Colombia and the Clásico RCN four times each. His greatest achievement was in 1987, when he won the Vuelta a España, the first South American to win a Grand Tour. Herrera also won the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré in 1988 and 1991.

Herrera won five &quot;King of the Mountains&quot; jerseys from the three Grand Tours. He is the second rider to win the King of the Mountains jersey in all three Grand Tours. The first was Federico Bahamontes of Spain.

<text>Angaria (Latin; , Bulgarian: &quot;ангарѝя&quot;) was a sort of postal system adopted by the Roman imperial government from the ancient Persians. According to Xenophon, the Persian system was established by Cyrus the Great. Couriers on horseback were posted at certain stages along the chief roads of the empire, for the transmission of royal dispatches by night and day in all weather. 

The Roman system took its name from the Greek form of a Babylonian word adopted in Persian for these mounted couriers. In the Roman system, the supply of horses and their maintenance was a compulsory duty from which the emperor alone could grant exemption. 

The term was also used from the 4th century for the heavy transport vehicles of the &quot;cursus publicus&quot; and the draft animals which pulled them. It came to mean any compulsory service (cf. levy) or oppression in medieval Latin, Byzantine Greek, and old Bulgarian. In modern Greek and modern Bulgarian, it means any service or task only grudgingly undertaken by the one forced to perform it.

<doc id="1102882" wikidata="Q7183201" url="?curid=1102882" title="Philip Becker">
<text>Philip Becker (1830–1898) was mayor of Buffalo, New York, serving 1876–1877 and 1886–1889. He was born in Oberotterbach, Kingdom of Bavaria, on April 25, 1830. He graduated from college in Germany at sixteen years of age. In 1847, Philip and his older brother were provided the means to pay the fare to America and he settled in Buffalo, where his aunt and uncle lived. In 1852, he married Sarah Goetz. He entered the retail and wholesale grocery business. A Republican in politics, his election as mayor on November 2, 1875, was followed quickly by his nomination as a delegate to the 1876 Republican National Convention which successfully nominated Rutherford B. Hayes for the presidency. It was also during his first term, in March 1876, that the new County and City Hall was opened. 

Becker was defeated by Solomon Scheu in the election of 1877, but was reelected to a second term in 1885 and to a third in 1887. At the end of his third term, he did not seek re-election. He returned to his business enterprises and retired in 1893. Becker died on July 4, 1898, with an estate valued over $750,000. He was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery under a truncated obelisk of polished black Quincy granite crafted by McDonnell &amp; Sons which, at a weight of 48 tons, was the largest such piece of polished stone ever to have been manufactured at the time.

Becker is arguably most historically notable as a pioneer in, and champion of, German culture in Buffalo. Not only was he the first German-American to be elected as the city&#x27;s mayor, but he was also instrumental in organizing the Buffalo German Insurance Company in 1867, serving as its president from 1869 until his death, and during the period between his first and second terms championed the construction of the Buffalo Music Hall on Main Street and the selection of Buffalo as the site of the 1883 German &quot;Sängerfest&quot;.

<doc id="1102889" wikidata="Q2257407" url="?curid=1102889" title="Valadares (Vila Nova de Gaia)">
<text>Valadares is a former civil parish in the municipality of Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal. In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Gulpilhares e Valadares. The population in 2011 was 10,678, in an area of 5.14 km2.

Today the shoreside vicinity is very popular for its nightlife and the bars along its well-known beach. It is also possible to see some old sanatoriums used mostly in the 1940s and 1950s to treat people suffering from bone fractures and diseases like tuberculosis. The sanatoriums were established here because the region is extremely rich in iodine, valuable for its antiseptic uses in medicine.

Valadares is also very famous for Cerâmica de Valadares that today it is considered the biggest and most varied National Manufacture provider of sanitary ware and ceramic fittings.
There is a train station.

== Coat of arms and flag ==

The coat of arms are made up of a ceramic vase on the center with a dentate wheel behind, on the left is maize and on the right a shield over the water, on the bottom is water. The flag has two white and two blue squares.

The ceramic vase with a dentate wheel represents the ceramic industry and the archaeological findings. The maize represents the fields in Vila Chá. The shield represents the shields of Vila Nova de Gaia coat of arms. The water represents the ocean and the beach of Valadares. The colors blue and white represent the ocean and foam of the waves.

== History ==

The name Valadares originates from the word &quot;Vallado&quot;, that means obstacle. That may be the &quot;Crasto de Valadares&quot; a fortification from the second period of the Iron Age (450 b.C.). This &quot;Crastos&quot; on the northwest of Iberian Peninsula, goes from the 5th century B.C. to AD 5th century. In the Middle Ages, Valadares belonged to the Monastery of Grijó. During the first half of the 20th century, Valadares enjoyed a considerable development, being one of the most developed parishes of Gaia, due to the existence of the Cerâmica de Valadares, one important Train Station, Sanatoriums, several Schools and a theatre (Cine-teatro Eduardo Brazão).

== Culture ==

There is a traditional dessert in Valadares - The &quot;Velhote&quot;, a kind of sweet bread with lemon and cinnamon. The origin of this dessert isn&#x27;t cleared yet, but most people believe that it was created in the 19th century by a lady who came from Braga. It is said that when king Carlos I and queen Amelia went to Oporto, they ate &quot;Velhotes&quot;.

The patron of Valadares is S. Salvador.

<text>The order Notostraca, containing the single family Triopsidae, is a group of crustaceans known as tadpole shrimp or shield shrimp. The two genera, &quot;Triops&quot; and &quot;Lepidurus&quot;, are considered living fossils, with similar forms having existed since the end of the Devonian, around 360 million years ago. They have a broad, flat carapace, which conceals the head and bears a single pair of compound eyes. The abdomen is long, appears to be segmented and bears numerous pairs of flattened legs. The telson is flanked by a pair of long, thin caudal rami. Phenotypic plasticity within taxa makes species-level identification difficult, and is further compounded by variation in the mode of reproduction. Notostracans are omnivores living on the bottom of temporary pools and shallow lakes.

==Description==
Notostracans are long, with a broad carapace at the front end, and a long, slender abdomen. This gives them a similar overall shape to a tadpole, from which the common name &quot;tadpole shrimp&quot; derives. The carapace is dorso-ventrally flattened, smooth, and bears no rostrum; it includes the head, and the two sessile compound eyes are located together on top of the head. The two pairs of antennae are much reduced, with the second pair sometimes missing altogether. The mouthparts comprise a pair of uniramous mandibles and no maxillipeds.
The trunk consists of three regions; thorax I, thorax II and the abdomen. Thorax I is made up of 11 segments, each with a pair of well-developed limbs and the genital opening on the eleventh segment. In the female, it is modified to form a &quot;brood pouch&quot;. The first one or two pairs of legs differ from the remainder, and probably function as sensory organs.

The somites on thorax II are fused into &quot;rings&quot;, which varies in number between species and gender and appear to be body segments, but do not always reflect the underlying segmentation. Each ring is made up of 2–6 complete or partial fused segments, and the number of legs on each body ring match its number of segments. The legs become progressively smaller posteriorly, with the last segments being legless.

The limbless abdomen ends in a telson and a pair of long, thin, multi-articulate caudal rami. The form of the telson varies between the two genera: in &quot;Lepidurus&quot;, a rounded projection extends between the caudal rami, while in &quot;Triops&quot; there is no such projection.

==Life cycle==

Within the Notostraca, and even within species, there is variation in the mode of reproduction, with some populations reproducing sexually, some showing self-fertilisation of females, and some showing a mix of the two. The frequency of males in populations is therefore highly variable. In sexual populations, the sperm leave the male&#x27;s body through simple pores, there being no penis. The eggs are released by the female and then held in the cup-like brood pouch. The eggs are retained by the female only for a short time before being laid, and the larvae develop directly, without passing through a metamorphosis.

==Ecology and distribution==
Notostracans are omnivorous, eating small animals such as fishes and fairy shrimp. They are found worldwide in freshwater, brackish water, or saline pools, as well as in shallow lakes, peat bogs, and moorland. The species &quot;Triops longicaudatus&quot; is considered an agricultural pest in California rice paddies, because it prevents light from reaching the rice seedlings by stirring up sediment.

==Evolution and fossil record==
The fossil record of Notostraca is extensive, occurring in a wide range of geological deposits. The oldest known notostracan is the species &quot;Strudops goldenbergi&quot; from the Late Devonian (Famennian ~ 365 million years ago) of Belgium. The lack of major morphological change since has led to Notostraca being described as living fossils. Kazacharthra, a group known only from Triassic and Jurassic fossils from Kazakhstan and Western China, are closely related to notostracans, and may belong within the order Notostraca, or alternatively are placed as their sister group within the clade Calmanostraca.

The &quot;central autapomorphy&quot; of the Notostraca is the abandonment of filter feeding in open water, and the development of a benthic lifestyle in muddy waters, taking up food from particles of sediment and preying on small animals. A number of other characteristics are correlated with this change, including the increased size of the animal compared to its relatives, and the loss of the ability to hinge the carapace; although a central keel marks the former separation into two valves, the adductor muscle is missing. Notostracans retain the plesiomorphic condition of having two separate compound eyes, which abut, but have not become united, as seen in other groups of Branchiopoda.
==Taxonomy==
The extant members of order Notostraca composed a single family, Triopsidae, with only two genera, &quot;Triops&quot; and &quot;Lepidurus&quot;.
The problematic Middle Ordovician fossil &quot;Douglasocaris&quot; has been erected and placed in its own family Douglasocaridae by Caster &amp; Brooks 1956, and may be ancestral to Notostraca.

The phenotypic plasticity shown by notostracan species make identification to the species level difficult. Many putative species have been described based on morphological variation, such that by the 1950s, as many as 70 species were recognised. Two important revisions – those of Linder in 1952 and Longhurst in 1955 – synonymised many taxa, and resulted in the recognition of only 11 species in the two genera. This taxonomy was accepted for decades, &quot;even attaining the status of dogma&quot;. More recent studies, especially those employing molecular phylogenetics, have shown that the eleven currently recognised species conceal a greater number of reproductively isolated populations.

<doc id="1102911" wikidata="Q3078047" url="?curid=1102911" title="Fort St. Joseph (Niles, Michigan)">
<text>Fort Saint Joseph was a fort established on land granted to the Jesuits by King Louis XIV; it was located on what is now the south side of the present-day town of Niles, Michigan. Père Claude-Jean Allouez established the &quot;Mission de Saint-Joseph&quot; in the 1680s. Allouez ministered to the local Native Americans, who were primarily Odawa and Ojibwe.

The French built the fort in 1691 as a trading post on the lower Saint Joseph River. It was located where one branch of the Old Sauk Trail, a major east-west Native American trail, and the north-south Grand River Trail meet; together the combined trail fords the river. The fort was a significant stronghold of the fur trade at the southern end of Lake Michigan. Prior to the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe), the post had a French garrison of 10 soldiers, a commandant, blacksmith, Catholic priest, interpreter, and 15 additional households.

Following their victory in the war, the British took over the fort and maintained it for the fur trade. During the American Revolutionary War, they used it to supply their American Indian allies against the rebellious Continentals. The Spanish raided the fort in 1781 and briefly claimed it and the St. Joseph River as their territory. The British maintained the fort until after the United States victory in the Northwest Indian War and the signing of Jay&#x27;s Treaty in 1795. This settled the northern border. After the British abandoned the fort, it fell into ruin and was overtaken by forest.

The fort site was not rediscovered until 1998. An archeology excavation has been underway since 2002. Among the rare artifacts discovered is an intact Jesuit religious medallion from the 1730s, one of only two found in North America. In December 2010, the team revealed a foundation wall and corner posts of one of the original buildings.

The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a state-registered site as well.

==French and Indian War==
During the Battle of Jumonville Glen, considered the first battle of the French and Indian War in North America, Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was killed by Native Americans. He was the son of Nicolas-Antoine Coulon de Villiers and the half-brother of Captain Louis Coulon de Villiers, who was stationed at Fort St. Joseph and vowed revenge for his brother&#x27;s death. After Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the French transferred the fort to British forces, who occupied it in October 1761.

==Pontiac&#x27;s War==

On May 25, 1763, during Pontiac&#x27;s War, the fort, manned by 14 soldiers from the 60th Regiment of Foot, was captured by Potawatomi warriors. They killed most of the garrison outright, and took the commander, Ensign Francis Schlosser, captive along with three other soldiers. The Potawatomi took them to Fort Detroit to be ransomed as prisoners of war, as was common practice for high-ranking military personnel. After the conflict, the British maintained the fort as a trading post, but did not garrison it again until 1779, during the American Revolutionary War.

==American Revolutionary War==
===Raid of 1780===
During the American Revolutionary War, pro-British traders used Fort St. Joseph to equip the Miami, Potawatomi, and other British-allied Native Americans. In 1780, a Patriot force from Cahokia, Illinois, led by Jean-Baptiste Hamelin and Lieutenant Thomas Brady, raided the fort, plundering its content and capturing several traders. Detroit Militia officer Antoine Dagneaux de Quindre, an officer in British service, led forces after the raiding party; he overtook and defeated them near the Petit Fort.

===Spanish Expedition of 1781===
After the defeat of Hamelin&#x27;s party, two Milwaukee chiefs, &quot;El Heturnò&quot; and &quot;Naquiguen&quot;, traveled to Spanish-held St. Louis; they arrived on 26 December 1780, to report the failed raid. They asked for assistance to raid the fort again. Don Francisco Cruzat, Commandant of St. Louis, dispatched the militia Captain Don Eugenio Pouré with 60 volunteers and Native allies. The force also included Ensign Charles Tayon and the interpreter Louis Chevalier.

The Spanish and Native force travelled via the Illinois River and Kankakee River to modern Dunns Bridge, Indiana. There they turned northeast and marched overland to Fort St. Joseph. Before the Spanish and their allies attacked the fort, they promised the Potawatomi half the bounty if they would remain neutral. Captain Pouré took Fort St. Joseph by surprise on 12 February 1781 by racing across the frozen river and taking the fort before the defenders, who consisted solely of a &quot;Canadien&quot; trader named Duquier and several of his employees, could go to arms. 

He had the Spanish colors raised and claimed Fort St. Joseph and the St. Joseph River for Spain. His troops plundered the fort for one day, distributing the goods among natives before departing. Lt. Dagneau de Quindre arrived the next day, but was unable to persuade his native allies to pursue the raiders. The Spanish returned to St. Louis on 6 March without incident. Pouré delivered the British flag to Cruzat.

Some historians have described the attack as Spanish retaliation for the attack on St. Louis in the previous year. When Cruzat wrote about it to Governor Gálvez, he justified the raid as needing to appear strong to his Native allies, and to forestall British actions in the region. Although Cruzat treated the raid as an act of Indian affairs, the looting and destruction of goods held at Fort St. Joseph also dissuaded a second British attack into Spanish territory.

==Jay&#x27;s Treaty==
The British finally abandoned the fort after the United States victory in the Northwest Indian War and the signing of Jay&#x27;s Treaty in 1795. The fort gradually fell into ruin and was overgrown. Based on its Fort St. Joseph expedition, Spain claimed lands east of the Mississippi River, but this was not recognized by the United States. With the signing of Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty (1795) with the US, Spain gave up any claim of land east of the Mississippi.

Because of the long dispute over the land, the diplomats Benjamin Franklin and John Jay considered the Spanish campaign at Fort St. Joseph to have been little more than a ploy to claim the Northwest Territory. Franklin warned they want to &quot;shut us up within the Appalachian Mountains.&quot;

==Rediscovery to present==
Pothunters in the late 1800s recovered hundreds of artifacts from the fort site, which are now displayed in the Fort St. Joseph Museum in Niles. They include &quot;trade silver, musket parts, glass beads, buttons, gunflints, knife blades, and door hinges.&quot; The specific location of the 15-acre fort site was forgotten, and part of it is likely underwater since a dam downriver raised the water level.

The site was not rediscovered until an archeological survey in 1998. Support the Fort, a local interest group founded in 1992, has helped sponsor a major archeological excavation on site, which began in 2002.

The team from Western Michigan University (WMU) has conducted a public archeology program as the project has developed. A total of 10,000 visitors have attended the annual two-day field school. WMU&#x27;s related activities have included workshops for graduate students and volunteers, three week-long training programs for middle school and high school teachers, and community outreach, including biweekly lectures at the library.

The seasonal excavations have uncovered rare artifacts, such as a 1730s Jesuit religious medallion, one of only two found in North America. In December 2010 the team made a critical find of a foundation wall and two wooden posts of one of the buildings, helping establish its scale.

Support the Fort has arranged related annual living history exhibits and re-enactments, featuring elements of Potowatomi, French, British and American life at the fort and in the region. In the future, they intend to construct a replica of the fort. It will include space to interpret the artifacts found through controlled excavation. This was the only fort in Michigan to have been under the flags of four nations: France, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States. It was always a multicultural site, a meeting and trading place for the ethnic Europeans with the Potowatomi, Ottawa and Ojibwe nations. It was sometimes the scene for formal marriages among the ethnicities.

Le Comte&#x27;s grandmother, and Louis-Therese Chevalier were Indian diplomats at St. Joseph.

<text>The angel was an English gold coin introduced by Edward IV in 1465. It was patterned after the French or , which had been issued since 1340. The name derived from its representation of the archangel Michael slaying a dragon. As it was considered a new issue of the noble, it was also called the angel-noble.

In 1472, the half-angel was introduced with a similar design weighing 40 grains (2.6 grammes) with a diameter of 20 to 21 millimetres.

==Design==
Obverse 
The Archangel Michael standing over a dragon (representing The Devil) and piercing it with a spear.

Reverse:
Depicts a ship with the rays of the sun at the top of the cross-shaped masthead and an inescutcheon with the Royal Coat of Arms overall.&lt;br&gt;It was later replaced starting in the third coinage issue (1619-1624) of James I&#x27;s reign with a galleon in a trian-aspect view (simulated three-dimensional rendering), a straight pillar-shaped masthead, and its sails decorated with the Stuart Royal Coat of Arms. It is also shown reversed, or depicted towards the &quot;dexter&quot; (i.e., facing the right-hand side of the heraldic field, or left-hand side of the coin).

:Legend 1 (1344-1553): , Latin &gt; &quot;By Thy cross save us, Christ Redeemer.&quot; 
:Legend 2 (1553-1604): , Latin &gt; &quot;This was done by the Lord, and it is wondr[ous in our eyes].&quot; From Psalm 118; motto adopted by Mary I Tudor. 
:Legend 3 (1604-1624): , Latin &gt; &quot;&quot;This was done by the Lord&quot;.&quot; Truncated motto adopted by James I Stuart of England (James VI of Scotland). 
:Legend 4 (1625-1642): , Latin &gt; &quot;The love of the people is the protection of the king.&quot; Ironic motto adopted by Charles I Stuart. 
:Legend 5 (1660-1807): , Latin &gt; &quot;To God alone the glory.&quot; Used on non-circulating gold-plated touchpieces by the reigning House of Stuart from 1660 to 1714 and the Jacobite pretenders in exile from 1689 to 1807.

==Value==
The angel varied in value from 6 shillings 8 pence to 11 shillings between Edward&#x27;s reign and the time of James I.
* In 1526 during the reign of Henry VIII, it increased to seven shillings and six pence (7/6) or 90 pence. 
* In 1544, it increased again to eight shillings (8/-) or 96 pence. 
* In 1550 during the reign of Edward VI it increased to ten shillings (10/-) or 120 pence or £. 
* In 1612 during the reign of James I it increased to eleven shillings (11/-) or 132 pence.
* In 1619 it decreased to ten shillings (10/-) and at that point in time it weighed 70 grains (4.5 g).

It was last minted during the reign of Charles I in 1642 before the English Civil War (1642–1651). It was not minted during the Commonwealth under the rule of the Cromwells as it was seen as impious and idolatrous. In 1663, Charles II replaced the existing coinage with entirely new designs struck by machine (&quot;milled&quot;). The standard gold coin then became the Guinea.

===Touch Pieces===

In France and England there was a superstitious belief that the royal touch could cure scrofula, or &quot;the king&#x27;s evil&quot;. The kings of England often performed a ceremonial laying of hands on sufferers, and then gave each one a gold Angel coin. 
After his execution in 1649, royalists believed that Angel coins that had been given to sufferers by the &quot;martyred&quot; King Charles I could miraculously cure scrofula. In 1660, Charles II began handing out gold-plated &quot;touch-pieces&quot; in the place of Angel coins. This was continued by his successors until the death of Queen Anne Stuart in 1714, though it was briefly halted from 1689 to 1702 by Queen Mary II Stuart and her co-regent William III of Orange.

It was also practised by the exiled James II Stuart and the other Jacobite pretenders after he was deposed in 1689. (The Jacobite touch pieces were plated in silver instead of gold as an economy measure.) They were last issued by the fourth and final direct Jacobite pretender, &quot;Henry IX&quot; Stuart (the &quot;Cardinal King&quot;) until his death in 1807.

==Social impact==
The angel was such an iconic coin that many English pubs were named after it. The Angel Inn in Islington (after which the Angel tube station is named) was one of these.

The angel was traditionally given to people with the disease known as &quot;king&#x27;s evil&quot;, in a medieval ceremony intended to heal them with the &quot;royal touch&quot;. After it was no longer minted, medals with the same device (called touch pieces) were given instead.

The 1610 General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in Glasgow was named after the coins. M&#x27;Crie wrote: &quot;The bribery practised at this Assembly was shamefully notorious. Golden coins, called angels, were so plentifully distributed among the ministers, that it was called, by way of derision, the angelical Assembly.&quot;

<text>The River Rib is a tributary of the River Lea, which runs from Buckland in Hertfordshire, England. It flows into the River Lea to the east of Hertford.

==Course==

The River Rib originates near the East Hertfordshire village of Buckland and runs parallel with the A10 through Chipping, Wyddial, Buntingford, Westmill, and Braughing, where it is joined by its major tributary, the River Quin.

From Braughing, it flows through Puckeridge and Standon, before dividing the villages of Thundridge and Wadesmill and continuing until it reaches its confluence with the River Lea near Hertford.

==History==

The River Rib was used to power an overshot watermill at Ware Park between Hertford and Ware.

The River Rib used to have frequent floods due to heavy rain in the autumn, but this propensity was resolved by dredging and engineering work in the 1970s. 
It was used as the main water supply in Buntingford and the surrounding areas before a pump was installed

<doc id="1102935" wikidata="Q2200532" url="?curid=1102935" title="Atlanta Rhythm Section">
<text>Atlanta Rhythm Section (or ARS) is an American Southern rock band formed in 1970 by Rodney Justo (singer), Barry Bailey (guitar), Paul Goddard (bass), Dean Daughtry (keyboards), Robert Nix (drums) and J. R. Cobb (guitar). The band experienced its greatest chart success with Ronnie Hammond as lead singer 1972–1982. Hammond returned again 1988–2001. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of Justo, along with guitarists David Anderson and Steve Stone, keyboardist Lee Shealy, bassist Justin Senker and drummer Rodger Stephan.

== Early career ==
In the spring of 1970, former members of the Candymen (Rodney Justo, Dean Daughtry and Robert Nix) and the Classics IV (Daughtry and James B. Cobb Jr.) became the session band for the newly opened Studio One recording studio in Doraville, Georgia, near Atlanta.

After playing on other artists&#x27; recordings, the Atlanta Rhythm Section was christened in May 1970, with Justo (singer), Barry Bailey (guitar), Paul Goddard (bass), Daughtry (keyboards), Nix (drums) and Cobb (guitar). Bailey and Goddard had played together in several groups and, like the Candymen, had also backed up Roy Orbison. The group&#x27;s name was thought up by Studio One&#x27;s owner Buddy Buie and his two partners in the venture, Cobb and Bill Lowery.

Signed by Decca Records, the band released their first album, &quot;Atlanta Rhythm Section&quot;, in January 1972. Due to the record&#x27;s limited commercial success, Justo quit the band, relocating to New York City as a session singer. He was replaced by Ronnie Hammond, assistant to Studio One&#x27;s engineer, Rodney Mills. Mills also later worked as the band&#x27;s road manager and sound man and Buie, also the band&#x27;s manager and producer as well as co-owner of Studio One, is listed first on almost all of their songwriting credits. With Hammond on board, the band&#x27;s second release, &quot;Back Up Against the Wall&quot; (February 1973), also failed to sell and Decca dumped ARS from their roster.

Buie&#x27;s manager, Jeff Franklin, who was based in New York and had gotten the group the deal with Decca, was then able to get ARS signed to Polydor for their third release, &quot;Third Annual Pipe Dream&quot;, in August 1974. As a special thank-you to Bailey, Daughtry, and Goddard for appearing on his pioneering 1970 Christian Rock album &quot;Mylon, We Believe&quot;, Mylon LeFevre performed on one of the &quot;Pipe Dream&quot; tracks, &quot;Jesus Hearted People&quot; (Buie, Bailey, Goddard, Daughtry and Rodney Mills had all been regular players at Master Sound and LeFevre&#x27;s studio, LeFevre Sound, before they built Studio One). &quot;Pipe Dream&quot; yielded the band&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;Doraville&quot;, which peaked at #35 and pulled the album up to #74 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 200 by November 1974.

The band&#x27;s next two releases, &quot;Dog Days&quot; (August 1975) and &quot;Red Tape&quot; (April 1976), sold in even lesser quantities, but ARS toured extensively in 1975–1976, with numerous shows in the South, Northeast and Midwest. On July 18, 1975, the band appeared with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra during an outdoor show in Atlanta in Chastain Park; in August, they opened for The Who at the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida and for The Rolling Stones at the Municipal Auditorium in West Palm Beach, Florida.

== Hit years ==

The increased exposure paid off as the group&#x27;s next album, &quot;A Rock and Roll Alternative&quot; (December 1976), rose to #13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and was certified gold in the spring of 1977. The debut single from the record, &quot;So in to You&quot;, peaked at #7 on April 30.

On September 3, 1977, ARS played their biggest show yet, the Dog Day Rockfest at Atlanta&#x27;s Grant Field on the campus of Georgia Tech. Heart and Foreigner were the opening acts and Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band co-headlined with ARS.

In January 1978 ARS released what would turn out to be its most successful album, &quot;Champagne Jam&quot;, which led off with the song &quot;Large Time&quot;, a tribute to Lynyrd Skynyrd, some of whom had lost their lives in a plane crash the previous October. &quot;Champagne Jam&quot; became their biggest-selling album, selling over a million and certified platinum. The album provided two more hits for the band, &quot;Imaginary Lover&quot; (#7) and &quot;I&#x27;m Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight&quot; (#14).

On June 24, 1978, the band appeared at the Knebworth Festival in Knebworth, England before a crowd of 60,000 on a bill that included Genesis, Jefferson Starship, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Brand X, Devo and Roy Harper. 

On July 1, 1978, the band played before more than 80,000 at Texxas Jam at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas, with various other artists including Walter Egan, Van Halen, Eddie Money, Head East, Journey, Heart, Ted Nugent and Aerosmith. On August 26, 1978, it was Canada Jam at Mosport Park in Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada, before their largest audience yet (over 110,000) with the Doobie Brothers and the Commodores, among others. The following week, ARS had a rock festival of their own, Champagne Jam, at Grant Field at Georgia Tech on September 3, 1978, which also included Santana, the Doobie Brothers, Eddie Money, Mose Jones and Mother&#x27;s Finest.

Three weeks later, they appeared on the White House lawn at President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s invitation for his son Chip&#x27;s 28th birthday party. The band had previously met Carter while he was still governor of Georgia during a press junket for their third album and had campaigned for him in 1976 during his run for the presidency.

The eighth Atlanta Rhythm Section album, &quot;Underdog&quot;, was released in June 1979 and produced Top 20 hits &quot;Do It or Die&quot; (#19) and &quot;Spooky&quot; (#17), a remake of Cobb&#x27;s and Buie&#x27;s 1968 Classics IV hit.

Early in 1979, drummer Robert Nix, the group&#x27;s primary lyricist, had a falling out with manager/producer Buie over the group&#x27;s musical direction. Nix wished to move the band in a more rocking direction while Buie was content with their current approach, which incorporated the mellower ballads. The rest of the band&#x27;s dissatisfaction with Nix&#x27;s excessive &quot;lifestyle choices&quot; sealed his fate and he was replaced by Roy Yeager, who had previously played for Lobo.

Champagne Jam II, on July 7, 1979, at Georgia Tech featured ARS, Aerosmith, the Cars, Dixie Dregs, Mother&#x27;s Finest and Whiteface. That October, an ARS live performance from Studio One was released as the double live set &quot;Are You Ready&quot;.

== Decline and departures ==
In August 1980 ARS performed three concerts in Japan alongside Cheap Trick and other acts as a part of &quot;Japan Jam 2&quot;.

&quot;The Boys from Doraville&quot; (August 1980) showed a steep falling off in sales for the group as radio programmers began turning their attention away from Southern rock to other rock genres, such as new wave. The album provided no hit singles and was their last for Polydor. Another reason for the drop-off in sales may have been the departure of their advocate, Arnie Geller, from Polydor in 1977 to form the Buie/Geller Organization and BGO Records with Buddy Buie. As a result, the group departed Polydor, which led to a breach of contract lawsuit from the company that was later settled in the band&#x27;s favor.

Bruce Lundvall offered a better deal at Columbia Records (CBS), who released the next ARS album, &quot;Quinella&quot; in August 1981, containing the hit &quot;Alien&quot; (#29) but, like &quot;The Boys From Doraville&quot;, struggled with sales.

In 1982 ARS worked on a second album for CBS, to be titled &quot;Longing For A Feeling&quot; (&quot;Sleep With One Eye Open&quot;, a song on the unreleased album, had also been put forth as a possible title). Before completion, CBS wanted the band to drop some of the tracks and record more. Buie and the band refused, the album was shelved, and CBS dropped its contract with ARS. &quot;It kind of put the brakes on their career&quot;, said producer Bill Lowery, &quot;And the other problem was that we couldn&#x27;t get out of our contract. From what I remember, they toyed with us for months.&quot;

Late in 1982, singer Ronnie Hammond decided to leave ARS for a solo career, joined by Buie (who ceased managing ARS), though their work with Alabama musicians never resulted in commercial release. After buying out his partners, Buie continued to run Studio One until 1986 when he sold it to Georgia State University. Unfortunately, the cost of running the studio was too high and it was closed in 1989, and later torn down. Buie died at age 74 on July 18, 2015.

Drummer Roy Yeager tripped over a fallen tree while the band was on tour in Daytona Beach in 1982 and suffered a severe broken leg. One of the band&#x27;s road crew, Danny Biget, took over on drums, and ARS persuaded Rodney Justo to return to do some shows in early 1983. Justo had moved from session singer to lead singer again in the mid-1970s with a group from Alabama called Beaverteeth. He then left the music industry for a number of years and eventually took up a sales position with a wine company.

During 1983–1984, the group went to Nashville and tried working with Buddy Buie&#x27;s former associate Chips Moman, a more country-oriented producer, on a proposed new record label called Triad, in conjunction with producer Buddy Killen and former Capricorn Records head Phil Walden. But results were slow to come and, dissatisfied with the country music direction, bassist Paul Goddard and drummer Biget left to work with British producer Eddy Offord in another band with former Dixie Dregs keyboardist T Lavitz and guitarist Pat Buchanan, called Interpol, that was in a more progressive rock direction; unfortunately, Interpol never got off the ground. The Chips Moman Nashville project, which was given the tentative name &quot;Hardball&quot;, was completed but the album, like their previous effort for CBS, has never been released.

Two new members, Tommy Stribling (bass) and Keith Hamrick (drums), joined in late 1983 and ARS, now without a recording contract, continued to play shows, mostly in the South. Greenville, South Carolina native Andy Anderson, who&#x27;d been playing with Billy Joe Royal, was recommended by his friend Hamrick as the new front man and sang on the unreleased Moman project after Justo was let go.

In 1985 the group tried a new singer, Jeff Logan, who had previously been a trombone player with a band called High Cotton. Logan did two shows but did not work out because his higher voice did not fit the band, was not really a frontman, and had not learned the songs. Anderson soon returned as lead vocalist. Bassist Stribling went on to leave in February 1986, turning it over to Steve Stone.

In late 1986, J. R. Cobb left to concentrate more on songwriting and session work at Moman&#x27;s new studio in Memphis (for The Highwaymen, among others) and Stribling came back to play guitar. The personnel shuffles continued as Hamrick also departed in late 1986 and was replaced by Sean Burke (who joined in early 1987). Another new lead singer, Shaun Williamson, was rolled in in 1987. But in 1988, Williamson and Stribling were let go as Bailey and Daughtry sought to revamp the band by bringing back Ronnie Hammond.

== Ronnie Hammond returns ==

In 1988 Hammond, Bailey, and Daughtry returned to the studio with Sean Burke and two new players, Brendan O&#x27;Brien (guitar) and J. E. Garnett (bass), to produce a new album with Buddy Buie and Rodney Mills that had more of an &quot;&#x27;80s rock sound&quot;.

Released in October 1989 on the CBS/Epic subsidiary label Imagine, &quot;Truth in a Structured Form&quot;, ARS&#x27;s first album in eight years, featured a heavy drum sound that propelled almost every track and a sharper, more synthesized gloss over the songs, with all, except one, being written by Buddy Buie and Ronnie Hammond, another departure from their previous approach. O&#x27;Brien, who was co-producer as well as guitarist on the album, was invited to go on the road with the band but he declined, preferring to continue his career in session work (today he is a much-in-demand producer, having worked with Bob Dylan, Pearl Jam, and Bruce Springsteen).

Steve Stone then returned, as guitarist this time. But album sales for &quot;Truth&quot; lagged and there was another hiatus in their recorded work as the band continued to tour, with Burke&#x27;s friend Justin Senker replacing Garnett on bass in May 1992 (after subbing a show for him late the previous year in Louisville, Kentucky) and R.J. Vealey taking over the drum chair from Burke in 1995 after the latter suffered a leg injury.

In 1995 the group went back into the studio, this time to re-record some of their classic songs. This new collection was recorded in North Carolina and the resulting live-in-studio sound of &quot;Atlanta Rhythm Section &#x27;96&quot; (released on CMC International in April 1996) presented a different, less polished take on some of their classic tunes and captured the sound of their live performances from that period. It was also around this time that ARS was elected to the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. The band, joined by &quot;classic era&quot; members Cobb, Nix and Goddard, was honored at a September 1996 induction ceremony at the Georgia World Congress Center.

ARS then recorded &quot;Partly Plugged,&quot; which was released in January 1997 on the independent Southern Tracks label. It featured some new songs and more remakes of some classics.

On December 28, 1998, singer Ronnie Hammond, who had battled alcoholism and depression off and on over the years, got into a confrontation with police in Macon, Georgia and was subsequently shot by the police officer. Hammond was seriously injured but survived the injury, though he suffered from depression afterwards.

The band&#x27;s fifteenth album, &quot;Eufaula&quot;, was released in February 1999 but problems occurred almost immediately as the record label, Platinum Entertainment, faced financial troubles and was not able to support the album as intended.

ARS continued to tour on a limited basis. But on November 13, 1999, tragedy struck. After the band had finished an afternoon set at a concert festival in Orlando, Florida, 37-year-old drummer R. J. Vealey complained of indigestion and then collapsed and died of a heart attack. &quot;It was very sudden, very shocking&quot;, said guitarist Barry Bailey. &quot;He was a great drummer, the best drummer this band ever had.&quot; ARS then continued on upon recruiting new drummer Jim Keeling.

== Later changes ==
In early 1999, with Hammond hospitalized, Andy Anderson came back to front the band until Hammond was well enough to return. Anderson would come again in May 2000 to sub another show for Hammond. But in 2001, Anderson was back again after Hammond decided to take a gig with another group, Voices of Classic Rock. Hammond left touring altogether soon afterward to focus on family and songwriting. A retirement show for Hammond was held on December 6, 2002, at the club Whiskey River in Macon. Hammond performed, backed by Dean Daughtry, Justin Senker, Steve Stone, Jim Keeling, Wendall Cox (from Travis Tritt&#x27;s band) and Mike Causey (from Stillwater). Hammond died on March 14, 2011, in Forsyth, Georgia, at age 60 of heart failure.

In early 2006, Barry Bailey, suffering from multiple sclerosis, retired from the group to take care of his wife, who was sick with cancer. Steve Stone played most of the lead guitar parts from this point on and Andy Anderson&#x27;s long-time Billy Joe Royal bandmate Alan Accardi was brought in as second guitarist. Accardi, a Nashville veteran, would stay with the band for more than a year before a friend of Jim Keeling, Huntsville, Alabama native David Anderson, from the band Brother Cane, was brought in as the new guitarist in April 2007.

In 2006 former ARS drummer Roy Yeager was involved in a controversy concerning the destruction of a Tennessee American Civil War landmark.

On March 26, 2008, singer Andy Anderson suffered a heart attack just before he was to catch a plane to Las Vegas to join the band for a two-night stand at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino. Andy&#x27;s friend Steve Croson (who&#x27;d played alongside him for years in Billy Joe Royal&#x27;s band) lived in Vegas and was able to step in on short notice. In April and May, original singer Rodney Justo returned, joined by ARS&#x27;s 1987–88 singer Shaun Williamson, until Andy was healthy enough to return in May.

== Return of Paul Goddard and Rodney Justo ==
In May 2011, original lead vocalist Rodney Justo returned to the group, nearly forty years after his 1972 departure. Original bassist Paul Goddard returned as well, after a 28-year absence. Goddard&#x27;s second tenure with the band was short-lived, however, as he died of cancer on April 29, 2014.

After Goddard&#x27;s death, ARS continued to play shows with a lineup of Rodney Justo, Dean Daughtry, Steve Stone, Dave Anderson, Justin Senker and Jim Keeling. Keeling, who left ARS to spend more time with his family, was replaced in March 2016 by Justo&#x27;s friend Rodger Stephan (who had also played drums with Marty Balin).

== Present day ==
The band still tours, playing mostly festivals and nostalgia-themed concerts.

Their most recent album of new recordings, &quot;With All Due Respect&quot; (May 2011), was largely covers of other artists&#x27; songs (Lynyrd Skynyrd, Allman Brothers, etc.) alongside re-recordings of classic ARS tunes, done at Southern Tracks Studios with longtime engineer Rodney Mills. The album also featured guest performances by Rodney Justo and Paul Goddard, just before they rejoined the group, and Ronnie Hammond, in his final recorded appearance.

&quot;From The Vaults&quot; (May 2012), released on both the Fuel and Sunset Blvd Records labels, was a double CD collection of unreleased tracks both studio and live and even featured some pre-ARS Candymen performances. &quot;From The Vaults&quot; was re-released in the summer of 2023 under the title &quot;Time Machine&quot; with many of the same and some different tracks.

During the spring of 2017, Rome, Georgia keyboardist Lee Shealy was brought in to sub for Dean Daughtry, who had a broken wrist. And from August to October of that same year, singer Andy Anderson returned to the band yet again to stand in for Justo, who was recovering from back surgery.

ARS founder and guitarist J.R. Cobb and his wife, Bertha Ann &quot;Bert&quot; Absher, married in 1967 and had one son, Justin. They lived in Monticello, Georgia for more than 30 years. Cobb died of a heart attack on May 4, 2019, at the age of 75, at Piedmont Newton Hospital in Covington, Georgia.

At the start of 2020, Lee Shealy, having been called to fill in for keyboardist Daughtry at various times from 2017 on, returned for good after Daughtry announced his retirement from performing.

In 2014, Paul Goddard died. Barry Bailey died in his sleep on March 12, 2022, at the age of 73, after years of deterioration from multiple sclerosis.

During the spring and summer of 2022, the band&#x27;s guitarist David Anderson subbed on lead vocals after Justo had to tend to his ailing wife, Shirley, who died on July 11.

ARS co-founder and keyboardist Dean Daughtry died in Huntsville, Alabama on January 26, 2023, of natural causes at age 76, leaving Justo as the last surviving original member.

<text>Darwin Ortiz (1948 – 2023) was a magician who was an authority on gambling and card manipulation.

==Life and work==
Ortiz was born and raised in New York City, where he had a keen interest in card tricks since childhood. His first exposure to sleight-of-hand was via card cheats in his neighborhood. In 1974, he dropped out of NYU Law School and pursued card magic full-time. During that time, he initially supported himself playing blackjack (using card counting techniques) and as an instructor at Harry Lorayne&#x27;s memory school in New York City. Ortiz was a contemporary and close friend of the influential US coin magician, David Roth, and was initially mentored by the seminal British/US close-up performer, Derek Dingle.

Ortiz later became a consultant to a number of casinos in the United States, Europe, Africa, UK and Australasia, and was a regular featured presenter for a succession of years at the World Gaming Congress in Nevada.

Ortiz died on October 13, 2023, after suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Books==

Ortiz was a highly esteemed author of magic and gambling books. Ortiz was not only a magician, but also a highly proficient card mechanic, specializing in the sleight-of-hand techniques used by professional card cheats (such as crooked dealing and stacking the deck). He was particularly respected for his written contributions on the theory of magic. According to Vanishing Inc Magic, &quot;Darwin Ortiz is unparalleled in his theoretical writings. His two theory books, &quot;Designing Miracles&quot; and &quot;Strong Magic&quot; are, in our estimation, some of the most important writings on magic written in the last two decades.&quot;

His book &quot;Strong Magic&quot; focuses on practical presentational techniques for close-up magicians. Ortiz&#x27;s second book on magic theory, &quot;Designing Miracles&quot; is an exposition on the design of powerful magical effects, and is subtitled &quot;Creating the Illusion of Impossibility&quot;. The book posits and analyzes various theories regarding the perception and cognition of lay audiences and provides practical examples and advice on the construction of effects, aimed at maximizing their impact and deceptiveness to a lay audience. 

The last book published with Darwin Ortiz&#x27;s original routines was &quot;Lessons in Card Mastery&quot;. 

Ortiz&#x27;s major work for the lay public on gaming protection is &quot;Gambling Scams&quot; 1984. He also authored an annotation of S. W. Erdnase&#x27;s &quot;The Expert at the Card Table&quot; titled &quot;The Annotated Erdnase&quot; in 1991 which was published to the magic trade.

<text>The Angelus (; Latin for &quot;angel&quot;) is a Catholic devotion commemorating the Incarnation of Christ. As with many Catholic prayers, the name &quot;Angelus&quot; is derived from its incipit—the first few words of the text: (&quot;The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary&quot;). The devotion is practised by reciting as versicle and response three Biblical verses narrating the mystery, alternating with the prayer &quot;Hail Mary&quot;. The Angelus exemplifies a species of prayers called the &quot;prayer of the devotee&quot;.

The devotion is traditionally recited in Roman Catholic churches, convents, monasteries and by the faithful three times a day: in the morning, at noon and in the evening (usually just before or after Vespers). The devotion is also observed by some Western Rite Orthodox, Lutheran, and Anglican churches.

The Angelus is usually accompanied by the ringing of the Angelus church bells, which is a call to prayer and to spread goodwill to everyone. The angel referred to in the prayer is Gabriel, a messenger of God who revealed to the Virgin Mary that she would conceive a child to be born the Son of God (Luke 1:26–38). In Eastertide, the Angelus is replaced by the Regina Coeli.

==History==
According to Herbert Thurston, the Angelus originated with the 11th-century monastic custom of reciting three Hail Marys at the evening, or Compline, bell.

The first written documentation stems from the Italian Franciscan friar Sinigardi di Arezzo (died 1282). Franciscan friaries in Italy document the use in 1263 and 1295. The current form of the Angelus prayer is included in a Venetian Catechism from 1560. The older usages seem to have commemorated the resurrection of Christ in the morning, his suffering at noon, and the annunciation in the evening. In 1269, St Bonaventure urged the faithful to adopt the custom of the Franciscans of saying three Hail Marys as the Compline bell was rung.

The Angelus is not identical to the &quot;noon bell&quot; ordered by Pope Calixtus III (1455–58) in 1456, who asked for a long midday bell-ringing and prayer for protection against the Turkish invasions of his time. In his 1956 Apostolic Letter &quot;Dum Maerenti Animo&quot; about the persecution of the Catholic church in Eastern Europe and China, Pope Pius XII recalls the 500th anniversary of the &quot;noon bell&quot;, a prayer crusade ordered by his predecessors against what they considered to be dangers from the East. He again asks the faithful throughout the world, to pray for the persecuted Church in the East during the mid-day Angelus.

The custom of reciting it in the morning apparently grew from the monastic custom of saying three Hail Marys while a bell rang at Prime. The noon time custom apparently arose from the noon time commemoration of the Passion on Fridays. The institution of the Angelus is by some ascribed to Pope Urban II, by some to Pope John XXII in the year 1317. The triple recitation is ascribed to Louis XI of France, who in 1472 ordered it to be recited three times daily. The form of the prayer was standardised by the 17th century.

The manner of ringing the Angelus—the triple stroke repeated three times, with a pause between each set of three (a total of nine strokes), sometimes followed by a longer peal as at curfew—seems to have been long established. The 15th-century constitutions of Syon monastery dictate that the lay brother &quot;shall toll the Ave bell nine strokes at three times, keeping the space of one Pater and Ave between each three tollings&quot;. The pattern of ringing on Irish RTÉ Radio One and television, RTÉ One, consists of three groups of three peals, each group separated by a pause, followed by a group of nine peals, for a total of eighteen rings.

In his Apostolic Letter &quot;Marialis Cultus&quot; (1974), Pope Paul VI encouraged the praying of the Angelus considering it important and a reminder to faithful Catholics of the Paschal Mystery, in which by recalling the incarnation of the son of God they pray that they may be led &quot;through his passion and cross to the glory of his resurrection.&quot;
==Modern usage==
It is common practice that during the recital of the Angelus prayer, for the lines &quot;And the Word was made flesh/And dwelt among us&quot;, those reciting the prayer bow or genuflect. Either of these actions draws attention to the moment of the Incarnation of Christ into human flesh.

During Paschaltide, the Marian antiphon &quot;Regina Cœli&quot; with versicle and prayer, is said in place of the Angelus.

In some Catholic schools, the Angelus is recited periodically. In most Franciscan and contemplative monasteries, the Angelus is prayed three times a day.

===Angelus broadcasts===
In Germany, particular dioceses and their radio stations broadcast the Angelus. In addition, Roman Catholic churches (and some Protestant ones) ring the Angelus bell thrice daily.

In Ireland, &quot;The Angelus&quot; is currently broadcast every night before the main evening news at 18:00 on the main national TV channel, RTÉ One, and on the broadcaster&#x27;s sister radio station, Radio 1, at noon and 18:00. In 2015, in advertising for a commission to independent film makers to produce versions of the Angelus, RTÉ described the playing of the Angelus as follows:

The daily &quot;Angelus&quot; broadcast on RTÉ One is by far RTÉ&#x27;s longest-running and most watched Religious programme. It&#x27;s also, possibly, the most controversial. For some, the reflective slot, which airs for just one minute in every 1440 per day and on only one RTÉ TV channel, is as much part of Ireland&#x27;s unique cultural identity as the harp on your passport; for others, it&#x27;s an anachronism – a reminder of more homogeneously and observantly Christian times.

As of 2015, RTÉ Audience Research found that a clear majority of Irish viewers still favour keeping the &quot;Angelus&quot; broadcasts, chimes and all. Its appeal is summarised by one audience member as follows: &quot;To the person of faith, it&#x27;s a moment of grace; to the person without faith, it&#x27;s a moment of peace. What&#x27;s not to like?&quot; The station also notes that the prayer itself is never broadcast, whether in vocal or text form.

The Angelus is broadcast daily on radio in the city of Monterrey, Mexico, at 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00.

In Brazil, radio stations associated with the Catholic Radio Network (&quot;Rede Católica de Rádio&quot; in Portuguese) broadcast the Angelus daily at 18:00; radio stations that are not affiliated with the network but are run by Catholic personnel also broadcast the prayer at the same hour.

In the Philippines, radio and television stations of the Philippine Catholic Church and some religious orders broadcast the Angelus at 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 PST (GMT+8). The devotion is also broadcast over the public address system at noon and 18:00 in some shopping malls, and in many Catholic educational institutions at noon on schooldays. Individual parish churches also ring bells at 18:00. It was once custom for a family to be home by the evening Angelus, where it is recited kneeling in front of the house altar.

In the United States and Canada, some Catholic radio stations run by laity broadcast the Angelus daily. American Trappist monasteries and convents often combine the Angelus with midday prayers or Vespers and pray them together in the Church. At the Roman Catholic University of Portland, the bell tower near the centre of campus peels the Angelus at noon and 18:00.

Slovak Catholic Rádio Lumen broadcasts the Angelus and other prayers daily for 10 minutes at noon. Likewise, TV Lux broadcasts the Angelus regularly.

===Indulgences===
The singular prayer of the Angelus grants a partial indulgence. The &quot;Raccolta&quot; (superseded by the &quot;Enchiridion Indulgentiarum&quot; in 1968) includes an indulgence for praying the Angelus monthly. It was originally granted by Pope Benedict XIII in 1724 as a plenary indulgence. 

===Papal custom===
In Vatican City since Pope John XXIII, the Pope delivers an address in Italian every Sunday at noon (except Easter Sunday which the address is given on Easter Monday instead). Pope John XXIII spoke of the Angelus &quot;as a summary of &#x27;the Christian epic&#x27; in three books: the divine invitation and initiative; the human response of obedience, &quot;fiat&quot;; and the result of this obedience, the Word made flesh.&quot;

Known informally as the Angelus Address (“Regina Cœli Address” during Eastertide), the short ritual is broadcast live at 12 p.m. (noon - Central European Time) on online platforms (Vatican News - with simultaneous interpretation), by public television (Rai 1) and through Eurovision Network. At the end of the Address, the Pope leads recitation of the Angelus or Regina Cœli, and concludes with a blessing upon the crowds in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square and televiewers.

===Anglican practice===
The Angelus is found in two popular twentieth-century Anglo-Catholic manuals of devotion. &quot;The Practice of Religion: A Short Manual of Instructions and Devotions&quot; by Archibald Campbell Knowles, first published in 1908, refers to the Angelus as &quot;the memorial of the Incarnation&quot; and notes that &quot;In the Mystery of the Incarnation we worship and adore Our Lord as God of God, we honour and reverence Saint Mary as &#x27;Blessed among women.&#x27; In honouring Mary, the Instrument of the Incarnation, we really honour Christ, Who became Incarnate.&quot;

The Angelus is also found in &quot;Saint Augustine&#x27;s Prayer Book: A Book of Devotion for members of the Episcopal Church&quot;, first published in 1947 (Revised Edition, 1967).

In many Anglo-Catholic communities of the Anglican Communion, there is a tradition of singing the Angelus, particularly before or after the Sunday parish Mass. The practice has spread more commonly into Roman Catholicism through the Ordinariate jurisdictions for former Anglicans.

===Latin===

&quot;℣&quot;. &quot;Angelus Domini nuntiavit Mariæ,&quot;
&quot;℟&quot;. &quot;Et concepit de Spiritu Sancto.&quot;

&quot;Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in mulieribus, et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus. * Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc et in hora mortis nostræ. Amen.&quot;

&quot;℣&quot;. &quot;Ecce ancilla Domini.&quot;
&quot;℟&quot;. &quot;Fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum.&quot;

&quot;Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in mulieribus, et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus. * Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc et in hora mortis nostræ. Amen.&quot;

&quot;℣&quot;. &quot;Et Verbum caro factum est.&quot;
&quot;℟&quot;. &quot;Et habitavit in nobis.&quot;

&quot;Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in mulieribus, et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus. * Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc et in hora mortis nostræ. Amen.&quot;

&quot;℣&quot;. &quot;Ora pro nobis, Sancta Dei Genitrix.&quot;
&quot;℟&quot;. &quot;Ut digni efficiamur promissionibus Christi.&quot;

&quot;Oremus&quot;. &quot;Gratiam tuam, quæsumus, Domine, mentibus nostris infunde; ut qui, Angelo nuntiante, Christi Filii tui incarnationem cognovimus, per passionem eius et Crucem ad resurrectionis gloriam perducamur. Per eundem Christum Dominum nostrum.&quot;
&quot;℟&quot;: &quot;Amen.&quot;

===English===
&quot;℣&quot;. The Angel of the declared unto Mary,
&quot;℟&quot;. And she conceived of the Holy Spirit.

Hail Mary, full of grace; the is with thee: blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, Jesus.* Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.

&quot;℣&quot;. Behold the handmaid of the .
&quot;℟&quot;. Be it done unto me according to thy word.

Hail Mary, full of grace; the is with thee: blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, Jesus.* Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.

&quot;℣&quot;. And the Word was made flesh.
&quot;℟&quot;. And dwelt among us.

Hail Mary, full of grace; the is with thee: blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, Jesus.* Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.

&quot;℣&quot;. Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.
&quot;℟&quot;. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Let us pray,
Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O , Thy grace into our hearts; that, we, to whom the Incarnation of Christ, Thy Son, was made known by the message of an angel, may by His Passion and Cross be brought to the glory of His Resurrection. Through the same Christ our Lord.

&quot;℟&quot;. Amen.

In some places, the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot; is added, either once or thrice.&lt;br&gt;

&quot;℣&quot;. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. &lt;br &gt;
&quot;℟&quot;. As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end.
Amen.

In the published Anglican versions of the Angelus, the text of the concluding collect reads: 
We beseech Thee, O LORD, pour Thy grace into our hearts; that as we have known the Incarnation of Thy Son, Jesus Christ, by the message of an angel, so by His Cross and Passion we may be brought unto the glory of His Resurrection. Through the same Jesus Christ our Lord.

==Indulgence==
Pope Benedict XIII on 14 September 1724 added to the recitation of the Angelus the 100-day indulgence for the faithful who recited it on their knees (standing on Saturday evenings and Sundays) at dawn, at midday and at sunset, at the ringing of the bell. Leo XIII (1878-1903) modified, making them easier, the conditions for obtaining the gift of indulgence. Until the reform of indulgences implemented by Pope Paul VI in 1967 was still granted the indulgence of 100 and plenary once a month, provided that he had recited it every day at the three prescribed times of the day (dawn, midday, sunset), and had confessed and communicated.

The &quot;Enchiridion Indulgentiarum&quot; includes a partial indulgence for the faithful who recite the Angelus in the three prescribed times. As with all indulgences, it is necessary to be in a state of grace; furthermore, the indulgence is applicable to oneself or to the souls of the deceased, but is not applicable to other living people on earth.

==Angelus bell==

The Angelus, in all its stages of development, was closely associated with the ringing of a church bell. The bell is still rung in some English country churches and has often been mistaken for, and alleged to be a remnant of, the curfew bell. The Angelus bell is not rung on Good Friday and Holy Saturday.

Where the town bell and the bells of the principal church or monastery were distinct, the curfew was generally rung upon the town bell. Where the church bell served for both purposes, the Ave and the curfew were probably rung upon the same bell at different hours.

The ringing of the Angelus in the 14th century and even in the 13th century must have been very general. The number of bells belonging to these two centuries that still survive is relatively low, but a considerable proportion bear inscriptions that suggest that they were originally intended to serve as Ave bells. Such bells bear words like &quot;Missi de coelis nomen habeo Gabrielis&quot; (&quot;I bear the name of Gabriel sent from heaven&quot;) or &quot;Missus vero pie Gabriel fert laeta Mariae&quot; (&quot;Gabriel the messenger brings joyous tidings to holy Mary&quot;).

Bells inscribed with &quot;Ave Maria&quot; are also numerous in England, but there the Angelus bells seem in a very large number of instances to have been dedicated to St Gabriel, the angel mentioned in the prayer (Luke 1:26–27). In the Diocese of Lincoln alone there are nineteen surviving medieval bells bearing the name of Gabriel, while only six bear the name of Michael, a much more popular patron in other respects.

In France, the &quot;Ave Maria&quot; seems to have been the ordinary label for Angelus bells; but in Germany the most common inscription of all, even in the case of many bells of the 13th century, is the words &quot;O Rex Gloriæ Veni Cum Pace&quot; (&quot;O King of Glory, Come with Peace&quot;). In Germany, the Netherlands, and in some parts of France, the Angelus bell was regularly known as the &quot;Peace bell&quot;, and &quot;pro pace schlagen&quot; (to toll for peace) was a phrase popularly used for ringing the Angelus.

In Italy, the three recitals of the Angelus are referred to as &quot;avemmaria&quot;, hence &quot;L&#x27; avemmaria del giorno&quot;, &quot;L&#x27; avemmaria del mezzo giorno&quot; and &quot;L&#x27; avemmaria della sera&quot;. It was customary at one time to calculate hours of the day from the evening Angelus, or &quot;avemmaria&quot; for short. Hence the origin of the phrase that appears in Leoncavallo&#x27;s opera &quot;Pagliacci&quot;: &quot;venti tre ore&quot;&#x27; (&quot;the twenty-third hour&quot;) refers to one hour before the evening Angelus.

In Slovakia, mainly the noon Angelus was commonly referred to as &quot;na Anjel Pána&quot; (at Angelus), similar to Czech &quot;na Anděl Páně&quot;. These terms were also part of their contemporary artistic works.

==Poetry==
The poem &quot;The Irish Unionist&#x27;s Farewell&quot; by Sir John Betjeman has the line &quot;and the Angelus is calling&quot;.

Francis Bret Harte wrote &quot;The Angelus&quot; referencing the twilight tolling of the Angelus bell at a Californian mission.

Denis Florence MacCarthy&#x27;s poem &quot;The Bell-Founder&quot; describes the fashioning of Angelus bells.

Angelus is mentioned in Book 11 of &quot;Pan Tadeusz&quot; by Adam Mickiewicz.

Francis Jammes&#x27; most famous collection of poems is the 1897 &quot;De l&#x27;angélus de l&#x27;aube à l&#x27;angélus du soir&quot; (&quot;From morning Angelus to evening Angelus&quot;).

In &quot;The Angelus&quot;, Donegal poet Elizabeth Shane portrays an elderly couple cutting peat reminiscent of the scene in Millet&#x27;s painting.

In a poem set to music circa 1919, &quot;The Foggy Dew&quot;, Canon Charles O&#x27;Neill (1887–1963) memorialized the Easter Rising also known as the Easter Rebellion of 1916. One of the lines reads: &quot;But the Angelus Bell o&#x27;er the Liffey&#x27;s swell rang out in the foggy dew&quot;.

A poem by Edgar Allan Poe, &quot;A Catholic Hymn&quot;, and various similar titles in 1835 as part of a short story and again in 1845. Apparently written after hearing the Angelus bells whilst passing a church.

In &quot;The Dry Salvages&quot;, T.S. Eliot analogizes a fog bell floating on the ocean to a &quot;perpetual Angelus&quot;.

== Music ==
Franz Biebl set the prayer for two men&#x27;s choirs, called Ave Maria (Angelus Domini), published also in versions for mixed choirs.

<text>Roy Albert DeMeo (; September 7, 1940 – January 10, 1983) was an American mobster in the Gambino crime family in New York City. He headed a group known as the &quot;DeMeo crew&quot;, which consisted of approximately twenty associates involved in murder, car theft, drug dealing, prostitution and pornography. The DeMeo crew became notorious for the large number of murders they committed and for the grisly way they disposed of the bodies, which became known as &quot;the Gemini Method&quot;. The crew is believed to be responsible for up to 200 murders, many of which were committed by DeMeo himself.

==Early life== 
DeMeo was born on September 7, 1940, in the Flatlands neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City into a working-class Italian immigrant family originating from Formia in the region of Lazio. The fourth of five children of Antonio Joseph &quot;Anthony&quot; DeMeo, a laundry company deliveryman, and Eleanor DeMeo (née Colarullo), a housewife, Roy graduated from James Madison High School in 1959, during which time he began earning money as a loanshark. Economist Walter Block and future presidential candidate Bernie Sanders were among DeMeo&#x27;s graduating year classmates. 

Between the ages of 15 and 22, DeMeo worked at a local grocery store, where he trained as an apprentice butcher. His older brother Anthony Frank &quot;Chubby&quot; DeMeo, a United States Marine Corps corporal, was killed in action during the Korean War on April 23, 1951, aged 20. DeMeo&#x27;s father died of a heart attack on December 12, 1960, and his mother subsequently returned to Italy with Roy&#x27;s youngest brother to live with relatives near Naples.

==Criminal career==
===Gambino family===
DeMeo was initially an associate of the Brooklyn faction of the Lucchese crime family, which controlled towing companies, junkyards and car theft operations in Flatlands and Canarsie. Anthony &quot;Nino&quot; Gaggi, a soldier in the Gambino crime family, noticed DeMeo in 1966 and told him that he could make even more money with his successful business if he shifted his allegiance to the Gambinos. Through the late 1960s, DeMeo&#x27;s organized crime prospects increased on two fronts: he continued in the loansharking business with Gaggi and began developing a crew of young men involved in car theft. It was this collective of criminals that became known both in the underworld and in law enforcement circles as the &quot;DeMeo crew&quot;.

The first member of the DeMeo crew was 16-year-old Harvey &quot;Chris&quot; Rosenberg, who met DeMeo in 1966 when he was dealing marijuana at a Canarsie gas station. DeMeo helped Rosenberg increase his business and profits by loaning him money so that he could deal in larger amounts. By 1972, Rosenberg had introduced his friends to DeMeo and they began working for him as well. The additional members of the crew came to include Joseph and Patrick Testa, Anthony Senter, Richard and Frederick DiNome, Henry Borelli, Joseph &quot;Dracula&quot; Guglielmo (DeMeo&#x27;s cousin), and later, Vito Arena and Carlo Profeta.

DeMeo joined a Brooklyn credit union in 1972, gaining a position on the board of directors shortly afterward. He utilized his position to launder money earned through his illegal ventures. He also introduced colleagues at the credit union to a lucrative side-business, laundering the money of drug dealers he had become acquainted with. DeMeo also built up his loansharking business with funds stolen from credit union reserves.

DeMeo&#x27;s collection of loanshark customers, while still primarily those in the car industry, soon included other businesses such as a dentist&#x27;s office, an abortion clinic, restaurants and flea markets. He was also listed as an employee for a Brooklyn company named S &amp; C Sportswear Corporation, and frequently told his neighbors he worked in construction, food retailing and the used car business. Bonanno family underboss Salvatore Vitale claimed to the FBI that in 1974 he was ordered to deliver the corpse of a man who had just been murdered to a garage in Queens so that it could be disposed of by DeMeo.

In late 1974, a conflict escalated between the DeMeo crew and Andrei Katz, a young auto repair shop owner who was partners with DeMeo in a stolen car ring. In January 1975, Katz visited the Brooklyn District Attorney&#x27;s Office and voluntarily provided them information that Rosenberg was heavily involved in car theft. DeMeo learned about the meeting immediately afterward from an NYPD auto crimes detective on his payroll. DeMeo ordered Borelli to contact a female acquaintance, Babette Judith Questel, about being used as bait. In May 1975, Katz appeared before a Brooklyn grand jury and divulged what he knew about the DeMeo crew&#x27;s illegal activities.

On June 13, 1975, Questel was used to successfully lure Katz to her apartment complex for what he thought was a date, where upon arrival he was immediately abducted by members of the DeMeo crew. He was then taken to the meat department of a supermarket in Rockaway Beach, Queens, where he was stabbed multiple times in the heart and then in the back with a butcher knife. After being decapitated, Katz&#x27;s head was then put through a machine normally used for compacting cardboard boxes, where it was crushed. The body parts were wrapped in plastic bags and deposited into the supermarket&#x27;s dumpster, where they were discovered days later when a pedestrian walking his dog spotted one of Katz&#x27;s legs lying on a curb near the store. The police reported to the press that a grisly, brutal killing had occurred, but that was the extent of the information given. The body was identified as Katz&#x27;s two days later through the use of dental records.

===Gemini Method===
As the 1970s progressed, DeMeo cultivated his followers into a crew experienced with the process of murdering and dismembering victims. With the exception of killings intended to send a message to any who would hinder their criminal activities, or murders that presented no other alternative, a set method of execution was established by the DeMeo crew to ensure that victims would be dispatched quickly and then made to disappear. The style of execution was dubbed the &quot;Gemini Method&quot;, after the Gemini Lounge, a bar which served as the primary hangout of the crew, as well as the site where most of their victims were killed.

The process of the Gemini Method, as revealed by multiple crew members and associates who became government witnesses in the early 1980s, was to lure the victim through the side door of the lounge and into the apartment in the back portion of the building. At this point, a crew member, almost always DeMeo according to crew member-turned-government witness Frederick DiNome, would approach with a silenced pistol in one hand and a towel in the other, shooting the victim in the head then wrapping the towel around the victim&#x27;s head wound like a turban to stanch the blood flow. Immediately after, another member of the crew, originally Rosenberg, would stab the victim in the heart to prevent more blood from pumping out of the gunshot wound. By then, the victim would be dead, at which point the body would be stripped of clothing and dragged into a bathroom, where the remaining blood drained out or congealed within the body. This was to eliminate the messiness of the next step, when crew members would place the body onto plastic sheets laid out in the main room and proceed to dismember it, cutting off the arms, legs and head.

Following dismemberment, the body parts would then be put into bags, placed in cardboard boxes and sent to the Fountain Avenue landfill in Brooklyn. So many tons of garbage were dropped each day at the dump that it would be nearly impossible for the bodies to be discovered. During the initial stages of an early 1980s investigation targeting the DeMeo crew, a plan by authorities to excavate sections of the dump to locate remains was aborted when it was deemed too costly and unlikely to locate any meaningful evidence. The landfill, opposite the Starrett City Apartment Complex on Pennsylvania Avenue in the East New York section of Brooklyn, was closed in 1985 and capped over since. All signs and odors that a landfill had existed are gone, replaced by parkland.

Some victims were killed in other ways for varying reasons. At times, suspected informants or those who committed an act of disrespect against a member of the crew or their superiors had their bodies left in the streets to serve as a message and warning. There were also occasions where it would not be possible to lure the intended victim into the Gemini Lounge, in which case other locations would have to be used. A cabin cruiser owned by Richard DiNome was used on at least one occasion to dispose of remains at sea.

===Further criminal career===
In the latter half of 1975, DeMeo became a silent partner in a peep show and prostitution establishment in Bricktown, New Jersey, after the owner of the business became unable to pay his loansharking debts. DeMeo also began dealing in bestiality and child pornography, which he sold to his New Jersey establishment as well as connections in Rhode Island. When Gaggi found out about DeMeo&#x27;s involvement in such taboo films, he demanded that DeMeo stop under the threat of death. However, DeMeo defied Gaggi and continued the practice. Gaggi did not retaliate, and, according to his nephew Dominick Montiglio, the subject was never mentioned again as long as DeMeo continued making payments to Gaggi.

DeMeo also dealt in narcotics despite the Gambino family strictly forbidding such activity; he financed a major operation importing Colombian marijuana, which was unloaded from an offshore freighter and sold at various auto shops in Canarsie, and also sold cocaine out of the Gemini Lounge.

As 1975 drew to a close, DeMeo was the subject of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) investigations into his income. Months earlier, DeMeo&#x27;s credit union had been pushed into insolvency as a result of the plundering of its finances by DeMeo and his crew; DeMeo quit the credit union as a result. Before an indictment could be handed down against him, DeMeo utilized false affidavits from businesses owned by friends and acquaintances claiming he was on their payrolls as an employee. These affidavits served to account for some of his income, allowing him to reach a settlement with the IRS.

DeMeo&#x27;s sources of income, as well as his crew, continued to grow. By July 1976 he added an automobile firm by the name of Team Auto Wholesalers to his loanshark customers. The owner of Team Auto, Matthew Rega, also purchased stolen vehicles from the DeMeo crew and sold them off at a New Jersey car lot that he owned. DeMeo also involved himself with hijacking delivery trucks from John F. Kennedy International Airport. His crew now included Edward &quot;Danny&quot; Grillo, a hijacker who had just been released from prison.

In the fall of 1976, the Gambino family went through a massive change when its boss, Carlo Gambino, died of natural causes. Paul Castellano was named as Gambino&#x27;s successor, with Aniello Dellacroce retaining the position of underboss. The implications of this were twofold for DeMeo. Gaggi was elevated to the position of &quot;caporegime&quot;, taking over the crew of men Castellano previously headed. This promotion was beneficial for DeMeo, whose mentor was now even closer to the family leadership. Another advantage was that with Gambino deceased, new associates would be eligible for membership into the family.

Castellano did not immediately &quot;open the books&quot; for new members, opting instead to promote existing members and reshuffle his capos to new crews. He also allegedly opposed the idea of DeMeo being &quot;made&quot;, looking down on street-level members and instead involving himself in white-collar crime. Additionally, Castellano felt DeMeo was uncontrollable. Gaggi&#x27;s attempts at persuading Castellano to make DeMeo were continually rejected. By 1977, DeMeo became distraught by this situation and searched for opportunities that would ensure larger returns for his superiors.

===The Westies alliance and Rosenberg===
DeMeo secured his induction into the Gambino family by forming an alliance with an Irish-American gang known as the Westies, based in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. The leader of a rival Irish gang, Mickey Spillane, was causing delays for the construction of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, much to the frustration of Castellano, who had an interest in the project. After the unsolved murder of Spillane in May 1977, Westies leader James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Coonan assumed control of the Irish mob rackets on the West Side of Manhattan. 

DeMeo, sensing an opportunity to create a vast source of income for the Gambino family, persuaded Gaggi to consider a partnership with the Westies. Shortly afterwards, Coonan and his second-in-command Mickey Featherstone were called to a meeting with Castellano, in which they agreed to become a &quot;de facto&quot; arm of the family and share ten percent of all profits. In exchange, the Westies would be privy to several lucrative union deals and take on murder contracts for the family.

It was his pivotal role in the Westie–Gambino alliance that reportedly convinced Castellano to give DeMeo his &quot;button&quot;, or formally induct him into the family. DeMeo was made in mid-1977 and put in charge of handling all family business with the Westies. He was ordered to get permission before committing any murders and to avoid drug dealing. His crew, however, continued to sell large amounts of cocaine, marijuana and a variety of narcotic pills. DeMeo also continued to commit unsanctioned killings, such as the 1977 double homicide of Johnathan Quinn, a car thief suspected of cooperating with law enforcement, and Cherie Golden, Quinn&#x27;s 19-year-old girlfriend. The DeMeo crew dumped the bodies in locations where they would be discovered to serve as a warning against cooperation with authorities.

In 1978, Frederick DiNome, previously DeMeo&#x27;s chauffeur, joined the crew. DeMeo and his crew murdered Grillo, who had fallen into heavy debt with DeMeo and was believed to be becoming susceptible to police coercion. Grillo, who was dismembered and disposed of like many of the crew&#x27;s victims, was the first known occurrence of internal crew discipline.

The next member to be killed was Rosenberg, who had set up a drug deal with a Cuban man living in Florida and then murdered him and his associates when they traveled to New York to complete the sale. The Cuban had connections with a Cuban drug cartel, raising the possibility of violence between the Gambino family and the Cubans unless Rosenberg was dealt with. DeMeo was ordered to kill Rosenberg but stalled for weeks. 

During this period, DeMeo committed his most public murder. The victim was a college student with no criminal ties named Dominick Ragucci, who was paying for his tuition as a door-to-door salesman. DeMeo saw Ragucci parked outside his house in Massapequa Park, Long Island, and assumed he was a Cuban assassin. DeMeo and crew members Joseph Guglielmo and Frederick DiNome pursued Ragucci in a seven-mile car chase on Route 110 through Amityville and Farmingdale, after which the student was shot to death by DeMeo. After returning home and gathering his family, DeMeo drove them out of Long Island and left them at a hotel in upstate New York for two weeks. According to DeMeo&#x27;s son Albert, he started crying when he discovered he had murdered an innocent teenager and did not eat for several days afterwards. The public execution also put a strain on DeMeo&#x27;s relationship with his wife Gladys, who had previously been able to ignore her husband&#x27;s criminal activities.

Gaggi was infuriated by the murder of Ragucci, and ordered DeMeo to kill Rosenberg before there were any other innocent victims. On May 11, 1979, Rosenberg reported to the Gemini Lounge for the crew&#x27;s usual Friday night meeting. Shortly after his arrival, DeMeo fired a single bullet into the unsuspecting Rosenberg&#x27;s head. The usually ice-cold DeMeo hesitated when the still-living Rosenberg managed to rise off the floor and onto one knee, but Senter then moved in and finished him off with four shots to the head. 

Unlike Grillo, Rosenberg&#x27;s body was not dismembered or made to disappear. The Cubans had demanded that his murder make the newspapers. DeMeo&#x27;s men placed Rosenberg&#x27;s body in his car and left it on the side of Cross Bay Boulevard, near the Gateway National Wildlife Refuge in Broad Channel, Queens, to be found. Albert later recounted that Rosenberg&#x27;s murder affected his father deeply, and that when DeMeo came home after the killing, he went into his study room and didn&#x27;t emerge for two days. After the murder, DeMeo spent six weeks hiding out with Guglielmo in a safe house near 42nd Street in Times Square, growing a full beard and disguising himself with a baseball cap and sunglasses when out in public.

===Empire Boulevard operation===
As 1979 continued, DeMeo began to expand his business activities, in particular his auto theft operation, which soon became the largest in history of New York City. Dubbed the Empire Boulevard Operation by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, it consisted of hundreds of stolen cars being shipped from the port of Newark to Kuwait and Puerto Rico. DeMeo put together a group of five active partners in the operation, all of whom earned approximately $30,000 a week each in profit. Aside from stolen automobiles, DeMeo was also shipping cigarettes and pornographic magazines to the Middle East.

Aside from the active partners, other associates and crew members performed the actual stealing of the automobiles off the streets of New York. Among these associates was Vito Arena, a long-time car thief and armed robber who began working for DeMeo in 1978 after murdering his old partner. Like DiNome, Arena became closely involved with the DeMeo crew by the end of the 1970s. In 1979, the Empire Boulevard Operation was nearly stopped by a legitimate car dealer who threatened to inform the police. He was murdered along with an uninvolved acquaintance before he could provide authorities with information.

===Eppolito murders===
In late 1979, DeMeo and Gaggi became involved in a conflict with James Eppolito and James Eppolito Jr., two made Gambino members in Gaggi&#x27;s crew. They were the paternal uncle and cousin, respectively, of a corrupt former New York City Police Department (NYPD) detective, Louis Eppolito, whose father, Ralph, brother of James Sr., was also a made member of the Gambino family.

The elder Eppolito met with Castellano and accused DeMeo and Gaggi of drug dealing, which carried the penalty of death. Castellano, to whom Gaggi was a close ally, sided against Eppolito and gave Gaggi permission to do what he pleased. He and DeMeo shot both Eppolitos to death in the younger Eppolito&#x27;s car en route to the Gemini Lounge on October 1, 1979. A witness driving by right as the shots were fired within the parked car alerted a nearby police officer, who arrested Gaggi after a shootout between the two that left Gaggi with a bullet wound in his neck. Since DeMeo had split up with Gaggi as they left the scene, he was not arrested or identified by the witness. 

Gaggi was charged with murder and the attempted murder of a police officer, but through jury tampering was convicted only of assault and given a five- to fifteen-year sentence in federal prison. DeMeo murdered the witness shortly after Gaggi&#x27;s sentencing in March 1980. The Empire Boulevard Operation had continued to expand into 1980 until the warehouse serving as its headquarters was raided by agents from the Newark branch of the FBI that summer. Henry Borelli and Frederick DiNome were arrested in May 1981 for their roles in the operation, but there was not enough evidence to arrest any of the other active partners. DeMeo ordered Borelli and DiNome to plead guilty to the charges in hopes that it would stop any further investigations into his activities.

===Downfall and murder===

By 1982, the FBI was investigating the enormous number of missing and murdered persons who were linked to DeMeo or who had last been seen entering the Gemini Lounge. Arena began cooperating with a state and federal task force investigating the DeMeo crew after he was arrested on June 4, 1982 for a string of robberies. Fearing that they would be arrested as a result of Arena&#x27;s testimony, DeMeo and members of his crew went into hiding during the summer and fall of 1982. DeMeo eventually emerged from hiding to consult with lawyers as he anticipated an indictment stemming from the Southern District of New York&#x27;s investigation into his crew&#x27;s activities.

Due to Arena&#x27;s knowledge of the chain of command in the Gambino family, Gaggi and Castellano became concerned upon learning that Arena had turned state&#x27;s evidence, and Castellano began conspiring to have DeMeo killed. Around this time, an FBI bug in the home of Gambino soldier Angelo Ruggiero picked up a conversation between him and Gene Gotti, a brother of John Gotti. In the conversation, it was discussed that Castellano had put out a hit on DeMeo, but was having difficulty finding someone willing to do the job. Gene Gotti mentioned that John was wary of taking the contract, as DeMeo had an &quot;army of killers&quot; around him. It is also mentioned that, at that time, John had killed fewer than ten people, while DeMeo had killed 37 that they had known about. According to mob informant Sammy Gravano, eventually the contract was given to Frank DeCicco, but DeCicco and his crew could not reach DeMeo either. DeCicco allegedly handed the job to DeMeo&#x27;s own men.

DeMeo&#x27;s son Albert wrote that in his final days, DeMeo was depressed and paranoid, aware that he would soon be killed. In the winter of 1982–1983, DeMeo rarely left his mansion and wore a leather jacket with a sawed-off shotgun concealed underneath whenever he did venture outside. DeMeo considered faking his own death by having his son shoot him and laying low. On January 10, 1983, DeMeo went to crew member Patty Testa&#x27;s house for a meeting with his men. That night, he failed to attend his daughter Dione&#x27;s birthday party, which caused his family to be suspicious. Albert later found DeMeo&#x27;s personal belongings such as his watch, wallet and ring in his study room, along with a Catholic pamphlet.

Ten days later, on January 20, 1983, DeMeo&#x27;s Cadillac Coupe DeVille was discovered in the parking lot of the Varuna Boat Club in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. The car was towed to a nearby police station, where it was searched by NYPD Organized Crime Control Bureau detectives. DeMeo&#x27;s partially frozen body was found in the trunk with a chandelier on top of it. He had been shot multiple times in the head and had a bullet wound in his hand, assumed by law enforcement to be a defensive wound caused when his killers opened fire on him.

The task force investigating the DeMeo crew theorized that DeMeo was set up in a similar manner to how he set up Rosenberg, and that Gaggi, Testa and Senter were present when he was killed. Albert DeMeo also believed that his father was killed by members of his own crew. In April 1984, Colombo family soldier Ralph Scopo was overheard on a wiretap explaining to an associate that DeMeo had been killed by his own family because they suspected that he would not be able to stand up to legal charges that resulted from his stolen car ring. According to Scopo, Castellano also &quot;had to put him away&quot; because DeMeo &quot;was crazy and had cast-iron balls&quot;.

Lucchese family underboss-turned-government witness Anthony &quot;Gaspipe&quot; Casso claimed that Castellano ordered John Gotti and Frank DeCicco to kill DeMeo, but they were unable to get close to him. DeCicco suggested Casso could do it, as he knew Senter and Joseph Testa well. Casso ordered them to kill DeMeo, assuring them that there would be no retribution and that afterwards they would join him in the Lucchese family. DeMeo visited the home of Patty Testa to collect some money he was owed. Joseph Testa and Senter were both there. As DeMeo sat down and waited for a coffee, they shot him dead.

Ironically, according to Casso, Castellano ordering DeMeo&#x27;s execution sealed his own fate, as Gotti and DeCicco were planning to kill him, and would do so on December 16, 1985. Casso said they would never have dared to move against Castellano while DeMeo was still alive.

== Aftermath ==
In 1984, a 78-count indictment was filed against 24 defendants, including Castellano, Gaggi and the surviving members of the DeMeo crew. The charges related to car theft, racketeering and drug trafficking. Castellano was indicted for ordering the DeMeo&#x27;s murder, as well as a host of other crimes, but was killed in December 1985 while out on bail in the middle of the first trial. John Gotti, who ordered the hit, became the new boss of the Gambino family. Gaggi became the lead defendant after Castellano&#x27;s death, but himself soon died later of natural causes. 

In March 1986, six members of the DeMeo crew were convicted, with Borelli and one other defendant found guilty of two counts of murder. They were found guilty of murdering two people who threatened to expose the car theft ring. In June 1989, nine additional members, including Anthony Senter and Joseph Testa, were convicted. At sentencing, Senter and Testa were given life sentences for murder with an additional twenty years for racketeering. Prosecutor William Mack Jr. stated that &quot;The Roy DeMeo Crew is the most violent crew ever prosecuted in federal court, as far as my knowledge&quot;, and that DeMeo &quot;engaged in wholesale slaughter&quot;.

The convictions were secured in large part by testimony of former members Frederick DiNome and Dominick Montiglio, as well as Vito Arena. Montiglio turned when he learned that Gaggi, his uncle, had put a contract on his life, and was placed in the witness protection program for twenty years for his testimony. Richard DiNome was murdered in 1984. Frederick DiNome died in what was ruled as a suicide in 1989. Arena left New York City that same year after serving six years of an eighteen-year sentence after his testimony. He was killed in a 1991 robbery in Texas. The Gemini Lounge later became a storefront church.

DeMeo is the subject of the 1992 book &quot;Murder Machine&quot; by Jerry Capeci and Gene Mustaine. DeMeo&#x27;s son Albert also wrote a book about his life growing up called &quot;For the Sins of My Father&quot;, published in 2002. DeMeo is portrayed by Michael A. Miranda in the 2001 film &quot;Boss of Bosses&quot;. Ray Liotta plays DeMeo in the 2012 film adaptation of Anthony Bruno&#x27;s book about Richard Kuklinski, &quot;The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer&quot;. Danny A. Abeckaser plays DeMeo in the 2023 film &quot;Inside Man&quot;.

== Personal life ==

DeMeo married Gladys Rosamond Brittain (1939–2002) in 1960. In 1966, he moved into a custom-built home in Massapequa, where he lived with his wife and three children. The couple had two daughters and a son.

DeMeo was raised Catholic but stopped practicing the religion in later life. His children were raised in his wife&#x27;s Lutheran faith. By all accounts, he was a devoted family man. Describing growing up, Albert DeMeo recalled, &quot;I grew up in a very normal household.&quot;

Albert became a stockbroker but suffered a nervous breakdown after the release of &quot;Murder Machine&quot; in 1992. He was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. One of DeMeo&#x27;s daughters became a clothing designer, and the other a medical doctor.

<doc id="1102950" wikidata="Q6607495" url="?curid=1102950" title="List of highest-certified music artists in the United States">
<text>This is the list of the highest-certified music artists in the United States based on certifications of albums and digital singles (but not physical singles) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). RIAA certifications are based on wholesale shipments rather than retail sales. Since 2016, the RIAA album certification has also included on-demand audio/video streams (1,500 streams = 1 album unit) and track sale equivalent (10 track sales = 1 album unit). Additionally, awards are presented only if and when a record company applies for certification. Therefore, the total certified units for a given artist may be incomplete or out of date.

The RIAA began its certifications in 1958, therefore, popular artists from earlier eras are generally not represented on this list. , the Beatles is the highest-certified music artist in the United States with a total of 183 million certified album-equivalent units. Garth Brooks is the highest-certified solo artist and Mariah Carey is the highest-certified female artist. Meanwhile, Drake remains the highest-certified digital singles artist, with 244 million certified units as a lead artist. Eminem is the only act in the top 20 of both lists.

==Top 100 certified music artists==




The following is a list of 100 highest-certified artists in the United States based on album-equivalent units, which include physical album shipments, digital album downloads, as well as individual song downloads and streams. However, sales of physical singles are not counted for album-equivalent units, which do not favor artists with a large catalog of physical singles such as Elvis Presley and Madonna. Artists with album certifications prior to 2016 also do not get benefit of the inclusion of individual song downloads and streams. The highest-certified music artists do not necessarily mean the highest-selling music artists, due to the fact that certifications are not automatic and record companies have to apply. The RIAA&#x27;s figures may also differ with Luminate and &quot;Billboard&quot; ones due to different weighting ratios of streaming. The RIAA counts 1,500 streams as one album unit (regardless of free or paid streams, audio or video streams), while &quot;Billboard&quot; counts 1,250 premium audio streams, 3,750 ad-supported streams, or 3,750 video streams as one album unit.

==Top 50 certified digital singles artists==



The following is a list of 50 highest-certified digital singles artists in the United States, based on song downloads and streams. As album sales suffered in the 21st century, the RIAA introduced Digital Single Award in 2004 to better recognize &quot;artists&#x27; commercial success in a transformative music marketplace&quot;. Streams were added as part of singles certification in 2013, with 150 audio/video streams being equal to one download. The RIAA does not count certified units of featured artists in their official ranking.
