<text>Crave (formerly The Movie Network or TMN) is a Canadian premium television network and streaming service owned by the Bell Media subsidiary of BCE Inc.

Launched in 1983 as the national service First Choice, early difficulties and a subsequent industry restructuring led to its operations being restricted to Eastern Canada from 1984 to 2016; it then held a regional legal monopoly on movie-based premium TV services in its territory until the launch of the present-day Super Channel in 2007. The service changed its name to The Movie Network in 1993. In 2016, when Movie Central (which previously held a similar monopoly in Western and Northern Canada) wound down its operations, TMN resumed national operations and subsumed the former service&#x27;s subscribers.

In 2018, TMN merged its operations with the over-the-top (OTT) streaming service CraveTV; both services would be rebranded as Crave. With these changes, the streaming service added a premium tier, &quot;Movies + HBO&quot;, which includes access to the premium content that was previously exclusive to the TMN and its Canadian HBO multiplex. Likewise, the television version of the service distributed by providers featured access to the on-demand library of the former CraveTV service as part of their subscription. As such, the service was often sold by providers under the name Crave + Movies + HBO, until programming from both tiers was collapsed into a single library in October 2021. Since then, the Crave service sold by TV service providers has been equivalent to the Crave Total (now Crave Premium) ad-free OTT plan.

For regulatory purposes, the Crave streaming service and specialty television service are considered to be separate operations.

== History ==
=== Development ===
In 1976, Communications Minister Jeanne Sauvé was quoted as saying &quot;(Canadian) pay television is inevitable&quot;. During the 1970s when premium television service HBO and the then up-and-coming Atlanta, Georgia superstation WTBS (now WPCH-TV) became available via satellite in North America, some Canadians who were living in underserved rural areas, wanted access to these services. The Saskatchewan government together with Cable Regina (later Access Communications) set up a provincial pay television network called Teletheatre in 1979.

Growth of grey market television receive-only dishes by 1980 led the Canadian government under the administration of Pierre Trudeau to allow for pay television in Canada, and that there would be hearings to license pay television networks in Canada. In September 1981, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) held a hearing in Hull, Quebec to license Canada&#x27;s first pay television networks. There were more than 24 applicants to start such services.

When First Choice Canadian Communications Corp. made its application to the CRTC in September 1981, the individuals and companies involved in the proposed channel included Donald Sobey (of the Sobeys supermarket chain), J. R. McCaig, Norman Keevil, television producer Riff Markowitz, Royfund Equity Ltd. (a mutual fund division of the Royal Bank of Canada), AGF Management Ltd. and Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. Together, they had $19 million in equity financing and proposed to spend $310.4 million over five years on Canadian television production. Estimated profit (over five years) would be $3.1 million. A pay television licence was issued by the CRTC to First Choice on March 18, 1982. The channel&#x27;s first president was Donald MacPherson.

At the time that First Choice applied to the CRTC, it estimated that to program major American movies, entertainment specials and Canadian movies and specials, pay for satellite time, and marketing of the channel, it could sell it to the cable companies at a wholesale rate of $7.50 each month. However, by the time the channel launched, and providers received their revenue from the pay television services, the retail cost of First Choice jumped significantly to $15.95 ().

=== Launch and evolution ===
When First Choice was launched on February 1, 1983, it operated as a national premium service; the network&#x27;s original slogan was &quot;Look Out for Number One! Look Out for First Choice!&quot; The network inaugurated programming with a two-hour promotional reel announcing the programming that First Choice would carry, followed by a replay of The Who&#x27;s farewell tour concert special; the airing of The Who concert which had been aired live on other channels in Canada the year before, as well as the two-hour promotional ad had several critics wondering about the channel&#x27;s claims that it would be commercial-free and not play reruns. These programs were followed by the first movie ever to be broadcast on First Choice, &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;.

At 10 a.m. Eastern/7 a.m. Pacific Time that day, First Choice aired &quot;Star Wars&quot; and continued to replay the film every other day for eight hours. The channel offered its programming for free for 14 days starting with the channel&#x27;s first day of operation, before it was scrambled, except to those subscribers who wanted to pay the extra fee to continue receiving the channel. Before the advent of stereo television and home theatre systems, subscribers who paid for cable FM service could receive a stereo feed of First Choice. During its first year, First Choice aired a two-hour block of programming from the American adult-oriented pay service The Playboy Channel (now Playboy TV) as part of a late night programming block on Fridays. 
After a disappointing run for pay services in general, the industry was restructured in late 1983 and into 1984, and First Choice&#x27;s service area was restricted to Canadian provinces east of the Ontario-Manitoba border, with competitor Superchannel (later Movie Central) taking territorial rights to the west of that border. As part of this restructuring, film production company Astral Bellevue Pathé (later known as Astral Communications, then Astral Media) took a controlling interest in First Choice, and its principal owner Harold Greenberg became the channel&#x27;s new president; Astral became sole owner by 1993.

The two regional services used the First Choice-Superchannel name from 1984 to 1988, before they were split again in September 1988. Beginning in 1984 (but particularly after the split from Superchannel), First Choice also made use of the slogan &quot;The Movie Network&quot;; this became the name of the channel itself in 1993.

First Choice was originally granted a bilingual licence; it also operated a 24-hour French-language channel under the same licence, which was called Premier Choix. In early 1984, that service was merged with another Quebec-based pay-television network, TVEC, to form Super Écran, which continues to exist today. On October 1, 1994, The Movie Network launched a companion film service, TMN Moviepix (the channel would undergo two renamings – first to Moviepix in 1996 and then Mpix in 2001 – before eventually becoming The Movie Network Encore on September 18, 2012).

On July 5, 2013, Astral Media was acquired by Bell Media.

=== End of duopoly, further developments ===

For many years, the &quot;de facto&quot; twin regional monopolies of The Movie Network and Movie Central have been criticised. At the time, no other similar premium services had broadcast within Canada. Critics argued that this limited competition and consumer choice, while proponents said that there was very little in content or functionality that was not already offered by the existing services. In July 2005, the CRTC, the Canadian federal broadcast regulator, announced that public hearings would begin on October 24 of that year on four applications for new national pay television licences from different groups. Each applicant claimed that they would commit to invest and develop more Canadian-produced programming content. On May 18, 2006, the CRTC announced that had accepted an application by Allarco Entertainment, while the other three were rejected. This approved application effectively ended The Movie Network/Movie Central duopoly in Canada. On November 2, 2007, the new service was launched as Super Channel.

On November 19, 2015, Movie Central owner Corus Entertainment announced that as a result of a strategic review, it had decided to exit the pay TV business to concentrate on its national specialty channels, and would discontinue Movie Central along with Encore Avenue. To that end, Corus reached an agreement with Bell through which TMN became a national service once again on March 1, 2016, with Movie Central customers automatically transitioning to TMN. TMN Encore also expanded nationally for the first time, and Bell took over full operation of HBO Canada (previously a jointly-operated multiplex channel of both TMN and Movie Central). Although Bell did not buy the Movie Central licence, it paid Corus C$211 million in exchange for Corus&#x27; assistance in allowing TMN&#x27;s national expansion. The CRTC had quietly given administrative approval (i.e., approved without a request for public comment) to applications to allow TMN and TMN Encore to operate nationally in July 2015, so no further regulatory approval was required. This meant that Bell was not required to fund a public benefits package worth 10% of the transaction value, as would typically be required by the CRTC in the event of a licence transfer.

On January 23, 2018, Bell Media announced that it had reached new licensing deals with Lionsgate and subsidiary company Starz Inc., under which the former held Canadian pay television window rights to the latter&#x27;s releases and TMN Encore was rebranded as a Canadian Starz channel in 2019.

=== Merger with CraveTV, relaunch as a hybrid VOD service ===
In October 2018, a Rogers Cable service bulletin stated that beginning in November, The Movie Network subscribers would begin to receive Bell&#x27;s over-the-top subscription service CraveTV as part of their service.

On November 1, 2018, Bell announced that CraveTV had merged with The Movie Network, with both services renamed Crave (and promotions marketing the relaunch as &quot;The All-New Crave&quot;). Under the service&#x27;s new structure, subscribers to the existing CraveTV OTT service may upgrade their subscription to a $19.98 &quot;Crave + Movies + HBO&quot; tier, that adds the content formerly associated with TMN (including films and current HBO series). This marks the first time that the service formerly known as The Movie Network has been offered on a standalone basis without a television subscription. Existing TMN television subscribers are also able to access the content library of the base Crave service as part of their subscription, which includes various television series as well as new and existing Showtime programming. The original OTT-only service without films or current HBO programming remained available at its existing $9.99 price. Bell Media head Randy Lennox cited increasing competition with Netflix as a basis for the decision. 

In 2021, Crave realigned its plans to be based on device support and concurrent streams rather than libraries, with the $9.99 service becoming &quot;Crave Basic&quot; and only offering one stream on a mobile device (but with access to the Movies + HBO content library), and the &quot;Crave Total&quot; tier offering up to four streams, and support for PCs and television apps.

== Channels ==
=== List of channels ===
Depending on the service provider, Crave provides up to six 24-hour multiplex channels (all simulcast in both standard definition and high definition) as well as a subscription video-on-demand service.

Crave broadcasts its primary channels (Crave 1, Crave 2, Crave 3, and HBO 1) on an Eastern Time Zone schedule for all viewers east of the Ontario–Manitoba border, and for all viewers regardless of region accessing the linear streams via Crave&#x27;s streaming platform. Traditional TV service customers west of that border receive programming on a Mountain Time Zone schedule, being a holdover from Movie Central&#x27;s scheduling practices due to its origins as an Alberta-based service also serving the Central and Pacific time zones. After replacing Movie Central in Western and Northern Canada, TMN reverted to a numbering system for its channels similar to most other premium services, after several years of using theme-based branding for its channels. These numbers are currently used within program guides and promotional material; the numbers are not used in on-air branding.

Bell&#x27;s other English-language pay TV service Starz operates under a separate licence, and subscribers to one of the two services do not necessarily have to subscribe to the other. However, some service providers require customers that subscribe to the Crave linear service to also subscribe to Starz.

=== HBO multiplex channel ===

On September 22, 2008, both TMN and Movie Central announced that the two services would jointly begin offering a dedicated HBO multiplex channel (available in both standard definition and high definition), initially called &quot;HBO Canada&quot;, on October 30. For TMN subscribers, HBO Canada replaced MMore and MMore HD. For Movie Central subscribers, HBO Canada replaced Movie Central 4. TMN ultimately assumed sole responsibility for the channel after replacing Movie Central in its service area. The channel, which was rebranded to simply &quot;HBO&quot; in June 2019, is available at no additional charge to TMN/Crave linear subscribers and, moreover, is not available on a standalone basis .
The Canadian HBO channel focuses on programming from the U.S. premium service HBO and its sister network Cinemax, including several original series from the two channels, specials, and sporting events not previously available in Canada. A selection of Canadian films and series also airs to satisfy Canadian content requirements. HBO programming has since aired solely on this channel, as opposed to any of the other TMN multiplex channels. Since December 2022, the channel now airs more American and international films, starting with &quot;Sing 2&quot;.

Under the previous TMN / Movie Central system, HBO Canada was unique in that its schedule was common to both services, with the exception of timeshifting for the Eastern (TMN) and Mountain (MC) time zones. Although essentially operating as a joint venture of Bell and Movie Central&#x27;s parent company Corus Entertainment, the east and west feeds were technically separate channels wholly owned by the parent company of the applicable regional service. In any event, HBO&#x27;s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery is not (and continues to not be) a shareholder, and only licenses the name, logo and programming to Bell.

=== Other services ===
==== High definition ====
TMN launched its 1080i high definition feed in May 2005. HBO Canada began broadcasting in high definition on October 30, 2008, becoming the first TMN multiplex channel to launch its own HD simulcast feeds; followed by MFun and MExcess in 2010. The remaining TMN multiplex channel, MFest, launched its HD simulcast feed on September 18, 2012.

==== Video on-demand ====
On most service providers, subscribers are also able to access the Crave pay TV service&#x27;s programming on a video on demand service/folder now generally labelled &quot;Crave + Movies + HBO&quot;, which includes feature films, television series from Crave and outside distributors, and specials. From 2008 to 2018, HBO programming was carried in a separate HBO Canada on-demand folder; this was removed with the changeover to Crave.

If the base-level Crave VOD service is also available through set-top boxes on that provider, subscribers to the pay service are also able to access this content, usually in a separate &quot;Crave&quot; folder.

==== TV Everywhere ====
On February 27, 2013, The Movie Network launched The Movie Network Go (TMN Go), a TV Everywhere website and mobile app which features streaming content from the TMN service. With the rebranding as Crave, TMN Go was replaced by the Crave website and apps on mobile and digital media players, which offers similar functionality.

==== &quot;Movie Entertainment&quot; ====
&quot;Movie Entertainment&quot; (or &quot;ME&quot;), previously titled &quot;Feature&quot;, served as Crave&#x27;s monthly in-house magazine for linear TV subscribers from June 1990 to April 2021, and was published by Astral (later Bell) subsidiary Feature Publishing. Prior to 1990, subscribers received &quot;PrimeTime&quot; magazine, a similar publication originated by Superchannel (later Movie Central).

The magazine contained monthly listings for the Crave, HBO, and Starz linear channels, as well as various other features related to that month&#x27;s Crave programming and the entertainment industry in general. A subscription to &quot;Movie Entertainment&quot; was included by default when subscribing to the Crave linear service through some TV service providers, though by the early 2000s, subscribers were able to opt out, in some cases resulting in a monthly savings of C$2, by contacting their provider. Conversely, other service providers (including Shaw Direct) began to require subscribers to opt-in (for the same $2 charge) if they wished to receive the magazine. &quot;ME&quot; was also available for direct subscription by contacting Crave.

The magazine ceased publication after the April 2021 issue. An editor&#x27;s note in the penultimate issue cited changes in home media consumption meaning the magazine was no longer necessary. The closure also came shortly after the announcement of other cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, throughout Bell Media.

Crave previously aired a segment of movie reviews called &quot;Movie Entertainment&quot;, which also aired on former sister channels Family Channel and Disney XD. This segment was discontinued in 2014, upon Steve Gow&#x27;s departure from The Movie Network.

== Programming ==

Programming on Crave&#x27;s linear service includes theatrically released motion pictures, original and foreign television series, made-for-cable movies, documentaries, and stand-up comedy and concert specials. Before other Canadian specialty networks like TSN and Much were licensed, First Choice prominently offered commercial-free professional sporting and concert events. Sports events featured on the channel came from such distributors as ESPN, USA Network and HBO.

=== Relationship with HBO and Showtime ===
Along with French-language sister service Super Écran, Crave owns exclusive Canadian rights to most original programming from American premium services HBO (featured on a dedicated HBO multiplex channel within the Crave service), sibling service Cinemax, and rival service Showtime.

Prior to its merger with CraveTV, The Movie Network held exclusive rights to new seasons of HBO programming, which are now included in Crave&#x27;s premium tier, while CraveTV held streaming rights to past seasons of several Showtime series. First-run Showtime programming and library HBO programming (as well as past seasons of select current HBO series, such as &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;), were available on both services.

In-spite of this, the rights certain programs commissioned from outside production companies, which have retained international distribution rights, have previously been sold to other Canadian channels. For example, the Showtime series &quot;Homeland&quot; was not initially covered under Crave&#x27;s output deal; producing studio Fox 21 Television Studios (now 20th Television) had sold the Canadian first-run rights to Super Channel when the series premiered. Crave would later acquire non-exclusive rights to re-air and stream past seasons of &quot;Homeland&quot; through a separate deal with Fox/Disney and the channel ultimately acquired the premiere rights for the 8th and final season of the series airing in 2020.

Conversely, while Crave held first-run rights to the Warner Bros.-produced Showtime series &quot;Shameless&quot;, its rights are more limited than for series produced by Showtime directly – only the most recent season is available, and unlike other Showtime series it is not available in Crave&#x27;s base streaming/VOD tier. Previous season rights to the show are held in Canada by FXX and Netflix.

=== Movie library ===
As of 2021, Crave has first-run film licensing agreements with the Canadian film distributor Entertainment One (whose library includes the Canadian distribution rights to titles from The Weinstein Company and Lionsgate). Other American film studios providing content to the service include Universal Pictures (including Universal Animation Studios, Working Title Films, Illumination Entertainment, Focus Features, DreamWorks Animation and Legendary Pictures), and Warner Bros. (including Warner Bros. Animation, New Line Cinema—whose 1989–2010 film library is distributed in Canada by Entertainment One—Alcon Entertainment and Castle Rock Entertainment).

Crave also had a deal with Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures giving it rights to all Disney titles (including those under the Disney, Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Disneynature, Marvel Studios/Entertainment, Disneytoon Studios and Touchstone Pictures brands, but not Lucasfilm since Disney&#x27;s first movie from them, &quot;Strange Magic&quot;, was released in 2015 after TMN lost the rights to broadcast Disney movies) released theatrically through December 31, 2014, some of which continued to air on TMN into 2016. The equivalent rights for Disney movies released theatrically starting in 2015 were instead held by Netflix Canada from 2015 to 2018, and are now held by Disney+ in Canada since 2019. They were entirely replaced by 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios) films; 20th Century Fox would eventually come under Disney&#x27;s ownership, but Fox movies are still coming to Crave even after they were purchased by Disney and were renamed to its current moniker, though this content agreement may expire in the future. Two of Touchstone&#x27;s titles, &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet&quot;, are distributed in Canada by Entertainment One. The distribution rights to three of Marvel Studios&#x27; films, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (the later two, of which, Columbia Pictures co-produced) are owned by Universal and Sony respectively. Since 2021, Crave also shares 20th Century Studios films with Disney+, starting with Nomadland.

After briefly losing rights to Amazon Prime Video in 2020, in December 2022, Sony Pictures signed a new agreement with Crave beginning in April 2023—which includes first window rights to theatrical releases, and rights to back catalogue titles.

=== Original programming ===
Original programming produced under the Movie Network branding included:
* &quot;Bloodletting and Miraculous Cures&quot;
* &quot;The Business&quot;
* &quot;Durham County&quot;
* &quot;G-Spot&quot;
* &quot;Less Than Kind&quot;
* &quot;The Line&quot;
* &quot;Living in Your Car&quot;
* &quot;Reelside&quot;
* &quot;ReGenesis&quot;
* &quot;Sensitive Skin&quot;
* &quot;Terminal City&quot;

After rebranding as Crave in 2018, the service initially scaled back on the development of ongoing television series; apart from the reality show &quot;Canada&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; and the comedy series &quot;Letterkenny&quot; and &quot;New Eden&quot;, most titles branded as &quot;Crave Originals&quot; in the next few years were documentary films or stand-up comedy specials recorded at the Just for Laughs festival. 

The service began to shift back toward series development again in 2021, with original series including &quot;1 Queen 5 Queers&quot;, &quot;Bria Mack Gets a Life&quot;, &quot;Little Bird&quot;, &quot;Pillow Talk&quot;, &quot;Shoresy&quot;, &quot;Thunder Bay&quot;, &quot;Late Bloomer&quot;, &quot;Cocaine, Prison &amp; Likes: Isabelle&#x27;s True Story&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re All Gonna Die (Even Jay Baruchel)&quot;.

<text>The E7 was a , A1A-A1A passenger train locomotive built by General Motors&#x27; Electro-Motive Division of La Grange, Illinois. 428 cab versions, or E7As, were built from February 1945 to April 1949; 82 booster E7Bs were built from March 1945 to July 1948. (Circa 1953 one more E7A was built by the Los Angeles General Shops of the Southern Pacific by rebuilding an E2A.) The 2,000 hp came from two 12 cylinder model 567A engines. Each engine drove its own electrical generator to power the two traction motors on one truck. The E7 was the eighth model in a line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units, and it became the best selling E model upon its introduction.

In profile the front of the nose of an E7A was less slanted than on earlier EMD passenger locomotives, and the E7, E8, and E9 units have been nicknamed “bulldog nose” units. Some earlier units were called “shovel nose” units or “slant nose” units.

==In film==
A Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad E7A, #103-A, appears at the start and end of the 1967 film &quot;In The Heat of the Night&quot;.

A Southern Pacific E7A, #6001, is on the point of a train that figures prominently in &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&quot;, a popular 1960 episode of the anthology television series, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, starring Inger Stevens. (According to the narration, Steven&#x27;s character is said to encounter the train somewhere between Pennsylvania and Tennessee, yet the locomotive&#x27;s number board shows that the train, #99, is the &quot;Coast Daylight&quot;, which travelled between Los Angeles and San Francisco.)

In the 2010 miniseries &quot;The Pacific&quot;, filmed in Melbourne, S313, an example of the similar A16C export model, was painted to resemble Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad E7A 758 for filming, however it retained the livery for a short while after filming wrapped.

==Surviving example==
Ex-Pennsylvania Railroad E7A #5901 is preserved as the only surviving example of the E7. This locomotive has been cosmetically restored, and is currently on indoor display at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania, in Strasburg, Pennsylvania.

<text>Wilfrid James Mannion (16 May 1918 – 14 April 2000) was an English professional footballer who played as an inside forward, making over 350 senior appearances for Middlesbrough. He also played international football for England. With his blonde hair, he was nicknamed &quot;The Golden Boy&quot;.

==Early life==
Mannion was born on 16 May 1918 in South Bank, the son of Irish immigrants Tommy and Mary Mannion, and one of ten children.

==Club career==

===Middlesbrough===
Mannion joined his local team Middlesbrough F.C. in 1936 and went on to make 341 Football League appearances for them, scoring 99 goals in the First and Second Divisions, over the next 18 years. However, his career was disrupted by World War II. He scored 110 goals in all competitions for Middlesbrough.

Mannion fought in France and Italy during World War II, and in Italy his commanding officer was the England cricketer Hedley Verity.

At the end of the 1947–48 season he wanted a transfer, but Middlesbrough refused. In protest he did not play for them for much of the following season but he eventually backed down and started playing for Middlesbrough again.

===Later career===
After initially retiring as a player in 1954, Mannion subsequently joined Hull City. However, the Football League suspended him for articles he had written, He then played non-league football with Poole Town and Cambridge United.

==International career==
Mannion was capped on 26 occasions by the England national team between 1946 and 1951, and his final appearance came on 3 October 1951. He was a member of the England squad for the 1950 FIFA World Cup. Along with Middlesbrough and England teammate George Hardwick, he was also part of the Great Britain football team that beat the Rest of Europe 6–1 in 1947.

He remains the only Middlesbrough player to score for England at the World Cup.

==After football==
Mannion was eventually awarded a testimonial match by Middlesbrough in 1983, alongside former Boro and England colleague George Hardwick.

Mannion died on 14 April 2000 at the age of 81. After his death, Middlesbrough FC erected a statue of Mannion outside the Riverside Stadium.

In 2004, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame at the National Football Museum.

<text>The Vauxhall Carlton is a series of large family car/executive car sold in two distinct generations by the Vauxhall division of GM Europe between 1978 and 1994. The Carlton was based on the Opel Rekord E (Mk.1) and Omega A (Mk.2).

With the exception of the pre-facelift Mk.1 cars, most Carltons were manufactured by Opel in Rüsselsheim, and differed only from their Opel Rekord/Omega sisters in badging and trim.

It was replaced by the Omega B in 1994, mirroring the standardisation of model names across both GM Europe brands.

==Mark I (1978–1986)==

&quot;Main Article: Opel Rekord E&quot;

The first Vauxhall Carlton was introduced in September 1978 as a replacement for the ageing VX1800/VX2300 saloons, built in Luton from components made at the Opel plant at Rüsselsheim. Whilst its predecessor was loosely based on the Opel Rekord D, the relationship between the Carlton and the corresponding Opel Rekord E was much more obvious - being essentially the same car, retaining Opel-sourced powertrains, but with Vauxhall&#x27;s typical &quot;droop snoot&quot; front end (which had debuted three years earlier with the Chevette and Cavalier) that featured no traditional grille, and a slightly different rear end with the number plate moved down to the rear bumper. The other difference was the dashboard, which featured the hooded instrument binnacle going across the whole width of the car with wooden embellishment, compared to the plainer dash of the Rekord. It was a traditional large saloon or estate with rear-wheel drive and a spacious, comfortable interior and was available in &quot;L&quot; trim only. Power came from a 2.0–litre carburettor Opel CIH engine which gave reasonable performance, refinement and economy. There were some impressive options available, including central door locking, alloy wheels and electric windows, which gave it an advantage over most of its similarly-priced competitors.

It was designed to compete directly with the Ford Granada, which was consistently the most popular car of that size in Britain during the 1970s. It also competed with British Leyland&#x27;s Princess and Rover SD1 model ranges, as well as foreign competitors including the Citroën CX and Renault 20/30. It was launched shortly before the Peugeot 505.

===Relationship with other models===
Lengthened, more powerful models, based on the Carlton and Rekord, were also available. Positioned directly above them was the Vauxhall Viceroy which was a Carlton with the larger 2.5 L or 3.0 L six-cylinder Opel cam-in-head engine (CIH) (the corresponding Opel was the Opel Commodore), and differed also in that it featured a chrome grille with the &quot;white cross&quot; motif (from the VX4/90) in place of the Carlton&#x27;s painted droop snoot nose. The Viceroy/Commodore however sold poorly and were discontinued after the &quot;E2&quot; facelift in 1982, and a six-cylinder engine would not appear in the Carlton again until the MK2 GSi 3000 model. As with the Opel Rekord E, being a member of the V-body family; the Carlton also has commonality with the Holden Commodore produced for the Australian and New Zealand markets.

The Vauxhall Royale and Vauxhall Royale Coupé were in essence, long wheelbase versions of the Carlton/Viceroy with altered &quot;six light&quot; styling that were positioned at the top end of the range only featuring six-cylinder engines. These were essentially badge engineered versions of the Opel Senator and Monza, respectively, although a confusing situation resulted in the United Kingdom as a result of General Motors&#x27; decision to merge the Vauxhall and Opel dealer networks and marketing - the Royale was dropped at the 1982 facelift and was relaunched in the UK as the Opel Senator and Monza for the 1983 model year, but the former changed back to Vauxhall badging for the 1985 model year. The Monza continued as an Opel until it was deleted in 1987.

The Carlton was also sold in left hand drive in continental European markets, including the Netherlands, Belgium, the Scandinavian countries, Italy, and Portugal, alongside its Rekord counterpart.

===Facelift===
The introduction of the facelifted &quot;E2&quot; Opel Rekord in 1982, marked the convergence of both the Rekord and Carlton (and in fact the final convergence of the Opel and Vauxhall ranges as a whole), with both cars now differing only in badging, whilst UK production ceased and all Carltons were built alongside their Rekord sisters in Rüsselsheim. The update saw the disappearance of the droop snoot front, in favour of a more traditional (though still angled) grille shared with the Rekord. The rear was reprofiled with a higher boot lid and new rear lamps. Both cars also shared the new dashboard moulding and redesigned interior. This also marked the end of UK sale of the Opel Rekord, as the Opel brand was being phased out in the UK, as well as the sale of the Carlton outside the UK, as the Vauxhall brand was withdrawn from the rest of Europe. 

The 1983 facelift also saw the introduction of a wider engine range with the Family II engine from the Ascona/Cavalier in a 1.8 L carburettor form, whilst the older CIH unit continued in the 2.0 L carburettor and 2.0 L fuel injection form. In 1984, a range topping 2.2 L CIH fuel injected petrol became available in the CD trim. A 2.3 L diesel version was also available . A wider range of trim levels consisting of &quot;L&quot;, &quot;GL&quot; and &quot;CD&quot; were also introduced at this time. A 2.0 L fuel injection engine was introduced for the 1984 model year and was replaced by a 2.2 L fuel injection engine for 1985.

==Mark II (1986–1994)==
:&quot;Main Article: Opel Omega A&quot;

Opel chose to name its 1986 replacement car in this segment Omega rather than Rekord. Vauxhall stayed with the Carlton name. On its launch in November 1986 the Vauxhall Carlton / Opel Omega saloon and estate range earned itself the accolade of European Car of the Year - the second Vauxhall/Opel product to achieve this distinction, two years after the Astra/Kadett won the accolade.

===Relationship with other models===
The Carlton (Omega B) shared its platform again with the Senator this time known in both Opel and Vauxhall forms by the same name: Senator. Interior dashboard and trim also differed The Senator body-shell was different between the B and C/D pillars, and used different rear doors and a larger rear quarter-light, resulting in a higher roof-line at the rear, in order to give rear seat passengers slightly better headroom. This had a corresponding effect on the aerodynamics, with the Carlton achieving a against the Senator&#x27;s . 

The same GM V platform was also used in Holden variants and other GM products. 

Vauxhall scrapped the Carlton nameplate in early 1994, but the name of its Opel equivalent, the Omega, lived on, as it was applied to the Carlton&#x27;s replacement. Opel Omega B1 Although the models had always shared the same platform, and the replacement was again based on the GM V Platform, GM had the Vauxhall equivalent adopt the Opel name (a drive towards homogenization of European market model names was taking place throughout the range) and so the Carlton&#x27;s replacement was sold as the Vauxhall Omega. There was no equivalent up-market Senator variant in the new range.

===Mark II engine line-up===
All of the 4-cylinder engines available in the Carlton Mk II were the GM Family II engines in 1.8L and 2.0L capacities. The Opel Omega A was offered with a large 2.4L Opel CIH engine in certain European markets, but this variant was never offered in the Carlton. New to the Carlton&#x27;s line-up with the Mark II were two straight-6 engines with 2.6 and 3.0–litres. These were both 12-valve engines, again from the Opel CIH family, but later 3.0-litre models were offered with 24-valves, producing much more power and torque. As well, Vauxhall used the &quot;Dual-Ram&quot; intake manifold, which lets the car breathe as two separate three-cylinder engines below 4,000 rpm, but changes the intake manifold profile at 4000 rpm to increase the runner length, thus increasing total engine output.

In addition to the straight-6 engines there was a range of straight-4s. Starting with the 1.8-litre family 2 engine, and including the 2.0L C20NE, with 115PS and 125lb.ft torque. There was also a 2.3 turbo diesel available with 100PS and 160lb.ft torque.

===Special Lotus version===
In 1990, Vauxhall launched a high performance Lotus Carlton in collaboration with Lotus Cars. (An Opel version was also produced as the Lotus Omega.) It was built with a 3615 cc six-cylinder twin-turbo engine (designated C36GET) capable of over , making it officially (for the time) the fastest full four-seater that had ever been made. It cost £48,000 – well over double the price of a standard Carlton. As a result, Vauxhall&#x27;s original plans to sell about 1,000 in the UK ended in 440 UK cars being sold. For those with less money there was the 3000GSi 24v, with a top speed of .

===GSi 3000 &amp; Diamond===

Prior to the Lotus tuned version, the range topper was the GSi 3000 upon which the Lotus Carlton was based. At launch in 1986 it had giving it a top speed of . In 1990, power was increased by going from two valves per cylinder to four, creating a 24-valve engine, resulting in which allowed 0-62 mph to be dispatched in 7.6 seconds and increased the top speed to . It was also available with an Automatic gearbox, which reduced the top speed to and increased the 0–62 mph time to 8.6 seconds. There was also a Carlton Diamond 3.0 24v Estate available. Identical to the GSI but with an estate body shell and without some of the sporting accoutrements, it sold in much more limited numbers (90) and so is a much rarer sight.

===Guinness World Record===
In June 1992 two teams from Horley Round Table, Surrey, UK, set a Guinness World Record time of 77 hours 34 minutes, driving a total 6,700 km across the then 12 EC countries in two Vauxhall Carlton 24V 3000 GSi&#x27;s (J870 FFM and J751 DYC). The Carltons were provided by Vauxhall Motors and the record attempt was also supported by Mobil Oil and the Royal Automobile Club.

==Survival rate==
As of September 2023, 206 examples of the Carlton were still on Britain&#x27;s roads, with most remaining examples believed to be the high performance 3000 GSi and Lotus versions of the MK2 model.

<doc id="1099497" wikidata="Q3234341" url="?curid=1099497" title="Our Band Could Be Your Life">
<text>Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991 is a book by Michael Azerrad. It chronicles the careers of several underground rock bands who, while finding little or no mainstream success, were hugely influential in establishing American alternative and indie rock, mostly through nearly constant touring and records released on small, regional independent record labels. Azerrad conducted many interviews with band members, and also conducted extensive research of old fanzines, as well as more mainstream newspapers and books.

==Content==
The inspiration for the book occurred when Azerrad was watching a miniseries about rock music history. According to Azerrad, after exploring the punk era &quot;it skipped and went straight from Talking Heads to Nirvana. &quot;I thought, This is insane. Did I black out for 10 minutes? I thought that someone should do something about this. And I had, appropriately enough, a DIY moment and I thought, Maybe I should do it.&quot;

The title comes from the opening line of &quot;History Lesson – Part II&quot;, an autobiographical song written by Mike Watt of Minutemen, one of the bands featured in the book. The song, which is on the album &quot;Double Nickels on the Dime&quot;, details the band&#x27;s working class origins and populist sentiments: &quot;Punk rock changed our lives.&quot; The book is dedicated to the lives of D. Boon (Minutemen) and Bob Stinson (The Replacements).

The book focuses on 13 bands:

*Black Flag (from Hermosa Beach/Los Angeles, California)
*Minutemen (from San Pedro/Los Angeles, California)
*Mission of Burma (from Boston, Massachusetts)
*Minor Threat (from Washington, D.C.)
*Hüsker Dü (from Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota)
*The Replacements (from Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota)
*Sonic Youth (from New York City, New York)
*Butthole Surfers (from San Antonio, Texas)
*Big Black (from Evanston/Chicago, Illinois)
*Dinosaur Jr. (from Amherst, Massachusetts)
*Fugazi (from Washington, D.C.)
*Mudhoney (from Seattle, Washington)
*Beat Happening (from Olympia, Washington)

In honor of this book&#x27;s tenth anniversary, Azerrad put together a special concert at Bowery Ballroom with contemporary bands and artists to perform the music of bands covered in the text. For example, Ted Leo played Minor Threat and Titus Andronicus played The Replacements.

==Reviews==
In 2006, &quot;The Observer&quot; rated &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot; as one of the 50 best music books ever written. In 2009, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine named the book one of the 12 best music books of the decade. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; listed it as one of &quot;46 Essential Rock Reads.&quot; In a review of the book in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, critic Robert Christgau wrote, &quot;...Let me give Michael Azerrad&#x27;s &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot; its well-earned thumbs-up. Here&#x27;s my rave: While reading this 500-page history of &#x27;80s indie-rock, I only resorted to something lighter to avoid putting my back out. All 13 profiles are page-turners.&quot;

In the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;, critic Eric Weisbard wrote, &quot;In the decade Azerrad covers, indie America proved that world-class rock could be created outside corporate structures...&quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot; passionately resurrects thirteen indie groups...Azerrad is adept at drawing out musicians&#x27; war stories—and this bare-bones movement was full of them.&quot; &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s Benjamin Nugent said it was &quot;A timely reminder that Cobain and company were merely a key regiment in the motley alt-rock army...&quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot; narrates, down to the homemade posters and tour van repairs, how these bands gradually built up an audience large enough to make record labels and critics take notice.&quot;

The book review website &quot;Baby Got Books&quot; said &quot;If you graduated high school (or were at least supposed to graduate) any time between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s and have any interest whatsoever in music, you absolutely must read this book. While it tells the story of bands that truly lived the indie/punk lifestyle, it also sheds a brand new light (not always favorable) on the people in those bands. Fascinating stuff.&quot; Another writer states that &quot;As music history, this book is important. None of these bands got much coverage in mainstream rock magazines while they were doing their most innovative and vital work, and Azerrad has done a great job of gathering ex-bandmembers up for revealing interviews...However, the book collapses under the weight of its own in-crowd cool.&quot;

Former Hüsker Dü bassist, Greg Norton, was critical of the book, stating in a 2024 interview, &quot;When Azerrad wrote &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot;, I believe he was just looking to sensationalize a lot of stories. Yeah, there are probably some things in there that are accurate, but I think a lot of things got blown out of proportion, just to...like, &#x27;Hey, look how crazy these guys are!&#x27; I mean, you read through his book, I think the only band that he didn&#x27;t really sensationalize was the Minutemen, and I think that was just from, you know, respect and reverence for D. Boon passing.&quot;

==Audiobook==
On May 21, 2019, the &quot;Our Band Could Be Your Life&quot; audiobook was released. The narrator for each chapter is an artist who has cited their corresponding chapter&#x27;s musical act as a major influence on their own art, with Azzerad himself reading the chapter on Fugazi.

<doc id="1099502" wikidata="Q3487137" url="?curid=1099502" title="Wolf in the Fold">
<text>&quot;Wolf in the Fold&quot; is the fourteenth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Robert Bloch and directed by Joseph Pevney, it was first broadcast on December 22, 1967.

In the episode, a series of horrific murders of women, on a world where such things never happen, points to Mr. Scott as the prime suspect.

==Plot==
Captain Kirk, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott of the Federation starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; are enjoying therapeutic shore leave at a night club on planet Argelius II. Mr. Scott (&quot;Scotty&quot;) is introduced to Kara, a dancer at the club, and leaves with her. As Kirk and McCoy make their way through an evening fog to another private club, they hear a scream, and find the dancer dead on the ground with Scotty standing against a nearby wall, clutching a bloody knife.

Scott is detained and interrogated by Mr. Hengist, an administrator from Rigel IV and head of Argelius&#x27;s police operations. Jaris, the Prefect of the planet, appears and bids his wife, Sybo, employ the Argelian empathic contact to determine the truth. While she prepares for the ritual, Lieutenant Karen Tracy, an &quot;Enterprise&quot; medical specialist, beams down with a psycho-tricorder, interviews Scott, and is murdered. The evidence again points to Scott.

Sybo proceeds with the empathic contact ritual. The participants hold hands as in a seance, and Sybo begins to speak of a &quot;monstrous, terrible evil&quot;, &quot;a hunger that never dies&quot;, which has been named &quot;Kesla&quot;, &quot;Beratis&quot;, &quot;Redjac.&quot; The altar fire goes out, and Sybo screams. When the lights come on, Scott is holding Sybo&#x27;s dead body.

The Prefect, over Hengist&#x27;s objections, agrees to continue the investigation aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Both Scott and Kara&#x27;s fiancé Morla are questioned under &quot;accuracy scan&quot; by the computer, which confirms the testimony of both. Scott also speaks of a cold, evil presence during Sybo&#x27;s ceremony, and the computer again verifies the accuracy of the statement.

Kirk queries the computer on the names spoken by Sybo, including &quot;Redjac&quot;. The computer responds with &quot;Red Jack&quot;, a name given to the serial killer better known as Jack the Ripper. That, and Sybo&#x27;s mention of a &quot;hunger that never dies&quot;, suggests to Kirk that an immortal, non-corporeal entity might be involved. &quot;Beratis&quot; is found to be the name of a serial killer on Rigel IV. Suspicion falls on Hengist, not least because the murder weapon was made on Rigel IV. Hengist attempts to flee, but Kirk punches him and apparently kills him. Maniacal laughter is then heard from the computer. Apparently, the entity has jumped from Hengist&#x27;s body to the computer, from which it can control the ship.

The entity begins to threaten the crew to generate the fear it feeds on. Kirk orders Doctor McCoy to administer fast-acting tranquilizers to all hands, and Spock ties up the computer by ordering it to compute the value of pi to its last decimal place. After attempting to possess Jaris, the entity returns to the body of Hengist, which is immediately tranquilized. Kirk carries Hengist to the Transporter Room, where he is beamed into space at &quot;maximum dispersion&quot;. Spock notes that the entity will survive only as separate bits of energy before perishing. He then suggests that the tranquilized crew resume their shore leave.

==Reception==
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; commented that &quot;women are treated like a completely different species&quot;. A repeated point for denunciation is Spock&#x27;s infamous remark that &quot;women are more easily and more deeply terrified, generating more sheer horror than the male of the species.&quot;

Writing in 2010, Torie Atkinson objected to Kirk&#x27;s demand for a &quot;psycho-tricorder,&quot; which, McCoy says, &quot;will give us a detailed account of everything that&#x27;s happened to Mister Scott in the last twenty-four hours.&quot; Atkinson wrote, &quot;Seriously? All this time they&#x27;ve had a piece of technology that reads and records memories, and they&#x27;ve been using these archaic &quot;court martials?&quot; Why ever investigate anything? This is easily the most ridiculous invention-of-the-week that &quot;Star Trek&quot; has thrown out there so far.&quot; However, she added that &quot;it&#x27;s nice to see Scotty front-and-center, and his abject terror at what&#x27;s happening to him and crying over feeling powerless and dangerous were moving.&quot; She also &quot;liked the humor—there are a lot of good one-liners (particularly McCoy&#x27;s line about having drugs that could tranquilize an active volcano)&quot; as well as &quot;the idea of a murder mystery in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.&quot;

Eugene Myers also &quot;liked the idea of a classic murder mystery with &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters, complete with a locked room murder where the lights go out and someone screams.&quot; Myers wrote a negative review, although he admired some details, such as &quot;the table lights used to show appreciation for a good performance, an interesting detail of an alien culture that was sadly lacking for the rest of the episode&quot; and &quot;the brief look at the foggy Argelian streets (purposefully evocative of Whitechapel?).&quot; He concluded that &quot;this episode feels like someone took some other plot and shoehorned &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters into it, which is pretty much what happened.&quot;

Reviewer Jeff Bond was mostly pleased with the episode:
Bond adds,
Melissa N. Hayes-Gehrke of the University of Maryland pointed out: &quot;A conversation between Kirk and Spock informs us for the first time that when Starfleet members are on a planet, they are subject to the laws of that planet. This is a very interesting development, with repercussions throughout all of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.&quot; She also wrote: &quot;This episode showcases Kirk&#x27;s loyalty to his crewmen, as well as Kirk and Spock&#x27;s synergy while engaging in completely random speculation.&quot;

Zach Handlen dismissed most of the story as not having &quot;had enough drafts,&quot; saying that it &quot;has its own strong idea; but what&#x27;s so weird is the way that idea doesn&#x27;t actually surface till the last ten minutes of the episode.&quot; He considered the strongest section to be when Redjac invades the computer: &quot;Sure, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; computer&#x27;s been screwed with before, but hearing a disembodied voice screaming for your death is très spooky; as is the vision of hell (or colored mist) we get in the computer display screens ... There are some clever bits that come out of dealing with a possessed ship.&quot; 
In 2014, Charlie Jane Anders at &quot;io9&quot; ranked &quot;Wolf in the Fold&quot; as the 76th best episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot; in a list of the top 100 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes.
In 2017, &quot;Heroes &amp; Icons&quot; noted this episode as featuring scary &quot;Star Trek&quot; content, noting that it ties into the story of Jack the Ripper.

<text>Juan Antonio López (June 15, 1952, in Culiacán, Sinaloa – June 29, 2004, in Culiacán) was a Mexican professional boxer who competed from 1971 to 1992.

López was best known for fighting Wilfredo Gómez twice for the WBC Super Bantamweight title, losing by a knockout in seven rounds the first time, and by a knockout in ten rounds the second time. Most importantly, he is credited with introducing Julio César Chávez to the sport. He retired in 1992 with a 66-19 record (46 KO’s), and trained other fighters from his native Culiacán.

In January 2003, it was learned that López had leukemia. He died on June 29, 2004.

Julio César Chávez told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1992 that he considered López to be his hero as a child and tried to emulate him.

<text>The EMC E4 was a , A1A-A1A passenger train-hauling diesel locomotive built by the Electro-Motive Corporation of La Grange, Illinois. All were built for the Seaboard Air Line Railway. The E4 was the fifth model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units.

The was achieved with two EMC model 567 V12 engines developing , each engine driving its own electrical generator to power the traction motors.

The front noses of the EA, E1A, E3A, E4A, E5A, and E6A cab units had a pronounced slant when viewed from the side. Therefore, these six models have been nicknamed &quot;slant nose&quot; units. Later E-unit models received the same blunted &quot;bulldog nose&quot; as the F-units.

Ironically, the E4 was produced before the E3. Both models were identical, save for the E4 having a pneumatically-operated nose door passageway in order to facilitate crew movement between units in a locomotive consist.

All the E4s were retired and scrapped by 1964.

<text>is a character and the main protagonist of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, a role-playing video game that was produced by Square (now Square Enix). Within the game&#x27;s plot, Squall is a 17-year-old student at Balamb Garden, a prestigious military academy for elite mercenaries (known as &quot;SeeDs&quot;). Forced into becoming the due to his outstanding skills, Squall befriends his underlings, and falls in love with Rinoa Heartilly. These relationships, combined with the game&#x27;s plot, gradually change him from being a loner to an open, caring person. Squall has appeared in several other games, including &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot;, &quot;Itadaki Street Special&quot;, and the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series as the older mentor-like figure named .

Squall was designed by Tetsuya Nomura with input from game director Yoshinori Kitase. He was modeled after the actor River Phoenix. Squall&#x27;s weapon, the gunblade, was made so it would be difficult to master. To ensure players understand Squall&#x27;s silent attitude, Kazushige Nojima made the character&#x27;s thoughts open to them. Squall&#x27;s first voiced appearance is in the first &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; game, in which he is voiced by Hideo Ishikawa in Japanese and by David Boreanaz in English; Doug Erholtz has since assumed the role for later English-speaking appearances.

Squall had a mixed reaction from critics, some of whom judging him poorly in comparison with other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; heroes due to his coldness and angst, and others praised his character development. The character has been popular, and his relationship with Rinoa has been notably praised.

==Creation==
While previous games in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise involved an ensemble cast, for &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; the Square staff decided to create a story centered around a hero and the heroine according to director Yoshinori Kitase. The rest of the characters were created to support the relationship between the duo. When asked about what is one thing Kitase would change about the game, he mentioned the FH concert where Rinoa Heartily mocks Squall by mimicking his mannerisms and he raises his hand at her and she dodges. Writer Kasushige Nojima was against this action, claiming a man should not hit a girl. Square&#x27;s Hiroki Chiba said the scene in which Squall and Rinoa embrace in space is his favorite in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise due to the use of Faye Wong&#x27;s song &quot;Eyes On Me&quot; in the background and because he had to adjust every frame to make the scene work. 

The first illustration of Squall was used to create the world around him. The game&#x27;s logo that depicted Squall embracing Rinoa was left open for interpretation by players. After Nojima created the scenario, Nomura created the game&#x27;s introduction movie mostly on his own which left a major positive reaction on the Square staff. In &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; Nojima wanted to give players insight into Squall&#x27;s thoughts in contrast to &quot;VII&quot;, which encouraged players to speculate on them. According to Nojima, the development staff made Squall &quot;cool&quot;. In the video game it is implied the character Laguna Loire is Squall&#x27;s father but Square Enix has never confirmed this idea. Nomura designed Squall to contrast with Laguna; while Laguna is seen as a friendly man, Squall is distant and silent. The staff found this problematic and thus Squall was given a character arc of him opening up to others to make the story easier to make fitting for a lone wolf. While at first these two characters&#x27; stories run parallel, they would ultimately clashed as conceptualized by Nomura.

In the original Japanese game, Squall has a tendency to respond negatively to other characters&#x27; comments by using sarcastic remarks like &quot;well, excuse me&quot;. In the English localization this was turned into a catchphrase known as &quot;whatever&quot;.

===Design===

Squall Leonhart was the first character Nomura designed for &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;; he was inspired by actor River Phoenix, although Nomura said &quot;nobody understood it&quot;. Squall is tall, and initially had long hair and a feminine appearance. The scar on Squall&#x27;s forehead was also left ambiguous although Nomura said it was important for him. After objections from Kitase, Nomura made the character more masculine and added a scar across Squall&#x27;s brow and the bridge of his nose to make him more recognizable similar to Cloud Strife&#x27;s striking spiky hair from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, leaving its cause up to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima.

Nomura&#x27;s design of Squall included a fur lining along his jacket collar as a challenge for the game&#x27;s full motion video designers. Nomura created Squall&#x27;s and its silver accessories. The weapon is a sword that has components of a revolver that send vibrations through the blade when they are triggered; this inflicts additional damage as Squall strikes an enemy if the player presses the R1 trigger on the controller. Although the weapon was intended as a novel way for players to control weapons in battle, Nomura said he feels it looks odd in retrospect and that it was very difficult to master. According to other staff members, Nomura&#x27;s idea with the Gunblade was combine the two weapons and expand the sense of strength.

===Portrayal===

While &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; does not use voice acting, Squall has a voice in the Square Enix series &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, in which he is known as Leon. He is voiced by David Boreanaz in the English version of the game and Hideo Ishikawa in the Japanese version. He returns in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; and is voiced in the English version by Doug Erholtz, who said he had a &quot;fun journey&quot; voicing Leon and that it was a &quot;really fun role to play&quot;. 

For the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, Nomura decided to use Squall as a mentor character to newcomer Sora. Event planner Jun Akiyama persuaded Nomura to change Squall&#x27;s name to Leon in order to make his introduction more surprising to the players as he is first mentioned in a letter from Mickey Mouse. The last name Leonhart was removed for unspecified reasons. Meanwhile, some parts of his design were changed to reference Rinoa&#x27;s, most noticeably the wings in his jacket in order to signify that something happened between the two in the past. However, the real reason for the two being split was because Nomura had problems writing Rinoa out of all &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; characters. Leon&#x27;s design was revised to be more effeminated using the original sketches from &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; that only appeared in the game&#x27;s logo. Although polygons were used alongside other returning &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters, Leon could not return in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; which bothered many of the staff members.

In the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; fighting game, Erholtz said that Squall came across as an easy character to understand but felt he was not very emotive. This stoic personality led to Erholtz claim that Squall is fighting an inner darkness as shown by his facial expressions. Erholtz found the game to be fun to do due to all the people he worked with.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;===
At the beginning of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, Squall is known as a &quot;lone wolf&quot; because he never shows his feelings and seems unresponsive to his associates. His superiors including his teacher Quistis Trepe consider him challenging to deal with but respect his talents. Squall is stoical and his taciturn nature used for comic relief. He is forced into a heroic role midway through the game when Cid, headmaster of Balamb Garden, appoints him the leader of the academy. During a late battle against Galbadia Garden, Squall has difficulty leading because of his lingering isolation. Although other characters try to become less reserved and Rinoa Heartilly expends considerable energy pursuing him, it takes time for him to accept the others&#x27; friendship, and fall in love with Rinoa. Later in the game, Squall becomes more comfortable in a leadership role, especially when he must fight Ultimecia.

Throughout the game, Squall has a rivalry with Seifer Almasy. The two characters scar each other at the beginning but later they are supposed to cooperate; they still quarrel, however. Although Seifer later allies with the Sorceress, requiring Squall to fight him several times, Squall still feels a camaraderie with Seifer.

According to flashbacks during the game, Squall grew up in an orphanage with the other playable characters, except Rinoa. The orphans were cared for by Edea; although Squall remembers little about his past, he becomes an emotionally detached, cynical, and introverted boy whose goal is to go through life without emotional ties or dependence. He gradually warms and his detachment from his companions is later revealed to be a defensive mechanism to protect himself from the emotional pain he suffered when he and his older step sister were separated.

After Ultimecia is defeated, the time and space she had absorbed begin to return to normal, pulling Squall&#x27;s comrades back into their places in the timeline while Squall returns to the orphanage and meets a younger Edea. Squall plants the ideas for Garden and SeeD in her mind, creating an origin paradox; Squall must become the leader of Balamb Garden so he can pass its version of SeeD tradition to Edea, who teaches them to her husband Cid, who co-founds Balamb Garden, which admits Edea&#x27;s orphans—including Squall.

===Other appearances===
Squall appears as a non-playable character in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, in which he wears a short leather jacket with red wings on the back and a Griever necklace. Squall takes the name Leon as an alias because he is ashamed of not protecting those he loved from the Heartless when his home world the Radiant Garden was consumed by darkness. His role in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; is to help guide the protagonist Sora in his battle against the Heartless. Although Squall&#x27;s appearance and age differ—he is 25 in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;— and 17 in &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;), his personality remains the same. A memory-based version of Squall (as Leon) appears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot; teaching gameplay in a tutorial. In the sequel &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; game, he works with his friends to restore their world alongside Sora while facing the army of Heartless creatures used by the villains, Organization XIII. Squall also appears as an opponent in Olympus Coliseum tournaments, where he is often paired with other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters. His virtual replica appears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts coded&quot;, in which it meets Sora&#x27;s virtual replica. Leon&#x27;s latest appearance is in the &quot;Remind&quot; DLC of &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; as a cameo. He is also featured in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; manga where his portrayal is more comical.

Squall is a secret character in &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot; and &quot;Itadaki Street Special&quot;, and a sprite version of him occasionally appears on the loading screen of the PlayStation version of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. He appears as a playable character in every &quot;&quot; title. He is one of Cosmos&#x27; chosen warriors to determined to fight Chaos&#x27; Ultimecia. He returns with his &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; as downloadable content (DLC) in &quot;Dissidia 012&quot; where Squall is defeated by Kain Highwind from &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; who wants him to stop from fighting Chaos&#x27; mannekins army. In the latest installment, &quot;Dissidia NT&quot;, Squall teams up with several other Materia soldiers, mostly Bartz from &quot;Final Fantasy V&quot;, and faces Jecht from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;.

He is a playable character in &quot;Itadaki Street Portable&quot; and is the main character representing &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; in the rhythm games &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot;, its follow-up &quot;Curtain Call&quot;, and the arcade-only game &quot;TFF: All Star Carnival&quot;. Squall also appears as a premium character in &quot;Pictlogica Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;All The Bravest&quot;, both of which are designed for Android and iOS. He is also present in &quot;Mobius Final Fantasy&quot; where Squall finds himself in an alternate version of Balamb Garden.

==Reception== 
===Popularity===
Squall became a popular character within the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, appearing in lists from GamesRadar about heroes, or characters in general by GameZone. He was also described as the most popular video game character. Despite negative commentary, GameDaily and Den of Geek found him visually appealing. In designing Trevor Belmont, the protagonist from the &quot;Castlevania&quot; Netflix series, Squall was a major influence in order to give Trevor a &quot;cool&quot; look.

===Critical response===
Critical reaction to Squall was mixed. Jack Patrick Rodgers of PopMatters said Squall&#x27;s cynicism and frustration with those around him made him a strong character but &quot;coldly inhuman&quot;. Despite sharing a similar view, GameSpot said the &quot;standoffish because of some repressed Wagnerian broodiness, in which case he was kind of interesting&quot;. According to IGN, the problem with the game was that is too centered around Squall&#x27;s who comes across as a &quot;jerk&quot; most of the time, making him impossible to relate. 1UP.com still found him irrating, comparing him with similar archetypes explored in the franchise, but &quot;Edge&quot; compared Squall unfavorably with &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; protagonist Cloud Strife, as the former&#x27;s angst is not given a proper source unlike the latter&#x27;s The Gamer said Squall&#x27;s antisocial personality might divide gamers. Eurogamer commented that while Squall remains an unlikable character even after his character arcs that contrast the more social and expressive &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; leads like Tidus or Noctis Lucis Caelum, he still remained as a realistic take on a soldier. While noting that Squall manages to become a better person, the changes are minimum and the idea of him being able to save the world comes across as &quot;cringe comedy&quot; due to its characterization.

There was also commentary about Squall and Rinoa&#x27;s relationship. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; Brett Elston criticized it, comparing it with the romance from &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, but in a different article, he commented that &quot;Squall and Rinoa are at the heart of it all&quot; even if they do not properly develop. According to Ryan Woo of &quot;Complex&quot;, the problem with the romance was it because it was mostly one-sided from Rinoa&#x27;s side until the latter parts of the game where Squall&#x27;s development makes it come across as forced. Mike Gorby, writing for Goomba Stomp, said the character lacks realism in comparison to Rinoa. On a more positive view, the website called Squall and Rinoa the best couple created by Square Enix, noting the differences between them and that their relationship is the first in the series to drive the plot of a game. Christopher Michael Baker of Allgame said that his romance changes the main character for the better as he originally hated him. &quot;RPGFan&quot; found their relationship complicated to like as despite Rinoa&#x27;s being easygoing with Squall on their first meetings with the protagonist, the fact that she previously dated the antagonistic Seifer made it complicated to take Rinoa properly and instead cannot find himself able to flirt with Rinoa back.

There was commentary over Squall&#x27;s Leon persona from &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. RPGInformer was shocked by his introduction not only due to the crossover element provided in the first game but also because Squall was voiced for the first time. Erutid said that Leon is far more mature than his younger Squall persona as he is no longer filled with constant angst when compared with his &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; persona. Despite being initially confused with Leon&#x27;s appearance and weaponry in the first &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; boss fight, Polygon enjoyed his character. In a retrospect, the writer found the idea of the crossover ridiculous. Arnold Katayev of PSXextreme praised Squall&#x27;s redesign in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; as the game&#x27;s best character design. Comic Book Resources lamented how Squall and the rest of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters became cameos in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; and the player never gets the chance to fight against them. VentureBeat said that while &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; offered Squall a more passable backstory, he still lacked development to the point he is often overshadowed by Laguna not only in his original appearance but also &quot;Dissdia&quot;. In retrospect, while Fanbyte found Leon more sexually appealing than Squall, the writer felt that his new backstory made the character unlikable as he broods even more than in his original game. 

Kotaku commented that voice actor David Boreanaz made &quot;stilted and odd&quot; and, among other &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; actors, he was overshadowed by Billy Zane&#x27;s portrayal of Xehanort, also referred as Ansem. In contrast, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; praised Boreanaz. GameRant believes David Boreanaz was chosen for Squall&#x27;s role due to voicing a similar brooding anti-hero, Angel, in &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; with Doug Erholtz providing a nearly identical performance in following games. Hideo Ishikawa&#x27;s performance as Squall was highlighted as popular within even if he never got the chance to properly voice him in his original game as said by fans in Animate Times.

<doc id="1099518" wikidata="Q54426" url="?curid=1099518" title="2004 Brazilian Grand Prix">
<text>The 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix (officially the Formula 1 Grande Prêmio do Brasil 2004) was a Formula One motor race held on 24 October 2004 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace. It was Race 18 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship. It marked the first time that a GP in Brazil was held at the end of the F1 season. Juan Pablo Montoya won the race after starting from second on the grid, Kimi Räikkönen finished second after starting third and Rubens Barrichello finished third, his only podium finish at his home event.

==Friday drivers==
The bottom 6 teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.

== Report ==
=== Background ===
Ricardo Zonta returned to his home race for the Toyota team, replacing Olivier Panis, who had retired from the sport after the previous race. It was the last race for Gianmaria Bruni and Zsolt Baumgartner and the Jaguar team. It was also the last race in which Sid Watkins took part in the role of medical officer.

=== Qualifying ===
In qualifying, Barrichello also achieved the fastest lap and secured pole position ahead of Montoya and Räikkönen. It was Barrichello&#x27;s 13th career pole and his last until the 2009 Brazilian Grand Prix.

=== Race ===
The race started with a damp track. Most drivers began on intermediate tyres, with only Alonso, Villeneuve and Coulthard opting for dry tyres. At the start, Barrichello maintained the lead, but the Brazilian driver was overtaken after a few corners by Räikkönen. Montoya, however, got off to a bad start and was relegated to fourth place. The intermediate tires soon proved to be unsuitable for the track, which began to dry out. The first to mount dry tires was Ralf Schumacher, during the 4th lap, and he was followed by every other driver still on intermediate tires, handing Alonso the lead of the race. Meanwhile, Räikkönen and Montoya engaged in an intense duel exiting the pit lane, with the Colombian getting the better of his rival. After tire changes, Alonso led ahead of Montoya, Räikkönen, Ralf Schumacher, Sato, Barrichello, Villeneuve and Coulthard. Alonso gave up first place to Montoya at the end of the 18th lap when he returned to the pits to refuel.

On lap 23, Webber attempted to overtake his teammate Klien, but the two came into contact. Webber was forced to retire, while Klien returned to the pits to repair his car. At the head of the race, Räikkönen followed Montoya closely, but the Williams driver managed to control him without any particular problems. Further back, Barrichello tries to recover from Sato. The second series of pit stops brings no changes in position between these four drivers, but allows Alonso to move up to third place, ahead of Ralf Schumacher. On lap 32, however, Sato makes a mistake at the first braking, giving up fifth place to Barrichello. Montoya had a good lead over Räikkönen and was driving a car with more fuel.

The third series of pit stops proved decisive. Alonso, the only one among the leading drivers to make two stops, refueled on lap 47, followed in sequence by Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Montoya and Michael Schumacher, who returned to the pits at the same time on lap 50. Räikkönen, leading the race, pushed hard to try to overtake his rival, but when the Finn also made his pit stop, on lap 55, he returned to the track just one second behind Montoya. Behind him, Barrichello prevailed against his direct competitors in the duel for third place. A queue of cars formed behind him, with Alonso a few tenths ahead of Sato, Ralf Schumacher and Michael Schumacher. At the front of the race, Räikkönen tried in vain to put pressure on Montoya, but the Colombian was not distracted and took his first win of the season ahead of Räikkönen, Barrichello, Alonso and Ralf Schumacher. For Montoya it was the 4th victory of his career, and for Williams it was the last victory until the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix. It would be Barrichello&#x27;s first finish at Interlagos in ten years and his only podium, with third place; his previous finish at the circuit being at the season opening in 1994 (a fourth place).

<text>Mount Louis is a mountain summit located in southeast Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. It is part of the Sawback Range which is a subset of the Canadian Rockies.

The mountain was named in 1886 after Louis B. Stewart who surveyed in the Banff Park area in 1904 with his father, George Stewart, the first Park Superintendent.

==Geology==
Mount Louis is composed of limestone, a sedimentary rock laid down during the Devonian period. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Louis is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 °C with wind chill factors below -30 °C. Weather conditions during summer months are optimum for climbing. Precipitation runoff from Mount Louis drains into the Bow River which is a tributary of the Saskatchewan River.

<text>The EMC E3 is a , A1A-A1A diesel-electric passenger locomotive that was manufactured by Electro-Motive Corporation of La Grange, Illinois as part of the E Series of EMC/EMD diesel passenger locomotives. The EMC demonstrator #822 was released from La Grange for test on September 12, 1938. The cab version, or E3A, was manufactured from September 1938 to June 1940, and 17 were produced. The booster version, or E3B, was manufactured in March 1939 and September 1939, and 2 were produced. The was achieved by putting two , 12-cylinder, model 567 engines in the engine compartment. Each engine drove its own electrical generator to power the traction motors. The E3 was the fourth model in a long line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units.

Compared with passenger locomotives made later by EMD, the noses of the E3, E4, E5, and E6 cab units had pronounced slants when viewed from the side. Therefore, these four models have been nicknamed &quot;slant nose&quot; units. Later E models had the more vertical &quot;bulldog nose&quot; of the F series. E3 demonstrator 822 was built with a nose identical to earlier EA and E1A units, but later locomotives in the series featured an elevated headlamp mounted in a nacelle, distinct from the flush profile mounting of the earlier units. 822 was modified in a similar fashion prior to delivery to the Kansas City Southern Railway.

==Engine and powertrain==
The E3 introduced a 12-cylinder version of the 567 series Diesel engine, with two being used for a total of 2,000 hp at 800 rpm. Earlier E-units had used two Winton 201A prime movers, but that engine was ill-suited to railroad use and was unreliable. The 567, which was specifically designed for railroad motive power applications, is a mechanically aspirated, two-stroke 45-degree V-type with displacement per cylinder, and remained in production until 1966. Two direct current generators, one per engine, provide power to four traction motors, two on each truck, in an A1A-A1A arrangement. This truck design was used on all E-units and on MP 7100, CB&amp;Q 9908, and Rock Island AB6 power cars. EMC/EMD has built all of its major components since 1939.

==Original owners==
===A units===
===B units===
==Surviving example==
The only remaining E3 is ex-Atlantic Coast Line Railroad E3A #501. It was formerly owned by the late Glen Monhart, and operated on excursions in Wisconsin. Today, it is owned by the North Carolina Dept. of Transportation Rail Division, and is on long-term loan to the North Carolina Transportation Museum, in Spencer, North Carolina. It is stored in operating condition, and is run occasionally. In January 2013, NCDOT transferred ownership of the engine to the NC Department of Cultural Resources, Spencer Shops parent organization.

<text>The Research Science Institute (RSI) is an international summer research program for high school students. RSI is sponsored by the Center for Excellence in Education (CEE) and hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. RSI brings together the top STEM talent from around the world for the opportunity to conduct original scientific research, cost-free, for six weeks during the summer before their final year of high school.

==History==
The Research Science Institute was founded in 1984 by Admiral H.G. Rickover and Joann P. DiGennaro. It was originally called the &quot;Rickover Science Institute&quot; until the 1986 session, when it was renamed to its current name. The original name is also the source of the nickname of RSI attendees, &quot;Rickoids&quot;.

== Program ==
RSI is run by CEE president Joann P. DiGennaro and Executive Vice President Maite P. Ballestero. 100 students from several countries (generally, two-thirds of the students are from the United States and one-third from other countries) are selected to participate in the six-week summer program. More than 2,500 applications are received each year, making RSI one of the most selective summer programs in the United States.

The first week of RSI is composed of tutorials and seminars on contemporary research of interest by esteemed Professors from top universities, many of whom are alumni. The next four weeks are centered on individual research projects through mentors in the Boston area, the majority being at labs at MIT, Harvard and other local universities. The last week is devoted to paper and presentation writing, following by the RSI Final Symposium, and encore presentations, which features the top 10 presentations decided by academic staff at RSI. After that, the top 5 presentations are determined by a panel of industry leaders in research and STEM.

The RSI Distinguished Lecture Series, which continues throughout the program, brings distinguished professors, scientists, and industry leaders in STEM, including a number of Nobel laureates, many of whom are RSI alumni, to speak to RSI students in evening lecture-style format. In recent years, the RSI Distinguished Lecture Series has included Nobel Prize-winning physicist Wolfgang Ketterle, Nobel Prize-winning chemist Dudley Herschbach, Nobel Prize-winning geneticist Phillip Sharp, evolutionary biologist Pardis Sabeti, mathematician and chess master Noam Elkies, Akamai Technologies co-founder and CEO Tom Leighton, and mathematician Michael Sipser. RSI&#x27;s staff is generally composed primarily, if not entirely, of alumni, with recent Rickoids (RSI alumni, from the Institute&#x27;s original name) filling in as counselors and TAs and older alumni taking administrative, lecturing, or tutoring positions.

==Location==
Though it has convened at various locations (including two years, 1990 and 2004, when the program was held concurrently on both coasts of the US, at UC San Diego and The George Washington University in 1989-1991, and Caltech and MIT in 2004), the Institute is most often associated with MIT, where it has been held every summer since 1992, for various reasons including availability of local mentorships (with Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard Medical School all within a few minutes of central campus) and convenience of facilities. The program participants were housed in East Campus through 2003, Simmons Hall from 2004-2013, Fariborz Maseeh Hall from 2014-2017, MacGregor House in 2018, and Baker House in 2019. In 2020 and 2021, however, RSI went fully virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RSI returned to in-person in 2022, and participants were housed in Next House. In 2023 and 2024, participants were housed again in Baker House.

==Similar programs in other countries==
In 2006, a new program, RSI-Fudan, (Chinese name: 未来科学家夏令营) was held at Fudan University in Shanghai, China for Chinese students. Thirty-five local students were selected from key high schools to participate in the program and the staff was composed with previous Rickoids and CEE/Fudan affiliates from both the U.S. and China. Five years later, in 2011, another new program, the Saudi Research Science Institute, or SRSI, was founded, and held at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. In the first year of SRSI (2011), twenty-five scientifically talented students were selected and attended a six-week session modeled on RSI. The number of students was increased to forty in 2012 and 2013 and to forty-five in 2014. In the summer of 2015, the inaugural RSI Tsinghua was held in Beijing for the very first time. As an official cooperation between the CEE and Tsinghua University, this program held research experiences for 34 outstanding high school students in China. In Sweden, Research Academy for Young Scientists (RAYS) takes place annually for 21 incoming high school seniors who are most qualified in STEM.

In 2009, Center for Excellence in Education started the first chapter in India in the city of Chennai, It was called Research Science Initiative-Chennai. It is an intensive four-week program held at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. This was in collaboration with the PSBB Group of Schools, IIT Madras, Chennai Mathematical Institute, SASTRA University and other leading institutions in the fields of science and technology. This was with the support of all secondary schools in Chennai from where the students were selected. After a pilot program in 2009, it was expanded the following year with Ms. Joann P. DiGennaro presiding over the valediction.

A similar program, Summer Research School in mathematics and informatics, has been running in Bulgaria since 2001. It is intended for high school students with profound interests in mathematics, informatics (computer science) and IT. At first, the program was attended each year by 40 Bulgarian students but now in accepts international students. In 2016 the Summer Research School was attended by 50 students, of whom 9 were international. The program is organized by the High School Student Institute of Mathematics and Informatics.

The Science Research Programme in Singapore was modeled after RSI.

==Alumni==
Fields Medalist Terence Tao attended RSI in 1989. ActBlue was founded by two 1994 RSI participants, Benjamin Rahn and Matt DeBergalis. Pinterest co-founder Ben Silbermann and American physicist Jeremy England attended RSI in 1998. Broad Institute and MIT neurobiologist, optogenetics pioneer, developer of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing method, and &quot;35 Innovators Under 35&quot; laureate Feng Zhang attended RSI in 1999.

As of 2022, 191 finalists, 697 semifinalists, and 12 1st-place winners in the Regeneron Science Talent Search have been RSI alumni. In the Siemens Competition, 243 finalists and semifinalists, and three 1st-place winners have been RSI alumni. As of 2022, 13 Rhodes Scholars and 15 Marshall Scholars have been RSI alumni.

<doc id="1099547" wikidata="Q913236" url="?curid=1099547" title="Osteocyte">
<text>An osteocyte, an oblate shaped type of bone cell with dendritic processes, is the most commonly found cell in mature bone. It can live as long as the organism itself. The adult human body has about 42 billion of them. Osteocytes do not divide and have an average half life of 25 years. They are derived from osteoprogenitor cells, some of which differentiate into active osteoblasts (which may further differentiate to osteocytes). Osteoblasts/osteocytes develop in mesenchyme.

In mature bones, osteocytes and their processes reside inside spaces called lacunae (Latin for a &quot;pit&quot;) and canaliculi, respectively. Osteocytes are simply osteoblasts trapped in the matrix that they secrete. They are networked to each other via long cytoplasmic extensions that occupy tiny canals called canaliculi, which are used for exchange of nutrients and waste through gap junctions.

Although osteocytes have reduced synthetic activity and (like osteoblasts) are not capable of mitotic division, they are actively involved in the routine turnover of bony matrix, through various mechanosensory mechanisms. They destroy bone through a rapid, transient (relative to osteoclasts) mechanism called osteocytic osteolysis. Hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate is deposited around the cell.

==Structure==
Osteocytes have a stellate shape, approximately 7 micrometers deep and wide by 15 micrometers in length. The cell body varies in size from 5–20 micrometers in diameter and contain 40–60 cell processes per cell, with a cell to cell distance between 20–30 micrometers. A mature osteocyte contains a single nucleus that is located toward the vascular side and has one or two nucleoli and a membrane. The cell also exhibits a reduced size endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and mitochondria, and cell processes that radiate largely towards the bone surfaces in circumferential lamellae, or towards a haversian canal and outer cement line typical of osteons in concentric lamellar bone. Osteocytes form an extensive lacunocanalicular network within the mineralized collagen type I matrix, with cell bodies residing within lacunae, and cell/dendritic processes within channels called canaliculi.

==Development==
The fossil record shows that osteocytes were present in bones of jawless fish 400 to 250 million years ago. Osteocyte size has been shown to covary with genome size; and this relationship has been used in paleogenomic research.

During bone formation, an osteoblast is left behind and buried in the bone matrix as an &quot;osteoid osteocyte&quot;, which maintains contact with other osteoblasts through extended cellular processes. Although recently it was shown that vascular smooth muscle cells drive osteocyte differentiation, most aspects of osteocytogenesis remain largely unknown. Various molecules have been reported to be involved. Examples include matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP-1), osteoblast/osteocyte factor 45 (OF45), Klotho, TGF-beta inducible factor (TIEG), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), E11 antigen, and oxygen. 10–20% of osteoblasts differentiate into osteocytes. Those osteoblasts on the bone surface that are destined for burial as osteocytes slow down matrix production, and are buried by neighboring osteoblasts that continue to produce matrix actively.

Palumbo et al. (1990) distinguish three cell types from osteoblast to mature osteocyte: type I preosteocyte (osteoblastic osteocyte), type II preosteocyte (osteoid osteocyte), and type III preosteocyte (partially surrounded by mineral matrix). The embedded &quot;osteoid-osteocyte&quot; must do two functions simultaneously: regulate mineralization and form connective dendritic processes, which requires cleavage of collagen and other matrix molecules. The transformation from motile osteoblast to entrapped osteocyte takes about three days, and during this time, the cell produces a volume of extracellular matrix three times its own cellular volume, which results in 70% volume reduction in the mature osteocyte cell body compared to the original osteoblast volume. The cell undergoes a dramatic transformation from a polygonal shape to a cell that extends dendrites toward the mineralizing front, followed by dendrites that extend to either the vascular space or bone surface. As the osteoblast transitions to an osteocyte, alkaline phosphatase is reduced, and casein kinase II is elevated, as is osteocalcin.

Osteocytes appear to be enriched in proteins that are resistant to hypoxia, which appears to be due to their embedded location and restricted oxygen supply. Oxygen tension may regulate the differentiation of osteoblasts into osteocytes, and osteocyte hypoxia may play a role in disuse-mediated bone resorption.

==Function==
Although osteocytes are relatively inert cells, they are capable of molecular synthesis and modification, as well as transmission of signals over long distances, in a way similar to the nervous system. They are the most common cell type in bone (31,900 per cubic millimeter in bovine bone to 93,200 per cubic millimeter in rat bone). Most of the receptor activities that play an important role in bone function are present in the mature osteocyte. 

Osteocytes are an important regulator of bone mass. Osteocytes contain glutamate transporters that produce nerve growth factors after bone fracture, evidence of a sensing and information transfer system. When osteocytes were experimentally destroyed, the bones showed a significant increase in bone resorption, decreased bone formation, trabecular bone loss, and loss of response to unloading.

Osteocytes are mechanosensor cells that control the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts within a basic multicellular unit (BMU), a temporary anatomic structure where bone remodeling occurs. Osteocytes generate an inhibitory signal that is passed through their cell processes to osteoblasts for recruitment to enable bone formation. 

Osteocytes are also a key endocrine regulator in the metabolism of minerals such as phosphates. Osteocyte-specific proteins such as sclerostin have been shown to function in mineral metabolism, as well as other molecules such as PHEX, DMP-1, MEPE, and FGF-23, which are highly expressed by osteocytes and regulate phosphate and biomineralization. Osteocyte regulation can be linked to disease. For example, Lynda Bonewald determined that osteocytes make FGF23, which travels through the bloodstream to trigger the release of phosphorus by the kidneys. Without enough phosphorus bones and teeth soften, and muscles become weak, as in X-linked hypophosphatemia.

===Sclerostin===
Osteocytes synthesize sclerostin, a secreted protein that inhibits bone formation by binding to LRP5/LRP6 coreceptors and blunting Wnt signaling. Sclerostin, the product of the SOST gene, is the first mediator of communication between osteocytes, bone forming osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts, critical for bone remodeling. Only osteocytes express sclerostin, which acts in a paracrine fashion to inhibit bone formation. Sclerostin is inhibited by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and mechanical loading.
Sclerostin antagonizes the activity of BMP (bone morphogenetic protein), a cytokine that induces bone and cartilage formation.

==Pathophysiology==
Osteonecrosis refers to the classic pattern of cell death and complex osteogenesis and bone resorption processes. Osteocyte necrosis (ON) initiates with hematopoietic and adipocytic cellular necrosis along with interstitial marrow edema. ON happens after about 2 to 3 hours of anoxia; histological signs of osteocytic necrosis do not display until about 24 to 72 hours after hypoxia. ON is first characterized by pyknosis of nuclei, followed by hollow osteocyte lacunae. Capillary revascularization and reactive hyperemia slightly take place at the periphery of the necrosis site, followed by a repair process combining both bone resorption and production that incompletely changes dead with living bone. Nouveau bone overlays onto dead trabeculae along with fragmentary resorption of dead bone. Bone resorption outperforms formation resulting in a net removal of bone, deformed structural integrity of the subchondral trabeculae, joint incongruity, and subchondral fracture.

==Clinical significance==
Clinically important research of gel based &quot;in vitro&quot; 3D model for the osteocytic potentiality of human CD34+ stem cells has been described. The results confirm that the human CD34+ stem cells possess unique osteogenic differentiation potential and can be used in the early regeneration of injured bone. Osteocytes die as a consequence of senescence, degeneration/necrosis, apoptosis (programmed cell death), and/or osteoclastic engulfment. The percentage of dead osteocytes in bone increases with age from less than 1% at birth to 75% after age 80. Osteocyte apoptosis is thought to be related to decreased mechanotransduction, which possibly leads to the development of osteoporosis. Apoptotic osteocytes release apoptotic bodies expressing RANKL to recruit osteoclasts.

Mechanical loading increases osteocyte viability &quot;in vitro&quot;, and contributes to solute transport through the lacuno-canalicular system in bone, which enhances oxygen and nutrient exchange and diffusion to osteocytes. Skeletal unloading has been shown to induce osteocyte hypoxia &quot;in vivo&quot;, this is when osteocytes undergo apoptosis and recruit osteoclasts to resorb bone. Microdamage in bone occurs as the result of repetitive events of cycling loading, and appears to be associated with osteocyte death by apoptosis, which appear to secrete a signal to target osteoclasts to perform remodeling at a damaged site. Under normal conditions, osteocytes express high amounts of TGF-β and thus repress bone resorption, but when bone grows old, the expression levels of TGF-β decrease, and the expression of osteoclast-stimulatory factors, such as RANKL and M-CSF increases, bone resorption is then enhanced, leading to net bone loss.

Mechanical stimulation of osteocytes results in opening of hemichannels to release PGE2 and ATP, among other biochemical signaling molecules, which play a crucial role in maintaining the balance between bone formation and resorption.
Osteocyte cell death can occur in association with pathologic conditions such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, which leads to increased skeletal fragility, linked to the loss of ability to sense microdamage and/or signal repair. Oxygen deprivation that occurs as the result of immobilization (bed rest), glucocorticoid treatment, and withdrawal of oxygen have all been shown to promote osteocyte apoptosis. It is now recognized that osteocytes respond in a variety of ways to the presence of implant biomaterials.

<text>Why England Slept (1940) is the published version of a thesis written by John F. Kennedy in his senior year at Harvard College. Its title alludes to Winston Churchill&#x27;s 1938 book &quot;Arms and the Covenant&quot;, published in the United States as &quot;While England Slept&quot;, which also examined the buildup of German power. Kennedy&#x27;s book examines the failures of the British government to take steps to prevent World War II and its initial lack of response to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s threats of war.

Rather than castigating the popular appeasement policy that the British government then pursued, it is notable for taking the uncommon stance that if Great Britain had confronted Nazi Germany earlier it would have been far more disastrous for her than the delay caused by the appeasement policies of Chamberlain and other British leaders.

==Publication==

The book was originally intended to be no more than a college thesis. It was rated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; by Professor Henry A. Yeomans and &quot;cum laude plus&quot; by Professor Carl J. Friedrich. However, Kennedy&#x27;s father, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., keen to elevate his son&#x27;s reputation, encouraged Kennedy to convert the thesis into book form and publish it. He then enlisted the highly influential publishing magnate Henry Luce to write the foreword, and his friend Arthur Krock, former bureau chief of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, to assist in redrafting the thesis, which had originally been titled &quot;Appeasement At Munich.&quot;

The historian Garry Wills claimed that the assistance amounted to rewriting and retitling the manuscript and finding an agent for its publication. As United States ambassador to the United Kingdom, Kennedy Sr. supported British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s policy of appeasement during the late 1930s. His stance furthering appeasement would eventually cause Kennedy Sr.&#x27;s removal as ambassador to the United Kingdom, and prove disastrous for his future political aspirations. By contrast, John F. Kennedy broke with his father&#x27;s support for appeasement, and was moved when he witnessed firsthand the Luftwaffe&#x27;s bombings of Britain.

==Reception==
After it was published in 1940, the book sold 80,000 copies in the United Kingdom and the United States and collected $40,000 in royalties for Kennedy. Income from the British sales were donated to Plymouth, a British city that had recently been bombed by the Luftwaffe. Kennedy bought a Buick convertible with the income from the book&#x27;s North American sales.

==Analysis==
The book addressed Kennedy&#x27;s belief in the need for objective and detached calculation in foreign policy decisions. Kennedy historian and foreign relations professor Fredrik Logevall believed the book demonstrates JFK&#x27;s &quot;commitment to an unsentimental realism in international affairs&quot;. Kennedy is telling future policy makers that &quot;foreign threats cannot be dealt with by ignoring them or wishing them away... they must be confronted by clearheaded and informed calculation&quot;.

<text>West Adams is a neighborhood in the South Los Angeles region of Los Angeles, California. The neighborhood is known for its large number of historic buildings, structures, notable houses, and mansions. It contains several Historic Preservation Overlay Zones as well as designated historic districts.


==History==

West Adams is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city of Los Angeles, with most of its buildings erected between 1880 and 1925, including the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library. West Adams was developed by railroad magnate Henry E. Huntington and wealthy industrialist Hulett C. Merritt of Pasadena. It was once the wealthiest neighborhood in the city, with its Victorian mansions and sturdy Craftsman bungalows, and a home to Downtown businessmen, as well as professors and academicians at the nearby University of Southern California.

===1880s - 1890s===
In 1887, the &quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot; announced that the ensuing St. James Park neighborhood would have a stone entrance to &quot;rival the Arc de Triomphe&quot; and would be eventually be surrounded by &quot;the most costly residences yet erected on this coast&quot;. The parkland was named and donated to the city by George King and his wife in commemoration of their many trips to London. The gated community of Chester Place was developed in 1889 On October 24, 1901, Edward L. Doheny purchased number 8 Chester Place for $120,000 cash.

In 1890, &quot;St. Margaret&#x27;s School for Girls&quot; moved from Pasadena to West Adams. On October 1, 1890, the school opened at the corner of 23rd and Scarff Streets. Occupying the empty Marlborough Hotel, the school adopted the name of its new location and was renamed the &quot;Marlborough School for Girls&quot;. It remained in West Adams for 26 years before relocating to Hancock Park in 1916.

===1900s - 1910s===
In 1906, numerous West Adams residents experienced a water shortage because the new pipe from the Ivanhoe reservoir was not completed on time. The new reservoir would hold nearly &quot;a billion gallons&quot; of water. In September of that year, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter wrote: &quot;The growing popularity of apartment houses is causing them to encroach on grounds heretofore exclusively reserved for high-class residences&quot;. He was reporting on &quot;one of the handsomest apartment-houses in the city&quot;, which was designed by Thornton Fitzhue and was to be built on the southern side of St. James Park. . Landowner John R. Powers completed another apartment building in St. James Place in 1909, with an entrance also on Scarff Street. Designed by George W. Wryman, it was divided into four apartments of seven rooms each; the venture represented an investment of $35,000.

By 1912, other wealthy neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area were being developed; tracts were being advertised in the yet-to-be-incorported Beverly Hills that would &quot;make the dwellers of the West Adams District green with envy&quot;. 

In 1913, the &quot;Times&quot; announced that the Monarch Hotel was to be built in the &quot;fashionable residence district&quot; of West Adams. By 1916, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that the area was &quot;already known for its private parks and handsome homes&quot;. At that time, improvements to the boulevard were being spearheaded by five prominent residents including Isidore B. Dockweiler, William May Garland and Edward L. Doheny. After convincing thirty-five other residents to help with funding, the old street paving between Figueroa and Hoover streets was replaced with an asphalt surface. Adams Boulevard was now 65 feet wide with a series of center islands planted with flowers, shrubs and mature palms. Six-cluster electroliers, which were duplicates of those that lined Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, were installed on both sides of Adams Street. Adams Boulevard was now a &quot;magnificent concourse&quot; and &quot;one of the most popular drives in Los Angeles&quot;.

===1920s - 1930s===
In 1921, the Automobile Club announced that it would build a new headquarters at Figueroa and Adams. Architects Sumner Hunt and S.R. Burns designed a building of &quot;attractive Spanish design&quot; that would be a &quot;distinctive structure for the West Adams district&quot;.

In 1925, silent screen star Ramon Novarro purchased a home in &quot;the exclusive West Adams district&quot; for $12,000 and spent an additional $100,000 on renovations.

In 1927, during the prohibition era, the &quot;Times&quot; reported that the vice squad raided a &quot;luxurious fourteen rooom mansion in the exclusive West Adams district&quot;. The mansion, located at 2234 Adams Street, contained &quot;the most extensive and elaborate moonshine production plant&quot; they had seen in many months.

In 1931, during the Great Depression, the recently organized West Adams Relief Committee provided work for twenty men for ninety days. Married men with families who lived in West Adams and were registered voters would be paid $2 a day.

Though West Adams had previously been described as &quot;fashionable&quot; and &quot;exclusive&quot;, in 1937 the &quot;Times&quot; wrote: &quot;St James Place, Chester Place, Scarff Street - those place-names mean little to present day Angelinos. Yet they spell an aristocratic Los Angeles of the past, and to a good extent, the present. They are of the wealthy Los Angeles of a past generation, and a visitor to the neighborhood will find evidence of its elegance, if somewhat frayed and faded in spots.&quot;

===1940s - 1950s ===

African-Americans began to move in around this time. Notable residents included Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company president Norman O. Houston, actress Hattie McDaniel, civil rights activists John and Vada Sommerville, actress Louise Beavers, band leader Johnny Otis, performers Pearl Bailey and Ethel Waters.

In December 1945, some white residents filed a lawsuit against 31 Black residents—including Hattie McDaniel. She held workshops to strategize for the case and gathered around 250 sympathizers to accompany her to court. Judge Thurmond Clarke left the courtroom to see the disputed neighborhood and threw out the case the following day. He said, &quot;It is time that members of the Negro race are accorded, without reservations or evasions, the full rights guaranteed them under the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution. Judges have been avoiding the real issue too long.&quot; McDaniel’s case set a precedent that later impacted the 1948 &quot;Shelley v. Kramer&quot; decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which held that state courts may not enforce racially restrictive covenants.
In 1949, the headquarters building of the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company opened. The building is a late-period Moderne structure designed by architect Paul Williams. It was once described as &quot;the finest building to be erected and owned by African-Americans in the nation.&quot;

===1960s - 1970s ===

Starting in 1961, construction of the ten-lane Santa Monica Freeway (Interstate 10) tore through West Adams&#x27; core, with the freeway routed east to west just north of Adams Boulevard. Its construction resulted in the taking (by eminent domain) and demolition of numerous West Adams homes, including a number of mansions owned by African Americans. The construction resulted in substantial displacement of West Adams residents, including the relocation of much of the area&#x27;s affluent Black families. As the &quot;Los Angeles Sentinel&quot; reported:The road could have been built without cutting through the so-called Sugar Hill section. However, in order to miss Sugar Hill, it was &quot;said&quot; that the route would have to cut through fraternity and sorority row area around USC. Sorority and fraternity row still stands and Sugar Hill doesn&#x27;t, so you know who won out!As in many other American cities during the heyday of Interstate Highway Act construction, interstate highway rights of way were disproportionately routed through predominantly African American communities, causing substantial displacement of residents and steep declines in neighborhood viability.

In 1971, Los Angeles Metropolitan Medical Center opened as the city’s first black-owned hospital. According to the &quot;LA Weekly&quot; , &quot;In the 1970s and &#x27;80s it was a thriving, vital part of the West Adams community.&quot;

===1980s - present day ===
In 2000, the Alpha Gamma Omega sorority house, a Craftsman structure built in 1911 and located in West Adams, received a Preserve L.A. grant from the Getty Trust.

In 2004, homes were demolished and lots were cleared in West Adams for what was then referred to as &quot;Central High School No. 2&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; reported that &quot;a century-old neighborhood of houses and businesses&quot; were demolished to make room for a new $130 million 15-acre high school. West Adams Preparatory High School opened in the fall semester of 2007 with a final budget of $176 million.

In 2007, the city approved the &quot;West Adams Streetscape Enhancement Program&quot; proposed by LANI (Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative). Improvements included the installation of four &quot;gateway markers&quot; at the corners of Adams Boulevard and Western Avenue and Adams Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. Additionally, 58 magnolia trees were planted along Adams Boulevard between Western and Vermont Avenues, along with additional trees clustered near the gateway markers.

In 2010, This Old House magazine named West Adams as &quot;one of the country’s best neighborhoods for old houses&quot;. Criteria included &quot;architectural diversity, craftsmanship of the homes, and the preservation momentum in the area&quot;. The magazine noted that West Adams was &quot;once home to Los Angeles’s wealthiest 19th-century bankers&quot; and that the neighborhood was best for movie buffs and city life.

In 2011, the &quot;Times&quot; reported on neighbors pushing back against crime and wrote: &quot;The neighborhood around them at Western Avenue and Adams Boulevard might be blighted, but they are not about to cede to urban ills their graceful streets of century-old bungalows, well-tended lawns and curbside jacarandas and towering palms.&quot;

In 2016, then-U.S. Representative (D-Los Angeles) and now Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said, &quot;I tour people through the area all the time and they are surprised when they see beautiful homes, because it&#x27;s not the perception of the neighborhood.&quot; That same year, an empty West Adams Hospital was transformed into a temporary art gallery.

==Geography==

===The City of Los Angeles===

Beginning in 2000, the Eighth District Empowerment Congress began working on the &quot;Naming Neighborhoods Project&quot; to identify and name the communities with the neighborhood council area. Through research, a meeting with an urban historian, and numerous community meetings, sixteen neighborhoods, including the neighborhood of West Adams, were submitted to the City Council in October 2001 and approved in February 2002.

At that time, the city was directed to install &quot;West Adams&quot; neighborhood signs on Vermont and Western avenues and Adams Boulevard.

West Adams is bounded by the Santa Monica Freeway on the north, Vermont Avenue on the east, Jefferson Boulevard on the south and Western Avenue on the west.

Additionally, the area is marked with large concrete &quot;gateway markers&quot; at Western and Adams and Vermont and Adams.

===&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and other sources===
According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; West Adams is bounded by Figueroa Street on the east, West Boulevard on the west, Pico Boulevard on the north and Jefferson Boulevard on the south. (Previously, the &quot;Times&quot; defined West Adams with a slightly smaller boundary: Vermont Avenue on the east, Crenshaw Boulevard on the west, Venice Boulevard on the north, and Jefferson Boulevard on the south.)

The book &quot;Images of America - West Adams&quot; by Don Lynch, Suzanne Tarbell Cooper, and John Kurtz states that West Adams stretches &quot;roughly from Figueroa Street on the east to West Boulevard on the west, and from Pico Boulevard on the north to Jefferson Boulevard on the south.&quot;

===Areas west of West Adams===
West of West Adams, communities sought to capitalize on their proximity to the &quot;magnificent West Adams district&quot; However, unlike the mansions and large homes east of Crenshaw Boulevard, the homes built in this area were bungalows. They were advertised to people of &quot;moderate means&quot; and were priced to sell for &quot;ten to twenty times&quot; less than homes in West Adams.

In 1911, Carlin Geer Smith, who developed DuRay Place, petitioned the city to annex the &quot;West Adams Extension District&quot;, but the city turned down the application.


* Glen Airy Place - Glen Airy Place was a residential subdivision advertised as &quot;near the fashionable West Adams District&quot;. An official subdivision map gives the boundaries as Adams Street on the north, roughly Mansfield Avenue on the east, Roseland Street on the south and the rear line of properties fronting on Edgewater Street on the west.
* DuRay Place - Located near the intersection of Adams Boulevard and Washington Boulevard, DuRay Place called itself the &quot;Tract of Opportunity&quot;. DuRay Place was &quot;practically adjoining the exclusive West Adams District, where homes are selling at ten to twenty times our prices.&quot;

==Demographics==

In 1985, West Adams was a predominantly &quot;Black middle-class area with growing Latino and Korean segments, plus a mix of Hungarians, Poles, Japanese, USC students and an increasing young professional and gay population.&quot;

In 2007, it was noted that African-American gays were &quot;eschewing the overpriced and completely gentrified territory of West Hollywood&quot; and were instead moving to West Adams.

In 2014, the &quot;Times&quot; stated that &quot;after a recent wave of Latino immigration&quot;, young professionals were purchasing homes in the neighborhoods west of USC, including the &quot;stately Victorian and Craftsman mansions of West Adams&quot; and the &quot;smaller Craftsman bungalows&quot; of Jefferson Park.

According to Mapping L.A., Mexican (29.2%) and Salvadoran (5.7%) were the most common ancestries in 2000. Mexico (37.4%) and El Salvador (25.1%) were the most common foreign places of birth.

<text>Ali Nasir Muhammad Al-Husani (; born 31 December 1939) is a Yemeni former politician and leader of South Yemen who served as Secretary-General of the Yemeni Socialist Party between 1980 and 1986. He was president of South Yemen twice and once the Prime Minister. He served as the Prime Minister from 2 August 1971 until 14 February 1985 and as Chairman of the Presidential Council from 26 June 1978, after the ouster and execution of Salim Rubai Ali, until 27 December 1978. 

In April 1980, South Yemeni president Abdul Fattah Ismail resigned, officially for health reasons, and moved to Moscow. His successor was Ali Nasir Muhammad, who was generally seen as a more pragmatic and moderate leader than his predecessor. Mohammad was less committed to Marxist-Leninist ideology than Ismail and relaxed various socialist policies in the PDRY. His rule was also marked by his moderate approach towards foreign affairs, as evidenced by his less interventionist stance towards both North Yemen and neighbouring Oman and attempts to improve relations with the West. On January 13, 1986, a violent struggle began in Aden between Ali Nasir&#x27;s supporters and supporters of the returned Ismail, the South Yemen Civil War. The fighting lasted for more than a month and resulted in thousands of casualties, Ali Nasir&#x27;s ouster, and Ismail&#x27;s death. Ali Nasir&#x27;s term lasted from 21 April 1980 to 24 January 1986. Some 60,000 people, including the deposed Ali Nasir, fled to North Yemen. He was succeeded by Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas.    

Ali Nasir was a member of the National Front, ar. الجبهة القومية (NF) as well as the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP - الحزب الاشتراكي اليمني) after the YSP was formed from the UPONF in October 1978. During the 1994 Civil War in Yemen, he pushed his supporters to operate alongside the forces of Sana&#x27;a government and against the recently re-established Democratic Republic of Yemen, seeking revenge for his ouster. The southern secession was repressed in July 1994 after the surrender of Aden and Mukalla strongholds.

The former president became an opposition figure in the 2011 Yemeni uprising, being named to a 17-member transitional council intended by some anti-government factions to govern Yemen during a prospective transition from the authoritarian regime led by President Ali Abdullah Saleh to a plural democracy. This council was opposed by the Joint Meeting Parties, the main opposition coalition, which also supported Saleh&#x27;s removal from power and a transition to democracy.

In February 2015, there were media reports that Muhammad was being considered as a prospective interim leader of a &quot;presidential council&quot; after the collapse of the government.

<doc id="1099563" wikidata="Q1070553" url="?curid=1099563" title="Speak (Lindsay Lohan album)">
<text>Speak is the debut studio album by American actress and singer Lindsay Lohan, released on December 7, 2004, by Casablanca Records.

&quot;Speak&quot; was the first high-seller from Casablanca in several years, selling one million copies in the United States. &quot;Speak&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics, with the most sympathetic critics commenting that Lohan &quot;isn&#x27;t a bad singer, but not an extraordinary singer either.&quot; In the United States, &quot;Speak&quot; peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In Germany, &quot;Speak&quot; debuted at number 53 and took four weeks to complete its chart run.

The first two singles from &quot;Speak&quot;, &quot;Rumors&quot; and &quot;Over&quot;, failed to crack the Billboard Hot 100 chart. However, they both did well internationally in countries such as Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom. &quot;Rumors&quot; peaked at number six on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart and also did well in Australia and Germany, where it reached number 14. The accompanying music video for &quot;Rumors&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Pop Video&quot; at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. Both songs received heavy airplay on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. The third and final single, &quot;First&quot;, was released to promote the 2005 film &quot;&quot;. &quot;First&quot; earned small success in Australia and Germany. Lohan promoted the album by performing the singles in a number of live appearances. Plans for a tour in Taiwan were planned, but were later scrapped.

==Background==
Lohan planned on releasing an album in the summer of 2001, according to her official website, llrocks.com. No album was released in 2001, but Lohan had begun recording demo tracks with Emilio Estefan Jr. He and his wife, Gloria, signed Lohan a five-album production deal in September 2002. &quot;I am extremely excited to be working with Emilio. I am surrounded by a group of very talented people whom have made me feel like part of their family&quot;, Lohan said to the press. Also in September, Lohan landed the role as the daughter in Disney&#x27;s 2003 remake of &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;, which required her to learn how to play the guitar and to sing. Lohan recorded a song for the soundtrack, &quot;Ultimate&quot;, which was released to Radio Disney to help promote the film. It peaked at number 18 on Radio Disney&#x27;s Top 30. Lohan announced that the song was separate from her singing career, since many teen idols such as Hilary Duff and Raven-Symoné were expanding their careers from acting to singing.

In 2003, Lohan recorded four songs including a Radio Disney hit, &quot;Drama Queen (That Girl)&quot;, that were released for the soundtrack to the 2004 film &quot;Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen&quot;. Lohan began writing the tracks on her album in April 2004. &quot;I write a lot of lyrics and I&#x27;m involved in the producing process, because it&#x27;s like, if I&#x27;m singing it, I want it to be something that I can relate to&quot;, Lohan said. &quot;I&#x27;m just trying to feel it out and see where it goes. I&#x27;m playing guitar and I also love to dance, so [the music will be] somewhere along the lines of hip-hop and rock.&quot; She had begun working with Diane Warren and Randy Jackson, who were going to help write and produce her album. Warren wrote the song &quot;I Decide&quot; for Lohan, which was originally going to be on her album. 
When Lohan decided not to collaborate with Warren and Jackson, &quot;I Decide&quot; was instead released on the soundtrack to the 2004 film &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; and on Radio Disney.

By 2004, Lohan&#x27;s deal with Emilio Estefan Jr. had been cancelled and Lohan began looking for producers for her album. When asked by MTV about what label she would be working with, Lohan said, &quot;I met with Jive, Universal and I spoke to someone at Bad Boy the other day, which would be kind of cool, but we&#x27;ll see what happens.&quot; In the summer, Lohan revealed that she had signed a deal with Casablanca Records, whose parent company is Universal Music Group. Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks both wrote and produced ten of the tracks, six with Lohan. Cory Rooney produced her first single, &quot;Rumors,&quot; with Taryll and T. J. Jackson, sons of Tito Jackson.

==Recording==

Production on the album and the film were halted on October 21, 2004, when Lohan was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, reportedly for exhaustion and a high fever of 103 degrees. Lohan ended up having a kidney infection and was also in the middle of a family crisis when her father Michael was arrested earlier that year. After staying in the hospital for six days, Lohan was released and returned to set to finish filming the film and recording her album. &quot;I was over-scheduling myself&quot;, Lohan said in her appearance on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s important to say no.&quot; Her album&#x27;s original release date was in November, but was pushed back to December 7 to let Lohan finish recording her album after her hospital stay.

According to Rodney Jerkins, Lohan recorded a track written by him titled &quot;Extraordinary.&quot; The song, which is a rock song, never made it to the final cut of the album. &quot;We&#x27;re just waiting to get into the studio and cut it. I know her schedule is crazy hectic as well as mine. So we&#x27;re going to find that day where we can get it and cut it, probably out here in L.A. or whatever. It should be fun, because she&#x27;s got this whole thing about, you know, this little bad-girl image that everyone&#x27;s trying to put on her, you know what I mean? Basically, the record that we did is basically saying, you know, &#x27;I&#x27;m not ordinary. Bottom line, I&#x27;m different.&#x27;&quot;

==Composition==
&quot;Speak&quot; features different styles of music such as pop rock, dance-pop, arena rock and soft rock ballads. &quot;I wanted to have a mixture like that because I love those kinds of club tracks that you can listen to before you go out at night with all your friends. And I also wanted stuff that was a little bit more rock that you could get into if you were like angry or depressed or sad or that. I wanted to be able to touch upon all those feelings and I wanted to speak about all different things, too, which is why I titled the album &quot;Speak&quot;&quot;, Lohan said in an interview with IGN. The lead single, &quot;Rumors&quot;, has been called a &quot;bass-heavy, angry club anthem&quot; by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

In the opening tracks on the album, Lohan sings about her relationship with her boyfriend, possibly Valderrama. The Madonna-esque title track is about communicating with her boyfriend, while &quot;Magnet&quot; states that she keeps coming back for more from him. IGN said that &quot;Over&quot;, the second single, &quot;begins like a Cure track, complete with mournful acoustic guitar and haunting piano-tuned synth.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;Speak&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. CD Universe said &quot;&#x27;Speak&#x27; proves that Lohan has the mettle and talent necessary to compete with other young pop superstars.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic was very critical of the album, saying it &quot;was recorded quickly and rushed into the stores&quot; such that &quot;the whole thing is a slick, ugly nadir of 2000s pop culture.&quot; He called her music &quot;a blend of old-fashioned, Britney-styled dance-pop and the anthemic, arena rock sound pioneered by fellow tween stars Hilary Duff and Ashlee Simpson. [However,] Lohan stands apart from the pack with her party-ready attitude and her husky voice.&quot;

IGN gave the album a mixed review, stating, &quot;As with her contemporaries—Britney, Christina, Ashlee, Avril, Hilary—it remains to be seen if she will transcend the generic pop princess model and grow into a mature, insightful artist. For now, &quot;Speak&quot; offers up sugar coated, prefab pop that is easily digested, but just as easily forgotten.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also gave the album a C, stating &quot;The &quot;Mean Girls&quot; star&#x27;s debut album has some guilty pleasures: &quot;Rumors&quot; dramatically slams the very stalkerazzi who made her a household name, while the tween-slumber-party-friendly &quot;Over&quot; is perfect for singing into your curling iron in front of the mirror. But somewhere, Avril Lavigne — whose influence is clearly at work here — is rolling her eyes.&quot; &quot;People&quot; music critic Chuck Arnold gave the album a &quot;promising&quot; review, stating that the album is a &quot;competent collection of teen pop.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Speak&quot; debuted at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with first week sales of over 261,000 copies and also marks Lohan’s highest weekly sales. It was certified platinum by the RIAA and has sold over 1,100,000 copies in the United States. To date, the album sold 2.5 million copies worldwide.

==Promotion==
To promote &quot;Speak&quot;, Lohan did several performances in the United States. Lohan appeared on Sessions@AOL on December 2, where she performed &quot;Rumors&quot;, &quot;Over&quot; and &quot;Speak&quot;. Her first televised appearance was on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on December 6, as a part of the Women Rule Concert Series. While she sang &quot;Over&quot; with no problems, her mouth did not move for a second during the performance of &quot;Rumors&quot;. Lohan denied that she was lip synching, claiming that there was a backing track because she had fallen ill recently and that the song had to be enhanced from an electric-pop song to an acoustic version. Kim Jakwerth, of Casablanca Records, supported this statement by saying, &quot;She did not lip-synch. Lindsay sang 100 percent live. Her band played 100 percent live. The background singers were 100 percent live. Yes, on the first song there were background tracks, which were not on the second song.&quot; To further promote the album, Lohan also made appearances on TEENick on December 3, MTV&#x27;s &quot;TRL&quot; on the day of the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot; on December 9, the Z100 Jingle Ball on December 10, and &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on December 13.

On December 14, Lohan performed &quot;Over&quot; and &quot;Speak&quot; at Yahoo&#x27;s Live@Launch, where she also shared an interview. Her second televised appearance was on &quot;The Ellen Show&quot; on December 16, where she performed &quot;Over&quot;. Her third and final televised appearance in promotion for the album was on December 31, where she performed &quot;Rumors&quot; on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Iced Out New Year&#x27;s Eve 2005&quot;. On May 14, 2005, Lohan performed at KIIS-FM&#x27;s Wango Tango. She performed &quot;First&quot; and &quot;Speak&quot;, and shared the bill with other popular performers such as Kelly Clarkson, The Black Eyed Peas and Gwen Stefani. In between songs, Lohan mentioned that this was a rare live performance. In an interview, Lohan mentioned the possibility of touring in Japan: &quot;I start shooting my next movie &quot;Lady Luck&quot; which will come out 2005 as well probably just a little bit later. Then hopefully more singles to come. I&#x27;ll be recording another album by then. Maybe touring in Japan and everywhere. That&#x27;ll be nice.&quot; While she didn&#x27;t tour in Japan, Lohan was scheduled to tour in Taiwan after learning that her album had been certified Gold. &quot;I would love to (tour Taiwan). I haven&#x27;t toured at all at this point, but I would really 
love to do that. It&#x27;s a great feeling to know that people in other places and other countries are aware of my music and what I do&quot;, Lohan told to reporters.

===Singles===

&quot;Rumors&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on September 21, 2004. It peaked at number six on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. Its accompanying music video received heavy airplay on MTV&#x27;s &quot;TRL&quot;. &quot;Rumors&quot; was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) due to strong digital downloads. The song was nominated for &quot;Best Pop Video&quot; at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. &quot;Over&quot; was released as the second single on December 14, 2004. It spent three weeks at number one on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, but was less successful than &quot;Rumors&quot;. &quot;Over&quot; was the first and only single that was released in the United Kingdom. Its music video was also played substantially on &quot;TRL&quot;, before having to be retired. Both received substantial radio airplay.

The album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Speak&quot;, was supposed to be released as the third single. Lohan even promoted the song by playing it at Sessions@AOL. Francis Lawrence was supposed to direct the music video. &quot;First&quot; was released instead on May 10, 2005. It was also the first single released from the &quot;Herbie: Fully Loaded&quot; . &quot;First&quot; became a hit in Latin America and parts of Europe, but was unsuccessful on US charts.

<text>In drama, a protasis is the introductory part of a play, usually its first act. The term was coined by the fourth-century Roman grammarian Aelius Donatus. He defined a play as being made up of three separate parts, the other two being epitasis and catastrophe. In modern dramatic theory the term dramatic arc has substantially the same meaning, though with slightly different divisions.

<text>Lacrimas Profundere is a gothic metal band from Germany. Their name means &quot;to shed tears&quot; in Latin. Their stylistic aesthetic has changed over time; originally a gothic death-doom band, they have simplified their style to a more mainstream gothic rock/metal style with more influences from bands such as HIM, The 69 Eyes, before returning to their heavier gothic doom roots on their 2019 album &quot;Bleeding the Stars&quot;.

==Biography==

Lacrimas Profundere was founded in 1993 by guitarist Oliver Nikolas Schmid. At the time, the band was influenced by doom metal, and also made use of feminine vocals and classical elements. With the entrance of vocalist Anja Hötzendorfer, they drew enough attention to themselves to be able to record their debut, entitled &quot;... and the Wings Embraced Us&quot;, which was released in 1995 and was followed by &quot;La Naissance d’un Rêve&quot; (French for &quot;The Birth of a Dream&quot;), from 1997.

After the said releases, the band was granted a deal with Napalm Records, which included five albums. A harpist was added to the band&#x27;s line-up and they proceeded to record &quot;Memorandum&quot; (1999).

&quot;&quot; from 2001 was Lacrimas Profundere&#x27;s first album to receive attention from the international specialized press. This album featured the removal of the band&#x27;s classical elements to some degree, and was also the first time they employed baritone vocals, supplied by Oliver&#x27;s brother, Christopher Schmid. Their first international tour then began, including countries of Europe and Latin America.

Lacrimas Profundere&#x27;s subsequent albums were &quot;Fall, I Will Follow&quot; from 2002 and &quot;Ave End&quot; from 2004.

&quot;Filthy Notes For Frozen Hearts&quot; received considerable attention from Jackass star Bam Margera and the songs &quot;My Velvet Little Darkness&quot;, &quot;Short Glance&quot;, &quot;Should&quot; and &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; along with a vocal excerpt from &quot;Sad Theme for a Marriage&quot; were played on his show Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union.

In April 2007, Christopher Schmid, the band&#x27;s founding member&#x27;s brother and vocalist left the band; citing prolonged stress from touring. It did not take long to find a new vocalist: Peter Kafka, who also sings for the German band Sonicslave. The former singer Christopher Schmid still takes part of the writing of the new lyrics, however, and has occasionally been seen singing for the band in concerts. A few months later bassist Daniel Lechner left the band and vocalist Peter Kafka became the new bassist. Rob Vitacca employed as the new vocalist, who also sings for the German Rock band Lost. Long time keyboardist Christian Steiner also left the band, but supplied some parts for the new album. &quot;Songs For The Last View&quot; was released in the summer of 2008. This was the first album featuring their new singer, Rob Vitacca.

Lacrimas Profundere&#x27;s, &quot;The Grandiose Nowhere&quot; was released on 30 April 2010. The album spawned two singles &quot;The Letter&quot; and &quot;Lips&quot;. Videos for each song were made; they also toured in places across Asia and South America.

&quot;Antiadore&quot; was released on May 24, 2013, with two music videos for &quot;My Release in Pain&quot; and &quot;Antiadore&quot;, as their last album for the contract with Napalm Records.

In June 2016, Lacrimas Profundere signed with a new label, Oblivion/SPV, whom they collaborated with for the production and distribution of their eleventh studio album, &quot;Hope is Here&quot;, which was released on August 12, 2016. With the release of said album, the band moved slightly away from their classic gothic tendencies, in lieu of a sound resembling more closely that of alternative rock. Following the release of &quot;Hope is Here&quot;, the band toured across Germany and Austria.

In May 2018, Oliver Schmid announced through the bands&#x27; social media and on their website, that Rob Vitacca had decided to leave the band in pursuit of other musical projects, &quot;LACRIMAS just cannot work without complete and constant dedication. And giving such a full-time commitment simply isn&#x27;t possible for Rob anymore.&quot; The band took very little time to find a new vocalist, Julian Larre, who is also a founding member of the Finnish band Lessdmv.

In celebration of 25 years as a band, the band went back to the band&#x27;s roots with a more gothic sound and guttural voices on &quot;Bleeding the Stars&quot;. This was the first album featuring their new vocalist, Julian Larre.

<doc id="1099569" wikidata="Q296276" url="?curid=1099569" title="Silvio Piola">
<text>Silvio Piola (; 29 September 1913 – 4 October 1996) was an Italian footballer who played as a striker. He is known as a highly prominent figure in the history of Italian football due to several records he set, and he is regarded as one of the greatest strikers of his generation, as well as one of the best Italian players of all time. Piola was part of the squad that won the 1933–35 Central European International Cup &amp; the squad that won the 1938 FIFA World Cup with Italy, scoring two goals in the final, ending the tournament as the second-best player and the second highest scorer.

Piola is third in the all-time goalscoring records of the Italy national team. He is also the highest goalscorer in Italian first league history, with 290 goals (274 in Serie A and 16 in Divisione Nazionale), and also in Serie A history. He played 566 Serie A games, putting him fourth on the all-time list for appearances in Italy&#x27;s top flight. Piola is the only player to have the honour of being the all-time Serie A top scorer of three different teams (Pro Vercelli, Lazio and Novara) Piola is also the highest scoring Italian player in all competitions, with 364 goals (391 if his goals in the Divisione Nazionale and for the Italy B team are also included). Throughout his career, including friendlies, Piola scored 682 goals.

After his death, a pair of Italian stadiums were renamed after him: one in Novara in 1997 and another in Vercelli in 1998. In 2011, he was posthumously inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame.

==Club career==
Piola began his career with Italian club side Pro Vercelli, making his Serie A debut against Bologna on 16 February 1930, scoring 13 goals in his first year, at the age of 17. On 29 October 1933, Piola scored six goals, the joint-most goals scored in a single match in Serie A, in a 7–2 win over Fiorentina. He went on to score 51 goals in 127 appearances in Serie A for Pro Vercelli.

In 1934, he moved to Lazio, who had been on the receiving end of his first Serie A goal on 11 November 1930. He was to spend the next nine seasons there. Piola was the Serie A top scorer twice while at Lazio, in 1937 and 1943. Piola was Lazio&#x27;s highest all-time leading goalscorer with 149 goals until it was surpassed in 2021 by Ciro Immobile. After leaving Lazio, he spent war-torn 1944 at Torino, where he scored an amazing 27 goals in just 23 games. Toward the end of the war, he joined Novara. Then, from 1945 to 1947, Piola played for Juventus, before moving back to Novara, where he stayed for seven more seasons.

During his final years with Novara, Piola became the oldest player in Serie A history to score two goals in a single league match, a feat which he managed on 1 February 1953, at the age of 39 years, 4 months and 2 days, against his former team Lazio; the record stood until 20 April 2016, when Francesco Totti scored a Serie A brace at the age of 39 years, 6 months and 23 days.

In his last season in 1953–54, Piola turned 40 years old on 29 September 1953, and then he scored one goal in three consecutive matches in November and December against Sampdoria, Palermo, and Inter Milan, thus becoming the first player to score a Serie A goal after his 40th birthday. He scored his fifth and last goal of the season on 7 February, in a 1–1 draw against AC Milan, and in doing so at the age of 40 years and 129 days, he became the oldest Serie A goalscorer in history, although his record has since been broken by both Alessandro Costacurta in 2007 and Zlatan Ibrahimović in 2023, who both scored a Serie A goal aged 41. With five goals, Piola is the joint-second highest 40-year-old goalsorer in Europe&#x27;s top five leagues, alongside English League&#x27;s Stanley Matthews, and Bundesliga&#x27;s Claudio Pizarro, and only behind Ibrahimović, who scored eight in Serie A. To this day, Piola is still currently the highest all-time goalscorer in Serie A.

==International career==
His first game for Italy came against Austria on 24 March 1935, when he also scored his first goals for the team in the form of a brace to help Italy defeat the hosts Austria 2–0 in the 1933–35 Central European International Cup. He was a World Cup winner in 1938, when he scored two of Italy&#x27;s goals in the 4–2 victory over Hungary; he finished the tournament as the second highest scorer and was named the second-best player, also earning a place in the Team of the Tournament.

Piola went on to play 34 games for Italy and score 30 goals between 1935 and 1952, a tally that would surely have been greater if not for the interruption caused by World War II. He served as the national side&#x27;s captain from 1940 until 1947. In 1939 he scored a goal with his hand to England 47 years before Diego Armando Maradona. His last international appearance was in 1952, when Italy drew 1–1 with England. Piola is currently Italy&#x27;s third highest goalscorer of all-time, behind only Giuseppe Meazza, and Luigi Riva. He also co-holds, with Riva, the national team&#x27;s record for most goals on opposition soil with 13.

==Style of play==
Regarded as one of the greatest strikers of all time, Piola was widely renowned for his goalscoring ability throughout his career, and his eye for goal. He was considered to be a modern and well-rounded player during his time, as he used his physical attributes, intelligence, and control to play with his back to goal, and lay off the ball for teammates in order to provide them with assists. Piola&#x27;s vision, work-rate, and technical ability, as well as his passing ability, made him a tactically versatile player, who was capable of playing in several positions, and he was deployed on the wing, in midfield, or as a creative advanced playmaker or second striker on occasion. Piola particularly excelled as a centre-forward, however; his speed, positional sense, offensive movement, and opportunism enabled him to lose his markers with his attacking runs and receive his team-mates&#x27; deliveries or pounce on loose balls in the area. Piola was also known for his powerful and accurate finishing ability with his head and both feet, from any position on the pitch, which made him a prolific goalscorer throughout his career. Due to his agility and athletic ability, Piola also excelled in the air, and he was capable of scoring spectacular acrobatic goals from volleys and bicycle kicks. Despite his talent and his reputation, he was occasionally accused of diving throughout his career. Unlike his legendary international team-mate, club rival, and friend Giuseppe Meazza, however, with whom he was often compared, Piola was much more reserved both on and off the pitch, and he preferred to score through efficiency and pragmatism rather than flamboyance. On top of his playing ability and prolific goalscoring, Piola also stood out for his longevity throughout his career.

<doc id="1099570" wikidata="Q3152997" url="?curid=1099570" title="Regeneron Science Talent Search">
<text>The Regeneron Science Talent Search, known for its first 57 years as the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, and then as the Intel Science Talent Search (Intel STS) from 1998 through 2016, is a research-based science competition in the United States for high school seniors. It has been referred to as &quot;the nation&#x27;s oldest and most prestigious&quot; science competition. In his speech at the dinner honoring the 1991 Winners, President George H. W. Bush called the competition the &quot;Super Bowl of science.&quot; 

==History==
The Society for Science began the competition in 1942 with Westinghouse Electric Corporation; for many years, the competition was known as the Westinghouse Science Talent Search. In 1998, Intel became the sponsor after it outbid several other companies. In May 2016, it was announced that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals would be the new title sponsor. Over the years, some 147,000 students have entered the competition. Over 22,000 have been named semifinalists and 2,920 have traveled to Washington, D.C., as contest finalists. Collectively, they have received millions of dollars in scholarships and gone on, in later years, to capture Nobel Prizes, Fields Medals, MacArthur Fellowships and numerous other accolades.

Thirteen alumni of the Science Talent Search went on to receive Nobel Prizes, two earned the Fields Medal, eleven have been awarded the National Medal of Science, twenty received MacArthur Fellowships; three have won the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research; seven have won a Breakthrough Prize; and many have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering.

==Competition==
Entrants to the competition conduct original research—sometimes at home and sometimes by working with leading research teams at universities, hospitals and private laboratories. The selection process is highly competitive, and besides the research paper, letters of recommendation, essays, test scores, extracurricular activities, and high school transcripts may be factored in the selection of finalists and winners.

Each year, approximately 2,000 projects are submitted. The top 300 STS Scholars are announced in mid-January and each receive $2,000. In addition to the scholar award money, each scholar’s school receives an award of $2,000 from the title sponsor for each scholar named. In late January, the Top 40 Finalists (the award winners) are announced. In March, the Finalists are flown to Washington, D.C. for a week where they are interviewed by a judging panel about their projects, and to assess the breadth and depth of STEM knowledge, creativity and problem solving abilities. The judges have included Glenn T. Seaborg (Nobel Laureate with Edwin M. McMillan in Chemistry, 1951) and Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr. (Nobel Laureate in Physics, 1993). The Top 40 Finalists receive awards of at least $25,000 and the winners are announced at an awards ceremony in Washington, D.C.

==Demography==
The Science Talent Search is open to high school seniors living in the United States. Since the beginning of the competition, a large number of winners have come from New York, representing nearly one-third of the finalists in the years that Westinghouse sponsored the competition. New York has continued to lead the states in finalists in more recent years, more closely followed by California, and with significant numbers of finalists from Maryland, Texas, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Florida, Virginia, and Illinois. 

Certain high schools have been particularly successful at placing semifinalists and finalists in the Science Talent Search. From the early years of the competition, two specialized high schools in New York City dominated the competition: Bronx High School of Science and Stuyvesant High School. Other New York schools have also had notable success in the competition, including Ward Melville High School in East Setauket, Byram Hills High School in Armonk, Jericho High School in Jericho, and Paul D. Schreiber Senior High School in Port Washington. In the 1980s and 1990s, other specialized STEM schools, including Virginia&#x27;s Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology and Maryland&#x27;s Montgomery Blair High School, began to produce large numbers of finalists to rival the New York schools. In the 21st century, a new group of specialized STEM schools have had growing success in the competition, including New Jersey&#x27;s Bergen County Academies, and the private Harker School in California.

<doc id="1099602" wikidata="Q3153255" url="?curid=1099602" title="International Financial Services Centre, Dublin">
<text>The International Financial Services Centre (IFSC; ) is an area of central Dublin and part of the CBD established in the 1980s as an urban regeneration area and special economic zone (SEZ) on the derelict state-owned former port authority lands of the reclaimed North Wall and George&#x27;s Dock areas of the Dublin Docklands. The term has become a metonym for the Irish financial services industry as well as being used as an address and still being classified as an SEZ.

It officially began in 1987 as an SEZ on an docklands site in central Dublin, with EU approval to apply a 10% corporate tax rate for &quot;designated financial services activities&quot;. Before the expiry of this EU approval in 2005, the Irish Government legislated to effectively have a national flat rate by reducing the overall Irish corporate tax rate from 32% to 12.5% which was introduced in 2003.

An additional primary goal of the IFSC was to assist the urban renewal and development programme of the North Wall area as a result of its dereliction following the advent of containerisation in the 1960s. Following a period of successful regeneration the Section 23 Relief and other schemes ceased accepting new entrants from 1999.

The original 11-hectare IFSC site has gone through several expansions to become a area by 2018 which is now a major European financial centre. By merging with the Spencer Dock and Grand Canal Dock area, the IFSC is now considered to be an &quot;International Services Centre&quot;, covering a broader range than being purely financial. The creation and development of the IFSC is considered to be an important part of Ireland&#x27;s economic growth story.

==Location==

The original &quot;IFSC 1&quot; (development of the site from 1987 to 1997 under the Custom House Docks Development Authority &quot;CHDDA&quot;) comprises the area between Memorial Road, Amiens Street, Lower Sheriff Street (including part of Crinan Strand), Guild Street, and the River Liffey along North Wall Quay and Custom House Quay. Adjacent districts include East Wall to the north and Spencer Dock to the east; the Custom House, Busáras and the city centre lie to the west along Store Street and Abbey Street. Within the IFSC, the original development area lies west of Commons Street.
East of Commons Street is the later &quot;IFSC 2&quot; expansion (development of an additional from 1997 to 2007 under the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) which runs along North Wall Quay and Lower Mayor Street. It is an integrated development located in the centre of the city which incorporates office accommodation, educational institutions, housing, restaurants and shopping facilities including the Dublin Landings development.

East of Guild Street down as far as the Point Depot is the final part of the IFSC (Docklands Strategic Development Zone, created by Dublin City Council (&quot;DCC&quot;) on the dissolution of the DDDA in 2012), as an area containing the Central Bank of Ireland as well the offices of PwC, Credit Suisse and numerous technology companies including Yahoo and WeWork. This was further expanded by DCC in 2015 into a larger special economic zone (&quot;SEZ&quot;) to include the full of North Lotts and Grand Canal Docks sites, taking in both financial and technology services companies. Only the area within the North Wall part of the original IFSC includes IFSC as part of a postal address.

==History==
The concept of a low tax international financial service centre is attributed to Irish businessman Dermot Desmond and politician Ruairi Quinn among others, whose ideas were later picked up by Fianna Fáil leader Charles Haughey and incorporated into his 1987 election manifesto (with contributions from AIB CEO Michael Buckley). Despite resistance from the Department of Finance (concerned about the impact on domestic tax revenues), Haughey overruled and got permission from the EU to create a special 10% tax incentive zone (the IFSC), in the 1987 Finance Act (Section 30).
The CHDDA had earlier been created under the auspices of the Garret FitzGerald lead Fine Gael-Labour minority government as a Special Purpose Agency (SPA) in November 1986. The physical manifestation of the IFSC began with the construction of three offices - The International Centre, IFSC House and La Touche House, all with distinctive green colouring. To operate in the IFSC and access the 10% tax rate, companies had to be approved by the Certification Advisory Committee (CAC), composed of representatives from the Irish Development Authority, the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Central Bank of Ireland.

The next major event was the &quot;Irish Taxes and Consolidated Act, 1997 (TCA)&quot; which upgraded the legal and tax structures in the IFSC, and in particular created the &quot; Irish section 110 SPV&quot; and laid the foundations for the Double Irish, Single Malt and the Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets BEPS tools. In addition, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was set up to oversee the expansion of the IFSC&#x27;s site (most notable being the reclamation of the Grand Canal Basin site)

The &quot;dual structure&quot; Irish corporate tax rate, came under pressure from the EC (due to competition rules), and it was agreed that it would expire in 2005. In advance of this deadline, the Irish Government in the 1998/1999 Finance Acts introduced a lower 12.5% corporate tax rate for the entire country which was fully introduced from 1 January 2003, and by 1 January 2006, all remaining IFSC companies (some held their old licenses) were on a 12.5% rate. The IFSC ceased to exist as a required legal entity.

The next major event was the Irish financial crisis from 2008 to 2013. The IFSC was a major EU securitisation hub and the effect of billion euro special purpose vehicles (or SPVs) collapsing added to the concern over Ireland&#x27;s financial position. It did not help that these SPVs (and other IFSC type activities) produced a further distorted picture of Ireland&#x27;s already precarious National Accounts statistics. The sudden drop in Dublin&#x27;s ranking on the Global Financial Centres Index (&quot;GFCI&quot;) from an all-time high of 10th in March 2009 (GFCI 5), to 23rd by September 2009 (GFCI 6), sparked a formal investigation.

A tightening by the Irish regulator (after a period of loose regulation) which followed the Irish financial crisis led some financial institutions to move operations elsewhere (as well as others who were exited) and caused Dublin&#x27;s GFCI ranking as a financial services centre to drop further to 70th in 2014 (GFI 16). IFSC institutions cited the timeliness of decisions by the Central Bank of Ireland as having an impact on their operations. Since 2014 however, the IFSC has started to recover, rising to 31 in the 2016 GCFI 21 ranking.

The IFSC Securitisation Sector produced a major domestic scandal when it was revealed in mid-2016 that US Distressed Debt funds (pejoratively called &quot;vulture funds&quot;) had been using the Irish Section 110 SPV to avoid all Irish taxes on their Irish domestic investments. The Irish Government closed the &quot;loopholes&quot; but it was estimated that the loss in Irish tax revenues to the Irish exchequer runs to billions of euros (exceeding the value the securitisation sector ever delivered to Ireland). Discussed further in vulture fund Irish tax avoidance.

The IFSC Securitisation Sector was further pressured when it was revealed in 2018 that Russian banks (some under EU and US sanctions) had also been using the Irish Section 110 SPV to funnel over €100bn through the IFSC. Further academic studies showed that the IFSC SPV sector was operating in an almost unregulated fashion where structures were more akin to brass plate companies. Other former Central Bank of Ireland regulators also publicly highlighted their concerns. Discussed further in unregulated shadow banking.

==Financial sectors==
A 2015 Irish Government IFS 2020 Strategy Paper, lists the Irish financial services sector as comprising over 400 companies, employing over 35,000 people (one third outside Dublin), with over €3.2 trillion in funds under administration, providing €2bn in taxes and €2.3bn in wages and salaries. KMPG estimate the IFSC constitutes 7% of Irish GDP. The IFSC has now become one of Europe&#x27;s most important centres for , and , and ultimately became the birthplace of and global leader in .

Some of the largest offices in the IFSC are those of the major Irish accounting and law firms. They have become associated with the creation and development of international tax management tools, (such as the Double Irish, single malt, and capital allowances for intangible assets (CAIA) BEPS tools; and Section 110 SPV, QIAIF and ICAV zero-tax legal structures), leading to concerns of Ireland as a tax haven. In 2017, a University of Amsterdam study estimated that the IFSC was one of the world&#x27;s largest conduit OFCs for facilitating global corporate tax avoidance. In 2018, a Gabriel Zucman study estimated that Ireland had become the world&#x27;s largest corporate tax haven by virtue of its use as a Conduit OFC.

Some of the main sectors of financial services activity carried out in the IFSC are outlined below:

===Fund administration and domiciling===

The original proposal for the IFSC was that it would become a location for high-margin activities such as investment management, banking and securities trading given its low tax rate and proximity to the major centres of London and Paris. However, ultimately few of these companies established offices which offered these services or relocated to Dublin in the following years and while the level of material employment has grown significantly relative to its former size, it is still well below many of the larger European financial centres in overall terms such as Frankfurt, London or Paris. Many of the notable fund and investment managers are dealing mostly with domestic businesses e.g. - Irish Life and Bank of Ireland and many of the examples mentioned in the media outlets relate to fund domiciling, custody, treasury and more recently trading rather than investment management and investment banking.

Classic fund administration (i.e. fund accounting, fund administration, fund custody and transfer agency) is the largest employer in IFSC making up almost a third of IFSC jobs and totaling almost 9,274 jobs at the last reliable study. The four largest global fund administration and custody providers all have major offices in the IFSC State Street, BNY Mellon, Citibank and Northern Trust, as well as internal fund administration departments from major global investment banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.

Fund domiciling (and distribution) is where specialist law firms, and specialist administration departments of investment firms (i.e. BlackRock, Citibank, Deutsche Bank), provide legal (i.e. creating fund prospectus, fund listing documents etc.) and other professional services (i.e. fund trustees, fund audit etc.) to Irish domiciled, and often Irish listed, fund structures in various Irish legal fund &quot;wrappers&quot; (incl. UCITs, QIAIFs, MMFs and AIFs). The IFSC is one of the largest and fastest growing locations for UCITS in Europe.

The trade body for the IFSC fund administration and domiciling sector is the Irish Funds (Industry) Association (previously Dublin Funds Industry Association, or &quot;DIMA&quot;).

===Securitisation===

The introduction of the Irish Section 110 SPV in 1997, described by PwC as the &quot;heart of the Irish structured finance regime&quot;, enabled the IFSC become the largest provider of SPVs in the EU securitisation market, and has made Ireland the 4th largest shadow banking centre in the world. While Irish securitisation SPVs pay no effective Irish corporate taxes (SPVs are deliberately structured in this way), they are estimated to contribute over €100m annually to the Irish Economy from fees paid to local Irish professional services firms (legal, accounting and corporate services providers) who create and administer the SPVs. The sector was involved in a major domestic tax scandal in 2017.

Sometimes the securitisation sector is merged with the fund administration sector when &quot;total funds administered&quot; data is quoted for the IFSC (or IFS sector).

The trade body for the IFSC Securitisation sector is the Irish Debt Securities Association (IDSA), which was founded by IFSC law firm, Matheson.

===Banking===
Some of the world&#x27;s largest banks have offices in the IFSC. Their focus is mainly on administration support for securitisation and structured finance activities, aircraft leasing activities, or conducting in-house corporate treasury and fund administration functions for their parent. There are few examples of foreign banks conducting higher margin asset management, investment banking or corporate finance from their IFSC platform (instead usually favouring their bases in London, Paris, Frankfurt or Luxembourg in Europe).

The trade body for the IFSC and non-IFSC banking sector is the Irish Banking Federation.

===Insurance===

The main insurance activities cover life insurance, general insurance, reinsurance and captive insurance. There is little insurance risk originated or underwritten in the IFSC and London remains the primary global base for these activities. The only remaining listed Irish insurance company is FBD Holdings which is one of the smaller players in the Irish insurance market. The IFSC occasionally provides an accounting and administration service for products sold on a pan-EU basis through the parent&#x27;s main channels. The IFSC has a niche strength as a top location in the relatively small Captive Insurance market.

The trade body for the IFSC Insurance sector is the Dublin International Insurance &amp; Management Association (DIMA).

===Aircraft leasing===
The IFSC is the largest aircraft leasing hub in the world with 14 of the top 15 aircraft lessors headquartered in Ireland (including AerCap, GECAS, SMBC and Avolon) and circa 50% of the world&#x27;s fleet of leased aircraft is managed through IFSC companies. Unlike some other IFSC sectors, the Aircraft Leasing sector includes high margin activities such as origination and financing as well as accounting and administration. While the sector employs around 5,000 people (1,700 directly) (versus Fund Administration at almost 10,000 jobs), and pays less than €40m in Irish corporate tax it is estimated to provide over €500m annually to the Irish Economy (from salaries and fees) making it one of the most valuable sectors in the IFSC. In May 2019, figures from the Department of Finance showed that since 2012, the net assets of the aircraft leasing industry in Ireland was close to zero (€141 billion in Irish domiciled aircraft assets offset by €141 billion in offshore financing); and that the aircraft leasing industry paid only €54 million in Irish corporation tax in 2018. The average salary of employees in the aircraft leasing sector is estimate to be in the region of €165,000.

The closest related trade body for the IFSC Aircraft Leasing sector is the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) (not exclusively IFSC focused). Aircraft Leasing Ireland (ALI) also represents the sector and is a constituent part of Financial Services Ireland (FSI) and ultimately of Ibec.

===Corporate treasury===
The corporate treasury sector primarily consists of small IFSC subsidiaries of large non-financial multi-national services organisations (e.g. Pfizer, Xerox), which serve as a hub for in-house treasury functions (i.e. cash pooling, fx hedging), for their global parent and sometimes serving as shared services centres serving multiple locations and functions (providing administration and bookkeeping functions). The level of Irish corporation tax paid by these hubs is close to €200m per annum, making it more valuable to the Irish Economy than the higher-profile IFSC Securitisation sector.

===Payments processing===
This is a more diverse sector that covers classic payments companies (US credit card processing companies like Visa and MasterCard), internet and fintech payments companies (i.e. PayPal, Stripe), and other niche payment processors (i.e. Fexco, TransferMate, Realex Payments, Prepaid Financial Services). The attraction is Ireland&#x27;s beneficial tax regime for contract manufacturing (previously developed for the pharmaceutical sector in Ireland) which makes Ireland a low / zero tax centre for handling payments.

The closest trade body for the IFSC Payments sector is the Fintech Payments Association of Ireland (FPAI) (not exclusively IFSC focused).

===Private equity and venture capital===
Private equity and private credit firms with offices and investment professionals in Ireland are mainly operated and funded by large American private equity organisations such as KKR, Carlyle Group and Oaktree Capital Management. Additionally, investments and acquisitions are also made by non-domestic firms such as Brookfield Asset Management&#x27;s €120M takeover of Imagine Communications, Insight Partner&#x27;s purchase of a €100m stake in the AMCS Group (in conjunction with the ISIF) and Apollo&#x27;s takeover of Ireland&#x27;s largest hotel chain Tifco in a €600m deal in 2018.

Domestic private equity firms include Renatus and most notably Causeway Capital who were responsible for the rescue of Patisserie Valerie in February 2019.

The trade body for the private equity and venture capital industry is the Irish Venture Capital Association (IVCA).

==Technology expansion==
The 2015 IFSC III phase saw the &quot;financial&quot; IFSC merge with the neighbouring Grand Canal Dock and Dublin Docklands areas; comprising major offices of global technology multinationals including Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Since the 2015 expansion, the term &quot;International Services Centre&quot; (ISC) is sometimes used.

Some of the biggest offices in the IFSC are the law firms (e.g. Matheson, A&amp;L Goodbody, McCann Fitzgerald, and William Fry), and accounting firms (e.g. PwC, KPMG, Deloitte, and EY), who advise both the financial multinationals and technology multinationals, operating in the Greater Dublin Area.

The legal structures created by IFSC law and accounting firms for securitization (e.g. Section 110 SPVs, and QIAIFs), became important to the tax structuring of US technology firms in the IFSC. Such structures are part of a suite of base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) tools that enable US technology firms to achieve an effective tax rate (ETR) of under 4% on all non-US global profits &quot;shifted&quot; to Ireland (see here). PwC Ireland managing partner, Feargal O&#x27;Rourke, was credited as creating the Double Irish BEPS tool, while Matheson have also been identified an important developer of US tax structures in Ireland.

With the closure of the Double Irish arrangement in 2020, the most important BEPS tool in the IFSC is the Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets (CAIA) BEPS tool. Apple used the CAIA BEPS tool in Q1 2015 to execute the largest BEPS action in history, causing the Leprechaun economics revision of Irish GDP data.

IFSC tax law firms market the sub–2.5% Irish effective tax rates that the CAIA BEPS tool can deliver for technology multinationals in the IFSC, on all their worldwide income that is &quot;shifted&quot; to Ireland. In 2018, the European Parliament GUE/NGL group called the CAIA tool, the &quot;Green Jersey&quot; BEPS tool.

The CAIA BEPS tool requires multinationals to create virtual internal intellectual property (IP) assets in offshore locations (e.g. Apple used Jersey). These virtual IP assets are purchased, via intergroup loans, by the Irish subsidiary. The CAIA tool allows the Irish subsidiary to write-off this intergroup purchase against future Irish taxes. An internationally reputable accounting firm is needed to stand over the &quot;valuation&quot; of the virtual group IP asset in the multinational&#x27;s GAAP accounts.

==Global ranking==

===GFCI ranking (2007–2019)===

The IFSC, classed as &quot;Dublin&quot;, appears in the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI), a ranking of the competitiveness of over 100 global financial centres based on over 29,000 financial centre assessments from an online questionnaire together with over 100 indices from organisations such as the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Economist Intelligence Unit. The index was started in 2007 and is published twice a year; the IFSC (or Dublin) reached a high of ninth in GFCI6, and a low of 73rd in GFCI16.
=== Xinhua–Dow Jones Index (2010–2014)===

The Xinhua–Dow Jones International Financial Centers Development Index (IFCD) was a ranking of circa 45 major global financial centres, and was compiled annually by the Xinhua News Agency of China with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Dow Jones &amp; Company of the United States from 2010 to 2014; the IFSC (or Dublin) ranked 37th overall of 45 centres in the final 2014 IFCD Index.

==Tax haven concerns==

IFSC growth is closely related to concern regarding tax issues, and Ireland as a tax haven, estimated in 2018 by academics to be the world&#x27;s largest tax haven. The role that the major IFSC accounting and IFSC law firms have played in creating Irish tax haven-type legal structures, including Double Irish, Single malt, and Capital allowances for intangible assets (CAIA) BEPS tools, as well as Section 110 SPV, QIAIF and ICAV zero-tax legal structures, has been chronicled.

For example, PwC Ireland, one of the largest professional services firms in the IFSC, was identified in 2013 by Bloomberg as the &quot;great architect&quot; of the Double Irish arrangement, the largest known legal tax avoidance structure in history, responsible shielding over US$100 billion annually from taxation.

In addition, Matheson, who state that they have the largest corporate tax group of all IFSC law firms, was identified in 2013 by the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; as the headquarters of 125 major US multi-nationals seeking to benefit from the Irish tax system, and avoid US corporate taxes.

The IFSC&#x27;s reputation as a global centre of tax haven activities, has seen several of the &quot;offshore magic circle&quot; law firms set up in offices in the IFSC.

IFSC firms have also been associated with helping foreign firms avoid Irish taxes on Irish assets. In 2016, it was discovered US distressed debt funds used IFSC Section 110 securitization vehicles to avoid Irish taxes on their Irish investments (see vulture fund Irish tax avoidance), supported by IFSC law and accounting firms, It was estimated these US distressed funds would avoid €20 billion in Irish taxes from 2016 to 2026 on circa €40 billion of Irish investments made from 2012 to 2016 (which represented circa €80 billion in headline Irish loan balances). Matheson was exposed as using children&#x27;s charities to hide their client&#x27;s Section 110 SPVs.

The IFSC&#x27;s growth has led to Ireland&#x27;s rise in global league tables of tax havens, and seen Ireland &quot;black listed&quot; by countries such as Brazil.

There is evidence IFSC SPVs are used for circumvention of global sanctions, tax avoidance, and money laundering.

Research in 2017–2018 by Trinity College Dublin finance Professor Jim Stewart, and Cillian Doyle, showed many IFSC SPVs are unregulated brass plate structures attracting little oversight by the Revenue Commissioners or Central Bank of Ireland, and with local individuals holding hundreds of SPV directorships. The International Monetary Fund (&quot;IMF&quot;) has noted the same concern regarding governance of IFSC SPVs (and FCVs). In 2018, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland stated that the risks from abuses of IFSC SPVs was not fully appreciated by the Irish Government.

<text>Joel Surnow (born December 18, 1955) is an American television writer and producer. He is the co-creator of the action series &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot; and &quot;24&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Joel Surnow is of Jewish descent. He was raised in Michigan and later Los Angeles. Surnow attended the University of California, Berkeley for two years, and eventually graduated from UCLA film school in 1976.

Soon after graduation, he began writing for film; he then switched to television. His breakthrough came when he began writing for &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, in 1984. By the end of the year, Universal Studios, which owned the show, assigned Surnow to &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, as Supervising Producer, about a CIA officer turned vigilante.

He has five daughters, two from a previous marriage and three with his current wife.

Surnow was the co-creator and executive producer of the 1997–2001 television series &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, which was the top-rated drama on basic cable its first two seasons. In addition to being Supervising Producer and writing for &quot;The Equalizer&quot; and serving as executive story editor on the first season of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, he has written scripts for a number of other TV series, including &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; and &quot;Wiseguy&quot;.

Following &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, Surnow&#x27;s most successful work was on the TV series &quot;24&quot;, which he co-created and also executive produced with Robert Cochran. In 2006, &quot;24&quot; won Emmy awards for Outstanding Drama Series, accepted by Surnow and his fellow producers, including Robert Cochran, and Outstanding Lead Actor Kiefer Sutherland, who also won a Golden Globe. Surnow and Cochran had previously won an Emmy for &quot;24&quot; in 2002, for their writing of the series&#x27; pilot episode. Surnow quit his role as executive producer of the series on February 12, 2008. His production company was Real Time Productions. In 2006, the duo made partnership with Howard Gordon, another &quot;24&quot; producer to develop projects at Fox under his Real Time Productions company.

Surnow also created &quot;The 1/2 Hour News Hour&quot;, a comedy show described by Surnow as &quot;&quot;The Daily Show&quot; for conservatives&quot;. The first episode aired on February 18, 2007, receiving poor reviews. Although the initial ratings were very good, subsequent ratings dropped dramatically. The show was canceled six months later, after airing only seven episodes.,

Also in 2007, Surnow teamed up with Six Flags to create &quot;Operation SpyGirl&quot;, a stunt show made exclusively for Six Flags Great America in association with Asylum Entertainment. The show followed the story of SpyGirl as she attempted to save Gurnee, Illinois (the park&#x27;s location) from the evil Max Condor in just 24 minutes. Prior to the show&#x27;s opening, Six Flags had plans to bring the &quot;Operation SpyGirl&quot; brand to some of its other parks including the now-cancelled Six Flags Dubailand, as well as a possible extension of the IP to television or film, but those plans were canceled once the show proved to be a failure with guests.

Joel made his directorial debut with &quot;Small Time&quot;; it was released by Freestyle Releasing on April 18, 2014.

== Personal life ==
Surnow identifies as politically conservative and has spoken about being a political minority in Hollywood. His second wife is Catholic and they sent their three daughters to Catholic schools. He has stated, &quot;I decided I liked Catholics. They&#x27;re so grounded. I sort of reoriented myself&quot;.

<text>Mount Cory is a mountain located in the Bow River Valley in southeast Banff National Park, just north of Banff, Alberta, Canada. The mountain was named in 1923 after William Wallace Cory, deputy minister of the Interior from 1905 to 1930.

==The &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot;==
The gaping &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot; cave is located in the upper portion of the western side of Mount Cory. The cave is a landmark easily viewed from the nearby Trans-Canada Highway. The formation is natural, despite the seemingly regular pentagonal shape of its entrance as seen from a distance. The cave is about 60 feet high and 100 feet deep and has often been visited by climbers. 

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Cory is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below -20 °C with wind chill factors below -30 °C.

<doc id="1099640" wikidata="Q5531523" url="?curid=1099640" title="Gene Weingarten">
<text>Gene Norman Weingarten is an American journalist, and former syndicated humor columnist for &quot;The Washington Post.&quot; He is the only two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Weingarten is known for both his serious and humorous work. Through September 2021, Weingarten&#x27;s column, &quot;Below the Beltway,&quot; was published weekly in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; magazine and syndicated nationally by The Washington Post Writers Group. Weingarten and his son Dan also write &quot;Barney &amp; Clyde,&quot; a comic strip with illustrations by David Clark.

== Early life and education ==
Gene Norman Weingarten was born in New York City. He grew up in the southwest Bronx, the son of an accountant who worked as an Internal Revenue Service agent and a schoolteacher. In 1968, Weingarten graduated from The Bronx High School of Science and attended New York University, where he started as a pre-med student but ended up majoring in psychology. He was editor of the NYU daily student newspaper, &quot;The Heights Daily News.&quot; Weingarten left college three credits short of a degree.

== Career ==
In 1972, while still in college, Weingarten&#x27;s story about gangs in the South Bronx was published as a cover story in &quot;New York Magazine.&quot;

Weingarten&#x27;s first newspaper job was with the Albany, New York, &quot;Knickerbocker News,&quot; an afternoon daily.

In 1977, he went to work at the &quot;Detroit Free Press.&quot; Weingarten then moved back to New York City to work at &quot;The National Law Journal.&quot;

From 1981 to 1990, Weingarten was editor of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; Sunday magazine, &quot;Tropic.&quot; In 1984, he hired Dave Barry, giving one of America&#x27;s best-known humor columnists his big break. &quot;Tropic&quot; won two Pulitzer Prizes, including Barry&#x27;s, during Weingarten&#x27;s tenure. In 1984 he created the Herald Hunt, along with Barry and his later editor at the Washington Post, Tom Shroder, whom he referred to frequently in his online chats as &quot;Tom the Butcher&quot;.

=== &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ===
In 1990, Weingarten was hired by &quot;The Washington Post.&quot;

Weingarten wrote &quot;Below the Beltway,&quot; a weekly humor column for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that was nationally syndicated. Illustrator Eric Shansby contributed drawings to the column, which has been a long-term collaboration over 10 years.

Weingarten created and, until 2003, edited The Style Invitational humor contest for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. As part of the contest, he often hid his connection to the Invitational, using the pseudonym &quot;The Czar.&quot; However, Weingarten admitted responsibility in 1999, writing, &quot;I run a reader-participation contest every Sunday in &quot;The Post&quot;. It is called The Style Invitational.&quot; He claimed credit again in 2001, acknowledging that he was editor of The Style Invitational.

In 2005, one of Weingarten&#x27;s in-house critiques was leaked online, where he said &quot;The Post&quot; was suffering a failure of imagination. Selected passages were later re-posted on his column.

Weingarten hosted a popular &quot;Washington Post&quot; online chat called &quot;Chatological Humor,&quot; formerly known as &quot;Tuesdays with Moron.&quot; Common topics in his online chat include the art of comic strips, analysis of humor, politics, philosophy, medicine, and gender differences. Many of his columns addressing gender differences have been written in a he-said, she-said style in collaboration with humorist Gina Barreca, his co-author for &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot;. It was during one of these chats he coined the phrase &quot;Marrying Irving.&quot;. His last chat at the &quot;Post&quot; was November 3, 2020, where he revealed that Chatalogical Humor had been cancelled, partially or wholly due to his public criticism of the &quot;Post&quot;″s rollout of their new online chat software the previous week.

In 2007, for one of his &quot;Below the Beltway&quot; columns, he humorously enhanced his Wikipedia entry until he was caught and the edits reverted.

In his live online chat on June 22, 2009, Weingarten disclosed that he had accepted a buyout offer from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, which meant he was retiring as a longer-form feature writer. The frequency of his online chat was reduced from weekly to monthly. His column continued under a contract with &quot;The Post&quot;, but he stopped contributing feature-length articles. , he was semi-retired from the paper, working on other projects.

In the September 26, 2021 &quot;Washington Post Magazine&quot;, he wrote his last humor column titled “The Short Goodbye.”, and in a followup comment, stated that he was not retiring, just discontinuing his regular column. However, Weingarten announced via Twitter on December 8, 2021, that he and the &quot;Post&quot; could not come to terms on a new contract, and he was no longer writing for them. His final story was &quot;A Dog’s Life: Why are so many people so cruel to their dogs? My search to understand a hidden scourge&quot;.

=== &quot;The Hypochondriac&#x27;s Guide To Life. And Death&quot; ===
Weingarten is a self-acknowledged hypochondriac. He was diagnosed with what was then a near-fatal infection of Hepatitis C, which led to the publication his first book, 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Hypochondriac&#x27;s Guide To Life. And Death.&quot;

=== &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid: One Man, One Woman&quot; ===
Weingarten co-wrote a series of humor columns in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; with feminist writer Gina Barreca about the differences between men and women. These became the basis of the 2004 book she and Weingarten collaborated on called &quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid: One Man. One Woman. 10,000 Years Of Misunderstandings Between The Sexes Cleared Right Up.&quot; The two wrote for over two years via email and on the phone without having met in person. They eventually met for the first time while doing publicity for the book. The book is illustrated by cartoonist Richard Thompson.

=== &quot;Old Dogs: Are the Best Dogs&quot; ===
In fall of 2008, Weingarten published &quot;Old Dogs: Are the Best Dogs&quot; in collaboration with photographer Michael S. Williamson. Together they profiled and photographed 63 dogs between the ages of 10 and 17 years old over the course of two and a half years. In response to the inevitable question of which dogs remained alive, Weingarten has asserted that the answer will always be &quot;all of them.&quot; Weingarten&#x27;s inspiration for &quot;Old Dogs&quot; came shortly after the death of his dog, Harry S Truman, who is also featured in the book.

=== &quot;Barney &amp; Clyde&quot; ===
In June 2010, Weingarten and his son Dan began publishing the syndicated comic strip &quot;Barney &amp; Clyde&quot;, illustrated by David Clark. The comic is about the friendship between billionaire, J. Barnard Pillsbury, and a homeless man named Clyde Finster. The comic took over five years to develop, with the &quot;Miami Herald,&quot; &quot;The Washington Post,&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; early supporters.

=== &quot;Me &amp; Dog&quot; ===
In September 2014, Weingarten published &quot;Me &amp; Dog&quot;, a picture book, in collaboration with illustrator Eric Shansby. The book is about a young boy Sid and his dog, Murphy. It is said to be the first atheist-themed children&#x27;s book. Weingarten said he wrote the book in response to the lack of literature geared towards children and atheism − and a counterbalance to the prevalence of books like &quot;Heaven Is for Real.&quot;

=== &quot;One Day&quot; ===

In October 2019 Weingarten published &quot;One Day&quot;, an exhaustive look into a random day in American history. The date was chosen by children picking numbers out of a hat: It was December 28, 1986. The premise was that if you dig deeply enough, there is no such thing as an ordinary day. In 2019, it was ranked by &quot;Slate&quot; as one of the 50 best nonfiction books of the past 25 years.

=== &quot;Substack&quot; ===
In January 2023, Gene resumed his chat (now three times a week, on Tuesdays,Thursdays and Saturdays) on the Substack publishing website, now entitled &quot;The Gene Pool&quot;. It is free to read, but participation requires a subscription ($50 per year).

== Other work ==
Weingarten has written three screenplays, one in collaboration with humorist Dave Barry and two in collaboration with David Simon, including &quot;B Major,&quot; about a piano marathon conducted in Scranton in 1970. None of the screenplays has yet been produced.

== Reception ==

=== Awards ===
From 1987 to 1988, Weingarten was a fellow at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University.

In 2006, Weingarten won the Missouri Lifestyle Journalism Award for Multicultural Journalism for his Washington Post Magazine feature article &quot;Snowbound.&quot;

In 2008, Weingarten was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for his &quot;Washington Post&quot; story, &quot;Pearls Before Breakfast,&quot; &quot;his chronicling of a world-class violinist (Joshua Bell) who, as an experiment, played beautiful music in a subway station filled with unheeding commuters.&quot; The night Weingarten returned from accepting his Pulitzer Prize, he received an email from a librarian named Paul Musgrave from the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, who told him that he had recently seen an article about a similar experiment that the &quot;Chicago Evening Post&quot; did in May 1930 where they had the virtuoso Jacques Gordon play his Stradivarius violin outside a subway station to see if commuters would notice the music. The article, entitled &quot;Famous Fiddler in Disguise Gets $5.61 in Curb Concerts,&quot; showed commuters displaying the same disinterest as Weingarten described in his article. It turns out Joshua Bell had owned that same Stradivarius violin for over 10 years.

In 2010, Weingarten was awarded a second Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for his &quot;Washington Post&quot; story, &quot;Fatal Distraction,&quot; &quot;his haunting story about parents, from varying walks of life, who accidentally kill their children by forgetting them in cars.&quot; Weingarten said he had a lucky break when his daughter was younger when he almost left her behind in the car when they lived in Florida.

In 2014, Weingarten was awarded the National Society of Newspaper Columnists&#x27; Ernie Pyle Lifetime Achievement Award.

=== Indian food remarks ===
On August 19, 2021, Weingarten published a column in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; of foods he dislikes, including hazelnuts, sweet pickles, and &quot;Indian food&quot;, which he described as &quot;the only ethnic cuisine in the world based entirely on one spice.&quot; Padma Lakshmi criticized Weingarten and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; for publishing content with racist undertones. Celebrities of South Asian descent Meena Harris, Mindy Kaling and Salman Rushdie also publicly criticized the piece. On August 23, the &quot;Post&quot; added a correction to the article which clarified, &quot;India’s vastly diverse cuisines use many spice blends and include many other types of dishes.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Weingarten has lived in many places on the East Coast. His first residence in the Washington D.C. area was in Bethesda, Maryland. Since 2001 he has lived in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C., with his wife, Arlene Reidy, an attorney, but in a column published August 10, 2017, announced that the marriage had collapsed. He has since made several references to a girlfriend in online chats, and at least one column, and in his chat of June 2, 2019, revealed that his girlfriend was Rachel Manteuffel, a 36-year-old editor and fellow writer for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. He has two children, Molly Weingarten, a veterinarian, and Dan Weingarten, a cartoonist.

Weingarten has stated he is an atheist. He is an amateur horologist.

<doc id="1099647" wikidata="Q17116050" url="?curid=1099647" title="Golf (card game)">
<text>Golf (also known as Polish Polka, Polish Poker, Turtle, Hara Kiri and Crazy Nines) is a card game where players try to earn the lowest number of points (as in golf, the sport) over the course of nine deals (or &quot;holes&quot;).

The game has little in common with the solitaire game of the same name.

==Deal==

Two or three players should use a standard 52-card deck. If played with four or more, a double-deck of 104 cards is ideal. 

Each player is dealt six face-down cards from a shuffled deck. The remaining cards are placed face down to serve as the stock, from which the top card is taken and turned up to start the discard pile beside it. Players arrange their cards in two rows of three in front of them and turn any two of these cards face up. This arrangement is maintained throughout the game; players always have six cards in front of them.

==Play==

The objective is for players to reduce the value of the cards in front of them by swapping them for lesser value cards. After the last round, the highest score loses the game, and the lowest score wins the game (see scoring below).

Beginning at the dealer&#x27;s left, players take turns drawing single cards from either the stock or discard piles. The drawn card may either be swapped for one of that player&#x27;s six cards or discarded. If the card is swapped for one of the face-down cards, the card swapped in remains face up. If the card drawn is discarded, the player can then choose to flip a card face up.

The round ends when a player has six face-up cards (sometimes the other players are given one final turn following this), after which scoring happens as follows: 

* Each Ace scores one point
* Each Two scores minus two points
* Each numeral card from 3 to 10 scores its face value
* Each Jack or Queen scores 10 points
* Each King scores zero points
* A pair of equal cards in the same column scores zero points for the column regardless of the rank of those cards

During play, it is &quot;not&quot; legal for a player to pick up a card from the discard pile and return it to the discard pile without playing it. A card picked up from the discard pile must be swapped with one of the current player&#x27;s cards.

A full game is typically nine &quot;holes&quot; (hands), after which the player with the lowest total score is designated the winner. A longer game can be played to eighteen holes.

==Variations==

The game we call Golf was invented by Elias Clark, but there are many variants 

There is a multitude of variants in multiplayer golf. Some common ones include:

===Single-deck golf===
For two to four players. Rules are the same as in double-deck golf. Sometimes, jokers are not used.

===Knocking===
Golf can be played so that instead of ending the game automatically, a player must choose to &quot;knock&quot; instead of taking their turn. Remaining players then have one turn to draw a card to improve their hands and then scores are totaled and recorded on a running score sheet. This rule is more common for four-card golf.

===Four-card golf===
Suitable for 3-7 players, in four-card Golf each player receives four cards face down in a 2×2 grid and reveal two before play begins. Play proceeds similar to six-card golf. The end of a round is initiated by a player &#x27;knocking&#x27;, after which other players get one final turn.

===Nine-card golf===
One or two decks are involved, depending on the number of players. One deck is adequate for 1-3 players, two or more decks are suggested for 4+ players. To begin the game, each player is dealt nine cards, laying out the cards face down in a 3x3 grid. The method or pattern for how the players layout their 3x3 grid is arbitrary, as long as the cards remain face down.

The game is played as six-card golf. Once any grid contains only face-up cards, the game is immediately ended, there are no further turns, and all players must flip all their face-down cards to determine their scores. Scoring is the same as six-card golf, with players having to form a full three-of-a-kind column to have that column score zero.

This process of game play continues for nine total games or until a player exceeds 50 points.

Optional rules of this version include:
* Horizontal and diagonal lines of three also score zero
* Playing with jokers in the game, valued at -4 points
* Every pair of adjacent (horizontal or vertical) equal cards scores zero
* If the player places four cards in a square pattern (i.e. 2x2 block) of the same face-point value, this results in a negative score (e.g. -25), for those four cards
* Instead of drawing a card, a player may choose to flip a card in their grid face up
* Playing until a player exceeds 100 points instead of 50

===Alternative scoring===
There are many variants for point values of cards, including:
*Jokers are added to the deck and score -5, or some other negative number.
*Jokers are +15 individually, or -5 as a pair.
*Queens score 12, 13 or 20 points each.
*Queen of spades scores 40 points, other Queens 10 each, and Eights are zero points.
*One-eyed jacks are wild and automatically form a pair with an adjacent card (or complete a triplet in 9-card golf).
*Jacks score zero, Queens 12, Kings 13.
*Jacks are worth 20 points each and when a Jack is discarded, the following player loses a turn.
*Twos are plus 2 instead of minus 2 (usually played in games without jokers).
*Four of a kind wins the game (not the hole) automatically (usually played in 4-card golf).
*A player who has a 9 card straight scores -12. This hand is considered a &quot;hole in 1&quot;. If player does not obtain correct number of cards for a straight, then all points are added as usual.
*A player may &quot;shoot the moon&quot; by getting the maximum 60 points. He or she gets 0 points for the round, and all other players get 60 points.
*When playing 8-card, 4x2, four kings on one side = -16 points.
*In &quot;Cutthroat Golf&quot; the kings are worth 15 points and if drawn from the deck can be traded for any other players up card. The card they receive must then be placed in their hand.

In some versions, making a pair or triple of cards of equal rank (sometimes vertically, sometimes horizontally and sometimes diagonally) reduces those cards&#x27; scores to zero.

===Cambio===

Variants known as Cambio, Pablo or Cactus include &quot;power cards&quot;. When a power card is drawn from the stock, it can either be used for its normal value or discarded to activate its power. (If a power card is drawn from the discards, it must be played as its number.) A simple version of the game played in Malaysia has the following power cards:

*A Jack allows a player to look at one of their own cards (without their opponent seeing it)
*A Queen allows a player to look at one of their opponent&#x27;s cards (again without their opponent seeing)
*A King allows a player to swap one of their own cards with that of their opponent
*A Joker allows a player to change the positions of their opponent&#x27;s cards

John McLeod of Pagat.com speculates that these variants are Spanish in origin, as the game is recorded as being played by students in Spain, and many of its variant names are Spanish words (&quot;cambio&quot; meaning &quot;exchange&quot;). The game had a commercial release as &quot;Cabo&quot; in 2010 and is similar to the 1996 Mensa Select winner &quot;Rat-a-Tat Cat&quot;.

===Powers===
&quot;Powers&quot; is an escalated version of Cambio where every card is given some sort of additional ability. The game can only end after knocking, and all cards stay face down unless a power dictates that one should be turned up. You start the game with 6 cards, and can look at any two of them, with the rest staying hidden until you swap them or look at them with a power. 

On your turn, you take the top card, and put it into your deck without looking at the card with which you want to swap it, and discard. Or, you can discard the card you have drawn straight away, and instead use the power of the card instead. 

The abilities are as follows:

The Black King is the only card which can have its power applied when in a player&#x27;s set.

===Knocker&#x27;s penalties and bonuses===
Some play Golf and its variations such that a player who knocks (turns over all cards first) but doesn&#x27;t end with the lowest score is penalized:
*Knocker adds a penalty of 10 or 20 points, &quot;or&quot;...
*Knocker&#x27;s score for the hand is doubled with 5 points added, &quot;or&quot;...
*The knocker takes a score equal to the highest scoring player for that hand, &quot;or&quot;...
*Knocker adds twice the number of people playing.

If the knocker&#x27;s score is lowest, some play with a bonus:
*Knocker scores zero instead of a positive score, &quot;or&quot;...
*Knocker&#x27;s score is reduced by the number of people playing.

<doc id="1099658" wikidata="Q366752" url="?curid=1099658" title="Steve Bloomer">
<text>Stephen Bloomer (20 January 1874 – 16 April 1938) was an England international footballer and manager who played for Derby County – becoming their record goalscorer – and Middlesbrough. The anthem &quot;Steve Bloomer&#x27;s Watchin&#x27;&quot; is played at every Derby home game and there is a bust of him at the Pride Park Stadium. He is also listed in the Football League 100 Legends and English Football Hall of Fame.

During his career, Bloomer was a prolific goalscorer for both club and country. A quick-thinking forward, he was able to shoot powerfully and accurately with either foot and his speciality was the &quot;daisy cutter&quot; – a low shot, hit with great power, speed and accuracy. In 535 First Division games he scored 314 goals and, after Jimmy Greaves, he is the second-highest all-time goalscorer in the top-flight of English football. He also scored 28 goals in 23 appearances for England. He helped Derby to win the Second Division title in 1911–12, and to finish second in the First Division in 1895–96; he also played on the losing side in four FA Cup semi-finals and three FA Cup finals (1898, 1899 and 1903).
Bloomer also played baseball for Derby Baseball Club and helped them become British champions three times in the 1890s. After retiring as a footballer he became a coach and worked with clubs in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. During World War I he was interned at Ruhleben, a civilian detention camp. The highlight of his coaching career came in 1924 when he guided Real Unión to victory in the Copa del Rey.

==Family and early life==
Bloomer was born in Cradley, Worcestershire (now the West Midlands) to Caleb Bloomer (a blacksmith / iron foundry worker) and Merab Dunn, on 20 January 1874. He was the eldest of six children. The family moved to Litchurch, Derbyshire five years later. Caleb began working for Ley&#x27;s Malleable Castings foundry in Derby which was founded by Francis Ley. At the age of 12 Bloomer left school, and started working as an apprentice for a local blacksmith. This helped him to build strength.

Bloomer had an aptitude for football that he later described as &quot;a natural gift&quot;. He first made an impression on the Derby football scene playing for St. Chad&#x27;s Choir on 11 April 1887. Bloomer was on the losing side of the 1887 Derbyshire Boys&#x27; Shield under-15 final on this date, and impressed despite his team losing 14–0 to a dominant St Luke&#x27;s Choir. His mother died on 27 November 1887 at 87, Yates Street in Derby.

In 1888, soon after his 14th birthday Stephen began working as a &#x27;striker&#x27; at Ley&#x27;s iron foundry, where his father Caleb, and uncle Farley worked. In 1888 he also began playing football for Derby Swifts in the Derbyshire Minor League. On 20 December 1890, at Belper he scored seven goals against Belper Town in a 22–2 win. In 1891 he appeared in the Midland League for Derby Midland, playing in a 1–1 draw with Burton Swifts on 27 March.

==Playing career==
===Club===
====Derby County====

Derby County merged with Derby Midland in June 1891, and Bloomer was a Derby County player for the start of the 1891–92 – the fourth season of the Football League. He chose to retain his amateur status because he wanted to help out his team Derby Swifts in their shield competition. Bloomer turned out for the third-team twice, and the second team once in this season. He signed a professional contract for Derby County on Thursday 28 April 1892. Mr. Clarke, the Secretary of Burton Wanderers also tried to sign Bloomer for his club. Two days after he signed for Derby, he tried to persuade Bloomer to sign for his club, but he refused. He was approached by Mr. Clarke again on Monday 2 May 1892, and this time signed a professional contract with Burton Wanderers but the Football Association soon ruled the contract to be invalid and reprimanded the Burton official. A hearing of the case was held at Crewe, on 25 January 1893.

An administrative error by Derby secretary William Parker meant that Ernest Hickinbottom, Jimmy McLachlan and Samuel Mills were ineligible for the opening game of the 1892–93 season against Stoke at the Victoria Ground, and Bloomer was a surprise late addition to the first eleven. Hickinbottom, McLachlan and Mills had been registered a day too late and so they could not play unless by special permission, which could not be granted in time. Bloomer later claimed many times that he scored twice during the game but contemporary reports instead credited him with scoring just one goal, which was the second of Derby&#x27;s goals in the 3–1 win. The local papers credited Johnny McMillan with scoring the first goal for Derby County in this game, and Frederick George Ekins getting the third goal for the team. Steve Bloomer&#x27;s performance in this game was reviewed very positively in the local papers. He remained a key member of the first team, and was also given penalty taking duties, and finished the campaign with 11 goals from 28 matches. Veteran striker and captain John Goodall helped to improve his game, helping to improve his ball control and positional skills.

He missed seven games of the 1893–94 season after Leicester Fosse half-back Peggy Lord broke his collarbone on 10 February. Bloomer recovered and claimed 19 goals from 27 appearances during the campaign.

Derby struggled during the 1894–95 campaign, and Bloomer was limited to 10 goals in 29 league games as County finished in 15th place and forced to play a test match against Notts County at Filbert Street to retain their First Division status. Notts County were leading 1–0 with seven minutes to go, but goals from Goodall and Bloomer gave Derby the win.

Bloomer opened the 1895–96 season by scoring both goals in a 2–0 win over Sunderland in the club&#x27;s new permanent home at the Baseball Ground (the club had actually already played two first team games at the ground in 1892 due to scheduling conflicts at the County Ground). Derby finished the season in second-place behind Aston Villa and exited the FA Cup at the semi-finals after losing 2–1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers.

While at Derby he was top scorer in the First Division on five occasions in 1896, 1897, 1899, 1901 and 1904. In 1896, together with John Campbell of Aston Villa. He was also the leading &quot;Rams&quot; scorer for 14 consecutive seasons and scored 17 hat-tricks in the league. One of his best seasons came in 1896–97 when he scored 31 goals, including five hat-tricks, in 33 League and FA Cup games. Between 14 November 1896 and 5 April 1897 he scored 21 goals in 20 games. He also scored six goals for the club in a game against Sheffield Wednesday in January 1899.

Bloomer&#x27;s goals helped Derby finish runners-up in the First Division in 1896 and helped them reach three FA Cup finals in 1898, 1899 and 1903. He scored in the 1898 final, a 3–1 defeat to Nottingham Forest. On 3 September 1900 Bloomer scored the first-ever goal at The Hawthorns, the 1–1 draw against West Bromwich Albion being the first match played at the ground.

====Middlesbrough====
On 15 March 1906 Bloomer joined Middlesbrough for a fee of £750. Among teammates at his new club were Alf Common, the first £1,000 footballer, and Fred Pentland. He was top-scorer at Middlesbrough in both the 1906–07 and 1907–08 seasons. He also scored four goals in a game against Woolwich Arsenal on 5 January 1907.

====Return to Derby County====
After four years at Middlesbrough he returned to the Rams in 1910 and helped them win the Second Division title in 1912. He scored his last league goal for Derby against Sheffield United on 6 September 1913 and his last match for the Derby County first team, was against Burnley on 31 January 1914 when he was 40 years and 11 days.

===International===
Bloomer made his England debut on 9 March 1895, scoring twice in a 9–0 win against Ireland, which helped England win the British Home Championship. The &quot;Sporting Life&quot; viewed Bloomer as being the best forward on the field for England in this game with Billy Bassett coming a close second. He scored in all of his first 10 international appearances, which remains a record for number of consecutive scoring appearances. He netted 19 times during these games, including 5 goals against Wales on 16 March 1896, winning three British Home Championships. He became England&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer on 2 April 1898, when he surpassed Tinsley Lindley&#x27;s total of 14 with two goals against Scotland. On 18 March 1901, he scored four goals against Wales, becoming the first player to score two hat-tricks for England and also the first to score four goals for England twice, as England once again won the British Home Championship. At the end of 1901, his goal tally stood at 25 in just 14 games. Bloomer played for England 11 times over the next 6 years, all in the British Home Championship, winning four more, bringing England&#x27;s total to eight during his career, however he only scored 3 more goals during this period. He captained England once; against Scotland on 3 May 1902. He finished his international career in 1907 as England&#x27;s longest serving player and England&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer with 28 goals. He held the record until his tally was overhauled by Vivian Woodward in 1911.

During his international career Bloomer&#x27;s teammates included his County teammate John Goodall as well as Frank Becton, Billy Bassett, Jack Reynolds, Ernest Needham, Fred Spiksley, Sam Wolstenholme and Woodward.

==Prisoner in Germany==
After retiring as a player Bloomer went to Germany in July 1914 to coach Britannia Berlin 92. However within three weeks of arriving the First World War broke out. When Germany declared war on Russia, his contract was cancelled at once, and Herr Fauber, President of Britannia Berlin 92 advised Bloomer to get out of Germany as soon as possible but he could not get out of the country. Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914.

On 5 August 1914, Steve Bloomer, anxious to leave Germany, went to the British Consul office in Berlin. He was stopped by two gendarmes who questioned him, and his translator. Along with about a dozen others, he was marched through the streets of Berlin for about a quarter of a mile to the Alexander Platz, accompanied by a guard with revolvers and swords. At the Alexander Platz he was questioned by magistrates with others, and arrested. Bloomer was given a slip of paper with his name and description, and told to report to the police at periodic intervals. On 6 November 1914, he was interned at Ruhleben, a civilian detention camp in the Spandau district of Berlin. According to the &quot;Derby Daily Telegraph,&quot; which relayed details in a letter written from Bloomer to his wife, he was arrested as a prisoner of war on 5 November 1914, although another source gives the date of his arrest as 6 November 1914. Bloomer was one of several former professional footballers among the detainees. Others included his former England colleague Sam Wolstenholme; his former Middlesbrough teammate Fred Pentland; a Scotland international, John Cameron; John Brearley, once of Everton and Tottenham Hotspur; and a German international, Edwin Dutton, who had previously played for Britannia Berlin 92.

The camp contained between 4,000 and 5,500 prisoners. Gradually a mini-society evolved and football became a popular activity. The Ruhleben Football Association was formed and cup and league competitions were organised with as many as 1,000 attending the bigger games. The teams adopted the names of established teams and in November 1914, Bloomer captained a &quot;Tottenham Hotspur XI&quot;, that also included Dutton, to victory in a cup final against an &quot;Oldham Athletic XI&quot;. On 2 May 1915, an &quot;England XI&quot; featuring Pentland, Wolstenholme, Brearley and Bloomer played a &quot;World XI&quot; captained by Cameron. Bloomer also played cricket at the camp and in May 1915 a &quot;Rubleben XI&quot;, featuring Bloomer and Brearley, played a &quot;Varsities XI&quot; in the Rubleban Cricket League. In July 1916 a &quot;Lancashire XI&quot;, featuring Bloomer, beat a &quot;Yorkshire XI&quot; that included Wolstenholme.

In summer the prisoners turned to cricket on &#x27;The Oval&#x27;, played to packed houses. Bloomer established the camp batting record with an innings of 204 and recorded bowling figures of 6 for 15. There was athletics too. Bloomer won the &#x27;Old Age Handicap&#x27; at the Ruhleben Olympics, sprinting the 75 yards in 9.6 seconds. Everybody in camp knew &#x27;Steve&#x27;. When he finally left Ruhleben in March 1918, a farewell football match was staged in his honour. Bloomer was released to neutral Holland, where he was employed as a coach of Blauw-Wit Amsterdam. He was not allowed to return home until the end of the war. Bloomer later said of his time in Ruhleben, &quot;Myself and many others would not have survived without football.&quot;

==Coaching career==
Immediately after World War I Bloomer briefly coached Blauw-Wit Amsterdam in The Netherlands. He returned to England on 22 November 1918, and became player-coach of the Derby County reserve team, retiring from playing in January 1920. He was coach of the Derby first team in 1921. Between May and August 1922, he was in Montréal, Canada coaching the Grenadier Guards football team during their close season. He arrived back in England on 11 August 1922, and resumed his coaching duties with Derby County.

In 1923 he became coach of Real Unión in Spain and subsequently guided them to victory in the 1924 Copa del Rey. During the 1920s the Copa was effectively a play-off to decide the Spanish champions. Teams qualified by winning their regional titles and Real Unión represented Guipuzcoa. Nine other regional champions also qualified and in the first round of the competition Real beat Sevilla FC, the champions of Andalusia, 3–1 on aggregate. In the semi-final they faced the Catalan champions, FC Barcelona, coached by another Englishman, Jack Greenwell. Greenwell&#x27;s squad included the likes of Paulino Alcántara, Sagibarba and Josep Samitier. Despite this, Real beat FC Barcelona 5–1 after a replay and went on to beat Real Madrid, the champions of central Spain, 1–0 in the final.

==Last years==
After finishing coaching Real Union, Bloomer returned to England and to Derby where he worked the rest of his life as a groundsman and general assistant at the Baseball Ground. He died in Derby of bronchitis on 16 April 1938 aged 64.

==Baseball==
On 13 May 1893, he played at first base for St. James&#x27;s in a 17 - 34 defeat against Vulcan, at Derby. This was the first match of the 1893-1894 Derbyshire Baseball Association. The Vulcan team contained many members of the old Derby Baseball Club which had disbanded in 1890, but had reformed again later in that same year. On 10 June 1893, Steve Bloomer played for a Rest Of League team against Derby in a 22 - 26 defeat.

Bloomer then played baseball for Derby Baseball Club, making his debut for the team at the age of 20 on 5 May 1894, at the Baseball Ground in Derby. The Derby County goalkeeper, Jack Robinson also made his debut on the same day. Derby got to the semi-final of the English cup in 1894, and lost to the Thespians. The team won the English Baseball Cup on 17 August 1895 at Derby&#x27;s Baseball Ground beating Fullers in the final, with Steve Bloomer playing at first base. They won 16 matches and lost just five in that season. The English Cup was won again by Derby in 1897, when they beat Middlesbrough in the final. The trophy was won for a third time by Derby, beating Nott&#x27;m Forest 14 - 3 in the final on 19 August 1899. Bloomer captained the team in the final and played at second base.

Derby County formed a baseball team in 1900 which Steve Bloomer played for in that season. Their first game was played on 19 May 1900. It contained, with Bloomer and among others, players who were or had been, members of Derby County football team up to that date: Enos Bromage, Hugh McQueen, Jonathan Staley, John Goodall, and Jimmy Methven. They played in a local league against Derby, Ilkeston, Belper, Chesterfield and Nottingham Forest. However, both Derby baseball teams do not appear to have existed after 1900.

==Legacy==

A plaque commemorating Bloomer&#x27;s by-then demolished birthplace in Bridge Street, Cradley, was unveiled in 2000 by former Wolverhampton Wanderers and Derby player Jimmy Dunn and Bloomer&#x27;s grandson Steve Richards.

On 17 January 2009, after a long and sustained period of campaigning, a bust of Bloomer was finally unveiled inside Pride Park, Derby. Bloomer&#x27;s two grandsons, Steve Richards and Alan Quantrill, unveiled the bust in the presence of Bloomer&#x27;s family and relations, the sculptor Andy Edwards and thousands of Derby County fans. On 17 January 2009, a bust of Bloomer was unveiled next to the home dugout at Pride Park Stadium. He remains a legend at Derby County and the club anthem, &quot;Steve Bloomer&#x27;s Watchin&#x27;&quot;, is played and sang before every home game. He is also listed in the Football League 100 Legends and English Football Hall of Fame.

Real Unión held a Steve Bloomer Day on 21 January 2017, to pay tribute to Bloomer. In recognition of his contribution to both clubs, Real Unión and Derby County met to contest the Steve Bloomer Trophy in a friendly match in Irun on 3 October 2017, in what is intended to become an annual fixture.

On 16 February 2018, a Blue plaque honouring Bloomer was unveiled on Bloomer&#x27;s former school, in Portland Street, Derby, by the Derby Civic Society, in the presence of the Mayor of Derby, councillor John Whitby. It reads:

<text>USS &quot;Ray&quot; (SS/SSR-271), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the ray, a fish characterized by a flat body, large pectoral fins, and a whiplike tail.

==Construction and commissioning==
A fleet submarine, &quot;Ray&quot; was laid down on 20 July 1942; launched on 28 February 1943 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, sponsored by Mrs. S. C. Loomis; and commissioned on 27 July 1943.

==Service history==
After training in Lake Michigan until 15 August 1943, &quot;Ray&quot; arrived at Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, via New Orleans, Louisiana, on 31 August 1943 for intensive training. Departing Panama on 5 October, she reached Brisbane, Australia, on 30 October 1943.

===World War II===
==== First war patrol, November–December 1943 ====

Departing Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 13 November for her first war patrol, &quot;Ray&quot; searched the area north of the Bismarck Archipelago. On the New Hanover-Truk shipping lane, she made radar contact with a three-ship convoy, escorted by three patrol craft. Attacking just before dawn she scored three hits on one of the freighters. Then, after evading the escorts&#x27; countermeasures, she followed the convoy and sank the converted gunboat &quot;Nikkai Maru&quot; with a spread of torpedoes. Before ending her patrol in December, &quot;Ray&quot; twice unsuccessfully attacked another convoy.

==== Second war patrol, December 1943–January 1944 ====

&quot;Ray&quot;&#x27;s second patrol, 11 December 1943 to 12 January 1944 was in the Celebes-Ambon-Timor area. Near midnight on 26 December she sighted an unescorted tanker standing out from Tioro Strait. When the enemy ship reached open water, &quot;Ray&quot; fired a spread of torpedoes which stopped &quot;Kyoko Maru&quot; dead in the water and sent a huge mushroom of flame into the night sky as the target disintegrated.

On 1 January 1944, SS-271 intercepted two ships with escorts in the mouth of Ambon Bay, Java, and sank converted gunboat &quot;Okuyo Maru&quot; with three hits. The accompanying cargo ship tried to ram the submarine, and a combined aerial attack by patrol bombers and a sustained depth charge attack forced &quot;Ray&quot; to run deep. Three days later, following an unsuccessful attack on two cargo ships escorted by a Chidori-class torpedo boat, &quot;Ray&quot; returned to Fremantle.

==== Third war patrol, February–March 1944 ====

The third patrol, 6 February to 27 March, in the South China and Java Seas included the laying of a minefield off Saigon, Indochina, on 22 February. On the evening of 2 March, &quot;Ray&quot; intercepted a nine-ship convoy, and early on the 3rd came within firing range. A spread of four torpedoes damaged a tanker, but crossed &quot;Ray&quot;&#x27;s line of fire preventing a coup de grâce.

On 18 March &quot;Ray&quot; intercepted two &quot;Chidori&quot;-class torpedo boats and a patrol craft, fired six torpedoes, and dived deep. The submarine&#x27;s crew heard an explosion. An intense depth charge attack followed. &quot;Ray&quot; escaped after sunset. The submarine ended her patrol at Fremantle.

==== Fourth war patrol, April–June 1944 ====

SS-271 departed Fremantle on 23 April for her fourth patrol. Her hunting ground was the Davao Gulf-Molucca Passage area. On the afternoon of 21 May, she spotted a nine-ship convoy escorted by surface ships and seaplanes. &quot;Ray&quot; surfaced that night, pursued the convoy, and attacked early the next morning. She fired six &quot;fish&quot; at a large transport and an overlapping smaller cargo vessel sinking transport &quot;Tempei Maru&quot; and causing undetermined damage to the freighter. A spread fired from &quot;Ray&quot;&#x27;s stern tubes resulted in hits on a tanker, and possibly a minelayer. During the ensuing confusion, Ray escaped by running at flank speed on the surface.

Overtaking the disorganized convoy, during a tropical squall the next day, &quot;Ray&quot; fired on two radar contacts scoring hits. When the weather cleared, &quot;Ray&quot; saw one ship whose stack was going under and whose bow was rising from the water. The second was enveloped in a cloud of smoke and her decks awash. &quot;Ray&quot; dived deep to escape Japanese patrol aircraft, and the sinking was never confirmed by captured records. As no further suitable contacts were found, the submarine returned to Fremantle, arriving on 14 June.

==== Fifth war patrol, July–August 1944 ====

Her fifth patrol, 9 July to 31 August 1944, in the South China Sea and off the Philippines, drew blood on 18 July when &quot;Ray&quot; sank the tanker &quot;Janbi Maru&quot;. During the engagement, the submarine fired 22 torpedoes during six separate runs on the tanker which fired at Ray with her deck gun. &quot;Ray&quot; returned to Fremantle to reload, before returning to sea on 28 July.

At the south entrance to Makassar Strait, SS-271 intercepted a convoy of three ships and sank the cargo ship &quot;Kōshū Maru&quot;. Nine days later, she scored damaging hits on a transport and sank cargo ship &quot;Zuisho Maru&quot;. On 18 August, off northern Balabac Strait, Philippines, &quot;Ray&quot; closed a large convoy protected by surface escorts and planes, fired six &quot;tin fish&quot; at a tanker, and dived as a destroyer raced in to counterattack. Heavy explosions were heard, and a 2½-hour depth charge pounding followed. During the action, &quot;Ray&quot; heard another violent explosion and the sounds of a ship breaking up, as the tanker &quot;Nansei Maru&quot; went down. The submarine surfaced that evening and pursued the convoy into Palawan Bay.

Air cover prevented a daylight attack, but the wolfpack of &quot;Ray&quot;, , and waited for the ships to come out. &quot;Ray&quot; fired her four remaining torpedoes at a passenger-cargo ship. Three fish missed, but the fourth hit the &quot;Taketoyo Maru&quot; amidships. The escorts forced &quot;Ray&quot; to dive, but she heard the 7,000-ton cargo vessel break up. The submarine underwent a sustained depth charge pounding, but escaped serious damage, returning to Fremantle 31 August.

==== Sixth war patrol, September–December 1944 ====

The submarine&#x27;s sixth war patrol, 23 September to 8 December, took her to the familiar waters of the South China Sea. On 6 October and 7 October, she twice torpedoed a tanker, inflicting undetermined damage. Five days later, she destroyed the cargo ship &quot;Toko Maru&quot; with two direct hits and escaped a subsequent depth charge attack. On 14 October, while making a crash dive to escape a Japanese patrol plane, &quot;Ray&quot;&#x27;s conning tower was flooded by an improperly secured hatch, but she was brought under control before reaching . However, the damage forced the submarine to put into Mios Woendi for repairs during the last week of October.

On the afternoon of 1 November, &quot;Ray&quot; closed a five-ship convoy, sinking the cargo ship Horai Maru No. 7, and damaging a small tanker. Escaping the escorts, she landed men and supplies on the west coast of Mindoro, Philippines, picking up two downed Navy fliers, two Army POW&#x27;s escaped from Corregidor, and an escaped Filipino political prisoner. On the night of 4 November, the sub sighted a cargo ship with its superstructure aflame, from an earlier attack by . She launched two torpedoes, scoring a hit amidships and blowing away the bow of the &quot;Kagu Maru&quot;.

On 6 November, SS-271 intercepted a convoy of two heavy cruisers, and several transports, protected by surface and air escorts. &quot;Ray&quot; fired six rear torpedoes at the , damaged earlier by . One of &quot;Ray&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes hit &quot;Kumano&#x27;s&quot; forward magazine, destroying its bow. Immediately prior to this, &quot;Ray&quot; had been forced to dive under &quot;Kumano&quot; in order to escape aerial and surface attack, and would subsequently ground in shoal water, shearing off her starboard sound head and blowing the sound head cable back into the torpedo room. To prevent further flooding, the submarine came to periscope depth where she saw the bowless cruiser being towed away by a transport. Her own damage and the Japanese escorts kept &quot;Ray&quot; from following up the attack. &quot;Kumano&quot; was destroyed off Luzon by Navy carrier planes 25 November.

On the night of 14 November, &quot;Ray&quot; made a surface attack on a three-ship convoy, blowing up an 800-ton frigate with a direct hit in its magazines. Two days later she launched two torpedoes at a grounded transport, but could not complete the attack because of minefields and shoal water.

On 19 November, she rescued a downed pilot from . The patrol terminated at Pearl Harbor 8 December 1944. From there the submarine headed east, arriving at Mare Island Naval Shipyard 16 December for a major overhaul. Departing San Francisco 26 March, she proceeded via Pearl Harbor to Guam, arriving at Apra Harbor on 29 April 1945.

==== Seventh war patrol, April–June 1945 ====

&quot;Ray&quot; cleared Guam for her seventh war patrol 30 April to 16 June 1945. On 7 May while on lifeguard duty off Kyūshū she rescued 10 men from a downed B-29. On the night of 15 May – 16 May, she picked up the 10 crewmen of a PBM Mariner patrol bomber which was foundering in heavy seas. &quot;Ray&quot; transferred the rescued crews to and and continued her patrol.

On 19 May, she intercepted three small freighters. Her torpedoes ran beneath the targets, and the &quot;freighters&quot;, a disguised hunter-killer group, converged on the area where &quot;Ray&quot; had dived, laying a depth charge pattern. The submarine surfaced and fired her deck gun at her pursuers as she dashed away at flank speed. The remainder of the patrol was devoted to attacking patrol craft and coastal vessels with gunfire until it ended at Midway on 16 June.

==== Eighth war patrol, July–August 1945 ====
Her eighth and final wartime patrol, 11 July to 13 August, took &quot;Ray&quot; to the Gulf of Siam. On the evening of 7 August, she sank 16 small craft by gunfire off Bang Saponnoi, Thailand. That night two boarding parties from the submarine burned seven Junks anchored north of Lem Chong Pra. The submarine arrived at Subic Bay for more ammunition on 13 August, where her patrol was terminated with the end of hostilities on 15 August 1945.

===Post-World War II===
====1945–1947====
Departing Subic Bay on 14 August 1945, &quot;Ray&quot; proceeded via Saipan, Pearl Harbor, and the Panama Canal to Naval Submarine Base New London at New London, Connecticut, which she reached on 5 October 1945. She served in a training capacity at New London until 12 February 1947, when she was decommissioned and placed in reserve.

==== Radar picket submarine (SSR-271), 1952–1958 ====

In December 1950, &quot;Ray&quot; was towed to the Philadelphia Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for conversion to a radar picket submarine. Accordingly redesignated SSR-271 on 3 January 1951, she was recommissioned on 13 August 1952, Lieutenant Commander A. C. Burley in command.

&quot;Ray&quot; departed Philadelphia on 27 March 1953. The remainder of the year was occupied in fleet training operations along the United States East Coast and in the Caribbean.

From 1 March to 26 May 1954, she deployed to the 6th Fleet, serving as a picket ship. Returning to her homeport of Norfolk 26 May, she participated in joint United States-Canadian exercises off Nova Scotia in July and August. The remainder of 1954 and 1955 were spent in fleet exercises, type training, and an overhaul at Charleston Navy Yard from April to November 1955.

Deploying again to the Mediterranean as a radar picket submarine from 5 March to 4 June 1956, she operated with NATO and U.S. Navy units. The remaining months of &quot;Ray&quot;&#x27;s operating schedule in 1956 and 1957 were involved in type training and fleet exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean, including representing Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, at the International Naval Review at Hampton Roads in June 1957 and participating in the NATO Exercise &quot;Strikeback&quot; held off Scotland, France, and Portugal in September and October 1957. The early part of 1958 was spent in fleet exercises off the east coast and the Caribbean. She departed Norfolk 30 June 1958 and entered the Charleston Navy Yard for inactivation.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Ray&quot; was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 30 September 1958 and was struck from the Navy List on 1 April 1960. Her hulk was sold for scrap to the Commercial Metals Company on 18 December 1960.

==Honors and awards==
For action during World War II, &quot;Ray&quot; was awarded seven battle stars, the Navy Unit Commendation (for patrol 6), and the Philippine Republic Presidential Unit Citation.

<text>Patrick Dhane Lanshaw (born October 6, 1982), better known by his stage name Lil Wyte, is an American rapper from Memphis, Tennessee. Lanshaw is a member of the rap collective Hypnotize Minds and owner of the independent label Wyte Music.

== Early life ==
Growing up in Frayser, Lil Wyte discovered his rapping talent at a young age as he could rap Sir Mix-a-Lot&#x27;s entire song &quot;Baby Got Back&quot; completely. He participated in freestyle battles at high school when he was in ninth grade. Lanshaw rapped with his friend &quot;Lil Black&quot;, who inspired him to use the pseudonym &quot;Lil Wyte&quot; and write songs instead of freestyling.

Lanshaw dropped out of high school, but eventually earned his high school diploma.

== Music career ==
Lil Wyte was part of a local rap group, the Shelby Forest Click.

The group&#x27;s home-made demo tape came to the attention of Three 6 Mafia. Juicy J and DJ Paul (one song in particular is said to have gotten him signed, a song titled Memphiz Playaz). Three 6 Mafia signed the rapper and worked later with his debut album. Lil Wyte appeared on Project Pat&#x27;s song &quot;Crash da Club&quot; from his album &quot;Layin&#x27; da Smack Down&quot; in 2002. His debut album &quot;Doubt Me Now&quot; was released in 2003 and it became popular, selling over 135,000 copies without promotion. The album &quot;Doubt Me Now&quot; featured Juvenile, Three 6 Mafia, Frayser Boy, La Chat and Josey Scott. The album had three popular songs: &quot;Oxy Cotton&quot;, &quot;My Smoking Song&quot;, and &quot;Acid&quot;. 

He has been described as a rapid lyricist.

== Personal life ==
Lil Wyte passed up the opportunity of writing the song &quot;It&#x27;s Hard out Here for a Pimp&quot;, because he could not relate to the lyrics of having more than one woman.

Lil Wyte used three strains of marijuana to create his own strain of medical cannabis called OG WYTE Kush. It&#x27;s available in 11 states. The three original strains are Og Kush, White Widow and Grand Daddy Purp.

In 2012 he was arrested in Clarksville, Tennessee, for DUI and drug possession.

<doc id="1099681" wikidata="Q627181" url="?curid=1099681" title="Industrial folk music">
<text>Industrial folk music, industrial folk song, industrial work song or working song is a subgenre of folk or traditional music that developed from the 18th century, particularly in Britain and North America, with songs dealing with the lives and experiences of industrial workers. The origins of industrial folk song are in the British Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth century as workers tended to take the forms of music with which they were familiar, including ballads and agricultural work songs, and adapt them to their new experiences and circumstances. They also developed in France and the US as these countries began to industrialise.

The genre declined in the twentieth century, but were popularised as part of the folk revival by A. L. Lloyd, George Korson, John Lomax, Pete Seeger, Alan Lomax and Archie Green. Because of their political content they have been adapted by rock musicians.

==Origins==
Industrial folk song emerged in Britain, the first nation to industrialise, in the 18th century, as workers and their families moved from a predominately rural and agricultural society to an increasingly urban and industrial one. These workers tended to take the forms of music with which they were familiar, including ballads and agricultural work songs, and adapt them to their new experiences and circumstances. Unlike agricultural work songs, it was often unnecessary to use music to synchronise actions between workers, as the pace would be increasingly determined by water, steam, chemical and eventually electric power, and frequently impossible because of the noise of early industry. As a result, industrial folk songs tended to be descriptive of work, circumstances, or political in nature, making them amongst the earliest protest songs and were sung between work shifts or in leisure hours, rather than during work. This pattern can be seen in the first industry to fully develop, textile production, which was particularly important in Lancashire, with songs like &#x27;Poverty knock&#x27; which described the relentless movement and noise of the loom. The same trends were soon evident in mining and eventually steel, shipbuilding, rail working and other industries. As other nations industrialised their folk song underwent a similar process of change, as can be seen for example in France, where Saint-Simon noted the rise of &#x27;Chansons Industrielles&#x27; among clothworkers in the early 19th century, and in the USA where industrialisation expanded rapidly after the Civil War.

==Definitions and characteristics==
A. L. Lloyd defined the industrial work song as &#x27;the kind of vernacular songs made by workers themselves directly out of their own experiences, expressing their own interest and aspirations, and incidentally passed on among themselves by oral means...&#x27;. His definition did not include songs created by learned writers on behalf of the working class, but he was prepared to accept some popular and musical hall songs that had been adopted by the workers. His definition has been criticised, as it depends on a concept of a pure working class culture unaffected by outside class or media influences, which is at variance with what we know of the spread of ideas and new forms of media from the late 19th century.

Lloyd also pointed to various types of song, including chants of labour, love and erotic occupational songs and industrial protest songs, which included narratives of disasters (particularly among miners), laments for conditions, as well as overtly political strike ballads. He also noted the existence of songs about heroic and mythical figures of industrial work, like the coal miners the &#x27;Big Hewer&#x27; or &#x27;Big Isaac&#x27; Lewis. This tendency was even more marked in early American industrial songs, where representative heroes like Casey Jones and John Henry were eulogised in blues ballads from the 19th century.

==The folk revival==

The first wave of folk song revival in Britain and America the later 19th century and early 20th century was largely unconcerned with recording industrial songs. It tended to focus on the rural and agricultural and has been criticised as being obsessed with a rural idyll. As a result, industrial songs tended to be seen as a threat to traditional forms of music, rather than a development from them. In the second wave of revival, which was much more influenced by progressive or labour politics and as a result tended to show a much greater interest in the lives of working people and their music. This movement was evident first in the USA where George Korson followed John Lomax&#x27;s collection of the work songs of Cowboys with investigations of coal miner&#x27;s songs, particularly from the Appalachians, from 1927. Despite reservations about these songs, whose authors were often known and so they did not fit into the mould of traditional music, after World War II folklorists largely accepted this music as folk song. Pete Seeger&#x27;s Folkways LP &quot;American Industrial Ballads&quot; (1956) was an early survey of this kind of song. The American song collection of over 200 songs in &quot;Hard Hitting Songs For Hard Hit People&quot; by Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Alan Lomax in the 1940s (not published till 1967), explored worker&#x27;s song further. The work of labour historian Archie Green, which included the production of recordings of labour and work songs, provided a wider context for understanding industrial folk song within a wider field of &#x27;labor lore&#x27;. Songs written by Seeger and Guthrie, were also important in continuing the tradition and moving it into progressive folk music. Among the most successful of these composed industrial songs was Merle Travis&#x27; Sixteen Tons, first recorded in 1946, but made probably the most commercially successful industrial song when it was a major hit for &#x27;Tennessee&#x27; Ernie Ford in 1955.

In Britain the leading proponent of, and commentator on, industrial folk music was A. L. Lloyd. His &quot;Come All Ye Bold Miners: Ballads and Songs from the Coalfields&quot;, a collection of mining songs was published in 1952. Of his own recordings the most influential were his arrangement of various industrial songs on the LP &quot;The Iron Muse: a Panorama of Industrial Folk Song&quot; (1963). A. L. Lloyd wrote in the 1965 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; a paragraph on &#x27;Industrial Song&#x27;, part his broader entry on &#x27;Folk Music&#x27; and his &quot;Folk Song in England&quot; (1967) concluded with a chapter titled &#x27;Industrial Folk Song&#x27;, which popularised the term. Subsequently, David Harker criticised Lloyd for his romanticisation of industrial workers. The other major figure of the second British folk revival, Ewan MacColl also played a significant part in popularising British Industrial folk song, making &quot;Shuttle and Cage&quot; a 10&quot; LP with Peggy Seeger for Topic Records in 1958 and alone an LP for Stinson in 1963 called &quot;British Industrial Folk Songs&quot;. From 1957 to 1964 probably the widest audience for British work songs was achieved through the Radio Ballads, of MacColl and Peggy Seeger, many of which focused on work, including rail workers, road building, fishing and coal mining. However, many of the songs in the Radio Ballads were written by MacColl himself in the style of the songs that he, Lloyd and others had collected e.g. &#x27;Shoals of Herring&#x27;. In the British folk rock movement of the 1970s industrial folk music was less prominent than traditional ballads, but largely accepted as part of folk music, with songs like &#x27;Blackleg Miner&#x27; being recorded beside medieval ballads by leading bands of the genre like Steeleye Span.

==Decline and survival==
Industrial folk song overlapped with other forms of music from the late 19th century, such as Music hall and popular music and began to disappear as a genre from the mid-20th century as different forms of song provided alternatives and the decline of major industries began to undermine it. However, because of its political associations it has been revived, particularly in times of political and social upheaval such as the 1980s, when anarchist punk band Chumbawamba included several industrial work and protest songs on their &quot;English Rebel Songs 1381-1914&quot; album (1988) and the tradition was taken up by folk artists like Billy Bragg. In the United States, arguably the most successful inheritor of the tradition is Bruce Springsteen, often focusing more on industrial decline in songs like &quot;Youngstown&quot; on his 1995 album &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot;. Songs from the tradition continue to be recorded, as in the Grammy nominated &quot;Music of Coal: Mining Songs from the Appalachian Coalfields&quot; (2007), a two CD compilation and booklet of mining songs.

<doc id="1099683" wikidata="Q1359270" url="?curid=1099683" title="Alfred Rosmer">
<text>Alfred Rosmer (born Alfred Griot, 23 August 1877 – 6 May 1964) was an American-born French Communist political activist and historian who was a leading member of the Comintern. Rosmer is best remembered as a political associate of Leon Trotsky and a memoirist.

==Early life==
Alfred Griot was born in 1877 in Paterson, New Jersey. His father worked as a barber in the United States, returning with the family to France in 1884. Having learned English as a child, Rosmer remained fluent in the language for the rest of his life.

==French syndicalist==
He took the political pseudonym Rosmer from the hero of a play by Henrik Ibsen.

Rosmer was a syndicalist leader before World War I, active in the Confédération générale du travail (CGT), the French general federation of unions. Together with Pierre Monatte, he issued a journal called &quot;La Vie ouvrière&quot; (Worker&#x27;s Life), which was terminated as a result of French entry into World War I.

The antiwar French syndicalists had been represented at the Zimmerwald Conference in 1915 and then organised as the Committee for the Resumption of International Relations in which Rosmer participated. After the end of the war, a strike wave swept France in which the syndicalists played an active role. &quot;La Vie ouvrière&quot; was resurrected by Rosmer and Monatte in March 1919.

In May 1919, Rosmer and Fernand Loriot transformed the former Committee for the Resumption of International Relations into a new organization, known as the Committee for Adhesion to the Third International. The group remained isolated and without significant influence, however, largely removed from active communication with Moscow.

A friendship with Leon Trotsky dated from that period, when the latter was briefly living in France.

==Communist Party leader==
After the war, he became a leading figure in the Communist Party of France (PCF). He was sent to Moscow in 1920 as a representative of the French left, being assigned there to positions in the Communist International (Comintern) and the Red International of Labor Unions (RILU).

In 1923 and 1924 Rosmer was one of the top leaders of the PCF, until his expulsion in the fall of 1924 along with Boris Souvarine and Monatte for opposing the organised campaign against Trotsky.

==Trotskyism==
After his expulsion from the PCF, Rosmer helped found the journal &quot;La Révolutuion prolétarienne&quot; (The Proletarian Revolution) and participated in political activities in a circle organised around this magazine. He became the only member of the group to establish the first Trotskyist movement in 1929, but he left it in 1931 because of differences over political tactics.

Nevertheless, he remained a convinced revolutionary, and his friendship with Trotsky was later repaired. He visited the exiled Trotsky in Mexico in 1939.

In Mexico, Rosmer was a member of the Dewey Commission, which cleared Trotsky of all charges made during the Moscow Trials.

==Later life==
Unable to return to France because of the outbreak of World War II, Rosmer, an American by birth, lived in the United States after his Mexican interlude. He finally obtained permission to return home in 1947. Rosmer published an autobiography detailing his activities in Soviet Russia as well as a two-volume history of the antiwar movement in France during the years of World War I.

Rosmer died in 1964.

<text>God&#x27;s Son is the sixth studio album by American rapper Nas. It was released on December 13, 2002, by Ill Will and Columbia Records. Production took place during 2001 to 2002, and was handled by several producers, including Salaam Remi, Chucky Thompson, Ron Browz, Eminem, and The Alchemist. The album also includes guest appearances from artists such as Alicia Keys, Kelis, and a posthumous feature from 2Pac. Musically, &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; blends hardcore hip hop with elements of soul and jazz. Partly inspired by the death of his mother in early 2002, &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; covers lyrical themes such as religion, violence, grief, redemption and his own emotional experiences. It has been recognized by critics as some of Nas&#x27; most personal work.

The album debuted at number 18 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 156,000 copies in its first week of sales. It produced three singles that achieved &quot;Billboard&quot; chart success, and received critical acclaim, with critics praising Nas&#x27; lyricism and viewing it as a progression from his previous work. On January 14, 2003, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales surpassing one million copies.

==Background==
Nas&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Illmatic&quot; (1994), received much critical acclaim, but his next few releases were considered to have been more commercial, which received criticism. Fellow New York rapper Jay-Z dissed Nas on &quot;Takeover&quot;. Nas responded with &quot;Ether&quot;, elevating a heated feud. &quot;Ether&quot; was released on 2001&#x27;s &quot;Stillmatic&quot;, an acclaimed album that signaled Nas&#x27; return to &quot;hip-Hop prominence.&quot; Jay-Z later challenged Nas to a pay-per-view rap battle, but Nas rejected, and said: &quot;Pay-per-view is for wrestlers and boxers. I make records. If Jay-Z wants to battle, he should drop his album the same day I do and let the people decide&quot; referring to &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; and Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;The Blueprint 2&quot; release.

After the release of &quot;Stillmatic&quot;, Nas spent time tending to his ill mother, Ann Jones, until she died of breast cancer in April 2002. Nas has described Jay-Z&#x27;s disses during this time period as &quot;sneak attack[s]&quot; because Nas did not want to record music while his mother was sick. Nas&#x27; mother died in his arms, and later served as inspiration for various songs on &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot;. At the time, Nas was nearing the end of his feud with Jay-Z, which also inspired the album&#x27;s emotional and personal material. During 2002, fans and critics speculated that Nas was still willing to make commercial music as he started associating himself with artists from Murder Inc., a label distributing mainstream hip hop/rap. Irv Gotti claimed that Nas might sign with him, and he said: &quot;I will definitely be affiliated [with Nas] and I&#x27;ll definitely be a part of [his projects], me and my brother Ja Rule.&quot; Nas soon appeared on &quot;The Pledge (Remix)&quot;, a song by Ja Rule in which Nas hints at signing with the hip hop label.

By October 2002, &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; was expected to be released on December 17, with production from Salaam Remi, Large Professor and The Alchemist, as well as songs recorded with Ja Rule in Miami. Around the same time, a music video for the single &quot;Made You Look&quot; was being shot. In December, Nas appeared in the video for a 2Pac single, &quot;Thugz Mansion (N.Y.)&quot;, a song of which an alternative version was later released on &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot;, featuring two verses from Nas and one from 2Pac. On December 4, Nas decided to push up the release date for &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; by a number of days in order to prevent bootlegging. Commenting on this, he said, &quot;&quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; is my most personal album and I poured my heart and spirit into it[.] It&#x27;s important to me that the fans hear my album the way I intended. When you buy a bootleg or pirate a download off the Net, you don&#x27;t get the real thing. The sound sucks, the sequencing is wrong, you&#x27;re probably missing some tracks, and you don&#x27;t even get the artwork and CD bonuses.&quot;

==Composition==

===Production===
&quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; featured production from various producers, including Salaam Remi, Eminem and Alchemist. Remi produced 5 tracks while all other producers work on 2 or less tracks. Music critic Serena Kim of &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine supports Nas&#x27; use of a variety of commercially risky producers saying, &quot;The risks he takes with the production are a big part of the allure of &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot;. In a time when a Neptunes beat is as essential as a savvy marketing plan, Nas goes in the other direction, giving producer Salaam Remi plenty of room.&quot; &quot;Get Down&quot; is a funky rework of &quot;The Boss&quot; and &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; by James Brown, while &quot;Last Real Nigga Alive&quot; contains a simplistic beat dominated by eerie keys that seem to be made by a Casio keyboard. Remi samples many genres of music from classical (Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Für Elise&quot; in &quot;I Can&quot;) to deep funk (Incredible Bongo Band&#x27;s &quot;Apache&quot; in &quot;Made You Look&quot;) while other producers do not rely on samples at all. &quot;Dance&quot;, a Chucky Thompson production, contains a simple beat consisting of a bass guitar riff and faint drums, neither of which are sampled. Another track that is notable for its lack of sampling is &quot;Thugz Mansion (N.Y.).&quot; Produced by Claudio Cueni and Michael Herring, it contains a beat consisting solely of an acoustic guitar riff. Brett Berliner of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; described the sound of &quot;Made You Look&quot; as old-school influenced and &quot;trunk-rattling&quot;, while he wrote that &quot;Dance&quot;, a plea by Nas for one more day with his recently passed mother, features production that &quot;sounds straight out of 1995 and a Hootie and the Blowfish album.&quot; Berliner summed up the album&#x27;s diverse productions, stating:

Although there is no actual musical band or ensemble for &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot;, various musicians play instruments on it; Mercedes Abal plays the flute, Jeff Bass plays the keyboards, Olu Dara plays the horns and Michael Herring plays the guitar.

===Lyrical themes===
Although guest appearances are made by Kelis, Alicia Keys, and others, &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; is considered to be a personal album, in which he covers lyrical themes of his own emotional experiences. The personal lyrics are a result of Nas&#x27; mother dying less than a year before the album&#x27;s release. He dedicates &quot;Dance&quot; to his mom, and references her in &quot;Warrior Song&quot; and &quot;Last Real Nigga Alive.&quot; &quot;Dance&quot; is considered to be one of Nas&#x27; most introspective tracks, and has been described as &quot;a requiem for Nas&#x27; mother&quot; that &quot;is touching rather than mawkish.&quot; Nas&#x27; lyrics also deal with religion as the album&#x27;s title conveys. He ponders the concept of heaven on &quot;Heaven&quot;, and makes various biblical references to describe himself on &quot;The Cross&quot;. Even with similar themes, each track is distinct from the rest providing &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; with a &quot;narrative sense&quot;. One noteworthy concept track is &quot;Book of Rhymes&quot; where Nas raps songs that he had written in his rhyme book years ago. At times, he stops rapping, and starts commenting on how bad some of his lyrics are amongst other things. According to one writer, &quot;The self-examination that inevitably accompanies the death of a loved one has also provoked a renewed sense of socio-political consciousness in Nas.&quot;

==Singles==

&quot;Made You Look&quot; was released as the first single for &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; on February 12, 2003. It was produced by Salaam Remi and samples &quot;Apache&quot; performed by Incredible Bongo Band. Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic claims that the first single on &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; &quot;announces Nas&#x27; periodic return with fury and bombast&quot; and is a &quot;Marley Marl-fashioned track.&quot; Jon Robinson of IGN.com claims that &quot;Made You Look&quot; shows Nas&#x27; &quot;lyrical genius.&quot; Additionally, Ethan Brown of &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, says it to be &quot;extraordinarily powerful.&quot; It was the second most successful single for &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; reaching at number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It reached at number 16 and number 47 in &quot;Singles of the Year&quot; lists from &quot;Blender&quot; magazine and Pitchfork, respectively. &quot;Q&quot; magazine also ranked it as the 903rd best song ever in 2003, and &quot;Blender&quot; followed suit, ranking it as the 185th best song from the 1980s to the 2000s in 2005.

The second and most successful single, &quot;I Can&quot;, was released as early as March 4, 2003, internationally. It boasts production from Salaam Remi, who samples from &quot;Für Elise&quot; by Ludwig van Beethoven and &quot;Impeach the President&quot; by The Honey Drippers for the song&#x27;s beat. Its lyrics are positive, encouraging the youth to stay drug-free, and pursue their dreams. The lyrics also detail various events in African history, but Christian Hoard of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine labels &quot;I Can&quot; as &quot;a silly stay-in-school ad attached to a Beethoven sample.&quot; This comment may be attributed to the &quot;singsongy&quot; call and response chorus featuring the voices of young children. Other reviewers appreciated &quot;I Can&quot; more: Jon Robinson of IGN.com claims that on his second single, &quot;Nas delivers some of his most inspiring lyrics to date.&quot; &quot;I Can&quot; received significant commercial success, reaching #12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #7 on the Rhythmic Top 40 charts.

The third and final single, &quot;Get Down&quot; was released in July 2003. Produced by Salaam Remi and Nas, it samples James Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Boss&quot;, the percussion from James Brown&#x27;s &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; and &quot;Rock Creek Park&quot; by The Blackbyrds. Its lyrics detail 3 loosely described criminal stories from different locations. The first story takes place in New York City, New York, where an alleged criminal steals the gun of a court officer, and starts shooting. The 2nd story deals with cocaine dealers from Tennessee who provide Nas with a laced blunt. The final story takes place in Los Angeles where Nas goes to a violent funeral in Crenshaw with his cousin, and later kills 3 people. The stories are linked together by a speech from Salaam Remi that implies that black people will never &quot;get up&quot; if they &quot;get down&quot; in crime. Christian Hoard of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; considers &quot;Get Down&quot; to be the best song on &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot;, as does columnist Serena Kim of &quot;Vibe&quot;. The single was not a significant commercial success, and it failed to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

==Critical reception==

&quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; was released to acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 18 reviews. AllMusic and IGN place it below &quot;Illmatic&quot; and &quot;Stillmatic&quot;. Despite calling the production &quot;lukewarm&quot;, Pitchfork&#x27;s Sam Chennault lauded Nas&#x27; verbal ability, describing him as &quot;technically stunning&quot; as an emcee, as well as &quot;rhythmically versatile and intellectually astute.&quot; Chennault also compared &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; to Nas&#x27; debut album, writing that the former has more emotional depth than &quot;Illmatic&quot;, and stating &quot;In many ways, &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; is lyrically superior to &quot;Illmatic&quot;. Nas has created an album that is at once mournful and resilient, street-savvy and academic.&quot; Serena Kim of &quot;Vibe&quot; gave the album a 4 out of 5 disc-rating and stated &quot;He&#x27;s disarmingly self-deprecating here, and gives us a rare look into his artistic process&quot;. Ethan Brown of &quot;New York&quot; praised Nas&#x27; lyricism and found its musically significant, stating:

In a mixed review, Ta-Nehisi Coates of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; criticized Nas for abandoning his role as &quot;rap&#x27;s foremost observer&quot; for &quot;the ballad of the learned thug&quot; and stated, &quot;Nas has rendered himself mediocre. At his worst, he becomes a Tupac clone content to contemplate hackneyed hip-hop , like whether there is a heaven for gangsters (see &#x27;Thugz Mansion N.Y.&#x27;). A more apt question is whether there is a heaven for a cliché, because several cuts on &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; are begging for funerals.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; commented that &quot;Nas&#x27; heart is in the right place, but his mind is somewhere else entirely&quot;, adding that &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; follows what &quot;we were &quot;really&quot; waiting for&quot;, &quot;The Lost Tapes&quot;. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; editor Brett Berliner stated, &quot;Honestly, if Nas had chosen to drop about 4 tracks and cut it down to &quot;Illmatic&quot;″s 10, it would be in the class of &quot;Stillmatic&quot;, and we’d be talking about it as Nas’ 4th classic.&quot; However, Berliner viewed that Nas&#x27; performance makes up for the album&#x27;s flaws, commenting that &quot;Nas stays poignant, clever and intelligent, and, in doing so, adds an extra incentive to purchase his album: simply put, he&#x27;s the best lyricist in Rap today, maybe all time. Specifically, his consistency is such that he has the ability to save poorly produced songs with his rhymes alone.&quot;

In his consumer guide for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention (), indicating &quot;an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure.&quot; Christgau cited &quot;Book of Rhymes&quot; and &quot;Get Down&quot; as highlights and quipped, &quot;confessions of a mama&#x27;s boy, tales of a hustler, lies of a mortal man&quot;. Despite criticizing it for its &quot;boring-ass filler&quot;, Christian Hoard of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; lauded Nas&#x27; &quot;talent&quot; throughout the album, and stated &quot;he may yet have another masterpiece in him. Either way, he&#x27;s hip-hop&#x27;s Comeback Playa of the Year.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; named &quot;Made You Look&quot; the ninth best single of 2003. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; number 52 on its Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. &quot;Kludge&quot; included it on their list of best albums of 2002. The website aggregator Metacritic ranked it as the 25th best-reviewed album of 2002. Henry Adaso of About.com cited &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; in retrospect as the one album where Nas shows &quot;growth and maturity&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; debuted at #18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with first week sales of 156,000 copies, ultimately peaking at number 12. It sold 630,000 copies in its 3 weeks within the Top 20 of the chart. It reached #1 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and was certified Platinum in sales on January 14, 2003, by the RIAA. Additionally, its three singles performed well on the charts. &quot;I Can&quot; was a Rhythmic Top 40 and Top 40 Mainstream hit that peaked #12 on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Made You Look&quot; peaked #32 on the Hot 100 singles chart, while &quot;Get Down&quot; peaked at #76 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart. The success of its singles allowed &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; to obtain Platinum RIAA status.

==Impact==
After the releases of &quot;Ether&quot; and &quot;Stillmatic&quot;, Nas gained renewed respect and acclaim as the best rapper in New York, also known as the &quot;King of New York&quot;. &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot; was a chance for Nas to either reassure his prolific status or prove to be an inconsistent artist. In a review of &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot;, Joseph Jones of PopMatters stated:

On &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot;, Nas referenced his feud with Jay-Z on various tracks. Most notably, Nas references Jay-Z&#x27;s attacks on Nas &quot;Last Real Nigga Alive&quot; as &quot;sneak attack[s]&quot; while he was caring for his mother. This track also revealed roots of his feud with Jay-Z including his feud with The Notorious B.I.G. In fact, Nas ends the first verse of &quot;Last Real Nigga Alive&quot; by saying, &quot;There&#x27;s more shit than wanting to be this King of New York shit.&quot; Similarly, on &quot;Mastermind&quot;, Nas says: &quot;This King Of New York shit only last 15 minutes.&quot; Additionally, on &quot;The Cross&quot;, Nas explained how he was the old king of New York Rap, and soon reinvented himself to reign again as New York&#x27;s king. Amy Linden of Yahoo! Music found it to be an album &quot;worthy of [Nas&#x27;] landmark 1994 debut&quot; &quot;Illmatic&quot; and elaborated on &quot;God&#x27;s Son&quot;″s significance at the time, stating &quot;If this is the last round with Jay, as the surprisingly civil tone and anti-battle messages imply, then God&#x27;s Son is going out on top.&quot;

<text>Attilio Joseph &quot;Teo&quot; Macero (October 30, 1925 – February 19, 2008) was an American jazz record producer, saxophonist, and composer. He was a producer at Columbia Records for twenty years. Macero produced Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; and Dave Brubeck&#x27;s &quot;Time Out&quot;, two of the best-selling and most influential jazz albums of all time. Macero was known for his innovative use of editing and tape manipulation unprecedented in jazz and proving influential on subsequent fusion, experimental rock, electronica, post-punk, no wave, and acid jazz.

==Biography==
===Early work===
Teo Macero was born and raised in Glens Falls, New York, United States. After serving in the United States Navy, he moved to New York City in 1948 to attend the Juilliard School of Music. He studied composition, and graduated from Juilliard in 1953 with Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s degrees.

In 1953, Macero co-founded Charles Mingus&#x27; Jazz Composers Workshop, and became a major contributor to the New York City avant-garde jazz scene. As a composer, Macero wrote in an atonal style, as well as in third stream, a synthesis of jazz and classical music. He performed live, and recorded several albums with Mingus and the other Workshop members over the next three years, including &quot;Jazzical Moods&quot; (in 1954) and &quot;Jazz Composers Workshop&quot; (in 1955).

During this time, Macero also recorded &quot;Explorations&quot; (DLP-6). While he had contributed compositions to other albums, this was the first full album of his own compositions, and Macero&#x27;s first album as a leader. Macero plays tenor and alto saxophones on the album, and is joined by Orlando DiGirolamo on accordion, both Mingus and Lou Labella on basses, and Ed Shaughnessy on drums. &quot;Explorations&quot; was originally released in 1954 on Mingus&#x27; Debut Records, and was reissued on CD in 2006 on Fresh Sounds Records, with additional tracks.

The 1958 short experimental film &quot;Bridges-Go-Round&quot; by filmmaker Shirley Clarke featured two alternative soundtracks, one by Louis and Bebe Barron and one by Macero.

===Composer and arranger===
Macero&#x27;s first projects for Columbia included one side of &quot;What&#x27;s New?&quot;, an album of original music in the emerging Third Stream genre that was shared with Bob Prince as well as arrangements for the first Johnny Mathis album.

Macero continued to compose and arrange for a variety of artists during his time as a producer at Columbia, contributing tracks to (and still producing) several albums including Monk&#x27;s &quot;Monk&#x27;s Blues&quot;, and &quot;Something New, Something Blue&quot;, a collection of blues compositions and arrangements by Macero, Teddy Charles, Manny Albam, and Bill Russo. He contributed a track to (and produced) John Lewis and Gunther Schuller&#x27;s Orchestra U.S.A. album, &quot;Sonorities&quot;, an album of third stream compositions, and he arranged music for easy listening pioneer, André Kostelanetz.

He composed, conducted, and produced numerous television and film soundtracks and scores. He scored the 1970 Muhammad Ali documentary, &quot;a.k.a. Cassius Clay&quot;, and produced soundtrack music for &quot;True Romance&quot;, &quot;Finding Forrester&quot;, and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Blues&quot;.

Macero also composed for, conducted, and performed with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Salt Lake Symphony, the Kansas City Symphony, and the Juilliard School; and was commissioned by, and composed ballets for, the Joffrey Ballet Company, the Anna Sokolow Ballet Company, the London Ballet Company, the Juilliard Ballet Company, and the American Ballet Theatre.

===Columbia Records producer===
Macero found greater fame as a producer for Columbia Records. He joined in 1957, and produced hundreds of records while at the label, working with dozens of artists including Charles Mingus, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Thelonious Monk, Johnny Mathis, Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Tony Bennett, Charlie Byrd, Maynard Ferguson, Stan Getz, Andre Kostelanetz and Les and Larry Elgart. He was also responsible for signing Mingus, Monk, and Byrd to Columbia. Additionally, Macero produced over 100 albums of classical orchestral music for Columbia, including less conventional, contemporary pieces such as &quot;And God Created Great Whales&quot; by Alan Hovhaness, which required him to overlay recordings of humpbacked whale songs on to the orchestral track.

Macero produced the seminal Dave Brubeck Quartet album &quot;Time Out&quot;, and Thelonious Monk&#x27;s first Columbia recording, &quot;Monk&#x27;s Dream&quot;, as well as his &quot;Underground&quot;. He also produced Mingus&#x27; first Columbia album, &quot;Mingus Ah Um&quot;. Macero is also acknowledged on the 1973 Mingus album &quot;Let My Children Hear Music&quot;, for &quot;his untiring efforts in producing the best album I have ever made.&quot; Beyond jazz, he was an associate producer on a number of Broadway original cast recordings including &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; and &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;. And he produced the soundtrack to &quot;The Graduate&quot;, by Simon and Garfunkel. In another deviation from his standard focus on jazz, Macero produced Irish folk albums with the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem in the late 1960s.

While Macero produced many artists&#x27; albums, he had an especially long and prolific relationship with Miles Davis. He produced or co-produced most of Davis&#x27; Columbia catalog including the classics &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot; and &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot;. Macero&#x27;s role of producer was further expanded on Davis&#x27; later forays into electric fusion, such as &quot;In a Silent Way&quot;, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, and &quot;A Tribute to Jack Johnson&quot;, which were highlighted by Macero&#x27;s innovative mixing and editing techniques. In 2001, Miles Davis biographer Paul Tingen likened Macero&#x27;s role in the electric music of Davis to that of George Martin with the Beatles. Taking his cue from Tingen, Nick Southall described the impact of Macero&#x27;s work on &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; in a 2003 &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; article:
Behind the scenes, Miles and Teo took the tapes of the &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; sessions and transformed some beautiful, folk-tinged, melody-driven sets into two exquisite, beguiling and otherworldly pieces of music. Using techniques that pre-dated the proliferation of tape loops, cut-ups, edits and sequencing in rock, pop, hip hop and dance music, Miles and Teo took apart the original recording and reassembled them outside of any traditional or accepted jazz structure or melodic framework. This idea of taking jazz away from its birth, genesis and flowering as a live art and into the studio would soon become standard practice, but in 1969 it was groundbreaking.
Some listeners and critics have complained that Macero overproduced Davis&#x27; recordings, and cut too much. But after hearing the unedited tapes from the &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; sessions, jazz critic John Ballon wrote that the original editing and production &quot;attests to the producing genius of Teo Macero.&quot; Ballon continues:

It took a force like Teo to splice together a cohesive album out of so many inspired pieces. Not only did Teo have the balls to stand up to Miles on creative decisions, he had the right. And Miles knew it. And while his ego rebelled against any producer messing with his music, Miles knew that incredibly great records were borne out of the conflict and compromise of his relationship with Teo.
On Davis&#x27; 1970 release &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, Macero continued to expand his innovative practices, and &quot;&quot;Bitches Brew&quot; not only became a controversial classic of musical innovation, it also became renowned for its pioneering use of studio technology.&quot; Some of the controversy at the time also stemmed from the use of the word &quot;bitches&quot; in the title. Macero recalls that when Davis told him that he wanted to call it &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, &quot;I thought he was kidding.&quot; The album became the best-selling jazz album of its time, selling 500,000 copies by 1976, when most successful jazz albums sold less than 30,000 copies.

Macero produced &quot;M.F. Horn 3&quot; for Maynard Ferguson in 1973 as well as Ferguson&#x27;s next album in 1974, &quot;M.F. Horn 4&amp;5: Live At Jimmy&#x27;s&quot;. On that album, Ferguson can be heard thanking Macero, noting that Macero &quot;is sitting out in the street in the mobile thing&quot; monitoring the recording. The album includes the piece &quot;Teonova&quot; in Macero&#x27;s honor.

Macero&#x27;s innovative techniques were inspired partially by his association with avant-garde composer Edgard Varèse, and they continue to impact the way musicians, producers, and remixers work in the studio today. Brian Eno, a producer who has worked extensively with U2 and Talking Heads, among others, talked about Macero&#x27;s influence on him in a 1996 interview with &quot;jazzthetik&quot; magazine. Eno describes being &quot;fascinated&quot; by Macero&#x27;s editing techniques and the &quot;spatial&quot; quality he added to the music. &quot;He did something that was extremely modern.&quot;

In 1975, Macero left Columbia and formed his own production company. However, he continued to work with Davis until 1983 and continued to produce records for Columbia throughout his career.

===Other work===
After his tenure at Columbia, Macero continued as a player and producer on other projects, working with Brubeck, Tony Bennett, Herbie Hancock, Asha Puthli, Michel Legrand, Wallace Roney, Shirley MacLaine, Vernon Reid, Robert Palmer, and DJ Logic.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Macero released a handful of his own albums, including &quot;Time Plus Seven&quot;, &quot;Impressions of Charles Mingus&quot;, and &quot;Acoustical Suspension&quot;, before founding his own label, Teorecords, in 1999. Subsequently, he released over a dozen albums of original compositions, and continued to produce reissues of Miles Davis and other artists for various record companies. However, Macero was outspoken in his opposition to the practice of adding back alternate takes that didn&#x27;t appear on the original albums, or otherwise altering the original music, on the grounds that it corrupts the intentions of the musicians and the producer at the time the recording was made. &quot;They put all the mistakes back in,&quot; said Macero. &quot;Don&#x27;t destroy the original record.&quot;

===Films===
A Teo Macero documentary film, &quot;Play That, Teo&quot;, is being directed and produced by Olana DiGirolamo, daughter of Macero&#x27;s friend and collaborator, Orlando DiGirolamo. Shot by cinematographer Fortunato Procopio, the film features a behind-the-scenes look at the person behind the persona, and includes photos, archival footage, and recordings from Macero&#x27;s personal collection.

A short film, &quot;Teo&quot;, was filmed by producer/director Daragh McCarthy and features Teo Macero&#x27;s last recording session and extensive interviews.

===Tributes===
Both Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk dedicated a song titled &quot;Teo&quot; to Macero: Davis in the 1961 album &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot;, Monk in the 1964 album &quot;Monk&quot;. The song &quot;Teonova&quot; (Dedicated to Teo Macero), written by Pete Jackson, appears on the 1974 Maynard Ferguson album &quot;M.F. Horn 4&amp;5: Live At Jimmy&#x27;s&quot;, produced by Macero.

==Death==
On the evening of February 19, 2008, Macero died in his sleep, having long suffered from pneumonia. He was 82.

<text>The APS underwater assault rifle () is an underwater firearm designed by the Soviet Union in the early 1970s. It was adopted in 1975. Made by the Tula Arms Plant () in Russia, it is exported by Rosoboronexport.

Under water, ordinary bullets are inaccurate and have a very short range. The APS fires a , 5.66 mm calibre steel bolt specially designed for this weapon. Its magazine holds 26 rounds. The APS&#x27;s barrel is not rifled; the fired projectile is kept in line by hydrodynamic effects; as a result, the APS is somewhat inaccurate when fired out of water.

The APS has a longer range and more penetrating power than spearguns. This is useful in such situations such as shooting an opposing diver through a reinforced dry suit, a protective helmet (whether air-holding or not), thick tough parts of breathing sets and their harnesses, and the plastic casings and transparent covers of some small underwater vehicles.

The APS is more powerful than a pistol, but is bulkier, heavier and takes longer to aim, particularly swinging its long barrel and large flat magazine sideways through water.

==History==
The rising threat of attacks by frogmen in naval bases caused various anti-frogman techniques to be developed. In the USSR, one of these techniques was guard frogmen sent to stop the attackers. At first these guard frogmen were armed only with knives and AK-type rifles. The rifle was carried in a waterproof case and could be used only on the surface, so the only effective underwater weapon against enemy frogmen was the knife.

The SPP-1 underwater pistol was accepted in 1971, but soon proved to be useful for close-up self-defence rather than in attacking more distant targets. Vladimir Simonov undertook the job of developing an underwater assault rifle. To allow the rifle&#x27;s mechanism to work under water, there had to be room for the flow of the water pushed aside by moving parts and by the gas produced by the propellant explosive in the cartridge. The APS rifle was accepted for use in the mid-1970s. One special improvement was a perforated gas tube, and in the sighting. Its design engineer received a state award in 1983.

As with the SPP-1 the first stage of the work was to develop a cartridge. A by cartridge was lengthened by about to fit the sharp-fronted steel bolt. Another cartridge version was designed that contained a miniature rocket, which when fired makes a visible streak in the water. Next, Vladimir Simonov designed the rifle. The objective was ambitious; nobody had ever before tried to build a functioning automatic underwater firearm. The most important problem was designing a receiver that could work under water. Water is essentially incompressible, so the structure had to let water move around easily; as a result, its receiver is open at the rear. Since it operates on the principle of gas discharge, it has a gas controller to let it work both underwater and on land.

The APS was adopted in the mid-1970s. Afterwards, there was lengthy improvement work on the APS. One improvement was fitting a perforated gas pipe with a special shield to break up the emitted gas bubbles, making targeting easier and reducing the visibility of the bubbles, allowing stealthier firing of the weapon.

The APS was the primary weapon of Soviet frogmen and Serbian river flotilla frogmen.

However, since the conception of this new weapon there were objections. It was the perfect weapon for the Soviet frogmen&#x27;s underwater operations, but it was less useful for Spetsnaz soldiers fighting both on land and underwater. The APS can operate on land, but its effective range does not exceed 50 metres, and the rifle&#x27;s lifetime drops to 180 shots in air from 2,000 shots underwater. Therefore, they mostly carried a SPP-1 pistol for self-defence under water and an AK-74 to fight on land. At the end of the 1980s the ASM-DT amphibious rifle was developed.

<doc id="1099707" wikidata="Q21662569" url="?curid=1099707" title="Teeth blackening">
<text>Teeth blackening or teeth lacquering is a custom of dyeing one&#x27;s teeth black. It was most predominantly practiced in Southeast Asian and Oceanic cultures, particularly among Austronesian, Austroasiatic, and Kra–Dai-speaking peoples. It was also practiced in Japan prior to the Meiji era, as well as in India. It was also performed among some groups in the Americas, most notably among the Shuar people of northern Peru and Ecuador.

Teeth blackening is usually done during puberty. It was seen as a sign of maturity, beauty, and civilization. A common belief is that blackened teeth differentiated humans from animals. Teeth blackening is often done in conjunction with traditions of tooth sharpening and dental evulsion, as well as other body modification customs like tattoos. Teeth blackening and filing were regarded with fascination and disapproval by early European explorers and colonists. 

The practice survives in some isolated ethnic groups in Southeast Asia and Oceania but has mostly disappeared after the introduction of Western beauty standards during the colonial era. It is mainly prevalent in older women, though the practice is still carried on by some younger women. Sometimes artificial teeth are used to achieve blackened teeth.

Teeth blackening is commonly confused with the red-stained teeth from betel chewing. However, betel chewing damages the teeth and gums, while teeth blackening does not.

==East and Southeast Asia==
===Japan===

In Japan, teeth blackening is known as . existed in one form or another for hundreds of years, and was seen amongst the population as beautiful until the end of the Meiji period (1868–1911). Objects that were pitch black, such as glaze-like lacquer, were seen as beautiful.

====Name====
The word was an aristocratic term. There is an alternate term for , . At the old Imperial palace in Kyoto, it was called . Among civilians, such words as , and were used.

====History====
Traces of blackened teeth can be seen in the buried bones and of the Kofun period (300–538 CE). References to exist in &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; and . At the end of the Heian period, at the time when aristocratic men and women reached puberty and celebrated their or , the Taira clan and other samurai, and pages working at large temples, dyed their teeth using kanemizu, a solution made from ferric acetate, created from soaking iron filings in vinegar, and tannins, derived from vegetables or tea. The Imperial family and other high-ranking aristocrats who had finished their (ceremony where a child is fitted with a ) blackened their teeth and painted their eyebrows (). This was done in the Imperial household until the end of the Edo era.

In the Muromachi period (1336–1573), was generally seen among adults, though when the Sengoku period (1467–1615) began, so as to prepare for political marriages of convenience, when the daughters of military commanders were around 8 to 10 years old, they would blacken their teeth as a marking of their coming of age. Relatives and guardians of the bride who blackened their teeth were called . It is said that military commanders who were struck in the head on the battlefield and who did not want to be ugly would wear average women&#x27;s makeup and would blacken their teeth. These faces imitated the Noh masks of women and young boys.

After the Edo period (1603–1867), only men of the Imperial House of Japan and the aristocracy blackened their teeth. Due to the odor and labor required for the process, as well as a feeling among young women that they were ageing, was done only by married women, unmarried women who were older than 18, sex workers and geisha. For rural people, was done only at times of special celebrations, such as Japanese festivals, wedding ceremonies, and funerals. There were also depictions of in fairy tales, such as &quot;Gon, the Little Fox&quot;.

On February 5, 1870, the government banned and the process gradually became obsolete. After the Meiji period, it temporarily spread, but it almost entirely died out in the Taishō period (1912–1926).

In contemporary times, the only places where can be seen is in plays, on some older apprentice geisha, some festivals, and movies.

=== Vietnam ===

==== History ====


In Vietnam, teeth blackening (Vietnamese: nhuộm răng) was practiced by the majority Vietnamese people as well as by minority ethnic groups such as the men of Si La people who paint their teeth red while the women paint theirs black. These traditions declined in the 20th century, decade by decade with each new generation with in part due to Western influence from French colonists, colonial medical reports from the 1930s, stated that 80 percent of Tonkinese farmers had darkened teeth. Archaeological discovery show that teeth blackening was practiced as early as 400 BCE. Teeth blackening was seen as a sign of beauty. It was also a demonstration of civilization, as there was an idea that white teeth belonged to animals, savages, and evil spirits. In the 1920s, most women in Hanoi had blackened teeth.

==== Process ====
The process of teeth blackening begins with the sanitisation of the mouth, this was done by brushing the teeth with a mixture of dried betel, stewed charcoal powder, and salt. Before dyeing the teeth, the person who was dyeing had to chew and rinse their teeth with a rice wine-lemon juice mixture to prepare the surface of the teeth for dyeing. This part of the process is often very painful as it causes the gums to become swollen. A solution of burnt coconut shells is then used on the teeth to dye it. Other solutions that were used to dye the teeth black also included an iron solution.

==== Accounts ====
A passage in a 16th century biography of a Korean trader that went to Vietnam, Jowanbyeokjeon (), also mentions these customs,

Another passage in the 12th century Chinese book, Lingwai Daida () notes that, 

In the 17th century book, An Nam chí nguyên (), it also records,

In the 17th century book, A Description of the Kingdom of Tonqueen by Samuel Baron, notes

The 16th century Ming dynasty book Shuyu Zhouzi Lu () which recorded history and customs of foreign nations around China had a section regarding teeth blackening in Vietnam,

During a brushtalk between Korean envoy (I Sangbong; Korean: 이상봉; Hanja: 李商鳳) and Vietnamese envoy (Lê Quý Đôn; chữ Hán: 黎貴惇) on 30 December 1760, I Sangbong mentioned the Vietnamese custom of teeth blackening that he observed in Lê Quý Đôn and the other Vietnamese envoys.
During the Ming dynasty&#x27;s conquest during the Ming–Hồ War, the Ming dynasty attempted a serious effort to assimilate the Vietnamese by ordering them to wear long hair and to stop teeth blackening so they could have white teeth and long hair like Chinese. The Vietnamese people were ordered to stop cutting and instead grow their hair long and switch to Han Chinese clothing in only a month by a Ming officials. Ming administrators said their mission was to &quot;civilize&quot; the unorthodox, by Han Chinese standards, appearance of the Vietnamese. 

After regaining independence, a royal edict was issued by Vietnam in 1474, forbidding Vietnamese from adopting foreign languages, hairstyles and clothes like that of the Lao, Champa or the &quot;Northerners&quot; which referred to the Ming. The edict was recorded in the 1479 Complete Chronicle of Dai Viet of Ngô Sĩ Liên.

==== Literature ====
There is also a famous exhortation by emperor Quang Trung (1753–1792) before a battle with the Qing army where he mentions the customs of the Vietnamese people including teeth blackening,

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, Spanish colonial official and historian, Antonio de Morga, recorded in his book, (1609), on how local men and women of the Philippines cared and presented themselves at the time. It was noted by Morga:

The late 19th century Filipino nationalist, writer, and polymath, José Rizal, commented in his annotations to Morga&#x27;s account that: &quot;This custom still exists... This custom exists also among the married women of Japan, as a Sign of their chastity. It is now falling into disuse.&quot;

===Thailand===
In Thailand, teeth darkening was an established symbol of beauty, achieved for centuries with a paste called , and love poems used to compare the dyed teeth of the beloveds to ebony and other valuable woods. When the 19th-century Thai king Mongkut lost his teeth, he replaced them with artificial teeth carved from dark red sappan wood.

===Eastern India=== 
Colouring teeth black was a tradition practised by various tribes of Eastern Himalayas, Naga Hills and Manipur in India, such as the Konyak Nagas and the Wancho Nagas.

===Other areas===
Teeth blackening has been documented throughout a number of other peoples in Asia and Oceania:

==South Asia==
Teeth blackening was also documented across Islamic culture in South Asia:

There is also evidence of the use of in India among some practitioners of Hinduism, mainly to blacken the gums and sometimes the teeth; the 16th century poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi dedicated some lines in his epic poem &quot;Padmavat&quot; to the smile of the princess Rani Padmini, who ruled Chittorgarh in the 13th century, in which he compares her teeth to diamonds on black pedestals:

==Africa==
Further West, teeth blackening has been documented as far as Madagascar.

<doc id="1099709" wikidata="Q1420905" url="?curid=1099709" title="Hilbert's Theorem 90">
<text>In abstract algebra, Hilbert&#x27;s Theorem 90 (or Satz 90) is an important result on cyclic extensions of fields (or to one of its generalizations) that leads to Kummer theory. In its most basic form, it states that if &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is an extension of fields with cyclic Galois group &quot;G&quot; = Gal(&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;) generated by an element formula_1 and if formula_2 is an element of &quot;L&quot; of relative norm 1, that isformula_3then there exists formula_4 in &quot;L&quot; such thatformula_5The theorem takes its name from the fact that it is the 90th theorem in David Hilbert&#x27;s Zahlbericht , although it is originally due to . 

Often a more general theorem due to is given the name, stating that if &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is a finite Galois extension of fields with arbitrary Galois group &quot;G&quot; = Gal(&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;), then the first cohomology group of &quot;G&quot;, with coefficients in the multiplicative group of &quot;L&quot;, is trivial:

:formula_6

== Examples ==
Let formula_7 be the quadratic extension formula_8. The Galois group is cyclic of order 2, its generator formula_9 acting via conjugation:

:formula_10

An element formula_11 in formula_12 has norm formula_13. An element of norm one thus corresponds to a rational solution of the equation formula_14 or in other words, a point with rational coordinates on the unit circle. Hilbert&#x27;s Theorem 90 then states that every such element &quot;a&quot; of norm one can be written as

:formula_15

where formula_16 is as in the conclusion of the theorem, and &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are both integers. This may be viewed as a rational parametrization of the rational points on the unit circle. Rational points formula_17 on the unit circle formula_14 correspond to Pythagorean triples, i.e. triples formula_19 of integers satisfying formula_20.

==Cohomology==
The theorem can be stated in terms of group cohomology: if &quot;L&quot;× is the multiplicative group of any (not necessarily finite) Galois extension &quot;L&quot; of a field &quot;K&quot; with corresponding Galois group &quot;G&quot;, then

:formula_6

Specifically, group cohomology is the cohomology of the complex whose &quot;i-&quot;cochains are arbitrary functions from &quot;i&quot;-tuples of group elements to the multiplicative coefficient group, formula_22, with differentials formula_23 defined in dimensions formula_24 by:
formula_25
where formula_26 denotes the image of the formula_27-module element formula_28 under the action of the group element formula_29.
Note that in the first of these we have identified a 0-cochain formula_30, with its unique image value formula_31. 
The triviality of the first cohomology group is then equivalent to the 1-cocycles formula_32 being equal to the 1-coboundaries formula_33, viz.:
formula_34
For cyclic formula_35, a 1-cocycle is determined by formula_36, with formula_37 and:formula_38On the other hand, a 1-coboundary is determined by formula_39. Equating these gives the original version of the Theorem. 
A further generalization is to cohomology with non-abelian coefficients: that if &quot;H&quot; is either the general or special linear group over &quot;L&quot;, including formula_40, then formula_41 Another generalization is to a scheme &quot;X&quot;:

:formula_42

where formula_43 is the group of isomorphism classes of locally free sheaves of formula_44-modules of rank 1 for the Zariski topology, and formula_45 is the sheaf defined by the affine line without the origin considered as a group under multiplication. 

There is yet another generalization to Milnor K-theory which plays a role in Voevodsky&#x27;s proof of the Milnor conjecture.

==Proof==
Let formula_7 be cyclic of degree formula_47 and formula_9 generate formula_49. Pick any formula_50 of norm 

:formula_51

By clearing denominators, solving formula_52 is the same as showing that formula_53 has formula_54 as an eigenvalue. We extend this to a map of formula_55-vector spaces via

:formula_56

The primitive element theorem gives formula_57 for some formula_58. Since formula_58 has minimal polynomial 

:formula_60

we can identify

:formula_61 

via 

:formula_62 

Here we wrote the second factor as a formula_63-polynomial in formula_58.

Under this identification, our map becomes

:formula_65

That is to say under this map 

:formula_66

formula_67 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue formula_54 iff formula_2 has norm formula_54.

<doc id="1099714" wikidata="Q2308917" url="?curid=1099714" title="Spellbound (Paula Abdul album)">
<text>Spellbound is the second studio album by American singer Paula Abdul, released on May 14, 1991, via Virgin Records and Captive Records. Production was handled by Peter Lord, Paisley Park, V. Jeffrey Smith, Don Was, and Jorge Corante.

The album, although receiving mixed reviews citing that it showcased her limitations as a singer, became a commercial and topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, alongside cracking the top-ten in Australia, Canada, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Six singles in total were released, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number one singles &quot;Rush Rush&quot; and &#x27;The Promise of a New Day&quot;, the latter becoming her sixth and to-date final number one single. Other singles included the US top-ten hit &quot;Blowing Kisses in the Wind&quot;, &quot;Vibeology&quot;, which Abdul performed at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards, &quot;Will You Marry Me?&quot;, and the Canada exclusive single &quot;Alright Tonight&quot;. The album is currently certified 3x platinum in the United States.

Following the release of the album, Abdul embarked on her first world tour, entitled &quot;Under My Spell Tour&quot;, between 1991 and 1992.

&quot;Spellbound&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. The album art was art directed by Melanie Nissen, designed by Inge Schaap, and lettered by Margo Chase.

==Critical reception==
Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne gave the album a C+ and remarked that its overproduction only highlights Abdul&#x27;s limitations as a singer. In a retrospective review for &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, Eric Henderson gave the album four out of five stars. He commented that, despite being uneven, the album makes Abdul &quot;sound like a human being&quot;. In 2003, Slant Magazine included &quot;Spellbound&quot; in its list of &quot;50 Essential Pop Albums&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in its first week and rose four spots to number one the following week. It stayed at the summit for two consecutive weeks, selling 88,000 and 89,000 units respectively. The album distinguished itself by becoming the lowest selling number-one album in the Nielsen SoundScan era at the time of its release—a distinction it held until 2004, when Outkast&#x27;s &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below&quot; sold 86,000 copies while at number one. This was primarily due to the newly implemented SoundScan tracking system, which had not been implemented into every major music chain, thus sales were not entirely accurate. Nevertheless, the album became a best-seller and emerged as the best selling album for the month of June, spending 16 weeks within the top 10, and was certified three-times platinum by the RIAA in January 1992. Overall, the album spent 70 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was ranked as the 18th best-charting of the year 1991 (and 40th best-charting of the year 1992).

<text>Shatarupa () is the daughter of the creator deity, Brahma. According to &quot;Brahma Purana&quot;, Shatarupa is regarded as the first woman to be created by Brahma, marrying Manu, the first man. Their descendants are called &quot;manushya&quot;, the Sanskrit term for mankind.

== Literature ==
The Bhagavata Purana mentions the birth of Shatarupa, and her marriage to Manu:

In other texts, it is the manasaputra, the mind-born children of Brahma, who are believed to have created the first man, Svayambhuva Manu, and the first woman, Shatarupa.

Shatarupa marries Svayambhuva, and the couple had five children — two sons, Priyavrata and Uttānapāda, and three daughters, Ākūti, Devahūti, and Prasuti. Manu handed over his first daughter Ākūti to the sage Ruci, the middle daughter, Devahūti, to the Prajapati Kardama, and the youngest, Prasūti, to Daksha.

<text>Eric Graham Varley, Baron Varley, (11 August 1932 – 29 July 2008) was a British Labour Party politician and cabinet minister on the right-wing of the party. He was the Member of Parliament for Chesterfield from 1964 to 1984.

==Early life==
Eric Graham Varley was born in Poolsbrook, Derbyshire, to Frank and Eva (née Goring) Varley. His father was a coalminer. He left school at the age of fourteen in 1946. His mother did not wish for him to follow his father&#x27;s line of work, and he began an early career at the iron works before training as an engineer. He was an accomplished football player as a young man who played semi-professionally. He initially aspired to play professionally, and it was speculated that he could have done so. However, he decided to start a career in politics, partially at the behest of trade unionist Bert Wynn.

==Political career==
Varley was active in the National Union of Mineworkers, and became a branch secretary of the union in 1955, joining the Labour Party the same year. After a period at Ruskin College, Varley won the NUM nomination to be the Labour candidate for his home town, where the sitting Labour Member of Parliament (MP) George Benson was retiring from Parliament. He was narrowly selected in June 1963 and duly held the Chesterfield seat in the 1964 election.

Despite rebelling against the government&#x27;s application to join the Common Market in 1967, Varley became an Assistant Whip later that year, and Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister Harold Wilson in November 1968. He served briefly as a junior minister under Tony Benn at the Ministry of Technology from 1969. During the Labour Party&#x27;s period of opposition in the early 1970s, Varley was Chairman of the Trade Union Group of MPs, and became spokesman on fuel and power.

Varley was appointed Secretary of State for Energy when Labour returned to power in 1974, and was the cabinet&#x27;s youngest member. The appointment of an NUM-sponsored MP helped the government end the NUM strike which had led the previous government to ration electricity to three days a week. Varley subsidised the National Coal Board and chose a British design for new nuclear power stations over an American rival. He also began the procedure to nationalise North Sea oil. 

During the Common Market referendum he advocated a &#x27;No&#x27; vote but was not prominent in the campaign. Immediately afterwards Wilson swapped Varley&#x27;s and Benn&#x27;s posts, so that Varley was effectively promoted to Secretary of State for Industry. In November 1976 Varley suffered an embarrassing public defeat when he determined to shut down the loss-making Chrysler car factory: the Cabinet forced him to increase its subsidy to keep it open. He continued the government&#x27;s slow nationalisation programme by appointing Michael Edwardes to take over at British Leyland.

When Labour went into opposition in 1979, Varley was elected to the Shadow Cabinet in fifth place. He led Denis Healey&#x27;s campaign for the party leadership in 1980 and defeated the left-winger Norman Atkinson for the post of party Treasurer (an office he had coveted for some years) in 1981. He served as opposition spokesman on employment, and resisted an attempt by Michael Foot to replace him with Neil Kinnock (whom he disliked) in 1982.

After Kinnock&#x27;s election as party leader in 1983, Varley announced that he would retire from Parliament at the next general election. However, he ended up leaving before then, as he was appointed as Chairman of Coalite plc, a private company manufacturing coal-based products including a coke-like smokeless fuel of the same name. He resigned his seat in January 1984. Ironically, this opened the way for Tony Benn to return to the House of Commons as Varley&#x27;s successor in the seat. Varley served five years at Coalite, until the company was acquired in 1989, and subsequently held other directorships, including as a regional director for Lloyds Bank. Following a Labour Party nomination, he was created a life peer on 30 May 1990 taking the title Baron Varley, of Chesterfield in the County of Derbyshire.

==Personal life==
In 1955, Varley married Marjorie Turner, and they had one son. 

Varley was a Methodist. He lived in Walton, Chesterfield, and was known for maintaining an elaborate garden at his home. He died from cancer at his residence on 29 July 2008, at the age of 75.

<doc id="1099742" wikidata="Q646783" url="?curid=1099742" title="Feast of Fools">
<text>The Feast of Fools or Festival of Fools (Latin: &quot;festum fatuorum&quot;, &quot;festum stultorum&quot;) was a feast day on January 1 celebrated by the clergy in Europe during the Middle Ages, initially in Southern France, but later more widely. During the Feast, participants would elect either a false Bishop, false Archbishop, or false Pope. Ecclesiastical ritual would also be parodied, and higher and lower-level clergy would change places. The lack of surviving documents or accounts, as well as changing cultural and religious norms, has considerably obscured the modern understanding of the Feast, which originated in proper liturgical observance, and has more to do with other examples of medieval liturgical drama, though there is some connection with the earlier pagan (Roman) feasts of Saturnalia and Kalends or the later bourgeois in Sotie. Over the course of a week, the ceremonies would be led by different people in positions of power within the church. On December 26, St. Stephen&#x27;s Day, the deacons led the ceremonies. The sub-priests (or vicars) were in charge on December 27, St. John&#x27;s Day, the choirboys on December 28, Holy Innocents’ Day, and the sub-deacons on the first of January, the Feast of the Circumcision. There is some disagreement on whether the term Feast of Fools was originally used to refer to the collection of days or specifically the celebrations taking place on the first of January. The word &quot;fool&quot; is used as a synonym for humble, as was common in the 11th century, rather than the modern use that treats it as another term for clown or jester.

== Origins ==
Due to the lack of formal research on the feast, its exact origin is hard to pin down. The most prominent historians place its emergence in Central Europe, somewhere in what is now southeast France, but the margin of error is such that it could have been with France, Italy, or the Holy Roman Empire. Some historians believe a possible start of the feast came between 1119 and 1124, alongside Ordo Rachelis plays as part of the liturgy for Innocents Day (28 December) was Herod games (ludi) as unscripted plays as embellishments of King Herod&#x27;s involvement that were led by Gerhoh of Reichersberg. These games focused around the alleged absurdity of King Herod, a Jewish-Roman ruler of Judea, and was practiced by storming a cathedral, throwing wooden spears at the choir, and beating by-standers with inflated animal bladders. This is thought to be the start of Feast of Fools since King Herod was coming into vogue in the 11th and 12th centuries, with a notable uptick in the number of plays and pieces being performed about him. Another story that lends strength to the theory of the feast coming from events and plays based on King Herod is his story from the Herod game Office of the Star. The story claims that Herod, who was king of what is now south-Israel/Palestine, including Bethlehem, around the nativity of Jesus, learned of Christ&#x27;s birth and, concerned that a new born king would challenge his own rule of the area, ordered the murder of every new-born boy in his kingdom. The story claims that the murder of Jesus was prevented by King Herod&#x27;s own page-boys, who then gained God&#x27;s favor. This is pointed to as the explanation for the reversal of positions with clerical rank during the Feast of Fools, with a God holding page-boys in high regard and not caring for a king. This focus on King Herod is a potential explanation of why the feast did not spread nor survive as long as other festivals, as it was essentially born out of a trend in contemporary medieval theatre. Also this was during the medieval theatre historical backdrop of the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Catholic Church&#x27;s discouragement of theatre for being pagan and immoral only to later have their own Christian liturgical dramas like mystery plays such as Ordo Rachelis and passion plays.

The first recorded mention of the feast from the Church comes from between 1160 and 1164 in Paris and was written by John Beleth. He explained how sub-deacons, who it had recently been decided to be the lowest of the highest clerical orders rather than the highest of the lower clerical order, were meant to preside over the Feast of the Circumcision, but that the exact details of the feast hadn&#x27;t been formalized yet. It is theorized that this, in combination of the page-boy and King Herod story, is where the tradition of swapping positions within the church came from, showing how God favors the socially low.

== Context and customs ==
The festival seems to have acted as a brief social revolution, in which power, dignity, and impunity was briefly granted to those in a subordinate position. In the views of some historians, this makes the medieval festival a successor to the Roman Kalends of January, although there is no continuity between the two celebrations. Lower-level clergy would also participate in the festival and hold masses on different day which would mock usually church traditions.

On each day of festivities, the participants would elect a single one of them, often referred to as the Archbishop of Fools, and they would carry and wear the items associated with that rank, in addition to gaining the powers normally associated with that position. The meaning of the festival, beyond serving as a chance for joy like any other holiday, was to show that those with power and wealth would eventually fall from grace.

Similar to modern day celebrations like Carnival and Mardi Gras, dancing in a provocative style, wearing masks, and the community being generally more allowing of obscene acts was common place. Additionally, Mardi Gras celebrations include serving of the King Cake or Gallette de Rois, which contains a small token. In earlier times, the person getting the token was crowned as king, and was expected to host the next gathering. Usually celebrated around Epiphany, it is considered a continuation of the ancient Roman Saturnalia where masters would host for their slaves.

== Official condemnation ==
The Feast of Fools and the subversive traditions associated with it were the object of condemnations of the medieval Church, starting as early as the twelfth century. On the other hand, some Catholic writers have thought it necessary to try to deny the existence of such abuses. One interpretation that reconciles this contradiction is that, while there can be no question that Church authorities of the calibre of Robert Grosseteste repeatedly condemned the license of the Feast of Fools in the strongest terms, such firmly rooted customs took centuries to eradicate. It is certain that the practice lent itself to serious abuses, whose nature and gravity varied at different epochs. It should be said that among the thousands of European liturgical manuscripts the occurrence of anything which has to do with the Feast of Fools is extraordinarily rare. It never occurs in the principal liturgical books, the missals and breviaries. There are traces occasionally in a prose or a trope found in a gradual or an antiphonary. It would therefore seem there was little official approval for such extravagances, which were rarely committed to writing.

In order to curb the extremeness of the festivities after the Feast of Fools, on New Year&#x27;s Day at Notre-Dame de Paris in the twelfth century, the &quot;Lord of Misrule&quot; or &quot;Precentor Stultorum&quot; was restrained, so that he was to be allowed to intone the prose &quot;Laetemur gaudiis&quot;, and to wield the precentor&#x27;s staff, but this was before the first Vespers of the feast, not during it, though the festival was not entirely banned. During the second Vespers, it had been the custom that the precentor of the fools should be deprived of his staff when the verse in the Magnificat, &quot;Deposuit potentes de sede&quot; (&quot;He has put down the mighty from their seat&quot;) was sung. Hence the feast was often known as the &quot;Festum &#x27;Deposuit&#x27;&quot;. Eudes de Sully allowed the staff to be taken at that point from the mock precentor but laid down that the verse &quot;Deposuit&quot; not be repeated more than five times. There was a similar case of a legitimized Feast of Fools at Sens about 1220, where the whole text of the office has survived. There are many proses, and interpolations (&quot;farsurae&quot;) added to the ordinary liturgy, but nothing much unseemly. This prose, or &quot;conductus&quot;, was not a part of the office, but only a preliminary to Vespers. In 1245 Cardinal Odo, the papal legate in France, wrote to the Chapter of Sens Cathedral demanding that the feast be celebrated with no un-clerical dress and no wreaths of flowers.

== End of the Feast ==
The Feast of Fools was officially forbidden by the Council of Basel in 1431 and again in a document issued by the theological faculty of the University of Paris in 1444; numerous decrees of lower level provincial councils followed. The Feast of Fools was condemned by early Protestants, and among Catholics it seems that the abuse had largely disappeared by the time of the Council of Trent, though instances of festivals of this kind survived in France as late as 1721, in Amiens, France, and Brussels, Belgium in 1719.

== Connections to other holidays ==

* Prior to the creation of the Gregorian Calendar in 1582, most European nations celebrated New Year&#x27;s Day on March 25. Since the celebrations of the Feast of Fools generally took place over a week or so, this would cause them to end on April 1. Those who refused to, or forgot to, change to the new calendar system would be ridiculed as April Fools.
* Due to them all taking place in the post-Christmas season, this festival, the Feast of the Ass, and the Feast of the Circumcision all grew more entangled over the centuries. As a result of fusing with the Feast of the Ass, when the church forbade the festivities from taking place within churches instead of dressing up as high-ranking members of the Church, they instead wore hats to resemble donkey ears.
* Much of the customs in the Feast of Fools have been incorporated into modern-day Carnival, Mardi Gras, and Halloween.

== In popular culture ==
Victor Hugo offers an account of a Feast of Fools in his 1831 novel &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;, celebrated on January 6, 1482 (Twelfth Night) when Quasimodo serves as the Pope of Fools. The 1939 film adaptation of the novel opens with the Feast of Fools, where Quasimodo is crowned King of Fools. In Disney&#x27;s 1996 animated film of the novel, the Feast is shown during with the song &quot;Topsy Turvy&quot;.

The Feast of Fools and the Church of Rome&#x27;s efforts to ban it play important roles in Alan Gordon&#x27;s series of historical novels about the (fictional) Fools&#x27; Guild at the turn of the 12th to the 13th centuries. (Not to be confused with the modern Fools Guild.)

== Historiography ==
Possibly as a result of it dying out in the 1700&#x27;s and possibly as a result of it never spreading as much as other celebrations, there is a lack of research works based specifically upon the Feast of Fools. The first major work was done by Jean Bénigne Lucotte du Tilliot in 1741, titled &quot;Memoires pour servir à l’histoire de la fête des foux: Qui se faisoit autrefois dans plusieurs eglises.&quot; The first half of the work was effectively a collection of primary sources related to the feast while the second part of the work focused on Infanterie Dijonnaise, a confraternity that he was trying to prove had its beginnings in the feast. The second major work wouldn&#x27;t come until 1903, written by E.K Chambers and titled &quot;The Mediaeval Stage.&quot; Chambers focused heavily on the feasts potential pagan origins, almost writing off its litigurical origins completely. The last major work was &quot;Sacred Folly: A New History of the Feast of Fools&quot; done by Max Harris in 2011 and is now considered to be the default resource for information on the feast. Harris&#x27;s work argues against nearly everything Chambers stated, instead claiming that the feast has pagan, Christian, and secular roots, its secular roots still being tied back to religious plays.

<text>Thomas Hartwig Wolff (July 14, 1954, New York City – July 31, 2000, Kern County) was an American mathematician, working primarily in the fields of harmonic analysis, complex analysis, and partial differential equations. As an undergraduate at Harvard University, he regularly played poker with his classmate Bill Gates. While a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley from 1976 to 1979, under the direction of Donald Sarason, he obtained a new proof of the corona theorem, a famously difficult theorem in complex analysis. He was made Professor of Mathematics at Caltech in 1986, and was there from 1988–1992 and from 1995 to his death in a car accident in 2000. He also held positions at the University of Washington, University of Chicago, New York University, and University of California, Berkeley.

He received the Salem Prize in 1985 and the Bôcher Memorial Prize in 1999, for his contributions to analysis and particularly to the Kakeya conjecture. He was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1986 in Berkeley and in 1998 in Berlin.

<doc id="1099756" wikidata="Q6237554" url="?curid=1099756" title="John Hancock Building">
<text>Four buildings in Boston, Massachusetts, have been known as the &quot;John Hancock Building.&quot; All were built by the John Hancock Insurance companies. References to &quot;the&quot; John Hancock building usually refer to the 60-story, sleek glass building on Clarendon Street also known as the John Hancock Tower or Hancock Place.

==176–178 Devonshire Street==
The first John Hancock Building was built on Devonshire Street in 1891. It was designed by William G. Preston. On October 2, 1919, the building was purchased by the First National Bank of Boston. In 1922, it was one of the buildings torn down to make way for the new First National Bank building. This building was torn down in 1971 and replaced by One Federal Street.

== 120 Franklin Street, Stone &amp; Webster Building==
In 1909, John Hancock began work on a new addition to the building on the corner of Franklin and Devonshire Streets. The addition was designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge in the French Renaissance architecture style. The &quot;H type&quot; design allowed for almost every office to have outside windows. Each floor contained marble flooring and wainscoting as well as a fireproof bank vault. The Wells Bros. Co. of New York City were the general contractors. John Hancock occupied the top three floors of the ten-story building and the Library Bureau, Eliot National Bank of Boston, and E. H. Rollins &amp; Sons were among the first tenants. The addition gave the building frontage on Devonshire Street (176–200 Devonshire St.), Franklin Street (120 Franklin St.), and Federal Street (49–75 Federal Street). On January 3, 1920, the remainder of the building was purchased by Massachusetts Trust Company, which renamed it the Massachusetts Trust Company Building. In 1926 the building was purchased by Stone &amp; Webster and became known as the Stone &amp; Webster Building. In 1965, the First National Bank purchased the building with plans to construct their new headquarters there. The Stone &amp; Webster Building was torn down once Stone &amp; Webster moved out. The property was acquired by National Shawmut Bank, which constructed a temporary building to aid in their transition to One Federal Street. The temporary building was torn down and replaced by One Federal Street.

==197 Clarendon, Stephen L. Brown Building (1922)==
The next John Hancock building was designed by Parker, Thomas and Rice, best known as architects of the United Shoe Machinery Corporation Building. It was completed in 1922. It is located at 197 Clarendon St. across from the Hancock tower. It was known as the &quot;John Hancock Life Insurance Company Building.&quot; Parker, Thomas and Rice received the Harleston Parker Medal for its design in 1924. More recently, it was known as &quot;The Clarendon Building&quot;, and circa 2001 it was renamed &quot;The Stephen L. Brown Building&quot; in honor of Stephen L. Brown, chairman of John Hancock Financial Services, Inc. According to Donlyn Lyndon, &quot;if you stand on the corner of Clarendon Street and St. James Avenue and look directly into the mirrored surface of the third Hancock, you will see reflected there the first two, aligned hierarchically in an ethereal family portrait.&quot;

Originally, the Planned Development Area (PDA) agreement for the building of the 60-story John Hancock Tower called for 197 Clarendon to be demolished to make way for open space or a public square. In 1982, the Boston Redevelopment Authority, responding to a request from the John Hancock company, decided that it would be better to keep the building on the tax rolls. It was also thought that open space near the base of the tower might not be desirable, due to the tower&#x27;s &quot;wind tunnel&quot; effect.

==200 Berkeley Street, Old John Hancock (1947)==
The Berkeley Building (also known as the Old John Hancock Building) is a 26-story, 495-foot (151 m) structure located at 200 Berkeley Street, the second of the three John Hancock buildings built in Boston. The building, located in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay, was designed by Cram and Ferguson and completed in 1947. It is known for the weather beacon at its summit, which displays light patterns as weather forecasts.

==200 Clarendon Street, John Hancock Tower (1976)==
The John Hancock Tower, on the southeast corner of Copley Square, is a 60-story, skyscraper. It was designed by Henry N. Cobb of I. M. Pei &amp; Partners and was completed in 1976. In 1977, the American Institute of Architects presented the firm with a &quot;National Honor Award&quot; for the building, and in 2011 conferred on it the Twenty-five Year Award. It has been the tallest building in Boston for more than 30 years and is the tallest building in New England.

==601 Congress Street==

In 2002, Manulife Financial began construction of a 14-story building in the Seaport District at 601 Congress Street (Picture). The building was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill LLP of Chicago, designers of the John Hancock Center in Chicago and the Sears Tower, also in Chicago. The building features a &quot;green&quot; (energy-efficient) dual glass curtain wall construction, making it among the first buildings in Boston to win national LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification.

On April 28, 2004, the then-head of Manulife&#x27;s Boston operations announced that the building would be renamed the &quot;John Hancock Building.&quot; According to Manulife, this is not quite correct; the building, completed in fall of 2004, will house the John Hancock Wealth Management Group and will bear conspicuous &quot;John Hancock&quot; exterior and interior signage featuring the John Hancock logo. However, the company will refer to the building simply as &quot;601 Congress.&quot;

, Emporis lists the official name of the building as the &quot;Manulife Tower&quot;.

<text>A strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP) is a hypothetical particle that interacts strongly between themselves and weakly with ordinary matter, but could form the inferred dark matter despite this.

Strongly interacting massive particles have been proposed as a solution for the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray problem and the absence of cooling flows in galactic clusters.

Various experiments and observations have set constraints on SIMP dark matter from 1990 onward.

SIMP annihilations would produce significant heat. DAMA set limits with NaI(Tl) crystals.

Measurements of Uranus&#x27;s heat excess exclude SIMPs from 150 MeV to 104 GeV. Earth&#x27;s heat flow significantly constrains any cross section.

<text>Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI; ), is Israel&#x27;s major aerospace and aviation manufacturer, producing aerial and astronautic systems for both military and civilian usage. It has 14,000 employees as of 2021. IAI is state-owned by the government of Israel.

IAI designs, develops, produces and maintains civil aircraft, drones, fighter aircraft, missile, avionics, and space-based systems.

IAI&#x27;s main focus is engineering, aviation and high-tech electronics, though it also manufactures military systems for ground and naval forces. Many of these products are centered on the core needs of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Other offerings are marketed to numerous foreign militaries.

==History==
Israel Aerospace Industries was founded in 1953 as Bedek Aviation Company under the initiative of Shimon Peres, then director general of the Ministry of Defense, in order to maintain Israel Defense Forces aircraft. The company originally had 70 employees and recruited American born aviation expert Al Schwimmer as the company&#x27;s founder and first president.

===First aircraft manufacturing===
In 1959 Bedek began manufacturing its first aircraft, a V-tailed twinjet trainer of French design, the Fouga CM.170 Magister, locally called &quot;Tzukit&quot; (monticola). The &quot;Tzukit&quot; became the Israeli Air Force principal trainer for 50 years. The IAI Tzukit was also used in the 1967 Six-Day War by 147 Squadron as a close support aircraft, attacking targets on the Egyptian front during the first day of the war, when Israel&#x27;s more capable combat aircraft were deployed against Arab air bases and aircraft. They were then deployed against Jordanian forces, including armour, on the West Bank. The Magister proved effective at the close-support mission albeit with heavy casualties, with six being lost.

The first aircraft to be fully designed and built by IAI, the IAI Arava short take-off and landing transport aircraft, first flew in 1969 after three years of development.

===The French embargo impact===

In response to the French embargo, IAI began developing its own fighter aircraft, a derivative of the Mirage 5 called the IAI Nesher (&quot;hawk&quot;), in 1968. The Nesher entered service in 1971, in time for the Yom Kippur War. The Nesher was followed by the IAI Kfir (&quot;lion cub&quot;), which was developed as a result of Israel&#x27;s need for adapting the Dassault Mirage III to the specific requirements of the Israeli Air Force. The Kfir entered service with the IAF in 1975, the first units being assigned to the 101st &quot;First Fighter&quot; Squadron. Over the following years, several other squadrons were also equipped with the new aircraft. The Kfir&#x27;s first recorded combat action took place on 9 November 1977, during an Israeli air strike on a training camp at Tel Azia, in Lebanon. The only air victory claimed by a Kfir during its service with the IAF occurred on 27 June 1979 when a Kfir C.2 shot down a Syrian MiG-21.

The IAI Kfir has been exported to Colombia, Ecuador, Sri Lanka and was leased to the US Navy and the US Marine Corps from 1985 to 1989, to act as adversary aircraft in dissimilar air combat training.

===Diversification===
In 1969 IAI acquired North American Rockwell&#x27;s Jet Commander series of business aircraft. This became the basis for the IAI Westwind line. Work on an improved Westwind – named the Astra – began in the late 1970s by stretching the fuselage and designing a new swept wing, with the first prototype flight occurring on 19 March 1984. The first production Astra flew on 20 March 1985, FAA certification came on 29 August 1985 and customer deliveries started in 1986.

In the 1960s, IAI developed the Gabriel anti-ship missile and the Elta Electronics Industries subsidiary developed an inexpensive aircraft radar which would become a successful export item. In the 1970s IAI developed the Dabur class patrol boat.

In the 1970s IAI also entered the Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) market with the development of the IAI Scout. In 1984, IAI formed a joint venture with rival Israeli company Tadiran to market both companies&#x27; UAV&#x27;s, the Tadiran Mastiff and the IAI Scout.

====Developing the maintenance, repair and overhaul business====
By 1980s the original Bedek maintenance business was conducting extensive overhauls on dozens of different aircraft types, working on engines as well as airframes and interiors, IAI could provide more comprehensive refurbishments than even the aircraft manufacturers themselves. The unit had 4,000 employees by the mid-1980s and overhauled a huge range of aircraft, from propeller-driven trainers to airliners; including big civil aviation programs, such as conversion of Boeing 747s to freighters.

===The Lavi program===
In 1980 the Government of Israel decided to use the experience IAI had accumulated to develop and manufacture a modern fighter plane to be the mainstay of the Israel Air Force. The aircraft, called the IAI Lavi, was to be a superior attack aircraft with advanced weapons systems. It had its rollout in July 1986 and successful maiden flight in December 1986.

In August 1987, after extensive government deliberations, the decision was made (by one vote) to cancel the Lavi program, due to the questioning of Israel&#x27;s economic ability to support the cost of such an extensive program. This led to a serious crisis at IAI which necessitated a major reorganization of the company&#x27;s structure and business strategy; the company&#x27;s work force of more than 22,000 people was cut by 5,500 in 1988. However, the Lavi program was credited with developing a number of advanced technologies that IAI was able to market.

===1990s onwardsexport led growth===


By 1989 IAI posted a profit of $11.8 million on sales of $1.28 billion. The company had four divisions—Aircraft, Aviation, Electronics, and Technologies—and 17 factories. IAI was established as a world leader in upgrading aircraft. Planes such as the Vietnam-era McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II were modernized with advanced avionics and weaponry.

In the 1990s IAI entered the space race with the AMOS communications satellites, Ofeq observation satellites and the Shavit space launcher.

In December 1997, the IAI Galaxy, a business jet with an intercontinental range developed as a joint venture Galaxy Aerospace with the Hyatt Corporation, made its first flight and entered service in 2000. In May 2001, General Dynamics&#x27; Gulfstream Aerospace bought IAI&#x27;s Galaxy Aerospace Co. L.P. unit for $330 million, although IAI continues to perform most of the assembly and development of the jets which are marketed by Gulfstream.

In 2003, Israel Aircraft Industries attempted to enter the VLJ (very light jet) Market by launching the Avocet ProJet, a 6–8 seat high utilization air taxi with a list price almost half the cost of the least expensive business jet available at that time. In early 2006, ProJet development stalled after a major undisclosed US OEM pulled out of the program due to unspecified reasons.

The company was working with the Aviation Technology Group on a military trainer version of the ATG Javelin, a fighter style personal jet. The version being developed would have competed against a large field of jet trainers at a much lower cost of acquisition and maintenance. ATG halted development of the Javelin in 2008 due to a lack of funds.

In March 2004 IAI signed a $1.1 billion contract with India to install three EL/W-2090 AWACS systems on Russian-made Ilyushin Il-76 transports, which are based in part on IAI&#x27;s earlier EL/M-2075 Phalcon platform which was developed in the 1990s. In the late 2000s IAI developed the follow-on EL/W-2085 system which is installed on heavily modified Gulfstream G550 aircraft and which besides serving in the IAF were also sold to Singapore and Italy.

On 6 November 2006, IAI changed its corporate name from &quot;Israel Aircraft Industries Ltd.&quot; to &quot;Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd.&quot;; to more accurately reflect the current scope of the firm&#x27;s business activities, which includes not just aircraft, but also systems, satellites and launchers, as well as maritime and ground systems.

On 13 April 2009, the &quot;Moscow Times&quot; reported that the Russian Defense Ministry had signed an agreement with Israel Aerospace to purchase $50 million in pilotless drone aircraft. The contract reportedly includes three types of UAVs manufactured by the company.

In January 2012, IAI announced a sale of $1.1 billion of defense systems to an Asian country. The deal has been signed but the company did not name the buyer. It was reported that the sale will include IAI aircraft, missiles and intelligence technologies.

On 4 September 2012, the Gulfstream G280, a new twin-engine business jet built by IAI, received full certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

IAI is a member of the prestigious Trace International and Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics (SCCE) organizations and recognized in the Transparency International April 2015 report to be in the top third of worldwide defense companies for its ethics and anti-corruption programs.

In April 2018, IAI systems were observed in a film made by the Azerbaijan Army, specifically the IAI Harop loitering munition system, resulting in criticism from the Armenian government concerning the supply of Israeli arms to the Azeri army. In 2019, IAI sells drone defense systems to governments to be placed in sensitive areas such as borders, army bases, or power plans, and provides equipment to shoot down military drones as well. It also sells to clients such as airports looking to protect against consumer drones. IAI in 2019 is Israel&#x27;s major aerospace and defense manufacturer. It released its Popstar system in September 2019, which &quot;can detect and track drones up to 4 km away in day or night&quot;. IAI advised customers in December 2019 not to fly some Boeing 737 freighters it had converted, after IAI said it detected an &quot;apparent irregularity&quot; in the production process. IAI&#x27;s converted 737s had come into service in 2003.

In July 2021, IAI Aviation Group has agreed to establish a passenger to freighter conversion site to convert the B737-700/800 with Atitech (Italy) in Naples.

<text>Bennie Maupin (born August 29, 1940) is an American jazz multireedist who performs on various saxophones, flute, and bass clarinet.

==Biography==
Maupin was born in Detroit, Michigan. He is known for his participation in Herbie Hancock&#x27;s Mwandishi sextet and Headhunters band, and for performing on Miles Davis&#x27;s seminal fusion record, &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;. Maupin has collaborated with Horace Silver, Roy Haynes, McCoy Tyner, Lee Morgan, Marion Brown, and many others. He is noted for having a harmonically-advanced, &quot;out&quot; improvisation style, while having a different sense of melodic direction than other &quot;out&quot; jazz musicians such as Eric Dolphy.

Maupin was a member of Almanac, a group with Cecil McBee (bass), Mike Nock (piano) and Eddie Marshall (drums).

Maupin lost his home, instruments, and other belongings in the Eaton Fire in January 2025.

<doc id="1099786" wikidata="Q259865" url="?curid=1099786" title="Unibroue">
<text>Unibroue is a brewery in Chambly, Quebec, Canada, that was started by Serge Racine and Quebec native André Dion. The company was purchased by Sleeman Breweries Ltd. in 2004, which was itself taken over by Sapporo in 2006.

== History ==

Unibroue was founded by business partners André Dion and Serge Racine who had acquired 75% of La Brasserie Massawippi Inc. of Lennoxville, the initiator of the micro-brewery movement in Québec, in 1990. The two purchased the remainder of the shares at the end of 1991 when they transferred their interest in La Brasserie Massawippi Inc. to Unibroue. The original goal of the two entrepreneurs was to improve distribution for the few emerging craft breweries in Quebec. When other breweries left the project, Unibroue shifted towards brewing entirely. According to Pierre Clermont, a knowledgeable observer of Quebec beer, &quot;since there was a moratorium on brewing licenses, Unibroue bought Massawippi to be able to brew their own beer. By purchasing the brewery, they automatically acquired the brewing license, Br-008.&quot;

By 1992, La Brasserie Massawippi Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Unibroue. Afterward, it changed its corporate name to Brasserie Broubec Inc. and in July 1993 merged with Unibroue. It was bought by Canadian brewer, Sleeman Breweries Ltd., in 2004. Sleeman, in turn, was purchased in 2006 by Sapporo.

== Beers ==
Unibroue makes a wide range of beers; although, there is a focus on Belgian-style brews, such as their &quot;Maudite&quot; (&#x27;Damned&#x27;), &quot;La Fin du Monde&quot; (&#x27;The End of the World&#x27;), and &quot;Don de Dieu&quot; (&#x27;Gift from God&#x27;). Most of Unibroue&#x27;s beers are bottled &quot;on the lees&quot;, or containing yeast sediment (or &quot;lees&quot;). This practice provides additional fermentation, also called bottle-conditioned, after bottling. The result is a beer which ages well if kept in the dark and unrefrigerated, and allows it to be shipped relatively cheaply to international markets. The yeast gives Unibroue beers a cloudy appearance and provides a characteristic element to the taste. On many of their labels, suggested serving temperatures (for example, &quot;better at 12°–14°C&quot;) are included.

Recently, Unibroue shifted to more conventional styles with a series of lighter beer cans inspired by their original, heavier Belgian beers to renew with a younger customer base. Recent addition include &quot;la Petite Maudite&quot;, a brown ale, and &quot;Saison Libre&quot;, a saison light beer. As with its classics brews, recent additions also typically refer to Quebec&#x27;s history and folk traditions.

== Selected beers ==
=== La Fin du Monde ===
&quot;La Fin du Monde&quot; (French for &quot;the end of the world&quot;) is a Belgian-style tripel and bottle conditioned golden ale introduced in July 1994.

=== Saison Libre ===
A 4.0% ABV light Saison beer in reference to Quebec&#x27;s &quot;Quiet Revolution&quot; in the sixties.

=== Blanche de Chambly ===
&quot;Blanche de Chambly&quot; is a 5% ABV Belgian-style wheat beer (&quot;witbier&quot;), introduced in 1992, which has won many medals since.

== Awards ==
La Fin du Monde has been the winner of many medals of excellence: 5 platinum, 6 gold, and 1 silver from the Beverage Testing Institute since its introduction in 1994. In 2004 it won the gold medal at the Los Angeles County Fair for Belgian-Style Abbey Ale.

Don de Dieu has won four gold medals from the Beverage Testing Institute since its introduction in 1998.

Grande Reserve 17 received the &quot;World&#x27;s best dark ale&quot; award at the World Beer Awards in London, England in 2011. Also, it received a Platinum medal from the Beverage Testing Institute in 2009, 2010, and 2011.

Unibroue has won several awards in subsequent years too, at the World Beer Awards. In 2015, for example, the company&#x27;s products received many accolades. La Fin du Monde was declared World&#x27;s Best Belgian Style Tripel, La Résolution and Éphémère Poire (pear), La Résolution won The Americas&#x27; Best Belgian Style Strong and Éphémère Poire was named The Americas&#x27; Best Fruit Flavored Beer. The Unibroue 17 Grande Réserve was declared The Americas’ Best Vintage Dark Beer and the company won three gold medals for Terrible, Maudite, Éphémère Pomme, three silver medals for Blanche de Chambly, Trois Pistoles, Noire de Chambly, and a bronze medal for Blonde de Chambly.

At the 2016 Awards, the company won the following World&#x27;s Best awards: Belgian Style Strong Dark, Unibroue Trois Pistoles and Belgian Style Tripel, Unibroue La Fin Du Monde. Conventional awards for Unibroue products included Belgian Style Strong Dark - Silver Medal, Fruit &amp; Vegetable Flavoured Beer - Silver Medal, Belgian Style Witbier - Gold Medal.

<text>The Prince Motor Company (Japanese: ) was an automobile marque from Japan which eventually merged into Nissan in 1966. It began as the Tachikawa Aircraft Company, a manufacturer of various airplanes for the Japanese Army in World War II, e.g., the Ki-36, Ki-55 and Ki-74. Tachikawa Aircraft Company was dissolved after the war and the company took the name Fuji Precision Industries. It diversified into automobiles, producing an electric car, the Tama, in 1946, named for the region the company originated in, Tama, using the Ohta series PC/PD platform. The company changed its name to Prince in 1952 to honor Akihito&#x27;s formal investiture as Crown Prince of the nation. In 1954 they changed their name back to Fuji Precision Industries, and in 1961 changed the name back again to Prince Motor Company. In 1966, they became part of Nissan, while the Prince organization remained in existence inside Nissan, as &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot; in Japan until Nissan consolidated the Prince dealership network into &quot;Nissan Blue Stage&quot; in 1999.

==Products==
Prince had success building luxury automobiles. Among its most famous car lines were the Skyline and Gloria, both of which were absorbed into the Nissan range and continued after their 1966 merger; however, Prince also built the 15-passenger Homy which was eventually shared with the Nissan Caravan and the Nissan Laurel, a four-door sedan platform mate with the Skyline, on which Prince had begun development before the merger but was introduced after the merger in 1968. Prince had also begun development on a small car to compete with the Toyota Corolla and Nissan Sunny, but after the merger, the car was introduced as the Nissan Cherry using front wheel drive.

The former Nissan Gloria and the Nissan Skyline are known in the US as the Infiniti M (2003 - 2004), the Infiniti G (2003 - 2006), and the Infiniti Q50 (2013+).


==Model designation system==
Up to 1961, Prince used a four-letter model code for its vehicles. The first letter stood for the engine code (A was 1500 cc, B was 1900 cc), the second letter stood for the chassis model, the third letter stood for the body type (S for sedan, T for cabover truck, V for van, P for pickup truck and so on) and the fourth letter was the order of production. A fifth letter was sometimes added, and this was the model version (S for standard, D for deluxe). A number was added to the end to delineate revisions of the same model. This number was a Roman numeral until 1956, after which it was an Arabic numeral.

From 1962, Prince switched to an alpha-numeric code, similar to what Nissan would eventually use.

==History==

The Prince Motor Company had two origins.
===Tachikawa Aircraft Company===
*December 1946 - The electric car division of the Tachikawa Aircraft Company became independent and was activated as the Fuchu Plant of the Kosoku Kikan Kogyo Co., Ltd..
*June 30, 1947 - The Fuchu Plant of the Kosoku Kikan Kogyo Co., Ltd. became the Tokyo Electric Car Company. (Official foundation date of the Prince Motor Company.)
*February 1949 - Shojiro Ishibashi invested in the Tokyo Electric Car Company and became the chairman.
*November 30, 1949 - The Tokyo Electric Car Company changed its name to Tama Electric Car Company.
*November 1951 - The Tama Electric Car Company changed its name to Tama Motor Company.
*November 1952 - The Tama Motor Company changed its name to Prince Motor Company.
*April 10, 1954 - The Prince Motor Company merged with its engine supplier Fuji Precision Industries. The new company was named Fuji Precision Industries and the name Prince Motor Company disappeared in the meantime.

===Nakajima Aircraft Company===
*August 16, 1945 - The Nakajima Aircraft Company changed its name to Fuji Sangyo Co., Ltd..
*November 6, 1945 - The GHQ defined Fuji Sangyo as the Zaibatsu and decided to disband them.
*May 1950 - Fuji Sangyo Co., Ltd. was disbanded.
*July 1950 - Fuji Sangyo Co., Ltd. was divided into twelve companies. Of them, the Tokyo Plant (located in Suginami, Tokyo) and the Hamamatsu Plant became Fuji Precision Industries.
*April 1951 - Shojiro Ishibashi became the chairman of Fuji Precision Industries.
*April 10, 1954 - Fuji Precision Industries merged with its customer Prince Motor Company. The new company was named Fuji Precision Industries and the name Prince Motor Company disappeared in the meantime.

===After Merger of Fuji/Prince Until Merger with Nissan===
*February 1961 - Fuji Precision Industries changed its name to Prince Motor Company. (The name &quot;Prince Motor Company&quot; revived.)
*1962 - Prince became the first Japanese car company to field a works team in a European rally, the Liège-Sofia-Liège. Neither of the two Skylines entered finished the rally, which had an 82 percent attrition rate.
*May 1965 - Prince Motor Company announced the merger with Nissan Motor Company.
*August 1966 - Merged into Nissan Motor Company.

==List of vehicles==
* Prince Sedan (the first passenger car of Prince)
* Prince Gloria (a luxury sedan &amp; wagon)
* Prince Skyline (a performance coupe/sedan)
** Prince Skyway (a delivery van based on the Skyline)
** Prince Miler (a pickup truck based on the Skyline)
** Nissan Laurel (a compact luxury sedan/coupe based on the Skyline)
* Prince Homy (a cargo van/minibus)
** Prince Homer (a pickup truck based on the Homy)
* Prince R380 (a race car)
* Nissan Prince Royal (a limousine made for the Imperial Household of Japan)
* Nissan Cherry (a small front-wheel-drive coupe and sedan)
* Prince Clipper (a cabover truck)
** Prince Light Coach (a large capacity passenger bus shared with the Clipper)

===Concept vehicles===
* 1956 Prince BNSJ: Displayed at the 1956 Tokyo Motor Show, the BNSJ was much larger compared to other Japanese cars of the era and was the first non-production prototype (concept) displayed at the Tokyo Motor Show. It was powered by the FG4A-20 engine, but was enlarged to 1.9L. The BNSJ never entered production.
* 1956 Prince DPSK: The DPSK was developed as part of Japan&#x27;s &quot;National Car&quot; program of 1955, similar to the German program that resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle. The proposal called for a 4-seater with an engine of 350 cc to 500 cc, a weight of around and a top speed of . The DPSK was powered by a rear-mounted 24 hp, 601cc two-cylinder boxer engine known as the FG2D. This engine suffered from vibration and noise problems and was later replaced with a 599cc, 36 hp four-cylinder boxer engine called the FG4C and the car became the CPSK. Prince persevered with this concept until 1959 when the National Car program was cancelled, likely due to Prince becoming a more upscale quality car manufacturer.
* 1963 Prince 1900 Sprint: Based on the Skyline 1500, the Sprint was designed by Scaglione of Italy and powered by the 1.9L GB-4 engine from the Gloria. The Sprint was shown at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show, but did not enter production.

<text>Steve Penk is a British radio and television presenter. He was born in Rusholme in Manchester and attended Hazel Grove High School. At the age of 16, he started his radio career at Piccadilly Radio in 1978 (subsequently rebranded Key 103), where his breakfast show delivered record ratings, the highest in the station&#x27;s history to this day.

In 1997, Penk moved on to work at Capital Radio London, presenting the mid-morning show. On his programme he regularly did his famous radio wind-ups. It was during one of these wind-up calls that Penk had the idea to call the then British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Penk was able to get through the No. 10 switchboard and managed to get Blair on the air for a few minutes. Blair later mentioned during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions that Penk had prank-called him that morning, and at that point it became a global media story.

In 2001, Penk moved to Virgin Radio, where he replaced Chris Evans on the breakfast show and increased the audience by 300,000 listeners in the first three months. Penk then returned to Capital FM in 2002 to present a networked late show.

After a year presenting the late show on Capital Radio, networked to a number of other stations, Penk returned to Manchester&#x27;s Key 103; however, he left at the end of 2006. Penk returned to the airwaves on Fox FM in Oxfordshire in March 2007 as its new breakfast show presenter. However, he announced on 15 January 2008 he would be leaving the station by March 2008 due to &quot;internal politics&quot;.

He also presented a number of primetime TV Shows for ITV, such as &quot;TV Nightmares&quot;, &quot;The Way They Were&quot; and &quot;When Athletes Attack&quot;. Penk made guest appearances on &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; and a few series of &quot;TV&#x27;s Naughtiest Blunders&quot; on ITV1.

On Thursday 4 September 2008, it was announced that Penk had bought the entire share capital in the radio station 96.2 the Revolution. Almost immediately after the purchase, Penk made major changes both to the schedule and to the playlist. The changes led to outrage from some listeners to the station and departure of some of the station&#x27;s DJs. However, after changing the station&#x27;s format Penk managed to quadruple the audience.

In January 2014, he sold 96.2 the Revolution. In 2015, Penk launched the Steve Penk Wind-Up Channel on DAB+ in Manchester, featuring wind-up/prank calls 24/7.

In 2016, Penk created and launched Radio Dead, a globally unique radio station that only plays artistes who are deceased. Penk closed Radio Dead, along with another internet based station that he owned, at the end of November 2019.

In 2019, he started a podcast of his BBC Radio 4 Extra series &quot;Radio Nightmares&quot;, featuring mistakes and bloopers from all types of radio broadcasting across the world.

He stood in on the 10pm Saturday night show on Greatest Hits Radio in June 2021.

<text>The third USS &quot;Murray&quot; (DD/DDE-576) was a in the United States Navy during World War II. &quot;Murray&quot; was named for Capt. Alexander Murray and his grandson Rear Adm. Alexander Murray

&quot;Murray&quot; (DD-576) was laid down on 16 March 1942 by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Orange, Texas and launched on 16 August 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Frank T. Leighton. The ship was commissioned on 20 April 1943.

==Service history==
=== World War II ===
After shakedown in the Caribbean, &quot;Murray&quot; served on escort duty in the Atlantic Ocean, then sailed to join Destroyer Squadron 25 at Pearl Harbor in September 1943. Sailing with a carrier task force, &quot;Murray&quot; took part in strikes on Wake Island 5–6 October, then voyaged to the South Pacific to support the landings on Bougainville 8–9 November, splashing three enemy aircraft. Two days later, while covering US 3rd Fleet aircraft carriers in a strike against Rabaul, &quot;Murray&quot; shot down two of a force of about 150 enemy aircraft attacking her formation.

Hewing to a demanding pace of operations, &quot;Murray&quot; was on antisubmarine patrol in the Gilbert Islands from 20 November to 8 December during the occupation of Tarawa and Abemama, then for the next month guarded shipping into the newly acquired islands. In January 1944 &quot;Murray&quot; performed outstandingly in fire support missions for the capture of Kwajalein, then screened transports carrying invasion forces to Eniwetok. Two months of escort duty in the western ocean routes followed, until she joined in the bombardment of Kavieng, New Ireland, 20 March.

Joining the 7th Fleet &quot;Murray&quot; took part in the assault on Aitape, New Guinea, 23 to 28 April, downing another enemy aircraft during an aerial torpedo attack. Rejoining the 6th Fleet in June, she screened amphibious craft during the assault on Saipan, then sailed to Guam for close-in fire support and transport screening duty 20 July to 26th. After patrol and escort duties for the consolidation of the Mariana Islands until late in August, &quot;Murray&quot; returned to the continuing operations around New Guinea. She bombarded Wewak 30 August to cover British minelaying operations, and in September covered the landings on Morotai. Returning to Hollandia, she prepared for the invasion of the Philippines, sortieing in escort of the transports for Leyte. On 20–21 October, she conducted shore bombardment, moving in as close as reefs would allow to fire over the landing force into enemy installations and at the same time aiding in repelling enemy air attacks.

Departing the Philippines immediately after the landings &quot;Murray&quot; overhauled at San Francisco, California, then in January 1945 escorted a battleship division to Pearl Harbor while en route to join Task Force 58. She screened the aircraft carriers and acted as picket during the first carrier raid on Tokyo 16 February and attacks on Iwo Jima and the Ryukyu Islands 26 February to 1 March, sinking a Japanese picket ship about 200 miles off the coast of Japan on 26 February. &quot;Murray&quot; next prepared for the Okinawa operation, during which she screened battleships from submarine attack during the initial preinvasion bombardment. Hit by a Japanese bomb 27 March, she retired to Pearl Harbor for repairs.

While returning to the forward areas by way of Eniwetok, &quot;Murray&quot; was ordered 2 July to locate, board, and search Japanese hospital ship &quot;Takasago Maru,&quot; bound for Wake Island and suspected of carrying arms or supplies, contraband for a hospital ship. She located the ship the next day, but search revealed nothing in violation of international law, so the hospital ship was allowed to proceed to Wake to embark sick and wounded Japanese.

Rejoining her force, now Task Force 38, &quot;Murray&quot; guarded the fast carriers in the raids against Honshū, Hokkaidō, and Kyūshū through the last 2 months of the war. In one of the most daring raids of the war, &quot;Murray&quot; and others of her squadron penetrated Suruga Bay, Honshū, 30 July to bombard the city of Shimizu, perhaps the deepest penetration of Japanese waters by any surface craft during the war.

=== After World War II ===
One of the initial occupation force, &quot;Murray&quot; became the first ship in empire waters to bring in a Japanese submarine when the enemy undersea fleet began to surrender. On 27 August, aircraft of TF 38, patrolling off Honshū, located a submarine flying the black flag designated as the surrender signal, and &quot;Murray&quot; was ordered to intercept and take the craft into Tokyo Bay for internment. Her boarding party received the swords of ″s officers that same day, and the submarine was escorted to the mouth of Sagami Bay. &quot;Murray&quot; was present in Tokyo Bay for the formal Japanese surrender 2 September, then 3 days later sailed for the United States. Inactivated at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, &quot;Murray&quot; decommissioned 27 March 1946, and went into reserve at Charleston, South Carolina.

=== Korean War years ===
In June 1951, &quot;Murray&quot; began conversion to an escort destroyer, for which she had been designated DDE-576 on 2 January 1951. She recommissioned at Charleston 16 October 1951.
Early in 1952, &quot;Murray&quot; began East Coast and Caribbean training operations from her home port, Norfolk. She also served periodically as plane guard during carrier qualification of naval aviation cadets off Pensacola, Florida. In June 1953, she sailed for her first deployment to the Mediterranean, serving in the hunter killer force of the 6th Fleet. Her 1954 tour was marked by an extension to northern European ports. In 1956, &quot;Murray&quot; operated with and participated in a NATO convoy escort exercise in European waters. During much of 1956 she underwent yard overhaul, then in 1957 sailed round Cape of Good Hope for patrol duty in the Persian Gulf, the usual access to which was blocked by the closing of the Suez Canal the previous autumn. With the canal free later in the spring, she joined the 6th Fleet in Mediterranean operations through August.

Between March 1958 and May 1961 &quot;Murray&quot; formed part of Task Group Alfa, an experimental development group working in antisubmarine warfare. The group usually operated off the Virginia Capes, but in the summers of 1959 and 1960 participated in the annual summer NROTC midshipmen training cruises, voyaging to Canadian ports and Bermuda.

=== 1960s ===
In late May 1961, &quot;Murray&quot; was one of the rescue ships stationed along the route of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s flight to Paris, then participated in that summer&#x27;s midshipmen cruise. Redesignated DD-576 on 30 June 1962, &quot;Murray&quot; rejoined TG Alfa for its development operations, which were interrupted for participation in the Cuban Quarantine in October and November 1962 that forced Soviet missiles out of Cuba and averted grave international complications. At 1633 on 27 October 1962, the &quot;Murray&quot; Deck Log contains the following entry: &quot;Sonar contact bearing 212 2,000 yards.&quot; The &quot;Murray&quot; sonar gang classified the contact as a possible submarine After several hours of &quot;ping time&quot; at 2050 hours the same date the &quot;Murray&quot; Deck Log contains the following additional entry: &quot;Submarine surfaced bearing 080, 3,900 yards. 4 hours and 17 minutes after initial contact by this ship at LAT 27-36N, LONG 65-56.5W.&quot; Thus &quot;Murray&quot; was the first U.S. Navy destroyer to gain and hold contact with the first of three Soviet submarines forced to surface during the Cuban Missile Crisis. After training off New England early in 1963, &quot;Murray&quot; returned to Caribbean patrols then came north for the midshipmen cruise.

&quot;Murray&quot; sailed 29 November 1963 for her first 6th Fleet deployment in six years, visiting French, Spanish, and Italian ports before returning to Norfolk 23 May 1964. She cleared Norfolk again 8 September for NATO Arctic operations, crossing the Arctic Circle 21 September, and visiting Amsterdam before returning to Norfolk 23 October.

Decommissioned in May 1966 at Norfolk, &quot;Murray&quot; was struck from the Navy list 1 June 1966, and sold for scrapping to Boston Metals Co., Baltimore, Maryland, in 1966.

&quot;Murray&quot; received 11 battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Edward Leslie Burgin (13 July 1887 – 16 August 1945) was a British Liberal and later Liberal National politician in the 1930s.

==Biography==
Born to Edward Lambert Burgin, a solicitor, Burgin studied law at the University of London, graduating with a first-class LL.B. in 1908 and a LL.D. in 1913.

Burgin trained as a solicitor specialising in international law and served as principal and director of legal studies to the Law Society. He contested Hornsey four times and East Ham North once, without success.

In the 1929 general election Burgin was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Luton. Along with some other Liberal MPs he joined the Liberal Nationals in 1931 and was made a Charity Commissioner. In 1932 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade. He was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1937 Coronation Honours.

In 1937 Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain appointed Burgin as Minister of Transport. Two years later he was appointed as the first Minister of Supply in April 1939. As the post had not yet been established in law, he formally served as Minister without Portfolio for the first three months. His appointment was aimed to appeal to liberal minded opinion but was criticised as being inappropriate - A.J.P. Taylor described Burgin as being &quot;another horse from Caligula&#x27;s well-stocked stables&quot; (a follow-up to contemporary remarks about the earlier appointment of Sir Thomas Inskip as Minister for Coordination of Defence). When Chamberlain was replaced by Winston Churchill, Burgin was not included in the new wartime ministry.

Burgin was referred to in the book &quot;Guilty Men&quot; (1940) by Michael Foot, Frank Owen and Peter Howard (writing under the pseudonym &#x27;Cato&#x27;), an attack on public figures for their failure to re-arm and their appeasement of Nazi Germany.

He retired at the 1945 general election before dying in August 1945, aged 58.

<text>Edward Newman Brandt Jr. MD (July 3, 1933 – August 26, 2007) was an American physician, mathematician, and public health administrator. He was appointed acting surgeon general of the United States from 1981 to 1982 and served as the United States assistant secretary for health from 1981 to 1984.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Oklahoma City, Brandt graduated with an MD and PhD in biostatistics from the University of Oklahoma School of Medicine. He was a faculty member from his alma mater from 1961 to 1970 before moving to the University of Texas at Galveston (1970–1981), University of Maryland at Baltimore (1981–1989), and University of Oklahoma School of Medicine (1989–2007).

In 1984, Brandt agreed to attend an awards dinner to present an award to the Blood Sisters Project a lesbian group that helped enlist and collect blood donations for AIDS victims. However, possibly due to pressure from &quot;pro-family&quot; groups, he did not attend. 

== Death ==
Brandt died of lung cancer on August 26, 2007; he was 74 years old. His papers were donated to the National Library of Medicine.

<text>Prostratin is a protein kinase C activator found in the bark of the mamala tree of Samoa, &quot;Homalanthus nutans&quot; (Euphorbiaceae). While prostratin was originally isolated and identified as a new phorbol ester from species of the genus &quot;Pimelea&quot; (Thymelaceae) in Australia, the antiviral activity of prostratin was discovered during research on the traditional knowledge of Samoan healers in Falealupo village by ethnobotanist Paul Alan Cox and a team at the U.S. National Cancer Institute. Samoan healers use the mamala tree to treat hepatitis. Research indicated that prostratin has potential to be useful in the treatment of HIV as it could flush viral reservoirs in latently infected CD4+ T-cells.

As a modulator of protein kinase C, it has been shown to exhibit promising therapeutic potential against other diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. 
In 2015, study showed that orally administrated prostratin repressed human pancreatic tumor.

== Overview ==

Prostratin is of interest because of its unique ability to activate latent viral reservoirs, while preventing healthy cells from infection, as well as its discovery through ethnobotany. Pioneering agreements to protect indigenous intellectual property rights of the Samoan people were established between the Samoan government and the AIDS Research Alliance, with 20% of ARA&#x27;s profits to be returned to the Samoan people, and between the Samoan Government and the University of California, Berkeley where a team led by Jay Keasling is trying to isolate the gene sequence responsible for prostratin biosynthesis. Samoa and UC Berkeley agreed to share equally in any commercial proceeds from the gene product.

In 2008, a team at Stanford University led by chemist Paul Wender has published an elegant four-step chemical synthesis of prostratin from phorbol. This practical synthesis produces gram quantities of prostratin, and is a major step forward in pharmaceutical development of prostratin.

In 2010, AIDS Research Alliance in Los Angeles, California announced that it signed a new licensing agreement with Stanford University, transferring exclusive rights of the technology developed by the Stanford research team.
Phase I human clinical trials of prostratin will be carried out by the AIDS ReSearch Alliance in Los Angeles, California.

<text>The Bôcher Memorial Prize was founded by the American Mathematical Society in 1923 in memory of Maxime Bôcher with an initial endowment of $1,450 (contributed by members of that society). It is awarded every three years (formerly every five years) for a notable research work in analysis that has appeared during the past six years. The work must be published in a recognized, peer-reviewed venue. The current award is $5,000.

There have been forty-one prize recipients. The first woman to win the award, Laure Saint-Raymond, did so in 2020. About eighty percent of the journal articles recognized since 2000 have been from &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot;, the &quot;Journal of the American Mathematical Society&quot;, &quot;Inventiones Mathematicae&quot;, and &quot;Acta Mathematica&quot;.

<doc id="1099893" wikidata="Q1347890" url="?curid=1099893" title="Sir Hugh Munro, 4th Baronet">
<text>Sir Hugh Thomas Munro, 4th Baronet (16 October 1856 – 19 March 1919), was a British mountaineer best known for his list of mountains in Scotland over 3,000 feet (914.4 m), known as Munros. Born in London, Munro was the fifth child of Sir Campbell Munro, 3rd Baronet, and also a grandson of Major-General Sir Thomas Munro, 1st Baronet of Lindertis.

==Biography==
Munro was born on 16 October 1856 in London, but was brought up in Scotland on the family estate of Lindertis near Kirriemuir in 
Angus. He was an avid hillwalker, and was a founder member of the Scottish Mountaineering Club in 1889. His list of 3,000-foot mountains 1891 was published in the 6th issue of the Scottish Mountaineering Club Journal in 1891. This list caused much surprise in mountaineering circles, as until his list was produced many thought that the number of mountains exceeding this height was around 30, rather than the nearly 300 that he listed. These mountains are now known as Munros and it is a popular hobby to attempt to climb them all.

Hugh Munro never completed his own list. Of his original list he failed to climb one mountain in the Cairngorms (Carn Cloich-Mhuillin), which he was saving to be his last. At the time of his death he had produced a revised version of the list, adding Carn an Fhidhleir, which he had also yet to climb. Sir Hugh is often said to have missed out the Inaccessible Pinnacle (An Stac) of Sgùrr Dearg, on the Isle of Skye, a peak which there is no record of his having climbed. However, the &quot;In Pinn&quot; was not included in either of the lists produced during his lifetime, despite being several feet higher than Sgurr Dearg, which was included. The first person to achieve the feat of climbing all of the mountains on Munro&#x27;s list is generally regarded as being the Rev. A. E. Robertson in 1901. However Robertson is known not to have climbed all of the peaks either, as he did not climb The Inaccessible Pinnacle or reach the summit of Ben Wyvis.

In addition to his mountaineering interests, Munro was well travelled and made trips to Europe, Asia, North America and Africa.
He was too old at 58 for military service during World War I but did volunteer work with the Red Cross and cared for injured soldiers in Malta in 1915. After a spell of illness, he rejoined the Red Cross, running a canteen for Allied forces near the front line in France. He died on 19 March 1919 in Tarascon in southern France aged 63, during the post-war influenza pandemic. He is buried on the family estate of Lindertis near Kirriemuir in Angus.

<text>James Ostermann Mason (June 19, 1930 – October 9, 2019) was an American medical doctor and public health administrator. He was the United States Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) from 1989 to 1993 and the Acting Surgeon General of the United States from 1989 to 1990. As the ASH he was also a former four-star admiral in the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. He was also a director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a general authority of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

==Early life and education==
Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Mason earned B.A. and M.D. degrees from the University of Utah. Mason received an MPH degree from Harvard in 1963. In 1967, he completed a DrPH degree in public health from Harvard University. 

Mason did residencies at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and Johns Hopkins Hospital.

==Medical career==
Mason was the first managing director of the LDS Church&#x27;s Unified Welfare Services, directing the church&#x27;s hospital system beginning in 1970 when the church moved general authorities to a position of developing policy and handing over the managing of professional departments to hired professionals. In this position he gave a talk in LDS general conference announcing the health missionary plan in 1971. He continued as head of the church&#x27;s hospitals until 1975 when the church spun them off as Intermountain Healthcare to allow it to focus health resources more to assist members around the world.

From 1978 to 1979, Mason served as chair of the division of community medicine in the University of Utah&#x27;s college of medicine.

Mason served as the executive director of the Utah Department of Health from 1979 until 1983, when he was named director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia; Mason held the directorship of the CDC until 1989. In 1993, he was presented with the Gorgas Medal from the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States (AMSUS).

In 1989, the U.S. Senate confirmed Mason as Assistant Secretary for Health, which made him head of the United States Public Health Service, and Acting Surgeon General. He later served as the American delegate to the World Health Organization.

==LDS Church service==
In 1994, Mason was appointed as a general authority by the LDS Church, serving in the Second Quorum of the Seventy until 2000. From 2000 to 2003, Mason was president of the church&#x27;s Bountiful Utah Temple.

As a young man, Mason served a church mission to Denmark. Before his appointment as a general authority, Mason served as a bishop, stake president, and regional representative. In 1974, while serving as Church Commissioner for Health Services, Mason wrote a pamphlet for the church titled, &quot;Attitudes of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Toward Certain Medical Problems&quot;, which expresses the church&#x27;s views on abortion, birth control, and homosexuality.

==Family life==
Mason married Marie Smith in 1952 in the Salt Lake Temple and they were the parents of seven children. Mason died on October 9, 2019.

<text>Jean-Pierre &quot;Jempi&quot; Monseré (8 September 1948 – 15 March 1971) was a Belgian road racing cyclist who died while champion of the world.

==Career==

=== Early life ===
As a child, the energetic Monseré excelled in different sports like football and athletics. He rode his first bicycle race in Lendelede at the age of 12, competing against fifteen-year-old cyclists.

Monseré won his first official race on 7 July 1963 in the Sint-Elooi Prize in Ruddervoorde. He managed to put this race completely in his hands and he finished with a lead of no less than 7 minutes. At 15, Monseré, already targeted by several competitors, won the Belgian Road Championship for under-novices.

In 1965, Dr. Derluyn joined the staff of Jean-Pierre Monseré. Under his guidance, &quot;Jempi&quot; switched from the then popular training methods, consisting of endless endurance training, to interval training. As a result, training had to be done less and they could build more peace, so a rider had much more recuperation.

=== Amateur career ===
Monseré became amateur cyclist in 1967. In the Belgian Road Championship, he and Roger De Vlaeminck were considered as favourites. But their rivalry both cost them the title with Monseré ending second.

The following year, he again finished as second in the Belgian Road Championship.

Following his victory in the mountain race GP Peugeot, Monseré was included in the Belgian national team for the 1968 Summer Olympics as a support rider for Roger De Vlaeminck. After De Vlaeminck crashed in a training ride, Monseré could ride for himself and finished in 6th place in the individual road race.

Once more, Monseré ended as second in the 1969 Belgian Road Championship. In his last World Amateur Championship, he hoped to win the world title in Brno, Czechoslovakia. However, the Dane Leif Mortensen was crowned world champion. Monseré won the silver medal and compatriot Staf Van Roosbroeck bronze.

=== Professional career and death ===
He became professional for Flandria in 1969, and won the Giro di Lombardia that year, after Gerben Karstens tested positive for taking amphetamines. A year later, Monseré became the Belgian track omnium champion.

Monseré continued to affirm his exceptional qualities, including his self-discipline and hunger for victory. He owed a lot to the strong bond with his blind masseur Jacques Delva, who, among other things, let him perform the basic yoga asanas.

He was selected in the Belgian team for the 1970 World Championship in Leicester, England. In the final, Eddy Merckx encouraged Monseré to chase the leading cyclists, saying &#x27;if you want to win, you have to go to Gimondi&#x27;. Monseré escaped with a small group and eventually won the world championship. He was the second-youngest world champion after another Belgian, Karel Kaers. 

In 1971, he was again Belgian track champion, this time in the madison discipline. On the road, he won the Vuelta a Andalucía in February 1971. 
On 15 March 1971, Monseré was riding the Grote Jaarmarktprijs in Retie after being convinced by Eric and Roger De Vlaeminck to participate. Monseré realised it was good training for Milan–San Remo the following weekend. On the road from Lille to Gierle, he and Roger De Vlaeminck agreed they had trained enough and they were about to exit the race. However, when Monseré looked back to estimate the distance with the peloton, a car driving onto the course collided head-on with Monseré killing him outright. Within a few minutes, a local doctor was with him but he could only diagnose the cyclist&#x27;s death. His funeral was attended by more than 20,000 people, including several government ministers, and top cyclists including Eddy Merckx, Roger De Vlaeminck, Patrick Sercu and Joop Zoetemelk. Merckx placed the flowers he had received after his Milan–San Remo victory on the coffin. In a cruel twist of fate, in 1976 Monseré&#x27;s seven-year-old son Giovanni died after a collision with a car, while riding his racing bike which was given to him on his first communion by a family friend, another world champion Freddy Maertens. Like his father, the little boy was also wearing a rainbow jersey.

== Aftermath ==

Investigation of the accident showed blunders of both the local law enforcement forces and the race organization. As it was a small local race, the gendarmerie had refused to cooperate, and the police did not find it necessary to stop traffic on the course. Moreover, other than a car driving in front, there were no other signs warning that a race was ongoing. The driver of the car, a woman in her twenties, was not blamed. Following the accident, the regulations related to cycling races at all levels were tightened.

In a documentary years later, Roger De Vlaeminck stated that &quot;Merckx would have had a lot of trouble with him. Monseré was better than him, I think. He was more of an all-rounder. He could sprint and climb very well. He rode … also more reasoned than Merckx and me. In my view, he had to do less to achieve the same results.&quot;

Jean-Pierre Monseré is remembered each year with a memorial cycle trophy, the Grote Herdenkingsprijs Monseré, organized by the Retiese Wielerclub &#x27;De Zonnestraal&#x27;. Jempi Monseré&#x27;s medals are in the Belgian national cycle museum in Roeselare.

<text>Purvanchal Vikas Party (&quot;Purvanchal Development Party&quot;, PVP) is a political party founded ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha election in the Indian state of Punjab.

PVP emerged as a group representing migrant labourers from the Hindi belt region in and around the city of Ludhiana. Amongst other issues, PVP intended to construct a &#x27;Purvanchal Bhavan&#x27; (Eastern Building) for migrant labourers. The convenor of the party (until a regular conference was held) was T.R. Misra.

In the 2007 assembly election in Uttar Pradesh, PVP launched only one candidate, Ashiquazzaman in Gorakhpur. Ashiquazzaman got 104 votes (0.11% of the votes in the constituency).

<text>In class field theory, the Takagi existence theorem states that for any number field &quot;K&quot; there is a one-to-one inclusion reversing correspondence between the finite abelian extensions of &quot;K&quot; (in a fixed algebraic closure of &quot;K&quot;) and the generalized ideal class groups defined via a modulus of &quot;K&quot;. 

It is called an existence theorem because a main burden of the proof is to show the existence of enough abelian extensions of &quot;K&quot;.

==Formulation==
Here a modulus (or &quot;ray divisor&quot;) is a formal finite product of the valuations (also called primes or places) of &quot;K&quot; with positive integer exponents. The archimedean valuations that might appear in a modulus include only those whose completions are the real numbers (not the complex numbers); they may be identified with orderings on &quot;K&quot; and occur only to exponent one.

The modulus &quot;m&quot; is a product of a non-archimedean (finite) part &quot;m&quot;&quot;f&quot; and an archimedean (infinite) part &quot;m&quot;∞. The non-archimedean part &quot;m&quot;&quot;f&quot; is a nonzero ideal in the ring of integers &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot; of &quot;K&quot; and the archimedean part &quot;m&quot;∞ is simply a set of real embeddings of &quot;K&quot;. Associated to such a modulus &quot;m&quot; are two groups of fractional ideals. The larger one, &quot;I&quot;&quot;m&quot;, is the group of all fractional ideals relatively prime to &quot;m&quot; (which means these fractional ideals do not involve any prime ideal appearing in &quot;m&quot;&quot;f&quot;). The smaller one, &quot;P&quot;&quot;m&quot;, is the group of principal fractional ideals (&quot;u&quot;/&quot;v&quot;) where &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are nonzero elements of &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot; which are prime to &quot;m&quot;&quot;f&quot;, &quot;u&quot; ≡ &quot;v&quot; mod &quot;m&quot;&quot;f&quot;, and &quot;u&quot;/&quot;v&quot; &gt; 0 in each of the orderings of &quot;m&quot;∞. (It is important here that in &quot;P&quot;&quot;m&quot;, all we require is that some generator of the ideal has the indicated form. If one does, others might not. For instance, taking &quot;K&quot; to be the rational numbers, the ideal (3) lies in &quot;P&quot;4 because (3) = (−3) and −3 fits the necessary conditions. But (3) is not in &quot;P&quot;4∞ since here it is required that the &quot;positive&quot; generator of the ideal is 1 mod 4, which is not so.) For any group &quot;H&quot; lying between &quot;I&quot;&quot;m&quot; and &quot;P&quot;&quot;m&quot;, the quotient &quot;I&quot;&quot;m&quot;/&quot;H&quot; is called a &quot;generalized ideal class group&quot;. 

It is these generalized ideal class groups which correspond to abelian extensions of &quot;K&quot; by the existence theorem, and in fact are the Galois groups of these extensions. That generalized ideal class groups are finite is proved along the same lines of the proof that the usual ideal class group is finite, well in advance of knowing these are Galois groups of finite abelian extensions of the number field.

==A well-defined correspondence==
Strictly speaking, the correspondence between finite abelian extensions of &quot;K&quot; and generalized ideal class groups is not quite one-to-one. Generalized ideal class groups defined relative to different moduli can give rise to the same abelian extension of &quot;K&quot;, and this is codified a priori in a somewhat complicated equivalence relation on generalized ideal class groups. 

In concrete terms, for abelian extensions &quot;L&quot; of the rational numbers, this corresponds to the fact that an abelian extension of the rationals lying in one cyclotomic field also lies in infinitely many other cyclotomic fields, and for each such cyclotomic overfield one obtains by Galois theory a subgroup of the Galois group corresponding to the same field &quot;L&quot;. 

In the idelic formulation of class field theory, one obtains a precise one-to-one correspondence between abelian extensions and appropriate groups of ideles, where equivalent generalized ideal class groups in the ideal-theoretic language correspond to the same group of ideles.

==Earlier work==
A special case of the existence theorem is when &quot;m&quot; = 1 and &quot;H&quot; = &quot;P&quot;1. In this case the generalized ideal class group is the ideal class group of &quot;K&quot;, and the existence theorem says there exists a unique abelian extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; with Galois group isomorphic to the ideal class group of &quot;K&quot; such that &quot;L&quot; is unramified at all places of &quot;K&quot;. This extension is called the Hilbert class field. It was conjectured by David Hilbert to exist, and existence in this special case was proved by Philipp Furtwängler in 1907, before Takagi&#x27;s general existence theorem. 

A further and special property of the Hilbert class field, not true of smaller abelian extensions of a number field, is that all ideals in a number field become principal in the Hilbert class field. It required Artin and Furtwängler to prove that principalization occurs.

==History==
The existence theorem is due to Takagi, who proved it in Japan during the isolated years of World War I. He presented it at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1920, leading to the development of the classical theory of class field theory during the 1920s. At Hilbert&#x27;s request, the paper was published in Mathematische Annalen in 1925.

<text>The Alids are those who claim descent from Ali ibn Abi Talib (; 600–661 CE), the fourth Rashidun caliph () and the first imam in Shia Islam. Ali was also the cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The main branches are the Hasanids and Husaynids, named after Hasan and Husayn, the eldest sons of Ali from his marriage to Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad. As the progeny of Muhammad, they are revered by all Muslims. The Alids have led various movements in Islam, and a line of twelve Alids are the imams in Twelver Shia, the largest Shia branch.

== Children of Ali ==

In addition to seventeen daughters, various sources report that Ali had eleven or fourteen, or eighteen sons. His first marriage was to Fatima, daughter of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who bore Ali three sons, namely, Hasan, Husayn, and Muhsin, though the last one is not mentioned in some sources. Muhsin either died in infancy, or was miscarried after Fatima was injured during a raid on her house to arrest Ali, who had withheld his pledge of allegiance from the first Rashidun caliph Abu Bakr (). The former report appears is Sunni sources and the latter in Shia sources. Hasan and Husayn are recognized as the second and the third Imams in Shia Islam, their descendants being known as the Hasanids and the Husaynids, respectively. They are revered by all Muslims as the progeny of Muhammad and honored by nobility titles such as Sharif and Sayyid. Ali and Fatima also had two daughters, namely, Zaynab and Umm Kulthum. After the death of Fatima in 632 CE, Ali remarried and had more children. Among them, the lineage of Ali continued through Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiya, Abbas ibn Ali, and Umar al-Atraf, their descendants were honored by the title Alawi (). Respectively, they were born to Khawla al-Hanafiyya, Umm al-Banin, and Umm Habib bint Rabi&#x27;a (al-Sahba).

== Alids in history ==
=== Umayyads era () ===

Mu&#x27;awiya seized the rule after the assassination of Ali in 661 and founded the Umayyad Caliphate, during which the Alids and their supporters were heavily persecuted. After Ali, his followers () recognized as their imam his eldest son Hasan. After his death in 670, they turned to his brother Husayn, but he and his small caravan were massacred by the Umayyads in the Battle of Karbala in 680. Soon followed the Shia uprising of al-Mukhtar in 685 on behalf of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiya. Many more Shia revolts followed afterward, led not only by the Alids but also by other kinsmen of Muhammad. 

The main movements in this period were the now-extinct Kaysanites and the Imamites. Named after a commander of al-Mukhtar, the Kaysanites energetically opposed the Umayyads and were led by various relatives of Muhammad. Their majority followed Abu Hashim, the son of Ibn al-Hanafiya. When Abu Hashim died around 716, this group followed Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abd-Allah, the great-grandson of Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib. The Kaysanite movement thus aligned itself with the Abbasids, that is, the descendants of Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib. On the other hand, the Imamites were led by the quiescent descendants of Husayn through his only surviving son, Ali Zayn al-Abidin (), their fourth imam. His son Zayd ibn Ali was an exception for he led a failed uprising against the Umayyads around 740. The followers of Zayd went on to form the Zaydites, for whom any learned Hasanid or Husaynid who rose against tyranny was qualified as imam.

=== Abbasids era () ===
To overthrow the Umayyads, the Abbasids had rallied the support of the Shia in the name of the Ahl al-Bayt, that is, the family of Muhammad. But many Shias were disillusioned when the Abbasid al-Saffah () declared himself caliph, as they had hoped for an Alid leader instead. The Abbasids soon turned against their former allies and persecuted the Alids and their Shia supporters. In response, Shia doctrinally limited its leadership to the Alids, many of whom revolted against the Abbasids, including the Hasanid brothers Muhammad ibn Abd-Allah () and Ibrahim. Some Alids instead took refuge in remote areas and founded regional dynasties in the southern shores of the Caspian sea, Yemen, and western Maghreb. For instance, the revolt of the Hasanid Husayn ibn Ali al-Abid was suppressed in 786 but his brother Idris () escaped and founded the first Alid dynasty in Morocco. Similarly, a number of Zaydite rules appeared in northern Persia and in Yemen, the latter of which has survived to the present day.

Some quiescent imams of the Imamites were also probably killed by the Abbasids. For example, their seventh imam, Musa al-Kazim (), spent years in the Abbasid prisons and died there, possibly poisoned by order of Caliph Harun al-Rashid (), who also had &quot;hundreds of Alids&quot; killed. Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun () later attempted a reconciliation by appointing in 816 as his heir Ali al-Rida, the eighth imam of the Imamites. But other Abbasids revolted in opposition in Iraq, which forced al-Ma&#x27;mun to reverse his policies and Ali al-Rida died around that time, likely poisoned. Ali al-Hadi () and Hasan al-Askari (), the tenth and eleventh imams of the Imamites, were held in the capital Samarra under strict surveillance. Most Imamite sources report that both were poisoned by the Abbasids. Their followers also believe that the birth of their twelfth imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, was hidden for fear of Abbasid persecution and that he remains in occultation by divine will since 874, until his reappearance at the end of time to eradicate injustice and evil. They became known as the Twelvers. 

Meanwhile, the only historic split among the Imamites happened after the death in 765 of their sixth imam, the quiescent Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, who played a key role in formulating Imamite doctrines. Some claimed that his designated successor was his son Isma&#x27;il, who had actually predeceased al-Sadiq. These followers permanently separated and later formed the Isma&#x27;ilites. Some of them denied the death of Isma&#x27;il but their majority accepted the imamate of his son Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il. His death around 795 was denied by the majority of his followers, who awaited his return as the Mahdi, while a minority traced the imamate in his descendants. The Isma&#x27;ilites actively opposed the Abbasids, and their efforts culminated in the establishment of the Fatimid Caliphate () in North Africa, although some have questioned the Isma&#x27;ilite ancestry of the Fatimid caliphs. 

The abortive Zanj rebellion against the Abbasids was ignited in Iraq and Bahrain in the mid-ninth century by Ali ibn Muhammad Sahib al-Zanj, who claimed descent from Abbas ibn Ali. The poetry by descendants of Abbas ibn Ali is collected in , compiled by the Turkic scholar al-Suli (). One of his descendants was Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Alawi, who reached fame as a poet and scholar during the reigns of Harun al-Rashid and al-Ma&#x27;mun.

=== Alid dynasties ===
Several dynasties have claimed descent from Ali, often through his son Hasan. The Hasanid dynasties include the Idrisites and Sharifs of Maghreb in North Africa, and Hammudids in Andalusia, located in modern-day Spain. The Fatimid Caliphate claimed a Husaynid descent.

<text>Vice Admiral William Satterlee Pye (9 June 1880 – 4 May 1959) was a U.S. Navy officer who served during World War I and World War II, but never saw combat action. His last active-duty appointment was as President of the Naval War College, in 1942–1946. His awards included the Navy Cross for his distinguished service as a staff officer during World War I.

==Career through World War I==
Pye was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 9 June 1880. Entering the United States Naval Academy in 1897, he graduated in 1901 and was commissioned an Ensign in June 1903. One of his classmates was Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King. From 1901 through 1915, he served in several ships, among them five battleships and an armored cruiser, and was also assigned to the staffs of the Naval Academy and Naval War College. In 1915–1916 he placed the new destroyer into commission. He relinquished command of &quot;Jacob Jones&quot; before her 1917 deployment to Europe with the US entry into World War I, and joined the staff of the Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet. He served in that position through the war, receiving the Navy Cross &quot;for exceptionally distinguished and valuable service on the staff of the commander in chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, in addition to excellent performance of his routine staff duties in preparing a series of orders for the conduct of battleship and fleet, based upon the best thought and experience of the United States fleet and British fleet during the late war.&quot;

==Interwar years==
Pye served in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in 1919–1921, and was executive officer of the battleship in 1922–1923. Late in 1923, Pye served as a destroyer division commander. His division was the second in line at the Honda Point Disaster, and two of his destroyers were among those lost. He returned to Washington, D.C., for service at the Navy Department, which lasted into 1927. In the next five years, he commanded the minelayer , had more Navy Department service, and was head of the U.S. Naval Mission to Peru. Captain Pye commanded the battleship in 1932–1933.

Promoted to the rank of rear admiral, Pye served as chief of staff to Commander Scouting Force, attended the Naval War College, had further Navy Department service, and was Commander Destroyers in both the Scouting Force and Battle Force of the Pacific Fleet. With the temporary rank of Vice Admiral, he was Commander Battleships, Battle Force in 1940 and Commander Battle Force (COMBATFOR) in 1941.

==World War II and post-war years==
He is perhaps best known for his 6 December 1941 remark that &quot;The Japanese will not go to war with the United States. We are too big, too powerful, and too strong.&quot; Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the subsequent relief of Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC) Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, Vice Admiral Pye became Acting CINCPAC on 17 December. He had reservations about Kimmel&#x27;s plan to send a relief force including the aircraft carrier to the aid of Wake Island, but continued with the plan until 22 December. Then – after reports of additional landings on Wake – Pye decided the operation was too risky and recalled the relief force. This decision was highly controversial, as it amounted to abandoning the Wake Island garrison, which had defeated a Japanese landing on 11 December.

On 31 December, Pye relinquished command of the Pacific Fleet to Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. Pye became commander of Task Force One (TF 1), comprising the remaining operational battleships of the Pacific Fleet augmented by three battleships from the Atlantic Fleet, now based in San Francisco. During the Battle of Midway, Pye received orders for the seven old battleships (, , , , , , and ), the escort carrier , and eight destroyers of TF 1 to sortie to patrol off of the West Coast against possible Japanese attack there should the carrier forces at Midway be defeated. Such fears proved unfounded, and TF 1 then remained on training and patrol duties between Hawaii and the West Coast until Pye was relieved in October 1942 at the age of 62. He never commanded operating forces again, and was relegated to administrative positions. On 2 November, Pye became President of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and also commanded the Naval Operating Base there. He officially retired on 1 July 1944, but was recalled to active duty as President of the War College, and promoted to permanent Vice Admiral. He continued at the War College until retiring from active duty on 1 March 1946. Pye died at Bethesda, Maryland, on 4 May 1959. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, United States.

Pye&#x27;s oldest son, LT William Satterlee Pye, Jr., was killed in a plane crash in 1938. His youngest son, Lieutenant Commander John Briscoe Pye, served on the submarine on her 13th and final war patrol. &quot;Swordfish&quot; was lost with all hands on 12 January 1945, off Kyushu, Japan.

==Awards==

===Navy Cross citation===

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Commander William Satterlee Pye (NSN: 3794), United States Navy, for exceptionally distinguished and valuable service on the Staff of the Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, in addition to excellent performance of his routine staff duties in preparing a series of orders for the conduct of battleship and fleet, based upon the best thought and experience of the United States fleet and British fleet during the late war.

===Legion of Merit citation===

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Legion of Merit to Vice Admiral (Retired) William Satterlee Pye (NSN: 3794), United States Navy, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States as President of the Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island, from 2 November 1942 until 2 March 1946, and as Commandant, Naval Operating Base, Newport, Rhode Island, from 2 November 1942 until 1 July 1944. The supervision of the Naval War College and the Command of the Naval Operating Base was a dual task of unusual severity due to an intensified and accelerated course of study at the Naval War College and due to the general stress of wartime activity at the Naval Operating Base. Vice Admiral Pye by his sound judgment, initiative and untiring efforts maintained both the Naval War College and the Naval Operating Base during the critical war time period, upon high levels of operating efficiency. Realizing the necessity of furnishing large numbers of officers trained in the fundamental concepts of Naval warfare and in the exercise of command, Vice Admiral Pye designated and established the wartime Command and Preparatory Staff Courses at the Naval War College. Under his able leadership over 600 Naval Officers received advanced training in these streamlined courses and their services were a distinct contribution to the ultimate triumph of our victorious fleet. Under the supervision of Vice Admiral Pye in his capacity as Commandant of the Naval Operating Base, the major function of the Naval Training Station was changed, in the early months of 1944 from that of training thousands of enlisted personnel, integrating them into efficient operating teams for our powerful fighting units afloat. A large share of the credit for the success of the pre-commissioning program was due to the untiring and careful attention of Vice Admiral Pye in its establishment and during the formative stages of its development. Vice Admiral Pye&#x27;s outstanding professional attainments, his loyalty and patriotism, and his ideals of service have been an example and inspiration to all, both staff and student body who were fortunate enough to be associated with him at either the Naval War College or the Naval Operating Base.

<doc id="1099951" wikidata="Q7753751" url="?curid=1099951" title="The New Soldier">
<text>The New Soldier was published as both a hard and soft cover book in October, 1971, by Vietnam Veterans Against the War. Principally a photographic essay accompanied by text, the work was edited by David Thorne and George Butler, with a section written by John Kerry. The work includes photographs captured by many photographers across five days in April, 1971.

== Overview ==
&quot;The New Soldier&quot; documents what VVAW called Operation Dewey Canyon III. This pseudo-operation, &quot;a limited incursion into the country of Congress&quot;, was basically a series of demonstrations, marches and street theatre designed to protest US involvement in the war in Vietnam. In one activity, Vietnam War combat veterans, wearing uniforms and carrying unloaded weapons, enacted for astonished visitors to Washington, DC, the actions common to descending upon and sweeping a Vietnamese village for enemy combatants. This theatre was performed on Constitution Mall, under heavy police supervision. This was only one of several events participated in by hundreds of Vietnam Veterans and not a few Gold Star Mothers from across the country.

&quot;The New Soldier&quot; documents two events of emotional significance. In one, war veterans queue up in a long line to return their medals and decorations to the U.S. government. They hurled them upon the steps of Congress. This was a shocking scene on American television.

A second event was a worship service held at the main gate to Arlington National Cemetery. The desire had been to hold the service on the actual hallowed grounds but the Vietnam Veteran demonstrators were locked out of Arlington. Marines guarded the gates with loaded weapons and kept them pointed outward. The worship service had to be conducted with the clergyman&#x27;s back to those Marines. To some readers, a shortcoming of The New Soldier is that the words spoken by this Vietnam War battlefield chaplain, a United Methodist clergyman, were not included in the volume. That sermonette has not been lost to American history (see link below).

The book contains excerpts of testimony by veterans at the Winter Soldier Investigation on war crimes committed during the Vietnam War and a portion of the Fulbright Hearing testimony given by John Kerry to the Senate committee.

&quot;The New Soldier&quot; documents a most unusual event in American history: returned veterans of a foreign war appearing en masse in the nation&#x27;s capital to demand that the war be stopped. Only 5000 copies of the book were printed, consequently, the book is considered a collector&#x27;s item.

<doc id="1099961" wikidata="Q1454324" url="?curid=1099961" title="Freedom Charter">
<text>The Freedom Charter was the statement of core principles of the South African Congress Alliance, which consisted of the African National Congress (ANC) and its allies: the South African Indian Congress, the South African Congress of Democrats and the Coloured People&#x27;s Congress. It is characterised by its opening demand, &quot;The People Shall Govern!&quot;

==History==
After about a decade of multi-faceted resistance to white minority rule, and in the wake of the Defiance Campaign of 1952, the work to create the Freedom Charter was in part a response to an increasingly repressive government which was bent on stamping out extra-parliamentary dissent.
In 1955, the ANC sent out 50,000 volunteers into townships and the countryside to collect &quot;freedom demands&quot; from the people of South Africa.This system was designed to give all South Africans equal rights. Demands such as &quot;Land to be given to all landless people&quot;, &quot;Living wages and shorter hours of work&quot;, &quot;Free and compulsory education, irrespective of colour, race or nationality&quot; were synthesised into the final document by ANC leaders including Z.K. Mathews, Lionel &quot;Rusty&quot; Bernstein, Ethel Drus, Ruth First and Alan Lipman (whose wife, Beata Lipman, hand-wrote the original Charter).

The Charter was officially adopted on Sunday 26 June 1955 at a gathering of about 3,000 people, known as the Congress of the People in Kliptown, Soweto. The meeting was broken up by police on the second day, although by then the Charter had been read in full. The crowd had shouted its approval of each section with cries of &quot;Africa!&quot; and &quot;Mayibuye!&quot; Nelson Mandela escaped the police by disguising himself as a milkman, as his movements and interactions were restricted by banning orders at the time.

The document signified a major break with the past traditions of the struggle; this was no longer a civil rights movement seeking to be accommodated in the existing structures of society, but called for a fundamental restructuring of all aspects of South African society. The document is notable for its demand for and commitment to a non-racial South Africa, and this has remained the platform of the ANC. As a result, ANC members who held pro-African views left the ANC after it adopted the charter, forming the Pan Africanist Congress. The charter also calls for democracy and human rights, land reform, labour rights, and nationalisation.

After the Congress was denounced as treason, the South African government banned the ANC and arrested 156 activists, including Mandela, who were put on trial in the 1956 Treason Trial, in which all were acquitted. The Charter continued to circulate in the revolutionary underground and inspired a new generation of young militants in the 1980s.

When the ANC finally came to power after democratic elections in 1994, the new Constitution of South Africa included many of the demands of the Freedom Charter. It addressed directly nearly all of the demands for equality of race and language.

The original document is housed at Liliesleaf Farm, now a museum.

==Freedom Charter==

We, the People of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world to know:
that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of all the people;
that our people have been robbed of their birthright to land, liberty and peace by a form of government founded on injustice and inequality;

&lt;br&gt;The right of all the peoples of Africa to independence and self-government shall be recognized and shall be the basis of close co-operation.

Let all who love their people and their country now say, as we say here:

&#x27;THESE FREEDOMS WE WILL FIGHT FOR, SIDE BY SIDE, THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES, UNTIL WE HAVE WON OUR LIBERTY.&#x27;

Adopted at the Congress of the People, Kliptown, South Africa, on 26 June 1955.

<text>Guitar Center, Inc. is an American musical instrument retailer chain headquartered in Westlake Village, California. It operates 304 locations and is the largest company of its kind in the United States. 

The company oversees several subsidiaries, including Musician&#x27;s Friend, AVDG, Music &amp; Arts, Woodwind &amp; Brasswind, and Giardinelli.

==History==
Guitar Center was founded in Hollywood in 1959 by Wayne Mitchell as The Organ Center, a retailer of electronic organs for home and church use. In 1964, after a supplier required him to carry Vox guitar amplifiers, to continue receiving organs, Mitchell added the amplifiers to his inventory and renamed the store The Vox Center, leveraging the Beatles association with the Vox brand. In the late 1960s, as other brands like Marshall gained popularity, Mitchell renamed the store Guitar Center.
By 1972, Guitar Center had expanded to eight locations, including stores in San Francisco, San Diego and suburbs of Los Angeles. In the late 1970s, Ray Scherr, the General Manager of the San Francisco store, purchased the company from Wayne Mitchell. 

The 1980s saw a resurgence in &quot;guitar rock,&quot; led by bands such as Van Halen Van Halen and an influx of Japanese-produced instruments. This period brought significant growth in guitar sales, prompting Guitar Center to expand nationwide, eventually becoming the largest musical instrument retailer in the United States.
Scherr sold the company in 1996. The following year, with 30 stores on the West Coast and in Michigan, Ohio, and Florida, Guitar Center made an initial public offering of stock and opened more new locations.

In 2000, Guitar Center acquired mail order and e-commerce retailer Musician&#x27;s Friend for $50 million, and claimed the merged company was the world&#x27;s largest seller of musical instruments. Musician&#x27;s Friend became a wholly owned subsidiary, with its headquarters remaining in Medford, Oregon.

In 2005, Guitar Center Inc. acquired Music &amp; Arts, the largest band and orchestra dealer in the United States, and merged it with their American Music Group chain of band and orchestral stores. The company was renamed Music &amp; Arts. The same year, Guitar Center, Inc., started The Fender Music Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supported music education.

In 2006, Guitar Center acquired four stores in Texas from the South Texas and Central/South American company, Hermes. In the same year, Activision partnered with Guitar Center, and all purchases made during game play of &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;, beginning with the second installment, were made in a virtual Guitar Center store.

In February 2007, the Musician&#x27;s Friend division acquired assets of the Indiana-based company Dennis Bamber, Inc., which included band and orchestra retailer Woodwind &amp; Brasswind, plus Music 123 and Lyons Music.

In June 2007, Guitar Center agreed to a $1.9 billion buyout from Bain Capital, totaling $2.1 billion including debt. The deal was led by Goldman Sachs and amounted to a per-share price of $63, or a 26% premium on the June 26 closing price. The deal was approved by shareholders on September 18, 2007, and closed October 9, 2007.

In mid-2009, Guitar Center opened its first rehearsal and lessons studio facility in Woodland Hills, California, consisting of eight studios with backline, ranging in size from .

In 2011, Musician&#x27;s Friend&#x27;s headquarters operations were moved to Guitar Center&#x27;s facilities in Westlake Village, California. In the same year, Guitar Center began offering equipment rentals in one of their San Diego stores. Rental departments were extended to ten other locations, with plans to offer rentals across the country.

In May 2013, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s cut its debt rating on Bain Capital-owned Guitar Center Holdings Inc. to &quot;junk bond&quot; status, citing struggles with &quot;weak operating trends.&quot; The corporate credit rating on the company dropped from B to &#x27;CCC+&#x27;.

In April 2014, Ares Management took a controlling stake in Guitar Center. Bain Capital, Guitar Center&#x27;s former owner, retained partial ownership of the company, along with representation on the board. According to Mike Pratt, the retailer&#x27;s previous chief executive, the deal would reduce Guitar Center&#x27;s total debt and provide it with the resources to expand and invest in its business.

In August 2014, Guitar Center opened a new 28,000-square-foot flagship location in Times Square in New York City. The opening included a concert featuring The Roots. The Guitar Center Times Square location became the permanent home of Eric Clapton&#x27;s Blackie Fender Stratocaster, which had been purchased at a Christie&#x27;s Crossroads Centre auction in 2004 for $959,000. 

In April, 2017, Moody&#x27;s Investors Service revised the outlook on Guitar Center&#x27;s B2 rating to negative. In the face of flat sales in the musical instrument industry as a whole, Guitar Center became overwhelmed by its $1 billion debt. 

Guitar Center filed for bankruptcy in 2020 and the Times Square location was closed. On November 13, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Guitar Center announced that it planned to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after negotiating a debt-cutting deal with key investors and lenders. Guitar Center said it had received up to $165 million in new equity, and lenders agreed to reduce its debt by around $800 million. The company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on December 23, 2020, after a reorganization deal added additional equity and debt capital.

==Guitar Center Legends Collection==
In 2004, the Guitar Center began a &quot;Legends Collection&quot; with guitars made famous by Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and U2&#x27;s the Edge. The Centre purchased Clapton’s “Blackie” Fender Stratocaster for $959,500, his vintage Gibson “ES-335” for $847,500, and Vaughan’s “Lenny” Stratocaster for $623,500, a total of over $2.4 million, in the Clapton Crossroads Centre charity auction at Christie&#x27;s, New York. The Edge’s cream white Gibson Les Paul Custom was purchased for $240,000 at the Music Rising Charity Auction in 2007. The collection has been exhibited in a tour of musical events and Guitar Center locations, such as the one held at Madison Square Garden as part of Clapton’s Crossroads Guitar Festival in April 2013. In August 2014, Clapton’s Blackie and ES-335 were moved to a new permanent location in Times Square.
Clapton&#x27;s cherry red Gibson 335 was used to record Cream’s versions of &quot;Badge&quot; and &quot;Crossroads (from their final live performance in November 1968), and other historical performances over 40 years. Steve Ray Vaughan’s &quot;Lenny&quot; was used to record his classic love songs, including &quot;Lenny&quot; and &quot;Riviera Paradise&quot;. The Edge&#x27;s cream-colored 1975 Les Paul Custom, faded from its original white, had been used for U2&#x27;s stage and studio performances. All the proceeds from the sale of these guitars went to Clapton’s Crossroads Center charity.

In 2005, the Edge, producer Bob Ezrin, Gibson, and the Guitar Center Music Foundation (now known as the Fender Music Foundation) established Music Rising, a charity to benefit musicians whose lives had been disrupted by Hurricane Katrina. In 2007 The Edge donated his guitar to be auctioned for the charity and It was sold for $240,000 to Guitar Center ($288,000 including Buyer&#x27;s Premium).

==Guitar Center&#x27;s Drum-Off==
From 1988 through 2016, Guitar Center conducted an annual search for the next great undiscovered drummer. Developed to spotlight the drumming community, the Drum-Off was the music retailer’s longest running artist-discovery program.

The process of Guitar Center’s Drum-Off began with three rounds of preliminary competitions at each of Guitar Center&#x27;s 250+ locations nationwide, with each contestant allowed five minutes of set up time and three minutes to perform. One winner from each store final competition advanced to one of 30 quarterfinal competitions, and one winner from each quarterfinal competition advanced to one of five semifinal competitions, during which contestants were allowed five minutes to perform. The winners from each of these five semifinal competitions qualified to compete in front of a live audience and a panel of celebrity judges at Guitar Center&#x27;s Drum-Off finals in Los Angeles, California.

In the finals, each contestant was required to perform on a 5-piece acoustic drum kit complete with hardware, cymbals, cowbell, throne and the option to incorporate a Roland SPD-30 Octapad (the SPD-30 was not included in 2016). Contestants were evaluated by a panel of independent and credible judges on the following criteria: skills &amp; technique, groove, originality, stage presence, and overall performance.

Guitar Center discontinued their sponsorship of the annual contest in 2017.

<doc id="1099984" wikidata="Q1176498" url="?curid=1099984" title="David Satcher">
<text>David Satcher (born March 2, 1941) is an American physician, and public health administrator. He is a four-star admiral in the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and served as the 11th Assistant Secretary for Health, and the 16th Surgeon General of the United States.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Satcher was born in Anniston, Alabama. At the age of two, he contracted whooping cough. A Black doctor, Dr. Jackson, came to his parents&#x27; farm, and told his parents he didn&#x27;t expect David to live, but nonetheless spent the day with him and told his parents how to give him the best chance he could. Satcher said that he grew up hearing that story, and that inspired him to be a doctor. While in college, Satcher was active in the Civil Rights Movement and was arrested on multiple occasions.

Satcher graduated from Morehouse College in Atlanta in 1963 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He received his MD and a PhD in cell biology from Case Western Reserve University in 1970 with election to the Alpha Omega Alpha honor society. He completed his residency and fellowship training at the Strong Memorial Hospital, University of Rochester, the UCLA School of Medicine, and Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Preventive Medicine, and the American College of Physicians, and is board certified in preventive medicine. Satcher pledged Omega Psi Phi fraternity and is an initiate of the Psi chapter of Morehouse College.
=== Career ===

From December 1977 to August 1979, Satcher served as the Acting Dean of the Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School (now the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, also known as &quot;Drew&quot;). He had previously served as the Chairman of the Drew&#x27;s Department of Family Medicine. In May 1978, during his deanship term, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was approved by the University of California Board of Regents to adopt a joint medical education program between the UCLA School of Medicine and Drew; the Drew/UCLA M.D. program welcomed its first class of students in 1981. 

Satcher served as professor and Chairman of the Department of Community Medicine and Family Practice at Morehouse School of Medicine from 1979 to 1982. He is a former faculty member of the UCLA School of Medicine, the UCLA School of Public Health, and the King-Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles (known as the Martin Luther King Jr. Outpatient Center at the time of its closure in 2007), where he developed and chaired the King-Drew Department of Family Medicine. He also directed the King-Drew Sickle Cell Research Center for six years. Satcher served as President of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1982 to 1993. He held the posts of Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry from 1993 to 1998. Satcher was the first Black American to hold the CDC Director position. 

==== Chronic Fatigue Syndrome scandal ====
Under Satcher&#x27;s leadership, the CDC took millions of dollars Congress set aside for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) research and secretly spent the funds in other areas. The misappropriation of funds continued for three years (from 1995–1998) and the CDC attempted to cover up their actions. The issue only came to light after a CDC employee filed a whistleblower report and a special Inspector General was appointed to investigate the matter. In the words of Martha Katz, Deputy Director for Policy and Legislation at CDC: &quot;Resources intended for CFS were actually used for measles, polio and other disease areas. This was a breach of CDC&#x27;s solemn trust and is in direct conflict with its core values.&quot;

==== Surgeon General ====

Satcher served simultaneously in the positions of Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health from February 1998 through January 2001 at the US Department of Health and Human Services. As such, he is the first Surgeon General to be appointed as a four-star admiral in the PHSCC, a departure from the Surgeon General&#x27;s normal appointment to three-star vice general, to reflect his dual offices.

In his first year as Surgeon General, Satcher released the 1998 Surgeon General&#x27;s report &quot;Tobacco Use Among U.S. Racial/Ethnic Minority Groups.&quot; In it, he reported that tobacco use was on the rise among youth in each of the country&#x27;s major racial and ethnic groups, threatening their long-term health prospects.

Satcher was appointed by Bill Clinton, and remained Surgeon General until 2002, contemporaneously with the first half of the first term of George W. Bush&#x27;s presidential administration. Eve Slater would later replace him as Assistant Secretary for Health in 2001. Because he no longer held his dual office, Satcher was reverted and downgraded to the grade of vice admiral in the regular corps for the remainder of his term as Surgeon General. In 2001, his office released the report, &quot;The Surgeon General&#x27;s Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior&quot;. The report was hailed by the chairman of the American Academy of Family Physicians as an overdue paradigm shift—&quot;The only way we&#x27;re going to change approaches to sexual behavior and sexual activity is through school. In school, not only at the doctor&#x27;s office.&quot; However, conservative political groups denounced the report as being too permissive towards homosexuality and condom distribution in schools. When Satcher left office, he retired with the rank of vice admiral.

==== Post–Surgeon General ====
Upon his departure from the post, Satcher became a fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. In the fall of 2002, he assumed the post of Director of the National Center for Primary Care at the Morehouse School of Medicine.

On December 20, 2004, Satcher was named interim president at Morehouse School of Medicine until John E. Maupin, Jr., former president of Meharry Medical College assumed the current position on February 26, 2006. In June 2006, Satcher established the Satcher Health Leadership Institute (SHLI) at Morehouse School of Medicine as a natural extension of his experiences improving public health policy for all Americans and his commitment to eliminating health disparities for minorities, the poor, and other disadvantaged groups.

In 2013, he co-founded the advocacy group African American Network Against Alzheimer&#x27;s.

Satcher sat on the boards of directors of Johnson &amp; Johnson from 2002 to 2012, and MetLife from 2007 to 2012.

==== Criticisms of health inequality ====
While acknowledging progress, Satcher has criticized health disparities. In a 2005 article published in the journal &quot;Health Affairs&quot;, Satcher and his oc-authors asked the question, &quot;What if we had eliminated disparities in health in the last century?&quot; and estimated, based on 2002 data, that &quot;83,570 excess deaths could be prevented each year in the United States if [the] black-white mortality gap could be eliminated.&quot;

In a 2006 essay for &quot;PLOS Medicine&quot; discussing the &quot;Health Affairs&quot; article, Satcher stated that the study&#x27;s estimates included 24,000 fewer Black deaths from cardiovascular disease and, if infant mortality had been equal across racial and ethnic groups in 2000, 4,700 fewer Black infants would have died in their first year of life. Without disparities, there would have been 22,000 fewer Black deaths from diabetes and almost 2,000 fewer Black women would have died from breast cancer; 250,000 fewer Black patients would have been infected with HIV/AIDS and 7,000 fewer Black patients would have died from complications due to AIDS in 2000. As many as 2.5 million additional Black individuals, including 650,000 children, would have had health insurance in that year. He called on people to work for solutions at the individual, community, and policy level.

Satcher supports a Medicare-for-all style single payer health plan, in which insurance companies would be eliminated and the government would pay health care costs directly to doctors, hospitals and other providers through the tax system.

In 1990, while President of Meharry Medical College, Satcher founded a quarterly academic journal entitled the &quot;Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved&quot;. 

== Awards and honors ==
Satcher is the recipient of many honorary degrees and numerous distinguished honors, including:

* the Public Health Service Distinguished Service Medal
* an honorary Doctor of Public Health from Dickinson College (2016)
* the UC Berkeley School of Public Health Public Health Heroes Award (2013)
* an honorary Doctor of Science from Harvard University (2011)
* the Bennie Mays Trailblazer Award (1999)
* the Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Award for Humanitarian Contributions to the Health of Humankind from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (1999)
* the New York Academy of Medicine Lifetime Achievement Award (1997)
* the Breslow Award in Public Health (1995)

He has also won top awards from the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and Ebony magazine. An academic society at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine is named in Satcher&#x27;s honor, and, in 2009, he delivered the university&#x27;s Commencement Address. The Case Western Reserve School of Medicine also created the David Satcher Clerkship for Underrepresented Minority Students in 1991. The clerkships hosts four to eight minority fourth-year medical students from outside of northeast Ohio at University Hospitals, where they receive exposure to career opportunities in an academic medical center as a part of the residency recruitment process.

<doc id="1099995" wikidata="Q2340960" url="?curid=1099995" title="Abortion in Brazil">
<text>Abortion is generally illegal in Brazil. Penalties range from one to three years of imprisonment for the recipient of the abortion, and one to four years of imprisonment for the doctor or any other person who performs the abortion on someone else. In three specific situations in Brazil, induced abortion is not punishable by law: in cases of risk to the pregnant woman’s life; when the pregnancy is the result of rape; and if the fetus is anencephalic. In these cases, the Brazilian government provides the abortion procedure free of charge through the &quot;Sistema Único de Saúde&quot; (Unified Health System). This does not mean that the law regards abortion in these cases as a right, but only that women who receive abortions under these circumstances, and the doctors, will not be punished. The punishment for a woman who performs an abortion on herself or consents to an abortion performed by another outside these legal exceptions is one to three years of detention. The base penalty for a third party that performs an illegal abortion with the consent of the patient, ranges from one to four years of detention, with the possibility of increase by a third if the woman comes to any physical harm, and can be doubled if she dies. Criminal penalties fixed at four years or less can be converted to non-incarceration punishments, such as community service and compulsory donation to charity.

Brazil is a signatory of the American Human Rights Convention, also called the Pact of San José. The Convention grants the right to life to human embryos, &quot;in general, from the moment of conception&quot;, and has a legal status on a par with the Constitution in Brazilian Law. The Civil Code of Brazil also provides rights to fetuses and embryos. In a 2008 case, however, the Supreme Federal Court ruled, by a 6–5 vote, that the right to life applies only to intrauterine embryos, and that frozen embryos not eligible to a uterus transfer do not hold fundamental rights and may be used for research purposes. In 2012, the Supreme Court also authorized the abortion of anencephalic fetuses.

On November 29, 2016, the Supreme Court in Brazil ruled in a non-binding decision that &quot;abortion should not be a crime when performed in the first three months of pregnancy&quot;. This ruling was controversial because the Brazilian government had passed a bill earlier in 2016 which aimed to make Brazilian law on abortion even stricter. As of September 2023, the Court is considering a case that could decriminalise abortion up to twelve weeks; in one of her final statements before retiring as the Court&#x27;s President, Rosa Weber, made a public statement stating that motherhood should be a choice and not an obligation.

==History==

Abortion was criminalized in all circumstances in the penal code from 1890. In 1940, the penal code provisions on abortion waived punishment on abortion in the case of rape or incest, or if the pregnant women&#x27;s life was in danger. A presidential decree in 1941, as amended in 1979, banned the advertising of a process, substance, or object designed to prevent pregnancy or cause an abortion. 

== Statistics ==
The number of clandestine abortions taking place in Brazil is a controversial subject which divides anti-abortion and abortion rights activists. A study published by the International Journal of Women&#x27;s Health in 2014, estimated that in Brazil about 48 thousand clandestine abortions occurs annually. Abortion rights institutes like Anis - Bioethics Institute, however, estimate a much higher number.
More recent studies published in the International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics suggest that, despite Brazil&#x27;s severe legislation, 500,000 illegal abortions are estimated to occur every year among women aged 18–39 years – or one in five Brazilian women.

== Impact to women&#x27;s health ==
In 2010, it was reported that 200,000 women a year were hospitalized for complications due to abortion (which includes both miscarriages and clandestine abortions). More recent figures estimate that around 250,000 women are hospitalized every year due to illegal abortion complications, or 50% of all illegal abortions estimated per year. Those figures contrast with 2–5% of women requiring medical care after an abortion in countries where abortion is legal. The majority of women admitted at hospital after an illegal abortion are uninsured, representing a government cost of more than US$10 million every year. More than 200 women die every year in Brazil, as a direct consequence of unsafe abortions. The prevalence of reproductive complications and other negative health consequences associated with illegal abortion is unknown.

==Methods==
In a 2005 survey, one third of the Brazilian doctors who reported having performed abortions, used dilation and curettage. They have little experience with vacuum aspiration but they are aware of it as a method. They have a general awareness of medical abortion using misoprostol (Cytotec) or other prostaglandins to induce abortion but less experience with it. Few know of newer and more effective regimens using mifepristone or methotrexate.

The 2005 survey also found considerable ignorance of Brazil&#x27;s law on abortion, with only 48% of the physicians knowing that it is legal to save a woman&#x27;s life and widespread confusion about fetal age limits. An earlier survey found that two-thirds of Brazilian OB-GYNs incorrectly believed that a judicial order is required to obtain a legal abortion and only 27% knew that the woman needed to make a written request to obtain a legal abortion. Those doctors cannot give accurate information to their patients.

In non-hospital settings, women&#x27;s folk medicine allegedly brings on the menstrual flow rather than causing an abortion. &quot;Two folk medical conditions, &quot;delayed&quot; (atrasada) and &quot;suspended&quot; (suspendida) menstruation, are described as perceived by poor Brazilian women in Northeast Brazil. Culturally prescribed methods to &quot;regulate&quot; these conditions and induce menstrual bleeding are also described, including ingesting herbal remedies, patent drugs, and modern pharmaceuticals.&quot;
Some women, if financially able, will travel abroad to have abortions, with Cuba, Mexico, Guyana, Aruba, Curacao, French Guiana, and the United States being some of the countries women travel to.

==Public opinion==
 In a survey made in Ribeirão Preto (SP) in 2004, 70% of the Brazilian doctors responded that they didn&#x27;t support the decriminalization of abortion in the country. The survey also suggested that 77% of the doctors of this region rejected the opinion that abortion should be carried out solely because of the woman&#x27;s desire. Furthermore it suggested that 82.5% of these doctors also reject the legalization of abortion due to socioeconomic difficulties. Finally, in the case of a possible legalization, 17.5% of them would agree to carry it out professionally.

A March 2007 Datafolha/&quot;Folha de S.Paulo&quot; poll found that 65% of Brazilians believe that their country&#x27;s current law &quot;should not be modified&quot;, 16% that it should be expanded &quot;to allow abortion in other cases&quot;, 10% that abortion should be &quot;decriminalized&quot;, and 5% were &quot;not sure&quot;.

Another poll on this issue was made in December 2010, by the polling institute Vox Populi. This study revealed that 82% of Brazilians consider that the current law on abortion should not be modified, while 14% consider that abortion should be decriminalized, and 4% declare to have no position on the matter.

In case of fetuses with microcephaly caused by Zika virus, 58% of the population expressed opposition.

Following the impeachment of former leftist President Dilma Rousseff, A survey of the Instituto Patricia Galvão, in 2017, showed that 62% of Brazilians opposed the idea of the legalization of abortion, while 26% supported the measure, another 10% could not answer. The opinion polls carried out by the Paraná Research Institute in the same year also concluded that 86.5% of Brazilians were against the decriminalization.

According to the Ibope (largest research institute in Brazil), in 2018, eight out of ten Brazilians oppose legalization. In a survey conducted in 2018, by the Datafolha Institute, 41% of Brazilians declared themselves in favor of a complete ban on abortion, 34% said they wanted to keep the legislation as it is, 16% said that they wanted to expand it to more situations and 6% said they were in favor of legalizing abortion under any circumstances. The anti-abortion view is also followed by the majority of federal deputies, which makes it virtually impossible to attempt to legalize abortion through the Legislative Branch. All of this has led the small group of abortion supporters to appeal to the Supreme Court, claiming that criminalization of abortion, &quot;violates fundamental human precepts&quot;.

In 2021, a survey conducted by PoderData found that 58% of Brazilians are against the legalization of abortion in Brazil; those who are favorable of legalization add up to 31%. Another 11% did not know or did not respond. Another survey conducted in 2021 by Paraná Pesquisas, however, found that 79% of Brazilians remain against the legalization of abortion, and 16.6% are favorable to it.

In all the surveys carried out, in general, Brazilians are considered one of the peoples least in favor of legalizing abortion. Currently, Brazil is the biggest country in the world to ban abortion in the name of the recognition of the rights of the unborn.

==Excommunication controversy==

In March 2009, after an abortion on a nine-year-old girl raped by her stepfather and pregnant with twins had been performed because of the rape exception clause in Brazil’s Penal Code, Archbishop José Cardoso Sobrinho of Olinda and Recife stated that automatic excommunication had been incurred by the girl&#x27;s mother and the medical team. President Lula da Silva and Health Minister José Gomes Temporão decried his statement, and the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil disowned it, saying that the mother was certainly not excommunicated and there was insufficient evidence to show that any member of the medical team was. The statement was criticized also on the Vatican newspaper by the President of the Pontifical Academy for Life. One of the doctors concerned said the controversy had drawn needed attention to Brazil&#x27;s restrictive abortion laws.

==Anencephaly exception==
In July 2004, a Brazilian federal judge issued a preliminary ruling that waived the requirement for court authorization for abortions in cases of fetuses with anencephaly. The Brazilian Council of Bishops lobbied against the ruling and the National Confederation of Healthcare Workers wanted to make the exception permanent. In October 2004, the full Brazilian Supreme Court convened and voted 7–4 to suspend the judge&#x27;s ruling until the full tribunal had the opportunity to deliberate and rule on the matter.

A 2005 study found that 53% of doctors had performed an abortion in the case of a severely deformed fetus, even though that was not allowed by Brazilian law without a court order. Doctors who thought that the law should be more liberal were more likely to have correct knowledge of abortion law and to be familiar with the abortion law regarding severe fetal malformations.

On April 12, 2012, the Supreme Federal Court ruled by an 8–2 vote to legalize abortion in cases of fetuses with anencephaly, saying that children with anencephaly were biologically alive but that they were not a person, and therefore had no rights. The Catholic Church and Brazilian Pro-Life movements criticized the decision of the court, saying that even with a terminal illness, children with anencephaly also had the right to life.

<doc id="1100001" wikidata="Q17010049" url="?curid=1100001" title="Einselection">
<text>In quantum mechanics, einselections, short for &quot;environment-induced superselection&quot;, is a name coined by Wojciech H. Zurek
for a process which is claimed to explain the appearance of wavefunction collapse and the emergence of classical descriptions of reality from quantum descriptions. In this approach, classicality is described as an emergent property induced in open quantum systems by their environments. Due to the interaction with the environment, the vast majority of states in the Hilbert space of a quantum open system become highly unstable due to entangling interaction with the environment, which in effect monitors selected observables of the system. After a decoherence time, which for macroscopic objects is typically many orders of magnitude shorter than any other dynamical timescale, a generic quantum state decays into an uncertain state which can be expressed as a mixture of simple pointer states. In this way the environment induces effective superselection rules. Thus, einselection precludes stable existence of pure superpositions of pointer states. These &#x27;pointer states&#x27; are stable despite environmental interaction. The einselected states lack coherence, and therefore do not exhibit the quantum behaviours of entanglement and superposition.

Advocates of this approach argue that since only quasi-local, essentially classical states survive the decoherence process, einselection can in many ways explain the emergence of a (seemingly) classical reality in a fundamentally quantum universe (at least to local observers). However, the basic program has been criticized as relying on a circular argument (e.g. by Ruth Kastner). So the question of whether the &#x27;einselection&#x27; account can really explain the phenomenon of wave function collapse remains unsettled.

==Definition==
Zurek has defined einselection as follows: &quot;Decoherence leads to einselection when the states of the environment formula_1 corresponding to different pointer states become orthogonal:
formula_2&quot;,

==Details==
Einselected pointer states are distinguished by their ability to persist in spite of the environmental monitoring and therefore are the ones in which quantum open systems are observed. Understanding the nature of these states and the process of their dynamical selection is of fundamental importance. This process has been studied first in a measurement situation: When the system is an apparatus whose intrinsic dynamics can be neglected, pointer states turn out to be eigenstates of the interaction Hamiltonian between the apparatus and its environment. In more general situations, when the system&#x27;s dynamics is relevant, einselection is more complicated. Pointer states result from the interplay between self-evolution and environmental monitoring.

To study einselection, an operational definition of pointer states has been introduced.
This is the &quot;predictability sieve&quot; criterion, based on an intuitive idea: &quot;Pointer states&quot; can be defined as the ones which become minimally entangled with the environment in the course of their evolution. The predictability sieve criterion is a way to quantify this idea by using the following algorithmic procedure: For every initial pure state formula_3, one measures the entanglement generated dynamically between the system and the environment by computing the entropy:
::formula_4
or some other measure of predictability from the reduced density matrix of the system formula_5 (which is initially formula_6). 
The entropy is a function of time and a functional of the initial state formula_7. Pointer states are obtained by minimizing formula_8 over formula_7 and demanding that the answer be robust when varying the time formula_10.

The nature of pointer states has been investigated using the predictability sieve criterion only for a limited number of examples. Apart from the already mentioned case of the measurement situation (where pointer states are simply eigenstates of the interaction Hamiltonian) the most notable example is that of a quantum Brownian particle coupled through its position with a bath of independent harmonic oscillators. In such case pointer states are localized in phase space, even though the interaction Hamiltonian involves the position of the particle. Pointer states are the result of the interplay between self-evolution and interaction with the environment and turn out to be coherent states.

There is also a quantum limit of decoherence: When the spacing between energy levels of the system is large compared to the frequencies present in the environment, energy eigenstates are einselected nearly independently of the nature of the system-environment coupling.

== Collisional decoherence ==

There has been significant work on correctly identifying the pointer states in the case of a massive particle decohered by collisions with a fluid environment, often known as &quot;collisional decoherence&quot;. In particular, Busse and Hornberger have identified certain solitonic wavepackets as being unusually stable in the presence of such decoherence.

<text>Valiant Comics is an American comic book publisher, the first incarnation of which was founded in 1989 by former Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Jim Shooter along with lawyer and businessman Steven Massarsky. In 1994, the company was sold to Acclaim Entertainment. After Acclaim’s 2004 bankruptcy, the company’s assets were purchased as part of Valiant Entertainment by entrepreneurs Dinesh Shamdasani and Jason Kothari in 2005. In 2011, Valiant received a capital infusion from private investment company Cuneo &amp; Company, LLC. Peter Cuneo and Gavin Cuneo joined the company and a relaunch was announced. 

Valiant Entertainment launched its publishing division in 2012 as part of an initiative dubbed the &quot;Summer of Valiant&quot;, winning Publisher of the Year and being nominated for Book of the Year at the Diamond Gem Awards. Valiant has set sales records, and was the most nominated publisher in comics at the 2014, 2015 and 2016 Harvey Awards, releasing the biggest-selling independent crossover event of the decade with &quot;Book of Death&quot; in 2015. 

Valiant was sold to DMG Entertainment in 2018. In June 2023, Valiant Comics announced a licensing partnership with Alien Books, which would take over publishing Valiant&#x27;s characters.

The company&#x27;s properties have been adapted to other media, including video games, digital series, and collectible figures. The character Bloodshot was adapted into an eponymous 2020 feature film starring Vin Diesel.

==Publication history==
===Voyager Communications===

In 1988, former editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics Jim Shooter, Steven J. Massarsky and a group of investors attempted to purchase Marvel Entertainment. They submitted the second-highest bid, with financier Ronald Perelman submitting the highest bid and acquiring Marvel. Shooter and Massarsky instead formed Voyager Communications in 1989 with significant venture capital financing from Triumph Capital. Valiant (an imprint of Voyager Communications) recruited numerous writers and artists from Marvel, including Barry Windsor-Smith and Bob Layton, and launched an interconnected line of superhero comics featuring a mixture of characters licensed from Western Publishing and original creations.

In 1991, Valiant released its first title, &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot;, cover-dated May 1991. &quot;Solar, Man of the Atom&quot;, cover-dated September 1991 followed as the next release. Both titles were licenses from Gold Key Comics. &quot;Rai&quot; became the third title published by Valiant and was distributed as a special insert in &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot; beginning with issue 5. &quot;Harbinger&quot; No. 1 was listed on the top ten list of &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine for a record eight consecutive months and was eventually named &quot;Collectible of the Decade&quot; while &quot;Rai&quot; No. 0 appeared on &quot;Wizard&quot;&#x27;s top ten list for a new record nine consecutive months. In 1992, Valiant won the Best Publisher under 5% Market Share from comic distributor Diamond. The next year, Valiant won Best Publisher over 5% Market Share, becoming the first publisher outside of Marvel and DC to do so. In 1992, Valiant&#x27;s Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter was given the Lifetime Achievement Award for co-creating the Valiant Universe in a ceremony that also honored Stan Lee for co-creating the Marvel Universe. However, Shooter left Valiant by the end of 1992. According to Massarsky, &quot;Jim had a different idea as to the direction of the company, and he was asked to leave.&quot;

Valiant also engaged in several comic book-marketing innovations common in the 1990s, such as issue zero &quot;origin&quot; issues, the gold logo program, coupons redeemable for original comic books, and chromium covers. Following the conclusion of the &quot;Unity&quot; crossover in September 1992, Valiant released &quot;Bloodshot&quot;, &quot;Ninjak&quot;, &quot;H.A.R.D. Corps&quot;, &quot;The Second Life of Dr. Mirage&quot;, and &quot;Timewalker&quot;, among other titles.

===Acclaim Comics===
In 1994, Voyager Communications was purchased by video game developer and publisher Acclaim Entertainment for $65 million. Acclaim Comics created a number of video games based on Valiant properties, such as &quot;Shadow Man&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Iron Man and X-O Manowar in Heavy Metal&quot;, which featured Valiant&#x27;s X-O Manowar alongside Marvel&#x27;s Iron Man. In 2004, after losing a major sports video game license, Acclaim became financially insolvent and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

In 2005, the rights to Valiant/Acclaim&#x27;s original characters such as &quot;Archer and Armstrong&quot;, &quot;Rai&quot;, and &quot;Quantum and Woody&quot; were auctioned off and bought by Valiant Entertainment, while the rights to the three licensed characters (&quot;Solar&quot;, &quot;Magnus&quot; and &quot;Turok&quot;) reverted to Classic Media (then-owner of the Gold Key Comics properties), which was acquired by DreamWorks Animation SKG in July 2012. DreamWorks itself was bought by Universal Studios on August 22, 2016.

===Valiant Entertainment===

In 2005, a group of entrepreneurs led by Dinesh Shamdasani and Jason Kothari raised financing and acquired the rights to the Valiant Comics library from Acclaim Entertainment&#x27;s estate, forming Valiant Entertainment. In 2007, Valiant hired former Valiant Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter to write new short stories that would accompany hardcover reprints of classic Valiant Universe stories. Two of the three collections were named among &quot;The Ten Best Collected Editions&quot; of their respective years of publications.. In 2011, Valiant announced that it had received a capital investment from Cuneo &amp; Company.  Former Marvel Comics CEO and Vice Chairman Peter Cuneo was named Valiant&#x27;s Chairman and Gavin Cuneo became CFO and COO. Valiant then hired former Marvel editor Warren Simons as Executive Editor and former President of Wizard, Magazine, Fred Pierce, as Publisher.

In 2012, Valiant Entertainment began publishing new monthly comic books based on the Valiant Comics universe of characters.

In an event dubbed The Summer of Valiant in 2012, Valiant Entertainment launched the Valiant Comics universe with four ongoing titles, &quot;X-O Manowar&quot;, &quot;Harbinger&quot;, &quot;Bloodshot&quot; and &quot;Archer &amp; Armstrong&quot;, one launching each month for four months. &quot;X-O Manowar&quot; premiered May 2, 2012, with the creative team of writer Robert Venditti and artist Cary Nord. The first issue of &quot;X-O Manowar&quot; received over 42,000 preorders, making Valiant the largest new publisher launch in over a decade, and eventually sold through 4 full-priced printings and 3 additional reduced-priced printings. The release of &quot;X-O Manowar&quot; was followed by &quot;Harbinger&quot;, launched in June 2012 by writer Joshua Dysart and artist Khari Evans; &quot;Bloodshot&quot;, launched in July 2012 by writer Duane Swierczynski and artist Manuel Garcia; and &quot;Archer &amp; Armstrong&quot;, launched in August 2012 by writer Fred Van Lente and artist Clayton Henry.

To coincide with the launch of publishing in 2012, Valiant introduced the &quot;Pullbox Program&quot;, which encourages readers to start a pull box subscription for the title being launched with their comics store to obtain an exclusive alternate cover version of the comic, and the &quot;QR Voice Variant&quot;, where the reader&#x27;s smartphone, after scanning a QR code on the cover of the comic, plays a video of the figure&#x27;s mouth, giving the impression that the figure has come to life and is talking to the reader.

Valiant Entertainment extended The Summer of Valiant 2012 event and added a fifth ongoing title with &quot;Shadowman&quot; in November 2012 by writer Justin Jordan and artist Patrick Zircher. The comic debuted as the number 1, non-Marvel and/or DC comic of the month. That month, Valiant announced it would exclusively distribute its digital comics through ComiXology (later acquired by Amazon).

In February 13, Valiant won Comic Book Publisher of the Year – Under 4% and was nominated for Best Comic Book of the Year – Over $3.00 &quot;X-O Manowar&quot; # 1 at the Diamond Gem Awards.

In January 2013, Valiant announced that Chief Creative Officer and co-founder Dinesh Shamdasani had been promoted to CEO &amp; Chief Creative Officer and Jason Kothari was leaving management. That March, Valiant and Kamite Announced a partnership for Spanish language publishing in Mexico. 
In May 2013, Valiant announced The Summer of Valiant 2013, during which the company would launch two new ongoing titles, &quot;Quantum &amp; Woody&quot; and &quot;Eternal Warrior&quot;, and publish a special &quot;Bloodshot&quot; zero issue. &quot;Quantum &amp; Woody&quot;, written by James Asmus and drawn by Tom Fowler, launched in July 2013, and became the most-nominated title at the 2014 Harvey Awards. That November, Amazon announced a new license from Valiant Entertainment for its Kindle Worlds platform, Panini and Valiant announced a partnership for foreign language print and digital publishing in France, Italy, and other territories, and Valiant announced ComicCube Publishing as its launch partner in China.

Several of Valiant&#x27;s launch titles reached their planned conclusions in 2014, with &quot;Harbinger&quot;, &quot;Bloodshot&quot;, and &quot;Archer &amp; Armstrong&quot; all concluding. Valiant celebrated the milestones by publishing a 48-page anniversary issue for each series&#x27; twenty-fifth issue, and hinting at new directions for the characters. Ongoing series such as &quot;X-O Manowar&quot;, &quot;Unity&quot;, and &quot;Rai&quot; continued, and were coupled with limited series such as &quot;Harbinger: Omegas&quot;, &quot;Eternal Warrior: Days of Steel&quot;, &quot;The Death-Defying Dr. Mirage&quot; and &quot;The Delinquents&quot;. In December 2013, Valiant announced the 2014 &quot;Armor Hunters&quot; crossover storyline, consisting of a four-issue &quot;Armor Hunter&quot; mini-series and issues of &quot;XO-Manowar&quot; and &quot;Unity&quot;. In April 2014, Valiant announced several new partnerships with digital distributors, including Visionbooks, to distribute a form of animated Valiant comic books for digital devices. That August, Valiant joined Madefire digital comics on iOS and Android for day-and-date digital releases and digital collections, and also joined iVerse’s ComicsPlus with a complete digital comics library.

Following the conclusion of &quot;Armor Hunters&quot;, Valiant announced its Valiant Next initiative. Launching in December 2014 with the miniseries &quot;The Valiant&quot;, it continued through 2015 with the ongoing titles &quot;Ninjak&quot;, &quot;Imperium&quot;, &quot;Ivar, Timewalker&quot; and &quot;Bloodshot Reborn&quot; and the miniseries &quot;Divinity&quot;. For the summer of 2015, Valiant announced the event miniseries &quot;Book of Death&quot;, accompanied by one-shots &quot;Book of Death: The Fall of Bloodshot&quot;, &quot;Book of Death: The Fall of Ninjak&quot;, &quot;Book of Death: The Fall of Harbinger&quot; and &quot;Book of Death: The Fall of X-O Manowar&quot; and the miniseries &quot;Book of Death: Legends of the Geomancer&quot;. &quot;Book of Death&quot; was one of the best-reviewed comics of the year and the biggest selling independent crossover event of the decade. Spinning out from &quot;Book of Death&quot;, the ongoing series &quot;Wrath of the Eternal Warrior&quot; launched in November 2015.

In 2015, Valiant renewed its print distribution agreement with Diamond Distributors, making Diamond the worldwide distributor of Valiant&#x27;s comics and graphic novels within comic book specialty and book markets worldwide. 

In 2017, Valiant added ten new international publishing partnerships for China, India, South Korea, Pakistan and other comic book specialty and book markets worldwide.

In January 2016, Valiant announced at Valiant Summit 2016 that Valiant would spend 2016 focusing on expanding its universe of characters beyond its core titles, launching brand new characters in the &quot;Britannia&quot; and &quot;Savage&quot; miniseries; expanding Divinity in two sequels — &quot;Divinity II&quot; and &quot;Divinity III: Stalinverse&quot;; and elevating supporting characters from the &quot;Harbinger&quot; title in two new miniseries — &quot;Generation Zero&quot; and &quot;Faith&quot;. That same month, a four-issue &quot;Faith&quot; miniseries launched, garnering significant media interest, and was one of only a handful of series in the past decade to reach a fifth printing.

In July 2016, Valiant was nominated for 50 Harvey Awards, the most nominations for any publisher that year, including eight for &quot;Bloodshot Reborn&quot;.

In 2017, Valiant added ten new international publishing partnerships for China, India, South Korea, Pakistan and other international markets.
