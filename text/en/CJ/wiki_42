<text>The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York is the governing board of Columbia University in New York City. Founded in 1754, it is sometimes referred to as the Columbia Corporation. The Trustees of Columbia University is a 501(c)3 and the owner of the property and real assets of the university. They are legally distinct from affiliates of the university, which include Barnard College, Jewish Theological Seminary, Teachers College, and Union Theological Seminary, which are themselves separate legal entities. 

The board of trustees was originally composed of &quot;ex officio&quot; members including officials from the New York colonial government, crown officials, and various Protestant ministers from the city. Following the college&#x27;s resuscitation following the American Revolutionary War, it was placed under the control of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York, and the university would finally come under the control of a private board of trustees in 1787. The board is notable for having administered the Pulitzer Prize from the prize&#x27;s establishment until 1975. 

As of 2024, the trustees consists of 21 members and is co-chaired by David Greenwald and Claire Shipman.

== Structure and function ==

The board is governed by a maximum of 24 trustees, including the president of the university, who serves &quot;ex officio.&quot; Six of the 24 candidates are nominated from a pool of candidates selected by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the University Senate. The remaining 12 are nominated by the trustees through an internal process. The board elects its own chair; the first woman to serve as chair, and the first to chair the governing board of any Ivy League university, was Gertrude Michelson, elected in 1989. The term of office for the trustees is six years and trustees serve for no more than two consecutive terms.

The trustees have met in dedicated room in Low Memorial Library since 1897. They select the President, oversee all faculty and senior administrative appointments, monitor the budget, supervise the endowment, and protect university property. The board of trustees holds the exclusive power to grant degrees, including, by memoranda of understanding, to the affiliated institutions of Barnard College and Teachers College. The trustees also oversaw the Pulitzer Prizes until 1975, when authority over the prizes was devolved to a separate board.

==Early history==

The board of trustees was originally established in 1754 as the board of governors of King&#x27;s College with 41 members, replacing the ten-member Lottery Commission appointed by the New York Assembly to oversee lottery funds allocated to the establishment of the college. The board of governors originally included several &quot;ex officio&quot; members, including, crown officials, members of the colonial government, and ministers of various Protestant denominations:

A further twenty-four individuals were named in the charter, serving without terms with their successors to be selected by subsequent governors. College faculty were not provided seats &quot;ex officio&quot; on the board of governors, at variance with contemporary practice at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, where the faculty was engaged in the governance of their colleges, but was very much in line with practice of other colonial colleges governed by external boards.

The charter permitted Protestants to serve as governors but excluded Roman Catholics and Jews. Only three members would be Anglicans: the Archbishop of Canterbury, the rector of Trinity Church, and the President of Columbia University, and they were offset by four &quot;ex officio&quot; members selected from New York&#x27;s Dutch Reformed Church, French Protestant church, Lutheran Church, and Presbyterian Church. In practice, the board was dominated by Anglicans, members of the Trinity Church, and the Dutch Reformed Church. Of the fifty-nine men who served as governors, only three &quot;ex officio&quot; members were not from the Anglican or Dutch Reformed churches.

More than half of the fifty-nine New Yorkers who served as governor made their livings as merchants. The next most common occupation among the governors was law (20 percent), followed by ministers (16 percent), and there was only one doctor. The governors met 102 times in 22 years and most meetings were attended by around fifteen governors. A quarter of the governors attended fewer than ten meetings, and another half were absent, leaving a core of sixteen governors. Academic matters such as faculty appointments, the curriculum, and admissions requirements were overseen by degree-bearing ministers, while governors drawing from the city&#x27;s mercantile and legal ranks oversaw financial matters such as construction of collegiate buildings or the salary of the college steward. This informal division of duties survived the reorganization of the King&#x27;s College into Columbia College and persisted into the 1960s.

In terms of politics, the ratio of Loyalists to Patriots during the American Revolution among the governors was more than eight to one. The college was severely affected by the revolutionary war, which forced the college to shut down for eight years and a number of governors fled to Canada and the West Indies.

In 1784, it became the Board of Regents of Columbia College after the former King&#x27;s College was reinstated. The 1784 charter also stipulated that eight of the seats on the board should be held by ranking state officials ex officio, with the remaining 24 regents to be appointed, two each, from the state&#x27;s 12 counties, with only three places reserved for New York City residents. The number of regents was subsequently expanded to 33 by the New York State Legislature, with 20 of them residents of New York City, including a mix of prominent politicians and clergymen such as John Jay, Samuel Provoost, Leonard Lispenard, Gershom Mendes Seixas, and John Daniel Gros.

It was renamed in a new 1787 charter as the Trustees of Columbia College in the City of New York, and the college was relieved of its duties as a state institution, returning to earlier status as a privately governed college serving the city. None of the college&#x27;s trustees were to be state officials, and all replacements were to be elected by incumbent board members. Only until 1908 did the board start accepting alumni nominations.

The board arrived at its final name of The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York by an order from the Supreme Court of New York in 1912, 16 years after Columbia College was renamed as Columbia University.

==Controversies==

Although the trustees usually approve faculty recommendations for hiring and dismissal of Columbia faculty, in some cases they have taken a more direct role. Notably, in 1917 they fired psychologist James McKeen Cattell for his anti-war and anti-conscription views, a case significant in the history of academic freedom.

The trustees&#x27; oversight of the Pulitzer Prizes, which ended in 1975, was not without controversy. An early example of this occurred in 1921, when the trustees overruled the jury recommendation and awarded the fiction prize to Edith Wharton for &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; instead of the recommendation of Sinclair Lewis for &quot;Main Street&quot;. A similar controversy ensued in 1962, when the trustees overruled the jury&#x27;s choice of a biography of William Randolph Hearst by W. A. Swanberg, &quot;Citizen Hearst&quot;, instead choosing to give no award in that category.

The trustees have been blamed for the violent suppression of protestors in the Columbia University protests of 1968, after they instructed the university administration to call in the police against the protestors and later lauded the police for their efforts.

In 2001, the trustees were accused of pressuring the university to water down its sexual misconduct policy, and the director of the Office of Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Education resigned in protest, claiming that the trustees had directed her not to discuss the policy changes.

As with most governing boards of private universities, the deliberations of the trustees are confidential, and despite any internal disagreements the trustees generally present a unified front to the public on the decisions they have taken. A notable exception to this occurred in 2012, when trustee Jos√© A. Cabranes published a dissenting opinion on the status of Columbia College and its core curriculum within the university, in a column in Columbia&#x27;s student newspaper, the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot;.

During the 2024 Columbia University pro-Palestinian campus occupation a group of 21 members of the United States House of Representatives suggested that the trustees resign if they were unwilling to call in the NYPD to arrest student protestors.

<doc id="1094171" wikidata="Q6456023" url="?curid=1094171" title="L'√âtranger (band)">
<text>L&#x27;√âtranger (&quot;The Stranger&quot; or &quot;The Outsider&quot;) was a Canadian punk rock band based in Toronto, Ontario. Named for the novel &quot;L&#x27;√âtranger&quot; by Albert Camus, the band played a politically minded brand of punk music that drew on both Clash influences and the band members&#x27; social justice-oriented Roman Catholic faith. The band was best known for their anti-apartheid single &quot;One People&quot;, one of the first independent videos ever to gain airplay on the then new MuchMusic.

==History==
L&#x27;√âtranger was founded in 1980 in Toronto, Ontario. by childhood friends, singer/songwriter and guitarist Andrew Cash and bassist Charlie Angus, along with drummer Peter Duffin. That lineup released one six-song EP, &quot;Innocent Hands&quot; in 1982. The songs were composed by Cash and Angus, and some had political themes; some critics referred to the band as &quot;Gang of Four with a sense of humour&quot;.

At that time the band was playing in various clubs and music venues in Toronto, performing regularly at the Cabana Room in the Spadina Hotel. Bruce Meikle, under the stage name &quot;Bruce P.M.&quot;, was added to the line-up in time for the second EP, 1984&#x27;s &quot;Running Out of Funtown&quot;. The band was by then performing more widely around Ontario, managed by James Booth.

Angus left the band to form Grievous Angels, and was replaced by Tim Vesely for the band&#x27;s final EP, &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; in 1986. Liner notes for the EP mention him as a group member who was not involved in the recording.

L&#x27;√âtranger disbanded later in 1986, and Cash began performing as a solo artist. His first solo release was a reissue of &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot;. He went on to record several albums as a solo singer-songwriter and as a member of The Cash Brothers, and also worked as a freelance journalist. Duffin later co-founded the acoustic pop band Barnhouse Static with Canadian songwriter Kathy Evans.

As of 2011, Angus and Cash were both in politics, sitting in the House of Commons of Canada as members of the New Democratic Party caucus. Cash lost a re-election bid in 2015, although Angus remains a Member of Parliament as of 2023. Angus ran as a candidate for the leadership of the New Democratic Party in 2017 and came in second place.

<text>The New Zealand Post Office (NZPO) was a government department of New Zealand until 1987. It was previously (from 1881 to 1959) named the New Zealand Post and Telegraph Department (NZ P&amp;T).

As a government department, the New Zealand Post Office had as its political head the Postmaster General, who was a member of Cabinet, and, when it was a separate department, the Minister of Telegraphs.

The NZPO was similar to the British Post Office or &quot;GPO&quot;, and so was similar to European &quot;PTT&quot; or postal, telegraph and telephone services, which were government monopolies.

== History ==

===19th century===
Official postal services started in New Zealand after Captain William Hobson arrived in the Bay of Islands and took up his role as Lieutenant-Governor. Hobson appointed William Clayton Hayes as Clerk to the Bench of Magistrates and Postmaster and the first official post office was opened at Kororareka, now called Russell. Hayes holds the distinction of being New Zealand&#x27;s first civil servant to be dismissed as he neglected his duty and was continually inebriated. By 1845 post offices had also been opened at Rawene, Auckland, New Plymouth, Whanganui, Wellington, Nelson and Akaroa.

The establishment of settlements across the North and South Islands meant the need for an internal postal service was becoming more and more important, but New Zealand&#x27;s geography, ongoing wars between MƒÅori and Europeans and intertribal fighting hindered communication. At the time, shipping mail coast-to-coast, although inefficient, was the most reliable means of transporting mail around the country. A monthly shipping service to Sydney, where mail was exchanged with outbound and inbound London ships, saw the first regular overseas mail service established.

The Local Posts Act of 1856 gave provincial councils the authority to create their own mail services and local post offices, while the Government continued to maintain the overland trunk postal routes and the head post office in each province. The Post Office Act of 1858 repealed the Local Posts Act, establishing the Post Office Department as a government department, reporting to the Postmaster General, and providing for its administration. By 1880 there were 856 post offices.

The Post Office Department was merged with the Electric Telegraph Department in 1881 to create the New Zealand Post and Telegraph Department.

===20th century===

By the beginning of the 20th century, the New Zealand Post Office had over 1,700 branches and continued to grow rapidly throughout the century. As well as postal services it ran a savings bank and was responsible for telephone services. The rapid increase in private telephones in people&#x27;s homes, and the introduction of internal and international airmail services in the 1930s, contributed to its growth.

The New Zealand Post and Telegraph Department was renamed the New Zealand Post Office in 1959. As well as traditional communication services, the Post Office provided community services including registering births, marriages, deaths and cars, accepting television and fishing licence fees, enrolling people to vote, and collecting pensions. Post Offices also provided daily weather and temperature checks for the Meteorological Office, and postmasters were able to perform marriage ceremonies. Throughout the 20th century, the Post Office was New Zealand&#x27;s biggest employer.

In the 1960s and 70s steps were taken towards better managing the ever-increasing volumes of national and international mail: the installation of New Zealand&#x27;s first mechanical mail sorting machine in the Auckland parcel depot, and the introduction of address postal codes to simplify bulk mail sorting. However, increasingly the tension between political and commercial pressures meant the business was not operating efficiently.

By the 1980s, the variety of roles, the sometimes-conflicting needs of three different businesses, and political considerations were major constraints on the Post Office. It was increasingly unable to meet growing consumer demands and the postal side alone was losing over $20 million a year, with expectations that this would balloon in the future.

In 1985, Jonathan Hunt, Postmaster General, ordered a review of the organisational and management structure of the Post Office. The subsequent Mason-Morris report of 1986 called for sweeping changes, separating the three core businesses to operate as independent State-owned corporations.

===Abolition===
On 1 April 1987, the department was abolished under the &quot;Postal Services Act 1987&quot;, and three state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were formed, responsible to the Minister of State Owned Enterprises, initially from 14 August 1989 Stan Rodger. 
* New Zealand Post Limited 
* Post Office Bank Limited
* Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Limited 
**Telecom was subsequently split into (as a condition of participating in Ultra-Fast Broadband): 
::Chorus Limited (a regulated monopoly (wholesale only) provider of fibre broadband service, and: 
::Spark New Zealand (a retailer and mobile phone service provider. ) 

Of these, due to privatisation, only New Zealand Post remains as an SOE. Telecom was sold to two United States Baby Bells, and PostBank was sold to the Pacific banking conglomerate Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ). The Postbank brand was phased out by the late-1990s. Telecom was floated on the New Zealand Stock Exchange in the early 1990s, per the conditions of its privatisation, and was rebranded in August 2014 as Spark.

In 2001, Kiwibank, a new government-owned bank, was established as a subsidiary of NZ Post.

<doc id="1094182" wikidata="Q409087" url="?curid=1094182" title="Marcasite">
<text>The mineral marcasite, sometimes called &quot;white iron pyrite&quot;, is iron sulfide (FeS2) with orthorhombic crystal structure. It is physically and crystallographically distinct from pyrite, which is iron sulfide with cubic crystal structure. Both structures contain the disulfide S22‚àí ion, having a short bonding distance between the sulfur atoms. The structures differ in how these di-anions are arranged around the Fe2+ cations. Marcasite is lighter and more brittle than pyrite. Specimens of marcasite often crumble and break up due to the unstable crystal structure.

On fresh surfaces, it is pale yellow to almost white and has a bright metallic luster. It tarnishes to a yellowish or brownish color and gives a black streak. It is a brittle material that cannot be scratched with a knife. The thin, flat, tabular crystals, when joined in groups, are called &quot;cockscombs&quot;.

In the late medieval and early modern eras, the word &quot;marcasite&quot; meant all iron sulfides in general, including both pyrite and the mineral marcasite. The narrower, modern scientific definition for marcasite as specifically orthorhombic iron sulfide dates from 1845. Jewellery where pyrite is used as the gemstone is called marcasite jewellery; a term which pre-dates the scientific definition, using the original sense of the word. Marcasite in the scientific sense is not used as a gem due to its brittleness.

==Occurrence==

Marcasite can be formed as both a primary or a secondary mineral. It typically forms under low-temperature, highly acidic conditions. It occurs in sedimentary rocks (shales, limestones and low grade coals) as well as in low temperature hydrothermal veins. Commonly associated minerals include pyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, sphalerite, fluorite, dolomite, and calcite.

As a primary mineral marcasite forms nodules, concretions, and crystals in a variety of sedimentary rock, such as in the chalk layers found on both sides of the English Channel at Dover, Kent, England, and at Cap Blanc-Nez, Pas de Calais, France, where it forms as sharp individual crystals and crystal groups, and nodules (similar to those shown here). Marcasite is also found in complex sulphide deposits. In the Reoc√≠n mine, Cantabria, Spain, appears as crystals grouped in the form of &quot;cockscombs&quot;.

As a secondary mineral, it forms by chemical alteration of a primary mineral, such as pyrrhotite or chalcopyrite.

=== Sedimentary marcasite and low pH ===
In laboratory experiments, marcasite forms preferentially to pyrite at a pH of less than about 5. Ab initio calculations suggest that this is due to pyrite having a higher surface energy (thus being less thermodynamically stable) than marcasite at low pH. 

Due to the association of marcasite with low pH, the occurrence of marcasite in sedimentary rocks in the geologic record implies the presence of highly acidic conditions during the formation and early diagenesis of those rocks. However, sedimentary pore waters below the modern ocean are typically buffered at near-neutral to slightly alkaline pH by dissolved carbonate species. This raises the question of how sedimentary pore waters became sufficiently acidic to promote marcasite formation in the past. 

Several theories have been proposed for the formation of early diagenetic marcasite, including: partial oxidation of primary pyrite by molecular oxygen infiltrating from the overlying water column, and rapid anoxic organic matter decomposition and organic acid generation by fermentation and methanogenesis. 

==Varieties and blends==
Blueite (S.H.Emmons): Nickel variety of marcasite, found in Denison Drury and Townships, Sudbury District, Ontario, Canada.

Lonchidite (August Breithaupt): Arsenic variety of marcasite, found at Churprinz Friedrich August Erbstolln Mine (Kurprinz Mine), Gro√üschirma Freiberg, Ore Mountains, Saxony, Germany; ideal formula Fe(S, As)2.

Synonyms for this variety:
* kausimkies,
* kyrosite,
* lonchandite,
* metalonchidite (Sandberger) described at Bernhard Mine near Hausach (Baden), Germany.

Sperkise: designates a marcasite having twin spearhead crystal on {101}. Sperkise derives from the German Speerkies (&quot;Speer&quot; meaning spear and &quot;Kies&quot; gravel or stone). This twin is very common in the marcasite of a chalky origin, particularly those from the Cap Blanc-Nez.

==Decay==
Marcasite reacts more readily than pyrite under conditions of high humidity. The product of this disintegration is iron(II) sulfate and sulfuric acid. The hydrous iron sulfate forms a white powder consisting of the mineral melanterite, FeSO4¬∑7H2O.

This disintegration of marcasite in mineral collections is known as &quot;pyrite decay&quot;. When a specimen goes through pyrite decay, the marcasite reacts with moisture and oxygen in the air, the sulfur oxidizing and combining with water to produce sulfuric acid that attacks other sulfide minerals and mineral labels. Low humidity (less than 60%) storage conditions prevents or slows the reaction.

==Successful change==

In &quot;Leading Change&quot; (1996), and subsequently in &quot;The Heart of Change&quot; (2002), Kotter describes an eight stage model of successful change in which he seeks to support managers to &quot;lead&quot; change and to understand how people accept, engage with and maintain successful organisational change. The eight stages or steps include the creation of &quot;a sense of urgency&quot; and the use of &quot;short-term wins&quot;.

Short-term wins, within a 6‚Äì18 month window, are considered necessary because &quot;[an] organization has to realize some benefits from [a] change effort to maintain stakeholder commitment&quot;. Kotter asserts that to be useful or influential, short-term wins need to be &quot;visible and unambiguous&quot; as well as &quot;closely related to the change effort&quot;. Arguing against a belief that there is a &quot;trade-off&quot; between wins in the short-term and wins in the long-term, Kotter argues from experience that both are achievable.

<doc id="1094187" wikidata="Q16839135" url="?curid=1094187" title="Giant rat of Sumatra">
<text>The giant rat of Sumatra is a fictional giant rat, first mentioned by Arthur Conan Doyle in &quot;The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire&quot;. As part of the tale, the protagonist, Sherlock Holmes, declares that there is a &quot;story&quot; connected with this rat, presumably a detective case he has handled. The name of the rat and its implied unpublished history were later used in Sherlock Holmes pastiches by many other writers.

==Original reference==
In &quot;The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire&quot;, first published in the January 1924 issues of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in London and &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International Magazine&quot; in New York, Doyle has Sherlock Holmes declare, as an aside, to Dr. Watson:
How the ship, the mammal, and the island of Sumatra are associated is not specified.

==In Sherlockiana==

A number of authors of Sherlockiana have endeavoured to supply the missing adventure of the giant rat of Sumatra, either in non-canonical Holmesian fiction, or as references to the tale in other fictional settings:

* In &quot;The Giant Rat of Sumatra&quot;, an episode of the radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; written by Edith Meiser, and first broadcast on 1 March 1942, Professor Moriarty arranges for the titular rodent, infected with bubonic plague, to be transported to England on board the &quot;Matilda Briggs&quot;. This episode is apparently lost, but is described in some detail by Jim Harmon in his book &quot;The Great Radio Heroes&quot;.
* In &quot;The Spider Woman&quot; (1944), Nigel Bruce&#x27;s Watson briefly reflects on the Giant Rat of Sumatra when looking through a scrapbook of old cases.
* In &quot;Pursuit to Algiers&quot; (1945), a Holmes film starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, Watson tells the story of the Giant Rat of Sumatra to an audience on board a ship.
* &quot;The Tale of the Giant Rat of Sumatra&quot;, a 1974 comedy album by the Firesign Theatre (LP Columbia KC32730) is a pun-filled pastiche featuring the protagonists Hemlock Stones, the &#x27;Great Defective&#x27;, and his biographer and companion, Dr. John Flotsom, O. D. Part of the narrative takes place aboard the &quot;Matilda Briggs&quot; and the name of this ship induces the group to perform the song &quot;Frigate Matilda&quot; (to the tune of &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;), which has become something of a cult standard.
* The 1975 novel &quot;Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s War of the Worlds&quot; is a sequel to H. G. Wells&#x27; science fiction novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, written by Manly Wade Wellman and his son Wade Wellman as a pastiche crossover which combines H. G. Wells&#x27; extraterrestrial invasion story with Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes and Professor Challenger stories. During the course of the narrative, Holmes mentions that Professor Challenger helped solve the case of the giant rat, although the actual name of the case is not stated.
* &quot;The Giant Rat of Sumatra&quot; is a 1976 novel by Rick Boyer which features the return of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; villain Stapleton. In this novel, the &quot;giant rat&quot; turns out to be a vicious Malayan tapir. ()
* In &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot;, a 1977 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV serial set in Victorian London, the hero (dressed in deerstalker and accompanied by a medical doctor with a housekeeper known as Mrs. Hudson) confronts a giant rat in the sewers of London.
* &quot;The Holmes-Dracula File&quot; is a 1978 novel by Fred Saberhagen in which Holmes and Dracula (who turns out to be related to Holmes) uncover a plot to destroy London with plague-bearing rats, the Giant Rat being a living plague vector.
* &quot;All-Consuming Fire&quot; is a 1994 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel by Andy Lane, part of the New Adventures series; in this story, the Doctor joins forces with Holmes and Watson to confront Azathoth, an entity from H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos. The giant rat is portrayed as an alien monster. ()
* &quot;The Giant Rat of Sumatra&quot; is the title of a 1996 short story by Paula Volsky, included in &quot;Eternal Lovecraft: The Persistence of H. P. Lovecraft in Popular Culture&quot;. ()
* &quot;The Giant Rat of Sumatra&quot; is a 1997 title in the Hardy Boys juvenile mystery series, written by Franklin W. Dixon. Frank and Joe Hardy investigate the sabotage of a new musical play based on the Sherlock Holmes story.
* &quot;The Giant Rat of Sumatra&quot; (1998) is the second novel in the &quot;Baker Street Mysteries&quot; juvenile series written by Jake and Luke Thoene.
* &quot;The Shadow of the Rat&quot; is a 1999 novel by David Stuart Davies that deals with the rat, a breed from Sumatra, as part of a biological warfare plot against London, England using the bubonic plague; the &quot;Matilda Briggs&quot; is the ship that brings the rats to London. The story line echoes the plot of Edith Meiser&#x27;s radio play mentioned above. 
* The 2000 - 2001 television drama series &quot;Murder Rooms&quot; (featuring the adventures of a young Arthur Conan Doyle and his mentor) includes an episode wherein a circus manager mentions having featured the &#x27;Giant Rat of Sumatra&#x27; in his freak show. He confesses that the animal was actually a terrier dog with no fur.
* &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Giant Rat of Sumatra&quot; is a 2002 novel by Alan Vanneman. A cousin of Dr. Watson&#x27;s late wife travels to Baker Street from Singapore to consult Sherlock Holmes regarding her husband&#x27;s mysterious suicide; the &#x27;Matilda Briggs&#x27; does not appear in this book. (Carroll &amp; Graf, )
* In &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Giant Rat of Sumatra&quot;, a 2010 novel by Paul D. Gilbert, Holmes investigates the mysterious reappearance of the long-overdue clipper &#x27;Matilda Briggs.&#x27;
* In 2014, the first episode of the third series of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock&quot;, &quot;The Empty Hearse&quot;, features a &quot;giant rat of Sumatra Road&quot;, the code name for a villainous politician, Lord Moran, who is acting as a mole for North Korea and plans to detonate a bomb at an abandoned London Underground station called Sumatra Road.
* A chapter in the 2003 book &quot;The Oriental Casebook Of Sherlock Holmes&quot; by Ted Riccardi relates the story of an Indonesian tribe that worships the still extant giant rat of Sumatra.
* Supernatural giant rats of Sumatra feature heavily in &quot;A Case of Possession&quot; (2017) by KJ Charles, a British writer of historical and paranormal fiction who often includes Sherlockian allusions in her work.

<doc id="1094200" wikidata="Q5199010" url="?curid=1094200" title="Furcula">
<text>The  (Latin for &quot;little fork&quot;; : furculae) or wishbone is a forked bone found in most birds and some species of non-avian dinosaurs, and is formed by the fusion of the two clavicles. In birds, its primary function is in the strengthening of the thoracic skeleton to withstand the rigors of flight.

==In birds==
The furcula works as a strut between a bird&#x27;s shoulders, and articulates to each of the bird&#x27;s scapulae. In conjunction with the coracoid and the scapula, it forms a unique structure called the triosseal canal, which houses a strong tendon that connects the supracoracoideus muscles to the humerus. This system is responsible for lifting the wings during the recovery stroke.

As the thorax is compressed by the flight muscles during downstroke, the upper ends of the furcula spread apart, expanding by as much as 50% of its resting width, and then contracts. X-ray films of starlings in flight have shown that in addition to strengthening the thorax, the furcula acts like a spring in the pectoral girdle during flight. It expands when the wings are pulled downward and snaps back as they are raised. In this action, the furcula is able to store some of the energy generated by contraction in the breast muscles, expanding the shoulders laterally, and then releasing the energy during upstroke as the furcula snaps back to the normal position. This, in turn, draws the shoulders toward the midline of the body. While the starling has a moderately large and strong furcula for a bird of its size, there are many species where the furcula is completely absent, for instance scrubbirds, some toucans and New World barbets, some owls, some parrots, turacos, and mesites. These birds are still fully capable of flying. They also have close relatives where the furcula is vestigial, reduced to a thin strap of ossified ligament, seemingly purposeless. Other species have evolved the furcula in the opposite direction, so that it has increased in size and become too stiff or massive to act as a spring. In strong flyers like cranes and falcons, the arms of the furcula are large, hollow and quite rigid.

In birds, the furcula also may aid in respiration by helping to pump air through the air sacs.

==In other animals==
Several groups of theropod dinosaurs have also been found with furculae, including dromaeosaurids, oviraptorids, tyrannosaurids, troodontids, spinosaurids, coelophysids and allosauroids.

Seeing the occurrence in diplodocid dinosaurs of interclavicles, Tschopp and Mateus (2013) proposed that the furcula is a transformed and divided interclavicle, rather than a fused clavicle.

==In folklore==

Superstitions surrounding divination by means of a goose&#x27;s wishbone go back to at least the Late Medieval Period. Johannes Hartlieb in 1455 recorded the divination of weather by means of a goose&#x27;s wishbone, &quot;When the goose has been eaten on St. Martin&#x27;s Day or Night, the oldest and most sagacious keeps the breast-bone and allowing it to dry until the morning examines it all around, in front, behind and in the middle. Thereby they divine whether the winter will be severe or mild, dry or wet, and are so confident in their prediction that they will wager their goods and chattels on its accuracy.&quot;, and of a military officer: &quot;This valiant man, this Christian Captain drew forth out of his doublet that heretical object of superstition, the goose-bone, and showed me that after Candlemas an exceeding severe frost should occur, and could not fail.&quot; The Captain also said, &quot;Teutonic knights in Prussia waged all their wars by the goose-bone; and as the goose-bone predicted so did they order their two campaigns, one in summer and one in winter.&quot;

The custom of two persons pulling on the bone with the one receiving the larger part making a wish developed in the early 17th century. In some family traditions, the one receiving the smaller part made the wish. At that time, the name of the bone was a &quot;merrythought&quot;. The name &quot;wishbone&quot; in reference to this custom is recorded from 1860.

<doc id="1094203" wikidata="Q77729" url="?curid=1094203" title="Ursula Franklin">
<text>Ursula Martius Franklin (16 September 1921 ‚Äì 22 July 2016) was a Canadian metallurgist, activist, research physicist, author, and educator who taught at the University of Toronto for more than 40 years. Franklin is best known for her writings on the political and social effects of technology. She was the author of &quot;The Real World of Technology&quot;, which is based on her 1989 Massey Lectures; &quot;The Ursula Franklin Reader: Pacifism as a Map&quot;, a collection of her papers, interviews, and talks; and &quot;Ursula Franklin Speaks: Thoughts and Afterthoughts&quot;, containing 22 of her speeches and five interviews between 1986 and 2012. Franklin was a practising Quaker and actively worked on behalf of pacifist and feminist causes. She wrote and spoke extensively about the futility of war and the connection between peace and social justice. Franklin received numerous honours and awards, including the Governor General&#x27;s Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case for promoting the equality of girls and women in Canada and the Pearson Medal of Peace for her work in advancing human rights. In 2012, she was inducted into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame. A Toronto high school, Ursula Franklin Academy, as well as Ursula Franklin Street on the University of Toronto campus, have been named in her honor.

For Franklin, technology was much more than machines, gadgets or electronic transmitters. It was a comprehensive &quot;system&quot; that includes methods, procedures, organization, &quot;and most of all, a mindset&quot;. She distinguished between &quot;holistic&quot; technologies used by craft workers or artisans and &quot;prescriptive&quot; ones associated with a division of labour in large-scale production. Holistic technologies allow artisans to control their own work from start to finish. Prescriptive technologies organize work as a sequence of steps requiring supervision by bosses or managers. Franklin argued that the dominance of prescriptive technologies in modern society discourages critical thinking and promotes &quot;a culture of compliance&quot;.

For some, Franklin belongs in the intellectual tradition of Harold Innis and Jacques Ellul who warn about technology&#x27;s tendency to suppress freedom and endanger civilization. Franklin herself acknowledged her debt to Ellul as well as to several other thinkers including Lewis Mumford, C. B. Macpherson, E. F. Schumacher, and Vandana Shiva. She recognized that this list had few women. In addition to the philosophy of technology, she believed that science was &quot;severely impoverished because women are discouraged from taking part in the exploration of knowledge&quot;.

== Early life ==
Ursula Maria Martius was born in Munich, Germany on 16 September 1921. Her mother Ilse Maria Martius (n√©e Sperling), an art historian, was Jewish, and her father, Albrecht Martius, an ethnographer, came from an old German Protestant family. Franklin once stated that her father was an &quot;Africanist.&quot; Because of the Nazi persecution of the Jews, her parents tried to send their only child to school in Britain when World War II broke out, but the British refused to issue a student visa to anyone under 18. Ursula studied chemistry and physics at Berlin University until she was expelled by the Nazis. Her parents were interned in concentration camps while Franklin herself was sent to a forced labour camp and repaired bombed buildings. The family survived The Holocaust and was reunited in Berlin after the war.

== Academic career ==
Franklin decided to study science because she went to school during a time when the teaching of history was censored. &quot;I remember a real subversive pleasure,&quot; she told an interviewer many years later, &quot;that there was no word of authority that could change either the laws of physics or the conduct of mathematics.&quot; In 1948, Franklin received her PhD in experimental physics at Technische Universit√§t Berlin. She began to look for opportunities to leave Germany after realizing there was no place there for someone fundamentally opposed to militarism and oppression. Franklin moved to Canada after being offered the Lady Davis postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Toronto in 1949. She then worked for 15 years (from 1952 to 1967) as first a research fellow and then as a senior research scientist at the Ontario Research Foundation. In 1967, Franklin became a researcher and associate professor at the Department of Metallurgy and Materials Science, situated in the University of Toronto&#x27;s Faculty of Engineering where she was an expert in metallurgy and materials science. She was promoted to full professor in 1973 and was given the designation of University Professor in 1984, becoming the first female professor to receive the university&#x27;s highest honour. She was appointed professor emerita in 1987, a title she retained until her death. She served as director of the university&#x27;s Museum Studies Program from 1987 to 1989, was named a Fellow of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education in 1988, and a Senior Fellow of Massey College in 1989.

=== Scientific research ===
Franklin was a pioneer in the field of archaeometry, which applies modern materials analysis to archaeology. She worked for example, on the dating of prehistoric bronze, copper and ceramic artifacts. One small example of her work in this field regards what was a standing question on the nature of shiny black Chinese mirrors found in high quantities in ancient tombs. Franklin&#x27;s use of microscopic, etching, electron microprobe and x-ray fluorescence analyses produced evidence that what was thought by some to be a corrosive effect was in fact present in these ancient mirrors (and weapons) at their inception, in dark iron oxides intentionally added near the objects&#x27; surfaces. Franklin additionally pulled from historic and literary accounts of black mirrors in Chinese literature to support these findings. Franklin&#x27;s expertise was also instrumental to dating glass; she guided a study on the remains of blue glass beads in North America remaining from early trade relationships between American Indian tribes and Europe.

In the early 1960s Franklin was one of a number of scientists who participated in the Baby Tooth Survey, a project founded by Eric and Louise Reiss along with other scientists such as Barry Commoner, which investigated levels of strontium-90‚Äîa radioactive isotope in fallout from nuclear weapons testing‚Äîin children&#x27;s teeth. This research contributed to the cessation of atmospheric weapons testing. Franklin published more than a hundred scientific papers and contributions to books on the structure and properties of metals and alloys as well as on the history and social effects of technology.

As a member of the Science Council of Canada during the 1970s, Franklin chaired an influential study on conserving resources and protecting nature. The study&#x27;s 1977 report, &quot;Canada as a Conserver Society&quot;, recommended a wide range of steps aimed at reducing wasteful consumption and the environmental degradation that goes with it. The work on that study helped shape Franklin&#x27;s ideas about the complexities of modern technological society.

== Activism ==
Franklin was also active in the Voice of Women (VOW), now the Canadian Voice of Women for Peace, one of Canada&#x27;s leading social advocacy organizations. In 1968, she and VOW national president Muriel Duckworth presented a brief to a House of Commons committee asserting that Canada and the United States had entered into military trade agreements without adequate public debate. They argued that these commercial arrangements made it difficult for Canada to adopt independent foreign policy positions such as calling for an immediate U.S. military withdrawal from South Vietnam. In 1969, Franklin and Duckworth called on a committee of the Canadian Senate to recommend that Canada discontinue its chemical and biological weapons research and spend money instead on environmental research and preventive medicine. Franklin was also part of a 1969 VOW delegation that urged the federal government to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and establish a special agency to oversee Canadian disarmament.

In the 1980s, Franklin participated in an organized campaign to win the right for conscientious objectors to redirect part of their income taxes from military uses to peaceful purposes. Her 1987 paper, written to support the campaign, argued that the well-recognized right to refuse military service on grounds of conscience should be extended to include the right to refuse to pay taxes for war preparations. Franklin asserted that the freedom of conscience provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaranteed this form of conscientious objection. Her paper was to be part of an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The lower courts had convicted those withholding part of their taxes of violating the Income Tax Act. In 1990 however, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.

Following Franklin&#x27;s retirement, Franklin worked with Phyllis Grosskurth, Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, Cicely Watson, and their lawyer Mary Eberts to file a class action lawsuit against the University of Toronto, claiming it had been unjustly enriched by paying women faculty less than comparably qualified men. In 2002, the lawsuit was settled when the university acknowledged that many of its female professors had suffered from gender barriers and pay discrimination during their careers. As a result, about 60 retired women faculty received a pay equity settlement intended to compensate them for the lower salaries and pensions they had received.

Franklin continued to have a strong association with the University of Toronto&#x27;s Massey College as a continuing senior fellow and senior resident. Her many activities include encouraging young women to pursue careers in science, promoting peace and social justice, and speaking and writing about the social effects of science and technology. Many of her articles and speeches on pacifism, feminism, technology and teaching are collected in &quot;The Ursula Franklin Reader&quot; published in 2006. Franklin is also the author of &quot;The Real World of Technology&quot; which is based on her 1989 Massey Lectures broadcast on CBC Radio.

In a piece of writing entitled &quot;Letter to a Graduate Student&quot;, Franklin encouraged the physics career of a student &quot;Marcia&quot;, who is devoted to feminism yet interested in physics and unsure of how to integrate the two. In the letter Franklin extolls the merits of colleague Maggie Benston, whose contributions to feminist thought and pedagogy, Franklin stated, issued from her integrated way of being and philosophical foundation in science. She cites as an example Benston&#x27;s point that the negative side effects of contraceptive pills are considered tolerable according to present medical practices that are permeated by the patriarchal bias of reductionism. New methodologies are radically needed, she stressed, in concord with Benston&#x27;s writings. Franklin&#x27;s trust in relying on scientific principles to navigate even daily struggles such as an environment &quot;surrounded by jerks&quot; characterizes the letter&#x27;s cheerful closing, in which she recommends &quot;taking field notes&quot; and imagining oneself as an &quot;explorer come upon a strange tribe.&quot; In the letter Franklin mentions as an interested aside the extremely early state of research in solid organic matter, compared to the very well studied condition of solid state physics. She speculates that the neglect of this research area could have a political component, given its benefits to humans rather than to the military.

== Pacifism, feminism and war ==

Ursula Franklin explains in a prelude to her 2006 collection of papers, interviews and talks that her lifelong interest in structures, in what she terms &quot;the arrangement and interplay of the parts within a whole,&quot; has been at the root of most of her activities. Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, &quot;I can see how I have tried to wrestle with just one fundamental question: &#x27;How can one live and work as a pacifist in the here and now and help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise? As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. &quot;Increasingly I found the maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels,&quot; she writes. &quot;I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of &#x27;them&#x27; and &#x27;us,&#x27; of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement.&quot; Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls &quot;the real world&quot; by &quot;the maps of pacifism and feminism&quot;.

For her, feminism meant a completely new point of view: &quot;Feminism isn&#x27;t an employment agency for women; it&#x27;s an alternative way of ordering the social space, in which women are the prototype rather than men. It is based on collaboration rather than competition. As a youngster, I still remember my feeling of joy that one could look at the earth differently. That&#x27;s feminism; everything is differently oriented. Seeing the same world with different eyes.&quot;

=== Pacifism and conscience ===
Central to Franklin&#x27;s pacifism and her view of life is what she calls &quot;the Quaker vision of the world&quot;. Individual conscience is at the heart of that vision. So too, is the need to discern appropriate ways of working for peace in each time and place &quot;rather than relying on a dogma of unvarying rules of conduct&quot;. She notes that for more than 300 years, Quakers have opposed war and violence and have objected to military service and conscription. They have worked on reconciliation, peace research and disarmament and in many countries have won the right for conscientious objectors to perform alternative service instead of taking part in war. Franklin remarks that Quaker principles have not changed, but technology &quot;has&quot; changed the nature of war. In a modern technological society she argues, there is no longer a clear boundary between war and peace. War planning is constant during peacetime and when wars are fought, women and children become targets. Nations no longer depend primarily on conscripting military recruits, but rely on advanced weapons systems that are costly to build or acquire. She writes that the arms race is driven by a &quot;technological imperative&quot; which requires the creation of an enemy as a permanent social institution:

Modern weapons technologies, including the required research and development, are particularly capital-intensive and costly. The time between initial research and the deployment of weapon systems can be as long as a decade, during which the government must provide financial security and political justification for the project. In other words, the state not only provides the funding but also identifies a credible external enemy who warrants such expenditure.

Franklin points out that the technological nature of war requires states to conscript the resources needed to pay for hi-tech devices designed for destruction. Thus, people opposed to war are forced‚Äîthrough taxation‚Äîto pay for war preparations even if it violates their individual conscience.

=== Peace and social justice ===
In her 1987 paper, &quot;Reflections on Theology and Peace&quot;, Ursula Franklin contends that &quot;peace is not the absence of war‚Äîpeace is the absence of fear.&quot; She asserts however, that fear of war and violence is not the only kind of fear that destroys peace. She includes fears arising for example, from economic insecurity, unemployment and the lack of adequate shelter. Franklin points to what she calls &quot;the threat system&quot; which manages people by instilling fear and uncertainty at all levels of society.
For her, social justice is the essential element needed to banish fear and bring peace. Justice means freedom from oppression, but it also implies equality for all. &quot;In God&#x27;s eyes,&quot; she writes, &quot;all creatures have value and are subjects of equal care and love; similarly, in a society of justice and peace, all people matter equally.&quot; Franklin suggests that in consumer-oriented societies, war and violence are the inevitable result of an acquisitive lifestyle that rejects caring and social justice. She quotes historian Lewis Mumford&#x27;s observation that during the rise of capitalism, the sins of greed, gluttony, avarice, envy and luxury became cardinal virtues. Mumford goes on to argue that the &quot;moral change that took place under capitalism can be summed up in the fact that human purposes, human needs, and human limits no longer exercised a directing and restraining influence upon industry: people worked, not to maintain life, but to increase money and power and to minister to the ego that found satisfaction in vast accumulations of money and power.&quot; Franklin extends Mumford&#x27;s argument by pointing to new global realities such as militarized economies dependent on weapons production and national borders increasingly closed to refugees. &quot;Any modern theology of peace,&quot; she writes, &quot;must, I think, take into account the worldwide drift towards &#x27;techno-fascism,&#x27; the anti-people, anti-justice form of global management and power sharing that is developing around the world.&quot;

=== Globalization as warfare ===
Franklin argues that the end of the Cold War brought two main changes. First, the threat of war between the United States and Soviet Union was replaced by regional wars among smaller states. Second, war was transposed to what Franklin calls &quot;another key&quot;‚Äîthe struggle for global commercial and economic dominance. She asserts that this new form of war is now called globalization and its battlefields are global stock and currency markets. This economic warfare defines the enemy as all those who care about the values of community. &quot;Whatever cannot be merely bought and sold,&quot; Franklin writes, &quot;whatever cannot be expressed in terms of money and gain-loss transactions stands in the way of the &#x27;market&#x27; as enemy territory to be occupied, transformed and conquered.&quot; A main strategy in this kind of warfare is the privatization of formerly public domains such as culture, health care, prisons and education to generate private profit. Franklin contends that the new economic warlords or &quot;marketeers&quot; aim, for example, to transform &quot;the ill health or misery of our neighbours into investment opportunities for the next round of capitalism.&quot; She argues that marketeers have become occupying forces served by &quot;puppet governments who run the country for the benefit of the occupiers.&quot; Franklin has also noted that in democratic politics, the economy is all that seems to matter. &quot;Canada has almost no foreign policy,&quot; she says, &quot;but rather is part of an elaborate network of trade agreements.&quot;

Franklin recommends that resistance take the form of refusing to speak the language of the occupiers. This language includes such terms as &quot;stakeholders&quot;, &quot;users&quot;, &quot;health-care providers&quot; and &quot;consumers of education&quot; to refer to teachers and students, doctors, nurses, patients and communities. Franklin also calls for resistance through court challenges and &quot;the creative use of electronic media to bypass the occupation forces&#x27; control of information.&quot; Finally, Franklin is a strong supporter of &quot;citizen politics&quot;, a civic movement which focuses on practical solutions to common problems‚Äîeverything from the absence of peace to homelessness and local traffic congestion. Borrowing a Quaker term, Franklin calls on citizens to engage in &quot;scrupling&quot;, the process of sitting down together to discuss and clarify common moral and political concerns. She writes that citizen politics does not seek to overthrow existing governments but to improve them &quot;whether those in power like it or not.&quot; The movement also tries to defend communities against those intent, in Franklin&#x27;s words, on &quot;turning the globe into one giant commercial resource base, while denying a decent and appropriate habitat to many of the world&#x27;s citizens.&quot;

=== War, failure and 9/11 ===
Again and again in her writings, speeches and interviews, Franklin insists that war and its violence are not only morally wrong, but also ineffective, impractical, and costly. During a radio interview broadcast two days after the September 11 attacks in the U.S., Franklin argued that violence nowadays is always unsuccessful even for the powerful who try to use it. &quot;Nothing has been resolved by violence over the past fifty years,&quot; Franklin said. &quot;The rational thinking that force does not work, even for the enforcer, is staring us in the face.&quot; In a newspaper article published just before the first anniversary of 9/11, Franklin wrote, &quot;It is crucial to recognize that war and war measures are fundamentally dysfunctional instruments of problem-solving. Violence begets more violence, war begets further wars, more enemies and more suffering.&quot;

Franklin suggested that it would have been more effective if, instead of launching a War on Terrorism, the U.S. had interpreted the attacks as a political earthquake instead of an act of war. She argued that social and political structures are as inherently unstable as geological ones. &quot;Geological fissures and human terrorists are created in a context of forces that can be understood and‚Äîat times‚Äîmitigated. Neither can be eliminated by bombing.&quot;

Franklin asserts that militarism is the ultimate development of hierarchical social structures and threat-based systems. &quot;They all work under the implicit assumption that some people matter much less than others, and that all people are of interest only as long as they are needed to support the system or to justify it.&quot; She notes that many prominent advocates for women&#x27;s rights such as Jane Addams and Sylvia Pankhurst were pacifists. &quot;To me, the struggle for women&#x27;s rights and the opposition to militarism in all its forms are two sides of the same coin.&quot;

When a CBC Radio interviewer suggested to Franklin that her ideas about peace and justice were not connected with what was actually happening in the aftermath of 9/11, she readily agreed. &quot;Yes, you are quite right. They are totally unconnected. I have spent the best part of my life trying to put these thoughts into the stream that makes decisions, and I&#x27;ve been spectacularly unsuccessful. That, I think, is a reflection on my ability in the climate of the time, not on the value of the thoughts.&quot;

== Technological society ==
For Franklin, technology is a set of practices in the &quot;here and now&quot; rather than an array of machines or gadgets. It is also a comprehensive &quot;system.&quot; &quot;Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset.&quot; Her definition is similar to the French thinker Jacques Ellul&#x27;s concept of &quot;technique&quot;. Like Ellul, Franklin asserts that technological methods dominate the modern world. &quot;Technology has built the house in which we all live,&quot; she writes, &quot;today there is hardly any human activity that does not occur within this house.&quot; As such, technology is a central element of the here and now. &quot;In the broadest sense of the term, the here and now is our environment, that is, all that is around us‚Äîthe ever-changing overlay of nature, the built environment, the institutional and social structures within which human activities take place, as well as the activities themselves‚Äî&#x27;the way things are done around here. Franklin sees her studies of technology as an attempt to understand how technological practices affect the advancement of justice and peace.

=== Holistic and prescriptive technologies ===
According to Franklin, technology is not a set of neutral tools, methods or practices. She asserts that various categories of technology have markedly different social and political effects. She distinguishes for example, between work-related and control-related technologies. Work-related technologies, such as electric typewriters, are designed to make tasks easier. Computerized word processing makes typing easier still. But when computers are linked into work stations‚Äîpart of a system‚Äîword processing becomes a control-related technology. &quot;Now workers can be timed,&quot; Franklin writes, &quot;assignments can be broken up, and the interaction between the operators can be monitored.&quot;

Franklin extends the distinction between work and control-related technologies to the larger concept of &quot;holistic&quot; and &quot;prescriptive&quot; ones. This enables her to consider the social implications of &quot;how&quot; work is performed. She writes that holistic technologies are usually associated with craft work. &quot;Artisans, be they potters, weavers, metal-smiths, or cooks, control the process of their own work from beginning to finish.&quot; Artisans may specialize in a particular kind of product, but they are always in total control of the process of production and each thing they make or create is unique. Prescriptive technologies, on the other hand, break work down into a series of discrete, standardized steps. &quot;Each step is carried out by a separate worker, or group of workers, who need to be familiar only with the skills of performing that one step.&quot;

Although the division of labour inherent in prescriptive technologies is usually associated with the Industrial Revolution, Franklin points out that such production methods have been used since ancient times. Chinese bronze casting before 1200¬†BC for example, required a tightly controlled and closely supervised production process as well as a strict division of labour. Franklin writes that when she studied Chinese bronze casting as a metallurgist, &quot;the extraordinary social meaning of prescriptive technologies dawned on me. I began to understand what they meant, not just in terms of casting bronze but in terms of discipline and planning, of organization and command.&quot;

=== Technology&#x27;s culture of compliance ===
Franklin argues that in modern society, control-related and prescriptive technologies are dominant. &quot;When work is organized as a sequence of separately executable steps, the control over the work moves to the organizer, the boss or manager,&quot; she writes. &quot;In political terms, prescriptive technologies are &quot;designs for compliance&quot;.&quot; For Franklin, workers accustomed to following prescriptive rules become used to seeing external control and internal compliance as normal and necessary. They also come to believe that there is only one prescribed way of performing a wide variety of tasks. &quot;While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that we live in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept that there is only one way of doing &#x27;it&#x27;.&quot;

Franklin points out that prescriptive technologies have moved beyond materials production to the realms of administration, government and social services. She argues that tasks that require nurturing or caring for people, in health and education, for example, are best done holistically. Yet such tasks are increasingly coming under the sway of prescriptive technologies based on what Franklin calls a production model. Professor Heather Menzies, an admirer of Franklin, describes for example, how nursing tasks are performed in keeping with preset, computerized checklists which leave little discretionary time for dealing with the unexpected or talking with patients who are lonely or distressed. Franklin herself notes that schools and universities test and promote students based on strict production schedules yet &quot;if there ever was a holistic process, a process that cannot be divided into rigid predetermined steps, it is education.&quot;

=== Technology and power ===
Franklin rejects the idea that powerful technologies automatically determine the ways in which people live and work. She maintains that the uses of technology are not preordained, but are the result of conscious choices. The dominant prescriptive technologies establish structures of power and control that follow what Franklin sees as male patterns of hierarchy, authoritarianism, competition and exclusion. Female workers are often victims of these patterns. Mechanical sewing machines were introduced in 1851 with the promise that they would liberate women from household drudgery. But when the machines ended up in factory sweatshops to produce cheap clothing, the new technology was used to exploit female workers. &quot;A strictly prescriptive technology with the classic division of labour arose from the introduction of new, supposedly liberating &#x27;domestic&#x27; machines,&quot; Franklin notes. &quot;In the subsequent evolution of the garment industry, much of the designing, cutting, and assembling began to be automated, often to the complete exclusion of workers.&quot; She points to similar examples in other industries. Female operators helped introduce the telephone only to be replaced by automated switchboards after the technology had been successfully established while secretaries struggled to make the early mechanical typewriters function properly, but ended up performing fragmented and increasingly meaningless tasks.

&quot;Many technological systems, when examined for context and overall design, are basically anti-people,&quot; Franklin writes. &quot;People are seen as sources of problems while technology is seen as a source of solutions.&quot; As a result, people live and work under conditions structured for the well-being of technology even though manufacturers and promoters always present new technologies as liberating. &quot;The dreams of flight, of fast private transportation, of instant communication across continents, and of helpful machines, all stress liberation from hard physical labour at work or drudgery at home.&quot; But once technologies are accepted and standardized, they often enslave or displace their users. Franklin argues that work could be made less prescriptive in workplaces that are less rigidly hierarchical if we adopted more holistic practices based on the way women traditionally work in running households for example, or in caring for children.

=== Communications technologies ===
Franklin asserts that powerful communications technologies have reshaped political and social realities distancing people from each other and their immediate environments. Radio and television for example, transmit messages instantaneously from afar‚Äîmessages that are separated from people&#x27;s experiences in the vicinities where they live and work. Franklin calls such messages &quot;pseudorealities&quot;. She writes they are based on images that are constructed, staged and selected to create emotional effects and the illusion of &quot;being there&quot; as a participant, not just as an observer. She asserts however, that one-way communications technologies reduce or eliminate &quot;reciprocity&quot;, the normal give and take of face-to-face communication.

According to Franklin, the selective fragments or pseudorealities that become news stories are produced to attract and hold people&#x27;s attention by focusing on the unusual over the usual. She acknowledges that no one is forced to watch television or listen to radio; people can explore other channels of communication. But the pseudorealities created by the media are still there &quot;and the world is structured to believe in them.&quot; She argues that images from afar have taken over much of our everyday reality like an immensely powerful occupation force. &quot;And somewhere, someone will have to ask, &#x27;How come the right to change our mental environment‚Äîto change the constructs of our minds and the sounds around us‚Äîseems to have been given away without anybody&#x27;s consent?

=== Silence and the commons ===
&quot;Silence,&quot; Franklin writes, &quot;possesses striking similarities [to] aspects of life and community, such as unpolluted water, air, or soil, that were once taken as normal and given, but have become special and precious in technologically mediated environments.&quot; She argues that the technological ability to separate recorded sound from its source makes the sound as permanent as the Muzak that plays endlessly in public places without anyone&#x27;s consent. For Franklin, such canned music is a manipulative technology programmed to generate predictable emotional responses and to increase private profit. She compares this destruction of silence to the British inclosure acts which fenced off the commons for private farming.

Franklin maintains that the core of the strength of silence is its openness to unplanned events. Quakers, she writes, worship God in collective silence. &quot;I think that if any one of you attended a Quaker meeting, particularly on a regular basis,&quot; she told a 1993 conference on acoustic ecology, &quot;you would find that suddenly, out of the silence, someone will speak about something that had just entered &quot;your&quot; mind. It&#x27;s an uncanny thing, but the strength of collective silence is probably one of the most powerful spiritual forces.&quot; Franklin advocates defending the human right to public silence‚Äînegotiating one music-free elevator for example, or lobbying for quiet rooms in public buildings. She also recommends starting and ending meetings with a few minutes of silence.

== Personal life ==
In 1952, Ursula Franklin married Fred Franklin (1921‚Äì2016), an engineer of German Jewish ancestry who had been exposed to Quakerism while living in England, where he had been sent to boarding school to escape the Nazis in 1936 and remained until emigrating to Canada in 1948. They had no family in Canada and, after their two children were born, they searched for a spiritual home and joined the Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1964. &quot;We were pacifists before we were Quakers,&quot; Franklin says, &quot;but it was a very easy transition to Quakerism for us, and it has been a very good home and an extended family for us and our children.&quot; Franklin spent her last years in a nursing home with Fred, who survived her. She died on 22 July 2016 at the age of 94.

== Donation to Seneca College ==
In April 2013, Franklin donated her extensive collection of writings devoted to Chinese culture and history to the Confucius Institute at Seneca College in Toronto. The collection included more than 220 texts, books, publications, and journals interpreting Chinese culture and history from the perspective of Western scholars. It also contained some of Franklin&#x27;s own working papers and files. The collection is stewarded by Seneca Archives and Special Collections, a service of Seneca Libraries.

== Donation of personal archive to University of Toronto ==
Franklin donated records documenting her personal, professional, and public life to the University of Toronto. The collection includes correspondence with colleagues, family, friends and activists as well as copies of over 575 pages of surveillance of Franklin by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. She donated her collection of feminist and women&#x27;s studies books to the UTM library.

== Awards and honours ==
Franklin received numerous awards and honours during her long career. In 1984, she became the first woman at the University of Toronto to be named &quot;University Professor&quot;, a special title which is the highest honour given by the university. She was named Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981 and a Companion of the Order in 1992. She was appointed to the Order of Ontario in 1990. In 1982, she was given the award of merit for the City of Toronto, mainly for her work in neighbourhood planning. She received an honorary membership in the Delta Kappa Gamma Society International for women educators in 1985. Two years later, she was given the Elsie Gregory McGill memorial award for her contributions to education, science and technology. In 1983, In 1989, she received the Wiegand Award which recognizes Canadians who have made significant contributions to the understanding of the human dimensions of science and technology. In 1991, she received a Governor General&#x27;s Award in Commemoration of the Person&#x27;s Case for advancing the equality of girls and women in Canada. The same year, she received the Sir John William Dawson Medal. She received the 2001 Pearson Medal of Peace for her work in human rights. She has a Toronto high school named after her, Ursula Franklin Academy. In 2004, Franklin was awarded one of Massey College&#x27;s first Adrienne Clarkson Laureateships, honoring outstanding achievement in public service. She was inducted into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame in 2012. She received honorary degrees from more than a dozen Canadian universities including a Doctor of Science from Queen&#x27;s University and a Doctor of Humane Letters from Mount Saint Vincent University, both awarded in 1985.

In March 2020, the Toronto East York Community Council voted unanimously to have Russell Street renamed Ursula Franklin Street.

<doc id="1094210" wikidata="Q2555537" url="?curid=1094210" title="Lacunar amnesia">
<text>Lacunar amnesia is the loss of memory about a specific event. This specific form of amnesia is caused by brain damage in the limbic system which is responsible for our memories and emotions. When the damage occurs it leaves a , or a gap, in the record of memory within the cortex region of the brain. There is a general belief that certain emotions from the lost memory may be triggered without the recollection of the event.

== Characteristics ==
Daniel Goleman, in his book &quot;Vital Lies, Simple Truths&quot;, defines a lacuna as:

&quot;...the sort of mental apparatus that diversionary schemas represent. A lacuna is, then, the attentional mechanism that creates a defensive gap in awareness. Lacunas, in short, create blind spots.&quot;

Lacunar amnesia has also been known to be attributed to alcoholism, drug treatment, and withdrawal in some cases. After using these substances a person may experience a loss of memory of a specific event temporarily or even permanently.

Steven Johnson, (the author of Mind Wide Open: Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life) also states that:

&quot;Scientists believe memories are captured and stored by two separate parts of the brain, the hippocampus, the normal seat of memory, and the amygdala, one of the brain&#x27;s emotional centers. People who, due to hippocampus damage, are incapable of forming long-term memories can still form subconscious memories of traumatic events if their amygdala is intact.&quot;This may be related to erasure or reconsolidation of memories. Attempts have been made to remember memories that have been consolidated and reconsolidate them under desired conditions.

According to Alex Chadwick speaking on NPR: 

This idea of the reconsolidation of memories has also been used in cases of PTSD to lessen or alleviate some of the symptoms associated with the illness.

== Criminal cases ==
This condition is often claimed in the instance of criminal cases. The victim or assailant will insist that they have lost their memory about the event in question, but the remainder of their memory, both anterograde and retrograde, remain intact. There is only one specific memory or recollection of an event that is impaired. This is normally paired or in conjunction with the claim of insanity.

==In popular culture==
This type of amnesia is used as a plot element in movies such as &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; and &quot;Memento&quot;. Both of the amnesiac conditions in these movies represent gaps in the memory instead of long-term or short-term loss. The Caretaker&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Persistent Repetition of Phrases&quot; has the name &quot;Lacunar amnesia&quot; as the title of its opening track.

<doc id="1094211" wikidata="Q4004218" url="?curid=1094211" title="Decoy (TV series)">
<text>Decoy (also titled Policewoman Decoy) is an American crime drama television series created for syndication and initially broadcast from October 14, 1957, to July 7, 1958, with 39 black-and-white 30-minute episodes. The series was the first American police series with a female protagonist. Many &quot;Decoy&quot; episodes are in the public domain.

==Synopsis==
The series featured Beverly Garland as Patricia &quot;Casey&quot; Jones, a female undercover police officer in New York City. The undercover nature of Jones&#x27;s work had her impersonating women in a variety of roles, including gangster&#x27;s molls, prostitutes, nurses, and singers. Jones did not have a partner for her police work, and episodes revealed little about her personal life, with occasional exceptions of references to a love affair with a police officer who died on duty.

Garland&#x27;s Casey Jones was the only regular character in the series, transferring from department to department to work on each case as needed. 
No other character appeared in more than one episode. Frank Campanella played a police lieutenant who oversaw Jones&#x27; case in three episodes, but each of these three lieutenants had different names, and worked in different police divisions.

== Popularity ==
&quot;Decoy&quot; was ranked among the top-10 syndicated programs, not only during its initial release, but also &quot;long after production closed down&quot;.

==Production==
Stuart Rosenberg and Don Medford were directors of &quot;Decoy&quot;, and Steve Gardner was a writer. The show was filmed by Pyramid Productions, partially on location in New York City. Locations included Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, Randalls Island, and the South Bronx. Studio scenes were filmed in the former Biograph Studios in the Bronx.

Production of the show&#x27;s pilot began on March 28, 1957, taking seven days for completion. In August 1957, trade publication &quot;Billboard&quot; reported, &quot;the first-run series is off to one of the fastest sales starts in years, particularly with major station purchases.&quot; That sales success included a $600,000 prerelease order from five Westinghouse-owned TV stations and four independent stations.

Production of the series ended on May 29, 1958, because producers lacked the funds to continue. Reruns were broadcast for seven years using the title &quot;Police Woman&quot;.

<doc id="1094221" wikidata="Q1135700" url="?curid=1094221" title="Tokugawa Tadanaga">
<text>was a Japanese &quot;daimy≈ç&quot; of the early Edo period. The son of the second &quot;sh≈çgun&quot; Tokugawa Hidetada, his elder brother was the third &quot;sh≈çgun&quot; Tokugawa Iemitsu.

== Biography ==
Often called &quot;Suruga Dainagon&quot; (the major counsellor of Suruga), Tadanaga was born in 1606. His birth name was &quot;Kunichiyo&quot; (ÂõΩÂçÉ‰ª£). The date of his birth is uncertain, and is variously given as May 7, June 1, and December 3. Blessed with military and intellectual prowess and a generosity of spirit, he received support from his mother, Oeyo (or S≈´gen&#x27;in), who favored him over her other son Takechiyo (the future Iemitsu) to become the third shogun. Just after the death of their father shogun Hidetada, Iemitsu accused his brother, already under house arrest in K≈çfu, of insanity, stripped him of all possessions and offices, leaving him to commit seppuku. 

It is also said that Tadanaga&#x27;s face was similar to that of his cousin Toyotomi Hideyori and for that reason Ieyasu hated and feared Tadanaga.

He married Masako (1614‚Äì90) later Sh≈çk≈ç-in, the daughter of Oda Nobuyoshi (1584‚Äì1626), who was the grandson of Oda Nobunaga through Oda Nobukatsu.

The Suruga Dainagon Residence was close to &quot;Honmaru&quot; enceinte of Edo Castle to the northwest, and is depicted on the upper right side of the &quot;View of Edo&quot; folding screens from the 17th century.

== Events ==

<text>Bernard Valcourt (born February 18, 1952) is a Canadian politician and lawyer, who served as Member of Parliament for the electoral district of Madawaska‚ÄîRestigouche, New Brunswick until he was defeated in the 2015 federal election.

==Early federal political career and Mulroney cabinet==
Valcourt was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1984 election that brought Brian Mulroney to power. He was appointed to the Cabinet of Canada in 1986 as a Minister of State. In January 1989, he was promoted to Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, but was forced to resign from Cabinet in August when he was involved in a drunk driving motorcycle accident that cost him an eye.

He returned to Cabinet seven months later as Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. In 1991, he was promoted to Minister of Employment and Immigration, and held the position until the government of Mulroney&#x27;s successor as Progressive Conservative Party leader and prime minister, Kim Campbell, was defeated in the 1993 election. Valcourt was defeated in that election, along with every Tory MP in Atlantic Canada except Elsie Wayne.

==Provincial leader==
In May 1995, Valcourt was elected leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick. While he won a seat in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the 1995 provincial election, his party only won six seats against 48 for Frank McKenna&#x27;s Liberals. Valcourt resigned as leader in 1997 following a lukewarm endorsement of his leadership at a party convention, and was succeeded by Bernard Lord.

==Return to federal politics==
On March 28, 2011, Valcourt declared his candidacy in the 2011 federal election, running in the riding of Madawaska‚ÄîRestigouche, which covers the bulk of the territory he&#x27;d represented two decades earlier. He was elected on May 2, 2011, defeating Liberal incumbent Jean-Claude D&#x27;Amours. He was subsequently appointed to cabinet as Minister of State for both the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and La Francophonie.
His sister Martine Coulombe was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the 2010 provincial election. On July 4, 2012, he was given the additional portfolio of Associate Minister of Defence.
Valcourt was part of the AEG initiative, saying co-operation between both the federal and provincial governments, as well as utilities, is key. &quot;The Atlantic Energy Gateway initiative has brought the critical players in the region&#x27;s energy sector together to not only work toward an affordable, secure, clean energy future, but to also maximize the business and job growth potential of further developing our region&#x27;s clean and renewable energy industries,&quot; said Valcourt in a release.

On February 22, 2013, Valcourt became Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development in a cabinet shuffle. Valcourt stirred controversy when he claimed that the high rates of suicide among aboriginal youths were &quot;the responsibility of their parents&quot;.

In the 2015 federal election, Valcourt was defeated by Liberal Ren√© Arseneault, finishing third with just over 16% of the vote.

<doc id="1094239" wikidata="Q5971343" url="?curid=1094239" title="Madhavrao I">
<text>Madhavrao I (Madhavrao Ballal Bhat; 14 February 1745 ‚àí18 November 1772) was the son of Peshwa Balaji Bajirao and grandson of Peshwa Bajirao I who served as 9th Peshwa of the Maratha Empire. During his tenure, the Maratha Empire recovered from losses suffered during the Third Battle of Panipat, an event known as the Maratha Resurrection.

==Early life and ascendancy to Peshwa==

Madhavrao Bhat was the second son of Peshwa Nanasaheb, son of Bajirao. He was born in Savnur on 15 February 1745. At the time of his birth, the Maratha Confederacy stretched across a sizeable portion of Western, Central, and Northern India. On 9 December 1758, Madhavrao married Ramabai in Pune.

Nanasaheb had greatly expanded the Maratha Confederacy and had tried to establish better governance. However, he was held partially responsible for the severe defeat of the Marathas by Ahmad Shah Abdali at the Third Battle of Panipat in early 1761. The Maratha forces suffered heavy losses, including the death of Nanasaheb&#x27;s eldest son. and heir Vishwasrao Bhat, and cousin, Sadashivrao Bhau. He died on 23 June 1761, at Parvati Hill in Pune.
After his father&#x27;s death, the sixteen-year-old Madhavrao was made the next Peshwa of Maratha Confederacy. His paternal uncle, Raghunathrao was to act as regent.

== Early reign and Battle of Uruli ==

At the time of Madhavrao‚Äôs ascendancy, the Maratha Confederacy was in complete disarray, burdened by significant debts following their defeat at Panipat. At Shaniwar Wada, the prime residence of the Peshwa, religious rituals and ceremonies were frequently conducted, while administrative discipline had weakened significantly. When these weaknesses were brought to Madhavrao&#x27;s notice, he introduced changes by personally looking into the administration, accounts, and treasury. He also reduced the religious practices being followed at Shaniwar Wada. In February 1762, Peshwas set out to conquer Karnataka. This was one of the earliest wars against the Nizam (Battle of Uruli). When conflict arose between Madhavrao and his uncle Raghunathrao. Due to a difference of opinion between the two, Raghunathrao decided to abandon the troops midway and return to Pune, while Madhavrao continued. Eventually, a treaty was signed with the Nizam and Madhavrao returned. Both Madhavrao and Raghunathrao had their preferences even over the &quot;Sardars&quot; (Generals). Madhavrao usually preferred the company of Gopalrao Patwardhan, Tryambakrao Mama Pethe, Nana Fadnavis, and Ramshastri Prabhune; while Raghunathrao was dearer to Sakharam Bapu Bokil, Gulabrao and Gangoba Tatya.

==Disputes with Ragunathrao==
On 22 August 1762, Raghunathrao fled to Vadgaon Maval where he started grooming his own army against Madhavrao. Raghunathrao&#x27;s men started looting the nearby villages for warfare and this act angered Madhavrao. He decided to wage a war against his uncle Raghunathrao on 7 November 1762. However, Madhavrao didn&#x27;t wish to battle against his own uncle and thus, proposed for a treaty. 

Raghunathrao agreed to sign the treaty with Madhavrao and asked him to move back to a non-attacking position. Madhavrao did so. However, Raghunathrao deceived Madhavrao. When the Maratha camp under Madhavrao was relaxed and unsuspecting of a battle, they were caught unawares as Raghunathrao attacked treacherously. Thus, Madhavrao was defeated in the Battle of Alegaon and on 12 November 1762, surrendered near Alegaon. 

After the surrender, Raghunathrao decided to control all the major decisions under the assistance of Sakharam Bapu. He also decided to befriend the Nizam, but this proved to be a wrong move as the Nizam slowly started infiltrating the zones of the Maratha Confederacy. As time slipped by, Madhavrao pointed out the gravity of the situation to his uncle. Eventually, on 7 March 1763, the Peshwas, once again under Madhavrao&#x27;s leadership, decided to attack Aurangabad to crush the Nizam. 

After months of chasing, the Peshwas faced the Nizam&#x27;s army on 10 August 1763, in the Battle of Rakshasbhuvan near Aurangabad. the Nizam&#x27;s army suffered huge losses in this war, and Nizam retreated.

==War against Hyder Ali and Mysore==
In January 1764, for the second time, Madhavrao gathered his defenses and conquered Hyder Ali. This time his massive army included efficient generals like Gopalrao Patwardhan, Murarrao Ghorpade, Vinchurkar and Naro Shankar. Raghunathrao declined his offer to join him and instead chose to visit Nashik. This was a particularly long conquest in areas of former Sira Subah which went for almost a year in Karnataka. 

However, Hyder Ali somehow managed to escape the clutches of the Peshwas. In November 1764, the major Dharwar Fort came into the charge of young Peshwa with the assistance of Gopal Rao and Anand Rao. Only Bankapur was left under the control of Haider Ali. Again Madhavrao defeated Hyder ali on many occasions on such occasion of Battle of Jadi Hanwati and Battle of Rattihalli which eventually gives Hyder Ali many casualties. 

Eventually, Madhavrao decided to call Raghunathrao for his assistance, but Raghunathrao only signed a treaty with Hyder Ali, much to Madhavrao&#x27;s disappointment. Raghunathrao intentionally made this move, since he was now fearfully aware of Madhavrao&#x27;s burgeoning power. The power of the Young Peshwa Madhav Rao could be seen from a letter which Raghunath Rao wrote to Gopika Bai in 1765 which was as follows. &quot; He has become very wise. He is managing everything and doing more than Nana Saheb Peshwa and Bhau Saheb ever did.&quot; 

Additionally, his loyal assistant Sakharam Bapu also warned him against the consequences of conquering Hyder Ali. The Peshwa&#x27;s failure to impose his authority over Hyder Ali triggered a major setback on Madhavrao&#x27;s health. In 1767, Madhavrao I organized a 2nd expedition against Hyder Ali. Supported by the defection Hyder Ali&#x27;s brother, he inflicted defeats on Hyder Ali in the battles of Sira and Madhugiri and made a surprise discovery of Queen Virammaji, the last ruler of the Keladi Nayaka Kingdom and her son who were kept in confinement in the fort of Madhugiri by Hyder Ali. They were rescued by Madhavrao I and were sent to Pune for protection. Sira subah was absorbed into Maratha confederacy. who retained it until Haidar&#x27;s son, Tipu Sultan, recaptured it in 1774.

==Alliance with Nizam==

The Peshwas were expanding their territory in the northern regions of India. Raghunathrao, Holkars and Shindes together marched towards Delhi with the intention of expanding the Maratha Confederacy in these territories. Meanwhile, Madhavrao made a bold decision of bonding with his old rival, Nizam Ali Khan, Asaf Jah II. 

The Nizam also genuinely expressed his desire to do so, and thus the two met at Kurumkhed on 5 February 1766. The next few days saw some cultural exchanges and open expressions of concern. A level of mutual understanding was reached and this relationship started growing stronger.

== Relations with the East India Company ==
On 3 December 1767, an East India Company officer named Mastin arrived in Pune. Mastin wanted to establish a military presence in the regions of Vasai and Sashthi, but was confronted by Madhavrao who was suspicious of his intentions. Mastin&#x27;s repeated requests to acquire these regions in return for defeating Hyder Ali fell on deaf ears, and Madhavrao never agreed to them.

==Raghunathrao faces house arrest==

Though Raghunathrao had marched to the north to expand the empire, he failed to do so. Instead, he came back to Anandvalli and was again tempted to form an alliance with his generals and fight against Madhavrao. This time, however; Madhavrao was extremely agitated with his uncle&#x27;s repeated attempts to overthrow him. On 10 June 1768, he waged a war against Raghunathrao, captured him, and put him under house arrest at Shaniwar Wada along with his assistant Sakharam Bapu Bokil.

==Assassination attempt==

The incident occurred on the evening of 7 September 1769. Madhavrao was returning from the Parvati temple at Pune with his comrades, when one of his generals, Ramsingh, suddenly attacked him with a sword. Madhavrao was warned just in the nick of time, and he suffered a blow from the sword on his shoulder as he tried to dodge Ramsingh. Madhavrao believed that this was Raguhnathrao&#x27;s attempt to murder him, but he imprisoned General Ramsingh.

==Northern campaign==
In 1769, Madhavrao sent a large army under the command of Ramchandra Ganesh Kanade and Visaji Krushna Biniwale in order to recover territory lost in the North due to the defeat of the Third battle of Panipat they were joined by Mahadji Shinde and Tukoji Rao Holkar. This Maratha army marched towards Udaipur. The Rajputs there agreed to pay him 60 lakhs as tribute. On 5 April 1770, the Marathas defeated Jats of Bharatpur. 

In October 1770 they vanquished Najib Khan Rohilla, the main opponent of the Battle of Panipat (1761).
In November 1771, Visaji Krushna Biniwale was appointed ‚ÄòIn Charge of the Northern Front of Marathas‚Äô by Peshwa Madhavrao I. In February 1772, along with Mahadji Shinde, he overpowered the Rohillas of Rohillkhand at Shukratal by defeating Zabita Khan. They avenged the defeat of Panipat by breaking the tomb of Najib Khan, by looting the artillery and wealth of the Rohillas, and by recovering from them an additional tribute of Rs.40 lakhs. Mahadji Shinde made his mark as a Maratha general while serving with Biniwale in North India. 

During his northern campaign, Biniwale persuaded the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam to return to Delhi and reclaim his throne in 1771. Peshwa Madhavrao I was so delighted with Visaji Krushna&#x27;s grand victory in the Rohilkhand that he specifically mentioned in his written will to shower golden flowers on him during his arrival at the border of Pune.

The Capture of Delhi was a battle in 1771 when the forces of the Maratha Confederacy led by Mahadaji Shinde captured Delhi along with the Red Fort, and gave Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II the throne back with the treaty. The Marathas captured Delhi from Najib Khan&#x27;s son Zabita Khan who was put in charge by the Afghans. With this capture, Marathas regained their lost supremacy in North India after the Third Battle of Panipat and conquered much of the lost territories which they lost after the Third Battle of Panipat.

Shah Alam spent six years in the Allahabad fort and after the capture of Delhi in 1771 by the Marathas, left for his capital under their protection. He was escorted to Delhi by Mahadaji Shinde and left Allahabad in May 1771. During their short stay, the Marathas constructed two temples in Allahabad city, one of them being the famous Alopi Devi Mandir. 

After reaching Delhi in January 1772 and realising the Maratha intent of territorial encroachment however, Shah Alam ordered his general Najaf Khan to drive them out. In retaliation, Tukoji Rao Holkar and Visaji Krushna Biniwale attacked Delhi and defeated Mughal forces in 1772. The Marathas were granted an imperial &quot;sanad&quot; for Kora and Allahabad. They turned their attention to Oudh to gain these two territories. Shuja was however, unwilling to give them up and made appeals to the English and the Marathas did not fare well at the Battle of Ramghat. The Maratha and British armies fought in Ram Ghat, but the sudden demise of the Peshwa and the civil war in Pune to choose the next Peshwa forced the Maratha army to retreat.

==Death==

In June 1770, the Peshwas set out to conquer Hyder Ali for the third time. However, Madhavrao was infected with tuberculosis, and his health started deteriorating. Tuberculosis was also termed as &quot;Raj-Yakshma&quot; or the &quot;prince of diseases&quot;. 

Madhavrao had to return from Miraj as the effects of the disease had started becoming prominent. He was even recommended an English doctor for treatment of the terrible disease, and he would follow the advice given by the doctor. However, there were no signs of improvement and slowly it started developing further. The disease had affected his intestine. There was no cure for tuberculosis in those times. Madhavrao decided to spend his last days in his favourite Ganesha Chintamani Temple, Theur. According to Grant Duff &quot;The third battle of Panipat was not that much fatal to the Maratha empire than the early death of Peshwa Madhav Rao in 1772. &quot;

On 6 October 1772, Raghunathrao tried to escape from the house arrest at Shaniwar Wada, but he was caught again. Madhavrao had become excessively weak, and he could no longer bear such incidents. He had constructed a garden, a wooden hall and a fountain outside this favourite temple.

18 November 1772, early morning approximately at eight: Madhavrao died at the temple premises of Chintamani, Theur. Thousands of citizens visited the site and paid their last respects. Madhavrao was cremated on the banks of the river which was about half a mile from the temple. A small memorial carved out of stone rests today at that place as a memorial.

His wife Ramabai chose to commit sati with his body at the time of cremation.

==Character and Legacy==

Madhavrao was regarded well by many of his subjects, owing to his perceived openness, and shrewdness of decisions. Assessing the impact of the loss of Madhavrao, the writer James Grant Duff eulogised:

And the plains of Panipat were not more fatal to the Maratha Confederacy than the early end of this excellent prince‚Ä¶

<doc id="1094245" wikidata="Q115293" url="?curid=1094245" title="A New Kind of Army">
<text>A New Kind of Army is a punk rock studio album originally released by Anti-Flag on May 25, 1999. It was reissued by A-F Records on October 19, 2004, and is also the only album to feature only Justin Sane as lead vocalist. All other albums featured at least one song sung by either Andy Flag or Chris #2.

== Background ==
After the band released Die For the Government in 1996, Andy Flag left due to personal issues with Justin and Pat (they would later reconcile). After that, Sean Whelan of Pittsburgh band the Bad Genes filled in on bass. It was during this time that Sean was also playing in another band (57 Defective) with guitarist Chris Head, whom he introduced to the band. He then joined the band in early 1997 to play bass. Later that year, Jamie &quot;Cock&quot; Towns joined as the new bass player, allowing Chris to move to rhythm guitar (which he preferred). Justin said that he wrote nearly 30 songs during this period.

In 1998, Towns told the band that she wanted to leave the band. The band, looking for a new player, ran into a fan named Chris Barker who told them he could play. The band let him in, and he took the name Chris #2 (sometimes simply called #2).

By the time Chris #2 had joined, the album had already been mostly written and recorded. The band had spent time recording in various houses in Pittsburgh, including Justin&#x27;s parents&#x27; house. When he joined, the band reconvened at the house so he could record his bass for the songs. Recording was finished in January 1999, while Chris was still in high school. Justin remarked that there was more pressure on writing the songs than on the previous album due to Andy&#x27;s departure, and him having to write all the lyrics.

== Music ==
Nearly all of the songs were written by Justin alone. As a result, this is the only album that features only him as the primary singer. While primarily a punk record, the album also features elements of Ska, Folk, and Melodic Hardcore. The lyrics cover a wide variety of topics including abortion, corruption, police brutality, racism, fascism, and unity within the American Youth. Tearing Everyone Down and Captain Anarchy continue the themes from Die for the Government of criticizing the &quot;fake jock punks&quot; who were ruining the scene at the time. The band would later point to Tearing Everyone Down as the track that would pave the way for their future songs, including &quot;I&#x27;d Tell You But...&quot; and &quot;The Criminals&quot;. During a live show, Chris #2 joked that Justin was the only one who liked playing Captain Anarchy live, as he and Chris Head &quot;hated the song&quot;, and Pat &quot;hated playing any Anti-Flag songs&quot;. The title track was written by Justin as one of the last songs for the album. He explained that he was having a difficult time coming up with concept for the record, then came up with the song on a walk, returned home, and wrote the song in 30 minutes. The song was inspired by President Clinton ordering the bombing of Iraq in order to distract the nation from the Monica Lewinsky Scandal. That&#x27;s Youth describes the band&#x27;s experience growing up in Pittsburgh with their friends.

Got the Numbers is one of the heavier songs on the album, and features pounding drums from Pat and fast-paced bass playing by Chris 2. It remains one of the band&#x27;s more popular songs, even though Chris 2 said Pat didn&#x27;t like the song either. Even though Justin is the only singer on the track, Chris 2 usually sings the chorus when they perform it live. No Difference is a slower track that describes freedom of being at a punk show with fellow friends. I Don&#x27;t Believe is similar to songs from Die for the Government in that it questions the wave of nationalism throughout the country as a result of the Gulf War. Right On is credited to the entire band and mocks people who have insulted the band in various cities.

What You Don&#x27;t Know questions the secret nature politicians engage in that results in US laws and policy, presumably without input from the American people. Free Nation? attacks the Christian Right and the Republican Party for claiming to uphold &quot;christian values&quot; while pursuing policies that attack non-whites. Chris 2 said that he had difficulty recording this song because the band didn&#x27;t have a click track, so he had to manually count himself in to start the song on time. He later called it one of his favorite Anti-Flag songs. Outbreak references the Lewinsky Scandal and the bombing of Iraq, similarly to the title track and asks &quot;Who is the real terrorist?&quot;. An early version of the song appeared on the A-F Records cassette This Is East Coast Punk, and featured a spoken intro by Sane. Police Story describes the Death of Jonny Gammage by the police in 1995, claiming &quot;We&#x27;ve got no rights when cops can kill&quot;. The song remains one of the band&#x27;s most request songs to play live, but Chris 2 said that they don&#x27;t play it because they never found a way to make it work live.

Consumer Song was one of the last songs included on the album, along with New Kind of Army. It&#x27;s a mournful, slow song featuring Justin playing guitar by himself, similar to folk-punk artist Billy Bragg. He had written the song at the end of the sessions, and the band were unable to record a full version of it. They decided to include the solo version on the record in order to show off their appreciation of Bragg. The song addresses the flaws of capitalism, and calls for people to watch where they spend their money, as their buying habits &quot;support abuse in the third world scene&quot;. This Is Not A Crass Song features 3 minutes of silence at the end of the song before featuring audio of the band jamming in the studio.

== Recording ==
The band recorded the album in a similar manner that they did with Die For the Government, renting equipment from local stores to use. Joe West, who had helped produce and engineer the previous album, returned to help them record again. Some of the songs featured guests, including former bass player Jamie &quot;Cock&quot; Towns, Azi Masladahan, Hoss, Mike Poyzle, Reagan Squad, Jim Weber, and Neil Linn.

== Packaging ==
The album features a drawing by Justin&#x27;s sister, Lucy, that parodies the famous flag image at Iwo Jima during World War II for the cover. Underneath, the band wrote &quot;Anti-Flag does not mean Anti-American. Anti-Flag means anti-war. Anti-Flag means unity.&quot; The booklet also featured a prayer from Mark Twain, and a fold out poster with the phrase &quot;Too smart to fight. Too smart to kill. Join now. A new kind of army.&quot;

In the album&#x27;s liner notes, the lyrics spelt women as &quot;womyn&quot;. The band wrote that this was &quot;not a misspelling, but a result of feminist conscious&quot;. The band would continue to do this for every album that contained the word.

== Release ==
The album was released jointly on Go-Kart Records and A-F Records. Greg Ross, the label owner, was friends with Pat and offered to sign the band to release the album. They later revealed that the album was originally scheduled for an April release date, but it got pushed back to May because the CD wasn&#x27;t ready.

The band had wanted to release the album on Fat Wreck Chords, but Fat Mike didn&#x27;t want to, as he felt the band were too different from the other acts. He offered to release it on Honest Don&#x27;s Records, the subsidiary for Fat, but the band declined, viewing it as a &quot;second-tier label&quot;. When they met on Warped Tour in 2000, Mike told them he was so impressed by them saying no that he offered to sign them to Fat for their next album. They would release their next 2 albums on the label.

In 2004, the band rereleased the album on A-F Records due to the rights reverting to them. The rerelease included new artwork.

The band later said that this was the first Anti-Flag album to sell more than 100,000 copies.

== Legacy ==
Both Police Story and The Consumer Song would later be rerecorded for the band&#x27;s 20 Years of Hell Series. The Consumer Song received a full band recording for the first time.

Tearing Everyone Down, A New Kind of Army, and Free Nation? would all be featured on the band&#x27;s album Mobilize as live recordings. In addition, Tearing Everyone Down and Got The Numbers would be featured on the live albums Live Vol 1 and Live Vol 2, respectively.

Justin would later go on to call A New Kind of Army his least favorite Anti-Flag album.

<text>, , or : 1573 ‚Äì September 15, 1626) was a noblewoman in Japan&#x27;s Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period and early Edo period. She was a daughter of Oichi and the sister of Yodo-dono and Ohatsu. When she rose to higher political status during the Tokugawa shogunate, she took the title of &quot;≈åmidaidokoro&quot;. Following the fall of the Council of Five Elders, Oeyo and her sisters were key figures in maintaining a diplomatic relationship between the two most powerful clans of their time, Toyotomi and Tokugawa. Due to her great contributions to politics at the beginning of the Edo period she was posthumously inducted into the Junior First Rank of the Imperial Court, the second highest honor that could be conferred by the Emperor of Japan.

Oeyo married three times, first to Saji Kazunari, her cousin, then to Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s nephew, Toyotomi Hidekatsu. She had a daughter with Hidekatsu named Toyotomi Sadako later married Kuj≈ç Yukiie. Her third and last husband Tokugawa Hidetada became the second Tokugawa &quot;sh≈çgun&quot;. She was also the mother of his successor Iemitsu, the third &quot;sh≈çgun&quot;. She had Senhime, Tamahime, Katsuhime, Hatsuhime, Takechiyo (Iemitsu), and Tadanaga. Hatsuhime was adopted by Oeyo&#x27;s sister Ohatsu, who is married to Ky≈çgoku Takatsugu.

Surviving record books from merchants of luxury goods provide insight into patterns of patronage and taste amongst the privileged class of women like Oeyo and her sisters.

==Genealogy==
Oeyo, also known as Og≈ç, was the third and youngest daughter of the Sengoku-period &quot;daimy≈ç&quot; Azai Nagamasa. Her mother, Oichi was the younger sister of Oda Nobunaga. Toyotomi Hideyoshi became the adoptive father and protector of Oeyo in the period before her marriage.

Oeyo&#x27;s oldest sister, styled Yodo-dono, Cha-Cha in birth name, was a prominent concubine of Hideyoshi who gave birth to his heir, Toyotomi Hideyori.

Oeyo&#x27;s middle sister, Ohatsu was the wife of Ky≈çgoku Takatsugu and the mother of Ky≈çgoku Tadataka.

== Name ==
Oeyo also known as Sugoin-in, was initially engaged to Saji Kazunari but was later separated from him by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. She subsequently married her adoptive nephew, Toyotomi Hidekatsu, and bore a daughter named Sadatako. Tragically, Hidekatsu died suddenly. For her third marriage, she wed Tokugawa Hidetada, who would become the second shogun of the Tokugawa Shogunate. She had two sons and five daughters, including a daughter named Takako.

Regarding her name, &quot;Sugoin-in&quot; was part of her posthumous title. There has been debate over its pronunciation. The authoritative &quot;Kokushi Daijiten&quot; suggests it should be pronounced as &quot;S≈´gen&#x27;in,&quot; with the character &quot;Â¥á&quot; read as &quot;s≈´.&quot; However, a document believed to be authored by Kasuga no Tsubone in the possession of Ryoan-ji Temple in Kyoto uses the reading &quot;S≈çgen&#x27;in-sama.&quot; Additionally, a provisional edition of &quot;Kansei Shoka Keizu Den&quot; also reads &quot;Â¥áÊ∫êÈô¢ÊÆø&quot; as &quot;S≈çgen&#x27;in den.&quot; These sources suggest that she may have been referred to as &quot;S≈çgen&#x27;in&quot; during her time.

Her childhood name (commonly used name) was &quot;Kogou&quot; based on the oldest record found in &quot;Taik≈ç Sosei Ki.&quot; However, different historical sources have assigned the characters &quot;Ê±ü&quot; or &quot;ÈÉ∑&quot; to her name. The change from the character &quot;Áù£&quot; to &quot;Ê±ü&quot; may have been due to her marriage to Tokugawa Hidetada, who was known as &quot;Edo-chunagon&quot; at the time.

In pre-modern Japan, most women retained their childhood names throughout their lives and did not have formal given names. However, in the upper classes, women were sometimes given given names to be used in official documents, especially when receiving titles or honors. In the case of Sugoin-in, a formal given name &quot;Michiko&quot; was bestowed posthumously, as recorded in the &quot;Ch≈´in Ts≈´mura Nikki&quot; from 1626.

In the case of noblewomen, they were often given honorary titles in addition to their childhood and given names. These titles could change based on their residence or status. Sugoin-in had several titles throughout her life, including &quot;Kitano Kata,&quot; &quot;Oshinzo,&quot; &quot;Go-Shinzo,&quot; and &quot;O-Go-Shinzo,&quot; each reflecting her changing circumstances and roles.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and marriage to Saji Kazunari ===
Sugoin-in was born in Odani, Omi Province (present-day Nagahama, Shiga Prefecture), as the third daughter of Asai Nagamasa, a powerful regional daimyo. Her mother was Oichi no Kata, the daughter of Oda Nobuhide and sister of Oda Nobunaga.

The exact year of her birth is a subject of debate, with some sources suggesting 1570, based on her age at death, while others propose 1573. The latter is considered more likely, with some scholars estimating her birth month to be August.

In September 1573, Odani Castle, her family&#x27;s stronghold, was attacked and taken by Oda Nobunaga, leading to the downfall of the Asai clan. Sugoin-in, along with her mother Oichi and sisters, was rescued by Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s forces. After her father&#x27;s suicide, she was placed under the care of Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s brother-in-law, Oda Nobutada.

In June 1582, following the death of Oda Nobunaga in the Incident at Honno-ji, Sugoin-in, her mother, and her sisters were transferred to the care of Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s uncle, Oda Nobutaka. They resided in Gifu Castle but were soon separated as her mother married Shibata Katsuie, one of Nobunaga&#x27;s loyal retainers.

=== Marriage to Toyotomi Hidekatsu ===
Sugoin-in&#x27;s first marriage took place under the patronage of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. She married her adoptive nephew, Toyotomi Hidekatsu, the lord of Tanba Province. The exact timing of this marriage is uncertain, but it is believed to have occurred in 1584. This marriage served to strengthen ties between the Oda and Toyotomi clans.

However, this union was short-lived due to Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s ambitions and conflicts within the Toyotomi clan. After the Siege of Shizugatake in 1583, Hideyoshi ordered the dissolution of their marriage, resulting in Sugoin-in&#x27;s separation from Hidekatsu.

=== Second marriage to Toyotomi Hidekatsu ===
After the dissolution of her first marriage, Sugoin-in found herself in a precarious position. During this period, Japan was in a state of turmoil, with various warlords vying for power. She eventually remarried, this time to her adoptive nephew, Toyotomi Hidekatsu, the nephew and adopted son of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The exact date of their marriage remains uncertain, but it likely occurred in the late 1580s or early 1590s.

Hidekatsu was a loyal supporter of Hideyoshi and served as the lord of various domains. Despite their significant age difference, Sugoin-in and Hidekatsu married, and they had a daughter named Sadatako. Hidekatsu died soon after.

=== Third marriage to Tokugawa Hidetada ===
Sugoin-in&#x27;s life took another dramatic turn. On September 17, 1595, she remarried in Fushimi, becoming the wife of Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s heir, Tokugawa Hidetada. Hidetada, who had come to Kyoto in 1590 during the 18th year of the Tensho era, had been engaged to Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s daughter, Oda Go, who was also a ward of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. However, their wedding plans were never realized due to Go&#x27;s untimely death. Hidetada and she went on to have seven children, with their eldest daughter, Senhime, born in 1597.

In 1600, during the 5th year of the Keicho era, Toyotomi Hideyoshi expanded the hall of Sennyu-ji Temple and built a shrine dedicated to Oda Nobunaga on the former site of Azuchi Castle. Subsequently, after Hideyoshi&#x27;s death, she instructed Niwa Nagashige to rebuild the shrine in the ashes of Azuchi Castle.

During the Siege of Osaka in 1614-1615, the Toyotomi clan was defeated, and she lost her sister Yodo-dono. On May 7, 1617, she mourned for Yodo-dono and Toyotomi Hideyori at Yogen-in Temple. When Yogen-in, the temple founded by Yodo-dono in memory of their father, Azai Nagamasa, was destroyed by fire in 1619, she petitioned the Tokugawa shogunate to rebuild it. Her request was granted, and the temple was reconstructed in 1621.

== Death and legacy ==
She died on September 15, 1626, at Edo Castle&#x27;s Nishinomaru (Western Bailey) at the age of 54. Her posthumous Buddhist name was &quot;Sugeden-in Donsho Wako Ninsei Shojotei Ni.&quot;

Following her death, she was buried at Zojo-ji Temple in Tokyo&#x27;s Minato Ward, at the same site as her husband Tokugawa Hidetada and other Tokugawa shogunate members.

There are also memorial pagodas dedicated to her at Kinkai-koji Temple in Kyoto&#x27;s Sakyo Ward and Kongobu-ji Temple in Koya-cho, Wakayama Prefecture. These pagodas bear inscriptions recognizing her as &quot;Sugeden-in Donsho Wako Ninsei.&quot; Another memorial pagoda is located inside the Rokkakudo Pagoda at Konkai Komyo-ji Temple in Kyoto, with the inscription &quot;Sugeden-in Gen Donsho Taishi.&quot;

In summary, her life was marked by her marriages to prominent figures of the time, her involvement in the reconstruction of religious sites, and her contributions to the Tokugawa family. Her legacy is commemorated in several memorial pagodas across Japan.

==Honours==
*Junior First Rank (November 28, 1626; posthumous)

==Taiga drama==
NHK&#x27;s 2011 Taiga drama, &quot;G≈ç: Himetachi no Sengoku&quot;, is based on the life of Oeyo who is played by the actress Juri Ueno.

==Notable descendants==
Together with Odai no Kata (Ieyasu&#x27;s mother) and Lady Saigo (mother of Hidetada), Oeyo was the matriarch who stabilized the Tokugawa shogunate. Her descendants became shoguns, aristocrats and other prominent political figures. It is speculated that her son, Iemitsu, was the last direct male descendant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, thus ending the patrilineality of the shogunate for the third generation.

<text>John Barrie Crump (15 May 1935 ‚Äì 3 July 1996) was a New Zealand author of semi-autobiographical comic novels based on his image as a rugged outdoors man. Taken together his novels have sold more than a million copies domestically. Crump&#x27;s 1986 work &quot;Wild Pork and Watercress&quot; was adapted into the 2016 Taika Waititi film &quot;Hunt for the Wilderpeople&quot;.

==Biography==

Born in Papatoetoe, Auckland, Crump was the second of six children. His parents were share-milkers who worked in the Taupaki area, and his father was regularly violent towards his wife and children.

Crump worked for many years as a government deer-culler in areas of New Zealand native forest (termed &quot;the bush&quot;). He wrote his first novel, &quot;A Good Keen Man&quot;, in 1960, based on his experiences as a government hunter. It was a fictional account of a young hunter who has to suffer through a series of hunting partners who are often unsuitable for the job. This novel became one of the most popular in New Zealand history, and Crump&#x27;s success continued with &quot;Hang on a Minute Mate&quot; (1961), &quot;One of Us&quot; (1962), &quot;There and Back&quot; (1963), &quot;Gulf&quot; (1964), &quot;A Good Keen Girl&quot; (1970), &quot;Bastards I Have Met&quot; (1971), and others, which capitalized on the appeal of his good-natured itinerant self-sufficient characters and an idiomatic &quot;blokey&quot; writing style that he developed after his first book.

In 1969, five children drowned after driving a [Land rover]car into Lake Matahina at a camp that Crump helped to run. Crump was charged with manslaughter over the deaths, but these charges were dropped. Fleur Adcock, one of Crump&#x27;s ex-wives, said that it was negligence on his behalf that the children died, (despite Crump not being present at the camp at the time of the accident).

Crump travelled throughout Australia (where he hunted crocodiles for two years), Europe, Turkey, and India, the result of which was his conversion to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith by 1982. In 1988 Crump nearly died from accidentally inhaling cyanide when trapping possums. Towards the end of his life his literary style changed as he wrote children&#x27;s stories featuring characters he created; vis the Pungapeople.

Crump was also well known for appearing in a series of acclaimed New Zealand television advertisements for Toyota&#x27;s four-wheel drive Hilux utes, which relied on his image as a stalwart &quot;bushman&quot;. The ads aired between 1982 and 1995. He played an archetypal Kiwi bloke in the 1964 New Zealand film &quot;Runaway&quot;.

Crump&#x27;s song, &quot;Side By Side&quot;, featuring his &quot;sidekick&quot; Scotty (broadcaster Lloyd Scott), was used as the theme song for Team New Zealand in the America&#x27;s Cup. Crump was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal in 1990, and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1994 New Year Honours, for services to literature and the community.

Crump was featured on a New Zealand $1.00 postage stamp in 1995 as part of the &quot;Famous New Zealanders&quot; issue.

== Personal life and death ==
He married five times. His wives were (1) Martina (Tina) Anso (1957‚Äì60), (2) poet Fleur Adcock (1962), (3) Vanda Hill (1969‚Äì79), (4) Robin Hughes (later known as Robin Lee-Robinson (1979‚Äì91), and (5) Margaret (Maggie) Nicholson (1993‚Äì96). Additionally he had relationships with Jean Watson (writer) (1962‚Äì69), and photographer Ans Westra (c. 1964-5). His children with these women were Ivan (b. 1958), &amp; Martin (b. 1959) (Anso), Stephen (b. 1960), &amp; Harry (b. 1965) (Watson), Lyall (b. 1970) (Hill), and Erik (b. 1965) (Westra). Crump died in 1996 of a suspected aortic aneurysm. At the time of his death he was living at Ohauiti with his wife Maggie. One of his sons, Martin Crump, is now a well-known radio broadcaster.

Posthumously, Crump was accused by ex-wife Fleur Adcock of regularly engaging in violence against herself and his subsequent wives, describing him as a &quot;sadist.&quot; In 2016, Crump&#x27;s fourth wife, Robin Lee-Robinson, claimed that she was the one who had come up with the plot outline for Crump&#x27;s novel &quot;Wild Pork and Watercress&quot;, because Crump &quot;wasn&#x27;t getting on with writing the book&quot; after having thought of the basic premise for it. Lee-Robinson made the allegation several days after the New Zealand premiere of the book&#x27;s film adaptation, &quot;Hunt for the Wilderpeople&quot;; she stated that she was disappointed &quot;not to be mentioned at all&quot; in the film&#x27;s credits. She had not previously mentioned any claim of part-authorship while Crump was alive and has not claimed to have actually written any part of the novel itself. Crump&#x27;s son, Martin, said that Crump often borrowed ideas from people, but denied this instance until Lee-Robinson could provide proof.

<doc id="1094274" wikidata="Q131092" url="?curid=1094274" title="Coelurosauria">
<text>Coelurosauria (; from Greek, meaning &quot;hollow-tailed lizards&quot;) is the clade containing all theropod dinosaurs more closely related to birds than to carnosaurs.

Coelurosauria is a subgroup of theropod dinosaurs that includes compsognathids, tyrannosaurs, ornithomimosaurs, and maniraptorans; Maniraptora includes birds, the only known dinosaur group alive today.

Most feathered dinosaurs discovered so far have been coelurosaurs. Philip J. Currie had considered it likely and probable that all coelurosaurs were feathered. However, several skin impressions found for some members of this group show pebbly, scaly skin, indicating that feathers did not completely replace scales in all taxa. In the past, Coelurosauria was used to refer to all small theropods, but this classification has since been amended.

==Anatomy==

===Bodyplan===
The studying of anatomical traits in coelurosaurs indicates that the last common ancestor had evolved the ability to eat and digest plant matter, adapting to an omnivorous diet, an ability that could be a major contributor to the clade&#x27;s success. Later groups would hold on to the omnivory, while others specialized in various directions, becoming insectivorous (Alvarezsauridae), herbivorous (Therizinosauridae) and carnivorous (Tyrannosauroidea and Dromaeosauridae). The group includes some of the largest (&quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;) and smallest (&quot;Microraptor&quot;, &quot;Parvicursor&quot;) carnivorous dinosaurs ever discovered. Characteristics that distinguish coelurosaurs include:
* a sacrum (series of vertebrae that attach to the hips) longer than in other dinosaurs
* a tail stiffened towards the tip
* a bowed ulna (lower arm bone).
* a tibia (lower leg bone) that is longer than the femur (upper leg bone)

===Integument===

Fossil evidence shows that the skin of even the most primitive coelurosaurs was covered primarily in feathers. Fossil traces of feathers, though rare, have been found in members of most major coelurosaurian lineages. Most coelurosaurs also retained scales and scutes on some portion of their bodies, particularly the feet, though some primitive coelurosaurian species are known to have had scales on the upper legs and portions of the tail as well. These include tyrannosauroids, &quot;Juravenator&quot;, and &quot;Scansoriopteryx&quot;. Fossils of at least some of these animals (&quot;Scansoriopteryx&quot; and possibly &quot;Juravenator&quot;) also preserve feathers elsewhere on the body.

Though once thought to be a feature exclusive to coelurosaurs, feathers or feather-like structures are also known in some ornithischian dinosaurs (like &quot;Tianyulong&quot; &quot;and Kulindadromeus&quot;), and in pterosaurs. Though it is unknown whether these are related to true feathers, recent analysis has suggested that the feather-like integument found in ornithischians may have evolved independently of coelurosaurs but this was estimated by assuming that primitive pterosaurs had scales. In 2018, two anurognathid specimens were found to have integumentary structures similar to protofeathers. Based on phylogenetic analysis, protofeathers would have had a common origin with avemetatarsalians.

===Nervous system and senses===
Although rare, complete casts of theropod endocrania are known from fossils. Theropod endocrania can also be reconstructed from preserved braincases without damaging valuable specimens by using a computed tomography scan and 3D reconstruction software. These finds are of evolutionary significance because they help document the emergence of the neurology of modern birds from that of earlier reptiles. An increase in the proportion of the brain occupied by the cerebrum seems to have occurred with the advent of the Coelurosauria and &quot;continued throughout the evolution of maniraptorans and early birds.&quot;

==Fossil evidence and age==
A few fossil traces tentatively associated with the Coelurosauria date as far back as the late Triassic. What has been found between then and the earliest Middle Jurassic is fragmentary. The oldest known unambiguous members of Coelurosauria are the proceratosaurid tyrannosauroids &quot;Proceratosaurus&quot; and &quot;Kileskus&quot; from the late Middle Jurassic. Many nearly complete fossil coelurosaurians are known from the Late Jurassic. &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; (incl. &quot;Wellnhoferia&quot;) is known from Bavaria at 155-150¬†Ma. &quot;Ornitholestes&quot;, the troodontid &quot;Hesperornithoides&quot;, &quot;Coelurus fragilis&quot; and &quot;Tanycolagreus topwilsoni&quot; are all known from the Morrison Formation in Wyoming at about 150 Ma. &quot;Epidendrosaurus&quot; and &quot;Pedopenna&quot; are known from the Daohugou Beds in China at about 165-163¬†Ma. The wide range of fossils in the late Jurassic and morphological evidence shows that coelurosaurian differentiation was virtually complete before the end of the Jurassic.

In the early Cretaceous, a superb range of coelurosaurian fossils (including avians) are known from the Yixian Formation in Liaoning. All known theropod dinosaurs from the Yixian Formation are coelurosaurs. Many of the coelurosaurian lineages survived to the end of the Cretaceous period (about 66¬†Ma) and fossils of some lineages, such as the Tyrannosauroidea, are best known from the late Cretaceous. A majority of coelurosaur groups became extinct in the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, including the Tyrannosauroidea, Ornithomimosauria, Oviraptorosauria, Deinonychosauria, Enantiornithes, and Hesperornithes. Only the Neornithes, otherwise known as modern birds, survived, and continued to diversify after the extinction of the other dinosaurs into the numerous forms found today.

There is consensus among paleontologists that birds are descended from coelurosaurs. Under modern cladistical definitions, birds are considered the only living lineage of coelurosaurs. Birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora.

A portion of a tail belonging to a juvenile coelurosaur was found in 2015, inside of a piece of amber.

==Classification==
The phylogeny and taxonomy of Coelurosauria has been subject to intensive research and revision. For many years, Coelurosauria was a &#x27;dumping ground&#x27; for all small theropods. In the 1960s several distinctive lineages of coelurosaurs were recognized, and a number of new infraorders were erected, including the Ornithomimosauria, Deinonychosauria, and Oviraptorosauria. During the 1980s and 1990s, paleontologists began to give Coelurosauria a formal definition, usually as all animals closer to birds than to &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, or equivalent specifiers. Under this modern definition, many small theropods are not classified as coelurosaurs at all and some large theropods, such as the tyrannosaurids, were actually more advanced than allosaurs and therefore were reclassified as giant coelurosaurs. Even more drastically, the segnosaurs, once not even regarded as theropods, have turned out to be non-carnivorous coelurosaurs related to &quot;Therizinosaurus&quot;. Senter (2007) listed 59 different published phylogenies since 1984. Those since 2005 have followed almost the same pattern, and differ significantly from many older phylogenies.

In 1994, a study by paleontologist Thomas Holtz found a close relationship between the Ornithomimosauria and Troodontidae, and named this group Bullatosauria. Holtz rejected this hypothesis in 1999, and most paleontologists now consider troodontids to be much more closely related to either birds or Dromaeosauridae than they are to ornithomimosaurs, causing the Bullatosauria to be abandoned. The name referred to the inflated (bulbous) sphenoid both groups shared. Holtz defined the group as the clade containing the most recent common ancestor of &quot;Troodon&quot; and &quot;Ornithomimus&quot; and all its descendants. The concept is now considered redundant, and the clade Bullatosauria is now viewed as synonymous with Maniraptoriformes. In 2002, Gregory S. Paul named an apomorphy-based clade Avepectora, defined to include all theropods with a bird-like arrangement of the pectoral bones, where the angled shoulder girdle (coracoids) come in contact with the breastbone (sternum). According to Paul, ornithomimosaurs are the most basal members of this group. In 2010, Paul used Avepectora for a smaller clade, excluding ornithomimosaurs, compsognathids and alvarezsauroids.

Within Coelurosauria exists a slightly less inclusive clade named Tyrannoraptora. This clade was defined by Sereno (1999) as &quot;&quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, &quot;Passer domesticus&quot; (the house sparrow), their last common ancestor, and all of its descendants&quot;. As tyrannosauroids are considered to be the most basal large group within Coelurosauria, this means that the common ancestor of tyrannosauroids and birds was an even more basal coelurosaurian. As a result, almost all coelurosaurians are also tyrannoraptorans, with the only exceptions being particularly basal species such as &quot;Zuolong salleei or Sciurumimus albersdoerferi&quot;.

Several recently-named clades have been proposed to define the structure of Coelurosauria crownward of basal groups such as tyrannosauroids and compsognathids. Maniraptoromorpha, defined by Andrea Cau in 2018, includes all coelurosaurians more closely related to birds than to tyrannosauroids. Cau stated that the synapomorphies of the clade included &quot;Keel or carinae in the postaxial cervical centra, absence of hyposphene-hypantra in caudal vertebrae (reversal to the plesiomorphic theropodan condition), a prominent dorsomedial process on the semilunate carpal, a convex ventral margin of the pubic foot, a subrectangular distal end of tibia and a sulcus along the posterior margin of the proximal end of fibula.&quot; Another proposed clade is Neocoelurosauria, erected by Hendrickx, Mateus, Ara√∫jo and Choiniere (2019), They define it as &quot;the clade Compsognathidae + Maniraptoriformes&quot;, which can be more or less inclusive than Maniraptoromorpha depending on the topology.

The last, and most exclusive of these proposed subclades is Maniraptoriformes. Maniraptoriformes is a clade which may have been united by the presence of pennaceous feathers and wings. This clade contains ornithomimosaurs and maniraptorans. The group was named by Thomas Holtz, who defined it as &quot;the most recent common ancestor of &quot;Ornithomimus&quot; and birds, and all descendants of that common ancestor.&quot; One of the possible synapomorphies of this clade is the presence of feathers homologous to those of birds, based on study of a specimen of &quot;Shuvuuia&quot;.

The following family tree illustrates a synthesis of the relationships of the major coelurosaurian groups based on various studies conducted in the 2010s.

<text>The Schwinn Bicycle Company is an American company that develops, manufactures and markets bicycles under the eponymous brand name.
The company was founded by Ignaz Schwinn (1860‚Äì1948) in Chicago in 1895, and in the 20th century became the dominant manufacturer of American bicycles. 

Schwinn first declared bankruptcy in 1992 and was restructured, in 2001 Schwinn again declared bankruptcy and was purchased by Pacific Cycle, now owned by the Dutch conglomerate, Pon Holdings.

==History==
===Founding of Schwinn===
Ignaz Schwinn was born in Hardheim, Baden, Germany, in 1860 and worked on two-wheeled ancestors of the modern bicycle that appeared in 19th century Europe. Schwinn emigrated to the United States in 1891. In 1895, with the financial backing of fellow German American Adolph Frederick William Arnold (a meat packer), he founded Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Company. Schwinn&#x27;s new company coincided with a sudden bicycle craze in America. Chicago became the center of the American bicycle industry, with thirty factories turning out thousands of bikes every day. Bicycle output in the United States grew to over a million units per year by the turn of the 20th century.

The boom in bicycle sales was short-lived, saturating the market years before motor vehicles were common on American streets. By 1905, bicycle annual sales had fallen to only 25% of that reached in 1900. Many smaller companies were absorbed by larger firms or went bankrupt; in Chicago, only twelve bicycle makers remained in business. Competition became intense, both for parts suppliers and for contracts from the major department stores, which retailed the majority of bicycles produced in those days. Realizing he needed to grow the company, Ignaz Schwinn purchased several smaller bicycle firms, building a modern factory on Chicago&#x27;s west side to mass-produce bicycles at lower cost. He finalized a purchase of motorcycle manufacturer Excelsior Company in 1912, and in 1917 added the Henderson Company to form Excelsior-Henderson. In an atmosphere of general decline elsewhere in the industry, Schwinn&#x27;s new motorcycle division thrived, and by 1928 was in third place behind Indian and Harley-Davidson.

===Depression years===

At the close of the 1920s, the stock market crash decimated the American motorcycle industry, taking Excelsior-Henderson with it. Arnold, Schwinn, &amp; Co. (as it remained until 1967) was on the verge of bankruptcy. With no buyers, Excelsior-Henderson motorcycles were discontinued in 1931. Ignaz&#x27;s son, Frank W. &quot;F. W.&quot; Schwinn, took over day-to-day operations at Schwinn. Putting all company efforts towards bicycles, he succeeded in developing a low-cost model that brought Schwinn recognition as an innovative company, as well as a product that would continue to sell during the inevitable downturns in business cycles. After traveling to Europe to get ideas, F. W. Schwinn returned to Chicago and in 1933 introduced the Schwinn B-10E Motorbike, actually a youth&#x27;s bicycle designed to imitate a motorcycle. The company revised the model the next year and renamed it the &quot;Aerocycle&quot;. For the &quot;Aerocycle&quot;, F. W. Schwinn persuaded American Rubber Co. to make balloon tires, while adding streamlined fenders, an imitation &quot;gas tank&quot;, a streamlined, chrome-plated headlight, and a push-button bicycle bell. The bicycle would eventually come to be known as a &quot;paperboy bike&quot; or &quot;cruiser&quot;.

Schwinn was soon sponsoring a bicycle racing team headed by Emil Wastyn, who designed the team bikes, and the company competed in six-day racing across the United States with riders such as Jerry Rodman and Russell Allen. In 1938, Frank W. Schwinn officially introduced the &quot;Paramount&quot; series. Developed from experiences gained in racing, Schwinn established &quot;Paramount&quot; as their answer to high-end, professional competition bicycles. The &quot;Paramount&quot; used high-strength chrome-molybdenum steel alloy tubing and expensive brass lug-brazed construction. During the next twenty years, most of the &quot;Paramount&quot; bikes would be built in limited numbers at a small frame shop headed by Wastyn, in spite of Schwinn&#x27;s continued efforts to bring all frame production into the factory.

On 17 May 1941, Alfred Letourneur was able to beat the motor-paced world speed record on a bicycle, reaching on a Schwinn Paramount bicycle riding behind a car in Bakersfield, California.

===Industry dominance===
By 1950, Schwinn had decided the time was right to grow the brand. At the time, most bicycle manufacturers in the United States sold in bulk to department stores, which in turn sold them as store brand models. Schwinn decided to try something different. With the exception of B. F. Goodrich bicycles, sold in tire stores, Schwinn eliminated the practice of producing private label bicycles in 1950, insisting that the Schwinn brand and guarantee appear on all products. In exchange for ensuring the presence of the Schwinn name, distributors retained the right to distribute Schwinn bikes to any hardware store, toy store, or bicycle shop that ordered them. In 1952, F. W. Schwinn tasked a new team to plan future business strategy, consisting of marketing supervisor Ray Burch, general manager Bill Stoeffhaas, and design supervisor Al Fritz.

In the 1950s, Schwinn began to aggressively cultivate bicycle retailers, persuading them to sell Schwinns as their predominant, if not exclusive brand. During this period, bicycle sales enjoyed relatively slow growth, with the bulk of sales going to youth models. In 1900, during the height of the first bicycle boom, annual United States sales by all bicycle manufacturers had briefly topped one million. By 1960, annual sales had reached just 4.4 million. Nevertheless, Schwinn&#x27;s share of the market was increasing, and would reach in excess of 1 million bicycles per year by the end of the decade.

In 1946, imports of foreign-made bicycles had increased tenfold over the previous year, to 46,840 bicycles; of that total, 95 per cent were from Great Britain. The postwar appearance of imported &quot;English racers&quot; (actually three-speed &quot;sport&quot; roadsters from Great Britain and West Germany) found a ready market among United States buyers seeking bicycles for exercise and recreation in the suburbs. Though substantially heavier than later European-style &quot;racer&quot; or sport/touring bikes, Americans found them a revelation, as they were still much lighter than existing models produced by Schwinn and other American bicycle manufacturers. Imports of foreign-made &quot;English racers&quot;, sports roadsters, and recreational bicycles steadily increased through the early 1950s. Schwinn first responded to the new challenge by producing its own &quot;middleweight&quot; version of the &quot;English racer&quot;. The middleweight incorporated most of the features of the English racer, but had wider tires and wheels.

The company also joined with other United States bicycle manufacturers in a campaign to raise import tariffs across the board on all imported bicycles. In August 1955, the Eisenhower administration implemented a 22.5% tariff rate for three out of four categories of bicycles. However, the most popular adult category, lightweight or &quot;racer&quot; bicycles, were only raised to 11.25%. The administration noted that the United States industry offered no direct competition in this category, and that lightweight bikes competed only indirectly with balloon-tire or cruiser bicycles. The share of the United States market taken by foreign-made bicycles dropped to 28.5% of the market, and remained under 30% through 1964. Despite the increased tariff, the only structural change in foreign imports during this period was a temporary decline in bicycles imported from Great Britain in favor of lower-priced models from the Netherlands and Germany. In 1961, after a successful appeal by bicycle importers, the Eisenhower tariffs were declared invalid by the Court of United States Customs Appeals, and President Kennedy imposed a new tariff rate at 50% on foreign-made bicycles, a rate which remained in place until 1964.

While every large bicycle manufacturer sponsored or participated in bicycle racing competition of some sort to keep up with the newest trends in technology, Schwinn had restricted its racing activities to events inside the United States, where Schwinn bicycles predominated. As a result, Schwinns became increasingly dated in both styling and technology. By 1957, the &quot;Paramount&quot; series, once a premier racing bicycle, had atrophied from a lack of attention and modernization. Aside from some new frame lug designs, the designs, methods and tooling were the same as had been used in the 1930s. After a crash-course in new frame-building techniques and derailleur technology, Schwinn introduced an updated &quot;Paramount&quot; with Reynolds 531 double-butted tubing, Nervex lugsets and bottom bracket shells, as well as Campagnolo derailleur dropouts. The &quot;Paramount&quot; continued as a limited production model, built in small numbers in a small apportioned area of the old Chicago assembly factory. The new frame and component technology incorporated in the &quot;Paramount&quot; largely failed to reach Schwinn&#x27;s mass-market bicycle lines. In 1963 following the death of F. W. Schwinn, grandson Frank Valentine Schwinn took over management of the company.

===Marketing and antitrust issues===
By the late 1950s, Schwinn&#x27;s exclusive marketing practices were well entrenched in the United States, practices that had ensured a dominant position in the United States bicycle market. In order to prevent competition among its wholesalers, Schwinn assisted them by dividing up the national market. Schwinn also strengthened its dealer network, shrinking the number of authorized dealers. Since Schwinn could decide who got their bikes and who didn&#x27;t, the company rewarded the highest volume dealers with location exclusivity, as well as mandating service standards and layouts. In response, the company was sued by the Department of Justice in 1957 for restraint of trade. In a ten-year legal battle, many of Schwinn&#x27;s practices were upheld by the courts: judges ruled they had the right to have their bicycles sold by retailers equipped to service the bikes as well as sell them. However, in a ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1967, &quot;U.S. v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.&quot;, Schwinn was found guilty of restraint of trade by preventing distributors shipping bicycles to unapproved dealers. Though the &quot;Arnold&quot; decision would be essentially overturned in later rulings, the company stopped working solely through independent local distributors and constructed four regional warehouses from which bicycles would¬†‚Äî legally¬†‚Äî be sent to shops. While this solved the problem of unfair trade practice with the courts, the new warehouses and distribution system cost millions of dollars at a time of rising competition from foreign manufacturers.

=== Child and youth markets ===
During the 1960s, Schwinn aggressively campaigned to retain and expand its dominance of the child and youth bicycle markets. The company advertised heavily on television, and was an early sponsor (from 1958) of the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;. The Captain himself was enlisted to regularly hawk Schwinn-brand bicycles to the show&#x27;s audience, typically six years old and under. As these children matured, it was believed they would ask for Schwinn bicycles from their parents. By 1971, United States government councils had objected to Schwinn&#x27;s marketing practices. In response, Schwinn had &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; alter its format. The Captain no longer insisted that viewers buy a Schwinn, but instead made regular on-air consultations of a new character, &quot;Mr. Schwinn Dealer&quot;.

=== The Corvette ===

Schwinn developed the Corvette in 1954, after their catalog, for that year, had been in use. Therefore, with the release of a single photograph, the Corvette was introduced. The picture showed company executives standing behind their new product, that would remain in production for 10 years. 1955 was the first year in which the Corvette appeared in the Schwinn catalog; it was Schwinn&#x27;s top listing in their &quot;middleweight&quot; category.

=== Schwinn Tandems ===

From Schwinn&#x27;s earliest years in the 1890s to the 1980s, Schwinn produced a series of tandem bicycles. From 1946 to 1963, the tandem frames were hand brazed with seamless chromoly tubing and featured a short wheelbase with a curved rear seat tube, heavy duty tandem components, and an eccentric front bottom bracket for chain adjustment. In 1959, the tandems were given the model name Town &amp; Country. In 1963, the electro-welded Schwinn Twinn tandem was introduced at a retail price of $99.95, with the Town &amp; Country at $175. The Town &amp; Country disappeared from the catalog in 1964. The Twinn was eventually offered in three different models: the single speed Twinn, a two speed semi-automatic, and the five speed Deluxe Twinn. The Twinn used a straight rear seat tube and an idler sprocket to adjust the timing chain tension, typically found on low-priced tandems. In 1969, the Paramount tandem was introduced, returning to fillet-brazed, seamless chromoly tubing and an eccentric front bottom bracket chain adjustment system. It kept some of the heavy duty features of the discontinued Town &amp; Country model but lengthened the wheelbase and fitted with lightweight components including TA (later Campagnolo) aluminum cranksets, aluminum 27&quot; rims on Campagnolo hubs with heavy, 12-gauge spokes, Brooks leather saddles, Cinelli handlebars and stem, and Campagnolo pedals. 1969 retail price was $397 for both the double-diamond and rear step-through frame designs, each in two different frame sizes in the customer&#x27;s choice of color. The Paramount tandems were sold alongside the Twinn until 1979, when the retail price of the Paramount had risen to $1,395. In 1975, Schwinn re-introduced the curved rear seat tube on the Paramount models, calling it a &quot;short coupled&quot; design. The Twinn series continued through 1982. From 1989 through 1992, Schwinn offered a tandem called the Duo Sport, which used a lugged frame built with oversized tubing in Japan and equipped with quality, mid-range components. Like the Paramount tandems, the Duo Sport was offered in two different frame sizes.

=== The Sting-Ray ===

In 1962, Schwinn&#x27;s designer Al Fritz heard about a new youth trend centered in California for retrofitting bicycles with the accoutrements of motorcycles customized in the &quot;bobber&quot; or &quot;chopper&quot; style, including high-rise, &quot;ape-hanger&quot; handlebars, and low-rider &quot;banana seats&quot;. Inspired, he designed a mass-production bike for the youth market known as &quot;Project J-38&quot;. The result, a wheelie bike, was introduced to the public as the Schwinn &quot;Sting-Ray&quot; in June 1963.

The Sting-Ray had ape-hanger handlebars, Persons&#x27;s Solo Polo Seat banana seat, and tires. Sales were initially slow, as many parents desiring a bicycle for their children did not relate to the new, unconventional design. After a few appeared on America&#x27;s streets and neighborhoods, many young riders would accept nothing else, and sales took off.

In the December 1963 Schwinn Reporter, Schwinn announced the arrival of the Deluxe Sting-Ray. This model included Fenders, white-wall tires, and a padded Solo polo seat.

In July 1964, Schwinn announced the arrival of the Super Deluxe Sting-Ray. This model included a front spring-fork, a new sleeker Sting-Ray banana seat, and a Person&#x27;s Hi-loop Sissy bar. The Super Deluxe also gave the rider a choice of White wall tires or the new Yellow oval rear Slik tire paired with a front black wall Westwind tire.

By 1965, a host of American and foreign manufacturers were offering their own version of the &quot;Sting-Ray&quot;.

===The &quot;Ten Speed&quot;===
A growing number of US teens and young adults were purchasing imported European sport racing or sport touring bicycles, many fitted with multiple derailleur-shifted gears. Schwinn decided to meet the challenge by developing two lines of sport or road &#x27;racer&#x27; bicycles. One was already in the catalog¬†‚Äî the limited production &quot;Paramount&quot; series. As always, the &quot;Paramount&quot; spared no expense; the bicycles were given high-quality lightweight lugged steel frames using double-butted tubes of Reynolds 531 and fitted with quality European components including Campagnolo derailleurs, hubs, and gears. The Paramount series had limited production numbers, making vintage examples quite rare today. Starting in 1960, for the rest of the market, Schwinn offered the Schwinn &quot;Varsity,&quot; &quot;Continental&quot;, and &quot;LeTour&quot; -- now equipped as multi-geared sport bikes (&quot;10-speeds&quot;), and designed to imitate the style of the new narrow-tired &#x27;racing&#x27; and sport bikes from Europe, though not their performance. The 1960 Varsity was introduced as an 8-speed bike, but in mid-1961 was upgraded to 10 speeds. Other road bikes were introduced by Schwinn in the early and mid 1960s, such as the Superior, Sierra, and Super Continental, but these were only produced for a few years. The Varsity and Continental sold in large numbers through the 1960s and early 1970s, becoming Scwhinn&#x27;s leading models. The major difference between the two models was the use of a tubular front fork on the Continental -- both bikes used the same frame design, a lugless, steel unit, using Schwinn&#x27;s standard Ashtabula cranksets and welded in such a way that the joints were smoothly filled (similar to the joints in 21st-century composite frames). The wheel rims were likewise robust, chromed, stamped steel with a unique profile designed to hold the tire bead securely, even if pressure were low or lost.

In the late 1960s, the Varsity and Continental pioneered the use of auxiliary brake levers, which allowed the rider to rest hands on the straight, horizontal center section of the ram&#x27;s horn handlebars, yet still have braking control. To further improve control from this more-erect riding position, the levers used to move the derailleurs (shifting the chain from one sprocket to the next) were moved from the traditional position on the &quot;down tube&quot; to the top of the headset, on a ring which would turn with the handlebar stem. This feature, attractive to older riders, soon found its way to other Schwinn models, especially those intended for senior citizens. 

By the mid-1970s, competition from lightweight and feature-rich imported bikes was making strong inroads in the budget-priced and beginners&#x27; market. While Schwinn&#x27;s popular lines were far more durable than the budget bikes, they were also far heavier and more expensive, and parents were realizing that most of the budget bikes would outlast most kids&#x27; interest in bicycling. Although the Varsity and Continental series would still be produced in large numbers into the 1980s, even Schwinn recognized the growing market in young adults and environmentally-oriented purchasers, devoting the bulk of their marketing to lighter models intended to pull sales back from the imports.

===The bicycle boom===


The &quot;Sting-Ray&quot; sales boom of the 1960s accelerated in 1970, with United States bicycle sales doubling over a period of two years. However, there were clear warning signs on the horizon.

Despite a huge increase in popularity of lightweight European sport or &quot;road racing bicycles&quot; in the United States, Schwinn adhered to its existing strategy in the lightweight adult road bike market. For those unable to afford the &quot;Paramount&quot;, this meant a Schwinn &#x27;sports&#x27; bike with a heavy steel electro-forged frame along with steel components such as wheels, stems, cranks, and handlebars from the company&#x27;s established United States suppliers. Though weighing slightly less, the mid-priced Schwinn &quot;Superior&quot; or &quot;Sports Tourer&quot; was almost indistinguishable from Schwinn&#x27;s other heavy, mass-produced models, such as the &quot;Varsity&quot; and &quot;Continental&quot;. While competitive in the 1960s, by 1972 these bicycles were much heavier and less responsive in comparison to the new sport and racing bicycles arriving from England, France, Italy, and increasingly, Japan.

Another problem was Schwinn&#x27;s failure to design and market its bicycles to specific, identifiable buyers, especially the growing number of cyclists interested in road racing or touring. Instead, most Schwinn derailleur bikes were marketed to the general leisure market, equipped with heavy &quot;old timer&quot; accessories such as kickstands that cycling aficionados had long since abandoned. More and more cyclists, especially younger buyers, began to insist on stronger steel alloys (which allowed for lighter frames), responsive frame geometry, aluminum components, advanced derailleur shifting, and multiple gears. When they failed to find what they wanted at Schwinn, they went elsewhere. While the &quot;Paramount&quot; still sold in limited numbers to this market, the model&#x27;s customer base began to age, changing from primarily bike racers to older, wealthier riders looking for the ultimate bicycle. Schwinn sold an impressive 1.5 million bicycles in 1974, but would pay the price for failing to keep up with new developments in bicycle technology and buying trends.

With their aging product line, Schwinn failed to dominate the huge sport bike boom of 1971‚Äì1975, which saw millions of &quot;10-speed&quot; bicycles sold to new cyclists. Schwinn did allow some dealers to sell imported road racing bikes, and by 1973 was using the Schwinn name on the &quot;Le Tour&quot;, a Japanese-made low-cost sport/touring 10-speed bicycle. Schwinn developed strong trading relationships with two Japanese bicycle manufacturers in particular, Bridgestone and (via its bicycling arm) Panasonic. Though these met initial dealer resistance as &quot;imports&quot; and were not included in the Schwinn consumer catalog, it was soon realized that the Panasonic and Bridgestone &#x27;Schwinn&#x27; bicycles were fully the equal of the American-made versions in quality and performance. Schwinn soon had a range of low, mid- and upper-level bicycles all imported from Japan. Schwinn&#x27;s standard road bike model from Panasonic was the &quot;World Traveler&quot;, which had a high-quality lugged steel frame and Shimano components. Schwinn also marketed a top-shelf touring model from Panasonic, the &quot;World Voyager&quot;, lugged with butted Tange chrome-molybdenum alloy tubing, Shimano derailleurs, and SunTour bar-end shifters, a serious challenge to the Paramount series at half the price.

By 1975, bicycle customers interested in medium-priced road and touring bicycles had largely gravitated towards Japanese or European brands. Unlike Schwinn, many of these brands were perennial participants in professional bicycle racing, and their production road bicycles at least possessed the cachet and visual lineage of their racing heritage, if not always their componentry. One example was Peugeot, which won several Tour de France victories using race bikes with frames occasionally constructed by small race-oriented framebuilders such as Masi, suitably repainted in Team Peugeot colors. In reality, mass-market French manufacturers such as Peugeot were not infrequently criticized for material and assembly quality¬†‚Äî as well as stagnant technology¬†‚Äî in their low- and mid-level product lines. Nevertheless, Peugeot proudly advertised its victorious racing heritage at every opportunity. While not as prominent at the winner&#x27;s podium, Japanese brands such as Fuji and Panasonic offered consistently high quality, reasonable prices, and state-of-the-art-derailleur, crankset, and gearing design. Unlike Schwinn, most Japanese bicycle manufacturers were quick to adopt the latest European road racing geometries, new steel alloys, and modern manufacturing techniques. As a result, their moderately-priced bicycles, equipped with the same Japanese-made components, usually weighed less and performed better than competitive models made by Schwinn. Schwinn brand loyalty began to suffer as huge numbers of buyers came to retailers asking for the latest sport and racing road bikes from European or Japanese manufacturers. By 1979, even the &quot;Paramount&quot; had been passed, technologically speaking, by a new generation of American as well as foreign custom bicycle manufacturers.

===BMX bicycles===

Schwinn also largely failed to capitalize on a new trend in Southern California: BMX racing. After first claiming it to be a dangerous sport, management changed their tune¬†‚Äî too late¬†‚Äî when they introduced the &quot;Scrambler&quot; in 1975, which evolved into a BMX design in the late 1970s, but it was heavier than designs from other manufacturers. The Sting-Ray based Scrambler spawned the light weight, fully competition capable, chrome-molybdenum-tubed &quot;Competition Scrambler&quot; in late 1976, &quot;Scrambler 36/36&quot;, the &quot;Mag Scrambler&quot; in 1977, and &quot;The Sting&quot; in 1979, with full Reynolds, double butted chrome-molybdenum frame that was made in the same assembly area as the Paramount road racing frames.

Schwinn followed the Scrambler line with the &quot;Predator&quot; in 1982, their next step into the competitive modern BMX market. The Predator took just eight percent of the BMX market. Schwinn had a very successful BMX factory supported racing team (beginning in 1976) made up of some of the best riders of the day. They were even used for an episode of the TV show CHiPs.

===Mountain bikes===
By the late 1970s, a new bicycle sport begun by enthusiasts in Northern California had grown into a new type of all-terrain bicycle, the mountain bike. Mountain bikes were originally based on Schwinn balloon-tired cruiser bicycles fitted with derailleur gears and called &quot;Klunkers&quot;. A few participants began designing and building small numbers of mountain bikes with frames made out of modern butted chrome-molybdenum alloy steel. When the sport&#x27;s original inventors demonstrated their new frame design, Schwinn marketing personnel initially discounted the growing popularity of the mountain bike, concluding that it would become a short-lived fad. The company briefly (1978‚Äì1979) produced a bicycle styled after the California mountain bikes, the &quot;Klunker 5&quot;. Using the standard electro-forged cantilever frame, and fitted with five-speed derailleur gears and knobby tires, the &quot;Klunker 5&quot; was never heavily marketed, and was not even listed in the Schwinn product catalog. Unlike its progenitors, the &quot;Klunker&quot; proved incapable of withstanding hard off-road use, and after an unsuccessful attempt to reintroduce the model as the &quot;Spitfire 5&quot;, it was dropped from production.

The company&#x27;s next answer to requests for a Schwinn mountain bike was the &quot;King Sting&quot; and the &quot;Sidewinder&quot;, inexpensive BMX-derived bicycles fabricated from existing electro-forged frame designs, and using off-the-shelf BMX parts. This proved to be a major miscalculation, as several new United States startup companies began producing high-quality frames designed from the ground up, and sourced from new, modern plants in Japan and Taiwan using new mass-production technologies such as TIG welding. 

Schwinn fielded a mountain bike racing team in the United States where their team rider Ned Overend won two consecutive NORBA Mountain Biking National Championships for the team in 1986 and 1987. Schwinn&#x27;s new competitors such as Specialized and Fisher MountainBikes were soon selling hundreds of thousands of mountain bikes at competitive prices to eager customers, setting sales records in a market niche that soon grew to enormous proportions.

===Factory and retooling issues===
By this time, Schwinn&#x27;s bicycle factory was completely outmoded in comparison to modern bicycle manufacturing centers in Japan and Taiwan, who had continually invested in new and up-to-date manufacturing techniques and materials, including new joinery techniques and the latest lightweight chrome-molybdenum alloy steel, and later, aluminum. The company considered relocating to a single facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but financing the project would have required outside investors, perhaps even foreign ones. Schwinn&#x27;s board of directors rejected the new plant in 1978.

===Labor troubles, bankruptcy and demise===
In October 1979, Edward R. Schwinn, Jr. took over the presidency of Schwinn from his uncle Frank, ensuring continuity of Schwinn family in the operations of the company. However, worker dissatisfaction, seldom a problem in the early years, grew with steep increases in inflation. In late 1980, the Schwinn Chicago factory workers voted to affiliate with the United Auto Workers. Plant assembly workers began a strike for higher pay in September 1980, and 1,400 assembly workers walked off the job for thirteen weeks. Although the strike ended in February 1981, only about 65% of the prior workforce was recalled to work. By this time, increasingly stiff competition from lower-cost competition in Asia resulted in declining market share. These problems were exacerbated by the inefficiency of producing modern bicycles in the 80-year-old Chicago factory equipped with outdated equipment and ancient inventory and information systems. After numerous meetings, the board of directors voted to source most Schwinn bicycle production from their established bicycle supplier in Japan, Panasonic Bicycle. As Schwinn&#x27;s first outsourced bicycles, Panasonic had been the only vendor to meet Schwinn&#x27;s production requirements. Later, Schwinn would sign a production supply agreement with Giant Bicycles of Taiwan. As time passed, Schwinn would import more and more Asian-made bicycles to carry the Schwinn brand, eventually becoming more a marketer than a maker of bikes.

In an attempt to preserve remaining market share and avoid a unionized workforce, Schwinn later moved remaining United States bicycle production to a new plant in Greenville, Mississippi, where bicycles could be assembled at lower cost using parts sourced from Asia. The Greenville plant was not a success, as it was remote from both the corporate headquarters as well as the West coast ports where the material components arrived from Taiwan and Japan. Additionally, Asian manufacturers could still produce and assemble high-quality bicycles at a far lower per-unit cost than Schwinn at its plant in Mississippi, which had to import parts, then assemble them using higher-priced United States labor. The Greenville manufacturing facility, which had lost money each year of its operation, finally closed in 1991, laying off 250 workers in the process.
After a series of production cuts and labor force reductions, Schwinn was able to restructure its operations. The company renegotiated loans by putting up the company and the name as collateral, and increased production of the &quot;Airdyne&quot; exercise bicycle, a moneymaker even in bad times. The company took advantage of the continued demand for mountain bikes, redesigning its product line with Schwinn-designed chrome-molybdenum alloy steel frames. Supplied by manufacturers in Asia, the new arrangement enabled Schwinn to reduce costs and stay competitive with Asian bicycle companies. In Taiwan, Schwinn was able to conclude a new production agreement with Giant Bicycles, transferring Schwinn&#x27;s frame design and manufacturing expertise to Giant in the process. With this partnership, Schwinn increased their bicycle sales to 500,000 per year by 1985. Schwinn&#x27;s annual sales soon neared the million mark, and the company turned a profit in the late 1980s. However, after unsuccessfully attempting to purchase a minority share in Giant Bicycles, Edward Schwinn Jr. negotiated a separate deal with the China Bicycle Co. (CBC) to produce bicycles to be sold under the Schwinn brand. In retaliation, Giant introduced its own line of Giant-branded bikes for sale to retailers carrying Schwinn bikes. Both Giant and CBC used the dies, plans, and technological expertise from Schwinn to greatly expand the market share of bicycles made under their own proprietary brands, first in Europe, and later in the United States.

By 1990, other United States bicycle companies with reputations for excellence in design such as Trek, Specialized, and Cannondale had cut further into Schwinn&#x27;s market. Unable to produce bicycles in the United States at a competitive cost, by the end of 1991 Schwinn was sourcing its bicycles from overseas manufacturers. This period in Schwinn&#x27;s history plays a cameo role in a novel by Dave Eggers, &quot;A Hologram for the King&quot; (2012). Seeking to increase its brand recognition, Schwinn established additional company-operated shops, a move that alienated existing independent bike retailers in cities where the company stores had opened. This in turn led to further inroads by domestic and foreign competitors. Faced with a downward sales spiral, Schwinn went into bankruptcy in 1992. The company and name were bought by the Zell/Chilmark Fund, an investment group, in 1993. Zell moved Schwinn&#x27;s corporate headquarters to Boulder, Colorado.

In 1993, Richard Schwinn, great-grandson of Ignaz Schwinn, with business partner Marc Muller, purchased the Schwinn Paramount plant in Waterford, Wisconsin, where Paramounts were built since 1980. They founded Waterford Precision Cycles, which ceased operations in 2023. In 2003 they employed 18 workers building lightweight bicycles.
In late 1997, Questor Partners Fund, led by Jay Alix and Dan Lufkin, purchased Schwinn Bicycles. Questor/Schwinn later purchased GT Bicycles in 1998 for $8 a share in cash, roughly $80 million. The new company produced a series of well-regarded mountain bikes bearing the Schwinn name, called the Homegrown series. In 2001, Schwinn/GT declared bankruptcy.

===Sale to Pacific and Nautilus===
In September 2001, the Schwinn Company, its assets, and the rights to the brand, together with that of the GT Bicycle, was purchased at a bankruptcy auction by Pacific Cycle, a company previously known for mass-market brands owned by Wind Point Partners. In 2004, Pacific Cycle was in turn acquired by Dorel Industries. Once America&#x27;s preeminent bicycle manufacturer, the Schwinn brand, as with many other bicycle manufacturers, affixed itself to fabrication in China and Taiwan, fueling most of its corporate parent&#x27;s growth. In 2010, Dorel launched a major advertising campaign to revive and contemporize the Schwinn brand by associating it with consumer childhood memories of the company, including a reintroduction of the Schwinn &quot;Sting-Ray&quot;. In 2021, Dutch conglomerate Pon Holdings acquired Pacific Cycle.

Direct Focus, Inc., a marketing company for fitness and healthy lifestyle products, acquired the assets of Schwinn/GT&#x27;s fitness equipment division. Direct Focus, Inc. subsequently became Nautilus, Inc.

<text>A diamond interchange is a common type of road junction, used where a controlled-access highway crosses a minor road.

== Design ==
The freeway itself is grade-separated from the minor road, one crossing the other over a bridge. Approaching the interchange from either direction, an off-ramp diverges only slightly from the freeway and runs directly across the minor road, becoming an on-ramp that returns to the freeway in similar fashion.

The two places where the ramps meet the road are treated as conventional intersections. In the United States, where this form of interchange is very common, particularly in rural areas, traffic on the off-ramp typically faces a stop sign at the minor road, while traffic turning onto the freeway is unrestricted.

The diamond interchange uses less space than most types of freeway interchange, and avoids the interweaving traffic flows that occur in interchanges such as the cloverleaf. Thus, diamond interchanges are most effective in areas where traffic is light and a more expensive interchange type is not needed. But where traffic volumes are higher, the two intersections within the interchange often feature additional traffic control measures such as traffic lights and extra lanes dedicated to turning traffic.

The at-grade variant of the diamond interchange is the split intersection.

==Variations==
=== Dumbbell ===
The ramp intersections may also be configured as a pair of roundabouts to create a type of diamond interchange often called a dumbbell interchange (due to its aerial resemblance to a dumbbell), and sometimes called a double roundabout interchange. Because roundabouts can generally handle traffic with fewer approach lanes than other intersection types, interchange construction costs can be reduced by eliminating the need for a wider bridge. This configuration allows other roads to form approach legs to the roundabouts and also allows easy U-turns.

This type of interchange is common in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and is becoming increasingly common in the United States. Examples of dumbbell interchanges in the United States are located on Interstate 35 in Medford, Minnesota, on Interstate 87 in Malta, New York, on Interstate 17 at Happy Valley Road north of Phoenix, Arizona, and on Interstate 80 at California State Route 89 (exit 185) in Truckee, California. An example in Canada is found on the Pat Bay Highway in North Saanich, British Columbia, near Victoria International Airport.

One or both roundabouts in the dumbbell interchange may also contain side lanes to increase the capacity. A good example of such a &quot;turbo&quot; dumbbell interchange, which was formerly a half cloverleaf, can be seen in J√ºlich, Germany at .

There are interchanges similar to dumbbells in which the ramps do not meet the roundabouts at intersections; these more closely resemble bowtie intersections. One such interchange exists at the junction between the Ruta Interbalnearia and Route 35 North near La Floresta, Uruguay ().

=== Dogbone ===
A variation of the dumbbell interchange, often called a dogbone interchange (due to its aerial resemblance to a real or toy dog bone), and sometimes also called a &quot;double roundabout interchange&quot;, occurs when the roundabouts do not form a complete circle but instead have a &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot; shape. These two raindrop roundabouts are fused together, forming a single &quot;squashed&quot; roundabout.

This configuration reduces conflicts between vehicles entering the raindrop roundabouts from the ramps, reducing queueing and delays, compared with the dumbbell interchange. Direct U-turns are not possible, although the movement can be made by circulating around both raindrop roundabouts. An example of a dogbone interchange in the United States is located on Interstate 70 in Avon, Colorado, United States; more compact examples, which show less of the characteristic &quot;dog bone&quot; shape, are located along Keystone Parkway in Carmel, Indiana, United States. Several interchanges similar to those along Keystone Parkway are being built along the new US 31 freeway under construction in northern Indiana.

There are some hybrid interchanges of dumbbell and dogbone having one raindrop and one full roundabout. This is made when the roundabout intersects more roads than the cross street and ramps. Some examples are at exit 38 of the N7 road in Groningen, Netherlands (at ); and Ennis Avenue (National Route 1) at Safety Bay Road (State Route 18 / Tourist Drive 202) on the border of the suburbs of Waikiki and Warnbro in the City of Rockingham, Western Australia (at ).

A tennis ball interchange resembles a dogbone interchange, with the difference being that right turning movements (in a country where traffic drives on the left) cut through the roundabouts like a regular diamond interchange instead of going around the roundabout. Such a design is found in Perth, Western Australia, between Roe Highway (State Route 3) and Berkshire Road (at ).

=== Tight diamond ===
A tight diamond interchange (TDI), also known as a compressed diamond interchange or a tight urban diamond interchange (TUDI), is sometimes used in areas where there is insufficient right-of-way for a standard diamond interchange. The pair of intersections where the ramps meet the minor road are closely spaced. This spacing forces the turn lanes for each direction to run beside each other, causing the minor road to be wider than it would be if it were a standard diamond. Caltrans classifies this type as Type L-1.

=== Single-point urban ===
A single-point urban interchange (SPUI) is built with a large over- or clear underpass providing space for a single traffic signal controlled intersection with the ramps and the cross street. Caltrans classifies this type as Type L-13.

=== Contraflow left ===
A contraflow left interchange (CFL) is a modified TUDI, once installed at Lyons Road underneath Florida State Road 869, switching the left turn lanes on the cross street each other and bringing the long left turn phases from the single-point urban interchange to the tight urban diamond interchange at .

=== Diverging diamond ===
In a diverging diamond interchange (DDI) or (DCD), the two directions of traffic on the non-freeway road cross to the opposite side on both sides of the bridge at the freeway to save the third traffic signal phase.

=== Three-level diamond ===
In a three-level diamond interchange, the cross street is built in a third level with free flowing traffic as a second arterial road. The intersection is split up into four intersections, handling just two conflicting directions each.

Its two-level variant is the split diamond interchange.

Its at-grade variant is the town center intersection (TCI).

=== Continuous-flow diamond ===
A single-leg continuous-flow intersection (CFI) was built in 2014 in San Marcos, Texas, at the intersection of Aquarena Springs Drive (Loop 82), Interstate 35&#x27;s southbound frontage road and I-35&#x27;s southbound-to-northbound Texas U-turn. A two-leg CFI, also in San Marcos, was built in 2015 at the intersection of Hopkins Street (State Highway 80), I-35&#x27;s frontage roads and I-35&#x27;s Texas U-turns. In both intersections, the displaced left turn lanes merge with the Texas U-turn lanes.

===Split diamond===
A split diamond interchange has its ramps &quot;split&quot; between two crossroads, typically with an exit ramp/entrance ramp pair serving each of the crossroads. The crossroads themselves may be one-way or two-way, and are most often connected by frontage roads, usually one-way.

===Other===
Where HOV lanes are present for carpooling, the ramps of a diamond interchange may be folded to the inside lanes instead of the outside. In urban areas this saves some space as well as requiring only one intersection instead of the two one-way intersections, which in rural or suburban areas can be turned into a single-point urban interchange. This in turn reduces waiting time for motorists at traffic lights on the smaller road, which may be a large local thoroughfare with heavy traffic.

In Henrietta, New York, Jefferson Road (NY-252) crosses West Henrietta Road (NY-15) on a modified diamond interchange, where traffic merges onto NY-252 at signalized intersections without any merge lanes, as well as Texas U-turns and RIROs on the ramps.

<doc id="1094302" wikidata="Q115833" url="?curid=1094302" title="Bob Lutz (businessman)">
<text>Robert (Maximum Bob) Anthony Lutz (born February 12, 1932) is a Swiss-American automotive executive. He served as a top leader of all of the United States Big Three automobile manufacturers, having been in succession executive vice president (and board member) of Ford Motor Company, president and then vice chairman (and board member) of Chrysler Corporation, and vice chairman of General Motors.

==Early life==
Lutz was born in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, the son of Margaret and Robert Harry Lutz. His father was a vice chairman of Credit Suisse. Lutz emigrated from Switzerland to the United States aged seven, spending time in Scarsdale, New York, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1943, and returned to Switzerland in 1947 to attend school in Lausanne. He is fluent in English, French, and German. He has modest fluency in Italian.

Lutz received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in production management in 1961, followed by an MBA with a concentration in marketing with highest honors in 1962, both from the University of California, Berkeley.¬†He earned the latter when he was flying in the United States Marine Corps Reserve&#x27;s 4th Marine Aircraft Wing and supporting two of four young daughters by selling vacuum cleaners in Walnut Creek, California. He also received an honorary Doctorate of Law from Boston University in 1985, and an honorary degree of Doctor of Management from Kettering University in 2003. He is a trustee of the Marine Corps University Foundation and the Marine Military Academy.

==Professional career==
After leaving the Marines, Lutz spent eight years with GM Opel in Europe before joining BMW serving as executive vice president of sales at BMW for three years. He takes some credit in the development of the BMW 3 Series as well as their Motorsport division.

Lutz was also an executive vice president at Ford Motor Company. At Ford of Europe, he led the creation of the Ford Escort III, and Ford Sierra, and upon returning to the US in 1985, initiated development of the original Ford Explorer, and was a member of Ford&#x27;s board of directors. He was a frequent internal political rival of eventual Ford CEO Red Poling.

Lutz became head of Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s Global Product Development, including the successful Dodge Viper and LH series cars. Former Chrysler chairman and CEO Lee Iacocca, who helped steer the company back to profitability after receiving loans from private banks backed by the U.S. Government in 1979, said he should have picked Lutz as his successor rather than Bob Eaton upon Iacocca&#x27;s retirement at the end of 1992, but at the time Iacocca and Lutz were not getting along. Eaton was responsible for the sale of Chrysler to Daimler-Benz in 1998 which Daimler ended up backing out of in 2007 when it sold Chrysler to Cerberus Capital Management. Referring to the job performance of Eaton, Iacocca claimed that Lutz &quot;would eat him for lunch&quot;.

While at General Motors, Lutz championed the import of the Holden Monaro to the United States as the Pontiac GTO. Other cars such as the Cadillac Sixteen Concept; Saturn Sky and Pontiac Solstice; Pontiac G8; Chevrolet Malibu; Cadillac CTS; Buick Enclave; Cadillac Converj Concept; Cadillac CTS Coupe Concept; Chevrolet Camaro; Chevy Beat, Groove and Trax Concept Studies; and 2010 Buick Lacrosse, Chevrolet Equinox, and Cadillac SRX are said to be Lutz initiatives. Lutz has also emphasized a need to produce fuel efficient vehicles, backing the 2010 Chevrolet Volt.

Lutz maintained the &quot;Fastlane&quot; blog hosted at GM Blogs.

In 2008, Lutz said that &quot;the electrification of the automobile is inevitable&quot;.

On February 9, 2009, GM announced that Lutz would step down on April 1, 2009, from his position as vice chairman of Global Product Development, to take an advisory role. He was to retire from GM at the end of 2009. Lutz said that one reason for his decision was the increasing regulatory climate in Washington that would force GM to produce what federal regulators wanted, rather than what customers wanted. Lutz has expressed skepticism on the issue of global warming.

During a July 10, 2009, press conference, GM stated that Lutz would remain at GM as vice chairman responsible for all creative elements of products and customer relationships and that his role as vice chairman of Global Product Development would be assumed April 1, 2009, by Thomas G. Stephens, then executive vice president of Global Powertrain and Global Quality. Lutz, Stephens, and design chief Ed Welburn would work together to guide all creative aspects of design. Lutz would also lead the effort to better guide GM&#x27;s brands, and the automaker&#x27;s marketing, advertising, and communications teams would report to Lutz in an effort to develop a more consistent message and results. Lutz would report directly to Fritz Henderson, and be part of the newly formed executive committee. Lutz retired from General Motors May 2, 2010.

, Lutz was head of the consulting firm Lutz Communications. He is also chairman of The New Common School Foundation, a member of the board of trustees for the U.S. Marine Corps University Foundation, and vice chairman of the board of trustees for the Marine Military Academy in Harlingen, Texas. He joined the Transonic Combustion, Inc. board of directors on May 24, 2010.

On August 6, 2012, The NanoSteel Company, a nano-structured steel materials designer, announced an investment by GM Ventures in the company. On October 10, 2012, NanoSteel announced the appointment of Bob Lutz to its board of directors. The Providence, RI-based company said that it &quot;has achieved a significant breakthrough in the development of nano-structured sheet steel with exceptional strength and ductility&quot; for the automotive industry.

In 2015, Lutz was honored with an Edison Achievement Award for his commitment to innovation throughout his career.

In late-2017 Lutz wrote an article for &quot;Automotive News&quot; predicting upheaval within the car manufacturing industry, anticipating large-scale fleet ownership, removal of dealerships and an eventual ban on human driving of vehicles for transport.

<doc id="1094305" wikidata="Q791656" url="?curid=1094305" title="Away in a Manger">
<text>&quot;Away in a Manger&quot; is a Christmas carol first published in the late nineteenth century and used widely throughout the English-speaking world. In Britain, it is one of the most popular carols; a 1996 Gallup Poll ranked it joint second. Although it was long claimed to be the work of German religious reformer Martin Luther, the carol is now thought to be wholly American in origin. The two most common musical settings are by William J. Kirkpatrick (1895) and James Ramsey Murray (1887).

==Words==
The popularity of the carol has led to many variants in the words, which are discussed in detail below. The following are taken from Kirkpatrick (1895):

===Variants===
Almost every line in the carol has recorded variants. The most significant include the following:
* Verse 1, line 1: The earliest sources have &quot;no crib for his bed&quot;. &quot;No crib for a bed&quot; is found in Murray (1887).
* Verse 1, line 2: The earliest sources have &quot;lay down his sweet head.&quot; &quot;Laid&quot; is first found in &quot;Little Children&#x27;s Book&quot; (1885) ‚Äì see lie/lay distinction.
* Verse 1, line 2: Some sources, from as early as 1900, have &quot;his wee head&quot; instead of &quot;his sweet head.&quot;
* Verse 1, line 3: The earliest sources have &quot;[t]he stars in the sky looked down where he lay&quot;, leading to this line having only ten syllables as opposed to the eleven of the other lines of the verse (unless &quot;looked&quot; is pronounced as two syllables, as is done in some musical settings). Herbert (1891) substituted &quot;stars in the heaven&quot;, and Gabriel (1892) &quot;stars in the heavens&quot; to regularize the meter. Kirkpatrick (1895) may have been the first to use &quot;stars in the bright sky&quot;.
* Verse 1, line 4: The earliest sources have &quot;asleep in the hay.&quot; Murray (1887) changes this to &quot;on the hay.&quot;
* Verse 2, line 1: The earliest sources have &quot;the poor baby wakes&quot;. &quot;The baby awakes&quot; is found in Herbert (1891).
* Verse 2, line 3: Some sources have &quot;look down from on high&quot;.
* Verse 2, line 4: This line has a multitude of variants:
** &quot;And stay by my crib watching my lullaby&quot; (&quot;Christian Cynosure&quot;, 1882)
** &quot;And stay by my crib to watch lullaby&quot; (&quot;Seamen&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, 1883)
** &quot;And stay by my cradle to watch lullaby&quot; (Murray, 1887)
** &quot;And watch by me always, and ever be nigh&quot; (1890)
** &quot;And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh&quot; (Herbert, 1891)
** &quot;And watch o&#x27;er my bed while in slumber I lie&quot; (1893)
** &quot;And stay by my side until morning is nigh&quot; (1905)
* Verse 3 is absent from the earliest publications. It first appears in &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Vineyard Songs&quot; (1892).
* Verse 3, line 4: Instead of &quot;take us to heaven&quot;, one popular variant found from 1899 has &quot;fit us for heaven&quot;.

==History==

===First and second verses===
The origin of the words is obscure. An early appearance was on 2 March 1882, in the &quot; Corner&quot; section of the anti-Masonic journal &quot;The Christian Cynosure&quot;. Under the heading &quot;Luther&#x27;s Cradle Song&quot;, an anonymous author contributed the first two verses, writing: 

A near-identical article appeared in the November 1883 issue of &quot;The Sailors&#x27; Magazine and Seamen&#x27;s Friend&quot;.

Another early version was published in &quot;Little Pilgrim Songs&quot;, a book of Christian music for young children, whose preface is dated 10 November 1883. &quot;Little Pilgrim Songs&quot; includes a similar claim that the song was written &quot;by Martin Luther for his own children&quot;.

An article in the May 1884 issue of &quot;The Myrtle&quot;, a periodical of the Universalist Publishing House in Boston, also included the carol, stating: All four sources include almost-identical text of the first two verses, with no music. &quot;Little Pilgrim Songs&quot; and &quot;The Myrtle&quot; both suggest the melody of &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot;

===Third verse===

The third stanza, &quot;Be near me, Lord Jesus&quot;, is absent from the known early sources. Its first known appearance was in &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Vineyard Songs&quot; (1892), where it was set to a melody by Charles H. Gabriel (simply marked &quot;C&quot;). Gabriel credited the entire text to Luther and gave it the title &quot;Cradle Song&quot;. Decades later, a story was published attributing the third verse to John T. MacFarland:

Since this story dates the composition of the stanza to 1904‚Äì1908, over a decade after its first known appearance, Hill judges that &quot;the 1892 publication [of &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Vineyard Songs&quot;] renders the Bishop&#x27;s story suspect, and additional evidence must be found before McFarland can be safely credited with the writing of the third stanza.&quot; It has been suggested that Gabriel may have written the third stanza himself and attributed it to Luther.

===Popularity===
By Christmas of 1883, &quot;Luther&#x27;s Cradle Song&quot; was already being performed as a recitation as part of a Sunday School celebration in a church in Nashville. The early popularity of the hymn may also be reflected in a report (published in 1885, but covering the year 1884) from an American mission in Maharashtra, India, stating: By 1891, Hill writes, &quot;the carol was sweeping the country [the United States]&quot;, with at least four musical settings published that year.

==Spurious attribution to Luther==
The great majority of early publications ascribe the words to German Protestant reformer Martin Luther. Many go so far as to title the carol &quot;Luther&#x27;s Cradle Song&quot; or &quot;Luther&#x27;s Cradle Hymn&quot;, to describe the English words as having been &quot;translated&quot; from Luther, or to speak of its alleged popularity in Germany. The claim of Luther&#x27;s authorship continued to be made well into the 20th century, but it is now rejected as spurious for the following reasons:

* No text in Luther&#x27;s known writings corresponds to the carol.
* No German text for the carol has been found from earlier than 1934, more than 50 years after the first English publication. That German text reads awkwardly, and appears to be a result of a translation from the English original.
* The unadorned narrative style of the carol is atypical of Luther, who, Hill states, &quot;could never throw off his role of educator and doctrinarian.&quot;
* When some earlier 19th-century sources do mention a carol written by Luther for his son Hans, they are referring to a different text: &quot;Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her&quot;.

Richard Hill, in a comprehensive study of the carol written in 1945, suggested that &quot;Away in a Manger&quot; might have originated in &quot;a little play for children to act or a story about Luther celebrating Christmas with his children&quot;, likely connected with the 400th anniversary of the reformer&#x27;s birth in 1883.

The most popular musical setting in the United States is commonly known as &quot;Mueller&quot;. The melody was first published, under the title &quot;Luther&#x27;s Cradle Hymn&quot;, by James R. Murray in his collection &quot;Dainty Songs for Little Lads and Lasses&quot; (1887).

Murray included a claim that the hymn was &quot;[c]omposed by Martin Luther for his children&quot;. Hill writes: 

As a result of this &quot;tactical mistake&quot;, Murray&#x27;s melody appeared, without credit, in several subsequent publications. By 1914, the melody was attributed to &quot;Carl Mueller&quot;, and this attribution was repeated several times in other publications. The identity of &quot;Carl Mueller&quot; is unknown, but the tune is widely known as &quot;Mueller&quot; as a result.

The standard melody in Britain, Ireland and Canada is &quot;Cradle Song&quot;. The tune, written by the Irish-American composer William J. Kirkpatrick, was first published as part of the collection &quot;Around the World with Christmas&quot; (1895), a &quot;Christmas Exercise&quot; for schools featuring material representing various countries: &quot;Away in a Manger&quot; was included, under the title &quot;Luther&#x27;s Cradle Hymn&quot;, as a representative of &quot;The German Fatherland&quot;.

Kirkpatrick&#x27;s melody was later published in numerous hymnbooks, and was the setting that, in Hill&#x27;s words, &quot;first carried the words beyond the confines of the United States&quot;, being included in collections such as Carey Bonner&#x27;s &quot;Sunday School Hymnary&quot; (1905). It remains the most popular musical setting of &quot;Away in a Manger&quot; outside the United States.
===Other musical settings===
In his article &quot;Not So Far Away in a Manger; Forty-One Settings of an American Carol&quot;, published in the &quot;Music Library Association Notes&quot; (second series) III, no. 1, for December 1945, Richard Hill treated 41 of the nearly 200 different musical settings of this text.

The first music mentioned in connection with &quot;Away in a Manger&quot; was a pre-existing composition: &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot; (also known as &quot;There&#x27;s No Place Like Home&quot;). This was suggested as a musical setting in &quot;Little Pilgrim Songs&quot; (1883) and &quot;The Myrtle&quot; (1884), and continued to be mentioned as an appropriate melody for decades to come. A musical arrangement was published in the early 1920s.

The first known musical setting specifically published with the words appeared in an Evangelical Lutheran Sunday school collection, &quot;Little Children&#x27;s Book for Schools and Families&quot; (1885; preface dated Christmas 1884), where it simply bore the title &quot;Away in a Manger&quot;. It was set to a tune called &quot;St. Kilda&quot;, credited to J.E. Clark. The tune, according to Hill, &quot;gives every appearance of being a standard melody used elsewhere for other hymns&quot;, but Hill adds that &quot;no information on J. E. Clark or any other printing of his tune, previous or later, has been located.&quot; This publication is also notable for refraining from attributing the carol to Luther.

The melody by John Bunyan Herbert (first published in 1891), is identified by Hill as among the most popular. Like Murray&#x27;s, Herbert&#x27;s setting was often republished without credit to the original composer, with the melody sometimes even being misattributed to Luther himself.

Charles H. Gabriel, already mentioned as being the first to publish the third verse in 1892, is also notable for having published more different musical arrangements of the hymn than any other known composer. His 1896 setting, reprinted in many different collections, is based on his 1892 melody but adds a chorus at the end of each verse, with the word &quot;asleep&quot; sung antiphonally.

Another popular arrangement, found at least as early as 1897, sets the words to Jonathan E. Spilman&#x27;s 1838 melody &quot;Flow Gently, Sweet Afton&quot;. Hill, writing in 1941, found Spilman&#x27;s musical setting to be the second-most published, after Murray&#x27;s.

An arrangement dating from 1911 sets the words to an &quot;old Normandy Carol&quot;. This melody was subsequently published in Carols for Choirs, arranged by Reginald Jacques.

An arrangement by Christopher Erskine combines the two most popular tunes for the hymn, from Kirkpatrick and Murray. Erskine&#x27;s arrangement was first performed in 1996 at the annual pair of joint Carol Services in Manuka, Canberra, sung by the choirs of St Paul&#x27;s Church (Anglican) and St Christopher&#x27;s Cathedral (Roman Catholic). In this version, the Kirkpatrick setting is sung by one choir, and the Murray setting by the other choir, alternating through the first two verses. Both settings are sung together for the third verse.

<doc id="1094307" wikidata="Q2836720" url="?curid=1094307" title="The Mystery at Lilac Inn">
<text>The Mystery at Lilac Inn is the fourth volume in the &quot;Nancy Drew Mystery Stories&quot; series. It was first published in 1930 under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene. Mildred Wirt Benson was the ghostwriter of the 1930 edition.

In 1961, Harriet Stratemeyer Adams extensively revised the novel, creating a completely different story. The original omitted the lead characters from much of the action, the titular inn was only a place where a crime was committed with minor investigatory follow-up, and a domestic help sub-plot was out-of-place in 1961. Ethnic slurs and opinions were removed.

==Plot summaries &amp; controversy==

===1930 edition===

The story involves Nancy Drew helping her friend Emily Crandall find out who stole her heirloom jewels. Emily&#x27;s guardian, Mrs. Jane Willoughby, unwisely removes them from a safe deposit box and carries them with her while lunching at Lilac Inn, only to have her handbag stolen while the diners are distracted by a car crash.
In the meantime, Nancy must hire a temporary maid in the absence of Mrs. Gruen, her housekeeper. Nancy uncovers the thief, Mary Mason, one of the applicants for the position, on the staff at Lilac Inn. Nancy finds the hideout of the crooks, but is caught. She is bound and gagged and left aboard the gang&#x27;s sinking cabin cruiser to die, but is rescued by the river patrol. In the end, Nancy captures the jewel thief, exonerates the guardian, and returns her orphaned friend&#x27;s fortune to her.

===1961 edition===

Nancy Drew and her friend Helen are visiting Lilac Inn, recently renovated for Nancy‚Äôs friend, Emily Willoughby‚Äôs, wedding. Nancy discovers that an impersonator is forging her signature to rack up bills back in River Heights. Emily tells her that there have been sightings of apparitions in the lilac grove.
Stood up for a scuba date with Emily‚Äôs best man, Nancy is attacked while solo diving. Emily&#x27;s inheritance is stolen during a blackout. Nancy experiences an explosion and cabin fire, an attack by the ghostly woman in the grove, and repeated negative interactions with inn staffer Maud Potter.
Nancy impersonates the apparition only to come face to face with it, who looks just like Nancy. The ‚Äùapparition‚Äú is revealed to be an actress looking for money at Lilac Inn and revenge on Nancy‚Äôs father for putting her in jail. Like in the original, Nancy is captured by the gang, this time left tied up aboard a damaged submarine, but is again rescued by the harbor patrol.

===Racism===

The novel was extensively revised in 1961, partially due to elements of racism in the original novel. 
In the 1930 edition, Nancy uses racial stereotyping to describe potential replacement housekeepers whom she has rejected (they are black, Irish, and Scottish, respectively). Mary Mason, the antagonist, is described as an &quot;impudent,&quot; &quot;dark-complexioned&quot; girl that Nancy only realizes is involved in the crime after seeing her at an exclusive, upscale dress shop that Nancy frequents, where she comments &quot;Surely a girl in her circumstances cannot afford to buy dresses at such a place as this.&quot;

==Artwork==

The book was printed with a navy jacket and four glossy illustrations, all by artist Russell H. Tandy.

In 1950, the cover art was updated with work by artist Bill Gillies. The text was completely rewritten by Harriet Stratemeyer Adams in 1961. The cover art was changed again to reflect the new story, this time by artist Rudy Nappi, and internal plain paper illustrations were added. Only the first two printings of this volume were available in a dust jacket. The book&#x27;s text and artwork remained the same when the publisher switched to picture-cover illustrated binding editions in 1962.

R.H. Tandy illustrated Nancy spying on the criminals in the original cover art, along with a frontispiece and three internal illustrations showing various elements of the story. He updated the frontispiece in 1943. In 1950, the dust jacket art was changed to show an updated version of Nancy with the crooks behind her. This art was not retained for the story revision in 1961, as the scene is eliminated by a completely different story. Rudy Nappi illustrates a ghostly picture of two girls illuminated by glowing lights in the cuff of their long-sleeved gowns. (The 1961 cover art appears to feature both Nancy, facing, and a mysterious dark-haired girl. In actuality, Nancy has her back to the reader, and is the dark-haired girl in the foreground; the other girl is actually Nancy&#x27;s impostor.)

==Adaptations ==
The 12th installment in the Nancy Drew point-and-click adventure game series by Her Interactive, named &quot;Nancy Drew: Secret of the Old Clock&quot;, is loosely based on the novel and also incorporate elements from &quot;The Secret of the Old Clock&quot;, &quot;The Hidden Staircase&quot;, and &quot;The Bungalow Mystery&quot;.

In the &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; television series, The Lilac Inn was renovated by Tiffany Hudson before her death.

<text>John Brown Hamilton (December 1, 1847 ‚Äì December 24, 1898) was an American physician and soldier. He was appointed the second Surgeon General of the United States from 1879 to 1891.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Hamilton was born on at Otter Creek Township, Jersey County, Illinois, near the present town of Otterville. He was educated at the Hamilton School, operated by his family, and apprenticed at age 16 to physician Joseph O. Hamilton. The following year (1864), Hamilton enlisted in G Company, 61st Illinois Regiment, of which his father, Reverend Benjamin B. Hamilton, was chaplain. After the close of the Civil War, he attended Rush Medical College in Chicago (1869, MD) and entered private practice.

===Career===

====Marine Hospital Service (MHS)====
Hamilton&#x27;s wartime experiences exerted their influence, drawing him from private medical practice into a commission as an Assistant Surgeon in the United States Army (1874) and after he resigned from the Army, into the Regular Corps of the Marine Hospital Service (MHS). In 1876, the 24-year-old Hamilton sat for the first examination for entrance into MHS, passed with flying colors, and was commissioned as an Assistant Surgeon on Oct 21, 1876. His talent in public health practice revealed itself early, during an 1877 assignment to the Boston Marine Hospital at Chelsea, Massachusetts. Changing land use in the area had blocked hospital sewage from draining properly, causing unexpected outbreaks of infectious disease among patients. Hamilton resolved the crisis successfully by directing a renovation of the facility&#x27;s drainage and sewage systems.

====Surgeon General====
On April 3, 1879, Hamilton was appointed Supervising Surgeon General, succeeding fellow Army veteran and Chicagoan Dr. John Woodworth, the first Supervising Surgeon. Woodworth had died in office, amidst a political battle with the fledgling American Public Health Association and its allies in the United States Congress over the possibility that a new National Board of Health would supersede the newly revamped MHS (1871).

That MHS outlived the National Board of Health and emerged in the 1890s reinvigorated is a testament to Hamilton&#x27;s skills as a political negotiator as well as a bureaucrat. Under his tenure, MHS gained authorities to establish a national quarantine on sea and land (interstate), formal recognition of merit-based requirements for a Commissioned Corps of medical officers, and a new laboratory devoted to bacteriology, the newest public health science of the day.

====Development of quarantine policy====
Two national epidemics framed Hamilton&#x27;s tenure: the yellow fever epidemic of 1878 that raged along the Mississippi River Valley and the Asiatic cholera epidemic of 1892, which hit New York City with particular ferocity. Sanitary cordons, or quarantine, were the primary response to yellow fever, to block the progress of disease believed to be conveyed not only on boats and foot traffic but also now by railroad. Instituting quarantines, however, meant Federal intervention into what was widely held to be state police powers and met resistance in the southeastern United States where the issue of yellow fever, and its impact on trade, were most critical.

Advocates of a National Board of Health, including Army Surgeon John Shaw Billings, were spurred to action by the insufficient funding allotted to the Quarantine Act of 1878. Over the following four years, Hamilton would press Billings at every turn, in a protracted, ultimately successful effort to regain authorities and recognition of MHS as the central Federal public health agency. When Billings began publishing MHS&#x27;s Bulletin under the Board&#x27;s auspices, Hamilton countered by persuading Congress to fund new Marine Hospitals in locations like Sitka, Alaska, to strengthen collaboration with the Revenue Cutter Service (predecessor to the United States Coast Guard).

The Board distributed grants-in-aid to state and territorial health departments for what were called &quot;inland quarantines&quot; but had a mixed record in regulating the uses to which grants were put and made political enemies when it attempted to quell yellow fever by means of a quarantine station on Ship Island, near New Orleans.

While the Board struggled with clumsy administrative mechanisms, Hamilton demonstrated how MHS&#x27;s relationships with customs inspectors and the Revenue Cutter Service enabled a quick and effective quarantine response to smallpox aboard a Mississippi River steamboat at Fort Benton, Montana Territory (May 1882), and how MHS blocked yellow fever in Mexico from entry into Brownsville, Texas by means of a sanitary cordon hastily assembled around the region. Congress recognized Hamilton&#x27;s leadership and in 1882 and 1883 awarded MHS a $100,000 fund for investigating epidemics, monies that had been slated for the Board. When Billings and his colleagues attempted to revive the idea of a National Board as a new Bureau of Health within the Department of the Interior, Hamilton announced that during August 1887 MHS had established a Hygienic Laboratory (predecessor to the National Institutes of Health), where Dr. Joseph J. Kinyoun and his staff were applying the new science of bacteriology to examine cholera. In the end, the National Board of Health lost both funding and support from Congress, which gave the Board&#x27;s enlarged authorities, and its quarantine stations, to MHS.

Issues surrounding the practice of quarantine drove Hamilton&#x27;s work in public health. It was no coincidence that the Hygienic Laboratory began in an attic at Staten Island&#x27;s Marine Hospital, near Ellis Island, the single busiest port of entry for immigrants during this period. Earlier on, Hamilton had established a Marine Hospital on Bedloe&#x27;s Island, future site of the Statue of Liberty. Although MHS would not receive formal authority to issue domestic quarantines until 1893, Hamilton and his staff worked with the Congress to advance incremental changes toward a national policy. Maritime quarantine legislation (Act of August 1, 1888) strengthened the Act of 1878, adding new Federal quarantine stations along the East and West coasts; March 1891 legislation made medical inspection of immigrants part of MHS&#x27;s duties; and interstate quarantine legislation (Act of March 27, 1890) gave MHS authority to establish quarantines against epidemic cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, and plague. On the request of his successor, Surgeon General Walter Wyman, Hamilton also returned to New York during the 1892 cholera pandemic, to set up a quarantine camp at Sandy Hook (Camp Low).

====Administrative reforms====
Hamilton made limited progress with the Congress realizing Woodworth&#x27;s reform plans to set MHS on sound fiscal and professional moorings. The Shipping Act of June 26, 1884 replaced the hospital tax charged to merchant seamen in favor of financing health services by means of a tonnage tax on foreign ships landing in domestic ports, supplemented by deficiency appropriations. And after Hamilton issued regulations specifying competitive examinations for entrance into a corps of medical officers, the Congress formally authorized the Commissioned Corps with the Act of January 4, 1889.

He was not able, however, to win an equal footing for MHS&#x27;s Commissioned Corps with the salaries and ranks accorded to military medical officers and as a result, resigned his post as Surgeon General on June 1, 1891.

===Personal life===
Hamilton was a cousin of the painter Howard Chandler Christy. Hamilton married Mary L. Frost and they had a son, Dr. Ralph A. Hamilton, and a daughter, the artist Blanche Hamilton (1880-1970), who Christy encouraged to study painting with William Merritt Chase. Hamilton was recommissioned as a Surgeon and assigned to Chicago&#x27;s Marine Hospital. Hamilton led a full professional life, serving as a Professor of Surgery at his alma mater, Rush Medical College, and as editor of the new &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (1893‚Äì1898).

Hamilton was a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States by right of his father&#x27;s service as a chaplain in the Civil War. He originally joined the Order as a companion of the second class, a status reserved for the eldest sons of veteran companions of the Order and succeeded his father as a companion of the first class upon his father&#x27;s death.

Rather than accept an assignment to San Francisco, Hamilton resigned from MHS on November 13, 1896, and accepted the position of Superintendent of the Northern Illinois State Hospital for the Insane in Elgin, Illinois. He would end his days at the hospital, dying there on December 24, 1898.

<text>Oregon Route 211 is a state highway which runs through part of the northeastern portion of Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Valley. Its northeastern terminus is its intersection with U.S. Route 26 in Sandy, a small town on the outskirts of the Portland metro area. It runs south and west, through farmland and forest, to its southwestern terminus with OR 99E in Woodburn. After its intersection with OR 99E, a short segment (about ) of Oregon Route 214 connects OR 211 with Interstate 5.

A segment (about ) of OR 211 north of Estacada is shared with OR 224.

OR 211 comprises the Eagle Creek-Sandy Highway No. 172 (see Oregon highways and routes), part of the Clackamas Highway No. 171 (over the concurrency with OR 224), and the Woodburn-Estacada Highway No. 161.

<doc id="1094319" wikidata="Q249139" url="?curid=1094319" title="Z≈çj≈ç-ji">
<text>is a J≈çdo-sh≈´ Buddhist temple in Tokyo, Japan. It is the main temple of the J≈çdo-sh≈´ (&quot;Pure Land&quot;) Chinzei sect of Buddhism in the Kant≈ç region. Its mountain name is San&#x27;en-zan (‰∏âÁ∏ÅÂ±±).

Z≈çj≈ç-ji is notable for its relationship with the Tokugawa clan, the rulers of Japan during the Edo period, with six of the Tokugawa sh≈çguns being buried in the Taitoku-in Mausoleum in the temple grounds. Also, the temple&#x27;s &quot;Sangedatsumon&quot; (main gate) is the oldest wooden building in Tokyo, dating from 1622. The original buildings, temples, mausoleums and the cathedral were destroyed by fire, natural disasters or air raids during World War II.

It is located in the Shiba neighborhood of Minato. The Shiba Park is built around the temple, with the Tokyo Tower standing beside it. In 2015 a Treasure Gallery was opened on the underground level of the &quot;Daiden&quot; (great hall), and it currently houses paintings of Kan≈ç Kazunobu and a model of the Taitoku-in Mausoleum.

The temple remains active &quot;as the main temple of Jodo shu and the central nembutsu seminary for priests and novices.&quot;

== History ==

Sh≈´ei (ÂÆóÂè°, 809-884), a disciple of K≈´kai, founded a temple named K≈çmy≈ç-ji (ÂÖâÊòéÂØ∫) at Kaizuka (Ë≤ùÂ°ö, present-day K≈çjimachi in Chiyoda, Tokyo); it is said to have been the forerunner of Z≈çj≈ç-ji. In 1393, during the Muromachi period, the temple, under its abbot Y≈´yo Sh≈çs≈ç, converted from Shingon to the J≈çdo school. Sh≈çs≈ç is thus regarded as the founder of Z≈çj≈ç-ji.

Together with Kan&#x27;ei-ji, during the Edo period Z≈çj≈ç-ji was the Tokugawa&#x27;s family temple. Tokugawa Ieyasu had the temple moved, first to Hibiya, then in 1590, at the time of expansion of Edo Castle, to its present location.

With the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate, the grounds took on the character of a public park. The temple was badly damaged in World War II, but still retains the air of a major temple.

== Architecture ==

At its peak the temple grounds had more than 120 buildings, but following the decline of Buddhism during the Meiji period (1868-1912), most of them burned during the Bombing of Tokyo in World War II. Reconstruction began after the war, with the &quot;Daiden&quot; (great hall) being rebuilt in 1974.



=== Sangedatsumon ===

The 21 meter (69 foot) two-storied main gate, was constructed in 1622, and it is therefore the oldest wooden building in Tokyo. The temple&#x27;s only original structure to survive the Second World War, it has been designated an Important Cultural Property.

&quot;San&quot; (‰∏â) means &quot;three&quot;, and &quot;Gedatsu&quot; (Ëß£ËÑ±) means &quot;Moksha&quot;. If someone passes through the gate, he can free himself from three passions (Ë≤™ &quot;Ton&quot;; &quot;greed&quot;, Áûã &quot;Shin&quot;; &quot;hatred&quot;, Áô° &quot;Chi&quot;; &quot;foolishness&quot;).

On the upper floor are enshrined an image of Gautama Buddha flanked by two attendants, and statues of the Sixteen Arhats.

=== Mausoleum of Tokugawa Sh≈çguns ===

Six of the 15 Tokugawa sh≈çguns are buried at Z≈çj≈ç-ji. The Taitoku-in Mausoleum of Hidetada (and the monument to his wife S≈´gen&#x27;in), Ienobu, and Ietsugu had been designated National Treasures of Japan, but were burned in World War II. At present, parts of two of their graves have the distinction of being Important Cultural Properties of Japan. Additional graves are located in the cemetery behind the Great Hall. Parts of the former grounds of the temple are now occupied by a park and two hotels. Tokugawa Iemochi also Iemochi&#x27;s wife, Kazu-no-Miya Chikako also buried in Zozo-ji.

=== Sentai Kosodate Jiz≈ç (Unborn Children Garden) ===

In one particular garden at the cemetery, rows of stone statues of children represent unborn children, including miscarried, aborted, and stillborn children. Parents can choose a statue in the garden and decorate it with small clothing and toys. Usually the statues are accompanied by a small gift for Jiz≈ç, the guardian of unborn children, to ensure that they are brought to the afterlife. Occasionally stones are piled by the statue; this is meant to ease the journey to the afterlife.

<doc id="1094327" wikidata="Q779523" url="?curid=1094327" title="William Ernest Hocking">
<text>William Ernest Hocking (August 10, 1873 ‚Äì June 12, 1966) was an American idealist philosopher at Harvard University. He continued the work of his philosophical teacher Josiah Royce (the founder of American idealism) in revising idealism to integrate and fit into empiricism, naturalism and pragmatism. He said that metaphysics has to make inductions from experience: &quot;That which does not work is not true.&quot; His major field of study was the philosophy of religion, but his 22 books included discussions of philosophy and human rights, world politics, freedom of the press, the philosophical psychology of human nature; education; and more. In 1958 he served as president of the Metaphysical Society of America. He led a highly influential study of missions in mainline Protestant churches in 1932. His &quot;Laymen&#x27;s Inquiry&quot; recommended a greater emphasis on education and social welfare, transfer of power to local groups, less reliance on evangelizing and conversion, and a much more respectful appreciation for local religions.

==Early life and education==
William Ernest Hocking was born in 1873 to William Hocking (1839‚Äì1903) and Julia Pratt (1848‚Äì1936) in Cleveland, Ohio. He was of Cornish American heritage. He attended public schools through high school. He worked first as a mapmaker, illustrator and printer&#x27;s devil, before entering Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts in 1894, where he intended to be an engineer. Reading William James&#x27; work &quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot; made him decide to go to Harvard to study philosophy, but he first worked for four years as a teacher and high school principal to earn the money for his studies.

In 1899 he entered Harvard, where he also studied with Josiah Royce in philosophy, earning his master&#x27;s degree in 1901. From 1902 to 1903 he studied in Germany, at G√∂ttingen, where he was the first American to study with Edmund Husserl, and in Berlin and Heidelberg. He returned to Harvard and completed his PhD in 1904.

==Career==
Hocking began teaching as an instructor in comparative religion at Andover Theological Seminary. In 1906 he and his wife moved to the West Coast, where he joined the philosophy faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, under George Howison. In 1908 he was called to Yale, where he served as an assistant professor and published his first major work, &quot;The Meaning of God in Human Experience&quot; (1912).

In 1914 Hocking returned to Harvard, where he eventually became Alford Professor of Natural Religion, Moral Philosophy and Civil Polity. During World War I, in 1917 he was among the first American civil engineers to reach the front in France. In 1918 he was appointed as an inspector of &quot;war issues&quot; courses in army training camps. His experience led him to write his second book, about morale. Returning to Harvard after the war, Hocking made the rest of his career there. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1921. From 1920 to the late-1930s, Hocking was a regular lecturer at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, where he lectured on &quot;Morale,&quot; &quot;Psychology,&quot; and &quot;Leadership.&quot;
Influenced by his visit to China, Hocking published a characteristically open minded study of the twelfth-century Chinese philosopher Zhu Xi. He argued that Zhu Xi&#x27;s thought was &quot;scientific,&quot; which not all European philosophers could claim, and therefore had something to teach westerners about democracy.

In 1936, Hocking was invited to give the Hibbert Lectures at Oxford and Cambridge universities in England. These reflected his thinking about the relation of Christianity to other world religions, as he had begun to support a universal religion. According to a review in &quot;TIME&quot; of the book containing his lectures, Hocking thought the important elements were

a belief in obligation, in a source of things which is good, in some kind of permanence for what is real in selfhood, and in the human aspect of deity.&quot; He pins his hope more on the common people throughout the world than on the theologians, finds in them a &quot;universal sense of the presence of God, and the intuition of the direction in which the will of God lies.

Hocking was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1943. That same year, he retired to Madison, New Hampshire and lived there until his death 23 years later.

==Study of missions==
In 1930‚Äì1932, he led the Commission of Appraisal, which studied the foreign mission work of six Protestant denominations in India, Burma, China, and Japan. Protestant missionaries had been doing evangelistic work in Asia since the nineteenth century, but several groups noted falling donations and nationalistic resistance, suggesting that changes might be needed.

The commission&#x27;s report, entitled &quot;Re-Thinking Missions: A Laymen&#x27;s Inquiry after One Hundred Years&quot; (1932) and known as the &quot;Hocking report,&quot; reflected changing ideas about the role of western missionaries in other cultures, and generated fierce debate. Commission members traveled to Asian cities to meet missionaries and local people. While in China, Hocking consulted with Pearl S. Buck, who was developing a similar critique of missions and who later threw her support behind the commission&#x27;s report. The Commission recommended a greater emphasis on education and welfare, transfer of power to local groups, less reliance on evangelizing, with respectful appreciation for local religions. A recommended related goal was the transition of local leadership and institutions. The commission also recommended reorganization in the US to coordinate and focus missionary efforts by creating a single organization for Protestant missions.

==Philosophical work==
In political philosophy, Hocking claimed that liberalism must be superseded by a new form of individualism in which the principle is: &quot;every man shall be a whole man.&quot; He believed that humans have only one natural right: &quot;an individual should develop the powers that are in him.&quot; The most important freedom is &quot;the freedom to perfect one&#x27;s freedom.&quot; He considered Christianity to be a great agent in the making of world civilization. But he believed that no dogma was the route to religious knowledge; rather, it is developed in the context of individual human experience.

He followed many German philosophers of his time, who were very influential. While studying in Germany, he had attended lectures by Wilhelm Dilthey, Paul Natorp, Edmund Husserl, Wilhelm Windelband and Heinrich Rickert. A staunch defender of idealism in the United States, Hocking was critical to thought about its meaning for &quot;religion,&quot; &quot;history&quot; or the &quot;superpersonal.&quot; In many regards he agreed with Wilhelm Luetgert, a German critic of idealism; however, he did not abandon his position. Hocking believed nothing that &quot;could be&quot; was ultimately irrational. He declared that there was no unknowable in &quot;what was.&quot;

===Negative pragmatism===
Perhaps Hocking&#x27;s most important contribution to philosophy is &quot;negative pragmatism,&quot; which means that what &quot;works&quot; pragmatically might or might not be true, but what does not work must be false. As Sahakian and Sahakian state, &quot;... if an idea does not work, then it cannot possibly be true, for the reason that the truth always works ...&quot;. Not only is this a criterion of truth, but it is a definition. It stipulates that truth is a constant ‚Äì &quot;truth always works&quot;. The Sahakian analysis indicates that what we may think is true might be only an illusion ‚Äì &quot;what appears to be working may or may not be true&quot;. As an example, to say that the sun is rising or setting, though seemingly true visually, is false because the appearance is due to the motion of the earth, not the sun moving up or down in relation to the earth. This illusion caused ancients to falsely believe in a geocentric universe rather than the currently accepted heliocentric view.

Hocking&#x27;s criterion was corroborated in the mid-20th century by Richard Feynman, a physicist who won the Nobel Prize. Feynman states that anything described as true &quot;... could never be proved right, because tomorrow&#x27;s experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right ...&quot; and, &quot;... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong.&quot; Finally, Sahakian and Sahakian note inadequacies and limited application to all of the other criteria of truth they present, but they do not denigrate negative pragmatism. To find an inadequacy in any criterion is to invoke negative pragmatism. To denote a failure in any criterion is to show how it &quot;disagrees with experiment&quot; (Feynman) and/or &quot;does not work&quot; (Hocking). By this means, they use negative pragmatism as the &quot;de facto&quot; criterion by which all other criteria are judged.

==Marriage and family==
Hocking married Agnes O&#x27;Reilly on June 28, 1905. She was the Irish-American daughter of the journalist and poet John Boyle O&#x27;Reilly and his wife Mary Murphy, also a journalist. They had three children: Richard (1906‚Äì2001), Hester (1909‚Äì1998) and Joan (1911‚Äì2000). After they returned to Cambridge, Agnes Hocking started an open-air school at their home, which she developed as the Shady Hill School. It continues near Harvard Square.

Richard became a professor of philosophy and his daughter Hester became affiliated with the St Augustine movement for civil rights and in April 1964 Hester along with three other woman (including Mary Parkman Peabody the mother of then Massachusetts governor Endicott Peabody) were arrested for protesting in a segregated lunch bar in the town, the event made front-page news at the time. Joan&#x27;s husband Edward A. Kracke Jr. was a historian of China.

==Final years and death==
In 1955 Hocking&#x27;s wife of 50 years Agnes died at the age of 78, Hocking published his final book &quot;The Coming World Civilisation&quot; in 1956.

<text>Arthur Ellis (February 28, 1890 ‚Äì October 19, 1964) was a Canadian lawyer and politician. He was mayor of Ottawa from 1928 until 1929.

He was born in Ottawa, the son of Ottawa mayor James A. Dent Ellis. Arthur Ellis studied at Osgoode Hall, was called to the Ontario bar in 1913 and set up practice in Ottawa. He served on the Ottawa school board in 1916 and 1917 before being elected to Ottawa city council where he served as an alderman in 1920 and then on the Board of Control for six years beginning in 1921. After two terms as mayor of Ottawa, he was elected in the 1929 provincial election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, representing Ottawa South for the Conservative Party.

He was rumoured to be in line to become Provincial Treasurer but was consigned to the backbench when Joseph Monteith defied pundits by retaining his seat in the legislature in the 1929 election. After the Ontario Liberal Party under Mitchell Hepburn took power in the 1934 provincial election Ellis moved to the Opposition bench where he achieved prominence as finance critic.

On November 25, 1935, he struck and killed a pedestrian on Highway 15 north of Kingston, Ontario and was charged with criminal negligence. He was acquitted in 1936, but the notoriety of the incident hurt his chances as a candidate in the Ontario Conservative leadership convention, held several weeks after the trial, in which he placed seventh with ten votes.

He remained in the legislature until 1937 when he retired from politics.

In 1940, as the result of a separate incident, Ellis was convicted of driving while drunk and sentenced to 30 days in jail. He had been charged after he hit a traffic cop&#x27;s motorcycle, failed to stop, and hit a parked car following a chase. An open bottle of wine was found in the front seat of Ellis&#x27; car.

<doc id="1094333" wikidata="Q1711154" url="?curid=1094333" title="Judy Erola">
<text>Judith Erola, n√©e Jacobson, (born 16 January 1934) is a former Canadian politician who represented the riding of Nickel Belt in the House of Commons of Canada from 1980 to 1984. She was a member of the Liberal Party.

==Broadcasting career==

Born in Sudbury, Ontario, Erola worked as a radio and television broadcaster in Sudbury. At CKSO-TV, she made history as the first woman employed by a Canadian television station as a weather reporter, and also presented segments on fashion. She later became an account executive for CHNO, and married Voito (Vic) Erola, the owner of a marina on Lake Panache, in 1955.

==Politics==

Following the death of her husband Vic in 1977, Erola decided to pursue a career in politics. She ran in the 1979 election as the Liberal candidate in Nickel Belt, losing to incumbent New Democrat John Rodriguez. Her campaign in that year was marked in part by a stumble when her election brochure called for &quot;nationalization of farmland usage policies&quot;; challenged in a radio interview to clarify her position given that the Liberal Party was generally opposed to nationalization, she clarified that the word was a typographical error whose intended meaning was rationalization.

Erola defeated Rodriguez in the 1980 election. She faced some controversy during and after the election campaign, both for characterizing Rodriguez as a Marxist in her election literature and for a telephone message targeted to housewives, which appeared to suggest that electing a woman to the House of Commons was more important than having representation for labour issues, a position which starkly divided the city in the still-lingering aftermath of the devastating 1978 Inco strike.

She served in the Cabinet of Canada for the entirety of her term as a federal Member of Parliament, despite an early perception that her caucus colleague Doug Frith was more likely to be chosen as the Sudbury area&#x27;s representative in cabinet. Over the course of her career, she served as Minister of State for Mines, Minister responsible for the Status of Women, Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and Minister of State for Social Development.

Shortly after being named to cabinet, Erola resigned her position as director and treasurer of the marina company, in compliance with federal conflict of interest regulations for cabinet ministers.

===Ministry of Mines===
As Minister of Mines, her first significant piece of legislation was a change to the Canada Labour Code, placing federally-regulated mines in Ontario under the stricter provincial health and safety laws by adopting the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act as federal law. The issue had long been championed in particular by uranium miners in Elliot Lake after a number of incidents in which workers had requested exemption under the provincial law from unsafe duties for which the federal law did not offer protection, but the workers criticized the process Erola used as an ineffective one that was likely to be challenged in the courts by mining companies. The change also permitted women, who had previously been barred from working underground in mines by federal regulation even though the provincial law permitted them, to work underground for the first time.

In June 1980, Erola faced criticism for using a government flight to transport colleagues from Ottawa to Sudbury to attend a testimonial dinner for former Liberal MP James Jerome.

During the 1981 provincial election, allegations surfaced that the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives had entered into a tacit agreement in 1980, under which the PCs ran an intentionally weak campaign in Nickel Belt to help Erola defeat Rodriguez, purportedly in exchange for the Liberals similarly throwing the Sudbury riding in 1981 to help Jim Gordon defeat incumbent NDP MPP Bud Germa; the allegations surfaced after the Liberals mounted a stronger campaign for the provincial seat than the PCs were expecting, and Liberal organizers denied that there was any mutual agreement.

Erola strongly supported the development of a mining equipment manufacturing industry in Canada as a bulwark against machinery shortages, and made special efforts to reassure mining companies that they would not be the target of a policy similar to the controversial National Energy Program. In June 1981, she announced a policy under which the federal government would give a $400 grant as an incentive to owners of propane-fuelled vehicles.

In 1982, she worked with Frith and Nickel Belt MPP Floyd Laughren to prevent significant layoffs by Inco Limited in the Sudbury area. She also instituted a task force within the ministry to examine potential solutions to the economic difficulties faced by mining communities when the local mining industry reduced staff or closed down.

===Status of Women===
In September 1981, Erola was given the position of Minister responsible for the Status of Women alongside her existing duties as Minister of Mines. She was the first woman to be named to that position, which had previously been held by Lloyd Axworthy.

In this role, she fought to protect Section Twenty-eight of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a section of the then-proposed Constitution Act, 1982 which guaranteed the gender equality rights of men and women, against attempts by some provinces to quash the provision. She also supported efforts to improve maternity leave pay for women, attempts to toughen federal laws against domestic violence, reforms to the Indian Act which would improve the rights of indigenous women marrying non-indigenous men, reforms to the organizational structure of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, and stricter policies against the use of gender stereotypes in government communications.

In October 1982, Erola also became the first woman ever appointed to the cabinet&#x27;s priorities and planning committee, which debates and decides on the direction of government policy.

===Consumer and Corporate Affairs===
In August 1983, Erola was shuffled out of the Ministry of Mines and was named Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. She immediately pledged to place a greater emphasis on consumer issues than her predecessor Andr√© Ouellet, who had sometimes been criticized for giving those issues short shrift.

In this role, some of her most public political battles involved the resistance of some organizations to the continued implementation of the metric system. She also proposed, but later abandoned, legislation to limit corporate mergers in newspaper publishing.

After Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s retirement as Prime Minister, Erola continued to serve as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs in the cabinet of John Turner. However, in the 1984 election, which saw the governing Liberals reduced to just 40 seats, Erola was defeated by Rodriguez.

==Post-political career==

In 1987, Erola became president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers&#x27; Association of Canada, a position she held until her retirement in 1998. She was succeeded in that role by Murray Elston, a former Member of Provincial Parliament in Ontario.

She was an ex officio delegate to the 2006 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election.

She has served on the board of Equal Voice, an organization which seeks to assist Canadian women in running for political office.

The tune first appeared as a secular dance tune known under the title &quot;Branle de l&#x27;Official&quot; in &quot;Orch√©sographie&quot;, a dance book written by the French cleric, composer and writer Thoinot Arbeau, pen name of Jehan Tabourot (1519‚Äì1593). The words are by the English composer George Ratcliffe Woodward (1848‚Äì1934), and the carol was first published in 1924 in his &quot;The Cambridge Carol-Book: Being Fifty-two Songs for Christmas, Easter, And Other Seasons&quot;. Woodward took an interest in church bell ringing. Woodward was the author of several carol books, including &quot;Songs of Syon&quot; and &quot;The Cowley Carol Book&quot;. The macaronic style is characteristic of Woodward&#x27;s delight in archaic poetry. Charles Wood harmonised the tune when it was published with Woodward&#x27;s text in &quot;The Cambridge Carol Book&quot;. More recently, Sir David Willcocks made an arrangement for the second book of &quot;Carols for Choirs&quot;.

==Text and melody==
&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Ding Dong! merrily on high
In heav&#x27;n the bells are ringing
Ding, dong! verily the sky

Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis

E&#x27;en so here below, below
Let steeple bells be swungen
And i-o, i-o, i-o

May ye beautifully rime
Your evetime song, ye singers

<doc id="1094346" wikidata="Q497464" url="?curid=1094346" title="African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde">
<text>The African Party of Independence of Cape Verde (, PAICV) is a democratic socialist political party in Cape Verde. It was the sole legal party in the country from 1981 to 1990. Its members are nicknamed &quot;&quot; (the tamarinds) in Portuguese, and they identify themselves with the color yellow.

==History==
In 1956, its forerunner, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), was founded by the Cape Verdean nationalist leader Am√≠lcar Cabral (born in Guinea-Bissau). PAIGC fought to overthrow the Portuguese Empire, unify Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau, and use its vanguardism to advance socialist revolution.

From 1961 on, the PAIGC fought a guerrilla warfare campaign in cooperation with its fraternal party umbrella group, the CONCP, during the Portuguese Colonial War. By 1973 the PAIGC controlled Guinea-Bissau, while Portugal&#x27;s own Carnation Revolution in 1974 effectively dissolved the empire, relinquishing Cape Verde within the next year.

After the wars of national liberation, the PAIGC established a socialist state within both territories under Amilcar Cabral&#x27;s brother, Lu√≠s Cabral.

===Establishment===
Following a military coup in Guinea-Bissau that ousted Cabral in November 1980, the Cape Verde portion of the party became the PAICV in January 1981; it was headed by the President of Cape Verde, Aristides Pereira. The PAICV was Cape Verde&#x27;s sole legal party from 1981 until the abolition of the one-party state in 1990.

===Multiparty democracy===
At an extraordinary party congress in February 1990, the PAICV approved the introduction of multiparty democracy. Pereira stepped down as General Secretary of PAICV in July 1990, and Prime Minister Pedro Pires replaced him in August 1990. The PAICV won 23 of the 79 National Assembly seats in the January 1991 multiparty parliamentary election, losing to the Movement for Democracy (MpD). Pereira was subsequently defeated in the February 1991 presidential election, and PAICV again fared poorly in the December 1991 local elections. At a party congress in August 1993, Pires was replaced as General Secretary by Aristides Lima and was instead elected as President of PAICV.

The PAICV won 21 out of 72 National Assembly seats in the December 1995 parliamentary election. At a PAICV congress in September 1997, Pires faced Jos√© Maria Neves in a leadership contest, and Pires was elected with 68% of the vote. Pires stepped down as PAICV President in 2000 in preparation for a presidential bid in the next year&#x27;s election and he was succeeded by Neves.

===2001 election===
In the presidential election held on 11 and 25 February 2001, PAICV candidate Pedro Pires, who won 46.52% of the vote in the first round, narrowly defeated the MpD&#x27;s Carlos Veiga by a margin of only 12 votes in the run-off.

===2006 election===
In the parliamentary election held on 22 January 2006, PAICV won 52.28% of the popular vote and 41 out of 72 seats in the National Assembly.

In the presidential election held on 12 February 2006, Pedro Pires again narrowly defeated Carlos Veiga, winning 50.98% of the vote.

===2011 election===
In the parliamentary election held on 7 February 2011, the PAICV led by Jose Maria Neves won 52.68% of the popular vote and 38 out of 72 seats in the National Assembly.

In the presidential election held on 7 and 21 August 2011, Manuel Inoc√™ncio Sousa lost to Jorge Carlos Fonseca (MpD) with 32.66% of the votes in the first round and 45.74% in the second round.

===2016 election===
PAICV lost 2016 presidential elections and president Jorge Carlos Fonseca was re-elected with very clear majority of the votes. PAICV even failed to forward a candidate. Before that PAICV had lost the 2016 parliamentary election. The main opposition party Movement for Democracy (MpD) won the parliamentary elections, taking back power after 15 years.

==Ideology and affiliation==
The PAICV describes itself as democratic socialist but began to trend towards social democracy in the 2010s. The party has been placed as left-wing on the political spectrum.

The party is a full member of the Socialist International.

<doc id="1094348" wikidata="Q184848" url="?curid=1094348" title="Index finger">
<text>The index finger (also referred to as forefinger, first finger, second finger, pointer finger, trigger finger, digitus secundus, digitus II, and ) is the second digit of a human hand. It is located between the thumb and the middle finger. It is usually the most dextrous and sensitive digit of the hand, though not the longest. It is shorter than the middle finger, and may be shorter or longer than the ring finger (see digit ratio).

== Anatomy ==
&quot;&quot; literally means &quot;pointing finger&quot;, from the same Latin source as &quot;;&quot; its anatomical names are &quot;index finger&quot; and &quot;second digit&quot;.

The index finger has three phalanges. It does not contain any muscles, but is controlled by muscles in the hand by attachments of tendons to the bones.

==Uses==

A lone index finger held vertically is often used to represent the number 1 (but finger counting differs across cultures), or when held up or moved side to side (finger-wagging), it can be an admonitory gesture. If held upward, it can also mean &quot;wait a minute&quot; or &quot;one moment&quot;. With the hand held palm out and the thumb and middle fingers touching, it represents the letter &quot;d&quot; in the American Sign Language alphabet.

===Pointing===
Pointing with the pointer finger may be used to indicate or identify an item, person, place or object.

Around age one, babies begin pointing to communicate relatively complex thoughts, including interest, desire, and information. Pointing in human babies can demonstrate the theory of mind, or ability to understand what other people are thinking. This gesture may form one basis for the development of human language. 

Non-human primates, lacking the ability to formulate ideas about what others are thinking, use pointing in much less complex ways. However, corvids, dogs and elephants do understand finger pointing.

In some cultures, particularly the Malays and Javanese in Southeast Asia, pointing using the index finger is considered rude, hence the thumb is used instead.

=== Index finger in Islam ===
In Islam raising the index finger signifies the Tawhƒ´d (ÿ™ŸéŸàŸíÿ≠ŸêŸäÿØ), which denotes the indivisible oneness of God. It is used to express the unity of God (&quot;there is no god but God&quot;).

In Arabic, the index or fore finger is called musabbi·∏•a (ŸÖŸèÿ≥Ÿéÿ®ŸêŸëÿ≠ÿ©), mostly used with the definite article: al-musabbi·∏•a (ÿßŸÑŸíŸÖŸèÿ≥Ÿéÿ®ŸêŸëÿ≠ÿ©). Sometimes also as-sabbƒÅ·∏•a (ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸéŸëÿ®Ÿëÿßÿ≠ÿ©) is used. The Arabic verb ÿ≥Ÿéÿ®ŸéŸëÿ≠Ÿé - which shares the same root as the Arabic word for index finger - means to praise or glorify God by saying: &quot;Sub·∏•ƒÅna AllƒÅh&quot; (ÿ≥Ÿèÿ®Ÿíÿ≠ÿßŸÜŸé ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá).

=== Index finger in archaeoastronomy ===
Before the advent of GPS and compass, early humans used index finger for pointing direction of objects with the help of stellar objects during night time.

==Gestures in art==

The index finger pointing up is a sign of teaching authority. This is shown in the depiction of Plato in the School of Athens by Raphael.

As a modern artistic convention, the index finger pointing at the viewer is in the form of a command or summons. Two famous examples of this are recruiting posters used during World War I by the United Kingdom and the United States.

<text>Oregon Route 224 is a state highway which runs through some of Portland&#x27;s southeastern suburbs and ends in the Cascades.

==Route description==
The northwestern terminus is an interchange with OR 99E in Milwaukie, a suburb of Portland. It continues east as the Milwaukie Expressway, but is formally part of the Clackamas Highway No. 171 (see Oregon highways and routes). After crossing Interstate 205 in Clackamas, it becomes the Sunrise Expressway for about two miles. Then, the highway continues east as a four-lane arterial, resuming its designation as the Clackamas Highway, and which it shares with OR 212. East of Clackamas, OR 224 splits off OR 212, and continues south as the Clackamas Highway, passing through hilly farmland. About eight miles (13¬†km) north of Estacada, it overlaps OR 211. On the eastern edge of Estacada, OR 224 separates from OR 211, and heads southeast into the Mount Hood National Forest, here you are in the mountains heading to the small community of Ripplebrook, its southeastern terminus, where state highway maintenance ends. Drivers may continue along the paved United States Forest Service Road 46 to OR 22 in Detroit, though snow makes the road impassable approximately early November through early May. USFS Road 46 was formerly signed as a portion of OR 224, but was never a state-maintained highway.

==History==

This is the second route in Oregon with the designation 224. There was an earlier version of OR 224 connecting US 99W (modern Oregon Route 99W) south of Monmouth to Oregon Route 223 near Lewisville following today&#x27;s Elkins Rd. In those days, Oregon Route 223 followed today&#x27;s Airlie Rd and Maple Grove Rd between Falls City and Pedee). This incarnation of OR 224 existed from the inception of the Oregon Route System in 1932 until sometime between 1942 and 1944.

The Clackamas Highway was realigned onto a section of I-205 in 1971.

The easternmost of OR 224 in Mount Hood National Forest was closed to traffic during the 2020 Labor Day wildfires, which damaged pavement, guardrails, and nearby trees. It is reopened to traffic on May 1, 2022, 19 months after its closure.

===Sunrise Expressway===
The Sunrise Expressway (known as Sunrise Corridor during construction) is a limited-access highway in Clackamas. It serves as an extension of the Milwaukie Expressway portion of OR¬†224. Planning for the expressway started in the 1980s. Plans weren&#x27;t approved until 2010, with construction starting in 2013. Costing $130 million, the expressway opened on July 1, 2016. A multi-use path for use by bicyclists and pedestrians was constructed along the highway. It is the newest highway constructed in the Portland metropolitan area since OR¬†213 bypassed Oregon City in 1989.

<doc id="1094350" wikidata="Q900304" url="?curid=1094350" title="Krafft temperature">
<text>In colloidal chemistry, the Krafft temperature (or Krafft point, after German chemist Friedrich Krafft) is defined as the minimum temperature at which the formation of micelles occurs in a solution of dissolved surfactant. It has been found that solubility at the Krafft point is nearly equal to critical micelle concentration (CMC). Below the Krafft temperature, the maximum solubility of the surfactant will be lower than the critical micelle concentration, meaning micelles will not form. The Krafft temperature is a point of phase change below which the surfactant remains in crystalline form, even in an aqueous solution. Visually the effect of going below the Krafft point is similar to that of going above the cloud point, with the solution becoming cloudy or opaque due to the surfactant molecules undergoing flocculation.

Surfactants in such a crystalline state will only solubilize and form micelles if another surfactant assists it in overcoming the forces that keep it crystallized, or if the temperature increases, thus causing entropy to increase and encouraging the crystalline structure to break apart.

==Structural effects==

Surfactants are usually composed of a hydrocarbon chain and a polar head group.

Increasing the length of the hydrocarbon chain increases the Krafft temperature because it improves Van der Waals forces.

Moreover, since Krafft point is related to solid-liquid transition, better-packed polar heads within surfactant crystals increase Krafft temperature.

<text>Brenchley is a village in the civil parish of Brenchley and Matfield, in the borough of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England.

All Saints Church is located in the village, and is a Grade I listed building.

==History==
The name is historically derived from Branca&#x27;s Leigh. The village is located east of Royal Tunbridge Wells, and south of Paddock Wood, and includes the neighbouring village of Matfield. Brenchley &amp; Matfield CoE primary school is located in Brenchley.

The village earns some historical fame by being one of the villages that was closely involved in post medieval iron making. The site of the furnace lies within the parish of Horsmonden now.

A Market formerly held in the churchyard at Brenchley was granted in 1230 to Hamo de Crevecoeur, to be held on his own land, and the day moved from Sunday to Wednesday. In 1233 this was readjusted to Saturday. By 1296 it belonged to Gilbert de Clare, who in 1312 claimed that his ancestors had held it &#x27;from time out of mind&#x27;.

<doc id="1094354" wikidata="Q6105064" url="?curid=1094354" title="J. C. Tolmie">
<text>Reverend Major James Craig Tolmie (October 8, 1862 ‚Äì May 15, 1938) was a Canadian politician, presbyterian clergyman, military chaplain and soldier.

He was born in Oxford County, Canada West as the son of another Presbyterian minister, Reverend Andrew Tolmie (1826‚Äì1907). His father had served in Oxford County at Innerkip Presbyterian Church and Ratho Church Blandford Township, since his graduation from Toronto&#x27;s Knox College in 1852. Shortly after James&#x27; birth, the family moved to the shores of Lake Huron at Southampton, where his father became minister of the Canada Presbyterian Congregations in Southampton (merged in 1864), Tara (to 1874), and West Arran/Burgoyne (to 1891), and served until his retirement in 1897, and death in 1907.

James C. Tolmie, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps, graduating from University of Toronto in Arts and Law in 1885, and Knox College in 1888. He worked at St. Andrew&#x27;s Church in London, Ontario, and was then ordained and inducted into First Presbyterian Church, Brantford in April 1889. In early 1894, he was called to Windsor, Ontario to the St. Andrew&#x27;s congregation, where he resigned early in 1915.

He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1914 as the Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Windsor. He resigned from the Pastorate at St. Andrew&#x27;s, and was appointed minister Emeritus.

During World War I, he also served as chaplain for the 99th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He was a candidate in the 1919 Ontario Liberal leadership convention, placing second, 37 votes behind Hartley Dewart on the second ballot. Tolmie ran for the leadership again in 1922, losing to Wellington Hay. He was defeated in June 1923, losing to the Conservative candidate Frank Worthington Wilson, and returned to Southampton, becoming involved in civic life in that community, and remained with the Presbyterian cause after Church Union in 1925, providing regular pulpit supply, and preaching at a number of Anniversary Services in the region. He was Reeve of Southampton at the time of his death, and had completed a three-year term on the Presbyterian Church&#x27;s Committee on Church History.

In nearby Port Elgin (amalgamated into Saugeen Shores, Ontario in 1999), there is a Tolmie Memorial Presbyterian Church, a &quot;minority group&quot; who did not join Port Elgin United Church in 1925 and named in memory of the Tolmie Family.

<text>Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park is a United States national historical park located in Richmond, California, near San Francisco. The park preserves and interprets the legacy of the United States home front during World War II, including the Kaiser Richmond Shipyards, the Victory ship SS &quot;Red Oak Victory&quot;, a tank factory, housing developments and other facilities built to support America&#x27;s entry into World War II. In particular, the role of women and African-Americans in war industries is explored and honored.

The park is a partnership park, meaning that no land or buildings are actually owned by the National Park Service, which only administers the park. The historical park was established in 2000, and bus tours began in 2007.

== Park attractions ==

A feasibility study was authorized under P.L. 105-355 (Sec.¬†505), sponsored by Rep. George Miller, to determine if the proposed park was suitable to be designated as a National Park Service affiliated site. The subsequent feasibility study concluded &quot;the collection of historic structures and sites in Richmond is nationally significant&quot; and recommended that a National Historic Park be established, citing multiple historic structures that remained intact including Atchison Village, the Maritime and Ruth C. Powers child development centers, Kaiser Permanente Hospital, Richmond Fire Station No. 67A, Richmond Shipyard #3, Ford Assembly Building, and Oil House. Subsequently, P.L. 106-352 established the Historical Park, granting the United States Secretary of the Interior power to establish cooperative agreements with the owners of the listed historic structures and nearby local parks, including the Shimada Peace Memorial Park, Westshore Park, Sheridan Observation Point Park, San Francisco Bay Trail, and Vincent Park.

The park&#x27;s visitor center is in the Oil House, a small auxiliary building next to the restored Ford Assembly Building, with a number of permanent and temporary exhibits about the history of Richmond&#x27;s wartime industries and workers. A film also illustrates the home-front battle. Rangers are available to answer questions, and also lead guided tours and conduct other interpretive programs.

A self-guided auto tour with optional walking tour is available for downloading. In the summer of 2007, preliminary bus tours began with a new guideless model, which instead filled half of the bus with residents who spoke of their experiences from the time to put what are otherwise everyday streets for residents into a greater historical perspective.

The Rosie the Riveter Memorial in Marina Bay Park is open year-round, dawn to dusk, as are the other Richmond city parks within the National Park&#x27;s boundaries.

=== Rosie Memorial ===

The park&#x27;s creation was spurred by the construction of a Rosie the Riveter memorial in Marina Bay Park along the city&#x27;s shoreline, formerly Kaiser Richmond Shipyard #2. The memorial was intended to honor the &quot;Rosies&quot;, women who made up much of the workforce at the shipyards, and started in 1997, three years prior to the creation of the national park. The effort behind the memorial was initiated by then-Councilwoman Donna Powers. It grew under Project Director Donna Graves to become the first national tribute to home front American women. A competition was held, selecting the final design in November 1998.

The four Richmond shipyards, with their combined 27 shipways, produced 747 ships, more than any other shipyard complex in the country. Richmond was home to the largest shipyard and 55 other war industries, more than any other city of its size in the United States. The city grew nearly overnight from 24,000 people to 100,000 people, overwhelming the available housing stock, roads, schools, businesses and community services.

The memorial was designed by landscape architect Cheryl Barton and visual artist Susan Schwartzenberg and dedicated on October 14, 2000, in a ceremony hosted by Donna Powers and attended by more than 100 &quot;Rosies&quot;. It is the length of the keel of a Liberty ship, representing the skeletal form of a ship under construction. A simple metal pier serves as the stern at the south end, on the water&#x27;s edge, proceeding north through a cylindrical framework as the smoke stack, and the bow as the main monument, made of prefabricated parts similar to those assembled by the shipyard workers. At the monument, there are 39 photographs, news clippings, and memorabilia. A timeline of World War II is presented in 25 panels laid along the &quot;Keel Walk&quot;, a walkway running the length of the memorial. Interpretive signs and exhibits within the structures present information on women&#x27;s history, labor history, and the home front.

=== Ford Richmond Plant ===
The Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant was the largest assembly plant to be built on the West Coast. One of only three tank depots in the entire country, approximately 49,000 jeeps were assembled and 91,000 other military vehicles were processed here. Ford employed thousands of workers at the site during World War II, many of them women who were entering the work force for the first time. &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; was a period song representing these women.

In mobilizing the wartime production effort to its full potential, Federal military authorities and private industry began to work closely together on a scale never seen before in American history. This laid the groundwork for what became known as the &quot;military-industrial complex&quot; during the Cold War years.

Noted architect Albert Kahn is credited with the design of the Ford plant in Richmond. After World War II, Ford moved its Northern California factory to Milpitas, which was known as the San Jose Assembly Plant; the building and site are now the Great Mall of the Bay Area.

The plant building has been restored and now houses a variety of private businesses along with the NPS visitor center.

=== Richmond Shipyards ===


The four Richmond Shipyards were part of the Kaiser Shipyards; construction started in early 1941 and the shipyards were completed by 1942. The construction of 747 ships during the war here is a feat not equaled anywhere else in the world, before or since. In 1997, the Richmond City Council began the effort to build the Rosie Memorial and passed Resolution , authorizing the submittal of Shipyard No. 3 for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places and as a California Historic Landmark. The park&#x27;s Rosie memorial is located on the former grounds of Shipyard No.2. Shipyard No.3 was listed on the NRHP in April 2000.

Both Liberty and Victory ships were constructed here. These ships were completed in two-thirds the amount of time and at a quarter of the cost of the average of all other shipyards. The SS &quot;Robert E. Peary&quot; was assembled in less than five days as a part of a special competition among shipyards; but by 1944 it was only taking the astonishingly brief time of a little over two weeks to assemble a Liberty ship by standard methods.

=== SS &quot;Red Oak Victory&quot; ===
The SS &quot;Red Oak Victory&quot; is a Victory ship preserved as a museum ship. It was one of 414 Victories built during World War II (constructed at the Richmond Shipyards), but one of only a few of these ships to be transferred from the Merchant Marine to the U.S. Navy. The vessel issued cargo and munitions to various ships in the fleet throughout 1945. During a hazardous tour of duty in the Pacific, SS &quot;Red Oak Victory&quot; handled many tons of ammunition, supplying the fleet without a single casualty.

=== Atchison Village Housing Project ===
The huge influx of workers coming to live in cities like Richmond, caused intense strain on city infrastructure. One of these strains was the severe lack of housing. Workers arriving in these rapidly expanding urban centers were forced to find what they could. They slept in all night movie houses, shared &quot;hot beds&quot; (i.e. when one person got in bed, it was still hot from the last person getting out), or just camped out.
Atchison Village Housing Project is an example of the local-Federal collaboration that provided much needed housing and domestic support for defense workers and their families. The modest, wood-frame buildings clearly reflect the constraints (time, money and materials) placed on publicly funded housing construction during the period. Just prior to and during the war, the Lanham Act of 1940 provided $150 million to the Works Progress Administration, which built approximately 625,000 units of housing in conjunction with local authorities nationwide. These were highly sought after and company managers were the most likely to be able to procure housing in Atchison Village.

Due to racial discrimination, minorities fared very poorly in gaining housing. They often lived in shacks, in the crates that brought the raw materials to the city, in trailers, or in automobiles. They and other lower income earning workers were lucky when they were able to move to barrack-like dormitories constructed for the mass of World War II workers.

The Richmond Housing Authority was selected to be the first authority in the country to manage a defense project. Atchison Village represents one of 20 public housing projects built in Richmond before and during World War II. Constructed in 1941 as Richmond&#x27;s first public defense housing project, it is the only project funded by the Lanham Act that still exists in Richmond, and one of the few in the nation not destroyed after the war.

Today, Atchison Village is a collection of privately owned houses managed by a cooperative of the homeowners. While most of the dormitories and other low income housing of World War II are gone, Atchison Village, built as permanent housing, remains.

=== Kaiser Richmond Field Hospital ===
Prior to the invasion of Europe in June 1944, more Americans were dying in Home Front accidents than on World War II battlefields. Henry J. Kaiser, founder of the Richmond Shipyards, recognized that only a healthy work force could meet his deadlines and construction needs. He institutionalized a revolutionary idea, pre-paid medical care for workers, which soon expanded beyond workers. For many workers, this was the first time they had seen a doctor.

The Kaiser Richmond Field Hospital for the Richmond Shipyards was financed by the U.S. Maritime Commission, and opened on August 10, 1942.

By August 1944, 92.2 percent of all Richmond shipyard employees had joined the plan, the first voluntary group plan in the country to feature group medical practice, prepayment and substantial medical facilities on such a large scale. By 1990, Kaiser Permanente was still the country&#x27;s largest nonprofit HMO.

In part due to wartime materials rationing, the Field Hospital is a single-story wood-frame structure designed in a simple modernist mode. The Field Hospital operated as a Kaiser Permanente hospital until closing in 1995, after a new hospital was built downtown.

=== Maritime and Ruth Powers Child Development Centers ===

The Maritime and Ruth Powers Child Development Centers were two of approximately 35 nursery school units of varying sizes established in the Richmond area during World War II in order to provide child care for women working in the Kaiser shipyards. The Maritime center was funded and constructed by the Maritime Commission as part of a larger development that also included housing, an elementary school and a fire station. The temporary housing was demolished after the war but a larger permanent housing complex remains as do the other buildings.

The Maritime Child Development Center, a wood frame, modernist style building operated by the Richmond School District, incorporated progressive educational programming, and was staffed with nutritionists, psychiatrists and certified teachers. It had a capacity of 180 children per day. At its peak, with 24,500 women on the Kaiser payroll, Richmond&#x27;s citywide child care program maintained a total daily attendance of 1,400 children. Unlike the federally funded WPA day care facilities implemented during the New Deal, the World War II centers were not intended for use by the destitute, but for working mothers.

The Kaiser-sponsored Child Care Centers, particularly those at Kaiser&#x27;s industrial sites in Vanport, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, gained a reputation for innovative and high quality child care. The center is still in operation today.

=== Lucretia Edwards Shoreline Park ===
Lucretia Edwards Shoreline Park, named in honor of local community activist Lucretia W. Edwards, honors the wartime contributions made by the Bay Area Shipyards during World War II.

In addition to the local Richmond Shipyards, shipworker&#x27;s bootprints with plaques set in the sidewalks and long low seating walls point visitors to the other Bay Area shipyards.

The following inscriptions are engraved into the concrete walls:
* Bethlehem San Francisco ‚Äì The only privately owned shipyard in the nation to operate a submarine repair base, this 16th Street yard overhauled 31 subs in two years.
* Moore Dry Dock handled the difficult jobs of production, repair and conversion that slowed overall output in other yards.
* Hunters Point Naval Dry Dock ‚Äì Hunters Point repaired 600 fighting and support ships.
* Mare Island Naval Shipyard ‚Äì Mare Island built more than 400 vessels. Mare Island Naval Shipyard set a shipbuilding record for a destroyer that was never broken completing the USS &quot;Ward&quot; in just 17 days.
* Marinship ‚Äì The 75,000 Americans who poured into Marinship during the war years build 93 ships.

=== Nystrom Elementary School ===
The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 added Nystrom Elementary School of the West Contra Costa Unified School District to the park. The building was built to accommodate families who moved to Richmond to work at the Kaiser Shipyards.

<doc id="1094360" wikidata="Q590944" url="?curid=1094360" title="1991 World Series">
<text>The 1991 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1991 season. The 88th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Minnesota Twins (95‚Äì67) and the National League (NL) champion Atlanta Braves (94‚Äì68). The Twins defeated the Braves four games to three to win the championship, their second in Minnesota and third overall. The series was unique because of the standings of the two participating teams in the previous season: both finished the 1990 season in last place; before 1991, no league champion had ever finished the previous season in last place.

A number of outlets regard the 1991 World Series as one of the greatest ever. In 2003, ESPN selected this championship as the &quot;Greatest of All Time&quot; in their &quot;World Series 100th Anniversary&quot; countdown, with five of its games decided by a single run, four decided in the final at-bat and three going into extra innings. In addition to the suspense of the outcome of many of its games, the Series had other highlights. For example, the series-deciding seventh game was a scoreless tie (0‚Äì0) through the regular nine innings, and went into extra innings; Minnesota won 1‚Äì0 in the 10th inning, with their starting pitcher, Jack Morris, pitching a complete game. Morris was named the MVP for the series. 

With 69 innings in total, the 1991 World Series shares the record for longest seven-game World Series in terms of innings that had been set with the 1924 World Series which, coincidentally, featured the Twins&#x27; predecessor, the Senators (the 1912 World Series, which saw one game tied due to darkness, logged the most innings ever, at 75).

To date, this is Minnesota‚Äôs last World Series win and appearance, and this remains the last appearance by a team from the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area in a championship round of the four major North American men&#x27;s sports leagues.

==Background==
===Minnesota Twins===
Three years after their 1987 World Series championship, the Minnesota Twins went 74‚Äì88 in 1990 to finish last in the American League West (29 games behind the Oakland Athletics, the eventual World Series runner-up) for the first time since 1982. However, in 1991, thanks to breakout seasons from pitchers such as Scott Erickson and Kevin Tapani and a Rookie of the Year-winning performance from second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, along with a strong season by newly acquired free agent and future Hall of Famer Jack Morris, the Twins won their division by eight games over the Chicago White Sox. They defeated the Toronto Blue Jays in five games in the American League Championship Series to advance to the Fall Classic. Kirby Puckett batted .429 with two home runs and five RBI to win the ALCS MVP award.

===Atlanta Braves===
Following a late-season collapse in 1983, the Atlanta Braves had a string of seven consecutive losing seasons and finished last in the National League West three times in a row from 1988 to 1990. Bobby Cox returned to the Atlanta Braves&#x27; dugout as manager in the middle of the 1990 season, replacing Russ Nixon. The Braves would finish the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65‚Äì97, and traded Dale Murphy to the Philadelphia Phillies after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player. Pitching coach Leo Mazzone began developing young pitchers Tom Glavine, Steve Avery, and John Smoltz into future stars.

In 1991, after having a 39‚Äì40 record at the All-Star break, the Braves surged in the second half to win the division title on the penultimate day of the season. The Braves won 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months of the season and edging the Los Angeles Dodgers by a single game. Aided by position players David Justice, Ron Gant, unexpected MVP third baseman Terry Pendleton and Cy Young Award winner Tom Glavine, 1991 was the franchise&#x27;s best season since 1957. They defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games in the National League Championship Series to win their first National League pennant since 1958. Avery was named the NLCS MVP after pitching two scoreless starts with 17 strikeouts in innings.

==Summary==
The 1991 World Series was notable for several grueling contests, with five of its games decided by one run (three of which in extra innings; including the third game, a 12-inning marathon that saw Twins manager Tom Kelly run out of hitters).

==Matchups==

===Game 1===
The ceremonial first pitch of the series was thrown by retired AL umpire Steve Palermo, who had been forced into early retirement when he was seriously injured by gunshot while coming to the aid of a robbery victim in Dallas on July 7, 1991. After the pitch, the Twins&#x27; Al Newman returned the ball to Palermo and the series umpires jogged to the mound to exchange well wishes.

The Twins started their ace, Minnesota native Jack Morris. In his first season with his hometown team, the future Hall of Famer won 18 games, recorded a 3.43 ERA (16th best in the American League), and pitched ten complete games. He was also one of the few starting pitchers in the series on either side with prior experience; seven years earlier, as the ace of the Detroit Tigers, Morris won two games in the 1984 World Series and helped lead Detroit to its most recent world championship. He also had recorded two victories in the ALCS over the Toronto Blue Jays.

The Braves countered with Charlie Leibrandt, the only Brave pitcher with Series exposure. Before joining the Braves in 1990, Leibrandt was a member of the Kansas City Royals for six seasons and had won 17 games for their 1985 World Series champion squad. Thus he was also the only Braves starter who had previously faced several members of the Twins lineup, including Dan Gladden, Kirby Puckett, and Kent Hrbek. In 1991, Leibrandt was 15‚Äì13 with a 3.49 ERA. His win total was third on the team behind Tom Glavine and Steve Avery. In the NLCS against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Leibrandt pitched in Game 5 and recorded a no-decision.

Minnesota scored first in the bottom of the third. With two out, leadoff hitter Dan Gladden walked and then stole second. Rookie second baseman Chuck Knoblauch then singled to drive him in, but was caught in a rundown in between first and second and tagged out to end the inning. Manager Tom Kelly later said that he wanted Knoblauch to take the turn around first to draw the throw away from the plate and allow the run to score. The Twins added three more runs in the fifth, as Kent Hrbek led off with a double, Scott Leius singled and shortstop Greg Gagne hit a three-run shot. Leibrandt was pulled from the game after the home run, and reliever Jim Clancy promptly allowed Gladden and Knoblauch to reach base on an error and a walk. Gladden reached third on a fly ball by Kirby Puckett for the first out, and after Knoblauch stole second Chili Davis was put on intentionally. Twins catcher Brian Harper then lifted a fly ball to left field that was caught for the second out. Gladden tagged again and tried to score, running over Atlanta catcher Greg Olson in the process, but Olson held onto the ball for the third out even though Gladden flipped him so hard that he momentarily stood on his head.

The Braves broke through against Morris in the top of the sixth, as Jeff Treadway and David Justice reached base with two out. Ron Gant then followed with a single that Gladden misplayed, which scored Treadway and left runners at second and third. Morris got out of the jam by striking out Sid Bream to end the inning, and the Twins added an insurance run in the bottom of the inning as Hrbek homered off Clancy.

After walking the first two batters to lead off the eighth, Morris was pulled from the game in favor of Mark Guthrie, who induced a double play off the bat of Terry Pendleton. After Guthrie walked Justice, Twins closer Rick Aguilera came into the game and gave up a hit to Gant. The hit drove in Lonnie Smith from third base, and the run was charged to Morris. It was the last run scored, as the Twins won 5‚Äì2 with Aguilera picking up the four-out save.

Morris&#x27;s win was his third World Series win in as many starts, as he won Games 1 and 4 of the 1984 Series. Leibrandt&#x27;s poor performance resulted in his being removed from the rotation, although he did pitch in Game¬†6, facing just one batter and giving up the game-winning home run to Puckett.

During the game, a Hrbek pop foul hit Commissioner Fay Vincent&#x27;s daughter Anne in the head.

===Game 2===
The pitching matchup featured 1991 National League Cy Young Award winner Tom Glavine against the Twins&#x27; 16-game winner and number two starter, Kevin Tapani. Tapani had the lowest ERA of the Twins&#x27; rotation, 2.99, while Glavine led the Braves in wins with 20. In their respective League Championship Series, Tapani had not pitched particularly well having lost Game 2 and giving up five early runs in Game 5. Glavine lost his NLCS starts in Games 1 and 5, giving up a total of six runs.

Leading off the bottom of the first, Gladden lifted a seemingly routine pop-up toward second base. Atlanta fielders Justice and Mark Lemke miscommunicated and collided, and the ball fell from Lemke&#x27;s glove. Gladden reached second on a two-base error. After walking Knoblauch, Glavine induced Puckett to ground to third, where Pendleton stepped on the bag to retire Gladden and threw across to Sid Bream to retire Puckett for the double play. But the next batter, Davis, homered off Glavine and gave the Twins an early 2‚Äì0 lead.

The Braves got a run back in the top of the second when Justice singled, was doubled to third by Bream, and then scored on a sacrifice fly by Brian Hunter. Controversy occurred the next inning when Lonnie Smith reached first on an error by Scott Leius. With two outs, Gant ripped a single to left. Smith, playing for a record fourth team in World Series play, tried to beat the throw to third from Gladden, which was wild and missed third baseman Leius.

The play was not over, however, as Gant was hung up between first and second as he tried to advance on the errant throw. Tapani, backing up the play, fielded the ball and threw back toward first. Gant tried to get back standing up, but Hrbek fielded the ball just before he got to the base and moved to tag Gant out. Somehow, Hrbek&#x27;s arm and Gant&#x27;s leg got tangled and the two players stumbled backward. First base umpire Drew Coble called Gant out on the play, a furious Gant and first base coach Pat Corrales argued, and CBS analyst Tim McCarver agreed, that Hrbek had pulled Gant off of the base. Hrbek claimed after the game that Gant had pushed him, and Gant later said that Hrbek had grabbed his leg and fell backward, taking him with him. Coble would later explain his reasoning behind the call for MLB&#x27;s official video recap of the series. He said that when Gant had come back toward first, he had come in off-balance and was falling over as Hrbek applied the tag; Coble said that based on that, he determined that Gant&#x27;s own momentum had caused him to leave the base and called him out after Hrbek kept the tag on him. Tom Kelly said that Gant would not have had a problem if he had slid into the bag. This call was ranked as one of the top ten worst baseball calls by both ESPN and Sports Illustrated. Hrbek became a hated figure in Atlanta, was lustily booed, and even received a death threat. In 2011, the Twins celebrated the 20th anniversary of the controversial play by commissioning a bobblehead doll of Hrbek and Gant entangled, a promotion that proved popular with Twins fans.

The Braves tied the game in the fifth when Olson doubled, advanced to third on a groundout by Lemke, and came home on a sacrifice fly by Rafael Belliard. The game stayed tied into the eighth. In the top half, Belliard got a leadoff hit on a bunt single, and after a sacrifice, Pendleton beat out an infield hit. But Tapani got Gant out on a foul popup and Justice on a fly out to end the threat. Kelly remembered seeing a tape of the game that showed Glavine in disbelief that Atlanta was unable to score, and felt that Glavine&#x27;s emotions took over. Immediately in the bottom half, the unheralded Leius drilled Glavine&#x27;s first pitch into the left-field seats for what proved to be the game-winning home run.

Both starting pitchers stayed in the game through eight innings and were quite effective, giving up just five runs combined (three earned). Rick Aguilera earned the save for the Twins, and the Series headed to Atlanta with the Twins leading two games to none.

===Game 3===
In what is considered one of the greatest World Series games ever played, the Braves outlasted the Twins in a thrilling 12-inning battle in the first World Series game played in the Deep South. This game matched Minnesota&#x27;s 20-game winner Scott Erickson against Atlanta&#x27;s late-season hero Steve Avery. In the NLCS, Avery had not allowed a run to the Pirates in innings of work, winning Game 2 and Game 6 and garnering series MVP honors. Erickson made one start in the ALCS, taking a no decision in Game 3.

Going into the three games in Atlanta, Twins manager Tom Kelly said that managing without the designated-hitter rule was &quot;right up there with rocket science&quot;.

In a play reminiscent of Game¬†2, Dan Gladden led off the game by reaching on a fielding mistake. He lifted a fly ball toward right-center field where David Justice and Ron Gant both went to catch it, but neither called for the ball and it dropped between them. Gladden reached third standing up, and Chuck Knoblauch subsequently flied out to allow him to score the first run of the game and end Avery&#x27;s scoreless innings streak.

The Braves got the run back in the second when Greg Olson scored on Rafael Belliard&#x27;s single. Justice led off the fourth with his first World Series home run, and the Braves led for the first time in the Series, 2‚Äì1. In the fifth, the Braves scored again when Lonnie Smith homered. Erickson was pulled from the game after allowing Terry Pendleton and Justice to reach base, on a walk and an error by Knoblauch on a ground ball that should have ended the inning. David West entered the game and walked two consecutive batters, forcing home an unearned run (charged to Erickson) and leaving the bases loaded for Terry Leach, who struck out Mark Lemke to end the inning. With the score 4‚Äì1, the Braves looked to close it out. As it turned out, the game was just beginning.

After the run that resulted from the first-inning misplay between Gant and Justice, Avery had been perfect for five innings, recording 15 consecutive outs. But then he seemed to tire a bit. Kirby Puckett homered in the seventh to make it 4‚Äì2, one inning after two Twins hits and two other fly outs to the warning track. Atlanta manager Bobby Cox reluctantly sent Avery out for the eighth inning. The first batter he faced was Brian Harper, pinch hitting for his replacement catcher Junior Ortiz (Harper never started games that season when Erickson pitched, as he preferred to pitch to Ortiz). After he reached on an error Avery went to the showers in favor of the Braves&#x27; regular-season closer, Alejandro Pe√±a. Pe√±a had been 13 for 13 in save opportunities since joining the Braves in a late-season trade with the Mets, but he had not pitched since the previous Wednesday. Chili Davis, pinch hitting for pitcher Steve Bedrosian, took advantage of this and hit a home run to tie the game.

The game remained tied into extra innings, and a series of substitutions and double switches turned the game on its ear. Kelly exhausted the remaining players on his bench by the eleventh inning, and entering the twelfth he was down to only three remaining players, all pitchers. Of those three, Rick Aguilera was the only one who was available to play; the other two were his other two starters, Jack Morris and Kevin Tapani. 

The top of the twelfth began with Mark Wohlers on the mound for the Braves. After he retired Randy Bush on a fly out, Gladden reached on a single. Knoblauch followed with a ground ball to second that would likely have resulted in a double play, but Lemke misplayed it and it rolled between his legs. Gladden was able to advance to third on the error, and with the go-ahead run in scoring position, Braves manager Bobby Cox brought in Kent Mercker to pitch.

While all of this was going on, Aguilera was warming up in the Twins‚Äô bullpen. On the CBS television broadcast, Tim McCarver noted that the pitcher‚Äôs spot was due in two batters. Kent Hrbek was the batter, and McCarver theorized that if Mercker retired Hrbek, Cox would elect to walk the on deck hitter, Kirby Puckett, if Knoblauch and Gladden were still on base, and force Kelly to decide to use Aguilera as a pinch hitter for pitcher Mark Guthrie.

On the fourth pitch of the at bat, with Knoblauch running to avoid a potential double play, Hrbek struck out looking. Cox brought in Jim Clancy to pitch to Puckett and, just as McCarver had thought, put him on intentionally to load the bases. With his hand forced, Kelly summoned Aguilera from the bullpen to pinch hit. Aguilera had some previous success as a hitter, and had in fact come up as an infielder, but he had not had any at bats since he played with the New York Mets in 1989. On the third pitch of the at-bat he flied out to deep center field, leaving the bases loaded and the game deadlocked. Kelly said in an interview that if the game had gone on beyond two more innings‚ÄîAguilera‚Äôs usual limit‚Äîsince he had used up all his relief pitchers and needed to avoid tiring Aguilera out or throwing his rotation into disarray by using one of his starters in relief, his next step would likely have been to put left fielder Gladden (who had previously made emergency pitching appearances on at least two occasions) on the mound and Aguilera in the outfield.

In the bottom of the 12th, Aguilera remained in the game to pitch and quickly got the first out on one pitch. But then Justice singled to right and after Brian Hunter popped out, Justice stole second on an 0‚Äì2 pitch to Olson. With two outs and first base open and the normally light-hitting Lemke on deck, Aguilera, wary of Olson&#x27;s stealth status as one of the Braves&#x27; best clutch hitters (despite an overall average of only .241, he had batted .373 with two outs and runners in scoring position during the season), pitched him very carefully after the stolen base and walked him. Lemke (who had nearly caused a major Twins rally with his fielding error in the top of the inning) now entered the pantheon of World Series heroes by hitting a single to left that enabled Justice to just beat the throw home from Gladden. His score gave the Braves a 5‚Äì4 win and cut the Twins&#x27; lead in the Series to two games to one. Clancy took the win while Aguilera received the loss.

The game lasted a then record four hours, four minutes, broken in 2005 in Game¬†3 of the 2005 World Series, which ran five hours, 41 minutes. It was the first of four games in this Series to end with the winning team scoring the deciding run in the ninth inning or later. It was also the first World Series game played in Georgia.

===Game 4===
Game¬†4 matched up Jack Morris against Atlanta starter John Smoltz, a former Detroit prospect and Michigan native who idolized Morris as a youngster when he was pitching for the Tigers. Morris was looking to record his second victory of the series while Smoltz was making his first start. Smoltz had won both of his starts against the Pirates in the NLCS, including in the seventh and deciding game in Pittsburgh where he pitched a complete game shutout.

As was the custom in the first three games, the Twins scored first. In the second inning, Brian Harper scored on Mike Pagliarulo&#x27;s double. The Braves tied it in the third when Terry Pendleton hit his first postseason home run.

The Braves appeared ready to take a lead in the fifth when Lonnie Smith singled and stole second. Pendleton then followed with a deep fly ball to center field. As Kirby Puckett went back to field it, Smith watched from approximately halfway down the baseline to see where the ball was going to land. Puckett got under the ball and Smith went back to tag up, since the fly ball was deep enough for him to advance to third if Puckett caught it.

As Puckett reached up to try and catch the ball, it nicked the top of his glove and dropped behind him. Since Smith had gone to tag up instead of staying where he had been, he now had to start running from a dead stop and was unable to gain much momentum as the relay throw reached the infield. Smith was waved around third anyway, with the relay reaching Harper on the bounce just before Smith got to the plate. Smith‚Äôs only recourse was to try to dislodge the ball from Harper, doing so by throwing himself at Harper and bowling him over. Despite the violent collision, Harper held onto the ball and Smith was out.

With Pendleton on third now and Morris having walked Ron Gant, David Justice stood in. Morris threw a pitch that got past Harper, but he was able to recover and tag Pendleton out as he tried to score. The game remained tied through the sixth.

In the top of the seventh, Pagliarulo homered to give the Twins the lead, 2‚Äì1. With a lead and a bullpen that had allowed only one earned run in the entire post-season, the Twins opted to go for more runs by pinch hitting for Morris and removing him after six innings. He had been effective, allowing only the one run, but had a high pitch count. The move backfired as Braves got the run back in the bottom of the inning when Smith made up for his baserunning gaffe and homered off Twins reliever Carl Willis to tie the game.

The game entered the bottom of the ninth still tied at two. With one out and Mark Guthrie pitching, Mark Lemke drilled a triple off the left-center field wall. Jeff Blauser was walked intentionally to set up a possible double play to force extra innings.

With the pitchers‚Äô spot due up after Blauser, Bobby Cox sent Francisco Cabrera to the on-deck circle. Once Blauser was given his intentional walk, Tom Kelly brought in former Brave Steve Bedrosian to pitch. Cabrera, who had been announced as the next batter, was called back to the dugout and veteran minor leaguer Jerry Willard was sent in to pinch hit. Willard hit a short fly ball to Shane Mack in right field. Lemke tagged and broke for the plate as soon as Mack caught the ball. Mack‚Äôs throw beat Lemke to the plate, but he slid around Harper‚Äôs tag attempt and home plate umpire Terry Tata called him safe despite the objections of both Harper and Bedrosian.

Tim McCarver explained on the CBS broadcast the specific reason Lemke was called safe. Since the play at the plate was not a force play, Harper needed to tag Lemke with the ball, whether it was in his hand or in his glove. While Harper did have the ball in his possession and had made contact with Lemke, he did not do so with his catcher‚Äôs mitt‚Äîthe contact was up his arm near the elbow and thus, Tata ruled that he had missed the tag. It was not uncommon at the time for umpires to call a runner out when the ball beat them to the plate, regardless of the time or location of the tag, but Tata held to the letter of the law. McCarver later narrated the play as &quot;An arm&#x27;s length; an elbows width: the subtle difference between out...and safe.&quot; The win tied the Series at two games apiece and ensured a return to Minnesota.

===Game 5===
In Game¬†5, Tom Glavine faced Kevin Tapani in a Game¬†2 rematch. Unlike the previous game, neither pitcher had his best stuff this time around, with Tapani falling apart in the 4th and Glavine in the 6th. Whereas in their first matchup the game was relatively close, Game 5 would be the biggest offensive outburst of the series for either team. But despite the score, the game was kept close until after the 7th inning stretch.

For three innings, the pitchers matched zeroes. In the fourth, Ron Gant singled to left and David Justice homered off the top of the left-field wall for a 2‚Äì0 Braves lead. Sid Bream followed up with a walk, and Greg Olson then hit what appeared to be a double play grounder to second. But the ball hit Bream&#x27;s leg, resulting in Bream being called out for runner interference and Olson safe at first. Mark Lemke, the hero of Games 3 and 4, drilled a triple that scored Olson, and then scored on a double by Rafael Belliard At this point, the Braves led 4‚Äì0, their biggest lead in any game in the Series.

In the fifth, Terry Pendleton and Gant singled, with Pendleton moving to third. Then Justice hit into a fielder&#x27;s choice that scored Pendleton and gave the Braves a 5‚Äì0 lead. With Glavine working on a two-hitter, the game seemed in hand for the Braves. But Glavine&#x27;s control deserted him in the sixth inning and he was pulled from the game. Chuck Knoblauch reached on a one-out walk and then went to third on a single by Kirby Puckett. A walk to Chili Davis loaded the bases, and Glavine suddenly had difficulty finding the strike zone. He gave up two runs on bases-loaded walks to Brian Harper and Scott Leius. Kent Mercker came on to get out of the jam and got the last two outs with one additional run scoring. The game entered the seventh with the Braves leading 5‚Äì3.

Minnesota sent David West out to begin the bottom of the seventh. West had failed to retire a batter in Game¬†3, facing two batters and giving up two walks (while one of these walks did force a run home, this run was an unearned run charged to starter Scott Erickson). Lonnie Smith hit his third home run in three nights to give the Braves a 6‚Äì3 lead. And then the floodgates opened. Pendleton and Gant walked, Justice singled to score Pendleton, and West was again taken out without retiring a batter; in this game, he was charged with four earned runs without retiring a batter, for an infinite ERA (West retired his first World Series hitter in the 1993 World Series with the Philadelphia Phillies). Brian Hunter singled to score Gant and put two on with nobody out and an 8‚Äì3 Braves lead. After Olson popped out, Lemke hit his third triple in his last four at bats, driving home Justice and Hunter, and scoring when Belliard singled to center. The Braves ended the seventh with an 11‚Äì3 lead and the announcers began talking about the teams&#x27; chances in Game¬†6.

But there were still two innings left. Davis, playing this game in right field in place of Mack, who was 0‚Äìfor‚Äì15, singled. He moved to second on a ground out and scored on Al Newman&#x27;s triple. In the bottom of the eighth, Pendleton doubled and Gant tripled, scoring Pendleton. Justice grounded out to the pitcher, scoring Gant, and Hunter then ended the Braves&#x27; offensive barrage with a home run.

Both managers emptied their benches to give playing time to non-starters. Randy St. Claire gave up a run when Gladden tripled (the fifth triple of the game) and scored on a fielder&#x27;s choice by Junior Ortiz, but the game ended in a 14‚Äì5 Braves rout, the Series&#x27; only lopsided game. The Braves scored just under half their total runs for the series in these eight innings. They now had their first lead in Series games, three to two. The marquee wall at Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium read &quot;Three at home and one at the Dome.&quot; The Washington/Minnesota franchise had now lost 14 straight World Series road games dating to 1925, a streak that remains active as the Twins have not advanced to a World Series since 1991.

===Game 6===
The Twins returned to the Metrodome, where they had a 9‚Äì1 postseason record (including 6‚Äì0 in the World Series). After the reshuffling of the Braves&#x27; rotation following Game¬†1, Steve Avery started for Atlanta on three days&#x27; rest. The Twins kept their three-man rotation, with Scott Erickson, who had been batted around in Game¬†3, getting the start for Minnesota.

In the top of the first, the Braves got two runners on, but stranded them. In the bottom of the first, Chuck Knoblauch singled with one out and then Kirby Puckett strode to the plate looking to break out of the slump he had been in for most of the series. He tripled to left field, scoring Knoblauch, his first big play of the game.

After retiring Chili Davis for the second out of the inning, Avery faced another slump-ridden batter in Shane Mack, who was hitless so far in the series. Mack hit a broken-bat single to score Puckett. Scott Leius followed with a single, advancing Mack to third, but Avery escaped further damage by retiring Kent Hrbek to keep the game at 2-0.

In the top of the third, the Braves hit Erickson hard, but failed to score. After Terry Pendleton reached with one out, Ron Gant drove a pitch deep to left field. Puckett, giving chase, tracked the ball down and then leaped to snare it before it could hit the 13-foot Plexiglas barrier over the left field wall. Pendleton, who had reached second and was trying to advance to third, was forced to turn around and barely beat Puckett‚Äôs throw back to first.

In the fourth, the Twins appeared ready to increase their lead, putting runners at second and third with one out. But Avery buckled down and retired the side to keep the game close. Another critical play occurred in the fifth when Rafael Belliard kept the Twins from completing a double play with a fierce slide. His hustle enabled Lonnie Smith to reach first. This became important when Pendleton golfed Erickson&#x27;s next pitch into the seats, his second World Series home run, to tie the game at two. With two outs, Justice lifted what appeared to be a go-ahead home run for the Braves to right, but at the last instant, the ball hooked foul by about two feet. Erickson retired Justice and the Twins came to bat with the score tied.

Dan Gladden responded with a walk and a steal of second. He moved to third on Knoblauch&#x27;s lineout to right and scored on Puckett&#x27;s center field sacrifice fly. The Twins led 3‚Äì2. Avery was relieved after the inning. The Twins kept their one-run lead into the seventh. Mark Lemke singled to center, knocking Erickson out of the game, and went to second on a wild pitch by reliever Mark Guthrie. After a strikeout, Smith walked and Pendleton reached on an infield single. The Braves now had the bases loaded and one out as CBS commentator Jack Buck said the Series was now on the line. Gant hit what seemed to be a sure double play ground ball off Carl Willis. The ground ball retired Pendleton, but the speedy Gant beat the relay to first and Lemke scored the tying run, charged to Erickson. Willis got out of the jam by striking out Justice to end the inning with the score tied at three. Willis was charged with a blown save, but he pitched two more scoreless innings, the eighth and ninth. Atlanta kept the Twins off the scoreboard, with left-handed specialist Mike Stanton pitching the seventh and eighth innings and struggling closer Alejandro Pe√±a pitching the ninth and tenth innings.

The game remained tied at three until the 11th. Bobby Cox sent Game 1 starter Charlie Leibrandt in a highly unfamiliar role ‚Äì as a reliever late in the extra-inning game, and very late at night to the mound to face Puckett. Cox endured some criticism for the move because the Braves still had several relievers at their disposal including left-hander Kent Mercker and right-handers Jim Clancy and Mark Wohlers, but the move made sense on another level, because Leibrandt was the only pitcher left on their roster who had previous World Series experience, and although Leibrandt had been subpar in his Game 1 start, the three hitters scheduled to bat for the Twins in the 11th had been a combined 0 for 6 against Leibrandt in that game, including two strikeouts of Puckett.

Puckett recalled telling Davis that he planned to bunt for a base hit, to which Davis responded, &quot;Bunt my ass. Hit it out and let&#x27;s go home!&quot; Puckett replied that he would take a few pitches first‚Äîa rare move for him, as he was known as a free swinger who often went after the first pitch. After uncharacteristically taking change-up for a strike and two balls (a similar high and outside fastball and then another fastball for ball two) from Leibrandt, Puckett launched the next pitch into the left-center-field seats for a dramatic game-winning home run that tied the Series at three games apiece. Only after he saw first base coach Wayne Terwilliger throw up his hands in victory did Puckett realize he had hit a home run. Buck famously called the home run with the line &quot;And we&#x27;ll see you tomorrow night!&quot;

Puckett&#x27;s home run forced the first Game¬†7 since the 1987 World Series, which was also played at the Metrodome. With his walk-off home run, he completed the game a double shy of hitting for the cycle. The home run was also Puckett&#x27;s only walk-off home run of his career.

This dramatic game has been widely remembered as the high point in Puckett&#x27;s career. The images of Puckett rounding the bases, arms raised in triumph, are frequently included in video highlights of his career. This moment is captured in a statue of Puckett just outside Gate 34 at the Twins&#x27; new home, Target Field. The statue is of Puckett rounding second base, pumping his fists after hitting the dramatic walk-off home run. 

After Game 6, the Twins replaced the blue seat back and bottom as well as Puckett&#x27;s #34 on the seat, where the walk-off home run ball was caught with a gold-colored set. It remained until the final Minnesota Vikings game of 2013 in the Metrodome when, as local media reported, a fan took the #34 plate off the seat. Both of these sets remain in the Twins&#x27; archives. The original home run seat armrests and hardware, as well as the replacement blue seat back and bottom, are now in a private collection of Puckett memorabilia in Minnesota after the Metrodome was torn down.

Aguilera took the decision for the Twins after pitching the 10th and 11th innings, while Leibrandt earned his second loss of the series. He took it hard. Normally known as one of the friendliest and most cordial Braves, a despondent Leibrandt refused to answer questions from reporters after the game. He also lost Game 6 of the 1992 World Series by allowing an extra-base hit to the Blue Jays&#x27; (coincidentally Minnesota native) Dave Winfield for the eventual game- and series-winning runs, but was significantly more philosophical about that misfortune, saying, &quot;I was devastated last year. I&#x27;m down right now, but I&#x27;ll get over it.&quot;

The following box score is of Game 6.

===Game 7===
Game¬†7 saw a rematch of the Game¬†4 starters. Jack Morris returned to the mound for his third start of the Series while John Smoltz made his second for the Braves. Going into the game, this Series had been regarded as one of the greatest ever. Game 7 reinforced that point. A symbolic moment for this Series occurred on the first at-bat when Braves leadoff hitter Lonnie Smith shook hands with Twins catcher Brian Harper just before stepping up to the plate. This was seen as a gesture of the respect the teams had for each other, though Morris later admitted that in the competitive heat of the moment he had not been happy with his catcher about it, even though Smith extended his hand initially.

The Twins were the first team to get a runner in scoring position, as singles by Brian Harper and Shane Mack with two out set Mike Pagliarulo up with a chance to drive in a run. Smoltz got him to ground out, however, and nothing came of the opportunity. The Braves were then able to get two baserunners of their own in their next at bat, as a single by Rafael Belliard, a passed ball, and a walk to Smith put runners on with only one out in the top of the third inning. Morris retired Terry Pendleton and Ron Gant to end the threat. The Twins would get a runner to third the next inning, as Dan Gladden doubled and advanced to third on a line out by Chuck Knoblauch, but Smoltz struck Kirby Puckett out to keep the score at zero. 

The Braves had another chance in their half of the fifth, as Mark Lemke recorded a single. Belliard followed by laying down a sacrifice bunt to advance him, and Smith beat out a drag bunt attempt to put runners on the corners with only one out. Morris, as he had before, managed to get out of trouble by getting Pendleton to pop up for the second out and striking Gant out to end the inning. Neither team would mount a threat again for several innings, with Gladden and Puckett the only players to reach base. 

The Braves started their half of the eighth with a Smith single. Pendleton stood in next and on a 1-2 pitch, he swung and, according to Morris, missed the next pitch. Pendleton appealed, maintaining he had foul tipped the ball; umpire Terry Tata ruled that had been the case and the at bat continued. What followed turned out to be the turning point for the Braves in the series.

Braves manager Bobby Cox was aggressive, calling for a hit and run. Pendleton executed his part with a deep fly to center field. Smith rounded second, but then momentarily stopped running. Knoblauch and his fellow middle infielder Greg Gagne had set up a decoy system designed to confuse the baserunner, feigning going for a double play. Smith, meanwhile, maintained that he did not fall for the decoy but instead lost sight of the ball. Regardless of what really happened, Smith could have easily scored had he simply kept running, but only reached third, while Pendleton reached second on a double. 

Ron Gant followed with a groundout to Kent Hrbek at first for the first out. The next batter was David Justice, and Tom Kelly emerged from the dugout to talk to his ace. Morris was not pleased to see his manager, as he thought that he was coming to the mound to remove him from the game. Instead, he was there to discuss strategy. Justice was a significant enough power threat that Kelly thought of intentionally walking Justice and pitching instead to Sid Bream, who had been struggling throughout the series with only three hits.

Morris agreed with Kelly, and Justice was walked to load the bases for Bream. This proved to be the last in the series of events that ended up costing the Braves, as Morris induced a ground ball up the first base line. First baseman Kent Hrbek threw home to retire Smith, whose gaffe had set the series in motion. Harper then fired back to Hrbek to retire Bream, who had been playing with chronic knee injuries (five previous surgeries and playing with a large brace on one knee still) and as a result was regarded as one of the slowest baserunners in the league. The rare 3-2-3 double play ended the inning, and the Braves did not have a runner reach base for the remainder of the game.

In the bottom of the eighth, Randy Bush pinch-hit for Gagne to lead off for the Twins, and singled off Smoltz, then was removed in favor of the faster Al Newman to pinch-run. Smoltz then retired Gladden but gave up a single to Knoblauch, his eighth hit of the Series. With one out, runners on the corners, and Puckett coming to the plate, Cox elected to remove Smoltz from the game.

Mike Stanton entered and was ordered to intentionally walk Puckett to load the bases‚Äîan unusual decision as managers usually only issue intentional walks when first base is open, not in circumstances where the walk will advance a runner into scoring position. But in this case, the next batter was Hrbek, who, though normally a power threat, had not had a hit since Game 3, and whom Stanton had struck out three times in a row (a reason the Braves used Stanton, a left-handed specialist). This time, Stanton got Hrbek to hit a relatively soft line drive to Lemke, who then stepped on second to double-up Knoblauch. The game continued with no score.

The Braves went down in order in the top of the ninth, as Morris retired Brian Hunter, Greg Olson, and Lemke. The Twins, with a chance to win the game in their final at-bat, led off with a Chili Davis single. After Jarvis Brown came in to run for Davis, Harper attempted to move him over with a bunt down the first base line. Stanton misstepped coming to play the bunt, allowing Harper to reach base without a play. To make matters worse for Atlanta, Stanton&#x27;s misstep caused him to strain a muscle in his back, and he had to be removed from the game. Cox was forced to bring in Alejandro Pe√±a to pitch to Shane Mack. Despite his earlier struggles, Pe√±a induced a ground ball double play from Mack to record the first two outs. He then gave Mike Pagliarulo an intentional walk and struck out pinch hitter Paul Sorrento for the last out, marking the third time in the series that a game would be decided in extra innings.

Refusing to come out of the game, Morris pitched the top of the tenth. A Twin Cities sportswriter wrote that on that night, &quot;[Morris] could have outlasted Methuselah.&quot; He successfully rebuffed several attempts by Kelly to remove him during the game, and was supported by pitching coach Dick Such. Confronted with Morris&#x27;s insistence on pitching the 10th, Kelly is purported to have said, &quot;Oh hell. It&#x27;s only a game.&quot; And as he had been for most of the night, Morris was effective, retiring Jeff Blauser, Smith, and Pendleton in order. Morris threw 126 pitches in the game. Smoltz later said that if he had had the experience Morris had at the time, he might also have tried to argue his way out of being removed from the game when he got in trouble in the 8th, but as a young and fairly inexperienced pitcher, he didn&#x27;t feel he had the standing to argue with Cox the way Morris did with Kelly.

Pe√±a faced Gladden to start the bottom half of the inning, and the Twins&#x27; leadoff hitter lifted a fly ball to left field after breaking his bat upon the impact. The ball landed in front of the charging Hunter for a bloop hit, and the ball then took a high bounce that Hunter was unable to field. Center fielder Gant backed up the play and caught the hop, but Gladden dashed to second and beat Gant&#x27;s throw to the bag. Kelly then called for a sacrifice bunt, and Knoblauch executed to put the winning run on third with one out. As he&#x27;d done in the eighth, Cox called for an intentional walk to the resurgent Puckett. Hrbek, who had not gotten a hit in his last 16 at-bats dating back to his single in the eighth inning of Game¬†3, was next up. Despite Hrbek&#x27;s .115 Series average (3 hits in the Series, two of which were in Game 1) and lack of speed, and even though the Braves had left-hander Kent Mercker, who had struck Hrbek out in a similar situation earlier in the series, warming up in the bullpen along with right-hander Jim Clancy, Cox decided to call a second consecutive intentional walk, loading the bases to set up a force play at home plate and the possibility of a double play, which would have ended the inning.

This left Kelly with a tough decision. Brown, who pinch ran for designated hitter Davis, was due up and he had not recorded a hit in the series. Entering the 10th inning, Kelly had already used four of the seven players on his bench (Bush, Newman, Brown, and Sorrento). Then in the top half of the inning, he had inserted Scott Leius, normally a third baseman, into the game at shortstop in place of pinch hitter Sorrento. This left Kelly with backup catcher Junior Ortiz‚Äîa weak hitter whom he would need if the game continued and something happened to Harper and who he would often use as a late-game defensive replacement as he was a better defensive catcher than Harper‚Äîand utility man Gene Larkin, who was playing with an injured knee but had gotten one hit in three previous series plate appearances.

Since he would not have needed to play him in the field, as he would have filled the designated hitter role if the game advanced beyond the tenth, Kelly decided to send Larkin to the plate. On the first pitch he saw, Larkin drove a single into deep left-center over the drawn-in outfield, scoring Gladden with the series-winning run and giving the Twins their second world championship since moving to Minnesota. Morris was the first player to embrace Gladden at the plate, followed by others. At the same time, Larkin was mobbed at first base. The two jubilant groups eventually merged in the middle of the diamond. The victorious players were soon joined by their families on the field, including Morris&#x27;s two sons. Later, the Twins players did a victory lap around the perimeter of the Metrodome.

The seventh game of the 1991 World Series has since been widely regarded as one of the greatest games in the history of professional baseball. Jack Morris and his 10-inning shutout, has also since been viewed by many baseball historians as one of the greatest pitching performances in a seventh game of the World Series.

For the first time since , a seventh game of the World Series ended 1‚Äì0. It was also the first World Series-deciding game to go into extra innings since Game 4 of the 1939 Series. This World Series was also the first to end with an extra-inning Game 7 since , when the home team, the Washington Senators (who became the Twins in 1961), won it in their last at-bat. The same thing happened in the 1997 World Series, when the Florida Marlins beat the Cleveland Indians in the 11th inning of Game¬†7. (Game 7 of the 2016 World Series also went to extra innings, when the visiting Chicago Cubs defeated the Cleveland Indians in 10 innings.) This game set a World Series record for the longest scoreless tie in Game¬†7. Only one other World Series game went longer without a run, Game¬†6 of the 1956 World Series, which went to two outs in the bottom of the 10th before the winning run scored.

The 1991 World Series was the second in five seasons where the home team won all seven games. The previous time was in 1987, which the Twins won against the St. Louis Cardinals. It happened again in the 2001 World Series when the Arizona Diamondbacks won Game 7 with a walk-off bloop hit. Game¬†7 of this series was the last World Series game played at the Metrodome before the Twins moved out at the end of the 2009 season, and the last postseason game played there until 2002, when the Twins lost the ALCS to the Angels.

==Composite line score==
1991 World Series (4‚Äì3): Minnesota Twins (A.L.) over Atlanta Braves (N.L.)
==Aftermath==
The home team did not win every game again until the 2001 World Series between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the New York Yankees. Seven Twins players appeared in both the 1987 and 1991 Series, playing for the Twins both times: Kirby Puckett, Kent Hrbek, Greg Gagne, Dan Gladden, Gene Larkin, Randy Bush and Al Newman. In addition, the Braves&#x27; Terry Pendleton also played in the 1987 Series, as a Cardinal.

After the Twins&#x27; triumph, the 1993 Phillies, 1998 Padres, 2007 Rockies and the 2008 Rays followed previous seasons&#x27; last-place finishes with a World Series appearance, but fell short. But the 2013 Red Sox joined the 1991 Twins as the only other team to win the World Series a year after finishing in last place.

After Game 7, CBS Sports analyst Tim McCarver consoled Atlanta fans by stating that this was an excellent team and that he expected they would &quot;be around&quot; for some time to come. In fact, the Braves won an unprecedented 14 consecutive division titles (three as members of the NL West, and the last 11 in the East), not counting the strike-aborted 1994 season. In 1992 in particular, the Braves returned to the NLCS and once again defeated the Pirates in seven games, culminating in a dramatic game seven win. Francisco Cabrera&#x27;s two-out single that scored David Justice and Sid Bream capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Braves a 3‚Äì2 victory. It was the first time in post-season history that the tying and winning runs had scored on a single play in the ninth inning. The World Series however, the Braves lost in six games to the Toronto Blue Jays. The Braves made three more trips to the World Series before the decade ended, defeating the Cleveland Indians in 1995 and losing in 1996 and 1999 to the Yankees.

As previously mentioned, Charlie Leibrandt again had the opportunity to play in the World Series with the Braves in 1992. In the final game, in circumstances eerily similar to Game 6 of the prior year&#x27;s Series, Leibrandt was called in as a reliever in an extra-inning game. Just as in 1991, Bobby Cox was criticized for using Leibrandt as a reliever with closer Jeff Reardon and relievers Marvin Freeman and David Nied still available. Toronto rallied for two runs in the top of the 11th on a hit by Dave Winfield. The Braves did manage to get one of those runs back in the bottom of the 11th; however, it was not enough and Leibrandt ended up as the losing pitcher.

The Twins contended for the 1992 American League Western Division title for much of the season but finished six games behind the Oakland Athletics, who won the division for the fourth time in five seasons. The Twins&#x27; 90‚Äì72 record was their last winning campaign until 2001, Kelly&#x27;s last season as manager. Kelly spent the remainder of his managerial career attempting to rebuild the Twins, who went 71‚Äì91 in 1993, 50‚Äì63 in 1994, 56‚Äì88 in 1995, 78‚Äì84 in 1996, 68‚Äì94 in 1997, 70‚Äì92 in 1998, 63‚Äì97 in 1999, and 69‚Äì93 in 2000. Over the next several seasons, the players that made up the core of the 1987 and 1991 Twins slowly began to leave. Gladden, the left fielder, departed in the offseason for Detroit. Morris, the pitching hero of the series, signed with Toronto and returned to the World Series the next year. Gagne and Davis departed after the 1992 season and Harper at the end of the 1993 season. Hrbek&#x27;s production began falling due to injuries that kept him off the field for much of the next two seasons, and he retired in 1994. 

The Twins traded away both Erickson and Tapani (neither ever regained his 1991 form) in 1995, and Puckett retired due to a loss of vision in his right eye caused by glaucoma. Though the Twins didn&#x27;t make it to the postseason for the rest of Puckett&#x27;s career, he remained an elite player. In 1994, Puckett was switched to right field and won his first league RBI title by driving in 112 runs in only 108 games; a pace that projects to 168 RBIs over a full season. But the 1994 season was cut short by a players&#x27; strike. Puckett retired as the Twins&#x27; all-time leader in career hits, runs, doubles, and total bases. At the time of his retirement, his .318 career batting average was the highest by any right-handed American League batter since Joe DiMaggio. Puckett was the fourth baseball player during the 20th century to record 1,000 hits in his first five full calendar years in Major League Baseball, and was the second to record 2,000 hits during his first ten full calendar years. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001, his first year of eligibility.

Knoblauch was the last hitter of the 1991 team to remain in Minnesota, eventually forcing a trade after the 1997 season to the Yankees, with whom he won three additional World Series titles. After being traded to the playoff-bound Red Sox in 1995, Aguilera returned to the Twins in 1996, used by Kelly as a starter. Aguilera returned to the pen in 1997, and stayed until midway through the 1999 season, the last remaining player from the 1991 team. Traded to the Cubs, he finished his career with Chicago that season.

This was the last World Series that Fay Vincent presided over as commissioner, as the owners forced him to resign near the end of the 1992 season.

The Twins and Braves have met seven times in interleague play since the 1991 World Series. In 2002, the Braves finally experienced a Metrodome win by taking two games from the Twins in a three-game series; the Twins swept a three-game series from the Braves at the Metrodome in 2007. The Braves ultimately finished with an all-time record of 2‚Äì8 in the stadium before it closed as a baseball venue in 2009. In 2010, the teams played a three-game series at the new Target Field, where the Braves won two out of three games. After the 1991 Series, the Twins did not play in Atlanta again until 2011 for two preseason exhibition games at Turner Field. The Braves and Twins split the series 1‚Äì1. Then, as part of the new season-long interleague schedule, the Twins played their first regular-season series against the Braves at Turner Field in May 2013; the Braves swept the three-game set. In 2016, the teams met twice. A two-game series at Target Field was swept by the visiting Braves in July, while the Twins won two games at Turner Field in August. In their most recent series in 2019, the Braves won two out of three games in Minnesota. Starting in 2023, both teams would play a single three-game series annually, with the Twins visiting Truist Park for the first time from June 26‚Äì28.

To date, this is the most recent appearance (and win) by a Minnesota-based Big Four team in the final round of its sport. In addition to the 2002 Twins reaching the ALCS before falling to the Anaheim Angels in five games, the closest a Minnesota-based team has come to reaching the final round of its sport since the 1991 World Series were the NFL&#x27;s Minnesota Vikings reaching the NFC Championship Game in 1998, 2000, 2009, and 2017, the NHL&#x27;s Minnesota Wild reaching the Stanley Cup Western Conference Final in 2003, and the NBA&#x27;s Minnesota Timberwolves reaching the Western Conference Finals in 2004 and 2024.

==Broadcasting==
CBS covered the World Series on television for the second consecutive year. The network&#x27;s primary baseball commentary team of Jack Buck and Tim McCarver led the coverage, with Jim Kaat reporting from the field as well as presiding over the presentation of the World Series Trophy to the Twins at the conclusion of the series. This was Buck&#x27;s ninth consecutive World Series as the lead announcer, as he had been the lead radio voice of the Fall Classic from 1983 until 1989. McCarver was working his fifth World Series as an analyst, having worked the 1985, 1987, and 1989 series for ABC and the previous year for CBS. 

In addition to Kaat, CBS employed dugout level reporters with Lesley Visser assigned to the Twins and Andrea Joyce assigned to the Braves. Pat O&#x27;Brien was the host for the pregame and postgame shows that followed each broadcast. 

CBS Radio, as it had since 1976, provided nationwide radio coverage of the World Series. Vin Scully, who had rejoined the network in 1990 following his departure from NBC, called his sixth World Series for CBS. Johnny Bench served as the lead analyst for a third consecutive year, and John Rooney hosted the pregame and postgame shows for a fifth consecutive year. 

This was the last World Series Jack Buck would call in his lifetime. After the World Series, CBS elected to replace him with Boston Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough for 1992 and beyond. Although Buck continued to call games for the St. Louis Cardinals for the remainder of the decade, they did not reach the World Series again until 2004, two years after his death from lung cancer. His broadcast partner McCarver would be in the booth for each of the four subsequent World Series; he would work the 1992 and 1993 series for CBS, rejoin ABC as part of its lead Baseball Network team for the 1995 World Series, then move to Fox Sports where he would call the 1996 World Series alongside Buck&#x27;s son Joe. After that, McCarver would go on to call every World Series that was covered by Fox until he retired from full-time broadcasting at the end of the 2013 season. 

The Series telecast drew an overall national Nielsen rating of 24.0 and a 39 share for CBS; Game¬†7 drew a 32.2 rating and 49 share. As of 2021, no subsequent World Series has approached either number in national TV ratings.

<text>Hui Shi (; 370‚Äì310 BCE), or Huizi (; &quot;Master Hui&quot;), was a Chinese philosopher during the Warring States period. A representative of the School of Names (Logicians), he is famous for ten paradoxes about the relativity of time and space, for instance, &quot;I set off for Yue (southeastern China) today and came there yesterday.&quot; Said to have written a code of laws, Hui was a prime minister in the state of Wei.

==Philosophy==

The Yiwenzhi attributes a philosophical work to Hui Shi, but it is no longer extant, probably being lost prior to the Tang dynasty. For this reason, knowledge of his philosophy relies on the several Chinese classic texts that refer to him, including the &quot;Zhan Guo Ce&quot;, &quot;L√ºshi Chunqiu&quot;, &quot;Han Feizi&quot;, &quot;Xunzi&quot;, and most frequently, the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;. Nine &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; chapters mention Hui Shi, calling him &quot;Huizi&quot; 26 times and &quot;Hui Shi&quot; 9 times. &quot;Under Heaven&quot; (chapter 33), which summarizes Warring States philosophies, contains all of the latter 9 references by name.

Belonging to the School of Names, Hui Shi&#x27;s philosophy is characterised by arguments centred around the relativity of the concepts of sameness ( ) and difference ( ). He frequently used analogies and paradoxes to convey his arguments.

===The Ten Theses===
The final chapter of the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, ( &#x27;Under Heaven&#x27;) claims that Hui Shi held ten main opinions, referred to as &quot;The Ten Theses&quot; or &quot;The Ten Paradoxes&quot;, and lists them as follows:

:# The largest thing has nothing beyond it; it is called the One of largeness. The smallest thing has nothing within it; it is called the One of smallness.
:# That which has no thickness cannot be piled up; yet it is a thousand &quot;li&quot; in dimension.
:# Heaven is as low as earth; mountains and marshes are on the same level.
:# The sun at noon is the sun setting. The thing born is the thing dying.
:# Great similarities are different from little similarities; these are called the little similarities and differences. The ten thousand things are all similar and are all different; these are called the great similarities and differences.
:# The southern region has no limit and yet has a limit.
:# I set off for Yueh today and came there yesterday.
:# Linked rings can be separated.
:# I know the center of the world: it is north of Yen and south of Yueh.
:# Let love embrace the ten thousand things; Heaven and earth are a single body.

The list in the does not, however, explain how Hui Shi argued these theses. Though the theses seem haphazard, and the list lacking in logical structure, Chris Fraser argues that they can be divided into four natural groups:
# The basic principles (theses 1, 5 and 10) ‚Äì These are non-paradoxical statements of Hui Shi&#x27;s ontological doctrines. Thesis 1 presents the relativity of the concept of oneness. At the extremes, the One can be interpreted as the smallest possible part, with nothing inside it, or the largest possible whole, with everything inside it. (The idea of a &quot;smallest thing&quot; is sometimes used to argue that Hui Shi was an atomist, but Fraser proposes that it might be a geometrical point rather than an atom.) Thesis 5 represents the claim that sameness and difference are also relative and perspective-dependent, and that two things can be the same in one way while differing in another. Finally, thesis 10 contains an ethical element alongside an ontological one, suggesting that, if all things can be considered to form one whole, us included, we should treat all things with the same love with which we treat ourselves.
# The paradoxes of infinitesimals and part-whole relations (theses 2 and 8) ‚Äì Thesis 2 presents the paradox of the infinite divisibility of things into dimensionless, infinitesimal points (the &quot;smallest things&quot; from thesis 1) despite the seeming impossibility of adding together dimensionless objects to yield anything with thickness. Thesis 8 is obscure, but Fraser suggests it could be explained through thesis 2: if the rings are formed entirely of infinitesimal points, which take up no space, then there should be nothing there to prevent the rings from passing through each other. 
# The paradoxes of spatial relations (theses 3, 6, and 9) ‚Äì Thesis 3 applies the relativism of thesis 5 to spatial relations: if &quot;the ten thousand things are all similar and are all different&quot;, then there is a certain scale or perspective from which the apparently great distance between heaven and earth is reduced to nothing. Theses 6 and 9 concern the indexicality of the cardinal directions, i.e., the meaning of &quot;south&quot; changes the further one travels south. 
# The paradoxes of temporal relations (theses 4 and 7) ‚Äì Thesis 4 can be explained through the multiplicity of perspectives: while the sun appears high here, to someone further east it must appear to be setting. Similarly, from the moment a thing is born, even as it grows, it is at the same time approaching its death. Thesis 7 is unclear, but also seems to relate to the relativity of time.

===Miscellaneous Paradoxes===

Another passage from the attributes 21 more paradoxes to Hui Shi and other members of the School of Names, which they are said to have used in their debates. Compared to the Ten Theses listed above, they appear even more absurd and unsolvable:

The last statement in particular, &quot;if from a stick a foot long you every day take the half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted&quot; is notable for its resemblance to the Dichotomy paradox described by Zeno of Elea. Zeno&#x27;s paradox takes the example of a runner on a finite race track, arguing that, because runner must reach the halfway point before they can reach the finish line, and the length of the track can be divided into halves infinitely many times, it should be impossible for them to reach the finish line in a finite amount of time. The Mohist canon appears to propose a solution to this paradox by arguing that in moving across a measured length, the distance is not covered in successive fractions of the length, but in one stage.

Due to the lack of surviving works, most of the other paradoxes listed are difficult to interpret.

=== Fondness for Analogies ===

A dialogue in the Shuo Yuan portrays Hui Shi as having a tendency to overuse analogies ( , which can also be translated as &quot;illustrative examples&quot;) with Hui Shi justifying this habit with the claim that communication is impossible without analogies:

A. C. Graham argues that this philosophical position suggests some affinity between Hui Shi and the Mohists, in their shared opinion that &quot;the function of names is to communicate that an object is like the objects one knows by the name&quot;

==Relation to Zhuangzi==

Most of the other &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; passages portray Hui Shi (Huizi) as a friendly rival of Zhuangzi (). Hui Shi acts as an intellectual foil who argues the alternative viewpoint, or criticizes the Daoist perspective, often with moments of humor. The best known of the Zhuang-Hui dialogues concerns the subjectivity of happiness.
According to these ancient Daoist stories, Zhuangzi and Hui Shi remained friendly rivals until death.

Chad Hansen (2003:146) interprets this lament as &quot;the loss of a philosophical partnership, of two like-minded but disagreeing intellectual companions engaged in the joys of productive philosophical argument.&quot;

<text>Gerald Paul Lindgren (born March 9, 1946) is an American track and field runner who set many long-standing high school and national records in the United States. In 1965, Lindgren and Billy Mills both broke the world record for the six-mile run when they finished in an extremely rare tie at the AAU National Championships, both running exactly 27:11.6. Lindgren went on to win a record 11 NCAA collegiate championships with Washington State University.

==Running career==
===High school===
In 1964, in his senior year at Rogers High School, Lindgren ran 5000 meters in 13 minutes and 44 seconds flat, on a clay track in Compton, CA setting a U.S. high school record for the distance that would remain unbroken for 40 years, until Galen Rupp ran 13:37.91 on July 30, 2004. Among his other records he established that year was his time of 8:40.0 in an indoor race that shattered the previous U.S. national high school mark by an incredible 43 seconds; it was the fastest high school time ever run indoors until February 16, 2013, when Edward Cheserek ran 8:39.15 at the Millrose Games.

Lindgren was coached by Tracy Walters in high school, where Walters was responsible for inspiring Gerry to the heights he reached. In the summer following high school graduation and his historic 13:44 5k, Lindgren ran 200 miles a week for 6 weeks in preparation for the US-USSR meet. After that victory, he also set a new teenage record of 13:17.0 for 3 miles while competing in Jamaica, a meet where he ran his mile best of 4:01.5 as well, both on a dirt track.

On July 25, 1964, Lindgren outran two seasoned Soviet runners, Leonid Ivanov and Anatoly Dutov to win the 10,000 m event in the US-USSR Track Meet in Los Angeles. The event heralded great success for American distance runners in 1964. The ensuing 12 months brought forth 2 gold medals by Americans, in both the 5,000 and 10,000 m events in Tokyo, as well as World Records in the 2-mile, 6-mile and indoor mile. Lindgren was &quot;Track and Field News&quot; &quot;High School Athlete of the Year&quot; in 1964, and won the 10,000 meter race at the 1964 Olympic Trials.

===The Summer Olympics and After===

In the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, he finished ninth in the 10,000 meters (m) behind gold medalist Billy Mills after having sprained an ankle during training. Four years later, Lindgren tried to make the 1968 Olympic team but finished 5th in the 10,000 m and 4th in the 5,000 m in the Olympic Trials at Echo Summit, just missing the team at both distances. In his training just after college, he was said to have averaged 240 miles per week for one year, including allegedly running a 380-mile week.

Lindgren also competed against Mills in the 1965 AAU Nationals meet, where they raced the . Mills won with a diving lean, while both were timed in 27:11.6, a new world record shared by Mills and Lindgren. The mark was also superior to the then world record for 10,000 m of 28:15 held by Ron Clarke. T&amp;F News converted their mark to 28:10. But perhaps Lindgren&#x27;s greatest race came during a May 1966 NCAA Regional meet at age 20, in the 3-mile run on a dirt track during a cold, windy day in Seattle. He raced to 12:53.0, just missing the world record of 12:52.4 held by Ron Clarke. Both times were superior to the then world record in the 5,000 m of 13:24. T&amp;F News converted his time to 13:21.

===Collegiate and retirement===
Lindgren attended Washington State University in Pullman, Washington, where he majored in political science and minored in Russian language. While at Washington State, Lindgren won 11 NCAA Championships. (His only loss at an NCAA championship was to Jim Ryun in the 1968 indoor race.) He was one of only two people to ever defeat Steve Prefontaine in an NCAA Championship. (Lindgren won the 1969 NCAA Cross Country Championship in which 1968 NCAA champion Mike Ryan finished second and Prefontaine third.) He competed sporadically after graduating from college but without any notable success. Since 1980, Lindgren has lived in Honolulu, Hawaii. He continues to run regularly, active in the Hawaii running community. He coached the University of Hawaii&#x27;s women&#x27;s track and field team 2005‚Äì2007.

==Notes==
* Lindgren&#x27;s 6-mile personal record and his 10,000 meter personal record vary to a much larger degree than the lengthwise difference between the two distances (the 10,000 meters is 0.2 miles longer than 6 miles) would indicate. His 6-mile best time of 27:11 would hypothetically convert to just above 28 minutes for 10,000 meters if he continued at a similar pace for an extra 321 meters. However, he never ran faster than 28:40 in the 10,000m, as the 10,000m was not raced as often in the United States as the 6-mile was during the time Lindgren competed. Similar circumstances surround his 3-mile and 5000m pr differences.

<text>The Basilic, or The Ottoman Cannon was a very large-calibre cannon designed by Orban, a cannon engineer, Saruca Usta and architect Muslihiddin Usta at a time when cannons were still new. It is one of the largest cannons ever built.

The cannon was first offered to Constantine XI, who turned it down due to the cost of its construction. It was later offered to the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, who ordered the cannon built after learning that it could smash through walls using a large projectile. When it was completed, the cannon was used by the Ottoman Army during the fall of Constantinople and played a key role in damaging the Walls of Constantinople in 1453. 

Orban managed to build this giant cannon within three months at Adrianople. Due to its size, it was dragged by 90 oxen and 400 men to Constantinople. The cannonball, which could be shot at a distance of , weighed . It was horribly powerful, and when it hit, it caused massive damage to Constantinople&#x27;s walls. The cannon also killed some of its operators. Additionally, due to the material the cannon was constructed of, and the intense heat created by the charge after each shot, the barrel had to be soaked in warm oil to prevent cold air from penetrating and enlarging the fissures. The heat also prevented the cannon from being fired more than three times per day. Ultimately, it lasted all of six weeks before becoming non-functional.

* Length: ~24 feet (7.32 m)
* Diameter: 2.5 feet (76.2 cm)
* Cannonball: 1200 lb (540 kg) 
* Range: ~1 mile (1.6 km)

<text>Resolution Island or Tau Moana (MƒÅori) is the largest island in the Fiordland region of southwest New Zealand, covering a total of . It is the country&#x27;s seventh largest island, and the second largest uninhabited island. Resolution Island is separated from the mainland of the South Island by Tamatea / Dusky Sound, Te Puaitaha / Breaksea Sound, and Acheron Passage. The island is part of the Fiordland National Park.

The island is roughly rectangular, with the exception of a long narrow peninsula on the west coast known as Five Fingers Peninsula: an area protected by the Taumoana (Five Fingers Peninsula) Marine Reserve.

The island is named after Captain James Cook&#x27;s ship &quot;Resolution&quot; which landed here on Dusky Sound during Cook&#x27;s Second Voyage in March 1773.

The island was chosen in 2004 to be one of New Zealand&#x27;s offshore reserves, which are cleared of introduced species to protect native species. This follows a much earlier episode, in 1894, when the Department of Lands and Survey appointed Richard Henry as curator of the island, which was stocked with species such as kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç and kiwi that were threatened by mustelids on the mainland. This early attempt at using the island for conservation management failed when stoats reached the island in 1900.

On 15 July 2009, Resolution island was at the epicentre of a magnitude 7.8 earthquake.

==Flora==
The island is an important sanctuary, not only because it has never been colonised by possums, but also because it contains much ecological diversity in habitats ranging from wetlands to forests to alpine areas, with the highest mountains on the island reaching around 1,000¬†m. The most widespread forest type on the island is beech-broadleaved forest, while the alpine areas comprise mainly tussock, but also wetlands and tarns. Over 400 indigenous species have been recorded on the island, which is considerably more than on the surrounding mainland. Among the plants are six endangered species, such as several types of endemic mistletoe, and over a dozen nationally uncommon species. Many of these plants suffer elsewhere in Fiordland from browsing by possums.

==Fauna==
The only introduced mammals on the island are stoats, red deer and mice. Ongoing stoat and rat control since 2008 allows the island to be used as a sanctuary. Pest trapping is being used on the island by laying trap networks including various DOC traps, and Goodnature A24 traps to aid in bringing the pest populations down to improve the environment for threatened bird species such as the m≈çhua (yellowhead) and tƒ´eke (saddleback). Many other native bird species can be found on the island, including karearea (New Zealand falcon), kaka, kea, and kiwi.

<doc id="1094430" wikidata="Q11728013" url="?curid=1094430" title="Johnny &amp; Associates">
<text>was a Japanese talent agency formed by Johnny Kitagawa in 1962, which managed groups of male idols known as The company had a significant impact on pop culture with male idols and boy bands in Japan since the 1980s. Until 2019, the company was known for its strict policies regarding music distribution abroad and its strict control over the right of publicity to using the likeness of idols under its management.

In the wake of continuing sexual abuse allegations directed against Kitagawa, who died in 2019, his niece, Julie Keiko Fujishima, stepped down as president in September 2023. On October 2, 2023, Johnny &amp; Associates announced that they would be splitting into two entities: Smile-Up, a firm focused on reparations for Kitagawa&#x27;s sexual abuse cases, and Starto Entertainment, a talent agency managing the acts that had been managed under Johnny &amp; Associates.

==History==
===1962‚Äì1989===
In 1962, Kitagawa launched his first group, Johnnys. In its early days, Kitagawa&#x27;s agency rented an office space owned by Watanabe Productions, operating under its management as well. Six years later, Four Leaves, a boy band created by the agency, became successful. Four Leaves left a lasting legacy to the industry because it was produced as a &quot;Group sounds band that does not play instruments&quot;, a product of Kitagawa&#x27;s taste for emphasizing the attributes, personality and physical abilities of a performer. Kitagawa formed a number of other successful acts, such as Masahiko Kond≈ç, whose song , won the 1987 Japan Record Award, and Hikaru Genji, the first Johnny group with three singles on the Japanese Oricon yearly chart in 1988.

Johnny &amp; Associates played an integral role in the post-war growth of Japanese boy bands and the idol industry. While there were idols since the 1970s who were able to sing and dance at the same time, the agency popularized the idea of performance-oriented idols in the 1980s. Kitagawa himself was credited with pioneering the idol system where trainees (known as Johnny Jr.) are admitted into the agency at a young age to train in singing, dancing, and acting until their debut.

===1990‚Äì2009===
Around the 1990s, Johnny &amp; Associates&#x27; marketing strategy changed to include variety show hosting as a specialty in their talents. At the time, the agency focused on marketing the singing and dancing talents of their acts until they would retire around age 25 as they aged out of the industry. Taking note of former Shibugakitai member Hirohide Yakumaru&#x27;s success as an MC on &quot;Hanamaru&quot;, Johnny &amp; Associates subsequently trained their more recent groups to have public personas as well.

During the 1990s Johnny &amp; Associates began declining nominations from the Japan Record Awards and the Japan Academy Awards, partly due to a dispute about the musical genre of one of their groups at the 32nd Japan Record Awards. Another reason cited was that the nominations would engender competition among Johnny groups and with other nominees.

In 1997 the agency founded a record label, Johnny&#x27;s Entertainment. Also, a New Year&#x27;s Eve countdown concert is held live on Fuji TV from the Tokyo Dome since 1996 known as &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Countdown Live&quot; with a different theme each year.

In 2006, Oricon sued journalist Hiro Ugaya when he was quoted in a &quot;Cyzo&quot; magazine article suggesting that the company manipulated its statistics to benefit certain management companies and labels (specifically, Johnny &amp; Associates). Ugaya condemned the action as a strategic lawsuit against public participation, and it was later dropped by Oricon with no charges filed against the journalist.

In 2007, a temporary Johnny&#x27;s Jr. group, Hey! Say! 7, broke a record as the youngest male group to ever top Oricon charts, with an average age of 14.8 years. Later that year, Hey! Say! JUMP broke a record as the largest group to debut in Johnny&#x27;s history, with ten members.

By 2008, Johnny &amp; Associates was known as the &quot;top 3&quot; recording artist companies.

===2010‚Äì2023===

On November 19, 2010, Masahiko Kondo received the Best Vocal Performance award at the 52nd Japan Record Awards; Kondo was the first Johnny recipient since Ninja refused to perform live at the 1990 awards.

On September 18, 2011, Kitagawa received Guinness World Record awards for the most number-one singles (232) and the most concerts (8,419 from 1974 to 2010) produced by an individual. His shows have been attended by an estimated 48,234,550 people.

In 2016, SMAP, which had been active for 30 years and was called a nationally popular group, suddenly broke up. The reason was said to be a feud between the female manager Michi Iijima in charge and Mary Yasuko Fujishima, who was an executive at the office, a sister of Johnny Kitagawa. Iijima later established a new company, and the three members who left the office belonged to her company.

In 2018, Johnny &amp; Associates, especially Kitagawa, who had been previously known for strictly controlling access to their acts, established a YouTube channel for their trainee groups, Johnny&#x27;s Jr. In January 2019, Hideaki Takizawa was named the president of a new subdivision of the company called Johnny&#x27;s Island, where he would manage and oversee the debut of trainee group Snow Man. After Kitagawa&#x27;s death on July 9, 2019, his niece, Julie Keiko Fujishima was made the new president of the agency, while Takizawa and Suguru Shirahase became the vice presidents and Kitagawa&#x27;s older sister, Mary Yasuko Fujishima, became the executive director. However, Mary Yasuko Fujishima died on August 14, 2021.

After that, Johnny &amp; Associates made their discography available on streaming platforms and opened social media accounts. On November 1, 2022, Takizawa resigned from his position as vice president and departed from Johnny &amp; Associates. Yoshihiko Inohara, a former member of V6, replaced Takizawa as vice president.

On 4 September 2023 it was announced that Julie Fujishima would step down as president of the company and Noriyuki Higashiyama would become president.

===2023-present: Company rebranding===
In the wake of continuing sexual abuse allegations directed against Kitagawa, who died in 2019, his niece, Julie Keiko Fujishima, stepped down as president in September 2023. On October 2, 2023, Johnny &amp; Associates announced that they would be splitting into two entities: Smile-Up, a firm focused on reparations for Kitagawa&#x27;s sexual abuse cases, and Starto Entertainment, a talent agency managing existing acts under Johnny &amp; Associates.

Starto Entertainment, which takes the place of the entertainment side of Johnny&#x27;s, started activities in April 2024, with an all-agency concert series, with Arashi&#x27;s Jun Matsumoto and Super Eight&#x27;s Tadayoshi Okura as co-directors. Groups Timelesz, Super Eight and West. performed before their fans soon after their respective name change. Under the name of &quot;We are! Let&#x27;s get the party STARTO!!&quot;, the concert series took place over three days, in Tokyo Dome on April 10 and at Kyocera Dome Osaka on May 29 and 30, with appearances of NEWS, Super Eight, KAT-TUN, Hey! Say! JUMP, Kis-My-Ft2, Timelesz, A.B.C-Z, WEST., King &amp; Prince, SixTones, Snow Man, Naniwa Danshi and Travis Japan.

==Charity activities==
=== J-Friends ===
In 1998, Johnny&#x27;s groups KinKi Kids, V6 and Tokio, formed a special charity-oriented group called J-Friends, to raise funds for the 1995 Hanshin and Awaji earthquake victims. The group continued with several activities, until their disbandment in 2003.

=== Marching J ===
The agency continued its fundraising project, now with Marching J, for the T≈çhoku earthquake victims in 2011. Its first event was held on April 1‚Äì3. Hey! Say! JUMP, SMAP, Tokio, KinKi Kids, V6, Arashi, Tackey and Tsubasa, NEWS, Kanjani8, KAT-TUN and Johnny&#x27;s Juniors participated in the fundraiser, which included talk sessions and a cappella performances. The agency planned to hold one fundraiser per month for a year. The next event, a baseball tournament featuring Johnny&#x27;s Jrs., was held on May 29. Johnny &amp; Associates cancelled or postponed 18 concerts, including shows by Tomohisa Yamashita and Tackey &amp; Tsubasa. Generators, trucks and of gasoline which would have been used at the concerts were donated to the relief effort.

=== Smile-Up Project ===
Charity activities continued as Johnny&#x27;s &quot;Smile Up! Project&quot;. On May 13, 2020, it was reported that 76 of Johnny&#x27;s artists from 15 groups, including V6, Arashi, News and others, would be included in the temporary unit &quot;Twenty Twenty&quot;, as part of Johnny&#x27;s charity project with support activity to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This group sang the song &quot;Smile&quot;, written by Mr. Children&#x27;s Kazutoshi Sakurai, which was released as a single in digital form on June 22, and on CD on August 12. Yuya Tegoshi was taken off the grouping, due to reports of his failing to keep orders to stay at home during the emergency situation in April. Later on, it was revealed that his contract had been terminated, and that he had left the company.

Activities continued on the end-of-year period with a new awareness campaign against COVID-19 and the flu, starting on November 24. &quot;Aitsu&quot;, the new project, revolves around a series of movies continuing the health measure awareness used from the beginning of the pandemic, like the correct form of washing hands, the continuous use of a mask, among others. The movies were distributed around Japan and were included in the Smile Up! Project&#x27;s social network accounts.

Even in the middle of the turmoil surrounding the agency, as Smile Up, they posted a new charity event to help out the people affected in the Noto Peninsula earthquake that happened as 2024 rolled in. On January 4, the company announced through its official website that it would set up donation boxes at concert and theater performance venues where its artists would perform, and its XXXXX Pop Up Stores in Shibuya, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukuoka, in order to support the victims. &quot;By conducting this fundraising campaign as part of &quot;Smile Up! Project&quot;, we aim to provide continued support. The entire SMILE-UP Group sincerely prays for the earliest possible recovery and reconstruction so that everyone affected by the disaster can return to their normal lives.&quot; One day later, they also posted information on the donation of 50 million yen to the Noto Peninsula Earthquake Disaster Relief Fund.

=== Charity activities as Starto ===
Starto Entertainment continued the charity projects as part of their 2024 activities, with the single &quot;We are&quot;, sung by the special unit &quot;STARTO for you&quot;, formed by 75 members of 14 groups. The single was released in digital form on April 10, and as CD on June 12, with sales of the single going to Noto Earthquake relief funds. Additional information is expected to be released at a later date.

As of June 5, 2024, the &quot;Smile-Up Project&quot; is no longer, being reborn under the name &quot;Mindful&quot;, for which a new company has been established. General Incorporated Association &quot;Mindful&quot; will take over the charity activities, as well as other social contribution activities, like mental health care (which includes the support for sexual assault victims), enrollment support for higher education students in the Nursing field, and others.

==Views and controversies==
===Accessibility to talents===
The business model of Johnny &amp; Associates has an agency at the center in most areas in which it operates; the company has had its own recording, publishing, producing, filmmaking, merchandising, and advertising arms, a vertical integration that parallels Japanese system, and for most of its history transmitted information directly to fans exclusively through the &quot;Family Club&quot;, a tightly controlled, membership-based platform on which its artists and their fans can communicate and share information with each other. During the 20th century, the F.C. was largely maintained through mail and fax.

Johnny &amp; Associates has exercised strict control over their talent&#x27;s likeness, to the point where photographs were initially not even posted on the company&#x27;s official website and silhouettes were used in place of actual imagery on official websites of films and television in which the talent appeared. The agency began changing their stance on posting photos of their talent on different sites around 2007, with the agency, as well as the fans, keeping a vigilant watch on what was shared, with the latter alerting people against doing it because of the possible consequences. Official events, such as the naming of Hideaki Takizawa as &quot;Japan-UAE Goodwill Ambassador&quot; in 2017, saw full view photographs shared online, while the agency&#x27;s paid subscription services, like &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Web&quot;, shared digital content in limited quantities. While some of the initial &quot;photos&quot; were life-like drawings or paintings, a small amount of authentic photos where being shared by some drama and other TV program websites, with the usage permit for these being cleared, as in the case of SMAP&#x27;s Goro Inagaki&#x27;s drama, for example. Even singer Hikaru Utada felt the pressure of Johnny&#x27;s policy about their artists&#x27; photos, when she deleted a photo of an uchiwa fan with the face of Arashi&#x27;s Sho Sakurai that she had posted on her blog, substituting it with a hand-drawn teddy bear and a written message, and later, with a hand-drawn version of the fan. Apparently, one of the events that started the movement to freeing the images of Johnny&#x27;s idols online, was NHK&#x27;s 2009 K≈çhaku Uta Gassen, as the agency reached an agreement with the network to air the program in a paid on demand format.

In January 2018, Johnny &amp; Associates lifted their photo ban completely and allowed the press to post approved images of their talent more freely. In March 2018, Johnny &amp; Associates launched a YouTube channel for selected Johnny&#x27;s Jr. groups. Since Kitagawa&#x27;s death in 2019, Johnny &amp; Associates have expanded accessibility for their talent. This includes the opening of an official Twitter account for itself (which shares information about Johnny&#x27;s talent, mostly in English), as well as different social media accounts for the artists.

=== Sexual abuse cases ===

==== Original allegations and 2001 lawsuit ====

Several former acts from Johnny &amp; Associates, including former Four Leaves member Koji Kita in 1988 and former Johnny Jr.&#x27;s member Junya Hiramoto in 1996, alleged that Johnny Kitagawa had been sexually abusing several boys at the agency in their books. In 2001, &quot;Sh≈´kan Bunshun&quot; ran a series of similar sexual harassment allegations along with claims that Kitagawa had allegedly forced the boys to drink alcohol and smoke. Johnny &amp; Associates sued &quot;Shukan Bunshun&quot; for defamation, and in 2002, the Tokyo District Court ruled in favor of Kitagawa, awarding him in damages. In 2003, the fine was lowered to on the basis that the drinking and smoking allegations were defamatory, while the sexual harassment claims were not. Kitagawa filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of Japan. It was rejected in 2004. The case saw minimal coverage in Japan, with many journalists attributing it to Kitagawa&#x27;s influence on Japanese mass media.

==== 2023 BBC documentary and new claims ====
===== The documentary that shook the J-pop world =====
On March 7, 2023, the BBC released a documentary centered on the sexual harassment claims against Kitagawa titled &quot;&quot;. In response, Johnny &amp; Associates released a statement stating that they were working on creating &quot;transparent organizational structures&quot; that will be announced later in the year. Due to the release of the documentary, reports from books and magazines dated back to the 1960s began to surface, with the first report appearing in &quot;Weekly Sankei&#x27;s&quot; 29 March 1965 issue.

====== BBC follow-up program ======
A follow-up program by the BBC aired in 2024, called &quot;Our World: The Shadow of a Predator&quot;. On April 25, Smile Up sent the BBC a letter protesting the edition of Higashiyama&#x27;s words in the interview included in the program, as well as demanding a correction and apology for the problems caused by it to both Higashiyama and the victims who agreed to be interviewed. On May 3, 2024, the BBC refuted Smile-up&#x27;s claims via X.

===== The new claims =====
On April 12, 2023, musician and former Johnny&#x27;s Jr. member Kauan Okamoto claimed Kitagawa had abused him since he was 15, and that he was not the only victim. As a response, Johnny &amp; Associates stated they were working on transparency from within company and were working with their affiliates, to ensure thorough compliance with laws and strengthen organizational governance. The presidents of television networks Fuji TV, NHK, TV Asahi, and Nippon TV all stated in press conferences that they did not tolerate any kind of sexual violence and were conducting internal investigations. The networks continued to work with talent from Johnny &amp; Associates.

On May 14, 2023, Johnny Kitagawa&#x27;s niece and company head Julie Keiko Fujishima issued an apology to all talent who had been allegedly sexually abused by Kitagawa and claimed not knowing any other information. She stated was committed to implementing measures addressing the victim&#x27;s needs. In the following days, more victims came out stating Kitagawa abused them, including former Johnny&#x27;s Jr. Yasushi Hashida and former Kis-My-Ft2 member Kyohei Iida, the latter of whom stated he left his group due to being repeatedly sexually assaulted.

As of 2 October 2023, 478 people reportely have claimed to have been victimized by Kitagawa and 325 of them sought compensation. Only 150 have been confirmed to have belonged in the company. Updated numbers as of 16 February, mention 957 claimants, 282 notified the details of compensation, 246 have accepted the details, and 201 have been paid. An independent probe established by Johnny &amp; Associates reported the findings of their investigation on August 29, 2023, saying that Kitagawa repeatedly committed sexual abuse from the early 1970s until the mid-2010s. Johnny &amp; Associates held a press conference on September 7 to formally acknowledge Kitagawa&#x27;s abuse for the first time, while Fujishima resigned as CEO to assume the position as a representative director. Former Johnny&#x27;s talent Noriyuki Higashiyama took over as CEO. As a response to the investigation&#x27;s findings, several companies cancelled their contracts with entertainers from Johnny &amp; Associates, including Tokio Marine Nichido, Asahi Group, and Japan Airlines.

In 31 October 2024, Bunshun reported about a man claiming to have been assaulted by Kitagawa inside the NHK&#x27;s restroom when he was auditioning for a program when he was in high school. According to reports, his claims were not clear, given his failure to prove and provide some imformation. Smile-Up filed a lawsuit against him, claiming they did not have a reason to compensate him. The result for the lawsuit, filed in Chiba, was that Smile-Up did not have to pay.

==== Broadcaster response ====
This led to a particularly divided response among the broadcasters. NHK restricted and cancelled artists appearances, while the four commercial broadcasters with numerous regular programs are taking a flexible stance, allowing the talent to continue appearing on their programs, keeping a close eye on the response from their offices.

===== NHK =====
On 8 September 2023, NHK, the Japanese public broadcaster, said in a statement that they took the matter seriously, and that they would &quot;work harder to ensure that human rights are more respected in the broadcasting industry&quot; when it comes to using performers who best fit program content and production. The public broadcaster added that it did not fully acknowledge the sexual abuse matter despite various weekly magazine articles about the allegations and a Tokyo High Court ruling in 2004. A few weeks later, NHK announced that it would suspend new contracts with Johnny&#x27;s performers‚Äìincluding for their annual New Year&#x27;s Eve television special &quot;K≈çhaku Uta Gassen&quot;‚Äìuntil the company has implemented compensation and recurrence prevention measures. In February 2024, the company announced a strict policy of terminating the appearance of talents formerly affiliated with Johnny &amp; Associates on its programs and not allowing them to appear on new programs after FY2024. In October 2024, NHK Chairman Nobuo Inaba announced at a regular press conference that, he had confirmed efforts of Smile-Up to compensate victims and prevent recurrence and the separation of management from Starto Entertainment is steadily progressing, and that requests to perform‚Äìincluding K≈çhaku Uta Gassen for current Starto celebrities would resume. Commercial broadcasters had already announced on the resumption of new appointments to celebrities belonging to Starto.

====== Fuji Television ======
On September 7, 2023, Fuji Television Hideaki Tatematsu, head of the programming and production bureau, responded, ‚ÄúThere was no problem with the talent on the program, so we will continue to cast the talent as before. At a regular press conference on September 29, President Koichi Minato stated that sexual assault is unacceptable and asked the company to consider changing the name of the company and separating the company in charge of victim relief from the company in charge of managing the talent. Regarding the future use of the talent belonging to the company in programs, President Minato said, ‚ÄúWe will make an appropriate decision while confirming that measures for victims are being steadily implemented. At a regular press conference on February 16, 2024, Toru Ota, the managing director, said, &quot;We have heard that compensation for victims is progressing and that the new company, Starto Entertainment, will officially begin operations in April. For our part, we are willing to cast new talent from the former Johnny&#x27;s if the compensation issue is progressing&quot;.

====== TBS Television ======
20 September 2023, TBS Television (Japan) President Takashi Sasaki stated, ‚ÄúWe will continue to closely monitor trends in the improvement of the human rights environment (on the part of Johnny &amp; Associates),‚Äù and added, ‚ÄúIn the meantime, there will be no change in the current contracted talent who are performing in the future. We will continue to monitor the situation closely,‚Äù he said. Regarding future appointments, he said, ‚ÄúWe will make an appropriate decision while keeping a close eye on how the Johnny&#x27;s will improve human rights and how it will make steady progress in this area.
On March 5, 2024, they held a briefing for the press on the April programming lineup and said that it would ‚Äúcontinue to solemnly continue‚Äù the use of talent belonging to Smile-Up. (formerly Johnny &amp; Associates).

====== TV Asahi ======
On September 26, 2023, Hiroshi Shinozuka, president of TV Asahi, announced that he had asked the office to consider changing the company name, compensate the victims, and take thorough measures to prevent recurrence. He also stated that he did not believe that there was any problem with the talent himself regarding his appearance on the program, and explained that there would be no change in the policy of making a comprehensive judgment based on the program&#x27;s planned content.
On March 8, 2024, a briefing on the April reorganization was held, at which Director General Akihiro Okukawa and General Manager Taichi Kono of the Content Organization Bureau took the stage. They said, &quot;We are not aware of any problems with the talent, so we will continue to make a comprehensive judgment based on the content of the project as we have in the past. I believe that Smile-Up. is in charge of compensating the victims, but I would like to ask that you continue to proceed with this matter in good faith and as quickly as possible. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and continue our dialogue with the office&quot;.

====== Nippon TV ======
On September 25, 2023, Nippon TV president Akira Ishizawa announced that the company had made a verbal request to Johnny&#x27;s to change the name of the company and reform the organization. He also made a request in writing for the implementation of measures to prevent recurrence and to create an environment that facilitates the activities of the talents belonging to the company, claiming that relief measures for victims are inadequate. At a press conference on November 27, President Ishizawa revealed that regarding the policy of appointing talents to programs, Executive Director Hiroyuki Fukuda expressed his basic opinion, &quot;We will reconsider once we confirm the progress of the case and the response of the other party, but we will not make any new casting or booking in the absence of such a confirmation&quot;. On the other hand, regarding the continued use, he said, seeking understanding, ‚ÄúWe have also confirmed that Smile-Up is making progress in dealing with the victims. We may have a different way of thinking than NHK.‚Äù At the regular press conference on April 22, 2024, President Akira Ishizawa explained that he is continuing dialogue with both Smile-Up and Starto Entertainment. He said that CEO Atsushi Fukuda visited Nippon TV December of the previous year. He then stated that he was aware that the production site had entered the stage of considering new appointments of talents after receiving reports that the situation was progressing steadily.

==== Establishment of the Victim Relief Committee ====
On 13 September 2023 was announced on the official site the establishment of the Victim Relief Committee &amp; compensation reception desk. The Victim Relief Committee will be entrusted with determining the amount of compensation based on the contents of the declarations made by the victims, as said on the announcement. The committee is composed of three lawyers with no ties to Johnny&#x27;s Office, nor to the victims seeking compensation. On 2 October, an external Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) will be appointed to formulate and implement basic policies on human rights and develop internal rules. According to the site, the agency plans to announce more specific measures based on the recommendations of the Special Team for Recurrence Prevention. In addition, the agency promised to not receive remuneration for the talent&#x27;s program and commercial advertisement appearances for one year, with all income going directly to the artist.

==== Lawsuit against Smile-Up, and the counterlawsuit ====
Two ex-Johnny&#x27;s members filed a lawsuit in U.S. for 300 million dollars over sexual assault. Junya Tanaka, 43, and Kyohei Iida, 37, filed a lawsuit in Clark County, Nevada. According to the lawsuit, Tanaka, then 15, had accompanied Kitagawa to Las Vegas in 1997, when he was molested by Kitagawa in the hotel. Iida claimed the same happened to him in 2002. Smile-Up responded that they would proceed, consulting their lawyers in the U.S. In February 2025, Smile-Up filed their own lawsuit against the two, and two other claimants. Smile-Up&#x27;s lawsuit said the three victims&#x27; refusal to accept the framework should absolve the company of paying compensation to them. For the other victim, the company is seeking confirmation that it has no obligation to pay more than the amount of compensation offered by the relief committee. Tanaka and Iida held a press conference on February 6. At the news conference, Tanaka emphasized that Smile-Up‚Äôs lawsuit was filed shortly after it became clear that the company had been sued in the United States. Yuko Atsumi, a lawyer representing the victims, said Smile-Up is unilaterally imposing its own framework on the victims. She also said the lawsuit could be a means of preventing victims from taking legal action in the United States. A representative of Smile-Up told The Asahi Shimbun that the company intends to proceed with compensation payments in accordance with decisions of the victims relief committee. In November 2024, the company sued Shimon Ishimaru, 57, former deputy chief of the Johnny‚Äôs Sexual Assault Victims Association, dissolved in September 2024. The company is seeking confirmation that it does not have to pay more than 18 million yen in damages to Ishimaru, the figure proposed by the victims relief committee.

Regarding the Shimon Ishimaru lawsuit, on February 13, a trial started at the Saitama District Court in which SMILE-UP. filed a request for confirmation of non-existence of debt. Ishimaru had asked Smile-Up for compensation of about 1.8 billion yen, but Smile-Up offered 18 million yen. The difference between both remained unresolved, and Smile filed a civil suit to confirm that Ishimaru&#x27;s liability for multiple damages did not exceeded 18 million yen. At the first oral argument held in December last year, Ishimaru asked for compensation of about 180 million yen, a midpoint between the two amounts. On that day, he was preparing for his argument, and the judge questioned him about the evidence he had submitted so far, and asked him to submit additional documents. Preparations for the next hearing will be held behind closed doors, followed by public oral arguments. Revising the case, after the court asked Ishimaru to submit a breakdown of the original claim amount, he decided to request 2.2 billion yen. Ishimaru said, &quot;I was willing to go down to 180 million yen if they were willing to negotiate&quot;, but when the negotiations broke down, I decided to claim the full amount&quot;. Regarding the difference between the original claim and the revised amount, Ishimaru said that he was only considering adding the legal costs, which could amount to about 400 million yen.

===Media blacklisting investigation===
For years, Johnny &amp; Associates has been suspected of having connections with the mass media to produce extensive and favorable coverage on the company, its acts, and Kitagawa, while reducing coverage on anything perceived to be a threat to their image and sales. An example noted by journalists mention that Kitagawa would threaten to withdraw his talent from certain music programs and channels if they provide unfavorable coverage or invite competing boy bands from other agencies.

On July 18, 2019, Johnny &amp; Associates was investigated by the Fair Trading Commission for potentially violating the Anti-Monopoly Act due to accusations of pressuring the media to reduce coverage on Atarashii Chizu, a group made up of former SMAP members Shingo Katori, Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, and Goro Inagaki. Despite lack of hard evidence, Johnny &amp; Associates received a warning.

====Press conference reporter blacklisting====
On October 2, 2023, during a press conference addressing sexual assault allegations Johnny &amp; Associates staff were videorecorded holding documents with lists labelled &quot;NG (no good) Reporters,&quot; with at least 6 portrait photos and their corresponding seat numbers. According to the NHK the documents were brought in by FTI Consulting, a United States-based consulting company hired by Johnny &amp; Associates to manage the press conference, to blacklist specific media reporters. During the conference each media outlet was allowed one question after being picked by the moderator.

On October 4, 2023, Johnny &amp; Associates denied involvement, stating &quot;No one from our company has seen anything.&quot; Inohara on seeing the blacklist during a rehearsal meeting between Johnny &amp; Associates and FTI Consulting staff reportedly pushed back, saying &quot;What does this mean? It&#x27;s no good if we don&#x27;t call on everyone.&quot; On October 5, 2023, Johnny &amp; Associates issued a press release stating a media blacklist was never produced nor requested by their staff. When asked to issue an apology FTI Consulting allegedly countered that they can only do so once it is cleared by their main office in the US.

On October 5, 2023, FTI Consulting admitted the existence of the &#x27;blacklist&#x27; as well as a candidate list of &quot;preferable&quot; reporters. According to the firm the lists were given to the conference moderator. Mutual concerns over reporters who could spend long periods of time talking about their own opinions, or ask thoughtless questions (or remarks) that could be unnecessarily stressful, painful, and/or uncomfortable to the victims who are watching the conference was given as a reason to create the blacklist. Contradicting Johnny &amp; Associates&#x27; claims FTI stated both parties confirmed their policy on conducting the press conference.

The press conference attracted criticism from journalists, broadcasters, and politicians at a time when Johnny &amp; Associates was attempting to mend its public image and relationship with the media. Arc Times editor Toshihiko Ogata who was attending commented &quot;As expected, it was a rigged press conference. We also got ahold of this list and are waiting for a formal response. I think it&#x27;s amazing that the NHK was able to capture that footage.&quot; Sh≈´kan Bunshun journalist Ry≈´tar≈ç Nakamura commented &quot;This is a total out. With this it&#x27;s obvious that their unscrupulous ways haven&#x27;t changed. &#x27;We didn&#x27;t know&#x27; or &#x27;a third-party was responsible&#x27; is not valid.

At the September 7 press conference attended by Noriyuki Higashiyama, Yoshihiko Inohara, and former president Julie Keiko Fujishima attracted a great deal of public attention and was broadcast live on almost all television stations in the afternoon. The total household viewership of NHK and four commercial broadcasters in the Kanto region, where the press conference was broadcast, exceeded 20%. At this high-profile press conference, Tokyo Shimbun reporter Isoko Mochizuki, who is said to have been on the blacklist, persistently asked Noriyuki Higashiyama if he himself had been victims of sexual assault.

Sociologist Noritoshi Furuichi complained about the question, saying that this was an act of outing in public and an extremely ugly comment based on onlookers&#x27; guts that could lead to second rape. Furuichi also criticized the Tokyo Shimbun, saying that if the newspaper is supposed to be a media outlet that respects human rights, but is allowed to violate the human rights of individuals for the sake of the greater good as ‚Äúthat&#x27;s what reporters do,‚Äù then it is no different from the Japanese media during World War II.

==Company renaming==

Several Japanese news outlets reported on October 1, 2023 that Johnny &amp; Associates was considering creating a new company to manage its performers, while the current Johnny &amp; Associates would change its name and continue to exist for the purpose of compensating abuse victims. It was also reported that Noriyuki Higashiyama, who became the head of Johnny &amp; Associates after the resignation of Julie K. Fujishima, was also expected to head the new company. On October 2, Johnny &amp; Associates held a press conference to outline their plans, announcing that they would be renaming the current company to Smile Up‚Äìtaking a name that they had used in their 2020 charity project‚Äìeffective October 17. Smile Up will continue to exist under the ownership of Fujishima and will eventually close down once all sexual abuse compensation requests, which numbered 325 at the time of the announcement, have been processed. On November 22, 2023 the company began to compensate the first 35 victims of the sexual harassment scandal while Smile-Up! received reports from 834 people until November 22, 2023 claiming to be harassed by Kitagawa.

Higashiyama told reporters that performers working under the new, yet-to-be-named management company &quot;will have the freedom to pursue their own career paths without being restricted or entirely dependent on the company.&quot; It was also announced that anything bearing the name &quot;Johnny&quot;, such as related companies and company sections like Johnny&#x27;s Island and J-Storm and performing groups such as Johnny&#x27;s West and Kanjani Eight, would undergo changes to remove any trace of the Johnny&#x27;s name. Higashiyama said that &quot;all things with the Johnny&#x27;s name will have to go,&quot; while Fujishima, who did not attend the October 2 press conference, said that she wanted to &quot;erase all that remains of Johnny from this world.&quot;

It was revealed on December 8, 2023, that the new artist management company would be called &quot;Starto Entertainment&quot;, a name fusing the word &quot;star&quot; and the hiragana „Å® (to), with the meaning for the latter to be &quot;toward the future&quot;. The name of the new company was decided after reviewing 140,156 fan applications. Higashiyama was to replace Fujishima in both the new artist management company, as well as in the presidency of the original, but Higashiyama declined the role in the new one. Atsushi Fukuda, president of a consulting company, was appointed as president of Starto.
==Trainees==
Trainees under the former company name of Johnny &amp; Associates were known as Johnny&#x27;s Jr. and have traditionally performed on Johnny&#x27;s related variety shows and as backup dancers for the agency&#x27;s groups. However, in recent years select Junior groups have taken on levels of visibility akin to mainstream senior acts, including national commercial sponsorships, solo concerts, national tours, and starring film and television roles.

<text>Charles Winnans Cox (July 7, 1882 - March 28, 1958) was a politician and timber contractor in Ontario, Canada. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing the riding of Port Arthur from 1934 to 1943 and the riding of Fort William from 1948 to 1951. He was a member of Mitchell Hepburn&#x27;s cabinet from 1936 to 1937. He also served as mayor of Port Arthur, Ontario from 1934 to 1948 and again in 1952.

==Background==
He was born on a farm in Westminster Township, Middlesex County, Ontario and worked as a farm and ranch hand near Nanton, Alberta. In about 1908 he moved to Port Arthur, Ontario. He became one of the largest timber contractors in the Thunder Bay region, then branched into general contracting.

==Politics==
He was elected as a councillor of Port Arthur in 1932, and became mayor in 1934. He served as mayor until 1948, being re-elected for 15 years.

A supporter of the Conservative Party while they were in power, he sought the Liberal nomination for Port Arthur riding for the June 1934 provincial election, and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario with 58.9% of the votes cast. Liberal Premier Mitchell Hepburn named him to cabinet as a minister without portfolio in December 1936.

Any chances of remaining a cabinet minister vanished in February 1937 when one of his love affairs went sour, and a 32-year-old teacher threw acid at him, scarring his handsome face and impairing the sight in his left eye. The scandal did not hurt him locally, and he was re-elected in the October 1937 election, but not re-appointed to cabinet.

He was defeated as a Liberal candidate in the 1943 election, and as an Independent in the 1945 election.

Always an unpredictable and controversial figure, he astonished most observers by running and getting elected in the neighbouring riding of Fort William, Ontario in the 1948 election as a Liberal candidate. That same year, still the retiring mayor of Port Arthur, he brazenly ran for mayor of Fort William, but lost to Hubert Badanai.

He ran in the 1950 Ontario Liberal leadership convention, placing sixth with 24 votes. He was defeated in the 1951 election. His last political victory came in 1952 when he was again elected as mayor of Port Arthur.

The death of his wife in July 1953 marked the end of his political career. He died in March 1958, tending furnace in a building he owned. A reporter for the &quot;Port Arthur News-Chronicle&quot; observed at his death,

:An astute if unruly mayor he was once described as a man always in or on the brink of a consummate rage. Under a robust growth of steely-gray hair, his corrugated features approximated those of a truculent bulldog. He had the self-assurance of a man used to victory at the polls and was given to taunting his opponents with a tongue like a flame-thrower. &quot;I can be mayor of Port Arthur as long as I wish&quot;, he said not long before his voluntary retirement from that position. &quot;Do you think any other mayor is talked about as much as I am.&quot;

<text>Knocking on wood (also phrased touching wood or touch wood) is an apotropaic tradition of literally touching, tapping, or knocking on wood, or merely stating that one is doing or intending to do so, in order to avoid &quot;tempting fate&quot; after making a favorable prediction or boast, or a declaration concerning one&#x27;s own death or another unfavorable situation.

== Origin of use in the English language ==
There are connections between ancient spirituality and trees influencing fortune. In the pre-Christian beliefs of the Germanic people, for example, three Norns send fate up into the universe through a tree. Languages descended from these people include concepts such as &quot;knock on wood&quot;, &quot;touch wood&quot; or &quot;three times wood&quot;, although only the first two expressions are in the descended English language specifically. Meanwhile, the ancient Celtic peoples also believed that the act of touching wood called on spirits or gods of the trees. Christians tie the practice to the symbolism of the wood of the cross of crucifixion. Folklore researcher Steve Roud suggests that the widespread, modern use however derives from a form of tag called &quot;Tiggy Touchwood&quot; in which players are safe from being tagged if they are touching wood.

== Similar traditions across the world ==

* In Azerbaijan and Turkey, when someone hears about a bad thing they usually, along with gently pulling one or both earlobes, knock on wood thrice to prevent that happening.
* In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro and Serbia there is also the habit of knocking on wood when saying something positive or affirmative about someone or something and not wanting that to change. Frequently the movement of knocking on nearby wood is followed by / (&quot;I will knock on wood&quot;), or sometimes by / (&quot;I don&#x27;t want to jinx it&quot;).
* In Brazil and Portugal, (&quot;knock on wood&quot;) is done physically; three knocks are required after giving an example of a bad thing eventually happening. No verbalization is required, just the three knocks on the closest piece or object of wood. In the absence of wood, someone can say , to prevent the bad thing to happen. People do not actually believe knocking three times on a piece of wood will really protect them, but it is a social habit and it is polite to do so to demonstrate that one doesn&#x27;t want that bad thing one is talking about to actually happen.
* In Bulgaria the superstition of &quot;knock on wood&quot; ( ) is reserved for protection against the evil, and is not typically used for attracting good luck. Usually people engage in the practice in reaction to bad news, actual or merely imagined. In most cases the nearest wooden object is used (in some areas, however, tables are exempt); if there are no such objects within immediate reach, a common tongue-in-cheek practice is to knock on one&#x27;s head. Knocking on wood is often followed by lightly pulling one&#x27;s earlobe with the same hand. Common phrases to accompany the ritual are &quot;God guard us&quot; ( ) and &quot;may the Devil not hear&quot; ( ).
* In the Czech Republic, the phrase &quot;I have to knock it&quot; () is often said, before knocking on wood, glass, one&#x27;s own teeth, or occasionally, the forehead.
* In Denmark the saying is &quot;7, 9, 13&quot; / (usually accompanied by knocking under a table), as these numbers have traditionally been associated with magic.
* In Egypt, (&quot;hold the wood&quot;) is said when mentioning either good luck one has had in the past or hopes one has for the future. When referring to past good luck the expression is usually used in hopes of the good thing continuing to occur via its spoken acknowledgment, as well as preventing envy.
* In modern-day England the expression &quot;touch wood&quot; is more commonly heard than &quot;knock on wood&quot;.
* In Georgia, a (&quot;knocking on wood&quot;) is performed when one mentions a bad possibility that could take place in future. Usually the person knocks three times. It is also done when one experiences a bad omen.
* In Germany, one finds the expressions &quot;knock on wood&quot; and &quot;three times wood&quot; .
* In Greece and Cyprus the saying (&quot;knock on wood&quot;) is said when hearing someone say something negative in order to prevent it from happening.
* In Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, when someone is saying bad things, the one that hears it would knock on wood (or other suitable surface) and knock on their forehead while saying or (Indonesia), or (Malaysia).
* In Iran, ‚Ääwhen one says something good about something or somebody, they might knock on wood and say (&quot;[I] am knocking on wood to prevent [them]/it from being jinxed&quot;). The evil eye and the concept of being jinxed are common phobias and superstitious beliefs in Iranian culture, and Iranians traditionally believe knocking on wood wards off evil spirits.
* In Italy, (&quot;touch iron&quot;) is used, especially after seeing an undertaker or something related to death.
* In Catalonia, (&quot;to touch iron&quot;) is used, meaning protecting yourself against bad luck.
* In Latin America, it is also tradition to physically knock or touch a wooden object. A variant requires that the object does not have legs (), which rules out chairs, tables and beds. In Argentina men also tap their left testicle, and women grab their left breast.
* In Lebanon and Syria the saying (&quot;knock on [the] wood&quot;) is said when hearing someone say something negative in order to prevent it from happening. It is also largely observed when saying something positive or affirmative about someone or something and not wanting that to change.
* In North Macedonia, &quot;knocking on wood&quot; is a folk belief and people usually do that after someone says something bad to make sure nothing bad happens.
* In Norway the saying is (&quot;knock on the table&quot;).
* In Poland, there is a habit of knocking on (unpainted) wood (which may be preceded by saying ; or simply ; ‚Äì literally meaning &quot;to knock on unpainted wood&quot;) when saying something negative ‚Äì to prevent it from happening ‚Äì or, more rarely, something positive ‚Äì in order not to &quot;spoil it&quot;. In the Czech Republic, this is often accompanied for stronger effect by knocking on one&#x27;s teeth, a piece of building stone, or metal, reasoning that these (as opposed to wood) survive even fire.
* In Romania, there is also a superstition that one can avoid bad things aforementioned by literally knocking on wood (). Wood tables are exempted. One of the possible reasons could be that there is a monastery practice to call people to pray by playing / knocking the simantron.
* In Spain and in France (&quot;to touch wood&quot;) is something that you say when you want your luck or a good situation to continue, e.g. (&quot;It&#x27;s been good all week and, touching wood, the weekend will stay good&quot;).
* In Sweden, a common expression is &quot;pepper, pepper, touch wood&quot; (), referring to throwing pepper over one&#x27;s shoulder and touching a wooden object.
* In Turkey, when someone hears about a bad thing they usually along with gently pulling one earlobe, they knock on wood twice to prevent that happening.
* In the United States in the eighteenth century, men used to knock on the wood stock of their muzzle-loading rifles to settle the black powder charge, ensuring the weapon would fire cleanly.
* In Vietnam a common expression is &quot;tr·ªôm v√≠a&quot;. It is said when a speaker wants the good/positive aforementioned thing will continue, especially when saying some good things about a newborn because they believe if they did not say the words, negative things would happen later.
* In Russia, Estonia and Ukraine, &quot;&quot; (&quot;to knock on wood&quot;) has the same meaning. There is also an expression &quot; (&quot;Tfu Tfu Tfu&quot;&quot;) phrase to represent the sound of spitting similar with Assam in Northeast India. The difference, however, is that the person would have to &quot;spit&quot; with his head turned to the left shoulder which represents &quot;spitting away&quot; bad fortune because it is situated on the left (unstable) side of life.

<text>At Home is an American big-box retail chain of home furnishing stores. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, At Home operates 262 stores in 40 states.

==History==

At Home was founded in 1979 in Schertz, Texas, as Garden Ridge Pottery and was later renamed to Garden Ridge.

Investment firm Three Cities Research became the largest shareholder of Garden Ridge in 1999. 

Garden Ridge filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2004. After the reorganization, the corporation emerged from Chapter 11 in 2005. 

AEA Investors acquired Garden Ridge in October 2011. CEO Lee Bird III joined Garden Ridge in December 2012. Prior to this, Bird was President of Nike Affiliates for Nike Inc., Chief Operating Officer of Gap, and Chief Financial Officer of Old Navy. 

In 2014, Garden Ridge converted all stores to the At Home brand and floorplan. The rebranding project changed the use of orange color for advertising to a soft grey and blue, and added a house symbol for the &quot;o&quot; in At Home. The rebranding cost around $20 million. 

At Home publicly filed an S-1 on September 4, 2015, to go public. 

In July 2021, At Home was acquired by Hellman &amp; Friedman.

In October 2023, Fitch Ratings reported that At Home was nearing a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.

<doc id="1094468" wikidata="Q495642" url="?curid=1094468" title="WE Charity">
<text>WE Charity (), formerly known as Free the Children (), is an international development charity and youth empowerment movement founded in 1995 by human rights advocates Marc and Craig Kielburger. The organization implemented development programs in Asia, Africa and Latin America, focusing on education, water, health, food and economic opportunity. It also runs domestic programming for young people in Canada, the US and UK, promoting corporate-sponsored service learning and active citizenship. Charity Intelligence, a registered Canadian charity that rates over 750 Canadian charities, rates the &quot;demonstrated impact&quot; per dollar of We Charity as &quot;Low&quot; and has issued a &quot;Donor Advisory&quot; due to We Charity replacing most of its board of directors in 2020.

WE Charity is related to other ventures from the Kielburgers, including the for-profit Me to We, which was the title of a 2004 book by Craig and Marc Kielburger, and We Day, a series of large-scale motivational events held in 17 cities throughout the school year.

A scandal arose when the charity was selected by the Canadian federal government in 2020 for a $43.53 million contract to oversee $900 million for the Canada Student Service Grant, but the decision was reversed after ties between the organization and the Trudeau family, including payments to Justin Trudeau&#x27;s wife, brother, and mother, as well as the family of former Finance Minister Bill Morneau, were called into question.

On 9 September 2020, We Charity announced that it was winding down its operations in Canada and selling its assets to establish an endowment that will help sustain ongoing We Charity projects around the world. The announcement also explains that the existing board of directors, the existing Canadian employees, and the Kielburgers would leave We Charity Canada.

In November 2020, a Wikipedia investigation found the Wikipedia article for the WE Charity was illicitly modified by &quot;paid agents who used deceptive online identities&quot; from Israeli online reputation management service Percepto International. The Chief Operations Officer for WE Charity, Scott Baker, denied involvement with the sockpuppetry and Percepto declined to comment.

In November 2021, CBC News reported that the WE Charity misled donors about the school they built in Kenya. &quot;Far fewer schools were built than were funded by donors, a fact that leaked internal WE documents show was co-ordinated at the highest levels of the organization.&quot; WE Charity denied the report. CBC reported that, likely in a &quot;co-ordinated campaign&quot;, a large number of groups and individuals wrote letters and emails discouraging them from reporting the story in the months leading up to its publication. The messages largely came from educators and charities, and included a full-page advertisement printed in several newspapers in September that argued that the news report was not in the public interest. On 8 February 2022, WE Charity filed a defamation lawsuit over the report in District of Columbia District Court.

==History== 
WE Charity (formerly Free the Children) was founded in 1995 by Craig Kielburger when he was 12 years old. Kielburger was reading through the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; before school one day when he came across an article about the murder of a 12-year-old Pakistani boy named Iqbal Masih, a former child factory worker in Pakistan&#x27;s carpet trade who had spoken out against child labour and received death threats for his activism. According to Masih&#x27;s account, he was sold by his parents to a factory at the age of 4 and worked there until he was 10, much of the time shackled to a loom. After the murder of Masih led to an international outcry, Pakistani police said that the killing was not connected to his anti-child labour activism.

One of the Free the Children&#x27;s first actions was to collect 3,000 signatures on a petition to the prime minister of India, calling for the release of imprisoned child labour activist Kailash Satyarthi. The petition was sent in a shoe box wrapped in brown paper. Satyarthi was eventually released. After he was freed, Satyarthi said, &quot;It was one of the most powerful actions taken on my behalf, and for me, definitely the most memorable.&quot; Shortly afterward, Kielburger spoke at the convention of the Ontario Federation of Labour, where union representatives pledged $150,000 for a rehabilitation centre in India. The Bal Ashram centre was built by Satyarthi.

In December 1995, Kielburger embarked on an eight-week tour of South Asia to meet child labourers and hear their stories first-hand. It was on that trip that Kielburger had a meeting with then-Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien, in which Kielburger convinced Chr√©tien to take a public stand against child slavery. In 1999, he wrote &quot;Free the Children&quot;, a book detailing his trip to South Asia and the founding of his charity.

Free the Children initially fundraised for organizations that raided factories and freed children from forced labour situations. When it became clear that the rescued children were being resold by their impoverished families, the organization changed its approach and started building schools in Nicaragua, Kenya, Ecuador and India. The organization later evolved an international development model with projects related to education, water, health care, food security and income generation.

In 2007, at age 25, Craig Kielburger was inducted into the Order of Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007/02/21/order_of_canada_recipients&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the second-youngest Canadian ever to receive the honour. His brother Marc Kielburger was inducted into the Order of Canada in 2010. Ernst &amp; Young and the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, a sister organization of the World Economic Forum, presented the 2008 Social Entrepreneur Of The Year award in Canada to the Kielburgers for their work with Free the Children.

Free the Children rebranded as WE Charity in 2016. The charity runs domestic programs for young people in Canada, the US and the UK, and international development programs in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In September 2017, the organization moved to a new headquarters in downtown Toronto, named &quot;WE Global Learning Centre&quot;. The Centre features a theatre, broadcast studio, and an open concept design.

In March 2020, a significant proportion of the board of directors at WE Charity was abruptly replaced. WE Charity stated that this had been typical conduct, as the contracts had expired naturally, however it was later revealed that the positions were slated to end on August 31, not March.

==Programs==
===Domestic===
Students take part in activities such as food and clothing drives for the homeless, anti-bullying campaigns, and fundraisers to build water projects, and schools in countries where WE Charity works, including Kenya, India, and Ecuador. They also raise money for other organizations and causes, such as children&#x27;s hospitals, the Terry Fox Run, and women&#x27;s shelters.

We Charity partners with the Martin Aboriginal Education Initiative to deliver the &quot;We Stand Together&quot; campaign, promoted as strengthening ties between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Canada by emphasizing Canadian Indigenous history in classrooms.

In August 2019, the federal government announced that it was giving $3 million to WE Social Entrepreneurs initiative, aiming to create 200 &quot;youth-led enterprises&quot; that address social issues at a community level.

===International===
In July 2019, the organization opened its first WE College in Narok County, Kenya. It offered a range of courses to girls of Maasai Mara community. The charity and Me to We formerly carried out activities including school construction and We Day in China. Its purported connection to the Government of China came under scrutiny during the broader government contract scandal, though the organization denied that any relationship existed.

==WE Day==


WE Charity holds an annual series of stadium-sized youth empowerment events called &quot;WE Day&quot;, bringing together tens of thousands of students and educators as part of the yearlong WE Schools service learning program. WE Day has featured notable speakers, such as Al Gore, Elie Wiesel, Martin Luther King III, Kofi Annan, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and performers, such as Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, Lilly Singh, Jennifer Hudson, Liam Payne, Iskra Lawrence, and Naomi Campbell. Tickets are not purchased, but are instead earned by students through service in a local or a global cause. The first WE Day was staged in Toronto in October 2007. The program has since expanded into 17 cities, including London, Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles. As of 2020, WE Day has been scrapped &quot;for the foreseeable future&quot;.

==Me to We==

In 2004, Craig and Marc Kielburger published &quot;Me to We: Finding Meaning in a Material World&quot;. The book included contributions from Oprah Winfrey, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Dr. Jane Goodall, and outlined the tenets of the &quot;ME to WE&quot; philosophy, including the importance of community and the idea of service as a path to happiness.

In 2008, Kielburger co-founded ME to WE, a social enterprise that offers socially conscious products, leadership training and travel experiences. ME to WE donates a minimum half of its profits to its partner organization WE Charity, to support its operating costs and international development work and invests the other half back into growing the enterprise.

== Governance and financials ==
WE Charity is governed by separate Boards of Directors in Canada, the US and UK. The Canadian Board Chairwoman was Michelle Douglas, a Canadian human rights activist. She resigned in March 2020, at the same time as many other board members. Douglas has said publicly since that she resigned because of &quot;concerning developments&quot; at the charity. Board members are drawn from government, academia, business, media and charitable sectors.

Concerns have been raised about the blurred lines between We Charity and Me to We. These blurred lines include both organizations having the same Chief Financial Officer. According to Charity Intelligence, in 2019, We Charity transferred 7% of its revenue to Me to We, a magnitude of revenue transferred from a charity to a related for-profit company that Charity Intelligence has not seen with any other charities. We Charity&#x27;s response to these concerns is that over a 5-year period preceding 2020, even after excluding the value of services and in kind contributions, Me to We contributed a net of $1.3 million more than it received from We Charity.

== Education and WE College ==
In 1998, WE Charity began funding the construction of primary schools in Kenya. In 2003, the organization began partnerships with the Maasai and Kipsigis communities to build schools, hospitals and libraries as well as water, sanitation and agricultural irrigation projects. WE Charity&#x27;s Kisaruni All Girls High School is ranked among the top high schools in Narok County.

In 2017, WE College in Maasai Mara, a post-secondary institution in Enelerai, South Narok County, Kenya, opened its School of Nursing, followed by schools of Clinical Medicine and Entrepreneurial Agriculture, with the intention of later adding schools of Public Health, Technical Studies, Business and Technology and Education. This was the first nursing training program in the region. Nursing was considered especially important in Kenya, where the ratio of nurses to population stood around 25 to 10,000, whereas the Kenyan government recommended 83 to 10,000. As of 2019, all of the nursing school&#x27;s students were women, despite being open to both sexes.

In July 2019, Kenyan First Lady Margaret Kenyatta presided over the official opening ceremony of WE College, where she emphasized the importance of educating girls and women. Also present and speaking were Narok Governor Samuel Tunai, Kenya&#x27;s Chief Administrative Secretary for Interior Patrick Ole Ntutu and Principal Secretary for Department of Vocational and Technical Education Kevit Desai as well as Canadian High Commissioner to Kenya Lisa Stadelbauer, former Canadian First Lady Margaret Trudeau and former Canadian Prime Minister Kim Campbell.

Kenyatta also toured the Baraka Hospital, which is likewise located in Enelarai and includes a level IV trauma center. In 2015, the Narok County District Quality Assurance Team had voted WE Charity&#x27;s Baraka Hospital Maternity Wing the best in the country.

In December 2019, WE Charity hosted Selena Gomez, who had been a supporter of the charity for over six years, along with her friend Raquelle Stevens for ten days in Kenya, While in Kenya, Gomez met students at WE&#x27;s Kisaruni girls&#x27; high school and at WE College, and learned beading with local practitioners.

In 2017, WE charity opened the Agricultural Learning Center in Ecuador&#x27;s Chone village, where students learn to grow produce in the school&#x27;s garden and sell it to local markets as entrepreneurs. WE&#x27;s food security strategy includes introducing teachers and students to crops not commonly grown in the immediate region, including tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, watermelon and pineapple to supplement the locally more typical yucca, cacao, coffee and plantains.

== Work culture ==
Some former employees and volunteers of We Charity have criticized the way they were treated at the organization. Former employees have been prevented from speaking about the organization because of non-disclosure agreements and described being in a culture of fear when challenging internal decisions. In June 2020, Amanda Maitland, a former We Charity employee, said a speech she wrote for a We Schools tour in 2019 about her experiences as a black woman was edited without her approval by a group of mostly white staff members. Maitland said when she tried a few months later to speak up a staff meeting about problems within the organization, she was &quot;aggressively&quot; shut down by Marc Kielburger. In July 2020, Marc and Craig Kielburger apologized &quot;unreservedly&quot; to Maitland on their personal Instagram accounts. The Kielburgers said the editing of Maitland&#x27;s speech &quot;simply should not have happened.&quot; A petition that circulated in July 2020 called on We Charity to take specific anti-racist measures. WE Charity said in a statement to CBC News that it &quot;stands firmly for inclusion, diversity and the equitable, open treatment of all.&quot;

==Government contracts scandal==

In 2020, the federal cabinet of Justin Trudeau selected WE to administer a payment program for the Canada Student Service Grant program, a $900 million volunteer program, for a contract worth $43.53 million. The decision raised questions about the charity&#x27;s ties to the Trudeau family and potential conflicts of interest and why the federal public service could not administer the funds as part of their regular mandate. Prime Minister Trudeau defended the government&#x27;s initial decision to have WE Charity administer the program, saying that the organization&#x27;s networks across the country made it the right choice and WE Charity itself would not profit from the contract.

On July 3, Liberal Minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth, Bardish Chagger, announced that WE Charity would no longer be administering the Canada Student Service Grant program. That same day, the Ethics Commissioner announced an investigation into Trudeau and the decision to have WE Charity administer the summer student grant program. Later it was revealed that Trudeau&#x27;s mother Margaret and brother Alexandre received $250,000 and $32,000, respectively, for speaking at WE events between 2016 and 2020. Two of the daughters of Minister of Finance Bill Morneau were also found to have worked in unrelated work for the charity, one in a paid contract position, and the other as an unpaid volunteer; Morneau did not recuse himself from the cabinet decision for the contract.

Opposition parties have called for a variety of actions including the release of documents related to the charity and for high-ranking Liberals to appear before Parliamentary committees; the Conservatives asked for an investigation by the RCMP. Since then, Michelle Douglas, the former chair of We Charity&#x27;s board, the Kielburger brothers, Trudeau, and his chief of staff Katie Telford have all been scheduled to testify before the Finance Committee. On July 31, 2020, the Government of Ontario announced that it would not be renewing an unspecified existing contract the province had with the WE Charity.

In a detailed report released May 13, 2021, Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion ruled that WE Charity did not receive any preferential treatment from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Dion refuted the claim that WE Charity founders Craig and Marc Kielburger were friends with the Trudeau family, writing, &quot;During the examination, I determined there was no friendship between Mr. Trudeau and the Kielburgers, nor was Mr. Trudeau involved in any discussions with them leading to the decisions.&quot;
He also ruled that Trudeau&#x27;s wife Sophie&#x27;s volunteer work for WE Charity did not constitute a conflict of interest, and that none of Trudeau&#x27;s relatives could have personally benefited from the government&#x27;s contracts with WE Charity.

==&quot;WE Charity v. CBC&quot;==
On February 8 2022, WE Charity&#x27;s New York-based affiliate filed a lawsuit against the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) for defamation. The 230-page complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, where the case was assigned to district judge Randolph D. Moss.

The lawsuit alleges that, in an hour-long piece for its series The Fifth Estate, the CBC broadcast claims by reporters Mark Kelly and Harvey Cashore that the CBC knew to be false, including that WE Charity had exaggerated the number of schoolhouses it had built in Kenya and deceived donors about how their money had been spent. WE Charity accused the CBC of fabricating quotes and using misleading editing to support what WE called a &quot;preconceived narrative.&quot;

Joe Patrice of the Above the Law website, which covers legal news, reviewed the details of the lawsuit and called it a &quot;mirror image&quot; of Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News Network. Dominion Voting Systems, originally a Canadian company, chose to sue Fox News Network in the United States, ultimately settling for $787.5 million. Similarly, WE Charity, whose American operations are incorporated in Williamsville, New York, sued the CBC in the United States, in both instances despite the hurdle of the &quot;actual malice&quot; standard established in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, which is unique to American law and requires that the defendant either knew that or didn&#x27;t care if its representations were false. Pattrice writes, &quot;The CBC produced segments claiming that the charity misappropriated donor money‚Ä¶ it did not.&quot;

On May 4, the CBC&#x27;s attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the case per &quot;forum non conveniens&quot;, saying that it would be more appropriately heard before a Canadian court. WE Charity replied on June 10, countering that the CBC&#x27;s allegations had hindered its fundraising efforts in the United States, where many of its donors are located. On June 27, Judge Moss denied the CBC&#x27;s motion, ruling that the case would proceed in the District Court. Moss rejected the CBC&#x27;s assertion that travel from Canada to the United States was unduly burdensome, and held that the relative ease of modern electronic discovery and document transfer between jurisdictions made the existence of documentary evidence in Canada a negligible hurdle to litigation in the United States. Patrice suggests that, even ten years prior, the CBC&#x27;s motion might have succeeded, and sees the decision as an example of how the rise of digital media is revolutionizing the legal profession.

<text>Collins Bay is a bay and natural harbour, as well as a community, within the western part of the municipality of Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Collins Bay was at one time a small village, but it became absorbed by the city of Kingston. Now Collins Bay consists mostly of residential subdivisions (Highgate Park, Lawrence Park, Ridgewood Estates), a large conservation area (Lemoine Point), Kingston Norman Rogers Airport, and areas of agricultural land. The Collins Bay marina is situated on the bay itself. To the east is a large federal penitentiary, Collins Bay Institution.

Collins Bay was named after the original surveyor of the region, John Collins.

As of the 2011 census, the population in the residential subdivisions is middle class (average income ~100000), mostly married couples or families (mostly 2-4 persons) owning a single-detached house.

<text>Ruapuke Island is one of the southernmost islands in New Zealand&#x27;s main chain of islands. It is located to the southeast of Bluff and northeast of Oban on Stewart Island. It was named &quot;Bench Island&quot; upon its discovery by Captain James Cook in 1770, but has rarely been known by any other name than its MƒÅori name, which means &quot;two hills&quot;.

Ruapuke Island was called Goulburn Island by Captain John Kent, named after Frederick Goulburn, a Government official in New South Wales, but the whalers generally called it Long Island, or Robuck. The island covers an area of about . It guards the eastern end of Foveaux Strait. Notable MƒÅori inhabitants on the island included KƒÅi Tahu chief T≈´hawaiki and John Topi Patuki.

==Geography==
The centre of the island is flat with a height of , and there are hummocks on its north, south and west ends. The island is covered mainly with stunted trees, but also has open scrub land and some low-lying marshland. The island&#x27;s major geographic features include three large bays, the largest of which is Henrietta Bay, in the southwest, named for the brig &quot;Elizabeth Henrietta&quot; which ran aground there in February 1824. The other bays are Lagoon Bay (in the west) and Caroline Bay (in the north west). The small Waitokariro Lagoon lies immediately inland from Henrietta Bay. The three bays are separated by two large peninsulas, and two more peninsulas extend at the northern and southern ends of the island, culminating in North Head and South Head respectively. One of these peninsulas, that between Lagoon and Caroline Bays, is a tombolo. North Head is a cliffy promontory rising to a hummock, high. Close to the westernmost point, on the peninsula separating Lagoon Bay and Henrietta Bay, the island reaches its highest point, above sea level. It is these two hummocks which give the island its name.

The eastern coast is dominated by two long, generally straight beaches to the north, and a series of smaller coves to the south. Between the longer beaches and smaller coves lies an inlet, the mouth of the only river system on the island. A smaller island, Green Island, some in extent, lies off the central east coast, and another small island, Bird Island, which is about a third the size of Green Island, lies west of Ruapuke&#x27;s westernmost point. Other small islets and groups of islets can be found off the coast of Ruapuke. One group of small islets, the South Islets, none of them larger than in size, lie immediately to the south of South Head, and beyond these to the southwest is the similarly sized Hazelburgh Islet group. Between Green Island and South Head is a further small group, the Breaksea Islands. Numerous other smaller rocks and reefs surround the island.

===Geology===
Exposed basement igneous intrusion rocks are found on this rather flat island that are Longwood Suite granitoids in the Median Batholith that bisects Zealandia dividing its Western and Eastern Provinces. These plutonic rocks are part of a former subduction zone on the edge of Gondwana, before Zealandia&#x27;s separation from it; about 260 to 245 million years ago in the case of the dated rocks from the island. 

==Biodiversity==

A species of mygalomorph spider, &quot;Stanwellia tuna&quot;, is known to be endemic to Ruapuke Island.

==History==
The island formerly had a MƒÅori population of 200. Notable MƒÅori inhabitants included KƒÅi Tahu chief T≈´hawaiki and John Topi Patuki, MLC. A mission station was established on the island in 1843 by the Rev Johan Wohlers, but it too is long gone.

The island was the site of several shipwrecks during the latter half of the 19th century, though most were without the loss of life. One exception was the collision of the cutters &quot;Annie&quot; and &quot;Deveron&quot; during a storm in April 1894, which resulted in the loss of two lives. The island and its surrounding rocks and reefs are still a hazard to the fishing vessels which ply Foveaux Strait, itself a notoriously dangerous stretch of water.

Sheep were farmed on the island for some time, though it is now uninhabited, and privately owned by descendants of T≈´hawaiki. The island is notable for its bird life, and it is a breeding site for the endangered yellow-eyed penguin. Cetaceans such as southern right whales may be spotted around the island during migration seasons.

<doc id="1094475" wikidata="Q944257" url="?curid=1094475" title="Codfish Island / Whenua Hou">
<text>Codfish Island / Whenua Hou is a small island () located to the west of Stewart Island in southern New Zealand. It reaches a height of close to the south coast. The island is home to Sirocco, an internationally famous kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç, a rare species of parrot.

==History and names==
The island is one of many geographic features in New Zealand to have a dual place name, consisting of the English and MƒÅori names separated by a slash. The English name &quot;Codfish Island&quot; refers to the endemic blue cod, which is fished commercially in surrounding waters by trapping in baited pots.

The MƒÅori name &quot;&quot; means &quot;new land&quot;, which dates back to the early days of PƒÅkehƒÅ settlement in New Zealand. Responding to concerns and allegations that local MƒÅori women were being harassed by sealers on nearby Rakiura, the local NgƒÅi Tahu rangatira, Honekai, designated Whenua Hou as the site of a new mixed race settlement where early PƒÅkehƒÅ could live with their MƒÅori wives under his protection. This encouraged sealers, such as Thomas Chaseland to move to Whenua Hou, alleviating the issues which their presence had caused on nearby Rakiura and making Whenua Hou one of the first permanent mixed MƒÅori and European settlements in the region.

==Wildlife==
Codfish Island / Whenua Hou is home to southern short-tailed bats, kƒÅkƒÅ, fernbirds, red-fronted and yellow-crowned parakeet (both referred to as kƒÅkƒÅriki), Pacific black ducks and a recently introduced population of m≈çhua.

The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for several species of seabirds, including Fiordland and yellow-eyed penguins, and mottled, Cook&#x27;s and Whenua Hou diving petrels.

== KƒÅkƒÅp≈ç ==
The first kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç were transferred to Codfish Island / Whenua Hou in 1987 from Rakiura in order to provide a safe haven for the birds. Following the eradication of possums and rats in 1998 and the transfer of weka to other islands, the island became a predator-free bird sanctuary and the focus of kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç recovery efforts.

Codfish Island / Whenua Hou provides kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç with a home similar to their original home of Rakiura. As it holds the majority of the breeding population of critically endangered kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç it has become the centre for kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç recovery. In 2002, 24 kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç chicks fledged on the island. In 2009 and 2016, 33 and 32 chicks fledged respectively.

Its most famous resident is Sirocco, a kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç born in 1997; Sirocco became the government&#x27;s &quot;Official Spokesbird for Conservation&quot; in 2010.

As of September 2021, 75 kƒÅkƒÅp≈ç reside on Codfish Island / Whenua Hou.

==Access==
The island is visited by scientific researchers and Department of Conservation field workers along with volunteers working on conservation programs. The sole hut is located at Sealer&#x27;s Bay in the northeast, with access by light aircraft or helicopter. The island is closed to casual visitors and unauthorised landing is prohibited.

<doc id="1094478" wikidata="Q5598997" url="?curid=1094478" title="Great Contraction">
<text>The Great Contraction, as characterized by economist Milton Friedman, was the recessionary period from 1929 until 1933, i.e., the early years of the Great Depression. The phrase was the title of a chapter in the 1963 book &quot;A Monetary History of the United States&quot; by Friedman and his fellow monetarist Anna Schwartz. The chapter was later published as a stand-alone book titled &quot;The Great Contraction, 1929‚Äì1933&quot; in 1965. Both books are still in print from Princeton University Press, and some editions include as an appendix a speech honoring Friedman in which Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke made this statement:

Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you&#x27;re right. We did it. We&#x27;re very sorry. But thanks to you, we won&#x27;t do it again. &lt;br&gt;
‚Äî Ben S. Bernanke 

Friedman and Schwartz argued that the Federal Reserve could have lessened the severity of the Depression, but failed to exercise its role of managing the monetary system and ameliorating banking panics under Fed chairmen Roy A. Young and Eugene Meyer.

The Great Contraction is not to be confused with the Great Compression, which refers to a period beginning around 1940 when (according to some economists such as Paul Krugman) economic inequality declined due to progressive taxation and other policies of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration.

<doc id="1094479" wikidata="Q5621541" url="?curid=1094479" title="Gustavus Adolphus College">
<text>Gustavus Adolphus College ( ) is a private liberal arts college in St. Peter, Minnesota, United States. It was founded in 1862 by Swedish Americans led by Eric Norelius and is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Gustavus was named for Gustavus Adolphus, the King of Sweden from 1611 to 1632. Its residential campus includes a 125-acre arboretum.

==History==
===Founding===
The predecessor to the college was founded in 1862 as a Lutheran parochial school in Red Wing by Eric Norelius. The school offered classes for grade-school children; collegiate courses were not offered until nearly a decade later, but the college uses the earlier date as the year it was founded. Originally named Minnesota Elementarskola (&quot;elementary school&quot; in Swedish), it moved the following year to East Union, an unincorporated town in Dahlgren Township. In 1865, on the 1,000th anniversary of the death of St. Ansgar, known as the &quot; of the North&quot;, the institution was renamed and incorporated as St. Ansgar&#x27;s Academy.

===Renaming===
In April 1873, the college was to be renamed Gustavus Adolphus Literary &amp; Theological Institute in honor of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden once the final location and buildings were secured. A delegation of residents from St. Peter won favor from the founders to relocate there as a result of an economic crisis and the town&#x27;s offer of $10,000 and donation of acreage for a larger campus. Courses were initially to start in the fall of 1875, but slow progress on constructing the first campus building, Old Main, delayed the opening. On October 16, 1876, Gustavus Adolphus College opened at the location that still stands today. It is the oldest of several Lutheran colleges founded in Minnesota. It was founded as a college of the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church. In 1962, it became affiliated with the Lutheran Church in America when the Augustana Synod merged into that body. The Lutheran Church in America merged in 1988 to create the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

===World War II===
During World War II, Gustavus Adolphus College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

===Founding of the Nobel Conference===
The annual Nobel Conference was established in the mid-1960s when college officials asked the Nobel Foundation for permission to name the new science building the Alfred Nobel Hall of Science as a memorial to the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. Permission was granted, and the facility&#x27;s dedication ceremony in 1963 included officials from the Nobel Foundation and 26 Nobel Laureates. Following the 1963 Nobel Prize ceremonies in Stockholm, college representatives met with Nobel Foundation officials, asking them to endorse an annual science conference at the college and to allow the use of the Nobel name to establish credibility and high standards. The foundation granted the request at the urging of several prominent Nobel laureates, and the first conference was held at the college in January 1965.

==Campus==

The college&#x27;s first building in St. Peter, affectionately known as Old Main, originally housed the entire college. The campus, known as The Hill, comprises 340 landscaped acres and features science facilities, computer and language labs, and a large dining facility. The campus includes 33 sculptures by the late Minnesota sculptor Paul Granlund, an alumnus of the college who for many years was sculptor-in-residence.

Every tree indigenous to Minnesota is grown in The Arboretum at Gustavus. In 2009, students founded Big Hill Farm, which grows produce for the cafeteria and aims to connect the campus to sustainable agriculture. In the fall of 2011, a new social science center, Beck Hall, opened on campus.
===Notable buildings===


* Folke Bernadotte Memorial Library
* Alfred Nobel Hall of Science
* O.J. Johnson Student Union
* Lund Center (Athletic complex featuring Gus Young Court and Don Roberts Ice Arena)
* Hillstrom Museum of Art, notable for its collection of American art from the Ashcan School
* The Arboretum at Gustavus Adolphus College
* &quot;Old Main&quot; ‚Äì National Register of Historic Places
* C. Charles Jackson Campus Center
* Over thirty Paul Granlund sculptures

====Old Main====
&quot;Old Main&quot; was the first building erected at Gustavus Adolphus College. Its cornerstone was laid on August 12, 1875. Contracted to O. N. Ostrom and constructed from Kasota limestone, the total cost of the building was estimated at $25,000. Old Main was completed in 1876 and dedicated on October 31. Originally called the School Building, as more buildings were erected, it became known as the Main Building and by 1905 as Old Main.

The building was heated by wood stoves and housed the entire college in the institution&#x27;s first years. It originally contained several classrooms, sleeping quarters for students, faculty, and the president, and a kitchen, dining room, chapel, library, and museum. Until 1920, it was tradition for seniors to gather on the building&#x27;s roof for a sunrise breakfast the morning of commencement.

On its 50th anniversary in 1926, Old Main underwent a renovation from funds provided by the Minnesota Conference. The 1998 tornado destroyed much of the Gustavus campus and damaged Old Main&#x27;s bell tower. In 2005, another renovation was completed; the building now houses the Office of the Chaplains and the religion, political science, philosophy, and classics departments.

A famous ghost story surrounding Old Main is the tale of former Chaplain Richard Elvee of two deceased Gustavus security officers, Harley and Barney, occasionally wandering its halls. At the same time, he composed his sermons on Sunday mornings.

====Christ Chapel====
Christ Chapel is a church in the center of Gustavus Adolphus College. Constructed from March 2, 1959, to fall 1961, the chapel was dedicated on January 7, 1962. Its construction was made possible by gifts from the congregations of the Lutheran Augustana Synod, a predecessor body of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which is affiliated with the college. Ecumenical services are held each weekday and Sunday during the academic year. There is seating for 1,500 people in the chapel, 1,200 on the main floor, and 300 on the balcony. It is the largest seating area on campus.

The chapel and surrounding grounds are adorned by the sculptures of Paul T. Granlund, the former artist-in-residence at Gustavus Adolphus College.

Christ Chapel&#x27;s organ was originally built by Hillgreen-Lane when the Chapel was built. It has been significantly altered in the last 30 years. These renovations, carried out by David Engen and more recently by the Hendrickson Organ Company of St. Peter, include a new console with solid-state combination and relay, moving several ranks of pipes from an antiphonal position in the basement into the main organ above the balcony, restructuring the Swell mixture, and extensive repairs after the 1998 tornado. It has 55 speaking ranks of pipes, played from a four-manual console, and preparation on the new Great chest for a mounted Kornet V stop. The Chapel also houses a small portative organ of three stops on one manual that is used for accompanying and especially for continuo playing in Baroque compositions.

On March 29, 1998, the chapel&#x27;s spire was toppled by the tornado, which left most of St. Peter, Minnesota in ruins. On March 17, 2008, the cross atop the spire was hung from the chapel&#x27;s ceiling during a service marking the 10th anniversary of the tornado.

=== Disasters ===
* On January 8, 1970, the Auditorium was completely gutted by a fire, after which it was not rebuilt.
* On March 29, 1998, the college&#x27;s campus was hit by a mile-wide F3 tornado that broke 80 percent of the windows, leveled nearly 2,000 trees, toppled the chapel&#x27;s spire, and caused more than $50¬†million in damages. This is considered one of the most expensive college disasters in history. There was only one death (not a Gustavus student) despite the tornado&#x27;s widespread path, most likely because most students were away on spring break then. Hundreds of volunteers worked to get the campus back where the students could return after a three-week hiatus. Still, some classes were held in FEMA trailers as some campus buildings were too severely damaged.

==Campus life==

Students and alumni of the college are known as Gusties. Most students live in one of 14 campus residence halls or college-owned houses/apartments; a small minority live in theme areas such as the Carlson International Center, CHOICE substance-free housing, and the Swedish House. Students with permission from the college may choose to live off campus, in St. Peter, or elsewhere.

The college has an independently operated dining service, serving the Market Place cafeteria, Courtyard Cafe, and Steamery Cafe. 

=== Traditions ===
Gustavus traditions include traying down the hill from Old Main in the winter, random Gustie Rousers, stargazing on top of the academic building Olin, playing tennis in the Bubble, and streaking through The Arboretum at Gustavus. Gustie traditions are mostly exclusively known by Gusties.

=== Student organizations ===
There are more than 120 special interest groups and organizations at Gustavus, and students are very engaged on campus. Active student organizations on campus have included Model United Nations, the National Forensics Debate team, and the Gustavian Society of Filmmakers. Students are encouraged to create clubs or teams and apply to the Student Senate for funding.

Nearly one-fifth of students are active in Greek life. Ten recognized Greek organizations are on campus (some have been suspended and are no longer recognized by the college).

One prominent campus organization is the Campus Activities Board (CAB). CAB&#x27;s mission statement is to &quot;enrich the campus life experience by encouraging the involvement of all students in engaging and enjoyable entertainment&quot;. All students on campus are part of the Campus Activities Board and eligible to participate in activities, serve on committees, and apply for the Executive Board. There are 11 executive positions, not including the co-presidents and the advisor.

=== Music ===
Many musical ensembles perform throughout the year, including the Gustavus Choir, the Choir of Christ Chapel, the Lucia Singers, the Gustavus Adolphus Symphony Orchestra, the Gustavus Wind Orchestra, and the Gustavus Jazz Ensemble.

In 1942, Percy Grainger, writing in The Musical Quarterly, publicized the &quot;pathbreaking activities&quot;‚Äîas an historically appropriate ensemble‚Äîof the college&#x27;s &quot;A Capella Choir&quot; and chamber orchestra, which toured a series of concerts of music from the 13th to 20th centuries. He praised the &quot;rare value&quot;, &quot;practical skill&quot; and &quot;subtle esthetic intuition&quot; of conductor G. Adolph Nelson.

Grainger had an opportunity to observe the work of Nelson, the choir, and the orchestra at close quarters by touring and performing with them that year. Nelson was the college&#x27;s musical director from 1930 to 1945 and the driving force behind a group that toured the eastern states, winning critical acclaim and financial success. He was particularly concerned about reviving and sharing the chapel&#x27;s music, including voices and instruments that supported them, including organ, brass, and strings. &quot;Nelson, through his dedication to choral singing and Gustavus Adolphus College, his innate musicality, and his pioneering spirit, gave birth to the ensemble now known as the Gustavus Choir.&quot;

=== Theatre and dance ===
Gustavus has a very active theatre program. Theater and dance events are a vibrant part of Gustie life, with shows every fall and spring and a musical every other year. Students do not need to be a part of the theatre program to audition for plays. The Gustavus Dance Company and the Apprentice Company hold open auditions and perform a fully produced set of work.

=== Art ===
There are two art galleries on campus, the Hillstrom Museum of Art and the Schaefer Art Gallery.

===Study abroad===

The college&#x27;s study abroad program has included internships at BNU-HKBU United International College in Zhuhai, China. Gustavus is also a member of the Intercollegiate Sri Lanka Education (ISLE) consortium, run by Bowdoin College.

==Athletics==
Gustavus is a founding member of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC). Key sports at the college are tennis, swimming &amp; diving, golf, basketball, ice hockey, football, and soccer. The school&#x27;s team name is the Golden Gusties, represented by a lion mascot because Gustavus Adolphus was known as &quot;The Lion of the North.&quot; Gustavus has had three players selected in the NFL Draft: Russ Buckley in 1940, Kurt Ploeger in 1985, and Ryan Hoag in 2003. On March 26, 2014, Gustavus announced it would not continue its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Nordic skiing team. Gustavus&#x27;s main rivals are St. Olaf College and Macalester College.

They won the 2023 NCAA Division III National Championship with a 2‚Äì1 victory over Amherst College. Five women alumni who played ice hockey at Gustavus have gone on to represent the United States at the 2016 Women&#x27;s Bandy World Championship, and one represents the Unified Korean team at the 2018 Winter Olympics.
* The Gustavus men&#x27;s tennis team has made 11 consecutive appearances at the NCAA Division III National Championships. Gustavus Adolphus College hosted the 2013 USTA/ITA Midwest Regional Championships at the Swanson Indoor Tennis Center and Brown Outdoor Courts in St. Peter, Minnesota. In 2003, Steve Wilkinson&#x27;s squad placed third at the NCAA Division III Championships as well as a first-place finish at the ITA Indoor Championships. Steve Wilkinson retired in 2009 as the winningest coach in college tennis history with a record of 929‚Äì279. Gustavus player Eric Butorac closed out his senior season of 2003 by winning both the NCAA Division III singles and doubles championships, with Kevin Whipple as his partner. In 2003, Eric Butorac turned pro. He was a doubles specialist before retiring in 2016 and achieved success as the no. Three-ranked American doubles player for multiple years before retiring.

===Directors&#x27; Cup===

Gustavus placed 81st in the 2018‚Äì19 Learfield Sports Directors&#x27; Cup standings. The Directors&#x27; Cup is the only all-sports competition in intercollegiate athletics. In Division III, standings are based on national tournament finishes in 18 sports. In 2002‚Äì03, Gustavus placed a school-best 6th in the Directors&#x27; Cup standings.

==Media==
Gustavus Adolphus College is home to several publications and broadcasters:
* &quot;The Gustavian Weekly&quot;, first published in 1920, is the campus newspaper. Its predecessor was the &quot;College Breezes&quot;. In addition, there were various other names for the student paper from June 1891 into 1902.
* &quot;Firethorne&quot; is an arts and literary magazine published twice yearly. Students submit short stories, poetry, creative nonfiction, photography, visual art, or other creative content.

<text>Berwick Forest is a large &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; (Pine) plantation at Berwick in New Zealand, around 40¬†km west of Dunedin. The forest lies close to the banks of the Waipori River immediately below and around the western end of Lake Mahinerangi, and consists of three blocks - the main block, Maungatua, and Waitahuna, with a total area of 13,141 hectares. The land is owned by Otago Land Company, a sub company of Boston-based investment company GMO LLC, the trees by Wenita Forest Products, which has shareholders Sinotrans (62%), the Chinese shipping company, and GMO.

The forest is popular with hunters from Otago, with both deer and wild pigs that have escaped from farms as common prey. The forest surrounds the Otago Youth Adventure Trust&#x27;s Berwick Lodge.

The forest was subject to a large forest fire in the late 1990s that destroyed several square kilometres of trees, and caused NZ$12 million (US$7 million) worth of damage. The cause of the fire was thought to have been sunlight shining through discarded glass.

<doc id="1094487" wikidata="Q4941108" url="?curid=1094487" title="Bonalbo">
<text>Bonalbo, a rural village in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia, is located north of Sydney and it is the regional centre of Kyogle and it sits within the Kyogle Council local government area.

The traditional owners of the district surrounding Bonalbo are the Gidhabal people of the Bundjalung nation.

The town&#x27;s name derives from the Gidabal word &quot;bunawalbu&quot; meaning &quot;bloodwood trees&quot;.

==European settlement==
John Donald McLean was the first European to settle in the area. He was a Scotsman who moved his sheep up from the Hunter Valley when the depression hit in 1841. He settled on the &#x27;Bunalbo&#x27; or Duck Creek run. Later he became a major landholder and the Queensland treasurer. He sold to the Robertson family in 1853. The Robertson Land Acts of 1861 opened the territories up to free selectors (small landowners) but it was not until 1887 that the first, Donald McIntyre, took up a section of the old station, although the Robertson family had selected various sections themselves, possibly prior to 1880. It was at this time that cedar-getters first moved into the area.

Bonalbo township later developed on a part of McIntyre&#x27;s holding which fronted on to Peacock Creek. However, the depression of the 1890s drove a number of selectors away, including McIntyre who sold his land to Paddy McNamee. New selectors appeared in the 1900s when McNamee proved the land was arable and when sawmills opened up west of the range. By 1910 there were about 100 selectors in the area living on densely timbered land and with no roads to facilitate access to the wider world. Land was purchased from McNamee and the township was established in 1911 with McNamee building and owning the butcher&#x27;s shop, hotel and billiard room. He may also have built the post office and hall.

== Proposed railway ==
In the 1920s, a railway branch line was intended to connect Casino with Bonalbo but construction was abandoned due to the advent of the Second World War. Historically the town&#x27;s economy was supported by dairy farming and the timber industry. However, both the sawmill and milk factory have been closed for several decades.

== Population ==
In the 2016 Census, there were 371 people in Bonalbo. 74.6% of people were born in Australia and 84.5% of people spoke only English at home. The most common response for religion was No Religion at 28.9%.

== Facilities ==
Bonalbo is a very pretty little town, with amenities which are attractive to retirees. The village has a hospital, ambulance station, chemist, supermarket, a Newsagency &amp; service station, a pub with motel rooms, a bowling and recreation club featuring a challenging nine-hole golf course and tennis courts. All amenities are within walking distance of the centre of town. Jacqui Lawrence, a slalom kayaking Olympic Silver medallist, at the 2008 Summer Olympics attended Bonalbo Central School.
A bronze statue of a working dog was unveiled in April 2017. The statue marks Bonalbo as the birthplace of working dog trials, using cattle, at the 1950 Bonalbo Show. It also pays tribute to the role played by working dogs in rural life ‚Äì both as workers and mates. The statue was funded by community contributions and donations from business and government.

<text>Robert Michael Manne (born 31 October 1947) is an Emeritus Professor of Politics and Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s Fellow at La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia. He is a leading Australian public intellectual.

==Background==
Robert Manne was born in Melbourne to parents who were Jewish refugees from Europe. His earliest political consciousness was shaped by this fact and that both sets of grandparents were victims of The Holocaust. He was educated at the University of Melbourne (1966‚Äì69) (BA) (Honours thesis 1969, &quot;George Orwell: Socialist Pamphleteer&quot;) and the University of Oxford (BPhil). He joined La Trobe University in Melbourne in its early years. He served there as a professor in politics and culture until retirement in 2012. He is Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s Fellow and Convenor of the Ideas &amp; Society Program at La Trobe.

Since 1983, he has been married to journalist and social philosopher Anne Manne (n√©e Robinson). He has two daughters, including Kate Manne, a philosopher and an associate professor at Cornell University.

==Contributions==
Manne&#x27;s broad interests include 20th-century European politics (including the Holocaust), Communism, and Australian politics. He has undertaken research in areas such as censorship, antisemitism, asylum seekers and mandatory detention, Australia&#x27;s involvement in the Iraq War, the Stolen Generations, and the &quot;history wars&quot; of the 1990s.

Manne has aligned at various times within the Australian political scene from left to right, then back to left again; he titled a compendium of his political essays &quot;Left, Right, Left&quot;. Between 1989 and 1997 Manne edited the conservative magazine &quot;Quadrant&quot;, resigning when his editorial policies diverged from the views of the magazine&#x27;s management committee. He had originally been appointed based on his previous anti-communist publications and his reputation as a conservative. Some people associated with &quot;Quadrant&quot; during his editorship believed that he was trying to push the magazine to the left. Since leaving the magazine, Manne has criticised it and the editors who came before‚ÄîPeter Coleman and Roger Sandall, and after him‚ÄîP. P. McGuinness and Keith Windschuttle.

In 1996 he published &quot;The Culture of Forgetting&quot;, which explored the controversy surrounding Helen Demidenko&#x27;s 1994 Miles Franklin Award-winning novel about the Holocaust, &quot;The Hand that Signed the Paper&quot;. His book was widely discussed and cited. 

Among Manne&#x27;s other books are &quot;The New Conservatism in Australia&quot; (1982), &quot;In Denial: The Stolen Generations and the Right&quot; (2001), and &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; (2005). He edited the 2003 anthology, &quot;Whitewash: On Keith Windschuttle&#x27;s Fabrication of Aboriginal History&quot;, as a rebuttal to Keith Windschuttle&#x27;s claims disputing there was genocide against Indigenous Australians and guerrilla warfare against British settlement on the continent. Contributors included Henry A. Reynolds, who writes on frontier conflict; and Lyndall Ryan, whose book &quot;The Aboriginal Tasmanians&quot; is one of the main targets of Windschuttle&#x27;s work.

Manne was Chairman of the editorial board of &quot;The Monthly&quot;, a national magazine of politics, society and the arts, from February 2006 until his resignation on 18 August 2011. He wanted to focus on his writing, &quot;including a new blog to be published on &quot;The Monthly&quot;‚Ä≥s website.&quot; Manne&#x27;s departure as chairman resulted in the editorial board&#x27;s dissolution, with &quot;Monthly&quot; editor Ben Naparstek announcing, &quot;We&#x27;re not going to have one any more.&quot; Manne&#x27;s blog, entitled &quot;Left, Right, Left&quot;, had its first post on 12 September.

Manne is also Chair of the &quot;Australian Book Review&quot;, a board member of The Brisbane Institute, and a member of the board of the Stolen Generations Taskforce in Victoria.

==Influences==
Over the years, Manne has claimed a range of political, economic, philosophical, and academic figures as influences from across the political spectrum. These have included Primo Levi, V√°clav Havel, George Orwell, Richard Pipes, Sven Lindqvist, Friedrich Hayek, Eric Hobsbawm, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Joseph Stiglitz.

<doc id="1094491" wikidata="Q6004542" url="?curid=1094491" title="Immaculate perception">
<text>The expression immaculate perception, used by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in his text &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra;&quot; the term pertains to the idea of &quot;pure knowledge.&quot; Nietzsche argues that &quot;immaculate perception&quot; is fictional because it ignores the intimate connection between the perceiver and the external world. He argues that humans are fallible and are capable of using data to ratify or refute perceptions. He also clarifies that perception is value-laden and can be ruled by our interests.

== Concept ==
The term was the title of one of Zarathustra&#x27;s speeches, &quot;Von der unbefleckten Erkenntnis&quot;, which literally means &quot;On Immaculate Knowledge&quot; or &quot;On Immaculate Cognition. Walter Kaufmann who translated it as &quot;On Immaculate Perception&quot;; other scholars also prefer this translation because the main metaphor in the passage is visual perception. 

Nietzsche used immaculate perception in his interrogation of the myths of purity. According to the philosopher, perception is value-laden and ruled by interest; in particular, it denies the important role that the will and desires of the perceiver have on every perception. 

Nietzsche also used immaculate perception in his discussions of the Christian view on sexuality. He attacked the so-called detachment of the &quot;pure perceivers&quot; or &quot;Rein-Erkennenden&quot; (e.g. Kantian view that pure judgments of what is beautiful must be detached), calling it voyeurism. According to him, loving the Earth from afar for these pure-knowers is hypocritical because they too are earthly but there is shame and bad conscience in this love. 

== Applications ==
An example of the immaculate perception principle is Sigmund Freud&#x27;s theory of mental representation, or what some also refer to &quot;copy theory of perception&quot;. He proposed that perception, which he often used interchangeably with &quot;external reality&quot;, is sensory-given and immediately known to the subject; therefore, it essentially involves the passive and temporary registration of an object. Nietzsche criticized this idea of &quot;pure perception&quot; by arguing that human perceptions are not mere copies of the images on the retinas. He maintained that perception is not clean or untainted by the object of perception. People &quot;actively&quot; construct perceived information as sensory modalities select and tend to simplify phenomena so that they merely serve one&#x27;s interest and need.

<doc id="1094495" wikidata="Q3593572" url="?curid=1094495" title="Apostle Islands">
<text>The Apostle Islands are a group of 22 islands in Lake Superior, off the Bayfield Peninsula in northern Wisconsin. The majority of the islands are located in Ashland County‚Äîonly Sand, York, Eagle, and Raspberry Islands are located in Bayfield County. All the islands except for Madeline Island are part of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. The islands in Ashland County are all in the Town of La Pointe, except for Long Island, which is in the Town of Sanborn, while those in Bayfield County are in the Towns of Russell and Bayfield.

==Environment==
&quot;The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore provides regionally diverse and unique plant communities.&quot; &quot;Over 800 plant species occur within the lakeshore, including Wisconsin listed endangered and threatened species.&quot; The Apostles are dominated by boreal forest, composed largely of white spruce (&quot;Picea glauca&quot;) and balsam fir (&quot;Abies balsamea&quot;), often mixed with white birch (&quot;Betula papyrifera&quot;), white cedar (&quot;Thuja occidentalis&quot;), white pine (&quot;Pinus strobus&quot;), balsam poplar (&quot;Populus balsamifera&quot;) and quaking aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;). On Madeline Island, Stockton Island, and several other islands, a unique bog dune ecosystem can be found near deep bays and enclosed lagoons.

According to the National Park Service, &quot;One of the greatest concentrations of black bears in North America is found on Stockton Island in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Bears also regularly inhabit Sand and Oak islands, and, due to their mobility, may be found on just about any of the Apostle Islands.&quot;

&quot;The Lakeshore provides important nesting habitat for the following colonial nesting birds: herring and ring-billed gulls, double-crested cormorants, great blue herons, and cliff swallows. Gull and Eagle Islands combined have 88% of the lakeshore&#x27;s breeding herring gull populations and 80% of the herring gull breeding population on the entire Wisconsin shore of Lake Superior. Eagle Island has the only great blue heron rookery in the park.&quot;

==Sea caves==

Good examples of the sea caves of the Great Lakes are located on the shorelines of the Apostle Islands. Examples include the following locations: Swallow Point on Sand Island, the North Shore of Devils Island, and near Mawikwe Bay on the mainland. Arches and delicate chambers are visible. During the winters, visitors can see frozen waterfalls and chambers filled with delicate icicles.

==History==
Though archeological finds have pointed to traces of human activity as early as 100BC, the earliest known full-time settlers to the islands were Anishinaabe peoples migrating from the east coast beginning in around 950AD, following the waterways comprising the established trade routes that had connected the eastern nations to western nations for thousands of years. Details and stories of these migration were preserved in birch bark scrolls; some can now be seen preserved in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C. As these migrations continued west, they created several prominent settlements, but when the wild rice growing in the marshes of the shallow Chequamegon Bay, they made Mooningwanekaaning (now Madeline Island) their capital, with settlements on Stockton Island and Manitou Island as well as along the shoreline. 

On and around these islands, the Ojibwa people discovered and innovated agricultural advancements, including excavating copper deposits and creating specialized tools for agriculture, hunting and fishing, the use of canoes in rice harvesting, conjugal collaborative farming, and the Three Sisters Crop Complex, enabling the Ojibwa to greatly expand their population, territory and power outward in all directions creating an enormous nation. However, these rapid advances in technology, along with five more centuries of migration from the east, also caused divisive ideological disagreements over traditionalism, and ultimately, the Potowatomi, Ottawa, and other tribes split off, leaving the Ojibwe alone wielding full control over the entire Lake Superior region, with the Islands remaining their current power center, but all the many Mississippi nations&#x27; ancient cultural and spiritual home.

When the early French traders arrived around 1640, the capital city on Madeline Island was given the name La Pointe, and by 1693 it was fortified and included as an official Trading Post city in the Empire of New France, but with the westward expansion of European colonialism, conflicts boiled into formal wars from 1775 onward. Over the next 35 years, as more and more Native populations were concentrated into increasingly smaller areas, these areas became unable to provide sustenance for the swelling populations, and in 1811, the recognized principal Chief Buffalo from La Pointe led an army of Ojibwa to fight in Tecumseh&#x27;s War against the U.S.. However, he had a change of heart and pursued diplomacy when he met Michel Caddotte in Sault Ste Marie, who convinced him that by avoiding violence against the US, he could negotiate better treaties for the Ojibwa people. Though the American flag was hoisted over the Islands in 1816, Chief Buffalo fought decades of the United States&#x27; government and mining and lumber capitalists continual and sometimes deadly efforts to completely remove the Ojibwe people, successfully securing permanent reserves of land including the mainland coastline nearest the Islands for the Red Cliff band, as well as entire reservations for other bands in the region.

The islands were renamed the Apostle Islands by New France historian Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier de Charlevoix, who renamed them after the 12 apostles (for the 12 largest islands).

In 2018, the Apostle Islands were chosen as Wisconsin&#x27;s entry for the America the Beautiful quarters series.

==Islands==
All islands lie in the Town of La Pointe, in Ashland County, unless indicated otherwise.

<text>Philip Nicholson (25 June 1940 ‚Äì 10 July 2005), known by his pen name A. J. Quinnell, was an English thriller novelist. He is best known for his novel &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, which has been adapted to film twice, most recently in 2004 featuring Denzel Washington. Later in life he spent much of his time in Gozo, Malta, where he died.

==Life and work==
Nicholson travelled throughout his life and several minor characters in his books are based on real people that he encountered on his travels. Nicholson was married three times. His last wife, Elsebeth Egholm, is a Danish mystery novelist. The couple maintained residences on the island of Gozo and in Denmark.

When the author was preparing to publish his first book, &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, he wanted to keep his real identity a secret. During a conversation in a bar, his agent, Chris Little, told him he could use a pseudonym. The author chose &quot;Quinnell&quot;, after the rugby union player Derek Quinnell and &quot;A. J.&quot; from the initials of the bartender&#x27;s son. Nicholson frequented Gleneagles bar in Mƒ°arr, Gozo, the town where the Malta ferry disembarks. He could often be found drinking vodkas with soda. He wrote late at night and through until the morning, always standing up. He also sponsored a local Gozo soccer team and was admired by the Gozitans.

The author&#x27;s best-known creation was the character of Marcus Creasy, an American-born former member of the French Foreign Legion. The Creasy novels are cult favorites in Japan.

&quot;Man on Fire&quot; was directly adapted for film twice, in 1987 and 2004. The latter film was adapted into a 2005 Bollywood film. This resulted in a wider demand for Quinnell&#x27;s books, especially those that feature Creasy (listed in the Bibliography below).

<text>A computer font is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs. A computer font is designed and created using a font editor. A computer font specifically designed for the computer screen, and not for printing, is a screen font.

In the terminology of movable metal type, a &quot;typeface&quot; is a set of characters that share common design features across styles and sizes (for example, all the varieties of Gill Sans), while a &quot;font&quot; is a set of pieces of movable type in a specific typeface, size, width, weight, slope, etc. (for example, Gill Sans bold 12 point). In HTML, CSS, and related technologies, the font family attribute refers to the digital equivalent of a typeface. Since the 1990s, many people outside the printing industry have used the word &quot;font&quot; as a synonym for &quot;typeface&quot;.

There are three basic kinds of computer font file data formats:
* Bitmap fonts consist of a matrix of dots or pixels representing the image of each glyph in each face and size. 
* Vector fonts (including, and sometimes used as a synonym for, outline fonts) use B√©zier curves, drawing instructions and mathematical formulae to describe each glyph, which make the character outlines scalable to any size.
* Stroke fonts use a series of specified lines and additional information to define the size and shape of the line in a specific typeface, which together determines the appearance of the glyph.

Bitmap fonts are faster and easier to create in computer code than other font types, but they are not scalable: a bitmap font requires a separate font for each size. Outline and stroke fonts can be resized in a single font by substituting different measurements for components of each glyph, but they are more complicated to render on screen or in print than bitmap fonts because they require additional computer code to render the bitmaps to display on screen and in print. Although all font types are still in use, most fonts used on computers today are outline fonts.

Fonts can be monospaced (i.e. every character is plotted a constant distance from the previous character that it is next to while drawing) or proportional (each character has its own width). However, the particular font-handling application can affect the spacing, particularly when justifying text.

== Font types ==

=== Bitmap fonts ===

A bitmap font is one that stores each glyph as an array of pixels (that is, a bitmap). It is less commonly known as a or a pixel font. Bitmap fonts are simply collections of raster images of glyphs. For each variant of the font, there is a complete set of glyph images, with each set containing an image for each character. For example, if a font has three sizes, and any combination of bold and italic, then there must be 12 complete sets of images.

Advantages of bitmap fonts include:
* Extremely fast and simple to render
* Easier to create than other kinds.
* Unscaled bitmap fonts always give exactly the same output when displayed on the same specification display
* Best for very low-quality or small-size displays where the font needs to be fine-tuned to display clearly

The primary disadvantage of bitmap fonts is that the visual quality tends to be poor when scaled or otherwise transformed, compared to outline and stroke fonts, and providing many optimized and purpose-made sizes of the same font dramatically increases memory usage. The earliest bitmap fonts were only available in certain optimized sizes such as 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 points (assuming a resolution of 96¬†DPI), with custom fonts often available in only one specific size, such as a headline font at only 72 points.

The limited processing power and memory of early computer systems forced the exclusive use of bitmap fonts. Improvements in hardware have allowed them to be replaced with outline or stroke fonts in cases where arbitrary scaling is desirable, but bitmap fonts are still in common use in embedded systems and other places where speed and simplicity are considered important.

Bitmap fonts are used in the Linux console, the Windows recovery console, and embedded systems. Older dot matrix printers used bitmap fonts; often stored in the memory of the printer and addressed by the computer&#x27;s print driver. Bitmap fonts may be used in cross-stitch.

To draw a string using a bitmap font means to successively output bitmaps of each character that the string comprises, performing per-character indentation.

==== Monochrome fonts vis-√†-vis fonts with shades of gray ====
Digital bitmap fonts (and the final rendering of vector fonts) may use monochrome or shades of gray. The latter is anti-aliased. When displaying a text, typically an operating system properly represents the &quot;shades of gray&quot; as intermediate colors between the color of the font and that of the background. However, if the text is represented as an &quot;image&quot; with transparent background, &quot;shades of gray&quot; require an image format allowing partial transparency.

==== Scaling ====
Bitmap fonts look best at their native pixel size. Some systems using bitmap fonts can create some font variants algorithmically. For example, the original Apple Macintosh computer could produce bold by widening vertical strokes and oblique by shearing the image. At non-native sizes, many text rendering systems perform nearest-neighbor resampling, introducing rough jagged edges. More advanced systems perform anti-aliasing on bitmap fonts whose size does not match the size that the application requests. This technique works well for making the font smaller but not as well for increasing the size, as it tends to blur the edges. Some graphics systems that use bitmap fonts, especially those of emulators, apply curve-sensitive nonlinear resampling algorithms such as 2xSaI or hq3x on fonts and other bitmaps, which avoids blurring the font while introducing little objectionable distortion at moderate increases in size.

The difference between bitmap fonts and outline fonts is similar to the difference between bitmap and vector image file formats. Bitmap fonts are like image formats such as &quot;Windows Bitmap&quot; (.bmp), &quot;Portable Network Graphics&quot; (.png) and &quot;Tagged Image Format&quot; (.tif or .tiff), which store the image data as a grid of pixels, in some cases with compression. Outline or stroke image formats such as &quot;Windows Metafile&quot; format (.wmf) and &quot;Scalable Vector Graphics&quot; format (.svg), store instructions in the form of lines and curves of how to draw the image rather than storing the image itself.

A &quot;trace&quot; program can follow the outline of a high-resolution bitmap font and create an initial outline that a font designer uses to create an outline font useful in systems such as PostScript or TrueType. Outline fonts scale easily without jagged edges or blurriness.

=== Outline fonts ===
&quot;Outline fonts&quot; or &quot;vector fonts&quot; are collections of vector images, consisting of lines and curves defining the boundary of glyphs. Early vector fonts were used by vector monitors and vector plotters using their own internal fonts, usually with thin single strokes instead of thickly outlined glyphs. The advent of desktop publishing brought the need for a common standard to integrate the graphical user interface of the first Macintosh and laser printers. The term to describe the integration technology was WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). This common standard was (and still is) Adobe PostScript. Examples of outline fonts include: PostScript Type 1 and Type 3 fonts, TrueType, OpenType and Compugraphic.

The primary advantage of outline fonts is that, unlike bitmap fonts, they are a set of lines and curves instead of pixels; they can be scaled without causing pixelation. Therefore, outline font characters can be scaled to any size and otherwise transformed with more attractive results than bitmap fonts, but require considerably more processing and may yield undesirable rendering, depending on the font, rendering software, and output size. Even so, outline fonts can be transformed into bitmap fonts beforehand if necessary. The converse transformation is considerably harder since bitmap fonts require a heuristic algorithm to guess and approximate the corresponding curves if the pixels do not make a straight line.

Outline fonts have a major problem, in that the B√©zier curves used by them cannot be rendered accurately onto a raster display (such as most computer monitors and printers), and their rendering can change shape depending on the desired size and position. Measures such as font hinting have to be used to reduce the visual impact of this problem, which requires sophisticated software that is difficult to implement correctly. Many modern desktop computer systems include software to do this, but they use considerably more processing power than bitmap fonts, and there can be minor rendering defects, particularly at small font sizes. Despite this, they are frequently used because people often consider the ability to freely scale fonts, without incurring any pixelation, to be important enough to justify the defects and increased computational complexity. These issues are however mostly solved by antialiasing (as described in font rasterization) and the high display resolutions that are commonly in use today.

=== Stroke-based fonts ===
A glyph&#x27;s outline is defined by the vertices of individual stroke paths, and the corresponding stroke profiles. The stroke paths are a kind of topological skeleton of the glyph. The advantages of stroke-based fonts over outline fonts include reducing the number of vertices needed to define a glyph, allowing the same vertices to be used to generate a font with a different weight, glyph width, or serifs using different stroke rules, and the associated size savings. For a font developer, editing a glyph by stroke is easier and less prone to error than editing outlines. A stroke-based system also allows scaling glyphs in height or width without altering stroke thickness of the base glyphs. Stroke-based fonts are heavily marketed for East Asian markets for use on embedded devices, but the technology is not limited to ideograms.

Commercial developers include Agfa Monotype () and Type Solutions, Inc. (owned by Bitstream Inc.) have independently developed stroke-based font types and font engines.

Although Monotype and Bitstream have claimed tremendous space saving using stroke-based fonts on East Asian character sets, most of the space saving comes from building composite glyphs, which is part of the TrueType specification and does not require a stroke-based approach.

== File formats ==
There multiple file formats for each file type.

=== Bitmap font formats ===
* Portable Compiled Format (PCF)
* Glyph Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF)
* Server Normal Format (SNF)
* DECWindows Font (DWF)
* Sun X11/NeWS format (BF, AFM)
* Microsoft Windows bitmapped font (FON)
* Amiga Font, ColorFont, AnimFont
* ByteMap Font (BMF)
* PC Screen Font (PSF)
* Scalable Screen Font (SFN, also supports outline fonts)
* Packed bitmap font bitmap file for TeX DVI drivers (PK)
* FZX a proportional bitmap font for the ZX Spectrum

=== Outline font formats ===

==== Type 1 and Type 3 fonts ====
Type 1 and Type 3 fonts were developed by Adobe for professional digital typesetting. Using PostScript, the glyphs are outline fonts described with cubic B√©zier curves. Type 1 fonts were restricted to a subset of the PostScript language, and used Adobe&#x27;s hinting system, which used to be very expensive. Type 3 allowed unrestricted use of the PostScript language, but did not include any hint information, which could lead to visible rendering artifacts on low-resolution devices (such as computer screens and dot-matrix printers).

==== TrueType fonts ====
TrueType is a font system originally developed by Apple Inc. It was intended to replace Type 1 fonts, which many felt were too expensive. Unlike Type 1 fonts, TrueType glyphs are described with quadratic B√©zier curves. It is currently very popular and implementations exist for all major operating systems.

==== OpenType fonts ====
OpenType is a smart font system designed by Adobe and Microsoft. OpenType fonts contain outlines in either the TrueType or CFF format together with a wide range of metadata.

=== Stroke-based font formats ===
Metafont uses a different sort of glyph description. Like TrueType, it is a vector font description system. It draws glyphs using strokes produced by moving a polygonal or elliptical pen approximated by a polygon along a path made from cubic composite B√©zier curves and straight line segments, or by filling such paths. Although when stroking a path the envelope of the stroke is never actually generated, the method causes no loss of accuracy or resolution. The method Metafont uses is more mathematically complex because the parallel curves of a B√©zier can be 10th order algebraic curves.

In 2004, DynaComware developed DigiType, a stroke-based font format. In 2006, the creators of the Saffron Type System announced a representation for stroke-based fonts called Stylized Stroke Fonts (SSFs) with the aim of providing the expressiveness of traditional outline-based fonts and the small memory footprint of uniform-width stroke-based fonts (USFs).

AutoCAD uses SHX/SHP fonts.

==Subsetting==
A typical font may contain hundreds or even thousands of glyphs, often representing characters from many different languages. Oftentimes, users may only need a small subset of the glyphs that are available to them. Subsetting is the process of removing unnecessary glyphs from a font file, usually with the goal of reducing file size. This is particularly important for web fonts, since reducing file size often means reducing page load time and server load. Alternatively, fonts may be issued in different files for different regions of the world, though with the spread of the OpenType format this is now increasingly uncommon.

<text>The Levant sparrowhawk (Tachyspiza brevipes) is a small bird of prey. It measures in length with a wingspan of . The female is larger than the male, but the difference is not as marked as with Eurasian sparrowhawk. The adult male is blue-grey above, with dark wingtips, and barred reddish below.

It breeds in forests from Greece and the Balkans east to southern Russia. It is migratory, wintering from Egypt across to southwestern Iran. It will migrate in large flocks, unlike the more widespread Eurasian sparrowhawk.

==Taxonomy==
The Levant sparrowhawk was formally described in 1850 by the Russian naturalist Nikolai Severtzov under the binomial name &quot;Astur brevipes&quot;. The species was formerly placed in the large and diverse genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;. In 2024 a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study of the Accipitridae confirmed earlier work that had shown that the genus was polyphyletic. To resolve the non-monophyly, &quot;Accipiter&quot; was divided into six genera. The genus &quot;Tachyspiza&quot; was resurrected to accommodate the Levant sparrowhawk together with 26 other species that had previously been placed in &quot;Accipiter&quot;. The resurrected genus had been introduced in 1844 by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek œÑŒ±œáœÖœÇ (&quot;takhus&quot;) meaning &quot;fast&quot; with œÉœÄŒπŒ∂ŒπŒ±œÇ (&quot;spizias&quot;) meaning &quot;hawk&quot;. The specific epithet combines Latin &quot;brevis&quot; meaning &quot;short&quot; with &quot;ped&quot;, &quot;pedis&quot; meaning &quot;foot&quot;. 

It is sometimes considered to be a subspecies of the shikra (&quot;Tachyspiza badia&quot;), though it differs in measurements, proportions and plumage, and breeds with the latter (typically considered a reliable indicator of speciation) over at least part of its range. Along with the shikra, the Chinese sparrowhawk (&quot;Tachyspiza soloensis&quot;) and the Nicobar sparrowhawk (&quot;Tachyspiza butleri&quot;), it makes up a complex species group. It is known to have hybridised with the shikra and the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Despite its extensive range, no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==

The Levant sparrowhawk is a small raptor with short broad wings and a longish tail, both adaptations to maneuvering through trees. It is similar to the Eurasian sparrowhawk, but its shorter tail and more pointed wings give it a more falcon-like appearance. It is much smaller than most raptors, measuring in length with a wingspan of . As with all birds of prey, the female is larger than the male. The male is blue-grey above and pale below, with underparts and leg feathers finely barred in rufous and white. His head is blue-grey as well, with a white throat bisected by a dark central stripe (sometimes quite faint). The female is slate-grey above with darkish wingtips and is barred reddish brown below and may show a dark throat line. Both sexes have orangish-yellow legs and a yellow cere. The juvenile is dark brown above, has dark-streaked underparts and it shows a dark throat line. 

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===
The Levant sparrowhawk breeds from mid-May through August. The pair is territorial while breeding, often performing high-circling aerial displays. The female is thought to make the nest. She builds a new one every year, a small structure of twigs on a branch or in a fork of a broad-leaved tree. The nest tree is often near running water, typically in open woodland, on a forest edge, or in an isolated clump of trees. The nest, which measures up to across and deep, is lined with green leaves. Most nests are located between above the ground, but they have been found as low as and as high as .

The female lays a clutch of which she alone incubates for . Hatching is . Nestlings fledge some after hatching and are independent about later.

===Flight and migration===
Though able to flap continually (like most birds), Levant sparrowhawks typically use soaring-and-gliding flight while migrating; they also use thermals when those are available, and are known to occasionally hover.

=== Hunting ===
It hunts small birds, insects, rodents, and lizards in woodland or semi-desert areas, relying on surprise as it flies from a perch to catch its prey unaware.

==Population==
According to BirdLife International, Levant Sparrowhawks have a global population size of 8,190-20,400 mature individuals, with 75-94% percent of them living in Europe. It should be mentioned though that it is likely that this is an underestimate due to difficulties with identification and its secretive nature. In Armenia the population of Levant Sparrowhawks is estimated as 180‚Äì220 breeding pairs.

==Conservation and threats==
Because of its vast range and stable population, the Levant Sparrowhawk is listed as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The development of wind farms may affect its numbers.

<text>Oregon Route 99 is a state highway that runs between the southern border of Oregon, and the city of Junction City. Oregon Route 99 was formed from parts of the former U.S. Route 99; it shares much of its route with I-5, but much of it is also independent. Between Portland and Junction City, the highway is forked into two routes: Oregon Route 99E and Oregon Route 99W.

==Route description==
Oregon Route 99 technically starts at an interchange with Interstate 5 at exit 11, south of Ashland. There it departs from the freeway, running parallel to I-5 as it passes through the cities of Ashland (as Main Street), Talent, Phoenix, and Medford. The highway rejoins I-5 at exit 35, just northwest of Central Point.

OR 99 departs from I-5 several more times through the mountains of southern Oregon, only to rejoin again a short distance later. Junctions are found in Gold Hill (2nd Ave), Grants Pass, between Myrtle Creek and Sutherlin (crossing I-5 in Roseburg), through Drain and Yoncalla, and Cottage Grove and Goshen. These departures serve as business routes for I-5, as Oregon does not have or sign Interstate business routes.

When it reaches Eugene, OR 99 departs from I-5 for a final time. It heads west into downtown, along Franklin Boulevard past the University of Oregon. Downtown, OR 99 is on the 6th and 7th Avenue couplet. (Much of the section in Eugene is co-signed with either Oregon Route 126 or OR 126 Business.) West of downtown it heads north on an expressway alignment, which continues to Junction City. In Junction City, OR 99 ends, as it splits into eastern and western forks.

=== Highways comprised ===

OR 99 comprises the following named highways (see Oregon highways and routes) and roads, from south to north:

<text>The Warehouse Group (TWG) was established by Stephen Tindall in 1982 and is the largest retail group in operation in New Zealand. It is a corporate conglomerate that consists of The Warehouse, Warehouse Stationery and Noel Leeming.

==History==
The first Warehouse Group store opened in Wairau Road North Shore, Auckland in 1982. In 1994, Warehouse was added to the New Zealand Exchange under the symbol TWH. In 1996, a distribution center opened on the North Island. In 2000, it was added to the NZSE 10 index. The group acquired Clint&#x27;s Crazy Bargains and Silly Solly&#x27;s in Australia that same year.

In 2003, the Warehouse Australia brand was launched. In 2005, a lab store was launched in the Hamilton suburb of Te Rapa. That same year, the Warehouse brand was relaunched with new lower-case logo, announced its plan to enter the liquor market and that it would end operations in Australia by Christmas. In 2005, Warehouse Australia was sold to Catalyst Investment Managers and Castle Harlan Australian Mezzanine Partners for A$92¬† million (NZ$99m).

In 2006, the Warehouse began selling alcoholic beverages in selected stores and launched a new set of stores branded The Warehouse Extra at Sylvia Park, Auckland, which included full grocery as well as pharmacies, caf√©s, and bakeries. At the time, the stores were considered an unproven experiment and many viewed them as an emulation of the American Wal-Mart model. However, due to supply chain issues, The Warehouse Extra stores were closed in 2009. 

In 2007, the company celebrated its 25th anniversary and marked the occasion by releasing 13,000 balloons, causing concerns from environmentalists. In 2009, the first smaller-concept store, The Warehouse Local, opened in Mosgiel. In 2010, the Warehouse opened a store in Gisborne, New Zealand, the first large format store since the opening of The Warehouse Sylvia Park in 2006. In 2012, The Warehouse ceased its instore pharmacy offer. Later that year, The Warehouse announced it was buying the electronics retailer The Noel Leeming Group for $65¬† million.

In 2013, The Warehouse Group held a one-day online-only sale across all brands in the group called Click Madness. During that same year, the company purchased Torpedo7, No. 1 Fitness, Shotgun Supplements, Insight Traders, and Shop HQ, the latter of which included the online pet retailer, pet.co.nz, and the online baby product company, baby.co.nz.

In 2014, The Warehouse Group bought R&amp;R Sport and SchoolTex. That same year, the company launched The Warehouse Group Financial Services after the takeover of Diners Club NZ. In 2014, the group purchased the New Zealand-based branches of Australian retail chain The Good Guys, turning their five New Zealand-based stores into their various retail brands. In July 2017, The Warehouse Group announced that it intended to sell the Financial Services division that it had acquired in 2014 to SBS Bank for a reported $18¬†million by September. In 2018, the group purchased the Appliance Shed brand to create the Noel Leeming Clearance Centre brand. In 2019, the company launched TheMarket, a new online marketplace selling local and international brands.

In June 2020, The Warehouse Group announced that 1,080 jobs would be lost as a result of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. The company also announced that it would be closing down six stores including The Warehouse stores in Whangaparaoa, Johnsonville, Dunedin, the Warehouse Stationery in Te Awamutu, and the Noel Leeming stores in Henderson and Tokoroa.

On 20 July 2020, the company&#x27;s COO Pejman Okhovat announced that between 500 and 750 jobs may be lost due to a proposed restructuring of the company. First Union general secretary Dennis Maga criticized the company for using COVID-19 as an excuse to lay off hundreds of workers and to reduce the incomes of thousands of employees.

On 21 December, The Warehouse Group announced that it was in a &quot;confident enough position&quot; to repay its NZ$67.8¬† million COVID-19 wage subsidy to the Government.

From early 2021, all Warehouse stores across the country stopped selling physical media including DVDs, Blu-Rays, CDs, and Vinyl Records. In May 2021, The Warehouse Group announced that fireworks would no longer be sold at The Warehouse stores. Jewellery counters also began to close in July 2021.

Since 2023 The Warehouse has been trialling selling fresh fruit and vegetables.

In late 2023, Sanitarium stopped supplying The Warehouse with Weet-Bix due to alleged supply issues. The Warehouse asked the Commerce Commission to investigate, and Sanitarium revoked the move the following week. In March 2024 the Commission said that it was &quot;not clear that Sanitarium breach[ed] ... the Commerce Act&quot; and that it would not &quot;prioritize the matter for further investigation&quot;. As a result, chief executive Grayston said he was &quot;very disappointed&quot;. 

In February 2024, The Warehouse Group sold Torpedo7 for $1 to Tahua Partners.

==Business==
The Warehouse operates discount retail department stores selling a broad range of non-grocery and grocery products. As of January 2015, The Warehouse employed over 12,000 people in New Zealand. The Warehouse&#x27;s corporate headquarters are located in North Shore, New Zealand.

The company operates from over 240 retail locations, as well as two distribution centers located in Wiri and in Rolleston, New Zealand, and 13 online stores.

In addition to its operations, it owns various brand names that are located within the stores. It has gardening facilities located in Auckland, Hamilton and in Christchurch. Along with its gardening brand Just, it also operates nearly 30 in-company brands.

The Warehouse is publicly traded on the New Zealand Stock Exchange with the security code WHS (previously TWH).

===Criticism===
In May 2007, the company released 13,000 balloons from Dairy Flat to mark its 25th anniversary. This sparked concerns from the Department of Conservation and other environmentalists as the balloons had been known to endanger wildlife.

In December 2009, it was announced that The Warehouse staff would be taking industrial action due to issues with staff having their hours extended to 50-hour weeks in the lead-up to Christmas and staff having to work late at night.

In December 2018, Noel Leeming was fined $200,000 for misleading consumers about their rights under the Consumer Guarantees Act (CGA) following a Commerce Commission prosecution. Noel Leeming was convicted on eight charges under the Fair Trading Act.

In March 2020, The Warehouse Group drew criticism when its directors prematurely announced that they were an essential service during the COVID-19 pandemic without consulting with the Government. The company faced a fine of NZ$500,000 if it was found to have breached the New Zealand Exchange&#x27;s disclosure rules or found to have profited from a rise in its share price stemming from the announcement. The company subsequently shut down its brands for the duration of the four-week lockdown with all staff being given full paid leave.

In early June 2020, The Warehouse Group was criticized by First Union coordinator Kate Davis for allegedly not consulting employees about a plan to lay off 1,080 workers and close six stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Return policy===
The company operates a comprehensive returns policy. A &quot;60-day money-back guarantee&quot; policy with returns accepted for any reason is available on most products, excluding underwear, pre-recorded media, and perishable products.

===Australian expansion===
In 2000, the company entered the Australian retail market. It acquired the Clint&#x27;s Crazy Bargains and Silly Solly&#x27;s retail chains. At the time of purchase, those chains had around 117 stores.

In 2003, the company built a $33¬† million (AUD) distribution centre in Queensland to service the country. Later that year, the company introduced its Tui and Tolas inventory management systems from New Zealand.

As of 2005, the Australian arm was still under-performing. Sales for 2005 were at $518.8¬† million (AUD) compared with $567.3¬† million (AUD) in 2004. The Warehouse Group Limited announced in November 2005 that it had entered into a conditional agreement to sell The Warehouse Australia business to Catalyst Investment Managers and its parent PPM Capital Limited (together, Catalyst) and Castle Harlan Australian Mezzanine Partners, acting on behalf of the CHAMP I and CHAMP II funds (CHAMP) for A$92¬† million (NZ$99m). The new entity was known as Australian Discount Retail (ADR). As part of the transaction, The Warehouse Australia&#x27;s Sydney Head Office would be sold to Investec Wentworth Specialised Property Trust. While the effective date for the transaction was due to be 27 November 2005, completion of the sale was expected in early 2006 and was subject to normal regulatory approvals.

At its formation, ADR also purchased the discount store operations of Miller&#x27;s Retail, including the Go-Lo, Crazy Clark&#x27;s and Chickenfeed chains. There were 335 such stores at the time of sale.

After the sale of the Australian operation, Warehouse stores were renamed Sam&#x27;s Warehouse.

The operations soon had massive wall-to-wall administrations and management changes culminating in widespread closures, divestments to rivals like The Reject Shop, and mergers of chains until it was finally placed into liquidation by receivers in 2014.

===&quot;The Warehouse Extra&quot; hypermarkets===
In June 2006, The Warehouse Extra opened at Sylvia Park, Auckland. It was the first of a planned chain of hypermarkets, at 135,000 sq ft (12,500 sq m). In a similar fashion to the Wal-Mart Supercenters of the United States, the foodmarket department aisles are placed at a perpendicular angle to the general merchandise. It is the first store to feature an in-store bakery, pharmacy, and caf√©, and instead of the usual tall industrial shelving, a more conventional store shelving system has been used. The store also features a lot less red than in traditional stores, but the familiar concrete floor still exists. The next branches of &quot;The Warehouse Extra&quot; were in WhangƒÅrei and Te Rapa in Hamilton. In October 2008 The Warehouse announced that they would be canning &quot;The Warehouse Extra&quot; format with stores reverting to the more traditional style of the store coming months. There were four of The Warehouse Extra in Auckland (Albany, Manukau, Sylvia Park, and Westgate). Today &quot;The Warehouse Extra&quot; brand is used in larger traditional stores nationwide, with many existing large stores have taken on &quot;The Warehouse Extra&quot; branding such as those in Lyall Bay (Wellington), Riccarton (Christchurch), South Dunedin and Palmerston North. Stores carrying &quot;The Warehouse Extra&quot; brand are typically larger, open later and carry a greater range than regular stores.

===&quot;The Warehouse Local&quot;===
On Thursday 23 July 2009, The Warehouse Group opened the first of its smaller-concept stores, The Warehouse Local, in Mosgiel. These stores are approximately 2000 square meters in size, compared with the usual 5000 square meters seen in larger locations. These stores also have single checkout counters, doing without dedicated Service, Jewellery, and Entertainment counters which are present in most other stores. Another 3 stores were intended to be launched per year, following this concept.

While the &quot;Local&quot; naming is no longer used, smaller stores in Rolleston and St Lukes have opened using the smaller format.

=== Entry into e-commerce===
In 2009, The Warehouse announced its entry into online shopping. The brand&#x27;s full range of products was available online by 2012, in time for the brand&#x27;s 30th birthday.

The brand&#x27;s offerings were also made available on the New Zealand e-commerce platform The Market in 2019.

=== Store within a store===
In 2017, The Warehouse Group unveiled its first &quot;Store within a Store&quot; (shortened to SWAS), with Warehouse Stationery moving into The Warehouse Auckland Airport after their lease at their previous Auckland Airport Mall premises ended.

The Warehouse SWAS stores have many similar features of typical Warehouse Stationery stores, including a range of computers, printers, office furniture, and stationery, as well as a Print &amp; Copy Centre. The Warehouse departments, such as furniture and entertainment, merge in a SWAS environment.

There are currently 25 SWAS Warehouse Stationery Stores operating across New Zealand.

==Active subsidiaries==

The Warehouse Group currently owns three primary brand subsidiaries.

===The Warehouse===
The primary and central store for the Group, founded in 1982 by Sir Stephen Tindall, is known as The Warehouse. It offers a wide range of essential items including sports equipment, gardening equipment, and furniture. Due to their branding and distinctive red-colored buildings, The Warehouse&#x27;s stores are commonly referred to as &quot;Red Sheds&quot; within the organization and in New Zealand. They primarily compete with Kmart in the discount department store sector, as well as with other specialized retailers such as hardware stores like Mitre 10 and Bunnings, automotive parts retailers like Repco and Supercheap Auto, electronics and homeware retailers like Farmers, Harvey Norman and JB Hi-Fi, and grocery stores like Woolworths New Zealand and Foodstuffs.

===Warehouse Stationery===
Warehouse Stationery is a large store containing a variety of different products with a blue color, similar to Officeworks in Australia or OfficeMax in America. It offers a wide range of products across multiple categories, including office supplies, school supplies, fashion stationery, technology, furniture, art &amp; craft, and ink &amp; toner. In the books and stationery market, it competes with Paper Plus and Whitcoulls, while in the electronics sector, it faces competition from retailers such as JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman. In the business and stationery online space, it competes with OfficeMax.

Warehouse Stationery provides customers with a BizRewards membership, allowing them to shop and collect rewards points at both The Warehouse and Warehouse Stationery stores nationwide, as well as online. Additionally, by choosing a Credit Account membership, customers can collect points in-store at Noel Leeming.

The first Warehouse Stationery branch opened in 1991, and the company has since grown from 8 stores in 1995 to 70 stores spanning from Kerikeri to Invercargill as of 2019.

=== Noel Leeming ===
Noel Leeming is a retail electronics chain that specializes in selling a wide range of products, including computers, household appliances, TVs, and audio equipment. With 71 stores, including 20 in Auckland, Noel Leeming offers a larger selection of higher-value electronic goods compared to other chains under The Warehouse Group.

In addition to its retail operations, Noel Leeming operates Tech Solutions, a service that provides support, installation, and learning assistance for technology users. This service caters to both in-store and in-home customers, offering comprehensive electronics and whiteware support.

== Previous subsidiaries==

===The Warehouse Group Financial Services Ltd===
The Warehouse Group Financial Services Limited was a joint venture that was formed in 2001 following the joint acquisition of Diners Club New Zealand by The Warehouse Group and Westpac Banking Corporation.

The Warehouse Group Financial Services Limited provides consumer credit cards and insurance through The Warehouse brand and distribution channels. In the 2014 Annual Report, it is stated that The Group holds a 49% minority share in this financial arm of TW Group with Westpac holding a 51% majority share.

On 1 October 2015 TW Group announced the acquisition of the remaining 51% of TW Group Financial Services from Westpac. The acquisition cost $7.3¬†million (NZD). Later in the release TW Group also announce their plans to expand the unit not by acquisition but by internal expansion.

In July 2017, less than two years following the acquisition from Westpac, The Warehouse Group announced the sale of the financial services division. The division had been slow to return a profit and returned a bigger loss then expected. The division was sold to FinanceNow, a division of SBS Bank.

=== Bond and Bond===

Bond &amp; Bond (stylised as &quot;Bond+Bond&quot;) was a retail electronics store founded by Enoch Bond, in Silverdale, Auckland in 1875. The store opened its first home appliance branch in Auckland in 1894. It was previously a subsidiary of the Noel Leeming Group before the group&#x27;s acquisition by The Warehouse Group in 2012.

The chain had 31 stores in 2008. It had 24 stores in early 2013, including ten in Auckland.

In 2013, Bond &amp; Bond was merged into Noel Leeming as part of a decision to provide a clear focus on the flagship Noel Leeming brand. Bond &amp; Bond remained as an online clearance website until its closure in 2014.

=== R&amp;R Sport===

R&amp;R Sport was an independent outdoor chain established in Dunedin Central in 1981. By 2014, it had 10 stores, including two in Auckland.

In 2014, The Warehouse Group took over the chain and rebranded its stores as Torpedo 7.

===Torpedo7===

Torpedo7 was once a multi-channel subsidiary of The Warehouse Group that owns and operates several online stores, including Torpedo7 (a retailer of sports and outdoor equipment), 1-day.co.nz (an online daily deals site), and Number One Fitness (which sells exercise equipment).

Founded in 2004 by mountain bike enthusiast Luke Howard-Willis and his father, Guy Howard-Willis, The Warehouse Group purchased a 51% stake in the company for NZ$33 million. In October 2014, seven R&amp;R Sport stores, which were previously acquired by The Warehouse Group in December 2013, were rebranded as Torpedo7. This expansion included the addition of two new physical stores, marking Torpedo7&#x27;s entry into the retail of physical stores. In February 2024 The Warehouse Group sold Torpedo7 for $1 to Tahua Partners.

===TheMarket===
TheMarket is an online shopping platform that operates as an online marketplace, offering products from over 250 retailers and brands worldwide. Similar to Amazon, TheMarket provides a wide range of items for purchase. The platform is headquartered in Newmarket, Auckland, and is part of The Warehouse Group&#x27;s digital transformation strategy, which began in February 2017. The initiative aimed to invest in the digital future of retail.

Under the leadership of Chief Executive Justus Wilde, a global online retail expert, TheMarket team started working on the project in early 2018. With a startup mindset, they successfully launched the mobile-first platform on 1 August 2019 after a beta testing period in July. TheMarket collaborated with various retailers and brands, establishing partnerships to offer a diverse product selection.

TheMarket primarily operates using a drop-shipping business model. This means that third-party business-to-consumer (B2C) retailers list their branded products on the platform, and orders are dispatched directly by the retailers themselves. Although TheMarket holds some inventory, its main focus is on facilitating transactions between customers and retailers.

Since its launch, TheMarket has steadily grown its retailer base. Starting with 100+ retailers in August 2019, it expanded to 200+ retailers by November 2019. The platform aims to reach 400+ retailers by early 2020. In November 2019, TheMarket introduced its subscription program called TheMarket Club, which offers benefits such as free shipping, streaming services, and other features inspired by global giant Amazon.

To enhance convenience for customers, TheMarket utilizes an organized network of &quot;MarketPoint&quot; sites within The Warehouse Group&#x27;s existing 242 physical locations across New Zealand. These MarketPoint sites can be found in The Warehouse, Warehouse Stationery, Noel Leeming, and Torpedo7 stores. Additionally, Rural MarketPoint sites are operated by FarmSource in partnership with Fonterra. Currently, there are 72 MarketPoint sites available, and plans are in place to expand to 300 nationwide. MarketPoint sites allow customers to collect and return goods purchased from TheMarket, similar to services offered by Amazon Hub or ASOS.com‚Äôs Click and Collect.

In March 2024 The Warehouse said that it had intentions to either sell or close TheMarket by the end of the year.

==Financial results==
The Warehouse went public in 1995. Since then the stock has climbed from $1.29 to $5.54 in 2005 then to $2.605 as of 8 January 2015. During 2005, the stock dropped dramatically due to worse than expected results from the Australian operation.

In the financial year ended September 2015, The Warehouse Group reported a revenue of NZ$2.77¬†billion (up 4.6% on the previous financial year) and profits of NZ$57.1¬†million (down nearly 6% on the last financial year). Online sales made up NZ$150¬†million of their revenue ‚Äì a rise of nearly 800% from just NZ$18.8¬†million in 2011, though still barely 0.56% of their total sales. While The Warehouse and Warehouse Stationery recorded strong profit growth, the Noel Leeming electronics store division reported a drop in profit of 43% (partly due to one-off rebranding costs). The Torpedo7 Group (including Torpedo7, R&amp;R Fitness, Shotgun Supplements and No.1 Fitness) recorded a profit just above break-even, hit by change and rebranding costs. Meanwhile, the Warehouse Financial Services division recorded a $1.9¬†million loss, &quot;in line with expectations&quot;.

<text>The Z4 was arguably the world&#x27;s first commercial digital computer, and is the oldest surviving programmable computer. It was designed, and manufactured by early computer scientist Konrad Zuse&#x27;s company &quot;Zuse Apparatebau&quot;, for an order placed by Henschel &amp; Son, in 1942; though only partially assembled in Berlin, then completed in G√∂ttingen in the Third Reich in April 1945, but not delivered before the defeat of Nazi Germany, in 1945. The Z4 was Zuse&#x27;s final target for the Z3 design. Like the earlier Z2, it comprised a combination of mechanical memory and electromechanical logic.

The Z4 was used at the ETH Zurich from 1950 to 1955, also serving as the inspiration for the construction of the ERMETH, the first Swiss computer, created under the direction of ETH engineer Ambros Speiser.

==Construction==

The Z4 was very similar to the Z3 in its design but was significantly enhanced in a number of respects. The memory consisted of 32-bit rather than 22-bit floating point words. The Program Construction Unit (&quot;Planfertigungsteil&quot;) punched the program tapes, making programming and correcting programs for the machine much easier by the use of symbolic operations and memory cells. Numbers were entered and output as decimal floating-point even though the internal working was in binary. The machine had a large repertoire of instructions including square root, MAX, MIN and sine. Conditional tests included tests for infinity. When delivered to ETH Zurich in 1950 the machine had a conditional branch facility added and could print on a Mercedes typewriter. There were two program tapes where the second could be used to hold a subroutine. (Originally six were planned.)

In 1944, Zuse was working on the Z4 with around two dozen people, including Wilfried de Beauclair. Some engineers who worked at the telecommunications facility of the OKW also worked for Zuse as a secondary occupation. Also in 1944 Zuse transformed his company to the &quot;Zuse KG&quot; (&quot;Kommanditgesellschaft&quot;, i.e. a limited partnership) and planned to manufacture 300 computers. This way he could also request additional staff and scientists as a contractor in the Emergency Fighter Program. Zuse&#x27;s company also cooperated with Alwin Walther&#x27;s Institute for Applied Mathematics at the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt.

To prevent it from falling into the hands of the Soviets, the Z4 was evacuated from Berlin in February 1945 and transported to G√∂ttingen. The Z4 was completed in G√∂ttingen in a facility of the &quot;Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt&quot; (AVA, Aerodynamic Research Institute), which was headed by Albert Betz. But when it was presented to scientists of the AVA the roar of the approaching front could already be heard, so the computer was transported with a truck of the Wehrmacht to Hinterstein in Bad Hindelang in southern Bavaria, where Konrad Zuse met Wernher von Braun.

By 1947 it was possible for constants to be entered by the punched tape.

==Use after World War II==
In 1949, the Swiss mathematician Eduard Stiefel, after coming back from a stay in the US where he inspected American computers, visited Zuse and the Z4. When he formulated a differential equation as a test, Zuse immediately programmed the Z4 to solve it. Stiefel decided to acquire the computer for his newly founded Institute for Applied Mathematics at the ETH Zurich. It was delivered to ETH Zurich in 1950.

In 1954, Wolfgang Haack tried to obtain the Z4 for Technische Universit√§t Berlin, but it was instead transferred to the (ISL, Franco-German Institute of Research) in France, where it was in use until 1959, under its technical head Hubert Schardin. Today, the Z4 is on display in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. The Z4 inspired the ETH to build its own computer (mainly by Ambros Speiser and Eduard Stiefel), which was called ERMETH, an acronym for (&quot;Electronic Computing Machine ETH&quot;).

In 1950/1951, the Z4 was the only working digital computer in Central Europe, and the second digital computer in the world to be sold or loaned, beating the Ferranti Mark 1 by five months and the UNIVAC I by ten months, but in turn being beaten by the BINAC (although that never worked at the customer&#x27;s site). Other computers, all numbered with a leading Z, were built by Zuse and his company. Notable are the Z11, which was sold to the optics industry and to universities, and the Z22.

In 1955 the Z4 was sold to the French-German Research Institute of Saint-Louis (&quot;Institut franco-allemand de recherches de Saint-Louis&quot;) in Saint-Louis, close to Basel, and in 1960 transferred to the German Museum in Munich.

The Z4 was used for calculations for work on the Grande Dixence Dam in 1950.

<text>Stack Rock Fort is a fort built on a small island in the Milford Haven Waterway, Pembrokeshire, Wales. A 3-gun fort was built between 1850 and 1852, and then upgraded from 1859 to 1871 with a new building that completely encased the original gun tower. It is now a Grade II* listed building and a scheduled monument (registered SAM number PE334).

==History==
In 1539 the first proposal for a fortification at Stack Rock to protect the estuary was submitted by Thomas Cromwell, however his proposal was not approved. Similar proposals were made in 1748 when Lewis Morris carried out a survey of Milford Haven, reporting on shipwrecks and navigation and recommending that a small fort be built here. Another survey followed in 1817.

For over 200 years proposals and surveys were discussed regarding the need for a fortress on Stack Rock Island, yet nothing had been done. In 1850, with the rise of Napoleon III in France, and with the new French king&#x27;s occasionally bellicose threats towards Britain, the time had finally come to put the plans to build a fort into action. The Royal Dockyard at Pembroke Dock was finally going to have its own fort to defend it from the sea. The initial result was a tower mounting three guns, similar to the two towers in Pembroke Dock. The initial tower was elliptical in section, with a maximum diameter of and a maximum height of . Construction commenced in 1850, being completed in 1852.

In 1858, the first appearance of the new with its new invulnerability to the initial fort&#x27;s guns rendered the initial tower and its guns as obsolete, so it was decided to completely surround the initial tower with a newly expanded and updated battery. The original design of the newly expanded fort was for two decks each of 19 casemates and 16 open air guns above, 54 guns in total, and built mainly of limestone. However, after the foundations had been started in 1861, the design for the expansion was amended to have stronger granite piers supporting iron gun shields. The expansion&#x27;s new basements and magazines were completed in 1863. Then the design was altered again, for 16 large guns on a single floor of casemates in the front and seven smaller guns on two floors in the gorge or the fortification&#x27;s &quot;weak-point,&quot; in the rear of the fort facing into the Haven. The top floor was built as accommodation intended for 4 officers and 152 men. On the roof of the fort, three gun turrets each with two huge RML 12-inch 25-ton gun were planned, but never installed. This scheme was finally completed in 1871. The usual peacetime garrison was one officer and thirty men. Eventually the concerns about Napoleon III&#x27;s intentions proved to be unwarranted, and the fort never saw actual combat.

During WW I the fort was used to monitor and protect the harbor with its big guns. Other forms of protection which the fort provided for the harbor included a system of anti-ship mines in the harbor which were remotely controlled from the fort, as well as a set of large searchlights to protect against night time raids. In 1929 the fort was decommissioned. In 1932 it was first placed on the market and sold for ¬£160.

During WW II the old fort was briefly used by the RAF as a military communications relay station. In 2005 it was sold once more for ¬£150,000. Concerns over the security of a nearby LNG jetty were raised in 2013, following the discovery of potential trespasser activity. The fort was sold again in 2020 to a private owner for an undisclosed amount.
Land Registry records show that it was sold in January 2021 for ¬£191,000 to community interest company (CIC) Anoniiem.

==Armament==
The original tower housed three 32-pounder guns, as well as a single 12-pounder for protection of the walls of the dock. From 1859 to 1871, the armaments were changed to sixteen 10-inch and seven 9-inch Rifled Muzzle Loaders. These were replaced with four 12-pounder QF (quick firing) guns in 1902. A small number of men manned the fort during World War I and by this time, only two 12-pounder QF guns remained.

<text>The Eglinton River is located in the region of Southland in the southwest of New Zealand. It flows through Fiordland National Park for . Its headwaters are at Lake Gunn, east of Milford Sound, and it flows generally south before entering Lake Te Anau along the lake&#x27;s eastern shore opposite the entrance to North Fiord.

For much of its length the Eglinton is accompanied by the only road in the region, State Highway 94 from Te Anau to Milford Sound. The southern end of the Milford Track is located close to the Eglinton River.

The first Europeans to explore the river were David McKellar and George Gunn, in 1861. The river was named after Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton by James McKerrow, an Otago surveyor. The road which is now Highway 94 was built in 1935, opening up the valley to visitors.

The river flow is small leaving Lake Gunn but is greatly increased by Cascade Creek, which joins it just south of the lake. There are short gorges between Lake Gunn and Cascade Creek, and below the junction with Walker Creek. While the river has been kayaked from Cascade Creek, there is not usually sufficient water at this point and whitewater kayaking is more common from the junction with the East Branch. Rainbow and brown trout are available in the river up to Cascade Creek. Deer are hunted throughout the area, and wild pigs can be found near the river mouth.
