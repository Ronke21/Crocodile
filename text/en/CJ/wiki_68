<text>Ana Mendieta (November 18, 1948 – September 8, 1985) was a Cuban-American performance artist, sculptor, painter, and video artist who is best known for her &quot;earth-body&quot; artwork. She is considered one of the most influential Cuban-American artists of the post–World War II era. Born in Havana, Cuba, Mendieta left for the United States in 1961.

Mendieta died on September 8, 1985, in New York City, after falling from her 34th-floor apartment. She lived there with her husband of eight months, minimalist sculptor Carl Andre. The circumstances surrounding her death have been the subject of controversy.

==Early life and exile==
Mendieta was born on November 18, 1948, in Havana, Cuba, to a wealthy family prominent in the country&#x27;s politics and society. Her father, Ignacio Alberto Mendieta de Lizáur, was an attorney and the nephew of Carlos Mendieta, who was installed as president by Fulgencio Batista for just under two years. Her mother, Raquel Oti de Rojas, was a chemist, a researcher, and the granddaughter of Carlos Maria de Rojas, a sugar mill owner celebrated for his role in the war against Spain for Cuban independence. Ana, aged 12, and her 15-year-old sister Raquelin were sent to the United States by their parents to live in Dubuque, Iowa, through Operation Peter Pan, a collaborative program run by the US government and the Catholic Charities for Cuban children to flee Fidel Castro&#x27;s government. Ana and Raquelin were among 14,000 children who migrated to the United States through this program in 1961. The sisters were able to stay together during this time due to a power of attorney signed by their parents, which mandated that they not be separated. The two sisters spent their first weeks in refugee camps, and then moved between several institutions and foster homes throughout Iowa. In 1966, Mendieta was reunited with her mother and younger brother. Her father joined them in 1979, having spent 18 years in a political prison in Cuba for his involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion.

==Education==
In Cuba, Ana Mendieta grew up as a sheltered, upper-class child. She attended an all-girls Catholic private school. When she and her sister were sent to Iowa, they were enrolled in a reform school because the court wanted to avoid sending them to a state institution. When Mendieta studied English in school, her vocabulary was very limited. In junior high school, she discovered a love for art. Mendieta was first a French major and art minor, but when she transferred to the University of Iowa, she was inspired by the avant-garde community and the hills of Iowa&#x27;s landscape. She earned a BA (enrolled 1969–1972) and MA in painting, and an MFA (enrolled 1972–1977) in Intermedia under the instruction of acclaimed artist Hans Breder. She faced a great deal of discrimination while in art school. In college, Mendieta&#x27;s work focused on blood and violence toward women. Her interest in spiritualism, religion, and primitive rituals developed during this time. After graduate school, she moved to New York City. “Seeing her in New York was always a joy because she always had friends around her,” said her longtime friend Sherry Buckberrough, a retired art history professor. “She networked very well, so there was always some event that we would go to. And there would always be a party later, that’s for sure.”

==Work==
In the course of her career, Mendieta created works in Cuba, Mexico, Italy, and the United States. Her work was somewhat autobiographical, drawing from her history of being displaced from her native Cuba, and focused on themes including feminism, violence, life, death, identity, place, and belonging. Many of her works included ephemeral outdoor performances and photographs, sculptures and drawings. Her works are generally associated with the four Classical elements. Mendieta often focused on a spiritual and physical connection with the earth. She felt that by uniting her body with the earth she could become whole again: &quot;Through my earth/body sculptures, I become one with the earth ... I become an extension of nature and nature becomes an extension of my body. This obsessive act of reasserting my ties with the earth is really the reactivation of primeval beliefs ... [in] an omnipresent female force, the after image of being encompassing within the womb, is a manifestation of my thirst for being.&quot; During her lifetime, Mendieta produced more than 200 works of art using earth as a sculptural medium. Her techniques were mainly influenced by Afro-Cuban traditions.

=== &quot;Rape Scene&quot; (1973 Moffit Street, Iowa City, Iowa) ===
Mendieta&#x27;s first use of blood to make art was in 1972, when she performed &quot;Untitled (Death of a Chicken)&quot;. In this performance, she stood naked in front of a white wall holding a freshly decapitated chicken by its feet as its blood spattered her naked body. In 1973, Mendieta performed &quot;Rape Scene&quot;, which commented on the rape and murder of a fellow student that had been committed on the University of Iowa campus by another student.  In the performance, Mendieta invited friends and other students to visit her in her Moffit Street apartment.  Upon arriving at her apartment, viewers were confronted with the image of Mendieta, naked from the waist down, smeared with blood, bent over, and bound to a table. Mendieta recalls that after encountering her body, her audience &quot;all sat down, and started talking about it. I didn’t move. I stayed in position about an hour. It really jolted them&quot; The interaction between the people who stayed to observe and talk about her work (rape scene) and the artist herself (Ana Mendieta) was a means of processing the actual crime that had occurred at the University of Iowa. 

Professor and art historian Kaira Cabañas writes about &quot;Untitled (Rape Scene)&quot;:

Her body was the subject and object of the work. She used it to emphasize the societal conditions by which the female body is colonized as the object of male desire and ravaged under masculine aggression. Mendieta&#x27;s corporeal presence demanded the recognition of a female subject. The previously invisible, unnamed victim of rape gained an identity. The audience was forced to reflect on its responsibility; its empathy was elicited and translated to the space of awareness in which sexual violence could be addressed.

In a slide series, &quot;People Looking at Blood Moffitt&quot; (1973), she poured blood and rags on a sidewalk and photographed people walking by without stopping until the man next door (the storefront window bears the name H.F. Moffitt) came out to clean it up.

===Involvement in the A.I.R.===
In 1978, Ana Mendieta joined the Artists In Residence Inc (A.I.R. Gallery) in New York, which was the first gallery for women to be established in the United States. The venture gave her the opportunity to network with other women artists at the forefront of the era&#x27;s feminist movement. During that time, Mendieta was also actively involved in the administration and maintenance of the A.I.R. In an unpublished statement, she noted, &quot;It is crucial for me to be a part of all my art works. As a result of my participation, my vision becomes a reality and part of my experiences.&quot; At the same time, after two years of involvement with A.I.R., she concluded that &quot;American Feminism as it stands is basically a white middle class movement,&quot; and she sought to challenge the limits of this perspective through her art. She met her future husband Carl Andre at the gallery, when he served on a panel titled &quot;How has women&#x27;s art practices affected male artist social attitudes?&quot; Her resignation in 1982 is attributed, in part, to a dispute instigated by Andre over a collaborative art piece the couple had submitted. In a 2001 journal article, Kat Griefen, director of A.I.R from 2006 to 2011, wrote, The letter of resignation did not cite any reasons for her departure, but a number of fellow A.I.R. artists remember the related events. For a recent benefit Mendieta and Carl Andre had donated a collaborative piece. As was the policy, all works needed to be delivered by the artist. Edelson recalls that Andre took offense, instigating a disagreement, which, in part, led to Mendieta&#x27;s resignation. Even without this incident, according to another member, Pat Lasch, Mendieta&#x27;s association with the now legendary Andre surely played some role in her decision.In 1983, Mendieta was awarded the Rome Prize by the American Academy in Rome. While living in Rome, Mendieta began creating art &quot;objects&quot;, including drawings and sculptures. She continued to use natural elements in her work.

===&quot;Silueta Series&quot; (1973–1985)===
In her &quot;Silueta Series&quot; (1973–1985), Mendieta created female silhouettes in nature—in mud, sand, and grass—with natural materials ranging from leaves and twigs to blood, and made body prints or painted her outline or silhouette onto a wall. She did this to express herself becoming part of the earth and to embody a process of rituals (Abby, 2015).

In a 1981 artist statement, Mendieta said: I have been carrying out a dialogue between the landscape and the female body (based on my own silhouette). I believe this has been a direct result of my having been torn from my homeland (Cuba) during my adolescence. I am overwhelmed by the feeling of having been cast from the womb (nature). My art is the way I re-establish the bonds that unite me to the universe. It is a return to the maternal source.
When she began her &quot;Silueta Series&quot; in the 1970s, Mendieta was one of many artists experimenting with the emerging genres of land art, body art, and performance art. The films and photographs of Siluetas are in connection with the figures surrounding her body. Mendieta was possibly the first to combine these genres in what she called &quot;earth-body&quot; sculptures. She often used her naked body to explore and connect with the Earth, as seen in her piece &quot;Imagen de Yagul&quot;, from the series &quot;Silueta Works, Mexico, 1973–1977&quot;. The &quot;Silueta Works, Mexico, 1973–1977&quot; series was featured in the group show &quot;My Body, My Rules&quot; at the Pérez Art Museum Miami between 2020–2021. 

&quot;Untitled (Ochún)&quot; (1981), named for the Santería goddess of waters, once pointed southward from the shore at Key Biscayne, Florida. &quot;Ñañigo Burial&quot; (1976), with a title taken from the popular name for an Afro-Cuban religious brotherhood, is a floor installation of black candles dripping wax in the outline of the artist&#x27;s body. Through these works, which involve performance, film, and photography, Mendieta explored her relationship with a place as well as a larger relationship with Mother Earth or the &quot;Great Goddess&quot; figure.

Mary Jane Jacob suggests in her exhibition catalog &quot;Ana Mendieta: The &quot;Silueta&quot; Series (1973–1980)&quot; that much of Mendieta&#x27;s work was influenced by her interest in the religion Santería, as well as a connection to Cuba. Jacob attributes Mendieta&#x27;s &quot;ritualistic use of blood,&quot; and the use of gunpowder, earth, and rock, to Santería&#x27;s ritualistic traditions.

Jacob also points out the significance of the mother figure, referring to the Mayan deity Ix Chel, the mother of the gods. Many have interpreted Mendieta&#x27;s recurring use of this mother figure and her own female silhouette as feminist art. However, because Mendieta&#x27;s work explores many ideas including life, death, identity, and place all at once, it cannot be categorized as part of one idea or movement. Claire Raymond argues that the &quot;Silueta Series,&quot; as a photographic archive, should be read for its photographicity rather than merely as documentation of earthworks.

In &quot;Corazon de Roca con Sangre (Rock Heart with Blood)&quot; (1975) Mendieta kneels next to an impression of her body that has been cut into the soft, muddy riverbank.

=== Photo etchings of the &quot;Rupestrian Sculptures&quot; (1981) ===
As documented in the book &quot;Ana Mendieta: A Book of Works&quot; (edited by Bonnie Clearwater), before her death, Mendieta was working on a series of photo-etchings of cave sculptures she had created at Escaleras de Jaruco, Jaruco State Park in Havana, Cuba. She had returned to the island as a part of a cultural exchange group and was eager to begin exploring her birthplace after having spent 19 years in exile. The soft limestone and undulating landscapes provided a new scope for Mendieta&#x27;s art as she began to explore the cultural identity that she had long been forsaken. Her sculptures were entitled &quot;Rupestrian Sculptures&quot; (1981)—the title refers to living among rocks—and the book of photographic etchings that Mendieta created to preserve these sculptures is a testament to the intertextuality of her work. Clearwater explains that the photographs of Mendieta&#x27;s sculptures were often as important as the piece they were documenting because the nature of Mendieta&#x27;s work was so impermanent. She spent as much time and thought on the creation of the photographs as she did on the sculptures themselves.

Although Mendieta returned to Havana for this project, she was still exploring her sense of displacement and loss, according to Clearwater. The &quot;Rupestrian Sculptures&quot; that Mendieta created were also influenced by the Taíno people, &quot;native inhabitants of the pre-Hispanic Antilles&quot;, whom Mendieta became fascinated by and studied.

Mendieta completed five photo-etchings of the &quot;Rupestrian Sculptures&quot; before she died in 1985. The book &quot;Ana Mendieta: A Book of Works&quot;, published in 1993, contains both photographs of the sculptures and Mendieta&#x27;s notes on the project.

===&quot;Body Tracks&quot; (1982)===
&quot;Body Tracks&quot; (&quot;Rastros Corporales&quot;) debuted on April 8, 1982, in Franklin Furnace in New York City. The tracks are long, blurry marks made by Mendieta on a large piece of white paper attached to a wall. The marks were made of a mixture of tempera paint and animal blood.

The performance was documented in the 1987 film &quot;Ana Mendieta: Fuego de Tierra&quot;, and described by scholar Alexandra Gonzenbach: In the short piece, the artist enters the studio space, while Cuban music plays in the background. She dips her hands and forearms into animal blood, places her back to the camera, lifts her arms and places them on a large sheet of white paper attached to a wall, and then proceeds to slowly drag her arms down the page, until almost reaching the bottom. She then walks off screen and out of the performance space. The camera, documentation, and performance stops.The resultant pieces of paper were preserved by Mendieta after the event, and appear in the collection of the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University. A still photo from the exhibit was the cover art of the Third Woman Press edition of the feminist anthology This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color (2002, ).

===Film works (1971–1980)===
In the 1970s, Mendieta made several experimental films. These include:

*&quot;Creek&quot; (1974): This film builds on the Shakespearean character of Ophelia. It was shot in San Felipe Creek, Oaxaca, Mexico. In the film, Mendieta merges with the water.
*&quot;Chicken Movie, Chicken Piece&quot; (1972)
*&quot;Parachute&quot; (1973)
*&quot;Moffitt Building Piece&quot; (1973)
*&quot;Grass Breathing&quot; (1974)
*&quot;Dog&quot; (1974)
*&quot;Mirage&quot; (1974)
*&quot;Weather Balloon, Feathered Balloon&quot; (1974)
*&quot;Silueta Sangrienta&quot; (1975)
*&quot;Energy Charge&quot; (1975)
*&quot;Ochún&quot; (1981): Mendieta filmed &quot;Ochun&quot; in Key Biscayne, Florida. It is about the Santería goddess, Ochún—the Orisha of the river. It features sand silhouettes, seagull sounds, and ocean waves, and emphasizes themes of longing for another land. It was her last film.
*Untitled (1981): &quot;focuses on the outline of a figure Mendieta carved into the shoreline in Guanabo, a beach town in the artist’s home country of Cuba. Derived from Mendieta’s interest in indigenous Caribbean religion, and themes of exile and return, the shape of the female figure would become a common motif in Mendieta’s work by the early 1980s.&quot;
*&quot;Esculturas Rupestres&quot; (&quot;Rupestrian Sculptures&quot;; 1981): &quot;emphasizes the importance of documentation in grasping the full scope of her practice.&quot;
*&quot;Birth&quot; (&quot;Gunpowder Works&quot;; 1981): &quot;features a female silhouette sculpted from wet mud as it sparks and burns out amid the landscape.&quot;

In 2016, a traveling exhibition of her film work was mounted by the Katherine E. Nash Gallery of the University of Minnesota with the title &quot;Covered in Time and History: The Films of Ana Mendieta&quot;.

===Film works released posthumously (1985–present)===
The Estate of Ana Mendieta Collection, LLC, and family members found several films after her death while looking for work to be included in a retrospective at the New Museum in 1987. In 2016, more films were uncovered and digitized in anticipation of a documentary directed by the artist&#x27;s niece, Raquel Cecilia Mendieta.

*&quot;Pain of Cuba/Body I Am (2018)&quot;
*&quot;The Earth That Covers Us Speaks (2018)&quot;

==Solo exhibitions==
Mendieta presented a solo exhibition of her photographs at A.I.R. Gallery in New York in 1979. She also curated and wrote the introductory catalog essay for an exhibition at A.I.R. in 1981 titled &quot;Dialectics of Isolation: An Exhibition of Third World Women Artists of the United States&quot;, which featured the work of artists such as Judy Baca, Senga Nengudi, Howardena Pindell, and Zarina. The New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York hosted Mendieta&#x27;s first survey exhibition in 1987. Since her death, Mendieta has been recognized with international solo museum retrospectives such as &quot;Ana Mendieta&quot;, Art Institute of Chicago (2011); and &quot;Ana Mendieta in Context: Public and Private Work&quot;, De La Cruz Collection, Miami (2012). 

In 2004, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., organized &quot;Earth Body, Sculpture and Performance&quot;, a major retrospective that traveled to the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Des Moines Art Center, Iowa; and Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida (2004).

In 2017, her work was presented in the retrospective solo show &quot;Ana Mendieta / Covered in Time and History&quot; at Bildmuseet, Umeå University, Sweden. In 2019, her work was displayed in the exhibition &quot;La Tierra Habla (The Earth Speaks)&quot; at Galerie Lelong, NYC, New York.

Exhibition &quot;En Búsqueda del Origen&quot; 27 Jan 24 to 19 May 24 at Museo de Arte Contemporaneo, León, España. www.musac.es.

==Notable group exhibitions==
In 2022, the Hammer Museum at University of California, Los Angeles, organized the exhibition &quot;Joan Didion: What She Means&quot;, curated by The New Yorker theater critic Hilton Als. The show traveled to the Pérez Art Museum Miami in 2023, and works by Ana Mendieta were included alongside artworks by 50 other contemporary international artists such as Félix González-Torres, Vija Celmins, Betye Saar, Maren Hassinger, Silke Otto-Knapp, John Koch, Ed Ruscha, Pat Steir, among others.

==Public collections (selection)==
Mendieta&#x27;s work is featured in many major public collections, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and Museum of Modern Art in New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne et Contemporain, Geneva; Tate Collection, London; the Nasher Sculpture Center, Dallas; and the Pérez Art Museum Miami.

==Death and controversy==
Ana Mendieta died on September 8, 1985, in New York City, after falling from her 34th-floor apartment in Greenwich Village at 300 Mercer Street. She lived there with her husband of eight months, minimalist sculptor Carl Andre. The circumstances surrounding her death have been the subject of controversy. She fell 33 stories onto the roof of a deli. Just prior to her death, neighbors heard the couple arguing violently. The neighbors heard Mendieta scream out &quot;no&quot; right before her death, and Andre had scratches all over his face. There were no eyewitnesses to the events that led up to Mendieta&#x27;s death. A recording of Andre&#x27;s 911 call showed him saying: &quot;My wife is an artist, and I&#x27;m an artist, and we had a quarrel about the fact that I was more, eh, exposed to the public than she was. And she went to the bedroom, and I went after her, and she went out the window.&quot; During three years of legal proceedings, Andre&#x27;s lawyer described Mendieta&#x27;s death as a possible accident or a suicide. After a nonjury trial, Andre was acquitted of second-degree murder in February 1988.

The acquittal caused an uproar among feminists in the art world, and remains controversial. In 2010, a symposium called &quot;Where Is Ana Mendieta?&quot; was held at New York University to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her death. In May 2014, the feminist protest group No Wave Performance Task Force staged a protest in front of the Dia Art Foundation&#x27;s retrospective on Carl Andre. The group deposited piles of animal blood and guts in front of the establishment, with protesters donning transparent tracksuits with &quot;I Wish Ana Mendieta Was Still Alive&quot; written on them. In March 2015, the No Wave Performance Task Force and a group of feminist poets from New York City traveled to Beacon, New York, to protest the Andre retrospective at Dia Beacon, where they cried loudly in the main gallery, made &quot;siluetas&quot; in the snow on museum grounds, and stained the snow with paprika, sprinkles, and fake blood. In April 2017, protesters at an Andre retrospective handed out cards at the Geffen Contemporary museum with the statement: &quot;Carl Andre is at MOCA Geffen. &quot;¿Dónde está Ana Mendieta?&quot;&quot; (Where is Ana Mendieta?). This was followed by an open letter to Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) Director Philippe Vergne protesting the exhibit, from the group the Association of Hysteric Curators.

==Legacy==
In 2009, Mendieta was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Cintas Foundation.

In 2010, she was the subject of Richard Move&#x27;s controversial &quot;Where is Ana Mendieta? 25 Years Later - An Exhibition and Symposium&quot;, which included his film, &quot;BloodWork - The Ana Mendieta Story&quot;.

In 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a belated obituary for her that began, &quot;Mendieta&#x27;s art, sometimes violent, often unapologetically feminist and usually raw, left an indelible mark before her life was cut short.&quot;

In February 2024 it was announced that Academy award nominee America Ferrera would star in and executive produce an Amazon Prime Video series about Mendieta. The work is based on a book by Robert Katz, to be scripted by Cherise Castro Smith and co-executive produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Plan B Entertainment.

The title character of Xochitl Gonzalez’s sophomore novel, &quot;Anita de Monte Laughs Last&quot;, is closely based on Mendieta, to whom the work is dedicated.

<doc id="1104580" wikidata="Q7112140" url="?curid=1104580" title="Outlaws (Outlaws album)">
<text>Outlaws is the debut studio album by American southern rock band Outlaws, released in 1975. The album is known for the rock classic &quot;Green Grass &amp; High Tides&quot;, which is considered by many to be one of the greatest guitar songs, plus the hit single &quot;There Goes Another Love Song&quot;.

Drawing influences from southern rock bands the Allman Brothers Band &amp; Lynyrd Skynyrd, as well as folk rock and country rock bands such as the Byrds, Poco, Eagles, and New Riders of the Purple Sage, the band developed a unique, hard-driving country rock sound, due in part to the fast picking, quasi-country style guitar playing of Hughie Thomasson, coupled with their use of three and four part harmonies and incorporation of elements of bluegrass music.

The band was also notable for featuring three different front men: Thomasson, Henry Paul, and Billy Jones, all of whom wrote and provided lead vocals. Paul&#x27;s vocals and his self-penned tracks &quot;Song in the Breeze&quot;, &quot;Stay with Me&quot; and &quot;Knoxville Girl&quot; brought a strong country flavor to the album, while Jones teamed with Thomasson to provide a hard driving Southern Rock guitar sound focused on dueling guitar lines.

The album, with its blend of Southern rock, country rock and hard rock, was well received by critics, and also helped the band become a huge concert draw. It peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart.

<doc id="1104584" wikidata="Q744130" url="?curid=1104584" title="Siero">
<text>Siero is a municipality of the autonomous community of Asturias, in northern Spain. With a population of 52,194 as of 2023, Siero is the fourth most populous municipality in Asturias. It has a total of 29 parishes, with the largest being Lugones; its capital parish is La Pola Siero. It is located centrally within Asturias, and the northernmost point of Siero is about 10 km from Asturias&#x27; largest city, Gijón, and the shores of the Cantabrian Sea.

== Geography ==
Siero&#x27;s two main rivers, which run throughout much of the municipality, are the Nora and Noreña. Geographically, meadowlands make up a majority of the area within Siero. Like many other areas near the coast in Asturias, Siero tends to have a very temperate climate. It also enclaves the municipality of Noreña.

== History ==
The area now known as Siero has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic period, especially near the current parishes of Argüelles, Lugones, and Samartindianes. The Roman conquest of Iberia extended to the municipality, as evidenced by the numerous Roman bridges left over from that period.

Siero would not be referenced in writing until 905, when Alfonso III granted the church of San Martín de Siero to the Oviedo Cathedral. Other churches in the municipality were also donated to the Oviedo Cathedral throughout that century. There are also records of hospitals and leprosariums being constructed in the area 12th and 13th centuries; some of those continued operating until roughly the 18th century. On 14 August 1270, King Alfonso X granted the area its municipal charter, giving the area official recognition. Eighty years later, the region was split following the death of Alfonso XI, with Pedro I controlling Samartindianes and the rest of the region subject to Enrique II of Trastámara. Following Enrique II&#x27;s ascent to the throne of Castile, he exempted Siero from taxes due to its inhabitants&#x27; support during the Castilian Civil War.

In the early 19th century, Siero was invaded multiple times by the French during the Napoleonic Wars, until the French withdrew from Asturias in 1812. Throughout 20th century, due to the growth of the coal mining industry in the region, Siero became one of the fastest growing municipalities in Asturias, more than doubling its population from the beginning of the century to the end. In modern times, the tertiary sector has become Siero&#x27;s largest, with construction and dairy farming still remaining relevant.

Siero currently consists of the following 29 parishes:

<text>The was one of the world&#x27;s largest indoor waterparks, located in Miyazaki, Japan. 

== Layout ==
The Polynesia-themed Ocean Dome, which was part of the Sheraton Seagaia Resort, with the world&#x27;s biggest retractable roof, which was opened and closed according to the weather conditions; 12,000 square metres of sandy beach, crushed from 600 tonnes of stones; an &quot;ocean&quot; six times larger than an Olympic pool, filled with 13,500 tonnes of unsalted, chlorinated water kept hot at 28°C, equipped with a wave-machine with 200 variations, and listed in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the biggest simulated pool. A resort, it boasts five hotels, several golf-courses, a botanical park and a zoo. 

== History ==
The Ocean Dome water park, which opened in 1993 along with the rest of the complex, was visited by 1.25 million people in the peak year of fiscal 1995. Other accommodations within the area include the Seaside Hotel Phoenix, the Sun Hotel Phoenix, and the Cottage Himuka, with 14 cottages in a wooded setting. Depending on the season, entrance cost for the simulated dome was 2600 yen ($21.17) for an adult and 1600 yen ($13.03) for a child. 

Seagaia filed for bankruptcy on February 19, 2001, being the biggest failure of public-private partnership in Japan and symbolized the excesses of Japan&#x27;s bubble economy. The dome was later bought by Ripplewood, an American private-equity fund, in 2001 for 16.2 billion yen (US$148 million), which was less than 10% of its construction costs of 200 billion yen ($1.8 billion). Ripplewood had also invested an additional 3.5 billion yen ($32 million) on renovations for the dome; but even after the remodeling of the resort, the hotel closed down with liabilities of 276 billion yen ($2.5 million). 

The water park was closed in 2007 by Phoenix Resort K.K. The Seagaia Ocean dome was demolished in 2017, a year after the hotel had received major renovations which did not include the dome.

<text>Frank Hawkins Underhill, SM, FRSC (November 26, 1889 – September 16, 1971) was a Canadian journalist, essayist, historian, social critic, and political thinker.

== Biography ==
Frank Underhill, born in Stouffville, Ontario, was educated at the University of Toronto and the University of Oxford in which he was a member of the Fabian Society. He was influenced by social and political critics such as George Bernard Shaw and Goldwin Smith. He taught history at the University of Saskatchewan from 1914 until 1927 with a long interruption during World War I during which he served as an officer in the Hertfordshire Regiment of the British Army on the Western Front. He also taught from 1927 until 1955 at the University of Toronto. He left the University of Toronto due to a dispute with the administration and later joined the faculty at Carleton University.

During the Great Depression, Underhill joined several other left-wing academics in forming the League for Social Reconstruction. He was also a founder of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and helped write its Regina Manifesto in 1933. He joined the editorial staff of the leftist &quot;Canadian Forum&quot; in 1927 in which he wrote a column of political commentary called &quot;O Canada&quot; from 1929 and served for a time as chair of that journal&#x27;s editorial board. Despite those progressive leanings, Underhill had a conservative view of the historical profession and impeded the careers of several women historians.

During World War II, Underhill moved away from socialism and became a left-wing liberal continentalist. He remained a committed anti-imperialist and was almost dismissed from the University of Toronto in 1941 for suggesting that Canada would drift away from the British Empire and draw closer to the United States. His struggle with the university became a landmark in the history of academic freedom in Canada.

Underhill&#x27;s most important writings are collected in the 1960 book of essays, &quot;In Search of Canadian Liberalism&quot;. In the essays, Underhill covered many Canadian concerns such as politics before and after the Canadian Confederation, relations with the United States and Britain and assessments of the actions of Canadian public figures. The essays were praised in the &quot;Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature&quot; for their &quot;iconoclasm and trenchant wit often bordering on sarcasm.&quot; Underhill&#x27;s other notable works include &quot;Canadian Political Parties&quot; (1957), &quot;The Image of Confederation&quot; (1964), and &quot;Upper Canadian Politics in the 1850s&quot; (1967).

Underhill was a strong supporter of the United States during the Cold War. He also became a supporter of the Liberal Party of Canada, particularly once his long-time friend Lester Pearson joined the government. In his later years, Underhill served as a lecturer and Chair of the Department of History at Carleton University in Ottawa. Carleton University has named a major reading room and the Underhill Graduate Student Colloquium,the longest-running graduate colloquium in Canada, in memory of the former chair.

In 1967, he received the Medal of Service of the Order of Canada. Underhill died in Ottawa, Ontario in 1971.

<doc id="1104589" wikidata="Q2821815" url="?curid=1104589" title="Avraam Benaroya">
<text>Avraam Eliezer Benaroya (; ; ; ; ; 1887 – 16 May 1979) was a Jewish socialist, member of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (Narrow Socialists), later leader of the Socialist Workers&#x27; Federation in the Ottoman Empire. Benaroya played a key role in the foundation of the Socialist Worker&#x27;s party of Greece in 1918, the predecessor of the Communist Party of Greece.

== Early years ==
Benaroya was born to a Sephardi Jew in Bulgaria. He was raised in Vidin by a family of small merchants. A polyglot, Benaroya learned to speak six languages fluently. He studied at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law, but did not graduate, becoming rather a teacher in Plovdiv. Here Benaroya became a member of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (Narrow Socialists) (although other sources suggest that he joined the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers Party (Broad Socialists), he himself insisted that this was incorrect) and published in Bulgarian his work &quot;The Jewish Question and Social Democracy&quot; (1908).

After the Young Turk revolution of 1908 he moved as a socialist organizer to Thessaloniki. He founded here a group called &quot;Sephardic Circle of Socialist Studies&quot; and was in connection to the Bulgarian left-wing faction, close to the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), called People&#x27;s Federative Party (Bulgarian Section), as well as to some Bulgarian socialists, who worked there. Benaroya&#x27;s influence grew, as he argued that any socialist movement in the city must take the form of a federation in which all national groups could participate. Due to the Bulgarian roots of its Jewish founder, the organization was viewed with suspicion by the Young Turks and later by the Greek government, as being close to the IMRO and Bulgarian socialist movement.

== The Fédération Socialiste Ouvrière ==

Idealistic and pragmatic at the same time, in Thessaloniki Benaroya played a leading role in the creation, in 1909, of the mainly Jewish Socialist Workers&#x27; Federation, or in Ladino, Federacion. The organization took this name because, built on the federative model of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, it was conceived as a federation of separate sections, each representing the four main ethnic groups of the city: Jews, Bulgarians, Greeks and Turks. It published its literature in the languages of these four groups (i.e., Ladino, Bulgarian, Greek and Turkish, respectively) but in practice the two latter sections were under-represented if not nonexistent. The democratic Federacion soon became, under Benaroya&#x27;s leadership, the strongest socialist party in the Ottoman Empire. It created combative trade unions, attracted important intellectuals and gained a solid base of support among Macedonian workers while cultivating strong links with the Second International. From 1910 to 1911 Benaroya edited its influential newspaper, the &quot;Solidaridad Ovradera&quot;, printed in Ladino.

Unlike other parties which were organised on ethnic lines, as a cross-community group the Federacion was allowed by the Ottoman authorities. A prominent Bulgarian member, Dimitar Vlahov, was a socialist MP in the new Ottoman parliament until 1912. Indeed, its leaders initially supported the Young Turks, and Benaroya participated in the &quot;Army of Freedom&quot; march on Istanbul to help put down the Countercoup of 1909. Alarmed by the growing power of socialist groups, the CUP subsequently launched a crack down, under which Benaroya was jailed three times, in early November 1910, June 1911 (when he was deported to Serbia) and February 1912 (when he was deported to Greece).

== The Federacion and the labour movement in Greece ==
In the aftermath of the incorporation of Thessaloniki into the Greek state, Benaroya resisted the attempts to impose ethnic divisions in the city. Opposed to the First World War, Benaroya and another Jewish socialist were exiled for two and a half years at the island of Naxos. In contrast to most of the prominent socialists in the pre-1913 Greece who followed Eleftherios Venizelos, Benaroya and the Federacion, adhering to its internationalist ideals, mobilized for neutrality. As this happened to the same policy as pursued by King Constantine and his militaristic entourage, this led to the loss of support for Federacion in Macedonia.

From 1915 onwards the Federacion was buoyed by the popular reaction to the war. Both monarchist and Venizelist policy actually assisted the emancipation and the radicalization of the left, and Benaroya, keeping equal distance from both established political groups, was quick to turn the situation to advantage. In the 1915 general elections Federacion sent two deputies representing Thessaloniki (Aristotelis Sideris and Alberto Couriel) to the Greek Parliament, while it lost by only a few votes for a third seat. It already had strong links with internationalist groups and organizations all over Greece and abroad; from them the Socialist Workers Party was to spring up in due time. However, another socialist faction, headed by the future Prime Minister Alexandros Papanastasiou, who sided with Venizelos in foreign affairs, also had deputies elected in the same election.

Papanastasiou and other reform-minded socialists strongly supported Venizelos&#x27; liberal brand of nationalism. Benaroya and the Federacion, on the other hand, were influenced by Austromarxists such as Victor Adler, Otto Bauer and Karl Renner, who, sensitive to matters national, searched ways to utilize socialism as a cohesive force for the decrepit Habsburg monarchy; they elaborated the principle of personal autonomy, according to which national consciousness should be depoliticized and become a personal matter. Modern states should be based on free association and allow self-definition and self-organization of ethnicities in cultural affairs, while a mixed parliament, proportionally representing all nations of the realm, should decide on economic and political questions. The Federacion traced the origins of its federative position in Balkan authors of the Enlightenment like Rigas Velestinlis, and stressed that the forthcoming peace should exclude any change of borders or transfer of populations. The Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, that was created under Benaroya&#x27;s initiative near the end of the First World War, followed closely the Federacion&#x27;s theses on national self-determination, and wanted to transform the Greek state into a federation of autonomous provinces that would safeguard the rights of minorities and participate in a federative Republic of the Balkan peoples.

== Jewish ethnic activism ==
Benaroya was interested in the Jewish Question since the beginning of his career and made efforts to promote Jewish causes throughout it. His first book was &quot;The Jewish Question and Social Democracy&quot; (1908) while once in Thessaloniki he founded a group called the Sephardic Circle of Socialist Studies. He also played a leading role in the creation, in 1909, of the mainly Jewish Federacion. Apprehensive of what the resurgent Greek self-confidence behind the Megali Idea might mean for Jews in Greece and Asia Minor, at the time he labelled the campaign imperialist. He envisaged a state free from any ethnic divisions where Jews could exist unpersecuted and free, retaining their religion. Some of his fears might have been argued to have been realised when after the city&#x27;s fire, the Venizelos administration did not rebuild the original Jewish section, adopting instead a French town plan, but a considerable proportion of the Jewish population remained throughout the following decades, with the Greek government guaranteeing their rights in March 1926. Benaroya was always very interested in combating anti-Semitism, while over later years he shifted his emphasis to reflect the sizable Thessaloniki Jewish community that chose to remain within the Greek state.

== Partnership with Democratic Union ==

After a historic meeting with Venizelos, Benaroya&#x27;s tactical abilities resulted in the birth of the Socialist Labour Party of Greece (later named Communist) and the General Confederation of Greek Workers, which helped unite Greek workers.

Government persecution of the new movement led to a general strike in 1919. Subsequently, social and political polarization, as well as the prestige of the newborn Soviet Union, strengthened the radicals and before long the party was affiliated to the Leninist Third International. The Labour Centre of Salonica, another creation of Benaroya&#x27;s, which united more than twelve thousand workers of all nationalities, a good part of them Jews, became the focus of radical socialism. The fall of the Venizelos government (1920) and the war in Anatolia fuelled even more dissent, leading to anti-war riots. In the wake of these developments Benaroya, thrown in prison again, as well as most of the leading members of the party, were marginalized by the radicals. On the other hand, moderate socialists under Alexandros Papanastasiou started preparing their own revolution: their primary aim was now to overthrow the Greek monarchy.

In 1922 the Greek army was defeated by the Kemalists and a military revolution ensued that deposed King Constantine. The new government undertook many reforms, notably the distribution of big estates to peasants, but after a general strike, workers were violently suppressed.

A little later, in December 1923, Benaroya, together with Couriel and Kordatos, who preferred social-democratic organizational models and opposed radical Bolshevisation considering the circumstances not suitable for a revolution, were expelled from the Communist Party of Greece and he was obliged to quit the editorship of &quot;Avanti&quot;. Afterwards he focused his action on Thessaloniki&#x27;s Jewish community, and participated in a splinter group that—with help from Papanastasiou, then Prime Minister—tried unsuccessfully to split the Communist Party. At that time he and Papanastasiou agreed on the need for reforms and not revolution, and on the priority of abolishing the monarchy. An equally urgent imperative, though, was combating racism and anti-Semitism.

== Later life ==
Benaroya remained politically active after 1924 but as he stayed outside the principal political formations of the left, the communists and Papanastasiou&#x27;s socialists, his capacity for action was increasingly restricted. In Thessaloniki he had a difficult political life, especially after the Liberals&#x27; more nationalist turn by the end of the decade, and the repeated coups d&#x27;état of 1935 that destroyed the Republic and the hopes of the democratic left. In the 1940s he lost a son during the Greco-Italian war, he survived the Nazi concentration camps, and led a small socialist party in Greece after his return collaborating himself with Alexandros Svolos. He left to Israel in 1953, to Holon, where he ran a small convenient store. He died in 1979, aged ninety two.

<text>Assembly of the Nobility () was a self-governing body of the sosloviye (estate) of the Russian nobility in Imperial Russia from 1766 to 1917. Their official status was defined by the Charter to the Gentry in 1785. The Nobility Assemblies were at the guberniya and uyezd levels. Sometimes it is also translated as Gentry Assembly.

The chair of an Assembly of Nobility was called Gubernia (Uyezd) Marshal of Nobility. These Assemblies governed both the dvoryanstvo itself and took part in the governing of local affairs of the whole society, such as the election of the persons to the posts in local administration and police. After the Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia and subsequent reforms, their purpose became mostly affairs of the nobility.

This institution ceased to exist in Russia after the October Revolution. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in 1990 the descendants of Russian nobility founded the Russian Assembly of Nobility, a public non-political organization.

==Clubhouse==
Assemblies of nobility typically had clubhouses also called &quot;Assembly of Nobility&quot;, colloquially referred to as &quot;the Assembly&quot; (собрание) among the peers. The most famous one was that of the Moscow Assembly of the Nobility; the building is now known as the House of the Unions.

<doc id="1104592" wikidata="Q251259" url="?curid=1104592" title="Ibn Tufayl">
<text>Ibn Ṭufayl (full Arabic name: ; Latinized form: &quot;Abubacer Aben Tofail&quot;; Anglicized form: &quot;Abubekar&quot; or &quot;Abu Jaafar Ebn Tophail&quot;; – 1185) was an Arab Andalusian Muslim polymath: a writer, Islamic philosopher, Islamic theologian, physician, astronomer, and vizier.

As a philosopher and novelist, he is most famous for writing the first philosophical novel, (The Living Son of the Vigilant)&quot;,&quot; considered a major work of Arabic literature emerging from Al-Andalus. As a physician, he was an early supporter of dissection and autopsy, which was expressed in his novel.

==Life==
Born in Guadix, near Granada, he was educated by Ibn Bajjah (Avempace). His family were from the Arab Qays tribe. He was a secretary for several leaders, including the rulers of Ceuta and Tangier, in 1154. He also served as a secretary for the ruler of Granada, and later as vizier and physician for Abu Yaqub Yusuf, the Almohad caliph, to whom he recommended Ibn Rushd (Averroës) as his own future successor in 1169. Ibn Rushd later reports this event and describes how Ibn Tufayl then inspired him to write his famous Aristotelian commentaries:

Ibn Rushd became Ibn Tufayl&#x27;s successor after he retired in 1182; Ibn Tufayl died several years later in Morocco in 1185. The astronomer Nur Ed-Din Al-Bitruji was also a disciple of Ibn Tufayl. Al-Bitruji was influenced by him to follow the Aristotelian system of astronomy, as he had originally followed the Ptolemaic system of astronomy.

His work in astronomy was historically significant as he played a major role in overturning the Ptolemaic ideas on astronomy. This event in history is called the &quot;Andalusian Revolt&quot;, where he influenced many, including Al-Bitruji, to desert the Ptolemaic ideas. He was influential in the development of Islamic astronomy. Many later astronomers and scholars built upon his ideas and used his work as a basis for their own research and discoveries.

Many Islamic philosophers, writers, physicians, and astronomers have been influenced by Ibn Tufayl and his work. These people include Nur al-Din al-Bitruji, Abu ‘Abdallah Muhammad b. al-Abbar, Abd al-Wahid al-Marrakushi, Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari, and Ibn al-Khatib.
Ibn Tufayl served as the secretary of the Almohad governor of Granada, and later as the secretary of the Almohad governor of Ceuta and Tangiers (Abū Saʿīd ʿUthmān, one of &#x27;Abd al-Mu&#x27;min&#x27;s sons). Eventually, Ibn Tufayl moved to the service of Abū Yaʿqūb Yūsuf, who was a prince at the time and later became the second Almohad caliph.

==&quot;Hayy ibn Yaqzan&quot;==
Ibn Tufayl was the author of (), also known as Philosophus Autodidactus in Latin, a philosophical romance and allegorical novel inspired by Avicennism and Sufism, and which tells the story of an autodidactic feral child, raised by a gazelle and living alone on a desert island, who, without contact with other human beings, discovers ultimate truth through a systematic process of reasoned inquiry. Hayy ultimately comes into contact with civilization and religion when he meets a castaway named Absal (Asāl in some translations). He determines that certain trappings of religion, namely imagery and dependence on material goods, are necessary for the multitude in order that they might have decent lives. However, imagery and material goods are distractions from the truth and ought to be abandoned by those whose reason recognizes that they are. The names of the characters in the novel, Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān, Salamān, and Absāl were borrowed from Ibn Sina&#x27;s tales. The title of the novel is also the same as Ibn Sina&#x27;s novel. Ibn Tufayl did this on purpose to use the characters and the title as a small reference to Ibn Sina, as he wanted to touch upon his philosophy.

Ibn Tufayl&#x27;s &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot; was written as a response to al-Ghazali&#x27;s &quot;The Incoherence of the Philosophers&quot;. In the 13th century, Ibn al-Nafis later wrote the &quot;Al-Risalah al-Kamiliyyah fil Siera al-Nabawiyyah&quot; (known as &quot;Theologus Autodidactus&quot; in the West) as a response to Ibn Tufayl&#x27;s &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot;.

&quot;Hayy ibn Yaqdhan&quot; had a significant influence on both Arabic literature and European literature, and it went on to become an influential best-seller throughout Western Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. The work also had a &quot;profound influence&quot; on both classical Islamic philosophy and modern Western philosophy. It became &quot;one of the most important books that heralded the Scientific Revolution&quot; and European Enlightenment, and the thoughts expressed in the novel can be found &quot;in different variations and to different degrees in the books of Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Isaac Newton, and Immanuel Kant.&quot; 

A Latin translation of the work, entitled &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot;, first appeared in 1671, prepared by Edward Pococke the Younger. The first English translation (by Simon Ockley) was published in 1708. These translations later may have inspired Daniel Defoe to write &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, which also featured a desert island narrative. The novel is also thought to have inspired the concept of &quot;tabula rasa&quot; developed by John Locke, in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1690). Locke&#x27;s concept of &quot;tabula rasa&quot; refers to a state in which an infant is as formless as a blank slate. &quot;Locke&#x27;s &quot;Essay&quot; went on to become one of the principal sources of empiricism in modern Western philosophy, and influenced many enlightenment philosophers, such as David Hume and George Berkeley. Hayy&#x27;s ideas on materialism in the novel also have some similarities to Karl Marx&#x27;s historical materialism. It also foreshadowed Molyneux&#x27;s Problem, proposed by William Molyneux to Locke, who included it in the second book of &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;.
Other European writers influenced by &quot;Philosophus Autodidactus&quot; included Gottfried Leibniz, Melchisédech Thévenot, John Wallis, Christiaan Huygens, George Keith, Robert Barclay, the Quakers, Samuel Hartlib, and Voltaire. In more recent readings, Nadia Maftouni has coined the term &quot;Sciart&quot; for intertwined artistic and scientific activities and has described Ibn Tufayl&#x27;s &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqzan&quot; as a leading instant which touches on issues like human anatomy, autopsy, and vivisection within the confines of his novel.

<text>Robert Merrill (June 4, 1917 – October 23, 2004) was an American operatic baritone and actor, who was also active in the musical theatre circuit. He received the National Medal of Arts in 1993.

==Early life==
Merrill was born Moishe Miller, later known as Morris Miller, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York. He was the son of tailor Abraham Miller, originally Milstein, and his wife, Lillian (née Balaban), Jewish immigrants from Pultusk, Poland, near Warsaw. His paternal grandparents were Berl Milstein and Chana (née Mlawski), both from Pultusk, Poland. 

His mother claimed to have had an operatic and concert career in Poland (a fact denied by her son in his biographies) and encouraged her son to have early voice training: he had a stutter, which wasn&#x27;t apparent when singing. Merrill was inspired to pursue professional singing lessons when he saw the baritone Richard Bonelli singing Count Di Luna in a performance of &quot;Il Trovatore&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, and paid for them with money earned as a semi-professional pitcher.

==Radio and recordings==
In his early radio appearances as a crooner he was sometimes billed as Merrill Miller. While singing at bar mitzvahs and weddings and Borscht Belt resorts, he met an agent, Moe Gale, who found him work at Radio City Music Hall and with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Arturo Toscanini. With Toscanini conducting, he eventually sang in two of the maestro&#x27;s NBC Symphony broadcasts of famous operas, &quot;La traviata&quot; (with Licia Albanese, in 1946), and &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; (with Herva Nelli, in 1954). Both of those operas were recorded and later released on both LP and CD by RCA Victor. His ranking as an important NBC performer is evidenced by his inclusion in NBC&#x27;s 1947 promotional book, &quot;NBC Parade of Stars: As Heard Over Your Favorite NBC Station&quot;, displaying Sam Berman&#x27;s caricatures of leading NBC personalities.

Merrill&#x27;s 1944 operatic debut was in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; at Newark, New Jersey, with the famous tenor Giovanni Martinelli, then in the later stages of his long operatic career. Merrill, who had continued his vocal studies under Samuel Margolis made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as winner of the Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air in 1945, as Germont in &quot;La traviata&quot;. Also in 1945, Merrill recorded a 78 rpm album set with Jeanette MacDonald, featuring selections from the operetta &quot;Up in Central Park&quot;; MacDonald and Merrill sang two duets together on this album.
In 1951, Merrill recorded a series of operatic duets with the Swedish tenor Jussi Björling for RCA Victor, including a world-renowned recording of &quot;Au fond du temple saint&quot; from the opera &quot;Les pêcheurs de perles&quot; by Georges Bizet. That same year he participated in another celebrated RCA Victor recording, Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; with Risë Stevens and Jan Peerce, conducted by Fritz Reiner.

In 1952 Merrill, Björling, and Victoria de los Ángeles made a widely admired RCA Victor recording of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1953, Merrill, Björling, de los Angeles and Zinka Milanov recorded the complete &quot;Pagliacci&quot; and &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;.

==Metropolitan Opera==
His role in the musical comedy film &quot;Aaron Slick from Punkin Crick&quot; (1952) led to a conflict with Sir Rudolf Bing and a brief departure from the Met in 1951. Merrill sang many different baritone roles, and after the on-stage death of the celebrated Leonard Warren in 1960, became the Met&#x27;s principal baritone, sharing that position in a few years with Cornell MacNeil. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he appeared under the direction of Alfredo Antonini in performances of arias from the Italian operatic repertoire for the open air &quot;Italian Night&quot; concert series at Lewisohn Stadium in New York City.

He was described by &quot;Time&quot; as &quot;one of the Met&#x27;s best baritones&quot;. Yet reviews were not consistently good: &quot;Opera&quot; magazine reported on a Metropolitan Opera performance of &quot;Barber of Seville&quot; in which Merrill delivered &quot;by all odds the most insensitive impersonation of the season&quot;. He was accused by the reviewer of &quot;loud, coarse sounds&quot; and &quot;no grace, no charm, as he butchered the text and galumphed around the stage&quot;.

==Later career==

Merrill appeared on &quot;Voice of Firestone&quot; with Joanne Hill.

Merrill also continued to perform on radio and television, in nightclubs and recitals. In 1973, Merrill teamed up with Richard Tucker to present a concert at Carnegie Hall—a first for the two &quot;vocal supermen&quot; (as one critic dubbed them), and a first &quot;for the demanding New York public and critics,&quot; Merrill recalled. The event marked a precedent that eventually led to the &quot;Three Tenors&quot; concerts many years later. Merrill retired from the Met in 1976. In 1977, he appeared on the TV special &quot;Sinatra &amp; Friends,&quot; soloing &quot;If I Were A Rich Man&quot; and performing &quot;The Oldest Established Permanent Floating Crap Game in New York&quot; with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. For many years, he led services, often in Borscht Belt hotels, on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.

In honor of Merrill&#x27;s vast influence on American vocal music, on February 16, 1981, he was awarded the prestigious University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit.

First awarded in 1964, the Award of Merit honors an individual that has &quot;made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression.&quot;
In 1996, at a reception at Lincoln Center, Merrill was presented with The Lawrence Tibbett Award from the AGMA Relief Fund, honoring his fifty years of professional achievement and dedication to colleagues. The AGMA Relief Fund, award sponsor, provides financial assistance and support services to classical performing artists in need.

==Sporting events==
Relatively late in his singing career, Merrill also became known for singing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at Yankee Stadium and Giants Stadium. He first sang the national anthem to open the 1967 baseball season, and it became a tradition for the Yankees to bring him back each year on Opening Day and special occasions. He sang at various Old Timer&#x27;s Days (wearing his own pinstriped Yankee uniform with the number &quot;1&quot; on the back) and the emotional pre-game ceremony in memory of Thurman Munson at Yankee Stadium on August 3, 1979, the day after the catcher died in a plane crash. Merrill also sang at one World Series game in each year the Yankees played the Fall Classic at the stadium, starting in 1976. A recorded Merrill version is still sometimes used at Yankee Stadium, mainly at Old Timer&#x27;s Day. In 2021, the Yankees replaced the live organ version of &quot;God Bless America&quot; that had played for almost two years with Merrill&#x27;s cover.

Merrill preferred a traditional approach to the song, devoid of additional ornamentation, as he explained to &quot;Newsday&quot; in 2000, &quot;When you sing the anthem, there&#x27;s a legitimacy to it. I&#x27;m extremely bothered by these different interpretations of it.&quot; Merrill appeared opposite Adam Sandler in a scene singing the national anthem, in the 2003 film &quot;Anger Management&quot;. Merrill joked that an entire generation of people know him as &quot;The &#x27;Say-Can-You-See&#x27; guy!&quot; (&quot;Agmazine&quot;, April 1996).

==Personal life==
While there has been dispute regarding his birth year (some claim he was born in 1919), the Social Security Death Index, his family, and his gravestone state that he was born in 1917.

Merrill married soprano Roberta Peters in 1952, however they divorced shortly afterwards. He had two children with his second wife, Marion Machno, a pianist. Merrill liked to play golf and was a member of the Westchester Country Club in Rye, New York, for many years.

He wrote two books of memoirs, &quot;Once More from the Beginning&quot; (1965) and &quot;Between Acts&quot; (1976), and he co-authored a novel, &quot;The Divas&quot; (1978).

Merrill toured all over the world with his arranger and conductor, Angelo DiPippo, who wrote most of his act and performed at concert halls throughout the world.

==Death==
Merrill died at his home in New Rochelle, New York, at age 87. He is interred at the Sharon Gardens Cemetery in Valhalla, New York, which is the Jewish division of Kensico Cemetery. His headstone features an opera curtain that has been drawn open.

His epitaph states: &quot;Like a bursting celestial star, he showered his family and the world with love, joy, and beauty. Encore please.&quot;

==Performances with the Metropolitan Opera==

<text>Kropyvnytskyi (, ) is a city in central Ukraine, situated on the Inhul River. It serves as the administrative center of Kirovohrad Oblast. Population: 

Over its history, Kropyvnytskyi has changed its name several times. The settlement was known as Yelysavethrad after Empress Elizabeth of Russia from 1752 to 1924, or simply Elysavet. In 1924, as part of the Soviet Union, it became known as Zinovievsk in honour of the revolutionary Grigory Zinoviev, who was born there. Following the assassination of Sergei Kirov in 1934, the town was renamed Kirovo in his honour.

Concurrently with the formation of Kirovohrad Oblast on 10 January 1939, and to distinguish it from Kirov Oblast in central Russia, Kirovo was renamed Kirovohrad. As part of independent Ukraine, the name of the city was then changed to &quot;Kropyvnytskyi&quot; in 2016 due to decommunization laws, in honour of Marko Kropyvnytskyi, who was born near the city. However, Kirovohrad Oblast was not renamed because it is mentioned in the Constitution of Ukraine – only a constitutional amendment could change the name of the oblast.

Notable figures born in the city include Grigory Zinoviev, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Arseny Tarkovsky, Afrikan Spir, Marko Kropyvnytskyi, and others.

==Name origins==

=== Yelisavetgrad ===

The name &quot;Yelisavetgrad&quot; (usually spelled Elisavetgrad or Elizabethgrad in English language publications) is believed to have evolved as the amalgamation of the fortress name and the common Eastern Slavonic element &quot;-grad&quot; (Old/Church Slavonic &quot;градъ&quot;, &quot;a settlement encompassed by a wall&quot;). Its first documented usage dates back to 1764, when Yelisavetgrad Province was organized together with the Yelisavetgrad Lancer Regiment.

Presenting a letter of grant on January 11, 1752, to Major-General Jovan Horvat, the organizer of New Serbia settlements, Empress Elizabeth of Russia ordered &quot;to found an earthen fortress and name it Fort St. Elizabeth&quot;. Thus simultaneously the future city was named in honour of its formal founder, the Russian empress, and also in honor of her heavenly patroness, St. Elizabeth.

=== Zinovievsk ===

Following the Russian Revolution and founding of the Soviet Union, in 1924 the city was renamed Zinovievsk, after Grigory Zinoviev, a Soviet statesman and one of the leaders of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). He was born in Yelisavetgrad on September 20 (September 8 O.S.), 1883. At the time he was honored by the name, he was a member of the Politburo and the Chairman of the Comintern&#x27;s Executive Committee.

=== Kirovo and Kirovograd ===

On December 27, 1934, after the assassination of Sergei Kirov, Zinovievsk and other Soviet cities was renamed again - this time as Kirovo, and then as Kirovohrad. The latter name appeared simultaneously with the creation of Kirovograd Oblast, on January 10, 1939 and was aimed at differentiating the region from Kirov Oblast in present-day Russia.

After Ukraine regained independence, the name of the city started to be spelled according to Ukrainian pronunciation as Kirovohrad. The previous Russified orthography remains widely used on account of the widespread use of the Russian language in the region.

=== Kropyvnytskyi ===

Since 1991 numerous discussions had been held on the city&#x27;s name. A number of activists supported returning the city to its original name, Yelisavetgrad (or now Yelysavethrad in Ukrainian transcription). Other suggestions for contemporary Ukraine included &quot;Tobilevychi&quot; (in honour of the Tobilevych family, the Coryphaei of the classic Ukrainian drama established in Yelysavethrad in 1882); &quot;Zlatopil&quot;, from Ukrainian &quot;золоте поле&quot;, literally &quot;golden field&quot;; and &quot;Stepohrad&quot;, Ukrainian for &quot;city of steppes&quot; (in recognition of the agricultural status of the city); &quot;Ukrainsk&quot; or &quot;Ukrainoslav&quot;, i.e. &quot;the glorifying Ukraine one;&quot; and &quot;Novokozachyn&quot; (to commemorate the semi-famous Cossack regiment which could have been quartered at the present-day city location).

The President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, signed the bill banning Communist symbols on May 15, 2015, which required places associated with communism to be renamed within a six-month period. On 25 October 2015 (during local elections) 76.6% of the Kirovohrad voters voted for renaming the city to Yelysavethrad. A draft law at the time before the Ukrainian parliament would prohibit any names associated with Russian history since the 14th century, which would make the name Yelysavethrad inadmissible as well. A committee of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine&#x27;s parliament) chose the name Inhulsk on 23 December 2015. This name is a reference to the nearby Inhul river. On 31 March 2016 the State Construction, Regional Policy and the Local help committee of the Verkhovna Rada recommended to parliament to rename Kirovohrad to Kropyvnytskyi. This name is a reference to writer, actor and playwright Marko Kropyvnytskyi, who was born near the city. On 14 July 2016, the name of the city was finally changed to Kropyvnytskyi.

==Administrative status==

Kropyvnytskyi serves as administrative center of Kropyvnytskyi Raion and hosts the administration of Kropyvnytskyi urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine.

Until 18 July 2020, Kropyvnytskyi was designated as a city of oblast significance and belonged to Kropyvnytskyi Municipality but not to Kropyvnytskyi Raion even though it was the center of the raion. It is divided into two districts — Fortechnyi and Podilskyi. The urban-type settlement of Nove is part of the Fortechnyi District. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kirovohrad Oblast to four, Kropyvnytskyi Municipality was merged into Kropyvnytskyi Raion.

==History==
=== Before the foundation ===

In the 16th and the first half of the 18th centuries, the lands of modern Kropyvnytskyi and its adjacent districts belonged to Zaporozhian Sich. On the territory of modern Kropyvnytskyi were located the settlements of Ukrainian Cossacs, which gradually turned into districts of the city, including Kuschivka, Zavadivka and Velyka Balka.

=== 18th and 19th century: from military settlement to trade centre ===
The history of the city beginnings dates back to the year 1754 when Fort St. Elizabeth was built on the lands of former Zaporozhian Sich in the upper course of the Inhul, Suhokleya and Biyanka Rivers.

On January 9, 1752, the Senate, based on the petition of the Serbian colonel Jovan Horvat, issues a decree on the creation of New Serbia and the construction of the 
fortress of St. Elizabeth for its protection. In January 1752, the decree was signed by Elizabeth of Russia, on the basis of which a thanks letter was issued to Ivan Horvath and instructions to Ivan Glebov. The mentioned documents didnt indicate the place of construction of the fortress, so it was chosen by order of Ivan Glebov. The Hadiach-Myrhorod regiment of Ukrainian Cossacks (1390 males) arrived to build the fortress, which completed the main works in four months: from June to October 1754. During the work, 72 Zaporozhians died, 233 fell ill, and 855 ran away to Sich. This fort played a pivotal role in the new lands added to Russia by the Belgrad Peace Treaty of 1739. In 1764 the settlement received status of the center of the Elizabeth province. Also, it was from this fortress at the end of May 1775 that a 100,000-strong army led by the general Peter Tekeli set out, which on June 15 destroyed Zaporozhian Sich. In 1784 the status of chief town of a district, when it was renamed after the fort as city of &quot;Yelyzavethrad&quot;.
The Fort of St. Elizabeth was on a crossroads of trade routes, and it eventually became a major trade center. The city has held regular fairs four times a year. Merchants from all over the Russian Empire have visited these fairs. Also, there were numerous foreign merchants, especially from Greece. The main architect of the city in the middle of the 19th century was Dostoevsky’s brother, Andrey. Also here born writers minodav Shpolyansky (Don Aminado), Yuri Daragan and Arseny Tarkovsky. Developed around the military settlement, the city rose to prominence in the 19th century when it became an important trade centre, as well as a Ukrainian cultural leader with the first professional theatrical company in either Central or Eastern Ukraine being established here in 1882 (Theatre of Coryphaei), founded by Mark Kropyvnytsky, Tobilevych brothers and Maria Zankovetska.

=== Early 20th century: famine and pogroms ===
Elizabethgrad was ravaged by famine in 1901 and its residents suffered more due to poor government response. 

The region is extremely fertile. However, a drought in 1892 and poor farming methods which never allowed the soil to recover, prompted a large famine that plagued the region. According to a 1901 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, the Ministry of the Interior denied the persistence of famine in the region and blocked non-State charities from bringing aid to the area. The reporter wrote, &quot;The existence of famine was inconvenient at a time when negotiations were pending for foreign loans.&quot; The governor of the Kherson region, Prince Oblonsky, refused to acknowledge this famine. One non-resident and non-State worker entered Elizabethgrad and provided &quot;The New York Times&quot; with an eyewitness account. He observed: general and acute destitution; deaths from starvation; widespread typhus (shows poverty), and little to no work to be found in the region.

Elizabethgrad was located in the Pale of Settlement and, during the 19th century, had a substantial Jewish population.

Elizabethgrad was subjected to several violent pogroms in the late 19th and early 20th century. In 1905 another riot flared, with Christians killing Jews and plundering the Jewish quarter. A contemporary account was reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on December 13, 1905.

=== Ukrainian War of Independence and Ukrainian–Soviet War ===
During the Ukrainian revolution, the government in the city changed several times. The City Council recognized the authority of the Central Rada on December 19, 1917. in January-February 1918, street battles took place here between supporters of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic on one side and the Bolsheviks and their allies - anarchists led by Maria Nikiforova, on the other.

On 7 May 1919, paramilitary leader, and former divisional general in the Red Army, Nykyfor Hryhoriv, launched an anti-Bolshevik uprising. On 8 May 1919, he issued a proclamation &quot;To the Ukrainian People&quot; (&quot;До Українського народу&quot;), in which he called upon the Ukrainian people to rise against the &quot;Communist imposters&quot;, singling out the &quot;Jewish commissars&quot; and the Cheka. In only a few weeks, Hryhoriv&#x27;s troops perpetrated 148 pogroms, the deadliest of which resulted in the massacre of upwards of 1,000 Jewish people in Yelisavetgrad, from 15 to 17 May 1919. In total, about 3,000 Jews died in the city.

The Soviet Red Army eventually reconquered the city in 1920,

=== Ukrainian SSR ===
During Soviet rule, in the Ukrainian SSR, the city economy was dominated by such enterprises as Chervona Zirka Agricultural Machinery Plant (current name Elvorti; which once provided more than 50% of the USSR need in tractor seeders), Hydrosila Hydraulic Units Plant, Radiy Radio Component Plant, Pishmash Typewriter Plant (de facto defunct nowadays) and others.

During the Holodomor and Great Purge, 2238 residents of the city died.

In World War II, the city was occupied by Nazi Germany from 5 August 1941. From October 1941, the occupiers operated the Stalag 305 prisoner-of-war camp in the city, following its relocation from Rzeszów in German-occupied Poland. Abysmal conditions combined with scarce food rations even led to acts of cannibalism, whereas Jews and communists were executed. It was subsequently recaptured by Soviet forces on 8 January 1944.

=== Independent Ukraine ===
During the Ukrainian presidential election of 2004 the city achieved country-wide notoriety due to mass election fraud committed by local authorities and after that became known as District 100 (its community number according to the Central Elections Committee).

After the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War, the policy of decommunization was introduced, during which the city was renamed in honor of the founder of the first Ukrainian theater, Marko Kropyvnytskyi.

==== Russian invasion of Ukraine ====
With the beginning of Russia&#x27;s large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the city began to suffer from rocket attacks by the Russian army. On the morning of 1 March 2022, the Russian occupiers fired at the Kanatove airfield near Kropyvnytskyi, trying to destroy infrastructure facilities. On 12 March 2022, Russian troops attacked the airfield near the Kanatove railway station, as a result of which 7 soldiers were killed. On the morning of 23 July 2022, 13 missiles arrived (8 Kalibr sea-based missiles and 5 Kh-22 missiles from the TU-22M3 aircraft). The enemy fired at a military airfield and a railway facility. As the result, 19 were wounded and 3 were killed. Air alarms sounded almost daily in the city.

As of 24 May 2022, there were more than 40,000 forcibly displaced people from regions of active hostilities in the city and region. According to data on 29 August 2022, this figure increased to 85,000 people. Also, during the war, various institutions and enterprises moved to Kropyvnytskyi, including Donetsk State University of Internal Affairs from Mariupol (originally Donetsk), Kharkiv Research Institute of Prosthetics, Donetsk National Medical University from Kramatorsk (originally Donetsk) and Kherson State Agrarian and Economical University.


==Geography==
The city is in the center of Ukraine and within the Dnieper Upland. The Inhul river flows through Kropyvnytskyi. Within the city, several other smaller rivers and brooks runs in the Inhul; they include the Suhoklia and the Biyanka.

===Urban layout===
The city began as a settlement built in adjustment to a fortress called &quot;Yelizaveta Fortress&quot;. At the end of 1757, the earthen fortifications were almost ready. Only the internal layout has changed, retaining its dimensions (55x55 sazhens). North of the fortress of St. Elizabeth, behind a small ravine on the banks of the Ingul, a soldier&#x27;s settlement arose under the name of Grechesky or Bykovo, named after captain Bykov who was the commandant of the fortress. The main streets of Bykovo were Nizhne-Bykovskaya (Pushkin St.). Verkhne-Bykovaya (Chapaeva), Ostrovskaya, Vasilievskaya, Andreevskaya (retained its original name), Artem, Kakhovskaya, Tobilevich, Pushkina Lane, Znamensky, and Sibirskaya.
To the east of the fortress, the Permskoye suburb appeared. It got its name from the camp of the Perm (Carabinieri) Regiment (), called in 1754 to cover the working people and eradicate the Gaidamaks. Permskoye was located between the river and the esplanade zone, it was a small residential area, numbering a dozen blocks with straight streets and lanes. The main streets of Perm were - (Bolshaya Permskaya), Fisanovich, Sverdlov, Bobrinetskaya, Gorky, International, lanes Krepostnoy, Postal, Ogorodny.

Soon, buildings appeared on the other side of the Ingul. This part of the settlement was called Podil and is today forming the central part of the city. The drawings of 1762 indicate that a large residential area arose here, cut by streets 10-12 sazhens wide into a grid of square and rectangular quarters. It became the core of a rapidly growing village. The main streets on Podil were Marksa Street (Bolshaya Perspektivnaya, Nikolaevsky Prospekt), Dzerzhinskya (Moskovskaya), Lenina (Dvortsovaya, Verkhne-Donskaya), Timiryazeva (Nizhne-Donskaya), Gogola (Uspenskaya), K. Liebknecht (Preobrazhenskaya, Merchant ), R. Luxembourg, (Pokrovskaya), Kalinina (Mirgorodskaya), Decembrists (Ingulskad), Company (Nevskaya, Pashutinskaya), Volodarsky (Aleksandrovskaya), Kirov (Mikhailovskaya), Krasnogvardeiskaya (Arkhangelskaya), Karabinernaya (retained its original name).

While Bykovo and Permsky quarters were built up by the headquarters department for soldiers and officers, then in Podil they are occupied by houses of merchants and artisans. The settlements of Kovalevka and Balka, apparently founded by the Cossacks, adjoined the outskirts (in the territory of the modern part of the Balka, there is still a lane called Cossack). These settlements, which eventually merged with the suburban development into a single planning structure, initially had a picturesque, free tracing of the street network. But, if over time the layout of the Balka was subjected to only partial regulation, then only small fragments remained of the original layout of Kovalevka (Bebel St., Transportnaya St., Molodezhny Lane).

Almost simultaneously with the appearance of the suburb, the following were built: the city market (on the site of an existing shopping center), the wooden Assumption Church (on the site of the regional committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine), the wooden Vladimirskaya (Greek Church), the wooden Znamenskaya Church (on Bykovo), the schismatic prayer house. These objects with ordinary, mainly wooden manor buildings, as well as with fortress structures, determined the appearance of the city in the first ten years of its development.

The planning architectural and spatial composition of the central part of the settlement consisted in the hierarchical subordination of its main street (B. Perspektivnaya, K. Marksa) with the square on it and ordinary low-rise buildings. Among this development, public houses and shops were sharp accents, and the Assumption and Vladimir churches served as dominants. The street served as the main axis of the entire composition. It divided the suburb into two equal parts and the direction of its route almost coincided with the center of the fortress. Thus, the fortress with the church in it turned into the third main dominant of the street, although it was located outside its boundaries.

In plan, the area was rectangular with an aspect ratio of 1:3 (50x150 m.). On one of the smaller sides, it adjoined the main street (Bolshaya Perspektivnaya), and on the wide side it adjoined the market and a small quarter, like the square, which is now included in the territory of the market.

From the side of the market on the square there were a gostiny dvor and butcher shops, and on the opposite and smaller sides - public buildings. Within the retranchement, the city occupied an area of 2.3 sq. km. (1.8 x 1.5 km.). From the period of the formation of the city the fortress of St. Elizabeth was the town-planning core of the settlement, the place of concentration or attraction of all its main functions. The central administrative function was concentrated in the fortress. This is the administrative management of the fortress, the subordination of the chiefs of the suburbs and settlements to the commandant of the fortress, the presence in it of the regimental office of the Cossack regiment. The religious center was also located in the fortress of St. Elizabeth, the Trinity Cathedral Church (ruined in 1813). The central trading function also gravitated towards the fortress. Its place of concentration is the main square. The trade function developed with the settlement of lands by artisans and merchants. And their appearance was due to the need to service military units inside a large fortress.

====Soviet period====
Parallel to the Biayanka river, new streets were formed in the settlement of Balka. New quarters have grown in the village, such as Kushchevka and Novo-Alekseevka. Former village Balashovka merged with the city and organically entered its planning structure. In 1930, a general plan for the development of the city was developed. According to this plan, on the site of the square in front of the former town hall, the main square of the city was formed with a monument to Kirov in its center. In the 50s, The construction of 2-storey buildings began in the areas of Lunacharskogo and Mira streets. Also in the late 40s - early 50s. 3, 5-storey houses are being built on the Marksa Street. From the 60s, construction of massive housing estates was commenced, with Cheryomushki located in the south-west of the city being first such district, designed according to the plan of architect A.A. Sidorenko. Such housing estate was constructed also in Novo-Nikolaevka District. New master plan for the city was developed by the Kharkiv Institute Ukrgorstroyproekt, taking into account the placement of a residential multi-storey buildings in the new territories of the south-west. New residential areas were built along Heroyev Ukrainy Street (formerly Volkova Street). In the 60s, the industrial district along Balashovsky district was developed.

===Architecture===
From 1878 to 1905 Oleksandr Pashutin served as mayor of the city. Under his administration, advances were made in the areas of education and medicine, construction of the water-supply system and several public buildings, the introduction of the first tram and the establishment of numerous marketplaces. Kropyvnytskyi is noted for the quality of its architecture, with European-style sculptures and antique windows. A range of classical and modern monuments, Moorish and Baroque palaces, and buildings that combine Gothic, Rococo and Renaissance motives are extant to this day. Today a high level of building technology of Kropyvnytskyi&#x27;s masters encourages further construction and restoration.

==Symbols==
Three blue stripes crossed in the middle of the fortress plan symbolize the fortification location at the confluence of the Inhul, Suhukleya and Biyanka rivers. The crimson colour favoured by Cossacks refers to the fortress being situated on the lands of the Zaporozhian Cossacks. Golden ears together with a golden field on the shield are symbols of the fertile lands and notable agricultural wealth of the region.

The shield is held by storks, which symbolizes happiness, fertility, and love for the native land. The golden tower in the form of a crown expresses that the city is a regional centre. The motto &quot;With peace and good&quot; placed on the azure stripe emphasizes that same idea. All the features of the flag correlate with the principal elements of the escutcheon on the coat of arms of the city.

=== Language ===
Distribution of the population by native language according to the 2001 census:
According to a survey conducted by the International Republican Institute in April–May 2023, 77% of the city&#x27;s population spoke Ukrainian at home, and 20% spoke Russian.

<text>Isaac Israeli ben Solomon ( ; ; – ), also known as Isaac Israeli the Elder and Isaac Judaeus, was a Jewish physician and philosopher. He was one of the foremost Jewish academics living in the Arab world of his time, and is regarded as the father of medieval Jewish Neoplatonism. His works, all written in Arabic and subsequently translated into Hebrew, Latin, and Spanish, entered the medical curriculum of European universities in the early 13th century and remained popular throughout the rest of the Middle Ages.

==Biography==
Little is known of Israeli&#x27;s background and career. Much that is known comes from the biographical accounts found in &quot;The Generations of the Physicians&quot;, a work written by the Andalusian Arab author Ibn Juljul in the second half of the 10th century, and in &quot;Tabaqāt al-ʼUmam (Categories of Nations)&quot; by Sa&#x27;id of Toledo, who wrote in the mid-11th century. In the 13th century, Ibn Abi Usaybi&#x27;a also produced an account, which he based on Ibn Juljul as well as other sources, including the &quot;History of the Fatimid Dynasty&quot; by Israeli&#x27;s pupil Ibn al-Jazzar.

Israeli was born in around 832 into a Jewish family in Egypt. He lived the first half of his life in Cairo where he gained a reputation as a skillful oculist. He corresponded with Saadya ben Joseph al-Fayyumi (882–942), one of the most influential figures in medieval Judaism, prior to his departure from Egypt. In about 904, Israeli was nominated court physician to the last Aghlabid prince, Ziyadat Allah III. Between the years 905–907 he travelled to Kairouan where he studied general medicine under Ishak ibn Amran al-Baghdadi, with whom he is sometimes confounded (&quot;Sefer ha-Yashar,&quot; p. 10a). Later he served as a doctor to the founder of the Fatimid Dynasty of North Africa, &#x27;Ubaid Allah al-Mahdi, who reigned from 910–934. The caliph enjoyed the company of his Jewish physician on account of the latter&#x27;s wit and of the repartees in which he succeeded in confounding the Greek al-Hubaish when pitted against him. In Kairouan his fame became widely extended, the works which he wrote in Arabic being considered by the Muslim physicians as &quot;more valuable than gems.&quot; His lectures attracted a large number of pupils, of whom the two most prominent were Abu Ja&#x27;far ibn al-Jazzar, a Muslim, and Dunash ibn Tamim. Israeli studied natural history, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, and other scientific topics; he was reputed to be one who knew all the &quot;seven sciences&quot;.

Biographers state that he never married or fathered children. He died at Kairouan, Tunisia, in 932. This date is given by most Arabic authorities who give his date of birth as 832. But Abraham ben Hasdai, quoting the biographer Sanah ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Kurtubi (&quot;Orient, Lit.&quot; iv., col. 230), says that Isaac Israeli died in 942. Heinrich Grätz (&quot;Geschichte&quot; v. 236), while stating that Isaac Israeli lived more than one hundred years, gives the dates 845–940; and Steinschneider (&quot;Hebr. Uebers.&quot; pp. 388, 755) places his death in 950. He died in Kairouan.

==Influence==
In 956 his pupil Dunash Ibn Tamim wrote an extensive commentary on Sefer Yetzirah, a mystical work of cosmogony which attributes great importance to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet and their combinations in determining the structure of the universe. In this work he cites Israeli so extensively that a few nineteenth-century scholars misidentified the commentary as Israeli&#x27;s.

Israeli&#x27;s medical treatises were studied for several centuries both in the original Arabic and in Latin translation. In the eleventh century, Constantine Africanus, a professor at the prestigious Salerno school of medicine, translated some of Israeli&#x27;s works into Latin. Many medieval Arabic biographical chronicles of physicians list him and his works.

Israeli&#x27;s philosophical works exercised a considerable influence on Christian and Jewish thinkers, and a lesser degree of influence among Muslim intellectuals. In the twelfth century, a group of scholars in Toledo transmitted many Arabic works of science and philosophy into Latin. One of the translators, Gerard of Cremona, rendered Israeli&#x27;s &quot;Book of Definitions&quot; (&quot;Liber de Definicionibus/Definitionibus&quot;) and &quot;Book on the Elements&quot; (&quot;Liber Elementorum&quot;) into Latin. Israeli&#x27;s work was quoted and paraphrased by a number of Christian thinkers including Gundissalinus, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Vincent de Beauvais, Bonaventura, Roger Bacon and Nicholas of Cusa. Isaac Israeli&#x27;s philosophical influence on Muslim authors is slight at best. The only known quotation of Israeli&#x27;s philosophy in a Muslim work occurs in Ghayat al-Hakim, a book on magic, produced in eleventh-century Spain, translated into Latin and widely circulated in the West under the title Picatrix. Although there are passages which correspond directly to Israeli&#x27;s writings, the author does not cite him by name.

His influence also extended to Moses Ibn Ezra (c. 1060–1139) who quotes Isaac Israeli without attribution in his treatise &quot;The Book of the Garden&quot;, explaining the meaning of Metaphor and Literal Expression. The poet and philosopher Joseph Ibn Tzaddiq of Cordoba (d. 1149) authored a work &quot;The Microcosm&quot; containing many ideas indebted to Israeli.

As Neoplatonist philosophy waned, in addition to the Galenic medical tradition of which Israeli was a part, the appreciable influence of Isaac Israeli diminished as well.

==Claimed works==
A number of works in Arabic, some of which were translated into Hebrew, Latin and Spanish were ascribed to Israeli, and several medical works were allegedly composed by him at the request of al-Mahdi. In 1515 &quot;Opera Omnia Isaci&quot; was published in Lyon, France, and the editor of this work claimed that the works originally written in Arabic and translated into Latin in 1087 by Constantine of Carthage, who assumed their authorship, were a &#x27;plagiarism&#x27; and published them under Israeli&#x27;s name, together in a collection with works of other physicians that were also and erroneously attributed to Israeli. Those works translated by Constantine of Carthage were used as textbooks at the University of Salerno, the earliest university in Western Europe, where Constantine was a professor of medicine, and remained in use as textbooks throughout Europe until the seventeenth century.

He was the first physician to write about tracheotomy in Arabic. He advised a hook to grasp the skin in the neck as Paulus of Aegina did and afterwards Avicenna and Albucasis.

===Medical works===
*&quot;Kitab al-Ḥummayat&quot;, &quot;The Book on Fevers&quot;, in Hebrew &quot;Sefer ha-Ḳadaḥot, ספר הקדחות&quot;, a complete treatise, in five books, on the kinds of fever, according to the ancient physicians, especially Hippocrates and Galen. &quot;The Book on Fevers&quot; appeared in the Articella.
*&quot;Kitab al-Adwiyah al-Mufradah wa&#x27;l-Aghdhiyah&quot;, a work in four sections on remedies and aliments. The first section, consisting of twenty chapters, was translated into Latin by Constantine under the title &quot;Diætæ Universales&quot;, and into Hebrew by an anonymous translator under the title &quot;Ṭib&#x27;e ha-Mezonot&quot;. The other three parts of the work are entitled in the Latin translation &quot;Diætæ Particulares&quot;; and it seems that a Hebrew translation, entitled &quot;Sefer ha-Mis&#x27;adim&quot; or &quot;Sefer ha-Ma&#x27;akalim&quot;, was made from the Latin.
*&quot;Kitab al-Baul&quot;, or in Hebrew &quot;Sefer ha-Shetan&quot;, a treatise on urine, of which the author himself made an abridgement.
*&quot;Kitab al-Istiḳat&quot;, in Hebrew &quot;Sefer ha-Yesodot&quot; and Latin as &quot;De Elementis&quot;, a medical and philosophical work on the elements, which the author treats according to the ideas of Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen. The Hebrew translation was made by Abraham ben Hasdai at the request of the grammarian David Kimhi.
*&quot;Manhig ha-Rofe&#x27;im&quot;, or &quot;Musar ha-Rofe&#x27;im&quot;, a treatise, in fifty paragraphs, for physicians, translated into Hebrew (the Arabic original is not extant), and into German by David Kaufmann under the title &quot;Propädeutik für Aerzte&quot; (Berliner&#x27;s &quot;Magazin,&quot; xi. 97–112).
*&quot;Kitab fi al-Tiryaḳ&quot;, a work on antidotes. Some writers attribute to Isaac Israeli two other works which figure among Constantine&#x27;s translations, namely, the &quot;Liber Pantegni&quot; and the &quot;Viaticum&quot;, of which there are three Hebrew translations. But the former belongs to Mohammed al-Razi and the latter to &#x27;Ali ibn &#x27;Abbas or, according to other authorities, to Israeli&#x27;s pupil Abu Jaf&#x27;ar ibn al-Jazzar.

===Philosophical works===
*&quot;Kitab al-Ḥudud wal-Rusum&quot;, translated into Hebrew by Nissim b. Solomon (fourteenth century) under the title &quot;Sefer ha-Gebulim weha-Reshumim&quot;, a philosophical work of which a Latin translation is quoted in the beginning of the &quot;Opera Omnia&quot;. This work and the &quot;Kitab al-Istiḳat&quot; were severely criticized by Maimonides in a letter to Samuel ibn Tibbon (&quot;Iggerot ha-Rambam&quot;, p. 28, Leipsic, 1859), in which he declared that they had no value, inasmuch as Isaac Israeli ben Solomon was nothing more than a physician.
*&quot;Kitab Bustan al-Ḥikimah&quot;, on metaphysics.
*&quot;Kitab al-Ḥikmah&quot;, a treatise on philosophy.
*&quot;Kitab al-Madkhal fi al-Mantiḳ&quot;, on logic. The last three works are mentioned by Ibn Abi Uṣaibi&#x27;a, but no Hebrew translations of them are known.
*&quot;Sefer ha-Ruaḥ weha-Nefesh&quot;, a philosophical treatise, in a Hebrew translation, on the difference between the spirit and the soul, published by Steinschneider in &quot;Ha-Karmel&quot; (1871, pp. 400–405). The editor is of opinion that this little work is a fragment of a larger one.
*A philosophical commentary on Genesis, in two books, one of which deals with Genesis i. 20.

===Attributed works===
Eliakim Carmoly (&quot;Ẓiyyon,&quot; i. 46) concludes that the Isaac who was so violently attacked by Abraham ibn Ezra in the introduction to his commentary on the Pentateuch, and whom he calls in other places &quot;Isaac the Prattler&quot;, and &quot;Ha-Yiẓḥaḳ,&quot; was none other than Isaac Israeli. But if Israeli was attacked by Ibn Ezra he was praised by other Biblical commentators, such as Jacob b. Ruben, a contemporary of Maimonides, and by Ḥasdai.

Another work which has been ascribed to Israeli, and which more than any other has given rise to controversy among later scholars, is a commentary on the &quot;Sefer Yeẓirah.&quot; Steinschneider (in his &quot;Al-Farabi,&quot; p. 248) and Carmoly (in Jost&#x27;s &quot;Annalen,&quot; ii. 321) attribute the authorship to Israeli, because Abraham ibn Ḥasdai (see above), and Jedaiah Bedersi in his apologetical letter to Solomon ben Adret (&quot;Orient, Lit.&quot; xi. cols. 166–169) speak of a commentary by Israeli on the &quot;Sefer Yeẓirah,&quot; though by some scholars the words &quot;Sefer Yeẓirah&quot; are believed to denote simply the &quot;Book of Genesis.&quot; But David Kaufmann (&quot;R. E. J.&quot; viii. 126), Sachs (&quot;Orient, Lit.&quot; l.c.), and especially Grätz (&quot;Geschichte&quot; v. 237, note 2) are inclined to attribute its authorship to Israeli&#x27;s pupil Dunash ibn Tamim.

<text>Īśvarakṛṣṇa (Sanskrit: ईश्वर कृष्णः, IAST: Īśvara Kṛṣṇa, ) (fl. 350 CE) was an Indian philosopher and sage. He was the author of &quot;Samkhyakarika&quot; (“Verses on Samkhya”), an account of the universe and its components (tattvas) according to the Samkhya school, one of the six schools of Hindu philosophy. &quot;Samkhyakarika&quot; is the earliest surviving authoritative text on classical Samkhya philosophy.

Isvara Krishna in &quot;Kārikā&quot; describes himself as laying down the essential teachings of Kapila as taught to &quot;Āsuri&quot; and by &quot;Āsuri&quot; to Pañcaśikha to himself. &quot;Samkhyakarika&quot; includes distilled statements on epistemology, metaphysics and soteriology of the Samkhya school. The text also refers to an earlier work of Samkhya philosophy called Ṣaṣṭitantra (science of sixty topics) which is now lost. The text was imported and translated into Chinese about the middle of the 6th century CE. The records of Al Biruni, the Persian visitor to India in the early 11th century, suggests Samkhyakarika was an established and definitive text in India in his times.

Samkhya philosophy is said to have inspired some early Buddhist schools, and versions of the Samkhya system are still used in many schools of Buddhism and Jainism. Samkhya is also the basis for the Yoga school. Different versions of this system are also used in Vaishnavism and Saivism.

<text>Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata (; &quot;La Plata Gymnastics and Fencing Club&quot;), also known simply as Gimnasia, is an Argentine professional sports club based in the city of La Plata, Buenos Aires Province. Founded in 1887 as &quot;Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima&quot;, the club is mostly known for its football team, which currently plays in Primera División, the first division of the Argentine football league system. The club was most famously managed by footballing legend Diego Maradona, from September 2019 until his death in November 2020.

Apart from football, CGE also hosts a large number of sports such as athletics, basketball, boxing, chess, fencing, futsal, artistic gymnastics, field hockey, martial arts (aikido, karate, kendo, taekwondo), swimming, roller skating, tennis, volleyball, and weightlifting.

==History==

The &quot;Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata&quot; was founded on 3 June 1887 as a civil association, and thus is the oldest surviving football club still participating in the Argentine league. The club also claims to be the oldest football club in the Americas, despite other football clubs, such as Peruvian Lima Cricket F.C., having older foundation dates. Its foundation came barely five years after the creation of the City of La Plata in 1882.

The first sports offered to its members were, as its Spanish name indicates, gymnastics and fencing. Clubs supporting these sports were common among the upper classes at the end of the 19th century (&quot;cf.&quot; the prior foundation of Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires in 1880). Later on, other disciplines were added, including track and field, football, basketball and rugby.
The institution changed name a few times: from April to December 1897 it was called a &quot;Club de Esgrima&quot; (in English, &quot;Fencing Club&quot;) because fencing was the only activity practised at that moment. On 17 December 1897 it returned to its original name: &quot;Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima&quot; (&quot;Gymnastics and Fencing Club&quot;). From July 1952 to 30 September 1955, the club was named &quot;Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima de Eva Perón&quot; (&quot;Gymnastics and Fencing Club of Eva Perón&quot;), because the city of La Plata itself had been renamed &quot;Eva Perón&quot; in 1952, after Eva Perón&#x27;s death. The city returned to its previous name during the government of the &quot;Liberating Revolution&quot;, and so did the club. However, it remained unduly identified legally as &quot;Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima &quot;de&quot; La Plata&quot; (&quot;Gymnastics and Fencing Club of La Plata&quot;), a mistake that was corrected on 7 August 1964 after the new statute was approved.

Gimnasia y Esgrima was promoted to the first division after becoming champions of the División Intermedia of Argentine football in 1915. Later, in 1929, the club won its first Primera División championship. During successive years, Gimnasia became champion of Primera B in 1944, 1947 and 1952 and won the Copa Centenario de la AFA in 1994. Additionally, the squad has been a runner-up in the Primera División on five occasions. The club has remained at the top level of Argentine football for 73 seasons, giving it with Newell&#x27;s Old Boys the eighth longest participation at this level.

==Clásico Platense==
The Clásico Platense (La Plata derby) is the nickname given to the match between La Plata&#x27;s two main football teams: Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata and Estudiantes de La Plata. The first official derby took place as part of the Primera División season on 27 August 1916. On that occasion, Gimnasia won 1–0 over Estudiantes, with an own goal by Ludovico Pastor.

The first derby of the professional era took place on 14 June 1931. Between 12 August 1932 and 9 September 1934 Gimnasia won five consecutive La Plata derbies, the longest run of victories in that derby until Estudiantes emulated that feat in 2006–08. On 25 June 1963 Gimnasia obtained a 5–2 victory, this being the best result so far against Estudiantes. On the other hand, Gimnasia&#x27;s worst result was a 7–0 defeat on 15 October 2006.

A curiosity among the derbies occurred on 5 April 1992, when Gimnasia won over Estudiantes 1–0 at the latter&#x27;s stadium. On that date, as the stands erupted and Gimnasia&#x27;s fans shouted in celebration at the goal being scored, the seismograph of the local Astronomical Observatory registered a low-intensity seismic event. That goal was scored by the Uruguayan José Perdomo on a freekick, and it has been known ever since as &quot;El gol del terremoto&quot; (&quot;The earthquake goal&quot;).

==Presidents==
Through more than 120 years of history, the Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata has had 56 presidents, who are elected individuals who took on the responsibility of steering the Institution. Many of them contributed to the growth of the club over the years. Some of them have remained more vivid in the fans&#x27; memory for their achievements or outstanding works.

Saturnino Perdriel was the founder and first president of Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata. Perdriel was a merchant during the first few years of the city of La Plata, in addition to being a civil servant at the Treasury Department of the Province of Buenos Aires. He died prematurely in 1888, after one year as Club president.

Currently, the President of Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata is chosen by its associates, by means of general elections that take place every three years. Any club member over 18 years of age, and with at least three years membership of the club, have a right to vote. Members with over seven years membership have a right to be elected to the Club governmental body, the Management Commission or &quot;Directory&quot;.

The most recent President of Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata is Gabriel Pellegrino, who refused to run for re-election in 2019. On 15 December 2019, however, Pellegrino, who was encouraged to seek re-election from club manager Diego Maradona, was re-elected to a three-year term.

==Facilities==
Gimnasia&#x27;s facilities include, besides its football stadium, a campus of 160 hectares, a campus for children&#x27;s football, a sports center, a kindergarten, a primary school and one high school. There are also dozens of subsidiaries located in the country and the world.

* Estadio Juan Carmelo Zerillo: also known as &quot;El Bosque&quot; (Spanish for &quot;the forest&quot;, because it is located in the La Plata park of the same name), has the capacity to accommodate approximately 24,544 spectators.
* &quot;Estancia Chica&quot;: It is a property of 160 hectares, where the professional football team trains before each match.
* El Bosquecito: It is a campus of 11 hectares where children&#x27;s categories practice and play.
* Other: The club has opened a kindergarten in 1999 (works on Calle 62 No. 474), a Primary School called &quot;Dr. René Favaloro&quot; opened in 2001 (on streets 123 and 58) and a High School opened in early 2008.
* Polideportivo Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata: Opened in 1978, Gimnasia y Esgrima has a sports complex, where it competes in the first division of basketball and volleyball with a capacity for 2,600 people, which rises to 3,500 spectators when performing musicals.
* Headquarters: In addition to the administration of the club and the attention of the members, it is possible to play sports like basketball and volleyball, among others. It also has a gym.

==Anthem==
The official anthem of Gimnasia was written in 1915 by the popular poet born in Magdalena, Délfor B. Méndez and the music was composed by the master Juan Serpentini, who composed versions of the National Argentine Anthem and &quot;El tambor de Tacuarí&quot;, with Rafael Obligado&#x27;s letter.

The official anthem of Gimnasia was intoned by the first time on 9 July 1915 on the occasion of the reception that was given to the delegation of the club River Plate of Uruguay. In 1967 the official anthem was recorded by the musical ensemble of the Buenos Aires Police.

==Emblems and colors==

===Badge===

The current shield of Gimnasia y Esgrima is a wreath in which, in the top part, a helmet is outlined with a heraldic crest. At the center, on enamel and with the colors of the club (white and navy blue), is the club monogram appears. In the top cantons, like a guard, there appears the hilts of a saber and a foil, with their sharp points emerging in lower part of the shield. To the sides of the center laurels spread around the helmet.

Since its inception, the club shield has undergone some modifications. The first symbol of the club appeared on a document dated 30 April 1888. This emblem consisted in the coat of arms of La Plata with the legend &quot;Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata – Mens Sana in Corpore Sano&quot; surrounding it. The second seal appeared between 1894 and 1897, with the legend &quot;Club de Esgrima&quot; (fencing was the only activity of the club by then).

But the first heraldic emblem was indeed devised in 1901 by artist Emilio Coutauret, who was also a member of GELP board. That emblem was characterized by a handcrafted and adorned design. Because this symbol could not be reproduced easily at small sizes, the club commissioned technical draftsman Raúl Felices to design a more synthetic emblem. As a result, a new symbol was released in 1928. It has remained until present days.

During Héctor Domínguez&#x27;s presidency, the abbreviation CGE (Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima) at the center of the shield was replaced by GELP (Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata). Since the beginning of Walter Gisande&#x27;s presidency, it was decided to return to the original abbreviation of &#x27;CGE&#x27;.

===Uniform===
The official historical uniform of Gimnasia y Esgrima is based on the colours displayed in the club shield, as established in the institutional statute, a white jersey with a single horizontal navy-blue stripe over the chest.

In the first years of the institution, the colors adopted were white and light blue, seeking to highlight the fact that it was an Argentine club. The first vest used by the team had vertical white and light blue stripes.

In 1905, it was decided to change the colors to make it distinct from Racing Club. This resulted in a vest with vertical stripes of white and navy-blue color.

Finally, in 1910, the design was modified, changing the vertical stripes into the horizontal band of navy-blue color over a white jersey, which has been used ever since.

The table below details the companies that provided the team&#x27;s apparel, and have been sponsoring the club since 1980 to date:




==Supporters==
===Fan base===

Within the city of La Plata and its environs, Gimnasia&#x27;s fan base used to be identified with the working class, in contrast with the mostly middle class Estudiantes&#x27; constituency. Most of Gimnasia y Esgrima fans are from the Greater La Plata area.
The club currently has 35,000 members. It is one of the 10 clubs with the most members in Argentina.

The barra brava section named itself &quot;La 22&quot;, after 22nd street in La Plata where many famous violent fans lived, notably Marcelo Amuchástegui. Known as &quot;Loco Fierro&quot;, Amuchástegui was famous for his exploits, such as hanging a 100-meter Gimnasia flag in the Bombonera stadium. He was shot to death by Rosarian police in a murky episode on 28 May 1991, allegedly during an armed robbery.

Several surveys carried out over the years in Argentina, place Gimnasia in the eighth place in the ranking with the most fans in Argentina.

As is the case with other clubs in the Argentine First Division, the fans celebrate the &quot;Worldwide Day of Gimnasia&#x27;s Fans&quot; on 10 December with a large party and outside gathering.

===Nicknames===
Since the 1960s, Gimnasia has been known as &quot;El Lobo&quot; (short for &quot;El Lobo del Bosque&quot;, Spanish for &quot;the wolf in the Forest&quot;) after the story of &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot;, since its historical football field is located in the middle of La Plata&#x27;s main park, known as &quot;El Bosque&quot; (&quot;the forest&quot;). Another nickname, &quot;mensanas&quot;, derives from the Latin motto used in the shield: &quot;Mens sana in corpore sano&quot; (a healthy mind in a healthy body).

An original nickname was (and still is) &quot;triperos&quot; (&quot;tripe&quot; or &quot;gut-handlers&quot;). This name has its origin in the fact that many of Gimnasia&#x27;s original supporters worked in the meat-processing plants of nearby Berisso. In newspaper caricatures from the early 1900s, Gimnasia was accordingly depicted as a &quot;butcher&quot;, instead of the current &quot;wolf&quot;. However, Gimnasia is still often greeted by its fans with a resounding &quot;Tripa corazón!&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Heart of tripe!&quot;). Curiously, the same nickname is applied when referring to the population of Porto in Portugal, although the meaning of the nickname in Portuguese is closer to &quot;tripe-eaters&quot;.

Another nickname is &quot;basureros&quot; (&quot;garbage or waste collectors&quot;), acquired during the presidency of Mr. Venturino in the 1970s, who also managed the private company dealing with trash pickup in La Plata.

==Stadium==
The &quot;Juan Carmelo Zerillo&quot; stadium, known as &quot;El Bosque&quot; (Spanish for &quot;the forest&quot;, because it is located in the La Plata park of the same name) had a capacity of 31,460 and was used continuously until 2005.

When a new city stadium was built for La Plata, both Gimnasia and Estudiantes initially chose to stay at their respective fields, but this arrangement collapsed when both fields were closed down due to new security regulations. In the 2006 &quot;Clausura&quot; tournament, Gimnasia began to use the city stadium for home games.
During the Copa Sudamericana 2006, in a match against Fluminense, Gimnasia obtained the Stadium capacity record exceeding 50,000 spectators. Registration that is still valid. Match that ended 2–0 for The Wolf.

Beginning in March 2008, Gimnasia made various reforms to its old stadium, seeking to secure the permit for its use at selected games. Finally in June 2008, the &quot;El Bosque&quot; grounds were reapproved for First Division competitions. On Saturday 21 June 2008, in the last game of the Clausure 2008 championship, Gimnasia returned to its old home in a match against Lanús. Now the &quot;Juan Carmelo Zerillo&quot; stadium has a capacity of 24,544.

==Other sports==
Basketball was practiced for the first time at the club in the 1920s. In 1924 the institution built a stadium on the corner of 60 and 118 streets. Since that time, it would become one of the major sports in the club.

The basketball team peaked during the 1978 and 1979 campaigns, when it won two Metropolitano championships. In both cases, team prevailed over favorite Obras Sanitarias, Argentina&#x27;s powerhouse at the time. The team included players such as &quot;Gallego&quot; González, &quot;Finito&quot; Gehrmann, Peinado, as well as some Americans: Michael Jackson, Lawrence Jackson Jr., and the team leader and star, point-guard Clarence Edgar Metcalfe, chosen as the league MVP in 1979. The twice-champions were coached by Rolando Sfeir.

Gimnasia was also runner-up in the 2003–04 Liga Nacional de Básquetbol&#x27;s Primera División tournament, when it was defeated by Boca Juniors by 4–2 in the final series.

In the following season, the team was relegated to the TNA (Second Division) after president Juan José Muñoz decreased substantially the basketball budget, thereby causing the loss of its principal players.

Some of Gimnasia&#x27;s notable basketball players were Carlos &quot;Gallego&quot; González, Ernesto &quot;Finito&quot; Gehrmann, Roberto López, Carlos Bejarano and Mariano Cerutti among others. Likewise, club&#x27;s notable coaches include José Ripullone, Miguel Ángel Ripullone and Gonzalo García.

Gimnasia y Esgrima also has a female volleyball team, who are the only one of the nine founder clubs from the &quot;Federación de Voleibol y Pelota al Cesto&quot;, still playing volleyball and in the highest division. The federation is current &quot;Federación Metropolitana de Voleibol&quot; (FMV).

===Former sports===
In addition to the aforementioned sport activities, Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata participated in other disciplines throughout its history. The following sports are no longer practiced in the club:

* Rugby union: In 1933, the &quot;Unión de Rugby del Río de la Plata&quot; (current Unión Argentina de Rugby) decided not to allow the affiliation of clubs that participated professionally in other sports (&quot;e.g.&quot;, association football). As a result, the &quot;mens sana&quot; team playing rugby was forced to rename itself distinctly as &quot;Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata Rugby Club&quot;. Four years later, however, it was decided to channel rugby activities through an independent institution, thereby creating &quot;La Plata Rugby Club&quot;, which currently competes in the Torneo de la URBA, first division of the Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires.
* Table tennis: The &quot;Asociación Platense de Tenis de Mesa&quot; (&quot;La Plata Association for Table-tennis&quot;, part of the Argentine Federation of the sport) existed between 1945 and 1951. Gimnasia was a founding member of the Association, and it obtained the majority of the tournaments organized during these six years.
* Greco-Roman wrestling: Between 1924 and 1928 the club had a team of Greco-Roman wrestling.
* Gymnastics: During the 1930s, the practice of gymnastics played a central role in the club&#x27;s activities. Members of the Gimnasia team were part of the Argentine delegation that competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. This discipline was discontinued after 1976.

Other activities were available at the club at various periods, namely: water polo, boxing, cycling, pétanque, auto racing and 
judo, among others.

<text>Unsuk Chin ( ; born July 14, 1961) is a South Korean composer of contemporary classical music, who is based in Berlin, Germany. Chin was a self-taught pianist from a young age and studied composition at Seoul National University as well as with György Ligeti at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg.

The recipient of numerous awards, she won the 2004 Grawemeyer Award for her Violin Concerto No. 1, the 2010 Music Composition Prize of the Prince Pierre Foundation for the ensemble piece &quot;Gougalōn&quot; and the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize in 2024. In 2019, writers of &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked her Cello Concerto (2009) the 11th greatest work of art music since 2000, with Andrew Clements describing it as &quot;perhaps the most original and entertainingly disconcerting of all of [her concertos], cast in four brilliant movements that never quite conform to type&quot;.

==Biography==
Unsuk Chin was born in Seoul, South Korea. She studied composition with Sukhi Kang at Seoul National University and won several international prizes in her early 20s. In 1985, Chin won the Gaudeamus Foundation located in Amsterdam, with her piece &quot;Spektra&quot; for three celli, which was composed for her graduation project. She also received an academic grant to study in Germany, where she moved that same year. There she studied with György Ligeti at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg from 1985 to 1988.

In 1988, Chin worked as a freelance composer at the electronic music studio of Technische Universität Berlin, realizing seven works. Her first electronic piece was &quot;Gradus ad Infinitum&quot;, which was composed in 1989. Her first large orchestral piece, &quot;Die Troerinnen&quot; (1986, rev.1990), for women&#x27;s voices, was premiered by the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra in 1990. In 1991, her breakthrough work &quot;Acrostic Wordplay&quot; was premiered by the Nieuw Ensemble. Since then, it has been performed in more than 20 countries in Europe, Asia and North America. Chin&#x27;s collaboration with the Ensemble Intercontemporain, which has led to several commissions from them, started in 1994 with &quot;Fantaisie mecanique&quot;. Since 1995, Chin has been published exclusively by Boosey &amp; Hawkes. In 1999, Chin began an artistic collaboration with Kent Nagano, who has since premiered six of her works.

Chin&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1 was awarded the 2004 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition. It was premiered in 2002 by Viviane Hagner. Since then, it has been programmed in 14 countries in Europe, Asia and North America, and performed, among others, by Christian Tetzlaff, the Berlin Philharmonic and Simon Rattle in 2005.

In 2007, she was awarded the Kyung-Ahm Prize.

Chin&#x27;s works have been performed by orchestras around the world, including the Berlin Philharmonic, the New York Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and many others. Her works have been conducted by Kent Nagano, Simon Rattle, Alan Gilbert, Gustavo Dudamel, Myung-whun Chung, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Neeme Järvi, Péter Eötvös, David Robertson and George Benjamin. Chin&#x27;s music has been highlighted at the 2014 Lucerne Festival, the Festival Musica in Strasbourg, the Suntory Summer Festival, the 2013 Stockholm Concert Hall&#x27;s Tonsätterfestival and at Settembre Musica in Italy. In 2001/2002, she was appointed composer-in-residence at Deutschen Symphonie-Orchester Berlin.

Chin was closely associated with the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra from 2006 to 2017, at invitation from Myung-whun Chung, as their composer-in-residence and director of their Ars Nova Series for contemporary music, which she founded herself and in which more than 200 Korean premieres of central works of classical modernism and contemporary music were being presented. Chin later became the orchestra&#x27;s artistic adviser. From 2011 to 2020, she oversaw the London-based Philharmonia Orchestra&#x27;s Music of Today series at the invitation of its then chief conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen.
Chin has been appointed Artistic Director of the Tongyeong International Music Festival from 2022 onwards.

==Style==
Chin does not regard her music as belonging to any specific culture. Chin names Béla Bartók, Igor Stravinsky, Claude Debussy, Anton Webern, Iannis Xenakis, and György Ligeti, among others, as 20th-century composers of special importance for her. Chin regards her working experience with electronic music and her preoccupation with Balinese Gamelan as influential for her work. In her orchestral work &quot;Miroirs des temps&quot;, Chin has also used compositional concepts of Medieval composers, such as Machaut and Ciconia, by employing and evolving techniques such as musical palindromes and crab canons.

The texts of Chin&#x27;s vocal music are often based on experimental poetry, and occasionally they are self-referential, employing techniques such as acrostics, anagrams and palindromes, all of which are also reflected in the compositional structure.

Consequently, Chin has set music to poems by writers such as Inger Christensen, Harry Mathews, Gerhard Rühm or Unica Zürn into music, and the title of &quot;Cantatrix Sopranica&quot; is derived from a nonsense treatise by Georges Perec. However, in &quot;Kalá&quot;, Chin has also composed works with less experimental texts by writers such as Gunnar Ekelöf, Paavo Haavikko, and Arthur Rimbaud. &quot;Troerinnen&quot; is based on a play by Euripides, and &quot;Le silence des Sirènes&quot; juxtaposes texts by Homer and James Joyce.

Playful aspects are dominant also in Chin&#x27;s opera &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, which is based on Lewis Carroll&#x27;s classic of the same name. The opera&#x27;s libretto was written by David Henry Hwang and the composer. The Munich production, which has been released on DVD by Unitel, was directed by Achim Freyer, and it was selected &#x27;Premiere of the Year&#x27; by an international critics&#x27; poll conducted in 2007 by the German opera magazine &quot;Opernwelt&quot;.

Some of Chin&#x27;s works are influenced by extramusical associations and other art genres, such as her orchestral work &quot;Rocaná&quot; which alludes to Olafur Elíasson&#x27;s installations, or her ensemble works &quot;Graffiti&quot; and &quot;cosmigimmicks&quot;, the latter of which was influenced by the art of pantomime and by Samuel Beckett.

<text>Project 2010 was a blueprint that United States Soccer Federation executives created in 1998 to ensure that the U.S. men&#x27;s national soccer team could become a plausible contender to win the FIFA World Cup by 2010. The Q-Report, the jumping-off point for Project 2010, was written by Carlos Queiroz.

The $50 million development plan was started just before the start of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. While referred to less often in recent years, Project 2010 did propagate two programs which continued for some time to help produce professional standard talent: Generation Adidas (previously called &quot;Project-40&quot; when sponsored by Nike) and U.S. Soccer&#x27;s U-17 residency camp in Bradenton, Florida. However, the residency camp closed in 2017 due to the proliferation of U.S. Development Academy programs.

<text>The International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants or UPOV () is a treaty body (non-United Nations intergovernmental organization) with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. Its objective is to provide an effective system for plant variety protection. It does so by defining a blueprint regulation to be implemented by its members in national law. The expression UPOV Convention also refers to one of the three instruments that relate to the union, namely the &quot;1991 Act of the UPOV Convention&quot; (UPOV 91), &quot;1978 Act of the UPOV Convention&quot; (UPOV 78) and &quot;1961 Act of the UPOV Convention with Amendments of 1972&quot; (UPOV 61).

== History ==
UPOV was established by the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV 61). The convention was adopted in Paris in 1961 and revised in 1972, 1978 and 1991.

The initiative for the foundation of UPOV came from European breeding companies, who 1956 called for a conference to define basic principles for plant variety protection. The first version of the UPOV convention was agreed on in 1961 by 12 European countries. By 1990 still only 19 countries were part of the convention, with South Africa being the only country from the Southern Hemisphere. From the mid-1990s more and more countries from Latin America, Asia and Africa joined the convention. A reason for this development might be the TRIPS-Agreement that obliged WTO members to introduce plant variety protection in national law. Later, many countries have been obliged to join UPOV through specific clauses in bilateral trade agreements, in particular with the EU, USA, Japan and EFTA. The TRIPS-Agreement doesn&#x27;t require adherence to UPOV but gives the possibility to define a &quot;sui generis&quot; system for plant variety protection. In contrast, clauses in free trade agreement are more comprehensive and typically require adherence to UPOV.

While the earlier versions of the convention have been replaced, UPOV 78 and UPOV 91 coexist. Existing members are free to decide whether they want to ratify UPOV 91 or stay with UPOV 78, whereas new members have to adhere to the more restrictive version from 1991.

== Membership ==
As of December 3, 2021 two intergovernmental organisations and 76 countries and were members of UPOV: African Intellectual Property Organisation, Albania, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, European Union, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Guatemala, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, North Macedonia, Norway, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States of America (with a reservation), Uruguay, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam.
For a country or intergovernmental organisation to become member, it needs to implement the requirements of the actual convention in national law. UPOV&#x27;s secretariat analyises the regulation of plant variety protection in national law and writes a recommendation to the council whether or not the applicant shall be granted membership. In the past several countries have been refused memberships because their national plant variety protection laws granted exceptions for subsistence farmers to reuse and exchange seeds.

In addition, a large number of countries (eg Pakistan), intergovernmental organisations (eg European Free Trade Association) and international non-governmental organisations (eg International Community of Breeders of Asexually Reproduced Ornamental and Fruit Varieties) have observer status.

== System of protection ==
The convention defines both how the organization must be governed and run, and the basic concepts of plant variety protection that must be included in the domestic laws of the members of the union. These concepts include:

* The criteria for new varieties to be protected: novelty, distinctness, uniformity, and stability.
* The process for application for a grant.
* Intellectual property rights conferred to an approved breeder.
* Exceptions to the rights conferred to the breeder.
* Required duration of breeder&#x27;s right.
* Events in which a breeder&#x27;s rights must be declared null and void.

In order to be granted breeder&#x27;s rights, the variety in question must be shown to be new. This means that the plant variety cannot have previously been available for more than one year in the applicant&#x27;s country, or for more than four years in any other country or territory. The variety must also be distinct (D), that is, easily distinguishable through certain characteristics from any other known variety (protected or otherwise). The other two criteria, uniformity (U) and stability (S), mean that individual plants of the new variety must show no more variation in the relevant characteristics than one would naturally expect to see, and that future generations of the variety through various propagation means must continue to show the relevant distinguishing characteristics. The UPOV offers general guidelines for DUS testing.

A breeder can apply for rights for a new variety in any union member country, and can file in as many countries as desired without waiting for a result from previous applications. Protection only applies in the country in which it was granted, so there are no reciprocal protections unless otherwise agreed by the countries in question. There is a right of priority, and the application date of the first application filed in any country is the date used in determining priority.

The rights conferred to the breeder are similar to other intellectual property rights, such as patents, even though there are important differences. Their purpose is to create a temporary monopoly on a plant variety, to allow its breeder to redeem the costs he invested to create this innovation - typically the creation of a new variety takes 10 to 15 years and implies a substantial investment. The breeder must authorize any actions taken in propagating the new variety, including selling and marketing, importing and exporting, keeping stock of, and reproducing. This means that the breeder can, for example, require a licensing fee for any company interested in reproducing his variety for sale. The breeder also has the right to name the new variety, based on certain guidelines that prevent the name from being deliberately misleading or too similar to another variety&#x27;s name.

In the 1991 convention there are four exceptions to the rights of the breeder owning a plant variety:

* Breeders exception: Even if a variety is protected it can be freely used by an other breeder as a source for new varieties, without the authorization of the owner of the original variety. With the introduction of the 1991 convention this exception has been narrowed down to exclude &quot;essentially derived varieties&quot;.
* Farmers exception: In the 1978 Convention the reproduction of seeds, as well as their exchange with other farmers is implicitly allowed, because the exclusive right of the breeder only extend to the production for the purpose of marketing. With the 1991 Convention the scope of breeders rights were expanded to include the multiplication of a variety. However, there still is an optional exception that can be included in national legislation to allow reproduction of seeds of certain crops by farmers, but only &quot;within reasonable limits and subject to the safeguarding of the legitimate interests of the breeder&quot; which practically means that the farmers is obliged to pay license fees to the breeder. The only members of UPOV 91 allowing the free reproduction of seeds for some species by farmers are Switzerland and United States of America. UPOV secretariat never assessed if this implementation is in line with the convention as these countries already member of UPOV 1978 and national laws are only analysed for new members and not for existing members who update from UPOV 78 to UPOV 91.
* Exception for private non-commercial use: While free private use is implicitly allowed in UPOV 78, in UPOV 91 a mandatory explicit exception has been introduced. It allows the reproduction of protected varieties for private use, by amateur gardeners as well as by subsistence farmers. However, the exception only applies exclusively for the production of a food crop to be consumed by that farmer or gardener. In any case the exchange or gift of seeds or propagating material of protected varieties are prohibited.
* Exception for research: Acts done for experimental purpose are excluded from the scope of breeders rights UPOV 91, something that was implicit in UPOV 78.

The 1991 Convention specifies that the breeder&#x27;s right must be granted for at least 20 years from grant date for perennial crops and at least 25 years in the case of varieties of trees or vines. In the 1978 convention minimum duration of breeders rights are 15 years for perennials and 18 years for trees and vines.

Finally, there are provisions for how to negate granted breeders&#x27; rights if the rights are determined to be unfounded. That is, if it is discovered after the application has been granted that the variety is not actually novel or distinct, or if it is discovered to not be uniform or stable, the breeder&#x27;s rights are nullified. In addition, if it is discovered that the person who applied for protection of the variety is not the actual breeder, the rights are nullified unless they can be transferred to the proper person. If it is discovered after a period of protection that the variety is no longer uniform and stable, the breeder&#x27;s rights are canceled.

== Conflicts between breeders&#x27; rights and peasants&#x27; rights ==
Several international standards enacted by the United Nations oblige their member states to protect the rights of farmers to seeds: Article 19 of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas (UNDROP) grants peasants &quot;The right to save, use, exchange and sell their farm-saved seed or propagating material.&quot; The same right is also codified in Article 9 of the International Treaty for Plant Genetic Resources for Agriculture (ITPGRFA). Furthermore, peasants rights to seeds are also mentioned in the Convention for Biological Diversity and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. UPOV standards violate this rights in the case of protected varieties, as farmers only are allowed to save seeds within very narrow limits and are not allowed to exchange or sell any seeds at all, according to UPOV 91. Furthermore, as implementation of UPOV is based on predefined standards, there is little room for member states to fulfill their obligation to take into account possible effects on the human right situation in their countries and to allow for participation of farmers. In many developing countries, small scale farmers have not been informed prior to adopting and implementation of new plant variety protection laws and had no possibility participate in these decisions.

As UNDROP and UNDRIP are part of Human Rights standards, they are higher order norms and therefore they prevail over property rights on seeds, according to human rights experts. As a consequence, states are obliged to revise regulations in national law that violate peasant&#x27;s rights and adapt trade agreement or other intergovernmental obligations such as UPOV.

In a report on seeds and farmers&#x27; rights to the Human Rights Council, Special Rapporteur for the right to food Michael Fakhri states that UPOV 91 violates farmers&#x27; rights. The report denounces pressures applied by industrialised countries on countries of the global South to join UPOV. It calls on UN member states to design and interpret seed policies and plant variety protection laws in a way that protects farmers rights and promotes farmers&#x27; seed systems rather than restricting them. Ethiopia, India, Malaysia and Thailand (all non-UPOV members) are mentioned as positive examples.

In 2021 the Supreme Court of Justice of Honduras deemed unconstitutional the Legislative Decree No. 21-2012 containing the Law for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants. The supreme court sacked the UPOV 91-based law because it judged it to be in contradiction with a range of human rights as well as with the obligation of the State of Honduras to protect the environment.

== Impacts of UPOV ==

=== Impacts on development of seed sector and accessibility of seeds ===
A study published by UPOV in 2005 evaluated the impact of UPOV compliant regulations in Argentina, China, Kenya, Poland and South Korea. The study found that in these countries the number of protected varieties of some crops has increased after these countries have joined UPOV. The report takes this as an indicator that farmers and the agricultural sector as whole has profited. However, the by far does not live up to the scientific standards for impact assessments and has been criticized being heavily biased.

A report from 2005 commissioned by the World Bank looked at the impact of intellectual property rights regimes on the plant breeding industry in 5 developing countries. It concludes that intellectual property regimes have relatively little effect on the emergence of the private seed sector. India, the country with the most dynamic seed sector analysed in the report, is not a member of UPOV and has no strict plant variety protection regime. Contrarily, the report states that farmer&#x27;s seed systems are the main source of seeds and new varieties in the countries studied and that strict intellectual property rights on seeds may reduce the effectiveness of these systems. An analysis of the data from the Access to Seed Index from 2019, came to a similar finding: Many of the developing having the most vibrant private seed sector are not member of UPOV but have their own system of plant variety protection or no plant variety protection at all.

A study published by NGOs looked at the effects of the implementation of UPOV 1991 in francophone Africa in the 11 years after the accession of OAPI to UPOV. It found that in the 17 member countries only 117 plant varieties have been newly protected during this period, half of them had already lapsed because of nonpayment of fees. At least half of them were varieties that had been available before. The study finds no increase in plant breeding activities in the region; while breeding by the public sector continued independent of plant variety protection, breeding by private companies remained largely non-existent.

In the case of Iceland, no new variety has been protected since its accession to UPOV 91 in 2006, while 49 varieties had been newly protected in the 10 years before.

An increased number of protected varieties does not automatically increase the accessibility of seeds to farmers. In many developing countries the majority of seeds used by small scale farmers come from the farmers’ managed seed sector. Frequently, also seeds of protected varieties are saved, exchanged and sold. As these practices are prohibited in UPOV 91, farmers lose access to an inexpensive source of seeds while commercial seeds remain unaffordable for many.

=== Impacts on agricultural development and productivity ===
A study commissioned by UPOV examined the socioeconomic benefits of plant variety protection, 10 years after the accession of Viet Nam to UPOV 91. The study found that the productivity of 3 major staple crops increased during this period: Yield gains were 18% for rice, 30% for corn and 43% for sweet potato. The study argues that improved varieties which had been introduced due to stricter plant variety protection contributed to this development, and that 74 million people could be fed with the additional sweet potatoes. However, in the case of sweet potato that had the highest gain, no new variety had been protected and also for the other crops, productivity gains can be explained with other factors. A Study published by an Asian NGO finds that implementation of UPOV 91 in Vietnam did not lead to an increase of investment in breeding or in gains of productivity. Instead, it strengthened international commercial breeders at the cost of weakening the public breeders and threatening the farmers&#x27; seed sector.

=== Impacts on food security and poverty reduction ===
Smallholder farmers in the global South are amongst the groups most prone to poverty and hunger. They predominantly rely on seeds that are produced by farmers themselves, often also including varieties originally bred by public and private breeders. These farmers’ seed systems are often highly resilient and more accessible to famers than seeds offered by breeding companies. Through the implementation of strict plant variety protection in line with UPOV 91, and the restrictions on the use, exchange and sale of farm-saved seeds, farmers become more dependent on the seeds offered directely by breeding companies which often are unaffordable for the most vulnerable groups. As a consequence, adherence to UPOV would most likely have negative effects for poverty reduction and food security in developing countries.

The risk for food security that come with the implementation of strict regulations for plant variety protection might be an important reason why many countries of the global South hesitate to join UPOV or to update from UPOV 78 to UPOV 91 as the latter puts narrow limits to the farmer&#x27;s privilege to reuse farm saved seeds.

In a report from 2009 the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Olivier De Schutter, analysed the impact of UPOV on the right to food. He found that IP-related monopoly rights could cause poor farmers to become &quot;increasingly dependent on expensive inputs&quot; and at risk of indebtedness. Further, the system risks neglecting poor farmers’ needs in favour of agribusiness needs, jeopardising traditional systems of seed saving and exchange, and losing biodiversity to &quot;the uniformization encouraged by the spread of commercial varieties&quot;.These findings were by his successor Michael Fakhri in a report from 2022 and by the UN Secretary-General in a report from 2015.

=== Impacts on biodiversity and genetic resources ===
Diverse genetic resources are the basis of all plant breeding and crop production. Breeders rely on farmers’ varieties and wild relatives as a source for interesting traits, such as resistance against pathogens and pests. The number of varieties has decreased by 75% in the past century and there is far less area planted to landraces worldwide as these have been replaced by scientifically bread varieties. Furthermore, crop genetic diversity may decline with concentration of area planted in a few favoured varieties and reductions in “genetic distance” between these varieties. The increasing dominance of few global seed producers and the implementation of increasingly strict plant variety regulation might have played a key role in this development. As the UN&#x27;s Secretary General stated in a report from 2015, restrictions on seed management systems linked to UPOV 91 can lead to a loss of biodiversity and in turn harm the livelihoods of small-scale farmers as well as weaken the genetic base on which we all depend for our future supply of food.

The design of plant variety protection facilitates appropriation of genetic resources and biopiracy. Due to the criteria defined by UPOV, most landraces and farmer varieties cannot be protected and are therefore open for appropriation. UPOV 91-based PVP law also does not include a requirement for applicants to disclose the origin of their material and prove that the plant genetic resources used in the breeding process were legally acquired. In its guidelines, UPOV even explicitly forbids its members to request a declaration of lawful acquirement or prior informed consent (as required by the Convention on Biological Diversity) as precondition for granting PVP.

The documentation of a case in West Africa shows that the risk of biopiracy is real: A French seed company tempted to claim plant variety protection for the traditional onion variety “&quot;Violette de Galmi&quot;”. The claim was challenged by the Nigerien government, the seed company withdrew the application and submitted a new application for the same variety but under another name. The fact that challenging the application was only possible because the seed company used the original name of the traditional variety shows how easily varieties can be appropriated.

== Critics and resistance ==

Several social movements and civil society organisations such as South Center, GRAIN, AFSA, SEARICE, Third World Network, and La Via Campesina have criticised UPOV Secretariatpointed. Some of them have pointed out the resistance of the UPOV Secretariat and Member States to dialogue with all interested parties, in particular:
* by keeping meetings secret,
* by not making its documents publicly available,
* by refusing farmers&#x27; organisations NGO observer status with UPOV.

A study by Professor Graham Dutfield concluded that UPOV&#x27;s governance falls short in many different ways, UPOV officials know very little about actual farming, and how small-scale farmers actually develop new varieties and produce them, and that they knew much more about breeding, which favours commercial breeders. The UPOV system thus favours commercial breeders over farmers and producers, and private interests over public interests.

The intergovernmental organisation South Center criticizes that, while conventions of UPOV 78 and UPOV 91 have been negotiated almost exclusively by industrialised countries, they are imposed to all countries including in the southern hemisphere. GRAIN even blames UPOV of neo-colonialistic behaviour.

At the occasion of UPOV&#x27;s 60st anniversary on 2 December 2021, a coalition led by GRAIN organised the “Week of Action: Stop UPOV”, with a call for action with over 230 signatories across 47 countries. In front of UPOV&#x27;s headquarter group of activists from the Swiss Coalition for the Right to Seeds conducted a protest action, symbolically freeing plants from the chains of UPOV.

The week of action was repeated in 2022 with further protests in a range of countries.

== UPOV and free trade agreements ==
Many developing countries did not decide to join the UPOV agreement voluntarily, but were obliged to do so by free trade agreements. Examples of this are Peru, Morocco and Costa Rica, whose accession to UPOV was one of the conditions imposed by the European Free Trade Association for the free trade agreements subsequently concluded. There is increasing resistance to UPOV requirements in free trade agreements. In Switzerland, the responsible persons have received over 1,300 letters of complaint from various countries in the year 2020.

In his 2021 report on seeds and farmers‘ rights to the Human Rights Council, the current UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food emphasises that UPOV 91 violates farmers’ rights and criticises the pressure exerted by industrialised countries on countries of the Global South to join UPOV through free trade agreements. The report calls on UN member states to design and interpret seed policies and plant variety protection laws in a way that protects farmers&#x27; rights and promotes their seed systems rather than restricting them. Ethiopia, India, Malaysia and Thailand (all non-UPOV members) are cited as positive examples, as they &quot;have adopted innovative national plant variety protection laws distinct from the 1991 International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants.&quot;

Currently, however, the EFTA states, including Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland are negotiating free trade agreements with Thailand and Malaysia. In this context, both countries are demanding compliance with UPOV 91 as a prerequisite for these agreements. In a letter to the four countries in 2024, the UN Special Rapporteur pointed out that this approach jeopardises the right to food. Despite these concerns, the joint response of the EFTA states indicates that they will likely maintain their current practice.

<text>Lincoln City is an unincorporated community in Carter Township, Spencer County in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Indiana. It lies five minutes south of Interstate 64, northeast of Evansville, and approximately twenty miles north of the Ohio River.

==History==

Lincoln City was laid out in 1872 when the railroad was extended to that point. The community was named for the Lincoln family. Nearby is the Nancy Hanks Lincoln Memorial, as well as the site of the Lincoln log cabin, built in 1816. President Abraham Lincoln spent much of his childhood (from the ages of 7 to 21) on this farm, and as a young man he practiced law at the nearby Spencer County courthouse. Also located in Lincoln City is the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial, a national park managed by the National Park Service that includes a Living Historical Farm that attempts to recreate the early nineteenth-century period during which the Lincoln family lived in the area. The living-history farm is a working pioneer-style homestead with a cabin, outbuildings, split rail fences, animals, gardens, and field crops. NPS interpreters in period clothing perform a variety of activities typical of the 1820s, and the farm&#x27;s grounds are open year-round. The farm is staffed from mid-April through September full-time, and intermittently in October. The Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial is located on Highway 162 across from Lincoln State Park.

The Lincoln City post office has been in operation since 1892.

==Education==
Heritage Hills High School is located in Lincoln City. It is one of two high schools in Spencer County.

==Notable people==
* Jay Cutler - Chicago Bears quarterback; graduate of Heritage Hills High School
* Sarah Lincoln Grigsby - sister of Abraham Lincoln
* John Hanks - cousin of Abraham Lincoln
* Abraham Lincoln - 16th president of the United States of America
* Nancy Lincoln - mother of Abraham Lincoln
* Sarah Bush Lincoln - step-mother of Abraham Lincoln
* Thomas Lincoln - father of Abraham Lincoln
* Richard Fred Suhrheinrich - Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit

<doc id="1104639" wikidata="Q695112" url="?curid=1104639" title="Plant breeders' rights">
<text>Plant breeders&#x27; rights (PBR), also known as plant variety rights (PVR), are rights granted in certain places to the breeder of a new variety of plant that give the breeder exclusive control over the propagating material (including seed, cuttings, divisions, tissue culture) and harvested material (cut flowers, fruit, foliage) of a new variety for a number of years. The system of Plant breeders&#x27; rights is considered a sui generis form of intellectual property rights.

With these rights, the breeder can choose to become the exclusive marketer of the variety, or to license the variety to others. In order to qualify for these exclusive rights, a variety must be new, distinct, uniform, and stable. A variety is:
*&quot;new&quot; if it has not been commercialized for more than one year in the country of protection;
*&quot;distinct&quot; if it differs from all other known varieties by one or more important botanical characteristics, such as height, maturity, color, etc.;
*&quot;uniform&quot; if the plant characteristics are consistent from plant to plant within the variety;
*&quot;stable&quot; if the plant characteristics are genetically fixed and therefore remain the same from generation to generation, or after a cycle of reproduction in the case of hybrid varieties.

The breeder must also give the variety an acceptable &quot;denomination&quot;, which becomes its generic name and must be used by anyone who markets the variety.

Typically, plant variety rights are granted by national offices after examination. Seed is submitted to the plant variety office, who grow it for one or more seasons, to check that it is distinct, stable, and uniform. If these tests are passed, exclusive rights are granted for a specified period (typically 20/25 years, or 25/30 years for trees and vines). Renewal fees (often, annual) are required to maintain the rights.

Breeders can bring suit to enforce their rights and can recover damages. Plant breeders&#x27; rights contain exemptions that are not recognized under other legal doctrines such as patent law. Commonly, there is an exemption for farm-saved seed. Farmers may store this production in their own bins for their own use as seed, but this does not necessarily extend to &quot;brown-bag sales&quot; (i.e. resale of farm-saved seed to neighbors in the local area). Further sales for propagation purposes are not allowed without the written approval of the breeder. There is also a breeders&#x27; exemption (research exemption in the 1991 Act) that allows breeders to use protected varieties as sources of initial variation to create new varieties of plants (1978 Act), or for other experimental purposes (1991 Act). There is also a provision for compulsory licensing to assure public access to protected varieties if the national interest requires it and the breeder is unable to meet the demand.

There is tension over the relationship between patent rights and plant breeder&#x27;s rights. There has been litigation in Australia, the United States, and Canada over the overlap between such rights. Each of these cases was decided on the principle that patents and plant breeders&#x27; rights were overlapping and not mutually exclusive. Thus, the exemptions from infringement of plant breeders&#x27; rights, such as the saved seed exemption, do not create corresponding exemptions from infringement of the patents covering the same plants. Likewise, acts that infringe the plant breeders&#x27; rights, such as exportation of the variety, would not necessarily infringe a patent on the variety, which only allows the patent owner to prohibit making, using, or selling (first sale, but not resale) the patented invention.

==International rights==
In 1957, in France negotiations took place concerned with the protection of new varieties. This led to the creation of the Union Internationale pour la Protection des Obtentions Végétales (UPOV) and adoption of the first text of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV Convention) in 1961. The purpose of the Convention was to ensure that the member states party to the Convention acknowledge the achievements of breeders of new plant varieties by making available to them an exclusive property right, on the basis of a set of uniform and clearly defined principles.

The Convention was revised in Geneva in 1972, 1978 and 1991. Both the 1978 and the 1991 Acts set out a minimum scope of protection and offer member States the possibility of taking national circumstances into account in their legislation. Under the 1978 Act, the minimum scope of the plant breeder&#x27;s right requires that the holder&#x27;s prior authorization is necessary for the production for purposes of commercial marketing, the offering for sale and the marketing of propagating material of the protected variety. The 1991 Act contains more detailed provisions defining the acts concerning propagating material in relation to which the holder&#x27;s authorization is required. The breeder&#x27;s authorization is also required in relation to any of the specified acts done with harvested material of the variety, unless the breeder has had reasonable opportunity to exercise their right in relation to the propagating material, or if not doing so could constitute an &quot;Omega Threat&quot; situation. Under that provision, for example, a flower breeder who protects their variety in the Netherlands could block importation of cut flowers of that variety into the Netherlands from Egypt, which does not grant plant breeders&#x27; rights, because the breeder had no opportunity to exercise any rights in Egypt. Member countries also have the option to require the breeder&#x27;s authorization with respect to the specified acts as applied to products directly obtained from the harvested material (such as flour or oil from grain, or juice from fruit), unless the breeder has had reasonable opportunity to exercise their right in relation to the harvested material.

The UPOV Convention also establishes a multilateral system of &quot;national treatment&quot;, under which citizens of any member state are treated as citizens of all member states for the purpose of obtaining plant breeders rights. It also sets up a multilateral priority filing system, under which an application for protection filed in one member state establishes a filing date for applications filed in all other member states within one year of that original filing date. This allows a breeder to file in any one member country within the one-year period required to preserve the novelty of their variety, and the novelty of the variety will still be recognized when the filing is done in other member countries within one year of the original filing date. However, if the applicant does not wish to make use of priority filing, he or she has four years in which to apply in all other member states, excepting the United States, for all species except tree and vine species in which case he or she has six years to make application. More information can be obtained in Article 10 (1) (b) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2100/94 of 27 July 2004. The trigger to start the four- or six-year period is not actually the date on which the first filing is made but the date on which the variety was first commercialized.

The UPOV Convention is not self-executing. Each member state must adopt legislation consistent with the requirements of the convention and submit that legislation to the UPOV Secretariat for review and approval by the UPOV Council, which consists of all the UPOV member states acting in committee. In compliance with these treaty obligations, the United Kingdom enacted the Plant Variety and Seeds Act 1964. Similar legislation was passed in the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, and New Zealand. In 1970 the United States followed the lead of seventeen Western European nations and passed the Plant Variety Protection Act 1970 (US). This legislation provided protection to developers of novel, sexually reproduced plants. However, the United States originally acceded to the UPOV Convention on the basis of the Plant Patent Act and did not bring the PVP Act into compliance with UPOV requirements until 1984 when the Commissioner of Plant Variety Protection promulgated rules to do so. Since the 1980s, the US Patent Office has granted patents on plants, including plant varieties this provides a second way of protecting plant varieties in the United States. Australia passed the Plant Variety Protection Act 1987 (Cth) and the Plant Breeders Rights Act 1994 (Cth). Australian patent law also permits the patenting of plant varieties. In total, 65 countries have signed the UPOV Convention and adopted plant breeders&#x27; rights legislation consistent with the requirements of the convention.

The WTO&#x27;s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) requires member states to provide protection for plant varieties either by patents or by an effective &quot;sui generis&quot; (stand alone) system, or a combination of the two. Most countries meet this requirement through UPOV Convention-compliant legislation. India has adopted a plant breeders&#x27; rights law that has been rejected by the UPOV Council as not meeting the requirements of the treaty.

The most recent 1991 UPOV convention established several restrictions upon international plant breeders&#x27; rights. While the current legislature of the convention recognizes novel varieties of plants as intellectual property, laws were formed concerning the preservation of seeds for future plantation, such that the need to buy seeds to use in subsequent planting seasons would be significantly reduced, and even potentially eliminated altogether. In addition, the 1991 convention also concerns the method of instigating plant breeding by implementing pre-existing and patented plant species as contributor of vital genetic information in the creation of what would legally be regarded as a new variety of plant.

Constituent countries of the World Trade Organization are required to acknowledge the creation of new varieties of plants, and to uphold these creations within full recognition of intellectual property rights laws. A formalized legislature, exemplifying the manner in which such intellectual property rights can be conferred, is demonstrated by the 1991 UPOV convention, which declares such rights upon an individual breeder. This document further identifies a breeder as one who has found or created a plant variety, one who possesses legal authority for the contractual production of a new plant variety, or one who has inherited legal rights to this form of intellectual property as it was derived under either of the two aforementioned conditions.

As a result of debate over the protection of hybrid plants as new varieties, the legal measure of double protection, as expressed within the current iteration of the UPOV, can be taken. Double protection mediates the overlap between plant breeders&#x27; rights and patents that exists within the purview of intellectual property rights law, by enabling the protections of both to be conferred upon a particular plant variety.

Plant breeders&#x27; rights (sometimes referred to as &quot;breeders&#x27; privilege&quot;) are contentious, in particular when analyzed in balance with other relevant international legal instruments, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (and its Nagoya Protocol) or the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (Plant Treaty). The UPOV is often criticized on this basis.

== Plants as intellectual property ==
There have been contrary opinions expressed by both lawyers and scientists assessing the general necessity for the protection of bred plant varieties as a form of intellectual property. Currently, intellectual property rights protect ideas that can be demonstrated as being novel and undiscovered at the time of its legal claim as intellectual property. This definition of novelty, however, has been flexible throughout the history of intellectual property law, both internationally, and within the United States. Expectations of future changes to the legal protection of plant-related forms of intellectual property differ from the legal requirements for the first plant patent. Proponents of these laws recognize an overarching need for the financial support of research and development. Agricultural research and development, for example, has been specified as a particularly demanding endeavor, with respect to immediate concerns for the ability to sustainably feed an increasing global population. On the contrary, some believe that a more diverse approach than the imposition of intellectual property rights laws upon new plant varieties is required. This counter argument asserts that complex social, cultural, and economic factors affect the nature of intellectual property and its protection. A specific concern within this argument is with the means by which seeds are accessed within different local and international regions. Recognizing that this process is extremely transient in nature and can vary greatly over time, supporters of this argument purport that this diversity must be reflected within intellectual property rights laws in order for them to exist as an effective protection of plant breeders&#x27; rights.

As a result of this conflict concerning authority over seeds, new legislation has been implemented in the United States. The Open Source Seed Initiative (OSSI) is a national attempt that has been introduced within the United States, and is the first of its kind to model its approach regarding plant breeders&#x27; rights upon the mechanisms implemented by openly sourced software mechanisms. Subsequent discourse on this approach has arisen, as concerns with the use of open source technology within a legal framework have developed. Some perceive OSSI as having significantly limited plant breeders&#x27; ability to access intellectual property rights for new plant varieties. This has resulted in claims that funding for research and development in this sector will also decline.

== Seed sovereignty ==

Seed sovereignty can be defined as the right &quot;to breed and exchange diverse open-sourced seeds&quot;. Generally, it comes from the belief that communities should have control over their own seed stock, as a means to increase agricultural biodiversity, resilience, and food security. This idea is closely connected to issues of intellectual property rights, particularly related to the patenting of plant genetics, due to the importance of seed saving in seed sovereignty. Activists argue that farmers and individuals should have legal protection for the practice for maintaining traditional plant varieties. Seed sovereignty activists also argue that seed saving should be protected on the grounds of environmentalism and food security. Some activists argue that seed sovereignty is important because of the cultural value of certain seeds and plant varieties, especially among indigenous communities. Seed sovereignty has strong ties to the food justice and food sovereignty movements, due to its focus on increasing food security for all communities.

<text>The VA-111 &quot;Shkval&quot; (from , &quot;squall&quot;) torpedo and its descendants are supercavitating torpedoes originally developed by the Soviet Union. They are capable of speeds in excess of 200 knots (370 km/h or 230 miles/h).

== Design and capabilities ==
Design began in the 1960s when the NII-24 research institute was ordered to produce a new weapon capable of engaging nuclear submarines. The merger of the institute and GSKB-47 created the Research Institute of Applied Hydromechanics, who continued with the design and production of the Shkval.

Previously operational as early as 1977, the torpedo was announced as being deployed in the 1990s. The &quot;Shkval&quot; is intended as a countermeasure against torpedoes launched by undetected enemy submarines.


The VA-111 is launched from torpedo tubes at . A solid-fuel rocket accelerates it to cavitation speed, with a combined-cycle gas turbine in the nose creating the required gas bubble. Once accelerated, speed is maintained by an underwater ramjet fueled by hydroreactive metals using seawater as both reactant and the source of oxidizer; the torpedo travels at around .

Some reports indicate that the VA-111 possibly exceeds speeds of , and that work on a version was underway.

The high speed is made possible by supercavitation, whereby a gas bubble surrounding the torpedo is created by outward deflection of water by its specially-shaped nose cone and the expansion of gases from its engine and the gas generator in the nose. This minimizes water contact with the torpedo, significantly reducing drag.

Early designs may have relied solely on an inertial guidance system. The initial design was intended for nuclear warhead delivery. Later designs reportedly include terminal guidance and conventional warheads.

The torpedo steers using four fins that skim the inner surface of the supercavitation gas bubble. To change direction, the fin(s) on the inside of the desired turn are extended, and the opposing fins are retracted.

In 2016, KTRV was upgrading Shkval.

The torpedo is manufactured in Kyrgyzstan by the &quot;Dastan&quot; state-owned factory. In 2012 the Russian government asked for a 75% ownership of the factory in exchange for writing off $180 million Kyrgyz debt to Russia.

== Espionage ==
In 2000, former U.S. Naval intelligence officer and an alleged Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) spy Edmond Pope (Captain, USN, retired) was held, tried, and convicted in Russia of espionage related to information he obtained about the Shkval weapon system. Russian President Vladimir Putin pardoned Pope in December 2000 on humanitarian grounds because he had bone cancer.

== Operators ==
**Islamic Republic of Iran Navy 
* (possibly)
**Russian Navy (possibly)
* (possibly)
**Vietnam People&#x27;s Navy (possibly equipped with Kilo-class submarines, it is suspected that Vietnam owns this type of torpedo in its inventory due to a picture showing a part of VA-111 and Vietnamese labels)

== Variants ==
There are at least three variants:
* VA-111 &quot;Shkval&quot; – Original variant; GOLIS autonomous inertial guidance.
* &quot;Shkval 2&quot; – Current variant; believed to have additional guidance systems, possibly via the use of vectored thrust, and with a much longer range.
* A less capable version currently being exported to foreign naval forces. The export version is referred to as &quot;Shkval-E&quot;.
* Iran claimed it has created a version named &quot;Hoot&quot;.

All current versions are believed to be fitted only with conventional explosive warheads, although the original design used a nuclear warhead.

== Specifications ==
* Length: 
* Diameter: 
* Weight: 
* Warhead weight: 
* Speed
** Launch speed: 
** Maximum speed: or greater
* Range: Around (new version). Older versions only

<doc id="1104650" wikidata="Q4704620" url="?curid=1104650" title="Al Qa'qaa">
<text>The Al Qa&#x27;qaa&#x27; State Establishment ( &quot;al-Qa’qā’&quot;; also Romanized &quot;al Qa Qaa&quot;, &quot;al Qa&#x27;qa&quot;) was a massive weapons facility south of Baghdad. It is near to the towns of Yusifiyah and Iskandariya at the geographic coordinates . Covering an area of over , the site comprises 116 separate factories and over 1,100 structures of various kinds. It is now disused and many of the buildings have been destroyed by bombing, looting and accidental explosions. In October 2004, the facility became the centre of international attention after a UN agency reported hundreds of tonnes of stored explosives &quot;missing&quot; (see Al Qa&#x27;qaa high explosives controversy).

==Origins of Al Qa&#x27;qaa==

Al Qa&#x27;qaa was built in the 1970s with most of the equipment coming from Germany and Yugoslavia. It was completed in 1981, just in time to meet the demands of the Iran–Iraq War. Under the regime of Saddam Hussein the facility was a key agency of the Iraqi Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialization. It included plants for producing solid-propellant rockets and ammunition. The complex also included factories producing steel, aluminium, and centrifuges. It was Iraq&#x27;s principal production facility for specialist explosives, notably RDX and HDX.

The facility was named after a distinguished soldier in the army of the 7th century Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab, of whom it was said &quot;the voice of Al Qa&#x27;qaa in an army is better than one thousand fighters.&quot; By analogy, as Saddam Hussein explained in a visit on May 23, 2001, the workers at Al Qa&#x27;qaa were equivalent to a far greater number of their enemies:

:&quot;Every Iraqi works in the same way Caliph Umar Ibn-al-Khattab used to work with when the commander, who led the Muslims&#x27; army on Iraq&#x27;s front, to back him with several thousands of fighters. So, he sent him four fighters only, including Al-Qa&#x27;qaa. He considered each one of these fighters equal to 1,000 fighters. Had the Iraqis not worked in this way and with spirit now, they would not have achieved, with this small number, what was not achieved by others who outnumber them.&quot;

==Al Qa&#x27;qaa and Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction==

The Al Qa&#x27;qaa plant was heavily involved in Iraq&#x27;s clandestine program to produce weapons of mass destruction, with its workers&#x27; expertise in explosives being used to develop explosive lenses for nuclear weapons. Iraq&#x27;s program suffered serious setbacks due to the Israeli destruction of the experimental reactor at Osirak in June 1981 and a massive accidental explosion at Al Qa&#x27;Qaa in August 1989, which severely damaged the plant and was heard hundreds of miles away. British-Iraqi journalist Farzad Bazoft attempted to investigate the incident by disguising himself as a medical technician in order to infiltrate Al Qa&#x27;qaa. However, he was caught and executed on charges related to his visit.

In March 1990, customs officials at Heathrow Airport in London seized a case of military electrical capacitors - key components of triggers for explosive lenses - which was bound for Al Qa&#x27;qaa. The United States subsequently charged five people and two British companies with violations of export regulations.

During the 1991 Gulf War the facility was severely damaged by bombing. After the war, the UN weapons inspectors UNSCOM further destroyed and sealed weapons and facilities at the base. However, part of the base was rebuilt and attracted concern from Western countries. In September 2002, the plant was named by the British Government in &quot;Iraq&#x27;s Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot; (the &quot;September Dossier&quot;) as being the site of a rebuilt phosgene production facility. Although phosgene has industrial uses in small quantities, there are no legitimate nonmilitary uses for such large scale production, and it is capable of being used as a chemical weapon, as was done by Germany in World War I. The British and Americans also alleged that a large consignment of 81 mm aluminium tubes delivered to the plant were to be used as rotors in centrifuges to produce enriched uranium.

IAEA officials inspected the site at least ten times in 2002 and 2003 but discovered no weapons of mass destruction. The aluminium tubes did exist, but they were determined to be for short-range artillery rockets (which Iraq was allowed to possess). The inspectors left the country in mid-March 2003 shortly before the US-led invasion of Iraq. They sealed the bunkers where explosives were stored, but were not permitted to return after the United States took control.

The Al Qa&#x27;qaa high explosives controversy is over the question of when the IAEA-sealed explosives were removed from their bunkers; whether it happened before, during or after the invasion of Iraq.

<doc id="1104651" wikidata="Q726302" url="?curid=1104651" title="Tokyo Sexwale">
<text>Mosima Gabriel &quot;Tokyo&quot; Sexwale (; born March 5, 1953) is a South African businessman, politician, anti-apartheid activist, and former political prisoner. For many years, Sexwale was imprisoned on Robben Island for his anti-apartheid activities, alongside figures such as Nelson Mandela. After the 1994 general election—the first fully democratic election in South Africa—Sexwale became the Premier of Gauteng Province.

==Early life and education==
Sexwale was born in the township of Orlando West, in Soweto. His father was a clerk at Johannesburg General Hospital and had fought against the Germans in World War II. Sexwale grew up during the black township&#x27;s upheaval. In 1973, he graduated from Orlando West High School.

In the late 1960s, Sexwale became a member of the Steve Biko&#x27;s Black Consciousness Movement and became a local leader of the radical South African Students&#x27; Movement. In the early 1970s, he joined the African National Congress&#x27;s armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (&quot;spear of the nation&quot;). While in Swaziland, he completed a Certificate in Business Studies at the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland. In 1975, Sexwale went into exile, undergoing military officers&#x27; training in the Soviet Union, where he specialized in military engineering.

==Imprisonment==
Upon his return to South Africa in 1976, Sexwale, along with 11 others, 
had been captured after a skirmish with the South African security forces. After an almost two-year trial in the Supreme Court of South Africa in Pretoria, he was charged and later convicted of terrorism and conspiracy to overthrow the government. In 1977, Sexwale was sent to the Robben Island maximum-security prison to serve an 18-year sentence. While imprisoned on Robben Island, he studied for a BCom degree at the University of South Africa. Sexwale was released in June 1990 under the terms of the Groote Schuur Agreement between the National Party government and the African National Congress. He had spent 13 years in prison.

During this time, he was represented in part by a paralegal named Judy van Vuuren. They began a personal relationship while he remained in prison, and married soon after his release in 1990.

==Political career==
After his release, Sexwale returned to Johannesburg, where he served as head of the public liaison department of the African National Congress Headquarters. He was subsequently appointed the head of special projects, where he reported to the ANC&#x27;s military headquarters. In September of 1990, he was elected as a member of the executive committee of the ANC in the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging (PWV) region.

After the South African elections in April 1994, Sexwale was elected as the first premier of the new PWV Province (renamed Gauteng Province in December 1994). In this role, he was credited with bringing peace to several politically volatile townships. Sexwale left politics for the corporate sector in 1998. The reasons for this were never made completely clear, but was reportedly due to feeling stifled by central government restrictions as well as becoming exhausted by internal African National Congress intrigues. Further speculation is that Sexwale left politics due to strong disagreements with the then Vice-President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki. Other speculation is that his marriage opened business opportunities in the white-dominated financial sectors that allowed him opportunities not open to other black leaders. Sexwale, Cyril Ramaphosa and Mbeki were possible candidates jostling for the presidency after Mandela stepped down. Once Thabo Mbeki appeared as the favourite candidate, both Sexwale and Ramaphosa left politics to follow successful careers as businessmen.

On 7 January 2007, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that Sexwale was campaigning for a leadership position within the ANC, which would have put him in position to replace Thabo Mbeki as President of South Africa in 2009. Sexwale admitted on BBC&#x27;s Hard Talk that if asked to stand for the elections as party president by structures of the ANC, he would seriously consider it. He was elected to the ANC&#x27;s 80-member National Executive Committee in December 2007 in 10th place, with 2,198 votes.

On 10 May 2009, President Jacob Zuma appointed Sexwale as Minister of Human Settlements, a ministry which replaced the Department of Housing.

===Mvelaphanda Group===
Upon leaving the public sector, Sexwale founded Mvelaphanda Holdings (&quot;mvelaphanda&quot; is the Venda word for &quot;progress&quot;), a company of which he is still executive chairman. Mvelaphanda is primarily focused on the mining, energy and related sectors. Some of Sexwale&#x27;s main interests are oil and diamond mining, for which he has been granted concessions across Africa and Russia; these interests are controlled by a subsidiary of Mvelaphanda Holdings called Mvelaphanda Resources.

Through his Mvelaphanda Group, Sexwale has substantial holdings in the mining sector. He is currently discussing with the Kazakh-owned Eurasian National Resources Corporation a plan to buy into mining interests in Guinea. A negotiating team is in secret talks about financing a local mining company to be owned by the Guinean state.

The new mining code, drafted by advisers to the Guinean President Alpha Condé, would grant the new state entity a free 15% stake in Guinea&#x27;s mining projects, with the option to buy another 20%. Sexwale was a business partner with Alpha Condé even before Condé became president.

Sexwale&#x27;s Mvelphanda Holdings and Walter Hennig&#x27;s Palladino Holdings have entered into a partnership with US investment fund managers Och-Ziff Capital Management in African Global Capital, a natural resources investment fund focussing on the continent.

===Africa Management Limited===
In January 2008 OZ Management, Mvelaphanda (Mvela) Holdings and Walter Hennig&#x27;s Palladino Holdings announced the creation of a new joint venture, Africa Management Limited.
As part of the joint venture, Africa Management Limited established African Global Capital, as a vehicle for investment in both the private and public markets across Africa, focusing on natural resources and related opportunities. Sexwale said: &quot;We intend to build on our already strong foothold in African investments in partnership with Och-Ziff. The partnership with Och-Ziff in African Global Capital will help us accelerate in building the leading African investment firm.&quot;

==Presidential ambitions==

He was mentioned as a possible candidate for Deputy President of the African National Congress in 2007. In September 2007 he announced his candidacy for the ANC Presidential nomination at the party convention in Polokwane. Prior to the convention, he withdrew his nomination and backed then Deputy President - Jacob Zuma. He did not stand for the Deputy Presidency as certain media speculation expected, the post eventually going to Kgalema Motlanthe. In 2009, he was appointed as Minister of Human Settlements by President Jacob Zuma having previously been touted as a possible Foreign Affairs or Defense Minister.

==2012 ANC Leadership election==

Sexwale was nominated as Kgalema Motlanthe&#x27;s Deputy Presidential running mate on 2 October 2012 by various regions in the Eastern Cape, the ruling party&#x27;s second largest branch. The African National Congress Youth League also indicated that it would back Sexwale for the Deputy Presidency at the ANC&#x27;s leadership election in Mangaung, Free State. On 18 December 2012, Sexwale was defeated for the post of Deputy President, coming in last place he received 463 votes while Cyril Ramaphosa received 3 018 votes and Mathews Phosa received 470 votes.

==Personal life==

Sexwale&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Tokyo&quot; is derived from his involvement with the sport of karate as a youth.

Sexwale has two children by a first wife, and two children by his second wife, Judy van Vuuren, a paralegal he met on Robben Island prison. Following his financial success, he moved into the previously predominantly white suburb of Illovo with his family. In 2013, Sexwale and his second wife filed for divorce.

Three days after the death of Mandela, on 8 December 2013, Sexwale appeared at a prayer service in Houghton, South Africa, where he hailed Mandela as the &quot;purest of the purest good&quot; and encouraged everyone to learn from his example: &quot;His method was that of solving a society&#x27;s most impractical problems through talking and engaging.&quot;

In November 2022, he married Natacha da Silva, a former model 38 years his junior.

==Controversies==
In 2001, Sexwale was accused, along with Cyril Ramaphosa and Mathews Phosa, of plotting to depose President Thabo Mbeki. Sexwale denied the charges and all three received the backing of Nelson Mandela; they were later exonerated from all accusations.

In 2002, he was refused a visa to enter the United States, which kept him from attending the listing of Gold Fields (a company in which he holds a 15 percent stake) on the New York Stock Exchange. It later transpired that he, along with many prominent South African anti-apartheid figures such as Nelson Mandela and South African cabinet minister Sidney Mufamadi, were still on that country&#x27;s list of global terrorists. After initiating legal action, going so far as to having papers served on the U.S. Department of State and following personal intervention by Condoleezza Rice, Sexwale and the others received ten-year waivers from the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of Homeland Security, as the government felt that permanently delisting them would mean changing the law, which would be a lengthy process. In July 2008 a bill became law in the US to &quot;provide relief for certain members of the African National Congress regarding admissibility&quot; and the ANC itself was removed from the terrorist list though on 28 October 2013, the ANC demanded an apology after Sexwale was held at a US airport because he was still on a terrorist watchlist.

In 2005, Sexwale was roundly criticized for being &quot;indecisive&quot; during the live finale of the South African version of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, which he fronted on SABC3. Both finalists, Zanele Batyashe, 24, and Khomotso Choma, 34, were hired in the finale which aired 22 September.

Sexwale&#x27;s name appeared in a United Nations report on illegal transactions under the Oil-for-Food Programme.

Sexwale&#x27;s Group 5 has received criticism for their involvement with Gugulethu Tycoon, Mzoli Ngcawuzele in the Guguletu Square Mall.

In July 2009, Sexwale was criticized by some civil society organizations and academics for what they called &#x27;publicity stunts&#x27; as well as for accusing protesting communities of fomenting &#x27;anarchy&#x27; and threatened &#x27;zero tolerance&#x27; against protesters &#x27;acting under other flags&#x27;.

===Guinea===

Sexwale led a group of South Africans who devised a plan to take over mineral assets and mining concessions in the Republic of Guinea, which the Guinean government planned to renationalize after revoking deals struck by previous governments in power.
Sexwale discussed a plan with the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation to buy into mining interests in Guinea.

Sexwale was believed to be the driver behind two British Virgin Island vehicles, Palladino Holdings and Floras Bell, which were managed by Walter Hennig. In April 2011 Walter Hennig concluded a secret deal with the Guinean President Alpha Condé that would transfer billions of dollars of mining assets belonging to companies such as BHP and Rio Tinto – who wanted to invest billions to develop the mines of Guinea – to South African intermediary Palladino Capital.

The deal comprised a loan of $25 million USD to the Guinean government to finance the start-up of a new Guinean state mining company. Behind Walter Hennig and the $25 million loan agreement were Sexwale; Mark Willcox, the chief executive of Mvelaphanda Group, and several other businessmen of South African, Polish, and British extraction. One of them was Ian Hannam, a famous London banker who tried to arrange Rusal&#x27;s float on the London Stock Exchange in 2007, but failed.

The loan deal was tipped for a potential investigation by the World Bank which was to look into whether the loan was actually intended to finance a new state-mining company, as outlined in the contract, or to benefit political or individual interests in return for mining concessions.

Mahmoud Thiam, the former Guinean mining minister and political opponent of President Alpha Condé, claimed that Sexwale &quot;was angry with the president because he was not delivering on his promises&quot; and that Sexwale was funding the president&#x27;s election campaign through the loan deal.

In July 2012, the Russian publication &quot;Argumenty i Fakty&quot; reported that Walter Hennig, through Palladino Capital 2, made a series of payments totalling $25 million to the Guinean president&#x27;s son, Mohammed Condé. The payments were made by Walter Hennig from an account held in Turks and Caicos into an offshore account held by Mohammed Condé in Monaco.

The money was originally lent by Hennig&#x27;s offshore company, Palladino Capital 2, in order to start the state mining company but various news articles cited anonymous sources who have claimed that the US$25 million was never reflected in the country&#x27;s accounts. When faced with these accusations, Sexwale declined to comment personally and instead released statements through his spokesperson Xolani Xundu that he would not confirm or deny any of the claims from &quot;faceless sources&quot;.

==Awards==
Sexwale has received many honours and awards, including the Légion d&#x27;honneur from France, an honorary doctorate from Nottingham Trent University, an honorary doctorate from De Montfort University, the Order of the Freedom of Havana (Cuba), the Cross of Valour (Ruby Class) from South Africa, and the Reach and Teach Leadership Award, from the United States. He is also chancellor of the Vaal University of Technology.
* 

Sexwale is also an honorary colonel in the South African Air Force and chair of the Council for the Support of National Defence, whose aim is to encourage part-time military service as well as building support in society for those who wish to serve in the military as volunteers. In 2004, he was voted 43rd in the list of &quot;Top 100 Great South Africans&quot;.

Sexwale holds positions in many international organisations, such as president of the South African/Russian Business, Technological and Cultural Association, and Vice President of the South African/Japanese Business Forum. He is also an Honorary Consul General of Finland in South Africa.

On 6 May 1993, the University was then reorganised as the Nanjing University of Economics (or the Nanjing School of Economics, ). Since 2003, the University has become the current Nanjing University of Finance and Economics.







== Campuses ==

The Nanjing University of Finance &amp; Economics has three campuses. One on Fujian Road in the city centre, one at the new university city (Yadong District) outside Nanjing called Xianlin, and a small campus approximately away from the Nanjing city centre in a village called Qiaotou. The University was restarted since 2000 by the combination of local specialised colleges. A variety of majors/programmes are available. Students are generally trained to have professional Chinese-English bilingual skills. 

== Rankings ==
As of 2025, the Nanjing University of Finance and Economics ranked #3 in East China and #10 nationwide among universities in China according to the Best Chinese Universities Ranking.

<text>CEU Business School was a US-accredited and licensed management school in Budapest, capital of EU member Hungary. It was founded by a group including investor and philanthropist George Soros in 1988, and was the first school in Central Eastern Europe to offer graduate business education leading to an American MBA. On August 1, 2017, CEU created its new Department of Economics and Business, merging the Department of Economics and CEU Business School.

==History and Location==
CEU Business School was founded in 1988 as International Management Center (IMC). After granting joint degrees with various US schools it became part of the also Soros-founded Central European University in 2002. Until today George Soros is closely connected with the university; amongst other things he personally hands over every Graduate&#x27;s diploma. As part of CEU&#x27;s campus redevelopment project the school relocated to CEU&#x27;s main campus in downtown Budapest (Nador utca 9-15) in 2016 from its previous location on the Buda side of the Danube. In fall 2010 Mel Horwitch, former program director at the MIT Sloan School of Management, has been appointed CEU Business School&#x27;s new Dean. Horwitch stepped down after finishing his term at the end of Academic Year 2015-16, and was replaced by Julius Horvath as Acting Dean.

==Degrees==
The School used to offer an intense 11-month Full-time MBA, an Executive MBA (Katalyst Executive MBA) taught in a weekend-format, and together with 7 other schools, a renowned Executive MBA called International Master of Management (IMM) which is taught on multiple campuses and has (2010) been ranked #21 Executive MBA in the world by Financial Times.
The Full-Time MBA is ranked #1 in Central Europe and #13 in Europe by QS Global 200 Business School Report 2012.

The MSc in IT Management program was relaunched in the autumn of 2013 and an intensive Master&#x27;s in Finance program was launched in early 2014.

Through CEU&#x27;s accreditation with the Hungarian authorities as well as with the American Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, CEU Business School&#x27;s degrees are recognized both in the European Union and the United States. The full-time and the part-time MBA programs are accredited by the Association of MBAs, the IMM program also by AACSB.

The previously existing Undergraduate Programs (BSc and Dual Degree in International Business with Uni Bocconi in Italy) have been discontinued as has the Executive MBA program in Romania.

The full-time MBA was discontinued from the 2017-18 academic year. A redesigned, cutting-edge Executive MBA program was launched in 2020.

==Partner Institutions==
CEU Business School offers a number of exchange and dual degree opportunities with schools in Europe, North America, and Asia including Schulich School of Business in Toronto, and CEIBS in Shanghai.

<doc id="1104658" wikidata="Q5020845" url="?curid=1104658" title="2004 California Proposition 64">
<text>Proposition 64 was a California ballot proposition on the November 2, 2004 ballot. It passed with 6,571,694 (59.0%) votes in favor and 4,578,725 (41.0%) against. It was an initiative statute that limited the California law on unfair competition, restricting private lawsuits against a company only to those where an individual is injured by and suffers a financial loss due to an unfair, unlawful, or fraudulent business practice and providing that otherwise only public prosecutors may file lawsuits charging unfair business practices.

Proponents argued that the measure would limit &quot;frivolous lawsuits&quot; against companies, which they claimed result mainly in a windfall for lawyers rather than consumers. Proponents also argued that businesses ultimately must pass along their costs in the form of higher prices to consumers.

Opponents charged that the proposition was heavily funded by businesses who wanted to weaken consumer rights by limiting Californians&#x27; ability to enforce environmental, public health, and consumer protection laws such as 1986&#x27;s Proposition 65.
==Official summary==
* Limits individual&#x27;s right to sue by allowing private enforcement of unfair business competition laws only if that individual was injured by, and suffered financial/property loss because of, an unfair business practice.
* Requires private representative claims to comply with procedural requirements applicable to class action lawsuits.
* Authorizes only the California Attorney General or local government prosecutors to sue on behalf of general public to enforce unfair business competition laws.
* Limits use of monetary penalties recovered by Attorney General or local government prosecutors to enforcement of consumer protection laws.

Summary of Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact:

* Unknown state costs or savings depending on whether the measure significantly increases or decreases court workload related to unfair competition lawsuits and the extent to which funds diverted by this measure are replaced.
* Unknown potential costs to local governments depending on the extent to which funds diverted by this measure are replaced.

<text>Littleborough ( ) is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England, in the upper Roch Valley by the foothills of the South Pennines, northeast of Rochdale and northeast of Manchester; Milnrow and the M62 motorway are to the south, and the rural uplands of Blackstone Edge to the east. According to the 2001 census, Littleborough, and its suburbs of Calderbrook, Shore and Smithy Bridge, had a population of 13,807.
Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, Littleborough and its surroundings have provided evidence of Neolithic, Celtic, Roman and Anglo-Saxon activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Littleborough was a hamlet in the manor of Hundersfield, parish of Rochdale and part of the Salford Hundred. It was focused upon the junction of two ancient routes over the Pennines — one of which may have been a Roman road — that joined to cross the River Roch. By 1472, Littleborough consisted of a chapel, a cluster of cottages, and an inn, and its inhabitants were broadly farmers who were spurred to weave wool by merchants who passed between the markets at Rochdale and Halifax. When cotton was introduced as a base to make textiles, Littleborough experienced an influx of families, mostly from the neighbouring West Riding of Yorkshire. Affluent homes and estates were established on Littleborough&#x27;s fringes.

In the late 18th century, the low-altitude Summit Gap between Littleborough and Walsden was approved as the best route over the Pennines for the Rochdale Canal and the Manchester to Leeds railway; Hollingworth Lake was built at Littleborough&#x27;s south side as a feeder reservoir to regulate the waters of the canal. This infrastructure encouraged industrialists to modify Littleborough&#x27;s traditional handloom cloth workshops with a mechanised form of textile production. Attracted to the area&#x27;s natural resources and modern infrastructure, coal mining, engineering ventures and increasingly large textile mills contributed to Littleborough&#x27;s population growth and urbanisation, sealing its status as a mill town. Local government reforms established the Littleborough Urban District in 1894 which was governed by its own district council until its abolition in 1974.

By the mid-20th century, imports of cheaper foreign goods prompted the gradual deindustrialisation of Littleborough, but its commercial diversity allowed it to repel the ensuing economic depression experienced elsewhere in North West England. Subsumed into the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale in 1974, Littleborough endures as a commuter town with a distinct community; its Civic Trust works to preserve and enhance its historic character, and societies exist to use the surrounding countryside for water-skiing, horse riding and other recreational activities. Littleborough&#x27;s stone-built town centre is designated as a Conservation Area for its special architectural qualities.

== History ==
Evidence of human activity in the area, dating to at least the Neolithic period, exists in the form of ancient flint tool and arrowhead discoveries. Rochdale Museum hold an early Iron Age bracelet made of a shale from Kimmeridge in Dorset, which was found in 1929 on Flint Hill, east of Blackstone Edge. A torc (or necklet) with ornamentation of a late-Celtic design was found in the Mawrode area of Littleborough in 1832; and the name Calderbrook is derived from an ancient Celtic language, two factors implying inhabitation by Celtic Britons.

Littleborough is supposed to have been the site of a small station along the Roman road that is routed from &quot;Mamucium&quot; (Manchester) to &quot;Eboracum&quot; (York) which skirts the town. Evidence of Roman occupation in Littleborough comes from finds of coins and pottery, and the right arm of a silver statue of Victory. Following the end of Roman rule in Britain, the remaining population came under the influence of the Anglo-Saxons. Place names indicate the Anglo-Saxon settlement of the Littleborough area, for example the &#x27;gate&#x27; element in Lydgate and Reddyshore Scout Gate is Old English for &#x27;road&#x27;. The name Littleborough is itself derived from the Old English &quot;lȳtel bruh&quot; (meaning small fortified place) or else &quot;lȳtel bróc&quot; (meaning small watercourse).

In 1848 the population was chiefly employed in three flannel-mills, four cotton-factories, in bleachworks, six coal-pits, a stone-quarry and in brick-making.

== Governance ==
Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Littleborough was a chapelry and component area of Hundersfield, an ancient township within the parish of Rochdale and Salford Hundred. Hundersfield later constituted a civil parish encompassing several settlements to the northeast of Rochdale, until its dissolution.

Littleborough&#x27;s first local authority was a local board of health established in 1870; Littlborough Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation for parts of the then townships of Blatchinworth and Calderbrook, of Wuerdle and Wardle and of Butterworth, with the local board&#x27;s territory being expanded into further parts of these townships in 1879. Under the Local Government Act 1894, the area of the local board expanded to encompass all of Blatchinworth and Calderbrook and became the Littleborough Urban District, a local government district in the Rochdale Poor Law Union and administrative county of Lancashire. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Littleborough Urban District was abolished, and Littleborough and its outlying settlements have, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. In anticipation of the new local government arrangement, Littleborough Urban District Council applied for civil parish status to be granted to the locality after 1974, however the application was not successful.
The Littleborough Neighbourhood Forum is now forming as a result of the Localism Act 2011.

== Geography ==
At (53.644°, −2.098°), and north-northwest of central London, Littleborough stands roughly above sea level, on the western slopes of the Pennines, north-northeast of Manchester city centre, in the valley of the River Roch. Blackstone Edge and West Yorkshire are to the east; Rochdale and Milnrow are to the southwest and south.

In Littleborough are the localities and suburbs of Calderbrook, Chelburn, Durn, Featherstall, Gale, Hollinworth, Laneside, Rake, Shore, Sladen, Smithy Bridge, Stansfield, Summit and Whitelees.

== Transport ==
Littleborough is served by the town&#x27;s two railway stations, Littleborough itself and at Smithy Bridge.
The town is situated on the A58 between Rochdale and Halifax and is the starting point of the A6033 which runs northwards up to Todmorden.
The town is also well provided with buses which connect all districts in the Rochdale area and into the Pennine towns as far as Halifax.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill and local relay TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Manchester, Heart North West, Smooth North West, Hits Radio Manchester, Greatest Hits Radio Manchester &amp; The North West, Capital Manchester and Lancashire and Rochdale Valley, a community based radio station.

The town is served by the local newspaper Rochdale Observer including regional newspaper Manchester Evening News.

<text>Tellaro is a small fishing village, perched on a cliff on the east coast of the Gulf of La Spezia in Liguria, northern Italy. It is a &quot;frazione&quot; of the &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of Lerici. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

Tellaro has been the destination for many Italian and foreign artists. Mario Soldati made it his home in the last years of his life. Tellaro is one of the seaside villages that annually participate in the Palio del Golfo, an annual boat race held in the gulf of La Spezia.

==History==
*1152: Tellora and Lerici are part of the Republic of Genoa.
*The church of Saint George (named after the Christian matyr who triumphed over the dragon) was built between 1564 and 1584 as a fortification for the town to help protect against the constant incursions of the Saracens, the Catalans and local raiders.

==Culture==
Among the festivals of particular interest is the underwater Christmas celebrating the birth of Jesus on Christmas night. Every year the statue of the baby Jesus emerges from the water carried by a group of divers and placed in the manger, in a setting of over 8,000 candles and celebrated by fireworks over the sea. 
The patron saint of Tellaro is St. George, which is celebrated on the 23rd of April. 
The &quot;Festival of the Octopus&quot;, which takes place every year on the second Sunday in August, organized by the Unione Sportiva active in the Ligurian village.
There are many legends about Tellaro. The most famous tells the story an attack by Saracen pirates in the Middle Ages. The village was saved by a giant octopus that warned the population by climbing up the church tower and ringing the bells.

== Popular culture ==
The 2021 animated film &quot;Luca&quot; was primarily based on the nearby Cinque Terre towns, however the Pixar animation team visited Tellaro in addition and drew inspiration from it for the film.

<text>are a Japan-market six-piece group formed in 1999 containing Kate Pierson (of The B-52&#x27;s), bassist Mick Karn (of Japan), vocalist Yuki Isoya (of Judy and Mary), Takemi Shima and Masahide Sakuma (both of The Plastics), and Steven Wolf, the session drummer. Masahide composed most of the music with input from Pierson and Yuki who also wrote the lyrics. From the 30-second opening track, which starts with ominous techno music and ends with Yuki and Pierson exclaiming &quot;Hello everybody nice to meet you we&#x27;re NiNa,&quot; the band&#x27;s eponymous and only album is very diverse.

The distinctive album contains a wide variety of music from straightforward ballads to electronica. Credited as a &quot;conceptual and visual agent provocateur,&quot; Shima appears to have played a Brian Eno-like role on the recording. The album and two singles which preceded it were all hits in Japan but are mostly unknown in other parts of the world with the exceptions of avid B-52s/Kate Pierson fans.

<text>Barthélemy Charles Joseph Dumortier (; 3 April 1797 – 9 July 1878) was a Belgian who conducted a parallel career of botanist and Member of Parliament and is the first discoverer of biological cell division.

Over the course of his life, Dumortier named over 688 different taxa, many of which are still in use today.

A statue depicting him can be found in Tournai, Belgium, the city where he spent much of his life. The statue was constructed in 1883, by sculptor Charles Fraikin. The statue was damaged by the germans during World War I, but was repaired. Dumortier is depicted in bourgeois clothes, with his right arm folded over his chest and his left arm leaning on political documents supported by a lion.

==Biography==
Barthélemy Dumortier was a son of the merchant and city councillor Barthélemy-François Dumortier and of Mariue-Jeanne Willaumez. He married Philippine Ruteau and they had a son, Barthélemy-Noël Dumortier (1830-1915) and seven other children.

Barthélemy-Charles became politically active in the early eighteen twenties. In 1824 he founded the &quot;Courrier de l&#x27;Escaut&quot;, a paper critical of the government. He adhered in 1830 to the Belgian revolution.

In 1831 he became a member of the first elected parliament of the new kingdom, as the member for Tournai. He remained elected until 1847. He then switched seats and was now elected for the city of Roulers and held this seat until his death.

Dumortier must be regarded as the first discoverer of cell division. In 1832, he described cell division in simple aquatic plants (French &#x27;conferve&#x27;):

“Le développement des conferves est aussi simple que leur structure; il s’opère par l’addition de nouvelles cellules aux anciennes, et cette addition se fait toujours par l’extrémité. La cellule terminale s’allonge plus que celles inférieures; alors il s’opère dans le fluide intérieur une production médiane, qui tend à diviser la cellule en deux parties dont l’inférieure reste stationnaire, tandis que la terminale s’allonge de nouveau, produit encore une nouvelle cloison intérieure, et ainsi de même. La production de la cloison médiane est - elle originairement double ou simple? Voilà ce qu’il est impossible de déterminer; mais toujours est-il vrai de dire que plus tard elle paraît double dans les conjuguées, et que quand deux cellules se séparent naturellement, chacune d&#x27;elles est close aux deux extrémités.”

In the analogous English translation:

“The development of the conferve is as simple as its structure; it takes place by the attachment of new cells to the old, and this attachment always takes place from the end. The terminal cell elongates more than the deeper cells; then the production of a lateral bisector takes place in the inner fluid, which tends to divide the cell into two parts, of which the deeper one remains stationary, while the terminal part elongates again, forms a new inner partition, and so on. Is the production of the middle partition originally double or single? It is impossible to determine this, but it is always true that it later appears double when united, and that when two cells naturally separate, each of them is closed at both ends.”

In 1872 he was awarded the honorary title of Minister of State. He also was awarded nobility with the title of earl. However, for unknown reasons, he did not raise the necessary patent letters and was therefore not ennobled.

==Botanist==
In the early 1820s, Dumortier published in Latin his first contribution to botany. In 1827 he published a complete national flora, the &quot;Florula Belgica&quot;.
In 1829 Dumortier was already regarded as one of the greatest naturalists of the Low-Countries and became a member of the Académie de Bruxelles. He not only studied botany but also zoology.

In 1835 Dumortier first proposed the genus Lepidozia. 
His reputation as a botanist was so brilliant that the Home Office asked him to be its representative in the Brussels’ Botanic Garden, then a joint stock company, supported by the State. In 1862, the &quot;Société Royale de Botanique de Belgique&quot; was created and Dumortier became its president.
When the company that ran the Brussels’ botanic garden collapsed, Dumortier developed the idea of a state-owned botanic garden in the capital. He succeeded in convincing the Parliament in 1869 of buying the impressive herbarium and dried collections of the late Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius. A few months later the state bought the garden of the &#x27;Société Royale d’Horticulture de Belgique&#x27;. Dumortier hoped to create a botanic garden whose role model was the Royal Kew Gardens.

His name was given to two plant species: to the &quot;Hemerocallis dumortieri&quot; (Hemerocallidoideae) and to the &quot;Stenocereus dumortieri&quot; (Cactaceae).

He was honoured in 1863, in the naming of &quot;Mortierella&quot;, which is a genus of soil fungi belonging to the order Mortierellales. He was again honored in 1967, in the naming of &quot;Aquamortierella,&quot; a genus of fungi in the Mortierellaceae family of the Zygomycota.

Some consider him to be the true discoverer of cell division, although he is rarely credited as such.

<text>The National Institute of Technology Warangal (NIT-Warangal or NIT-W) is a public technical and research university located in Warangal, India. It is recognised as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India. The foundation stone for this institute was laid by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on 1959, the first in the chain of 31 NITs (formerly known as RECs) in the country. The institute was renamed as the National Institute of Technology, Warangal in 2002.

==History==
The Regional Engineering College, Warangal was the first to be established (in 1959) among the chain of 15 Regional Engineering Colleges in the country. The approval of the Government of India to establish one of the RECs meant for the southern region of Warangal was conveyed to the State Government through its letter no .F 11- 5/ 58- T. 5 dated 30 January 1959. The Government of Andhra Pradesh through G. O. Ms. No. 2440 (Education Department) dated 15 July 1959 constituted the first board of Governors of the Regional Engineering College, Warangal, appointing Dr. D.S. Reddy (then Vice-Chancellor of Osmania University) as the chairman. The foundation stone for the college was laid by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on 10 October 1959 in Kazipet. The classes for the first batch of students in Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering branches commenced on 12 September 1959 in temporary sheds erected in the Balasamudram area of Hanamkonda. Later temporary sheds were also erected in the Industrial Colony of Warangal for conducting lecture classes. Laboratory classes and workshop classes were conducted in the Government Polytechnic, Warangal in the initial stages. The conduction of classes on the premises of the permanent site in Kazipet commenced in January 1963.

The bachelor&#x27;s programme in Chemical Engineering was initiated in 1964. The following year saw the start of the Metallurgical Engineering programme. In 1971, the college started the undergraduate program in Electronics and Communication Engineering. BTech in Computer Science &amp; Engineering was started in 1983 and MTech in Computer Science &amp; Engineering in 1987. In 2006, the institute started a bachelor&#x27;s program in Biotechnology.

In 1976, its affiliation was changed from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University to Kakatiya University, with which it remained affiliated until the institute was granted deemed university status in 2002.

In 1994, the institute was selected by the Overseas Development Administration of the UK for exchange programs between the UK and India in the field of information technology. This program ran till 1999. In 2000, the institute started its MBA program.

In 2001, a centre of Software Technology Parks of India was opened in its campus.

In September 2002, the college was renamed as National Institute of Technology and was given deemed university status. NITW was given the status of Institute of National Importance (INI) on 15 August 2007.

<text>The Shearers and Rural Workers&#x27; Union is an Australian industrial union that is not registered with the Fair Work Commission and is also not affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

They formed on 1 May 1994 in Victoria when members of the Australian Workers&#x27; Union split away due to the declining membership of the AWU; the increase in AWU dues; and, a perceived anti-democratic bureaucracy in the AWU.

<doc id="1104684" wikidata="Q1961439" url="?curid=1104684" title="Plymtree">
<text>Plymtree is a small village and civil parish about 3.5 miles south of the town of Cullompton in the county of Devon, England. The parish is surrounded, clockwise from the north, by the parishes of Broadhembury, Payhembury, Clyst Hydon and Cullompton. In 2001 it had a population of 605, compared to 359 in 1901.

The village has a public house called The Blacksmith Arms and a Church of England primary school (https://plymtree-primary.devon.sch.uk/devon/primary/plymtree) which is part of the Culm Valley Federation with Kentisbeare and Culmstock Schools. There is a small community run village shop and post office, a village hall, playground and recreation field. The yearly country fayre is held on the August Bank Holiday which raises funds for the Village Hall and local Riding for the Disabled Group. It has a cricket club and tennis court.

==Parish church==
St John the Baptist&#x27;s church is medieval; the tower and the south aisle are Perpendicular but the nave and chancel are older. The rood screen is a splendid example and exceptionally well preserved. It incorporates emblems which indicate that it was given by Isabel widow of Humphrey Stafford, Earl of Devon, who was beheaded in 1469. The wainscoting is painted with figures but they are not of high aesthetic value. There is a small alabaster relief of the Resurrection of Christ which is Flemish work of about 1600.
In the churchyard of St John the Baptist&#x27;s church is a historic yew tree.

The first known English personification of Christmas was associated with merry-making, singing and drinking. A carol attributed to Richard Smart, Rector of Plymtree from 1435 to 1477, has &#x27;Sir Christemas&#x27; announcing the news of Christ&#x27;s birth and encouraging his listeners to drink: &quot;Buvez bien par toute la compagnie, / Make good cheer and be right merry, / And sing with us now joyfully: Nowell, nowell.&quot;

==Notable people==
In 1832 Joseph Dornford was presented by his Oxford college to the rectory of Plymtree, and in 1847 he was collated by Henry Phillpotts a prebendary of Exeter Cathedral. He died at Plymtree on 18 January 1868, aged 74.

==Historic estates==
The parish of Plymtree contains various historic estates including:
*Fordmore, anciently &quot;Ford&#x27;s Moore&quot;, from before 1161 to 1702 the seat of the &quot;at Ford&quot; (later &quot;Ford&quot;) family.
*Plymtree Manor.
*Woodbeer Court.

<text>Albert Moulton Foweraker (7 July 1873 – January, 1942) was an English painter.

He was educated at Exeter Cathedral School, was an exhibitioner at Cavendish College, Cambridge in 1890, and went on to Christ&#x27;s College, from where he obtained his Degree in Applied Science in 1893. He obtained First Class Honours, City &amp; Guilds in 1896, and was a qualified Milling Engineer. He was also sometime Demonstrator In Science at Exeter Technical College. He was married in July 1897 to Annie Triphina Coles.

In 1898, he took up art professionally, and between that year and 1912, he exhibited his work regularly. He was made a member of the Royal Society of British Artists in 1902, and sent 52 paintings to exhibitions at their Galleries in Pall Mall during these years. He also exhibited at several important provincial galleries. He originated an exhibition of works by modern painters at Exeter, which developed into the Devon And Cornwall Fine Art Society.

He moved from Exeter to Lelant, Cornwall in 1902, and travelled frequently to Spain, especially the South during the early 1900s and in the 1920s. He also visited Southern France and North Africa, and produced many paintings from these travels. He was also a very prolific local artist, and painted a very large number of landscapes and local scenes from Devon, Cornwall and, of course, Dorset, to which County he moved in the mid-1920s, living at Northbrook Road, Swanage for many years.

He was fascinated by the effects of certain light on the landscape, particularly moonlight, as his paintings show. He is known for his use of the colour blue, and his moonlight paintings of people carrying lanterns and light shining from windows are much sought after.

He appeared to have been very interested in the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster of 1912, particularly in the Enquiries subsequently held, apparently suspecting suppression of certain information. In 1940 he made a Codicil to his Will, leaving various documents and papers relating to these matters, to the British Museum. The artist died in January 1942 at Swanage, at the age of 68, and is buried in Godlingston Cemetery, Ulwell, Swanage.

A common source of confusion with his paintings is that his signature can easily be read by the unwary as &#x27;Doweraker&#x27;, and in this guise &#x27;A.M. Doweraker, fl.1920s–1940s&#x27; can be found in auction records.

<doc id="1104696" wikidata="Q5020848" url="?curid=1104696" title="2004 California Proposition 65">
<text>Proposition 65 was a California ballot proposition on the November 2, 2004 ballot. It failed to pass with 3,901,748 (37.6%) votes in favor and 6,471,506 (62.4%) against. It was a state constitutional amendment that would have required voter approval for any state legislation reducing certain local government revenues from January 2003 levels. It was officially known as the Local Taxpayers and Public Safety Protection Act.

Local governments (cities and counties) in California primarily receive their revenue from three sources: property taxes, local sales taxes, and the vehicle license fees. Proposition 65 was born out of frustration from local governments as the California state government increasingly used local revenues to pay for state government programs, especially during tough financial times.

Proponents of the proposition ultimately used it as a bargaining tool to negotiate an agreement with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the California State Legislature on protecting local government revenues. The result was the compromise Proposition 1A on the same ballot, which provided more flexible terms and deferred its restrictions until 2006. As a result, previous proponents of Proposition 65 dropped their support in favor of Proposition 1A.

This proposition conflicted with the provisions of Proposition 1A on the same ballot. The California Constitution provides that if the provisions of two approved propositions are in conflict, only the provisions of the measure with the higher number of &quot;yes&quot; votes at the statewide election take effect. (Since Prop 65 did not pass, the issue was moot.)
==Official summary==
* Requires voter approval for any legislation that provides for any reduction, based on January 1, 2003, levels, of local governments&#x27; vehicle license fee revenues, sales tax powers and revenues, and proportionate share of local property tax revenues.
* Permits local government to suspend performance of state mandate if state fails to reimburse local government within 180 days of final determination of state-mandated obligation; except mandates requiring local government to provide/modify: any protection, benefit or employment status to employee/retiree, or any procedural/substantive employment right for employee or employee organization.

Summary of Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact:

* Significant changes to state authority over local finances. Higher local government revenues than otherwise would have been the case, possibly in the billions of dollars annually over time. Any such local revenue impacts would result in decreased resources to the state of similar amounts.

<doc id="1104697" wikidata="Q3118090" url="?curid=1104697" title="Homotopy groups of spheres">
<text>In the mathematical field of algebraic topology, the homotopy groups of spheres describe how spheres of various dimensions can wrap around each other. They are examples of topological invariants, which reflect, in algebraic terms, the structure of spheres viewed as topological spaces, forgetting about their precise geometry. Unlike homology groups, which are also topological invariants, the homotopy groups are surprisingly complex and difficult to compute.

The -dimensional unit sphere — called the -sphere for brevity, and denoted as — generalizes the familiar circle () and the ordinary sphere (). The -sphere may be defined geometrically as the set of points in a Euclidean space of dimension located at a unit distance from the origin. The -th &quot;homotopy group&quot; summarizes the different ways in which the -dimensional sphere can be mapped continuously into the sphere . This summary does not distinguish between two mappings if one can be continuously deformed to the other; thus, only equivalence classes of mappings are summarized. An &quot;addition&quot; operation defined on these equivalence classes makes the set of equivalence classes into an abelian group.

The problem of determining falls into three regimes, depending on whether is less than, equal to, or greater than :
* For , any mapping from to is homotopic (i.e., continuously deformable) to a constant mapping, i.e., a mapping that maps all of to a single point of . In the smooth case, it follows directly from Sard&#x27;s Theorem. Therefore the homotopy group is the trivial group.
* When , every map from to itself has a degree that measures how many times the sphere is wrapped around itself. This degree identifies the homotopy group with the group of integers under addition. For example, every point on a circle can be mapped continuously onto a point of another circle; as the first point is moved around the first circle, the second point may cycle several times around the second circle, depending on the particular mapping. 
* The most interesting and surprising results occur when . The first such surprise was the discovery of a mapping called the Hopf fibration, which wraps the 3-sphere around the usual sphere in a non-trivial fashion, and so is not equivalent to a one-point mapping.

The question of computing the homotopy group for positive turned out to be a central question in algebraic topology that has contributed to development of many of its fundamental techniques and has served as a stimulating focus of research. One of the main discoveries is that the homotopy groups are independent of for . These are called the stable homotopy groups of spheres and have been computed for values of up to 90. The stable homotopy groups form the coefficient ring of an extraordinary cohomology theory, called stable cohomotopy theory. The unstable homotopy groups (for ) are more erratic; nevertheless, they have been tabulated for . Most modern computations use spectral sequences, a technique first applied to homotopy groups of spheres by Jean-Pierre Serre. Several important patterns have been established, yet much remains unknown and unexplained.

==Background==
The study of homotopy groups of spheres builds on a great deal of background material, here briefly reviewed. Algebraic topology provides the larger context, itself built on topology and abstract algebra, with homotopy groups as a basic example.

=== -sphere ===
An ordinary sphere in three-dimensional space—the surface, not the solid ball—is just one example of what a sphere means in topology. Geometry defines a sphere rigidly, as a shape. Here are some alternatives.
* Implicit surface: 
: This is the set of points in 3-dimensional Euclidean space found exactly one unit away from the origin. It is called the 2-sphere, , for reasons given below. The same idea applies for any dimension ; the equation produces the -sphere as a geometric object in ()-dimensional space. For example, the 1-sphere is a circle.
* Disk with collapsed rim: written in topology as 
: This construction moves from geometry to pure topology. The disk is the region contained by a circle, described by the inequality , and its rim (or &quot;boundary&quot;) is the circle , described by the equality . If a balloon is punctured and spread flat it produces a disk; this construction repairs the puncture, like pulling a drawstring. The slash, pronounced &quot;modulo&quot;, means to take the topological space on the left (the disk) and in it join together as one all the points on the right (the circle). The region is 2-dimensional, which is why topology calls the resulting topological space a 2-sphere. Generalized, produces . For example, is a line segment, and the construction joins its ends to make a circle. An equivalent description is that the boundary of an -dimensional disk is glued to a point, producing a CW complex.
* Suspension of equator: written in topology as 
: This construction, though simple, is of great theoretical importance. Take the circle to be the equator, and sweep each point on it to one point above (the North Pole), producing the northern hemisphere, and to one point below (the South Pole), producing the southern hemisphere. For each positive integer , the -sphere has as equator the ()-sphere , and the suspension produces .

Some theory requires selecting a fixed point on the sphere, calling the pair a &quot;pointed sphere&quot;. For some spaces the choice matters, but for a sphere all points are equivalent so the choice is a matter of convenience. For spheres constructed as a repeated suspension, the point , which is on the equator of all the levels of suspension, works well; for the disk with collapsed rim, the point resulting from the collapse of the rim is another obvious choice.

=== Homotopy group ===
The distinguishing feature of a topological space is its continuity structure, formalized in terms of open sets or neighborhoods. A continuous map is a function between spaces that preserves continuity. A homotopy is a continuous path between continuous maps; two maps connected by a homotopy are said to be homotopic. The idea common to all these concepts is to discard variations that do not affect outcomes of interest. An important practical example is the residue theorem of complex analysis, where &quot;closed curves&quot; are continuous maps from the circle into the complex plane, and where two closed curves produce the same integral result if they are homotopic in the topological space consisting of the plane minus the points of singularity.

The first homotopy group, or fundamental group, of a (path connected) topological space thus begins with continuous maps from a pointed circle to the pointed space , where maps from one pair to another map into . These maps (or equivalently, closed curves) are grouped together into equivalence classes based on homotopy (keeping the &quot;base point&quot; fixed), so that two maps are in the same class if they are homotopic. Just as one point is distinguished, so one class is distinguished: all maps (or curves) homotopic to the constant map are called null homotopic. The classes become an abstract algebraic group with the introduction of addition, defined via an &quot;equator pinch&quot;. This pinch maps the equator of a pointed sphere (here a circle) to the distinguished point, producing a &quot;bouquet of spheres&quot; — two pointed spheres joined at their distinguished point. The two maps to be added map the upper and lower spheres separately, agreeing on the distinguished point, and composition with the pinch gives the sum map.

More generally, the -th homotopy group, begins with the pointed -sphere , and otherwise follows the same procedure. The null homotopic class acts as the identity of the group addition, and for equal to (for positive ) — the homotopy groups of spheres — the groups are abelian and finitely generated. If for some all maps are null homotopic, then the group consists of one element, and is called the trivial group.

A continuous map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy groups. In particular, if the map is a continuous bijection (a homeomorphism), so that the two spaces have the same topology, then their -th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all . However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it can also make certain computations easier.

==Low-dimensional examples==
The low-dimensional examples of homotopy groups of spheres provide a sense of the subject, because these special cases can be visualized in ordinary 3-dimensional space. However, such visualizations are not mathematical proofs, and do not capture the possible complexity of maps between spheres.


The simplest case concerns the ways that a circle (1-sphere) can be wrapped around another circle. This can be visualized by wrapping a rubber band around one&#x27;s finger: it can be wrapped once, twice, three times and so on. The wrapping can be in either of two directions, and wrappings in opposite directions will cancel out after a deformation. The homotopy group is therefore an infinite cyclic group, and is isomorphic to the group of integers under addition: a homotopy class is identified with an integer by counting the number of times a mapping in the homotopy class wraps around the circle. This integer can also be thought of as the winding number of a loop around the origin in the plane.

The identification (a group isomorphism) of the homotopy group with the integers is often written as an equality: thus .

Mappings from a 2-sphere to a 2-sphere can be visualized as wrapping a plastic bag around a ball and then sealing it. The sealed bag is topologically equivalent to a 2-sphere, as is the surface of the ball. The bag can be wrapped more than once by twisting it and wrapping it back over the ball. (There is no requirement for the continuous map to be injective and so the bag is allowed to pass through itself.) The twist can be in one of two directions and opposite twists can cancel out by deformation. The total number of twists after cancellation is an integer, called the &quot;degree&quot; of the mapping. As in the case mappings from the circle to the circle, this degree identifies the homotopy group with the group of integers, .

These two results generalize: for all , (see below).

Any continuous mapping from a circle to an ordinary sphere can be continuously deformed to a one-point mapping, and so its homotopy class is trivial. One way to visualize this is to imagine a rubber-band wrapped around a frictionless ball: the band can always be slid off the ball. The homotopy group is therefore a trivial group, with only one element, the identity element, and so it can be identified with the subgroup of consisting only of the number zero. This group is often denoted by 0. Showing this rigorously requires more care, however, due to the existence of
space-filling curves.

This result generalizes to higher dimensions. All mappings from a lower-dimensional sphere into a sphere of higher dimension are similarly trivial: if , then . This can be shown as a consequence of the cellular approximation theorem.
All the interesting cases of homotopy groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher-dimensional sphere onto one of lower dimension. Unfortunately, the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, . This is because has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible (it has the homotopy type of a point). In addition, because is simply connected, by the lifting criterion, any map from to can be lifted to a map into the real line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space (via composition).

The first nontrivial example with concerns mappings from the 3-sphere to the ordinary 2-sphere, and was discovered by Heinz Hopf, who constructed a nontrivial map from to , now known as the Hopf fibration. This map generates the homotopy group .

==History==
In the late 19th century Camille Jordan introduced the notion of homotopy and used the notion of a homotopy group, without using the language of group theory. A more rigorous approach was adopted by Henri Poincaré in his 1895 set of papers &quot;Analysis situs&quot; where the related concepts of homology and the fundamental group were also introduced.

Higher homotopy groups were first defined by Eduard Čech in 1932. (His first paper was withdrawn on the advice of Pavel Sergeyevich Alexandrov and Heinz Hopf, on the grounds that the groups were commutative so could not be the right generalizations of the fundamental group.) Witold Hurewicz is also credited with the introduction of homotopy groups in his 1935 paper. An important method for calculating the various groups is the concept of stable algebraic topology, which finds properties that are independent of the dimensions. Typically these only hold for larger dimensions. The first such result was Hans Freudenthal&#x27;s suspension theorem, published in 1937. Stable algebraic topology flourished between 1945 and 1966 with many important results. In 1953 George W. Whitehead showed that there is a metastable range for the homotopy groups of spheres. Jean-Pierre Serre used spectral sequences to show that most of these groups are finite, the exceptions being and . Others who worked in this area included José Adem, Hiroshi Toda, Frank Adams, J. Peter May, Mark Mahowald, Daniel Isaksen, Guozhen Wang, and Zhouli Xu. The stable homotopy groups are known for up to 90, and, as of 2023, unknown for larger .

==General theory==

As noted already, when is less than , , the trivial group. The reason is that a continuous mapping from an -sphere to an -sphere with can always be deformed so that it is not surjective. Consequently, its image is contained in with a point removed; this is a contractible space, and any mapping to such a space can be deformed into a one-point mapping.

When , , the infinite cyclic group, generated by the identity map from the -sphere to itself. It follows from the definition of homotopy groups that the identity map and its multiples are elements of . That these are the only elements can be shown using the Freudenthal suspension theorem, which relates the homotopy groups of a space and its suspension. In the case of spheres, the suspension of an -sphere is an -sphere, and the suspension theorem states that there is a group homomorphism which is an isomorphism for all and is surjective for . This implies that there is a sequence of group homomorphisms
:formula_1
in which the first homomorphism is a surjection and the rest are isomorphisms. As noted already, , and contains a copy of generated by the identity map, so the fact that there is a surjective homomorphism from to implies that . The rest of the homomorphisms in the sequence are isomorphisms, so for all .

The homology groups , with , are all trivial. It therefore came as a great surprise historically that the corresponding homotopy groups are not trivial in general. This is the case that is of real importance: the higher homotopy groups , for , are surprisingly complex and difficult to compute, and the effort to compute them has generated a significant amount of new mathematics.

===Table===
The following table gives an idea of the complexity of the higher homotopy groups even for spheres of dimension 8 or less. In this table, the entries are either a) the trivial group 0, the infinite cyclic group , b) the finite cyclic groups of order (written as ), or c) the direct products of such groups (written, for example, as or ). Extended tables of homotopy groups of spheres are given at the end of the article.

The first row of this table is straightforward. The homotopy groups of the 1-sphere are trivial for , because the universal covering space, formula_2, which has the same higher homotopy groups, is contractible.

Beyond the first row, the higher homotopy groups () appear to be chaotic, but in fact there are many patterns, some obvious and some very subtle.
* The groups below the jagged black line are constant along the diagonals (as indicated by the red, green and blue coloring).
* Most of the groups are finite. The only infinite groups are either on the main diagonal or immediately above the jagged line (highlighted in yellow).
* The second and third rows of the table are the same starting in the third column (i.e., for ). This isomorphism is induced by the Hopf fibration .
* For and the homotopy groups do not vanish. However, for .
These patterns follow from many different theoretical results.

===Stable and unstable groups===
The fact that the groups below the jagged line in the table above are constant along the diagonals is explained by the suspension theorem of Hans Freudenthal, which implies that the suspension homomorphism from to is an isomorphism for . The groups with are called the &quot;stable homotopy groups of spheres&quot;, and are denoted : they are finite abelian groups for , and have been computed in numerous cases, although the general pattern is still elusive. For , the groups are called the &quot;unstable homotopy groups of spheres&quot;.

===Hopf fibrations===
The classical Hopf fibration is a fiber bundle:

:formula_3

The general theory of fiber bundles shows that there is a long exact sequence of homotopy groups

:formula_4

For this specific bundle, each group homomorphism , induced by the inclusion , maps all of to zero, since the lower-dimensional sphere can be deformed to a point inside the higher-dimensional one . This corresponds to the vanishing of . Thus the long exact sequence breaks into short exact sequences,

:formula_5

Since is a suspension of , these sequences are split by the suspension homomorphism , giving isomorphisms

:formula_6

Since vanishes for at least 3, the first row shows that and are isomorphic whenever is at least 3, as observed above.

The Hopf fibration may be constructed as follows: pairs of complex numbers with form a 3-sphere, and their ratios cover the complex plane plus infinity, a 2-sphere. The Hopf map sends any such pair to its ratio.

Similarly (in addition to the Hopf fibration formula_7, where the bundle projection is a double covering), there are generalized Hopf fibrations

:formula_8

:formula_9

constructed using pairs of quaternions or octonions instead of complex numbers. Here, too, and are zero. Thus the long exact sequences again break into families of split short exact sequences, implying two families of relations.

:formula_10

:formula_11

The three fibrations have base space with , for . A fibration does exist for () as mentioned above, but not for () and beyond. Although generalizations of the relations to are often true, they sometimes fail; for example,

:formula_12

Thus there can be no fibration

:formula_13

the first non-trivial case of the Hopf invariant one problem, because such a fibration would imply that the failed relation is true.

===Framed cobordism===

Homotopy groups of spheres are closely related to cobordism classes of manifolds.
In 1938 Lev Pontryagin established an isomorphism between the homotopy group and the group of cobordism classes of differentiable -submanifolds of which are &quot;framed&quot;, i.e. have a trivialized normal bundle. Every map is homotopic to a differentiable map with a framed -dimensional submanifold. For example, is the cobordism group of framed 0-dimensional submanifolds of , computed by the algebraic sum of their points, corresponding to the degree of maps . The projection of the Hopf fibration represents a generator of which corresponds to the framed 1-dimensional submanifold of defined by the standard embedding with a nonstandard trivialization of the normal 2-plane bundle. Until the advent of more sophisticated algebraic methods in the early 1950s (Serre) the Pontrjagin isomorphism was the main tool for computing the homotopy groups of spheres. In 1954 the Pontrjagin isomorphism was generalized by René Thom to an isomorphism expressing other groups of cobordism classes (e.g. of all manifolds) as homotopy groups of spaces and spectra. In more recent work the argument is usually reversed, with cobordism groups computed in terms of homotopy groups.

===Finiteness and torsion===
In 1951, Jean-Pierre Serre showed that homotopy groups of spheres are all finite except for those of the form or (for positive ), when the group is the product of the infinite cyclic group with a finite abelian group. In particular the homotopy groups are determined by their -components for all primes . The 2-components are hardest to calculate, and in several ways behave differently from the -components for odd primes.

In the same paper, Serre found the first place that -torsion occurs in the homotopy groups of dimensional spheres, by showing that has no -torsion if , and has a unique subgroup of order if and . The case of 2-dimensional spheres is slightly different: the first -torsion occurs for . In the case of odd torsion there are more precise results; in this case there is a big difference between odd and even dimensional spheres. If is an odd prime and , then elements of the -component of have order at most . This is in some sense the best possible result, as these groups are known to have elements of this order for some values of . Furthermore, the stable range can be extended in this case: if is odd then the double suspension from to is an isomorphism of -components if , and an epimorphism if equality holds. The -torsion of the intermediate group can be strictly larger.

The results above about odd torsion only hold for odd-dimensional spheres: for even-dimensional spheres, the James fibration gives the torsion at odd primes in terms of that of odd-dimensional spheres,
:formula_14
(where means take the -component). This exact sequence is similar to the ones coming from the Hopf fibration; the difference is that it works for all even-dimensional spheres, albeit at the expense of ignoring 2-torsion. Combining the results for odd and even dimensional spheres shows that much of the odd torsion of unstable homotopy groups is determined by the odd torsion of the stable homotopy groups.

For stable homotopy groups there are more precise results about -torsion. For example, if for a prime then the -primary component of the stable homotopy group vanishes unless is divisible by , in which case it is cyclic of order .

===The J-homomorphism===
An important subgroup of , for , is the image of the J-homomorphism
, where denotes the special orthogonal group. In the stable range , the homotopy groups only depend on . This period 8 pattern is known as Bott periodicity, and it is reflected in the stable homotopy groups of spheres via the image of the -homomorphism which is:
* a cyclic group of order 2 if is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 8;
* trivial if is congruent to 2, 4, 5, or 6 modulo 8; and
* a cyclic group of order equal to the denominator of , where is a Bernoulli number, if .
This last case accounts for the elements of unusually large finite order in for such values of . For example, the stable groups have a cyclic subgroup of order 504, the denominator of .

The stable homotopy groups of spheres are the direct sum of the image of the -homomorphism, and the kernel of the Adams -invariant, a homomorphism from these groups to . Roughly speaking, the image of the -homomorphism is the subgroup of &quot;well understood&quot; or &quot;easy&quot; elements of the stable homotopy groups. These well understood elements account for most elements of the stable homotopy groups of spheres in small dimensions. The quotient of by the image of the -homomorphism is considered to be the &quot;hard&quot; part of the stable homotopy groups of spheres . (Adams also introduced certain order 2 elements of for , and these are also considered to be &quot;well understood&quot;.) Tables of homotopy groups of spheres sometimes omit the &quot;easy&quot; part to save space.

===Ring structure===

The direct sum
:formula_15
of the stable homotopy groups of spheres is a supercommutative graded ring, where multiplication is given by composition of representing maps, and any element of non-zero degree is nilpotent; the nilpotence theorem on complex cobordism implies Nishida&#x27;s theorem.

Example: If is the generator of (of order 2),
then is nonzero and generates , and is nonzero and 12 times a generator of , while is zero because the group is trivial.

If and and are elements of with and , there is a Toda bracket of these elements. The Toda bracket is not quite an element of a stable homotopy group, because it is only defined up to addition of products of certain other elements. Hiroshi Toda used the composition product and Toda brackets to label many of the elements of homotopy groups. There are also higher Toda brackets of several elements, defined when suitable lower Toda brackets vanish. This parallels the theory of Massey products in cohomology.
Every element of the stable homotopy groups of spheres can be expressed using composition products and higher Toda brackets in terms of certain well known elements, called Hopf elements.

==Computational methods==
If is any finite simplicial complex with finite fundamental group, in particular if is a sphere of dimension at least 2, then its homotopy groups are all finitely generated abelian groups. To compute these groups, they are often factored into their -components for each prime , and calculating each of these -groups separately. The first few homotopy groups of spheres can be computed using ad hoc variations of the ideas above; beyond this point, most methods for computing homotopy groups of spheres are based on spectral sequences. This is usually done by constructing suitable fibrations and taking the associated long exact sequences of homotopy groups; spectral sequences are a systematic way of organizing the complicated information that this process generates.

*&quot;The method of killing homotopy groups&quot;, due to involves repeatedly using the Hurewicz theorem to compute the first non-trivial homotopy group and then killing (eliminating) it with a fibration involving an Eilenberg–MacLane space. In principle this gives an effective algorithm for computing all homotopy groups of any finite simply connected simplicial complex, but in practice it is too cumbersome to use for computing anything other than the first few nontrivial homotopy groups as the simplicial complex becomes much more complicated every time one kills a homotopy group.
*The Serre spectral sequence was used by Serre to prove some of the results mentioned previously. He used the fact that taking the loop space of a well behaved space shifts all the homotopy groups down by 1, so the th homotopy group of a space is the first homotopy group of its ()-fold repeated loop space, which is equal to the first homology group of the ()-fold loop space by the Hurewicz theorem. This reduces the calculation of homotopy groups of to the calculation of homology groups of its repeated loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence relates the homology of a space to that of its loop space, so can sometimes be used to calculate the homology of loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence tends to have many non-zero differentials, which are hard to control, and too many ambiguities appear for higher homotopy groups. Consequently, it has been superseded by more powerful spectral sequences with fewer non-zero differentials, which give more information.
* The EHP spectral sequence can be used to compute many homotopy groups of spheres; it is based on some fibrations used by Toda in his calculations of homotopy groups.
* The classical Adams spectral sequence has term given by the Ext groups over the mod Steenrod algebra , and converges to something closely related to the -component of the stable homotopy groups. The initial terms of the Adams spectral sequence are themselves quite hard to compute: this is sometimes done using an auxiliary spectral sequence called the May spectral sequence.
*At the odd primes, the Adams–Novikov spectral sequence is a more powerful version of the Adams spectral sequence replacing ordinary cohomology mod with a generalized cohomology theory, such as complex cobordism or, more usually, a piece of it called Brown–Peterson cohomology. The initial term is again quite hard to calculate; to do this one can use the chromatic spectral sequence.
*A variation of this last approach uses a backwards version of the Adams–Novikov spectral sequence for Brown–Peterson cohomology: the limit is known, and the initial terms involve unknown stable homotopy groups of spheres that one is trying to find.

*The motivic Adams spectral sequence converges to the motivic stable homotopy groups of spheres. By comparing the motivic one over the complex numbers with the classical one, Isaksen gives rigorous proof of computations up to the 59-stem. In particular, Isaksen computes the Coker J of the 56-stem is 0, and therefore by the work of Kervaire-Milnor, the sphere has a unique smooth structure.

*The Kahn–Priddy map induces a map of Adams spectral sequences from the suspension spectrum of infinite real projective space to the sphere spectrum. It is surjective on the Adams page on positive stems. Wang and Xu develops a method using the Kahn–Priddy map to deduce Adams differentials for the sphere spectrum inductively. They give detailed argument for several Adams differentials and compute the 60 and 61-stem. A geometric corollary of their result is the sphere has a unique smooth structure, and it is the last odd dimensional one – the only ones are , , , and .

*The motivic cofiber of method is so far the most efficient method at the prime 2. The class is a map between motivic spheres. The Gheorghe–Wang–Xu theorem identifies the motivic Adams spectral sequence for the cofiber of as the algebraic Novikov spectral sequence for , which allows one to deduce motivic Adams differentials for the cofiber of from purely algebraic data. One can then pullback these motivic Adams differentials to the motivic sphere, and then use the Betti realization functor to push forward them to the classical sphere. Using this method, computes up to the 90-stem.

The computation of the homotopy groups of has been reduced to a combinatorial group theory question. identify these homotopy groups as certain quotients of the Brunnian braid groups of . Under this correspondence, every nontrivial element in for may be represented by a Brunnian braid over that is not Brunnian over the disk . For example, the Hopf map corresponds to the Borromean rings.

==Applications==

* The winding number (corresponding to an integer of can be used to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra, which states that every non-constant complex polynomial has a zero.
* The fact that implies the Brouwer fixed point theorem that every continuous map from the -dimensional ball to itself has a fixed point.
* The stable homotopy groups of spheres are important in singularity theory, which studies the structure of singular points of smooth maps or algebraic varieties. Such singularities arise as critical points of smooth maps from to . The geometry near a critical point of such a map can be described by an element of , by considering the way in which a small sphere around the critical point maps into a topological sphere around the critical value.
* The fact that the third stable homotopy group of spheres is cyclic of order 24, first proved by Vladimir Rokhlin, implies Rokhlin&#x27;s theorem that the signature of a compact smooth spin 4-manifold is divisible by 16.
* Stable homotopy groups of spheres are used to describe the group of h-cobordism classes of oriented homotopy -spheres (for , this is the group of smooth structures on -spheres, up to orientation-preserving diffeomorphism; the non-trivial elements of this group are represented by exotic spheres). More precisely, there is an injective map
::formula_16
:where is the cyclic subgroup represented by homotopy spheres that bound a parallelizable manifold, is the th stable homotopy group of spheres, and is the image of the -homomorphism. This is an isomorphism unless is of the form , in which case the image has index 1 or 2.
* The groups above, and therefore the stable homotopy groups of spheres, are used in the classification of possible smooth structures on a topological or piecewise linear manifold.
* The Kervaire invariant problem, about the existence of manifolds of Kervaire invariant 1 in dimensions can be reduced to a question about stable homotopy groups of spheres. For example, knowledge of stable homotopy groups of degree up to 48 has been used to settle the Kervaire invariant problem in dimension . (This was the smallest value of for which the question was open at the time.)
* The Barratt–Priddy theorem says that the stable homotopy groups of the spheres can be expressed in terms of the plus construction applied to the classifying space of the symmetric group, leading to an identification of K-theory of the field with one element with stable homotopy groups.

==Table of homotopy groups==
Tables of homotopy groups of spheres are most conveniently organized by showing .

The following table shows many of the groups . The stable homotopy groups are highlighted in blue, the unstable ones in red. Each homotopy group is the product of the cyclic groups of the orders given in the table, using the following conventions:
* The entry &quot;⋅&quot; denotes the trivial group.
* Where the entry is an integer, , the homotopy group is the cyclic group of that order (generally written ).
* Where the entry is ∞, the homotopy group is the infinite cyclic group, .
* Where entry is a product, the homotopy group is the cartesian product (equivalently, direct sum) of the cyclic groups of those orders. Powers indicate repeated products. (Note that when and have no common factor, is isomorphic to .)

Example: , which is denoted by in the table.


==Table of stable homotopy groups==
The stable homotopy groups are the products of cyclic groups of the infinite or prime power orders shown in the table. (For largely historical reasons, stable homotopy groups are usually given as products of cyclic groups of prime power order, while tables of unstable homotopy groups often give them as products of the smallest number of cyclic groups.) For , the part of the -component that is accounted for by the -homomorphism is cyclic of order if divides and 0 otherwise. The mod 8 behavior of the table comes from Bott periodicity via the J-homomorphism, whose image is underlined.

<text>Stefaan Maria Joris Yolanda De Clerck (; born 12 December 1951) is a Belgian politician and former Minister of Justice of Belgium. He was Minister of Justice from 1995 until 1998 as well, when he resigned following the escape from prison of Marc Dutroux. He has served as chairman of Christian Democratic and Flemish party and held a seat in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives. De Clerck was mayor of Kortrijk.

Regarding re-instituting the death penalty in Belgium after the &quot;Joker&quot; murders of 2009, &quot;GlobalPost&quot; quotes De Clerck as saying: &quot;That is not something for our times. It&#x27;s not by killing somebody that we solve society&#x27;s problems, just look at the United States.&quot;

<doc id="1104700" wikidata="Q1355042" url="?curid=1104700" title="Senate (Belgium)">
<text>The Senate ( ; ; ) is one of the two chambers of the bicameral Federal Parliament of Belgium, the other being the Chamber of Representatives. It is considered to be the &quot;upper house&quot; of the Federal Parliament.

Created in 1831 as a chamber fully equal to the Chamber of Representatives, the Senate has undergone several reforms in the past, most notably in 1993 and 2014. The 2014 elections were the first without a direct election of senators. Instead, the new Senate is composed of members of community and regional parliaments and co-opted members. It is a chamber of the communities and regions and serves as a platform for discussion and reflection about matters between these federated entities. The Senate today plays a minor role in the federal legislative process. However, the Senate, together with the Chamber, has full competence for the Constitution and legislation on the organization and functioning of the Federal State and the federated entities. Since the reform of 2014, it holds about ten plenary sessions a year.

==History==
After the Belgian Revolution of 1830, the National Congress decided on the Belgian Constitution and the state structure. Belgium would become a unitary state. A bicameral Parliament was chosen over a unicameral one. The Senate was seen as a more conservative and elite body that served as a counterweight to the more progressive Chamber of representatives. Senators were directly elected, but only those who paid ground taxes were eligible. Only men who paid taxes were allowed to vote. There was also the possibility for the heir to the throne to become senator by right.

In 1893 the principal of universal multiple voting right was introduced for men. This was combined with the principle of compulsory voting and the principle of proportional representation. For the Senate, candidates still needed to pay ground taxes, but the threshold was lowered. Moreover, a new category of provincial senators was introduced.

After World War I, the single vote system - &quot;one man, one vote&quot; - was introduced. This principle of universal suffrage was only applicable to men, women had no right to vote. They however could be a candidate in elections.

1921 saw a new reform for the Senate. The prerequisite of taxes was abolished and 4 categories of senators were created: directly elected senators, provincial senators, co-opted senators and senators by right.

In 1936, Maria Baers and became the first women senators. After World War II, women received the same rights as men as far as voting was concerned.

The post-World War era saw a series of six Belgian state reforms from 1970 until 2014. In 1993, the competences of the Senate were redefined during the fourth State Reform. In 2014, during the sixth State Reform, the Senate transformed in the assembly it is today, with important reforms concerning composition and competences.

==Composition==
===Overview===
===Current categories of senators===
Since the sixth state reform of 2014, the Senate consists of 60 members. 50 are elected by the parliaments of the federated entities, and 10 are co-opted members.

====Senators of the federated entities====

Starting with the elections of 25 May 2014, 50 senators are appointed by and from the parliaments of the federated entities:
* 29 senators appointed by the Flemish Parliament from the Flemish Parliament or from the Dutch language group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region
* 10 senators appointed by and from the Parliament of the French Community (which itself is composed of all members of the Parliament of Wallonia and several members of the French language group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region)
* 8 senators appointed by and from the Parliament of Wallonia
* 2 senators appointed by and from the French-language group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region
* 1 senator appointed by and from the Parliament of the German-speaking Community

Whereas the German-speaking senator is chosen by plurality of votes in the Parliament of the German-speaking community, the seats of the senators of the federated entities are distributed proportionally between parties based on the results for the latest election for the federated entities, i.e. the Flemish Parliament, the Parliament of Wallonia and the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region (regional level).
====Co-opted senators====

Ten senators are co-opted, meaning they are elected by their peers: six by the Dutch-language group of the Senate and four by the French-language group of the Senate. These seats are distributed proportionally between parties based on the results of the latest direct election of the Chamber of Representatives (federal level).

In 1921, the co-opted members were included in the Constitution as a new category of senators. It was intended to allow the senators to elect a number of experts or members of representative organizations to join them to enhance the quality of debate and legislation; however, political parties sometimes use it as a means of rewarding loyal members that were not elected.

===Former categories of senators===
Prior to the Belgian federal election of May 21, 1995, there were 184 senators, the largest part of which were directly elected, some appointed by the Provincial Councils and others co-opted.

The fourth state reform, which took place in 1993, revised the Belgian Constitution, reduced the number of senators to 71. The change took effect following the May 21, 1995, federal election.

====Directly elected senators====

Until the elections of 25 May 2014, the Senate contained 40 directly elected members. To elect these members, the electorate was divided into two electoral colleges: a Dutch and a French electoral college. Unlike for European Parliament elections, there was no German-speaking electoral college. Instead, the members of the German-speaking Community were a part of the French electoral college. Even though there were two electoral colleges, there were three constituencies for Senate elections: a Flemish constituency, a Walloon constituency and the constituency of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde, which comprised the Brussels-Capital Region and the surrounding part of the Flemish Region. The constituency of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde ceased to exist following the 2014 sixth State Reform.

The voters in the Flemish constituency belonged to the Dutch electoral college and the voters in the Walloon constituency (which also includes the people living in the German-speaking Community) belonged to the French electoral college, whereas the voters in Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde could choose for which electoral college they wanted to vote: they had the lists of both electoral colleges on one ballot. In each electoral college, the seats were divided by proportional representation, using the D&#x27;Hondt method.

Of the total of 40 directly elected senators, 25 were elected by the Dutch electoral college and 15 by the French electoral college. These numbers were in the Belgian Constitution and roughly reflect the ratio of Dutch-speakers to French-speakers by population. The directly elected senators were always elected on the same day as the members of the Chamber of Representatives, for a term of 4 years, except if the Chambers were dissolved earlier. The last federal election that had directly elected senators took place on Sunday June 13, 2010.

====Provincial senators====
Between 1894 and 1991, a number of senators were elected by each provincial council of the nine provinces. The number was dependent on a province&#x27;s population, and increased along with the increase in a province&#x27;s population.

====Senators by right====

Before the sixth state reform, the children of the King, older than 18, or if there were none, the Belgian descendants of the main branch of the royal house, were entitled to be senators by right by taking the oath of office. Senators by right over the age of 21 were in theory entitled to vote, but in practice they did not cast their vote. They were not taken into account for the required quorum for voting.

Until Prince Philippe became King in July 2013, there were three senators by right (Prince Philippe, Princess Astrid and Prince Laurent). When the function of senators by right was abolished in 2014 as part of the sixth state reform, there were no senators by right, as King Philippe&#x27;s children were all under the age of 18.

==Qualifications==
Article 69 of the Belgian Constitution sets forth four qualifications for senators: each senator must be at least 18 years old, must possess the Belgian nationality, must have the full enjoyment of civil and political rights, and must be resident in Belgium. Originally, the minimum age to be elected senator was 40; this was reduced to 21 in 1993 and eventually to 18 in 2014. A senator can only enter into office after having taken the constitutional oath, in either of the three official languages in Belgium: Dutch, French or German. They may also choose to take the oath in more than one language. The oath is as follows: &quot;I swear to observe the Constitution&quot;. (, , )

Certain offices are incompatible with the office of senator. A member of the Senate may not be a member of the Chamber of Representatives at the same time and representatives must give up their seats in the Chamber of Representatives in order to join the Senate.

Another important incompatibility is based on the separation of powers. A senator who is appointed as a minister ceases to sit in the Senate and is replaced for as long as he is a minister. However, if he resigns as a minister, he may return to the Senate, in accordance with Article 50 of the Belgian Constitution. A senator cannot also be a civil servant or a member of the judiciary at the same time. However, a civil servant who is elected to the Senate is entitled to political leave and does not have to resign as a civil servant. It is also not possible to be a member of the Federal Parliament and a Member of the European Parliament at the same time.

==Language groups==
With the exception of the senator appointed by the Parliament of the German-speaking Community, all senators are divided into two language groups: a Dutch language group and a French language group. The Dutch language group consists of members appointed by the Flemish Parliament, members appointed by the Dutch language group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region, and the members co-opted by the two aforementioned groups. The French language group consists of members appointed by the Parliament of the French Community, members appointed by the Parliament of Wallonia, members appointed by the French language group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region, and the members co-opted by the three aforementioned groups. There are 35 senators in the Dutch language group, 24 in the French language group, and one in the German language group.

== Brussels ==
Article 67 of the Belgian Constitution determines that at least one of the senators in the Dutch language group must be resident in the Brussels-Capital Region on the date of their election, as well as six of the senators in the French language group.

==Officers==
The president of the Senate is elected by the Senate at the beginning of each parliamentary term. The president is assisted by two vice presidents, who are also elected at the beginning of each parliamentary term. The president of the Senate is usually a member of a party of the majority with a great deal of political experience, while the first vice president is a member of the other language group.

The current president of the Belgian Senate is Stephanie D&#x27;Hose of the Open VLD.

The president of the Senate presides over the plenary assembly of the Senate, manages and controls debates in the assembly, is responsible for ensuring the democratic functioning of the Senate, maintains order and security in the assembly and enforces the rules of the Senate. The president represents the Senate at both the national (to the other institutions) and the international level. Additionally, the president chairs the Bureau, which determines the order of business, supervises the administrative services of the Senate, and leads the Senate&#x27;s activities.

The president of the Senate, together with the president of the Chamber of Representatives, ranks immediately behind the King in the order of precedence. The elder of the two takes the second place in the order of precedence.

The Bureau of the Senate is composed of the president, the two vice presidents, and the leaders of the political groups that are represented in the standing committees. The Bureau leads the day-to-day activities of the Senate and convenes every two weeks in order to manage the work of the Senate. The Bureau determines the legislative agenda and the order of business in the plenary assembly and the committees, and manages the internal affairs of the Senate. A member of the Federal Government is usually invited to attend the discussions about the legislative agenda. The Bureau also assists the président in the conduct of parliamentary business. In addition, the Bureau also appoints, promotes, and dismisses the staff of the Senate.

The Senate is served by a number of civil servants. The Senate&#x27;s chief administrative officer is the secretary-general of the Senate, who is appointed by the assembly and heads the Senate&#x27;s legislative services. He is assisted by the director-general who heads the administrative services and replaces the secretary-general in his absence.

==Competences==

The Senate mainly has the following tasks:

Legislation: The Senate, together with the Chamber, has full competence for the Constitution and legislation on the organization and functioning of the Federal State and the federated entities. Depending on the type of law, different procedures are possible that require, among others, special majorities (i.e. a two-thirds majority in the Senate, combined with a majority in each language group).

Information reports: The Senate may draw up information reports, in particular concerning topics that are governed by rules and regulations of different state levels.

Conflicts of interest: Within the logic of federalism, the Senate mediates in possible conflicts of interest between the different parliaments of the country.

International parliamentary organizations: The Senate sends parliamentary delegations to different interparliamentary conferences and organizations. Through their representatives in the Senate, the federated entities have access to this interparliamentary cooperation.

Subsidiarity: Following the EU Treaties, the Senate has the right as chamber of the federal parliament to ensure that the European Union does not take an initiative on an issue that is better dealt with at another level. This is the so-called early warning mechanism concerning subsidiarity.

Appointments to courts: The Senate participates in a number of appointments to high courts (Constitutional Court, Council of State, High Council of Justice).

==Committees==

Before a dossier or topic for debate is dealt with in plenary, it is prepared in one of the committees of the Senate. In addition to the standing committees, the Senate can set up special committees, working groups, advisory committees or joint committees (together with the Chamber). A standing committee consists of 20 senators. The political strength of the committees reflects the strength of the political groups in the plenary session.

The Senate had three standing committees:

* Institutional Affairs Committee: deals mainly with issues related to the Constitution and the legislation on the organization and functioning of the Federal State and the federated entities.
* Transversal Affairs Committee: deals mainly with issues that are governed by rules and regulations of different state levels.
* Committee for Democratic Renewal and Citizenship.

The Senate also has an Equal Opportunities Advisory Committee that focuses on equality between women and men.

The Senate and the Chamber of Representatives have established three joint committees:

* Federal Advisory Committee on EU Affairs
* Parliamentary Committee for Law Evaluation
* Parliamentary Concertation Committee: this committee deals with all issues relating to the legislative processes where both the Senate and the Chamber are involved in.

== Non-permanent body ==
Given its limited legislative power, since the reform of 2014, the Senate holds about ten plenary sessions a year. The standing committees of the Senate, however, determine their own meeting schedule.

==Current composition==

This is the composition of the Senate following the federal and regional elections of June 9, 2024.

<text>Many programming language type systems support subtyping. For instance, if the type is a subtype of , then an expression of type should be substitutable wherever an expression of type is used.

Variance is how subtyping between more complex types relates to subtyping between their components. For example, how should a list of s relate to a list of s? Or how should a function that returns relate to a function that returns ?

Depending on the variance of the type constructor, the subtyping relation of the simple types may be either preserved, reversed, or ignored for the respective complex types. In the OCaml programming language, for example, &quot;list of Cat&quot; is a subtype of &quot;list of Animal&quot; because the list type constructor is covariant. This means that the subtyping relation of the simple types is preserved for the complex types.

On the other hand, &quot;function from Animal to String&quot; is a subtype of &quot;function from Cat to String&quot; because the function type constructor is contravariant in the parameter type. Here, the subtyping relation of the simple types is reversed for the complex types.

A programming language designer will consider variance when devising typing rules for language features such as arrays, inheritance, and generic datatypes. By making type constructors covariant or contravariant instead of invariant, more programs will be accepted as well-typed. On the other hand, programmers often find contravariance unintuitive, and accurately tracking variance to avoid runtime type errors can lead to complex typing rules.

In order to keep the type system simple and allow useful programs, a language may treat a type constructor as invariant even if it would be safe to consider it variant, or treat it as covariant even though that could violate type safety.

== Formal definition ==

Suppose codice_1 and codice_2 are types, and codice_3 denotes application of a type constructor codice_3 with type argument codice_5.
Within the type system of a programming language, a typing rule for a type constructor codice_3 is:
* &quot;covariant&quot; if it preserves the ordering of types (≤), which orders types from more specific to more generic: If codice_7, then codice_8; 
* &quot;contravariant&quot; if it reverses this ordering: If codice_7, then codice_10;
* &quot;bivariant&quot; if both of these apply (i.e., if codice_7, then codice_12);
* &quot;variant&quot; if covariant, contravariant or bivariant;
* &quot;invariant&quot; or &quot;nonvariant&quot; if not variant.

The article considers how this applies to some common type constructors.

=== C# examples ===
For example, in C#, if is a subtype of , then:
* is a subtype of . The subtyping is preserved because is covariant on .
* is a subtype of . The subtyping is reversed because is contravariant on .
* Neither nor is a subtype of the other, because is invariant on .
The variance of a C# generic interface is declared by placing the (covariant) or (contravariant) attribute on (zero or more of) its type parameters. The above interfaces are declared as , , and . Types with more than one type parameter may specify different variances on each type parameter. For example, the delegate type represents a function with a contravariant input parameter of type and a covariant return value of type . The compiler checks that all types are defined and used consistently with their annotations, and otherwise signals a compilation error.

The typing rules for interface variance ensure type safety. For example, an represents a first-class function expecting an argument of type , and a function that can handle any type of animal can always be used instead of one that can only handle cats.

== Arrays ==
Read-only data types (sources) can be covariant; write-only data types (sinks) can be contravariant. Mutable data types which act as both sources and sinks should be invariant. To illustrate this general phenomenon, consider the array type. For the type we can make the type , which is an &quot;array of animals&quot;. For the purposes of this example, this array supports both reading and writing elements.

We have the option to treat this as either:
* covariant: a is an ;
* contravariant: an is a ;
* invariant: an is not a and a is not an .

If we wish to avoid type errors, then only the third choice is safe. Clearly, not every can be treated as if it were a , since a client reading from the array will expect a , but an may contain e.g. a . So, the contravariant rule is not safe.

Conversely, a cannot be treated as an . It should always be possible to put a into an . With covariant arrays this cannot be guaranteed to be safe, since the backing store might actually be an array of cats. So, the covariant rule is also not safe—the array constructor should be &quot;invariant&quot;. Note that this is only an issue for mutable arrays; the covariant rule is safe for immutable (read-only) arrays. Likewise, the contravariant rule would be safe for write-only arrays.

=== Covariant arrays in Java and C# ===
Early versions of Java and C# did not include generics, also termed parametric polymorphism. In such a setting, making arrays invariant rules out useful polymorphic programs.

For example, consider writing a function to shuffle an array, or a function that tests two arrays for equality using the . method on the elements. The implementation does not depend on the exact type of element stored in the array, so it should be possible to write a single function that works on all types of arrays. It is easy to implement functions of type:
boolean equalArrays(Object[] a1, Object[] a2);
void shuffleArray(Object[] a);
However, if array types were treated as invariant, it would only be possible to call these functions on an array of exactly the type . One could not, for example, shuffle an array of strings.

Therefore, both Java and C# treat array types covariantly.
For instance, in Java is a subtype of , and in C# is a subtype of .

As discussed above, covariant arrays lead to problems with writes into the array. Java and C# deal with this by marking each array object with a type when it is created. Each time a value is stored into an array, the execution environment will check that the run-time type of the value is equal to the run-time type of the array. If there is a mismatch, an (Java) or (C#) is thrown:
// a is a single-element array of String
String[] a = new String[1];

// b is an array of Object
Object[] b = a;

// Assign an Integer to b. This would be possible if b really were
// an array of Object, but since it really is an array of String,
// we will get a java.lang.ArrayStoreException.
b[0] = 1;
In the above example, one can &quot;read&quot; from the array (b) safely. It is only trying to &quot;write&quot; to the array that can lead to trouble.

One drawback to this approach is that it leaves the possibility of a run-time error that a stricter type system could have caught at compile-time. Also, it hurts performance because each write into an array requires an additional run-time check.

With the addition of generics, Java and C# now offer ways to write this kind of polymorphic function without relying on covariance. The array comparison and shuffling functions can be given the parameterized types
&lt;T&gt; boolean equalArrays(T[] a1, T[] a2);
&lt;T&gt; void shuffleArray(T[] a);
Alternatively, to enforce that a C# method accesses a collection in a read-only way, one can use the interface instead of passing it an array .

== Function types ==
Languages with first-class functions have function types like &quot;a function expecting a Cat and returning an Animal&quot; (written in OCaml syntax or in C# syntax).

Those languages also need to specify when one function type is a subtype of another—that is, when it is safe to use a function of one type in a context that expects a function of a different type. 
It is safe to substitute a function &quot;f&quot; for a function &quot;g&quot; if &quot;f&quot; accepts a more general type of argument and returns a more specific type than &quot;g&quot;. For example, functions of type , , and can be used wherever a was expected. (One can compare this to the robustness principle of communication: &quot;be liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you produce.&quot;) The general rule is:

:formula_1 if formula_2 and formula_3. 

Using inference rule notation the same rule can be written as:

:formula_4

In other words, the → type constructor is &quot;contravariant in the parameter (input) type&quot; and &quot;covariant in the return (output) type&quot;. This rule was first stated formally by John C. Reynolds, and further popularized in a paper by Luca Cardelli.

When dealing with functions that take functions as arguments, this rule can be applied several times. For example, by applying the rule twice, we see that formula_5 if formula_6. In other words, the type formula_7 is &quot;covariant&quot; in the position of formula_8. For complicated types it can be confusing to mentally trace why a given type specialization is or isn&#x27;t type-safe, but it is easy to calculate which positions are co- and contravariant: a position is covariant if it is on the left side of an even number of arrows applying to it.

== Inheritance in object-oriented languages ==
When a subclass overrides a method in a superclass, the compiler must check that the overriding method has the right type. While some languages require that the type exactly matches the type in the superclass (invariance), it is also type safe to allow the overriding method to have a &quot;better&quot; type. By the usual subtyping rule for function types, this means that the overriding method should return a more specific type (return type covariance) and accept a more general argument (parameter type contravariance). In UML notation, the possibilities are as follows (where Class B is the subclass that extends Class A which is the superclass):

For a concrete example, suppose we are writing a class to model an animal shelter. We assume that is a subclass of , and that we have a base class (using Java syntax)

class AnimalShelter {

 Animal getAnimalForAdoption() {
 }
 void putAnimal(Animal animal) {
 }


Now the question is: if we subclass , what types are we allowed to give to and ?

=== Covariant method return type ===
In a language which allows covariant return types, a derived class can override the method to return a more specific type:

class CatShelter extends AnimalShelter {

 Cat getAnimalForAdoption() {
 return new Cat();
}
Among mainstream OO languages, Java, C++ and C# (as of version 9.0 ) support covariant return types. Adding the covariant return type was one of the first modifications of the C++ language approved by the standards committee in 1998. Scala and D also support covariant return types.

=== Contravariant method parameter type ===
Similarly, it is type safe to allow an overriding method to accept a more general argument than the method in the base class:

class CatShelter extends AnimalShelter {
 void putAnimal(Object animal) {
 }


Only a few object-oriented languages actually allow this (for example, Python when typechecked with mypy). C++, Java and most other languages that support overloading and/or shadowing would interpret this as a method with an overloaded or shadowed name.

However, Sather supported both covariance and contravariance. Calling convention for overridden methods are covariant with &quot;out&quot; parameters and return values, and contravariant with normal parameters (with the mode &quot;in&quot;).

=== Covariant method parameter type ===
A couple of mainstream languages, Eiffel and Dart allow the parameters of an overriding method to have a &quot;more&quot; specific type than the method in the superclass (parameter type covariance). Thus, the following Dart code would type check, with overriding the method in the base class:

class CatShelter extends AnimalShelter {

 void putAnimal(covariant Cat animal) {
 }


This is not type safe. By up-casting a to an , one can try to place a dog in a cat shelter. That does not meet parameter restrictions and will result in a runtime error. The lack of type safety (known as the &quot;catcall problem&quot; in the Eiffel community, where &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;CAT&quot; is a Changed Availability or Type) has been a long-standing issue. Over the years, various combinations of global static analysis, local static analysis, and new language features have been proposed to remedy it, and these have been implemented in some Eiffel compilers.

Despite the type safety problem, the Eiffel designers consider covariant parameter types crucial for modeling real world requirements. The cat shelter illustrates a common phenomenon: it is &quot;a kind of&quot; animal shelter but has &quot;additional restrictions&quot;, and it seems reasonable to use inheritance and restricted parameter types to model this. In proposing this use of inheritance, the Eiffel designers reject the Liskov substitution principle, which states that objects of subclasses should always be less restricted than objects of their superclass.

One other instance of a mainstream language allowing covariance in method parameters is PHP in regards to class constructors. In the following example, the __construct() method is accepted, despite the method parameter being covariant to the parent&#x27;s method parameter. Were this method anything other than __construct(), an error would occur:
interface AnimalInterface {}
interface DogInterface extends AnimalInterface {}
class Dog implements DogInterface {}
class Pet
 public function __construct(AnimalInterface $animal) {}


class PetDog extends Pet
 public function __construct(DogInterface $dog)
 parent::__construct($dog);
}
Another example where covariant parameters seem helpful is so-called binary methods, i.e. methods where the parameter is expected to be of the same type as the object the method is called on. An example is the method: checks whether comes before or after in some ordering, but the way to compare, say, two rational numbers will be different from the way to compare two strings. Other common examples of binary methods include equality tests, arithmetic operations, and set operations like subset and union.

In older versions of Java, the comparison method was specified as an interface :
interface Comparable {

 int compareTo(Object o);


The drawback of this is that the method is specified to take an argument of type . A typical implementation would first down-cast this argument (throwing an error if it is not of the expected type):
class RationalNumber implements Comparable {
 int numerator;
 int denominator;
 
 public int compareTo(Object other) {
 RationalNumber otherNum = (RationalNumber)other;
 return Integer.compare(numerator * otherNum.denominator,
 otherNum.numerator * denominator);
}
In a language with covariant parameters, the argument to could be directly given the desired type , hiding the typecast. (Of course, this would still give a runtime error if was then called on e.g. a .)

=== Avoiding the need for covariant parameter types ===
Other language features can provide the apparent benefits of covariant parameters while preserving Liskov substitutability.

In a language with &quot;generics&quot; (a.k.a. parametric polymorphism) and bounded quantification, the previous examples can be written in a type-safe way. Instead of defining , we define a parameterized class . (One drawback of this is that the implementer of the base class needs to foresee which types will need to be specialized in the subclasses.)
class Shelter&lt;T extends Animal&gt; {

 T getAnimalForAdoption() {
 }

 void putAnimal(T animal) {
 }

class CatShelter extends Shelter&lt;Cat&gt; {

 Cat getAnimalForAdoption() {
 }

 void putAnimal(Cat animal) {
 }


Similarly, in recent versions of Java the interface has been parameterized, which allows the downcast to be omitted in a type-safe way:
class RationalNumber implements Comparable&lt;RationalNumber&gt; {

 int numerator;
 int denominator;
 
 public int compareTo(RationalNumber otherNum) {
 return Integer.compare(numerator * otherNum.denominator, 
 otherNum.numerator * denominator);
}
Another language feature that can help is &quot;multiple dispatch&quot;. One reason that binary methods are awkward to write is that in a call like , selecting the correct implementation of really depends on the runtime type of both and , but in a conventional OO language only the runtime type of is taken into account. In a language with Common Lisp Object System (CLOS)-style multiple dispatch, the comparison method could be written as a generic function where both arguments are used for method selection.

Giuseppe Castagna observed that in a typed language with multiple dispatch, a generic function can have some parameters which control dispatch and some &quot;left-over&quot; parameters which do not. Because the method selection rule chooses the most specific applicable method, if a method overrides another method, then the overriding method will have more specific types for the controlling parameters. On the other hand, to ensure type safety the language still must require the left-over parameters to be at least as general. Using the previous terminology, types used for runtime method selection are covariant while types not used for runtime method selection of the method are contravariant. Conventional single-dispatch languages like Java also obey this rule: only one argument is used for method selection (the receiver object, passed along to a method as the hidden argument ), and indeed the type of is more specialized inside overriding methods than in the superclass.

Castagna suggests that examples where covariant parameter types are superior (particularly, binary methods) should be handled using multiple dispatch; which is naturally covariant.
However, most programming languages do not support multiple dispatch.

=== Summary of variance and inheritance ===

The following table summarizes the rules for overriding methods in the languages discussed above.

== Generic types ==
In programming languages that support generics (a.k.a. parametric polymorphism), the programmer can extend the type system with new constructors. For example, a C# interface like makes it possible to construct new types like or . The question then arises what the variance of these type constructors should be.

There are two main approaches. In languages with &quot;declaration-site variance annotations&quot; (e.g., C#), the programmer annotates the definition of a generic type with the intended variance of its type parameters. With &quot;use-site variance annotations&quot; (e.g., Java), the programmer instead annotates the places where a generic type is instantiated.

=== Declaration-site variance annotations ===
The most popular languages with declaration-site variance annotations are C# and Kotlin (using the keywords and ), and Scala and OCaml (using the keywords and ). C# only allows variance annotations for interface types, while Kotlin, Scala and OCaml allow them for both interface types and concrete data types.

==== Interfaces ====
In C#, each type parameter of a generic interface can be marked covariant (), contravariant (), or invariant (no annotation). For example, we can define an interface of read-only iterators, and declare it to be covariant (out) in its type parameter.
interface IEnumerator&lt;out T&gt;
 T Current { get; }
 bool MoveNext();


With this declaration, will be treated as covariant in its type parameter, e.g. is a subtype of .

The type checker enforces that each method declaration in an interface only mentions the type parameters in a way consistent with the / annotations. That is, a parameter that was declared covariant must not occur in any contravariant positions (where a position is contravariant if it occurs under an odd number of contravariant type constructors). The precise rule is that the return types of all methods in the interface must be &quot;valid covariantly&quot; and all the method parameter types must be &quot;valid contravariantly&quot;, where &quot;valid S-ly&quot; is defined as follows:
* Non-generic types (classes, structs, enums, etc.) are valid both co- and contravariantly.
* A type parameter is valid covariantly if it was not marked , and valid contravariantly if it was not marked .
* An array type is valid S-ly if is. (This is because C# has covariant arrays.)
* A generic type is valid S-ly if for each parameter , 
** Ai is valid S-ly, and the &quot;i&quot;th parameter to is declared covariant, or
** Ai is valid (not S)-ly, and the &quot;i&quot;th parameter to is declared contravariant, or
** Ai is valid both covariantly and contravariantly, and the &quot;i&quot;th parameter to is declared invariant.

As an example of how these rules apply, consider the interface. 

interface IList&lt;T&gt;
 void Insert(int index, T item);
 IEnumerator&lt;T&gt; GetEnumerator();

The parameter type of must be valid contravariantly, i.e. the type parameter must not be tagged . Similarly, the result type of must be valid covariantly, i.e. (since is a covariant interface) the type must be valid covariantly, i.e. the type parameter must not be tagged . This shows that the interface is not allowed to be marked either co- or contravariant.

In the common case of a generic data structure such as , these restrictions mean that an parameter can only be used for methods getting data out of the structure, and an parameter can only be used for methods putting data into the structure, hence the choice of keywords.

==== Data ====
C# allows variance annotations on the parameters of interfaces, but not the parameters of classes. Because fields in C# classes are always mutable, variantly parameterized classes in C# would not be very useful. But languages which emphasize immutable data can make good use of covariant data types. For example, in all of Scala, Kotlin and OCaml the immutable list type is covariant: List[Cat] is a subtype of List[Animal].

Scala&#x27;s rules for checking variance annotations are essentially the same as C#&#x27;s. However, there are some idioms that apply to immutable datastructures in particular. They are illustrated by the following (excerpt from the) definition of the List[A] class.
sealed abstract class List[+A] extends AbstractSeq[A] {
 def head: A
 def tail: List[A]

 /** Adds an element at the beginning of this list. */
 def ::[B &gt;: A] (x: B): List[B] =
 new scala.collection.immutable.::(x, this)
}
First, class members that have a variant type must be immutable. Here, head has the type A, which was declared covariant (+), and indeed head was declared as a method (def). Trying to declare it as a mutable field (var) would be rejected as type error.

Second, even if a data structure is immutable, it will often have methods where the parameter type occurs contravariantly. For example, consider the method :: which adds an element to the front of a list. (The implementation works by creating a new object of the similarly named &quot;class&quot; ::, the class of nonempty lists.) The most obvious type to give it would be
def :: (x: A): List[A]
However, this would be a type error, because the covariant parameter A appears in a contravariant position (as a function parameter). But there is a trick to get around this problem. We give :: a more general type, which allows adding an element of any type B 
as long as B is a supertype of A. Note that this relies on List being covariant, since 
this has type List[A] and we treat it as having type List[B]. At first glance it may not be obvious that the generalized type is sound, but if the programmer starts out with the simpler type declaration, the type errors will point out the place that needs to be generalized.

==== Inferring variance ====
It is possible to design a type system where the compiler automatically infers the best possible variance annotations for all datatype parameters. However, the analysis can get complex for several reasons. First, the analysis is nonlocal since the variance of an interface depends on the variance of all interfaces that mentions. Second, in order to get unique best solutions the type system must allow &quot;bivariant&quot; parameters (which are simultaneously co- and contravariant). And finally, the variance of type parameters should arguably be a deliberate choice by the designer of an interface, not something that just happens.

For these reasons most languages do very little variance inference. C# and Scala do not infer any variance annotations at all. OCaml can infer the variance of parameterized concrete datatypes, but the programmer must explicitly specify the variance of abstract types (interfaces).

For example, consider an OCaml datatype which wraps a function
type (&#x27;a, &#x27;b) t = T of (&#x27;a -&gt; &#x27;b) 
The compiler will automatically infer that is contravariant in the first parameter, and covariant in the second. The programmer can also provide explicit annotations, which the compiler will check are satisfied. Thus the following declaration is equivalent to the previous one:
type (-&#x27;a, +&#x27;b) t = T of (&#x27;a -&gt; &#x27;b) 
Explicit annotations in OCaml become useful when specifying interfaces. For example, the standard library interface for association tables include an annotation saying that the map type constructor is covariant in the result type.
module type S =
 sig
 type key
 type (+&#x27;a) t
 val empty: &#x27;a t
 val mem: key -&gt; &#x27;a t -&gt; bool
 end
This ensures that e.g. is a subtype of .

=== Use-site variance annotations (wildcards) ===
One drawback of the declaration-site approach is that many interface types must be made invariant. For example, we saw above that needed to be invariant, because it contained both and . In order to expose more variance, the API designer could provide additional interfaces which provide subsets of the available methods (e.g. an &quot;insert-only list&quot; which only provides ). However this quickly becomes unwieldy.

Use-site variance means the desired variance is indicated with an annotation at the specific site in the code where the type will be used. This gives users of a class more opportunities for subtyping without requiring the designer of the class to define multiple interfaces with different variance. Instead, at the point a generic type is instantiated to an actual parameterized type, the programmer can indicate that only a subset of its methods will be used. In effect, each definition of a generic class also makes available interfaces for the covariant and contravariant &quot;parts&quot; of that class.

Java provides use-site variance annotations through wildcards, a restricted form of bounded existential types. A parameterized type can be instantiated by a wildcard together with an upper or lower bound, e.g. or . An unbounded wildcard like is equivalent to . Such a type represents for some unknown type which satisfies the bound. For example, if has type , then the type checker will accept
Animal a = l.get(3);
because the type is known to be a subtype of , but
l.add(new Animal());
will be rejected as a type error since an is not necessarily an . In general, given some interface , a reference to an forbids using methods from the interface where occurs contravariantly in the type of the method. Conversely, if had type one could call but not .

While non-wildcard parameterized types in Java are invariant (e.g. there is no subtyping relationship between and ), wildcard types can be made more specific by specifying a tighter bound. For example, is a subtype of . This shows that wildcard types are &quot;covariant in their upper bounds&quot; (and also &quot;contravariant in their lower bounds&quot;). In total, given a wildcard type like , there are three ways to form a subtype: by specializing the class , by specifying a tighter bound , or by replacing the wildcard with a specific type (see figure).

By applying two of the above three forms of subtyping, it becomes possible to, for example, pass an argument of type to a method expecting a . This is the kind of expressiveness that results from covariant interface types. The type acts as an interface type containing only the covariant methods of , but the implementer of did not have to define it ahead of time.

In the common case of a generic data structure , covariant parameters are used for methods getting data out of the structure, and contravariant parameters for methods putting data into the structure. The mnemonic for Producer Extends, Consumer Super (PECS), from the book &quot;Effective Java&quot; by Joshua Bloch gives an easy way to remember when to use covariance and contravariance.

Wildcards are flexible, but there is a drawback. While use-site variance means that API designers need not consider variance of type parameters to interfaces, they must often instead use more complicated method signatures. A common example involves the interface. Suppose we want to write a function that finds the biggest element in a collection. The elements need to implement the method, so a first try might be
&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T» T max(Collection&lt;T&gt; coll);
However, this type is not general enough—one can find the max of a , but not a . The problem is that does not implement , but instead the (better) interface . In Java, unlike in C#, is not considered a subtype of . Instead the type of has to be modified:
&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;? super T» T max(Collection&lt;T&gt; coll);
The bounded wildcard conveys the information that calls only contravariant methods from the interface. This particular example is frustrating because &quot;all&quot; the methods in are contravariant, so that condition is trivially true. A declaration-site system could handle this example with less clutter by annotating only the definition of .

The method can be changed even further by using an upper bounded wildcard for the method parameter:

&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;? super T» T max(Collection&lt;? extends T&gt; coll);
=== Comparing declaration-site and use-site annotations ===
Use-site variance annotations provide additional flexibility, allowing more programs to type check. However, they have been criticized for the complexity they add to the language, leading to complicated type signatures and error messages.

One way to assess whether the extra flexibility is useful is to see if it is used in existing programs. A survey of a large set of Java libraries found that 39% of wildcard annotations could have been directly replaced by declaration-site annotations. Thus the remaining 61% is an indication of places where Java benefits from having the use-site system available.

In a declaration-site language, libraries must either expose less variance, or define more interfaces. For example, the Scala Collections library defines three separate interfaces for classes which employ covariance: a covariant base interface containing common methods, an invariant mutable version which adds side-effecting methods, and a covariant immutable version which may specialize the inherited implementations to exploit structural sharing. This design works well with declaration-site annotations, but the large number of interfaces carry a complexity cost for clients of the library. And modifying the library interface may not be an option—in particular, one goal when adding generics to Java was to maintain binary backwards compatibility.

On the other hand, Java wildcards are themselves complex. In a conference presentation Joshua Bloch criticized them as being too hard to understand and use, stating that when adding support for closures &quot;we simply cannot afford another &quot;wildcards&quot;&quot;. Early versions of Scala used use-site variance annotations but programmers found them difficult to use in practice, while declaration-site annotations were found to be very helpful when designing classes. Later versions of Scala added Java-style existential types and wildcards; however, according to Martin Odersky, if there were no need for interoperability with Java then these would probably not have been included.

Ross Tate argues that part of the complexity of Java wildcards is due to the decision to encode use-site variance using a form of existential types. The original proposals used special-purpose syntax for variance annotations, writing instead of Java&#x27;s more verbose .

Since wildcards are a form of existential types they can be used for more things than just variance. A type like (&quot;a list of unknown type&quot;) lets objects be passed to methods or stored in fields without exactly specifying their type parameters. This is particularly valuable for classes such as where most of the methods do not mention the type parameter.

However, type inference for existential types is a difficult problem. For the compiler implementer, Java wildcards raise issues with type checker termination, type argument inference, and ambiguous programs. In general it is undecidable whether a Java program using generics is well-typed or not, so any type checker will have to go into an infinite loop or time out for some programs. For the programmer, it leads to complicated type error messages. Java type checks wildcard types by replacing the wildcards with fresh type variables (so-called &quot;capture conversion&quot;). This can make error messages harder to read, because they refer to type variables that the programmer did not directly write. For example, trying to add a to a will give an error like

 method List.add (capture#1) is not applicable
 (actual argument Cat cannot be converted to capture#1 by method invocation conversion)
 where capture#1 is a fresh type-variable:
 capture#1 extends Animal from capture of ? extends Animal

Since both declaration-site and use-site annotations can be useful, some type systems provide both.

== Etymology ==
These terms come from the notion of covariant and contravariant functors in category theory. Consider the category formula_9 whose objects are types and whose morphisms represent the subtype relationship ≤. (This is an example of how any partially ordered set can be considered as a category.) Then for example the function type constructor takes two types &quot;p&quot; and &quot;r&quot; and creates a new type &quot;p&quot; → &quot;r&quot;; so it takes objects in formula_10 to objects in formula_9. By the subtyping rule for function types this operation reverses ≤ for the first parameter and preserves it for the second, so it is a contravariant functor in the first parameter and a covariant functor in the second.

<text>The Calvin cycle, light-independent reactions, bio synthetic phase, dark reactions, or photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle of photosynthesis is a series of chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and hydrogen-carrier compounds into glucose. The Calvin cycle is present in all photosynthetic eukaryotes and also many photosynthetic bacteria. In plants, these reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled region of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes. These reactions take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them. The Calvin cycle uses the chemical energy of ATP and the reducing power of NADPH from the light-dependent reactions to produce sugars for the plant to use. These substrates are used in a series of reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions to produce sugars in a step-wise process; there is no direct reaction that converts several molecules of to a sugar. There are three phases to the light-independent reactions, collectively called the Calvin cycle: carboxylation, reduction reactions, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration.

Though it is also called the &quot;dark reaction&quot;, the Calvin cycle does not occur in the dark or during nighttime. This is because the process requires NADPH, which is short-lived and comes from light-dependent reactions. In the dark, plants instead release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves to provide energy for the plant. The Calvin cycle thus happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis (C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation, and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM)); CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day to make this process work.

==Coupling to other metabolic pathways ==

The reactions of the Calvin cycle are closely coupled to the thylakoid electron transport chain, as the energy required to reduce the carbon dioxide is provided by NADPH produced during the light dependent reactions. The process of photorespiration, also known as C2 cycle, is also coupled to the Calvin cycle, as it results from an alternative reaction of the RuBisCO enzyme, and its final byproduct is another glyceraldehyde-3-P molecule.

==Calvin cycle==

The Calvin cycle, Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle, reductive pentose phosphate cycle (RPP cycle) or C3 cycle is a series of biochemical redox reactions that take place in the stroma of chloroplast in photosynthetic organisms. The cycle was discovered in 1950 by Melvin Calvin, James Bassham, and Andrew Benson at the University of California, Berkeley by using the radioactive isotope carbon-14.

Photosynthesis occurs in two stages in a cell. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecule ATP and the moderate-energy hydrogen carrier NADPH. The Calvin cycle uses these compounds to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic compounds that can be used by the organism (and by animals that feed on it). This set of reactions is also called &quot;carbon fixation&quot;. The key enzyme of the cycle is called RuBisCO. In the following biochemical equations, the chemical species (phosphates and carboxylic acids) exist in equilibria among their various ionized states as governed by the pH.

The enzymes in the Calvin cycle are functionally equivalent to most enzymes used in other metabolic pathways such as gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway, but the enzymes in the Calvin cycle are found in the chloroplast stroma instead of the cell cytosol, separating the reactions. They are activated in the light (which is why the name &quot;dark reaction&quot; is misleading), and also by products of the light-dependent reaction. These regulatory functions prevent the Calvin cycle from being respired to carbon dioxide. Energy (in the form of ATP) would be wasted in carrying out these reactions when they have no net productivity.

The sum of reactions in the Calvin cycle is the following:
:3 + 6 NADPH + 9 ATP + 5 → glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) + 6 NADP+ + 9 ADP + 8 Pi   (Pi = inorganic phosphate)
Hexose (six-carbon) sugars are not products of the Calvin cycle. Although many texts list a product of photosynthesis as , this is mainly for convenience to match the equation of aerobic respiration, where six-carbon sugars are oxidized in mitochondria. The carbohydrate products of the Calvin cycle are three-carbon sugar phosphate molecules, or &quot;triose phosphates&quot;, namely, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).

===Steps===
In the first stage of the Calvin cycle, a molecule is incorporated into one of two three-carbon molecules (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or G3P), where it uses up two molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADPH, which had been produced in the light-dependent stage. The three steps involved are:
# The enzyme RuBisCO catalyses the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, RuBP, a 5-carbon compound, by carbon dioxide (a total of 6 carbons) in a two-step reaction. The product of the first step is enediol-enzyme complex that can capture or . Thus, enediol-enzyme complex is the real carboxylase/oxygenase. The that is captured by enediol in second step produces an unstable six-carbon compound called 2-carboxy 3-keto 1,5-biphosphoribotol (CKABP) (or 3-keto-2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate) that immediately splits into 2 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (also written as 3-phosphoglyceric acid, PGA, 3PGA, or 3-PGA), a 3-carbon compound.
# The enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase catalyses the phosphorylation of 3-PGA by ATP (which was produced in the light-dependent stage). 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (glycerate-1,3-bisphosphate) and ADP are the products. (However, note that two 3-PGAs are produced for every that enters the cycle, so this step utilizes two ATP per fixed.)
# The enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyses the reduction of 1,3BPGA by NADPH (which is another product of the light-dependent stage). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (also called G3P, GP, TP, PGAL, GAP) is produced, and the NADPH itself is oxidized and becomes NADP+. Again, two NADPH are utilized per fixed.
The next stage in the Calvin cycle is to regenerate RuBP. Five G3P molecules produce three RuBP molecules, using up three molecules of ATP. Since each molecule produces two G3P molecules, three molecules produce six G3P molecules, of which five are used to regenerate RuBP, leaving a net gain of one G3P molecule per three molecules (as would be expected from the number of carbon atoms involved).
The regeneration stage can be broken down into a series of steps.
# Triose phosphate isomerase converts one of the G3P reversibly into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), also a 3-carbon molecule.
# Aldolase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase convert a G3P and a DHAP into fructose 6-phosphate (6C). A phosphate ion is lost into solution.
# Then fixation of another generates two more G3P.
# F6P has two carbons removed by transketolase, giving erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P). The two carbons on transketolase are added to a G3P, giving the ketose xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu5P).
# E4P and a DHAP (formed from one of the G3P from the second fixation) are converted into sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate (7C) by aldolase enzyme.
# Sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (one of only three enzymes of the Calvin cycle that are unique to plants) cleaves sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate into sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, releasing an inorganic phosphate ion into solution.
# Fixation of a third generates two more G3P. The ketose S7P has two carbons removed by transketolase, giving ribose-5-phosphate (R5P), and the two carbons remaining on transketolase are transferred to one of the G3P, giving another Xu5P. This leaves one G3P as the product of fixation of 3 , with generation of three pentoses that can be converted to Ru5P.
# R5P is converted into ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P, RuP) by phosphopentose isomerase. Xu5P is converted into RuP by phosphopentose epimerase.
# Finally, phosphoribulokinase (another plant-unique enzyme of the pathway) phosphorylates RuP into RuBP, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, completing the Calvin &quot;cycle&quot;. This requires the input of one ATP.

Thus, of six G3P produced, five are used to make three RuBP (5C) molecules (totaling 15 carbons), with only one G3P available for subsequent conversion to hexose. This requires nine ATP molecules and six NADPH molecules per three molecules. The equation of the overall Calvin cycle is shown diagrammatically below.
RuBisCO also reacts competitively with instead of in photorespiration. The rate of photorespiration is higher at high temperatures. Photorespiration turns RuBP into 3-PGA and 2-phosphoglycolate, a 2-carbon molecule that can be converted via glycolate and glyoxalate to glycine. Via the glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate, two glycines are converted into serine plus . Serine can be converted back to 3-phosphoglycerate. Thus, only 3 of 4 carbons from two phosphoglycolates can be converted back to 3-PGA. It can be seen that photorespiration has very negative consequences for the plant, because, rather than fixing , this process leads to loss of . C4 carbon fixation evolved to circumvent photorespiration, but can occur only in certain plants native to very warm or tropical climates—corn, for example. Furthermore, RuBisCOs catalyzing the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis generally exhibit an improved specificity for CO2 relative to O2, in order to minimize the oxygenation reaction. This improved specificity evolved after RuBisCO incorporated a new protein subunit.

===Products===
The immediate products of one turn of the Calvin cycle are 2 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) molecules, 3 ADP, and 2 NADP+. (ADP and NADP+ are not really &quot;products&quot;. They are regenerated and later used again in the light-dependent reactions). Each G3P molecule is composed of 3 carbons. For the Calvin cycle to continue, RuBP (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate) must be regenerated. So, 5 out of 6 carbons from the 2 G3P molecules are used for this purpose. Therefore, there is only 1 net carbon produced to play with for each turn. To create 1 surplus G3P requires 3 carbons, and therefore 3 turns of the Calvin cycle. To make one glucose molecule (which can be created from 2 G3P molecules) would require 6 turns of the Calvin cycle. Surplus G3P can also be used to form other carbohydrates such as starch, sucrose, and cellulose, depending on what the plant needs.

==Light-dependent regulation==

These reactions do not occur in the dark or at night. There is a light-dependent regulation of the cycle enzymes, as the third step requires NADPH.

There are two regulation systems at work when the cycle must be turned on or off: the thioredoxin/ferredoxin activation system, which activates some of the cycle enzymes; and the RuBisCo enzyme activation, active in the Calvin cycle, which involves its own activase.

The thioredoxin/ferredoxin system activates the enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-P phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, and ribulose-5-phosphatase kinase, which are key points of the process. This happens when light is available, as the ferredoxin protein is reduced in the photosystem I complex of the thylakoid electron chain when electrons are circulating through it. Ferredoxin then binds to and reduces the thioredoxin protein, which activates the cycle enzymes by severing a cystine bond found in all these enzymes. This is a dynamic process as the same bond is formed again by other proteins that deactivate the enzymes. The implications of this process are that the enzymes remain mostly activated by day and are deactivated in the dark when there is no more reduced ferredoxin available.

The enzyme RuBisCo has its own, more complex activation process. It requires that a specific lysine amino acid be carbamylated to activate the enzyme. This lysine binds to RuBP and leads to a non-functional state if left uncarbamylated. A specific activase enzyme, called RuBisCo activase, helps this carbamylation process by removing one proton from the lysine and making the binding of the carbon dioxide molecule possible. Even then the RuBisCo enzyme is not yet functional, as it needs a magnesium ion bound to the lysine to function. This magnesium ion is released from the thylakoid lumen when the inner pH drops due to the active pumping of protons from the electron flow. RuBisCo activase itself is activated by increased concentrations of ATP in the stroma caused by its phosphorylation.

<text>Strathfield is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of New South Wales. Since a by-election in 2022, it has been represented by Jason Yat-Sen Li of the Labor Party . It was first created in 1988 and derives its name from the suburb of the same name.

Strathfield is an urban electorate, covering 19 km² in area.

==Geography==
On its current boundaries, Strathfield takes in the suburbs of Belfield, Burwood Heights, Burwood, Croydon, Croydon Park, Enfield, Flemington, Homebush West, Strathfield, Strathfield South and parts of Ashbury, Ashfield, Campsie and Homebush.

==History==

Strathfield was created in 1988. While traditionally a marginal electorate, Strathfield tended to favour the Liberal Party in its earlier years. It was first won by Liberal Paul Zammit, who later went on to have a short-lived career as a Liberal member of the federal House of Representatives. Zammit later contested the federal seat as an independent on the issue of airports and air traffic over the area. Zammit was succeeded by Liberal Bruce MacCarthy, who was defeated after one term. His successor, Paul Whelan, was a prominent sitting minister in the Carr government who had shifted to Strathfield from the abolished seat of Ashfield, and subsequently served as Police Minister while the member for Strathfield. The seat has tended to lean towards ever since, with Whelan being succeeded by Virginia Judge. Judge lost the seat in 2011 to Liberal candidate Charles Casuscelli, but he was in turn defeated by Labor&#x27;s Jodi McKay in 2015.

<text>Contentius (died 510) was bishop of Bayeux from 480 until his death. He is a Catholic and Orthodox saint. His feast day is 19 January.
==Biography==
According to Father Elie, he was Bayeusain, and his hermitage was located at Blay, near Bayeux.

His great reputation for holiness brought him many visits from pilgrims who came to him for spiritual comfort.

However, the inhabitants managed to have him named bishop of Bayeux to succeed Saint Manvieu. In this function he fought against the idolatry that still existed in this country, as well as against the nobles who traded it.

He has been attributed several miracles, one of which, on the way to Sees, he made water from the ground to Athis-de-l&#x27;Orne to quench his companions.

He died in 513. First buried in the church of Saint-Exupére, he was transferred in 1162 to the Benedictine abbey of Fécamp. His relics were then transported to Argentan where they escaped the Huguenots in 1562. The translation of his right femur in the church of Saint-Contest was done in 1896 during a great ceremony.

A municipality of the Caen conurbation is called Saint-Contest and the town of Mayenne is called Contest.

<text>Martha Ivelisse Pesante Rodríguez (born March 4, 1972), known professionally as Ivy Queen, is a Puerto Rican rapper, singer and actress. She is considered one of the pioneers of the reggaeton genre, commonly referred to as the Queen of Reggaeton.

Ivy Queen began her career as a member of the otherwise all-male collective The Noise in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There, she performed her first song &quot;Somos Raperos Pero No Delincuentes&quot; &quot;(We are Rappers, Not Delinquents)&quot;. Ivy Queen went solo in 1996, and released her debut studio album &quot;En Mi Imperio (In My Empire)&quot; which was quickly picked up by Sony Discos for distribution in 1997.

She later released &quot;The Original Rude Girl&quot;, her second studio album for Sony label, which spawned the hit single &quot;In the Zone&quot;. However, Ivy Queen did not rise to fame until she moved to an independent record label to release her third studio album, &quot;Diva&quot; in 2003.

She is also the host of the Spotify original podcast &quot;Loud&quot;, where she talks about the history of reggaeton and features prominent Latin artists. The 10-episode podcast debuted August 4, 2021 on Spotify, with episodes released weekly on Wednesdays.

==Early life==
Ivy Queen was born in Añasco, Puerto Rico. When she was young, Queen&#x27;s parents moved to New York, where she was raised. She did not finish high school, reaching eleventh grade in the mainland United States, and studied music at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.

==Musical career==

===1995–99: The Noise, &quot;En Mi Imperio&quot; and &quot;The Original Rude Girl&quot;===
When she was 18, Ivy Queen moved to San Juan, where she met rapper and producer DJ Negro. In 1995, Queen joined an all-male Puerto Rican group called the Noise, at the invitation of DJ Negro. The group became part of the emerging reggaeton scene. DJ Negro began producing a series of CDs centered around the Noise. Ivy Queen made her first appearance on the fifth installment of the CD series on a track called &quot;Somos Raperos Pero No Delincuentes&quot;. She became tired of the violent and sexual themes often used in reggaeton, and wished to write about a wider variety of subjects.

DJ Negro convinced Queen to go solo, and in 1997 she recorded her first solo album, &quot;En Mi Imperio&quot;which featured the hit single &quot;Como Mujer&quot;for Sony Discos. In 1998, Queen launched her second album, &quot;The Original Rude Girl&quot;which featured Don Chezina, Alex D&#x27;Castro, and Domingo Quiñonesand worked with Wyclef Jean on her debut single &quot;In the Zone&quot;. The album is bilingual and features hip hop music, a departure from the reggaeton featured on her debut album. &quot;The Original Rude Girl&quot; was commercially unsuccessful but &quot;In The Zone&quot; charted at number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rhythmic Top 40.

In 1999, after a lack of commercial success with her first two studio albums, Sony dropped Queen and she took a break from her musical career. In 2001 and 2002, Queen&#x27;s music began appearing on reggaeton compilation albums, spawning hits like &quot;Quiero Bailar&quot; from &quot;The Majestic 2&quot; and &quot;Quiero Saber&quot; from &quot;Kilates&quot;. With songs like &quot;Quiero Bailar&quot;, Ivy Queen represented women &quot;In a movement that took off commercially [and dominantly was led by men] with aggressively lyrics and a &quot;doggiestyle perreo dance&quot;. Ivy Queen established herself as reggaeton&#x27;s no-nonsense female conscience. (Her anthem &quot;Quiero Baliar&quot; warned her dance partner not to misinterpret those moves.)&quot;. In 2003, Queen and her then-husband Gran Omar signed with independent, Miami-based label Real Music, established by Jorge Guadalupe and Anthony Pérez. They appeared on the label&#x27;s first album &quot;Jams Vol. 1&quot;. Queen frequently appeared and performed on the reggaeton television show &quot;The Roof&quot;, which featured urban music and lifestyle, and was produced by Pérez.

===1999–2004: &quot;Diva&quot; and &quot;Real&quot;===
In 2003, Ivy Queen released &quot;Diva&quot;, her third studio album. It spawned hit singles including &quot;Quiero Bailar&quot;. The album is considered to have been important for exposing reggaeton to a mainstream audience in 2004. After the success of the albumwhich was certified platinum by the RIAA, Ivy Queen released a platinum edition of &quot;Diva&quot; in 2004. The platinum edition was nominated for &quot;Reggaeton Album of the Year&quot; at the 2005 &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards. &quot;Quiero Bailar&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, became the first Spanish-language track to reach number one on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart of Miami&#x27;s WPOWan American radio station that does not usually play Spanish music.

Queen&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Real&quot;, was originally planned to be her first full-length English language album after she received contract offers from several record labelsincluding Sony. Queen said that it was a good opportunity to reach other markets, and in particular the competitive market of English rap. Sony&#x27;s offer to record an English-language album came after they noticed that her previous Sony albums were being heard in London, thanks to the success of &quot;Diva&quot;. The album included collaborations with artists including Fat Joe, La India, Héctor Delgado, and Getto &amp; Gastam. American hip-hop producer Swizz Beatz produced the track &quot;Soldados&quot;. The album was released on November 16, 2004, and spawneed the Top 10 single &quot;Dile&quot; which was nominated for &quot;Tropical Airplay Track of the Year, Female&quot;.

===2005–07: &quot;Flashback&quot; and &quot;Sentimiento&quot;===
In 2005, Ivy Queen partnered with José Guadalupeco-founder of Perfect Image Recordsto form the record label Filtro Musik. Later that year, Univision Records signed Filtro Musik to promote Ivy Queen&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Flashback&quot; (2005). This ensured that the album was positioned in Latin and mainstream accounts that would normally not carry Latin product. Queen&#x27;s first compilation album &quot;The Best of Ivy Queen&quot;, consisting of tracks from &quot;Diva&quot; and &quot;Real&quot;, was released the same year. On October 29, 2005, she released &quot;Flashback&quot;, which contained the singles &quot;Cuéntale&quot;, &quot;Libertad&quot;, and &quot;Te He Querido, Te He Llorado&quot;. At the 2006 &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards, &quot;Flashback&quot; was nominated for &quot;Reggaeton Album of the Year&quot; for a second consecutive year. The following year, Ivy Queen, and Gran Omar presented the reggaeton and hip hop compilation album &quot;Cosa Nostra: Hip Hop&quot;. She later appeared on the Spanish-language recording of the Star-Spangled Banner, &quot;Nuestro Himno&quot;. She then received the first Premio Juventud &quot;Diva Award&quot;, which honored Queen for her musical career.

In April 2007, Ivy Queen released her sixth studio album entitled &quot;Sentimiento&quot;. She began working on the album in 2006 after &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot; became a commercial failure. As a part of her evolution in reggaetón, Sentimiento includes &quot;solo turns&quot; instead of duets with guest artists. The solo tracks include; &quot;Pobre Corazón&quot; by Divino, &quot;Manaña Al Despertar&quot; by Baby Rasta and Norieganone of which feature Queen&#x27;s vocals. She said she wanted to give a 180-degree turn to what people think of reggaetón. She said, &quot;[m]any think reggaetón is just nice rhythms to dance to. And they forget there are song-writers and composers, who, like everyone else, also suffer and aspire in love ... Love is what makes us write things, what keeps us alive. If we did not have love, we would have nothing&quot;. The album spawned a Top 10 hit &quot;Que Lloren&quot; and the moderately successful singles &quot;En Que Fallamos&quot; and &quot;Sentimientos&quot;. At the Latin Grammy Awards of 2007, Calle 13 won the Best Urban Music Album award for their album &quot;Residente o Visitante&quot;
Queen&#x27;s &quot;Sentimiento&quot; was nominated in the same category.

Calle 13&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Los de Atrás Vienen Conmigo&quot; included a song entitled &quot;Que Lloren&quot; which criticized Queen and asked her &quot;to cut herself with a razor&quot;. She responded stating &quot;I&#x27;m the queen of this genre, a genre that contains male rappers such as Don Omar, Wisin &amp; Yandel and Tego Calderón who respect me a lot for an idiot to have my name in his mouth.&quot; After Calle 13 had won various awards in the urban music category, Queen called the duo to let them know publicly how she felt about them. She was unhappy because despite the abundance of awards and nominees, only Calle 13 received awards explaining &quot;they dedicated the night to Calle 13.&quot; The duo called Queen a hypocrite.

===2008–10: &quot;Ivy Queen 2008 World Tour LIVE!&quot; and &quot;Drama Queen&quot;===
In 2008, Queen released the single &quot;Dime&quot;, which was featured on her first live album &quot;Ivy Queen 2008 World Tour LIVE!&quot;. In April 2010, she was signed to Machete Music. The signing, described as a 360 deal, includes profit sharing in tours, sponsorships and merchandising. Univision Records, was acquired by Machete&#x27;s parent company Universal Music Latin Entertainment in 2008. Walter Kolm, president of Universal Music Latino and Machete, said in a press release, &quot;[i]t&#x27;s a privilege to have Ivy Queen a part of our artistic roster. Ivy is an extraordinary woman with incomparable talent, and she&#x27;s number one in her genre. We&#x27;re happy to be able to work with her on her new album as well as future projects&quot;. Queen said of the partnership, &quot;I&#x27;m very proud to be a part of Machete Music. They are a young, vibrant company that has created a name for itself in Latin music in the United States and the world. They are a strong and important company that has been recognized for nurturing their artists&#x27; creative talents ... &quot;.

&quot;Drama Queen&quot; (2010), released on July 10, 2010, was originally intended to be released after her third compilation album &quot;Cosa Nostra: Hip-Hop&quot; (2006) as a concept album on which Ivy Queen would performing duets with female singers from different genres. &quot;Sentimiento&quot; was released instead. Queen told &quot;EFE&quot; that she started writing for the album while she was heartbroken at home. Her emotions then burst out in the recording studio. She added the album contains 16 of 26 songs she wrote during this period. When &quot;Latina Magazine&quot; asked her about the drama between the release of &quot;Sentimiento&quot; and &quot;Drama Queen&quot;, Queen said: 
&quot;Drama Queen&quot; sold 3,000 units in its first week and dominated urban album sales for nine consecutive weeks. It debuted and peaked at number 163 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, number three on Top Latin Albums, and number 18 on Rap Albums. &quot;Drama Queen&quot; received a nomination for Best Urban Music Album at the 2011 Latin Grammy Awards, which was won by Calle 13 for &quot;Entren Los Que Quieran&quot;. Queen also received two nominations at the 2011 Latin Billboard Music Awards for Hot Latin Songs Artist of the Year, Female and Top Latin Albums Artist of the Year, Female. Shakira won both awards.

On August 21, 2012, Queen&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Musa&quot; was released. It debuted and peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums chart. She said that spending two years away from the media has helped her emotionally and mentally. She also said that the album is &quot;very mature and complete&quot;, because although her style is urban and reggaeton it also features fusions of rhythms and instruments with their own styles. The album managed a nomination for Best Urban Music Album at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2013.

It was announced in September 2013, that Queen had changed management and returned with Jorge &quot;Goguito&quot; Guadalupe, president and co-founder of Filtro Musik, to release her ninth studio album, entitled &quot;Vendetta&quot; in February 2014. Following the birth of her first biological child, Queen then announced that she would embark on a U.S. tour entitled the &quot;Viva Puerto Rico Tour&quot;. The tour, launched on January 29, 2014, included performances at various gay clubs in cities of the United States and Puerto Rico, such as New York, Orlando, Miami, Houston, Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego, Atlanta, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Tampa, and Ponce.

Queen&#x27;s ninth studio album was released on February 3, 2015. An extended play version of the album was released on December 9, 2014. The studio album version was originally announced for a release in February 2014, and later some time in 2014.

The extended play version of the album, entitled &quot;&quot;, includes the first four singles from the album: &quot;Soy Libre&quot;, &quot;Vamos A Guerrear&quot;, &quot;Naci Para Amarte&quot;, and the title track &quot;Vendetta&quot;, on disc one.

===2023-present: Tenth studio album, continued recognition===
In 2024, Queen became the first reggaeton artist to headline a concert at the Carnegie Hall.

==Musical style==
===Musical style===
Queen&#x27;s musical style is classified as reggaetonan urban genre with roots in Latin and Caribbean music. However, Queen also performs in several other genres including hip hop, salsa, merengue, and bachata. Yoselín Acevedo of &quot;People en Español&quot; said that &quot;&#x27;Cosas De La Vida&#x27;—which isn&#x27;t her first bachata song, shows that other than being the &#x27;Queen of Reggaeton&#x27; she can also easily convert herself into the &#x27;Queen of Bachata&#x27;. Queen has also recorded salsa tracks, beginning in 2005 with &quot;Amiga No Pienses&quot; and &quot;Yo Lamento&quot;, and in 2007 with &quot;Si Eres Tú&quot; which she recorded in a &quot;big-band Salsa&quot; style. She worked with salsa singers La India on &quot;Cuando Hieres A Una Mujer&quot; and Víctoria Sanabría on &quot;No Te Quiero&quot;.

Queen cites Celia Cruz, La Lupe, and other &quot;classic Salsa singers&quot; as inspirations for her style of hip-hop music. Her main influence is Selena, to whom she pays tribute on her fifth studio album &quot;Flashback&quot; with a &quot;reggaeton-ed up twist&quot; on &quot;Si Una Vez&quot;. She also said she enjoyed the songs &quot;Como La Flor&quot; and &quot;La Carcacha&quot;. Queen told Ramiro Burr of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, &quot;I admired Selena because she had that famous crossover success, but sadly she never got to enjoy it,&quot; she said. According to Allmusic, she takes influences from Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Gloria Estefan, Madonna and Salt-N-Pepa. Queen cites fellow American rapper Missy Elliott as an influence as well.

===Lyrics and messaging===
 Queen said that to stand out in the male-dominated world of reggaeton, she would have to deliver a strong point of view from a female perspective, saying, &quot;God blessed me with a powerful voice. It is not feminine. It is not masculine. It is just a thick voice.&quot; Queen also stated that her achievements are all due to the fact that she is an artist who, &quot;always [has] something to say, something to contribute. [She] never came with empty rhythm or lyrics. [Men saw that] the girl that could write and sing and go to the platform and kill, as we say&quot;. She created music people&#x27;s bodies could move to but was consistent in standing her ground and standing for agency and women empowerment. Instead of the vulgar lyrics common in reggaeton, Queen prefers to sing about defending women while touching on themes of social political matters, homosexuality, racism, love and heartbreak. Queen says she writes songs that &quot;put bad men in their places or stand up for the single mothers&quot;. In &quot;Que Lloren&quot; she discusses romance from a woman&#x27;s perspective while belittling the stereotype that men shouldn&#x27;t cry or show emotions. In &quot;Quiero Bailar&quot; she &quot;berates a lover who thinks that just because they dance she is automatically going to bed with him&quot;. According to Ivy, men commonly misinterpret consent to dance with sexual interest within reggaeton dance culture. Since beginning her career, Queen has wanted to create and compose songs &quot;that have some kind of subject matter&quot; so that people understand the concept and message. &quot;Mi Barrio&quot; is a socio-political charged song which criticizes &quot;the problems present in Añasco, Puerto Rico&quot;. Queen compared the song to &quot;Corazones&quot; by Daddy Yankee from his album &quot;Barrio Fino&quot;.

==Legacy==
According to Jon Pareles of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Queen is the &quot;only significant female reggaeton rapper&quot;. She is known as the &quot;Queen of Reggaeton&quot; in the traditionally male-dominated genre. She is also known &quot;La Diva&quot;, &quot;La Potra&quot;, &quot;La Caballota&quot;, and &quot;La Reina&quot;. She has become the &quot;indisputable lead female voice of Latin urban and reggaeton music [and] an international icon for Latin music itself.&quot; She has been referred to as a &quot;trailblazer&quot; within the genre of Reggaetón. About.com named Queen one of the ten most influential women in Latin music in the category Reggaeton/Hip-Hop while selecting &quot;Sentimiento&quot; as Queen&#x27;s best album.

==Personal life==
Ivy Queen was married to fellow reggaeton singer Omar Navarro, known by his stage name Gran Omar. They were divorced in 2005. Queen said she never found Omar in the act of adultery, and said that if she had, she would be in La Vega Altaa women&#x27;s prison in Puerto Rico. She also said she had not physically assaulted Omar&#x27;s alleged mistress. She stated they had not lived together for two months, citing the &quot;extensive travels of her husband and his workload of being a producer&quot; as causes of the end of the nine-year marriage. A year after their separation, Omar said that Queen had tricked him, and that she owed him money from the sales and production of the album &quot;Cosa Nostra: Hip-Hop&quot;, which they presented together because of their obligations and contract with Univision. Jorge GuadalupeIvy Queen&#x27;s managerinvited Omar to take legal action. Guadalupe called Omar &quot;someone who misses the money and the high-life&quot; he had while he was married to Queen. No legal action was taken, however. Omar appeared on television station Telefutura&#x27;s program &quot;Escándalo TV&quot; and accused Queen of being unfaithful in their marriage. Queen however, denied the claims.

Queen was in a relationship with DJ Urba from mid-2006 to the end of 2007. In 2010, after Queen invited American actor Vin Diesel to attend 2010 Premios Juventud, it was rumored they were in a relationship together. She told &quot;Escándalo TV&quot; that there was no romance between them and that they were just good friends.

Ivy Queen has said she identifies with &quot;Menor Que Yo&quot;a song where she was &quot;talking about reality when she wrote it&quot;in her personal life. She said the song is about what happens to a lot of women. &quot;I was talking about reality when I wrote it. About what happens to a lot of women. I think that there&#x27;s no age requirement for two people who love each other. It&#x27;s mostly about how people react when they see a mature woman who&#x27;s with a younger man ... They think it&#x27;s for money. They never think that there might be a connection, chemistry. She later said &quot;Sentimientos&quot; was the song that best represented her at that time, saying, &quot; ... if you think you can only conquer me if you&#x27;re famous, rich and have an expensive car, you&#x27;re wrong, because I&#x27;m a woman who needs affection, someone to open the door for me, to bring me flowers and sing to me.&quot;

Queen does not drink alcohol. She said that although she quit high school after fourth year (eleventh grade), she graduated from the academy &quot;Street&quot; with a Bachelor of Life and honors. She said her vocabulary is &quot;that of the street&quot;, and that if she could do something other than singing she would go to college.

Queen married Puerto Rican choreographer Xavier Sánchez in late 2012. She announced in June 2013 that the couple were expecting their first child. Before becoming naturally pregnant, Queen adopted two Latino children. She revealed her baby bump at the Calibash 2013 concert which was headlined by R&amp;B singer Chris Brown. The baby was born in November 2013. In 2024, Queen announced that she had separated from her husband. In June 2016, Queen&#x27;s father died of pulmonary cancer.

<doc id="1104746" wikidata="Q111405" url="?curid=1104746" title="Pisogne">
<text>Pisogne (Camunian: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; of 8156 inhabitants in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy. It is located about 30 kilometers (19 mi) northwest of Brescia, 51 kilometers (32 miles) northeast of Bergamo, and 97 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Milan.

Today, Pisogne is a tourist destination, known for its historic center, its lakeside location, and its proximity to the Val Camonica. The town is home to a number of historical landmarks, including the Church of Santa Maria Assunta, the Torre del Vescovo (Bishop&#x27;s Tower), and the Roman Bridge. Pisogne is also a starting point for hiking and biking trails in the Val Camonica. The town is home to a number of frescoes dating from the 14th to the 16th centuries. The town&#x27;s annual festival, the Festa del Perdono, is held in July. Pisogne is also a destination for windsurfing and kitesurfing.

Pisogne is served by the Ferrovia Brescia-Iseo-Edolo (BS-IE), a regional railway line that connects the city of Brescia with the town of Edolo in the Val Camonica. The train track to Pisogne is single-track and non-electrified. There are two train stations in Pisogne: Pisogne and Toline. The Pisogne station is located in the town center, while the Toline station is located on the outskirts of town. Trains to Pisogne depart from the Brescia railway station every 30 minutes to 1 hour. Tickets can be purchased online or on the train with one of the conductors.

==Geography==
Pisogne is situated at the northern-east tip of Lake Iseo, where the river Oglio flows into the lake. It is the lowermost commune of the Val Camonica. Neighbouring communes are Marone, Pezzaze, Pian Camuno, Lovere, and Costa Volpino.

The terrain around Pisogne is varied, with hills, mountains, and valleys. The climate in Pisogne is temperate, with warm summers and cool winters. The average temperature in July is 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit), and the average temperature in January is 2 degrees Celsius (36 degrees Fahrenheit). The main river in Pisogne is the Oglio, which flows through the town and into Lake Iseo. The Oglio is a major river in Italy, and it is a destination for whitewater rafting and kayaking. The mountains surrounding Pisogne are part of the Alps.

==History==
Pisogne is mentioned for the first time in 1227.

In 1287 the great rebellion led by Camunian Federici noble family against the city of Brescia, was followed by the killing of several of Pisogne Guelphs resident there. Following this fact, the town was fortified between the 12th and 13th century and granted to the Brusati family.

In the XVI century, Pisogne became famous for the many executions by burning of those considered heretics and witches. During this time, 60 women were burned alive between Pisogne and Edolo after being tortured and tried at the Inquisition Court based in Cemmo. On 18th of July 1518, eight women died. Only several years later the Papal Legate from Venice investigate the events, leading to the dissolution of the Cemmo Court and the return of the confiscated property to the families of the victims.

On November 14, 1727, the bandit Giorgio Vicario, one of the most feared of Val Camonica &quot;buli&quot; (bandits), born in Pisogne in 1695, was murdered. Vicario&#x27;s death was a major event in the town, and it is still remembered today.

In 1907 Pisogne was reached by the railway line, which is still running.

In the modern era, Pisogne has become a tourist destination, and in recent years has seen a growing expat community.

<doc id="1104747" wikidata="Q1345157" url="?curid=1104747" title="Henry Baker Tristram">
<text>Henry Baker Tristram FRS (11 May 1822 – 8 March 1906) was an English clergyman, Bible scholar, traveller and ornithologist. As a parson-naturalist he was an early, but short-lived, supporter of Darwinism, attempting to reconcile evolution and creation.

==Biography==
He was the son of the Rev. Henry Baker Tristram, born at Eglingham vicarage, near Alnwick, Northumberland. He studied at Durham School and Lincoln College, Oxford. In 1846 he was ordained a priest.

==Diplomatic, scientific and missionary work==
Tristram was secretary to the governor of Bermuda from 1847 to 1849. He explored the Sahara desert, and in 1858 visited Palestine, returning there in 1863 and 1872, and dividing his time between natural history observations and identifying localities mentioned in the Old and New Testaments. In 1873 he became canon of Durham Cathedral. In 1881 he travelled again to Palestine, the Lebanon, Mesopotamia, and Armenia. He also made a second voyage to Japan to visit his daughter, Katherine Alice Salvin Tristram, in 1891. She was a missionary and headteacher in Osaka. She was the first woman missionary with the Church Missionary Society to have a degree. In his journals taken during his travels in Palestine, he described Bedouins, Jews and Muslims in disparaging terms.

In 1858, he read the simultaneously published papers by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace that were read in the Linnean Society, and published a paper in Ibis stating that given the &quot;series of about 100 Larks of various species before me... I cannot help feeling convinced of the views set forth by Messrs Darwin and Wallace.&quot; He attempted to reconcile this early acceptance of evolution with creation. Following the famous Oxford Debate between Thomas Henry Huxley and Samuel Wilberforce, Tristram, after early acceptance of the theory, rejected Darwinism.

Tristram was a founder and original member of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union, and appointed a fellow of the Royal Society in 1868. Edward Bartlett, an English ornithologist and son of Abraham Dee Bartlett, accompanied Tristram to Palestine in 1863–1864. During his travels he accumulated an extensive collection of bird skins, which he sold to the World Museum Liverpool.

==Published works==
Tristram&#x27;s publications included
* &quot;The Great Sahara&quot; (1860)
*&quot;The Natural History of the Bible&quot; (1867); 10th edition (1911)
*&quot;Scenes in the East&quot; (1870)
*&quot;The Daughters of Syria&quot; (1872)
*&quot;Pathways of Palestine&quot; (1882)
*&quot;The Fauna and Flora of Palestine&quot; (1884)
** &quot;The Survey of Western Palestine: The Fauna and Flora of Palestine&quot; (1884)
*&quot;Eastern Customs in Bible Lands&quot; (1894) and &quot;Rambles in Japan&quot; (1895)

==Legacy==
A number of birds were named after him, including Tristram&#x27;s starling (also called Tristram&#x27;s grackle), Tristram&#x27;s bunting, Tristram&#x27;s warbler, Tristram&#x27;s woodpecker, Tristram&#x27;s serin, and Tristram&#x27;s storm-petrel. He also lent his name to the gerbil &quot;Meriones tristrami&quot; (also called Tristram&#x27;s jird). He is also commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, &quot;Acanthodactylus tristrami&quot;.

==Private life==
He married Eleanor Mary Bowlby in Cheltenham on 5 February 1850. Their eight children included missionary and headteacher Katherine Alice Salvin Tristram.

<doc id="1104751" wikidata="Q7753853" url="?curid=1104751" title="New Zealand Institute (think tank)">
<text>The New Zealand Institute was a privately funded think tank based in Auckland, New Zealand, which existed from July 2004 until April 2012, when it was merged into the New Zealand Initiative.

The Institute was founded by former New Zealand Treasury researcher Dr David Skilling, with the expressed aim of &quot;generating ideas, solutions and debate that will improve economic prosperity, social well-being, environmental quality and environmental productivity&quot;.

In comparison with longer-established think-tanks such as the New Zealand Business Roundtable, it was envisaged as less doctrinaire.

The address of the New Zealand Institute was Auckland 1142, PO Box 90840.

==Background==
The New Zealand Institute described itself as: &quot;a privately funded think-tank committed to generating ideas, debate and solutions that will improve economic prosperity, social well-being, environmental quality and environmental productivity for New Zealand and New Zealanders.&quot;

One media source described the New Zealand Institute as libertarian in outlook. The Institute claimed to be &quot;committed to political neutrality and evidence-based analysis.&quot;

==Institute staff==
The following people were involved with the Institute up to its merger:
* Tony Carter (Chair)
* Dr Rick Boven (Director)
* Catherine Harland (Project Leader)
* Lillian Grace (Research Associate)

==Merger==
With the departure of founding director David Skilling, the organisation attracted a lower profile, until it was announced in 2011 that it would merge with the New Zealand Business Roundtable. The merger was officially completed in April 2012, with the new merged organisation known as the New Zealand Initiative.

<doc id="1104754" wikidata="Q6387157" url="?curid=1104754" title="Kemptown, Brighton">
<text>Kemptown is a small community running along the King&#x27;s Cliff from the Old Steine to Black Rock in the east of Brighton, East Sussex, England it includes the Kemp Town residential estate known as Sussex Square and Lewes Crescent to its eastern end. It is wholly in the parliamentary constituency of Brighton Kemptown and Peacehaven.

As of the 2021 Census, the Kemptown Intermediate Zone (MSOA) area (which doesn&#x27;t include the Kemp Town Estate or the gay village in St James&#x27; Street) has the highest percentage of residents identifying as LGB+ out of any MSOA in the UK with 20.11%.

It was a local government ward called &quot;Kemp Town&quot; from 1894 to 1908, then called King&#x27;s Cliff from 1908 with various boundaries until its abolition in 2003. It was recreated as a local government ward usually called Kemptown Ward in 2023 covering the area south of Edward Street and Eastern Road from the Old Steine to Black Rock including all of the Kemp Town estate. 

==History==

The area takes its name from Thomas Read Kemp&#x27;s Kemp Town residential estate of the early 19th Century, but the one-word name now refers to an area larger than the original development and is traditionally called King&#x27;s Cliff. Much of the housing is slightly later but still of the Regency style, although there is also Victorian architecture and some more modern buildings. Conversions of grand Regency buildings into flats and bars has provided Kemptown with some distinctive properties; one club is housed within the Sassoon Mausoleum, the former burial chamber of Edward Sassoon.

In the nineteenth century, Kemptown was home to the Brighton Institute for Deaf and Dumb Children, at 127-132 Eastern Road (now demolished), opposite Brighton College. One of its inmates was Richard Aslatt Pearce, the first deaf ordained Anglican clergyman.

Since 1950, the locality has given its name to the Brighton Kemptown parliamentary constituency, covering a wider area of eastern Brighton and at times Peacehaven.

==Location and surrounding areas==

Central Brighton is to the west of the area. Travelling inland (north) from Kemptown one finds Queen&#x27;s Park above the western portion of Kemptown. Further to the east are the Bristol Estate, Craven Vale estate, and Whitehawk, sometimes collectively known as &quot;East Brighton&quot;. Returning south to the seafront, Kemptown&#x27;s easterly neighbours are Black Rock and then Roedean. Also within walking distance is Brighton Marina.

==Community and facilities==
Historically known as an actors&#x27; and artists&#x27; quarter, it has a sizeable LGBT community and a network of streets with specialised shops, hotels, cafés and pubs. The annual Brighton Pride Village Party takes place in the western part of Kemptown closing off parts of St James&#x27; Street, Marine Parade and surrounding streets. 

Community spaces predominately are based in religious buildings including The Crypt at St. George&#x27;s Church, Fitzherbert Community Hub at St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church, and community facilities at both St Mary Church Kemp Town and Dorset Gardens Methodist Church.

The Royal Sussex County Hospital is located on the northern edge of Kemptown.

Kemptown Carnival was held each year but hasn&#x27;t been held since 2019 with the 2023 production cancelled at the last moment. 

==Transport==

Kemptown gained a railway station in 1869. The line, featuring two viaducts and a tunnel, was built at great cost partly to block the route for other railways from London. The railway lost out to bus traffic (the route from Brighton was longer than the road journey) and was closed to passenger traffic in 1933, surviving for freight until the 1970s.

There remain a number of bus services through Kemptown, and the Volk&#x27;s Electric Railway passes the area along the beach.

<text>The Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch (IEW; &quot;Indo-European Etymological Dictionary&quot;) was published in 1959 by the Austrian-Czech comparative linguist and Celtic languages expert Julius Pokorny. It is an updated and slimmed-down reworking of the three-volume &quot;Vergleichendes Wörterbuch der indogermanischen Sprachen&quot; (1927–1932, by Alois Walde and Julius Pokorny).

Both of these works aim to provide an overview of the lexical knowledge of the Proto-Indo-European language accumulated through the early 20th century. The &quot;IEW&quot; is now significantly outdated, especially as it was conservative even when it was written, ignoring the now integral laryngeal theory, and hardly including any Anatolian material.

<doc id="1104786" wikidata="Q15648" url="?curid=1104786" title="Lake Iseo">
<text>Lake Iseo or Iseo lake ( ; ; ), also known as Sebino (; ), is the fourth largest lake in Lombardy, Italy, fed by the Oglio River.

It is in the north of the country in the Val Camonica area, near the cities of Brescia and Bergamo. The lake is almost equally divided between the provinces of Bergamo and Brescia. Northern Italy is known for its heavily industrialised towns and in between there are several natural lakes. Lake Iseo retains its natural environment, with its lush green mountains surrounding the crystal clear lake.

There are several medieval towns around the lake, the largest being Iseo and Sarnico. A notable tourism sector has emerged. A road has been carved into the side of the mountains that circumnavigates the entire lake. In the middle of the lake there are Montisola island, Loreto isle and San Paolo isle (which compound the Monte Isola municipality). There is easy access via the regular running lake ferries.

The Floating Piers, an art installation by Christo and Jeanne-Claude (made of a series of walkways), was open to the public at Lake Iseo for 16 days in June and July 2016.

Since 2018, the northern portion of the lake (called &quot;Alto Sebino&quot;) has been part of the UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve of &quot;Valle Camonica - Alto Sebino&quot;.
== Hydrography ==

The level of the lake is regulated by the Sarnico Dam, built in 1933 in Fosio.
The work, built in concrete and steel, is managed by the &quot;Consorzio dell&#x27;Oglio&quot; which divides the water withdrawn between irrigation uses and hydroelectric uses.

=== Tributaries ===
In addition to the Oglio River, the lake is fed by the following creeks and streams:
# Bergamo shore: 
#*Borlezza, 
#*Rino di Vigolo,
#*Rino di Predore;
# Brescia shore: 
#*Bagnadore, 
#*Calchere,
#*Cortelo,
#*Opolo.

==Settlements==
Around the shore of the lake are some small towns:


Two smaller islands, Loreto and St. Paul, are privately owned.

<doc id="1104809" wikidata="Q3133261" url="?curid=1104809" title="Meopham">
<text>Meopham is a large linear village and civil parish in the Borough of Gravesham in north-west Kent, England, lying to the south of Gravesend. The parish covers , and comprises two villages and two smaller settlements; it had a population of 6,795 at the 2021 census. Meopham village is sometimes described as the longest settlement in England although others such as Brinkworth which is one village make the same claim. Meopham is one of the longest linear settlements in Europe, being in length.

==History==
The name of the village derives from &quot;Meapaham&quot; (Meapa&#x27;s village): it is first recorded in 788, in the reign of King Offa. The modern pronunciation of the name comes from different ways of writing and spelling.

Benedictine monks established a priory hospital at Meopham in the 12th century and throughout the Middle Ages three medieval manor houses - those of Meopham, Dodmore and Nurstead - governed the land now encompassing the parish. Edward Hasted in 1797 described the village as being &quot;out of the way&quot; and with &quot;no well frequented thoroughfare through it&quot;. Since the 1920s, when the road numbering scheme started, the main road through the village, the A227, has become busier as a through-route connecting North Kent with the M20 motorway at the foot of the North Downs, although this now has been somewhat relieved by the M25.

Historically, the parish of Meopham was in the Hundred of Toltingtrough.

==The parish==
The parish comprises the main village, divided into four named settlements; the outlying village of Harvel (approx 2 miles south-east); and two other settlements: Dodmore (still comprising mostly rural land from &quot;The Street&quot; southeastwards for approx 1 mile towards Harvel) and Culverstone (approx 1.5 miles to the south). The Parish Council, which now owns the lordship of the manor of Meopham, meets at Meopham Windmill and consists of twelve members (&quot;aka&quot; joint trustees of the ancient manor).

===The main village===
From the north along the main A227, the four settlements are Hook Green; The Street (&quot;Dodmore&quot;); Meopham Green; and Culverstone. The first three contain conservation areas. There were originally seven village greens in the parish; only three remain today.

&quot;Hook Green&quot; is the most northerly of the settlements. Originally called &quot;Hoo Green&quot;, it lies around a small triangular village green to the west of the main road. There are again many listed buildings in the area, including the &quot;Weavers Cottage&quot;. More modern developments are situated near to Meopham Railway Station to the north.

&quot;The Street&quot; (&quot;Dodmore&quot;) is the oldest of the village&#x27;s settlements, where parts of the medieval manorial mansion of Dodmore stand, although the original structure was badly damaged in an earthquake of 1382: it is close to the 14th-century church, the parish church of St John the Baptist. In addition, there are many other historic buildings, including &quot;The George Inn&quot;, where the manorial court of Dodmore once sat. At &quot;The George Inn&quot; there is still the &quot;Courtroom Bar&quot;, the room in which the court baron of the manor was held. Donald Adamson, the present lord of the manor of Dodmore, owns the Tudor manor house. The family of the cricketer Thomas Nordish worked Dodmore Manor Farm. In the late 20th century Ifield CC relocated to within Dodmore&#x27;s ancient manorial boundaries, becoming &quot;New Ifield CC&quot;.
&quot;Meopham Green&quot; is by far the largest remaining village green in the parish. The main road passes to the west; around the other two sides are buildings, many of which are of 18th- and 19th-century origin. Here are two public houses: the &quot;King&#x27;s Arms&quot;; and &quot;The Cricketers&#x27; Inn&quot;, previously &quot;The Long Hop&quot;. Just to the north of the Green is &quot;Meopham Vineyard&quot;.

Meopham Green is home to a cricket pitch, where the sport has been played every summer since at least 1776, and which is one of Kent&#x27;s idyllic settings for the game; the former prime minister, Sir John Major, is a patron of Meopham Cricket Club where he stood on a soapbox during the 1992 general election campaign. Meopham Windmill is nearby.

&quot;Culverstone Green&quot; is the most southerly of the main village settlements. The original village green has mostly been given up to road widening. On the main road, and down Whitepost Lane to the east, are both older and modern houses; a small supermarket; and a petrol station. A notable local house is &quot;Lacknut House&quot; (1832-1843) named after the area of land &quot;Lacknuts&quot; which was used as a fruit farm and is located directly opposite Culverstone Green.

There is a considerably built-up area between the main road and Harvel. This is known as &quot;Culverstone Valley&quot;: it covers some and lies among woodlands. It is described as a unique development, which in its origins was the result of the sale of plots of land in the 1930s. Originally, chalets, shacks and caravans were built on the plots. Since then unauthorised developments, often extending the original buildings, have taken place in an area which is now Green Belt. Poor access and limited facilities such as proper drainage has led Gravesham Borough Council to take action by curbing this trend.

===Other settlements===
The other two main settlements in the parish are &quot;Nurstead&quot; (until 1935 a separate civil parish), where Nurstead Court is located next to the parish church, with former estate workers&#x27; cottages nearby; and &quot;Camer&quot;, once home to the family of Smith-Masters, with a few cottages near Camer Park.

==Geography==
The village lies on the dip slope of the North Downs, above sea level at its highest.

==The windmill==
The windmill was built by James Killick, a millwright from Strood, in 1801. After his death in 1823, it passed to his wife Sukey, then to his son James, and after to his grandson Thomas who died in 1891. The Killicks lived in Strood where the family also owned mills and were reputed to walk the eight miles to Meopham each day. The mill worked by wind until 1929 and then by engine until 1965. It has been fully restored and is now in full working order.

==Churches==
There are two Church of England parish churches (now combined into one benefice): the grade I listed parish church of St John the Baptist, Meopham and &quot;Nurstead&quot;&#x27;s 14th-century church of St Mildred. Other churches include Mount Zion Baptist Church built in 1828 and nearby Meopham Green, South Street Baptist Church, to the north of Culverstone and the Roman Catholic Church of St Paul, consecrated in 1965.

==Education==
There are three state schools in the village: the secondary Meopham School has developed as a specialist sports academy, and this is where Meopham Library is situated too; there are two primary schools: Meopham Community Academy (formerly Meopham Community Primary School) and Culverstone Green Primary School. Gravesend Grammar School is within the borough, and nearby are fee-paying schools, such as Cobham Hall School, and King&#x27;s School, Rochester.

==Transport==
The main road through the village, the A227, carries a large amount of traffic. It first became a main road under the Turnpike Acts in 1825, when it was designed to connect Gravesend with Wrotham.

Meopham Railway Station, at the north end of the village, is on the Chatham Main Line which runs to Victoria Station in London. Ebbsfleet International Station is under away, but is only accessible to passengers via Gravesend.

<text>The is a Japanese &quot;rekishi-monogatari&quot; (historical tale) written in the late Heian period. It is also called the or the .

==Date and authorship==
It has been speculated that the work was compiled in or shortly after 1170; Donald Keene, citing Isao Takehana, stated that the work was probably written between the eighth month of 1174 and the seventh month of 1175. The author is uncertain, but the most likely candidate is the &quot;waka&quot; poet .

==Structure and style==
The text is in ten volumes, and is told from the point of view of an elderly woman who is described as a granddaughter of , the narrator of the &quot;Ōkagami&quot;, and as having formerly been in the service of Murasaki Shikibu. It has been suggested that the writer chose a woman as his fictional narrator where the &quot;Ōkagami&quot;&#x27;s author had chosen two men that he wished to focus on more elegant &quot;feminine&quot; topics than military and political affairs.

The work contains 140 &quot;waka&quot; and countless references to Japanese and Chinese literature.

==Content==
The work begins with a group of pilgrims visiting the temples of Yamato Province being approached by an elderly woman who, when asked if she lives in the region, says that she lived in the Capital for one hundred years and then in Yamashiro Province for another fifty, before moving to Yamato. The listeners are astonished at her great age, but she humbly replies by listing several others in China and Japan who had supposedly lived to great age, including her grandfather Yotsugi. She says her name is Ayame (iris), which was given to her because of her birth on the fifth day of the fifth month, the same day as the , although she had also been given the nickname Imakagami (the new mirror) by her mistress Murasaki Shikibu, in reference to a poem by Bai Juyi that described the casting of a new mirror on that day.

The rest of the work describes the old lady&#x27;s recollections of the past. It describes the period of roughly 150 years from 1025 to 1170. and is primarily focused on an account of the imperial family and the Fujiwara and Murakami-Genji clans.

<text>The Bangash, Bungish, Bangaš or Bangakh () are a tribe of Pashtuns, inhabiting their traditional homeland, the Bangash district which stretches from Kohat to Tall in Hangu and Spīn Ghar, Kurram in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. They also live as a smaller population in Dera Ismail Khel, Bannu while also a smaller population of Bangash inhabit mainly Gardez, Paktia and around the Lōya Paktia region of Afghanistan.

==Genealogy==
According to a narrative, the Bangash tribe descended from a man named Ismail, who is described as a governor of Multan whose 11th-generation ancestor was Khalid ibn al-Walid, the famous Arab commander of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, But they are most likely descended from their Tribe Name Originator Banga who was a friend of Sikandar Shah (Orakzai) became the closest to the ruler of Kohat. After the ruler died he tried to secure the throne and betrayed his childhood best friend Sikandar Shah (Ancestor of Orakzais) as written in the Book History of Pathans, by Haroon Rashid, Volume-IV p-52). According to the legend, Ismail moved from Multan to settle in Gardez, Paktia, while his wife was from Farmul in Urgun, Paktika. Ismail had two sons, Gār and Sāmil, who were the progenitors of the modern Gari and Samilzai clans of the Bangash, respectively.

==Etymology==
According to a popular folk etymology, the name &quot;Bangash&quot;, &quot;Bungish&quot; or &quot;Bangakh&quot; is derived from &quot;bon-kash&quot; (), which is Persian for &quot;root drawer&quot; or &quot;root destroyer,&quot; implying that during battles, the Bangash would not rest until they destroy the opponent.

==History==
During the early modern period, the Bangash homeland was known as &quot;Bangash district and was ruled by the Khan Of Hangu since 1540 which is well documented &quot; Babur, a Timurid (and later Mughal) ruler from Fergana (in present-day Uzbekistan) who captured Kabul in 1504, described Bangash district in his &quot;Baburnama&quot; as one of the 14 &quot;tūmān&quot; of Kabul province.

===Timurid raids===

In 1505, after plundering Kohat for two days, Babur&#x27;s Timurid army marched southwest to raid Bangash district. As they reached a valley surrounded by mountains between Kohat and Hangu, the Bangash Pashtuns occupied the hills on both sides, surrounding the army. However, the Timurids successfully pushed the Pashtuns down towards a nearby detached hill, after which the Timurids surrounded them from all sides and got hold of them. About 100 to 200 Pashtuns were taken during the attack.

On the next day, Babur reached Hangu, where the Bangash Pashtuns had fortified a sangar on the top of a hill. The Timurid army immediately captured it and beheaded about 100 to 200 more Pashtuns, setting up another tower of heads. From Hangu, the Timurid army marched to Tall. The soldiers set out to plunder the Bangash Pashtuns of the neighborhood. Afterwards, the Timurids marched from Bangash to Bannu on the Kurram River, where they set up their third pillar of severed heads.

===Roshani movement===
In the second half of the 16th century, the Bangash tribe joined the Roshani movement of Pir Roshan, an ethnic Ormur, who migrated with his family and few of his disciples from Waziristan to Tirah. The Roshanis rebelled against the Mughal emperor Akbar, who constantly sent punitive expeditions to crush the movement. After Pir Roshan&#x27;s death, the movement was led by his youngest son Pir Jalala. In 1587, Akbar sent a strong Mughal force against him to the Bangash region. In 1599, Pir Jalala took Ghazni but it was quickly recovered by the Mughals. Pir Jalala was succeeded by his nephew Ahdad, who set up a base in Charkh, Logar, and attacked Mughal-held Kabul and Jalalabad several times between 1611 and 1615, but was unsuccessful. In 1626, Ahdad died during a Mughal attack in Tirah. In 1630, when Pir Roshan&#x27;s great-grandson, Abdul Qadir, launched attacks on the Mughal army in Peshawar, thousands of Pashtuns from the Bangash, Afridi, Mohmand, Kheshgi, Yusufzai, and other tribes took part. The Roshanis failed in the attack, but continued their resistance against the Mughals throughout the 17th century.

Khwaja Muhammad Bangash, who belonged to the Bangash tribe, was a famous 17th-century Pashto Sufi poet and mystic associated with the Roshani movement.

===Karrani dynasty of Bengal===

The Karrani dynasty was founded in 1564 by Taj Khan Karrani, a Karlani Pashtun hailing from the Kurram valley in Bangash district. It was the last dynasty to rule the Bengal Sultanate. Taj Khan Karrani was formerly an employee of the Sur Pashtun emperor, Sher Shah Suri. His capital was at Gaur (in present-day Malda district, West Bengal, India). He was succeeded by his brother Sulaiman Khan Karrani, who shifted the capital from Gaur to Tandah (also in Malda district) in 1565. In 1568, Sulaiman Khan annexed Orissa to the Karrani sultanate. Sulaiman Khan&#x27;s authority extended from Cooch Behar to Puri, and from Son River to Brahmaputra River.

On 25 September 1574, the Mughal Empire captured the Karrani capital Tandah. The Battle of Tukaroi fought on 3 March 1575 forced Daud Khan Karrani, the last Karrani ruler, to withdraw to Orissa. The battle led to the Treaty of Katak in which Daud ceded the whole of Bengal and Bihar, retaining only Orissa. Daud Khan, however, later invaded Bengal, declaring independence from Mughal emperor Akbar. The Mughal onslaught against the Karrani sultanate ended with the Battle of Rajmahal on 12 July 1576, during which Daud Khan was captured and later executed by the Mughals. However, the Pashtuns and the local landlords known as Baro Bhuyans led by Isa Khan continued to resist the Mughal invasion. Later in 1612 during the reign of Jahangir, Bengal was finally integrated as a Mughal province.

===Bangash state of Farrukhabad===

Muhammad Khan Bangash, who belonged to the Kaghazai line of Bangash tribe, became the first Nawab of Farrukhabad in 1713 in Uttar Pradesh, India. Being illiterate, he was unable to understand a single word of Persian, Turki or Pashto. He named the city after then Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar. The Bangash Nawabs encouraged merchants and bankers to come and settle in Farrukhabad for the promotion of commercial activities. Very important in this respect was the establishment of the Farrukhabad mint, which apart from being an emblem of sovereignty, stimulated bullion imports and attracted numerous bankers to work in the city. The superior quality of the Farrukhabad currency, both gold and silver, was well known in the eighteenth century as it became the most trustworthy and hardest currency of northern India.

Ahmad Shah Durrani (1747–1772), the founder of the Afghan Durrani Empire, preferred coins made at the Farrukhabad mint. The third Nawab of Farrukhabad, Ahmad Khan Bangash, took part in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 and supported Ahmad Shah Durrani to defeat the Marathas. Ahmad Khan practised the &quot;Utara&quot;, a peculiarity of Indian Muslim horsemen, which was the act of dismounting and fighting on foot in times of crisis, which the Hindustanis such as the Sadaat-e-Bara considered to be proof of exceptional bravery, something ridiculed by the Persian counterparts. Because of its reputation as a centre of commerce and finance, Farrukhabad began to attract new Pashtun immigrants from Afghanistan. However, Bangash-held Farrukhabad suffered from a steep economic and political decline under the British Company Raj, because the British colonial officers ordered to close the famed Farrukhabad mint and halt the bullion trade in 1824 as part of their policy to centralize the economy of India. The abolition of the mint dealt a heavy blow to the thriving grain trade and precipitated a monetary crisis in the urban and rural areas of the region. The Bangash Nawabs continued to rule Farrukhabad until they were defeated by the British at Kannauj on 23 October 1857 during the War of Independence. Today, many Bangash are settled in Uttar Pradesh, most notably in Farrukhabad.

===Bhopal State===

The Orakzai tribe is historically closely related to the Bangash; their traditional homeland (Orakzai District) was part of Bangash district. In 1723, Dost Mohammad Khan, who belonged to the Orakzai tribe and was formerly a mercenary in the Mughal army, founded the Bhopal State in the present-day Madhya Pradesh state of central India. After his death in 1728, his descendants, the Nawabs of Bhopal, continued ruling the state. Between 1819 and 1926, the state was ruled by four women – the Nawab Begums – unique in the royalty of those days. The third Nawab Begum of Bhopal, Shah Jahan Begum (1868–1901), built the Taj Mahal palace at Bhopal as her residence.

Hamidullah Khan, the last sovereign Nawab of the dynasty, officially acceded the state to India in 1949.

== Pashto dialect ==
The Bangash speak a northern or &quot;harder&quot; variant of Pashto similar to that of the Afridi dialect and the Bangash of Kurram speak similar to of the Mangal Pashtuns, but slightly differing in some lexicographical and phonetic features.

== Religion ==
The Bangash follow the religion of Islam, split almost evenly between Twelver Shia Muslims and Hanafi Sunni Muslims. The Bangash, along with the closely related Orakzais and Turis, are the only Pashtun tribes with Shia populations. The Shia Bangash are more concentrated around Upper Kurram and certain areas of Hangu in areas like Usterzai, while the Sunni Bangash are more concentrated around Lower Kurram Central Kurram as well as Thall and Bannu.

== Demographics ==
The Bangash are primarily found in Pakistan, with a sizeable population also found in Afghanistan. The Bangash Pashtuns can be found all over Pakistan but majority reside in the cities of Kohat and Hangu in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as well as the Kurram Valley and Peshawar. In Afghanistan, they will be found in the districts that make up the historic &quot;Loya Paktia&quot; region, including Paktia, Paktika, and Khost. Between both Pakistan and Afghanistan, there are around 800,000 Bangash Pashtuns, with around 780,000 in Pakistan alone.

Descendants of Bangash are found in India as well but are rather than being referred to as &quot;Pashtuns&quot;, they are known as Pathans. Instead of speaking Pashto, the Bangash Pathans of India speak either Hindi or Urdu. They are mostly found in Uttar Pradesh and mostly in the cities of Farrukhabad, Lucknow, and Gorakhpur. The descendants of the first Nawab of Farrukhabad, Muhammad Khan Bangash, have also been found in cities as far as Allahabad and Varanasi. Other Bangash descendants in India are also present in Bihar. There are around 30,000 descendants of Bangash in India but other researchers give estimates of around 70,000. Just like in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Bangash Pathans in India prefer to marry within their own tribe, or marry with other Pathans.

Despite the Karrani dynasty and its rule in modern-day Bangladesh, there are very little number of descendants of Bangash in the country. This is because unlike in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the descendants of Bangash have mixed with the local population. The Bangash descent Pathans of Bangladesh are Muhajirs that migrated from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to East Pakistan.

<text>Ceratosaurus (from Greek &#x27;horn&#x27; and &#x27;lizard&#x27;) was a carnivorous theropod dinosaur that lived in the Late Jurassic period (Kimmeridgian to Tithonian ages). The genus was first described in 1884 by American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh based on a nearly complete skeleton discovered in Garden Park, Colorado, in rocks belonging to the Morrison Formation. The type species is &quot;Ceratosaurus nasicornis&quot;.

The Garden Park specimen remains the most complete skeleton known from the genus and only a handful of additional specimens have been described since. Two additional species, &quot;Ceratosaurus dentisulcatus&quot; and &quot;Ceratosaurus magnicornis&quot;, were described in 2000 from two fragmentary skeletons from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry of Utah and from the vicinity of Fruita, Colorado. The validity of these additional species has been questioned, however, and all three skeletons possibly represent different growth stages of the same species. In 1999, the discovery of the first juvenile specimen was reported. In 2000, a partial specimen was excavated and described from the Lourinhã Formation of Portugal, providing evidence for the presence of the genus outside of North America. Fragmentary remains have also been reported from Tanzania, Uruguay, and Switzerland, although their assignment to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; is currently not accepted by most paleontologists.

&quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; was a medium-sized theropod. The original specimen is estimated to be or long, while the specimen described as &quot;C. dentisulcatus&quot; was larger, at around long. &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; was characterized by deep jaws that supported proportionally very long, blade-like teeth, a prominent, ridge-like horn on the midline of the snout, and a pair of horns over the eyes. The forelimbs were very short, but remained fully functional. The hand had four fingers with claws on the first three. The tail was deep from top to bottom. A row of small osteoderms (skin bones) was present down the middle of the neck, back, and tail. Additional osteoderms were present at unknown positions on the animal&#x27;s body.

&quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; gives its name to Ceratosauria, a clade of theropod dinosaurs that diverged early on from the evolutionary lineage leading to modern birds. Within Ceratosauria, some paleontologists proposed it to be most closely related to &quot;Genyodectes&quot; from Argentina, which shares the strongly elongated teeth. The geologically older genus &quot;Proceratosaurus&quot; from England, although originally described as a presumed antecedent of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, was later found to be an early tyrannosauroid. &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; shared its habitat with other large theropod genera, including &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; and &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, and it has been suggested that these theropods occupied different ecological niches to reduce competition. &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; may have preyed upon plant-eating dinosaurs, although some paleontologists suggested that it hunted aquatic prey such as fish. The nasal horn was probably not used as a weapon as was originally suggested by Marsh, but more likely was used solely for display.

==History of discovery==
===Holotype specimen of &quot;C. nasicornis&quot;===

The first specimen, holotype USNM 4735, was discovered and excavated by farmer Marshall Parker Felch in 1883 and 1884. Found in articulation, with the bones still connected to each other, it was nearly complete, including the skull. Significant missing parts include an unknown number of vertebrae, all but the last ribs of the trunk, the humeri (upper arm bones), the distal finger bones of both hands, most of the right arm, most of the left leg, and most of the feet. The specimen was found encased in hard sandstone, leading to the skull and spine being heavily distorted during fossilization. The site of discovery, located in the Garden Park area north of Cañon City, Colorado, and known as the Felch Quarry 1, is regarded as one of the richest fossil sites of the Morrison Formation. Numerous dinosaur fossils had been recovered from this quarry even before the discovery of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, most notably a nearly complete specimen of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; (USNM 4734) in 1883 and 1884.

After excavation, the specimen was shipped to the Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven, where it was studied by Marsh, who described it as the new genus and species &quot;Ceratosaurus nasicornis&quot; in 1884. The name &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; may be translated as &quot;horn lizard&quot; (from the Greek words , &quot; &quot;—&quot;horn&quot; and /&quot;&quot;—&quot;lizard&quot;) and &quot;nasicornis&quot; with &quot;nose horn&quot; (from the Latin words &quot;nasus&quot;—&quot;nose&quot; and &quot;cornu&quot;—&quot;horn&quot;). Given the completeness of the specimen, the newly described genus was, at the time, the best-known theropod discovered in America. In 1898 and 1899, the specimen was transferred to the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, along with many other fossils originally described by Marsh. Only part of this material was fully prepared when it arrived in Washington. Subsequent preparation lasted from 1911 to the end of 1918. Packaging and shipment from New Haven to Washington caused some damage to the &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; specimen. In 1920, Charles Gilmore published an extensive redescription of this and the other theropod specimens received from New Haven, including the nearly complete &quot;Allosaurus&quot; specimen recovered from the same quarry.
In an 1892 paper, Marsh published the first skeletal reconstruction of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, which depicts the animal at in length and in height. As noted by Gilmore in 1920, the trunk was depicted much too long in this reconstruction, incorporating at least six dorsal vertebrae too many. This error was repeated in several subsequent publications, including the first life reconstruction, which was drawn in 1899 by Frank Bond under the guidance of Charles R. Knight, but not published until 1920. A more accurate life reconstruction, published in 1901, was produced by Joseph M. Gleeson, again under Knight&#x27;s supervision. The holotype was mounted by Gilmore in 1910 and 1911. Since then, it was exhibited at the National Museum of Natural History. Most early reconstructions show &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; in an upright posture, with the tail dragging on the ground. Gilmore&#x27;s mount of the holotype, in contrast, was very ahead of its time. Inspired by the upper thigh bones, which were found angled against the lower leg, he depicted the mount as a running animal with a horizontal posture and a tail that did not make contact with the ground. Because of the strong flattening of the fossils, Gilmore mounted the specimen, not as a free-standing skeleton, but as a bas-relief within an artificial wall. With the bones being partly embedded in a plaque, scientific access was limited. In the course of the renovation of the museum&#x27;s dinosaur exhibition between 2014 and 2019, the specimen was dismantled and freed from the encasing plaque. In the new exhibition, which was set to open in 2019, the mount was planned to be replaced by a free-standing cast and the original bones were to be stored in the museum collection to allow full access for scientists.

===Additional finds in North America===
After the discovery of the holotype of &quot;C. nasicornis&quot;, a significant &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; find was not made until the early 1960s, when paleontologist James Madsen and his team unearthed a fragmentary, disarticulated skeleton including the skull (UMNH VP 5278) in the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry of Utah. This find represents one of the largest-known &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; specimens. A second, articulated specimen including the skull (MWC 1) was discovered in 1976 by Thor Erikson, the son of paleontologist Lance Erikson, near Fruita, Colorado. A fairly complete specimen, it lacks lower jaws, forearms, and gastralia. The skull, although reasonably complete, was found disarticulated and is strongly flattened sideways. Although it was a large individual, it had not yet reached adult size, as indicated by unfused sutures between the skull bones. Scientifically accurate three-dimensional reconstructions of the skull for use in museum exhibits were produced using a complicated process including molding and casting of the individual original bones, correction of deformities, reconstruction of missing parts, assembly of the bone casts into their proper position, and painting to match the original color of the bones.

Both the Fruita and Cleveland-Lloyd specimens were described by Madsen and Samuel Paul Welles in a 2000 monograph, with the Utah specimen being assigned to the new species &quot;C. dentisulcatus&quot; and the Colorado specimen being assigned to the new species &quot;C. magnicornis&quot;. The name &quot;dentisulcatus&quot; refers to the parallel grooves present on the inner sides of the premaxillary teeth and the first three teeth of the lower jaw in that specimen. &quot;Magnicornis&quot; points to the larger nasal horn. The validity of both species, however, was questioned in subsequent publications. Brooks Britt and colleagues, in 2000, claimed that the &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; holotype was in fact a juvenile individual, with the two larger species representing the adult state of a single species. Oliver Rauhut, in 2003, and Matthew Carrano and Scott Sampson, in 2008, considered the anatomical differences cited by Madsen and Welles to support these additional species to represent ontogenetic (age-related) or individual variation.

A further specimen (BYUVP 12893) was discovered in 1992 in the Agate Basin Quarry southeast of Moore, Utah, but still awaits description. The specimen, considered the largest known from the genus, includes the front half of a skull, seven fragmentary pelvic dorsal vertebrae, and an articulated pelvis and sacrum. In 1999, Britt reported the discovery of a &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; skeleton belonging to a juvenile individual. Discovered in Bone Cabin Quarry in Wyoming, it is 34% smaller than the &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; holotype and consists of a complete skull as well as 30% of the remainder of the skeleton including a complete pelvis.

Besides these five skeletal finds, fragmentary &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; remains have been reported from various localities from stratigraphic zones 2 and 4-6 of the Morrison Formation, including some of the major fossil sites of the formation. Dinosaur National Monument, Utah, yielded an isolated right premaxilla (DNM 972). A large shoulder blade (scapulocoracoid) was reported from Como Bluff in Wyoming. Another specimen stems from the Dry Mesa Quarry of Colorado and includes a left scapulocoracoid, as well as fragments of vertebrae and limb bones. In Mygatt Moore Quarry, Colorado, the genus is known from teeth.

===Finds outside North America===
From 1909 to 1913, German expeditions of the Berlin Museum für Naturkunde uncovered a diverse dinosaur fauna from the Tendaguru Formation in German East Africa, in what is now Tanzania. Although commonly considered the most important African dinosaur locality, large theropod dinosaurs are only known through few and very fragmentary remains. In 1920, German paleontologist Werner Janensch assigned several dorsal vertebrae from the quarry &quot;TL&quot; to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, as &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; sp. (of uncertain species). In 1925, Janensch named a new species of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, &quot;C. roechlingi&quot;, based on fragmentary remains from the quarry &quot;Mw&quot; encompassing a quadrate bone, a fibula, fragmentary caudal vertebrae, and other fragments. This specimen stems from an individual substantially larger than the &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; holotype.
In their 2000 monograph, Madsen and Welles confirmed the assignment of these finds to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. In addition, they ascribed several teeth to the genus, which had originally been described by Janensch as a possible species of &quot;Labrosaurus&quot;, &quot;Labrosaurus&quot; (?) &quot;stechowi&quot;. Other authors questioned the assignment of any of the Tendaguru finds to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, noting that none of these specimens displays features diagnostic for that genus. In 2011, Rauhut found both &quot;C. roechlingi&quot; and &quot;Labrosaurus&quot; (?) &quot;stechowi&quot; to be possible ceratosaurids, but found them to be undiagnostic at genus level and designated them as &quot;nomina dubia&quot; (doubtful names). In 1990, Timothy Rowe and Jacques Gauthier mentioned yet another &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; species from Tendaguru, &quot;Ceratosaurus ingens&quot;, which purportedly was erected by Janensch in 1920 and was based on 25 isolated, very large teeth up to in length. However, Janensch assigned this species to &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, not to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. Therefore, this name might be a simple copying error. Rauhut, in 2011, showed that &quot;Megalosaurus ingens&quot; was not closely related to either &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; or &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, but possibly represents a carcharodontosaurid instead.

In 2000 and 2006, paleontologists led by Octávio Mateus described a find from the Lourinhã Formation of central-west Portugal (ML 352) as a new specimen of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, consisting of a right femur (upper thigh bone), a left tibia (shin bone), and several isolated teeth recovered from the cliffs of Valmitão beach, between the municipalities of Lourinhã and Torres Vedras. The bones were found embedded in yellow to brown, fine-grained sandstones, which were deposited by rivers as floodplain deposits and belong to the lower levels of the Porto Novo Member, which is thought to be late Kimmeridgian in age. Additional bones of this individual (SHN (JJS)-65), including a left femur, a right tibia, and a partial left fibula (calf bone), were since exposed due to progressing cliff erosion. Although initially part of a private collection, these additional elements became officially curated after the private collection was donated to the Sociedade de História Natural in Torres Vedras and were described in detail in 2015. The specimen was ascribed to the species &quot;Ceratosaurus dentisulcatus&quot; by Mateus and colleagues in 2006. A 2008 review by Carrano and Sampson confirmed the assignment to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, but concluded that the assignment to any specific species is not possible at present. In 2015, Elisabete Malafaia and colleagues, who questioned the validity of &quot;C. dentisulcatus&quot;, assigned the specimen to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; aff. &quot;Ceratosaurus nasicornis&quot;.

Other reports include a single tooth found in Moutier, Switzerland. Originally named by Janensch in 1920 as &quot;Labrosaurus meriani&quot;, the tooth was later assigned &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; sp. (of unknown species) by Madsen and Welles. In 2008, Matías Soto and Daniel Perea described teeth from the Tacuarembó Formation in Uruguay, including a presumed premaxillary tooth crown. This shows vertical striations on its inner side and lacks denticles on its front edge. These features are, in this combination, only known from &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. The authors, however, stressed that an assignment to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; is infeasible because the remains are scant and note that the assignment of the European and African material to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; has to be viewed with caution. In 2020, Soto and colleagues described additional &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; teeth from the same formation that further support their earlier interpretation.

==Description==
&quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; followed the body plan typical for large theropod dinosaurs. As a biped, it moved on powerful legs, while its arms were reduced in size. Specimen USNM 4735, the first discovered skeleton and holotype of &quot;Ceratosaurus nasicornis&quot;, was an individual or long according to separate sources. Whether this animal was fully grown is unclear. Othniel Charles Marsh, in 1884, suggested that this specimen weighed about half as much as the contemporary &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. In more recent accounts, this was revised to , , or . Three additional skeletons discovered in the latter half of the 20th century were substantially larger. The first of these, UMNH VP 5278, was estimated by James Madsen to have been around long, but was later estimated at long. Its weight was calculated at , , and in separate works. The second skeleton, MWC 1, was somewhat smaller than UMNH VP 5278 and might have weighed . The third, yet undescribed, specimen BYUVP 12893 was claimed to be the largest yet discovered, although estimates have not been published. Another specimen, ML 352, discovered in Portugal in 2000, was estimated at in length and .

===Skull===

The skull was quite large in proportion to the rest of its body. It measures in length in the &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; holotype, measured from the tip of the snout to the , which connects to the first cervical vertebra. The width of this skull is difficult to reconstruct, as it is heavily distorted, and Gilmore&#x27;s 1920 reconstruction was later found to be too wide. The fairly complete skull of specimen MWC 1 was estimated to have been long and wide. This skull was somewhat more elongated than that of the holotype. The back of the skull was more lightly built than in some other larger theropods due to extensive skull openings, yet the jaws were deep to support the proportionally large teeth. The lacrimal bone formed not only the back margin of the antorbital fenestra, a large opening between eye and , but also part of its upper margin, unlike in members of the related Abelisauridae. The quadrate bone, which was connected to the lower jaw at its bottom end to form the jaw joint, was inclined so that the jaw joint was displaced backwards in relation to the occipital condyle. This also led to a broadening of the base of the lateral temporal fenestra, a large opening behind the eyes.

The most distinctive feature was a prominent horn situated on the skull midline behind the bony nostrils, which was formed from fused protuberances of the left and right nasal bones. Only the bony horn core is known from fossils. In the living animal, this core would have supported a keratinous sheath. While the base of the horn core was smooth, its upper two-thirds were wrinkled and lined with grooves that would have contained blood vessels when alive. In the holotype, the horn core is long and wide at its base, but quickly narrows to only further up, and is in height. It is longer and lower in the skull of MWC 1. In the living animal, the horn would likely have been more elongated due to its keratinous sheath. Behind the nasal horn, the nasal bones formed an ovalur groove. Both this groove and the nasal horn serve as features to distinguish &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; from related genera. In addition to the large nasal horn, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; possessed smaller, semicircular, bony ridges in front of each eye, similar to those of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. These ridges were formed by the lacrimal bones. In juveniles, all three horns were smaller than in adults and the two halves of the nasal horn core were not yet fused.
The premaxillary bones, which formed the tip of the snout, contained merely three teeth on each side, less than in most other theropods. The of the upper jaw were lined with 15 blade-like teeth on each side in the holotype. The first eight of these teeth were very long and robust, but from the ninth tooth onward, they gradually decrease in size. As is typical for theropods, they featured finely edges, which contained some 10 denticles per in the holotype. Specimen MWC 1 merely showed 11 to 12 and specimen UMNH VP 5278 showed 12 teeth in each maxilla. The teeth were more robust and more recurved in the latter specimen. In all specimens, the tooth crowns of the upper jaws were exceptionally long. In specimen UMNH VP 5278, they measured up to long, which is equal to the minimum height of the lower jaw. In the holotype, they are in length, which even surpasses the minimum height of the lower jaw. In other theropods, a comparable tooth length is only known from the possibly closely related &quot;Genyodectes&quot;. In contrast, several members of Abelisauridae feature very short tooth crowns. In the holotype, each half of the , the tooth-bearing bone of the , was equipped with 15 teeth, which are, however, poorly preserved. Both specimens MWC 1 and UMNH VP 5278 show only 11 teeth in each dentary, which were, as shown by the latter specimen, slightly straighter and less sturdy than those of the upper jaw.

===Postcranial skeleton===

The exact number of vertebrae is unknown due to several gaps in the spine of the &quot;Ceratosaurus nasicornis&quot; holotype. At least 20 vertebrae formed the neck and back in front of the sacrum. In the middle portion of the neck, the (bodies) of the vertebrae were as long as they were tall, while in the front and rear portions of the neck, the centra were shorter than their height. The upwards projecting were comparatively large and, in the dorsal (back) vertebrae, were as tall as the vertebral centra were long. The sacrum, consisting of six fused , was arched upwards, with its vertebral centra strongly reduced in height in its middle portion, as is the case in some other ceratosaurians. The tail comprised around 50 and was about half of the animal&#x27;s total length. In the holotype, it was estimated at . The tail was deep from top to bottom due to its high neural spines and elongated chevrons, bones located below the vertebral centra. As in other dinosaurs, it counterbalanced the body and contained the massive caudofemoralis muscle, which was responsible for forward thrust during locomotion, pulling the upper thigh backwards when contracted.
The scapula (shoulder blade) was fused with the coracoid, forming a single bone without any visible demarcation between the two original elements. The &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; holotype was found with an articulated left arm including an incomplete hand. Although during preparation, a cast had been made of the fossil beforehand to document the original relative positions of the bones. Carpal bones were not known from any specimen, leading some authors to suggest that they were lost in the genus. In a 2016 paper, Matthew Carrano and Jonah Choiniere suggested that one or more cartilaginous (not bony) carpals were probably present, as indicated by a gap present between the forearm bones and the metacarpals, as well as by the surface texture within this gap seen in the cast. In contrast to most more-derived theropods, which showed only three digits on each hand (digits I–III), &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; retained four digits, with digit IV being reduced in size. The first and fourth metacarpals were short, while the second was slightly longer than the third. The metacarpus and especially the first phalanges were proportionally very short, unlike in most other basal theropods. Only the first phalanges of digits II, III, and IV are preserved in the holotype. The total number of phalanges and unguals (claw bones) is unknown. The anatomy of metacarpal I indicates that phalanges had originally been present on this digit as well. The pes (foot) consisted of three weight-bearing digits, numbered II–IV. Digit I, which in theropods is usually reduced to a dewclaw that does not touch the ground, is not preserved in the holotype. Marsh, in his original 1884 description, assumed that this digit was lost in &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, but Charles Gilmore, in his 1920 monograph, noted an attachment area on the second metatarsal demonstrating the presence of this digit.

Uniquely among theropods, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; possessed small, elongated, and irregularly formed osteoderms (skin bones) along the midline of its body. Such osteoderms have been found above the neural spines of cervical vertebrae 4 and 5, as well as caudal vertebrae 4 to 10, and probably formed a continuous row that might have extended from the base of the skull to most of the tail. As suggested by Gilmore in 1920, their position in the rock matrix likely reflects their exact position in the living animal. The osteoderms above the tail were found separated from the neural spines by to , possibly accounting for skin and muscles present in between, while those of the neck were much closer to the neural spines. Apart from the body midline, the skin contained additional osteoderms, as indicated by a by large, roughly quadrangular plate found together with the holotype. The position of this plate on the body, however, is unknown. Specimen UMNH VP 5278 was also found with a number of osteoderms, which have been described as amorphous in shape. Although most of these were found at most 5 m apart from the skeleton, they were not directly associated with any vertebrae, unlike in the &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; holotype, so their original position on the body cannot be inferred from this specimen.

==Classification==

In his original description of the &quot;Ceratosaurus nasicornis&quot; holotype and subsequent publications, Marsh noted a number of characteristics that were unknown in all other theropods known at the time. Two of these features, the fused pelvis and fused metatarsus, were known from modern-day birds and, according to Marsh, clearly demonstrate the close relationship between the latter and dinosaurs. To set the genus apart from &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, and coelurosaurs, Marsh made &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; the only member of both a new family, Ceratosauridae, and a new infraorder, Ceratosauria. This was questioned in 1892 by Edward Drinker Cope, Marsh&#x27;s archrival in the Bone Wars, who argued that distinctive features such as the nasal horn merely showed that &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; was a distinct species, but were insufficient to justify a distinct genus. Consequently, he assigned &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; to the genus &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, creating the new combination &quot;Megalosaurus nasicornis&quot;.

Although &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; was retained as a distinct genus in all subsequent analyses, its relationships remained controversial during the following century. Both Ceratosauridae and Ceratosauria were not widely accepted, with only few and poorly known additional members identified. Over the years, separate authors classified &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; within Deinodontidae, Megalosauridae, Coelurosauria, Carnosauria, and Deinodontoidea. In his 1920 revision, Gilmore argued that the genus was the most basal theropod known from after the Triassic, being not that closely related to any other contemporary theropod known at that time. It thus warrants its own family: Ceratosauridae. It was not until the establishment of cladistic analysis in the 1980s, however, that Marsh&#x27;s original claim of Ceratosauria as a distinct group gained ground. In 1985, the newly discovered South American genera &quot;Abelisaurus&quot; and &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; were found to be closely related to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. Gauthier, in 1986, recognized Coelophysoidea to be closely related to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, although this clade falls outside of Ceratosauria in most recent analyses. Many additional members of Ceratosauria have been recognized since then.

Ceratosauria split off early from the evolutionary line leading to modern birds and is considered basal within theropods. Ceratosauria itself contains a group of derived (nonbasal) members of the families Noasauridae and Abelisauridae, which are bracketed within the clade Abelisauroidea, as well as a number of basal members, such as &quot;Elaphrosaurus&quot;, &quot;Deltadromeus&quot;, and &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. The position of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; within basal ceratosaurians is under debate. Some analyses considered &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; as the most derived of the basal members, forming the sister taxon of Abelisauroidea. Oliver Rauhut, in 2004, proposed &quot;Genyodectes&quot; as the sister taxon of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, as both genera are characterized by exceptionally long teeth in the upper jaw. Rauhut grouped &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and &quot;Genyodectes&quot; within the family Ceratosauridae, which was followed by several later accounts.

Shuo Wang and colleagues, in 2017, concluded that Noasauridae were not nested within Abelisauroidea as was previously assumed, but instead were more basal than &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. Because noasaurids had been used as a fix point to define the clades Abelisauroidea and Abelisauridae, these clades would consequently include many more taxa per definition, including &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. In a subsequent 2018 study, Rafael Delcourt accepted these results, but pointed out that, as a consequence, Abelisauroidea would need to be replaced by the older synonym Ceratosauroidea, which was hitherto rarely used. For Abelisauridae, Delcourt proposed a new definition that excludes &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, allowing for using the name in its traditional sense. Wang and colleagues furthermore found that &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and &quot;Genyodectes&quot; form a clade with the Argentinian genus &quot;Eoabelisaurus&quot;. Delcourt used the name Ceratosauridae to refer to this same clade, and suggested to define Ceratosauridae as containing all taxa that are more closely related to &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; than to the abelisaurid &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;.
The following cladogram showing the relationships of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; is based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Diego Pol and Oliver Rauhut in 2012:

A skull from the Middle Jurassic of England apparently displays a nasal horn similar to that of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. In 1926, Friedrich von Huene described this skull as &quot;Proceratosaurus&quot; (meaning &quot;before &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;&quot;), assuming that it was an antecedent of the Late Jurassic &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. Today, &quot;Proceratosaurus&quot; is considered a basal member of Tyrannosauroidea, a much more derived clade of theropod dinosaurs. The nasal horn would have had evolved independently in both genera. Oliver Rauhut and colleagues, in 2010, grouped &quot;Proceratosaurus&quot; within its own family, Proceratosauridae. These authors also noted that the nasal horn is incompletely preserved, opening the possibility that it represented the foremost portion of a more extensive head crest, as seen in some other proceratosaurids such as &quot;Guanlong&quot;.

==Paleobiology==
===Ecology and feeding===

Within the Morrison and Lourinhã Formation, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; fossils are frequently found in association with those of other large theropods, including the megalosaurid &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; and the allosaurid &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. The Garden Park locality in Colorado contained, besides &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, fossils attributed to &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. The Dry Mesa Quarry in Colorado, as well as the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry and the Dinosaur National Monument in Utah, feature, respectively, the remains of at least three large theropods: &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;. Likewise, Como Bluff and nearby localities in Wyoming contained remains of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, and at least one large megalosaurid. &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; was a rare element of the theropod fauna, as it is outnumbered by &quot;Allosaurus&quot; at an average rate of 7.5 to 1 in sites where they co-occur.

Several studies attempted to explain how these sympatric species could have reduced direct competition. Donald Henderson, in 1998, argued that &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; co-occurred with two separate potential species of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, which he denoted as &quot;morphs&quot;: a morph with a shortened snout, a high and wide skull, and short, backwards-projecting teeth, and a morph characterized by a longer snout, lower skull, and long, vertical teeth. Generally speaking, the greater the similarity between sympatric species regarding their morphology, physiology, and behavior, the more intense competition between these species will be. Henderson came to the conclusion that the short-snouted &quot;Allosaurus&quot; morph occupied a different ecological niche from both the long-snouted morph and &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. The shorter skull in this morph would have reduced bending moments occurring during biting, thus increased bite force, comparable to the condition seen in cats. &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and the other &quot;Allosaurus&quot; morph, though, had long-snouted skulls, which are better compared to those of dogs. The longer teeth would have been used as fangs to deliver quick, slashing bites, with the bite force concentrated at a smaller area due to the narrower skull. According to Henderson, the great similarities in skull shape between &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and the long-snouted &quot;Allosaurus&quot; morph indicate that these forms engaged in direct competition with each other. Therefore, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; might have been pushed out of habitats dominated by the long-snouted morph. Indeed, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; is very rare in the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry, which contains the long-snouted &quot;Allosaurus&quot; morph, but appears to be more common in both Garden Park and the Dry Mesa Quarry, in which it co-occurs with the short-snouted morph.

Furthermore, Henderson suggested that &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; could have avoided competition by preferring different prey items. The evolution of its extremely elongated teeth might have been a direct result of the competition with the long-snouted &quot;Allosaurus&quot; morph. Both species could also have preferred different parts of carcasses when acting as scavengers. The elongated teeth of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; could have served as visual signals facilitating the recognition of members of the same species or for other social functions. In addition, the large size of these theropods would have tended to decrease competition, as the number of possible prey items increases with size.

Foster and Daniel Chure, in a 2006 study, concurred with Henderson that &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and &quot;Allosaurus&quot; generally shared the same habitats and preyed upon the same types of prey, meaning they likely had different feeding strategies to avoid competition. According to these researchers, this is also evidenced by different proportions of the skull, teeth, and arms. The distinction between the two &quot;Allosaurus&quot; morphs, however, was questioned by some later studies. Kenneth Carpenter, in a 2010 study, found that short-snouted individuals of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry represent cases of extreme individual variation rather than a separate taxon. Furthermore, the skull of USNM 4734 from the Garden Park locality, which formed the basis for Henderson&#x27;s analysis of the short-snouted morph, was later found to have been reconstructed too short.

In a 2004 study, Robert Bakker and Gary Bir suggested that &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; was primarily specialized in aquatic prey such as lungfish, crocodiles, and turtles. As indicated by a statistical analysis of shed teeth from 50 separate localities in and around Como Bluff, teeth of both &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and megalosaurids were most common in habitats in and around water sources such as wet floodplains, lake margins, and swamps. &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; also occasionally occurred in terrestrial localities. Allosaurids, however, were equally common in terrestrial and aquatic habitats. From these results, Bakker and Bir concluded that &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and megalosaurids must have predominantly hunted near and within water bodies, with &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; also feeding on carcasses of larger dinosaurs on occasion. The researchers furthermore noted the long, low, and flexible body of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and megalosaurids. Compared to other Morrison theropods, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; showed taller neural spines on the foremost tail vertebrae, which were vertical rather than inclined towards the back. Together with the deep chevron bones on the underside of the tail, they indicate a deep, &quot;crocodile-like&quot; tail possibly adapted for swimming. On the contrary, allosaurids feature a shorter, taller, and stiffer body with longer legs. They would have been adapted for rapid running in open terrain and for preying upon large herbivorous dinosaurs such as sauropods and stegosaurs, but as speculated by Bakker and Bir, seasonally switched to aquatic prey items when the large herbivores were absent. However, this theory was challenged by Yun in 2019, suggesting &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; was merely more capable of hunting aquatic prey than other theropods of the Morrison Formation as opposed to being fully semiaquatic.
In his 1986 popular book &quot;The Dinosaur Heresies&quot;, Bakker argued that the bones of the upper jaw were only loosely attached to the surrounding skull bones, allowing for some degree of movement within the skull, a condition termed cranial kinesis. Likewise, the bones of the lower jaw would have been able to move against each other and the quadrate bone could swing outwards, spreading the lower jaw at the jaw joint. Taken together, these features would have allowed the animal to widen its jaws in order to swallow larger food items. In a 2008 study, Casey Holliday and Lawrence Witmer re-evaluated similar claims made for other dinosaurs, concluding that the presence of muscle-powered cranial kinesis cannot be proven for any dinosaur species and was likely absent in most.

An &quot;Allosaurus&quot; pubic foot shows marks by the teeth of another theropod, probably &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; or &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs) and the fact that it was among the most massive in the skeleton indicates that the &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was being scavenged. A bone assemblage in the Upper Jurassic Mygatt-Moore Quarry preserves an unusually high occurrence of theropod bite marks, most of which can be attributed to &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, while others could have been made by a large allosaurid or &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; given the size of the striations. While the position of the bite marks on the herbivorous dinosaurs is consistent with predation or early access to remains, bite marks found on &quot;Allosaurus&quot; material suggest scavenging, either from the other theropods or from another &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. The unusually high concentration of theropod bite marks compared to other assemblages could be explained either by a more complete utilization of resources during a dry season by theropods or by a collecting bias in other localities.

===Function of the nasal horn and osteoderms===
In 1884, Marsh considered the nasal horn of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; to be a &quot;most powerful weapon&quot; for both offensive and defensive purposes and Gilmore, in 1920, concurred with this interpretation. The use of the horn as a weapon is now generally considered unlikely. In 1985, David Norman believed that the horn was &quot;probably not for protection against other predators,&quot; but might instead have been used for intraspecific combat among male ceratosaurs contending for breeding rights. Gregory S. Paul, in 1988, suggested a similar function and illustrated two &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; engaged in a nonlethal butting contest. In 1990, Rowe and Gauthier went further, suggesting that the nasal horn of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; was &quot;probably used for display purposes alone&quot; and played no role in physical confrontations. If used for display, the horn likely would have been brightly colored. A display function was also proposed for the row of osteoderms running down the body midline.

===Forelimb function===

The strongly shortened metacarpals and phalanges of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; raise the question as to whether the hand retained the grasping function assumed for other basal theropods. Within Ceratosauria, an even more extreme hand reduction can be observed in abelisaurids, where the arm lost its original function, and in &quot;Limusaurus&quot;. In a 2016 paper on the anatomy of the &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; hand, Carrano and Jonah Choiniere stressed the great morphological similarity of the hand with those of other basal theropods, suggesting that it still fulfilled its original grasping function, despite its shortening. Although only the first phalanges are preserved, the second phalanges would have been mobile, as indicated by the well-developed articular surfaces, and the digits would likely have allowed a similar degree of motion as in other basal theropods. As in other theropods other than abelisaurids, the first digit would have been slightly turned in when flexed.

===Brain and senses===

A cast of the brain cavity of the holotype was made under Marsh&#x27;s supervision, probably during preparation of the skull, allowing Marsh to conclude that the brain &quot;was of medium size, but comparatively much larger than in the herbivorous dinosaurs&quot;. The skull bones, however, had been cemented together afterwards, so the accuracy of this cast could not be verified by later studies.

A second, well preserved braincase had been found with specimen MWC 1 in Fruita, Colorado, and was CT-scanned by paleontologists Kent Sanders and David Smith, allowing for reconstructions of the inner ear, gross regions of the brain, and cranial sinuses transporting blood away from the brain. In 2005, the researchers concluded that &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; possessed a brain cavity typical for basal theropods and similar to that of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. The impressions for the olfactory bulbs, which house the sense of smell, are well-preserved. While similar to those of &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, they were smaller than in &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, which is thought to have been equipped with a very keen sense of smell. The semicircular canals, which are responsible for the sense of balance and therefore allow for inferences on habitual head orientation and locomotion, are similar to those found in other theropods. In theropods, these structures are generally conservative, suggesting that functional requirements during locomotion have been similar across species. The foremost of the semicircular canals was enlarged, a feature generally found in bipedal animals. The orientation of the lateral semicircular canal indicates that the head and neck were held horizontally in neutral position.

===Fusion of metatarsals and paleopathology===
The holotype of &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; was found with its left metatarsals II to IV fused together. Marsh, in 1884, dedicated a short article to this, at the time, unknown feature in dinosaurs, noting the close resemblance to the condition seen in modern birds. The presence of this feature in &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; became controversial in 1890, when Georg Baur speculated that the fusion in the holotype was the result of a healed fracture. This claim was repeated in 1892 by Cope, while arguing that &quot;C. nasicornis&quot; should be classified as a species of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; due to insufficient anatomical differences between these genera. However, examples of fused metatarsals in dinosaurs that are not of pathological origin have been described since, including taxa more basal than &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. Osborn, in 1920, explained that no abnormal bone growth is evident and that the fusion is unusual, but likely not pathological. Ronald Ratkevich, in 1976, argued that this fusion had limited the running ability of the animal, but this claim was rejected by Paul in 1988, who noted that the same feature occurs in many fast-moving animals of today, including ground birds and ungulates. A 1999 analysis by Darren Tanke and Bruce Rothschild suggested that the fusion was indeed pathological, confirming the earlier claim of Baur. Other reports of pathologies include a stress fracture in a foot bone assigned to the genus, as well as a broken tooth of an unidentified species of &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; that shows signs of further wear received after the break.

==Paleoenvironment and paleobiogeography==

All North American &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; finds come from the Morrison Formation, a sequence of shallow marine and (predominantly) alluvial sedimentary rocks in the western United States and the most fertile source for dinosaur bones of the continent. According to radiometric dating, the age of the formation ranges between 156.3 million years old at its base and 146.8 million years old at the top, which places it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic. &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; is known from Kimmeridgian and Tithonian strata of the formation. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan, being formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania.

The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. Other dinosaurs known from the Morrison include the theropods &quot;Koparion&quot;, &quot;Stokesosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ornitholestes&quot;, &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;, the sauropods &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;, &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, and &quot;Diplodocus,&quot; and the ornithischians &quot;Camptosaurus&quot;, &quot;Dryosaurus&quot;, &quot;Nanosaurus&quot;, &quot;Gargoyleosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;. &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, which accounted for 70 to 75% of all theropod specimens, was at the top trophic level of the Morrison food web. Other vertebrates that shared this paleoenvironment included ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles like &quot;Uluops&quot;, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphs such as &quot;Hoplosuchus&quot;, and several species of pterosaurs such as &quot;Harpactognathus&quot; and &quot;Mesadactylus&quot;. Shells of bivalves and aquatic snails are also common. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns and ferns (gallery forests) to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the &quot;Araucaria&quot;-like conifer &quot;Brachyphyllum&quot;.

A partial &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; specimen indicates the presence of the genus in the Portuguese Porto Novo Member of the Lourinhã Formation. Many of the dinosaurs of the Lourinhã Formation are either the same genera as those seen in the Morrison Formation or have a close counterpart. Besides &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, the researchers also noted that the presence of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; in the Portuguese rocks are primarily known from the Morrison, while &quot;Lourinhanosaurus&quot; has so far only been reported from Portugal. Herbivorous dinosaurs from the Porto Novo Member include, among others, the sauropods &quot;Dinheirosaurus&quot; and &quot;Zby&quot;, as well as the stegosaur &quot;Miragaia&quot;. During the Late Jurassic, Europe had just been separated from North America by the still narrow Atlantic Ocean. Portugal, as part of the Iberian Peninsula, was still separated from other parts of Europe. According to Mateus and colleagues, the similarity between the Portuguese and North American theropod faunas indicates the presence of a temporary land bridge, allowing for faunal interchange. Malafaia and colleagues, however, argued for a more complex scenario, as other groups, such as sauropods, turtles, and crocodiles, show clearly different species compositions in Portugal and North America. Thus, the incipient separation of these faunas could have led to interchange in some but allopatric speciation in other groups.

<text>Efim Isaakovich Zelmanov (; born 7 September 1955) is a Russian-American mathematician, known for his work on combinatorial problems in nonassociative algebra and group theory, including his solution of the restricted Burnside problem. He was awarded a Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich in 1994.

== Biography ==

Zelmanov was born on 7 September 1955 into a Jewish family in Khabarovsk. He entered Novosibirsk State University in 1972, when he was 17 years old. He obtained a doctoral degree at Novosibirsk State University in 1980, and a higher degree at Leningrad State University in 1985. He had a position in Novosibirsk until 1987, when he left the Soviet Union.In 1990, he moved to the United States, becoming a professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He was at the University of Chicago in 1994/5, then at Yale University. In 1996, he became a Distinguished Professor at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study and in 2002, he became a professor at the University of California, San Diego. In 2011 he got hon DSc from QUB (Belfast)

In 2022, he moved to the People&#x27;s Republic of China and joined the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China. He served as a chair professor and the scientific director of the SUSTech International Center for Mathematics.

Zelmanov was elected a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2001, becoming, at the age of 47, the youngest member of the mathematics section of the academy. He is also an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1996) and a foreign member of the Korean Academy of Science and Technology and of the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences. In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

Zelmanov gave invited talks at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Warsaw (1983), Kyoto (1990) and Zurich (1994). He delivered the 2004 Turán Memorial Lectures. He was awarded Honorary Doctor degrees from the University of Hagen, Germany (1997), the University of Alberta, Canada (2011), Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Ukraine (2012), the Universidad Internacional Menéndez Pelayo in Santander, Spain (2015) and the University of Lincoln, UK (2016).

Zelmanov&#x27;s early work was on Jordan algebras in the case of infinite dimensions. He was able to show that Glennie&#x27;s identity in a certain sense generates all identities that hold. He then showed that the Engel identity for Lie algebras implies nilpotence, in the case of infinite dimensions.

<text>is a Japanese &quot;rekishi monogatari&quot;. It is believed to have been written in the around the onset of the Kamakura period . It has been credited to Nakayama Tadachika or Minamoto Masayori, but the actual writer is unknown. It is the third book of the four mirror series.

It deals with the oldest time-period, starting with the legendary Emperor Jimmu and ending with Emperor Ninmyō. It is told by a fictitious old woman who is visited by a bhikkhu while staying at Hase-dera. All the facts are taken from ca. 1150 by Kōen, the teacher of Hōnen.

&quot;Mizukagami&quot; refers to the reflective pool in Japanese gardens in which can be seen such things as bridges and cherry blossoms in its reflection.

<text>Linnart Mäll (7 June 1938 – 14 February 2010) was an Estonian historian, orientalist, translator and politician.

== Biography ==
Born in Tallinn, Estonia, Mäll graduated from the University of Tartu in 1962 with a major in general history. He followed graduation with postgraduate studies at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences at the USSR Academy of Sciences (1964–1966) and Department of History, University of Tartu (1966–1969); 1985 Cand. Hist. (PhD) in history, PhD thesis &quot;Ashtasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā &quot;as a Historical Source&quot;&quot;.

Since 1994 he was Head of the Centre for Oriental Studies, senior research fellow, Department of History, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Tartu. From 1969 to 1973 he served as lecturer of the Chair of General History at Tartu State University. Later he was dismissed for anti-communist views and subsequently worked for ten years as engineer of the Cabinet for Oriental Studies. He was partly rehabilitated in 1983 and promoted to head of the Laboratory for History and Semiotics (1983–1991). He later served as head of the Laboratory for Oriental Studies (1991–1994).

His main research fields included: Buddhist Mahāyāna texts, Buddhist mythology, classical Indian literature and culture, classical Chinese texts, Tibetan Buddhist texts and the history of small nations and peoples.

He was one of the first who applied the methods of semiotic analysis for investigation of Buddhist texts and other texts of classical Oriental thought. Mäll was one of the central figures of the branch of oriental studies in the Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School in 1960–70s. In the 1990s he worked on the elaboration of the conception of humanistic base texts; since 1998 the initiator and head of the research project &quot;Humanistic base texts in the history of mankind&quot;; and author of ten books and over one hundred academic articles.

Mäll was inspired to become a Buddhist and buddhologist by well-known Estonian theologian and philosopher Uku Masing in the early 1960s. He later studied under and worked together with several Buddhist and non-Buddhist teachers and scholars including Nikolai Konrad, Alexander Piatigorsky, Oktiabrina Volkova, Youri Parfionovich, Lev Menshikov and Lama Bidia Dandaron. He was a teacher and spiritual master for many Estonian Buddhists and orientalists of the younger generation. In the 1990s he established close ties with The Dalai Lama and served as the main organizer of both of his visits to Estonia (1991 and 2001). Mäll was the founder and director of the first Mahāyāna Institute (which existed from 1991 to 1994).

He was awarded the Order of the White Star, IV degree in 2001, and the Medal of Freedom of the Government of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in exile in March 2004.

Mäll died of cancer in Tartu on 14 February 2010.

<doc id="1104855" wikidata="Q4731928" url="?curid=1104855" title="Allen Upward">
<text>George Allen Upward (Worcester 20 September 1863 – Wimborne 12 November 1926) was a British poet, lawyer, politician and teacher.
His work was included in the first anthology of Imagist poetry, &quot;Des Imagistes&quot;, which was edited by Ezra Pound and published in 1914. He was a first cousin once removed of Edward Upward. His parents were George and Mary Upward, and he was survived by an elder sister (Mary) Edith Upward.

==Early life==
Upward was brought up as a member of the Plymouth Brethren and trained as a lawyer at the Royal University of Dublin (now University College Dublin). While living in Dublin, he wrote a pamphlet in favour of Irish Home Rule.

In the 1890s he lived in Cardiff where he worked as a lawyer, journalist and novelist. He also stood several times unsuccessfully as a candidate for both the Liberal and Labour party. He defended Havelock Wilson and other Labour leaders and ran for election as a Lib-Lab candidate, taking 659 votes in Merthyr at the 1895 general election.

Upward later worked for the British Foreign Office in Nigeria as an officer for the British Government.

==Literary career==
He wrote two books of poetry, &quot;Songs in Ziklag&quot; (1888) and &quot;Scented Leaves from a Chinese Jar&quot;. He also published a translation of the &quot;Sayings of Confucius&quot; (1904) and a volume of autobiography, &quot;Some Personalities&quot; (1921).

Upward wrote a number of now-forgotten novels: &quot;The Prince of Balkistan&quot; (1895), &quot;A Crown of Straw&quot; (1896), &quot;A Bride&#x27;s Madness&quot; (1897), &quot;The Accused Princess&quot; (1900) (source: Duncan, p. xii), &quot;&quot;The International Spy: Being a Secret History of the Russo-Japanese War&quot; (1905), and &quot;Athelstane Ford&quot;. His 1910 novel &quot;The Discovery of the Dead&quot; is a collected fantasy (listed in Bleiler) dealing with the emerging science of Necrology.

In 1907, Upward self-published a book (originally written in 1901) which he apparently thought would be Nobel Prize material: &quot;The New Word&quot;. This book is today known as the first citation of the word &quot;Scientology&quot;, however there was no delineation in this book of its definition by Upward. It is unknown whether L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Scientology-organization, knew of this book.
His 1913 book &quot;The Divine Mystery&quot; is an anthropological study of Christian mythology.

In 1917 the British Museum refused to take Upward&#x27;s manuscripts, &quot;on the grounds that the writer was still alive,&quot; and Upward burned them (source: Duncan, p. xi).

==Death==
Upward shot himself in the heart in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, in November 1926. Ezra Pound would a decade later satirically remark that this was due to his disappointment after hearing of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s Nobel Prize award which Shaw won in 1925.

==Reputation==
Upward&#x27;s reputation as an obscure genius, the hidden mastermind behind some of the most obscure thoughts of Ezra Pound and his fellow Imagists was made by two essays Pound wrote in 1913-14 and various mentions of Upward in his Cantos. In 1975 there was a brief flurry of interest in this view of Upward typified by Donald Davie&#x27;s piece on Upward in his attempt to revive sympathetic interest in Pound. In 1978 Mick Sheldon published an essay which demonstrated alongside his relationship with Pound Upward had a reputation as a popular novelist, lawyer, politician and local celebrity. Even more interesting were the discoveries Upward had influenced Edward Upward, to whom he was related, W. H. Auden whose poem the Orators refers to Allen&#x27;s suicide and Robert Duncan who wrote a lengthy introduction to The Divine Mystery.
Sheldon also revealed before Pound had begun championing the cause of Allen Upward&#x27;s genius, a woman philosopher called Victoria Welby had expressed the view Upward&#x27;s New Word was a significant contribution to modernist philosophy.

<text>Vigo Village is a village and (as simply Vigo) a civil parish in the Gravesham district in Kent, England. It takes its name from a 15th-century public house, which was renamed in the 18th century after the Battle of Vigo Bay. While a nearby hamlet named Vigo was recorded on an 18th-century map, the present village was built in the mid-20th century, on a site that was previously a disused World War II army camp. The civil parish was created on 1 April 2000 from the parish of Meopham.

The village is situated in the middle of chestnut woodland at the top of the North Downs, east of the road between Gravesend and Wrotham. Trosley Country Park lies immediately south of the village and forms part of the North Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In the 2001 census Vigo civil parish had a population of 2,201, reducing to 2,065 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
The Vigo Inn is reputed to date from 1471. It was renamed after the Battle of Vigo Bay, a naval battle fought in 1702 during the War of the Spanish Succession. An apocryphal story suggests that the inn was renamed by a man who bought it with the proceeds of war prizes gained during the battle.

Little is recorded about the area until the 1870s when Sir Sidney Waterlow purchased large areas of land including the village of Fairseat, a good proportion of Stansted, and land from Wrotham to Meopham. The parts of the estate were linked by a small bridge bearing the family crest over Trottiscliffe Road, which is still in evidence today. In 1887 he built Trosley Towers on the crest of the escarpment to the east of Trottiscliffe Road. It was approached by two drives and surrounded by wooded grounds. Other private drives were constructed, one of which is Hamilton Drive which still survives in Trosley Towers Country Park and runs from the site of the old house to Commority Road.

Sir Sidney died in 1906 and the estate passed to his son Sir Philip. When he died in 1931 the estate was sold off. Some of the houses, such as Pilgrims House at the bottom of Trottiscliffe Road, were bought by tenants. Trosley Towers and the woodlands were sold to Mr E. E. Shahmoon in 1935. During this time chalets were built in the area. In 1936 Mr Shahmoon had Trosley Towers demolished and built Hamilton Lodge and adjoining stables. One story suggests that the Lodge and stables were built to accommodate the Shah of Persia and his racehorses on his visits to England.

===Second World War===
In 1942 the area was taken over by the army. With the outbreak of war and the subsequent increase in size of the army, there was a need for large numbers of suitable candidates to train as officers. This training normally took place at an Officer Cadet Training Unit (OCTU) which was attached to the arm of the service in which the cadet would eventually serve. There were several OCTUs and therefore duplication of resources occurred and standards varied from unit to unit, so in the early part of 1942 it was decided to standardise the basic training and send all potential officer cadets to a pre-OCTU for up to eight weeks, before their attendance at their specialist OCTU. With a few exceptions, all officer cadets were required to attend the newly formed pre-OCTU Wrotham Camp, which was situated on what is now the site of Vigo Village. Training areas extended northwards through all of Happy Valley, almost to Meopham, and south to farmland beyond the Pilgrims Way. The site handled the majority of officers for the British Army for the next four years, handling up to 10,000 men at any one time.

The new camp was formed and administered by the 148th Independent Brigade Group, which became known as the 148th Training Brigade. Hamilton Lodge became the brigade&#x27;s headquarters. Permanent staff and instructors who lived in the area were allowed to return home at evenings and weekends whilst the remainder were either accommodated on the site or billeted in Meopham or Wrotham. Cadets were housed in Nissen huts. Training consisted of lectures and demonstrations in a variety of subjects, tactics, map reading, field craft, camouflage and the operation of a variety of weapons including grenades and mortars. Field craft areas close to the camp were in &#x27;Happy Valley&#x27; and night exercises took place in and around Luddesdown, Pilgrims Way, Addington and Ryarsh with a rifle range in the chalk pit, an assault course at the bottom of the escarpment and mortar and grenade ranges to the south of the Pilgrims Way. All instruction regarding vehicles was done at the D Wing [Driving and Maintenance]. The Wing had a large transport column of vehicles from 15cwt. trucks to 10 ton recovery vehicles plus hundreds of motor-cycles. The main motor pool was situated on what is now Vigo Rugby Club and motor cycle training was undertaken on a figure of eight course in the area of what is now Highview.

The camp continued to operate through to the early part of 1946 (the decision to abolish the brigade was taken on 8 April). Today little is left of what was at one time the largest pre-OCTU in the world. Only the outlines of some of the foundations in the surrounding woods, a concrete platform at the top of the escarpment which was a map reading point and a crumbling assault course wall at the bottom of the escarpment are now visible. Only one building remains, with its large, rusting double doors, it is situated behind Vigo School and was one of the motor transport garages. The only other reminder left today is in the name of one of the roads running through the village, Erskine Road, named after the Commanding Officer of the 148 Training Brigade from January 1943, and the Brigade HQ, Hamilton Lodge, on the Harvel Road.

===Post war===
With the departure of the army in 1946, the area was occupied by people who, for the most part, had lost everything during the Blitz. Here they found ready-made accommodation (in the form of Nissen Huts) and well-made roads, and soon a community formed. The presence of about 1000 people in the area prompted the councils of Strood, Gravesend, West Malling and Northfleet to improve conditions for the inhabitants: roads were improved, toilets installed, and the huts partitioned to provide three rooms. The council charged rent and the settlement became known as Vigo Village.

The old camp lecture hall, Erskine Hall (on what is now the School field), was still standing and served the community in a variety of forms and at one point it was used as a storage facility for props from the London Palladium.

A bus service was started along with a shopping centre, known as Piccadilly Circus. There was a library in Erskine Hall, and a doctor&#x27;s surgery in Henley Street nearby.

The stables at the back of Hamilton Lodge were used as a primary school from about 1948. Before this children attended Meopham and Culverstone schools. A scout group, the 17th Gravesend, was also started and run by the Church Army.

To the east of the site, on what was the old army motorcycle training course (now the area of Highview), was a caravan site.

By the late 1950s many of the residents were re-housed in nearby areas and the land was cleared to a certain extent. The land was then sold by Mr Shahmoon to Croudace Ltd, a property development company.

A purpose built primary school opened in 1972. A shopping centre was also built and the Villager pub opened in 1985.

==Transport==
Vigo is served by buses to Sevenoaks and Gravesend.

<doc id="1104874" wikidata="Q1780478" url="?curid=1104874" title="Self-reflection">
<text>Self-reflection is the ability to witness and evaluate one&#x27;s own cognitive, emotional, and behavioural processes. In psychology, other terms used for this self-observation include &quot;reflective awareness&quot; and &quot;reflective consciousness&quot;, which originate from the work of William James.

Self-reflection depends upon a range of functions, including introspection and metacognition, which develop from infancy through adolescence, affecting how individuals interact with others, and make decisions.

Self-reflection is related to the philosophy of consciousness, the topic of awareness, and the philosophy of mind.

The concept of self-reflection is ancient. More than 3,000 years ago, &quot;Know thyself&quot; was the first of three Delphic maxims inscribed in the forecourt of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. It is also considered a form of thought that generates new meaning and an opportunity to engage with what seemingly appears incongruous.

==History==

===Early writings===
Notions about the status of humanity may be revealed by the etymology of ancient words for humans. Latin &quot;homo&quot; (PIE &quot;*dʰǵʰm̥mō&quot;) means &quot;of the earth, earthling&quot;, probably in opposition to &quot;celestial&quot; beings. Greek (mycenaean &quot;*Anthropos&quot;) means &quot;low-eyed&quot;, again probably contrasting with a divine perspective.

From the third-millennium Old Kingdom of Egypt, belief in an eternal afterlife of the human ka is documented along with the notion that the actions of a person would be assessed to determine the quality of that existence. A claim of dominance of humanity alongside radical pessimism because of the frailty and brevity of human life is asserted in the Hebrew Bible Genesis 1:28, where dominion of humans is promised, but contrarily, King Solomon who is the alleged author of Ecclesiastes according to rabbinic tradition, bewails the vanity of all human effort.

===Classical antiquity===
Protagoras made the famous claim that humans are &quot;the measure of all things; of what is, that it is; of what is not, that it is not&quot;. Socrates advocated the ancient adage for all humans to &quot;Know thyself&quot;, and gave the (doubtlessly tongue-in-cheek) definition of humans as, &quot;featherless bipeds&quot; (Plato, &quot;Politicus&quot;). Aristotle described humans as the &quot;communal animal&quot; (ζῶον πολιτικόν), i.e., emphasizing society-building as a central trait of human nature, and being a &quot;thought bearer animal&quot; (, &quot;animal rationale&quot;) a term that also may have inspired the species taxonomy, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

===Middle Ages===
The dominant world-view of medieval Europe, as directed by the Catholic Church, was that human existence is essentially good and created in &quot;original grace&quot;, but because of concupiscence, is marred by sin, and that its aim should be to focus on a beatific vision after death. The term &quot;original grace&quot; is not a phrase directly derived by the Bible, but is used because it reflects the Catholic Church&#x27;s interpretation of humanity’s initial state before the Fall. According to St. Augustine, the Fall corrupted this &quot;original grace&quot; and therefore the nature of man. 

The thirteenth century pope Innocent III wrote about the essential misery of earthly existence in his &quot;On the misery of the human condition&quot;—a view that was disputed by, for example, Giannozzo Manetti in his treatise &quot;On human dignity&quot;.

===Renaissance===

A famous quote of Shakespeare&#x27;s Hamlet (II, ii, 115–117), expresses the contrast of human physical beauty, intellectual faculty, and ephemeral nature:

René Descartes famously and succinctly proposed: &quot;Cogito ergo sum&quot; (French: &quot;Je pense donc je suis&quot;&quot;; English: &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;), not an assessment of humanity, but certainly reflecting a capacity for reasoning as a characteristic of humans, that potentially, could include individual self-reflection.

===Modern era===
The Enlightenment was driven by a renewed conviction, that, in the words of Immanuel Kant, &quot;Man is distinguished above all animals by his self-consciousness, by which he is a &#x27;rational animal&#x27;.&quot; In conscious opposition to this tradition during the nineteenth century, Karl Marx defined humans as a &quot;labouring animal&quot; (&quot;animal laborans&quot;). In the early twentieth century, Sigmund Freud dealt a serious blow to positivism by postulating that, to a large part, human behaviour is controlled by the unconscious mind. Freud describes the unconscious mind as the part of the mind containing any repressed images or thoughts too taboo for societal norms. He viewed this part of the mind as essential to the individual as they are restrained primitive impulses and desires. Joseph Conrad uses the analogy of chemistry to describe how the tiniest idea can stimulate a person during reflection like a &quot;little drop precipitating the process of crystallization in a test tube containing a colourless solution&quot;.

Mandatory or advisory periods for reflection are built into some regulatory requirements, for example changes to divorce law in England and Wales adopted in 2022 prescribe a 20-week period of reflection before certain proceedings are concluded, and the European Union&#x27;s Mortgage Credit Directive allows for a seven-day period of reflection before a mortgage offer needs to be accepted.

==Impact==
Self-reflection is a process of communicating internally with oneself. When one takes time to think about their character or behavior, they analyze the reasons that caused the behavior, where this comes from, what the outcome of the behavior means to them, is it effective for them and what they can do about it. Individuals process this information about themselves to help them find methods to deal with the information gained during the self-reflection process and applying this information to future behavior has been shown to elicit strength and joy.

Self-reflection helps people in multiple ways:

First, self-reflection fortifies an individual&#x27;s emotional stability. When setting aside some effort to self-reflect they are looking inwards. This assists with building two parts to their emotional intelligence: self-awareness and self-concept. Self-awareness enables a person to comprehend their feelings, qualities, shortcomings, drives, and objectives, and recognize their effect on others. Self-concept includes the capacity to control or divert their troublesome feelings and motivations and adjust to changing circumstances. Building these skills will improve both their personal and professional life and language learning.

Second, self-reflection enhances a person&#x27;s self-esteem and gives transparency for decision-making. Self-esteem is significant for dealing with a filled, complex life that incorporates meetings, vocation, family, network, and self-necessities. It helps in decision-making, effective communication, and building influence. The more they think about their qualities and how they can grow them the more confident they will be later on. A person may become happy with their good qualities and identify the ones that require growth.

Third, the self-reflection process requires honesty from the individual in order to be effective. When a person is honest with themselves when self-reflecting, they are able to understand their experiences; this person can grow and make changes based on what they have learned, leading them to better choices.

Fourth, self-reflection adapts a person&#x27;s actions in future situations. Making time to step back and consider their behaviors, the consequences of those behaviors, and the expectations of those behaviors can give them a source of a clear insight and learning. A person engaging in self-reflection may ask themselves: What appeared to have a more remarkable impact? How can we accomplish a more significant amount of that and enhance it? This cycle of reflection and variation—before, during, and after actions—is a recognized part of the process.

Failure often comes from our actions, showing up as mistakes. The positive side is that everyone makes mistakes. These mistakes teach us what to avoid in the future. They allow us to learn through &quot;negative examples&quot; or &quot;errorful learning.&quot; Many have noted that failures are valuable learning moments because they are temporary. However, we must pause and reflect deliberately to learn from these mistakes truly. This self-reflection is crucial for growth.
=== Organizational development ===
Self-reflection is considered to have a significant impact on how organizations achieve their goals. Incivility has been found to be the most pernicious outcome when members of a group exhibit a lack of self-reflection, decreasing productivity on average by 30%. According to recent self-awareness research, most people believe that they practice self-reflection, when in fact only 10–15% of people studied actually fit the criteria of consistent self-reflection.

==Psychotherapy==

A study involving clients in a twelve-step program explored the role of self‑reflection through diary writing, not only as daily therapy, but in a retrospective context. The study concluded that clients who read and reflected on their past diary entries demonstrated increased participation in the treatment program. The twelve-step program is based on self reflection and the accountability of actions past. The article by Mitchell Friedman indicates that success in one&#x27;s recovery relies on self-reflection.

<text>Rupert of Hentzau is a sequel by Anthony Hope to &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, written in 1895 but not published in book form until 1898.

The novel was serialized in &quot;The Pall Mall Magazine&quot; and &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from December 1897 through June 1898.

==Synopsis==
The story is set within a framing narrative told by a supporting character from &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;. The frame implies that the events related in both books took place in the late 1870s and early 1880s. This story commences three years after the conclusion of &quot;Zenda&quot;, and deals with the same fictional country somewhere in Germanic Middle Europe, the kingdom of Ruritania. Most of the same characters recur: Rudolf Elphberg, the dissolute absolute monarch of Ruritania; Rudolf Rassendyll, the English gentleman who had acted as his political decoy, being his distant cousin and look-alike; Flavia, the princess, now queen; Rupert of Hentzau, the dashing well-born villain; Fritz von Tarlenheim, the loyal courtier; Colonel Sapt, the King&#x27;s bodyguard; Lieutenant von Bernenstein, a loyal soldier.

Queen Flavia, dutifully but unhappily married to her cousin Rudolf V, writes to her true love Rudolf Rassendyll. The letter is to be delivered by hand by von Tarlenheim, but von Tarlenheim is betrayed by Bauer, his servant, and it is stolen by the exiled Rupert of Hentzau and his loyal cousin the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim. Hentzau sees in it a chance to return to favour by informing the pathologically jealous and paranoid King.

Rassendyll returns to Ruritania to aid the Queen, but is once more forced to impersonate the King after Rupert fatally shoots Rudolf V in a remote hunting lodge. After tracing Bauer to the house of Mother Holf, Rassendyll and Rupert engage in an epic duel. Hentzau is mortally wounded, and Rassendyll burns the letter. However, he is assassinated in his hour of triumph by Bauer—and thus is spared a crisis of conscience over whether or not to continue the royal deception for years.

Rassendyll is buried as the King in a state funeral, while Sapt and Rassendyll&#x27;s servant James stage a fire at the hunting lodge that burns the King&#x27;s body beyond recognition. Rudolf V is buried as Rudolf Rassendyll, while Flavia reigns on alone, the last of the Elphberg dynasty.

==Adaptations==

===Stage===

After a successful year on tour, a theatrical adaptation of &quot;Rupert of Hentzau&quot; opened at the Lyceum Theatre in New York City on April 10, 1899. Written by Anthony Hope with contributions by Edward Everett Rose, the play starred James K. Hackett in the dual roles of King Rudolf and Rudolf Rassendyll.
===Film===
Several motion picture adaptations were made, although not as many as for &quot;Zenda&quot;. Film versions of &quot;Rupert of Hentzau&quot; include the following:
*1915 film version &quot;Rupert of Hentzau&quot; starring Gerald Ames in the title role and Henry Ainley as Rassendyl
*1923 Selznick Pictures film with Lew Cody as Rupert, turning the tragic ending on its head: Flavia abdicates to marry Rassendyll, and Ruritania is declared a republic).
*A spoof version, &quot;Rupert of Hee Haw&quot;, was released in 1924. Stan Laurel plays an alcoholic king, whose queen, Mae Laurel, deposes and replaces him with an identical salesman named Rudolph Razz. Razz&#x27;s manners are so uncourtly that a courtier, James Finlayson, challenges him to a duel. (See also Lord Haw-haw.)
*A 1957 British TV movie &quot;Rupert of Hentzau&quot; starring John Westbrook as Rudolf Rassendyll/The King, Sarah Lawson as Queen Flavia, Robert Shaw as Rupert of Hentzau, Stanley Van Beers as Colonel Sapt, Maurice Kaufmann as Fritz von Tarlenheim, Jennifer Wright as Helga von Tarlenheim, John Gabriel, Paul Eddington as the Count Luzau-Rischenheim, Jeremy Burnham as Lieutenant Bernenstein, Diana Lamnert as Rosa Holf, Meadows White as James and Margery Caldicott as Mother Holf.
*A 1964 British television series &quot;Rupert of Hentzau&quot; starring George Baker as Rudolf Rassendyl/The King, Barbara Shelley as Queen Flavia, Peter Wyngarde as Rupert of Hentzau, John Phillips as Colonel Sapt (renamed Zapt), Tristram Jellinek as Fritz von Tarlenheim, Derek Blomfield as the Count of Luzau-Rischenheim, John Breslin as Bauer and Mark Burns as Lieutenant Bernenstein. All six episodes are now lost.

David O. Selznick considered making a film version of the novel, as a follow-up to his hugely successful 1937 film of &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, using again Douglas Fairbanks Jr. He decided not to because of the tragic subject matter and his commitment to filming &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. The 1923 silent film version had been produced by his father, Lewis J. Selznick, and his brother, Myron Selznick.

On screen, Rupert as a character has been played by matinee idols such as Ramon Novarro (1922), Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. (1937), and James Mason (1952).
