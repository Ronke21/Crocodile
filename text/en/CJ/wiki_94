<doc id="1114034" wikidata="Q5881961" url="?curid=1114034" title="Presidency of Salvador Allende">
<text>Salvador Allende was the president of Chile from 1970 until his suicide in 1973, and head of the Popular Unity government; he was a Socialist and the first Marxist elected to the national presidency of a liberal democracy in Latin America. In August 1973 the Chilean Senate declared the Allende administration to be &quot;unlawful,&quot; Allende&#x27;s presidency was ended by a military coup before the end of his term. During Allende&#x27;s three years, Chile gradually transitioned into a socialist state.

During his tenure, Chilean politics reached a state of civil unrest amid political polarization, hyperinflation, lockouts, economic sanctions, CIA-sponsored interventionism and a failed coup in June 1973. Allende&#x27;s coalition, Unidad Popular, faced the problem of being a minority in the congress and it was plagued by factionalism.

On 11 September 1973, a successful coup led by General Augusto Pinochet overthrew the government of Allende. During the bombing of the presidential palace by the Chilean Air Force, President Allende, after mounting a brief armed resistance against the military, eventually died by suicide. In Chilean historiography, Allende&#x27;s presidency is the last one of the period known as the &quot;Presidential Republic&quot; (1925–1973).

==Election==
In the 1970 election, Allende ran with the Unidad Popular (UP or Popular Unity) coalition.
Succeeding the FRAP left-wing coalition, Unidad Popular comprised most of the Chilean Left: the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Radical Party, the Party of the Radical Left (until 1972), the Social Democratic Party, MAPU (&quot;Movimiento de Acción Popular Unitario&quot;) (in 1972, a splinter group – MAPU Obrero Campesino – emerged) and since 1971 the Christian Left.

Allende received a plurality with 36.2% of the vote. Christian Democrat Radomiro Tomic won 27.8% with a very similar platform to Allende&#x27;s. Both Allende and Tomic promised to further nationalize the mineral industry and redistribute land and income among other new policies.
Conservative former president Jorge Alessandri, standing for the National Party, received slightly under 34.9% of the vote.

According to the constitution, Congress had to decide between the two candidates who had received the most votes. The precedent set on the three previous occasions this situation had arisen since 1932 was for Congress simply to choose the candidate with the largest number of votes; indeed, former president Alessandri had been elected in 1958 with 31.6% of the popular vote.

In this case, however, there was an active campaign against Allende&#x27;s confirmation by Congress, including clandestine efforts to prevent him taking office, and his presidency was ratified only after he signed a &quot;Statute of Constitutional Guarantees&quot;. This statute was suggested as a means to convince the majority of Christian Democrat senators that favoured Allessandri, as they doubted Allende&#x27;s allegiance to democracy, or at least the UP&#x27;s. After signing the statute, members of the Christian Democrat party in the Senate gave their vote in favor of Allende. It has been argued that given that less than the majority of the voters voted for him, Allende did not have a clear &quot;mandate&quot; to embark in the policies put forward on his program; however, it is also true that in the post-World War II period three out of the four previous presidents of Chile had, like Allende, also been elected with less than 50% of the vote, due in part to Chile&#x27;s multi-party system. Specifically, the winners of the four presidential elections prior to Allende&#x27;s 1970 election had won with: 56.1% (the 1964 election of Frei), 31.6% (the 1958 election of Alessandri), 46.8% (the 1952 election of Ibáñez) and 40.2% (the 1946 election of Gonzalez Videla). The legality of the 1970 election itself is not in dispute.

==&quot;The Chilean Way to Socialism&quot;==

In office, Allende pursued a policy he called &quot;La vía chilena al socialismo&quot; (&quot;The Chilean Way to Socialism&quot;). This included nationalization of certain large-scale industries (notably copper), of the healthcare system, continuation of his predecessor Eduardo Frei Montalva&#x27;s policies regarding the educational system, a program of free milk for children, and land redistribution. The previous government of Eduardo Frei had already partly nationalised the copper industry by acquiring a 51 percent share in foreign owned mines. The primary U.S. business in Chile at this time was copper mining. The Chilean government sought to fully nationalize U.S. mining operations and the Chilean constitution required &quot;just compensation&quot; to be made according to &quot;minimum international standards.&quot; However, the Allende government chose to hold mining companies liable for damages they caused to the state. Subsequently, Chile made significant deductions in computing the amount of compensation due to the North American industries. Such deductions included charges for &quot;loans invested poorly&quot; and &quot;excessive profits&quot; among other reasoning. &quot;Excessive profits&quot; were assessed dating back to the 1950s. Ultimately, deductions for &quot;social and financial malfeasance&quot; when combined with other deductions resulted in the total deductions greatly exceeding the base book values of the mining enterprises. In effect, compensation to three of the five nationalized mines was wholly eliminated by subjective deductions determined by Allende&#x27;s government. Allende also nationalized coal mining in 1971, a move that was welcomed by the miners of Lota.

Chilean presidents were allowed a maximum of six years in office, which may explain Allende&#x27;s haste to restructure the economy. He had a significant restructuring program organized.

At the beginning, there was broad support in Congress to expand the government&#x27;s already large part of the economy, as the Popular Unity and Christian Democrats together had a clear majority. But the government&#x27;s efforts to pursue these policies led to strong opposition by landowners, some middle-class sectors, the rightist National Party, financiers, and the Roman Catholic Church (which in 1973 was displeased with the direction of the educational policy). Eventually the Christian Democrats united with the National Party in Congress.

The Popular Unity coalition itself was far from unanimous. Allende himself said he was committed to democracy and represented a more moderate faction of his Socialist Party. He was supported by the Communist Party, thatdespite being ultimately less committed to representative democracyfavoured a cautious, gradual approach. For example, the Communists urged to find a compromise with the Christian Democrats and supported the application of reforms through Congress. In contrast, the radical leftist wing of the Socialist Party wanted to smash the capitalist system at once, even if that meant violent actions. If one includes smaller parties, Allende&#x27;s moderate left-wing line was supported by moderate Socialists, Communists, Radicals (Social Democrats merged with that party in June 1972) and part of the MAPU (later: MAPU/OC), whereas the left-wing Socialists (led by Altamirano), the extremist elements of the MAPU, of the Christian Left and the MIR (not belonging to the Unidad Popular) represented the far-left.

Allende believed in peaceful change, arguing that capitalism could be ended in Chile through democratic means. As he noted in a 1972 speech

Allende also saw his government as representing a transition step between capitalism and socialism, stating in a 1973 speech

During its first year in office, the Allende Government achieved economic growth, reductions in inflation and unemployment, a redistribution of income, and an increase in consumption. The government also significantly increased salaries and wages, reduced taxes, and introduced free distribution of some items of prime necessity. Groups which had previously been excluded from the state labor insurance scheme (mainly the self-employed and small businessmen) were included for the first time, while pensions were increased for widows, invalids, orphans, and the elderly. The National Milk Plan affected 50% of Chilean children in 1970, providing 3,470,000 with half a litre of milk daily, free of charge.

The land-redistribution that Allende highlighted as one of the central policies of his government had already begun under his predecessor Eduardo Frei Montalva, who had expropriated between one-fifth and one-quarter of all properties liable to takeover. The Allende government&#x27;s intention was to appropriate all holdings of more than eighty basic irrigated hectares. Allende also intended to improve the socio-economic welfare of Chile&#x27;s poorest citizens; a key element was to provide employment, either in the new nationalized enterprises or on public works projects.

Towards the end of 1971, Fidel Castro toured Chile extensively during a four-week visit. This gave credence to the belief of those on the right that &quot;The Chilean Way to Socialism&quot; was an effort to put Chile on the same path as Cuba.

Today, The Chilean Way to Socialism is often associated with the democratic road to socialism, a form of democratic socialism emphasizing representative democracy and the development of an organized working class.

==Economics==

The short-term economic results of Minister of Economics Pedro Vuskovic&#x27;s expansive monetary policy were unambiguously favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in GDP, accompanied by major declines in Chile’s long-endemic chronic inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%). In 1972 the Chilean &quot;escudo&quot; changed 140%. The average Real GDP contracted between 1971 and 1973 at an annual rate of 5.6% (&quot;negative growth&quot;), and the government&#x27;s fiscal deficit soared while foreign reserves declined. During this time, a shortage in basic commodities led to the rise of black markets which ended in late 1973 after Allende was ousted.

In addition to the earlier-discussed provision of employment, Allende also raised wages on a number of occasions throughout 1970 and 1971. These rises in wages were negated by continuing increases in prices for food. Although price rises had also been high under Frei (27% a year between 1967 and 1970), a basic basket of consumer goods rose by 120% from 190 to 421 escudos in one month alone, August 1972. In the period 1970-72, while Allende was in government, exports fell 24% and imports rose 26%, with imports of food rising an estimated 149%. However, although the acceleration of inflation in 1972 and 1973 eroded part of the initial increase in wages, the real minimum wage still rose (on average) during the 1971–73 period. Another study has asserted that during the last few months of the Popular Unity coalition’s time in office, &quot;real wages were at least equal to, if not higher than, those of 1968-69.&quot;

The falls in exports were mostly due to a fall in the price of copper. Chile was at the mercy of international fluctuations in the value of its single most important export. As with almost half of developing countries, more than 50 percent of Chile&#x27;s export receipts were from a single primary commodity. Adverse fluctuation in the international price of copper negatively affected the Chilean economy throughout 1971-72. The price of copper fell from a peak of $66 per ton in 1970 to only $48–49 in 1971 and 1972. In addition to the hyperinflation, the fall in the value of copper and lack of economic aid would further depress the economy.

Initially, the governing coalition expected the unearned wage increases and the consequent increase in government spending to be corrected once the &#x27;structural changes&#x27; like nationalisation and agrarian reforms were completed. However, by June 1972, Allende was beginning to see the economic hazards. The minister of economy was changed and some austerity measures introduced, but to little avail.

Amidst declining economic indicators, Allende&#x27;s Popular Unity coalition actually increased its vote to 43 percent in the parliamentary elections early in 1973. However, by this point what had started as an informal alliance with the Christian Democrats was anything but that. The Christian Democrats now leagued with the right-wing National Party and other three minor parties to oppose Allende&#x27;s government, the five parties calling themselves the Confederation of Democracy (CODE). The conflict between the executive and legislature paralyzed initiatives from either side. His economic policies were used by economists Rudi Dornbusch and Sebastian Edwards to coin the term macroeconomic populism.

==Foreign interference and relations==
===Argentina===
Allende received the 1973 election of Héctor Cámpora, who had previously lived in exile in Chile, as good news. Allende sent in Aniceto Rodríguez to Buenos Aires to work on an alliance between the Socialist Party of Chile and the Justicialism. Later Allende assisted to the presidential inauguration of Campora. All of this was seen with good eyes by Juan Perón who came to refer to Allende as &quot;compañero&quot;. However Perón also used Allende as a warning example for the most radical of his followers. In September just a few days before the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;etat he addressed the Tendencia Revolucionaria:
Perón condemned the 1973 coup as a &quot;fatality for the continent&quot; stating that the coup leader Augusto Pinochet represented interests &quot;well known&quot; to him. He praised Allende for his &quot;valiant attitude&quot; of committing suicide. He took note of the role of the United States in instigating the coup by recalling his familiarity with coup-making processes.

===Soviet Union===
Salvador Allende&#x27;s predecessor, President Frei, improved relations with the USSR. In February 1970, President Frei&#x27;s government signed Chile&#x27;s first cultural and scientific agreement with the Soviet Union.

Allende&#x27;s Popular Unity government tried to maintain normal relations with the United States, but when Chile nationalized its copper industry, Washington cut off U.S. credits and increased its support to opposition. Forced to seek alternative sources of trade and finance, Chile gained commitments from the USSR to invest some $400 million in Chile in the next six years.

Allende&#x27;s government was disappointed that it received far less economic assistance from the Soviet Union than it hoped for. Trade between the two countries did not significantly increase and the credits were mainly linked to the purchase of Soviet equipment. Moreover, credits from Soviet Union were much less than those provided by China and countries of Eastern Europe. When Allende visited Soviet Union in late 1972 in search of more aid and additional lines of credit, he was turned down.

Allegations have been made in a book by Christopher Andrew, based on the handwritten notes of alleged KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin, that Allende was connected to the KGB. However, the belief that Allende was a KGB agent is not universal.

Declarations from KGB General Nikolai Leonov, former Deputy Chief of the First Chief Directorate of the State Security Committee of the KGB, state that the Soviet Union supported Allende&#x27;s government economically, politically and militarily. Leonov stated in an interview at the Chilean Center of Public Studies (CEP) that the Soviet economic support included over $100 million in credit, three fishing ships (that distributed 17,000 tons of frozen fish to the population), factories (as help after the 1971 earthquake), 3,100 tractors, 74,000 tons of wheat, and more than a million tins of condensed milk.

In mid-1973, the USSR had approved the delivery of weapons (artillery, tanks) to the Chilean Army. However, when news of an attempt from the Army to depose Allende through a coup d&#x27;état reached Soviet officials, the shipment was redirected to another country.

===United States opposition to Allende===

The United States opposition to Allende started several years before he was elected President of Chile. Declassified documents show that from 1962 through 1964, the CIA spent $3 million in anti-Allende propaganda &quot;to scare voters away from Allende&#x27;s FRAP coalition&quot;, and spent a total of $2.6 million to finance the presidential campaign of Eduardo Frei.

U.S. President Richard Nixon, then embroiled in the Vietnam War and Cold War with the Soviet Union, was openly hostile to the possibility of a second socialist regime (after Cuba) in the Western Hemisphere. There was clandestine support by the U.S. government to prevent Allende from taking office after election: On 16 October 1970, a formal instruction was issued to the CIA base in Chile, saying in part, &quot;It is firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup. It would be much preferable to have this transpire prior to 24 October, but efforts in this regard will continue vigorously beyond this date. We are to continue to generate maximum pressure toward this end, utilizing every appropriate resource. It is imperative that these actions be implemented clandestinely and securely so that the USG and American hand be well hidden&quot;.

Regarding the botched attempted-kidnapping and manslaughter of Chilean Army Commander René Schneider on 22 October 1970 (Schneider was a constitutionalist opposed to the idea of a coup preventing Allende from taking office or removing him after the fact), the Church Committee observed: &quot;The CIA attempted, directly, to foment a military coup in Chile. It passed three weapons to a group of Chilean officers who plotted a coup. Beginning with the kidnapping of Chilean Army Commander-in-Chief Rene Schneider. However, those guns were returned. The group which staged the abortive kidnap of Schneider, which resulted in his death, apparently was not the same as the group which received CIA weapons.&quot; However, the group which killed Schneider had previously been in contact with the CIA. The agency later paid that group $35,000, according to the Hinchey report, &quot;in an effort to keep the prior contact secret, maintain the good will of the group, and for humanitarian reasons&quot;. CIA documents indicate that while the CIA had sought his kidnapping, his killing was never intended. Public outrage over the killing of Schneider cooled sentiments for a coup, and neither the U.S. nor Chilean military attempted other removal actions in the early years of the Allende administration. On 26 October, President Eduardo Frei Montalva (Salvador Allende was inaugurated 3 November) named General Carlos Prats as commander in chief of the army in replacement of René Schneider. Carlos Prats was also a constitutionalist.

With Allende in office, the United States reduced economic aid to the Chilean government.

In 1973, the CIA was notified by contacts of the impending Pinochet coup two days in advance, but contends it &quot;played no direct role&quot; in the coup. After Pinochet assumed power, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told Nixon that the United States &quot;didn&#x27;t do it&quot; (referring to the coup itself) but had &quot;created the conditions as great as possible&quot;.

==Crisis==
In October 1972, Chile saw the first of what were to be a wave of confrontational strikes led by some of the historically well-off sectors of Chilean society; these received the open support of United States President Richard Nixon. A strike by trucking company owners, which the CIA supported by funding them with US$2 million within the frame of the &quot;September Plan&quot;, began on 9 October 1972. The strike was declared by the &quot;Confederación Nacional del Transporte&quot;, then presided by León Vilarín, one of the leaders of the far-right paramilitary group &quot;Patria y Libertad&quot;. The Confederation, which brought together 165 trucking company business associations, employing 40,000 drivers and 56,000 vehicles, decreed an indefinite strike, paralyzing the country.

It was soon joined by the small businessmen, some (mostly professional) unions, and some student groups. Its leaders (Vilarín, Jaime Guzmán, Rafael Cumsille, Guillermo Elton and Eduardo Arriagada) expected to topple the government through the strike. Other than the inevitable damage to the economy, the chief effect of the 24-day strike was to bring the head of the army, general Carlos Prats, into the government as Interior Minister, as a sign of appeasement. Carlos Prats had succeeded General René Schneider after his assassination on 24 October 1970, by two groups, General Roberto Viaux and General Camilo Valenzuela, who had benefitted from logistical and financial support from the CIA. Prats was a supporter of the legalist Schneider doctrine and refused to involve the military in a coup against Allende.

In March and July 1972, Allende and the Christian Democrats tried to forge a compromise. The moderate Party of the Radical Left, representing the UP coalition in March, held talks with the Christian Democratic Party over regulations of nationalized firms, but ultimately failed, as the minister of economy Pedro Vuskovic boycotted the negotiations and carried out legally dubious expropriations. As a result, the Radical Left also left the UP coalition, hence the coalition lost 5 senators and 7 deputies. In July, the resumed talks were almost going to succeed, until the more conservative elements within the Christian Democrat party managed to break off the negotiations. From that point on, the political life of the country was highly polarized between two opposing camps: the governing left-wing Unidad Popular and the right-wing opposition of Christian Democrats who were allied with the National Party, a vehemently right-wing opposition party.

===Tanquetazo===
===Congressional resolutions===
On 22 August 1973, the Christian Democrats and the National Party members of the Chamber of Deputies voted 81 to 47, a resolution that asked the authorities, in reference to &quot;The President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces&quot;, to &quot;put an immediate end&quot; to &quot;breach[es of] the Constitution...with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans&quot;. The resolution declared that the Allende Government sought &quot;to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the state ... [with] the goal of establishing a totalitarian system&quot;, claiming it had made &quot;violations of the Constitution...a permanent system of conduct&quot;. Finally, the resolution condemned the &quot;creation and development of government-protected [socialist] armed groups, which ... are headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces&quot;. President Allende&#x27;s efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterised as &quot;notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks&quot;.

Most of the accusations were about the Socialist Government disregarding the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government. The resolution was later used by Pinochet a way to justify the coup, which occurred two weeks later. On 24 August 1973, Allende responded point-by point to the accusations. He accused the opposition of trying to incite a military coup by encouraging the armed forces to disobey civilian authorities. He said that Congress was &quot;facilitat[ing] the seditious intention of certain sectors&quot; and promoting a coup or a civil war by &quot;invoking the intervention of the Armed Forces and of Order against a democratically elected government&quot;. He observed that the declaration had failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority constitutionally required to bring an accusation against the president and argued that the legislature was trying to usurp the executive role. He wrote that &quot;Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it...With a tranquil conscience ... I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside&quot;. He concluded by calling upon &quot;the workers, all democrats and patriots&quot; to join him in defense of the constitution and of the &quot;revolutionary process&quot;.

===Final coup===

In early September 1973, Allende floated the idea of resolving the crisis with a referendum. However, the Chilean military seized the initiative of the Chamber of Deputies&#x27; 22 August Resolution (which had implored Allende&#x27;s military removal) to oust Allende on 11 September 1973. As the Presidential Palace was surrounded and bombed, Allende died by suicide.

<text>Polygonatum , also known as King Solomon&#x27;s-seal or Solomon&#x27;s seal, is a genus of flowering plants. In the APG III classification system, it is placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae). It has also been classified in the former family Convallariaceae and, like many lilioid monocots, was formerly classified in the lily family, Liliaceae. The genus is distributed throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere. Most of the approximately 63 species occur in Asia, with 20 endemic to China.

==Etymology==
&quot;Polygonatum&quot; comes from the ancient Greek for &quot;many knees&quot;, referring to the multiple jointed rhizome. One explanation for the derivation of the common name &quot;Solomon&#x27;s seal&quot; is that the roots bear depressions which resemble royal seals. Another is that the cut roots resemble Hebrew characters.

==Description==
The fruits are red or black berries. The berries are poisonous to humans.

==Uses==

===Gardening===
Several species are valued as ornamental plants, including:
* &quot;Polygonatum biflorum
* &quot;Polygonatum hirtum&quot;
* &quot;Polygonatum hookeri&quot;
* &quot;Polygonatum humile&quot;
* &quot;Polygonatum&quot; × &quot;hybridum&quot;
*&quot;Polygonatum multiflorum&quot;
*&quot;Polygonatum odoratum&quot;
*&quot;Polygonatum stewartianum&quot;
*&quot;Polygonatum verticillatum&quot;
===Food===
The berries are poisonous to humans.

Many species have long been used as food in China, such as &quot;Polygonatum sibiricum&quot;. Leaves, stems, and rhizomes are used raw or cooked and served as a side dish with meat and rice. The rhizomes of two local species are eaten with chicken&#x27;s or pig&#x27;s feet during festivals. The rhizomes are used to make tea or soaked in wine or liquor to flavor the beverages. They are also fried with sugar and honey to make sweet snacks. The starchy rhizomes can be dried, ground, and added to flour to supplement food staples. The rhizome of &quot;P. sibiricum&quot; is pulped, boiled, strained, and thickened with barley flour to make a sweet liquid seasoning agent called &quot;tangxi&quot;. At times, people in China have relied on &quot;P. megaphyllum&quot; as a famine food.

The shoots of some &quot;Polygonatum&quot; can be boiled and used like asparagus. &quot;P. cirrifolium&quot; and &quot;P. verticillatum&quot; are used as leafy vegetables in India. The American species &quot;P. biflorum&quot; has a starchy root that was eaten like the potato and used as flour for bread.

&quot;P. sibiricum&quot; is used for a tea called &quot;dungulle&quot; in Korea.

=== Traditional medicine ===
The berries may be poisonous to humans.
The traditional use of &quot;Polygonatum&quot; in the treatment of diabetes was first observed in 1930 by Hedwig Langecker. After experiments, she concluded that it was effective in fighting nutritional hyperglycemia, though not that caused by adrenaline release, probably due to its glucokinin content.

&quot;P. verticillatum&quot; is used in Ayurveda as an aphrodisiac. It is also used to treat pain, fever, inflammation, allergy, and weakness.

An herbal remedy called &quot;rhizoma polygonati&quot; is a mix of &quot;Polygonatum&quot; species used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is supposed to strengthen various organs and enhance the &quot;qi&quot;. Polygonatum is believed to be restorative to mental vitality, especially when the mind has been overworked, overstressed, or is in a state of exhaustion.

&quot;P. cyrtonema&quot; is a compound that is often used in &quot;Traditional Chinese Theory&quot; as a treatment for depression, which is thought to originate from problems in the liver and the kidney. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which is considered by TCT to be a form of depression is also sometimes treated with &quot;P. cyrtonema.&quot; There is some evidence that &quot;P. cyrtonema&quot; can inhibit Post Traumatic Stress by regulating oxidative stress and inflammation associated with the NLRP3 gene.

<text>&quot;Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?&quot; is a song by the British singer-songwriter Peter Sarstedt. Its recording was produced by Ray Singer, engineered by John Mackswith at Lansdowne Recording Studios and released in 1969. The music has been described as &quot;a faux European waltz tune&quot;, and the arrangement is a very simple one of strummed acoustic guitar and upright bass, with brief bursts of French-style accordion at the start and the end. The arranger and conductor was Ian Green.

==Lyrics==
The song is about a fictional girl named Marie-Claire who grows up on the poverty-stricken backstreets of Naples, becomes a member of the jet set, and goes on to live in Paris. The lyrics describe her from the perspective of a childhood friend; it is left unclear whether they have remained close. The rhetorical question of the title suggests that her glamorous lifestyle might not have brought Marie-Claire happiness or contentment.

Even though Sarstedt himself was not French, the song benefited from the contemporary awareness in Britain of such singers as the French Serge Gainsbourg and Jacques Brel (Belgium-born of Flemish descent).

The lyrics contain a large number of contemporary and other references:

* Marlene Dietrich: German–American actress and singer
* Zizi Jeanmaire: French ballerina
* Pierre Balmain: French designer of elegant fashions
* Boulevard Saint-Michel: street in the Latin Quarter of Paris
* The Rolling Stones: British rock and roll band
* Sacha Distel: French singer and musician
* Sorbonne: University of Paris
* Picasso: Spanish pioneer of modern art
* Juan-les-Pins: fashionable beach resort on the French Riviera
* Topless swimsuit: first conceived by Austrian American fashion designer Rudi Gernreich in 1964
* Saint Moritz: fashionable ski resort in the Engadin, Swiss Alps
* Napoleon brandy: a blended brandy in which the youngest brandy of the blend has been aged for at least six years
* Aga Khan: Islamic leader and racehorse owner

The version on the album &quot;Peter Sarstedt&quot; is longer than the radio edit version released as a single, having extra stanzas beginning &quot;You go to the embassy parties ...&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re in between twenty and thirty...&quot;. The difference in length between the two versions is approximately 30 seconds.

==Inspiration==
It is often suspected that the name Marie-Claire is inspired by &quot;Marie Claire&quot; magazine, a women&#x27;s fashion weekly that began in 1937 in France. One theory says that the song is about the Italian actress Sophia Loren, who was abandoned by her father and had a poverty-stricken life in Naples. Another theory has the song being inspired by Danish singer and actress Nina van Pallandt.

According to Alan Cooper: &quot;Sarstedt insisted it was not written with actress Sophia Loren in mind. &#x27;Yes, it&#x27;s a portrait of a poor-born girl who becomes a member of the European jet set. And yes, there&#x27;s reference to her growing up on the &quot;back streets of Naples&quot;, so I can see why people may think it was written with Sophia Loren in mind. But that&#x27;s just a coincidence. I really wasn&#x27;t thinking of anyone specific.

The song was written in Copenhagen.

In 2009, Sarstedt spoke to a gossip columnist for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. He admitted he had lied about the song being about a socialite who died in a fire. He said that the song was about his girlfriend at the time, Anita Atke, whom he met in Paris. The two married in 1969, but were divorced in 1974. 

==Reception==
John Bush of allmusic called the song &quot;an exquisite piece of Baroque pop that Sarstedt would never come close to equaling again&quot; and said that the song &quot;blended the reserve of early British singer/songwriter with the sophistication of Continental pop.&quot;

The song was a hit far exceeding Sarstedt&#x27;s other work, although he is not a one-hit wonder. In 1998 he was earning £60,000 annually in royalties from it.

DJ John Peel once said in an interview with &quot;New Musical Express&quot; that he considered this song the worst of all time.

The song was used as a soundtrack in Wes Anderson&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; and in Jennifer Saunders&#x27;s 2016 film &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot;.

==Sequel==
In 1997 Sarstedt recorded a sequel, &quot;The Last of the Breed (Lovely 2),&quot; on his CD &quot;England&#x27;s Lane&quot;. This picks up the story of Marie Claire 20 years on, living now in London. It names more people and places, including Belgravia, Ballets Russes, Cape Town, Claridge&#x27;s, Gstaad, John Galliano, Harrods, Jerusalem, Long Island, Milan, Rudolf Nureyev, Palm Beach, Rio de Janeiro, and Isabella Rossellini. In later years, Sarstedt and a co-writer were working on a further sequel, &quot;Farewell Marie-Claire,&quot; in which the story was brought to a conclusion. The song was to feature the same waltz feel as the original. But Sarstedt&#x27;s retirement from the music industry meant that the track was abandoned.

==Chart history and performance==

It was a number-one hit in the UK Singles Chart for four weeks in 1969, and was awarded the 1970 Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. In the United States, the record reached No. 61 on the Cash Box Top 100 Singles. The single also peaked at No. 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 that May.

<text>The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW; ; ), established in 1908, is a Welsh Government sponsored body concerned with some aspects of the archaeological, architectural and historic environment of Wales. It is based in Aberystwyth.

The RCAHMW maintains and curates the National Monuments Record of Wales (NMRW), an archive with an online platform called Coflein. Professor Nancy Edwards is Chair of the Commissioners.

== Mission statement ==
The Royal Commission has a national role in the management of the archaeological, built and maritime heritage of Wales, as an originator, curator and supplier of information for individual, corporate and governmental decision-makers, researchers and the general public. To this end it:
* Surveys, interprets and records the man-made environment of Wales
* Compiles, maintains and curates the National Monuments Record of Wales
* Promotes an understanding of this information by all appropriate means

The Royal Commission is committed to close partnership working with other organisations in Wales, in particular Cadw and the Welsh Archaeological Trusts.

==History==
In 1882 Sir John Lubbock pioneered the First British Ancient Monuments Act. This Act, concerned principally with prehistoric monuments rather than with later, medieval structures, encouraged owners to voluntarily transfer important sites into the safekeeping of Her Majesty&#x27;s Commissioners of Works. It also discouraged the public from damaging monuments by threatening to impose stiff penalties.

The first Schedule of monuments resulted from a nationwide inquiry among interested local antiquarian societies. In order to add monuments to this Schedule, the First Inspector of Ancient Monuments, General Pitt-Rivers, travelled the British Isles examining the known sites, and searching for new ones. Unfortunately, only limited information was available to him and his helpers about the nature, location and condition of many monuments, and there was no easy way to assess the potential national significance or value of any given site.

In Wales, there were only three monuments on the first Schedule. These were Plas Newydd megalith, Anglesey, Arthur&#x27;s Quoit, Gower, Glamorgan and the megalith at Pentre Ifan, Pembrokeshire.

By the turn of the century it was becoming clear that a census of archaeological sites was needed, so that a selection of the best could be put forward for Statutory Protection. Consequently, by 1908 the administrative frameworks were in place to establish individual Royal Commissions on Ancient Monuments separately in Scotland, England and Wales. Significantly, their original remit was to encompass not only Historic Monuments, but also Constructions.

On 10 August 1908 a Royal Commission was authorised and appointed by King Edward VII to &quot;make an inventory of the Ancient and Historical Monuments and Constructions connected with or illustrative of the contemporary culture, civilisation and conditions of life of the people in Wales and Monmouthshire from the earliest times, and to specify those which seem most worthy of preservation&quot;. This last injunction was the most urgent purpose of the Commission in the eyes of the legislators, but the inventory was its essential preliminary. The protection of significant sites under the Ancient Monuments Act of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign had been severely hampered by a basic lack of knowledge of the country&#x27;s stock of monuments. So it was felt that an independent and official body was needed to prepare a reliable inventory from which examples could be selected and recommended for statutory protection.

This need was not peculiar to Wales, and in 1908 identical Royal Commissions were established for Scotland and England too.

===Commissioners===
The early commissioners were distinguished men (there was no woman) who were notable figures in Welsh cultural life, each with a distinctive contribution to make to the task ahead. Their involvement in such long-established scholarly institutions as the Cambrian Archaeological Association and the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion proved invaluable to the Royal Commission from the beginning.

For the first four decades of its existence it was based, like other Royal Commissions, in London, which allowed easy access to the British Museum, the Public Record Office and the Cymmrodorion Society, which also had its headquarters in the capital.

The Royal Commission&#x27;s first chairman was Sir John Rhŷs (died 1915), philologist and professor of Celtic at Oxford University. He oversaw the publication of the first four inventory volumes, which appeared in quick succession: for Montgomeryshire (1911), Flintshire (1912), Radnorshire (1913) and Denbighshire (1914). The second chairman (until his death in 1934) was Evan Vincent Evans. By profession an accountant and journalist, he was a friend of Welsh politicians and a stalwart of eisteddfodau and the Cymmrodorion.

The early commissioners, included Edward Anwyl (died 1914), another philologist, professor of Welsh and Comparative Philology at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. Griffith Hartwell Jones (died 1944) was an Anglican clergyman living in Surrey but also chairman of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion. Robert Hughes was a former lord mayor of Cardiff, which had recently been created a city. Henry Owen, a lawyer, was a notable Pembrokeshire historian and another leading light of the Cymmrodorion. J. A. (later Sir Joseph) Bradney, who was the pre-eminent historian of Monmouthshire, was appointed a commissioner during the Great War, when he was also a lieutenant-colonel in the militia. The last of these early commissioners to be appointed (in 1920) was John Morris-Jones, poet and professor of Welsh in the University College of North Wales, Bangor.

None of these men were practising archaeologist by the later definition of the term. Two other commissioners, however, included W. E. Llewellyn Morgan, who was on the army retired list, had spent several decades penning field descriptions of monuments; those which he made for the Royal Commission, drawing on his earlier notes, were sufficiently respected to be included in the Pembrokeshire inventory (1925).

Finally, Robert Carr Bosanquet (died 1935) was professor of Classical Archaeology at the University of Liverpool.

The day-to-day work of the new Commission required specialist staff, and its first secretary was Edward Owen. Between 1908 and 1928 he did much to establish the Commission on sound and respected foundations. A reputable historian of Anglesey origins, he was trained as a lawyer and had served, like many a British civil servant, in the India Office, where he supervised the military store accounts and prepared statistical statements for India. As overall editor of the inventories, he was at pains to extend his knowledge beyond his own expertise in medieval and later manuscripts. His scholarship was widely admired by the Cymmrodorion and the Carmarthenshire Antiquarian Society among others. He was also closely involved with the University of Liverpool, where he became reader in Welsh Medieval Antiquities (1921) during his time as the Commission&#x27;s secretary.

Owen&#x27;s staff included his assistant in 1908, Edward Thomas, was a fine writer and observer of the landscape but he found the Commission&#x27;s work uncongenial (he regarded himself &quot;a fish out of water&quot;) and resigned to concentrate on literature. Thomas proved to be one of Britain&#x27;s finest war poets, but in 1917 he was killed in action at Arras. Three other of the early staff made greater contributions to the Commission. George Eyre Evans&#x27;s life (1857–1939) spanned the formative years of modern archaeology. As a prolific antiquary with many publications to his name before he joined the Commission, he was most closely associated with Carmarthenshire, particularly the county museum and the antiquarian society. Alfred Neobard Palmer (1847-1915) was appointed in 1910 as a &quot;temporary assistant inspector of Ancient Monuments&quot; for six months, at 15s. a day with a guinea for subsistence and travelling. Palmer suffered ill health, and his appointment was an act of kindness by Edward Owen, who had earlier secured him a government pension in recognition of his historical researches. A chemist by profession, Palmer turned himself into a local historian, particularly of Wrexham, where the local studies library is named after him.

Ivor Mervyn Pritchard, an architect employed by HM Office of Works and Public Buildings, made a long lasting contribution. His services were loaned to the Commission to make plans and drawings for the inventories and he seems to have been responsible for much of the photography. The wash drawing of St Asaph Cathedral that is the frontispiece of the Flintshire volume is by Pritchard, and his plans and pen-and-ink drawings can be seen in the inventories for Denbighshire (1914), Carmarthenshire (1917) and Merioneth (1921).

===First inventories===
Following the publication of the first inventories (of Montgomeryshire and Flintshire in 1911-12),the Commission&#x27;s work was praised in Parliament for its quality and value for money; but the Great War naturally slowed things down. Edward Owen, now unpaid, managed to keep the work going and the Carmarthenshire volume was published at the height of the war in 1917. At the same time (and although he was in his sixties), Owen was anxious to contribute to the war effort through a position in the newlyformed statistics department of the War Office, but he was turned down. For a brief period after the war Owen ran the Commission from his home in Wrexham, until new offices could be found in London. During his visits to the capital he took to sleeping in the office to carry out the work expected of him - which earned a mild rebuke from the Chief Commissioner of Works.

The future of the Royal Commission was in some doubt during the years of austerity, when the Office of Works considered a purge of Royal Commissions. This prompted the chairman, Vincent Evans, to urge Owen to publish the Merioneth volume as soon as possible, and when it appeared in 1921 Evans shrewdly sent a copy to the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, who responded by congratulating the commissioners for &quot;doing a real public service&quot;. The Commission&#x27;s continuance was not questioned again for nearly seventy years. Nevertheless, financial cutbacks delayed the appearance of the Pembrokeshire inventory, and the Commission itself did not meet formally for two and a half years.

The fundamental nature of the inventories was bound to lead the Commission into other areas concerned with the historic sites and monuments it was recording, and this has characterised the Commission throughout its life. As early as 1916 Owen was allowed to make representations to the town clerk of Chepstow about the proposed destruction of a stretch of medieval town wall, and in 1926 the Commission was represented on the committees running the excavations at the Roman fort at Kanovium (Caerhun). Owen himself was in constant demand to give talks to national and local societies, and a steady stream of requests for information came in – for example on the Roman fort at Tomen-y-mur, Whitland Abbey, stone circles, place names and, especially, genealogy.

During the mid-1920s developments in professional archaeology exerted growing pressure for change in the approaches, methodology and structure of the Royal Commission. While the Commission had fulfilled its role of identifying monuments worthy of preservation, the volume on Pembrokeshire (1925) attracted criticism for its dearth of original fieldwork and its failure to keep up with advances in architectural recording and interpretation.

Edward Owen was prepared to defend the Commission&#x27;s approach to its work, which had the merit of publishing lists of sites and monuments swiftly in the county inventories. But Owen also saw the need to keep abreast of scholarly advances, even though the financial climate of the post-war years made it difficult to find suitably qualified staff when they would be expected to work for practically nothing. A thorough review of the Commission&#x27;s operations resulted in major revision of his original guidelines. The Commission had been fortunate in recruiting Cyril Fox, the new director of the National Museum of Wales, as a commissioner; supported by R. C. Bosanquet, he was largely responsible for the changes that were now made. What survived of Owen&#x27;s guidelines were the county arrangement of inventories and the broad classification scheme he had devised. There was a shift in focus from the use of documents and antiquarian reports to fieldwork, and an insistence on a full record of each site, building or object, with original plans and descriptions made by the Commission itself. Categories or types of structures and objects were henceforward to be identified routinely, noting any significant variations of detail, and reference to the methods used by the English and Scottish Commissions in describing and mapping monuments would be more frequent.

The opportunity was not taken to extend the remit of the Commission&#x27;s investigators to buildings dated after 1714, but this year was an advance on the earlier guidelines. Special attention would now be drawn to domestic structures of all sorts, including &quot;humbler dwellings&quot;. Another novelty was consultation with &quot;official referees&quot; whose specialist advice would supplement the expertise of the small number of commissioners, especially in new and developing fields of knowledge. This enabled the Commission to recruit advisers of the calibre of J. E. Lloyd and Mortimer Wheeler.

In the remaining two years of his secretaryship Owen put in order the work already done on Anglesey. It was left to his successor, Wilfred J. Hemp, to oversee the full implementation of the new guidelines. As an experienced inspector of Welsh monuments in the Office of Works and a plain-speaking advocate of archaeology and archaeologists, in many ways Hemp was ideal for the task. On the other hand, he found the administrative burdens in a period of economic depression tiresome and his insistent attempts to squeeze resources from the &quot;singularly ill-informed&quot; Treasury seem to have been less effective than the efforts of Vincent Evans, who was familiar with the corridors of Whitehall.

The annual budget of the Commission was raised from £1,250 to £1,700 at the time of Hemp&#x27;s appointment, but the story of the next decade is essentially one of constant struggle by both chairman and secretary to secure expert investigative staff and refine the quality of reporting, building on the principles of 1926. Leonard Monroe, a trained architect, was appointed as the secretary&#x27;s assistant, and Hemp decided to employ Stuart Piggott, a young archaeologist with a distinguished career ahead of him, instead of a typist (but on a typist&#x27;s salary of £3 a week). Convinced that each specialist member of &quot;a skeleton staff of three should be a first rate man&quot;, Hemp nevertheless estimated that it would take forty years to complete the county inventories to the standard now adopted.

The test of the Commission&#x27;s revised strategy and Hemp&#x27;s stewardship was the Anglesey inventory, on which work had been proceeding since the mid-1920s. In November 1929 Hemp estimated that &quot;it should be completed in about four years, if the services of a typist can be obtained&quot;. In Hemp&#x27;s mind it also depended on strengthening the complement of staff, particularly in field archaeology; but, as the government grappled with economic crises over the next few years, there was little sympathy shown at the Treasury. A desperate Leonard Monroe repeatedly threatened to resign, and in 1933 Stuart Piggott did so. Even Hemp was moved to tell the commissioners that henceforward they could only count on receiving the &quot;statutory allowance&quot; of his time.

In the event, the Anglesey book was published in 1937. Its approach and structure set the pattern for the inventory volumes that would follow over the next half-century. One of its most striking features was its emphasis on the comparative study of sites and buildings and on the use of examples to establish types of structures so as to provide a deeper understanding of past societies. Site descriptions were arranged by parishes, maps and plans were generously provided, the spelling of Welsh place names followed principles recommended by J. E. Lloyd rather than the antiquated practices of the Ordnance Survey, and a helpful glossary of terms was included. The book was praised because it &quot;not only set a fresh standard for work in Wales, but also dealt more comprehensively with the archaeology and history of the district concerned than did the publications of the fellow Commissions for England and Scotland&quot;. Vincent Evans, the long-serving chairman who had presided over the transformation of the Commission&#x27;s work, died in November 1934, before the Anglesey inventory was published. He was succeeded by the Earl of Plymouth.

The next item on the agenda was the Caernarfonshire inventory. There was much to be said for applying the knowledge gained in Anglesey to the county immediately across the Menai Strait, and sporadic collection of materials on Caernarfonshire had taken place already. But the Second World War caused major disruption to the Commission&#x27;s plans for this volume. During the war Hemp ran the evacuated Commission from his home in Criccieth. This enabled him to devote happy days to research and writing on a county that was the Commission&#x27;s priority. His long-standing interest in history, genealogy and heraldry was applied to the wealth of medieval stone carvings and inscriptions, and his experience as an inspector for the Office of Works enabled him to report in 1941 on clearances at Conwy Castle so that additions could be made to its newly surveyed plan. Soon after the war ended, Hemp retired and Leonard Monroe moved elsewhere. In terms of experienced staff, and therefore continuance of its work, the Commission stood at a crossroads.

===Second World War===

During the war another strand of investigation and recording began that was later to be bound into the Royal Commission. This was the creation in 1940 of the National Buildings Record for England, Scotland and Wales because of concern that buildings might be destroyed by enemy action without any record ever having been made of them. With limited resources, it set about the formidable task of rapidly compiling a national architectural archive, and in a very short space of time it amassed an impressive collection of photographs and drawings, including the Courtauld Institute&#x27;s already established Conway Library. Leonard Monroe was seconded to the National Buildings Record from the Royal Commission to cover south Wales. Photographers around the country were also engaged to photograph buildings in areas judged to be at greatest risk: most prolific of those working in Wales was George Bernard Mason, who produced photographs of exceptional quality. After the war the National Buildings Record photographers took to recording buildings ahead of the new threat posed by demolition, as owners of many fine houses could no longer afford to maintain them.

In 1946 the Royal Commission was clear about its programme of future work: to complete the Caernarfonshire inventory along modern lines. But more immediate decisions were needed about where the Commission should be based and who was to lead its small staff. A. H. A. Hogg (died 1989) was appointed the secretary in 1949. Hogg was by profession a civil engineer, but he had strong interests and field experience in archaeology going back to his teenage years. He came to the Royal Commission from a lectureship in engineering at Cambridge University. Hogg was par excellence a field worker, who imbued two generations of investigators with the principles and practices of rigorous recording, using chain, tape and theodolite. Probably at his urging, it was decided to base the Commission in Aberystwyth rather than return to London. Aberystwyth had the advantages of a central location in Wales and scholarly facilities close by in The National Library of Wales. The Commission has remained in Aberystwyth ever since.

By 1949 the rest of the Commission&#x27;s staff was mostly young and inexperienced, with the singular exception of C. N. Johns, who had wide knowledge as a crusader castle archaeologist in the Palestine Department of Antiquities in the 1930s and 1940s, and immediately after the war had been seconded from the Royal Commission to be the British controller of antiquities and excavations in Libya. His was a name to conjure with in Middle Eastern archaeology for long after, and he applied his field experience to good effect in north Wales. During the years of recovery and growing prosperity in the 1950s and early 1960s, the staff grew in number and became more specialised in both field survey and site and building recording, eventually with a specialist photographer and professional illustrator, all of whose services ensured that the three Caernarfonshire volumes published between 1956 and 1964 maintained and enhanced the standards achieved in the Anglesey book twenty years earlier.

Petrol rationing at first had delayed the fieldwork, which was made more difficult, too, by mountainous terrain and bad weather. An important modification of the principles was made to extend the cut-off date for recording vernacular architecture of Wales from 1714 to 1750, with some examination of buildings constructed between then and 1850. These changes in the evolution of the Commission&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;historic monuments&quot; reflected the passage of time and the life of buildings, as well as ideas about what should be recorded and preserved. In the more industrialised counties of Wales this would shortly raise very large issues for the Commission&#x27;s future programme. like the earlier stress on &quot;humbler dwellings&quot; in the Anglesey inventory (of which a new edition appeared in 1960), the modifications doubtless owed much to Cyril Fox, still one of the commissioners, and to the publication of his and Lord Raglan&#x27;s three volumes on &quot;Monmouthshire Houses&quot; in 1951-4.

The Caernarfonshire books broke new ground in their recording of hundreds of huts and field systems, site descriptions like that of Caernarfon Castle (in Volume II), and the space given to local vernacular architecture and the small churches of the Caernarfonshire countryside. Volume II recorded the discoveries of the Roman marching camp at Penygwryd and Roman fort at Pen Llystyn. Volume III included the first complete survey ever made of Bardsey, the Isle of Saints. The whole enterprise was informed by a multiplicity of skilful plans and maps, as well as by hundreds of photographs.

===National Monuments Record of Wales===

In 1963 responsibility for the National Buildings Record was transferred to the three Royal Commissions and it was amalgamated with the records gathered during the course of their own work over the previous half-century. The Commissions were explicitly empowered to continue this established architectural work. In Wales Peter Smith was assigned as the emergency recorder with special responsibility for domestic architecture. By this stage the Commission had also amassed a considerable archive of measured drawings, surveys and photographs through its own inventory programme. These records documented archaeological sites and buildings of all periods, and the amalgamation created a substantial national archive which was renamed the &quot;National Monuments Record of Wales&quot; to reflect its unique scope and importance. Its primary functions were &quot;to provide an index of all monuments, so that inquirers can be directed at once to the best information concerning any structure; and to fill the gaps in that information&quot;. These ambitious and important aims resulted in a classified card index, innovatory in its day, for every known site and structure in Wales. Managed by C. H. Houlder, it laid the foundation of the Commission&#x27;s structured archive, database and enquiry service as they are today.

Monuments in the National Monuments Record of Wales are assigned a &quot;National Primary Record Number&quot; or NPRN.

When the Commission came to survey the county of Glamorgan, it faced a much larger and more complex body of architecture than that in previous inventories. A greater proportion of investigators&#x27; time was needed for architectural survey than for traditional earthwork archaeology, and it was realised that it would be possible to progress the work more efficiently if the system of recording by parishes were abandoned in favour of recording by a combination of period and monument type. Volume I, published in 1976, therefore focussed exclusively on prehistoric and early medieval Glamorgan and represented a major departure. This and the plans for further thematic volumes in the Glamorgan inventory were essentially the work of A. H. A. Hogg and his team. Although Hogg himself had retired as secretary in 1973, he continued to lend his services to the Commission until his late seventies.

In the meantime several other important developments had broadened the Royal Commission&#x27;s responsibilities. In 1969 it took the initiative to list information for local authorities. Commissioners were sensitive to the inevitably slow progress of the authoritative, detailed inventory programme, and it seemed helpful to complement it with a rapid survey of those monuments that were increasingly at risk from development: they were defined as &quot;all types of ancient structures which are no longer capable of active use&quot;, a definition that allowed the inclusion of certain industrial monuments but excluded churches and mansions. A further advantage of this new project was that priority could be given to two counties that so far had no inventories. Yet only two of these new lists were issued: the first for Cardiganshire in 1970 and the second in 1973 for the &quot;Early Monuments&quot; of Monmouthshire.

===Excavated and recorded sites===
A second experiment capitalised on the Commission&#x27;s growing archive of excavated and recorded sites. In 1971 it published what it saw as &quot;the first of a series of reports by which... the National Monuments Record of Wales hopes to provide accounts of the major field monuments for which no adequate descriptions exist&quot;. This was a detailed survey of the hut settlement on Gateholm Island, Pembrokeshire. The commissioners turned for another development to one of the senior investigators, Peter Smith, who had been studying over a number of years the historical and stylistic evolution of house types in Wales. The resulting book, &quot;Houses of the Welsh Countryside&quot;, which was brought out at the end of 1975 to coincide with Architectural Heritage Year, demonstrated that the inventories could take yet another form, as national studies of a topic. Smith&#x27;s book, a contribution of European importance to the history of domestic architecture, was published to great acclaim, and an expanded edition appeared in 1988.

Excavation was a prominent activity of the Royal Commission during Hogg&#x27;s period as secretary, reflecting his own interests and the dearth of other organisations to carry them out. For example, between 1957 and 1960 staff were diverted to the rescue excavation of the Roman fort at Pen Llystyn, Caernarfonshire, and in 1962 Hogg directed rescue excavations associated with a hydro-electric scheme on the site of Bronze Age cairns at Aber Camddwr, Cardiganshire. For several seasons in the 1960s, L. A. S. Butler conducted excavations in medieval Conwy, including in the vicarage garden where a medieval building had possibly been destroyed during Owain Glyn Dŵr&#x27;s revolt. Other excavations at this time were part of the inventory programme for Glamorgan, such as at Harding&#x27;s Down in Gower, where a rampart section was cut and an entrance and two hut platforms were revealed in an Iron Age hillfort. The Commission made many significant archaeological discoveries, not the least being the identification of six new Roman marching camps between 1954 and 1972.

Of great significance for the future were the trials which the Commission made in the early 1970s of the use of vertical aerial photography to speed up the survey of nationally important sites: of the Pembrokeshire hillforts Gaer Fawr and Carn lngli in 1973, and in 1974 of Carn Goch, a hillfort in Carmarthenshire. The methodology was also adopted for the medieval site of Cefnllys Castle in Radnorshire.

===Staff===
The Commission&#x27;s staff was active in the wider archaeological world in the post-war period. Hogg had a fruitful partnership with the castle historian, D. J. C. King, to compile lists of early castles and masonry castles in Wales and the Marches. He and several colleagues collaborated to publish the reports of pre-Second World War excavations at the hillfort of Pen Dinas, Aberystwyth.

The fourth secretary of the Royal Commission, Peter Smith (from 1973 to 1991), had joined the organisation in 1949 after a brief period as a trainee architect during which he became disillusioned with the prevailing modernist trend in architecture. At the outset his principal aim was to continue with the Glamorgan inventory, and five massive volumes were published between 1976 and 2000 which were highly praised - though even as the millennium ended the plan had not been fully realised. At the same time progress was made on the sites and monuments of Brecknock and a revision of the Radnorshire book of 1913 was begun to bring it up to modern scholarly standards. The chairman of the Commission, W. F. Grimes, encouraged greater interest in industrial remains - though he himself was a notable prehistorian. Particular attention was given to the early communications systems of the Swansea valley: a prelude to more extensive studies of Wales&#x27;s canals and the remains of the Swansea region&#x27;s industries.

In the post-war decades the Royal Commission had consistently supported the county history movement in Wales, and in due time practically all the volumes that appeared - and continue to appear - in the series of histories of the counties of Glamorgan, Cardigan, Pembroke, Merioneth and Monmouth have drawn on the Commission&#x27;s archive for illustrations and, in some cases, on its staff and commissioners for chapters.

On the other hand, the Royal Commission&#x27;s role in excavation was bound to change from the 1970s onwards. The creation of the four Welsh Archaeological Trusts as excavating units removed the need for the Commission to be as centrally involved in such activity as it once had been.

Following the formation of English Heritage to cover historic environment functions in England, it was decided to take a fresh look at the Royal Commissions. Management consultants were engaged by the government to examine &quot;value for money&quot;. As far as Wales was concerned, in 1988 their report stated that &quot;Our strong impression of RCAHMW is that the best has become the enemy of the good. It is inward-looking, rather with the aura of an old-fashioned university department, it has not recognised the need for good management practices and the Commission has not fully recognised the value of integrating non-inventory activities into its priorities... If RCAHMW is to represent good value for money, there needs to be major re-orientation of effort.&quot; This report was accepted by the government.

The debate about the usefulness of &quot;static&quot; county inventories in a changing world where developers, planners and owners needed direct access to current, reliable information about the historic environment had gone on for decades. The 1960s had seen the first shift away from inventory compilation with the establishment of the National Monuments Records in Wales, Scotland and England - making concrete the concept of the dynamic record. This dynamic record was made real through the work of the Welsh Archaeological Trusts, who were pioneers in developing computerised Historic Environment Records (HERs) in the 1970s. This was pioneered by Don Benson who was then Chief Executive of the Dyfed Archaeological Trust, and the HERs remain key to the delivery of archaeological public benefit across Wales today. The &quot;active&quot; role of the HERs is supported by the &quot;archive&quot; role of the NMRW.

===Ordnance Survey===

From the Royal Commission&#x27;s point of view, an alternative to the static record of the inventories had been under consideration before the Commission&#x27;s inception - the Ordnance Survey&#x27;s (OS) record of archaeological sites for map depiction - and this would in due course be brought into the Royal Commissions. The Ordnance Survey&#x27;s archaeology officer, C. W. Phillips, argued that, &quot;This continuous aspect of the work is of great importance and compares favourably with that of some other institutions which are unable to continue their work in it effectively once they have completed the inventory of a county, excellent though that inventory normally is&quot;. He warned that, the Royal Commissions&#x27; completion of their inventories &quot;cannot be expected before much of the matter of their inquiry has been either damaged or destroyed&quot;. Antiquities had been shown on OS maps from the late eighteenth century (at least two of the iconic features of these maps were introduced first in Wales: Gothic script for antiquities in 1812 and Egyptian typeface for Roman remains in 1816). Until the end of the Great War the identification and interpretation of antiquities had taken place in consultation with local experts and antiquaries, but in 1920 the Survey had appointed its first archaeological officer, O. G. S. Crawford, who built up a small but expert group, including W. F. Grimes, who later became chairman of the Welsh Commission. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the OS archaeology branch amassed a considerable body of material on antiquities, which went far beyond what was required for mapping. The sites index included a short description and interpretation of each site, with bibliographical references and field observations. These were usually accompanied by a measured plan, normally at the appropriate basic mapping scale but sometimes supplemented with enlarged surveys and cross-sections to aid interpretation and help in draughting the published map.

In 1983 the Survey&#x27;s archaeological division was transferred to the three Royal Commissions along with its invaluable sites index and responsibility for surveying, interpreting and maintaining a record of archaeological sites depicted on OS maps. In Wales since then the Royal Commission itself has continued to provide mapping information to the Ordnance Survey for basic scales and for derived mapping such as the popular 1/50,000 scale Landranger series. The supply of this information is an invaluable product of the Royal Commission&#x27;s archaeological survey projects, ensuring that every user of Ordnance Survey maps can appreciate the historic sites depicted.

The consultants in 1988 estimated that only 11 per cent of the Commission&#x27;s resources were allocated to Wales&#x27;s National Monuments Record. They accordingly recommended an adjustment of the balance with the Commission&#x27;s publications programme: increased priority should be given to the National Monuments Record &quot;as the destination of... survey data&quot; for Wales, and computer-based technologies should be developed for &quot;the storage, retrieval and dissemination of data&quot;. Along with improved management structures and an emphasis on staff training to ensure the future capacity of the Commission, here was a clear remit for the new chairman, Professor J. B. Smith, and the new secretary, Peter White, who came from English Heritage with extensive experience of administrative and financial management; both were appointed in 1991. In the following year a revised Royal Warrant confirmed the changed priorities of the Royal Commission.

In 1991 the crucial information technology post was created, and Terry James rather belatedly recast the Commission&#x27;s data and introduced electronic recording. The use of the same software as that for the regional sites and monuments records helped the Commission to lead a partnership that resulted in data exchange through the Extended National Database (END).

===Welsh Uplands Survey===

The expansion of the aerial survey programme of the 1980s and the introduction of the survey to cover all extensive Welsh uplands continue to contribute to Welsh archaeology by locating thousands of hitherto unsuspected sites. Greater managerial skills were needed to operate the Commission&#x27;s increasingly complex infrastructure and the Plas Crug building at Aberystwyth, into which the Commission moved in 1990.

At the same time the undoubted professionalism and scholarship of the Commission&#x27;s staff were harnessed to maximum effect. This was well demonstrated by the large Welsh Nonconformist Chapels project, which was carried forward in partnership with the voluntary organisation, Capel. In time, all such projects came to be allocated to one of three branches, covering the main functions of survey and investigation, information management and public services, with close working between the staff of each.

The Commission&#x27;s publications continued to prove a strength and extended far beyond the county inventories. Books were produced on topical subjects and particular sites or buildings. Studies of the collieries of Wales, Brecon Cathedral, Newport Castle (Pembrokeshire) and Guns across the Severn (the fortifications in the Severn channel) spring to mind. Gradually, from the 1990s onwards, there also developed a portfolio of outreach activity to complement management of the archive, supported by an education officer and organised from a refurbished library that welcomes the public.

===Archive===

The Royal Commission&#x27;s archive gave the organisation a renewed &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;. Years of under-capitalisation of the National Monuments Record had meant that it had no effective, modern finding aids. Computerisation of the records data now began to unlock its riches, including the collection of images, the largest of its kind in Wales and half as big again as that of the National Library. The National Monuments Record had become a nationwide resource of a nature different from that of the regional sites and monuments records. It expanded rapidly with significant donations from many public and private sources supplementing the detailed survey and photographic records of the Commission itself. Transfers from many other public organisations, including Cadw on behalf of the Welsh Assembly Government, take place from time to time. Important collections have been accepted from the private and commercial sectors, one of the most notable being the acquisition in 2008 of the Aerofilms collection of historic oblique air photographs. Today, the photographs in the National Monuments Record are Wales&#x27;s largest national collection, with about 1.5 million images. A foretaste of the future was the Commission&#x27;s participation in the Gathering the Jewels project, which provided an opportunity to make available online many notable images from the National Monuments Record and began a digitisation programme which remains one of the Commission&#x27;s priorities in its service to the public.

===SWISH Partnership===

In order to provide public access to its archives and collections, the RCAHMW entered into a partnership with its Scottish counterpart. This partnership was known as SWISH (Shared Web Information Services for Heritage) and was designed to develop online public services. This collaboration was the first such project between the two devolved administrations that had recently come into being. SWISH supported Coflein, the Commission&#x27;s internet portal: this carries details of some 80,000 sites and monuments in Wales. Much of the information on Coflein is derived from the Historic Environment Records of the Welsh Archaeological Trusts; information also comes from the National Monuments Record archive catalogue. In 2006 SWISH began developing the Historic Wales Portal, which offers access to the historic environment records of a wide range of bodies, including Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum Wales, Cadw, and the four Welsh Archaeological Trusts.

The SWISH partnership enabled access to the National Monuments Record using map searching online. It ended in 2019, and the Royal Commission has begun to develop its own system to replace it - although not in partnership with the other heritage organisations in Wales.

===&quot;Hidden Histories&quot;===

A five-episode BBC television series following the field investigations of the Commission, &quot;Hidden Histories&quot;, was broadcast in 2008 on BBC2 Wales and in 2009 on BBC4. A second series was in production in summer 2009. Both series were made by Element Productions Ltd and presented by Huw Edwards.

===Proposed merger===

In May 2012, the Welsh Government announced that it wished &quot;to create a process whereby the core functions of the Royal Commission could be merged with other organizations, including Cadw&quot;. The merger would have been similar to that undertaken in England in 1999, when the English Royal Commission was absorbed into English Heritage. Following a consultation exercise, the Minister for Culture and Sport announced in January 2014 that the two organisations would remain separate for the time being.

==Services==
The RCAHMW maintains and curates the National Monuments Record of Wales (NMRW) holding a national collection of information about the archaeological, architectural and historical heritage of Wales and provides a public information service, drawing on both archival and published sources and benefiting from specialist advice from RCAHMW staff. The National Monuments Record includes drawings, photographs, maps, plans and descriptions for a total of over 80,000 sites, buildings and maritime remains. With 1.5 million photographs, it is the largest photographic archive in Wales. The NMRW is an archive for research purposes, as distinct from the Historic Environment Records maintained by the Welsh Archaeological Trusts on behalf of Welsh Ministers by statute, which are the primary active record for all of Wales.

===Enquiry services===
The National Monuments Record of Wales welcomes enquiries from individuals and organisations interested in the many and varied aspects of the heritage of Wales.

===Library and search room===
The Commission&#x27;s specialist reference library contains books and journals, which may be consulted during public opening hours. Copies of material from the archive may also be purchased.

===Research and recording===
Since its inception in 1908, the Royal Commission has established a reputation for maintaining an expertise in, and developing standards for, the survey, interpretation and reconstruction of historic buildings and archaeological sites both on land and under the sea. Today our work encompasses archaeological survey, architectural recording, maritime survey and recording, drone and aerial survey, often working collaboratively with partners.

Since the purchase of our first Electronic Measuring Device (EDM) in 1984, we have striven to encompass innovative digital technologies into our work in order to further and improve our understanding of the heritage of Wales.

The Survey and Investigation Team utilises a wide range of digital survey techniques in the survey of diverse heritage of Wales. Total Station Theodolites (TST) survey, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) survey, airborne laser scanning (LiDAR), terrestrial laser scanning, photogrammetry and giga-pixel photography are employed to provide detailed, highly accurate 3-dimensional recording of sites, landscapes, structures and buildings. Since 2017, drone survey has been used both for low-altitude photography and video alongside photogrammetry of complex sites and buildings. 

This data is both archived in the National Monuments Record of Wales, creating an enduring record of the site for future consideration, and is made available via Sketchfab. Together, survey and recording remain the essential basis for understanding and interpreting the sites and monuments of Wales.

==Archive==
The National Monuments Record of Wales (NMRW) holds information about the historic environment of Wales. It includes almost two million items, including photographs, drawings, surveys, reports and maps.

===Coflein===
Coflein is the online database for the National Monuments Record of Wales (NMRW). The name is derived from the Welsh &quot;cof&quot; (memory) and &quot;lein&quot; (line). Coflein contains details of many thousands of archaeological sites, monuments, buildings and maritime sites in Wales, together with an index to the drawings, manuscripts and photographs held in the NMRW archive collections. Coflein is an archive, whereas the Historic Environment Records are a statutory resource maintained by the Welsh Archaeological Trusts on behalf of Welsh Ministers, and are the primary active record for all of Wales.

==Publications==
The Commission has published over a hundred books developing and promoting understanding of aspects of the historic environment.

<doc id="1114055" wikidata="Q747669" url="?curid=1114055" title="Luboš Kubík">
<text>Luboš Kubík (born 20 January 1964) is a Czech former professional footballer and former manager of Torquay United. He played libero for the Czechoslovakia and Czech Republic national teams, earning 56 caps with 13 goals in total, and some clubs.

==Early and personal life==
Kubík was born on 20 January 1964 in Vysoké Mýto, Pardubice Region. He attended Prague University of Economics and Business but did not finish it. As a result of his football career, Kubík speaks English and Italian apart from his native Czech – along with some Polish, German, and French. He has a good understanding in Russian, which he learned in school, but has since forgotten how to speak it. After retiring from professional football, Kubík worked with Masaryk Primary School in Dolní Roveň and TJ Sokol Roveň, when a project was implemented to train young football players under the banner of Luboš Kubík Rural Football School in Dolní Roveň. Kubík&#x27;s son, also named Luboš, is founder of USA Sport &amp; Study organization where he leads the soccer division and helps young Czech soccer players to follow his footsteps overseas until American universities.

==Club career==
===European football===
Kubík began his career in 1981 with Hradec Králové before moving to Slavia Prague the following year. In 1988, he and compatriot Ivo Knoflíček fled to England from a training camp in West Germany. In January 1989, they attempted to sign for Derby County as free agents, and were presented as new signings by the club&#x27;s then-owner, the Czechoslovak-born Robert Maxwell, during a match against Southampton. However, both footballers were still under contract with Slavia Prague, who refused to allow them to transfer.

Upon the expiry of his FIFA disqualification, Kubík signed for Italian club ACF Fiorentina in April 1989 for approximately 600 million lire. Wanting to obtain the required transfer to play in Italy, he came to an agreement with the Czechoslovak Football Federation to fulfil his military service obligations in his homeland first. With Fiorentina, Kubík scored three goals in 26 league matches and played in the 1989–90 UEFA Cup, where the club reached the final before losing to Juventus.

Kubík moved to Ligue 1 club FC Metz in 1991 before transferring to Bundesliga team 1. FC Nürnberg in 1993, Returning to the Czech Republic, he played for Drnovice FK, SK Slavia Prague, and AFK Lázně Bohdaneč.

===MLS and retirement===
Kubík moved to Major League Soccer in 1998, joining the expansion team Chicago Fire. While helping the Fire to win both the MLS Cup and the U.S. Open Cup in their inaugural year, Kubík was named the MLS Defender of the Year. Kubík continued to be a valuable attacking force from the back in 1999, registering five goals and eight assists, and was named in the MLS Best XI for a second time.

Kubík signed for Dallas Burn during the 2001 off-season in exchange for Sergi Daniv. Kubík&#x27;s final year was again plagued by injuries, having only played in 11 matches for the club. He retired at the end of the 2001 MLS season and returned to the Czech Republic.

==International career==
Kubík debuted for the Czechoslovakia national football team in 1985 against Sweden. He represented Czechoslovakian and Czech Republic national teams, respectively at the 1990 FIFA World Cup and 1996 UEFA European Football Championship. Kubík played his last international game in 1997 against Belarus.

==Managerial career==
Kubík was appointed as manager of Polish side Śląsk Wrocław in summer 2006, but was sacked later that October after just 11 league games in charge.

Kubík was appointed coach of the EFL League Two side Torquay United on 27 November 2006 through his close friendship with Torquay chairman Chris Roberts. Despite his impressive playing career, his lack of managerial experience and contacts in England was a problem, not aided by Roberts appointing Richard Hancox as Kubík&#x27;s assistant. Torquay struggled in the relegation zone with Kubík, winning just twice in 15 matches, thus he left club by mutual consent on 5 February 2007. Roberts also resigned as chairman later that month. The club was relegated at the end of the season, ending a 79-year spell in the Football League First Division.

Kubík was appointed coach of third-tier Czech club SK Týniště nad Orlicí in 2007. His first match in charge was a friendly match against Převýšov, the leading champions of the Hradec Králové Regional League. Later that year, he left the club due to poor performances in the league.

In March 2010, Kubík was appointed assistant coach of the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team for the FIFA World Cup later that year.

<text>Dame Agnes Sybil Thorndike, Lady Casson (24 October 18829 June 1976) was an English actress whose stage career lasted from 1904 to 1969.

Trained in her youth as a concert pianist, Thorndike turned to the stage when a medical problem with her hands ruled out a musical career. She began her professional acting career with the company of the actor-manager Ben Greet, with whom she toured the US from 1904 to 1908. In Britain she played in old and new plays on tour and in the West End, often appearing with her husband, the actor and director Lewis Casson. She joined the Old Vic company during the First World War, and in the early 1920s George Bernard Shaw, impressed by seeing her in a tragedy, wrote &quot;Saint Joan&quot; with her in mind. She starred in it with great success. She became known as Britain&#x27;s leading tragedienne, but also appeared frequently in comedy.

During the Second World War, Thorndike and her husband toured in Shakespeare productions, taking professional theatre to remote rural locations for the first time. Towards the end of the war she joined Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier for two seasons staged by the Old Vic company in the West End. After the war she and Casson made many overseas tours, playing in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. They also appeared on Broadway.

Thorndike was mainly known as a stage actress, but made several films from the 1920s to the 1960s, among them &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl&quot; (1957) and &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (1963), both with Olivier. She also broadcast from time to time on radio and television. Her last stage appearances were in 1969 at the theatre named in her honour, the Thorndike Theatre, Leatherhead.

== Early years ==
Thorndike was born on 24 October 1882 in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, the eldest of the four children of the Rev Arthur John Webster Thorndike (1853–1917) and his wife Agnes Macdonald, &quot;née&quot; Bowers (1857–1933), the daughter of a shipping merchant. From both parents Thorndike absorbed values of tolerance and concern for others that remained with her throughout her life. When she was two years old her father was appointed a minor canon of Rochester Cathedral. She was educated at Rochester Grammar School for Girls, and first trained as a classical pianist, making weekly visits to London for lessons at the Guildhall School of Music.

In May 1899 Thorndike gave her first solo piano recital, but shortly afterwards she developed recurrent pianist&#x27;s cramp, and although she performed in leading concert venues in London – the Bechstein, Steinway and St James&#x27;s halls – by 1902 it was clear that a musical career would be impossible. She studied for the stage at the drama school run by Ben Greet, who engaged her for an American tour beginning in August 1904, in advance of which she made her professional début at Cambridge in June, as Palmis in W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;The Palace of Truth&quot;. She remained in Greet&#x27;s company for three years playing in Shakespearean repertory throughout the US.

On her return to England, Thorndike was spotted by Bernard Shaw in a one-off Sunday night performance at the Scala Theatre in London; he invited her to join the company for a revival of his &quot;Candida&quot; to be given in Belfast by Annie Horniman&#x27;s players. The company was based at the Gaiety Theatre, Manchester, where she first appeared in September 1908 as Bessie Carter in Basil Dean&#x27;s &quot;Marriages are Made in Heaven&quot;. She played parts in nine other plays by authors ranging from Euripides to John Galsworthy. In the company she met, and formed a lifelong partnership with, the actor Lewis Casson. They married in December 1908 at her father&#x27;s church. They had two daughters and two sons, all of whom went on the stage for some or all of their careers.

Thorndike appeared at the Coronet Theatre, London, in June 1909 with the Horniman company, and at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in March 1910 with Charles Frohman&#x27;s repertory company, appearing there as Winifred in &quot;The Sentimentalists&quot;, Emma Huxtable in &quot;The Madras House&quot;, Romp in &quot;Prunella&quot; and Maggie Massey in &quot;Chains&quot;. She then went to New York, where she appeared at the Empire Theatre in September 1910, as Emily Chapman in &quot;Smith&quot; opposite John Drew.

Between her return to Britain and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Thorndike appeared in the West End at the Aldwych Theatre in June 1912 as Beatrice Farrar in &quot;Hindle Wakes&quot;, and at the Playhouse Theatre in July 1912 in the same role. She returned to Manchester for a second season at the Gaiety later in the year, playing a range of roles in nine plays. At the Court Theatre in London in May 1913 she played the title role in St John Ervine&#x27;s &quot;Jane Clegg&quot;, and in October she appeared in both Manchester and London as Hester in Eden Phillpotts&#x27; &quot;The Shadow&quot;.

== 1914–1919 ==

Between November 1914 and May 1918 Thorndike played in four seasons at the Old Vic (and one at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1916) with a mostly Shakespearean repertory. According to her biographer Jonathan Croall she played &quot;most of the main female characters&quot; and – with a shortage of young actors during the war – she took six male roles including Prince Hal in &quot;Henry IV Part 1&quot;, the Fool in &quot;King Lear&quot;, Ferdinand in &quot;The Tempest&quot; and Puck in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Her non-Shakespearean roles included Lady Teazle in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, Peg Woffington in &quot;Masks and Faces&quot;, Kate Hardcastle in &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;, the Angel Gabriel in the mystery play &quot;The Star of Bethlehem&quot;, and Nancy in a stage version of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; adapted by her brother Russell, who was the leading man of the company. Together, the siblings wrote and co-starred in two revues for the company: &quot;The Sausage String&#x27;s Romance, or a New Cut Harlequinade&quot; and &quot;Seaman&#x27;s Pie, a Naval Review of Revues and Other Things&quot;.

After leaving the Old Vic company Thorndike was engaged by C. B. Cochran, and appeared at the Oxford Music Hall, London, in June 1918 as Françoise in a sketch, &quot;The Kiddies in the Ruins&quot;, which was introduced into &quot;The Better &#x27;Ole&quot;. In various West End theatres during 1919 she appeared as Sygne de Coûfontaine in &quot;The Hostage&quot;, Naomi Melsham in &quot;The Chinese Puzzle&quot;, Clara Bortswick in &quot;The Great Day&quot;, Anne Wickham in &quot;Napoleon&quot; and in October she played Hecuba in &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;, adding to her growing reputation as Britain&#x27;s leading tragedienne. Praising her as &quot;a new leading lady&quot; for the West End, &quot;The Times&quot; predicted, &quot;Much as the Old Vic will regret it, it is hardly conceivable that Miss Thorndike will be allowed to cross over to the south side of the river again&quot;. In the event, she continued to appear in Old Vic productions as well as in the West End for nearly thirty years.

== 1920s ==
In early 1920 Thorndike successfully repeated her Hecuba and played the title roles in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Candida&quot; and in another Euripides play, &quot;Medea&quot;. The critic J. T. Grein wrote of the latter, &quot;It is a great example of tragic acting, and a magnificent achievement&quot;. Later in the year Thorndike joined her brother and her husband in a two-year run of Grand Guignol melodramas at the Little Theatre.

The vogue for theatrical horror began to wane and Casson and Thorndike joined Bronson Albery and Lady Wyndham in the management of the New Theatre in 1922. They opened with Shelley&#x27;s verse tragedy &quot;The Cenci&quot;. Shaw saw a performance, and told his wife, &quot;I have found my Joan&quot;. He was planning a play about Joan of Arc, which he completed in 1923. It was his custom to open his plays on Broadway before their West End premieres, and the first actress to play his Joan was Winifred Lenihan, but the part was written with Thorndike in mind. 

&quot;Saint Joan&quot; opened at the New Theatre in March 1924. Thorndike&#x27;s performance received praise from the critics, but there were reservations: in &quot;The Times&quot;, A. B. Walkley said that she performed beautifully, but he found her &quot;rusticity of speech a superfluity&quot;. The critic of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; felt that no other actress could have better &quot;hit off the Maid&#x27;s simplicity without losing her strength&quot;. Desmond MacCarthy in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, praised Thorndike for emphasising the &quot;insistive, energetic, almost pert traits of the Maid as Mr Shaw conceives her&quot; but thought she missed &quot;the sweetness and simplicity of the Maid&#x27;s replies and demeanour in the trial scene&quot; though driving home Joan&#x27;s &quot;distress, her alertness, her courage&quot;. In &quot;The Observer&quot;, Lennox Robinson wrote that Thorndike&#x27;s performance &quot;was beautiful, was entirely satisfying. Mr Shaw was, indeed, nobly served.&quot; The initial London production ran for 244 performances, and Thorndike starred in revivals over the following 17 years not only in London (1925, 1926, 1931 and 1941) but at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Paris (1927) and on tours of South Africa (1928) and the Middle East, Australia and New Zealand (1932−33).

In 1927−28 Thorndike was again a member of the Old Vic company, for a season at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. She played Katherina in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, Portia in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, Beatrice in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and Chorus and the Princess of France in &quot;Henry V&quot;.

In the 1920s Thorndike entered films, appearing in four: as Mrs Brand in &quot;Moth and Rust&quot; (1921), various parts in &quot;Tense Moments from Great Plays&quot; (1922), Edith Cavell in &quot;Dawn&quot; (1928) and the Mother in &quot;To What Red Hell&quot; (1929). In 1923 she made her first radio broadcasts for the BBC; during the decade these included two of her best-known stage roles: Medea and Saint Joan.

== 1930s ==
Thorndike&#x27;s roles of the early 1930s included the title part in Racine&#x27;s &quot;Phèdre&quot;, Mrs Alving in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts&quot;, and Emilia in a celebrated production of &quot;Othello&quot; at the Savoy Theatre with Paul Robeson and Peggy Ashcroft as Othello and Desdemona. In 1931 she was appointed DBE, the fourth actress to be made a Dame. She appeared in a wide range of plays, both classical and modern, often under Casson&#x27;s direction.
From April 1932 to April 1933 Thorndike and Casson made a tour of Egypt, Palestine, Australia and New Zealand, in which she appeared in the satirical comedy &quot;Advertising April&quot;; Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot;; &quot;Ghosts&quot;; Clemence Dane&#x27;s &quot;Granite&quot;; &quot;Macbeth&quot;; a romantic comedy, &quot;Madame Plays Nap&quot;; &quot;Milestones&quot;; &quot;The Painted Veil&quot;; &quot;Saint Joan&quot; and Sidney Howard&#x27;s domestic drama &quot;The Silver Chord&quot;.

In the West End in September 1933 Thorndike appeared in &quot;The Distaff Side&quot;, by John van Druten, which she took to Broadway the following year, having in the interim played Gertrude in &quot;Hamlet&quot; for the Old Vic company at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in an uncut, five-hour production directed by Greet (who appeared as Polonius). Thorndike and Casson were among the actors who felt an obligation to appear in the provinces as well as in the West End − according to the critic Hannen Swaffer &quot;Sybil is the only actress whom the provinces treat like a queen&quot; − and her expressed view was, &quot;No actor has any business to say that they won&#x27;t tour, it&#x27;s part of our work&quot;. In 1936 the couple toured in plays by Euripides, Shaw, Noël Coward and D. H. Lawrence, and followed this with a tour of a new play, &quot;Six Men of Dorset&quot;, by Miles Malleson and Harvey Brooks the following year.

In 1938 Thorndike appeared in New York as Mrs Conway in J. B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;Time and the Conways&quot;, and in London as Volumnia in the Old Vic production of &quot;Coriolanus&quot; with Olivier in the title role as her son. In the West End she created the role of Miss Moffat in the long-running &quot;The Corn is Green&quot; (1938) by Emlyn Williams. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, this play &quot;showed her at the top of her form as an English spinster with a vocation for teaching, and obtained for her and the author, who himself played the Welsh mining lad who was her star pupil, a heartening success on the eve of war and of new developments in theatrical life&quot;.

Thorndike made three films during the decade, appearing as Madam Duval in &quot;A Gentleman of Paris&quot; (1931), Mrs Hawthorn in &quot;Hindle Wakes&quot; (1931) and Ellen in &quot;Tudor Rose&quot; (1936). She made her television début in 1939 as the Widow Cagle in a melodrama, &quot;Sun Up&quot;.

== Second World War ==

When the Second World War began in September 1939, Thorndike, a convinced pacifist, protested against the conflict, but recognised that while it lasted the populace needed entertainment. In 1940 she took part in a film of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Major Barbara&quot; as General Baines, after which she and Casson joined a touring Old Vic company taking &quot;Macbeth&quot; to even the remotest corners of Wales. As there were few available hotels the actors frequently stayed with mining families, whom Thorndike found &quot;wonderfully hospitable&quot;. By 1941, with the London blitz coming to an end, it was practical for the London theatre to revive, and the Old Vic company presented Shakespeare&#x27;s rarely seen &quot;King John&quot;, in which Thorndike played Constance. As its own theatre had been severely bombed, the company played at the New Theatre. Later in the year the Cassons again toured Wales, adding &quot;Candida&quot; and &quot;Medea&quot; to their repertory.

When Ralph Richardson, Olivier and John Burrell were appointed to re-establish the Old Vic as a leading London company in 1944 they recruited Thorndike, who played Aase in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, Catherine Petkoff in &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, Queen Margaret in &quot;Richard III&quot;, Marina in &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, Mistress Quickly in &quot;Henry IV, Parts 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, Jocasta in &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; and the Justice&#x27;s Lady in &quot;The Critic&quot;. Between August 1944 and April 1946 the company played in London and toured for the armed forces in Belgium, Germany and France.

After the defeat of Germany in 1945 a Nazi blacklist was found in Berlin, naming eminent people to be arrested after an invasion of Britain. Among them was Thorndike, as a prominent member of the National Council for Civil Liberties.

== Post-war and 1950s ==
When the Old Vic company played a season in New York in 1946 Thorndike chose to remain in England to appear with Casson. They were in Priestley&#x27;s &quot;The Linden Tree&quot; in 1947, in which year Thorndike played Mrs Squeers in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; for the cinema, followed by another film, &quot;Britannia Mews&quot; in 1948, as Mrs Mouncey. In the theatre Thorndike and Casson were in a revival of John Home&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Douglas&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival (1950), and without Casson, Thorndike starred with her old friend Edith Evans in N. C. Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Waters of the Moon&quot;. The play, described by Croall as &quot;a cosy middle-class drama [with] certain elements of Chekhov&quot;, received tepid reviews but proved popular with audiences and ran for 835 performances at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket between 1951 and 1953. The Cassons rejoined forces in Hunter&#x27;s next play, &quot;A Day by the Sea&quot; (1953), directed by and co-starring John Gielgud. Like its predecessor, the play appealed more to the public than to the critics, and ran for 386 performances at the Haymarket.
During the mid- and late-1950s Thorndike and Casson were seen more abroad than at home. They toured the Far East, New Zealand and India in 1954, giving dramatic recitals. Together with Richardson they toured Australia and New Zealand in 1955, presenting &quot;The Sleeping Prince&quot; and &quot;Separate Tables&quot;. The couple toured southern Africa, Kenya, Israel, and Turkey in 1956, giving dramatic recitals. In the West End in June 1956 Thorndike played Amy, Lady Monchensey in &quot;The Family Reunion&quot;, with Casson, Paul Scofield and Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies. In New York the couple appeared in the world premiere of Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;The Potting Shed&quot;, which ran on Broadway for 143 performances in 1957, after which they revisited Australia and New Zealand, touring in &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot;.

During the 1950s Thorndike appeared in eleven films: &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (as Mrs Gill, 1950), &quot;Gone to Earth&quot; (Mrs Marston, 1951), &quot;The Lady with a Lamp&quot; (Miss Bosanquet, 1951), &quot;The Magic Box&quot; (the Aristocratic Client, 1951), &quot;Melba&quot; (Queen Victoria, 1953), &quot;The Weak and the Wicked&quot; (Mabel, 1953), &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl&quot; (The Queen Dowager, 1957), &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot; (Dora, 1958), &quot;Smiley Gets a Gun&quot; (Granny, 1958), &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot; (Lady Fitzhugh, 1959) and &quot;Jet Storm&quot; (Emma Morgan, 1959). Among her television appearances was a studio production of &quot;Waters of the Moon&quot; with Evans, Casson and Kathleen Harrison.

== Later years, 1960–1976 ==
Thorndike&#x27;s first stage role of the 1960s was Lotta Bainbridge in Coward&#x27;s &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot;; she and Marie Löhr played the lead roles of two residents in a retirement home for actors and actresses, perpetuating, and finally resolving, an ancient feud. She said of it, &quot;I loved that play. It&#x27;s the most lovely modern play I&#x27;ve played&quot;, but the piece was not a great box-office success and closed after 188 performances. In 1961 Thorndike played the longest part of her career, the title role in Hugh Ross Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Teresa of Avila&quot;, about the eponymous saint. She thought it &quot;the most thrilling part I&#x27;ve been offered since Saint Joan&quot;, but Williamson&#x27;s script, even after extensive revision by Casson, proved disappointing. Reviews were enthusiastic in their praise of Thorndike&#x27;s performance, but neither the critics nor the public liked the play, which closed after six weeks.

In 1962 Olivier, as director of the Chichester Festival, mounted a production of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;. He assembled a cast headed by Michael Redgrave in the title role, supported by Olivier (as Astrov), Fay Compton, Joan Greenwood and Joan Plowright, in addition to Thorndike as Marina, the nurse, and Casson as Waffles. The critic J. C. Trewin wrote of &quot;the most remarkably complete production – in my experience at least – of any play in our period&quot;. He called Thorndike&#x27;s nurse &quot;a miracle of gruff tenderness&quot;. The production was acknowledged as the highlight of the festival, and was revived the following year. Between the two stagings Thorndike appeared for the first time in a musical – playing the formidable Miss Crawley in an adaptation of Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. The piece received bad reviews. &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that at her age Thorndike &quot;should have known better than be caught up in this piece of prolonged nonsense&quot;, although &quot;The Times&quot; found consolation in her &quot;blazingly theatrical figure&quot; who &quot;stamps every line with comic authority&quot;. 

Olivier moved from Chichester to become the founding director of the National Theatre in late 1963. He included &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; in his first season, with many of his Chichester cast reprising their roles, but Casson, by this time in his late eighties, declined, and Thorndike did likewise. At the Duchess Theatre in January 1964 she appeared as the Dowager Countess of Lister in William Douglas-Home&#x27;s play &quot;The Reluctant Peer&quot;, a comic fictionalisation of the author&#x27;s elder brother&#x27;s recent renunciation of his peerage so as to be eligible for the premiership. Once again, Thorndike&#x27;s notices were better than those for the play. Bernard Levin wrote, &quot;she gets her fangs deep into the meatiest part she has had for years&quot; and praised &quot;the relish and zest she brings to her playing&quot;. She thought the critics were wrong to dismiss the play – &quot;they only want avant-garde and classics now&quot; – and was sorry when her contractual commitments forced her to leave the cast six months into the eighteen-month run.

After appearing in two successive box-office failures – Arthur Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Season of Goodwill&quot; (1964) and William Corlett&#x27;s &quot;Return Ticket&quot; (1965) – Thorndike rejoined Casson in what turned out to be their last West End production together, a revival of the classic black comedy &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;. With Athene Seyler co-starring as her equally well-meaning and homicidally lunatic sister, Thorndike enjoyed herself, the critics were enthusiastic, and the play ran from February to November 1966.

Thorndike appeared no more on the London stage after that. At the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford, in January 1967 she played Claire Ragond in &quot;The Viaduct&quot;, and at the same theatre in February 1968 she appeared as Mrs Basil in &quot;Call Me Jacky&quot;. Later in that year she toured as Mrs Bramson in Emlyn Williams&#x27;s thriller &quot;Night Must Fall&quot;.

During the 1960s Thorndike appeared in three films, as Lady Caroline in &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; (1960), Aunt Cathleen in &quot;The Big Gamble&quot; (1961), and as Marina in a film adaptation of Olivier&#x27;s Chichester production of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; (1963). The television was not her favourite medium – she found it restricting – although she had a success in 1965 as Mrs Moore in a BBC adaptation of E. M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Passage to India&quot;. Forster congratulated her on her performance, but she replied, &quot;I loved Mrs Moore, but I am not wild about TV as a medium to express her! She&#x27;s bigger than that&quot;.

Casson died in May 1969, and Thorndike&#x27;s only stage role after that was in the inaugural performance of the theatre named in her honour, the Thorndike Theatre, Leatherhead, in October of that year, as the Woman in &quot;There Was an Old Woman&quot; by John Graham. She was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1970. Her last public appearance was at the National Theatre&#x27;s final night at the Old Vic in February 1976, where from a wheelchair she acknowledged the applause of her fellow members of the audience.

Brian Harrison recorded an oral history interview with Thorndike, in December 1975, as part of the Suffrage Interviews project, titled &quot;Oral evidence on the suffragette and suffragist movements: the Brian Harrison interviews.&quot; In it she talks about the progressive nature of the theatre, and her freedom as an actress as well as her support for women&#x27;s suffrage. 

Thorndike and Casson had long lived at Swan Court, Chelsea, where she died on 9 June 1976, aged 93. Her ashes were interred in Westminster Abbey the following month, after a memorial service there.

==Reputation==
Thorndike described herself as &quot;an old-fashioned socialist, an Anglican and a pacifist – a mixture of which Mr Marx might disapprove&quot;. Corin Redgrave recalled, &quot;Her shining spirit came through almost everything she did. She never wavered in her humanitarian Christian socialist beliefs&quot;. Giving the address at her memorial service, Gielgud called Thorndike &quot;the most loved actress since Ellen Terry&quot;. Her obituarist in &quot;The Times&quot; said the same. Croall and many others have concurred.

Opinion is more divided about Thorndike&#x27;s qualities as an actress. Sheridan Morley enlarged on Gielgud&#x27;s comment, writing that she was not only the most loved actress but &quot;one might add also the best&quot;. Gielgud thought her very fine in her playing of tragedy − &quot;she was one of the few actresses of her generation who dared even to attempt it [and] riveted her audiences with her superb authority and vocal power&quot; − but he thought her inclined to &quot;hit too hard&quot; in comedy. Hallam Tennyson felt &quot;she over-elocuted: she was the last trace of the Irving-Terry era in which the important thing was to speak beautifully and clearly and be heard throughout the auditorium&quot;. Paul Scofield thought her &quot;a glorious actress who suggested immense power. She aimed at the big targets, and used every ounce of her being to do justice to great classical themes&quot;.

<doc id="1114062" wikidata="Q853543" url="?curid=1114062" title="British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification">
<text>A number of different numbering and classification schemes were used for locomotives and multiple units operated by British Railways (BR), and this page explains the principal systems. This section also covers the post-privatisation period, as the broad numbering and classification arrangements have not altered since the break-up of BR.

Locomotives and multiple units (the majority being self-propelled) have frequently had similar arrangements for classification and numbering, so are considered together here. There are also links to other pages that deal in greater depth with the particulars of individual types.

==Constituent companies==
In 1948, BR inherited a variety of locomotives and multiple units from the Big Four railway companies and some smaller concerns. Details of the numbering and classification systems used by the Big Four companies are covered in the following pages:
* Great Western Railway: GWR locomotive numbering and classification
* Southern Railway: SR locomotive numbering and classification and SR multiple unit numbering and classification
* London, Midland and Scottish Railway: LMS locomotive numbering and classification
* London and North Eastern Railway: LNER locomotive numbering and classification

In the main, new locomotives and multiple units built by BR to pre-nationalisation designs were numbered and classified according to the principles applied by the relevant Big Four company.

==1948 numbering and classification==
Immediately after nationalisation, BR had to decide how to number and classify the stock it had inherited from the Big Four companies, and how newly built stock would be included. In the main, it decided to simply adapt what was already there.

===Locomotives===
The classification systems of the Big Four were left unchanged for the inherited locomotives. However, BR decided to adopt the LMS power classification system as its preferred model and all inherited locomotives received a classification in this series as well as their traditional classification.

In order to remove the duplications of locomotive numbers, all locomotives were placed into a new number series as follows:

This approach meant that the numbering arrangements adopted by the pre-Nationalisation companies were retained in the new system, and new locomotives built to the designs of the old companies were numbered appropriately in their series. Locomotives inherited from smaller concerns were numbered in the most appropriate regional list, e.g. ex-East Kent Railway stock utilised blank numbers in the 3xxxx ex-SR series.

The new series for diesel, petrol, gas and electric locomotives were arranged as follows:

===Modern traction===
Numbering of electric multiple units was undertaken on a regional basis, with each region having its own series commencing from 001. Most diesel multiple units were not allocated unit numbers, though in later years numbers were allocated on a regional basis in the Scottish and Western regions, and by individual depots elsewhere. For more details on these series, see British Rail Regional Multiple Unit Numbering.

To classify electric stock, a two-letter prefix was used to indicate what type it was, followed by a number issued sequentially from 1. This was a system adapted from that used by the LNER for its electric stock (e.g. EM1, see here). The additional prefixes used were:
* AL: AC electric locomotive
* AM: AC electric multiple unit

The Eastern and North Eastern regions used a series of different classifications for diesel locomotives. The first method was also adapted from the old LNER system, and applied only to diesel shunters operating on those regions. It comprised a prefix, indicating the transmission type and wheel arrangement, followed by a number allocated sequentially from 1. The prefixes used were:
* DEJ: Diesel-electric, 0-6-0 wheel arrangement
* DJ: Diesel-mechanical or hydraulic, 0-6-0 wheel arrangement
* DY: Diesel-mechanical or hydraulic, 0-4-0 wheel arrangement

The second classification system was developed in 1955 and applied to all types then in existence on British Rail. It was based on the format Dx/y, where x was the power of the locomotive in hundreds of horsepower and y was a number allocated sequentially to specific types (e.g. D1/1 would be a shunter with a 100 to 199 hp (75 to 148 kW) rating, D33/1 would be a Type 5 locomotive). The series was extensively re-arranged in 1962 in a somewhat confusing way, but following the same basic principles.

The Southern Region followed existing numbering (for its multiple units) and classification systems (for both multiple units and locomotives) inherited from the SR. The EMU classification system (e.g. 4SUB, see here) system was also extended to include their diesel-electric multiple units, but with a single letter. Locomotives were given a two-letter code, with the second letter indicating detail differences within the main type. For instance, what were to become Class 33 locomotives from 1973, were Class KA or KB depending on whether they were the standard design or that fitted for push-pull working with 4TC units.

==1957 numbering and classification==
In the early period of British Railways, steam locomotion had continued to be of prime importance. Apart from a growing selection of diesel shunters, there had been almost no development of mainline diesel or electric traction beyond the few locomotives ordered by the Big Four companies.

The 1955 Modernisation Plan heralded big changes in this situation, and from 1957 a new numbering system was used for diesel and electric locomotives ordered by British Railways, including those shunters ordered before 1957, which were renumbered into the new system. All steam and gas-turbine locomotives, and diesel and electric locomotives built to pre-nationalisation orders retained their existing numbers under the 1948 arrangements, though some had a &#x27;D&#x27; or &#x27;E&#x27; prefix added to their number in error.

===Diesel locomotives===
The numbering system matched up the new &#x27;Type&#x27; classification that had been adopted for diesel traction, and which was based on the power of the locomotive. The broad categories were as follows:

Of the shunters that were renumbered, the only transparent renumbering was for those that had been numbered in the 13xxx series, for which the &#x27;1&#x27; was simply replaced with a &#x27;D&#x27;. All the others were completely renumbered to separate out the different classes.

As always, there were some oddities. The 650 hp diesel hydraulic locomotives later Class 14 were numbered from D9500 upwards. When the Type 2 series got too crowded later on, new Sulzer Type 2 locomotives (later class 25) were numbered from D7500 upwards. Some experimental locomotives carried D0xxx numbers.

When the last mainline steam locomotive was withdrawn in August 1968 (leaving only three on the self-contained narrow gauge Vale of Rheidol Railway), the &#x27;D&#x27; prefix was dropped.

===Electric locomotives===
The numbering system was divided into two series, one for AC locomotives and one for DC locomotives. DC locomotives were numbered from E5000 upwards, and DC electro-diesel locomotives, with a diesel generator for working off electrified lines, were numbered from E6000 upwards.

For AC locomotives, the first number was to be an indication of power. For example, if the power was in the range 2000 to 2999 hp, it would be numbered between E2000-E2999, and so on. In fact, apart from E2001 (the prototype AC locomotive, converted from a gas turbine locomotive, later Class 80), all AC locomotives were numbered from E3001 upwards. When new 5000 hp locomotives were under construction (later Class 87), these were allocated numbers from E3201 upwards, though they never carried these numbers as the 1973 arrangements were already in place by the time the first one was built.

==1973 numbering and classification - TOPS==
At the end of the 1960s, British Rail adopted the Total Operations Processing System (TOPS), a computerised system developed by IBM, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company and Stanford University in the United States. All types of locomotive received a TOPS classification, and multiple units were later included according to this broad division:

From late 1970, British Rail started to apply new numbers to locomotives and multiple units based on the TOPS classification system, the first classes to be dealt with being the LNER-design EM1 type (TOPS class 76) and the AL3 and AL4 types of AC electric locomotives (TOPS classes 83 and 84). The format of these numbers is xxxyyy, where xxx is the class number and yyy the unique identifier for that locomotive or unit. All locomotive classes have unique identifiers that commence at xx001, except classes 43 (High Speed Train power cars, originally classified as multiple-unit vehicles), 97 and 98 (departmental and steam locomotives). Multiple unit classes are treated differently, because an attempt has been made to give units working within the same region or sector unique identifiers (for more information see British Rail Regional Multiple Unit Numbering). In recent years, unit numbers have also been tied in with the numbers of the carriages within a unit (e.g. 150201 is formed of carriages 52201 and 57201). As a result, very few multiple unit classes commence from xxx001.

Where there are variations within a class, subclasses are used in the format xxx/y. When the main renumbering scheme was published in 1973, many sub-classes were redesignated to better align the locomotives to be numbered in that sub-class with the sub-class number. Thus, class 47 was originally divided into sub-classes 47/1 (locomotives fitted with steam-heating equipment), 47/2 (not fitted with train-heating equipment) and 47/3 (fitted with electric train-heating equipment), but in 1973 these sub-classes were redesignated 47/0, 47/3 and 47/4. Usually, the subclass is connected to the first digit of the unique identifier, so that the first locomotive in subclass 47/3 was 47301. However, some caution is required on this point for the following reasons:
* Where there are more than 100 examples in a subclass the identifier becomes obscured, e.g. 31201 is in subclass 31/1, which runs from 31101 to 31327.
* Some classes renumbered from the 1957 arrangements simply had consecutive numbers from xx001, which ignored the subclasses identified, e.g. 25033 was in subclass 25/1.
* Where numbers within a class became congested, it wasn&#x27;t always possible to make the connection, e.g. locomotives in subclass 47/2 were fitted with Green Circle multiple-working equipment but retained their original numbers. In other cases it wasn&#x27;t possible to start from xxxy01, e.g. subclass 08/9 started from 08991 because subclass 08/0 ran from 08001 to 08958.
* Because of the different arrangements for numbering multiple units (see above), subclasses may have no link to the unique identifier at all; this is especially true on the Southern Region. Sometimes, where there is a principal run of units and a small variant subclass, the majority will be subclass xxx/0 whatever their identifier, but the variant&#x27;s subclass does reflect the identifier, e.g. Subclass 302/0 for the standard passenger units (302201-312) and 302/9 for the postal units (302990-302993).

So far as renumbering from the 1957 arrangements was concerned, most locomotives retained the last two digits of their number, though some classes were renumbered without reference to their previous numbers. This was usually where sub-classes had already been or were in the process of being created (for example classes 45 and 47, in which some members were being fitted with electric train heating equipment, and 86, subject to various modifications, mainly to the suspension). The other exception was if the first locomotive of a class had carried a number ending in &quot;00&quot; under the 1957 arrangements, because TOPS could not handle numbers ending in &quot;00&quot;. These were either renumbered at the end of the class (e.g. the prototype class 50 D400 became 50050), or took a vacant number of another class member that had already been withdrawn (e.g. prototype class 24 D5000 became 24005, D5005 having been withdrawn in 1969), or were renumbered at the end of a sub-group within the class. Class 20 was particularly complicated in this respect. The class had been built in batches between 1957 and 1967 and all 228 members were still in service when the TOPS renumbering scheme was drawn up, but instead of class prototype D8000 being renumbered 20228 at the end of the class (which was not divided into sub-classes) it became 20050, displaced D8050 became 20128, and D8128 in turn became 20228.

The situation was different for multiple units. Where unit numbers were carried, they were usually three-digit already. TOPS simply prefixed these existing unit numbers with the newly allocated TOPS class number. The process was more complicated on the Southern Region, which used four-digit unit numbers and where a more general unit renumbering was required so that the first number of the unit coincided with the last digit of the class number. Many diesel multiple units were not kept in regular formations, so did not have existing unit numbers, and this situation was not changed under TOPS (except following refurbishment).

The TOPS system has been perpetuated by the privatisation of British Rail, though the allocation of classes and numbers appears to have become more random and less governed by the rules followed by British Rail (but even they made exceptions). See British Carriage and Wagon Numbering and Classification for an explanation of how TOPS applied also to carriages and wagons.

Please Note: This section explains the successful application of TOPS to multiple unit stock, the arrangement that persists today. However, there was an earlier attempt to apply TOPS that differed from the arrangement set out below. More details about the first arrangement may be found here.

===Locomotives===
The series of locomotive classes were allocated according to the following pattern:
The following table shows in more detail how the classification of diesel locomotives was overlaid on the 1957 classification by Type:
AC electric locomotive classes AL1 to AL6 became 81-86 in order. Class 01 was subsequently reused to register any ex-industrial/Ministry of Defence shunters used on the national network regardless of horsepower.

===Multiple units===
The multiple unit series were divided up as follows:

AC electric multiple units AM1-AM11 became 301-311 in order (in fact the AM1 units had already been withdrawn, so Class 301 was never actually used). The 1xx and 2xx series were originally arranged so that driving motors, driving trailers and trailer cars all had their own individual class numbers (presumably because these units were more prone to being reformed), but this was subsequently revised so that each type of unit had a single class number, as allocated to the driving motor car.

Whereas within most ranges class numbers were allocated sequentially as new types were constructed, the Southern Region adopted a more complicated system for their electric multiple units, with the second and third digits indicating in more detail the type of unit. Second digits were allocated as follows:
Third digits were allocated as follows:
Of course, many exceptions arose over time. One major change was to change the classification of unpowered trailer units from 49x numbers to 4x8 numbers (which involved reclassifying Class 491 to Class 438). When Southern Region unit numbers were changed to fit with the TOPS classification system, former 4x0 classes were all reclassified to 4x2. This was necessary because Southern Region units only displayed the last four digits of their six-digit TOPS number, and it was decided that no painted unit number should commence with a &#x27;0&#x27;. It is worth noting that despite only showing the last four digits, the actual number of the unit was still the six-digit TOPS number. This often causes confusion both to enthusiasts and those outside the field alike.

==2011 numbering and classification alterations and extensions - TOPS==
In September 2011, the UK Rail Safety and Standards Board issued Railway Group Standard GM/RT2453,&lt;ref name=&quot;RGS GM/RT2453&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which made some alterations to the TOPS classes allocated to various types of locomotive and multiple unit - primarily extending the number ranges for certain types of locomotives and multiple units where the previous allocation ranges were becoming exhausted. The standard also provided for the allocation of European Vehicle Numbers to most mainline rail vehicles in Britain, as part of the implementation of EC Directive 2008/57/EC (the Railway Interoperability Directive). Allocations made prior to the introduction of the GM/RT2453 standard were not changed.

Railway Group Standard GM/RT2453 was superseded in December 2017 by Rail Industry Standard RIS-2453-RST, which introduced the requirement for all new rail vehicles receiving authorisation to enter service in Britain after 1 January 2018 to display their full 12-digit European Vehicle Number regardless of whether or not the vehicle is intended for use only on domestic services. Allocations made prior to the introduction of the RIS-2453-RST standard were not changed.

The RIS-2453-RST allocation ranges are as follows:

<doc id="1114063" wikidata="Q1060425" url="?curid=1114063" title="Ingrown nail">
<text>An ingrown nail, also known as onychocryptosis (from () &#x27;nail&#x27; and () &#x27;hidden&#x27;) is a common form of nail disease. It is an often painful condition in which the nail grows so that it cuts into one or both sides of the paronychium or nail bed. While ingrown nails can occur in the nails of both the hands and the feet, they occur most commonly with the toenails (as opposed to fingernails).

A common misconception is that the cause of an ingrown toenail is the nail growing into the paronychium, but it can also be caused by overgrown toe skin. The condition is caused by a microbial inflammation of the paronychium causing a granuloma within which the nail is buried. A true &quot;ingrown toenail&quot; is caused by actual penetration of flesh by a of toenail.
==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms include pain along the margins of the nail caused by hypergranulation, worsening of pain when wearing tight footwear, and sensitivity to pressure of any kind (in some cases this pressure can be as light as the weight of bedsheets). Bumping of an affected toe can cause pain as the nail&#x27;s surrounding tissue is punctured further. Ingrown nails can become easily infected unless care is taken early to treat the condition.

Signs of infection include redness and swelling of the area around the nail, drainage of pus, and watery discharge tinged with blood. The main symptom is swelling at the base of the nail on the ingrowing side (though it may be present on both sides).

Onychocryptosis should not be confused with irregular nail growth patterns such as convex nails, involuted nails, or pincer nails. It also should not be confused with the presence of small corns, callus, or debris down the nail sulci.

==Causes==

The main contributor to onychocryptosis is footwear, particularly ill-fitting shoes with inadequate toe box room and tight stockings that apply pressure to the top or side of the foot. Other factors may include the damp atmosphere of enclosed shoes, which soften the nail plate and cause swelling on the epidermal keratin (eventually increasing the convex arch permanently), genetics, trauma, and disease. Improper cutting of the nail may cause the nail to cut into the side-fold skin from growth and impact, whether or not the nail is truly &quot;ingrown&quot;. The nail bends inwards or upwards depending on the angle of its cut. If the cutting tool, such as scissors, is at an attitude in which the lower blade is closer to the toe than the upper blade, the toenail will tend to grow upwards from its base, and vice versa. The process is visible along the nail as it grows, appearing as a warp advancing to the end of the nail. The upper corners turn more easily than the center of the nail tip. Holding the tool at the same angle for all nails may induce these conditions; as the nail turns closer to the skin, it becomes harder to fit the lower blade in the right attitude under the nail. When cutting a nail, it is not just the correct angle that is important, but also how short it is cut. A shorter cut will bend the nail more, unless the cut is even on both top and bottom of the nail.

Causes may include:
* Shoes causing a bunching of the toes in the developmental stages of the foot (frequently in people under 21), which can cause the nail to curl and dig into the skin. This is particularly the case in ill-fitting shoes that are too narrow or too short, but any toed shoes may cause an ingrown nail.
* Poor nail care, including cutting the nail too short, rounded off at the tip or peeled off at the edges instead of being cut straight across.
* Broken toenails.
* Trauma to the nail plate or toe, which can occur by dropping objects on or stubbing the toenail, or by the nail protruding through the shoe (as during sports or other vigorous activity), can cause the flesh to become injured and the nail to grow irregularly and press into the flesh.
* Predisposition, such as abnormally shaped nail beds, nail deformities caused by diseases or a genetic susceptibility, increases the chance of an ingrown nail, but the ingrowth cannot occur without pressure from a shoe.
* A bacterial infection, treatable with antibiotics.

One study compared patients with ingrown toenails to healthy controls and found no difference in the shape of toenails between those of patients and of the control group. The study suggested that treatment should not be based on the correction of a non-existent nail deformity. In some cases, however, there is nail deformity.

Ingrown toenails are caused by weight-bearing (activities such as walking and running) in patients that have too much soft skin tissue on the sides of their nail. Weight bearing causes this excessive amount of skin to bulge up along the sides of the nail. The pressure on the skin around the nail results in the tissue being damaged, resulting in swelling, redness and infection. Many treatments are directed at the nail itself and often include partial or full removal of the healthy nail. However, failure to treat the cutaneous condition can result in a return of the ingrowth and a deformity or mutilation of the nail.

== Prevention ==
The most common digit to become ingrown is the big toe, but ingrowth can occur on any nail. Ingrown nails can be avoided by cutting nails straight across; not along a curve, not too short and no shorter than the flesh around it. Footwear that is too small or too narrow, or with too shallow a &quot;toe box&quot;, will exacerbate any underlying problem with a toenail. Sharp square corners may be uncomfortable and cause snagging on socks. Proper cutting leaves the leading edge of the nail free of the flesh, precluding it from growing into the toe. Filing of the corner is reasonable.

Some nails require cutting of the corners far back to remove edges that dig into the flesh; this is often done as a partial wedge resection by a podiatrist. Ingrown toe nails can be caused by injury, commonly blunt trauma in which the flesh is pressed against the nail causing a small cut that swells. Injury to the nail can cause it to grow abnormally, making it wider or thicker than normal, or even bulged or crooked.

==Management==
The treatment of an ingrown toenail partly depends on its severity.

===Conservative treatment===
Mild to moderate cases are often treated conservatively with warm water and epsom salt soaks, antibacterial ointment and the use of dental floss. If conservative treatment of a minor ingrown toenail does not succeed, or if the ingrown toenail is severe, surgical treatment may be required. A &quot;gutter splint&quot; may be improvised by slicing a cotton-tipped wooden applicator diagonally to form a bevel and using this to insert a wisp of cotton from the applicator head under the nail to lift it from the underlying skin after a foot soak.

Some over-the-counter ingrown toenail pain relief kits include a sodium sulfide gel with cushions and elastic bandages.

===Nail bracing===

Nail bracing is more conservative than surgery, but less widely used. Nail braces work by gently lifting the sides of the toenail and eventually retraining the nail to grow to a flatter shape over time. The total time needed for the nail to be reshaped is one full nail growth or about 18 months. There are two main types of nail braces: adhesive and hooked. Adhesive nail braces are generally made of a thin strip of composite material that is glued to the top of the nail. The strip naturally tries to return to a flat state and lifts the edges of the nails in the process. Hooked nail braces consist of a hook (usually made of dental wire) placed under either side of the nail with some type of tensioning system pulling the hooks together.

Because of the curved shape of the nail, the tensioning device rests on the higher middle of the nail by applying upward pressure to the sides of the nail. In studies of diabetics, who need to avoid surgery when possible, nail bracing was found to be effective at providing immediate, as well as long-term, relief.

===Surgery===
Surgical treatment for an ingrown nail is carried out by a podiatrist, a foot and ankle specialist. This is typically an in-office procedure requiring local anesthesia and special surgical instruments. The surgical approach is the removal of the offending part of the nail plate known as a wedge resection. If the ingrown toenail recurs despite this treatment, destruction of the sides of the nail with chemicals or excision is done; this is known as a matrixectomy. Antibiotics may be used after the procedure but are not recommended, as they may delay healing. Surgical treatment for ingrown nails is more effective at preventing the nail from regrowing inwards compared to non-surgical treatments.

<text>Aortic valve replacement is a cardiac surgery procedure whereby a failing aortic valve is replaced with an artificial heart valve. The aortic valve may need to be replaced because of aortic regurgitation (back flow), or if the valve is narrowed by stenosis.

Current methods for aortic valve replacement include open-heart surgery, &quot;minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS)&quot;, &quot;surgical aortic valve replacement&quot; (SAVR) and percutaneous or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR; also PAVR, PAVI, TAVI).

A cardiologist can evaluate whether a heart valve repair or valve replacement would be of benefit.

== History ==

During the late 1940s and early 1950s, the first surgical approaches towards treating aortic valve stenosis had limited success. The first attempts were valvotomies, (i.e. cutting the valve while the heart is pumping). A ball valve prosthesis placed on the descending thoracic aorta (heterotopically) was developed by Hufnagel, Harvey and others to address aortic stenosis, but had disastrous complications. Later, with the innovation of cardiopulmonary bypass, the ball valve prosthesis was placed orthotopically (i.e. in same place as the original aortic valve). This first generation of prosthetic valves was durable, but needed intense anti-coagulation, and cardiac hemodynamics were compromised. During the mid-1950s, a single-leaflet prosthesis was developed by Bahnson &quot;et al&quot;. In early 1960, Ross and Barratt-Boyes used allografts. Tissue prosthetic valves were introduced in 1965 by Binet in Paris, but they degenerated quickly because the tissue was insufficiently preserved. Carpentier solved this problem by introducing glutaraldehyde-preserved stent-mounted porcine valves.

== Anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology ==


The aortic valve is one of the two semilunar valves of the heart with three cusps. It separates the heart from the aorta. Each cusp is attached to the aortic wall creating a sinus called an aortic sinus. The origins of the two coronary arteries are sited in two aortic sinuses. Cusps also known as leaflets are separated by commissures. The posterior leaflet is in continuation with the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (the tissue is called the aorto-mitral curtain). The aortic valve is opened during systole, the driving force for it to open is the difference in pressure between the contracting left ventricle of the heart and the aorta. During cardiac diastole (when the heart chamber gets bigger) the aortic valve closes.

Aortic stenosis most commonly is the result of calcification of the cusps. Other reasons for stenosis are the bicuspid valve (some patients have only two cusps at the aortic valve instead of the usual three) and rheumatic aortic stenosis (now rare in the West). Obstruction at the level of the aortic valve causes increased pressure within the heart&#x27;s left ventricle. This can lead to hypertrophy and ultimately dysfunction of the heart. While x-ray and ECG might indicate aortic stenosis, echocardiography is the diagnostic procedure of choice. US findings also help in grading the severity of the disease. In cases of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, AVR is warranted. In cases of asymptomatic but severe aortic stenosis, more factors should be taken into consideration.

Aortic regurgitation, on the other hand, has many causes: degeneration of the cusps, endocarditis, bicuspid aortic valve, aortic root dilatation, trauma, connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos lead to imperfect closure of the valve during diastole, hence the blood is returning from the aorta towards the left ventricle of the heart. Acute aortic regurgitation (caused by endocarditis, aortic dissection or trauma) ends up in pulmonary edema, because of the acute increase in left ventricle (LVEDP) that does not have time to adjust to the regurgitation. Chronic regurgitation, by contrast, gives the heart time to change shape, resulting in &quot;eccentric hypertrophy&quot;, which has disastrous effects on the myocardium. Ultrasound is here also the best diagnostic mobility, either it is transthoracic or transesophageal. 

== Indications for surgery ==

=== Guidelines for aortic valve replacement ===
As long-term data on the survival and quality of life of people following valve replacement have become available, evidence-based guidelines for aortic valve replacement have been developed. These help healthcare professionals decide when aortic valve replacement is the best option for a patient. Two widely accepted sets of guidelines used by surgeons and cardiologists are the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Valvular Heart Disease, and the European Society of Cardiology and the European Association for Cardio‑Thoracic Surgery Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease.

=== Aortic stenosis ===

Aortic stenosis is treated with aortic valve replacement in order to avoid angina, syncope, or congestive heart failure. Individuals with severe aortic stenosis are candidates for aortic valve replacement once they develop symptoms or when their heart function is impacted. Some people with asymptomatic aortic stenosis may also be candidates for aortic valve replacement, especially if symptoms appear during exercise testing. Patients with moderate aortic valve stenosis who need another type of cardiac surgery (i.e. coronary artery bypass surgery) should also have their valve addressed by the surgical team if echocardiography unveils significant heart problems.

Low gradient aortic stenosis with concomitant left ventricular dysfunction poses a significant question to the anesthesiologist and the patient. Stress echocardiography (i.e. with dobutamine infusion) can help determine if the ventricle is dysfunctional because of aortic stenosis, or because the myocardium lost its ability to contract.

=== Aortic insufficiency ===
Many people with aortic insufficiency often do not develop symptoms until they have had the condition for many years. Aortic valve replacement is indicated for symptoms such as shortness of breath, and in cases where the heart has begun to enlarge (dilate) from pumping the increased volume of blood that leaks back through the valve.

==Types of valves==
There are two basic types of replacement heart valve: tissue (bioprosthetic) valves and mechanical valves.

===Tissue valves===

Tissue heart valves are usually made from animal tissue (heterografts) mounted on a metal or polymer support. Bovine (cow) tissue is most commonly used, but some are made from porcine (pig) tissue. The tissue is treated to prevent rejection and calcification (where calcium builds up on the replacement valve and stops it working properly).

Occasionally, alternatives to animal tissue valves are used: aortic homografts and pulmonary autografts. An aortic homograft is an aortic valve from a human donor, retrieved either after their death or from their heart if they are undergoing a heart transplant. A pulmonary autograft, also known as the Ross procedure is where the aortic valve is removed and replaced with the patient&#x27;s own pulmonary valve (the valve between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery). A pulmonary homograft (a pulmonary valve taken from a cadaver) is then used to replace the patient&#x27;s own pulmonary valve. This procedure was first performed in 1967 and is used primarily in children, as it allows the patient&#x27;s own pulmonary valve (now in the aortic position) to grow with the child.

Tissue valves can last 10–20 years. However, they tend to deteriorate more quickly in younger patients. New ways of preserving the tissue for longer are being investigated. One such preservation treatment is now being used in a commercially available tissue heart valve. In sheep and rabbit studies, the tissue (called RESILIA tissue) had less calcification than control tissue. Mid-term data on the safety and haemodynamic performance of the Inspiris RESILIA aortic bioprosthesis are encouraging.

Stented and stentless tissue valves are available. Stented valves come in sizes from 19 mm to 29 mm. Stentless valves are directly sutured at the aortic root. The major advantage of stentless valves is that they limit patient–prosthesis mismatch (when the area of the prosthetic valve is too small in relation to the size of the patient, increasing the pressure inside the valve) and can be helpful when dealing with small aortic root. However, stentless valves take more time than stented valves to implant.

===Mechanical valves===
Mechanical valves are made from synthetic materials, such as titanium or pyrolytic carbon. Their durability is long life, while tissue valves can last for up to 15–20 years. Since the risk of blood clots forming is higher with mechanical valves than with tissue valves, patients with mechanical heart valves are required to take anticoagulant (blood-thinning) drugs, such as warfarin, long-life, making them more prone to bleeding (1% per year). The sound of the valve can be heard very rarely, often as clicks, and might be disturbing. The choice of prosthetic valve should be individualized, carefully considering each patient&#x27;s unique circumstances. In that context, the new generation aortic mechanical valve (On-X) offers a potential lifetime solution without need for a repeat operation, while minimizing the risks of long-term anticoagulation due to reduced anticoagulation target INR of 1.5 to 2.0.

===Valve selection===

Valve choice is a balance between the lower durability of tissue valves and the increased risk of blood clots and bleeding with mechanical valves. Guidelines suggest that patient age, lifestyle and medical history should all be considered when choosing a valve. Tissue valves deteriorate more rapidly in young patients and during pregnancy, but they are preferable for women who wish to have children because pregnancy increases the risk of blood clots. Typically, a mechanical valve is considered for patients under 60 years old, while a tissue valve is considered for patients over the age of 65 years.

==Surgical replacement==

Surgical aortic valve replacement is conventionally done through a median sternotomy, meaning the incision is made by cutting through the breastbone (sternum). Once the protective membrane around the heart (pericardium) has been opened, the patient is cannulated (aortic cannulation by a cannula placed on the aorta and a venous canulation by a single atrial venous cannula inserted through the right atrium). The patient is put on a cardiopulmonary bypass machine, also known as the heart–lung machine. This machine breathes for the patient and pumps their blood around their body while the surgeon replaces the heart valve.

Once on cardiopulmonary bypass, the patient&#x27;s heart is stopped (cardioplegia). This can be done with a Y-type cardioplegic infusion catheter placed on the aorta, de-aired and connected to the cardiopulmonary bypass machine. Alternatively, a retrograde cardioplegic cannula can be inserted at the coronary sinus. Some surgeons also opt to place a vent in the left ventricle through the right superior pulmonary vein, because this helps to prevent left ventricular distention before and after cardiac arrest. When the set-up is ready, the aorta is clamped shut with a cross-clamp to stop blood pumping through the heart and cardioplegia is infused. The surgeon incises the aorta a few milometers above the sinotubular junction (just above the coronary ostia, where the coronary arteries join the aorta) – a process known as aortotomy. After this, cardioplegia is delivered directly through the ostia.

The heart is now still and the surgeon removes the patient&#x27;s diseased aortic valve. The cusps of the aortic valve are excised, and calcium is removed (debrided) from the aortic annulus. The surgeon measures the size of the aortic annulus and fits a mechanical or tissue valve of the appropriate size. Usually the valve is fixed in place with sutures, although some sutureless valves are available. If the patient&#x27;s aortic root is very small, the sutures are placed outside of the aortic root instead of at the annulus, to gain some extra space.

Once the valve is in place and the aorta has been closed, patient is placed in a Trendelenburg position and the heart is de-aired and restarted. The patient is taken off the cardiopulmonary bypass machine. Transesophageal echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart done through the esophagus) can be used to verify that the new valve is functioning properly. Pacing wires are usually put in place, so that the heart can be manually controlled should any complications arise after surgery. Drainage tubes are also inserted, to drain fluids from the chest. These are usually removed within 36 hours, while the pacing wires are generally left in place until right before the patient is discharged from the hospital.

=== Hospital stay and recovery time ===
After surgical aortic valve replacement, the patient will usually stay in an intensive care unit for 12–36 hours. Unless complications arise, the patient is then able to go home after approximately four to seven days. Common complications include disturbances to the heart&#x27;s rhythm (heart block), which typically require the permanent insertion of a cardiac pacemaker.

Recovery from aortic valve replacement takes about three months if the patient is in good health. Patients are advised not to lift anything heavier than 10 lbs for several weeks, and not to do any heavy lifting for 4–6 months after surgery to avoid damaging their breastbone. Often patients will be referred to participate in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, which optimizes recovery and physical function in patients with recent cardiac surgeries. This can be done in an outpatient setting.

=== Outcomes ===

Surgery usually relieves the aortic disease symptoms that led the patient to the operating room. The survival curve of patients who undergo aortic valve replacements is slightly inferior to the curve of their corresponding healthy same-aged same sex population. Pre-operative severe left ventricular hypertrophy is a contributing factor to morbidity.

The risk of dying as a result of aortic valve replacement is estimated at 1–3%. Combining aortic valve replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting increases the risk of mortality. Older patients, as well as those who are frail and/or have other health problems (comorbidities), have a higher risk of experiencing complications. Possible problems include cardiac infarction or failure, arrhythmia or heart block typically requiring the permanent insertion of a cardiac pacemaker, mediastinal bleeding, stroke and infection. Late complications include endocarditis, thromboembolic events (blood clots), prosthetic valve dysfunction and paravalvular leak (blood flowing between the edge of the prosthetic valve and the cardiac tissue).

====Patient–prosthesis mismatch====

When dealing with a small aortic annulus, the surgeon might have to insert a prosthetic aortic valve of small size, with an orifice too small in relation to the size of the patient (patient–prosthesis mismatch). This increases the pressure of the blood flowing through the valve, and can lead to worse outcomes. Various techniques, including stentless valves, have been utilized to avoid this problem.

== Less invasive procedures ==

=== Minimally invasive cardiac surgery ===

Since the late 1990s, some cardiac surgeons have been performing aortic valve replacement using an approach referred to as minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS). Using this approach, the surgeon replaces the valve through a smaller chest incision (6–10 cm) than that for a median sternotomy. MICS typically requires shorter recovery times, and produces less visible scarring. Alternatively, aortic valve replacement can be performed with right minithoracotomy approach via the 2nd or 3rd intercostal space. There is growing evidence that this approach can reduce postoperative morbidity allowing less blood loss, less pain,
faster recovery, and a shorter hospital stay with no difference in mortality. This approach can be particularly valuable in higher risk and elderly patients.

=== Transcatheter aortic valve replacement ===

Another alternative for many high-risk or elderly patients is transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR, also known as TAVI, transcatheter aortic valve implantation). Rather than removing the existing valve, the new valve is pushed through it in a collapsed state. It is delivered to the site of the existing valve through a tube called a catheter, which may be inserted through the femoral artery in the thigh (transfemoral approach), or using a small incision in the chest and then through a large artery or the tip of the left ventricle (transapical approach). Fluoroscopy and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) are visual aids used to guide the process. Once the collapsed replacement valve is in place it is expanded, pushing the old valve&#x27;s leaflets out of the way.

Guidelines suggest TAVR for most patients aged 75 years and older, and surgical aortic valve replacement for most younger patients. Ultimately, the choice of treatment is based on many factors.

Systematic reviews have addressed this comparison:
* &quot;In patients with severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease, TAVR + PCI was associated with greater all-cause mortality at follow-up compared with SAVR + CABG.&quot;
* &quot;Among older low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, TAVR is associated with a lower rate of death or disabling stroke compared with SAVR&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Sabalo&quot; (SS-302), a , was the first submarine and second ship of the United States Navy to be named sabalo, another name for the Atlantic tarpon, a large, silvery game fish of the herring group, found in the warmer parts of the Western Atlantic.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sabalo&quot; (SS-302) was laid down on 5 June 1943 by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; launched on 4 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Martha C. Oman, wife of Rear Admiral Charles M. Oman (ret.), commander of the U S Naval Convalescent Hospital in Monroe, New York; and commissioned on 19 June 1945 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in Philadelphia.

==Service history==
After trials in the Delaware River, &quot;Sabalo&quot; proceeded to Naval Submarine Base New London at New London, Connecticut, for shakedown and training. She operated locally from New London until June 1946, when she began preparations for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 7 August 1946 at Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, and was placed in reserve in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, remaining there until recommissioning on 1 June 1951 at the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, New London.

In August 1951, &quot;Sabalo&quot; departed New London for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, her new home port. Arriving in September 1951, she conducted local operations into February 1952. From 18 February to 28 September 1952, she underwent conversion to a Fleet Snorkel type at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. This was a less-extensive alteration than the GUPPY conversion received by many World War IIera fleet submarines during the same general period. &quot;Sabalo&quot;′s conning tower was replaced by a new streamlined sail, but retained her original hull form.

Following this conversion, &quot;Sabalo&quot; alternated local operations with simulated war patrols while deployed to the western Pacific. The first deployment, from 26 December 1952 to 26 June 1953, was followed by a second from mid-November 1954 to 10 May 1955. Her third deployment, from 17 September to 4 November 1955, was conducted off the Territory of Alaska and among the eastern Aleutian Islands.

In September 1966, &quot;Sabalo&quot;&#x27;s home port changed to San Diego, California, and she resumed training operations off the United States West Coast, primarily providing services to ships undergoing anti-submarine warfare, type, and refresher training. &quot;Sabalo&quot; served in that capacity as a unit of the United States First Fleet until decommissioned on 1 July 1971.

==Disposal==
Struck from the Navy Register onn the day she was decommissioned, she was sunk as a target in SubSinkEx Project &quot;Thurber&quot; off San Diego on 21 February 1973. Some sources indicate that the sinking was by deliberate partial flooding to acquire acoustic data on submarine implosions.

<doc id="1114080" wikidata="Q421115" url="?curid=1114080" title="Wurtzite">
<text>Wurtzite is a zinc and iron sulfide mineral with the chemical formula , a less frequently encountered structural polymorph form of sphalerite. The iron content is variable up to eight percent. It is trimorphous with matraite and sphalerite.

It occurs in hydrothermal deposits associated with sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, barite and marcasite. It also occurs in low-temperature clay-ironstone concretions.

It was first described in 1861 for an occurrence in the San José Mine, Oruro City, Cercado Province, Oruro Department, Bolivia, and named for French chemist Charles-Adolphe Wurtz. It has widespread distribution. In Europe it is reported from Příbram, Czech Republic; Hesse, Germany; and Liskeard, Cornwall, England. In the US it is reported from Litchfield County, Connecticut; Butte, Silver Bow County, Montana; at Frisco, Beaver County, Utah; and from the Joplin district, Jasper County, Missouri.

==Structure==

The wurtzite group includes cadmoselite (CdSe), greenockite (CdS), mátraite (ZnS), and rambergite (MnS), in addition to wurtzite.

Its crystal structure is called the wurtzite crystal structure, to which it lends its name. This structure is a member of the hexagonal crystal system and consists of tetrahedrally coordinated zinc and sulfur atoms that are stacked in an ABABABABAB pattern.

The unit cell parameters of wurtzite are (-2H polytype):
*&quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot; = 3.81 Å = 381 pm
*&quot;c&quot; = 6.23 Å = 623 pm
*V = 78.41 Å3

<text>Free Radio Santa Cruz (FRSC) is an unlicensed radio station in Santa Cruz, California, United States. Founded by activists Skidmarkbob Bob, Phil Free and Dennis Davey. The station has been on the air since Spring, 1995; its broadcast content is a mix of daily news, music, and cultural programs, produced both locally and nationally.

Because FRSC does not have a license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the station is in open violation of US federal regulations. Free Radio Santa Cruz allows individuals in the community to have their own shows, and encourages participation through donations, membership in the broadcasting collective, and calling in live during shows.

On September 29, 2004, the station was raided by agents of the FCC, backed by federal marshals armed with assault rifles. No arrests were made, but the agents shut down the station and physically seized nearly all of the equipment, including the transmitter, computers, mixing boards, microphones, headphones, CD players, and CDs. The equipment was never returned.

However, with a strong showing of community support, the station was streaming online again within 48 hours and transmitting at 101.1 FM less than a month after the raid. FRSC continues to stream and broadcast 24 hours a day. As of October 2011, the station is broadcasting on 101.3 MHz.

<doc id="1114084" wikidata="Q1342934" url="?curid=1114084" title="Krusader">
<text>Krusader is an advanced orthodox file manager for KDE and other desktops in the Unix world. It is similar to the console-based GNU Midnight Commander, GNOME Commander for the GNOME desktop environment, or Total Commander for Windows, all of which can trace their paradigmatic features to the original Norton Commander for DOS. It supports extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP, advanced search, viewer/editor, directory synchronisation, file content comparisons, batch renaming, etc.

It supports the following archive formats: tar, ZIP, bzip2, gzip, RAR, ace, ARJ, LHA, 7z and RPM and can handle other KIO Slaves such as smb or fish.

Krusader is published under GNU GPL-2.0-or-later.

== User interface ==
Krusader&#x27;s user interface is based on the orthodox file manager (OFM) principle, also known as Commander-like file managers, the family of file managers based on the old Norton Commander interface. The orthodox file manager has two windows called panels where one is active and the other inactive. The idea is to manipulate files from active to inactive panel or within the active panel. Only the keyboard is required to do this, which makes the process much faster. Using the mouse is still an option. Krusader&#x27;s deep integration into KDE (e.g. KParts, KIO) allows it to provide several additional services.

== File viewer-editor ==
One of the many tools that Krusader provides is the viewer-editor. Using the KParts object model, Krusader executes components that are capable of viewing (and sometimes editing) specific filetypes and embeds their client area directly into a new Krusader window. This makes it possible (for example) to view an office document directly from within Krusader. Any application that implements the KParts model correctly can be embedded in this fashion.

== Platforms ==
Krusader is primarily developed for the Linux platform, but it is available for some other platforms. These include BSD and Apple Mac OS X. A Windows port is in beta (as of January 9, 2015).

<doc id="1114086" wikidata="Q2905586" url="?curid=1114086" title="Blackrock (film)">
<text>Blackrock is a 1997 Australian teen drama thriller film produced by David Elfick and Catherine Knapman, directed by Steven Vidler with the screenplay by Nick Enright. Marking Vidler&#x27;s directorial debut, the film was adapted from the play of the same name, also written by Enright, which was inspired by the murder of Leigh Leigh. The film stars Laurence Breuls, Simon Lyndon and Linda Cropper, and also features the first credited film performance of Heath Ledger. The film follows Jared (Breuls), a young surfer who witnesses his friends raping a girl. When she is found murdered the next day, Jared is torn between revealing what he saw and protecting his friends.

Leigh&#x27;s family opposed the fictionalisation of her murder, though protests against the film were abandoned after it received financial backing from the New South Wales Film and Television Office. &quot;Blackrock&quot; was filmed over a period of two weeks at locations including Stockton, where Leigh was murdered, a decision that was opposed by local residents who said that memories of the murder were still fresh. While the film was never marketed as being based on a true story, numerous comparisons between the murder and the film were made, and many viewers believed it to be a factual account of the murder.

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and was also shown at the Boston Film Festival, though it failed to find an American theatrical distributor. It was nominated for five AACTA Awards, including Best Film, and won the Feature Film – Adaptation award as well as the Major Award at the 1997 AWGIE Awards. It received generally positive reviews in Australia, where it grossed $1.1 million at the box office. Outside Australia, where audiences were less familiar with Leigh&#x27;s murder, critical reception of the film was mixed.

== Plot ==
Blackrock is an Australian beachside working-class suburb in which surfing is popular among youths like Jared. His first serious girlfriend is Rachel, who comes from a much wealthier part of the city. One day, Ricko, a surfer popular among the local youths, returns from an eleven-month trip. Jared&#x27;s mother, attempts to tell Jared that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer, but Jared insists on talking to her later as he is busy arranging a &quot;welcome home&quot; party for Ricko at the local surf club. Rachel&#x27;s father, a photographer who takes provocative images of women, forbids her from attending the party but allows her older brother, Toby, to attend.

While driving to the party, Toby sees Tracy, Cherie and two other girls and gives them a ride. Jared flirts with Tracy at the party and then gets into a fight with Toby. Ricko comes to Jared&#x27;s defence, but Jared breaks up the fight after Ricko hits Toby several times. Tracy comes to comfort Toby, and Jared leaves the party to head to the beach alone. Jared sees Toby having consensual sex with Tracy on the beach. He then witnesses three of his male friends interrupting the couple and raping Tracy. Tracy calls out for help, but Jared, who is visibly disturbed by what he is witnessing, does not intervene. Toby and the other three boys, who never noticed Jared was watching, flee the area. Jared also runs away and leaves Tracy alone and distressed. Later that night Rachel, who has sneaked out of home to attend the party, finds Tracy&#x27;s beaten corpse on the beach.

Jared initially tells the police nothing of what he saw. He is torn between the need to tell the truth and the desire to protect his friends. His anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared&#x27;s silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy&#x27;s murder. However, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko, who confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident. She hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still has not been able to tell Jared that she has cancer because of his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.

Jared tells the police that he was with Ricko. When he tries to suggest Tracy&#x27;s death may have been an accident, the police show him the photos of Tracy&#x27;s battered body. Jared aggressively confronts Ricko at the beach, and Ricko confesses that Tracy&#x27;s death was not an accident. He had found her walking on the beach after the rape, and she asked him to take her home. He agreed but wanted to have sex with her first. She tried to fight him off and bit him in the process, which enraged him enough to beat her to death.

As Ricko finishes his confession, the police arrive, and he realises that Jared has turned him in. He attempts to escape, but the police give chase and corner him on a cliff. Rather than go to jail and ignoring Jared&#x27;s screams of protest, he jumps to his death. In the weeks that follow, Jared&#x27;s life collapses. Despite learning of Diane&#x27;s illness, he moves out of her house and chooses instead to be homeless. Jared returns home one day to collect his belongings; after arguing with Diane, he confesses that he witnessed Tracy&#x27;s rape and could have saved her life if he had intervened or helped her afterwards. Later that day, Jared joins Diane and Cherie in cleaning graffiti from Tracy&#x27;s grave.

==Themes==
Writing in the journal &quot;Antipodes&quot;, academics Felicity Holland and Jane O&#x27;Sullivan credit the film with exploring the themes of Australian masculinity, mateship, violence and sexuality. The film&#x27;s portrayal of a rape and murder at a teenage party suggests that serious crime can arise from drinking and fun simply getting out of hand. The violence, they say, erupts from extreme larikkinism rather than the archetypal psychopathy seen in other films featuring violence towards women. The film&#x27;s critique of criminal masculinity undermines the status of previously celebrated masculine lawbreakers in Australian history and cinema, such as Ned Kelly and Mick Dundee. The authors believe that the focus on masculinity leaves the female victim largely out of the film; they consider the &quot;near erasure&quot; of Tracy to be a troubling aspect; the film instead focuses on portraying the males as victims of their class, masculinity and mateship.

Director Steven Vidler said the film was not about a rape, rather it was &quot;about the culture that allowed it to happen.&quot; Vidler defended the choice to give the rape victim a minor role, stating, &quot;It was important to show that this could have happened to anyone. We didn&#x27;t want to give away too much about the victim so we could maintain that suspense.&quot; Producer David Elfick said that the film was about contemporary Australia; about &quot;kids who have all their life to enjoy, then a deadly mixture of drugs, alcohol, sexual tension, and desire add up to a tragedy.&quot;

==Production==

===Theatrical origins===
Brian Joyce, the director of Newcastle&#x27;s Freewheels Theatre in Education, approached playwright Nick Enright, encouraging him to create a play that explored themes around the 1989 rape and murder of Leigh Leigh in Stockton, a beach area of Newcastle. Leigh&#x27;s family objected to the fictionalisation of her murder. Titled &quot;A Property of the Clan&quot;, the 45-minute play premiered at the Freewheels Theatre in 1992 and was performed at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1993. The play was shown at various high-schools in the Newcastle area and, following its positive reception, was shown nationally at high schools across the country over a period of eighteen months.

In 1994, the Sydney Theatre Company commissioned Enright to develop the play into a feature-length production. The resulting play was titled &quot;Blackrock&quot;. &quot;Blackrock&quot; retained the original four characters from &quot;A Property of the Clan&quot;, and added nine others; it was considered a more fictionalised version of Leigh&#x27;s murder. The narrative and emphasis were reshaped for an adult audience rather than for a specifically educational environment.

===Film adaptation===
While the revisions to the play &quot;Blackrock&quot; were still being finalised, Enright started working with first-time director Steven Vidler to direct a film version, which would also be titled &quot;Blackrock&quot;. By December 1995, Vidler was working with Enright as an unofficial script editor, although they were having trouble finding financing for the film. Vidler said he considered directing the film &quot;Blackrock&quot; after having watched and been moved by the theatrical version, saying the play was &quot;absolutely what it was like [for him] growing up in the Western Suburbs... It&#x27;s about keeping bonded with your mates. Nothing else matters... It&#x27;s about the unbelievable lengths boys will go to keep those bonds solid.&quot; Leigh&#x27;s mother Robyn campaigned to have production of the film halted, but her attempts failed after the film received government financial backing from the New South Wales Film and Television Office.

&quot;Blackrock&quot; was filmed over a period of two weeks with a cast and crew of about 70. A call for extras received an enthusiastic response by many teenagers in the Newcastle area. Filming locations included Stockton, Maroubra Beach, Caves Beach, and NESCA House. Notable Stockton landmarks seen in the film include the Stockton Ferry and Stockton Bridge. 

The community of Stockton opposed filming in the area, as memories of Leigh&#x27;s murder were still fresh and the details of the script were &quot;too close for comfort&quot;. When filmmakers arrived in Stockton in late August 1996, locations that had previously been reserved were suddenly no longer available. The local media treated them with hostility. Former Newcastle deputy mayor and Stockton resident Frank Rigby criticised the film during production, saying &quot;I would just love it to go away and so would everybody else.&quot; Brian Joyce was also critical of the decision to film in the area, saying the filmmakers had to acknowledge the choice they had made in doing so. The situation was exacerbated by the filmmakers&#x27; denial that the film was specifically about Leigh, despite their choice of Stockton for filming. During production in September 1996, Elfick told &quot;The Newcastle Herald&quot; that he was &quot;getting a bit bored&quot; of people mentioning Leigh&#x27;s murder. While acknowledging that the comments were understandable, Elfick concluded, &quot;Unfortunately, that event happens all over Australia. We wanted to take the events of that murder and many other murders&quot;. He was also quoted in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; as saying, &quot;The movie is bigger than the Leigh Leigh thing&quot;. Elfick hoped that people viewing the film would see it as a positive way of looking at the circumstances that led to Leigh&#x27;s death, and that it would make people think and maybe stop something like that happening to someone in the future. Leigh&#x27;s family were vehemently opposed to the film, saying that the filmmakers were &quot;feasting on an unfortunate situation&quot;, insensitively trivialising and exploiting her death, and portraying her negatively while doing so. One of Leigh&#x27;s aunts wrote to &quot;The Newcastle Herald&quot; later that month, saying &quot;David Elfick doesn&#x27;t seem to mind free publicity even if it comes from the tragic and brutal assault, rape, and murder of a fourteen-year-old virgin, not as he called it: &#x27;the Leigh Leigh thing which happens all over Australia.&#x27;&quot; Enright said that while Leigh&#x27;s murder served as the inspiration, the completed film is about the way a small town reacts when one of its own members murders another.

===Casting===
Sandy George from Australian Screen Online said that Vidler&#x27;s long career as an actor helped him &quot;draw the terrific performances&quot; from the film&#x27;s young actors. 17-year-old Laurence Breuls was literally the first person to audition for the role of Jared. Hundred of others auditioned though Breuls remained the favourite choice. Vidler chose Simon Lyndon, who played the role of Jared in the original stage production of &quot;Blackrock&quot;, for the role of Ricko, stating that Lyndon had the looks, charisma, and complexity to play the role. Rebecca Smart, who also portrayed Cherie in the original stage production, was the only person to reprise their role from the play. &quot;Blackrock&quot; is often considered to be Heath Ledger&#x27;s debut film, but he had an uncredited minor role in the 1991 TV film &quot;Clowning Around&quot;. While Ledger&#x27;s role in &quot;Blackrock&quot; is small, it is credited with garnering him attention in Australia, leading to more prominent acting roles. 15-year-old Bojana Novakovic was given the role of Tracy partly because she was a competitive gymnast and was considered mentally and physically strong enough to film the rape scene. Vidler discussed the role with her parents before filming commenced, who despite initial reservations, eventually gave permission for her to film the scene. Novakovic said the experience was traumatic and she began to tremble uncontrollably once the shoot ended, though recovered shortly afterwards, concluding, &quot;In a way, I feel lucky to have had such a role at the beginning of my career. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be scared by an emotional scene again.&quot; The boys involved in the scene showed up at her door the following day and gave her a bunch of flowers and a T-shirt that said &quot;shit happens&quot;. Vidler said he found the performance so powerful that when he first watched the rushes of the scene alone, he burst into tears.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack to the film was released on 28 April 1997 on Mercury Records Australia. Vidler said a lot of time was spent sifting through hundred of CDs &quot;trying to find stuff that was not only appropriate for the film but would also be appealing to the audiences and hopefully, you know, would be released around the same time as the film, which isn&#x27;t as easy as it sounds!&quot; Jonathan Lewis from &quot;AllMusic&quot; gave the album four and a half out of five stars, concluding that it was &quot;A fine collection of songs that, given the diversity of artists featured, is surprisingly cohesive as an album.&quot;

===Track listing===
==Release==
The film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival on 24 January 1997. It was also shown at the Boston Film Festival on 7 September 1997. The version of the film shown outside Australia was around 100 minutes long; upon reviewing this version the Australian Classification Board gave it an &#x27;R&#x27; rating, stating the rape scene was &quot;too harrowing and confronting&quot; for an MA15+ rating. Vidler subsequently cut about 10 minutes of footage out of the film so it could receive an MA15+ rating and reach its target audience of 15- to 18-year-olds. &quot;Blackrock&quot; opened in 77 cinemas in Australia on 1 May 1997 grossing $401,599 for the week, placing seventh at the Australian box office. It went on to gross $1,136,983 at the Australian box office.

===Reception===
In anticipation of the film&#x27;s debut at Sundance, John Brodie from &quot;Variety&quot; said the film could be the &quot;thunder from Down Under the way &quot;Shine&quot; was last year.&quot; Having watched the film at Sundance, David Rooney from &quot;Variety&quot; praised several of the actors&#x27; performances and said the film &quot;should score with kids the protagonists&#x27; age, but its soap-opera-style plotting and overwritten dialogue will limit wider acceptance&quot;. &quot;Premiere&quot; also gave a negative review of the film&#x27;s debut, commenting that audiences had been expecting to see another &quot;Shine&quot;, though left the screening disappointed. Elfick acknowledged that the initial screening of &quot;Blackrock&quot; at Sundance was less well received, which he blamed on sound problems. He stated that the issue was rectified for the second and third screenings, which were much more successful. Diane Carmen of &quot;The Denver Post&quot; gave the film a positive review of the film, which she said left audiences at Sundance &quot;reeling with its intensity&quot;, concluding it was &quot;almost guaranteed to find a distributor in the U.S&quot;, though in the event the film never received American distribution. Having viewed the film at the Boston Film Festival, Chris Wright from &quot;The Phoenix&quot; concluded, &quot;Even with its slightly over-the-top dénouement, &quot;Blackrock&quot; is a believable, touching teen drama. It&#x27;s also a gripping thriller&quot;.

R.S. Murthi from the Malaysian newspaper &quot;New Straits Times&quot; gave the film two out of five stars, concluding it is &quot;an unflattering but somewhat forced look at the wild side of teen life that at times seems dangerously tolerant of unrestrained teen behaviour.&quot; Associate professor Donna Lee Brien of Central Queensland University said that when shown outside Australia, the film lacks the &quot;poignant and powerful narrative support of Leigh&#x27;s tragedy&quot; and was deemed by critics to be &quot;shallow and clichéd&quot;.

Australian novelist and critic Robert Drewe gave a positive review, praising the performance of Breuls, the cinematography by Martin McGrath, and director Steven Vidler&#x27;s choice of such a controversial subject for a first film. Upon noting that the filmmakers deliberately insisted that their characters be portrayed as different from the actual people involved in the Leigh Leigh murder as possible, Drewe said the film is &quot;asking a lot of Australian audiences to expunge reality from their memories&quot;, though he concluded that the film should be &quot;compulsory viewing for all Australian teenagers.&quot; Rob Lowing from &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot; noted that the film belonged to a slew of Australasian films that focused on middle class life and ultimately gave the film 3½ stars out of 4, stating, &quot;if you went to see &quot;Romper Stomper&quot;, &quot;Metal Skin&quot;, &quot;Idiot Box&quot; or &quot;Once Were Warriors&quot;, this gritty, punchy social drama ably fits into that class.&quot;

In her book &quot;Who Killed Leigh Leigh?&quot;, Kerry Carrington, a criminologist and prominent researcher of Leigh&#x27;s murder, had both criticism and praise for the film. She praised it for dispelling &quot;the myth&quot; that sexual violence is confined to one social class, for illustrating how boys model their sexual conduct on their fathers&#x27; treatment of women, and how the culture of sex segregation in workplaces can carry over into the public life of a town, exacerbating sexist beliefs and behaviours. She criticised the film, however, for the &quot;strong impression&quot; it makes that ineffectual mothers are part of the underlying problem and for several differences between Leigh&#x27;s murder and the film that she considered to be disrespectful to Leigh&#x27;s memory, in particular the film&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood ending&quot;.

Donna Lee Brien stated that just as the filmmakers attempted to distance themselves from Leigh&#x27;s murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from &quot;Blackrock&quot;. A 1999 feature in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson&#x27;s 1977 debut film &quot;Summer City&quot; to a short film festival that year, but made no mention of &quot;Blackrock&quot;. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.

===Home media===
A region 1 DVD was released on 29 October 2002 containing the original version of the film. A region 4 DVD was released on 19 November 2003 containing the edited version. Special features included a four-minute featurette, cast and crew interviews, a &#x27;goof reel&#x27; which included footage of a bonding trip made by Simon Lyndon, Laurence Bruels and Cameron Nugent to Lennox Head, and the film&#x27;s original trailer and television advertisement. According to Andrew L. Urban from Urban Cinefile the featurette was &quot;overburdened&quot; with clips from the film, but was otherwise of interest. Urban also praised the seven-minute interview with Nick Enright.

==Historical accuracy==
None of the promotional material for the film mentioned Leigh and the film was not marketed as being &quot;based on a true story&quot;. The film&#x27;s credits state that it is a work of fiction and that resemblance to &quot;actual events or persons living or dead is entirely coincidental&quot;. Nevertheless, numerous comparisons between the film and Leigh&#x27;s murder were made. Just like the play it was based on, &quot;Blackrock&quot; was often incorrectly considered by viewers to be a factual account of Leigh&#x27;s murder. Conflation between the two subjects was high; the film was described by Miriam Davis on radio station &quot;FM 91.5&quot; as being the true story of &quot;the murder of Leigh Warner at Blackrock Beach near Newcastle.&quot; Donna Lee Brien stated that every review of both the film and the play it was based on at least mentioned Leigh, with some going into great detail on the subject. Kerry Carrington stated that the film was very accurate in some aspects of the murder, yet very distant in others, as if the film was &quot;having a bet each way&quot;.

Jared is an entirely fictional character, though he has been interpreted as a metaphor for everyone who witnessed Leigh being publicly assaulted yet did nothing. In the film, Tracy does not ask her parents for permission to attend the party as she knows this would be denied, whereas Leigh obtained permission from her parents, who were told the party would be supervised. Tracy wears a short skirt, tight-fitting top, and wedged-heels to the party, while Leigh wore ordinary shorts, a jumper, and sand-shoes. Tracy&#x27;s body is found that night by a girl; Leigh&#x27;s body was found the next day by a boy. Tracy&#x27;s mother packs up her daughter&#x27;s bedroom the following day, whereas Leigh&#x27;s mother left her room untouched for months. In the film, police labour until every boy involved in the rape and murder is punished, whereas no one was convicted for raping Leigh and police received criticism for alleged incompetence. Tracy&#x27;s murderer was 22 years old, well-toned, and committed suicide, while Leigh&#x27;s was 18 years old, , and was jailed.

Both murderers, however, were high-school dropouts who were interested in mechanics, were considered to have no emotional depth, and were prone to violence. The party in the film was considered to be &quot;an almost perfect re-creation&quot; of the party in Stockton; a surf club is hired for the night with teenage attendees being entertained by a high-school band. The party spills out into the surrounding area where there are fights, and teenagers are seen stumbling, vomiting and unconscious. Tracy&#x27;s funeral was also considered to be &quot;a direct re-staging&quot; of Leigh&#x27;s service; both Leigh and Tracy&#x27;s friends placed red roses on her coffin and then plant a tree in her memory. Both Leigh and Tracy&#x27;s mothers worked at a nursing home and both their fathers called for the death penalty for her murderer. Parents are blamed for neglecting their children in both cases.

Details that were considered to be undoubtedly taken from Leigh&#x27;s murder included the filming location of Stockton, the presence of the song &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; featured at Leigh&#x27;s funeral appearing in the original script (though it did not appear in the finished film), and posters reading &quot;Shame Blackrock Shame&quot; seen on telegraph poles following Tracy&#x27;s murder; posters appeared around Stockton following Leigh&#x27;s murder stating &quot;Shame Stockton Shame: Dob the gutless bastards in&quot;.

==Accolades==
&quot;Blackrock&quot; received five nominations at the 1997 AACTA Awards, though did not win any awards. It won both the &#x27;Feature Film – Adaptation&#x27; award and the Major Award at the 1997 AWGIE Awards.

<text>Jenny Bloxham (born 1949) is a former New Zealand politician.

==Career before politics==
Before entering Parliament Bloxham was an IHC community support worker and owned a masonry business together with her husband Rod.

==Political career==
Bloxham first became involved with politics in 1981 when she joined the Labour Party and from 1987 to 1990 she was a member of Labour&#x27;s national council. In 1993 she contested the Labour nomination for the electorate, but lost to Jim Sutton as she &quot;...knew there was no way the Timaru Labour Party would select me because of my gender for one thing.&quot; By then she was totally disillusioned with Labour particularly the Rogernomics economic reforms and immediately joined New Zealand First upon the party&#x27;s foundation.

At the 1993 general election she stood as the New Zealand First candidate in Timaru, finishing fourth. In 1994 she was elected vice-president of New Zealand First and party spokesperson for health.

===Member of Parliament===

She was an MP from 1996 to 1999, representing the New Zealand First party. She was first elected to Parliament in the 1996 election as a list MP, after standing in the electorate. When New Zealand First splintered in 1998, she was one of the MPs who remained with the party core.

At the 1999 election, however, she was ranked in 22nd place on the New Zealand First party list, a surprisingly low position for a sitting MP. She was not returned to Parliament.

<text>Thénardite is an anhydrous sodium sulfate mineral, Na2SO4 which occurs in arid evaporite environments, specifically lakes and playas. It also occurs in dry caves and old mine workings as an efflorescence and as a crusty sublimate deposit around fumaroles. It occurs in volcanic caves on Mount Etna, Italy. It was first described in 1825 for an occurrence in the Espartinas Saltworks in Ciempozuelos, Spain, by the Spanish chemist José Luis Casaseca (1800 - 1869). Casaseca named the mineral after his master, the French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard (1777–1857).

Thénardite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system and often forms yellowish, reddish to gray white prismatic crystals although usually in massive crust deposits. Thénardite is fluorescent, white in shortwave and yellow-green in longwave UV radiation. 

In humid conditions, thénardite progressively absorbs water and converts to the deca-hydrated mineral mirabilite, Na2SO4 · 10 H2O.

<text>The Tera Computer Company was a manufacturer of high-performance computing software and hardware, founded in 1987 in Washington, D.C., and moved 1988 to Seattle, Washington, by James Rottsolk and Burton Smith. The company&#x27;s first supercomputer product, named MTA, featured interleaved multi-threading, i.e. a barrel processor. It also had no data cache, relying instead on switching between threads for latency tolerance, and used a deeply pipelined memory system to handle many simultaneous requests, with address randomization to avoid memory hot spots.

The company was listed on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol &quot;TERA&quot;.

In 1997, Tera Computer went to San Jose, California-based Cadence Design Systems Inc to develop microprocessors for their use in CMOS technology. Unisys manufactured Tera&#x27;s gallium arsenide CPU.

Upon acquiring the Cray Research division of Silicon Graphics in 2000, the company was renamed to Cray Inc.

<text>Antimony trisulfide () is found in nature as the crystalline mineral stibnite and the amorphous red mineral (actually a mineraloid) metastibnite. It is manufactured for use in safety matches, military ammunition, explosives and fireworks. It also is used in the production of ruby-colored glass and in plastics as a flame retardant. Historically the stibnite form was used as a grey pigment in paintings produced in the 16th century. In 1817, the dye and fabric chemist, John Mercer discovered the non-stoichiometric compound Antimony Orange (approximate formula ), the first good orange pigment available for cotton fabric printing.

Antimony trisulfide was also used as the image sensitive photoconductor in vidicon camera tubes. It is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.8–2.5 eV. With suitable doping, p and n type materials can be produced.

== Preparation and reactions ==
 can be prepared from the elements at temperature 500–900 °C:

 is precipitated when  is passed through an acidified solution of Sb(III). This reaction has been used as a gravimetric method for determining antimony, bubbling through a solution of Sb(III) compound in hot HCl deposits an orange form of which turns black under the reaction conditions.

 is readily oxidised, reacting vigorously with oxidising agents. It burns in air with a blue flame. It reacts with incandescence with cadmium, magnesium and zinc chlorates. Mixtures of and chlorates may explode.

In the extraction of antimony from antimony ores the alkaline sulfide process is employed where reacts to form thioantimonate(III) salts (also called thioantimonite):

A number of salts containing different thioantimonate(III) ions can be prepared from . These include:

Schlippe&#x27;s salt, , a thioantimonate(V) salt is formed when is boiled with sulfur and sodium hydroxide. The reaction can be represented as:

==Structure==
The structure of the black needle-like form of , stibnite, consists of linked ribbons in which antimony atoms are in two different coordination environments, trigonal pyramidal and square pyramidal. Similar ribbons occur in and . The red form, metastibnite, is amorphous. Recent work suggests that there are a number of closely related temperature dependent structures of stibnite which have been termed stibnite (I) the high temperature form, identified previously, stibnite (II) and stibnite (III). Other paper shows that the actual coordination polyhedra of antimony are in fact , with (3+4) coordination at the M1 site and (5+2) at the M2 site. These coordinations consider the presence of secondary bonds. Some of the secondary bonds impart cohesion and are connected with packing.

<text>Sellaite is a magnesium fluoride mineral with the formula MgF2. It crystallizes in the tetragonal crystal system, typically as clear to white vitreous prisms. It may be fibrous and occur as radiating aggregates. It has a Mohs hardness of 5 to 6 and a specific gravity of 2.97 to 3.15. Refractive index values are &quot;nω&quot; = 1.378 and &quot;nε&quot; = 1.390.

==Discovery and occurrence==
Sellaite was first described in 1868 and named for Italian mining engineer and mineralogist Quintino Sella (1827–1884). Its type locality is the in France, where it occurred inside bitumen-bearing dolomite-anhydrite clasts within a moraine deposit. It has been reported in an evaporite deposit at Bleicherode; within volcanic ejecta and fumaroles at Vesuvius; in a metamorphic magnesite deposit at ; and in sodic alkali granite near .

<text>Toubkal (, ), also Jbel Toubkal or Jebel Toubkal, is a mountain in southwestern Morocco, located in the Toubkal National Park. At , it is the highest peak in Morocco, the Atlas Mountains, North Africa and the Arab world. Located south of the city of Marrakesh, and visible from it, Toubkal is an ultra prominent peak, the highest for over . Toubkal is ranked 27th by topographic isolation.

==Geography==
Although much of the High Atlas consists of sedimentary rocks, the Toubkal massif is an area of volcanic rocks which have weathered into alpine crests, cut by deep, narrow valleys. To the south, the mountain drops steeply down for to a small lake called Lac d&#x27;Ifni. To the west, the mountain&#x27;s edge is marked by a pass, the Tizi n&#x27;Ouanoums at . From this pass, the mountain&#x27;s W-S-W ridge rises up to Toubkal West, which forms a shoulder at before continuing to the summit at .

The north and western sides of Toubkal drain down to the Mizane Valley, which has the passes of both Tizi n&#x27;Ouanoums and Tizi n&#x27;Ouagane at its head. Two hanging valleys on the western side of the mountain - the Ikhibi Nord and Ikhibi South provide ready access for trekkers and climbers to reach Toubkal&#x27;s summit. At one time the northern valley provided the normal route of ascent, but the construction of a mountain hut by the French Alpine Club below Ikhibi Sud now encourages trekkers to ascend via the southern route instead.

==Access==
Toubkal is popular with trekkers and ski mountaineers, but less so with climbers, despite its ease of access and sunny climate. Trekkers usually approach the mountain from Marrakesh via the road-end village of Imlil. Qualified guides can be hired, as well as porters, to carry equipment and food supplies higher into the mountains. It is a moderate hike and navigation is not a problem.

The normal route starts with a walk to the village of Aroumd. Beyond Aroumd, a floodplain is crossed and the route follows the left slope of the valley southwards. The valley bends to the east to the tiny settlement of Sidi Chamharouch, which has grown around a Muslim shrine. At Sidi Chamharouch, the path leads over the stream and runs steeply uphill to the right side of the Isougouane valley, which leads to two stone-built refuges (Refuge du Toubkal and Refuge Les Mouflons) that are often used as base camp at .

==Routes==
The first recorded ascent was on 12 June 1923 by the Marquis de Segonzac, Vincent Berger and Hubert Dolbeau, but the mountain may well have been climbed before that date. Toubkal&#x27;s height was measured the following year, and determined as being Nowadays measured at 4,167 metres, the summit is crowned with a large pyramidal metal trigonometric marker, and offers views taking in most of the Atlas and Little Atlas Mountains.
It is possible to climb mountain Toubkal in two days - first day up to the refuge (around seven hours), second day to the summit (around four hours ascent, three hours descent) and back to Imlil (up to five hours).

In summer the mountains can be very dry, but are sometimes subject to storms. Although the temperature should remain above zero during the day, freezing conditions are possible over 3,500m. In winter the mountains are covered in snow and ice, and can be prone to avalanches. Skiing is possible as the snow can lie to considerable depth and cover many rocky slopes. Information about the state of the route can be obtained at Marrakesh tourist offices or at Imlil.

1) Ikhibi Sud (normal route). From the Toubkal refuge, a path crosses the stream, climbs a steep scree slope to the east and enters a hanging valley, then climbs another steep slope to reach a col (Tizi&#x27;n&#x27;Toubkal at 3,940m). At the col the route turns left (northwards) up easy slopes to the narrow summit crest of Jebel Toubkal.

The ascent during the summer (from May) is non-technical yet moderately difficult, complicated only by steep and slippery scree slopes and altitude sickness. Sturdy boots and proper (windproof) clothing are required, and trekking poles are helpful on the scree. An ice-axe may be needed on the remaining snowfields in the early summer. The ascent during the end of the winter and spring (February/March) is more difficult; crampons are necessary to ascend through the snow and - in some cases - ice. Ascent: ; 2.5 –3 hours.

2) Ikhibi Nord Not as frequently ascended as Ikhibi Sud, but technically easier. The route starts some distance down the valley from the Toubkal refuge, and turns right (eastwards) to follow a track up through a hanging valley to a col on the north side of Toubkal. Ascent:; 3–4 hours. The col also gives access to adjacent peaks of Imouzzer and Tibherine 

3) West-North-West Ridge (ONO Arete). (First ascent by J de Lepinay and party, 1936). Infrequently climbed, but a long and pleasant traverse containing many gaps and towers. Some difficulties can be avoided by means of an abseil. Grade III/IV; 7 hours.

== Other ==
On 17 December 2018, two trekkers, from Denmark and Norway, were murdered close to the foot of the trail in a terror-related attack.

<text>George Derek Fleetwood Bell, MBE (21 October 1935 – 17 October 2002) was a Northern Irish harpist, pianist, oboist, musicologist and composer who was best known for his accompaniment work on various instruments with The Chieftains.

==As classical composer and virtuoso==
Bell was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Because he had been misdiagnosed at an early age as having a disease that would lead to blindness, his parents gave him a musical upbringing. He was something of a child prodigy, composing his first concerto at the age of 12. He graduated from the Royal College of Music in 1957. While studying there, he became friends with the flute player James Galway. From 1958 to 1990 he composed several classical works, including three piano sonatas, two symphonies, &quot;Three Images of Ireland in Druid Times&quot; (in 1993) for harp, strings and timpani, &quot;Nocturne on an Icelandic Melody&quot; (1997) for oboe d&#x27;amore and piano and &quot;Three Transcendental Concert Studies&quot; (2000) for oboe and piano. He had mastered and held a notable collection of instruments, including various harps, harpsichord, piano, cymbalom, and all the members of the oboe family of instruments (musette, oboe, cor anglais, bass oboe) and the heckelphone

As manager of the Belfast Symphony Orchestra, Bell was responsible for maintaining the instruments and keeping them in tune. Out of curiosity, he asked Sheila Larchet-Cuthbert to teach him how to play the harp. Over time he had many other harp teachers including Gwendolen Mason. In 1965 he became an oboist and harpist with the BBC Northern Ireland Orchestra. He had been known to be able to skilfully play the pedal harp, neo-Celtic harp, and wire-strung Irish-Bardic harp. Bell served as a professor of harp at the Academy of Music in Belfast.

Bell was briefly featured in a 1986 BBC documentary, &quot;The Celts&quot;, in which he discussed the role and evolution of the harp in Celtic Irish and Welsh society. Derek Bell also appeared with Van Morrison at the Riverside Theatre at the University of Ulster in April 1988. An hour-long BBC special was broadcast in which Derek Bell talks extensively as well as accompanying Morrison on several songs including &quot;On Raglan Road&quot;. The video is available on YouTube in full &quot;VAN MORRISON - In Conversation and Music 1988&quot;. Apart from this, video of him only exists in minor interviews and performances with The Chieftains.

==As dulcimer player==
The hammered dulcimer is documented as having been played in Ireland in the 18th century and is mentioned by James Joyce as an instrument he heard being played in the street. Bell introduced a small cimbalom (a hammered dulcimer from central and eastern Europe), which he called &quot;tiompan&quot; after the medieval Irish instrument.

Bell was an admirer of the music of Nikolai Karlovich Medtner and was the co-founder, with the bass-baritone Hugh Sheehan, of the first British Medtner Society which gave a series of successful concerts of Medtner&#x27;s music in the 1970s long before Medtner&#x27;s music was recognised as it is today.

==The Chieftains==
On St Patrick&#x27;s Day in 1972 Bell performed on the radio the music of Turlough O&#x27;Carolan, an 18th-century blind Irish harpist. Working with Bell on the project were several members of The Chieftains. Bell became friends with the leader of the Chieftains, Paddy Moloney. For two precarious years, he recorded both with the BBC Northern Ireland Orchestra and with The Chieftains, until finally becoming a full-time member of the Chieftains in 1975.

==Eccentricity==
Bell was the only member of the band to wear a tie at every public performance. He favoured socks with novelty designs, such as images of Looney Tunes characters. He wore scruffy suits, often with trousers that were too short. He was eccentric and told obscene jokes. The title of his 1981 solo album &quot;Derek Bell Plays With Himself&quot; has a conscious double-entendre. While touring in Moscow he grabbed his alarm clock and put it in his pocket while rushing to catch a plane. He was then stopped by the Soviet police on suspicion of carrying a concealed weapon. Paddy Moloney affectionately called him &quot;Ding Dong&quot; Bell. He relished the eclectic collaborations, such as those with Van Morrison, Sting and the Chinese orchestra. In 1991 he recorded with his old friend James Galway. He was awarded an MBE in the 2000 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for services to traditional music.

==Eastern religions==
From the early 1960s, Bell was a friend of Swami Kriyananda, also known as J. Donald Walters (also an avid composer of music for the Irish harp). Bell and some associates visited Kriyananda at his spiritual centre in Ananda village in Nevada City, California. Bell wrote a preface to an edition of Kriyananda&#x27;s book &quot;Art As a Hidden Message&quot;. He writes, &quot;After reading it, I decided to get in touch with him... I also visited Ananda several times, the beautiful village Kriyananda himself founded in 1968... I offered to record some of Kriyananda&#x27;s music.&quot; His first album, &quot;Mystic Harp&quot;, with Kriyananda was positively reviewed by the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;This is a lovely, light album full of charm and innocence [...] The Mystic Harp will take you to places that stretch from the innocence of childhood to the mystery and otherworldliness of the spiritual.&quot; His final album was also with Kriyananda, &quot;Mystic Harp vol II&quot;, a collection of compositions in a new age style for solo harp quite different from the traditional and classical compositions for which he was otherwise known. In August 2002, only weeks before his death, Bell visited Kriyananda. Although he was raised as a Protestant, he became a Buddhist later in life.

==Death==
Bell died of cardiac arrest in Phoenix, Arizona on 17 October 2002, just four days shy of his 67th birthday. He is remembered at Cambridge House Grammar School, Ballymena, as House Patron of Bell House.

<doc id="1114113" wikidata="Q273639" url="?curid=1114113" title="Basmala">
<text>The (, ; also known by its opening words ; , &quot;In the name of God&quot;), or Tasmiyyah (), is the titular name of the Islamic phrase &quot;In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful&quot; (, ). It is one of the most important phrases in Islam and frequently recited by Muslims before performing daily activities and religious practices, including prayer.

It is used in over half of the constitutions of countries where Islam is the state religion or more than half of the population follows Islam, usually the first phrase in the preamble, including those of Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brunei, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates.

In the Qur&#x27;an, it is recited before each chapter (&quot;surah&quot;), except for the ninth chapter At-Tawbah. Scholarl debates regarding its inclusion in the Qur&#x27;anic text reached consensus with the 1924 Cairo Edition, where it was included as the first verse (&quot;āyah&quot;) of &quot;Al-Fatiha&quot; and remained an unnumbered line preceding each of the 112 other chapters.

Historically, the Islamic &quot;Basmala&quot; appears to be related to earlier variants of the phrase appearing in Arabian inscriptions dating back to the 5th and 6th centuries.

== Name ==
The traditional name for the phrase in Classical Arabic was Tasmiyah. Other common phrases in Islam were also given their own names based on verb form 2 verbal nouns, including Tasbih.
The word &quot;basmala&quot; was derived from a slightly unusual procedure, in which the first four pronounced consonants of the phrase &quot;bismi-llāhi...&quot; were used to create a new quadriliteral root: b-s-m-l (). This quadriliteral root was used to derive the noun &quot;basmala&quot; and its related verb forms, meaning &quot;to recite the &quot;basmala&quot;&quot;. The method of coining a quadriliteral name from the consonants of multiple words in a phrase is also used to create the name &#x27;&quot;Hamdala&quot; for &quot;Alhamdulillah&quot;, instead of the traditional name of &quot;Tahmid&quot;. The same procedure is also used to create the term Hawqala.

== Use and significance ==
According to Lane, &#x27; has the more intensive meaning, taken to include as objects of &quot;sympathy&quot; both the believer and the unbeliever, and may therefore be rendered as &quot;the Compassionate&quot;; &#x27;, on the other hand, is taken to include as objects the believer in particular, may be rendered as &quot;the Merciful&quot; (considered as expressive of a constant attribute).

In the Qur&#x27;an, the &quot;Basmala&quot;, is usually numbered as the first verse of the first &quot;sura&quot;, but, according to the view adopted by Al-Tabari, it precedes the first verse. Apart from the ninth &quot;sura&quot; (&quot;At-Tawba&quot;), Al-Qurtubi reported that the correct view is that the Basmala ignored at the beginning of At-Tawba because Gabriel did not refer to the &quot;Basmala&quot; in this &quot;surah&quot;, another view, says that Muhammad died before giving a clarification if &quot;At-Tawba&quot; is part of Quran 8 (&quot;al-ʾanfāl&quot;) or not. It occurs at the beginning of each subsequent &quot;sura&quot; of the Qur&#x27;an and is usually not numbered as a verse except at its first appearance at the start of the first &quot;sura&quot;. The &quot;Basmala&quot; occurs as part of a &quot;sura&quot;&#x27;s text in verse 30 of the 27th &quot;sura&quot; (&quot;An-Naml&quot;), where it prefaces a letter from Sulayman to Bilqis, the Queen of Sheba.

The &quot;Basmala&quot; is used extensively in everyday Muslim life, said as the opening of each action in order to receive blessing from God. Reciting the &quot;Basmala&quot; is a necessary requirement in the preparation of halal food.

In the Indian subcontinent, a Bismillah ceremony is held for a child&#x27;s initiation into Islam.

The three definite nouns of the Basmala—&quot;Allah&quot;, &quot;ar-Rahman&quot; and &quot;ar-Rahim&quot;—correspond to the first three of the traditional 99 names of God in Islam. Both &quot;ar-Rahman&quot; and &quot;ar-Rahim&quot; are from the same triliteral root R-Ḥ-M, &quot;to feel sympathy, or pity&quot;.

Around 1980, IRIB used it before starting their newscasts.

=== Hadith ===
There are several ahadith encouraging Muslims to recite it before eating and drinking. For example:

Jabir reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (saw) saying, &quot;If a person mentions the Name of Allah upon entering his house or eating, Satan says, addressing his followers: &#x27;You will find nowhere to spend the night and no dinner.&#x27; But if he enters without mentioning the Name of Allah, Satan says (to his followers); &#x27;You have found (a place) to spend the night in,&#x27; and if he does not mention the Name of Allah at the time of eating, Satan says: &#x27;You have found (a place) to spend the night in as well as food.&#x27;&quot;
:— From Muslim

Aisha reported: &quot;The Prophet said, &quot;When any of you wants to eat, he should mention the Name of God in the beginning (Bismillah). If he forgets to do it in the beginning, he should say &quot;Bismillah awwalahu wa akhirahu&quot; (I begin with the Name of God at the beginning and at the end)&quot;.
:— From At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud

Umaiyyah bin Makshi reported: &quot;The Prophet was sitting while a man was eating food. That man did not mention the Name of God till only a morsel of food was left. When he raised it to his mouth, he said, &quot;Bismillah awwalahu wa akhirahu&quot;. The Prophet smiled at this and said, &quot;Satan had been eating with him but when he mentioned the Name of God, Satan vomited all that was in his stomach&quot;.
:— From Abu Dawud and Al-Nasa&#x27;i

Wahshi bin Harb reported: &quot;Some of the Sahaba of the Prophet said, &#x27;We eat but are not satisfied.&#x27; He said, &#x27;Perhaps you eat separately.&#x27; The Sahaba replied in the affirmative. He then said, &#x27;Eat together and mention the Name of God over your food. It will be blessed for you.&#x27;
:— From Abu Dawood

A tradition ascribed to Muhammad states:

All that is contained in the revealed books is to be found in the Qur’an and all that is contained in the Qur’an is summed up in the surat al-fatihah (&quot;The opening one&quot;) while this is in its turn contained in the formula Bismillahi-r-Rahmani-r-Rahim (&quot;In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful&quot;).

A tradition ascribed to Imam Ali states:

The basmalah is in essence contained in the first letter, Ba, and this again in its diacritical point, which thus symbolizes principal Unity.

=== Tafsir ===
In a commentary on the Basmala in his Tafsir al-Tabari, al-Tabari writes:
:&quot;The Messenger of Allah (the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Jesus was handed by his mother Mary over to a school in order that he might be taught. [The teacher] said to him: &#x27;Write &quot;Bism (In the name of)&quot;.&#x27; And Jesus said to him: &#x27;What is &quot;Bism&quot;?&#x27; The teacher said: &#x27;I do not know.&#x27; Jesus said: &#x27;The &quot;Ba&quot; is Baha’u&#x27;llah (the glory of Allah), the &quot;Sin&quot; is His Sana’ (radiance), and the &quot;Mim&quot; is His Mamlakah (sovereignty).&quot;

== Numerology ==
=== Gematria ===
According to the standard Abjadi system of numerology, the total value of the letters of the Islamic Basmala, i.e. the phrase — is 786. This number has therefore acquired a significance in folk Islam and Near Eastern folk magic and also appears in many instances of pop-culture, such as its appearance in the 2006 song &#x27;786 All is War&#x27; by the band Fun-Da-Mental. A recommendation of reciting the basmala 786 times in sequence is recorded in Al-Buni. Sündermann (2006) reports that a contemporary &quot;spiritual healer&quot; from Syria recommends the recitation of the basmala 786 times over a cup of water, which is then to be ingested as medicine. 786 as a number, however, does not appear in Quran or Hadith.

It has also become common to abbreviate the phrase by typing &quot;786&quot;, especially in online communication, and especially among South Asian Muslims. License plates, phone numbers, and serial numbers on currency containing 786 have garnered a particularly high price in South Asia and Dubai. Businesses in Myanmar have displayed 786 to indicate that they are owned by Muslims.

<text>Les Andelys (; Norman: &quot;Les Aundelys&quot;) is a commune in the northern French department of Eure, in Normandy.

==Geography==
It lies on the Seine, about northeast of Évreux.

The commune is divided into two parts, Grand-Andely (located about from the Seine) and Petit-Andely (situated on the right bank of the Seine).
==History==
Grand Andely, founded, according to tradition, in the 6th century, has a church (13th, 14th and 15th centuries) parts of which are of fine late Gothic and Renaissance architecture. The works of art in the interior include stained glass of the latter period. Other interesting buildings are the hôtel du Grand Cerf dating from the first half of the 16th century, and the chapel of Sainte-Clotilde, close by a spring which, owing to its supposed healing powers, is the object of a pilgrimage. Grand Andely has a statue of Nicolas Poussin, a native of the place. Petit Andely sprang up at the foot of the eminence on which stands the Château Gaillard, now in ruins, but formerly one of the strongest fortresses in France. It was built by Richard I of England at the end of the 12th century to protect the Norman frontier, was captured by the French in 1204 and passed finally into their possession in 1449. The church of St Sauveur at Petit Andely also dates from the end of the 12th century.

<text>Otira is a small township fifteen kilometres north of Arthur&#x27;s Pass in the central South Island of New Zealand. It is on the northern approach to the pass, a saddle between the Ōtira and Bealey Rivers high in the Southern Alps. A possible meaning of is &quot;o&quot; (place of) and &quot;tira&quot; (the travellers). Another possible meaning is &quot;Oti&quot; (finished) and &quot;ra&quot; (Sun), because Otira Gorge is usually in deep shadow.
==History==
Otira was originally a stop on the Cobb and Co stagecoach from Canterbury to the West Coast. The Midland Line was extended from Stillwater to Jacksons in 1894 and then Otira in 1899, when the pass was navigated by coach from Otira until the railway tunnel opened in 1923. During the construction of the tunnel, Otira housed about 600 workers and their families.

The Otira Railway Station was opened on 13 November 1900 (ex-Goat Creek on 15 October 1900), and closed in February 1992.

In the 1950s the town had a population of about 350, but this had dropped to 11 in 1988.

While a small number of railway houses existed at the time the Otira Tunnel was being built, the vast majority were built in 1922 and 1923 as part of the Railways Department&#x27;s Housing Scheme. They were needed to house staff required for the greatly-upscaled railway operation following the completion of the tunnel. Love Brothers from Port Chalmers had the contract to build 43 houses in the new village. A further house was built in 1951 at the bottom end of the village road. This survives today, along with 16 others from the former railway village.

The New Zealand Railways Corporation sold the village houses to Glenstone Holdings around the end of 1990, with a peppercorn lease on the land. In 1998 the remaining 18 ex-railway houses (one has since burnt down) were sold to Chris and Bill Hennah, along with the large two-storeyed hotel, community hall and fire station. The 20-odd hectares of leased land included the school grounds. The Hennahs bought the old school building itself, and nearby indoors swimming pool in 2002.

Love Brothers also built the railway hostel for refreshment rooms staff, along with the refreshment rooms which were situated at the north end of the railway station. The &#x27;Refresh&#x27;, as it was known, closed in November 1987 with the commencement of the TranzAlpine service between Christchurch and Greymouth.

Having paid $73,000 in 1998, the Hennahs put the village on the market in 2010 with an asking price of NZ$1.5 million. No bids were received but it remained on the market. When advertised again in 2013 the sale price had dropped to NZ$1 million, and it sold the following year to Lester Rowntree for an undisclosed sum, although as at 2020 the Hennahs still own the ex-school building and swimming pool.

Not far from the hotel (originally opened in 1902 but rebuilt following a fire in 1911) is the former post office which was built in 1952 to replace an earlier one. This has been refurbished into an art gallery known as the &#x27;John Burns Gallery of Modern Art&#x27;. The complex exhibits art which is a surprise to many visitors, housed as it is in the middle of the Southern Alps. The former postmaster&#x27;s house also survives.

Heading up the valley, there are a number of houses dotted along the highway. Rata Lodge Backpackers is situated near Goat Creek and provides alternative accommodation to the Otira Stagecoach Hotel.

When the tunnel opened in 1923, traction power for the Otira to Arthur&#x27;s Pass electrified section was provided by a steam-driven generating station known as the &#x27;Power House&#x27; — a large imposing building which included a big shed and repair workshop for the electric locomotives.

The steam generating plant closed in July 1941, with the source of power then coming from the newly-constructed transmission line from Lake Coleridge to the West Coast. This involved building a transformer substation at Otira, along with a rectifier substation at the tunnel mouth. Staffing required at the Otira substation meant four houses were built, two of which still survive. The old power house has been demolished.

Close to the town are two major feats of civil engineering: the Otira Tunnel, and the Otira Viaduct.

==Otira Viaduct==
The Otira Viaduct is to the south of Otira, between Otira and the Arthur&#x27;s Pass summit. Completed in 1999 by McConnell Smith Pty Ltd, the four-span viaduct carries State Highway 73 over a stretch of unstable land, replacing a narrow, winding, dangerous section of road that was prone to avalanches, slips and closures. One person, Tony Western, 25, was killed during construction in July 1998 when a chain failed and a pump fell on him. A plaque was installed in his memory in the base of the westernmost pier.
==Demographics==
Hokitika Valley-Otira statistical area covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Cienfuegos moved to Mexico to play for Atlético Morelia in the 1991, and then signed with Santos in 1992.

In the summer of 1993, he had trials with Swiss champions Servette and La Liga side Lleida. Cienfuegos was close to signing with the Spanish side, but ultimately he was not offered a contract, and he returned to Mexico with a brief stint at Tampico Madero during the second half of the 1994-95 season.

===Los Angeles Galaxy===
Cienfuegos played two more seasons with Luis Ángel Firpo before joining Major League Soccer for its inaugural 1996 season. Cienfuegos played for Los Angeles Galaxy for eight years as a midfielder, from 1996 until his retirement after the 2003 season. During those years, he established himself, along with Carlos Valderrama, Marco Etcheverry, and Peter Nowak, as one of the best playmakers in the league. He was elected to the MLS Best XI three times, in 1996, 1998, and 1999, and played in seven MLS All-Star Games as a central midfielder. During his MLS career, Galaxy won the 2000 CONCACAF Champions Cup, the 2001 U.S. Open Cup, and the 2002 MLS Cup. He finished his MLS career with 78 assists and 35 goals in 206 games for the club.

==Coaching career==
Cienfuegos was appointed head coach of Nejapa in El Salvador&#x27;s Primera División de Fútbol Profesional in 2008. Despite having a good first season, a poor start to his second season in charge and non-payment of his players led to him to resign as head coach of the team. On 22 June 2011, it was announced that Mauricio Cienfuegos had been appointed as a technical coach for the LA Galaxy Academy. In January 2023, Cienfuegos was appointed to become assistant coach for the El Salvador national team.

<text>Tutekawa &quot;Tu&quot; Wyllie (born 24 October 1954) is a former New Zealand politician and rugby union player. A first five-eighth, Wyllie represented Wellington at a provincial level, and played one match for the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, in 1980. He was the New Zealand First Member of Parliament for Te Tai Tonga from 1996 to 1999.

==Early life==
Born in Manutuke, Wyllie affiliates to the Ngāi Tāmanuhiri, Ngāti Ruapani and Rongowhakaata iwi. He was educated at Gisborne Boys&#x27; High School where he played rugby for the 1st XV. He then went to Victoria University of Wellington, where he studied law. He worked as a bus driver, court clerk, teacher trainee and as a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Education, Iwi Transition Agency and the Department of Health.

==Rugby career==
While at Victoria, Wyllie played rugby league for New Zealand Universities between 1975 and 1977. He then played representative rugby union for Wellington from 1978 to 1983 and New Zealand Māori from 1979 to 1982. In the off-seasons he played overseas, in Ireland, the United States, Germany and France. His sole appearance for the All Blacks came in 1980, when he played against the touring Fijian side, scoring a try. The game was not recognised as a full international.

==Member of Parliament==

Wyllie represented Te Tai Tonga as a member of Parliament from 1996 to 1999 for the New Zealand First Party.

He defeated 29-year parliamentary veteran Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan with a majority of 285 votes enabling New Zealand First to capture all five Māori electorates in the 1996 election (including Te Tai Tonga). When the Tight five led by Tau Henare splintered from New Zealand First and created the Mauri Pacific party, Wyllie chose to remain loyal to the party core. During the 1999 election he sought re-election as MP for Te Tai Tonga, but chose not to stand on the party list. He was defeated by Mahara Okeroa of the Labour Party by 4522 votes.

During his term in Parliament, Wyllie also played for the parliamentary rugby team.

==Post Parliamentary career==
===Protest against the sale of Young Nicks head===
Following his defeat in the 1999 election Wyllie returned to Gisborne in an effort to assist Ngai Tamanuhiri to prevent the sale of Young Nick&#x27;s Head (Te Kuri), a place of historical, and spiritual significance to local Māori. Wyllie stated that &quot;It is the absolute jewel in the crown because Young Nick’s Head, or Te Kuri as we know it, is our equivalent to Hikurangi for Ngati Porou and Aorangi or Aoraki for Ngāi Tahu. It is our mountain, it is what identifies us as an iwi and we have some real issues about what’s going to happen to it in the future.&quot;. Ngai Tamanuhri tribal members led by Wyllie conducted a protest march and pitched their tents on the grounds of New Zealand Parliament.

He later lost his mandate as iwi spokesperson after he filed a judicial application to overturn Michael Cullen&#x27;s decision to approve the sale of the landmark. Young Nicks Head was consequently sold to American millionaire John Griffin.

<text>Salpausselkä (; &quot;Bar Ridge&quot;) is an extensive ridge system left by the ice age in Southern Finland. It is a large terminal moraine formation that formed in front of the Baltic ice lake during the Younger Dryas period about 12,250–10,400 years ago. All together the formation is close to from end to end, and the ridges can be as tall as in some places.

It runs from Hanko hundreds of kilometers to the east. It traps the extensive river and lake systems of Central Finland known as Finnish Lakeland (, &quot;Lake Finland&quot;) and forces the water to flow through few breaches in the ridge. The Vuoksi River flows from lake Saimaa into Lake Ladoga () in Russia. From there the water subsequently flows through river Neva into the Gulf of Finland, bypassing the Salpausselkä. The Kymi River flows from Päijänne into the Gulf of Finland. An artificial breach from the Lakeland is the Saimaa Canal, from Saimaa at Lappeenranta into the Gulf of Finland at Vyborg.

Salpausselkä has been used for transportation because of the easy terrain for centuries; later on both railways and highways have been built to follow it. It is also an important source of clean groundwater filtering from the lakes on the upper side (north) of the ridge, for the communities built alongside the ridge. The south side of the Salpausselkä has been inhabited for more than 10,000 years.

There are also formations called &quot;Second and Third Salpausselkä&quot;, which are similar in form but smaller. They are situated north of the main Salpausselkä, and were formed later respectively.

<doc id="1114154" wikidata="Q1090492" url="?curid=1114154" title="Château Gaillard">
<text>Château Gaillard () is a medieval castle ruin overlooking the River Seine above the commune of Les Andelys, in the French department of Eure, in Normandy. It is located some north-west of Paris and from Rouen. Construction began in 1196 under the auspices of Richard the Lionheart, who was simultaneously King of England and feudal Duke of Normandy. The castle was expensive to build, but the majority of the work was done in an unusually short period of time. It took just two years and, at the same time, the town of Petit Andely was constructed. Château Gaillard has a complex and advanced design, and uses early principles of concentric fortification; it was also one of the earliest European castles to use machicolations. The castle consists of three enclosures separated by dry moats, with a keep in the inner enclosure.

Château Gaillard was captured in 1204 by the king of France, Philip II, after a lengthy siege. In the mid-14th century, the castle was the residence of the exiled David II of Scotland. The castle changed hands several times in the Hundred Years&#x27; War, but in 1449 the French king captured Château Gaillard from the English king definitively, and from then on it remained in French ownership. Henry IV of France ordered the demolition of Château Gaillard in 1599; although it was in ruins at the time, it was felt to be a threat to the security of the local population. The castle ruins are listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture. The inner bailey is open to the public from March to November, and the outer baileys are open all year.

==History==

===Background===
Richard the Lionheart inherited Normandy from his father, Henry II, in 1189 when he ascended the throne of England. There was a rivalry between the Capetians and the Plantagenets, Richard as the Plantagenet king of England was more powerful than the Capetian king of France, despite the fact that Richard was a vassal of the French king and paid homage for his lands in the country. From 1190 to 1192, Richard the Lionheart was on the Third Crusade. He was joined by Philip II of France as each was wary that the other might invade his territory in his absence. Richard was captured and imprisoned on the return journey to England, and he was not released until 4 February 1194. In Richard&#x27;s absence, his brother John revolted with the aid of Philip; amongst Philip&#x27;s conquests in the period of Richard&#x27;s imprisonment was the Norman Vexin and a few towns around such as Le Vaudreuil, Verneuil and Évreux. It took Richard until 1198 to reconquer a part of it.

===Construction===
Perched high above the River Seine, an important transport route, the site of Château Gaillard, in the manor of Andeli, was identified as a naturally defensible position. In the valley below the site was the town of Grand Andely. Under the terms of the Treaty of Louviers (January 1196) between Richard and Philip II neither king was allowed to fortify the site; despite this, Richard intended to build a castle at &quot;Andeli&quot;. Its purpose was to protect the duchy of Normandy from Philip II—it helped fill a gap in the Norman defences left by the fall of Château de Gisors and above all Château de Gaillon, a castle which belonged to Philip and used as an advanced French fortification to block the Seine valley—and to act as a base from which Richard could launch his campaign to take back the Norman Vexin from French control. Indeed, Les Andelys is located just in front of Gaillon on the other side of the Seine valley. Richard tried to obtain the manor through negotiation. Walter de Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen, was reluctant to sell the manor as it was one of the diocese&#x27;s most profitable, and other lands belonging to the diocese had recently been damaged by war. When Philip besieged Aumale in northern Normandy, on the border with Picardy, Richard grew tired of waiting and seized the manor, although the act was opposed by the Church.
In an attempt to get Pope Celestine III to intercede, Walter de Coutances left for Rome in November 1196. Richard sent a delegation to represent him in Rome. One of the parties, Richard&#x27;s Lord Chancellor William Longchamp (who was also Bishop of Ely), died during the journey, although the rest, including Philip of Poitou, Bishop of Durham, and Guillaume de Ruffière, Bishop of Lisieux, arrived in Rome. Walter de Coutances meanwhile issued an interdict against the duchy of Normandy which prohibited church services from being performed in the region. Roger of Howden detailed &quot;the unburied bodies of the dead lying in the streets and square of the cities of Normandy&quot;. Construction began with the interdict hanging over Normandy, but it was later repealed in April 1197 by Celestine, after Richard made gifts of land to Walter de Coutances and the diocese of Rouen, including two manors and the prosperous port of Dieppe. The site of Château Gaillard had not been fortified before, and the town of Petit Andely was constructed at the same time; together with the historical Grand Andely, the two are known as Les Andelys. The castle sits on a high limestone promontory, 90 m above Les Andelys and overlooking a bend in the River Seine. The castle was connected with Les Andelys through a series of contemporary outworks.

During King Richard&#x27;s reign, the Crown&#x27;s expenditure on castles declined from the levels spent by Henry II, Richard&#x27;s father, although this has been attributed to a concentration of resources on Richard&#x27;s war with the king of France. However, the work at Château Gaillard cost an estimated £12,000 between 1196 and 1198. Richard only spent an estimated £7,000 on castles in England during his reign, similar as his father Henry II. The Pipe rolls for the construction of Château Gaillard contain the earliest details of how work was organised in castle building and what activities were involved. Amongst those workmen mentioned in the rolls are miners, stone cutters, quarrymen, masons, lime workers, carpenters, smiths, hodmen, water carriers, soldiers to guard the workers, diggers who cut the ditch surrounding the castle, and carters who transported the raw materials to the castle. A master mason is omitted, and military historian Allen Brown has suggested that it may be because Richard himself was the overall architect; this is supported by the interest Richard showed in the work through his frequent presence.
Not only was the castle built at considerable expense, but it was built relatively rapidly; construction of large stone castles often took the better part of a decade; for instance, the work at Dover Castle took place between 1179 and 1191 (at a cost of £7,000). Richard was present during part of the construction to ensure construction proceeded at a rate he was happy with. According to William of Newburgh, in May 1198 Richard and the labourers working on the castle were drenched in a &quot;rain of blood&quot;. While some of his advisers thought the rain was an evil omen, Richard was undeterred:

After just a year, Château Gaillard was approaching completion and Richard remarked &quot;Behold, how fair is this year-old daughter of mine!&quot; Richard later boasted that he could hold the castle &quot;were the walls made of butter&quot;. By 1198, the castle was largely completed. At one point, the castle was the site of the execution of three soldiers of the king of France in retaliation for a massacre of Welsh mercenaries ambushed by the French; the three were thrown to their deaths from the castle&#x27;s position high above the surrounding landscape. In his final years, the castle became Richard&#x27;s favourite residence, and writs and charters were written at Château Gaillard, bearing &quot;apud Bellum Castrum de Rupe&quot; (at the Fair Castle of the Rock). Richard did not enjoy the benefits of the castle for long, however, as he died in Limousin on 6 April 1199, from an infected arrow wound to his shoulder, sustained while besieging Châlus.

===The Siege of Château Gaillard===

After Richard&#x27;s death, King John of England failed to effectively defend Normandy against Philip&#x27;s ongoing campaigns between 1202 and 1204. The Château de Falaise fell to Philip&#x27;s forces, as well as castles from Mortain to Pontorson while Philip simultaneously besieged Rouen, which capitulated to French forces on 24 June 1204, effectively ending Norman independence. Philip laid siege to Château Gaillard, which was captured after a long siege from September 1203 to March 1204. As Philip continued the siege throughout the winter and King John made no attempt to relieve the castle, it was only a matter of time before the castellan was forced to capitulate. The main source for the siege is &quot;Philippidos&quot;, a poem by William the Breton, Philip&#x27;s chaplain. As a result, modern scholars have paid little attention to the fate of the civilians of Les Andelys during the siege.

The local Norman population sought refuge in the castle to escape from the French soldiers who ravaged the town. The castle was well supplied for a siege, but the extra mouths to feed rapidly diminished the stores. Between 1,400 and 2,200 non-combatants were allowed inside, increasing the number of people in the castle at least fivefold. In an effort to alleviate the pressure on the castle&#x27;s supplies, Roger de Lacy, the castellan, evicted 500 civilians; this first group was allowed to pass through the French lines unhindered, and a second group of similar size did the same a few days later. Philip was not present, and when he learned of the safe passage of the civilians, he forbade further people being allowed through the siege lines. The idea was to keep as many people as possible within Château Gaillard to drain its resources. Roger de Lacy evicted the remaining civilians from the castle, at least 400 people, and possibly as many as 1,200. The group was not allowed through, and the French opened fire on the civilians, who turned back to the castle for safety, but found the gates locked. They sought refuge at the base of the castle walls for three months; over the winter, more than half their number died from exposure and starvation. Philip arrived at Château Gaillard in February 1204, and ordered that the survivors should be fed and released. Such treatment of civilians in sieges was not uncommon, and such scenes were repeated much later at the sieges of Calais in 1346 and Rouen in 1418–1419, both in the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

The French gained access to the outermost ward by undermining its advanced main tower. Following this, Philip ordered a group of his men to look for a weak point in the castle. They gained access to the next ward when a soldier named Ralph found a latrine chute in use through which the French could clamber into the chapel. After ambushing several unsuspecting guards, and setting fire to the buildings, Philip&#x27;s men then lowered the movable bridge and allowed the rest of their army into the castle. The Anglo-Norman troops retreated to the inner ward. After a short time, the French successfully breached the gate of the inner ward, and the garrison retreated finally to the keep. With supplies running low, Roger de Lacy and his garrison of 20 knights and 120 other soldiers surrendered to the French army, bringing the siege to an end on 6 March 1204. In drawn-out medieval sieges, contemporary writers often emphasised the importance of dwindling supplies in the capitulation of the garrison, as was the case with the Siege of Château Gaillard. With the castle under French control, the main obstacle to the French entering the Seine valley was removed; they were able to enter the valley unmolested and take Normandy. Thus, for the first time since it had been given as a duchy to Rollo in 911, Normandy was directly ruled by the French king. The city of Rouen surrendered to Philip II on 23 June 1204. After that, the rest of Normandy was easily conquered by the French.

===Under French control===
In 1314, Château Gaillard was the prison of Margaret and Blanche of Burgundy, who both later became queens of France; they had been convicted of adultery in the &quot;Tour de Nesle&quot; Affair, and after having their heads shaved they were locked away in the fortress, where they remained, including throughout their respective reigns. Following the Scottish defeat at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, during the Second War of Scottish Independence, the child-king David II and certain of his court were forced to flee to France for safety. At the time, southern Scotland was occupied by the forces of King Edward III of England. David, then nine years old, and his bride Joan of the Tower, the twelve-year-old daughter of Edward II, were granted the use of Château Gaillard by Philip VI. It remained their residence until David&#x27;s return to Scotland in 1341. David did not stay out of English hands for long after his return; he was captured after the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross in 1346 and endured an eleven-year captivity in the Tower of London.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War between the English and French crowns, possession of the castle switched several times. Château Gaillard—along with Château de Gisors, Ivry-la-Bataille, and Mont Saint-Michel—was one of four castles in Normandy which offered resistance to Henry V of England in 1419, after the capitulation of Rouen and much of the rest of the Duchy. Château Gaillard was besieged for a year before it was surrendered to the English in December 1419; all the resisting castles except Mont Saint-Michel eventually fell, and Normandy was temporarily returned to English control. Étienne de Vignolles, a mercenary (&quot;routier&quot;) known as La Hire, then recaptured Château Gaillard for the French in 1430. However, the English were revived by the capture and execution of Joan of Arc, and although by then the war was turning against them, a month later they captured Château Gaillard again. When the French gained ascendancy again between 1449 and 1453, the English were forced out of the region, and in 1449 the castle was taken by the French for the last time.

By 1573, Château Gaillard was uninhabited and in a ruinous state, but it was still believed that the castle posed a threat to the local population if it was repaired. Therefore, at the request of the French States-General, King Henry IV ordered the demolition of Château Gaillard in 1599. Some of the building material was reused by Capuchin monks who were granted permission to use the stone for maintaining their monasteries. In 1611, the demolition of Château Gaillard came to an end. The site was left as a ruin, and in 1862 was classified as a &quot;monument historique&quot;. In 1962, a conference on the contributions of the Normans to medieval military architecture was held at Les Andelys. Allen Brown attended the conference and remarked that the castle was &quot;in satisfying receipt of skilful care and attention&quot;. The journal &quot;Château Gaillard: Études de Castellogie Médiévale&quot;, which was published as a result of the conference, has since run to 23 volumes, based on international conferences on the subject of castles. In the 1990s, archaeological excavations were carried out at Château Gaillard. The excavations investigated the north of the fortress, searching for an entrance postulated by architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, but no such entrance was found. However, the excavation did reveal was that there was an addition to the north of the castle to enable the use of guns. Typologically, the structure has been dated to the 16th century. The conclusion of the excavations was that the site had &quot;enormous archaeological potential&quot;, but that there were still unanswered questions about the castle. After Philip II took Chateau Gaillard, he repaired the collapsed tower of the outer bailey that had been used to gain access to the castle. The archaeological investigation examined the tower generally thought to be the one collapsed by Philip, and although it did not recover any dating evidence, the consensus is that he completely rebuilt the tower. In conjunction with the archaeological work, efforts were made to preserve the remaining structures. Today, Château Gaillard&#x27;s inner bailey is open to the public from March to November, while the outer baileys are open all year round.

==Layout and innovations==
Château Gaillard consists of three baileys—an inner, a middle, and an outer with the main entrance to the castle—and a keep, also called a donjon, in the inner bailey. The baileys, which were separated by rock-cut ditches, housed the castle&#x27;s stables, workshops, and storage facilities. It is common for extant castles to be the result of several phases of construction, and were adapted and added to over the period of their use; however Château Gaillard essentially is the result of one period of building. The division into three wards bears similarities with the design of Château de Chinon, built by Henry II in the mid-12th century on a promontory overlooking a town.

The outer bailey is the southernmost feature of the castle; it is pentagon shaped and there are five towers spaced along the wall, three of which are at corners. North of the outer bailey is the middle bailey which is an irregular polygon; like the outer bailey, the wall of the middle bailey is studded with towers. The towers allowed the garrison to provide enfilading fire. In the fashion of the time, most of the towers in the curtain walls of the middle and outer baileys were cylindrical. Château Gaillard was one of the first castles in Europe to use machicolations—stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall. Machicolations were introduced to Western architecture as a result of the Crusades. Until the 13th century, the tops of towers in European castles had usually been surrounded by wooden galleries, which served the same purpose as machicolations. An Eastern innovation, they may have originated in the first half of the 8th century.

Within the middle bailey was the inner bailey. The gatehouse from the middle of the inner bailey was one of the earliest examples of towers flanking the entrance to remove the blind spot immediately in front of the gate. This was part of a wider trend from around the late 12th or 13th century onwards for castle gateways to be strongly defended.

The design of the inner bailey, with its wall studded with semicircular projections, is unparalleled. This innovation had two advantages: firstly, the rounded wall absorbed the damage from siege engines much better as it did not provide a perfect angle to aim at; secondly, the arrowslits in the curved wall allowed arrows to be fired at all angles. The inner bailey, which contained the main residential buildings, used the principles of concentric defence. This and the unusual design of the inner bailey&#x27;s curtain wall meant that castle was advanced for its age, since it was built before concentric fortification was fully developed in Crusader castles such as Krak des Chevaliers. Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe; for instance, when Edward I of England—who had himself been on Crusade—built castles in Wales in the late 13th century, four of the eight he founded were concentric.

The keep was inside the inner bailey and contained the king&#x27;s accommodation. It had two rooms: an antechamber and an audience room. While Allen Brown interpreted the audience room as the king&#x27;s chamber, historian Liddiard believes it is probably a throne room. A throne room emphasises the political importance of the castle. In England there is nothing similar to Château Gaillard&#x27;s keep, but there are buildings with a similar design in France in the 12th and 13th centuries.

Allen Brown described Château Gaillard as &quot;one of the finest castles in Europe&quot; and the military historian Sir Charles Oman wrote that:
Despite Château Gaillard&#x27;s reputation as a great fortress, Liddiard highlights the absence of a well in the keep as a peculiar weakness, and the castle was built on soft chalk, which would have allowed the walls to be undermined. But other sources evoke the presence of three wells in the three different baileys and the soft chalk does not really weaken the very thick walls. Its weakness is more the result of its location (higher hill behind), its extension (more than ) on a long narrow ridge and the difficulties in linking up the different baileys to allow a good communication and to secure an efficient defence without a large garrison.

Château Gaillard was important not solely as a military structure, but as a salient symbol of the power of Richard the Lionheart. It was a statement of dominance by Richard, having reconquered the lands Philip II had taken. Castles such as Château Gaillard in France, and Dover Castle in England, were amongst the most advanced of their age, but were surpassed in both sophistication and cost by the works of Edward I of England in the latter half of the 13th century.

<doc id="1114155" wikidata="Q31582" url="?curid=1114155" title="Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy">
<text>The Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) is a process established by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) for the resolution of disputes regarding the registration of internet domain names. The UDRP currently applies to all generic top level domains (.com, .net, .org, etc.), some country code top-level domains, and to all new generic top-level domains (.xyz, .online, .top, etc.).

== Historical background ==
When ICANN was first set up, one of the core tasks assigned to it was &quot;The Trademark Dilemma&quot;, the use of trade marks as domain names without the trademark owner&#x27;s consent. By the late 1990s, such use was identified as problematic and likely to lead to consumers being misled. In the United Kingdom, the Court of Appeal described such domain names as &quot;an instrument of fraud&quot;.

One of the first steps was that Member States commissioned the United Nations World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to produce a report on the tension between trademarks and domain names. Published on 30 April 1999, the WIPO Report recommended the establishment of a &quot;mandatory administrative procedure concerning abusive registrations&quot;, which would allow for a &quot;neutral venue in the context of disputes that are often international in nature.&quot; The procedure was not intended to deal with cases with competing rights, nor would it exclude the jurisdiction of the courts. It would, however, be mandatory in the sense that &quot;each domain name application would, in the domain name agreement, be required to submit to the procedure if a claim was initiated against it by a third party. The WIPO Report also set out the current three-stage test of the UDRP.

At its meetings on August 25 and 26, 1999 in Santiago, Chile, the ICANN Board of Directors adopted the UDRP Policy, based on the recommendations contained in the Report of the WIPO Internet Domain Name Process, as well as comments submitted by registrars and other interested parties.

On October 24, 1999, the ICANN Board adopted a set of Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the UDRP Rules) setting out the procedures and other requirements for each stage of the dispute resolution administrative procedure. The procedure is administered by dispute resolution service providers accredited by ICANN.

Following adoption by ICANN, the UDRP was launched on 1 December 1999, and the first case determined under it by WIPO was &quot;World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc v. Michael Bosman&quot;, involving the domain name worldwrestlingfederation.com. Since then WIPO provides a globally-used Jurisprudential Overview to summarize case law on a range of common and important substantive and procedural issues under the UDRP.

== Adoption ==
The policy has been adopted by all ICANN-accredited registrars. It has also been adopted by certain managers of country-code top-level domains (e.g., .nu, .tv, .ws).

The policy is then applicable due to the contract between the registrar (or other registration authority in the case of a country-code top-level domain) and its customer (the domain-name holder or registrant). When a registrant chooses a domain name, the registrant must &quot;represent and warrant&quot;, among other things, that registering the domain name &quot;will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party&quot;, and agree to participate in an arbitration-like proceeding should any third party assert such a claim.

The policy itself sets forth the terms and conditions in connection with a dispute between the registrant and any party (other than the registrar) over the registration and use of the Internet domain name registered by the registrant.

In case of a dispute, the complainant shall select one of the administrative-dispute-resolution service providers from among those approved by ICANN by submitting the complaint to that Provider. The selected Provider will administer the proceeding. Proceedings under this Policy will be conducted according to the Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, as well as the selected administrative-dispute-resolution service provider&#x27;s supplemental rules.

Providers of the UDRP are:
* The Arab Center for Dispute Resolution (ACDR)
* The Asian Domain Name Dispute Resolution Centre (ADNDRC)
* Canadian International Internet Dispute Resolution Centre (CIIDRC)
* Czech Arbitration Court, Arbitration Center for Internet Disputes
* National Arbitration Forum (NAF)
* World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)

== Process ==
A complainant in a UDRP proceeding must establish three elements to succeed:
* The domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights;
* The registrant does not have any rights or legitimate interests in the domain name; and
* The domain name has been registered and the domain name is being used in &quot;bad faith&quot;.

In a UDRP proceeding, a panel will consider several non-exclusive factors to assess bad faith, such as:
* Whether the registrant registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark;
* Whether the registrant registered the domain name to prevent the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, if the domain name owner has engaged in a pattern of such conduct; and
* Whether the registrant registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor; or
* Whether by using the domain name, the registrant has intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, internet users to the registrant&#x27;s website, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant&#x27;s mark.

The goal of the UDRP is to create a streamlined process for resolving such disputes. It was envisioned that this process would be quicker and less expensive than a standard legal challenge in a national or foreign court. In addition, the procedures are more informal than litigation and the decision-makers are experts in such areas as international trademark law, domain name issues, electronic commerce, the Internet and dispute resolution. It is also international in scope: it provides a single mechanism for resolving a domain name dispute regardless of where the registrar or the domain name holder or the complainant are located.

In order to file a UDRP complaint with a UDRP provider, the costs often start around US$1,000 to $2,000. The costs of the case will depend on the number of domain names involved and whether the case is decided by a single or by 3 panelists. For example, a case handled by the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center, involving between 6 and 10 domain names and decided by 3 panelists would cost US$ 5,000. Those fees do not include any payment that might have to be made to a lawyer representing a party in the administrative proceeding. Fees are available in Providers supplemental rules. In order to assist parties in filing their pleadings, WIPO provides a guide of case law called the WIPO Overview; this resource summarizes almost 1,000 UDRP decisions from hundreds of expert panelists.

If a party loses a UDRP proceeding, in many jurisdictions they may still bring a lawsuit against the domain name registrant under local law. For example, the administrative panel&#x27;s UDRP decision can be challenged and in effect “overturned” in a U.S. court of law by means of e.g. the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act. If a domain name registrant loses a UDRP proceeding, they can file a lawsuit against the trademark holder within ten business days to prevent a registrar from transferring the domain name in the relevant jurisdiction (either the location of the registrar&#x27;s principal office or the registrant&#x27;s location).

== Examples ==
The UDRP process has been used in a number of well-known cases.

In the &quot;Madonna Ciccone, p/k/a Madonna v. Dan Parisi and &quot;Madonna.com&quot;&quot; case (2000), the panel found against the defendant registrant based on all three of the above factors and ordered the domain name turned over to Madonna. On the other hand, in the &quot;Gordon Sumner p/k/a Sting v Michael Urvan&quot; on the same year, American gamer Michael Urvan retained the right to domain name &quot;sting.com&quot; against the complaint of Sting, since the panel found that &#x27;sting&#x27; was a common dictionary word, it was not registered as a trademark, and that Urvan was using the name in good faith rather than holding it to ransom.

In the &quot;Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Richard MacLeod d/b/a For Sale&quot; case (2000), the decision describes the practice of cybersquatting. The UDRP was adopted to prevent such behavior where a domain name registrant tries to extort money from trademark owners. In this case, the expert found that the evidence showed the registrant was not using the domain name “wal-martsucks.com” for a criticism site but instead try to get a payout from Walmart.

The &quot;Oki Data Americas, Inc. v. ASD, Inc.&quot; case (2001) is one of the most cited &quot;fair use&quot; decisions under the UDRP, it raises the question of whether an authorized (and non-authorized) sales or service agent of trademarked goods can use the trademark in a domain name.

&quot;The Commissioners for HM Revenue and Customs v. Adil Khasanov&quot; case (2020) provides an example of the impact of the Covid-19 crisis in the Domain Name System, and the increasing number of fraudulent domain name registrations.

== Domain name disputes under new generic top-level domains ==
In 2012, ICANN launched a process to create new generic top-level domains (gTLDs). Over 1,900 applications were made. As part of the expansion of the domain name system, ICANN introduced a number of new brand protection mechanisms. Opinions differ as to whether or not these new processes will be effective. Industry commentators predict that the UDRP will continue to be used, and that there will be a &quot;substantial increase in cybersquatting&quot;. Evidence from previous expansions of the namespace, however, indicates the continued dominance of .com both in size and as the first-choice domain for cybersquatting (based on number of disputes).

The WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center was appointed by ICANN as the exclusive provider of dispute resolution services for trademark based &quot;pre-delegation&quot; Legal Rights Objections (LRO) under ICANN New gTLD Program. The WIPO Center 2013 Report provides a resume and analysis in relation to the Legal Rights Objection (LRO) procedure where trademark owners could object to a new gTLD application they worried might infringe their rights.

<doc id="1114161" wikidata="Q597883" url="?curid=1114161" title="C.D. Luis Ángel Firpo">
<text>Club Deportivo Luis Ángel Firpo (often abbreviated to Firpo) is an El Salvador professional association football club based in Usulután.

The club is the second-oldest in El Salvador and was founded as Tecún Umán on September 17, 1923, by a group of local citizens in Usulután. It was soon renamed in honor of Argentine boxer Luis Ángel Firpo, who became the first Latin American to fight for the heavyweight championship, knocking Jack Dempsey out of the ring on September 14, 1923.

Firpo has played at their home ground, Estadio Sergio Torres, since 1930. The team&#x27;s mascot is the bull, a reference to Firpo, who was known as the Wild Bull of the Pampas.

==History==

===Early history and first golden era===
On September 17, 1923, a group of Usulután citizens, mostly of European descent, decided to form a team that represented their community&#x27;s passion for football. The club elected Gustavo Denys as their first club chairman. They decided to choose red and blue as their team&#x27;s colours. Originally named &quot;Tecún Umán&quot;, the club was soon renamed in honor of Luis Ángel Firpo, a famous Argentine boxer.

On November 9, 1923, Club Deportivo Sandino, also based in Usulutan, wanted to merge with Firpo, and it almost came to fruition. However, the main sticking point was that Sandino wanted to appoint the majority of the 41 club directors (36 to Sandino and only five Firpo directors). Following the impasse, Firpo rejected the offer.

The members of CD Luis Ángel Firpo acquired land near Sergio Torres creek to develop and build a stadium.

At the end of 1930s, Former player Miguel &quot;el Zancudo&quot; Segurado was named football manager, He centred the team around potent players such as Luis &quot;Chispo&quot; Morataya, &quot;Queco&quot; Bolanos, Napoleon Flores Huezo, the Zamora brothers (Ricardo and Miguel), the Quinteros brothers (Leonidas and Lázaro), and the Aguila brothers (Ramón and Mario). the most influential player was midfielder Luis Antonio Regalado, who in 1942 become the first player from LA Firpo to represent El Salvador&#x27;s national team.

On 22 March 1942, Firpo won their first state title for the Zona Oriental (Eastern State), defeating America de Chinameca 2–1. This allowed them to compete in a round robin competition for the national title against Quequeisque (Central State champion), Ferroccarril (Zona Occidente) and Juventud Olímpica.
Firpo lost their first match against Quequeisque 6–1, this was followed by 2–1 win against Ferrocarrill, however Quequeisque won the title due to winning two games and drawing one. Firpo finished in third place.

On 25 April 1943, Firpo won their second Zona Oriental title by defeating Corona (San Miguel) 5–3. Once again Firpo competed in a round robin competition for the national title. In the first game Firpo played against reigning champion Quequeisque were the game was tied for the majority of the game 1-1 thanks to goal from Leonidas Quinteros, Sadly Firpo were not able to hold back the tide and lost the game 8–1. This was followed by 2–2 draw against Ferrocarill, another heavy loss against Quequeisque 7–1, and their only victory in the tournament 2–1 against Ferrocarrill. Firpo once again finished in third place.

Due to World War 2, no state competition or final competition were played, Firpo played a series of friendlies which included 3–2 loss against Quequeisque, 5–0 loss against Espana, Loss against Mecca (Santa Ana) 2–1, and 1–0 win against Juventud Olímpica.

In 1946, Firpo played their first ever international against Honduran Federal tying 3-3, with all three goals scored by Rafael Galvez.

In 1946, Firpo once again represented eastern zone, against Libertad and Once Municipal, Firpo lost both matches against Libertad 2–0, managed to draw 1–1 against Once Municipal and lost 3–1 in their final game.

In 1948, Firpo participated in the first national championship. Firpo played 22 out of 24 games, winning 16 games, drawing 7 games, and losing 6 games with a fifth-place finish. . Firpo didn&#x27;t play the final two games as Once Municipal were crowned national champion with two games to spare.

===Difficult years, moderate success and downfall===
The following years were plagued with financial instability, players from the first golden era started retiring or leaving. This culminated with the disastrous 1951-52 Campaign, which included 5–0 loss against Leones, 5–4 loss against Independiente, a stripped 2–1 victory Santa Anita due to players being ineligible, their first victory coming after more than half the season played against Juventud Olímpica; this would be their only victory as they only gained five points and finished last in the league.

After signing Honduran Armando Enamorado and Costa Rican Jacobo Godoy ahead of the 1955–56 season, the club finished runner up by one point to Atletico Marte. In the 1957–58 season Firpo was relegated to the second division after only grabbing 13 points from 20 games.

Firpo hired Former player Narciso Romagoza to coach the team in the second division, Firpo first won the privilege to represent Zona oriental in the final round robin tournament against El Renacimiento de Santa Ana and Platense. Firpo finished the tournament as champion after winning two games, 1 draw and one loss. This allowed Firpo to be promoted after one season, but the same issues arose with economic problems and players departing, which culminated in Firpo being relegated to second division just two years later.

===&quot;Yo-yo club&quot;: consecutive promotion and relegations===
After being relegated in 1962, The club was stuck in the second division for four years, but in 1967 - thanks to the players such as Raul Corcio Zavaleta, and foreign players Andres Paretti &amp; Julio Escobar, Firpo were able to finish in the top spot over historic clubs Dragon, Santa Anita and Rey Y Negro. However the success was short lived as they were relegated just two years later in 1969.

In 1972, Firpo decided to hire more experienced players including world cup player Sergio Méndez, Alfredo Erado, Fausto Vasquez and Miguel &quot;Miche&quot; Cornejo, they once again were able to reach promotion. Although Firpo were technically relegated in 1982, however Firpo purchased Agave&#x27;s first division spot for 25,000 colones. During this period Firpo were struggling financially off the field and on the field, being midtable or bottom.

===Minor success and rebuild===
Following this, Firpo president Gustavo Torres Cerna and nephew Sergio Torres Rivera made a collective, ambitious effort to rebuild the team; he brought quality foreign players such as Argentinian Guillermo Fisher, Brazilians Sebastian Pio da Silva, Carlos Lopez Neves and Nelson de Moraes. The latter, along with Francisco Jovel made Firpo a solid team that was able to consistently qualify for the playoffs during the next five seasons; however, the club&#x27;s decline in rhythm combined with poor goalscoring in the playoffs prevented them from any real success.

In 1988 nephew Sergio Torres Rivera took over the previous president position, which would begin Firpo&#x27;s true glory years. Sergio Torres would establish a strong financial sponsorship which included renewal El Salvador conglomerate La Tapachulteca and William Handal. The club would scout promising young players throughout the league such as future captain and national player Leonel Carcamo, Miguel Estrada, Juan Agustin Gamez, and Jose Maria Batres. This was combined with established experienced players such as Giovanni Trigueros, Nelson Rivera, Miguel Arevalo, Mauricio Cienfuegos, and Marlon Menjívar.

Finally they would send scouts down to South America, convincing Peruvian national team players Martín Duffó and Miguel Seminario to sign for the club, later stopping in Brazil to pick up Brazilian pairings Toninho dos Santos and Fernando Da Moura.

===Golden generation===
In the 1988–89 season, the team hoisted the league title for the first time. The team finished third in the regular season, but the club nonetheless dismissed Argentinian coach Juan Quarterone before the playoffs. In his place, they hired former player Chilean Julio Escobar. Escobar justified the club&#x27;s faith by leading the team through the championship round and into the finals. Their match against Cojutepeque was drawn 2–2 after extra time, setting up a penalty shootout. Firpo prevailed 4–3, with Leonel Carcamo scoring the winning penalty.

The club went on a 31 match unbeaten streak beginning with 1-1 draw with FAS on the August, 1990 and concluding on April, 1991 after a 1-0 loss to Tiburones. Salvadoran Keeper Carlos Rivera and Brazilian defender Fernando de Moura had the distinction of participating in every game in 31 game unbeaten streak. The club also made their biggest transfer in the club history when they sold Brazilian Toninho dos Santos, who was the club top-scorer at the time with 11 goals, to Mexican powerhouse team Club America for 100,000 dollars. Despite the loss of such a powerhouse player, the club went on to reach the final, thanks the club leading scorer Edgar Henriquez with 12 goals. Firpo went on defeat Aguila 1–0 in the final with Marlon Menjívar scored the sole goal.

After a successful campaign, Juan Carlos Masnik resigned as coach to return to Uruguay, The club will hire Yugoslavian (later Macedonian) Kiril Dojčinovski who had experience as player in red Star Belgrade and participated for Yugoslavia 1974 world cup. The club will regain Brazilian Nildeson from loan, will purchase Chilean Raúl Toro and the league top scorer Raúl Díaz Arce from Alianza and Dragon respectively, and lastly they promoted Fernando Lazo and Pedro Vasquez from the club youth Squad.

Under the reins of Kiril Dojčinovski the club will win back-to-back championships (1991-92 and 1992-93).

In the 1991-92 season, The club would finish first in the regular season and Quadrangular round, the club continued dominance was thanks to having multiple goal scorers, with Brazilian Fernando de Moura topping the list with 14 goals, followed by compatriot Nildeson with 12 goals, Raúl Díaz Arce with 8 goals, rounding out with Edgar Henriquez and Marlon Menjivar with 7 goals. The club will show their complete dominance in final, defeating Alianza 3-0 thanks to a double from Nildeson and Fernando de Moura.

In the following season 1992-93 season, The club was shocked by the departure of Kiril Dojčinovski during the pre-season, and was replaced by Chilean Hernan Carrasco. With the same squad, the club fell off the pace and were behind Alianza and FAS during the final half of rounds, The club decided to part way with Hernan Carrasco and rehire Kiril Dojčinovski, who would steady the ship allowing the club to finish second in the regular standing and win the Quadrangular round, which allowed the club to qualify to the final against Alianza. Once again the club would defeat Alianza thanks to goals from Brazilian Celio Rodriguez and Raul Diaz Arce. The club would win their first tri-Championship in their history and first time since Atletico Marte who did it previously between the 1955 to 1957 seasons.

They reached either the semi-finals or finals every year from 1994 to 1997, then won the championship again in 1998. That win came over FAS 2–0, with the goals being scored by Raúl Toro and Abraham Monterrosa.

In 2000, Club president and owner Sergio Torres died the week before the final match against ADET, and the players dedicated the match to his memory. They went on to win, bringing home their seventh title.

===Modern era===
After 2000, Firpo&#x27;s success began to decline. With players retiring, moving abroad, or being sold onto other clubs, the death of Sergio Torres cost the team their primary sponsor and led the club into financial instability. As a result, Firpo reached the grand final repeatedly, but could not win another title for seven years.

In the 2007 Apertura, Argentinian coach Horacio Cordero guided the team to another final, and they defeated FAS 5–3 in a penalty shootout.

<text>Kelseys Original Roadhouse is a Canadian restaurant chain headquartered in Vaughan, Ontario owned by Recipe Unlimited. Founded in 1978, there are Kelseys restaurants in Ontario, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador.

==History==
Once a chain of more than 140 locations from Quebec westerly to British Columbia, the company has closed all locations in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec. In Ontario, numerous locations across the company have closed including locations in Kitchener, Simcoe, and Fort Erie. The Owen Sound location was due to close on December 20, 2013. As of November 2013 there are just 88 Kelseys locations left in Canada, primarily in the province of Ontario. As of October 2024 there are 67 Kelseys locations, 65 in Ontario, one in New Brunswick, and one in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
Kelseys has a licensing agreement through early 2011 with CBS Consumer Products for the rights to the theme song from the 1980s sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;, which the chain says could lead to &quot;other opportunities&quot; in the future. Kelseys also uses the show&#x27;s title in its slogan &quot;Cheers to good friends&quot;, although (due to the generic nature of the word &quot;cheers&quot; in regards to pubs and the like) it is not clear whether permission from CBS was required for this.

===Rebranding===
Kelseys&#x27; parent company Recipe Unlimited has been going through an era of rebranding and renovations including its location at 1011 The Queensway Etobicoke, Ontario where the company is piloting a new restaurant design that features an emphasis on a newer style of Kelseys dining experience. Many under-performing Kelseys restaurants have been closing down over the past couple of years and the new design is going to try to change the customer&#x27;s eating experience to become more lively and exciting. The restaurant&#x27;s old slogan &quot;Neighbourhood Bar and Grill&quot; has been updated to &quot;Ambitiously Hardworking and Sociably Unpredictable&quot;. Bright neon colours are found throughout the restaurant along with an upgraded menu that features a smaller and more limited selection of the most popular items found at other Kelseys locations. The new bar menu that was first used at this Kelseys is now available throughout all 88 locations in Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. The new bar menu is modelled after its location in Etobicoke featuring bright neon colours along with new, pub-style items. The restaurant design is going to be applied to more locations when the franchisees choose to upgrade.

==Criticism==
A CBC Marketplace investigation in February 2018 found the Kelseys servers in Ontario had to tip out 3% of their sales, a rise from 2% prior to the province&#x27;s minimum wage increase.

<doc id="1114170" wikidata="Q458609" url="?curid=1114170" title="Dortmunder Actien Brauerei">
<text>Dortmunder Actien Brauerei is a German brewery in the city of Dortmund, founded in 1868 by the businessmen Laurenz Fischer and Heinrich and Friedrich Mauritz together with master brewer Heinrich Herberz. Originally, it was called Herberz &amp; Co Brewery (Bierbrauerei Herberz &amp; Co.).

==History==
Due to business steadily improving, the company expanded and went public in 1872, changing its name to &quot;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei&quot; (Dortmund Joint Stock Brewery).

In 1879, the company started to export its beer internationally.

In 1881, Carl von Linde himself equipped the brewery with one of his refrigeration machines, allowing for a boom of bottom-fermented beer.

In 1893, the brewery established a chemical and bacteriological laboratory. 

Although World War I led to a crash in beer production, the brewery was equipped with its own railway connection in 1917. After the near-total destruction of Dortmund in World War II, the brewery was rebuilt by 1949.

From 1959 to 1963, DAB switched from the old wooden to new aluminium barrels. The Hansa Brewery, a local competitor, was acquired in 1971.

On its grounds, DAB erected a new modern brewery, finished in 1983, at the time the largest of the Ruhr area. However, the cost of the acquisition of Hansa was substantial, and burdened DAB for years to come. Questionable decisions by the company management in the 1990s exacerbated the situation, leading to a collapse of the company brands and the increasing production of generic brands to make use of the capacities.

Even the acquisition of the brand names of another local competitor in economic difficulties, the Kronen Brewery, could not stop the downward trend which to this day, even though the company is the last brewery in Dortmund, has not been fully stopped.

Most prominent stock holder today is the Radeberger Group of breweries, which in turn belongs to the company founded by August Oetker, today one of the most prominent players in the German food and drink industry.

DAB produces a lager called DAB after their initials. DAB was the favorite beer of Erich Honecker, former leader of East Germany.

==Dortmunder Hansa==

The former Hansa Brewery is in the North-Central section of Dortmund. Dortmunder Actien Brauerei took over Hansa in 1971. 
Dortmunder Hansa refers to a number of beers, popular due in part to low price. Hansa brews a variety of beers, including Pilsener, Altbier, Malzbier, Kölsch and wheat beer. Because of its low price, Hansa Pils is often used in Radler. The low price also led to its popularity in the punk subculture in Germany.

The facility also houses the Dortmunder Brewery Museum. Before changing its name to Dortmunder Hansa, the beer was brewed in the same location, then called the Borussia Brewery.

<doc id="1114171" wikidata="Q1431456" url="?curid=1114171" title="Order (ring theory)">
<text>In mathematics, an order in the sense of ring theory is a subring formula_1 of a ring formula_2, such that

#&quot;formula_2&quot; is a finite-dimensional algebra over the field formula_4 of rational numbers
#formula_1 spans &quot;formula_2&quot; over formula_4, and
#formula_1 is a formula_9-lattice in &quot;formula_2&quot;.

The last two conditions can be stated in less formal terms: Additively, formula_1 is a free abelian group generated by a basis for &quot;formula_2&quot; over formula_4.

More generally for &quot;formula_14&quot; an integral domain with fraction field &quot;formula_15&quot;, an &quot;formula_14&quot;-order in a finite-dimensional &quot;formula_15&quot;-algebra &quot;formula_2&quot; is a subring formula_1 of &quot;formula_2&quot; which is a full &quot;formula_14&quot;-lattice; i.e. is a finite &quot;formula_14&quot;-module with the property that &quot;formula_23&quot;.

When &quot;formula_2&quot; is not a commutative ring, the idea of order is still important, but the phenomena are different. For example, the Hurwitz quaternions form a maximal order in the quaternions with rational co-ordinates; they are not the quaternions with integer coordinates in the most obvious sense. Maximal orders exist in general, but need not be unique: there is in general no largest order, but a number of maximal orders. An important class of examples is that of integral group rings.

==Examples==
Some examples of orders are:
* If formula_2 is the matrix ring formula_26 over formula_15, then the matrix ring formula_28 over formula_14 is an formula_14-order in formula_2
* If formula_14 is an integral domain and formula_33 a finite separable extension of formula_15, then the integral closure formula_35 of formula_14 in formula_33 is an formula_14-order in formula_33.
* If formula_40 in formula_2 is an integral element over formula_14, then the polynomial ring formula_43 is an formula_14-order in the algebra formula_45
* If formula_2 is the group ring formula_47 of a finite group formula_48, then formula_49 is an formula_14-order on formula_47

A fundamental property of formula_14-orders is that every element of an formula_14-order is integral over formula_14.

If the integral closure formula_35 of formula_14 in formula_2 is an formula_14-order then the integrality of every element of every formula_14-order shows that formula_35 must be the unique maximal formula_14-order in formula_2. However formula_35 need not always be an formula_14-order: indeed formula_35 need not even be a ring, and even if formula_35 is a ring (for example, when formula_2 is commutative) then formula_35 need not be an formula_14-lattice.

==Algebraic number theory==
The leading example is the case where &quot;formula_2&quot; is a number field &quot;formula_15&quot; and formula_1 is its ring of integers. In algebraic number theory there are examples for any &quot;formula_15&quot; other than the rational field of proper subrings of the ring of integers that are also orders. For example, in the field extension &quot;formula_74&quot; of Gaussian rationals over formula_4, the integral closure of &quot;formula_9&quot; is the ring of Gaussian integers &quot;formula_77&quot; and so this is the unique &quot;maximal&quot; &quot;formula_9&quot;-order: all other orders in &quot;formula_2&quot; are contained in it. For example, we can take the subring of complex numbers of the form formula_80, with formula_40 and formula_82 integers.

The maximal order question can be examined at a local field level. This technique is applied in algebraic number theory and modular representation theory.

<text>Montana&#x27;s BBQ &amp; Bar (originally and in some cases, still branded as Montana&#x27;s Cookhouse Saloon) is a Canadian restaurant chain known for smoked pork ribs, steaks, and burgers. It is headquartered in Vaughan, Ontario and is a subsidiary of Recipe Unlimited.

==Operations==
Montana&#x27;s BBQ &amp; Bar has 105 restaurants located in all the Canadian provinces except Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and none in the three territories. As of February 2009, Montana&#x27;s closed their United States locations in Michigan and New York.

==History==
Montana&#x27;s Cookhouse first opened its doors in 1995 as a subsidiary of Kelseys Original Roadhouse. The original idea was thought up by Kelsey&#x27;s owner Paul Jeffery and its president Nils Kravis. In 1999, Cara Operations (now known as Recipe Unlimited) obtained controlling interest in Kelsey&#x27;s, including the Montana&#x27;s chain. Cara completed its acquisition of the entire company 2002.

, the chain began rebranding as Montana&#x27;s BBQ &amp; Bar.

==Brier sponsorship==
In 2024, Montana&#x27;s became the title sponsor of The Brier, the Canadian men&#x27;s curling championship. Montana&#x27;s replaced Tim Hortons, which had sponsored the Brier beginning in 2005.

==Loyalty program==

Montana&#x27;s began a partnership with Scene+ in February 2015 (then known as Scene).

<text>Roger Hunt (20 July 1938 – 27 September 2021) was an English professional footballer who played as a forward.

Eleven years with Liverpool, he was the club&#x27;s record goalscorer with 285 goals until being overtaken by Ian Rush. Nonetheless, Hunt remains Liverpool&#x27;s record league goalscorer with 244 goals. Under Bill Shankly, Hunt won two league titles and an FA Cup. In August 1964 he also scored the first ever goal seen on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day&quot;. Regarded as one of Liverpool&#x27;s greatest ever players, Hunt is referred to as &quot;Sir Roger&quot; by the club&#x27;s fans, ranking 13th on the 100 Players Who Shook the Kop, an official fan poll.

Hunt was a member of the England national team which won the 1966 FIFA World Cup, playing in all England&#x27;s six games, scoring three times. Hunt was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Glazebury, Lancashire, Hunt played for Croft Youth Club, Stockton Heath and Devizes Town during his formative years.

===Liverpool===
He was signed for Liverpool by manager Phil Taylor in July 1958, joining from Stockton Heath. Hunt made his debut and scored his first goal for the club on 9 September 1959 in a Second Division fixture at Anfield against Scunthorpe United; Hunt scored in the 64th minute to give the Reds a 2–0 victory. This goal was the first of many – he went on to score 286 goals for the club, 244 of them in the league, which remains a club record.

After Bill Shankly replaced Taylor, Shankly and his fellow &#x27;Boot Room&#x27; coaching staff embarked upon a clear out of 24 players. Hunt however was retained and was a major factor in the Reds&#x27; success in the 1960s. Liverpool gained promotion to the First Division in 1962, after the club had finished 3rd or 4th, and thus just outside the promotion spots for five consecutive years from 1956 to 1961. Hunt appeared in 41 of the 42 league games and scored 41 goals in season 1961–1962. His goals helped propel Liverpool to a comfortable eight point title win over runners-up Leyton Orient and included five hat-tricks, coming against Leeds United, Walsall, Swansea Town, former club Bury and Middlesbrough. It was a similar story in 1963–64 and 1965–66 as Liverpool were English League champions. Hunt again the top scorer (as he was for eight straight seasons) scoring 31 goals from 41 games and 29 goals from 37 appearances respectively. On 22 August 1964, Hunt scored against Arsenal after 11 minutes in a 3–2 home win, the first ever goal seen on the BBC&#x27;s flagship football highlights programme &quot;Match of the Day&quot;.

In between the two titles, in 1965 he was instrumental in the side winning the FA Cup for the first time. Hunt scored four times in a cup run that saw West Bromwich Albion, Stockport County, Bolton Wanderers, Leicester City and Chelsea all defeated as Liverpool reached the final for the first time since 1950. In the final, after a goal-less 90 minutes, Hunt scored the opening goal in the 93rd minute and strike partner Ian St. John scored the second as the Reds recorded a 2–1 victory over Leeds United at Wembley. He scored Liverpool&#x27;s only goal in the final of the Cup Winners Cup the following year, as they lost 2–1 after extra time to Borussia Dortmund.

He became Liverpool&#x27;s record goalscorer on 7 November 1967 in an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup tie against TSV 1860 Munich of West Germany, in which he scored his 242nd goal for the club. His final tally for the club was 286 goals by the time he left the club in 1969 to join Bolton Wanderers, a record that was not broken until Ian Rush 23 years later. He also held the record of scoring 100 top-flight goals in fewer games (152) than any player in Liverpool history, until Mohamed Salah reached the milestone in one game less in September 2021.

===Later career===
He signed for Bolton Wanderers in December 1969. In 1971, he moved on loan to Hellenic F.C. in South Africa&#x27;s National Football League. He retired in 1972, and had a testimonial with Liverpool in April 1972, attended by 56,000 people.

==International career==
Hunt was capped 34 times for his country, with his debut given to him by Walter Winterbottom whilst he was still a Second Division player on 4 April 1962, in a friendly against Austria at Wembley. He scored on his international debut as England won 3–1. He was part of the England squad at the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile, but was not selected to play.

England had been chosen to host the 1966 FIFA World Cup, and Hunt, along with Liverpool club mates Ian Callaghan and Gerry Byrne, were selected by manager Alf Ramsey for the 22-man squad.
Hunt was one of three forwards selected for the tournament. He initially partnered Tottenham Hotspur striker Jimmy Greaves up front, but following a leg injury to Greaves he played alongside Geoff Hurst of West Ham United.
He played in all six games, scoring three times, twice against France and once against Mexico, as England went on to win the Jules Rimet trophy after a 4–2 extra time win over West Germany in the World Cup Final at Wembley.

A section of the England fans (from the south of England) blamed Hunt (a northerner who played for a northern team) for replacing Greaves in the World Cup Final, and would boo him on his subsequent appearances for England (even though it was actually the Londoner Geoff Hurst who replaced Greaves). Following this, Hunt eventually told Alf Ramsey in 1969, following a game against Romania, that he no longer wished to play for England, and retired from international football.

==Later and personal life==
After retiring as a player, he joined his brother Peter, in taking over Hunt Brothers, as the third generation of the family-run haulage business. It was originally established by Richard and Harry Hunt in 1929.

In 2000 he was awarded an MBE for his World Cup victory. He continued to be known as &quot;Sir&quot; Roger Hunt by the Liverpool supporters, despite the absence of a formal knighthood.

Hunt was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2006, recognising his achievements in the English game. He was voted at number 13 by Liverpool fans on the official Liverpool Football Club in the 100 Players Who Shook The Kop poll, also in 2006. In 2016 he was made an Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Warrington.

Hunt was married in 1959 to Patricia O&#x27;Brien (whom he met when working at her brother-in-law&#x27;s nightclub) and they had two children. They divorced in 1981 after Hunt had an affair with a woman whom he had met in the local pub. He lived with his second wife Rowan (Green), near Warrington.

Hunt died on 27 September 2021 at the age of 83. His funeral was held on 14 October at Liverpool Cathedral.

<text>Paul Robert Holmes (born 16 January 1957) is a politician in the United Kingdom. He was the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Chesterfield, previously held by Tony Benn, from 2001 to 2010.

==Early life==
He grew up in Sheffield on a council estate. He went to Prince Edward Primary School, Manor Top, then Firth Park Secondary School (now Firth Park Community Arts College), a comprehensive from 1969 (when he was 12).

==Career==
Holmes graduated in History from the University of York in 1978 and before being elected an MP, was a history teacher for 22 years. He gained a PGCE from the University of Sheffield. He taught from 1979–84 at Chesterfield School (now Brookfield Community School), then Buxton College from 1984–90, and from 1990–2001 he was Head of Sixth Form at Buxton Community School (the successor to Buxton College).

==Political career==
Holmes joined the SDP in 1983. From 1987–95, representing the Liberal Democrats, he was a councillor for Brimington South Ward, then from 1999–2003 for Walton ward on Chesterfield Borough Council. Holmes is currently the lead councillor for the opposition on Chesterfield Borough Council and is a councillor for Barrow Hill and New Whittington ward.

==Parliamentary career==
His election as chairman of the parliamentary party in 2005 was a surprise to many, since it came at the expense of incumbent chairman Matthew Taylor (a close friend of then Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy). Commentators attributed the result to dissatisfaction with some elements of Kennedy&#x27;s leadership and a belief amongst MPs that the role of party chairman should be more that of a backbenchers&#x27; &#x27;shop steward&#x27; and less under the influence of the leadership.

Holmes, not yet an MP, supported Simon Hughes in the leadership election following Paddy Ashdown&#x27;s retirement in 1999. At the 2005 party conference, he voted against plans by the leadership to support capping the European Union budget at 1% of GDP and to privatise the post office (and was on the winning side in both votes). However, he publicly declared himself to be in full support of Kennedy&#x27;s leadership following rumours that Hughes was planning a leadership challenge. In the leadership election caused by the resignation of Charles Kennedy, Paul Holmes took on the role of chair to Simon Hughes&#x27; leadership campaign

Holmes was a member of the House of Commons Education &amp; Skills Select Committee from 2001–2007, but stood down from the Committee in July 2007 to concentrate on his appointment as Shadow Minister for Housing. Previously Holmes had been a Spokesman on Disability (2001–2005), Work and Pensions (2002–2005) and Arts and Heritage (2006–2007). In December 2007 he returned to the back benches, being one of only two MPs in the party to lose their shadow cabinet responsibilities in the reshuffle following Nick Clegg&#x27;s election as Liberal Democrat leader.

Holmes hit the headlines in March 2008 when he was the only Liberal Democrat MP to sign an Early Day Motion praising Fidel Castro at the time of his resignation. He was quoted on the BBC as saying &quot;It is true Cuba has political prisoners and no free elections, but it has very good dentistry.&quot;

Holmes was the Liberal Democrat Shadow Minister for Justice and sat on the Children, Families and Schools Select Committee.

Holmes is a founding member of the centre-left Beveridge Group within the Liberal Democrats. He is also an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK, and was also a vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Humanist Group, before his defeat in the 2010 general election.

==Personal life==
In 1978 he married Raelene Palmer. His children were born and brought up in Chesterfield.

<doc id="1114225" wikidata="Q2634717" url="?curid=1114225" title="Battle of Bazentin Ridge">
<text>The Battle of Bazentin Ridge was part of the Battle of the Somme on the Western Front in France, during the First World War. On 14 July, the British Fourth Army (General Henry Rawlinson) made a dawn attack against the German 2nd Army (General Fritz von Below) in the Brown Position (), from Delville Wood westwards to Bazentin le Petit Wood.

Dismissed beforehand by a French commander as &quot;an attack organized for amateurs by amateurs&quot;, the British succeeded. Attempts to use the opportunity to capture High Wood failed, due to the German success in holding on to the north end of Longueval and parts of Delville Wood, from which attacks on High Wood could be engaged from the flank. The British cavalry, intended to provide a faster-moving exploitation force, was badly delayed by the devastated ground, shell-holes and derelict trenches.

In the afternoon, infantry of the British 7th Division attacked High Wood, when an earlier advance could have occupied the wood unopposed. The British found German troops in parts of the wood and in the Switch Line along the ridge, which cut through the north-east part of the wood. British cavalry eventually attacked east of the wood and overran German infantry hiding in standing crops, inflicting about for a loss of eight troopers.

The cavalry attack was supported by an artillery-observation aircraft, whose crew saw the Germans in the crops and fired at them with their Lewis guns. The British struggled to exploit the success and the 2nd Army recovered, leading to another period of attritional line straightening attacks and German counter-attacks before the British and French could resume general attacks in mid-September.
== Background ==
===Strategic developments===
By mid-June, the certainty of an Anglo-French attack on the Somme against the 2nd Army ( Fritz von Below), had led General Erich von Falkenhayn, the Chief of the (German General Staff), to send four divisions and artillery reinforcements from the (OHL, Supreme Army Command) reserve, enough to contain the British offensive. The 2nd Army had plenty of time to construct a defence in depth and was better prepared than at any time since trench warfare had begun to receive an attack by the British and the French. On 15 June, Falkenhayn had informed the 6th Army ( Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria) that the main Entente attack would be against the 2nd Army, with a limited attack near Lens on the 6th Army, which had a shorter line to hold, with divisions, plenty of heavy artillery and with three divisions of the OHL reserve close by.

Maintaining the strength of the 6th Army at the expense of the 2nd Army on the Somme was to conserve the means for a counter-offensive north of the Somme front, once the British offensive had been shattered by the 2nd Army. A German attack on Fleury at Verdun from 22 to 23 June succeeded and on 24 June, the Verdun offensive was limited, to conserve manpower and ammunition for the coming Entente offensive, except for preparations to attack on Fort Souville in July, to gain control of the heights overlooking Verdun. The fort was the last significant French position on the east bank of the Meuse, the final objective of the offensive that had begun in February 1916, which had been intended to last only a few weeks.

The power of the Anglo-French offensive on the Somme surprised the Germans, despite the costly failure of the British attack on 1 July, north of the Albert–Bapaume road. The extent of Entente artillery-fire caused many casualties and much of the 2nd Army artillery, vital to the defensive system, had been lost. The policy of meeting any Anglo-French success with an immediate counter-attack was also costly and in the first ten days, the Germans suffered against in the first ten days at Verdun. After a lull on the Eastern Front, the Russians had resumed the Brusilov Offensive in June and forced Falkenhayn to reorganise the Eastern front, send German divisions to bolster the Austro-Hungarians and make limited counter-attacks which had little effect. In late June and early July the Russians inflicted more defeats and on 2 July attacked the German sector of the Eastern Front at Baranovitchi on 2 July.

On 2 July, seven divisions had been sent from OHL reserve and the 6th Army to the 2nd Army; another seven were en route by 9 July. On 7 July, Falkenhayn abandoned the plan for a counter-offensive by the 6th Army for lack of manpower. After the failure of the attack on Fort Souville at Verdun on 12 July, Falkenhayn ordered a &quot;strict defensive&quot; and the transfer of more troops and artillery to the Somme, the first visible strategic effect of the Anglo-French offensive. Falkenhayn adopted a strategy of defeating the offensive on the Somme to show the French that the German army could not be beaten and that a negotiated peace was inevitable. German casualties were so high that by mid-July Falkenhayn had sent the best divisions remaining in the 6th Army to the Somme, reduced the OHL reserve to one division and begun reducing the size of the divisions in the (Western Army), to allow complete divisions to be transferred to the Somme; the Entente had seized the initiative on the Western Front.

===Tactical developments===

On 1 July, the French Sixth Army and the right wing of the British Fourth Army had inflicted a considerable defeat on the German 2nd Army. From the Albert–Bapaume road north to Gommecourt, the Fourth Army attack had been a disaster, where most of the casualties were suffered. Against the wishes of Marshal Joseph Joffre, General Sir Douglas Haig abandoned the offensive north of the road to reinforce the success in the south. During the Battle of Albert the Fourth Army pressed forward south of the road, through several intermediate defensive lines, towards the German second position. The attacks were hampered by supply routes becoming quagmires during rainy periods (lengthening the time for round trips), behind the French XX Corps ( Maurice Balfourier) and the British XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Walter Congreve), XV Corps (Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Horne) and III Corps (Lieutenant-General William Pulteney).

South of the Albert–Bapaume road, La Boisselle was captured on 4 July, Bernafay and Caterpillar woods were occupied from 3 to 4 July and fighting for Trônes Wood, Mametz Wood and Contalmaison took place until early on 14 July. The Germans opposite the Fourth Army were kept disorganised and the British closed to within striking distance of the German second position, a significant but costly victory. The Fourth Army attacks were not co-ordinated, tactically crude, wasteful of manpower and gave the Germans an opportunity to concentrate their inferior resources on narrow fronts, multiplying their effect. The loss of casualties on 1 July was not repeated. From 2 to 13 July, the British attacked and suffered a change in the &quot;rate&quot; of loss from per day. Around 14 July, Émile Fayolle wrote that the French had taken and the British and but that the British had &quot;in the ground&quot; (sic) and were still short of the German second position.

The strain imposed by the Entente attacks after 1 July, led Below to issue an order of the day (2nd Army Order &quot;I a 575 secret&quot;) on 3 July, forbidding voluntary withdrawals,

after Falkenhayn sacked the Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army, Paul Grünert and Günther von Pannewitz the XVII Corps commander, after Grünert had allowed Pannewitz to withdraw to the third position south of the Somme to shorten the corps front; Grünert was replaced by Colonel Fritz von Loßberg. First-class German reinforcements reaching the Somme front were thrown into the battle piecemeal, which caused them higher casualties. German attacks were poorly organised, insufficient time was allowed for reconnaissance and the infantry was inadequately supported by the artillery, which sometimes fired on German troops. German counter-attacks were even less well-organised than their British equivalents and most failed.

== Prelude ==
===German preparations===
The Germans defending the (second position), which had few deep dugouts, suffered many casualties on 7 July. British artillery was directed by artillery-observation aircraft and a battalion of Reserve Infantry Regiment 122 (RIR 122) suffered British artillery-fire cut communications and the XIV Reserve Corps ( Hermann von Stein) lost touch with the front line, not knowing if it still existed from Contalmaison to Pozières. A counter-attack by RIR 122 and Infantry Regiment 183 (IR 183) was postponed and lack of information led to the attack being cancelled next day. The commander of the 185th Division, which contained a motley of units from four divisions, was put in charge of the line from the south of Mametz Wood to Ovillers, to fill the gap from Contalmaison to Pozières by dawn on 9 July. I Battalion, RIR 122 relieved I Battalion, Regiment, which had suffered in Contalmaison from the constant British artillery-fire, its troops having had to lie in mud, among the sick, wounded and dead. The battalions in the area received about each as reinforcements and RIR 77 arrived from the 2nd Guard Reserve Division. The IV Corps (General Friedrich Sixt von Armin) with the 7th Division (Major-General Friedrich von Bernhardi) and 8th Division (Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg) was en route for the Somme.

From 6 to 13 July, artillery batteries, three artillery flights, two reconnaissance flights and a bombing flight of (Imperial German Air Service) arrived and Below asked for more machine-gun units, on which the defence was being based. On 12 July, Falkenhayn ordered the 5th Army at Verdun to assume a &quot;strict defensive&quot;, ordered artillery to the Somme and urged Below to hold on to the area of Hardecourt to Trônes Wood, to counter French or British attacks from the flank, if it became possible to deliver an organised counter-attack. Below wanted to attack south of the Somme, where artillery-fire could be concentrated but needed five fresh divisions, which did not exist and next day all counter-attacks were cancelled. Such confusion had been created by the arrival of units milked from divisions beyond the Somme, that the battlefield was divided into permanent corps areas, the corps headquarters, heavy artillery and supply services to remain as a permanent administrative organisation. Brigades and divisions were to be transferred in and out, with the group maintaining the command arrangements and continuity of policy. On 13 July, the 2nd Army created (the HQ of the (VI Reserve Corps)) from the Somme to Hardecourt, (IV Corps), Hardecourt to Pozières and (XIV Reserve Corps) from Pozières across the Ancre to Gommecourt.

===British plan===
Before the Fourth Army had captured Trônes Wood, Mametz Wood and Contalmaison, Rawlinson issued a warning order for an attack on the German second position; engineers and pioneers began to clear roads and fill in derelict trenches. Guns and ammunition were moved forward and the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) photographed the German second and third positions. With the corps commanders and artillery commanders, Rawlinson decided that the attack should begin at dawn, when there would be insufficient light for German machine-gunners to see far ahead. XIII Corps was to attack with two divisions from Longueval to Bazentin-le-Grand, after forming up in no man&#x27;s land, short of the German trenches. XV Corps was to attack from the north edge of Mametz Wood, on a front from Bazentin le Grand wood to Bazentin le Petit village and its cemetery, where no man&#x27;s land was much narrower. The 1st Division of III Corps was to attack further west as a flank guard.

The XIII Corps infantry on the right would have to cross up to of no man&#x27;s land in the dark and assemble close to the (second position), the front line since the Entente advances after 1 July. If the Germans detected the move across no man&#x27;s land, the attack could be a disaster but Rawlinson and the corps commanders felt that the risk was warranted. Night attacks had already been tried and one by the 12th (Eastern) Division on the night of had failed, after German machine-gunners saw the infantry, who were then stopped by uncut wire. Haig was dubious about the scheme, because the British infantry were not trained or disciplined enough and because staff officers were too inexperienced to organise a night move, assembly and attack. Haig wanted XV Corps to attack first from Mametz Wood, where no man&#x27;s land was much narrower. The right flank would take the spur near Marlboro&#x27; Wood, with III Corps guarding the left flank, by an advance of the 1st Division up Pearl Alley, to capture Contalmaison Villa. XV Corps could then face east and XIII Corps would attack from the south at dawn, towards Waterlot Farm, Longueval and Bazentin le Grand.

On 11 July, Rawlinson met again with the corps and divisional commanders, who wanted the original plan reinstated. Haig compromised with a scheme in which XV Corps, with reinforcements, would still attack first but XIII Corps would dig positions on the south slopes of the ridge from Longueval to Bazentin and send patrols forward, ready to attack, if it were feasible, to assist the XV Corps attack against both Bazentin woods and Bazentin le Petit. XV Corps would wheel east, to roll up the defences opposite XIII Corps which would then attack. Rawlinson contacted Haig again on 12 July and his Major-General General Staff (MGGS) Archibald Montgomery, contacted Launcelot Kiggell the BEF Chief of the General Staff, to make a final appeal. Haig gave way, provided that the supporting points were built by XIII Corps and the flanks were protected by garrisons in Mametz and Trônes woods. Most of Mametz Wood had already been captured and the fight for Trônes Wood continued. Haig was also reassured by Major-General Noel Birch the BEF MGRA (Major-General Royal Artillery) that the bombardment was succeeding, that German underground shelters in the second position would be shallower than those overrun on 1 July, that the British had gained artillery superiority and that a dawn attack would mean plenty of time for exploitation.

The 9th (Scottish) Division (Major-General William Furse) and the 3rd Division (Major-General Aylmer Haldane) in XIII Corps were to attack on a line from the north-west corner of Bernafay Wood to Marlboro&#x27; Wood and needed to advance to a line from Delville Wood to Longueval and Bazentin le Grand in the dark, to close up to the German front line. From Marlboro&#x27; Wood to the north side of Mametz Wood, the 7th Division (Major-General Herbert Watts) and 21st Division (Major-General David Campbell) of XV Corps, faced no man&#x27;s land which was wide south of Bazentin le Grand Wood, Bazentin le Petit Wood, village and the cemetery east. The advance would be uphill except beyond Mametz Wood, where the ground was flat. The 18th (Eastern) Division (Major-General Ivor Maxse) was to set up a defensive flank on the east face of Trônes Wood, between the 9th (Scottish) Division and the French 153rd Division, which would support the 18th (Eastern) Division with artillery if necessary. On the left flank, the 1st Division was to form another defensive flank in the Pearl Alley communication trench and capture Contalmaison Villa, to link with the 21st Division at Bazentin le Petit Wood. (At on 13 July, the 1st Division attacked with the 1st Black Watch and captured Lower Wood, north of the top left of Mametz Wood and Contalmaison Villa at on 14 July.

The 18th (Eastern) Division at Trônes Wood diverted German attention on the east flank and it had been assumed that the French XX Corps would participate in the attack south of Guillemont. The failure of French attacks from 7 to 8 July, led General Ferdinand Foch, () to order Fayolle to wait on the British attack () and only artillery support was made available. Three cavalry divisions were to be ready by to exploit success, the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division (Major-General Henry Macandrew) by capturing High Wood north-west of Longueval, the 1st Cavalry Division (Major-General Cecil Bingham) Leuze Wood, beyond Guillemont and the 3rd Cavalry Division (Major-General John Vaughan) to capture Martinpuich. The 2nd Indian Cavalry Division was placed under the command of XIII Corps and the other two divisions remained under the Fourth Army HQ, for Rawlinson to decide when they were to attack, according to reports from the corps and from air reconnaissance.

===Offensive preparations===
A preliminary bombardment began on 11 July, with counter-battery fire and shelling of the attack front. The fire of the three corps continued at night on villages and woods further back and approach routes from them to the front line, especially Waterlot Farm, Flers, High Wood, Martinpuich, Le Sars and Bapaume. A shortage of heavy artillery ammunition and transport difficulties over wet and cut up ground, led to a ration of and shells per day, for two days. The field artillery was moved forward to the south side of Montauban Ridge and was dumped per field gun. Anglo-French air supremacy made it impossible for the German air units to reconnoitre behind the British lines and the supply of ammunition continued round the clock, easing the effect of rain, which extended wagon journeys to round trips. Late on 11 June, Horne reported that the wire-cutting would take until 14 July and Rawlinson set that day for the attack, allotting more ammunition for the extra day&#x27;s bombardment.

Few German shells fell on British field artillery positions, most of which were in the open and dumps of stores were left in Caterpillar Valley at night, covered by a line of outposts and left during the day without protection. The lack of German air observation, made the dumps secure and artillery inferiority led the Germans to reserve most of their artillery-fire to the moments just before an attack and firing defensive barrages. The attacking divisions continued their preparations on the assumption that the original plan would be agreed and Rawlinson considered that the plans of the 9th (Scottish) and 3rd divisions for the night approach were satisfactory. For surprise, the infantry were to be preceded by only a five-minute hurricane bombardment from all the XIII and XV corps guns, rather than the usual thirty-minute bombardment, to which the Germans had become accustomed. To avoid premature shell-bursts in the creeping barrage caused by trees and buildings, only delay fuzed, high-explosive shell was to be fired from the 18-pounder field guns and the 4.5-inch and medium howitzers.

====Trônes Wood====

British attacks on Trônes Wood had begun on 8 July and counter-attacks and attacks continued inconclusively. Just after midnight on the 54th Brigade assembled for another night attack, with no time for reconnaissance. The advance was to be from south to north and the two nearest battalions were chosen. At the leading battalion crossed of open ground through a barrage in artillery formation to the south-west of the wood. A redoubt in Central Trench was enveloped and rushed at then the advance reached the eastern edge, which was mistaken for the north end of the wood. A defensive flank was formed from the railway line south to the strong point at Trônes Alley.

The second battalion entered the wood at finding parties from many units in the south-east corner and searches to the north found little sign of the first battalion. A company attacked the strong point, with another attack by the troops in Maltz Horn Trench. Direction was maintained by compass and frequent halts, the troops firing into the undergrowth as they advanced. The south end of Central Trench was rolled up and the British reached the real north end at German troops pushed north, tried to retreat to Guillemont and suffered many casualties, to small-arms fire from the defensive flank. Consolidation began by linking a line of shell-holes beyond the eastern fringe of the wood.

====Night assembly====

Six brigades with and supporting troops, had to assemble closer than to the Germans, at night, without being noticed. On 13 July, the British discovered that the Germans were eavesdropping on the field telephones of the 62nd Brigade (Brigadier-General George Gater); as a ruse, a call was made that operations had been postponed. In the 9th (Scottish) Division area, the 26th Brigade (Brigadier-General A. B. Ritchie) and the 27th Brigade (Brigadier-General S. W. Scrase-Dickens) were to lead the attack, with the 1st South African Brigade (Brigadier-General H. T. Lukin) in reserve. The 26th Brigade was to assemble on the north slope of Caterpillar Valley, with the left flank on the Montauban–Longueval road, covered by machine-gun posts on the right. The two attacking battalions were to be screened from the German lines, on the crest of a ridge south of Longueval, by four platoons with Lewis guns. The screening force went forward on the night of to a line of shell-holes made for them by 6-inch howitzers. The screening platoons were followed by three officers and from each battalion, to the parallel Bernafay Wood–Longueval and the Montauban–Longueval roads, which were the left flank positions of the battalions.

Each battalion was to form up in columns of two companies and each company in column of platoons, in single rank at intervals, to make eight infantry lines. The markers stopped in threes apart and two then moved right at two tapes in succession to mark the front of the platoon waves. The battalions moved forward by companies, in single-file, over the road running south of Bernafay Wood to Montauban at and up the roads to the left markers; the platoons arrived and turned right along the tape. A section of the 26th Mortar Battery and sections of the 26th Machine Gun Company followed each battalion and the 26th Brigade assembly was complete by Two machine-gun sections stayed with the support battalion in Montauban Alley and the rest of the guns and mortars waited with the reserve battalion, south of Montauban. There was unusually little German artillery-fire on Caterpillar Valley and the brigade lost seven casualties.

There were no roads for the 27th Brigade to use so the 76th Brigade plan was adopted. A platoon covering force went forward at and an engineer tape long was used as a line, laid on a compass bearing by a party of Royal Engineers, the end being short of the German front line, which took Tapes were laid at right angles, checked and then the markers went forward. The brigade passed the west end of Montauban in column and formed up at near end of the tape in Caterpillar Valley. The two attacking battalions went first with the companies in line, in column of platoons in one rank, the support battalion behind with a field engineer company and pioneer company on either side. At the first battalion moved off followed by the second at and then both formed platoons in open column at spaces, to form the eight infantry lines, with trench mortars, machine-guns and carrying parties to the rear, suffering five casualties during the deployment.

In XV Corps, the 3rd Division had put out an outpost line for several nights along a sunken road, parallel to and from the German front line, beyond the British front line. The division patrolled vigorously, dominating no man&#x27;s land but could not prevent the Germans working on the wire, which was in long grass and difficult to see. On the nights of three communication trenches were dug forward into Caterpillar Valley; a derelict trench about from the German line was repaired and deepened behind a piquet established at on the night of The 8th Brigade (Brigadier-General E. G. Williams) and the 9th Brigade (Brigadier-General H. C. Potter) deployed in lines of platoons, also using a long tape. The leading battalions moved up to the sunken road at and were ready at the first wave beyond the road, machine-guns, mortars, engineers and pioneers in support and reserve, with only one casualty; earlier, three German deserters had disclosed that no attack was expected.

The 7th Division was brought back after only five days&#x27; rest, with no time to assimilate large numbers of replacements. In the afternoon of 13 July, a battalion of the 20th Brigade (Brigadier-General Cyril Deverell) moved forward under local initiative and captured the Hammerhead early. Outposts went forward at and the two attacking battalions were led forward in single-file, up communication trenches and over ground strewn with wire and abandoned trenches, through two infantry companies, which then drew back into reserve. The jumping-off line was a bank with low trees marked by tape, with a bush on the right flank and Flat Iron Copse on the left, from the German line and closer to a salient called The Snout, which had been bombarded by heavy trench mortars and appeared empty. Stokes mortars went forward but machine-guns were to wait until they could go straight through to the furthest objective. The brigade was ready by telephones still worked and few casualties had been suffered.

The 22nd Brigade (Brigadier-General J. McC. Steele) assembled in Mametz Wood, the right-hand battalion with an extra company and a Stokes mortar, making its way up the right side of the wood. The left-hand battalion and the support battalion used the bed of a light railway and the 110th Machine-Gun Company moved out to cover the left flank. By the assembly into four lines along tapes was complete but the right hand battalion could only hide one line and the left-hand battalion three lines in Mametz Wood, because of fallen trees and debris. The six brigades had managed to assemble short of the German line with a trifling number of casualties, the covering parties encountering no small-arms fire, flares or patrols. The troops began to creep forward, the 8th Brigade at at per minute, closing to by The 9th Brigade was only short when the hurricane bombardment began; the other brigades waited for the bombardment and then crawled forward as far as possible.

== Battle ==

===Reserve Army===
During the night of the Reserve Army (Lieutenant-General Hubert Gough) divisions of X Corps (Lieutenant-General Thomas Morland), either side of the Albert–Bapaume road, continued attacks at Ovillers. The 3rd Worcestershire, 7th Brigade, 25th Division moved up a trench across the road to try to close in from the north-east. From the south-east, the 10th Cheshire (7th Brigade) was repulsed but the 8th Border (75th Brigade) on the left managed a small advance and the 1st Dorset (14th Brigade 32nd Division) also managed to get forward on the west side. To the north-west, battalions of the 96th and 97th brigades of the division, attacked with hand-grenades and took a small amount of ground and the 49th (West Riding) Division, attacked at the &quot;Leipzig&quot; Salient. At just before the Fourth Army attacked, the 4th Division and the 48th (South Midland) Division, in VIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Aylmer Hunter-Weston) north of the Ancre, made a smoke-screen and fired a bombardment beyond the 4th Division front, from as a diversion and succeeded in simulating an attack.

From the positions occupied during the day, an advance from the left side of Bazentin le Petit Wood, along the second position trenches towards Pozières, offered the possibility of an attack from three sides. The 10th Cheshire tried a daylight attack on Ovillers but was repulsed by machine-gun fire and the 1/7th Royal Warwick (48th (South Midland) Division), tried to exploit the success of the 3rd Worcester but failed. The Cheshire attacked again at and captured the objective but casualties were so great that they had to withdraw. At on 15 July, the 25th Division attacked Ovillers again, this time from the north-east, east and south, with the 32nd Division attacking from the south-west but the garrison repulsed the attack. German attacks on the &quot;Leipzig&quot; Salient were defeated and during the night, the 32nd Division was relieved by 144th Brigade of the 48th (South Midland) Division. At on 16 July, the 143rd Brigade (under the command of the 25th Division) attacked from the north-east, the 74th Brigade of the 25th Division and the 144th Brigade attacked from the east and south. During the evening the last Germans in the village surrendered and of II Battalion, RIR 15 and the Guard Fusilier Regiment were taken prisoner. The 145th Brigade, 48th (South Midland) Division took over and another of trench was captured on 17 July.

===Fourth Army===

====14 July====
At the sky lit up behind the attacking divisions and a hurricane bombardment, supplemented by machine-guns firing on fixed lines, fell on the German positions. At the leading British infantry stood up and moved forwards through a mist, with just enough light to recognise German troops. The German infantry were surprised by the intensity and brevity of the bombardment and the rapid onset of the British infantry behind a creeping barrage of high-explosive shells. The II Battalion, Bavarian Infantry Regiment 16 in Longueval had been alerted and sent out four patrols; one disappeared, one ran into a British patrol and two returned with nothing to report. The first wave reached the German wire without a shot and passed over the front line, some of the following waves becoming engaged by Germans who emerged from underground shelters. A German counter-barrage began and fell into Caterpillar Valley, well behind the infantry.

On the right flank, the 26th and 27th brigades got across two belts of barbed wire, cutting by hand in places but the 10th Argyll were held up until the left flank company broke through and rolled up the German defenders. All four battalions crossed two trench lines, except for a short delay at the south end of Longueval, where the Germans were also rolled up from the flank. The infantry kept going and the support battalions arrived to consolidate. The Germans in Longueval made a determined defence but by the 9th Scottish Rifles had taken their objectives, except the north end and a strong point in the south-east of the village, which resisted until attacked with support from the 7th Seaforth and the 5th Cameron Highlanders at It proved impossible to capture Waterlot Farm in the second position so positions were taken in Longueval Alley, in touch with the 18th (Eastern) Division. At the 9th (Scottish) Division HQ was erroneously informed that the village had been captured but by then the captured part of the village had been consolidated; a source of water was found before the Germans could counter-attack.

On the 3rd Division front, the 8th Brigade found much uncut wire in the first belt and the second untouched. A company broke through on the left and bombed down the German front trench and the troops held up cut their way through or climbed over the wire to rush the trenches. On the 9th Brigade front on the left, the wire was on a forward slope and had been well cut. The British rushed the German trenches, where a sentry of I Battalion, Bavarian Regiment 16 had spotted the British at and alerted the battalion. The troops breasted the ridge through machine-gun fire from Bazentin le Grand, captured the trenches and brought up trench mortars against the village; the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers passed through and captured the village. In the 7th Division area, the 20th Brigade captured the German trenches as soon as the bombardment lifted, finding the wire and trenches destroyed and the Germans in The Snout dead. The troops moved towards the second line and rushed it when the barrage lifted at German troops retreating towards High Wood were shot down with small-arms fire.

The 20th Brigade waited for the barrage to lift off Bazentin le Grand Wood at which was quickly captured and a defensive line established beyond. Consolidation began as the 22nd Brigade passed through and continued the attack with the 2nd Royal Warwick, which covered the 2nd Royal Irish advance on the southern edge of Bazentin le Petit at At the Irish captured the village with help from the 6th Leicester on the left, taking prisoner the HQ staff and over of Bavarian Infantry Regiment 16. An hour later, a German counter-attack recovered the north end of the village except for the cemetery to the east. Another attack by the Irish and the 2nd Gordon Highlanders, recaptured the village; the troops dug in and defeated more counter-attacks.

The first battalions of the 110th Brigade of the 21st Division got into the German trenches quickly except for one point on the left, where German machine-gunners held out for twenty minutes, until enveloped from both flanks. The second line was captured by and contact made with the 1st Division on the left. The infantry pushed on into Bazentin le Petit Wood with little opposition, except at the north-west corner, where a German party held out all day. A defensive flank was formed facing east to stop the Germans opposite the 7th Division retreating to the west. At about one battalion advanced into Bazentin le Petit and linked with the 2nd Royal Irish and handed over the village, before digging in from the north end of the village to the north-east of the wood. When a German counter-attack pushed back the Royal Irish, the 100th Brigade troops fell back temporarily into the wood. The 7th Division field artillery moved forward and engineers began work to repair tracks across Caterpillar Valley. The Fourth Army had advanced onto the Ginchy–Pozières Ridge and captured 1,442 prisoners, including two regimental headquarters. Many German corpses could be seen but poor musketry had enabled German troops to escape, the British troops lacking the training to hit soldiers beyond .
Fighting went on in Longueval and Delville Wood under German bombardment and the 26th and 27th brigades of the 9th (Scottish) Division had many casualties. Conflicting reports about the capture of Longueval arrived at XIII Corps headquarters and at it became clear that only the south end of the village had been occupied and the 1st South African Regiment was moved up from reserve. The attack at Longueval and Delville Wood had lacked sufficient power to capture all of the wood and village, where II Battalion, BIR 16 was reinforced by II Battalion, IR 26 of the 7th Division and a battalion of RIR 99 during the day. The relative success of the defenders inhibited the British from ordering a bolder exploitation further west. Opposite the 7th and part of the 3rd Division the Germans were found to have disappeared by and some British officers walked up to High Wood unchallenged. Watts suggested sending the 91st Brigade from reserve to occupy the wood but was ordered to wait for the cavalry and Haldane was told to keep his reserve brigade ready to receive counter-attacks.

At Horne ordered the 7th Division to relieve the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division at High Wood as soon as they had captured it and the 21st Division to advance north to capture the ground from Bazentin le Petit to the Martinpuich light railway, to assist the III Corps attack between the 21st division and Black Watch Alley. The 21st Division and 1st Division were to attack at and the 34th Division was to patrol towards Pozières. The cavalry had been ordered forward from Moralncourt at but found the going very difficult, the ground being wet and cut with trenches and shell-holes. The Secunderabad Cavalry Brigade took until the afternoon to reach Montauban and at Rawlinson ordered the 7th Division to capture High Wood. Horne countermanded the order because of the situation at Longueval and the XIII Corps held back the cavalry, apart from patrols. The attack of the 21st and 1st divisions also proved abortive because of the German party in the north-west corner of Bazentin le Petit Wood and increasing German artillery-fire. A German counter-attack at reduced the infantry of the 62nd Brigade to and made the rest of the 21st Division incapable of attacking.

====High Wood====
Observers saw many German troops retiring from Pozières and the British artillery was ordered to cease fire at for patrols to check and south of the village the parties were driven back. The 21st Division continued the attack on the north-west corner of Bazentin le Petit Wood but when the post fell at the Germans fell back to a machine-gun post only away. More false reports of success at Longueval arrived in the afternoon and the 7th Division was ordered to High Wood at Long delays in passing the orders led to the first two battalions of the 91st Brigade taking until to reach the jumping-off point. The 20th Deccan Horse and 7th Dragoon Guards were ready on the right flank but the 33rd Division (Major-General Herman Landon) from reserve had not arrived on the left.

A 3 Squadron crew saw the infantry and cavalry advance and the pilot dived on troops of III Battalion, IR 26 seen in standing crops, strafing them from a height of . The observer dropped a sketch to the cavalry before departing riddled by ground fire. About were killed or taken prisoner in the cornfields, eight cavalrymen were killed, about wounded and were killed or wounded. Reinforcements of the 3rd Guard Division were caught by British machine-gun fire as they moved towards Bazentin le Petit and machine-gunners in Longueval were silenced by the cavalry machine-guns. German heavy artillery had been withdrawn and field artillery was unable to take aim at such a fast-moving target. The Germans fired two machine-guns at the cavalry which broke through between II Battalion and III Battalion IR 26 and got behind the 10th Company above Bazentin le Grand.

The two infantry battalions crossed the to High Wood, with a short delay on the left, due to German machine-gun fire but the battalions entered the wood and found few Germans. Undergrowth slowed their progress and the north end of the wood, protected by the new Switch Line and the west side could not be captured, the troops digging in across the middle and the east edge, helped by engineers to consolidate, despite several counter-attacks. The rest of the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division was sent back and the 1st and 3rd Cavalry divisions never left their bivouacs at Buire-sur-l&#x27;Ancre and Daours. The 33rd Division failed to receive the orders to support the 7th Division, only having orders for an attack through the 21st Division on 15 July. By chance, the commander of the 100th Brigade found out and sent two battalions to cover a gap between High Wood and Bazentin le Petit. A lull came over the battlefield as night fell, except in Longueval, where the South Africans continued to attack against German machine-gun fire.

====15 July====
On the right flank of the salient driven into the German second position, Delville Wood and the north end of Longueval gave a covered approach for German troops attacking from Flers and made attacks from the British line south of Waterlot Farm vulnerable to enfilade fire. At dawn the farm was attacked by one company, later reinforced by two 4th South African Regiment companies, which eventually captured the farm but German artillery-fire prevented consolidation until 17 July. Furse ordered another attack on Longueval by the 27th Brigade and the 1st South African Regiment, after an artillery and Stokes mortar bombardment. A battalion bombed its way up North Street at and another party tried to move through orchards on the west side but German reinforcements counter-attacked and recaptured the lost ground; another attack failed at The South African Brigade was ordered to capture Delville Wood and moved up from reserve before dawn but by then, half the brigade had been detached. The brigade attacked at from the south-west corner of the wood on a battalion front, with the 2nd Battalion forward, the 3rd Battalion in support and the 4th Battalion in reserve.

The attack was almost unopposed and by the South Africans had captured the wood south of Prince&#x27;s Street, despite the wreckage of fallen and uprooted trees. Tanner sent two companies to secure the northern perimeter of the wood and later, the 3rd Battalion advanced to the east and north-east. By the wood was occupied, except for a German strong point in the north-western corner, adjoining Longueval. The South Africans began to dig in around the fringe of the wood in groups, forming strong points, supported by machine-guns, in a salient, in touch with the 26th Brigade only along the south-western edge of the wood next to Longueval. The troops had spades but roots and remnants of tree trunks made it possible only to dig shallow shell scrapes before German troops counter-attacked. A battalion of the 24th Reserve Division counter-attacked from the south-east at having been given five minutes&#x27; notice and managed to advance to within of the wood, before being forced to dig in. A second battalion attacked from the Ginchy–Flers road was also repulsed, the battalions losing In the early afternoon, a battalion of the 8th Division attacked the north-eastern face of the wood and was also repulsed, after losing all its officers.

At Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 6 (BRIR 6) of the 10th Bavarian Division, attacked from the east and part was repulsed by small-arms fire. At Tanner reported to Lukin that German forces were massing to the north of the wood and he called for reinforcements, as the South Africans had already lost a company from the 2nd (Natal and Free State) Battalion. Tanner had received a company of the 4th (Scottish) Battalion from Longueval and Lukin sent a second company forward to reinforce the 3rd (Transvaal &amp; Rhodesia) Battalion. Lukin urged Tanner and the battalion commanders to dig in regardless of fatigue, as heavy artillery fire was expected during the night or early the next morning. As night fell, German high explosive and gas shelling increased and a counter-attack by three battalions from the 8th and 12th Reserve divisions began at midnight. With orders to recapture the wood &quot;at all costs&quot;, the Germans got within , before being driven under cover by artillery and machine-gun fire.

At on 15 July, the 91st Brigade, 7th Division attacked High Wood but was stopped by machine-gun fire from the Switch Line, where it ran through the wood. After a bombardment by German artillery, II Battalion, IR 165 of the German 7th Division and III Battalion, IR 72 of the German 8th Division, which had relieved the 183rd Division, counter-attacked at and recaptured part of the wood, until driven out by the 91st Brigade reserve. At the British attacked after a bombardment had inflicted many casualties on the German infantry but failed to overwhelm the survivors. High Wood was not visible to British ground observers and at a 3 Squadron reconnaissance aircraft reported that British troops were in the west of the wood and south of the Bazentin-le-Petit road. Flags were seen in the west side of the wood but the east side was full of Germans and the Switch Trench was packed with German infantry.

High Wood was judged to be untenable and at the 91st Brigade was withdrawn and the wood was bombarded by the divisional artillery. The 1/9th Highland Light Infantry, 33rd Division had also attacked the wood at during an attack on the Switch Line, when three platoons advanced on the west side of the wood. Machine-gun fire from the II and III battalions, IR 93 in High Wood, hit the attackers from the flank and the attack was repulsed. The 16th Battalion, King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps and the 2nd Worcester were sent forward as reinforcements but were back on the start line by Two German infantry companies worked southwards from the Switch Line for later in the evening but another counter-attack was impossible, due to the tremendous volume of British barrage fire and the presence of British reconnaissance and artillery-observation aircraft.

To the left of the 7th Division, the 33rd Division attacked the Switch Line near Martinpuich, while III Corps attacked Pozières but co-operation proved impossible. The Switch Line was attacked at by two battalions and another attack was made on the west side of High Wood. German machine-gunners caught the battalions in enfilade and despite reinforcement by the other two battalions of the 100th Brigade, the attack failed and the survivors were back on the start-line by The 98th Brigade attacked on the left from Bazentin le Petit village on a front encountered machine-gun crossfire and an artillery bombardment, the attack becoming a costly failure, which was also abandoned from The 1st Division had taken over from the 21st Division along the west edge of Bazentin le Petit Wood and at a battalion of the 2nd Brigade attacked towards the north-west up the trenches of the second position, taking of the front line and of the second line. At a 3rd Brigade battalion resumed the attack and after dark managed to link with the 34th Division with a line of posts.

====16 July====

Furse ordered co-ordinated attacks on the north-west of Delville Wood and the north end of Longueval after a trench mortar bombardment. At a battalion of the 27th Brigade attacked west of North Street and the 1st South African Regiment attacked from the west end of Prince&#x27;s Street (which runs through the middle of the wood) but both units were repulsed by machine-gun fire. The bombardment re-commenced but the stalemate continued. The 9th (Scottish) Division decided to postpone attacks until the heavy artillery could re-bombard the village at on 17 July but the Fourth Army headquarters demanded that the village be captured by dawn. The artillery bombardment was brought forward to when the infantry could have retired to a safe distance but German artillery-fire continued, cut all telephone lines and at German infantry counter-attacked. Sixt von Armin had ordered a similar maximum effort and two regiments of the 8th Division and a regiment of the 12th Reserve Division were thrown in without time to prepare or reconnoitre. The attackers attacked from the east, north-east and north. The Germans got close to the wood, before small-arms fire and artillery stopped the advance with many casualties. The British attack began at on 17 June.

At High Wood, the 91st Brigade experienced some confusion in the mass of undergrowth but lack of communication with the rear led XV Corps headquarters to judge the position of the brigade to be threatened and at ordered the brigade to retire overnight, artillery keeping the wood under bombardment; by the brigade had assembled behind Bazentin le Grand, having been able to remove nearly all of the wounded. II Battalion, IR 165 of the German 7th Division and III Battalion, IR 72 of the 8th Division followed up the withdrawal and re-occupied the wood, losing many casualties to the British bombardment. On the 33rd Division front further west, attempts to organise another attack on 18 July took place amidst a constant bombardment of gas and lachrymatory shell. The 21st Division was relieved by the 33rd Division at Bazentin le Petit on 15 July and the 7th Division took over of front from the 3rd Division east of Bazentin le Grand Wood.

At A battalion of the 1st Division tried to bomb along the second position but found deep mud which slowed movement and the Stokes mortars ran out of ammunition due to the difficulty in bringing up more bombs over the sodden ground. The 3rd Brigade was ordered to make a frontal attack at midnight, after the artillery of the division had spent the day wire-cutting, batteries firing from the right flank in Caterpillar Valley being particularly effective. At a ten-minute hurricane bombardment began and as it lifted, two battalions attacked to the north-east, keeping close to the creeping barrage as another battalion bombed from the right flank. The German infantry retreated, leaving many dead and wounded behind and the British advanced beyond the objective until dawn. Posts were set up along German communication trenches running north-east and a defensive flank was set up in Black Watch Alley.

====17 July====
The British artillery bombarded Delville Wood for an hour, the last two minutes being a hurricane bombardment and the infantry attacked at the 27th Brigade advancing either side of North Street and the South Africans attacking northwards from Prince&#x27;s Street and west from the Strand, a ride in the wood. The bombardment had failed to destroy the German machine-guns and despite bringing Stokes mortars into action, the attack was stopped around noon, having been costly for both sides. During the night, German artillery bombarded the village and wood with high explosive and gas shell, extending the bombardment to Montauban and the artillery in Caterpillar Valley. Congreve decided that the next attack would be made by the 3rd Division from the west, before dawn on 18 July, to capture the objectives at all costs. The 76th Brigade (Brigadier-General R. J. Kentish) was to conduct the attack. The German 8th Division was also preparing to attack Delville Wood and troops at the most advanced positions were pulled back during a bombardment which began at from about and heavy guns and howitzers of and , with guns of the 8th Division and more from the 12th Reserve Division.

===German 2nd Army===
====12–17 July====

On 12 July, I Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 91 (RIR) attacked from Bazentin Wood with the 2nd and 4th companies on an front. After a brief artillery bombardment the attack was stopped halfway to Mametz Wood by British small-arms fire, the two companies suffering many casualties. The survivors joined troops from III Battalion, Bavarian Infantry Regiment 16 (BIR 16), Infantry Regiment 184 (IR 184), two sharpshooter groups and the 8th Company, RIR 77 in the line from Bazentin Wood to Longueval. Much of the trench had been flattened by shellfire; there were only six dug outs, and no wire. Nearby, were III Battalion, IR 165, the Fusilier Guards recruit company and part of II Battalion, IR 190. Some troops of RIR 91 and BIR 16 detected signs of an attack, BIR 16 having patrols out but by 14 July, the III Battalion was down to 

The British attack came against with the 10th Bavarian Division from Guillemont to Delville Wood, Longueval and Bazentin le Grand, the 7th Division from Bazentin to Pozières and the 8th Division in reserve south of Bapaume. The British attack succeeded at several points, from which the troops worked sideways to roll up the German defenders, a tactic not used on 1 July. BIR 16 lost and the headquarters of Infantry Regiment , BIR 16, I Battalion, RIR 91 and II Battalion, BIR 16 were captured. Sixt von Armin had taken over from Longueval to the Ancre that morning, ordered troops to hold their positions. The 7th Division had been relieving the 183rd Division and part was sent to Longueval and the second line further back, along with resting units from the 185th, 17th Reserve, 26th Reserve and 3rd Guard divisions and Brigade Battalion 55 (7th &quot;Landwehr&quot; Division), the equivalent of fourteen battalions.

At Delville Wood, the II Battalion, RIR 107 of the 24th Reserve Division attacked after having been given five minutes&#x27; notice and managed to get within of the wood before artillery and machine-gun fire forced the survivors to stop and dig in. The III Battalion, RIR 107 attacked from the road between Ginchy and Flers just after was also stopped, the attackers suffering At I Battalion, IR 72 of the 8th Division attacked the north-east section of the wood, was repulsed and lost all its officers. Another attack during the night by three battalions around the wood also failed, IR 153 reporting that every attack was a costly failure, being defeated by British fire power. A systematic bombardment of the wood began to prepare an attack on 18 July.

===Air operations===
Before the attack on 14 July, the RFC watched for German road and rail activity and on 6 July, a 3 Squadron pilot bombed a troop train east of Vélu; later that morning, more trains were seen in Cambrai and Marcoing (later discovered to be the arrival of the 123rd Division from Flanders). Reconnaissance over Le Cateau and Landrecies found routine operations towards Cambrai and St Quentin. Next day, the lines from Cambrai and Bapaume to Roisel showed that troops were being rushed to the front south of the Somme and on 8 July, there was a lull in rail traffic. On 9 July, trains were seen running between Lille and Douai, implying more reinforcements from the north and on 11 July, a column of vehicles on the road to Tournai, was seen by a night reconnaissance aircraft from 20 Squadron, thought to be carrying ammunition for the 123rd Division. Aircraft and balloon observation discovered that German units from Thélus to Lens were moving to the Somme (despite rain on 12 July). RFC bombing sorties were directed against the railway stations receiving German reinforcements and on 9 July, six Morane scouts escorted six aircraft of 21 Squadron to bomb Cambrai station, obtaining three hits. Bapaume station was bombed by 27 Squadron and two British aircraft were shot down.

The German artillery south of the Albert–Bapaume road had fallen back since 1 July, increasing demands for artillery observation, methodically to locate and register new German emplacements, for counter-battery fire. In the afternoon of 9 July, German supply dumps at Le Sars and an HQ at Le Transloy were bombed by 21 Squadron and Havrincourt Wood was attacked on 11 July by and On 13 July, the RFC attacked trains on the Douai–Cambrai and Valenciennes–Cambrai lines and managed to derail a train near Aubigny-au-Bac. The front due to be attacked on 14 July and the third position beyond were photographed and studied from low altitude, despite much small-arms fire from German troops. On the day, cloud cover came down to and ground haze limited visibility to . A 9 Squadron observer reported that the 3rd Division had overrun two trench lines and was in Bazentin le Grand and the 9th (Scottish) Division had been seen preparing to attack Waterlot Farm. Other observers saw enough infantry and flares through the mist to call up the cavalry and a ruse was attempted at when an observer sent a wireless message that the British had broken through and cavalry were pursuing German troops.

At South African troops were seen running into Longueval and at were observed in the north end, the rest of the village being captured by an artillery observer saw that the 7th Division was beyond Bazentin le Petit and the division was ordered to attack High Wood, with the Secunderabad Cavalry on the right. The cavalry advanced at with the knowledge from earlier air observation, that little opposition was to be expected. A crew from 3 Squadron saw German parties hiding in crops and folds and flew low over them to divert their attention and warn the cavalry. The observer fired his Lewis gun at the Germans until the cavalry came up, then sketched the German dispositions and dropped it on the (troopers). The 7th Division flares were seen in High Wood at by a 3 Squadron observer. Next day, 9 Squadron watched German counter-attacks on Longueval and directed counter-battery fire, photographed the area and reported events. Fighter escorts from 22 Squadron found no German aircraft and attacked ground targets instead. German advances into Longueval endangered the troops in High Wood, at a 3 Squadron aircraft reconnoitred and the crew report led to the British troops being ordered out of the wood.

== Aftermath ==

===Analysis===

On 11 July, GHQ Intelligence had written that,

The OHL reserve was down to one division and that the Germans would have to begin milking divisions for reserves, which led Haig and Rawlinson to believe that attrition was working quickly. Haig thought that German resistance might break within two weeks. The inaccuracy of the intelligence being provided was not known and the assumptions and conclusions were understandable given the evidence. The success of the attack on 14 July increased British optimism, Haig describing it as &#x27;the best day we have had in this war&#x27;. Haig and Rawlinson were encouraged by the capture of two German regimental commanders and their staffs and the Fourth Army wrote that, &quot;…the enemy is in confusion and demoralised&quot;. Later information showed that the Germans had been forced into expedients, such as sending forward a recruit depot as reinforcements. During 16 July, the Fourth Army concluded that it was necessary to organise another broad front attack and that the Germans would use the respite to reinforce Delville Wood, Longueval and High Wood. Rawlinson hoped that the German could be provoked into costly counter-attacks and concentrated on preparing a new attack for 18 July, the German positions being subjected to a constant bombardment in the meantime. Attempts to arrange the next attack and co-ordinate with a French attack on the north side of the Somme foundered due to the effect of the massed bombardments on the ground, made worse by rain which turned it into deep mud, paralysing movement; the attack did not take place until the night of and was a costly failure. Three days later, the Fourth Army noted that German morale was improving, due mainly to better supply of the front line and by the end of July, British hopes of immediate success had faded.

In 1928, Henry Jones, the official historian of the RAF, wrote that the battle showed that infantry co-operation would be a permanent feature of British air operations. Recognition flares had proved effective, although there had been too few and infantry were reluctant to risk revealing their positions to German artillery observers. Scheduled illumination was a failure and infantry began to wait for a call from the contact aeroplane by signal lamp or by Klaxon. RFC observers reported that direct observation was the most effective method and that flying low enough to be fired on worked best, although this led to many aircraft being damaged and one lost to a British shell. Artillery-observation was hampered by bad weather but the rolling countryside led to constant demands for sorties for counter-battery fire; when the weather grounded the RFC, attacks could fail for lack of observation.

Aircrew photographed the attack front, reported on the condition of wire and trenches, assessed the opposition, linked headquarters and front line and then joined in by bombing and strafing from low altitude. Artillery-observation led to the neutralisation of German batteries, destruction of trenches and strong points and exploitation of fleeting opportunities to bombard German troops in the open. British aircraft caused a feeling of defencelessness among German troops and deprived them of the support of , leaving them dependent on wasteful unobserved area artillery-fire, while being vulnerable to British aircrew seeing muzzle-flashes giving away battery positions. Reinforcements of fighters were slow to arrive on the Somme and prevented from challenging Anglo-French aerial dominance. The morale of British troops was correspondingly increased because German artillery could not conduct observed shoots against them and that German troops could not move without being seen by the RFC.

In 1938, Wilfrid Miles, the official historian, wrote that it had been a mistake for the attacking divisions to be held back from exploiting the victory straight away. There appeared to be no Germans left to oppose the 7th and 3rd divisions by when several officers walked forward unopposed. Watts wanted to send the fresh 91st Brigade into High Wood but had orders to wait for the cavalry; Haldane was prevented by the Fourth army HQ from using the 76th Brigade for a pursuit, having to keep it ready for German counter-attacks. Miles wrote that authority could have been delegated to the divisional commanders on the spot, since the 33rd Division had already arrived at Montauban and a vigorous pursuit would have made the prospects for the cavalry much more favourable, when they managed to reach the front line. It may even have been possible for the infantry to penetrate High Wood and dig in on the ridge, threatening Delville Wood and Pozières, rather than the two-month slog that followed.

In a 2001 PhD thesis, Kathryn Snowden wrote that the 21st Division succeeded because of the weight and accuracy of the British bombardment enabled the night assembly to take place in safety. The German wire and trenches were destroyed and the few German survivors were relatively easily overcome. Despite the destructive effect of the artillery, Snowden wrote that it was more significant that inexperienced infantry had shown a capacity for tactical evolution. The 110th Brigade had advanced faster than the 7th Division, captured all its objectives and held them against the unexpectedly large counter-attacks that lasted from The coincidence of the German relief of the 123rd Division by the 7th Division had meant that three regiments of fresh troops (about were available. The capture of cost the highest divisional losses in the attack; more ground could have been taken had exploitation been allowed before the German counter-attacks began.

In 2005, Prior and Wilson called the attack a considerable achievement which showed that if an objective could be bombarded by enough shells, it could be captured but that this had been only the first stage in the Fourth Army plan, which had extravagant ambitions to be fulfilled by infantry and cavalry beyond the terrain devastated by the artillery. Rawlinson had realised that the advance achieved on 14 July had been possible because of the accuracy and extent of the bombardment, which had smashed the German defences, obliterated the wire and exhausted the German survivors by concussion. Prior and Wilson wrote that the British failed to study the reasons for the results not reaching expectations and that this meant that Rawlinson and Haig had not learned from their mistakes. J. P. Harris, in 2009, wrote that the Fourth Army made solid gains on 14 July, with fewer casualties than on 1 July at much greater cost to the Germans. When the cavalry finally managed to attack in the evening, it inflicted about for eight dead. In two weeks the British had advanced beyond the German second position south of the Albert–Bapaume road and faced only scanty field defences. The victory was a false dawn, because the German 2nd Army improvised defences and converted High Wood and Delville Wood into fortresses.

Piecemeal reinforcement of the German defences since 1 July had caused administrative chaos, an example being the crowding of the field kitchens of five regiments onto ground north of Courcelette, having to share the , the last open communication trench, to carry food forward at night. Below added to his secret order of 3 July,

Staff officers of the German IV Corps wrote a report on the experience of fighting the British in July, which dwelt on the details of the defensive battle, in which emphasis was given to fortification, the co-operation of infantry and artillery and the necessity for maintaining communications using every means possible, to overcome the chaos of battle. British infantry had learnt much since the Battle of Loos (25 September – 14 October 1915) and attacked vigorously, which was assumed to be due to the confidence of the infantry in the overwhelming power of their artillery. British tactical leadership was found lacking and men tended to surrender if surrounded. Units were assembled close together and suffered many casualties to German artillery but the British showed skill in rapid consolidation of captured ground and tenacity in defence, small parties with automatic weapons being most difficult to overcome. German infantry remained confident of their superiority but British medium and heavy artillery outnumbered German guns and the quality of British ammunition had improved. German infantry and artillery positions were subjected to methodical bombardment, villages just behind the front line and ground affording natural cover were continuously bombarded and artillery registration and aim were assisted by organised aerial observation, aircraft also frequently being used to bomb villages at night. British frontal attacks by cavalry against infantry and had suffered &quot;heavy losses&quot;, reflecting badly on the tactical knowledge of British higher commanders.

Ill-prepared German attacks almost always failed and care needed to be taken to understand the difference between hasty counter-attacks () soon after the loss of ground with troops on the spot and organised counter-attacks () ordered by commanders further back, which needed more troops from reserve and deliberate preparation because of the inevitable delays in movement, communication and the preparation of artillery-support. A worked best with fresh troops, advancing behind a creeping barrage, lifting according to a timetable. Attacks into woods needed a different formation than advances by skirmish lines in open country, one line being followed by small columns. Flame-throwers had been ineffective because of the difficulty of carrying such heavy equipment through obstructions and the lack of view and should be reserved for defined objectives which had been studied beforehand.

===Casualties===

The Fourth Army suffered the 9th (Scottish) Division, the 3rd Division, the 7th Division and the 21st Division. BIR 16 had on 14 July, of the it suffered on the Somme that month. In July, the British suffered casualties on the Somme, the French (a combined total of and the German 2nd Army suffered of Allied casualties.

===Subsequent operations===
After the Battle of Bazentin Ridge, the British tried to straighten the salient at Delville Wood by advancing on both flanks, to reach High Wood and to capture Pozières on the left (northern) flank for good jumping-off positions for another general attack. The Germans tried to eliminate the salient at Delville Wood, to retain ground which shielded German positions from view and overlooked (gave observation over) British positions. For the rest of July and August, both sides fought for control of the three areas but struggled to maintain a high tempo of operations because of ammunition shortages, high casualties and wet weather which reduced visibility and made movement much more difficult. Both sides were reduced to piecemeal attacks and piecemeal defence on narrow fronts, except for a few bigger, wider-front attacks. Until September, most attacks were defeated by defensive fire power and the inclement weather, which frequently turned the battlefield into a mud-slough.

<text>Sir Paul Scott Holmes (29 April 19501 February 2013) was a New Zealand broadcaster who gained national recognition through his high-profile radio and television journalism. Holmes fronted one of first major prime time current affairs shows of the 1980s, &quot;Holmes&quot;, which ran on TV One from 1989 to 2004. Holmes hosted the Newstalk ZB breakfast show from 1985 to 2008, and the Saturday morning show from 2009 to 2012.

Holmes&#x27; other ventures included several notable hosting slots, including a short-lived weekly show on Prime Television in 2005, two stints as the anchor of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; and from 2009 until his retirement in 2012 the Sunday morning political talk show Q+A.

Due to his high-profile appearances and controversial manner, Holmes&#x27; personal life was often documented alongside his charitable efforts. He spent much of his career in the spotlight, including his campaigning of the Paralympics, the birth of his son, the collapse of his marriage, his daughter&#x27;s drug problems and his death. Holmes was also credited with bringing AIDS awareness to New Zealand, after featuring a story on a young girl with the disease, Eve van Grafhorst, on &quot;Holmes&quot;. However, he was criticised for his offensive views on people of colour, specifically of Māori and Black people.

Owing to his success, Holmes picked up a celebrity-like status and often made appearances in other media such as long running soap opera &quot;Shortland Street&quot;.

Holmes underwent treatment for cancer in 1999 and heart surgery in 2012. He retired shortly after the latter treatment and in 2013 was knighted by the Governor-General of New Zealand. Just two weeks later, Holmes died at his Hawkes Bay home.

== Early life ==
Born in 1950 as the first son of Chrissie and Henry Holmes, a mechanic, Holmes grew up in Hawke&#x27;s Bay and attended Haumoana Primary School and later Karamu High School in Hastings whilst the family lived in Tuki Tuki Road on a small agricultural property. He and his younger brother Ken were involved in rowing and debating, and Paul became a prefect. The family had another son, Christopher, who died shortly after birth.

Holmes had a particular interest in radio, and by sixth form he was practising announcing into the family tape recorder, auditioning at the local radio station, and acting on stage. At high school, Holmes became close friends with Mike Williams (future President of the New Zealand Labour Party) and Peter Beaven (future CEO of Pipfruit NZ). The trio remained friends for the rest of Holmes&#x27; life.

In 1968, Holmes left his family home and began studying law at Victoria University of Wellington. He shared a room at the university accommodation Weir House with Williams. Shortly into his course, he swapped his degree to the arts and was awarded a BA. Holmes was inspired by the actor Dustin Hoffman and wished to emulate his success. He got his first professional acting job on a radio production of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; and acted alongside Sam Neill in the drama society club. Whilst studying, Holmes worked at a Hawke&#x27;s Bay freezing-works.

== Career ==
Holmes began his career on radio in Christchurch in the 1970s. He then worked in Australia, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands before returning to New Zealand to take up a morning slot on Wellington station 2ZB.

In March 1987, Holmes took over from 1ZB host Merv Smith, who had been breakfast host for many years. This coincided with a change in format from community radio (middle of the road music, news, community notices, etc.) to Newstalk. The change was controversial, as many long-standing Smith listeners did not like Holmes or the news, interview and talkback format with no music. 1ZB fell to seventh position in the ratings and it took over a year before Holmes&#x27; show eventually rose to number one in the ratings for the programme&#x27;s time slot.

In 1989, Holmes became part of the younger, new-look revamp of Television New Zealand&#x27;s prime-time news. His 7pm network programme (simply titled &quot;Holmes&quot;, initially starting at 6:30 and later moving to 7:00 when the news was extended to one hour), analysing news items in greater depth, ran until 2004. Holmes&#x27; first TV segment featured guest Dennis Conner, the America&#x27;s Cup skipper. After being provoked, Conner walked off the set, providing Holmes with headlines the next day.

Holmes published an autobiography in 1999. A year later he released an album on CD, simply titled &quot;Paul Holmes&quot;.

In the 2003 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Holmes was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to broadcasting and the community.

After 15 years anchoring &quot;Holmes&quot;, he was reportedly disgusted to have been offered a six-month contract instead of an annual alternative and subsequently on 2 November 2004 he resigned from the show. Shortly after this he moved to rival TV company Prime Television, which had offered him a three-year contract.

His new show, &quot;Paul Holmes&quot;, launched on Prime on 7 February 2005. The new show was up against two new competitors, John Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Campbell Live&quot; on TV3 and Susan Wood&#x27;s &quot;Close Up&quot; on TV One, in a three-way competition that had previously never been seen on New Zealand television. In February 2005, the show rated 7.1 percent for its timeslot, compared with his former programme on TV One (renamed &quot;Close Up&quot;) at 31 percent share. In March 2005, following the launch of a rival show on TV3, Campbell Live, Nielsen Media Ratings listed Holmes&#x27; show at 4 percent. Poor ratings forced a timeslot change to 6 pm after only four months. By this time, the show had been retitled &quot;Holmes&quot;.

However, these small changes were not enough to save the show, the timeslot change proving fatal. On 8 August 2005, almost six months to the day after the show launched, it was axed by Prime Television, with Prime chief executive Chris Taylor citing poor ratings and inability to attract viewers from the traditional primetime news strongholds of TV One and TV3. The show returned in a weekly format in late 2005 and in 2006 was revamped into an hour-long chat show similar to the popular UK show hosted by Michael Parkinson.

In 2005, Holmes was dropped from the &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot;&#x27;s 50 most powerful people list largely because of his TV show&#x27;s poor ratings and influence.

He appeared on Māori Television&#x27;s Waitangi Day coverage on 6 February 2007. In March, TV One, Holmes&#x27;s former network, announced that he would be among the celebrities on the third season of the New Zealand version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;.

In early 2011, Holmes published &quot;Daughters of Erebus&quot;, a book on the 1979 Erebus Air New Zealand DC-10 airliner crash.

Sir Paul has a cameo in the form of a portrait with him wearing knights armour in the breakfast room on The Traitors NZ.

==Retirement and death==
In January 2012 Holmes received treatment in hospital after a &quot;health scare&quot;. He had previously battled prostate cancer in 1999, but had been released shortly after. The scare was reportedly the return of the cancer. In June he underwent open heart surgery and was placed into an induced coma to heal. In November 2012 a television blog posted a story claiming Holmes only had weeks to live due to congestive heart failure. Holmes rejected the rumor. Holmes broadcast his final interview in November 2012, with Kim Dotcom as the subject. Several weeks later, Holmes resigned from his radio work and on 8 December, announced his retirement. Following their interview, Holmes and Dotcom became friends and in Holmes&#x27; final days, he was visited by him. Holmes had left his breakfast show on ZB at the end of 2008, to be succeeded by Mike Hosking, instead doing daily phone-ins to Hoskings show. These also ended when he retired.

In the 2013 New Year Honours, Holmes was appointed as a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to broadcasting and the community. His investiture was conducted on 16 January 2013 at his residence, earlier than originally scheduled due to his failing health. Just a week later, Holmes was admitted to hospital. He was held under observation for two nights and was then released back into the care of his family. Many of those who had previously clashed with Holmes released statements making peace with the broadcaster, but a notable refusal to comment came from Dennis Conner (the American skipper who walked out of the first &quot;Holmes&quot; episode).

Holmes died on 1 February 2013 at his family home in Hawkes Bay. His public funeral was held on 8 February.

==Personal life==
Holmes&#x27; personal life was highly documented in the media in part due to his celebrity status measuring up to those he interviewed. He had brushed death numerous times in his life. The first occurred in 1973 when he suffered a major car accident in which he fractured his neck and developed a brain hemorrhage which cut vision to one of his eyes. He also survived several aircraft crashes, including a helicopter crash into the sea at Anaura Bay in June 1989, which killed fellow passenger cameraman Jo Von Dinklage. In 2004, he had two crash landings piloting his vintage Boeing Stearman biplane, on 14 January southeast of Tūrangi, and on 31 December at Bridge Pa Aerodrome near Hastings. Holmes also survived numerous health scares, including overcoming prostate cancer in 1999, and the heart condition hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

In 1991, Holmes became a father when his partner, Hinemoa Elder, gave birth to a son, Reuben Holmes. Elder had a daughter from a past relationship, Millie, whom Holmes was very attached to and who openly described herself as a &quot;daddy&#x27;s girl&quot;. Holmes later stated one of the proudest moments in his lifetime was when Millie referred to him as &quot;dad&quot;. Holmes married Elder the following year but the marriage only lasted 5 years. Towards the end of the marriage, Holmes began a short-lived affair with co-worker Fleur Revell that eventually saw him leave his wife and children. In 1998, Holmes started seeing real estate agent Deborah Hamilton. In 1999, the two moved in with each other, and in 2003, married.

In 2007, Holmes&#x27; stepdaughter, Millie Elder-Holmes, was arrested on charges of possession of methamphetamine. Holmes stood by Millie and ended up campaigning against the drug. Holmes&#x27; public addressing of the issue and opposition to Millie&#x27;s boyfriend led to the two falling out for over a year. In January 2010, they reconciled. Charges were eventually dropped. In 2014, Millie&#x27;s boyfriend, Connor Morris, was killed in a fight in Massey, West Auckland.

==Controversies==
Holmes gained media attention for a number of controversial remarks about prominent individuals and issues, including a comment made in 2003 about &quot;wahi tapu&quot; (Māori sacred places).

*In 2001, the Broadcasting Standards Authority ruled against Holmes for lack of balance and journalistic integrity in a series of news stories covering a campaign dubbed &#x27;A Generation Lost?&#x27; The campaign, led by Auckland-based marketer Richard Poole, blamed the then Helen Clark-led Government for a brain-drain of &#x27;young New Zealanders&#x27;, a key political issue at the time. The campaign was later exposed as politically motivated and financially backed by the New Zealand Business Roundtable, which Holmes was reputed to have known about but did not disclose.
*In September 2003, he repeatedly referred to then-United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan as a &quot;cheeky darkie&quot; during his radio show. There was an international outcry following the comments, but Holmes kept his job after making several emotional apologies, claiming he had been &quot;tired&quot;. The major sponsor of his TV show, Mitsubishi Motors, withdrew its support.
*In March 2004, he called the then-Israeli Prime Minister the &quot;butcher Sharon.&quot; Later that year he described Tariana Turia as a &quot;confused bag of lard&quot;, &quot;a bully&quot; who &quot;folded under pressure&quot; and who did not have the &quot;guts to vote&quot;, as being &quot;all mouth and no trousers, all talk and no walk&quot; and a &quot;complete fool&quot;.
*In November 2010, TVNZ announced it would investigate official complaints regarding Holmes&#x27; performance on the current affairs show &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; during an interview with various players in the Hobbit film project controversy.
*In February 2012, Holmes wrote an opinion piece for &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; strongly criticising Waitangi Day and Māori people. He labelled Waitangi Day as &quot;loony Maori fringe self-denial day&quot; and described a &quot;hopeless failure of Maori to educate their children and stop them bashing their babies.&quot; The piece resulted in a number of formal complaints, which were upheld by the New Zealand Press Council.

<doc id="1114239" wikidata="Q425065" url="?curid=1114239" title="Arsenic trisulfide">
<text>Arsenic trisulfide is the inorganic compound with the formula . It is a dark yellow solid that is insoluble in water. It also occurs as the mineral orpiment (Latin: auripigmentum), which has been used as a pigment called King&#x27;s yellow. It is produced in the analysis of arsenic compounds. It is a group V/VI, intrinsic p-type semiconductor and exhibits photo-induced phase-change properties.

== Structure ==
 occurs both in crystalline and amorphous forms. Both forms feature polymeric structures consisting of trigonal pyramidal As(III) centres linked by sulfide centres. The sulfide centres are two-fold coordinated to two arsenic atoms. In the crystalline form, the compound adopts a ruffled sheet structure. The bonding between the sheets consists of van der Waals forces. The crystalline form is usually found in geological samples. Amorphous does not possess a layered structure but is more highly cross-linked. Like other glasses, there is no medium or long-range order, but the first co-ordination sphere is well defined. is a good glass former and exhibits a wide glass-forming region in its phase diagram.

==Properties==
It is a semiconductor, with a direct band gap of 2.7 eV. The wide band gap makes it transparent to infrared light between 620 nm and 11 μm.

== Synthesis ==

=== From the elements ===
Amorphous is obtained via the fusion of the elements at 390 °C. Rapid cooling of the reaction melt gives a glass. The reaction can be represented with the chemical equation:

=== Aqueous precipitation ===

 forms when aqueous solutions containing As(III) are treated with . Arsenic was in the past analyzed and assayed by this reaction, which results in the precipitation of , which is then weighed. can even be precipitated in 6 M HCl. is so insoluble that it is not toxic.

==Reactions==
Upon heating in a vacuum, polymeric &quot;cracks&quot; to give a mixture of molecular species, including molecular . adopts the adamantane geometry, like that observed for and . When a film of this material is exposed to an external energy source such as thermal energy (via thermal annealing ), electromagnetic radiation (i.e. UV lamps, lasers, electron beams)), As4S6 polymerizes:

 characteristically dissolves upon treatment with aqueous solutions containing sulfide ions. The dissolved arsenic species is the pyramidal trithioarsenite anion :

 is the anhydride of the hypothetical trithioarsenous acid, . Upon treatment with polysulfide ions, dissolves to give a variety of species containing both S–S and As–S bonds. One derivative is , an eight-membered ring that contains 7 S atoms and 1 As atom, and an exocyclic sulfido center attached to the As atom. also dissolves in strongly alkaline solutions to give a mixture of  and .

&quot;Roasting&quot; in air gives volatile, toxic derivatives, this conversion being one of the hazards associated with the refining of heavy metal ores:

== Contemporary uses ==
=== As an inorganic photoresist ===
Due to its high refractive index of 2.45 and its large Knoop hardness compared to organic photoresists, has been investigated for the fabrication of photonic crystals with a full-photonic band-gap. Advances in laser patterning techniques such as three-dimensional direct laser writing (3-D DLW) and chemical wet-etching chemistry, has allowed this material to be used as a photoresist to fabricate 3-D nanostructures.

 has been investigated for use as a high resolution photoresist material since the early 1970s, using aqueous etchants. Although these aqueous etchants allowed for low-aspect ratio 2-D structures to be fabricated, they do not allow for the etching of high aspect ratio structures with 3-D periodicity. Certain organic reagents, used in organic solvents, permit the high-etch selectivity required to produce high-aspect ratio structures with 3-D periodicity.

=== Medical applications ===
 and have been investigated as treatments for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

=== For IR-transmitting glasses ===
Arsenic trisulfide manufactured into amorphous form is used as a chalcogenide glass for infrared optics. It is transparent for light between wavelengths of 620 nm and 11 μm. The arsenic trisulfide glass is more resistant to oxidation than crystalline arsenic trisulfide, which minimizes toxicity concerns. It can be also used as an acousto-optic material.

Arsenic trisulfide was used for the distinctive eight-sided conical nose over the infra-red seeker of the de Havilland Firestreak missile.

=== Role in ancient artistry ===

The ancient Egyptians reportedly used orpiment, natural or synthetic, as a pigment in artistry and cosmetics.

=== Miscellaneous ===
Arsenic trisulfide is also used as a tanning agent. It was formerly used with indigo dye for the production of pencil blue, which allowed dark blue hues to be added to fabric via pencil or brush.

Precipitation of arsenic trisulfide is used as an analytical test for presence of dissimilatory arsenic-reducing bacteria (DARB).

== Safety ==

 is so insoluble that its toxicity is low. Aged samples can contain substantial amounts of arsenic oxides, which are soluble and therefore highly toxic.

== Natural occurrence ==
Orpiment is found in volcanic environments, often together with other arsenic sulfides, mainly realgar. It is sometimes found in low-temperature hydrothermal veins, together with some other sulfide and sulfosalt minerals.

<text>Lake McKerrow (officially Lake McKerrow / Whakatipu Waitai) lies at the northern end of Fiordland, in the southwest of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. The lake runs from southeast to northwest, is in length, and covers .

Lake McKerrow drains, and is drained by, the Hollyford River. It is one of two lakes (along with Lake Alabaster) found in the lower reaches of the Hollyford River system, and the Hollyford Track, one of New Zealand&#x27;s most well-known and popular tramping tracks, follows its eastern shore for its full length.

The lake is technically a fiord which has been cut off from the Tasman Sea by sediment. The sea is now three kilometres from the lake&#x27;s northern end.

The Alpine Fault goes through the lake. Researchers from GNS Science and University of Nevada, Reno have studied sediments from the 24 last Alpine Fault earthquakes near the lake and have found the most regular rupture behaviour yet observed.

Following the passage of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the lake became one of roughly 90 places in the South Island to be officially given a dual name, adopting the name Lake McKerrow / Whakatipu Waitai.

<text>Mirabilite, also known as Glauber&#x27;s salt, is a hydrous sodium sulfate mineral with the chemical formula Na2SO4·10H2O. It is a vitreous, colorless to white monoclinic mineral that forms as an evaporite from sodium sulfate-bearing brines. It is found around saline springs and along saline playa lakes. Associated minerals include gypsum, halite, thenardite, trona, glauberite, and epsomite.

Mirabilite is unstable and quickly dehydrates in dry air, the prismatic crystals turning into a white powder, thenardite (Na2SO4). In turn, thenardite can also absorb water and converts to mirabilite.

Mirabilite is used as a purgative and anti-inflammatory remedy in the Traditional Chinese medicine; in Mandarin, it is called máng xiāo 硭硝. The name &#x27;mirabilite&#x27; is based on the phrase &quot;Sal mirabilis&quot; (Latin for &quot;wonderful salt&quot;) used by Johann Rudolph Glauber when he inadvertently synthesized mirabilite.

Mirabilite is found in several areas within the Mammoth Cave System, where it appears to have been mined by Late Archaic and Early Woodland peoples, probably for use as a laxative.
Four mirabilite mounds were documented on the south shore of the Great Salt Lake, Utah, United States, in January 2020. These developed where springs surfaced along the beach, which had been exposed due to lower lake elevations, and cold air helped preserve the salt precipitate. This was documented by the Utah Geological Survey as well as reported in the press.

<doc id="1114249" wikidata="Q1138689" url="?curid=1114249" title="ISO/IEC 7812">
<text>ISO/IEC 7812 &quot;Identification cards – Identification of issuers&quot; is an international standard published jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). It specifies &quot;a numbering system for the identification of the card issuers, the format of the issuer identification number (IIN) and the primary account number (PAN)&quot;, and procedures for registering IINs. It was first published in 1989.

ISO/IEC 7812 has two parts:
* &quot;Part 1: Numbering system&quot;
* &quot;Part 2: Application and registration procedures&quot;

The registration authority for Issuer Identification Numbers (IINs) is the American Bankers Association.

An IIN is currently six digits in length. The leading digit is the &quot;major industry identifier&quot; (MII), followed by 5 digits, which together make up the IIN. This IIN is paired with an &quot;individual account identification&quot; number, and a single digit checksum.

In 2015, ISO TC68/SC9 began work on implementing a change to ISO/IEC 7812 to increase the length of the IIN to 8 digits. The 2017 revision of the standard, since updated by the 2022 systematic review, defined the new eight-digit IIN and outlined a timeline for conversion of existing six digits IINs to eight-digit IINs.

In February 2024, CUSIP Global Services, the US National Number Agency for securities identifiers, assumed administrative responsibility for 7812 on behalf of the ABA. 

==Major industry identifier==
The first (leading) digit of the IIN identifies the major industry of the card issuer.
ISO 7812-1 (section 4.2) makes note of some special ranges that do not follow the general 6/8 digit IIN scheme:

Card numbers starting with &quot;80&quot; or &quot;9&quot; are followed by the three-digit numeric-3 country code from ISO 3166-1, shown as CCC above. Digits after these prefixes are managed by ISO-member national standards bodies.

==Issuer identifier number==
The first six or eight digits, including the major industry identifier, compose the &quot;issuer identifier number&quot; (IIN) which identifies the issuing organization. The IIN is sometimes referred to as a &quot;bank identification number&quot; (BIN). The IIN&#x27;s use is much broader than identification of a bank. IINs are used by companies other than banks.

===IIN Register===
The official &quot;ISO Register of Issuer Identification Numbers&quot;, is not available to the general public. It is only available to institutions who hold IINs published in the register, financial networks and processors. Institutions are required to sign a licensing agreement before they are given access to the register. Several IINs are well known, especially those representing credit card issuers.

==Individual account identification==
In conjunction with the IIN, card issuers assign an account number to a card holder. The account number is variable in length with a maximum of 12 digits when used in conjunction with a six digit IIN. When using an eight digit IIN, the maximum total length of the primary account number (PAN) remains at 19 digits. The PAN comprises the IIN, the individual account identifier, and the check digit, so when using an eight digit IIN, the maximum length of an individual account identifier would only be 10 digits.

==Check digit==
The final digit is a check digit which is calculated using the Luhn algorithm, defined in Annex B of ISO/IEC 7812-1.

<text>Lake Alabaster / Wāwāhi Waka, also known by the Māori name of &quot;Waiwahuika&quot;, lies at the northern end of Fiordland, in the southwest of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. The lake runs from northeast to southwest, is , and covers .

Lake Alabaster drains, and is drained by, the Pyke River, a small tributary of the Hollyford River / Whakatipu Kā Tuka. It is one of two lakes (along with Lake McKerrow / Whakatipu Waitai) found in the lower reaches of the Hollyford River system. A branch of the Hollyford Track, one of New Zealand&#x27;s most well-known and popular tramping tracks, extends along the eastern shore of the lake.

The lake was formed at the southern end of a glacial valley and, had the sea level been slightly higher, would have been the northern arm of what might have been McKerrow Fiord.

<text>Deborah Morris-Travers (born 9 August 1970) is a former New Zealand politician. She was a list MP for New Zealand First from 1996 to 1998.

==Member of Parliament==


Morris was an MP from 1996 to 1998, representing the New Zealand First party. She was first elected to Parliament in the 1996 election as a list MP, and when her party formed a coalition with the National Party, she became a Minister. Her most prominent role was as Minister of Youth Affairs, where her own relative youth was seen as an asset – she was understood to be the youngest person ever appointed to ministerial rank (at the age of 26). In 1996 she caused controversy by suggesting that young New Zealanders should have better access to contraceptives. Her suggestion was publicly opposed by the Governor-General Sir Michael Hardie Boys.

When the coalition collapsed, and New Zealand First itself began to split up, Morris was one of the first MPs to leave the party, saying that she could no longer accept the &quot;perpetual state of crisis&quot; generated by its leader, Winston Peters. Unlike some other New Zealand First defectors, Morris did not make a deal with the National Party to keep her ministerial portfolios, resigning from her position on 18 August 1998. Morris remained an independent until her resignation from Parliament on 20 December 1998. As she had been elected on the New Zealand First list, her replacement, Gilbert Myles, was also drawn from that list.

==Life after politics==

Since leaving Parliament, Morris has worked in public relations and as an advocate for New Zealand children. After time living and working overseas on disarmament issues with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, she returned to New Zealand to work for non-governmental organisations. She worked at Plunket, Barnardo&#x27;s, Save the Children and UNICEF New Zealand, leading the movement for children. She helped establish Every Child Counts and then the Tick4Kids networks, working to get child abuse and child poverty onto the public agenda. In 2007, she was awarded the Vodafone World of Difference grant. She lent her support for the controversial repeal of Section 59, which removed the defence of reasonable force in child discipline.

At the 2013 local authority elections Morris-Travers stood for, and was elected to, the Paraparaumu Raumati Community Board.

In 2016, Deborah Morris-Travers delivered her Ted talk to TedX Wellington.
She later became the Green Party Chief of Staff. In 2017, she left her position as Chief of Staff due to disagreements over Metiria Turei&#x27;s public admission to historical benefit and electoral fraud which eventually caused a loss of support for the party and led to Turei&#x27;s resignation. Later Morris ruled out a bid for the co-leadership in the election to replace Turei. She was replaced in her role by then-digital director Tory Whanau.

==Republicanism and electoral reform==

In 1994, Morris was a founding member of the Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand, and supports a New Zealand republic. She was also part of the campaign for proportional representation, achieving MMP.

<text>A weather ship, or ocean station vessel, was a ship stationed in the ocean for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in weather forecasting. They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. The vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided weather forecasting by weather forecasters and in computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography, including physical oceanography and the integration of meteorological and climatological data in Earth system science.

The idea of a stationary weather ship was proposed as early as 1921 by Météo-France to help support shipping and the coming of transatlantic aviation. They were used during World War II but had no means of defense, which led to the loss of several ships and many lives. On the whole, the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II for Europe and North America that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a global network of weather ships in 1948, with 13 to be supplied by Canada, the United States and some European countries. This number was eventually cut to nine. The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1985.

Weather ship observations proved to be helpful in wind and wave studies, as commercial shipping tended to avoid weather systems for safety reasons, whereas the weather ships did not. They were also helpful in monitoring storms at sea, such as tropical cyclones. Beginning in the 1970s, their role was largely superseded by cheaper weather buoys. The removal of a weather ship became a negative factor in forecasts leading up to the Great Storm of 1987. The last weather ship was &quot;Polarfront&quot;, known as weather station M (&quot;Mike&quot;), which was removed from operation on January 1, 2010. Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation.

== Function ==

The primary purpose of an ocean weather vessel was to take surface and upper air weather measurements, and report them via radio at the synoptic hours of 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Weather ships also reported observations from merchant vessels, which were reported by radio back to their country of origin using a code based on the square in the ocean within which the ship was located. The vessels were involved in search and rescue operations involving aircraft and other ships. The vessels themselves had search radar and could activate a homing beacon to guide lost aircraft towards the ships&#x27; known locations. Each ship&#x27;s homing beacon used a distinctly different frequency. In addition, the ships provided a platform where scientific and oceanographic research could be conducted. The role of aircraft support gradually changed after 1975, as jet aircraft began using polar routes. By 1982, the ocean weather vessel role had changed too, and the ships were used to support short range weather forecasting, in numerical weather prediction computer programs which forecast weather conditions several days ahead, for climatological studies, marine forecasting, and oceanography, as well as monitoring pollution out at sea. At the same time, the transmission of the weather data using Morse code was replaced by a system using telex-over-radio.
==Origin==
In the 1860s, Britain began connecting coastal lightships with submarine telegraph cables so they could be used as weather stations. There were attempts to place weather ships using submarine cables far out into the Atlantic. The first of these was in 1870 with the old Corvette &quot;The Brick&quot; 50 miles off Lands End. £15,000 was spent on the project, but ultimately it failed. In 1881, there was a proposal for a weather ship in the mid-Atlantic, but it came to nothing. Deep-ocean weather ships had to await the commencement of radio telegraphy.

The director of France&#x27;s meteorological service, Météo-France, proposed the idea of a stationary weather ship in 1921 in order to aid shipping and the coming of transatlantic flights. Another early proposal for weather ships occurred in connection with aviation in August 1927, when the aircraft designer Grover Loening stated that &quot;weather stations along the ocean coupled with the development of the seaplane to have an equally long range, would result in regular ocean flights within ten years.&quot; During 1936 and 1937, the British Meteorological Office (Met Office) installed a meteorologist aboard a North Atlantic cargo steamer to take special surface weather observations and release pilot balloons to measure the winds aloft at the synoptic hours of 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC. In 1938 and 1939, France established a merchant ship as the first stationary weather ship, which took surface observations and launched radiosondes to measure weather conditions aloft.

Starting in 1939, United States Coast Guard vessels were being used as weather ships to protect transatlantic air commerce, as a response to the crash of Pan American World Airways &quot;Hawaii Clipper&quot; during a transpacific flight in 1938. The Atlantic Weather Observation Service was authorized by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on January 25, 1940. The Germans began to use weather ships in the summer of 1940. However, three of their four ships had been sunk by November 23, which led to the use of fishing vessels for the German weather ship fleet. Their weather ships were out to sea for three to five weeks at a time and German weather observations were encrypted using Enigma machines. By February 1941, five United States Coast Guard cutters were used in weather patrol, usually deployed for three weeks at a time, then sent back to port for ten days. As World War II continued, the cutters were needed for the war effort and by August 1942, six cargo vessels had replaced them. The ships were fitted with two deck guns, anti-aircraft guns, and depth charges, but lacked SONAR (Asdic), Radar, and HF/DF, which may have contributed to the loss of the USCGC &quot;Muskeget&quot; (WAG-48) with 121 aboard on September 9, 1942. In 1943, the United States Weather Bureau recognized their observations as &quot;indispensable&quot; during the war effort.

The flying of fighter planes between North America, Greenland, and Iceland led to the deployment of two more weather ships in 1943 and 1944. Great Britain established one of their own off their west coast. By May 1945, frigates were used across the Pacific for similar operations. Weather Bureau personnel stationed on weather ships were asked voluntarily to accept the assignment. In addition to surface weather observations, the weather ships would launch radiosondes and release pilot balloons, or PIBALs, to determine weather conditions aloft. However, after the war ended, the ships were withdrawn from service, which led to a loss of upper air weather observations over the oceans. Due to its value, operations resumed after World War II as a result of an international agreement made in September 1946, which stated that no fewer than 13 ocean weather stations would be maintained by the Coast Guard, with five others maintained by Great Britain and two by Brazil.

==History of the fleet==

===Late 1940s===
The establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) had established a global network of 13 weather ships by 1948, with seven operated by the United States, one operated jointly by the United States and Canada, two supplied by the United Kingdom, one maintained by France, one a joint venture by the Netherlands and Belgium, and one shared by the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden. The United Kingdom used Royal Navy corvettes to operate their two stations, and staffed crews of 53 Met Office personnel. The ships were out at sea for 27 days, and in port for 15 days. Their first ship was deployed on July 31, 1947.

During 1949, the Weather Bureau planned to increase the number of United States Coast Guard weather ships in the Atlantic from five at the beginning of the year to eight by its end. Weather Bureau employees aboard the vessels worked 40 to 63 hours per week. Weather ship G (&quot;George&quot;) was dropped from the network on July 1, 1949, and Navy weather ship &quot;Bird Dog&quot; ceased operations on August 1, 1949. In the Atlantic, weather vessel F (&quot;Fox&quot;) was discontinued on September 3, 1949, and there was a change in location for ships D (&quot;Dog&quot;) and E (&quot;Easy&quot;) at the same time. Navy weather ship J (&quot;Jig&quot;) in the north-central Pacific Ocean was placed out of service on October 1, 1949. The original international agreement for a 13 ship minimum was later amended downward. In 1949, the minimum number of weather ships operated by the United States was decreased to ten, and in 1954 the figure was lowered again to nine, both changes being made for economic reasons. Weather vessel O (&quot;Oboe&quot;) entered the Pacific portion of the network on December 19, 1949. Also in the Pacific, weather ship A (&quot;Able&quot;) was renamed ship P (&quot;Peter&quot;) and moved to the east-northeast in December 1949, while weather vessel F (&quot;Fox&quot;) was renamed N (&quot;Nan&quot;).

===1950s===

Weather ship B (&quot;Baker&quot;), which had been jointly operated by Canada and the United States, became solely a United States venture on July 1, 1950. The Netherlands and the United States began to jointly operate weather ship A (&quot;Able&quot;) in the Atlantic on July 22, 1950. The Korean War led to the discontinuing of weather vessel O (&quot;Oboe&quot;) on July 31, 1950 in the Pacific, and ship S (&quot;Sugar&quot;) was established on September 10, 1950. Weather ship P&#x27;s (&quot;Peter&quot;) operations were taken over by Canada on December 1, 1950, which allowed the Coast Guard to begin operating station U (&quot;Uncle&quot;) west of northern Baja California on December 12, 1950. As a result of these changes, ship N (&quot;Nan&quot;) was moved to the southeast on December 10, 1950.

Responsibility for weather ship V (&quot;Victor&quot;) transferred from the United States Navy to the United States Coast Guard and Weather Bureau on September 30, 1951. On March 20, 1952, Vessels N (&quot;November&quot;) and U (&quot;Uncle&quot;) were moved to the south to lie under airplane paths between the western United States coast and Honolulu, Hawaii. In 1956 , while stationed at N (&quot;November&quot;), rescued the crew and passengers of Pan Am Flight 6 after the crippled aircraft diverted to the cutter&#x27;s position and ditched in the ocean. Weather vessel Q (&quot;Quebec&quot;) began operation in the north-central Pacific on April 6, 1952, while in the western Atlantic, the British corvettes used as weather ships were replaced by newer Castle-class frigates between 1958 and 1961.

===1960s===
In 1963, the entire fleet won the Flight Safety Foundation award for their distinguished service to aviation. In 1965, there were a total of 21 vessels in the weather ship network. Nine were from the United States, four from the United Kingdom, three from France, two from the Netherlands, two from Norway, and one from Canada. In addition to the routine hourly weather observations and upper air flights four times a day, two Soviet ships in the northern and central Pacific Ocean sent meteorological rockets up to a height of . For a time, there was a Dutch weather ship stationed in the Indian Ocean. The network left the Southern Hemisphere mainly uncovered. South Africa maintained a weather ship near latitude 40° South, longitude 10° East between September 1969 and March 1974.

==Fading use==

When compared to the cost of unmanned weather buoys, weather ships became expensive, and weather buoys began to replace United States weather ships in the 1970s. Across the northern Atlantic, the number of weather ships dwindled over the years. The original nine ships in the region had fallen to eight after ocean vessel C (&quot;Charlie&quot;) was discontinued by the United States in December 1973. In 1974, the Coast Guard announced plans to terminate all United States stations, and the last United States weather ship was replaced by a newly developed weather buoy in 1977.

A new international agreement for ocean weather vessels was reached through the World Meteorological Organization in 1975, which eliminated Ships I (India) and J (Juliett), and left ships M (&quot;Mike&quot;), R (&quot;Romeo&quot;), C (&quot;Charlie&quot;), and L (&quot;Lima&quot;) across the northern Atlantic, with the four remaining ships in operation through 1983. Two of the British frigates were refurbished, as there was no funding available for new weather ships. Their other two ships were retired, as one of the British run stations was eliminated in the international agreement. In July 1975, the Soviet Union began to maintain weather ship C (&quot;Charlie&quot;), which it would operate through the remainder of the 1970s and 1980s. The last two British frigates were retired from ocean weather service by January 11, 1982, but the international agreement for weather ships was continued through 1985.

Because of high operating costs and budget issues, weather ship R (&quot;Romeo&quot;) was recalled from the Bay of Biscay before the deployment of a weather buoy for the region. This recall was blamed for the minimal warning given in advance of the Great Storm of 1987, when wind speeds of up to caused extensive damage to areas of southern England and northern France. The last weather ship was &quot;Polarfront&quot;, known as weather station M (&quot;Mike&quot;) at 66°N, 02°E, run by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. &quot;Polarfront&quot; was withdrawn from operation on January 1, 2010. Despite the loss of designated weather ships, weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation, whose number has decreased since 1985.
==Use in research==

Beginning in 1951, British ocean weather vessels began oceanographic research, such as monitoring plankton, casting of drift bottles, and sampling seawater. In July 1952, as part of a research project on birds by Cambridge University, twenty shearwaters were taken more than offshore in British weather ships, before being released to see how quickly they would return to their nests, which were more than away on Skokholm Island. 18 of the twenty returned, the first in just 36 hours. During 1954, British weather ocean vessels began to measure sea surface temperature gradients and monitored ocean waves. In 1960, weather ships proved to be helpful in ship design through a series of recordings made on paper tape which evaluated wave height, pitch, and roll. They were also useful in wind and wave studies, as they did not avoid weather systems like merchant ships tended to and were considered a valuable resource.

In 1962, British weather vessels measured sea temperature and salinity values from the surface down to as part of their duties. Upper air soundings launched from weather ship E (&quot;Echo&quot;) were of great utility in determining the cyclone phase of Hurricane Dorothy in 1966. During 1971, British weather ships sampled the upper of the ocean to investigate plankton distribution by depth. In 1972, the Joint Air-Sea Interaction Experiment (JASIN) utilized special observations from weather ships for their research. More recently, in support of climate research, 20 years of data from the ocean vessel P (&quot;Papa&quot;) was compared to nearby voluntary weather observations from mobile ships within the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set to check for biases in mobile ship observations over that time frame.

<text>David William Mitchell (4 August 1813 – 1 November 1859) was an English zoologist and illustrator.

==Life and work==
Mitchell was born in Chalfont St. Peter, Buckinghamshire, the eldest son of Alexander Mitchell of Gerard&#x27;s Cross. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1832, graduating B.A. in 1836.

Residing in Bloomsberry Terrace, London, he married Prudence Philips Willes, eldest daughter of the Rev&#x27;d Edward Willes of Walcot, near Bath, Somerset on 30 October 1837.

Mitchell illustrated George Robert Gray&#x27;s &quot;Genera of Birds&quot;, but finding himself too busy with his work for the ZSL, he employed the German illustrator Joseph Wolf as his assistant on the project.

Mitchell was elected into the Linnean Society of London in November 1843. Mitchell was the first paid secretary of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), taking up the post between 10 February 1847 and 6 April 1859, instigating the construction of the first public marine aquarium in the Regent&#x27;s Park Zoological Gardens, which opened on 22 May 1853. He is credited with rescuing the London zoo financially by publishing attractive images of a few &quot;star&quot; animals, thus greatly increasing the number of visitors in the late 1840s.

Mitchell was a collector and dealer in skins and eggs, and for a time lived in Penzance, Cornwall.

Resigning his post as secretary of the ZSL on 6 April 1859, he became Aquarium Director of the Jardin d&#x27;Acclimatation in Paris, but died on 1 November 1859 (shot himself), only months after taking up the position, and was succeeded there by William Alford Lloyd.

<text>Isle of Wight Council, known between 1890 and 1995 as Isle of Wight County Council, is the local authority for the Isle of Wight in England. Since 1995 it has been a unitary authority, being a county council which also performs the functions of a district council. It is based at County Hall in Newport. The council has been under no overall control since 2021, being led by a coalition of independent, Green, and Our Island councillors called the Alliance Group.

==History==
Elected county councils were established in England and Wales in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888, taking over administrative functions previously carried out by unelected magistrates at the quarter sessions. As part of the historic county of Hampshire, the Isle of Wight was initially governed by Hampshire County Council. Shortly afterwards it was decided that the island should form its own administrative county, whilst remaining part of Hampshire for judicial and lieutenancy purposes.


The County of the Isle of Wight and the Isle of Wight County Council were therefore established, by the (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c. clxxvii) with effect from 1 April 1890, on which day the council held its first official meeting at the Guildhall in Newport. Somerset Gough-Calthorpe was appointed the first chairman of the council.
Until 1974 the lower tier of local government comprised several boroughs, urban districts and a rural district. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the lower tier was reorganised and the island was left with two districts: Medina and South Wight. As part of the same reforms the island was reclassified as a non-metropolitan county and given its own Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff, finally making it separate from Hampshire for ceremonial as well as administrative purposes.
On 1 April 1995, following recommendations made by the Local Government Commission for England appointed in 1992, the two district councils were abolished and the county council assumed their functions, making it a unitary authority. It was renamed &#x27;Isle of Wight Council&#x27; at the same time. It remains legally a county council, but one which also performs district functions. It was the first such unitary authority in England; many more were created from 1996 onwards.

The council has been a member of the Islands Forum since 2022.

==Governance==
The council performs both district-level and county-level functions. The whole island is also covered by civil parishes, which form a second tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2021 election, being led by a minority coalition called the Alliance Group, comprising some of the independent councillors, the Green Party and local party Our Island.

Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:

Upper-tier authority: Isle of Wight County Council
Unitary authority: Isle of Wight Council
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2007 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2021 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to May 2024, the composition of the council was as follows:

Of the independent councillors, ten (two of whom belong to the Island Independent Network, part of the Independent Network, a national umbrella group supporting independent councillors) sit in the &quot;Alliance Group&quot; with the Green Party and Our Island councillors, which forms the council&#x27;s administration. Of the other five independent councillors, three sit together as the &quot;Empowering Islanders&quot; group and the other two (one of whom describes themselves as &quot;Independent Labour&quot;) do not form part of a group. In February 2025, the government announced that it intended to postpone the elections that were due to take place in May 2025 for a year, to allow for alternative local government structures for the area to be considered.

==Premises==

The council meets and has its main offices at County Hall on High Street in Newport.

The council initially met at the Guildhall in Newport. In 1904 it moved its meeting place to the Technical Institute (now the Island Sixth Form) at the southern end of St James Street in Newport. Until the 1930s the council&#x27;s administrative offices were split between several different buildings.

By the 1930s, many of the council&#x27;s offices were at the former Swan Hotel and adjacent houses in High Street, Newport. A new building, designed in the Neo-Georgian style by Gutteridge and Gutteridge, was built on the same site and opened in October 1938. An extension was built on its east side in 1969.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2021 the island has been divided into 39 electoral divisions, each of which elects one councillor. Elections are held every four years.

==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms of the Isle of Wight was granted to the County Council in 1938. The shield shows a representation of Carisbrooke Castle, which was the historic seat of many island governors, surrounded by three gold anchors. At the bottom is the island&#x27;s motto &quot;All this beauty is of God&quot;.

<doc id="1114292" wikidata="Q17053253" url="?curid=1114292" title="Vaticinium ex eventu">
<text>Vaticinium ex eventu (, &quot;prophecy from the event&quot;) or post eventum (&quot;after the event&quot;) is a technical theological or historiographical term referring to a prophecy written after the author already had information about the events being &quot;foretold&quot;. The text is written so as to appear that the prophecy had taken place before the event, when in fact it was written after the events supposedly predicted. &quot;Vaticinium ex eventu&quot; is a form of hindsight bias. The concept is similar to postdiction.

==Examples==

===In religious writings===

The Babylonian &quot;Marduk Prophecy&quot;, a text describing the travels of the Marduk idol from Babylon, &quot;prophesies&quot; of the statue’s seizure during the sack of the city by Mursilis I in 1531 BC, Assyria, when Tukulti-Ninurta I overthrew Kashtiliash IV in 1225 BC and took the idol to Assur, and Elam, when Kudur-Nahhunte ransacked the city and pilfered the statue around 1160 BC. A copy was found in the House of the Exorcist at Assur, whose contents date from 713–612 BC and is closely related thematically to another &quot;vaticinium ex eventu&quot; text called the Shulgi prophecy, which probably followed it in a sequence of tablets. Both compositions present a favorable view of Assyria.

The Book of Daniel utilizes &quot;vaticinium ex eventu&quot;, by its seeming foreknowledge of events from Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest up to the persecution of Antiochus IV Epiphanes in the summer of 164 BCE. The stories of the first half are legendary in origin, and the visions of the second the product of anonymous authors in the Maccabean period (2nd century BCE). Its inclusion in Ketuvim (Writings) rather than Nevi&#x27;im (Prophets) was likely because it appeared after the canon for those books had closed, and the dominant view among Jews and scholars is that Daniel is not in any case a prophetic book but an apocalypse.

Statements attributed to Jesus in the Gospels that foretell the destruction of Jerusalem (e.g., Mark 13:14, Luke 21:20) and its temple are considered to be examples of &quot;vaticinia ex eventu&quot; by the great majority of Biblical scholars (with regard to the siege of Jerusalem in AD 70, in which the Second Temple was destroyed). However, there are some scholars who only see the verses from Luke as constituting a &quot;vaticinium ex eventu&quot; (and those of Mark not), while a few even go as far as to deny that the verses from Luke refer to the destruction of the temple in AD 70.

===Secular===
*The Ancient world saw the technique of &quot;vaticinium ex eventu&quot; used by a wide variety of figures, from Pindar and Herodotus to Horace and Virgil.
*The &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; by Dante Alighieri includes a number of such prophecies of Dante&#x27;s own exile from Florence.
*In &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot;, Torquato Tasso uses the &quot;vaticinium ex eventu&quot; trope in presaging the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus: &quot;Un uom de la Liguria avrà ardimento / a l&#x27;incognito corso esporsi in prima&quot;
*References in the late correspondence of Virginia Woolf to &quot;how I love this savage medieval water [...] and myself so eliminated&quot; are sometimes taken as presaging her suicide by drowning a few months later: the danger of &quot;vaticinium ex eventu&quot; has however also been observed.

<doc id="1114299" wikidata="Q189754" url="?curid=1114299" title="List of pharaohs">
<text>The title &quot;pharaoh&quot; is used for those rulers of Ancient Egypt who ruled after the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt by Narmer during the Early Dynastic Period, approximately 3100 BCE. However, the specific title was not used to address the kings of Egypt by their contemporaries until the New Kingdom&#x27;s 18th Dynasty, 1400 BCE. Along with the title pharaoh for later rulers, there was an Ancient Egyptian royal titulary used by Egyptian kings which remained relatively constant during the course of Ancient Egyptian history, initially featuring a Horus name, a Sedge and Bee (&quot;nswt-bjtj&quot;) name and a Two Ladies (&quot;nbtj&quot;) name, with the additional Golden Horus, nomen and prenomen titles being added successively during later dynasties.

Egypt was continually governed, at least in part, by native pharaohs for approximately 2500 years, until it was conquered by the Kingdom of Kush in the late 8th century BC, whose rulers adopted the traditional pharaonic titulature for themselves. Following the Kushite conquest, Egypt experienced another period of independent native rule before being conquered by the Achaemenid Empire, whose rulers also adopted the title of pharaoh. The last native pharaoh of Egypt was Nectanebo II, who was pharaoh before the Achaemenids conquered Egypt for a second time.

Achaemenid rule over Egypt came to an end through the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BC, after which it was ruled by Hellenic Pharaohs of the Ptolemaic Dynasty. Their rule, and the independence of Egypt, came to an end when Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BCE. Augustus and subsequent Roman emperors were styled as Pharaoh when in Egypt until the reign of Maximinus Daza in 314 AD.

The dates given in this list of pharaohs are approximate. They are based primarily on the conventional chronology of Ancient Egypt, mostly based on the Digital Egypt for Universities database developed by the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, but alternative dates taken from other authorities may be indicated separately.

== Ancient Egyptian king lists ==
Modern lists of pharaohs are based on historical records and, including Ancient Egyptian king lists and later histories, such as Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, as well as archaeological evidence. Concerning ancient sources, Egyptologists and historians alike call for caution in regard to the credibility, exactitude and completeness of these sources, many of which were written long after the reigns they report. An additional problem is that ancient king lists are often damaged, inconsistent with one another and/or selective.

The following ancient king lists are known (along with the dynasty under which they were created):
* Den seal impressions (1st Dynasty); found on a cylinder seal in Den&#x27;s tomb. It lists all 1st Dynasty kings from Narmer to Den by their Horus names.
* Palermo Stone (5th Dynasty); carved on an olivine-basalt slab. Broken into pieces and thus today incomplete.
* Giza writing board (6th Dynasty); painted with red, green and black ink on gypsum and cedar wood. Very selective.
* South Saqqara Stone (6th Dynasty); carved on a black basalt slab. Very selective.
* Karnak King List (18th Dynasty); carved on limestone. Very selective.
* Abydos King List of Seti I (19th Dynasty); carved on limestone. Very detailed, but omitting some of the Kings from First Intermediate Period and all the kings from Second Intermediate Period of Egypt.
* Abydos King List of Ramesses II (19th Dynasty); carved on limestone. Very selective, today damaged.
* Ramesseum king list (19th Dynasty); carved on limestone. Contains most of the New Kingdom pharaohs up to Ramesses II.
* Saqqara Tablet (19th Dynasty), carved on limestone. Very detailed, but omitting most kings of the 1st Dynasty for unknown reasons.
* Turin King List (19th Dynasty); written with red and black ink on papyrus. Likely the most complete king-list in history, today damaged.
* Medinet Habu king list (20th Dynasty); carved on limestone and very similar to the Ramesseum king list.
* Genealogy of Ankhefensekhmet (22nd Dynasty); carved on limestone, today damaged.
* Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; (Greek Period); possibly written on papyrus. The original writings are lost today and many anecdotes assigned to certain kings seem fictitious.

== Predynastic Period ==
The Predynastic Period ends around 3100 BCE when Egypt was first unified as a single kingdom.

=== Lower Egypt ===

Lower Egypt geographically consists of the northern Nile and the Nile delta.

The following list may be incomplete:

===Upper Egypt===

Upper Egypt refers to the region up-river to the south of Lower Egypt.

Regrouped here are predynastic rulers of Upper Egypt belonging to the late Naqada III period, sometimes informally described as Dynasty 0:
=== Predynastic rulers: Dynasty 0 ===

Since these kings precede the First Dynasty, they have been informally grouped as &quot;Dynasty 0&quot;.

The following list of predynastic rulers may be incomplete:
== Early Dynastic Period ==

The Early Dynastic Period of Egypt stretches from around 3100 to 2686 BCE.

=== First Dynasty ===

The First Dynasty ruled from around 3100 to 2890 BCE.
=== Second Dynasty ===

The Second Dynasty ruled from 2890 to 2686 BCE.
== Old Kingdom ==

The Old Kingdom of Egypt is the long period of stability and growth following the Early Dynastic Period and preceding the troubled First Intermediate Period. The kingdom spanned from 2686 to 2181 BCE.

=== Third Dynasty ===

The Third Dynasty ruled from 2686 to 2613 BCE.
===Fourth Dynasty===

The Fourth Dynasty ruled from 2613 to 2496 BCE.
===Fifth Dynasty===

The Fifth Dynasty ruled from 2496 to 2345 BCE.
===Sixth Dynasty===

The Sixth Dynasty ruled from 2345 to 2181 BCE.
==First Intermediate Period==

The First Intermediate Period (2183–2060 BC) is a period of disarray and chaos between the end of the Old Kingdom and the advent of the Middle Kingdom.

The Old Kingdom rapidly collapsed after the death of Pepi II. He had reigned for more than 64 and likely up to 94 years, longer than any monarch in history. The latter years of his reign were marked by inefficiency because of his advanced age. The union of the Two Kingdoms fell apart and regional leaders had to cope with the resulting famine.

The kings of the 7th and 8th Dynasties, who represented the successors of the 6th Dynasty, tried to hold onto some power in Memphis but owed much of it to powerful nomarchs. After 20 to 45 years, they were overthrown by a new line of pharaohs based in Herakleopolis Magna. Some time after these events, a rival line based at Thebes revolted against their nominal Northern overlords and united Upper Egypt. Around 2055 BC, Mentuhotep II, the son and successor of pharaoh Intef III defeated the Herakleopolitan pharaohs and reunited the Two Lands, thereby starting the Middle Kingdom.

===Seventh and Eighth Dynasties===

The Seventh and Eighth Dynasties ruled for approximately 20–45 years. They comprise numerous ephemeral kings reigning from Memphis over a possibly divided Egypt and, in any case, holding only limited power owing to the effectively feudal system into which the administration had evolved.
The list below is based on the Abydos King List dating to the reign of Seti I and taken from Jürgen von Beckerath&#x27;s &quot;Handbuch der ägyptischen Königsnamen&quot; as well as from Kim Ryholt&#x27;s latest reconstruction of the Turin canon, another king list dating to the Ramesside Era.

===Ninth Dynasty===

The Ninth Dynasty ruled from 2160 to 2130 BCE.

The Turin King List has 18 kings reigning in the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties. Of these, twelve names are missing and four are partial.

===Tenth Dynasty===

The Tenth Dynasty was a local group that held sway over Lower Egypt and ruled from 2130 to 2040 BCE.

===Eleventh Dynasty===

The Eleventh Dynasty originated from a group of Theban nomarchs serving kings of the 8th, 9th or 10th dynasty with roots in Upper Egypt that ruled from 2134 to 1991 BCE.

The successors of Intef the Elder, starting with Mentuhotep I, became independent from their northern overlords and eventually conquered Egypt under Mentuhotep II.

==Middle Kingdom==

The Middle Kingdom of Egypt (2040–1802 BC) is the period from the end of the First Intermediate Period to the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period. In addition to the Twelfth Dynasty, some scholars include the Eleventh, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dynasties in the Middle Kingdom.

The Middle Kingdom can be noted for the expansion of trade outside of the kingdom that occurred during this time.

===Eleventh Dynasty cont.===
The second part of the Eleventh Dynasty is usually considered to be the beginning of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt.
Enigmatic kings, only attested in Lower Nubia:
=== Twelfth Dynasty ===

The Twelfth Dynasty ruled from 1991 to 1802 BCE.
The position of a possible additional ruler, Seankhibtawy Seankhibra, is uncertain. He may be an ephemeral king, or a name variant of a king of the 12th or 13th Dynasty.

==Second Intermediate Period==

The Second Intermediate Period (1802–1550 BC) is a period of disarray between the end of the Middle Kingdom, and the start of the New Kingdom. It is best known as when the Hyksos, whose reign comprised the Fifteenth Dynasty, made their appearance in Egypt.

The Thirteenth Dynasty was much weaker than the Twelfth Dynasty, and was unable to hold onto the two lands of Egypt. Either at the start of the dynasty, 1805 BCE or toward the middle of it in 1710 BC, the provincial ruling family in Xois, located in the marshes of the eastern Delta, broke away from the central authority to form the Canaanite Fourteenth Dynasty.

The Hyksos made their first appearance during the reign of Sobekhotep IV, and around 1720 BCE took control of the town of Avaris (the modern Tell el-Dab&#x27;a/Khata&#x27;na), conquering the kingdom of the 14th dynasty. Sometime around 1650 BCE the Hyksos, perhaps led by Salitis the founder of the Fifteenth Dynasty, conquered Memphis, thereby terminating the 13th dynasty. The power vacuum in Upper Egypt resulting from the collapse of the 13th dynasty allowed the 16th dynasty to declare its independence in Thebes, only to be overrun by the Hyksos kings shortly thereafter.

Subsequently, as the Hyksos withdrew from Upper Egypt, the native Egyptian ruling house in Thebes set itself up as the Seventeenth Dynasty. This dynasty eventually drove the Hyksos back into Asia under Seqenenre Tao, Kamose and finally Ahmose, first pharaoh of the New Kingdom.

===Thirteenth Dynasty===

The Thirteenth Dynasty (following the Turin King List) ruled from 1802 to around 1649 BCE and lasted 153 or 154 years according to Manetho.

This table should be contrasted with Known kings of the 13th Dynasty:
The position of the following kings is uncertain:

===Fourteenth Dynasty===

The Fourteenth Dynasty was a local group from the eastern Delta, based at Avaris, that ruled from either 1805 BCE or around 1710 BCE until around 1650 BCE.

Some of the contested rulers of the 14th Dynasty (proposed by Kim Ryholt) are commonly identified by Egyptologists as being of Canaanite (Semitic) descent, owing to the distinct origins of the names of some of their kings and princes. However, the dynasty rulers are not referred to as Hyksos in the Turin kings list. It is here given according to Ryholt; however, this reconstruction of the dynasty is heavily debated with the position of the five kings preceding Nehesy highly disputed.

The position and identity of the following pharaohs is uncertain:

The Turin King List provides additional names, none of which are attested beyond the list.

===Fifteenth Dynasty===

The Fifteenth Dynasty arose from among the Hyksos people who emerged from the Fertile Crescent to establish a short-lived governance over much of the Nile region, and ruled from 1674 to 1535 BCE.

===Abydos Dynasty===

The Second Intermediate Period may include an independent dynasty reigning over Abydos from around 1650 BCE until 1600 BCE.

Four attested kings may be tentatively attributed to the Abydos Dynasty, and they are given here without regard for their (unknown) chronological order:
===Sixteenth Dynasty===

The Sixteenth Dynasty was a native Theban dynasty emerging from the collapse of the Memphis-based 13th dynasty around 1650 BCE. They were finally conquered by the Hyksos 15th dynasty around 1580 BCE.

The 16th dynasty held sway over Upper Egypt only.
The 16th Dynasty may also have comprised the reigns of pharaohs Sneferankhre Pepi III and Nebmaatre. Their chronological position is uncertain.

===Seventeenth Dynasty===

The Seventeenth Dynasty was based in Upper Egypt and ruled from 1650 to 1550 BC:
The early 17th Dynasty may also have included the reign of a pharaoh Nebmaatre, whose chronological position is uncertain.

==New Kingdom==

The New Kingdom (1550–1077 BC) is the period covering the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth dynasty of Egypt, from the 16th to the 11th century BC, between the Second Intermediate Period, and the Third Intermediate Period.

Through military dominance abroad, the New Kingdom saw Egypt&#x27;s greatest territorial extent. It expanded far into Nubia in the south, and held wide territories in the Near East. Egyptian armies fought with Hittite armies for control of modern-day Syria.

Three of the best known pharaohs of the New Kingdom are Akhenaten, also known as Amenhotep IV, whose exclusive worship of the Aten is often interpreted as the first instance of monotheism, Tutankhamun known for the discovery of his nearly intact tomb, and Ramesses II who attempted to recover the territories in modern Israel/Palestine, Lebanon and Syria that had been held in the Eighteenth Dynasty. His reconquest led to the Battle of Qadesh, where he led the Egyptian armies against the army of the Hittite king Muwatalli II.

=== Eighteenth Dynasty ===

The Eighteenth Dynasty ruled from 1550 to 1292 BC:
=== Nineteenth Dynasty ===
{{Main|Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt}}
The Nineteenth Dynasty ruled from 1292 to 1186 BCE and includes one of the greatest pharaohs: Ramesses II the Great.

=== Twentieth Dynasty ===
{{Main|Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt}}
The Twentieth Dynasty ruled from 1190 to 1077 BC:

==Third Intermediate Period==
{{Main|Third Intermediate Period of Egypt}}
The Third Intermediate Period (1077–664 BC) marked the end of the New Kingdom after the collapse of the Egyptian empire at the end of the Bronze Age. Two dynasties of Libyan origin ruled, giving this period its alternative name of the Libyan Period.

===Twenty-First Dynasty===
{{Main|Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt}}
The Twenty-First Dynasty was based at Tanis and was a relatively weak group. Theoretically, they were rulers of all Egypt, but in practice their influence was limited to Lower Egypt. They ruled from 1077 to 943 BCE.

====Theban High Priests of Amun====
{{Main|Theban High Priests of Amun}}
Though not officially pharaohs, the High Priests of Amun at Thebes were the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of Upper Egypt during the Twenty-first dynasty, writing their names in cartouches and being buried in royal tombs.

===Twenty-Second Dynasty===
{{Main|Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt}}
The pharaohs of the Twenty-Second Dynasty were Libyans, ruling from around 943 to 728 BCE.
===Twenty-Third Dynasty===
{{Main|Twenty-third Dynasty of Egypt}}
The Twenty-Third Dynasty was a local group, again of Libyan origin, based at Herakleopolis and Thebes that ruled from 837 to {{circa}} 735 BCE.
Rudamun was succeeded in Thebes by a local ruler:
=== Twenty-Fourth Dynasty ===
{{Main|Twenty-fourth Dynasty of Egypt}}
The Twenty-fourth Dynasty was a short-lived rival dynasty located in the western Delta (Sais), with only two pharaohs ruling from 732 to 720 BCE.

=== Twenty-Fifth Dynasty ===
{{Main|Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt}}
Nubians invaded Lower Egypt and took the throne of Egypt under Piye although they already controlled Thebes and Upper Egypt in the early years of Piye&#x27;s reign. Piye&#x27;s conquest of Lower Egypt established the Twenty-fifth Dynasty which ruled until 656 BCE.
They were ultimately driven back into Nubia, where they established a kingdom at Napata (656–590), and, later, at Meroë (590 BCE – AD 500).

== Late Period ==
{{Main|Late Period of Ancient Egypt}}
The Late Period runs from around 664 to 332 BC, and includes periods of rule by native Egyptians and Persians.

=== Twenty-Sixth Dynasty ===
{{Main|Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt}}
The Twenty-sixth Dynasty ruled from around 664 to 525 BCE.

The son and successor of Nekau I, Psamtik I, managed to reunify Egypt and is generally regarded as the founder of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty.

===Twenty-Seventh Dynasty===
{{Main|Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt}}
Egypt was conquered by the Persian Empire in 525 BCE by king Cambyses II, the son of Cyrus the Great, and remained Persian satrapy for more than one hundred years until regaining independence in 404 BCE. The Achaemenid kings were acknowledged as Pharaohs in this era, forming the 27th Dynasty:
Several native rebellions took place during the 27th dynasty:
===Twenty-Eighth Dynasty===
{{Main|Twenty-eighth Dynasty of Egypt}}
The Twenty-eighth Dynasty lasted only 6 years, from 404 to 398 BC, with one pharaoh:
===Twenty-Ninth Dynasty===
{{Main|Twenty-ninth Dynasty of Egypt}}
The Twenty-ninth Dynasty ruled from 398 to 380 BC:
===Thirtieth Dynasty===
{{Main|Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt}}
The Thirtieth Dynasty ruled from 379/8 until Egypt once more came under Persian rule {{c.}} 340 BC:{{sfn|Lloyd|1994|p=358}}{{sfn|Depuydt|2006|pp=269–270}}
=== Thirty-First Dynasty ===
{{Main|Thirty-first dynasty of Egypt}}
Egypt again came under the control of the Achaemenid Persians. After the practice of Manetho, the Persian rulers from 340 to 332 BCE are occasionally designated as the Thirty-first Dynasty:

Native rebellions again took place during the 31st dynasty:
==Hellenistic period==
{{Main|Hellenistic period}}

===Argead Dynasty===
{{Main|Argead dynasty}}
The Macedonian Greeks under Alexander the Great ushered in the Hellenistic period with his conquest of Persia and Egypt. The Argeads ruled from 332 to 309 BC:

===Ptolemaic Dynasty===
{{Main|Ptolemaic dynasty}}
The second Hellenistic dynasty, the Ptolemies, ruled Egypt from 305 BCE until Egypt became a province of Rome in 30 BCE (whenever two dates overlap, that means there was a co-regency). The most famous member of this dynasty was Cleopatra VII, in modern times known simply as Cleopatra, who was successively the consort of Julius Caesar and, after Caesar&#x27;s death, of Mark Antony, having children with both of them.

Cleopatra strove to create a dynastic and political union between Egypt and Rome, but the assassination of Caesar and the defeat of Mark Antony doomed her plans.

Caesarion (Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar) was the last king of the Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt, and he reigned jointly with his mother Cleopatra VII of Egypt, from September 2, 47 BCE. He was the eldest son of Cleopatra VII, and possibly the only son of Julius Caesar, after whom he was named. Between the death of Cleopatra, on August 12, 30 BC, up to his own own death in late August 30 BC, he was nominally the sole pharaoh. Ultimately, he was killed on the orders of Octavian, who would become the Roman emperor Augustus. While younger children of Cleopatra did survive Egyptian-Roman war, Octavian denied them inheritance of Egypt.
Native rebellions also took place under Greek rule:

Queens considered Pharaohs by Sally-Ann Ashton:
==Rome==
{{Main|Roman pharaoh}}

Cleopatra VII had affairs with Roman dictator Julius Caesar and Roman general Mark Antony, but it was not until after her suicide (after Mark Antony was defeated by Octavian, who would later be Emperor Augustus Caesar) that Egypt became a province of the Roman Republic in 30 BCE. Subsequent Roman emperors were accorded the title of pharaoh, although exclusively only while in Egypt.

The last Roman emperor to be conferred the title of pharaoh was Maximinus Daza (reigned 311–313 AD).

<doc id="1114309" wikidata="Q4663376" url="?curid=1114309" title="Abandoned child syndrome">
<text>Abandoned child syndrome is a proposed behavioral or psychological condition that is said to result from the loss of one or both parents. Abandonment may be physical or emotional; that is, the parent may abandon the child by failing to be present in their life, or by withholding affection, nurturing, or stimulation. As a result, abandoned children may also suffer physical trauma, which may stem from factors such as neglect, malnutrition, starvation, and abuse. Furthermore, abandonment may be either intentional or non-intentional; the parent may willingly leave the child, or they may be alienated from the child by force. Forced separation of a parent from their child may stem from a number of potential causes, including (but not limited to) alienation following a divorce, placement of the child in foster care, or political conflicts. With the nurture and support of a &quot;facilitative environment&quot;, the child can develop the ability to cope with the trial of abandonment.

Abandoned child syndrome is not currently recognized as a mental disorder in popular medical manuals like the ICD-10, DSM-IV, or DSM-5.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms may be physical or mental, and may extend into adulthood and perhaps throughout a person&#x27;s life. These symptoms can show themselves differently in childhood and in adulthood.

Adults that have experienced abandonment often display negative behaviors in current relationships. Among these symptoms include issues with intimacy, relationship sabotage, insecurity, codependency, being a &quot;people pleaser&quot;, etc. This can cause the attachment style of the adult to change as they get older, such as an anxious attachment style. This can cause these adults to constantly worry that their friends or partners are going to constantly leave them, always trying to please others, giving too much into romantic relationships, not understanding boundaries, constantly looking for signs of uneasiness in others, staying in a toxic relationship because of fear of loneliness, and many more. 

In children, transient separation anxiety is a normal part of their development and is usually experienced between 10 and 18 months, however it will not develop when the child experiences abandonment from birth, there being no connection to become separated from, or anxious about. It is common to end around the age of 3, but can be concerning when the symptoms of separation anxiety occur for an extended period of time. This can lead children to manifest symptoms such as a worry of being abandoned, feeling anxious when dropped off at a daycare, school, or family member&#x27;s house, clinginess, or even being ill but not showing the physical attributes of being ill. Children who have experienced the loss of a caregiver or parent may also experience more drastic symptoms in their life such as an addiction to drugs or harmful substances, eating disorders, and self-harmful thoughts and actions. Adopted children may display unique symptoms of abandonment such as aggression, withdrawal, depression, sleeping troubles, etc.

==Causes==
When children are raised without the psychological or physical protection they need, they may internalize a substantial amount of fear, which is also referred to as chronic loss. Not receiving the necessary psychological or physical protection results in abandonment. If children live with repeated abandonment, these experiences can cause shame. Shame arises from the painful message implied in abandonment: &quot;You are not important. You are not of value.&quot; This is the pain from which people need to heal. As the child grows older, these internalizations can lead to them physically hurting themselves, or getting into drugs and alcohol. Over time they will start to treat the people close to them differently and will become more irritable and angry. Another cause for these internalizations can be the Socio-Economic status of the child&#x27;s family and the environment they are surrounded with.

<text>Jorasanko Thakur Bari (Bengali: &quot;House of the Thakurs&quot;; anglicised to &quot;Tagore&quot;) is a Haveli in Jorasanko, North Kolkata, West Bengal, India, is the ancestral home of the Tagore family. It is the birthplace of poet Rabindranath Tagore and the host of the Rabindra Bharati University campus.

==History==
The Jorasanko Thakur Bari was built in 1784 by Nilmoni Thakur in Jorasanko in the north of Kolkata. The land on which this ancestral home stands today was donated by the famous Sett family (not to be confused with Seth) of Burrabazar to Prince Dwarkanath Tagore, who was the grandfather of Rabindranath Tagore. Dwarkanath Tagore was the adopted son of Ramlochon Tagore and when he joined Brahmo Samaj, he was forced to leave his ancestral house at Pathutiaghata. Here comes the role of another influential family, the Sett. The Sett family had a marshy land where two small walking bridges (&quot;Sanko&quot; meaning bridges in Bengali) were present and they donated the land to Prince Dwarkanath Tagore. So from the small dual bridges came the name Jorasanko.

Nilmoni Tagore left his paternal house due to certain family disputes, and set up his new residence at Jorasanko, after having acquired a plot of land situated on the east side of Chitpore Road. It was Prince Dwarakanath Tagore, the illustrious businessman and Rabindranath&#x27;s grandfather who expanded the residential complex. This is the &quot;Bhdrashan Bari&quot; (presently located at 6, Dwarakanath Tagore Lane) and it was here that Rabindranath was born in 1861. Another house was built adjacent to this house, called the &quot;Boithak Khana Bari&quot; (currently situated at 5, Dwarakanath Tagore Lane), in 1823, to house and receive European visitors. This later became the residence of Girindranath and his family, and the art-workspace of Abanindranath and Gaganendranath Tagore, two prominent members of the Bengali School of Art. A significant chunk of Bengal&#x27;s cultural spatial history was lost forever when this house was destroyed and pulled down in 1943. The &quot;Bhdrashan Bari&quot; today is known as the &quot;Maharshi Bhavan&quot;.

===Rabindra Bharati University===
The Rabindra Bharati University was established by the government of West Bengal in 1961 to commemorate the birth centenary of Rabindranath Tagore. 

===Rabindra Bharati Museum===
The house has been restored to reflect the way the household looked when the Tagore family lived in it and currently serves as the Tagore museum, offering details about the history of the Tagore family including their involvement in the Bengal Renaissance and the Brahmo Samaj. Photography is strictly prohibited inside the museum, but allowed outside. There is a light and sound show also, which happens in the evening.

The Government of West Bengal had long initiated the plan to establish a University in honour of one of Bengal&#x27;s greatest poet-philosopher Rabindranath Tagore, which finally took shape in 1961. The year was special as it marked the centenary celebrations of Tagore&#x27;s birth anniversary. Accordingly, under the Rabindra Bharati Act the University was set up at the Tagores&#x27; Jorasanko residence. The University aimed at the advancement of culture and arts. The Rabindra Bharati Museum was formed the following year. Located to the west of Maharshi Bhavan is the &quot;Bichitra Bhavan,&quot; another building that was built in 1897 by Rabindranath Tagore himself. The architecture follows closely the colonial style. Partly plastered and painted in white, this red brick structure is imposing, and situated amidst trees like the white frangipani, Champa, Spanish cherry, Ashoka, etc. This building today houses the museum and the archives. It is exhibited on the first floor of the house.

The Museum has a wide-ranging collection. Galleries are devoted to the leading figures of Bengali Renaissance, including but not limited to Dwarakanath, Debendranath, Rabindranath, Aban Thakur, and Gaganendranath. A gallery displays artworks from the Bengal School of Art founded by Abanindranath Tagore. Another shows portraits and paintings of the Tagore house and family by the Anglo-Indian school. The latter is called the Western Art Gallery. There are also galleries devoted to Rabindranath, showing his life, works and ideas. The poet-prophet&#x27;s visits, tours, influence and relationships with offshore countries are shown in the respective Japan Gallery, China Gallery, Hungary Gallery, and the US Gallery. There are also recent developments to create an Italy Gallery that shall show Tagore&#x27;s relations with the land, and ideas, and would strengthen Italy-India bilateral and cultural relations.

===Visits and programmes===

The Rabindra Bharati University organizes regular cultural programmes on Tagore&#x27;s birthday, Panchise Baisakh, when thousands flock to Jorasanko Thakur Bari, and on other occasions, such as his death anniversary, Baishe Shravan. It also organises a festival of arts, Aban Mela.

<doc id="1114317" wikidata="Q180339" url="?curid=1114317" title="Giovanni Belzoni">
<text>Giovanni Battista Belzoni (; 5 November 1778 – 3 December 1823), sometimes known as The Great Belzoni, was a prolific Italian explorer and pioneer archaeologist of Egyptian antiquities. He is known for his removal to England of the seven-tonne bust of Ramesses II, the clearing of sand from the entrance of the great temple at Abu Simbel, the discovery and documentation of the tomb of Seti I (still sometimes known as &quot;Belzoni&#x27;s Tomb&quot;), including the sarcophagus of Seti I, and the first to penetrate into the Pyramid of Khafre, the second pyramid of the Giza complex.

==Early life==
Belzoni was born in Padua. His father was a barber who sired fourteen children. His family was from Rome and when Belzoni was 16 he went to work there, saying that he studied hydraulics. He intended on taking monastic vows, but in 1798 the occupation of the city by French troops drove him from Rome and changed his proposed career. In 1800 he moved to the Batavian Republic (now Netherlands) where he earned a living as a barber.

In 1803 he fled to England to avoid being sent to jail. There he married an Englishwoman, Sarah Banne. Belzoni was a tall man at tall (one source says that his wife was of equally generous build, but all other accounts of her describe her as being of normal build) and they both joined a travelling circus. They were for some time compelled to subsist by performing exhibitions of feats of strength and agility as a strongman at fairs and on the streets of London. In 1804 he appears engaged at the circus at Astley&#x27;s Amphitheatre at a variety of performances. Belzoni had an interest in phantasmagoria and experimented with the use of magic lanterns in his shows.

==Egyptian antiquities==

In 1812 he left England and after a tour of performances in Spain, Portugal and Sicily, he went to Malta in 1815 where he met Ismael Gibraltar, an emissary of Muhammad Ali, the Pasha of Egypt, who at the time was undertaking a programme of agrarian land reclamation and important irrigation works. Belzoni wanted to show Muhammad Ali a hydraulic machine of his own invention for raising the waters of the Nile. Though the experiment with this engine was successful, the project was not approved by the pasha. Belzoni, now without a job, was resolved to continue his travels. 

On the recommendation of the orientalist J. L. Burckhardt he was sent by Henry Salt, the British consul to Egypt, to the Ramesseum at Thebes, from where he removed with great skill the colossal bust of Ramesses II, commonly called the &quot;Younger Memnon&quot;. Shipped by Belzoni to England, this piece is still on prominent display at the British Museum in London. This weighed over 7 tons. It took him 17 days and 130 men to tow it to the river. He used levers to lift it onto rollers. Then he had his men distributed equally with four ropes drag it on the rollers. On the first day (27 July) he covered only a few yards, but on the second he covered 50 yards, deliberately breaking the bases of two columns to clear the way for his burden. After 150 yards, it sank into the sand, and a detour of 300 yards on firmer ground was necessary. From there, it got a little easier, and, on 12 August he finally reached the river, where he was able to load it onto a boat for shipment to England. His excavation and removal of the Younger Memnon and other stones during this expedition was explicitly authorized by a &quot;firman&quot; from Muhammad Ali himself.

He also expanded his investigations to the great temple of Edfu, visited Elephantine island and Philae, cleared the entrance of the great temple at Abu Simbel of sand (1817), made excavations at Karnak, and opened up the sepulchre of Seti I (still sometimes known as &quot;Belzoni&#x27;s Tomb&quot;) in the Valley of the Kings. He was the first to penetrate into the Pyramid of Khafre, the second pyramid of the Giza complex, and the first European in modern times to visit the Bahariya Oasis. He also identified the ruins of Berenice on the Red Sea.
In 1819 he returned to England and published an account of his travels and discoveries entitled &quot;Narrative of the Operations and Recent Discoveries within the Pyramids, Temples, Tombs and Excavations in Egypt and Nubia, &amp;c&quot; the following year. During 1820 and 1821 he also exhibited facsimiles of the tomb of Seti I. The exhibition was held at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, London. In 1822 Belzoni showed his model in Paris.

In 1823 he set out for West Africa, intending to travel to Timbuktu. Having been refused permission to pass through Morocco, he chose the Gulf of Guinea coastal route. He reached the Kingdom of Benin, but was seized with dysentery at a village called Gwato (now Ughoton), and died there. According to the celebrated traveller Richard Francis Burton he was murdered and robbed. In 1829 his widow published his drawings of the royal tombs at Thebes.

==Commemoration==

A medal depicting a profile of Belzoni created by William Brockedon was cast in 1821 by Sir Edward Thomason. Belzoni’s friend Sir Francis Ronalds had introduced the artist and subject. Years later, in 1859 in Padua, Ronalds advised sculptor Rinaldo Rinaldi on the large medallion he was creating to commemorate Belzoni in his hometown.

Belzoni was portrayed by Matthew Kelly in the 2005 BBC docudrama &quot;Egypt&quot;.

Alberto Siliotti completed a unique scholarly edition of his travel writing, and it was the subject of the &quot;Horus expedition&quot; in 1988.

Horace Smith, a poet in the circle of Percy Bysshe Shelley, wrote &quot; Address to the Mummy in Belzoni&#x27;s Exhibition.&quot;

<text>Larry Walter Sutherland (15 April 1951 – 21 June 2005) was a New Zealand politician, and an MP from 1987 to 1999, representing the Labour Party.

==Early life and career==
Sutherland was born in Christchurch in 1951 and was raised in a Halswell orphanage. He attended Lincoln High School and after completing his education he worked many different jobs as a labourer, farm worker and forester. He eventually moved to Nelson where he trained as a sawfiler. There he became involved in the trade union movement, serving as a union secretary. He also became regional representative of the Wellington and Nelson Shop Employees&#x27; Union and president of the Nelson Trades Council. He was also a member of the Nelson Community Education Council, Nelson Polytechnic Council and the Nelson Public Relations and Promotion Committee.

His work in the union movement around Nelson brought him into close contact with the Labour MP for Tasman (and later Prime Minister) Bill Rowling. Sutherland joined the Labour Party himself and worked with Rowling, first as treasurer of the Tasman Labour Party electorate committee, and subsequently as its chairman. Sutherland would later attribute his political acumen to Rowling&#x27;s tutelage. He then sought nomination as Labour candidate for Nelson, in 1980 during Mel Courtney&#x27;s split with the Labour Party. He was narrowly defeated for the nomination by Philip Woollaston. That same year he unsuccessfully sought the position of vice-president of the Labour Party.

He moved back to Christchurch in 1984 and worked as a union official and continued his political involvement. He was assistant secretary of the Canterbury, Westland and Nelson Shop Employees&#x27; Union and chairman of the Labour Party&#x27;s Canterbury Regional Council.

==Political career==


Sutherland was first elected to Parliament in the 1987 election as MP for the Christchurch electorate of Avon, replacing the retiring Mary Batchelor after a tight three-way contest for the Labour candidacy. His first term in Parliament was a very stressful time for him. Labour ministers such as Roger Douglas and Richard Prebble were leading the party down a right-wing track (Rogernomics). Traditional Labour members resisted but were outnumbered and Sutherland saw himself as &quot;in opposition in his own caucus&quot;. When high-profile Labour MP Jim Anderton quit the party to form the NewLabour Party in protest of Rogernomics, Sutherland was widely tipped to follow him to the new party. His decision to stay and fight for &quot;old Labour&quot; values drew criticism from some in the union movement. He was vindicated in this regard when the party later turned its back on Rogernomics following the governments defeat in 1990 election.

Sutherland supported Helen Clark&#x27;s leadership coup bid after the 1993 election and, in perhaps his most outspoken moment, called on disgruntled MPs to &quot;pull their heads in&quot; and listen to rank-and-file members who wanted an end to Labour&#x27;s internal bickering. He retained that electorate until it was abolished in the 1996 election, when he successfully contested the reconstituted Christchurch East electorate. He opted not to be placed on Labour&#x27;s 1996 party list. He retired from politics at the 1999 election. When announcing his retirement he said he wanted to look for new career directions and spend more time with his family and also reaffirmed his opposition to Rogernomics stating &quot;I hope we are now at a turning point in New Zealand history where the absolute waste and stupidity of free market ideology is coming under scrutiny&quot;.

Sutherland&#x27;s most notable incident as an MP was a late night escapade where he swam a length of the parliamentary swimming pool whilst wearing National Prime Minister Jenny Shipley&#x27;s . While a shock to the public, he was renowned around Parliament by colleagues as a prankster and possessing an active sense of humour.

From 1990 to 1993 he was Labour&#x27;s spokesperson for Consumer Affairs and Civil Defense and spokesperson for Family Affairs from 1996 to 1999. Sutherland did not hold any ministerial portfolios, but became Labour&#x27;s Junior Whip in 1993. He was noted among his colleagues as a hard worker behind the scenes as junior whip, contributing much to party unity through a time of frequent rifts.

==Later life and death==
After leaving politics, he went into business as owner of a video store. He had always been a technology enthusiast and liked to possess state of the art stereo and television equipment.

Sutherland died suddenly in Christchurch on 21 June 2005, aged 54. He was survived by wife Verna, son David, daughter Christine and one grandchild.

<text>Branston Community Academy, (formerly Branston School and Community College) is a secondary school for 11- to 18-year-old students on Station Road in Branston, Lincolnshire, England.

==History==
===Secondary modern school===
Building started in 1955, and it was partly opened in January 1957 as Branston County Secondary Modern. It was built by Bosworth &amp; Wakeford of South Parade, Grantham. It was officially opened by the Earl of Ancaster, the Lord Lieutenant, on Friday 5 July 1957.

By 1959 around 350 pupils were enrolled. The name was shortened to Branston County Secondary School in 1968, and to Branston School in 1970. The headteacher was Mr L Kellett, the school was nine acres and cost £99,133, the furniture cost £11,300.

===Comprehensive===
The name was changed to Branston School and Community College in 1972, and later shortened to Branston Community College.

The original school consisted of a central block of classrooms, which included a dining hall on the ground floor, and a gymnasium. Woodwork and metalwork workshops were built nearby, while sports changing rooms and greenhouses were at the back. The school for many years ran a house system based on royal houses, with allocated colours: Tudor (yellow), Lancaster (red), Windsor (green), Stuart (blue), York (white) and Hanover (orange). This system has since ended.

Classroom space expanded through increased pupil numbers. A new library and office accommodation block, sports complex, swimming pool, fitness centre, youth wing, sixth form unit, science and language block and house rooms have been added over the years.

==Today==
In December 2010 the school changed its name from Branston Community College to Branston Community Academy.

Branston has previously held Business and Enterprise Specialist status and was one of the first 18 British schools designated as a Specialist Business and Enterprise College in September 2002. In 2003 the school became a DCSF Pathfinder Enterprise School, and in 2006 it was designated as the regional hub school for Enterprise. In 2005 the College set up a four-year partnership with Lincolnshire Cooperative and it has also been asked by the Specialist Schools Trust to take part in the research project, Capturing Transformation.

According to the Lincolnshire County Council website:

The Library has extensive book, non-book and ICT resources and a large area for private study. The Academy has invested heavily in broadband and wireless technology in addition to the several dedicated, networked ICT rooms.

<text>Aberystwyth Castle () is a Grade I listed Edwardian fortress located in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, Mid Wales. It was built in response to the First Welsh War in the late 13th century, replacing an earlier fortress located a mile to the south. During a national uprising by Owain Glyndŵr, the Welsh captured the castle in 1404, but it was recaptured by the English four years later. From 1637 it housed a Royal mint of Charles I, which minted coins from locally mined silver. The castle was slighted by Oliver Cromwell in 1649.

==History==
Marcher lord Gilbert de Clare built an earlier motte and bailey castle a mile south of the current site in around 1110. In 1116 it was unsuccessfully besieged by Gruffydd ap Rhys, King of Deheubarth. He was eventually successful in 1136, capturing it and burning it to the ground with the help of Owain Gwynedd and his brother, Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd, the sons of Gruffudd ap Cynan, King of Gwynedd. Their sister, Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd, Gruffydd ap Rhys&#x27;s wife, had been killed in battle by Gruffudd ab Llywelyn, who commanded for the Norman, Maurice de Londres. She had taken a force to meet him in battle at Kidwelly. Owain Gwynedd gave the castle to Cadwaladr to rebuild, but in 1143, Cadwaladr was implicated in the murder of Anarawd ap Gruffydd, the new king of Deheubarth. Owain Gwynedd sent his son, Hywel, to strip Cadwaladr of his lands in Ceredigion, and the castle was burned. It was rebuilt and later reinforced with timber and stone revetment and stone footings. After a succession of at least three owners, it was taken by Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great in 1221.

The current castle, as well as a new town, was built in a new location to the north, the current site, by Edward I of England. Construction began in 1277 after the end of the first war against Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, Llywelyn the Great&#x27;s grandson. Work on the castle was initially slow, and at the start of the 1282 war, the Welsh took and burned both the castle and the town. Probably under master mason James of St George, the castle was eventually completed in 1289 at a cost of £4,000. It was besieged extensively during the revolt of Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294–5 but held out because it could be supplied by sea from Ireland.

The adjoining walled town took its name from the older and important nearby village of Llanbadarn Fawr, and was thus called &quot;Llanbadarn Gaerog&quot; (). However, by the time of the Black Prince in 1343, the castle was in a bad state of disrepair; the main gateway and drawbridges, the king&#x27;s hall and long chamber, the kitchen range, and the outer bailey were falling down.

In 1404, Owain Glyndŵr captured and took possession of the castle during a national uprising against English occupation. It became a seat of government and in 1405, a treaty was signed between Glyndŵr and the King of France at the castle. Four years later, it was retaken by the English. In 1637 Thomas Bushell prevailed upon Charles I to establish a Royal mint in Aberystwyth, sited in the castle hall. This was authorised to mint the half-crown, shilling, half-shilling, two-pence, penny, groat, threepence, and half-penny coins, from silver that was mined locally in Ceredigion.

The mint&#x27;s operator raised a regiment of Royalist soldiers during the English Civil War, and the mint ceased operations in September of 1642, when Charles I issued the Wellington Declaration. Bushell seems to have removed bullion and equipment to Shrewsbury, and operations were diverted to Oxford. Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s forces took the castle in 1646 and the castle was slighted in 1649.

==Architecture==
Building work started in 1277 at the time of the First Welsh War, during Edward I&#x27;s first Welsh campaign at the same time as work started at Flint, Rhuddlan and Builth Wells. The inner ward was built in a diamond-shaped concentric castle, with a twin D-shaped gatehouse keep and mural towers at each corner. The inner ward is enclosed by a narrow outer ward, and there was an encllosure to the north that has been lost to coastal erosion. The original building had no inner curtain wall to the west, prior to the war of 1282–83, after which it was added.

== Plot ==
Saravanan, a renowned psychiatrist from the United States, comes to visit his best friend Senthilnathan and his wife Ganga while on holiday. Senthil&#x27;s mother Kasthuri wanted Senthil to marry Priya, the daughter of his father&#x27;s cousin Kandaswamy, to reunite the two branches of the family after 30 years of separation because Senthil&#x27;s father chose to marry Kasthuri instead of Kandaswamy&#x27;s sister, Akhilandeshwari, who is also his cousin. Saravanan learns that Senthil had bought the Vettaiyapuram mansion, despite attempts by the local village elders to dissuade them, and moves in with them. Akhilandeshwari is jealous of Saravanan and plots to get rid of him with the help of her assistant Oomaiyan.

When the family visits their ancestral temple, the chief priest reveals the reason everyone fears the mansion. Around 150 years ago, a king named Vettaiyan travelled to Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh, where he met and lusted after a dancer named Chandramukhi. However, she did not reciprocate his feelings as she was already in love with another dancer named Gunasekaran. As a result, Vettaiyan took her back to his palace by force. Unknown to him, Chandramukhi made arrangements for Gunasekaran to stay in a house nearby the mansion and met him secretly. When Vettaiyan discovered this, he beheaded Gunasekaran on Durgashtami and burnt Chandramukhi alive. As a result, Chandramukhi&#x27;s spirit started haunting the palace in a desperate attempt to kill Vettaiyan. Vettiyan however summoned high priests and powerful sorcerers from all over the country who were successful in sealing Chandramukhi&#x27;s tormented spirit, keeping it confined in a room located in the palace&#x27;s south-west corner and guarded by a 30 foot king cobra. Shortly, King Vettaiyan too dies. This story moves Ganga who persuades to move to check the locked room. Meanwhile. Priya is in love with Vishwanathan, a dance professor who reciprocates her feelings. Their love is supported by Saravanan, who requests Kandaswamy to arrange their marriage.

Ganga, who thinks that Chandramukhi&#x27;s story was fabricated to keep thieves from stealing treasures in the room, wishes to open the room. Saravanan receives an email to attend a patient and assures Senthil to call him if anything happens before leaving. Ganga works with the gardener&#x27;s granddaughter Durga to forge a duplicate key to Chandramukhi&#x27;s room and successfully opens the door hereby breaking the seal and releasing Chandramukhi&#x27;s spirit. Subsequently, strange things begin to happen in the household: a ghost frightens the people in the house, things inexplicably break, and Ganga&#x27;s &quot;sari&quot; catches fire. A local priest who enters the room with Kandasamy and Murugesan gets attacked by unseen spirit inside the room. Suspicion turns towards Durga as she spends the most time with Ganga. Senthil immediately calls Saravanan to solve the case and as soon as Saravanan returns, a mysterious figure tries to kill Priya. Saravanan also investigates other incidents such as the attempts to kill Senthil made by poisoning his coffee and pushing a glass fish tank off of a balcony to fall onto his head. One night, Saravanan hears loud singing and dancing from upstairs in Chandramukhi&#x27;s room that is closed from the inside. Attempts to open the main door stops the sound.

Akhilandeshwari seemingly approves the marriage of Vishwanathan and Priya but asks her brother to organize the betrothal to be organized only in the palace. In order to prevent Chandramukhi to create ruckus during the function Kandasamy requests a well known spiritualist and exorcist named Ramachandra Acharya. Acharya visits them but devises several rules to be strictly followed by the family. 

Kandaswamy and family prepares for Priya and Vishwanathan&#x27;s wedding his sister Akhilandeshwari rejects the proposal saying the groom is a poor. During the betrothal party, Ganga mysteriously disappears. Saravanan notices her absence and searches for her, but is attacked by Oomaiyanwho has been sent by Akhilandeshwari. Saravanan subdues Oomaiyan and with Senthil&#x27;s help finds Ganga, who is supposedly being sexually harassed by Viswanathan. Next day, Viswanathan comes to the palace and reveals the truth to Saravanan that only Ganga was behaving abnormally with him. Saravanan believes him but Senthil intervenes and argues with Viswanathan. Saravanan defends Viswanathan by telling Senthil not to scold or harm him. Senthil becomes emotional and chides Saravanan for offending Ganga. 

Meanwhile, Kandaswamy enters the spot and get physical with Saravanan due to his personal vengeance to which the latter bleeds. Ramachandra Acharya eventually intervenes the fight, and defends Saravanan by telling the family that he is not only a psychiatrist, but also a great disciple of Dr. Bradley from the States. Ramachandra Acharya tells the family that Saravanan prefers to cure Ganga despite getting insulted and beaten by Kandaswamy. He also reveals that if Ganga needs a peaceful life, then Saravanan must die at the hands of Chandramukhi. Saravanan, as advised by Ramachandra Acharya, informs Senthil and Viswanathan that Ganga suffers from split personality disorder following the traumatic death of her parents. He also reveals that she heard legends from her grandmother and imagined herself in the positions of the main characters, only worsening her disorder. Ganga&#x27;s mischief and inquisitiveness made her enter Chandramukhi&#x27;s room and started imagining herself as Chandramukhi which resulted in the personality of Chandramukhi to enter Ganga. The personality of Chandramukhi sees her lover Gunasekaran in Vishwanathan while Priya and Senthil being obstacles getting in between them, for which The personality of Chandramukhi tried to kill Senthil and Priya and framed Viswanathan for sexual harassment in order to stop his wedding to Priya. Saravanan explains that the only way to completely eliminate Chandramukhi is to make her believe that she killed Vettaiyan on Durgashtami, letting them know that he would have to sacrifice himself on Durgashtami, since Saravanan impersonated Vettaiyan and disrupted one of the &quot;pujas&quot; conducted by the exorcist Ramachandra Acharya by conversing with Chandramukhi to know its wish. Akhilandeshwari overhears Saravanan&#x27;s idea of self-sacrifice and apologises to him.

On Durgashtami, before carrying out his plan, Saravanan asks Senthil to trigger Ganga and see for himself whether she turns into Chandramukhi or not. When Senthil does so, she turns into Chandramukhi, which shocks him. A worried Senthil shouts at Ganga, stunning her back to normal. She falls unconscious and Senthil lets her rest, but once left alone, Saravanan, Senthil and Vishwanathan can hear the sound of Bharatanatyam anklets coming from the mansion&#x27;s dance hall. They bring the family there for Ramachandra Acharya&#x27;s rituals, where he allows Ganga (in her personality of Chandramukhi), to burn Saravanan alive. Ramachandra Acharya then blows smoke and ash on Ganga&#x27;s face when she is given a torch to burn Saravanan, distracting her momentarily. Senthil then opens a trapdoor to let Saravanan escape, and an effigy of Vettaiyan gets burnt instead. Convinced that Vettaiyan is dead, the personality of Chandramukhi leaves Ganga, thus curing her. The large cobra protecting Chandramukhi&#x27;s spirit too leaves the palace as a result. The two families are reunited after 30 years, and Saravanan lets them know that he and Durga have been in love for a long time. Paintings of Chandramukhi and Vettaiyan are removed from the haunted manor. Durga leaves happily with Saravanan, and the couple Swarna and Murugesan become parents after eight years of marriage. 

== Cast ==
Director P. Vasu, producer Ramkumar Ganesan and Rajinikanth&#x27;s friend Raj Bahaddur make guest appearances in the song &quot;Devuda Devuda&quot;.

== Production ==
=== Development ===

During a success meet for &quot;Mannan&quot; (1992), Rajinikanth announced that he would act in Sivaji Productions&#x27; 50th film, which would eventually become &quot;Chandramukhi&quot;. In September 2004, Rajinikanth congratulated P. Vasu on the success of his Kannada film &quot;Apthamitra&quot; (2004) and was impressed with the film&#x27;s screenplay. Vasu then requested to remake the film in Tamil with Rajinikanth, who in turn, called Ramkumar Ganesan and asked him to produce it under Ramkumar&#x27;s banner, Sivaji Productions.

Ramkumar telephoned Vasu, who was offering worship in a temple in Guruvayur at that time, informing him of Rajinikanth&#x27;s wish to do &quot;Apthamitra&quot; in Tamil under his direction. Vasu reworked the script he wrote for &quot;Apthamitra&quot; to suit Rajinikanth&#x27;s style of acting. The film dealt mainly with the concept of dissociative identity disorder, commonly known as &quot;multiple personality disorder&quot; (MPD) or &quot;split personality disorder&quot;. Another film titled &quot;Anniyan&quot; (2005), which was released two months after &quot;Chandramukhi&quot;, was also based on the same disorder.

Thota Tharani was the film&#x27;s art director, and also designed the costumes. Regarding the designing of the Vettaiyapuram palace, he watched both &quot;Apthamitra&quot; and its source Malayalam film &quot;Manichitrathazhu&quot; (1993) to get the basic idea of the film&#x27;s plot. Vasu wanted Tharani to make the sets more colourful and grand and did not want the realistic look of the original film. Tharani designed Chandramukhi&#x27;s room and placed a corridor in it, which was noticeably different from the original and its Kannada remake. The corridor resembled those commonly seen in palaces in Kerala. Sidney Sladen did additional costume designing in the film.

=== Casting ===

Rajinikanth played the roles of Dr. Saravanan and King Vettaiyan. He sported a wig for his role. Both Rajinikanth and Vasu discussed every scene featuring the former and added necessary inputs before they were shot. Rajinikanth appears in the beginning of the film unlike &quot;Manichitrathazhu&quot;, where the same character, played by Mohanlal, appears in the middle of the film. Rajinikanth requested Vasu to change the dancer&#x27;s name from Nagavalli, which was the name of the danseuse in &quot;Apthamitra&quot;, to Chandramukhi since the latter sounded more royal. While Vishnuvardhan uttered &quot;Haula Haula&quot; in the original, Rajinikanth used &quot;Lakka Lakka&quot;, which was based on the mannerisms of a villain in a Marathi play Rajinikanth watched in his childhood days. Ramkumar&#x27;s brother Prabhu played Senthilnathan, a civil engineer and owner of the fictional Ganesh Constructions. Prabhu co-produced the film with Ramkumar.

For the roles of Ganga and Chandramukhi, Simran was initially cast. She ultimately refused to do the project, as her role required a lot of dancing and cited her pregnancy at that time as another reason for her refusal. Aishwarya Rai was later offered the role but declined. Sadha and Reema Sen were also considered as replacements. The role finally went to Jyothika, who allotted 50 days of her schedule. Vasu wanted her to perform her scenes in a manner different from that of Shobana in &quot;Manichitrathazhu&quot;, enacting the scenes himself before they were shot featuring Jyothika. Nayanthara was selected to portray the role of Durga after Vasu was impressed with her performance in the Malayalam film &quot;Manassinakkare&quot; (2003).

Vadivelu portrayed the comic role of Murugesan. Rajinikanth, at the film&#x27;s 200th day theatrical run celebration function, said that it was he who recommended Vadivelu to Vasu for the role and had asked Ramkumar to get Vadivelu&#x27;s dates before planning the filming schedules. Sheela played Akhilandeswari, the intimidating older sister of Kandaswamy (Nassar) and Murugesan. When Sheela was signed on for the role, she was requested by the producers not to divulge details about her role to the media. Avinash reprised his role of the exorcist Ramachandra Acharya who talks with the spirit Chandramukhi from &quot;Apthamitra&quot;.

=== Filming ===

Principal photography commenced on 24 October 2004 with a &quot;puja&quot; ceremony for the muhurat shot at Annai Illam, the residence of Sivaji Ganesan. Ramkumar Ganesan said the filming would be finished by 15 February 2005, giving the crew two months to complete the post-production work, including visual effects. The first shooting schedule began two days later with a fight scene choreographed by Thalapathy Dinesh and filmed at Ramavaram in Chennai. More than 25 Toyota Qualis and 30 stunt artists were involved in the fight sequence that featured Rajinikanth. The Vettaiyapuram mansion was erected in Hyderabad. The song sequences, one picturised on Rajini alone, two songs in which he appears with the other principal cast members, and the climax song, which was picturised on Jyothika, were filmed in Ramoji Film City. Vasu said the film had taken only 78 days to be completed instead of the planned 120 days.

The picturisation of the song &quot;Devuda Devuda&quot; focused on a variety of professions, especially janitors, sewage cleaners, farmers and washer folk. According to Ramji, who helped the production unit look for locations for the song &quot;Konjam Neram&quot;, Ramkumar Ganesan and Vasu chose Turkey, making &quot;Chandramukhi&quot; the first Tamil film to be shot there. The production unit flew to Istanbul from Chennai via Dubai on 25 February 2005. The filming of the song was completed after the audio launch. &quot;Konjam Neram&quot; was shot in segments in Ephesus and Pamukkale. Shooting in Ephesus took six hours. The segment in Pamukkale was filmed in an amphitheatre in the ancient city of Hierapolis, which is located close to Pamukkale. The last segment was shot in the Cappadocia region, a 10-hour drive by bus from Istanbul. &quot;Raa Raa&quot; was choreographed by Kala and took four days to be completed instead of the planned seven days.

== Music ==

Vidyasagar composed the soundtrack album and the background score of &quot;Chandramukhi&quot;. The soundtrack album consists of six tracks with lyrics written by Vaali, Yugabharathi, Pa. Vijay, Na. Muthukumar and Bhuvana Chandra. The album was released on 5 March 2005 at the Taj Connemara hotel in Chennai.

It was the first public screening of the film in Japan.

Though the film was a remake, Madhu Muttam, who wrote the story for &quot;Manichithrathazhu&quot;, was not mentioned in either the opening or closing credits. Instead, the story was credited to the director P. Vasu. Vasu defended himself by stating the script was not a scene-by-scene remake of the original and that only the basic plot was used.

== Marketing ==
The producers entered into a business dealing with Tata Indicom to promote the film; ringtones of the songs from the film&#x27;s soundtrack and special screensavers were issued. Sunfeast Biscuits also helped in the film&#x27;s promotion. They launched special merchandise which consists of cards, featuring Rajinikanth and some stills of &quot;Chandramukhi&quot;. Giant cutouts of Rajinikanth and film release posters were posted all over the state as a run-up for the release. The promotional campaign started in early March 2005 and continued mid-May that year. The film was screened in eight city theatres in Chennai. The theatrical rights of the film in the Coimbatore and Nilgiris districts combined were sold to local theatre owners Tirupur Balu and Seenu for .

== Home media ==
The film&#x27;s original negative was damaged because of poor care and ill treatment. AP International started a restoration project, which scanned the film frame-by-frame in a 2K workflow. They were able to remove all wear and tear and retain the natural film grain. This restored version was released on 2 August 2012 on Blu-ray format. The film&#x27;s television premiere occurred on Sun TV, on the occasion of Diwali in 27 October 2008.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===

Writing for &quot;The Hindu&quot;, Malathi Rangarajan said, &quot;As you watch the film you cannot but admire the ingenuity of writer-director P. Vasu in choosing a story that is bound to sell and at the same time helping Rajini maintain his image of an invincible hero&quot;, before concluding that, &quot;The &#x27;Mannan&#x27; team proves a winner again&quot;. Another critic from &quot;The Hindu&quot;, Sudhish Kamath, said Rajinikanth is &quot;at his vintage best&quot;. A reviewer from &quot;The Times of India&quot; called the film &quot;Entertaining, stylish, respectful of ritual, and always massively larger than life&quot;. Arun Ram of &quot;India Today&quot; said, &quot;With &quot;Chandramukhi&quot;, Rajnikant revives his fading career and fortunes of Tamil cinema&quot;. G. Ulaganathan, writing for the &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; praised the chemistry between Rajinikanth and Vadivelu, saying &quot;Rajinikanth is back in full form, comedy comes naturally to him and he finds an able ally in Vadivelu. Some of the best scenes in the movie are when both are together.&quot;

Tamil magazine &quot;Ananda Vikatan&quot; said in its review, &quot;Rajni&#x27;s films normally revolve around him but in this case, Rajni is in a script which goes around several people ... Rajni as Vettaiyan is the highlight of the film ... After many years, Rajni has shown that he does not confine to his personality cage through this film.&quot; and gave the film 40 marks out of 100. The &quot;Sify&quot; reviewer wrote that &quot;Chandramukhi&quot; was simply &quot;a remake of P. Vasu&#x27;s &quot;Apthamitra&quot; from Kannada with some additional songs, fights and comedy scenes thrown in to further boost the superstar&#x27;s image&quot; but like Ulaganathan, commended the comedy scenes of Rajinikanth and Vadivelu, terming them the film&#x27;s highlight. A. Ganesh Nadar of Rediff said the film would become &quot;a certain hit&quot; and,&quot;[t]he star will be happy, his fans will be happy and producer Prabhu will giggle all the way to the bank&quot;.

V. Gangadhar of &quot;The Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;As in all Rajni films, &quot;Chandramukhi&quot; is a one-star attraction and Rajni plays to the gallery, There are no political messages in the film and that should come as some relief. With Nayanthara and Jyothika in the female leads, there is plenty of glamour in the film. But the message is clear, King Rajni is back. His legion of fans can not ask for more.&quot; Karthiga Rukmanykanthan writing for &quot;Daily News Sri Lanka&quot; said, &quot; ... the long anticipated delight &quot;Chandramukhi&quot; has made itself the box-office hit of the year&quot;. Grady Hendrix of &quot;Slate&quot; appreciated Rajinikanth&#x27;s characterisation in the film, calling the character, Saravanan&#x27;s ability to read minds &quot;well-trained&quot; before concluding, &quot;Rajinikanth&#x27;s movies are crammed with comedy, action, and musical numbers and they take great delight in kicking narrative logic in the face.&quot;

=== Box office ===
&quot;Chandramukhi&quot; was a box office success, selling 20 million tickets worldwide and earning 150 million in salary and profit share for Rajinikanth. The film&#x27;s distributors made a 20 per cent profit over the 25 million for which they bought the rights to the film. The film&#x27;s 804th day celebration function was held at Kamaraj Arangam in Chennai on 25 June 2007. The then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi, director K.

In an interview with &quot;The Hindu&quot;, Binny Krishnakumar said:


== Scientific accuracy ==
In an August 2005 seminar on revisiting psychiatric disorders which centred around &quot;Chandramukhi&quot; and &quot;Anniyan&quot;, psychiatrist Asokan noted that there were many logical faults in both films; Vasu said he knew nothing about psychiatric disorders. Writing for &quot;PopMatters&quot; in 2014, Kumuthan Maderya criticised Vasu for confusing &quot;spirit possession with Dissociative Identity Disorder, conflating both to create pop psychology&quot; and &quot;ostensibly fusing modern science and demonology for the sake of intellectualism&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Split personality disorder became well known after the film&#x27;s release. MIOT hospital, in a blog description of the syndrome, called it &quot;The Chandramukhi syndrome&quot;. Film artist, trainer and filmmaker L. Satyanand said &quot;Chandramukhi&quot; is a classic example of the subgenre &quot;horror of the demonic&quot; and of &quot;brilliance&quot;, ranking it alongside &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; and &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960). The film became a trendsetter for later horror films in Tamil such as the &quot;Muni&quot; series, &quot;Yavarum Nalam&quot; (2009), &quot;Eeram&quot; (2009), &quot;Pizza&quot; (2012), &quot;Yaamirukka Bayamey&quot; (2014), the &quot;Aranmanai&quot; series, &quot;Darling&quot; (2015) and &quot;Demonte Colony&quot; (2015).

Sivaji Productions joined Galatta Media and eBay for an online auction of the film&#x27;s memorabilia, becoming the first South Indian film to auction film merchandise. Ramkumar Ganesan said the proceeds of the auction would be given to the Sivaji Prabhu Charity Trust and that 300,000 (US$6,650 in 2005) would be given to Papanchatram Middle School. Sophie Atphthavel from France bought Rajinikanth&#x27;s sunglasses, which he sported in the film, for 25,000 (US$554 in 2005). According to Girish Ramdas, chief operating officer of Galatta Media, all the items had certificates of authenticity signed by the film&#x27;s producers. Bidding for the items ranged between 10,000 (US$222 in 2005) and 20,000 (US$444 in 2005).

In a statement by eBay, the articles made available for bidding were Rajinikanth&#x27;s blue shirt worn in the song &quot;Devuda Devuda&quot;, Jyothika&#x27;s saree worn for the climax scenes, the peach-coloured saree worn by Nayanthara in the song &quot;Konja Neram&quot;, and the Vettaiyan Raja costume and ornaments worn on set by Rajinikanth. Rajinikanth&#x27;s dress, which he wore in &quot;Devuda Devuda&quot;, was sold for 25,000 (US$554 in 2005). His Vettaiyan costume and ornament set were sold for 32,000 (US$709 in 2005).

== In popular culture ==
Some scenes, lines and expressions from the film, such as the &quot;Lakka Lakka...&quot; sound that Rajnikanth&#x27;s character makes, became very popular, especially with children. Vadivelu&#x27;s expressions and scenesespecially those with Rajinikanthand lines including &quot;Maapu?...Vachittandaa Aapu!!!&quot; (Dude?...He screwed me up!!!), also became popular. A line spoken by Rajinikanth to Prabhu, &quot;Naan gunda irundha nalla irukkadhu...nee elachcha nalla irukkadhu&quot;, which translates into &quot;I won&#x27;t look good if I put on weight...but you won&#x27;t look good if you have reduced weight&quot; evoked a lot of laughter among audiences.

Prabhu&#x27;s line, &quot;Enna kodumai Saravanan idhu?&quot; (What atrocity is this, Saravanan?) became popular. It is usually used to express irony or surprise. The line was often parodied by Premgi Amaren, who altered it slightly to &quot;Enna Kodumai Sir Idhu?&quot; (What atrocity is this, sir?) and used it in most of his featured films, subsequently becoming the actor&#x27;s catchphrase. Prabhu, in an interview with Malathi Rangarajan of &quot;The Hindu&quot;, expressed appreciation for the way his &quot;serious line&quot; was made into a comical one.

=== Parodies ===
&quot;Chandramukhi&quot; was parodied in various films. In a comedy scene from &quot;Englishkaran&quot; (2005), Theeppori Thirumugam (Vadivelu) invents an idea to frighten Thamizharasu (Sathyaraj) but the ruse backfires on him as he witnesses Thamizharasu in a garb similar to that of Chandramukhi&#x27;s. In the Telugu film &quot;Rajababu&quot; (2006), the characters played by Rajinikanth and Jyothika are renacted by Brahmanandam and Kovai Sarala, respectively. In a scene from &quot;Thalaimagan&quot; (2006), Erimalai (Vadivelu), after entering an old abandoned bungalow, gets frightened when he hears the &quot;Lakka Lakka&quot; sound, and says &quot;Yaaro Telugula Koopuddrangga!&quot; ( &quot;Someone is calling in Telugu!&quot;). In &quot;Vallavan&quot; (2006), Vallavan (Silambarasan) is seen singing &quot;Konja Neram&quot; to Swapna (Nayanthara). In &quot;&quot; (2007), Thamizhselvi (Shriya Saran) would be seen dancing for the song &quot;Raa Raa&quot;, Sivaji (Rajinikanth) and Arivu (Vivek) are seen uttering the last lines of the song. Livingston who appears as a police inspector, utters the sound &quot;Lakka Lakka&quot; which Rajinikanth makes in &quot;Chandramukhi&quot;. Rajinikanth and Nayanthara&#x27;s characters act in a film within a film titled &quot;Chandramukhi 2&quot; in a scene from &quot;Kuselan&quot; (2008), which P. Vasu also directed. In &quot;Padikkadavan&quot; (2009), Assault Arumugam (Vivek) imitates Rajinikanth&#x27;s tornado creating leg movement from the introduction scene when arriving in Andhra Pradesh. In &quot;Thamizh Padam&quot; (2010), Shiva (Shiva) would be seen imitating the film&#x27;s introduction scene by stretching his leg when it is revealed that Siva has a split seam in his pants. Sundar C&#x27;s role in the film &quot;Aranmanai&quot; (2014) was inspired by Rajinikanth&#x27;s role in &quot;Chandramukhi&quot;. &quot;Chandramukhi&quot; was parodied in the Star Vijay comedy series &quot;Lollu Sabha&quot;, in an episode named &quot;Chappamukhi&quot;.

== Other versions ==
&quot;Chandramukhi&quot; was dubbed in Turkish with the same title and in Bhojpuri under the title &quot;Chandramukhi Ke Hunkaar&quot;. It is the first Tamil film to be dubbed into German. It was released in Germany under the title, &quot;Der Geisterjäger&quot; (). Despite the release of &quot;Manichitrathazhu&quot;&#x27;s Hindi remake &quot;Bhool Bhulaiyaa&quot; in 2007 (which had the working title of &quot;Chandramukhi&quot;), &quot;Chandramukhi&#x27;s&quot; Hindi dubbed version was released in 2008.

== Sequel ==

In April 2020, a sequel, &quot;Chandramukhi 2&quot;, to be produced by Sun Pictures was announced, but was eventually taken over by Lyca Productions in June 2022, owing to the delays from the COVID-19 pandemic. P. Vasu returned as the director with confirmed cast members including Raghava Lawrence, Kangana Ranaut, Lakshmi Menon and Vadivelu. Principal photography began in mid-July 2022, and wrapped by mid-August 2023. The film released on 28 September 2023 and was a major commercial and critical failure.

== Spin off ==

A spin off to &quot;Chandramukhi&quot;, named &quot;Nagavalli&quot;, was made in Telugu. It was a remake of &quot;Aptharakshaka&quot; (2010), which itself was a direct sequel to &quot;Apthamitra&quot; (2004). It was directed by P. Vasu and released on 16 December 2010.

<doc id="1114332" wikidata="Q1447338" url="?curid=1114332" title="Kelso Abbey">
<text>Kelso Abbey is a ruined Scottish abbey in Kelso, Scotland. It was founded in the 12th century by a community of Tironensian monks first brought to Scotland in the reign of Alexander I. It occupies ground overlooking the confluence of the Tweed and Teviot waters, the site of what was once the Royal Burgh of Roxburgh and the intended southern centre for the developing Scottish kingdom at that time. Kelso thus became the seat of a pre-eminently powerful abbacy in the heart of the Scottish Borders.

In the 14th century, Roxburgh became a focus for periodic attack and occupation by English forces and Kelso&#x27;s monastic community survived a number of fluctuations in control over the area, restoring the abbey infrastructure after episodes of destruction and ultimately retaining Scottish identity. From 1460 onwards, life for the abbey probably grew more settled, but came once again under attack in the early sixteenth century. By the mid-century, through a combination of turbulent events, the abbey effectively ceased to function and the building fell into ruin.

Although the site of Kelso Abbey has not been fully excavated in modern times, evidence suggests that it was a major building with two crossings. The only remains standing today are the west tower crossing and part of the . The massive design and solid romanesque style of the tower indicate a very large building of formidable, semi-military construction and appearance, evidence of the importance with which Roxburgh was regarded when the abbacy was at the height of its power.

==Foundation==

Kelso Abbey was founded at Roxburgh in 1128 by a community of monks of the Tironesian order, from Tiron, near Chartres, in France. The community had first entered Scotland, c. 1113, under the patronage of David I as Prince of the Cumbrians during the reign of his brother, Alexander I, when the monks were given a commission to found their community at a site near Selkirk. It is not known for certain why the community came to abandon this first site in 1128, although David, now King of Scots, was developing Roxburgh as a major economic and administrative centre for Southern Scotland. Other institutions established by David at Roxburgh included the royal mint.

Construction of the abbey is believed to have commenced immediately, and by 1143 progress was sufficiently advanced for the building to be dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint John. The King&#x27;s son, Henry, Earl of Northumbria, who predeceased his father, was interred in the abbey in 1152.

==Development and defence==
Kelso Abbey, which was situated in sight of Roxburgh Castle across the Tweed water, soon grew to be one of the wealthiest and grandest in Scotland, with much of its income coming from its vast estates in the Border country. John, abbot of Kelso from 1160 to 1180, was the first abbot in Scotland to be granted the mitre.

After Scotland&#x27;s royal dynasty began to lose the overlordship of Northumbria, during the reign of William I, David&#x27;s southern &quot;capital&quot; came into close proximity to the border with England and was subject to attack during the Wars of Scottish Independence. In 1299, the abbot of Kelso was the English appointee, Thomas de Durham (1299–1307), but the abbey defended its Scottish identity. Throughout this turbulent period, Roxburgh Castle and Berwick upon Tweed, the major Scottish port serving the area, were frequently under English occupation. Whenever the abbey was subject to attack, the damage was repaired by the monks.

In 1460, James II was killed within sight of the abbey as the result of a fatal accident during the campaign which secured repossession of Roxburgh castle that same year. Kelso Abbey was the venue for the hasty coronation of the infant king, James III, which quickly followed. During the period from 1460 to 1513, political and military control in the area was more stable and life for the abbey was probably relatively settled. After 1517, however, it was again subject to English attacks.

==Sixteenth-century destruction==

Kelso Abbey effectively ceased to function due to a combination of events in the mid-sixteenth century. First, in the 1540s, the building sustained major damage in attacks perpetrated under the orders of the English king, Henry VIII, part of the so-called Rough Wooing, in which most of southern Scotland&#x27;s abbeys, including those at Melrose, Dryburgh and Jedburgh, were targeted for destruction by forces under the command of the Earl of Hertford. Plans to convert the Abbey into a bastion fort were prepared by Archangelo Arcano, an Italian military engineer working for Henry VIII.

This physical assault on the site was followed in 1560 by monastic disestablishment under the Scottish Reformation, from which time the Tironensian community at Kelso was no longer officially recognised. A small remaining contingent of monks may have continued at the site for a number of years following the 1560 dissolution, but after further attacks and damage the abbey was declared officially derelict in 1587. Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell had a house at the Abbey, and James VI visited in January 1591.

By the late 16th century the estates of the former monastery came under fully secular control and in 1607 they were finally granted as a secular lordship, titled Holydean, to the last commendator of the abbey, Robert Ker of Cesford.

==Post-reformation usage==
Between 1647 and 1771, part of the abbey ruins was occupied by a parish kirk, with other parts of the structure being dismantled and used as a source of stone by locals for buildings in the town of Kelso. The post-reformation kirk appears to have been a compact vaulted structure intruded within the west transepts in about 1748. This adapted structure included a vaulted gaol. 

In 1805, huge parts of the ruins were cleared away, including the parish church and the gaol, leaving only the abbey&#x27;s west tower and transept remaining to this day. A more recent addition (1933) has been a memorial cloister to the 8th Duke of Roxburghe designed by Reginald Fairlie in the original style of the cloisters when the abbey was first built.

==Architectural notes==
Little of the ground plan of this once large abbey exists, but the surviving ruin of the west tower, together with its crossing, is impressive and shows a building that was strong and fortress like. Evidence from Vatican archives, dated 1517, indicates that the complete building had two crossings, west and east, each with single towers, a double-cruciform design that was relatively rare in Europe. The high altar of the abbey would have been at the east tower crossing. Although the east end does not survive, it may have been in a rounded form if, as would be expected, the firm Romanesque design of the extant western tower was consistent throughout the building.

The gable of the north transept of the west tower crossing (pictured right) presents the most intact surviving face. The earliest remains of the abbey are the two bays of the south arcade of the nave (partly visible at the far left of the picture). These have rounded arches dating from about 1128. Later additions above this are a triforium from the late 12th Century, and above this clerestory is a continuous arcade. There is no regular vertical pattern between three levels of arcading, a feature which is unique in Scotland or England. The masonry above the clerestory suggests that there was no nave vaulting.

The south and west faces of the west tower still rise high to the level of the belfry openings and this structure is not earlier than the beginning of the 13th Century. The west transepts and the west vestibule also survive, though only the north jamb survives of the west crossing&#x27;s doorways.

In the 20th century, the &quot;Roxburghe Aisle&quot; was built onto the Abbey as the burial vault of the Dukes of Roxburghe.

==Burials==
* Prince Henry of Scotland (1114–1152), Earl of Northumbria and Huntingdon
* Several of the Dukes of Roxburghe and members of their family.

==Access==
The ruins are cared for by Historic Scotland. There is no entrance charge.

==Tourism==
This Abbey is one of five abbeys and historic sites in southern Scotland which lie on the Borders Abbeys Way walk.

<text>Hydrogen bromide is the inorganic compound with the formula . It is a hydrogen halide consisting of hydrogen and bromine. A colorless gas, it dissolves in water, forming hydrobromic acid, which is saturated at 68.85% HBr by weight at room temperature. Aqueous solutions that are 47.6% HBr by mass form a constant-boiling azeotrope mixture that boils at . Boiling less concentrated solutions releases H2O until the constant-boiling mixture composition is reached.

Hydrogen bromide, and its aqueous solution, hydrobromic acid, are commonly used reagents in the preparation of bromide compounds.

==Reactions==
===Organic chemistry===
Hydrogen bromide and hydrobromic acid are important reagents in the production of organobromine compounds. In an electrophilic addition reaction, HBr adds to alkenes:
The resulting alkyl bromides are useful alkylating agents, e.g., as precursors to fatty amine derivatives. Related free radical additions to allyl chloride and styrene give 1-bromo-3-chloropropane and phenylethylbromide, respectively.

Hydrogen bromide reacts with dichloromethane to give bromochloromethane and dibromomethane, sequentially:
: 
These metathesis reactions illustrate the consumption of the stronger acid (HBr) and release of the weaker acid (HCl).

Allyl bromide is prepared by treating allyl alcohol with HBr:

HBr adds to alkynes to yield bromoalkenes. The stereochemistry of this type of addition is usually &quot;anti&quot;:
: RC≡CH + HBr → RC(Br)=CH2

Also, HBr adds epoxides and lactones, resulting in ring-opening.

With triphenylphosphine, HBr gives triphenylphosphonium bromide, a solid &quot;source&quot; of HBr.

===Inorganic chemistry===
Vanadium(III) bromide and molybdenum(IV) bromide were prepared by treatment of the higher chlorides with HBr. These reactions proceed via redox reactions:

==Industrial preparation==
Hydrogen bromide (along with hydrobromic acid) is produced by combining hydrogen and bromine at temperatures between 200 and 400 °C. The reaction is typically catalyzed by platinum or asbestos.

==Laboratory synthesis==
HBr can be prepared by distillation of a solution of sodium bromide or potassium bromide with phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid:
: KBr + H2SO4 → KHSO4 + HBr

Concentrated sulfuric acid is less effective because it oxidizes HBr to bromine:
: 2 HBr + H2SO4 → Br2 + SO2 + 2 H2O

The acid may be prepared by:
* reaction of bromine with water and sulfur:
*: 2 Br2 + S + 2 H2O → 4 HBr + SO2
* bromination of tetralin:
*: C10H12 + 4 Br2 → C10H8Br4 + 4 HBr
* reduction of bromine with phosphorous acid:
*: Br2 + H3PO3 + H2O → H3PO4 + 2 HBr
Anhydrous hydrogen bromide can also be produced on a small scale by thermolysis of triphenylphosphonium bromide in refluxing xylene.

Hydrogen bromide prepared by the above methods can be contaminated with Br2, which can be removed by passing the gas through a solution of phenol at room temperature in tetrachloromethane or other suitable solvent (producing 2,4,6-tribromophenol and generating more HBr in the process) or through copper turnings or copper gauze at high temperature.

==Safety==
HBr is highly corrosive and, if inhaled, can cause lung damage.

<text>María Raquenel Portillo Jiménez (born 23 December 1969), also known as Mary Boquitas, is a Mexican singer and actress. She was born in Tamaulipas.

In the early 1980s, she auditioned with tycoon music producer to be a singer, with whom she married when she was 15 years old. In 1985, Andrade formed a girl group, managed by himself. Portillo was chosen for the group; the name &quot;Boquitas Pintadas&quot; was chosen because it sounded very different from the names of other typical teenage bands of the era, many of which tried to copy Menudo with their name. Because of the band&#x27;s name, Mary Raquenel Portillo later became known as &quot;Mary Boquitas&quot;.

Gloria Trevi was another member of the band. &quot;Boquitas Pintadas&quot; had five members in total; however, it was Trevi and Portillo who were able to forge a friendship that went beyond their days at &quot;Boquitas Pintadas&quot;. She continued living with Sergio Andrade, and was a backup singer at Gloria Trevi&#x27;s performances as well. She and Andrade got divorced in 1990. Nevertheless, she kept on living with him in spite of the fact that he married 15 years-old Aline Hernández and also that he had formed a &quot;harem&quot; made of young girls who lived together with him, including Gloria Trevi, who attempted to become superstars thanks to Sergio Andrade. 

In 1994 Sony Music International released her first solo album, produced by Andrade, named &quot;Mary Boquitas&quot; and from that album the song &quot;A Contratiempo&quot;, which was a successful single in Mexico staying many weeks in first place on radio stations, became a favorite song till now in Mexico. Mary Boquitas was considered one of the best singers in Mexico and Latin America at the time.

In 2000, Raquenel was arrested and imprisoned in Brazil along with Sergio Andrade and Gloria Trevi. She was accused of corruption of minors. Furthermore, she was believed to be Sergio Andrade&#x27;s accomplice in the rape of teenager Karina Yapor, who got pregnant by him. She was further accused of abandoning Karina&#x27;s son in Spain (under de command of Andrade). Moreover, in Brazil she was also accused of quartering the corpse of Gloria Trevi&#x27;s dead daughter before being thrown in a river (all by order of Andrade), who died mysteriously thirty-three days after she was born. However, Raquenel and Gloria were absolved in 2004 and were released. 

In November 2004 she was invited by Carmen Salinas (one of the most important actress and producer in Mexico) to be a part of the play &quot;Aventurera&quot;. Boquitas from then until now (2008) is one of the principal stars in the play (as an actress, dancer and singer).

In 2009 she released a new album titled &quot;Para Olvidarte&quot;. Boquitas was &quot;Martina&quot;, a successful role in the soap opera &quot;Muchachitas como tú&quot; in Mexico and now playing in US. She won two awards for that role.

She was Laura in a comedy video home in Mexico; and now is coming soon on cinema the action movie &quot;Like Brothers&quot; where she has the first role.

In 2008 she composed and sang on a new album produced by Joan Romagoza, a Spanish composer and producer.

In 2016, she starred in the We TV (U.S. TV channel) series &quot;My Life is a Telenovela&quot;.

In 2017 she released the single &quot;Una Nueva Mujer&quot; which met moderate success in YouTube.

<doc id="1114361" wikidata="Q8031728" url="?curid=1114361" title="Wonder Acres, Kern County, California">
<text>Wonder Acres is a settlement in the western Mojave Desert, within eastern Kern County, southern California, in the United States.

It is located northeast of the city of Mojave, on California State Route 14 at the intersection with California City Boulevard. It is west of California City, and east of Cache Creek.

==History==
The development began when a Mr. Wonder drilled for oil (ca. 1950) and found water. He then subdivided the land into lots, supplied them with piped water, and sold them.

In the 1960s Robert W. Shaneyfelt made the settlement name well known when he painted the name of the settlement on the community water tank on California City Boulevard.

The main street in Wonder Acres is named &quot;Janice Street&quot;. Margaret Shaneyfelt was primarily responsible for negotiating with the affected parties to arrive with this as an agreeable compromise.

==Services==
Wonder Acres is served by the Mojave Post Office, and is most closely associated with Mojave for services.

Its area code is 760, the same as nearby California City. During most of the latter 20th century, Wonder Acres was in the Mojave Unified School District, and the Tehachapi Cemetery District.

<doc id="1114367" wikidata="Q5286948" url="?curid=1114367" title="Optical parametric amplifier">
<text>An optical parametric amplifier, abbreviated OPA, is a laser light source that emits light of variable wavelengths by an optical parametric amplification process. It is essentially the same as an optical parametric oscillator, but without the optical cavity (i.e., the light beams pass through the apparatus just once or twice, rather than many many times).

==Optical parametric generation (OPG)==

Optical parametric generation (OPG) (also called &quot;optical parametric fluorescence&quot;, or &quot;spontaneous parametric down conversion&quot;) often precedes optical parametric amplification.

In optical parametric generation, the input is one light beam of frequency ωp, and the output is two light beams of lower frequencies ωs and ωi, with the requirement ωp=ωs+ωi. These two lower-frequency beams are called the &quot;signal&quot; and &quot;idler&quot;, respectively.

This light emission is based on the nonlinear optical principle. The photon of an incident laser pulse (pump) is, by a nonlinear optical crystal, divided into two lower-energy photons. The wavelengths of the signal and the idler are determined by the phase matching condition, which is changed, e.g. by temperature or, in bulk optics, by the angle between the incident pump laser ray and the optical axes of the crystal. The wavelengths of the signal and the idler photons can, therefore, be tuned by changing the phase matching condition.

==Optical parametric amplification (OPA)==

The output beams in optical parametric generation are usually relatively weak and have relatively spread-out direction and frequency. This problem is solved by using optical parametric amplification (OPA), also called difference frequency generation, as a second stage after the OPG.

In an OPA, the input is &quot;two&quot; light beams, of frequency ωp and ωs. The OPA will make the pump beam (ωp) weaker, and &quot;amplify&quot; the signal beam (ωs), and also create a new, so-called idler beam at the frequency ωi with ωp=ωs+ωi.

In the OPA, the pump and idler photons usually travel collinearly through a nonlinear optical crystal. Phase matching is required for the process to work well.

Because the wavelengths of an OPG+OPA system can be varied (unlike most lasers which have a fixed wavelength), they are used in many spectroscopic methods.

As an example of OPA, the incident pump pulse is the 800 nm (12500 cm−1) output of a Ti:sapphire laser, and the two outputs, signal and idler, are in the near-infrared region, the sum of the wavenumber of which is equal to 12500 cm−1.

==Noncollinear OPA (NOPA)==
Because most nonlinear crystals are birefringent, beams that are collinear inside a crystal may not be collinear outside of it. The phase fronts (wave vector) do not point in the same direction as the energy flow (Poynting vector) because of walk-off.

The phase matching angle makes possible any gain at all (0th order). In a collinear setup, the freedom to choose the center wavelength allows a constant gain up to first order in wavelength. Noncollinear OPAs were developed to have an additional degree of freedom, allowing constant gain up to second order in wavelength. The optimal parameters are 4 degrees of noncollinearity, β-barium borate (BBO) as the material, a 400-nm pump wavelength, and signal around 800 nm (and can be tunable in the range 605-750 nm with sub-10 fs pulse width which allows exploring the ultrafast dynamics of large molecules) This generates a bandwidth 3 times as large of that of a Ti-sapphire-amplifier. The first order is mathematically equivalent to some properties of the group velocities involved, but this does not mean that pump and signal have the same group velocity. After propagation through 1-mm BBO, a short pump pulse no longer overlaps with the signal. Therefore, chirped pulse amplification must be used in situations requiring large gain amplification in long crystals. Long crystals introduce such a large chirp that a compressor is needed anyway. An extreme chirp can lengthen a 20-fs seed pulse to 50 ps, making it suitable for use as the pump. Unchirped 50-ps pulses with high energy can be generated from rare earth-based lasers.

The optical parametric amplifier has a wider bandwidth than a -amplifier, which in turn has a wider bandwidth than an optical parametric oscillator because of white-light generation even one octave wide (for example using nonlinear self-phase modulation in neon gas). Therefore, a subband can be selected and fairly short pulses can still be generated.

The higher gain per mm for BBO compared to Ti:Sa and, more importantly, lower amplified spontaneous emission allows for higher overall gain.
Interlacing compressors and OPA leads to tilted pulses.

==Multipass OPA==
Multipass can be used for
walk off and group velocity (dispersion) compensation;
constant intensity with increasing signal power means to have an exponential rising cross section. This can be done by means of lenses, which also refocus the beams to have the beam waist in the crystal;
reduction of OPG by increasing the pump power proportional to the signal and splitting the pump across the passes of the signal;
broadband amplification by dumping the idler and optionally individually detuning the crystals;
complete pump depletion by offsetting the pump and signal in time and space at every pass and feeding one pump pulse through all passes;
high gain with BBO, since BBO is only available in small dimensions. 
Since the direction of the beams is fixed, multiple passes cannot be overlapped into a single small crystal like in a Ti:Sa amplifier. Unless one uses noncolinear geometry and adjusts amplified beams onto the parametric fluorescence cone produced by the pump pulse.

== Relationship to parametric amplifiers in electronics==

The idea of parametric amplification first arose at much lower frequencies: AC circuits, including radio frequency and microwave frequency (in the earliest investigations, sound waves were also studied). In these applications, typically a strong pump signal (or &quot;local oscillator&quot;) at frequency &quot;f&quot; passes through a circuit element whose parameters are modulated by the weak &quot;signal&quot; wave at frequency &quot;f&quot;s (for example, the signal might modulate the capacitance of a varactor diode). The result is that some of the energy of the local oscillator gets transferred to the signal frequency &quot;f&quot;s, as well as the difference (&quot;idler&quot;) frequency &quot;f&quot;-&quot;f&quot;s. The term &quot;parametric&quot; amplifier is used because the &quot;parameters&quot; of the circuit are varied.

The optical case uses the same basic principle—transferring energy from a wave at the pump frequency to waves at the signal and idler frequencies—so it took the same name.

<text>The Pyramid (orig. Swedish &quot;Pyramiden&quot;) is a collection of five short stories by Swedish crime fiction author Henning Mankell, first published in Sweden in 1999 and translated into English in 2008. It features his best-known character, police inspector Kurt Wallander.

While it was written after the 8th novel, &quot;Firewall&quot;, the events depicted in &quot;The Pyramid&quot; take place well before &quot;Faceless Killers&quot;, making it chronologically the first in the series. The first story takes place in 1969 while the last occurs in 1989-90.

The English translation of the titles for each of the short stories is:
*&quot;Wallander&#x27;s First Case&quot; 
*&quot;The Man with the Mask&quot; 
*&quot;The Man at the Beach&quot;
*&quot;The Death of the Photographer&quot;
*&quot;The Pyramid&quot;

==Adaptation==

In 2007, Swedish public broadcaster Sveriges Television in association with Tre Vänner Produktion produced a 90-minute straight-to-video adaptation of &quot;The Pyramid&quot;, starring Rolf Lassgård as the older Wallander and Gustaf Skarsgård as the younger Wallander.

<text>David Edward Godin (21 June 1936 – 15 October 2004) was an English fan of American soul music. As a journalist and record shop owner, he made a major contribution internationally in spreading awareness and understanding of the genre, and by extension African-American culture, through his promotion of Motown and other R&amp;B artists, and by establishing the term &quot;Northern soul&quot;. He also worked as an arts centre manager.

==Biography==
Born in Peckham, London, the son of a milkman, Dave Godin spent his early childhood in Peckham before bombing forced the family to move to Bexleyheath, Kent, where he won a scholarship to Dartford Grammar School. Godin began collecting American R&amp;B records when at school, where he encouraged the younger Mick Jagger&#x27;s interest in black American music. He said: &quot;..It was at Dartford Grammar School that I met Mick Jagger and introduced him to black music, I&#x27;m ashamed to say. It&#x27;s ironic that as a result of meeting me he&#x27;s where he is today.&quot; Godin played a minor role in the early jam sessions out of which the Rolling Stones emerged, but resented Jagger for what he saw as the Stones&#x27; exploitation of black music.

After working at an advertising agency, and as a hospital porter in place of National Service (he was a conscientious objector), Godin founded the Tamla Motown Appreciation Society, and in time was recruited by Berry Gordy to become Motown&#x27;s consultant in the UK, setting up its distribution through EMI. At a recording of &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; in 1964, Jagger asked Godin to introduce him to Marvin Gaye. &quot;I told him to fuck off and introduce himself&quot;, Godin recalled.

In 1967 he founded Soul City, a record shop which in 1967 developed into a record label on which he released such then-obscure soul classics as &quot;Go Now&quot; by Bessie Banks, with colleague David Nathan and friend Robert Blackmore. It was in their shop that Godin coined the term &#x27;northern soul&#x27;, a description that he would popularise through his work as a music journalist. In a 2002 interview with Chris Hunt of &quot;Mojo&quot;, he explained that he had first come up with the term in 1968 as a sales reference to help staff in his shop differentiate the more modern funkier sounds from the smoother, Motown-influenced soul of a few years earlier:
&quot;I had started to notice that northern football fans who were in London to follow their team were coming into the store to buy records, but they weren&#x27;t interested in the latest developments in the black American chart. I devised the name as a shorthand sales term. It was just to say ‘if you’ve got customers from the north, don&#x27;t waste time playing them records currently in the US black chart, just play them what they like – ‘Northern Soul’.&quot;

In his career he also coined the term Deep Soul and he promoted the interests of a large number of American musicians whose work had fallen out of favour in their home country.

His second career was in cinema exhibition. Having studied art, design and film course at Sheffield Polytechnic, he became a senior film officer for the British Film Institute and helped found and was the manager of the Anvil Cinema, Sheffield (1983–90), the only cinema in the UK to be funded by a local authority.

In the mid 1990s he started to compile a series of CDs of rare (and some not so rare) recordings – &quot;Dave Godin&#x27;s Deep Soul Treasures&quot; – for Ace Records, which featured such artists as Loretta Williams, Eddie and Ernie, Jaibi, Ruby Johnson and Jimmy and Louise Tig. The four albums were greeted with universal critical acclaim, and Godin described the series as the proudest achievement of his life. A fifth, posthumous, volume was ultimately released in 2019, based on lists of tracks he had considered for inclusion, including material intended for the four previous volumes, for which licensing rights could not be obtained at the time.

Godin, a vegan, was an advocate of animal rights and Esperanto. He was also known for his involvement in anarchist and anti-capitalist organisations, including &quot;Freedom Newspaper&quot; and &quot;Class War&quot;. He was the only atheist in his local pro-life organisation. Towards the end of his life he developed an interest in Jainism. He died in Rotherham in 2004, aged 68.

A biography, &quot;Dave Godin: a Northern Soul&quot; by Stephen Stevlor, was published in 2020 on the anniversary of Godin&#x27;s death.

As a memorial to Godin, a blue plaque was unveiled in November 2024, at the former site of the Anvil arts cinema in Sheffield.

<doc id="1114388" wikidata="Q226696" url="?curid=1114388" title="Zoran Živković (politician)">
<text>Zoran Živković (, ; born 22 December 1960) is a Serbian politician who served as the prime minister of Serbia from 2003 to 2004 and as the mayor of Niš from 1997 to 2000.

He played a significant role during the protests and the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević. After the assassination of Zoran Đinđić, he headed the government of Serbia for a year. His reign was marked by a state of emergency period and the Operation Sabre, an action aimed at finding those responsible for political assassinations and combating organized crime. Živković later formed the liberal New Party and served as its president until his resignation in 2020. After that, he became executive director of the Center for development of civil society MilenijuM.

==Early life and education==
Živković was born in Niš, Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia where he attended High School Bora Stanković, subsequently enrolling at the Belgrade Business School, where he received a Diploma in Economics and Social science. He worked as an entrepreneur before engaging in politics.

==Political career==

===Early years===
Zoran Živković entered politics in 1992 by joining the Democratic Party (DS) and became a member of Serbian Parliament and the party&#x27;s Deputy Leader under the leadership of Zoran Đinđić. In late 1996, Živković lead the civil protests of the opposition against the electoral fraud in Niš and became the first democratic Mayor of Niš in 1997.

===2000–2004===
In 2000, Živković contributed greatly to the mobilization of the democratic opposition of Serbia during October 5 overthrow of Milošević from power.

In November 2000, Živković became the Federal Minister of Interior of FR Yugoslavia and served until 2003, when the position was abolished following the constitutional formation of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.

After the assassination of Zoran Đinđić, Živković was elected as the 7th Prime Minister of Serbia and decisively lead his reformist Government through the state of emergency period and promoted offensive measures on cracking down organized crime and corruption, but his Government collapsed as a consequence of the controversial arrests, government scandals, and unrest within the coalition. After eleven months of heading the Government of Serbia, weakening public support saw Živković stepping down from the Democratic Party leadership position, following the loss of power in parliamentary elections held in December 2003 and successful challenge for party leadership by Boris Tadić, who emerged as the new leader. Živković was pushed to the sidelines within Democratic Party, as he never got on with the new party leadership under Boris Tadić.

===2004–present===
Following a loss of power in 2004, Živković formed a non-governmental organization Milenijum - Center for Development of Civil Society, as a channel for his desire to &quot;modify the consciousness of Serbian citizens related to the need of involving each individual into ongoing process of changes&quot;. During that period Živković was often linked in the media to another Democratic Party outcast Čedomir Jovanović who was vocally critical of the DS direction under the new leadership, but the two never really formed any kind of common political plan of action. Regarding his involvement with the Democratic Party, Živković claimed that he is &quot;only a member&quot; in spite of some views who saw his potential comeback to the party&#x27;s Executive Board.

During this period, Živković was still present in public life, making occasional appearances on political talk shows, commenting on his past days with Zoran Đinđić and criticizing the lack of reformist agenda in the Government of Vojislav Koštunica.

Disappointed that the Democratic Party did not include him on their 250 candidates list for the 2007 parliamentary elections, he basically left active politics only to emerge to prior to the general elections in May 2012 actively opposing Boris Tadić&#x27;s re-election as the President of Serbia and blaming him for the DS loss of power in May 2012.

In November 2012, he left Democratic Party after 20 years of membership, stating that he intends to form a new party in early 2013 which would continue the reform process, modernization of Serbia and the actions launched by DS, which were interrupted in early 2004.

==Personal life==
Zoran Živković is married to Biserka, a lawyer and political activist. 
The couple live in Niš with their two children, Milena and Marko.

Živković is an avid wine enthusiast and a passionate driver. Živković was the owner of winery &quot;House of wines Živković&quot;.

<doc id="1114401" wikidata="Q1268586" url="?curid=1114401" title="List of districts of Tamil Nadu">
<text>The Indian state of Tamil Nadu is divided into 38 districts. Districts are the major administrative divisions of a state and are further sub-divided into smaller taluks.

During the British Raj, 12 districts of the erstwhile Madras Presidency had their boundaries within the present-day Tamil Nadu. Post the Indian Independence in 1947 and the political integration, the Madras Province inherited parts of the earlier Madras Presidency. Following the adoption of the Constitution of India in 1950, the Madras State was formed, which was further reorganized in 1953 and 1956. After the reorganization of Indian states in 1956, the state had 13 re-organized districts, which were further divided later over the years.

Between 1960 and 1980, three additional districts were formed. In the late eighties, five more districts were bifurcated from existing districts. Ten more districts were formed in the nineties, taking the total count to 30. Three new districts were bifurcated in the 2000s. In 2019–20, five more districts were formed for a total of 38 districts.

== History ==
=== Before 1947 ===

During the British Raj, the Madras Presidency was made up of 26 districts, 12 of which were part of the boundaries of the present-day Tamil Nadu, namely, Chingleput, Coimbatore, Nilgiris, North Arcot, Madras, Madura, Ramnad, Salem, South Arcot, Tanjore, Tinnevely, and Trichinopoly.

===1947–56 ===
After the Indian Independence on 15 August 1947, the Madras Presidency became the Madras Province of the Dominion of India. The princely state of Pudukottai acceded to the Indian Union on 4 March 1948 and was made as a part of the Trichinopoly district. When the new Constitution of India came into force on 26 January 1950, the Madras Province became the Madras State of the Republic of India. The Madras State included most of the present-day Tamil Nadu, Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions of the present-day Andhra Pradesh, the Malabar region of the present-day Kerala, Bellary and South Canara districts of the present-day Karnataka. The Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions were separated to form the new Andhra State in 1953.

As a result of the re-organization of states in 1956, South Canara and Bellary districts were merged with Mysore State, which became Karnataka and the Malabar district was added to the State of Travancore-Cochin to form Kerala. The Tamil speaking regions of Kanyakumari, which were earlier part of Travancore-Cochin, were merged to the Madras State. After the reorganisation, the Madras state had 13 districts namely: Chingleput, Coimbatore, Kanyakumari, Madras, Madurai, Nilgiris, North Arcot, Ramanathapuram, Salem, South Arcot, Thanjavur, Tiruchirappalli and Tirunelveli.

<text>Azo compounds are organic compounds bearing the functional group diazenyl (, in which R and R′ can be either aryl or alkyl groups). 

IUPAC defines azo compounds as: &quot;Derivatives of diazene (diimide), , wherein both hydrogens are substituted by hydrocarbyl groups, e.g. azobenzene or diphenyldiazene.&quot;, where Ph stands for phenyl group. The more stable derivatives contain two aryl groups. The group is called an &quot;azo group&quot; (, ).

Many textile and leather articles are dyed with azo dyes and pigments.

==Aryl azo compounds==
Aryl azo compounds are usually stable, crystalline species. Azobenzene is the prototypical aromatic azo compound. It exists mainly as the &quot;trans&quot; isomer, but upon illumination, converts to the &quot;cis&quot; isomer.

Aromatic azo compounds can be synthesized by azo coupling, which entails an electrophilic substitution reaction where an aryl diazonium cation is attacked by another aryl ring, especially those substituted with electron-donating groups: 

Since diazonium salts are often unstable near room temperature, the azo coupling reactions are typically conducted near 0 °C. The oxidation of hydrazines () also gives azo compounds. Azo dyes are also prepared by the condensation of nitroaromatics with anilines followed by reduction of the resulting azoxy intermediate:
:
For textile dying, a typical nitro coupling partner would be disodium 4,4′-dinitrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate. Typical aniline partners are shown below.
As a consequence of &quot;π&quot;-delocalization, aryl azo compounds have vivid colors, especially reds, oranges, and yellows. Therefore, they are used as dyes, and are commonly known as azo dyes, an example of which is Disperse Orange 1. Some azo compounds, e.g., methyl orange, are used as acid-base indicators due to the different colors of their acid and salt forms. Most DVD-R/+R and some CD-R discs use blue azo dye as the recording layer. The commercial success of azo dyes motivated the development of azo compounds in general.

==Alkyl azo compounds==

Aliphatic azo compounds (R and/or R′ = aliphatic) are less commonly encountered than the aryl azo compounds. A commercially important alkyl azo compound is azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), which is widely used as an initiator in free-radical polymerizations and other radical-induced reactions. It achieves this initiation by decomposition, eliminating a molecule of nitrogen gas to form two 2-cyanoprop-2-yl radicals:
For instance a mixture of styrene and maleic anhydride in toluene will react if heated, forming the copolymer upon addition of AIBN.

A simple dialkyl diazo compound is diethyldiazene, , which can be synthesized through a variant of the Ramberg–Bäcklund reaction. Because of their instability, aliphatic azo compounds pose the risk of explosion.

AIBN is produced by converting acetone cyanohydrin to the hydrazine derivative followed by oxidation:
:

==Safety and regulation==
Many azo pigments are non-toxic, although some, such as dinitroaniline orange, ortho-nitroaniline orange, or pigment orange 1, 2, and 5 have been found to be mutagenic. Likewise, several case studies have linked azo pigments with basal cell carcinoma.

===European regulation===
Certain azo dyes can break down under reductive conditions to release any of a group of defined aromatic amines. Consumer goods which contain listed aromatic amines originating from azo dyes were prohibited from manufacture and sale in European Union countries in September 2003. As only a small number of dyes contained an equally small number of amines, relatively few products were affected.

<text>Llanrhystud () is a seaside village, community and electoral division on the A487 road in the county of Ceredigion, in Wales, 9 miles (14 km) south of Aberystwyth, and 7 miles (11 km) north of Aberaeron. It takes its name from an early Welsh saint. The community includes the village of Llanddeiniol.

The &quot;Cofiwch Dryweryn&quot; stone wall (meaning: &quot;Remember Tryweryn&quot;) lies on the A487 a mile north of the village.

==History==
The village is named after the early Christian Welsh St Rhystyd, to whom the local Church in Wales (Anglican) church is dedicated. Rhystyd was among missionaries who arrived from Armorica in the 6th century.

According to a leaflet in the Ceredigion Archives:

The first mention of an incumbent is of Griffith Powell, who &quot;on July 24th 1582 was a witness before the Court Leet at Aberystwyth&quot;. The document adds that Powell had been &quot;in 1544 appointed priest-in-charge of Llanrhystud at the yearly stipend of five pounds&quot;.

A castle once existed nearby.

==Amenities==
The village has a primary school, Ysgol Wirfoddol Myfenydd. It also has a memorial hall, which contains a memorial table to the local fallen in the two World Wars.

The village lies on the Ceredigion Coast Path, part of the Wales Coast Path.

There is a public house, the Black Lion, which also serves meals.

The village was once served by Llanrhystyd Road railway station, on the now dismantled Carmarthen–Aberystwyth line, nearly 7 miles (11.3 km) up the A487 road at the larger village of Llanfarian.

==Population==
The village had a population of 646 as of the 2011 census, and the wider community, 966. The electoral ward stretches beyond the confines of Llanrhystud to include the village of Llangwyryfon. It has a total population of 1,562.

==Notable people==
*David Evans (died 1910), Archdeacon of St Asaph
*David Edward Lewis (1866–1941), businessman and philanthropist in Australia

<doc id="1114435" wikidata="Q6897848" url="?curid=1114435" title="Monad (Gnosticism)">
<text>In some Gnostic systems, the supreme being is known as the Monad, [[Neoplatonism#The One|the One]], [[Absolute (philosophy)|the Absolute]], Aiōn Teleos (the Perfect Aeon, ), Bythos (Depth or Profundity, ), Proarchē (Before the Beginning, ), Hē Archē (The Beginning, ), the Ineffable Parent, and/or the primal Father. The Monad is an adaptation of concepts of the monad in Greek philosophy to Christian belief systems.

The &quot;Apocryphon of John&quot;, written , gives the following description:
==Historical background==
The term &quot;monad&quot; comes from the Greek feminine noun &quot;monas&quot; (nominative singular, μονάς), &quot;one unit,&quot; where the ending &quot;-s&quot; in the nominative form resolves to the ending &quot;-d&quot; in declension.

Prominent early Christian gnostics like Valentinus taught that the Monad is the high source of the Pleroma, the region of light constituting &quot;the fullness of the Godhead.&quot; Through a process of emanation, various divine entities and realms emerge from the One. Arranged hierarchically, they become progressively degraded due to their remoteness from the Father. The various emanations of the One, totaling thirty in number (or 365, according to Basilides), are called Aeons. Among them exist Jesus (who resides close to the Father) and the lowest emanation, Sophia (wisdom), whose fall results in the creation of the material world.

According to Theodoret&#x27;s book on heresies (&quot;Haereticarum Fabularum Compendium&quot; i.18), the Arab Christian Monoimus (c. 150–210) used the term Monad to mean the highest god that created lesser gods, or elements (similar to Aeons). In some versions of Christian gnosticism, especially those deriving from Valentinius, a lesser deity known as the Demiurge (see also Neoplatonism, Plotinus) had a role in the creation of the material world separate from the Monad. In these forms of gnosticism, the God of the Old Testament, YHWH, is often considered to have been the Demiurge, not the Monad, or sometimes different passages are interpreted as referring to each.

According to Hippolytus of Rome, this view was inspired by the Pythagoreans, for whom the first existing thing was the Monad, which begat the dyad, which begat the numbers, which begat the point, begetting lines, and so on. Pythagorean and Platonic philosophers like Plotinus and Porphyry condemned the &quot;gnosis&quot; that would later characterize Gnostic systems for their treatment of the Monad or One (see Neoplatonism and Gnosticism).

For a long time, legend persisted that a young man by the name of Epiphanes, who died at the age of 17, was the leader of Monadic Gnosticism. However, scholars think the legend may have come from misunderstanding of the Greek word &quot;epiphanēs&quot; which may have been mistaken as a personal name if in text, when in fact the Greek means &quot;distinguished&quot;, as in a &quot;distinguished teacher.&quot;
