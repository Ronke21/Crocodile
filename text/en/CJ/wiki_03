<text>Wyke Regis is a village in the civil parish of Weymouth, in south Dorset, England. The village is part of the south western suburbs of Weymouth, on the northern shore of Portland Harbour and the south-eastern end of Chesil Beach. Wyke is south of the county town, Dorchester. The village has a population of around 5,500.

==History==
All Saints&#x27; Church in the village is known to have been frequented by King George III during his summer visits to Weymouth between 1790 and 1805. The church was the main place of worship for Weymouth citizens until the first sizeable church was built in the main part of the town in the 19th century. The victims of the wrecks of the East Indiaman ship &quot;Earl of Abergavenny&quot;, including its captain John Wordsworth, brother of poet William Wordsworth, are buried in the churchyard, as are bodies recovered from &quot;Alexander&quot;. Construction of the church started around 1451; it took four years to build and was dedicated on 19 October 1455. The church is constructed of local stone brought from quarries on Portland and at Upwey.

Thanks to treacherous local currents and the long sweep of Chesil Beach on which many ships ran aground, the village, as well as the neighbouring Isle of Portland gained a reputation for both smuggling and the looting of wrecks. This reputation is reflected today in the name of a local public house, the Wyke Smugglers previously known as the Wyke Hotel.

Located close to the Fleet Lagoon of Chesil Beach is the Wyke Regis Training Area.

In 1931 the civil parish had a population of 4378. On 1 April 1933 the parish was abolished and merged with Weymouth and Chickerell.

==Industry==
The major industry in the area was Whitehead Torpedo Works, which has now closed. As the major employer in the village, Whitehead&#x27;s funded the building of two schools, which opened in 1897. Whitehead&#x27;s expertise also led to the Royal Naval establishment at Portland becoming a major anti-submarine and torpedo warfare centre in both the First and Second World Wars. The Whitehead site is now a housing estate.
It later became Vickers Armstrong, Wellworthys and finally AE Piston Products.

In 2018 London based theatre company The Pensive Federation, inspired by artistic director Neil J. Byden&#x27;s family and upbringing in Wyke and his parents connections to the factory, set their annual new writing festival in the fictional factory of Reseal9. Significant Other Inc. was performed at The Vault Theatre in Waterloo.

==Schools==
Wyke Regis Infant school is situated along Portland Road, while Wyke Regis Junior school is on the High Street. There is a Nursery school within the grounds of the Infant school. 
All Saints Church of England Academy is a secondary school situated on the Portland Road. The school is a Church of England school.

== Politics ==
Wyke Regis is part of South Dorset constituency for elections to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.

Wyke Regis is part of the Rodwell and Wyke ward for elections to Dorset Council.

==Climate==
==Location==

Wyke Regis looks over Chesil Beach and the Fleet lagoon to the west, the Isle of Portland to the south and Portland Harbour to the south and east. The South West Coast Path passes around the coast of the village, which is also around halfway along the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site.

<doc id="1079443" wikidata="Q1213862" url="?curid=1079443" title="Yetminster">
<text>Yetminster is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset. It lies south-west of Sherborne. It is sited on the River Wriggle, a tributary of the River Yeo, and is built almost entirely of honey-coloured limestone, which gives the village an appearance reminiscent of Cotswold villages. In the 2011 census the civil parish had a population of 1,105.

==History==

In 1086 in the Domesday Book Yetminster was recorded as &quot;Etiminstre&quot;; it had 76 households, 26 ploughlands, of meadow and 2 mills. It was in Yetminster Hundred and the tenant-in-chief was the Bishop of Salisbury.

The parish church of St Andrew has Saxon origins, though only part of a 10th-century standing cross remains from that period; the current building dates mostly from the mid-15th century, though the chancel was built around 1300 and the whole church was restored in 1890 and several times subsequently.

In 1300 the bishop of Salisbury founded a weekly market and three-day annual fair in the village. Records do not state whether the market thrived, but the fair continued until the 19th century. It was revived in the 20th century, and today takes place on the second Saturday in July.

Robert Boyle, pioneer of modern chemistry who is best known for Boyle&#x27;s law, left an endowment for the provision of a school for poor boys in the district; the building was constructed in 1697 and functioned as a school between 1711 and 1945.

In the early 19th century, several buildings in the village accommodated a thriving dowlas industry. Records from 1848 indicate Yetminster&#x27;s degree of self-sufficiency as a community; nearly 20 trades and crafts were conducted in the village, including a glazier, a saddler, several shoe and boot makers, a tailor and a maltster.

In 1857 the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway between Weymouth and Westbury opened; it passed through Yetminster and a station was built for the village.

Many of the buildings still standing in the village were built from the local limestone between the end of the 16th and the middle of the 18th centuries, resulting in an unusually unified architectural appearance. Writing in 1905 Sir Frederick Treves described the village as &quot;probably the most consistent old-world village or townlet in the county&quot;, in 1965 Ralph Wightman stated that &quot;Yetminster [...] is the nearest Dorset equivalent to the stone building of the Cotswold country&quot;, and in 1980 Roland Gant wrote that &quot;little has come since to spoil this largish village.&quot;

==Governance==

Yetminster is within an electoral ward that bears its name and includes Chetnole and the surrounding area. The population of this ward in the 2011 census was 1,564. The ward is one of 32 that comprise the West Dorset parliamentary constituency.

==Geography==

Measured directly, Yetminster village is about southwest of Sherborne, southeast of Yeovil, northeast of Bridport and north-northwest of Dorchester.

The geology of the parish comprises a narrow central band of Middle Jurassic cornbrash limestone and Forest Marble that crosses the parish from west to east, with Upper Jurassic Oxford clay to the north and south. In the southeast and northeast the Oxford clay is overlain by Quaternary undifferentiated head deposits. The village is sited on the cornbrash.

==Demography==

In the 2011 census Yetminster civil parish had 531 dwellings, 498 households and a population of 1,105. 29.0% of residents were age 65 or over, compared to 16.4% for England as a whole.

The population of the parish in the censuses between 1921 and 2001 is shown in the table below:

==Amenities==

Yetminster does not lie on a main road and experiences mostly local traffic. It has its own railway station (on the Heart of Wessex Line), which is sited close to the village centre. St Andrews Church has a 300-year-old faceless clock which chimes the national anthem every three hours. As well as the expected local store and pub, Yetminster still possesses a variety of village amenities and services, including a GP surgery and health centre, and a sports/social club with playing grounds and tennis court.
==Notable people==

Yetminster was the birthplace of Benjamin Jesty (c.1736–1816), a farmer who lived in the village for much of his life, who is notable for his early experiment in inducing immunity against smallpox using deliberate inoculation with the less virulent cowpox. Unlike Edward Jenner, a medical doctor who is given broad credit for developing the smallpox vaccine in 1796, Jesty did not publicise his findings, even though they were made some twenty years earlier in 1774. Only two people pre-dated Jesty&#x27;s work. There is a blue plaque commemorating Jesty&#x27;s pioneering work at Upbury Farm, near to the church.

English folk music group The Yetties met in the Yetminster Scout Group in the mid-1950s and took their name from the village.

<text>Ralph Waldo Rose (March 17, 1885 – October 16, 1913) was an American track and field athlete. He was born in Healdsburg, California.

==Biography==
Standing 6 ft 5.5 in (197 cm) and weighing 250 pounds (115 kg), Rose was the first shot putter to break 50 feet (15 m). His world record of 51 ft 0 in (15.5 m), set in 1909, lasted for 16 years. In 1904, while at the University of Michigan, he won both the shot put and discus at the Big Ten championships. He subsequently competed for the Olympic Club in San Francisco, California and won seven National AAU titles in the shot, discus, and javelin. A competitor in three Olympic Games, Rose compiled a medal total of three golds, two silver, and one bronze. At the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, he won the shot, was second in the discus, third in the hammer throw, and sixth in the 56-pound (25 kg) weight throw.

Four years later at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, he repeated as the shot put champion. At the opening ceremony Rose, the U.S. flag bearer, refused (supported by a majority of his mostly Irish-American teammates) to dip the flag towards the royal box, as athletes from other countries did. Fellow athlete Martin Sheridan supposedly explained Rose&#x27;s action with the terse statement, &quot;This flag dips to no earthly king.&quot; According to legend, this caused acrimony between the United States and Great Britain. Several decisions by British judges went against American athletes during the games, and U.S. spokesmen felt they stemmed from bias, caused in part by the flag incident. However, there is no reliable evidence that the British spectators objected to Rose&#x27;s action, nor that Sheridan ever uttered his famous quote, which did not appear in print until 1952.

At the 1908 Summer Olympics Rose competed in the tug of war but was not successful.
In the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, he won the two-handed shot put (throwing a total of 27.70 m (90 ft 10.5 in) with his right and left hands), took second in the regular shot, ninth in the hammer and 11th in the discus.

At the age of 28 he died of typhoid fever, in San Francisco.

<text>Charles Edward &quot;Charlie&quot; Greene (March 21, 1945 – March 14, 2022) was an American track and field sprinter and winner of the gold medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay at the 1968 Summer Olympics.

Born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Greene was considered a certain candidate for the 1964 Olympic team, but he suffered a muscle pull which held him to a sixth-place finish at the Olympic Trials.

Greene won the 100-yard dash for O&#x27;Dea High School in Seattle in 1962 and 1963 and also the 220-yard dash in 1963. Greene won the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) championships in the 100-yard dash in 1966 and in the 100-meter dash in 1968. At the 1968 AAU Championships, Greene tied the 100 m world record twice. First in the heats, he equaled the world record of 10.0 seconds. In the second semifinal, he achieved a time of 9.9 seconds, the same time which had been run by Jim Hines and Ronnie Ray Smith in the previous race. The evening when the three men equaled the world record (and several others were very close), June 20, 1968, at Hughes Stadium in Sacramento, California has been dubbed by track and field historians as the &quot;Night of Speed&quot;. As a University of Nebraska student, Greene won the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships in the 100-yard dash from 1965 to 1967 and tied the world record at 9.1 seconds.

At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, Greene felt pain in his left hamstring late in the race and was third in the 100-meter dash. He was the fastest man in the trials and semifinals, but before the final race he was injured although started anyway with a bandaged leg. Despite the injury, he also led off the American 4 × 100 metres relay team which won the gold medal and set a new world record of 38.24 seconds.

Following his athletic career, Greene became a United States Army officer, serving as the sprint coach at West Point and head coach of the All-Army team. After retiring from the Army with the rank of Major, he became a director for Special Olympics International.

In 2007, Charles Greene became the sprints coach at Lincoln Northeast High School in Lincoln, Nebraska. He coached multiple state qualifiers in his first year along with the state&#x27;s third-place 4 × 100 metres relay team of Logan Reising, Brian May, Tory Berks, and AJ Robinson.

Greene, who spent most of his childhood in Seattle, Washington, was slowed down later in life due to a number of medical complications and surgeries. He died in Lincoln, Nebraska on March 14, 2022, at the age of 76.

<doc id="1079447" wikidata="Q1067679" url="?curid=1079447" title="Charon (band)">
<text>Charon was a Finnish gothic metal band from Raahe.

== History ==
Charon was founded in 1992 by Antti Karihtala, Teemu Hautamäki, Pasi Sipilä, and Jasse Hast and was originally a brutal death metal act. After releasing three promo albums and two demos, all self-released, the band signed a record deal with Emanzipation Productions. Through Emanzipation, Charon released their first two full-length albums Sorrowburn and Tearstained in 1998 and 2000 respectively. After touring with fellow Finlanders Sentenced, the band parted ways with Emanzipation and signed to Spinefarm Records.

During the summer of 2001 Charon recorded their third studio album Downhearted. Prior to the release of the full album, the single &quot;Little Angel&quot;, which rose to number 5 on the Finnish singles chart, was released. In early 2002, Downhearted was released, and it proved to be just as popular as the single. The album rose to the number 3 slot on the Finnish Album Charts while the video for the song &quot;Little Angel&quot; hit No. 1 on the Nordic Video List.

The summer following the release of Downhearted the band went on tour in their native Finland, and directly thereafter the band toured through Europe with Nightwish and After Forever. Then in April 2003, the band released another single, &quot;In Trust of No One&quot;, which made its debut at No. 1 on the Finnish Singles Chart. Five months later the &quot;Religious/Delicious&quot; single was released, followed quickly by the band&#x27;s fourth studio album The Dying Daylights. Immediately after the releases the band went on tour in Finland to support the album.

In November 2003, guitarist Jasse von Hast left the band, citing a lack of interest in playing for the group and boredom with band-related activities as reason for doing so. Lauri Tuohimaa stepped in and officially became the band&#x27;s new guitarist in January 2004. Charon then went on yet another tour through Finland to support The Dying Daylights.

After several more tours and the release of the single &quot;Colder&quot;, the band released its fifth album &quot;Songs for the Sinners&quot; on 31 August 2005. Since then, the band has toured extensively in Europe and Russia. Concerning further releases, the band stated, during the summer, that they had six new tracks ready to record. Then, that autumn, another update was posted on the bands site stating that they have spent the last few weeks recording five new tracks for a demo and that they are currently negotiating a new record deal.

In June 2011, the band posted a news release on their website stating that they have decided to disband after summer concerts in their native Finland. In an interview with Leppaluoto, the band felt they had nothing more to contribute in the genre. And some members where not interested anymore, with conflict going back to 2005. 

In October 2015, lead singer JP-Leppaluoto and other members of Charon participated in a music gig in Tavastia on Halloween, effectively reviving Charon for a final time for a show. Since then, Charon has again disbanded, despite some sources labelling the band on an &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot;. Charon&#x27;s Twitter is still somewhat active, only used as promoting other artists.

<doc id="1079448" wikidata="Q907439" url="?curid=1079448" title="Dirac operator">
<text>In mathematics and quantum mechanics, a Dirac operator is a differential operator that is a formal square root, or half-iterate, of a second-order operator such as a Laplacian. The original case which concerned Paul Dirac was to factorise formally an operator for Minkowski space, to get a form of quantum theory compatible with special relativity; to get the relevant Laplacian as a product of first-order operators he introduced spinors. It was first published in 1928 by Dirac.

== Formal definition ==

In general, let &quot;D&quot; be a first-order differential operator acting on a vector bundle &quot;V&quot; over a Riemannian manifold &quot;M&quot;. If 
: formula_1
where ∆ is the Laplacian of &quot;V&quot;, then &quot;D&quot; is called a Dirac operator.

In high-energy physics, this requirement is often relaxed: only the second-order part of &quot;D&quot;2 must equal the Laplacian.

== Examples ==
=== Example 1 ===
&quot;D&quot; = −&quot;i&quot; ∂&quot;x&quot; is a Dirac operator on the tangent bundle over a line.

=== Example 2 ===
Consider a simple bundle of notable importance in physics: the configuration space of a particle with spin confined to a plane, which is also the base manifold. It is represented by a wavefunction 
: formula_2
where &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are the usual coordinate functions on R2. &quot;χ&quot; specifies the probability amplitude for the particle to be in the spin-up state, and similarly for &quot;η&quot;. The so-called spin-Dirac operator can then be written
: formula_3
where &quot;σ&quot;&quot;i&quot; are the Pauli matrices. Note that the anticommutation relations for the Pauli matrices make the proof of the above defining property trivial. Those relations define the notion of a Clifford algebra.

Solutions to the Dirac equation for spinor fields are often called &quot;harmonic spinors&quot;.

=== Example 3 ===
Feynman&#x27;s Dirac operator describes the propagation of a free fermion in three dimensions and is elegantly written 
: formula_4
using the Feynman slash notation. In introductory textbooks to quantum field theory, this will appear in the form

:formula_5

where formula_6 are the off-diagonal Dirac matrices formula_7, with formula_8 and the remaining constants are formula_9 the speed of light, formula_10 being the Planck constant, and formula_11 the mass of a fermion (for example, an electron). It acts on a four-component wave function formula_12, the Sobolev space of smooth, square-integrable functions. It can be extended to a self-adjoint operator on that domain. The square, in this case, is not the Laplacian, but instead formula_13 (after setting formula_14)

=== Example 4 ===
Another Dirac operator arises in Clifford analysis. In euclidean &quot;n&quot;-space this is
: formula_15
where {&quot;ej&quot;: &quot;j&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;n&quot;} is an orthonormal basis for euclidean &quot;n&quot;-space, and R&quot;n&quot; is considered to be embedded in a Clifford algebra. 

This is a special case of the Atiyah–Singer–Dirac operator acting on sections of a spinor bundle.

=== Example 5 ===
For a spin manifold, &quot;M&quot;, the Atiyah–Singer–Dirac operator is locally defined as follows: For and &quot;e1&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), ..., &quot;ej&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) a local orthonormal basis for the tangent space of &quot;M&quot; at &quot;x&quot;, the Atiyah–Singer–Dirac operator is
:formula_16
where formula_17 is the spin connection, a lifting of the Levi-Civita connection on &quot;M&quot; to the spinor bundle over &quot;M&quot;. The square in this case is not the Laplacian, but instead formula_18 where formula_19 is the scalar curvature of the connection.

=== Example 6 ===
On Riemannian manifold formula_20 of dimension formula_21 with Levi-Civita connection formula_22and an orthonormal basis formula_23, we can define exterior derivative formula_24 and coderivative formula_25 as
: formula_26.

Then we can define a Dirac-Kähler operator formula_27, as follows
: formula_28.

The operator acts on sections of Clifford bundle in general, and it can be restricted to spinor bundle, an ideal of Clifford bundle, only if the projection operator on the ideal is parallel.

== Generalisations ==
In Clifford analysis, the operator acting on spinor valued functions defined by 
:formula_29
is sometimes called Dirac operator in &quot;k&quot; Clifford variables. In the notation, &quot;S&quot; is the space of spinors, formula_30 are &quot;n&quot;-dimensional variables and formula_31 is the Dirac operator in the &quot;i&quot;-th variable. This is a common generalization of the Dirac operator () and the Dolbeault operator (, &quot;k&quot; arbitrary). It is an invariant differential operator, invariant under the action of the group . The resolution of &quot;D&quot; is known only in some special cases.

<doc id="1079449" wikidata="Q1138670" url="?curid=1079449" title="St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne">
<text>The Cathedral Church and Minor Basilica of Saint Patrick (colloquially St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral) is the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, and seat of its archbishop, currently Peter Comensoli.

In 1974 Pope Paul VI conferred the title and dignity of minor basilica on it. In 1986 Pope John Paul II visited the cathedral and addressed clergy during his papal visit.

The cathedral is built on a traditional east–west axis, with the altar at the eastern end, symbolising belief in the resurrection of Christ. The plan is in the style of a Latin cross, consisting of a nave with side aisles, transepts with side aisles, a sanctuary with seven chapels, and sacristies. 

The cathedral was listed on the Victorian Heritage Register on 5 August 1999.

==Location==
The cathedral is located on Eastern Hill in Melbourne, in an area bounded by Albert Street, Gisborne Street, Lansdowne Street and Cathedral Place. Just to the west across Gisborne Street is St Peter&#x27;s Church, constructed from 1846 to 1848, which is the Anglican parish church of Melbourne.

==History==
In 1848, the Augustinian friar James Goold was appointed the first bishop of Melbourne and became the fourth bishop in Australia, after Sydney, Hobart and Adelaide. Negotiations with the colonial government for the grant of five acres of land for a church in the Eastern Hill area began in 1848. On 1 April 1851, only 16 years after the foundation of Melbourne, the Colonial Secretary of Victoria finally granted the site to the Roman Catholic Church.

Goold decided to build his cathedral on the Eastern Hill site.

Since the Catholic community of Melbourne was at the time almost entirely Irish, the cathedral was dedicated to St Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland.

In 1851 a start was made, but with every able-bodied man in the colony soon rushing to the goldfields, not much was built by 1856, when Goold commissioned a larger one, using a design by Charles Hansom, but only the south aisle was built by 1858 when Goold appointed the recently arrived English architect William Wardell to design a far larger one. Wardell was an accomplished architect, known especially for a series of Catholic churches in London, all in Gothic Revival style, and was part of the circle around one of the leading exponents of the Gothic for churches, Augustus Welby Pugin.

St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral draws on the Gothic style of late thirteenth century, based on the great medieval cathedrals of England. The style is specifically Geometric Decorated Gothic, showing this style at its most complex in the large west window of the nave. The eastern arm with its chevet of radiating chapels in the French manner is still principally in the English late thirteenth century style, giving the most complete essay attempted in that style during the nineteenth century. William Wardell was a remarkably ambitious and capable architect; he went on to design the second St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney, in a similar style, even larger than St Patrick&#x27;s, but with a completely English square East End.

In 1974 Pope Paul VI conferred the title and dignity of minor basilica on it. In 1986 Pope John Paul II visited the cathedral and addressed clergy during his papal visit. The building also saw a green ban in the 1970s.

===Construction===
In 1858 William Wardell was commissioned to plan the cathedral with a contract signed on 8 December 1858 and building commencing the same year.
Although the nave was completed within 10 years, construction proceeded slowly, and was further delayed by the severe depression which hit Melbourne in 1891. Under the leadership of Archbishop Thomas Carr the cathedral was consecrated in 1897 and even then it was not finished. Given the size of the Catholic community at the time, the massive bluestone Gothic cathedral was an immense and very expensive undertaking, and there were long delays while funds were raised. St Patrick&#x27;s was one of the two largest churches brought to substantial completion anywhere in the world in the 19th century. The other is St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, New York, United States.

Daniel Mannix, who became Archbishop of Melbourne in 1917, maintained a constant interest in the cathedral, which he was determined to see finished after the long delays during the previous 30 years. He oversaw the construction of the spires and a new main door in the late 1930s, with the spires being built taller than Wardell&#x27;s original design. The completed building was officially completed in 1939.

The cathedral is long on its long axis, wide across the transepts and wide across the nave. The nave and transepts are high. The central spire is high and the flanking towers and spires are high. The bluestone used in its construction was sourced from basalt deposits in nearby Footscray.

===Restoration===
To celebrate the centenary of its consecration in 1997, the cathedral was closed throughout 1994 to be upgraded. Nothing was added to the main building. Rather, it underwent significant conservation work, with funds contributed by the federal and Victorian governments, corporate and philanthropic donors and the community of Melbourne.

The cathedral&#x27;s stained glass windows had buckled and cracked and required a full year to restore to their original state. Teams of stonemasons and stained-glass craftsmen used &quot;lime mortars and materials long-forgotten by the building trade — like medieval times&quot;. The 1992–97 restoration works were undertaken under the guidance of Falkinger Andronas Architects and Heritage Consultants. The works were awarded the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (Victorian Chapter) John George Knight Award for Heritage Architecture 1996. One of the gargoyles restored by the masonry team was modelled on the then-Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett.

==Music==

===Cathedral choir===
There has been music at St Patrick&#x27;s since 1858, but the present cathedral choir was founded in 1939 when the Vienna Mozart Boys Choir found itself stranded in Australia at the outbreak of war. The National Museum of Australia holds a collection of the choir&#x27;s memorabilia from this period. St Patrick&#x27;s choir has between 50 and 60 members who are all students of St Kevin&#x27;s College in Toorak, through a scholarship program from the archdiocese. The choir has made commercial recordings in the past, mainly from the 1950s to 1990s. Selected recording before the 1980s have been deposited with the National Film and Sound Archive (Screensound Australia).

===Cathedral singers===
Formed in May 1996, the St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral Singers supplement the musical resources of the cathedral. The choir has been directed since 2015 by Mr Christopher Mason. The Singers sing weekly at the Sunday 6:30pm Mass. Entrance is by audition and some scholarships are available to eligible students.

===Pipe organs===
The cathedral&#x27;s original pipe organ was built in the late 1870s by Robert Mackenzie and completed in 1880 by George Fincham. The current installation built by George Fincham &amp; Sons, Melbourne in 1962–64 and incorporates a substantial part of the original. Installed in the west gallery of the cathedral, it comprises 81 speaking stops spread over four manuals and pedals. Some of the stops can be dated to 1880 or 1896, when the instrument was enlarged. The organ was refurbished in 1996–97 for the centenary of the cathedral. In addition to serving the liturgical needs of the cathedral, the organ is occasional used for recitals and recordings.


===Bells===
The bells of the cathedral were acquired by Bishop Goold, Melbourne&#x27;s Roman Catholic leader at the time, when he visited Europe in 1851–1852. He bought a peal of eight bells for £500 (with some records showing that it cost £700). They arrived in Australia in 1853. The peal of eight bells is in F natural, with the tenor weighing and the treble . The peal set weights around . The bells were all cast by John Murphy of Dublin in 1852.

The bells were hung in a low frame at ground level in the western aisle in 1868. The consecration service was attended by around 5,000 people. The eight bell bears the coat of arms of Bishop Goold. The bells were eventually hung at the south-eastern tower.

The ringers of St Patrick&#x27;s began the custom of ringing in the New Year in 1871. And by the 1880s, St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral became the leading tower for Australian change ringing. The bells were rung for the requiem mass of Pope Pius X in 1914. By 1959 the belfry fell into disrepair and the bells became unringable. The bells remained silent until in 1988, when the peal was sent to Eayre and Smith Bell foundry in England as the major Victorian project among Bicententennial bell restorations. Upon their return, a ninth bell, an Angelus bell, was added. An electronic chiming mechanism was also installed at this time for all the bells. The original manual method was retained by the electronic mechanism, in order to replicate how the bells would have sounded if they were rung by hand. The entire eight headstocks had to be replaced just ten years after this installation. The ringers are affiliated with The Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers.

The bells are unusual in that they were cast untuned, they ring anti-clockwise instead of clockwise, and they are thought to be the only ring of eight bells cast by Murphy which are still in operation today.

<text>Ronald Ray Smith (March 28, 1949 – March 31, 2013) was an American athlete, winner of the gold medal in the 4 × 100 m relay at the 1968 Summer Olympics. He attended San Jose State College during the &quot;Speed City&quot; era, coached by Lloyd (Bud) Winter and graduating in sociology.

At the 1968 AAU Championships, Ronnie Ray Smith equaled the 100 m world record in the semifinal, repeating the same time of 9.9 which was run by Jim Hines in the same race and Charles Greene in the other semifinal of the same competition. That evening of June 20, 1968, at Hughes Stadium in Sacramento, California has been dubbed by track and field historians as the &quot;Night of Speed.&quot; Since Smith was still 19 years old at the time, that mark also became the World Junior Record, which lasted for exactly 8 years.

At the Mexico Olympics, Smith ran the third leg in the American 4 × 100 m relay team that won the gold medal and set a new world record of 38.24 seconds.

Before arriving at San Jose State, Smith ran at Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, finishing third in the 220 yard dash at the CIF California State Meet in 1966.

After retiring from competitions Smith worked at the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department. He was inducted into the San Jose State Sports Hall of Fame.

Smith died in a hospice facility in Los Angeles, California, on March 31, 2013. He was 64. His funeral was featured on the TLC reality TV show Best Funeral Ever. In honor and memory of his 1968 gold medal performance, his casket &quot;ran&quot; a 100yd race and received a gold medal in a mock Olympic-style funeral.

<text>Enhanced Full Rate or EFR or GSM-EFR or GSM 06.60 is a speech coding standard that was developed in order to improve the quality of GSM.

Enhanced Full Rate was developed by Nokia and the Université de Sherbrooke (Canada). In 1995, ETSI selected the Enhanced Full Rate voice codec as the industry standard codec for GSM/DCS.

== Technology ==
The sampling rate is 8000 sample/s leading to a bit rate for the encoded bit stream of 12.2 kbit/s. The coding scheme is the so-called Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction Coder (ACELP). The encoder is fed with data consisting of samples with a resolution of 13 bits left justified in a 16-bit word. The three least significant bits are set to 0. The decoder outputs data in the same format.

The Enhanced Full Rate (GSM 06.60) technical specification describes the detailed mapping between input blocks of 160 speech samples in 13-bit uniform PCM format to encoded blocks of 244 bits and from encoded blocks of 244 bits to output blocks of 160 reconstructed speech samples. It also specifies the conversion between A-law or μ-law (PCS 1900) 8-bit PCM and 13-bit uniform PCM. This part of specification also describes the codec down to the bit level, thus enabling the verification of compliance to the part to a high degree of confidence by use of a set of digital test sequences. These test sequences are described in GSM 06.54 and are available on disks.

This standard is defined in ETSI ETS 300 726 (GSM 06.60). The packing is specified in ETSI Technical Specification TS 101 318.
ETSI has selected the Enhanced Full Rate voice codec as the industry standard codec for GSM/DCS in 1995. Enhanced Full Rate was also chosen as the industry standard in US market for PCS 1900 GSM frequency band.

== Licensing and patent issues ==
The Enhanced Full Rate incorporate several patents. It uses the patented ACELP technology, which is licensed by the VoiceAge Corporation.

Enhanced Full Rate was developed by Nokia and the Université de Sherbrooke (Canada).

<text>Melvin Pender Jr. (born October 31, 1937, in Atlanta, Georgia) competed as a runner in the 1964 and 1968 Olympics, winning an Olympic gold medal in the 4x100 m relay at the 1968 Summer Olympics. He had been a member of the Philadelphia Pioneer Track Club where he was coached by Alex Woodley, who had coached several other athletes who went on to participate in Olympic events.

==U.S. Army career==
Pender enlisted in the U.S. Army at age 17. In 1960 he was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division on Okinawa. Following the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, he returned to military service, graduating from Officer Candidate School in 1965. He was subsequently deployed to South Vietnam where he served with the 9th Infantry Division in the Mekong Delta. Subsequently he was ordered to return to the U.S. to train for 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.

After the 1968 Olympics, Pender returned to South Vietnam where he earned a Bronze Star Medal. Returning to the U.S. in August 1970, he then worked as assistant track and field coach and then as head track coach at the United States Military Academy at West Point. He later earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Adelphi University. He retired from the Army in 1976 with the rank of Captain.

==Olympic athlete==
While serving in the U.S. Army his incredible speed was noticed in camp football games. He was selected to the 1964 Olympic Team, but was hampered by injury and finished seventh in the 100 meters at Tokyo.

Nearing age 31, Pender again made it to the 100 m final, where his explosive start and exceptional acceleration brought him to the lead midway through the race, but he faded slightly and finished sixth. In the relay, he was chosen to run the second leg. The American team won the gold medal in a new world record of He also set world records in the 50 yds at 5.0, 60 yds at 5.8, 70 yds at 6.8 and 100 meters at 9.9 seconds.

<doc id="1079466" wikidata="Q367473" url="?curid=1079466" title="Förster resonance energy transfer">
<text>Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), fluorescence resonance energy transfer, resonance energy transfer (RET) or electronic energy transfer (EET) is a mechanism describing energy transfer between two light-sensitive molecules (chromophores). A donor chromophore, initially in its electronic excited state, may transfer energy to an acceptor chromophore through nonradiative dipole–dipole coupling. The efficiency of this energy transfer is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between donor and acceptor, making FRET extremely sensitive to small changes in distance.

Measurements of FRET efficiency can be used to determine if two fluorophores are within a certain distance of each other. Such measurements are used as a research tool in fields including biology and chemistry.

FRET is analogous to near-field communication, in that the radius of interaction is much smaller than the wavelength of light emitted. In the near-field region, the excited chromophore emits a virtual photon that is instantly absorbed by a receiving chromophore. These virtual photons are undetectable, since their existence violates the conservation of energy and momentum, and hence FRET is known as a &quot;radiationless&quot; mechanism. Quantum electrodynamical calculations have been used to determine that radiationless FRET and radiative energy transfer are the short- and long-range asymptotes of a single unified mechanism.

==Terminology==
Förster resonance energy transfer is named after the German scientist Theodor Förster. When both chromophores are fluorescent, the term &quot;fluorescence resonance energy transfer&quot; is often used instead, although the energy is not actually transferred by fluorescence. In order to avoid an erroneous interpretation of the phenomenon that is always a nonradiative transfer of energy (even when occurring between two fluorescent chromophores), the name &quot;Förster resonance energy transfer&quot; is preferred to &quot;fluorescence resonance energy transfer&quot;; however, the latter enjoys common usage in scientific literature. FRET is not restricted to fluorescence and occurs in connection with phosphorescence as well.

==Theoretical basis==
The FRET efficiency (formula_1) is the quantum yield of the energy-transfer transition, i.e. the probability of energy-transfer event occurring per donor excitation event:

: formula_2

where formula_3 the radiative decay rate of the donor, formula_4 is the rate of energy transfer, and formula_5 the rates of any other de-excitation pathways excluding energy transfers to other acceptors.

The FRET efficiency depends on many physical parameters that can be grouped as: 1) the distance between the donor and the acceptor (typically in the range of 1–10 nm), 2) the spectral overlap of the donor emission spectrum and the acceptor absorption spectrum, and 3) the relative orientation of the donor emission dipole moment and the acceptor absorption dipole moment.

formula_1 depends on the donor-to-acceptor separation distance formula_7 with an inverse 6th-power law due to the dipole–dipole coupling mechanism:
: formula_8
with formula_9 being the Förster distance of this pair of donor and acceptor, i.e. the distance at which the energy transfer efficiency is 50%. The Förster distance depends on the overlap integral of the donor emission spectrum with the acceptor absorption spectrum and their mutual molecular orientation as expressed by the following equation all in SI units:

: formula_10

where formula_11 is the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor in the absence of the acceptor, formula_12 is the dipole orientation factor, formula_13 is the refractive index of the medium, formula_14 is the Avogadro constant, and formula_15 is the spectral overlap integral calculated as
: formula_16
where formula_17 is the donor emission spectrum, formula_18 is the donor emission spectrum normalized to an area of 1, and formula_19 is the acceptor molar extinction coefficient, normally obtained from an absorption spectrum. The orientation factor is given by
: formula_20
where formula_21 denotes the normalized transition dipole moment of the respective fluorophore, and formula_22 denotes the normalized inter-fluorophore displacement. formula_12 = 2/3 is often assumed. This value is obtained when both dyes are freely rotating and can be considered to be isotropically oriented during the excited-state lifetime. If either dye is fixed or not free to rotate, then formula_12 = 2/3 will not be a valid assumption. In most cases, however, even modest reorientation of the dyes results in enough orientational averaging that formula_12 = 2/3 does not result in a large error in the estimated energy-transfer distance due to the sixth-power dependence of formula_9 on formula_12. Even when formula_12 is quite different from 2/3, the error can be associated with a shift in formula_9, and thus determinations of changes in relative distance for a particular system are still valid. Fluorescent proteins do not reorient on a timescale that is faster than their fluorescence lifetime. In this case 0 ≤ formula_12 ≤ 4.

The units of the data are usually not in SI units. Using the original units to calculate the Förster distance is often more convenient. For example, the wavelength is often in unit nm and the extinction coefficient is often in unit formula_31, where formula_32 is concentration formula_33. formula_15 obtained from these units will have unit formula_35. To use unit Å (formula_36) for the formula_37, the equation is adjusted to 
: formula_38 (Åformula_39)

For time-dependent analyses of FRET, the rate of energy transfer (formula_4) can be used directly instead:

: formula_41

where formula_42 is the donor&#x27;s fluorescence lifetime in the absence of the acceptor.

The FRET efficiency relates to the quantum yield and the fluorescence lifetime of the donor molecule as follows:
: formula_43
where formula_44 and formula_45 are the donor fluorescence lifetimes in the presence and absence of an acceptor respectively, or as
: formula_46
where formula_47 and formula_48 are the donor fluorescence intensities with and without an acceptor respectively.

==Experimental confirmation of the FRET theory==
The inverse sixth-power distance dependence of Förster resonance energy transfer was experimentally confirmed by Wilchek, Edelhoch and Brand using tryptophyl peptides. Stryer, Haugland and Yguerabide also experimentally demonstrated the theoretical dependence of Förster resonance energy transfer on the overlap integral by using a fused indolosteroid as a donor and a ketone as an acceptor. Calculations on FRET distances of some example dye-pairs can be found here. However, a lot of contradictions of special experiments with the theory was observed under complicated environment when the orientations and quantum yields of the molecules are difficult to estimate.

==Methods to measure FRET efficiency==
In fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy, as well as in molecular biology, FRET is a useful tool to quantify molecular dynamics in biophysics and biochemistry, such as protein-protein interactions, protein–DNA interactions, DNA-DNA interactions, and protein conformational changes. For monitoring the complex formation between two molecules, one of them is labeled with a donor and the other with an acceptor. The FRET efficiency is measured and used to identify interactions between the labeled complexes. There are several ways of measuring the FRET efficiency by monitoring changes in the fluorescence emitted by the donor or the acceptor.

===Sensitized emission===
One method of measuring FRET efficiency is to measure the variation in acceptor emission intensity. When the donor and acceptor are in proximity (1–10 nm) due to the interaction of the two molecules, the acceptor emission will increase because of the intermolecular FRET from the donor to the acceptor. For monitoring protein conformational changes, the target protein is labeled with a donor and an acceptor at two loci. When a twist or bend of the protein brings the change in the distance or relative orientation of the donor and acceptor, FRET change is observed. If a molecular interaction or a protein conformational change is dependent on ligand binding, this FRET technique is applicable to fluorescent indicators for the ligand detection.

===Photobleaching FRET===
FRET efficiencies can also be inferred from the photobleaching rates of the donor in the presence and absence of an acceptor. This method can be performed on most fluorescence microscopes; one simply shines the excitation light (of a frequency that will excite the donor but not the acceptor significantly) on specimens with and without the acceptor fluorophore and monitors the donor fluorescence (typically separated from acceptor fluorescence using a bandpass filter) over time. The timescale is that of photobleaching, which is seconds to minutes, with fluorescence in each curve being given by

:formula_49

where formula_50 is the photobleaching decay time constant and depends on whether the acceptor is present or not. Since photobleaching consists in the permanent inactivation of excited fluorophores, resonance energy transfer from an excited donor to an acceptor fluorophore prevents the photobleaching of that donor fluorophore, and thus high FRET efficiency leads to a longer photobleaching decay time constant:

:formula_51

where formula_52 and formula_50 are the photobleaching decay time constants of the donor in the presence and in the absence of the acceptor respectively. (Notice that the fraction is the reciprocal of that used for lifetime measurements).

This technique was introduced by Jovin in 1989. Its use of an entire curve of points to extract the time constants can give it accuracy advantages over the other methods. Also, the fact that time measurements are over seconds rather than nanoseconds makes it easier than fluorescence lifetime measurements, and because photobleaching decay rates do not generally depend on donor concentration (unless acceptor saturation is an issue), the careful control of concentrations needed for intensity measurements is not needed. It is, however, important to keep the illumination the same for the with- and without-acceptor measurements, as photobleaching increases markedly with more intense incident light.

===Lifetime measurements===
FRET efficiency can also be determined from the change in the fluorescence lifetime of the donor. The lifetime of the donor will decrease in the presence of the acceptor. Lifetime measurements of the FRET-donor are used in fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).

===Single-molecule FRET (smFRET)===
smFRET is a group of methods using various microscopic techniques to measure a pair of donor and acceptor fluorophores that are excited and detected at the single molecule level. In contrast to &quot;ensemble FRET&quot; or &quot;bulk FRET&quot; which provides the FRET signal of a high number of molecules, single-molecule FRET is able to resolve the FRET signal of each individual molecule. The variation of the smFRET signal is useful to reveal kinetic information that an ensemble measurement cannot provide, especially when the system is under equilibrium. Heterogeneity among different molecules can also be observed. This method has been applied in many measurements of biomolecular dynamics such as DNA/RNA/protein folding/unfolding and other conformational changes, and intermolecular dynamics such as reaction, binding, adsorption, and desorption that are particularly useful in chemical sensing, bioassays, and biosensing.

==Fluorophores used for FRET==
===CFP-YFP pairs===
One common pair fluorophores for biological use is a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) – yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) pair. Both are color variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Labeling with organic fluorescent dyes requires purification, chemical modification, and intracellular injection of a host protein. GFP variants can be attached to a host protein by genetic engineering which can be more convenient. Additionally, a fusion of CFP and YFP (&quot;tandem-dimer&quot;) linked by a protease cleavage sequence can be used as a cleavage assay.

===BRET===
A limitation of FRET performed with fluorophore donors is the requirement for external illumination to initiate the fluorescence transfer, which can lead to background noise in the results from direct excitation of the acceptor or to photobleaching. To avoid this drawback, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (or BRET) has been developed. This technique uses a bioluminescent luciferase (typically the luciferase from &quot;Renilla reniformis&quot;) rather than CFP to produce an initial photon emission compatible with YFP.

BRET has also been implemented using a different luciferase enzyme, engineered from the deep-sea shrimp &quot;Oplophorus gracilirostris&quot;. This luciferase is smaller (19 kD) and brighter than the more commonly used luciferase from &quot;Renilla reniformis&quot;, and has been named NanoLuc or NanoKAZ. Promega has developed a patented substrate for NanoLuc called furimazine, though other valuables coelenterazine substrates for NanoLuc have also been published. A split-protein version of NanoLuc developed by Promega has also been used as a BRET donor in experiments measuring protein-protein interactions.

===Homo-FRET===

In general, &quot;FRET&quot; refers to situations where the donor and acceptor proteins (or &quot;fluorophores&quot;) are of two different types. In many biological situations, however, researchers might need to examine the interactions between two, or more, proteins of the same type—or indeed the same protein with itself, for example if the protein folds or forms part of a polymer chain of proteins or for other questions of quantification in biological cells or &quot;in vitro&quot; experiments. 

Obviously, spectral differences will not be the tool used to detect and measure FRET, as both the acceptor and donor protein emit light with the same wavelengths. Yet researchers can detect differences in the polarisation between the light which excites the fluorophores and the light which is emitted, in a technique called FRET anisotropy imaging; the level of quantified anisotropy (difference in polarisation between the excitation and emission beams) then becomes an indicative guide to how many FRET events have happened.

In the field of nano-photonics, FRET can be detrimental if it funnels excitonic energy to defect sites, but it is also essential to charge collection in organic and quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells, and various FRET-enabled strategies have been proposed for different opto-electronic devices. It is then essential to understand how isolated nano-emitters behave when they are stacked in a dense layer. Nanoplatelets are especially promising candidates for strong homo-FRET exciton diffusion because of their strong in-plane dipole coupling and low Stokes shift. Fluorescence microscopy study of such single chains demonstrated that energy transfer by FRET between neighbor platelets causes energy to diffuse over a typical 500-nm length (about 80 nano emitters), and the transfer time between platelets is on the order of 1 ps.

==Applications==
The applications of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) have expanded tremendously in the last 25 years, and the technique has become a staple in many biological and biophysical fields. FRET can be used as a spectroscopic ruler to measure distance and detect molecular interactions in a number of systems and has applications in biology and biochemistry.

=== Proteins ===
FRET is often used to detect and track interactions between proteins. Additionally, FRET can be used to measure distances between domains in a single protein by tagging different regions of the protein with fluorophores and measuring emission to determine distance. This provides information about protein conformation, including secondary structures and protein folding. This extends to tracking functional changes in protein structure, such as conformational changes associated with myosin activity. Applied in vivo, FRET has been used to detect the location and interactions of cellular structures including integrins and membrane proteins.

=== Membranes ===
FRET can be used to observe membrane fluidity, movement and dispersal of membrane proteins, membrane lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions, and successful mixing of different membranes. FRET is also used to study formation and properties of membrane domains and lipid rafts in cell membranes and to determine surface density in membranes.

=== Chemosensor ===

FRET-based probes can detect the presence of various molecules: the probe&#x27;s structure is affected by small molecule binding or activity, which can turn the FRET system on or off. This is often used to detect anions, cations, small uncharged molecules, and some larger biomacromolecules as well. Similarly, FRET systems have been designed to detect changes in the cellular environment due to such factors as pH, hypoxia, or mitochondrial membrane potential.

=== Signaling pathways ===
Another use for FRET is in the study of metabolic or signaling pathways. For example, FRET and BRET have been used in various experiments to characterize G-protein coupled receptor activation and consequent signaling mechanisms. Other examples include the use of FRET to analyze such diverse processes as bacterial chemotaxis and caspase activity in apoptosis.

=== Proteins and nucleotides folding kinetics===
Proteins, DNAs, RNAs, and other polymer folding dynamics have been measured using FRET. Usually, these systems are under equilibrium whose kinetics is hidden. However, they can be measured by measuring single-molecule FRET with proper placement of the acceptor and donor dyes on the molecules. See single-molecule FRET for a more detailed description.

=== Other applications ===
In addition to common uses previously mentioned, FRET and BRET are also effective in the study of biochemical reaction kinetics. FRET is increasingly used for monitoring pH dependent assembly and disassembly and is valuable in the analysis of nucleic acids encapsulation. This technique can be used to determine factors affecting various types of nanoparticle formation as well as the mechanisms and effects of nanomedicines.

==Other methods==
A different, but related, mechanism is Dexter electron transfer.

An alternative method to detecting protein–protein proximity is the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), where two parts of a fluorescent protein are each fused to other proteins. When these two parts meet, they form a fluorophore on a timescale of minutes or hours.

<text>Full Rate (FR), also known as GSM-FR or GSM 06.10 (sometimes simply GSM), was the first digital speech coding standard used in the GSM digital mobile phone system. It uses linear predictive coding (LPC). The bit rate of the codec is 13 kbit/s, or 1.625 bits/audio sample (often padded out to 33 bytes/20 ms or 13.2 kbit/s). The quality of the coded speech is quite poor by modern standards, but at the time of development (early 1990s) it was a good compromise between computational complexity and quality, requiring only on the order of a million additions and multiplications per second. The codec is still widely used in networks around the world. Gradually FR will be replaced by Enhanced Full Rate (EFR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) standards, which provide much higher speech quality with lower bit rate.

== Technology ==
&quot;GSM-FR&quot; is specified in ETSI 06.10 (ETS 300 961) and is based on RPE-LTP (Regular Pulse Excitation - Long Term Prediction) speech coding paradigm. Like many other linear predictive coding (LPC) speech codecs, linear prediction is used in the synthesis filter. However, unlike most modern speech codecs, the order of the linear prediction is only 8. In modern narrowband speech codecs the order is usually 10 and in wideband speech codecs the order is usually 16.

The speech encoder accepts 13 bit linear PCM at an 8 kHz sample rate.
This can be direct from an analog-to-digital converter in a phone or computer, or converted from G.711 8-bit nonlinear A-law or μ-law PCM from the PSTN with a lookup table.
In GSM, the encoded speech is passed to the channel encoder specified in GSM 05.03. In the receive direction, the inverse operations take place.

The codec operates on 160 sample frames that span 20 ms, so this is the minimum transcoder delay possible even with infinitely fast CPUs and zero network latency. The operational requirement is that the transcoder delay should be less than 30 ms. The transcoder delay is defined as the time interval between the instant a speech frame of 160 samples has been received at the encoder input and the instant the corresponding 160 reconstructed speech samples have been out-put by the speech decoder at an 8 kHz sample rate.

== Implementations ==
The free &quot;libgsm&quot; codec can encode and decode GSM Full Rate audio. &quot;libgsm&quot; was developed 1992–1994 by Jutta Degener and Carsten Bormann, then at Technische Universität Berlin. Since a GSM speech frame is 32.5 bytes, this implementation also defined a 33-byte nibble-padded representation of a GSM frame (which, at a frame rate of 50/s, is the basis for the incorrect claim that the GSM bit rate is 13.2 kbit/s). This codec can also be compiled into Wine to provide GSM audio support.

There is also a Winamp plugin for raw GSM 06.10 based on the libgsm.

The GSM 06.10 is also used in VoIP software, for example in Ekiga, QuteCom, Linphone, Asterisk (PBX), Ventrilo and others.

<text>Larry Jeffery &quot;Mutt&quot; Black (July 20, 1951 – February 8, 2006) was an American sprinter, winner of the gold medal in the 4 × 100 m relay and silver medal in the 200 m at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.

Black was born in Miami, Florida, and graduated from Miami Killian Senior High with a scholarship to North Carolina Central University. Larry&#x27;s coach at Miami Killian was Leroy Daniels. While studying there he won the NCAA championships in 1971. At the 1972 Olympics, Black ran the opening leg in the American 4 × 100 m relay team. The team won a gold medal and equaled the United States&#x27; own world record of 38.19 seconds. His cousin Gerald Tinker, also from the Miami area (rival Coral Gables High School), ran the third leg in that same gold medal winning race.

After retiring from sport Black returned to Miami and became director of its parks and recreation department. He died from an aneurysm in Miami on February 8, 2006, at the age of 54.

<text>Sir Thomas Hoby (1530 – 13 July 1566) was an English diplomat and translator.

==Early life==
Hoby was born in 1530. He was the second son of William Hoby of Leominster, Herefordshire, by his second wife, Katherine, daughter of John Forden. He was a brother-in-law of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, the Queen&#x27;s principal minister, and an uncle of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, who succeeded his father as Secretary of State. Among his siblings was brother Sir William Hoby of Hayles.

He matriculated at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1546. Encouraged by his sophisticated half-brother, Sir Philip Hoby (later the English Ambassador to the Holy Roman Empire and Flanders), he subsequently visited France, Italy, and other foreign countries, and, as Roger Ascham states, &quot;was many wayes well furnished with learning, and very expert in knowledge of divers tongues.&quot; His tour of Italy, which included visits to Calabria and Sicily and which he documented in his autobiography, is the most extensive known to have been undertaken by an Englishman in the 16th century. In this and other respects, it may be regarded as a pioneering Grand Tour.

==Career==
Hoby translated Martin Bucer&#x27;s &quot;Gratulation to the Church of England&quot; (1549), and Baldassare Castiglione&#x27;s &quot;Il Cortegiano&quot; (1561). The latter translation of &quot;The Courtier&quot;, entitled &quot;The Courtyer of Count Baldessar Castilio&quot;, had great popularity and was one of the key books of the English Renaissance. It provided a philosophy of life for the Elizabethan era gentleman. A reading of its pages fitted him for the full assimilation of the elaborate refinements of the new Renaissance society. It furnished his imagination with the symbol of a completely developed individual, an individual who united ethical theory with spontaneity and richness of character.

On 9 March 1566 he was knighted at Greenwich, and was sent as Ambassador to France at the end of the month. At the time of his landing in Calais, on 9 April, a soldier at the town gate shot through the English flag in two places. Hoby demanded redress for the insult, and obtained it after some delay, but he was not permitted to view the new fortifications.

==Personal life==

On 27 June 1558, Hoby married Elizabeth, the third daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke, of Gidea Hall, Essex. Elizabeth was a sister-in-law of Lord Burghley and a great friend of Queen Elizabeth I. After their marriage, they resided at Bisham Abbey in Berkshire and were the parents of two daughters, who died young, and two sons (both subsequently knighted), including:

* Edward Hoby (1560–1617), who married Margaret Carey, a daughter of Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon (the cousin of Queen Elizabeth). After her death in 1605, he married Cicely Unton (d. 1618), the daughter of Sir Edward Unton and Lady Anne Seymour (a daughter of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset and Anne Seymour, Duchess of Somerset).
* Thomas Posthumous Hoby (1566–1640), a Member of Parliament for Appleby, Scarborough, and Ripon, who married Margaret (née Dakins) Devereux Sidney (1571–1633), daughter and heiress of Arthur Dakins, already the widow of two men, of Walter Devereux (a younger brother of the Earl of Essex), and of Thomas Sidney (a brother of the poet Philip Sidney).

He died in Paris on 13 July 1566, and was buried at Bisham, Berkshire, where his widow erected a monument to his memory and to that of his half-brother Sir Philip Hoby. His widow remarried in 1574, to John, Lord Russell, eldest surviving son and heir to Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford, but John died in 1584 before acceding to the Earldom of Bedford (which passed to his nephew, Edward in 1585).

===Descendants===
His eldest son, Edward, did not produce any children from his two marriages; however, he had a natural son, whom he recognized as his own and made him his heir: Peregrine Hoby (1602–1679) with Katherine Pinckney, a favourite of James I. Peregrine was himself the father of Sir Edward Hoby, 1st Baronet (1634–1675), whose baronetcy continued until the fifth Baronet died in 1766, and Thomas Hoby (1642–1706), an MP for Great Marlow and Salisbury

As his second son, Thomas, died without issue, he left his manor of Hackness to John Sydenham of Brympton in Somerset, the son of his first cousin Alice Hoby, daughter of Sir William Hoby of Hayles, who was Hoby&#x27;s uncle. He made further bequests to other members of the Sydenham family, and he also left each of his servants three years&#x27; wages.

<text>Charles Fenno Hoffman (February 7, 1806 – June 7, 1884) was an American author, poet and editor associated with the Knickerbocker Group in New York.

==Biography==

Hoffman was born in New York City on February 7, 1806. He was the son of New York Attorney General Josiah Ogden Hoffman (1766–1837) and his second wife, Maria (née Fenno) Hoffman (1781–1823). His elder half-brother from his father&#x27;s first marriage to Mary Colden was Ogden Hoffman, who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1837 to 1841. When Charles was 11 years old, his leg was crushed by a boating accident and had to be amputated.

Hoffman, who was proud of his ancestry, was the grandson of John Fenno, the Federalist editor of the &quot;Gazette of the United States&quot;. One aunt, Harriet Fenno (d. 1808), was married to John Rodman, the New York County District Attorney, and other aunt, Mary Eliza Fenno (d. 1817), was married to Gulian C. Verplanck, a New York State Senator and U.S. Representative. He was descended from Martin Hermanzen Hoffman, who emigrated to New Netherland in 1657.

He attended New York University and Columbia College, and studied law with Harmanus Bleecker.

Hoffman was admitted to the bar in 1827, but he practiced law only intermittently. In 1833, he led a group of other students in the Eucleian Society in establishing &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot; magazine, which he edited for the first three issues before passing duties on to Timothy Flint, who then passed them to Lewis Gaylord Clark. In 1835, Hoffman edited &quot;The New-York Book of Poetry&quot; which first attributed &quot;A Visit From St. Nicholas&quot; to Clement Clarke Moore. In 1836, Park Benjamin, Sr. merged his &quot;New England Monthly Magazine&quot; with the &quot;American Monthly&quot; and hired Hoffman as editor, though he left to join the &quot;New York Mirror&quot; a year later.

Hoffman&#x27;s first book was &quot;A Winter in the Far West&quot; (1835), recounting his travels as far west as St. Louis, Missouri. It was followed by &quot;Wild Scenes in Forest and Prairie&quot; (1839) based on actual experiences in search of health. He wrote a successful novel, &quot;Greyslaer&quot; (1840), based on the murder of Colonel Solomon P. Sharp by Jereboam O. Beauchamp, known as the Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy—an event that several writers, including Thomas Holley Chivers, Edgar Allan Poe and William Gilmore Simms, also fictionalized. Hoffman&#x27;s version, however, had little in common with the true event.

Hoffman&#x27;s fame rested chiefly upon his poems, first collected in &quot;The Vigil of Faith&quot; (1842). Literary critic Rufus Wilmot Griswold that year dedicated twice as much space to Hoffman than any other author in his respected anthology &quot;The Poets and Poetry of America&quot;. Griswold helped Hoffman publish &quot;The Echo&quot;, another collection of poetry, in 1844. Hoffman was also popular for his songs, including &quot;Sparkling and Bright&quot; and &quot;Rosalie Clare.&quot;

Hoffman remained a successful editor and author throughout the 1840s. He officially began a new role as editor of &quot;The Literary World&quot; magazine on May 1, 1847. The weekly journal, which also included Evert Augustus Duyckinck and George Long Duyckinck, ceased publication in 1853.

===Insanity===
Under the strain of work, he went insane in 1849, supposedly after a servant used his manuscripts to start a fire. He was hospitalized briefly in April 1849 and, after his release, he accepted a position with the Department of State in Washington, D.C. By autumn, however, he was declared permanently insane. He spent the last 30 years of his life in the Harrisburg State Hospital, a state asylum in Pennsylvania. It was in Harrisburg that he was diagnosed with chronic mania, or manic-depressive psychosis.

Hoffman died in Harrisburg on June 7, 1884. He was buried at Christ Church Burial Ground following funeral services at the home of his sister-in-law in Philadelphia.

<doc id="1079482" wikidata="Q373500" url="?curid=1079482" title="Bruce Cabot">
<text>Bruce Cabot (born Étienne de Pelissier Bujac Jr.; April 20, 1904 – May 3, 1972) was an American film actor, best remembered as Jack Driscoll in &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933) and for his roles in films such as &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1936), Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Fury&quot; (1936), and the Western &quot;Dodge City&quot; (1939). He was also known as one of &quot;Wayne&#x27;s Regulars&quot;, appearing in a number of John Wayne films beginning with &quot;Angel and the Badman&quot; (1947), and concluding with &quot;Big Jake&quot; (1971).

==Early life==
Cabot was born in Carlsbad, New Mexico, to a prominent local lawyer, Major Étienne de Pelissier Bujac Sr. and Julia Armandine Graves, who died shortly after giving birth to her son. Étienne Sr. was the son of John James Bujac, a lawyer and mining expert in Catonsville, Maryland. Cabot&#x27;s father graduated from Cumberland School of Law near Nashville, Tennessee, and served in the U.S. Army during the Spanish–American War and the Philippine–American War before settling in Carlsbad.

Cabot graduated from Sewanee Military Academy in 1921, and briefly attended the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, but left without graduating.

He worked at many jobs, including as a sailor, an insurance salesman, oil worker, surveyor, and prize fighter; he also sold cars, managed real estate, and worked at a slaughterhouse. A meeting with David O. Selznick at a Hollywood party led to his acting career. He claimed that he auditioned by acting out a scene from the play &quot;Chicago&quot;. The audition went &quot;rather awful&quot; in his opinion, but it did lead to him being cast in &quot;The Roadhouse Murder&quot; (1932).

==Acting career==
===Early roles===
Cabot appeared in nearly 100 feature films. He made his debut in an uncredited bit part in an episode of the serial &quot;Heroes of the Flames&quot; (1931). In &quot;Ann Vickers&quot; (1933), he portrays a soldier who seduces a naive woman (Irene Dunne), and gets her pregnant before he leaves for the war. He then appeared in &quot;King Kong&quot; (also 1933), which became an enormous success and established Cabot as a star.

He also portrays villains in several productions, appearing as a gangster boss in &quot;Let &#x27;Em Have It&quot; (1935) and as the Huron warrior Magua opposite Randolph Scott in &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; (1936). He co-stars with Spencer Tracy in Fritz Lang&#x27;s first Hollywood film, &quot;Fury&quot; (1936), playing the leader of a lynch mob. He also appears with Errol Flynn in Michael Curtiz&#x27;s epic Western &quot;Dodge City&quot;, which in 1939 was one of Warner Bros.&#x27;s biggest hits.

He tested for the lead role of the Ringo Kid in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939), but John Wayne was cast in the part. A consistent box-office draw, Cabot appeared in many movies at many studios before leaving Hollywood to serve in World War II.

===War service and return to Hollywood===
Cabot enlisted in December 1942 and, after Officer Training School in Miami Beach, was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Force. In 1943 Cabot was an Air Transport Command operations officer in Tunis.

Cabot headed back to Hollywood and fell in with John Wayne on the set of &quot;Angel and the Badman&quot; (1947), and became part of Wayne&#x27;s circle, this relationship paying off in the 1960s, when Wayne cast him in 10 more of his films: &quot;The Comancheros&quot; (1961), &quot;Hatari!&quot; (1962), &quot;McLintock!&quot; (1963), &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; (1965), &quot;The War Wagon&quot; (1967), &quot;The Green Berets&quot; (1968), &quot;Hellfighters&quot; (1968), &quot;The Undefeated&quot; (1969), &quot;Chisum&quot; (1970), and &quot;Big Jake&quot; (1971).

In 1965, he played the sheriff in the comedy western &quot;Cat Ballou&quot;.

Cabot&#x27;s final screen appearance is in the James Bond film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971).

He was inducted into the New Mexico Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2012.

===Television===
Cabot starred in a number of the &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot;, a science-fiction drama, during its second season (1952–53) on ABC.

He also appeared on other television series, such as:
*&quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; - &quot;Who Killed Holly Howard?&quot; - Thomas Matherson (1963)
*&quot;Bonanza&quot; - &quot;A Dime&#x27;s Worth of Glory&quot; - Sheriff Reed Larrimore (1964)
*&quot;Daniel Boone&quot; - &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Four&quot; - Simon Bullard (1965)

==Personal life==
On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1926, Cabot married Grace Mary Mather-Smith at the Cathedral Church of St. Luke in Orlando. They divorced in 1930, prior to Cabot&#x27;s move to Hollywood.

On Halloween 1933, Cabot married actress Adrienne Ames at his mother&#x27;s home in Carlsbad. They divorced on July 24, 1935.

On September 17, 1950, Cabot married bit part actress Francesca De Scaffa in Santa Barbara. They divorced in February 1957.

He was one of Errol Flynn&#x27;s social pack for several years, but they fell out during the production of the unfinished &quot;The Story of William Tell&quot; in the mid-1950s. Flynn was producing the film and asked Cabot, whom he described as &quot;an old, old pal,&quot; to appear in it, knowing that Cabot was having difficulty finding work in Hollywood at that time. When Flynn&#x27;s production partners went broke, though, production on the film halted, leaving Flynn stranded in Rome facing financial ruin. Cabot, in an attempt to get paid when other cast members were working for no money, had court officials seize Flynn&#x27;s and co-producer Barry Mahon&#x27;s personal cars and their wives&#x27; clothing from their hotel rooms.

In 1955, Bruce Cabot sued Flynn in a London court for unpaid salary of £17,357 ($48,599.60) saying he had been promised four weeks&#x27; work on the film but did not get it. Flynn wrote angrily in his autobiography of what he termed Cabot&#x27;s &quot;betrayal&quot;, adding the passage: &quot; I never went looking for Cabot. I was afraid I might kill him.&quot;

==Death==
Cabot died May 3, 1972, at age 68 in the Motion Picture Country Home at Woodland Hills, California due to lung cancer. He was buried in his hometown of Carlsbad, New Mexico.

<doc id="1079483" wikidata="Q2142404" url="?curid=1079483" title="Robert Taylor (sprinter, born 1948)">
<text>Robert Taylor (September 14, 1948 – November 13, 2007) was an American sprinter. He became Olympic champion in the 4 × 100 m relay at the 1972 Olympics and placed second in the 100 m final. He is the father of former NFL player Bobby Taylor.

==Career==

Taylor won the AAU championships in the 100-meter dash in 1972.

At the Munich Olympics, Taylor was second in the 100 m. On the way to the final, Taylor was unwittingly a participant in the first athletics controversy of his career. Unlike his teammates Eddie Hart and Rey Robinson, Taylor was narrowly able to reach the start of his quarter-final race, when their coach Stan Wright unknowingly used an outdated Olympic schedule and failed to deliver his athletes to the track in time. As Taylor told it in a 2000 interview with the &quot;Tyler Morning Telegraph&quot;, the three athletes and Wright had left the Olympic village for their quarter-final runs. Whilst waiting for the bus to transport them, they wandered into the ABC-TV headquarters where they saw to their utter horror the athletes lining-up for the first heat, Robinson&#x27;s heat. A frantic dash to the stadium ensued in a car driven by the ABC-TV employee Bill Norris. Both Robinson and Hart, who was scheduled to run in heat 2, were too late. Taylor, who was scheduled to run in heat 3, only had time to rip-off his sweats, put on his running shoes, and do a couple of knee bends before running.

Taylor also ran the second leg for the American 4 × 100 m relay team, which became Olympic champion and equaled the United States&#x27; own world record of 38.19.

==World rankings==

Taylor was voted by the experts at &quot;Track and Field News&quot; to be ranked among the best in the US and the world in the 100 meters sprint event from 1969 to 1972.

==Personal life==
Taylor&#x27;s image from the 1972 Olympics was a central piece of Olympic footage integrated into the music video for Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band&#x27;s 1984 version of Runner.

Taylor graduated from Emmett J. Scott High School in Tyler, Texas in 1968. He then attended Texas Southern University and graduated with a degree in education. After graduation, Taylor worked as a teacher, first at Hogg Middle School in Tyler, and then moved to Houston to teach physical education at Lucian L. Lockhart Elementary in Third Ward, and later special education and physical education at Lovett Elementary in the Meyerland area. He died from a heart attack in Houston at the age of 59. At the time of his death, he was teaching in Missouri City, Texas.

==Awards==
As well as participating at an Olympics, which Taylor has said was &quot;the highlight&quot; of his athletics career, Taylor was a respected family man, athlete and teacher. He received the following accolades:
* All-Southwestern Athletic Conference and NAIA All-American.
* Inducted in 1973 into the Outstanding College Athletes Hall of Fame.
* In 1996, inducted into the Texas Southern University Hall of Fame.
* Inducted in 2007 into the Prairie View Interscholastic League Coaches Hall of Fame.
* Southwestern Conference Hall of Fame.

<doc id="1079485" wikidata="Q527581" url="?curid=1079485" title="Thomas Jefferson Hogg">
<text>Thomas Jefferson Hogg (24 May 1792 – 27 August 1862) was a British barrister and writer best known for his friendship with the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Hogg was raised in County Durham, but spent most of his life in London. He and Shelley became friends while studying at University College, Oxford, and remained close until Shelley&#x27;s death. During their time at Oxford they collaborated on several literary projects, culminating in their joint expulsion following the publication of an essay titled &quot;The Necessity of Atheism&quot;. They remained good friends, but their relationship was sometimes strained because of Hogg&#x27;s attraction to the women who were romantically involved with Shelley.

Hogg became a barrister and met Jane Williams, who had become a close friend of Percy Shelley&#x27;s shortly before the poet&#x27;s death. Jane became Hogg&#x27;s common-law wife and they had two children together. The family settled in London, although Hogg&#x27;s legal career meant that he often had to travel away from home.

While living in London Hogg made the acquaintance of several well-known writers, and he published literary works of his own. He studied Greek literature for much of his life and published several articles on the subject, including two entries in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. Most of the fiction he wrote was poorly reviewed. His best-known literary work was &quot;The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley&quot;, an unfinished biography of the poet. Although the book was well researched and painted a clear picture of Shelley as a young man, it was criticised for portraying him negatively.

Hogg was well connected with Whig politicians. He received an appointment to a government commission on municipal corporations and became a revising barrister. His legal career was moderately successful, but he was often frustrated by his failure to attain his goal of becoming a professor or judge. Nevertheless, he was able to provide for his family thanks to an inheritance and the income from his legal career.

== Early life ==
Thomas Jefferson Hogg was the eldest of John and Prudentia (née Jones) Hogg&#x27;s six children. He was given his paternal grandfather&#x27;s first name and his paternal grandmother&#x27;s last name. John&#x27;s father was the son of a wealthy businessman and Prudentia&#x27;s father was a Welsh clergyman. Although John was trained as a barrister, he did not practise law regularly. He instead devoted his time to managing his estate and serving as a justice of the peace. The family lived in a Georgian manor known as Norton House, situated outside Stockton-on-Tees.

As a young man, Hogg read many books, including &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; and the &quot;Life of Johnson&quot;. John taught his son Greek and Latin. Every summer the family rented a house in Seaton Carew, where Hogg often hunted, fished and went horse riding. He attended a preparatory school in Ferrybridge for four years before moving to Durham School at the age of 12, which his father and grandfather had also attended.
== Oxford ==
In 1810, Hogg went up to University College, Oxford, his father&#x27;s alma mater. There he met and became friends with Percy Bysshe Shelley in October 1810. Hogg and Shelley often discussed literature and metaphysics, had a shared disdain for religion and Oxford society, and were united in their belief in free love and free thinking. Although Shelley&#x27;s father initially feared that his son was being corrupted by Hogg&#x27;s ideas, he was reassured when he learned that Hogg was from a respectable family.

Hogg and Shelley collaborated on a pamphlet of &quot;mock revolutionary&quot; poetry in late 1810, &quot;Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson&quot;, that they attributed to Nicholson herself. She was a mentally unstable washerwoman who in 1786 had attempted to stab King George III with a dessert knife. They also composed a novel together, &quot;Lenora&quot;, but could not find a printer who was willing to publish such a subversive work.

In early 1811, Shelley and Hogg published &quot;The Necessity of Atheism&quot;, which outraged the Oxford authorities. Although it was published anonymously, suspicion soon fell on the pair. They refused either to acknowledge or to deny writing the work, and were expelled from Oxford as a result.

== York ==
After leaving Oxford, Hogg was sent to York to serve a legal apprenticeship. Timothy Shelley was furious when he learned of the expulsion, but John Hogg was not minded to discipline his son or to forbid him from associating with Percy Shelley. Prudentia Hogg, who was an Evangelical Christian, was shocked when she learned that her son was promoting atheism. She was further angered when she learned that her son had become a vegetarian, a decision that she attributed to Shelley&#x27;s corrupting influence.

Hogg found employment in a conveyancer&#x27;s office in York. Percy Shelley initially planned to visit him, but changed his plans in the spring of 1811 after he fell in love with a young woman named Harriet Westbrook. Shelley had always been opposed to the institution of marriage, but he cared deeply for Harriet and feared she would leave him if they did not marry. Hogg repeatedly made the case to Shelley that marriage was in Harriet&#x27;s best interests. Shelley was eventually persuaded and eloped with Harriet to Edinburgh.

That autumn Hogg visited the couple in Edinburgh, which he greatly enjoyed. Hogg soon became very attracted to Harriet, and often spent time alone with her whenever Percy asked to write in solitude. Hogg eventually told Harriet of his feelings towards her, but she politely rebuffed him, and began to read novels with moral themes aloud in his presence.

After a stay of six weeks, Hogg had to return to the conveyancer&#x27;s office in York, and the Shelleys decided to accompany him back to his home in that city. In October 1811 Percy left for London to mediate in a dispute between his father and his uncle. Harriet remained with Hogg, who soon made further unsuccessful romantic advances towards her. Harriet&#x27;s mother soon learned that Hogg and her daughter were living together, and sent Harriet&#x27;s sister to stay with them. Harriet complained to Percy Shelley on his return about the way Hogg had treated her; Percy was offended, but nevertheless remained on friendly terms with Hogg. Troubled by the distress felt by his housemates, Percy Shelley suddenly decided to leave York with Harriet and her sister. Hogg subsequently sent him a series of angry letters in which he complained about how he had been treated. In his replies Shelley maintained that he still valued free love, but had left to calm Harriet. Hogg and Shelley subsequently exchanged many emotional letters over the course of the following two months, but then ceased communicating for a year.

In 1811 Hogg wrote a picaresque novel, &quot;Memoirs of Prince Alexy Haimatoff&quot;. He published it anonymously, with the claim that it had been translated from Latin by a man named John Brown at Prince Haimatoff&#x27;s request. The book did not sell very well. Later critics have noted a resemblance between Haimatoff and Percy Shelley. Shelley wrote a mostly positive review of the book published in &quot;The Critical Review&quot; in 1814, but he did criticise the author for promoting &quot;promiscuous concubinage&quot;, apparently a veiled reference to Hogg&#x27;s attempts to seduce Harriet.

== Law studies ==

Hogg moved from York to London in the spring of 1812 to study law. He tried to conceal his political views from his classmates and spent long hours studying law and reading Greek literature. In 1813 Hogg reconciled with the Shelleys after they visited him in London. They remained in contact after the couple left on a journey to Wales and Ireland. In April 1814, Hogg went to Ireland in an attempt to cheer up Percy Shelley, who had complained of poor spirits in a letter. The Shelleys did not receive Hogg&#x27;s last letter before he embarked on the journey and had left Dublin before he arrived. Unable to locate them, he returned home. Shelley soon travelled back to London as well.

In the summer of 1814, Hogg first met Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin while visiting William Godwin with Percy Shelley. Soon Hogg heard that Shelley had abandoned Harriet and eloped with Mary to Continental Europe. They returned later that year and Hogg was re-introduced to Mary in November 1814. Although she was initially cool towards him, Mary soon began to enjoy his frequent visits. Hogg became very attracted to Mary Shelley, and when Percy learned of his feelings towards her he encouraged both of them to have an affair, as an expression of free love. Mary, too, valued free love and was initially open to the idea, until she learned that she was pregnant.
The Shelleys moved to Windsor in the summer of 1815. Hogg visited them there when his workload permitted. They left England for Continental Europe again in May 1816, and Hogg resumed his visits after their return, but he was no longer as close to them as he had been. This was in part due to his awkwardness with Mary, who was preoccupied with her efforts to finish writing &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Percy and Hogg were nonetheless able to convince Mary to attend the opera with them on a few occasions.

Percy Shelley soon decided to leave England for Italy in an attempt to improve his health, despite Hogg&#x27;s attempts to dissuade him. He often invited Hogg to visit him and Mary, which he never did.

John and Prudentia Hogg were glad to hear that the Shelleys had left England, hoping that their son would become more conservative in Percy&#x27;s absence. They were disappointed with his continued rejection of their Tory political views, but he did attend church with them during his visits and was no longer a vegetarian. They were also somewhat concerned about Hogg&#x27;s association with the radical publisher Leigh Hunt and his circle of friends. Through Hunt, Hogg became acquainted with several members of London&#x27;s literary circles, including Thomas Love Peacock, Charles Lamb and Walter Coulson. Hogg also met John Keats, who gave him a copy of his first book of poetry.

Hogg was called to the bar at the Michaelmas term in 1817, and often practised law in Northumberland and Durham. He frequently visited his family, with whom he was then on good terms. His reserved personality proved to be a hindrance to his career, and he remained dependent on financial assistance from his father. He continued studying Greek, and an article that he wrote on Apuleius was published in the third issue of &quot;The Liberal&quot; in 1822. A paper that he submitted for the fourth issue was rejected, causing him to resent the editors.

== Jane Williams ==

In 1823 Hogg met Jane Williams while they were both visiting Percy Shelley&#x27;s friend John Gisborne, husband of Maria Gisborne. Jane and her common-law husband Edward Ellerker Williams had been housemates of Shelley&#x27;s shortly before his death. Edward Williams and Shelley died in a boating accident, leaving Jane alone with two young children. Hogg soon became very enamoured with her. They saw each other at the Gisborne household regularly during the autumn and early winter of 1823. That December he went back to Northern England to see his family. While he was there, he began writing to Jane regularly. The following spring he frequently visited her at her mother&#x27;s house, and they often took long walks together. In March she moved out of her mother&#x27;s house into a home of her own, allowing Hogg to see her more freely.

Jane was still legally married. Therefore, Hogg risked his family&#x27;s wrath if he pursued a relationship with her. The couple were initially very discreet, and even denied to close friends that they were romantically involved. The situation was eased by the death of Hogg&#x27;s father&#x27;s in late 1823; the inheritance he received assured his financial security.

In 1825 Hogg accompanied his brother John on a tour of Continental Europe. Jane encouraged him to take the trip, believing that it would be a test of his commitment to her. He returned to England in February 1826. Although Hogg enjoyed the trip, he missed reading Greek literature and English newspapers. Writing the journals that were published in 1827 under the title &quot;Two Hundred and Nine Days&quot; occupied much of his time during the trip. He frequently attacked the Catholic Church and customs officials in his journals, but he often made positive observations about the lifestyles of many of the ordinary people that he met. Hogg also recounted his visit to the grave of Percy Shelley in Italy.

== Children ==
Jane became pregnant in spring 1827 and moved into Hogg&#x27;s house. She then became known as Mrs Hogg, and he devoted himself to being a father to her two children.

Few people in London other than their close friends knew that the couple were not married. Hogg&#x27;s family had heard rumours that he was planning to marry, and had been curious to know whom he had chosen. They were very upset after hearing of his plans for a union with Jane. His mother was unwilling to introduce Jane to their social circles as Mrs Hogg, which ensured that she would never visit them. Hogg did not enter his family&#x27;s house in Durham for seven years after he informed them of his relationship with Jane. Word of their union spread throughout Durham, and Hogg stopped practising law there for some time because of the damage to his reputation. Several of their friends were supportive of their union. Mary Shelley particularly approved of their match, despite having earlier been jealous of the time Hogg had spent with Jane.

The couple&#x27;s first child, Mary Prudentia Hogg, was born in November 1827. Her parents did their best not to spread the news, because she was born soon after they began cohabiting. Mary Prudentia died in May 1829. Jane gave birth to their second daughter, Prudentia, in 1836, and Mary Shelley was selected as her godmother. Hogg&#x27;s friendship with Mary Shelley was disrupted several years later, however, when she republished Percy Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Queen Mab&quot; in 1839. Hogg rebuked her for leaving out its previous dedication to Harriet Shelley, and they did not communicate with each other for several years.

== Legal career and scholarship ==
Hogg continued studying Greek literature and was able to publish some of his opinions about the Greeks in the radical &quot;Westminster Review&quot;. He used the opportunity to criticise the treatment of the Greeks in the Tory publication &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;. This article caused some controversy among Hogg&#x27;s conservative legal colleagues.

Because the advancement of his legal career had been hindered by his marriage to Jane, Hogg hoped to receive a legal appointment from a politically connected acquaintance. This was not an immediate option because the Whig party was in opposition, but in the summer of 1827 Henry Brougham promised Hogg a future position as a professor of civil law at the newly created University College London. Hogg embarked on a course of study in preparation, but the professorship was not established owing to a lack of funds. This setback upset Hogg greatly, and he became very bitter about it. A lecture that he had intended to give at his inauguration was published in 1831.

Hogg had also hoped that his friend Thomas Love Peacock, who worked for the East India Company, would recommend him for a position there. To Hogg&#x27;s dismay Peacock would not help him, although several years later Peacock did help Hogg&#x27;s stepson gain employment with the company.
Hogg published &quot;Shelley at Oxford&quot;, an account of his memories of Shelley in &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot; in 1833. The article was heavily edited after its submission, which irritated him greatly. The editing was effective however, and many reviewers were very impressed by the finished product. He also contributed articles to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. One notable article was a review of the first volume of Barthold Georg Niebuhr&#x27;s &quot;Römische Geschichte&quot;. The editor of the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, Macvey Napier, chose another writer to review the second volume, which infuriated Hogg.

Henry Brougham became Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom after a Whig election victory. In 1833 he appointed Hogg to a lucrative position on the royal commission to examine the municipal corporations. Hogg became a fierce critic of the resulting Municipal Corporations Act 1835; he preferred a more deliberate and less ideological approach than most of his fellow commission members, and was considered by many to be an unusually conservative Whig. His commission work required him to be away from home for an extended period, which proved to be very difficult for Jane. She knew that Hogg was free to abandon her at any time because they were not legally married. After receiving his appointment, Hogg finally visited Norton House after a seven-year absence, but his family had not altered their opinion of his relationship with Jane.

After his service on the commission ended, Hogg resumed practising law in Northern England, where his brother John had also recently begun to practise. John soon became offended by his brother, objecting to his attempt to use family connections to advance his career.

Hogg gained the position of revising barrister for Northumberland and Berwick in 1838. This required him to travel to Northern England twice a year. Jane often complained about these trips, but Hogg enjoyed visiting the north. He hoped that his legal service would earn him an appointment as a judge, but he was to be disappointed.

In 1841 Hogg wrote &quot;Some Recollections of Childhood&quot;, a historical novel set in London at the time of the Norman Conquest. He published its chapters in instalments in Edward Bulwer&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Chronicle&quot;. The book was not well received by critics, who complained of its discursive nature and poor character development; William Makepeace Thackeray published a particularly scathing review. Hogg had gained a reputation as a Greek scholar however, and contributed to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;; he was the author of the &quot;Alphabet&quot; and &quot;Antiquities&quot; entries in the seventh edition.

== Family conflicts ==
In 1843 Hogg became the target of a blackmail attempt by John Edward Johnson, Jane&#x27;s husband. Johnson provided journalist Barnard Gregory with the details of Jane&#x27;s marital status. Gregory soon published a report on her in &quot;The Satirist&quot;, but made a crucial mistake. Gregory claimed that the wife of James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly, was legally married to another man, prompting James Hogg to initiate a libel suit against Gregory. Johnson quickly disappeared after he learned of the error. Gregory was convicted of libel and served a brief prison sentence. Following his release he prepared a correction that he intended for publication, which could have threatened Hogg&#x27;s legal position. Hogg appealed to Leigh Hunt, who convinced Gregory not to publish. John Edward Johnson died in 1840, ensuring that Jane would never be blackmailed because of her marital status. Although Hogg and Jane were now free to marry they chose not to, to avoid revealing their situation.

Hogg&#x27;s mother Prudentia died in 1839. As a condition of his father&#x27;s will, upon the death of his mother, Thomas Jefferson Hogg could purchase his brother&#x27;s share of Norton House. He decided not to, because of the potential cost of maintaining the house and the hostility Jane could face there. Instead, he allowed his brother to buy his interest in the house, a decision that led to conflict between the two brothers regarding the price and timing of the sale. They eventually worked out the details, and their relationship became friendlier once the sale was completed.

Hogg and his family subsequently lived a mostly quiet and stable life together. At times their finances were strained, although they were able to afford a cook and a maid. Hogg enjoyed spending time with his children and paid particular attention to their education. He taught his daughter Prudentia Greek and Latin, but discouraged her from becoming a Bluestocking. Hogg also tried to convince Jane to study Greek, but was unsuccessful. Henry Cleveland, Jane&#x27;s nephew, moved into their household after leaving the military. Hogg then accepted Henry as a member of the family. Gardening had always been a hobby of Hogg&#x27;s, and in his later years he often spent time maintaining his gardens with Jane.

The family&#x27;s domestic peace was shattered when Hogg&#x27;s stepdaughter Jane Rosalind became romantically involved with Henry Hunt, the son of Leigh Hunt. Hunt had no clear employment prospects, causing Thomas and Jane to doubt the wisdom of a union. Hogg was very gentle when discussing this with his stepdaughter, hoping to avoid treating her the way that Timothy Shelley had treated Percy Shelley years earlier, but Mary Shelley thought that Hogg took much too passive a stance. Thomas and Jane decided to send Jane Rosalind to France in an unsuccessful attempt to distract her, but she soon returned and married Hunt.

== &quot;The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley&quot; ==

In 1857, Sir Percy Shelley, 3rd Baronet, the poet&#x27;s only surviving child, invited Hogg to produce a biography of his father, who had died more than 30 years earlier. The Shelley family provided Hogg with a number of Percy Shelley&#x27;s papers for use in his research.

The first two volumes of &quot;The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley&quot; were published in 1858, but were poorly received by critics. The book was not as well edited as his previous article and many felt that it did not contain the insights about Shelley and his works that &quot;Shelley at Oxford&quot; did. The reception was not universally negative however, and several of Shelley&#x27;s friends enjoyed the book. The Shelley family was very upset at the way Shelley was portrayed; they demanded the return of Shelley&#x27;s papers and obtained an injunction preventing the publication of any further volumes. Hogg had begun writing a third, but it was never completed.

== Death ==
In later life Hogg suffered from gout, which forced him to curtail many of his activities. He died in his sleep in 1862 at the age of 70. His brother John wrote a very positive obituary for &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

Hogg left an estate with a net worth of £17,000 (equivalent to about £ in 2025), most of which went to his daughter, but Jane was also provided for. His brother was bequeathed his collection of books. His sisters, who were by then fairly wealthy, were left only token amounts. Hogg was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, where Jane was buried beside him 22 years later.

<doc id="1079487" wikidata="Q7638279" url="?curid=1079487" title="Sun Drop">
<text>Sun Drop is a citrus-flavored soft drink produced by Keurig Dr Pepper with a yellowish-green color. Among soft drinks, it is known for its high caffeine content. Orange juice concentrate is an ingredient in the drink. Bottled Sun Drop uses real sugar cane, which contains some &quot;pulp&quot; giving Sun Drop its distinct flavor and appearance. Sun Drop competes primarily against the Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s Mello Yello and PepsiCo&#x27;s Mountain Dew.

==History==
Sun Drop was developed in Missouri by Charles Lazier, a salesman of beverage concentrates. While riding around town in the family car, Lazier quickly scribbled a recipe for a new soft drink on a small piece of paper which he handed to his son, Charles Jr. The younger Lazier worked as a lab technician at his father’s plant, and soon began work on the formula. Two years later, in 1951, Sun Drop Cola debuted at the American Bottlers of Carbonated Beverages Conference in Washington, D.C. The Sun Drop formula was patented on April 15, 1930.
Gastonia, NC was the headquarters for bottling Sun Drop for over 50 years till 2016.
The drink was marketed in several Southern states under names such as &quot;Sundrop Golden Cola&quot; or &quot;Golden Girl Cola.&quot; The brand was acquired and standardized by Crush International in 1970. Crush International was purchased by Procter &amp; Gamble in 1980, which sold its soft drinks holdings to Cadbury Schweppes plc in 1989. Cadbury Schweppes demerged in 2008, with its beverage unit becoming Keurig Dr Pepper, which currently produces Sun Drop.
Prior to the sale to Cadbury Schweppes, Procter &amp; Gamble introduced several new Sun Drop flavors in 1985, including a reformulated Diet Sun Drop brand using aspartame instead of saccharin. A third brand, Cherry-Lemon Sun Drop, was introduced that same year. In February 2002, the brand introduced Caffeine-Free Sun Drop to the portfolio after the company received numerous requests from loyal consumers for a caffeine-free version of their favorite citrus soft drink. A diet variant of Cherry Lemon Sun Drop was introduced 2014.

Sun Drop has maintained popularity in many parts of the Southern United States, especially in Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina and parts of the Midwestern United States, including Wisconsin and western Minnesota. Similar to other regional drinks with a cult following, fans outside bottling areas have been known to pay large amounts to have the drink shipped to them. Families have sent it to U.S. soldiers serving in Afghanistan.

Sun Drop is sometimes used as a mixer for drinks with hard liquor.

Sun Drop is the official drink of the nationally recognized &quot;Fancy Farm Picnic&quot; in Fancy Farm, Kentucky.

In the 1970s until the early 1990s, the drink was promoted in the American South by NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt. His son Dale Earnhardt Jr. was also sponsored by Sun Drop in the late model series in 1993; they will reunite for the CARS Tour race at North Wilkesboro Speedway on August 31, 2022.

The soft drink was a leading sponsor for racecar driver Ryan Hunter-Reay in the IndyCar Series for Andretti Autosport from 2011 to 2013.

Carolina Beverage Corp. bought Sun Drop Bottling Co. of Concord effective December 1, 2016. The Concord, North Carolina plant closed.

==Expansion==
Keurig Dr Pepper distributed Sun Drop nationwide beginning in 2011, with a new campaign that features an updated web site, a Facebook page, and a promotional deal with MTV. The Sun Drop marketing plan is a component of Keurig Dr Pepper&#x27;s efforts to expand its non-cola soda sales and is targeting drinkers of PepsiCo&#x27;s Mountain Dew brand of soft drinks in the United States. Sun Drop&#x27;s expansion occurred several months after Coca-Cola brought its high-caffeine citrus drink Mello Yello nationwide.

Dr Pepper Snapple entered into an agreement with Scratch, MTV&#x27;s marketing agency. Scratch will develop new Sun Drop advertising and branding, including a new design for the can. MTV will also feature Sun Drop in programming, including on its reality series &quot;The Real World&quot;.

==Varieties==
There are six varieties of the drink:
* Sun Drop (green can, green label, 64 mg caffeine per 12 fl oz can; 105 mg caffeine per 20 fl oz bottle)
* Diet Sun Drop (white can, white label, 68 mg caffeine per 12 fl oz can; 114 mg caffeine per 20 fl oz bottle)
* Caffeine-Free Sun Drop
* Caffeine-Free Diet Sun Drop
* Cherry Lemon Sun Drop (64 mg caffeine)
* Diet Cherry Lemon Sun Drop

Sun Drop that is bottled in glass bottles is typically sweetened with sugar instead of corn syrup, providing a slightly different taste.

<text>Half Rate (HR or GSM-HR or GSM 06.20) is a speech coding system for GSM, developed in the early 1990s.

Since the codec, operating at 5.6 kbit/s, requires half the bandwidth of the Full Rate codec, network capacity for voice traffic is doubled, at the expense of audio quality. The sampling rate is 8 kHz with resolution 13 bit, frame length 160 samples (20 ms) and subframe length 40 samples (5 ms).

GSM Half Rate is specified in ETSI EN 300 969 (GSM 06.20), and uses a form of the VSELP algorithm. Previous specification was in ETSI ETS 300 581–2, which first edition was published in December 1995.

For some Nokia phones one can configure the use of this codec:

* To activate HR codec use enter the following code: *4720#
* To deactivate HR codec use enter the following code: #4720#

<doc id="1079493" wikidata="Q283094" url="?curid=1079493" title="Josiah Gilbert Holland">
<text>Josiah Gilbert Holland (July 24, 1819 – October 12, 1881) was an American novelist, essayist, poet and spiritual mentor to the Nation in the years following the Civil War. Born in Western Massachusetts, he was “the most successful man of letters in the United States” in the latter half of the nineteenth century and sold more books in his lifetime than Mark Twain did in his.

Known often by his initials “J.G.,” Holland penned the first biography of Abraham Lincoln just months after his assassination, which was a bestseller. Holland was the first to publish the first known poem written by an African American.

One of Holland’s novels was among the earliest examples of the genre that became literary realism. He published a few poems of Emily Dickinson’s in the newspaper that he edited. Holland and his wife, Elizabeth Chapin Holland, were close friends with her.

Holland became a popular Lyceum lecturer and wrote advice essays under the pseudonym Timothy Titcomb as well as lyrics to hymns, including the beloved Methodist Christmas tune &quot;There&#x27;s a Song in the Air.” He helped establish and was editor of the middle-class flagship magazine &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;.

Though Holland was a contemporary of the canonical and more renowned poet Walt Whitman and the novelist Herman Melville, neither “ever tasted the sweets of success as Holland did, perhaps, because neither wrote what the nation’s readers cared so much about.” His writings are quoted by politicians and pastors alike though few today recognize Holland’s name.

==Biography==
Born along the Hop Brook near the intersection of Federal Street and Orchard Road, in the village of Dwight, in Belchertown, Massachusetts, on July 24, 1819, Holland grew up in a poor family struggling to make ends meet. He spent only a few years at the low-slung family farmhouse at Dwight and later quipped that he’d like to “burn it to the ground.” The youngest of six children, his parents were deeply religious and evangelical, from pious Puritan stock.

His father moved the family every year or two: Heath, back to Belchertown, South Hadley, Granby and Northampton. Josiah worked in a factory to help the family. He then spent a short time studying at Northampton High School before withdrawing due to ill health. He tried daguerreotypy and taught penmanship from town to town, reciting &quot;his own poems to his intimate friends.&quot;

He saved enough money to study medicine at Berkshire Medical College, where he took a degree in 1843. Hoping to become a successful physician, he began a medical practice with classmate Dr. Charles Bailey in Springfield, Massachusetts. He then opened a women’s hospital in Springfield with his former roommate from college, Charles Robinson, who would become the first governor of the State of Kansas, but it failed within six months.

== Marriage and career ==
In 1845 he married Elizabeth Luna Chapin, “the scion of an old and substantial Springfield family.” She would become a confidant and intimate friend of Emily Dickinson.

In early 1847, Holland begin publishing a newspaper, &quot;The Bay State Weekly Courier&quot;, but the attempt proved unsuccessful, as did his medical practice. He also published work in the Southern Literary Messenger.

He left New England that spring for the South, and took a teaching position in Richmond, Virginia, followed by one in Vicksburg, Mississippi, where he was named superintendent and implemented the ideas of fellow Massachusetts educator and reformer Horace Mann.

In fall 1848, he and his wife were invited to a large cotton plantation in northeastern Louisiana and Holland wrote down his observations. Here he received word that his poetry would be published in the &quot;Knickerbocker Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Home Journal.&quot; 
=== Springfield ===
In April 1849, Holland and his wife returned to Western Massachusetts. His mother-in-law was dying and his wife went to care for her. The following month he was offered $40 a month as assistant editor of the &quot;Springfield Daily Republican,&quot; where he began working with the younger, formidable and charming owner—the journalist and editor Samuel Bowles.

On Wednesday, September 26, 1849, the &quot;Republican&quot; began publishing Holland&#x27;s writing of plantation life in a seven-part series, though uncredited, titled, &quot;Three Weeks on a Cotton Plantation.&quot; They were well-received by a curious public. He wrote local news and essays, many of which were collected and published in book form, helping establish his literary reputation. Bowles encouraged Holland to publish under the pseudonym Timothy Titcomb, which he did to great success.

Under the editorial leadership of Bowles and Holland, the &quot;Republican&quot; became the most widely-read and respected small city daily in America. In 1851, Holland received an A.B. honorary doctorate degree from Amherst College, a few miles north from his birthplace, where Edward Dickinson (Emily Dickinson&#x27;s father) was treasurer.

Holland&#x27;s first book under his birth name was a two-volume &quot;History of Western Massachusetts&quot; (1855), the first book to feature a poem by a Black woman poet in the U.S. He followed in 1857 with an historical novel, &quot;The Bay-Path: A Tale of Colonial New England Life,&quot; and a collection of essays titled &quot;Titcomb&#x27;s Letters to Young People, Single and Married&quot; in 1858. There were at least fifty editions of this book. He also published his narrative poem “Bitter-Sweet” that year. In 1857, he began touring on the Lyceum lecture circuit, soon mentioned with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Bayard Taylor and George William Curtis.

&quot;Gold-Foil: Hammered from Popular Proverbs&quot; under his Timothy Titcomb pen name came out in 1859. He published his second novel, &quot;Miss Gilbert‘s Career: An American Story&quot;, in 1860. It is considered one of the first novels of American Realism, anticipating “much abler and more penetrating realists” who would come later that century. The year following he released &quot;Lessons in Life: A Series of Familiar Essays&quot; (1861).

In 1862, he erected an opulent home in the Italianate villa style (also called a “Swiss-chalet style”). It was located on a bluff overlooking the Connecticut River in North Springfield near present day 110 Atwater Terrace. Holland named the mansion “Brightwood”; it was painted Venetian red. The neighborhood today retains the name Brightwood. When Sam Bowles took an extended trip to Europe, Holland temporarily assumed the duties as editor-in-chief of the &quot;Springfield Republican&quot;. After the Civil War he reduced his editorial duties and wrote many of his most popular works, including the &quot;Life of Abraham Lincoln&quot; (1866), and &quot;Kathrina: Her Life and Mine, In a Poem&quot; (1867).

=== Lincoln ===
Holland wrote an eloquent eulogy of Abraham Lincoln within days of Lincoln&#x27;s death, prompting a commission for a full biography of the late president. He quickly pulled together the lengthy &quot;&quot;, finished in February 1866. The 544-page bestseller portrayed Lincoln as an emancipator opposed to slavery and began many enduring myths about the slain President.

=== New York ===
He moved with his family to 46 Park Avenue in New York City in 1872. These years in New York were also productive for his own literary efforts. During the 1870s he published three novels: &quot;Arthur Bonnicastle&quot; (1873), &quot;Sevenoaks&quot; (1875), and &quot;Nicholas Minturn&quot; (1877), which first were serialized in Scribners (afterwards it became &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;). His poetry volumes included &quot;The Marble Prophecy&quot; (1872), &quot;The Mistress and the Manse&quot; (1874), and &quot;The Puritan&#x27;s Guest&quot; (1881). 

In 1877, Holland erected a summer house on one of the Thousand Islands in upstate New York, in Alexandria Bay, where one of its streets is named for him. He gave the mansion itself the name “Bonniecastle” from the name of the titular hero of his novel, &quot;Arthur Bonnicastle&quot; (1873). It is known as the Bonnie Castle Resort &amp; Marina today.

== Death ==
Josiah Gilbert Holland died on October 12, 1881, at the age of 62, in New York City of heart failure. The evening prior, he “remained late at the office to finish an editorial tribute to the martyred President James A. Garfield,” who had been assassinated a few weeks before. Most small town newspapers and major metropolitan dailies published memorial tributes to Holland, including journals that had often spoken scornfully of his “literary mediocrity, his triteness, and his intellectual parochialism.” John Greenleaf Whittier, the American Quaker poet and abolitionist, consistently praised Holland throughout his life and upon his death. The New York Times referred to J.G. Holland as “one of the most celebrated writers which this country has produced.”

Holland is buried in Springfield Cemetery in Springfield, Massachusetts. His imposing monument includes a bas-relief portrait sculpted by the eminent American 19th-century sculptor, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and includes the Latin inscription &quot;Et vitam impendere vero&quot; meaning &quot;to devote life to truth&quot;.

==Legacy and influence==
Although Josiah Gilbert Holland’s 23 books of fiction, nonfiction and poetry are rarely read today, during the late nineteenth century they were enormously popular and by 1894 more than 750,000 volumes were sold.

Holland was born at the beginning of the period of romanticism in American literature. He is considered one of the fireside poets such as contemporaries William Cullen Bryant and James Russell Lowell and his work appeared in anthologies, featuring domestic themes, messages of morality and focused on a historical romantic past. He is also categorized as among the ”minor” New England authors of the transcendental period.

In the &quot;History of American Literature&quot; by Leonidas Warren Payne, Jr., and published in 1919, Holland is “said to have reached a wider popular audience than most of the other minor poets.” Called &quot;a poetic &#x27;play&#x27; infused with the beauties of Christianity,&quot; Holland&#x27;s first book-length poem &quot;Bitter-Sweet: A Poem&quot; (1858, 220 pp.) sold 90,000 copies by 1894 and remained in print four decades after his death. Thirty years after Holland&#x27;s death, an &quot;outstandingly authoritative commentator upon American literature&quot; called &quot;Arthur Bonnicastle&quot; &quot;the best&quot; of Holland&#x27;s five novels and another wrote that it was “undoubtedly Holland&#x27;s masterpiece.&quot; The novel remained in print into the 1920s.

In 1875, Holland wrote a letter to be read at the dedication of a monument to Edgar Allan Poe, the poet and writer, though Holland wrote that the man and his poetry were “without value.” Holland was against Women&#x27;s suffrage but donated funds to the New England Female Medical College in Boston. He was member of a Springfield church (North Congregationalist) that was frequented by abolitionists, freedmen and fugitive slaves though Josiah was not considered an abolitionist.

Literary clubs in Holland’s honor formed in towns and cities across the country, especially in the Midwest. Newspapers published memorials on the hundredth anniversary of his birth. Fans obtained wood from maple trees standing in the yard of his birthplace at Dwight, Mass., to fashion into memorabilia such as penholders. The doorstone of his birthplace, which burned to the ground in 1876, was recovered in 1932 and placed at the Stone House Museum, which also displays first editions of his works.

== On Emily Dickinson ==
J. G. Holland and his wife were frequent correspondents and intimate family friends of poet Emily Dickinson. She was a guest at their Springfield home on numerous occasions. Dickinson sent more than ninety letters to the Hollands between 1853 and 1886 in which she shares “the details of life that one would impart to a close family member: the status of the garden, the health and activities of members of the household, references to recently-read books.”

Emily was a poet “influenced by transcendentalism and dark romanticism,” and her work bridged “the gap to Realism.” Of the ten poems published in Dickinson&#x27;s lifetime, the Springfield Daily Republican, with Sam Bowles and Josiah Holland as editors, published five, all unsigned, between 1852 and 1866. Some scholars believe that Bowles promoted her the most; Dickinson wrote letters and sent her poems to both men. Later, as editor of Scribner’s Monthly beginning in 1870, Holland told Dickinson’s childhood friend Emily Fowler Ford that he had “some poems of Dickinson’s] under consideration for publication [in Scribner’s Monthly]—but they really are not suitable—they are too ethereal.”

== Publishes oldest African American poem ==
Josiah Gilbert Holland published the oldest known work of literature written by an African American in North America. A 16-year-old named Lucy Terry (1733–1821) witnessed two White families attacked by Native Americans in 1746. The fight took place in Deerfield, Mass. Known as “Bars Fight,” her poem was told orally until it was published, thirty-three years after her death, first in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Springfield Daily Republican&quot;, on November 20, 1854, as an excerpt from Holland&#x27;s &quot;History of Western Massachusetts&quot;, which was published as a book the following year.

== On Melville and Whitman ==
Holland, Herman Melville and Walt Whitman were born the same year.

Holland, as associate editor of &quot;The Republican,&quot; was critically favorable to canonical novelist Herman Melville and as co-founder and editor of &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, Holland turned down publishing the more widely read canonical poet Walt Whitman.

Considered a writer and man of &quot;Victorian virtue,&quot; J.G. Holland found Whitman&#x27;s poetry “immoral.” Whitman later called Holland, “a man of his time, not possessed of the slightest forereach; ... the style of man ... who can tell the difference between a dime and a fifty-cent piece—but is useless for occasions of more serious moment.” The irony was that Holland wrote a bestseller after the “more serious moment” of President Lincoln’s assassination. All the same, even &quot;Springfield Republican&quot; publisher Samuel Bowles &quot;thought Holland something of a prig.” A later biographer had this to say: That Josiah Gilbert Holland remained priggish and prudish to the end of his days is all too abundantly attested. His provincial ethical standards; his subconscious ; his incorrigible moralizing; his stubborn opposition to woman suffrage; his failure to distinguish between social drinking and debauchery, between light wine and strong whisky, between beer and rum, between the intelligent frankness of Walt Whitman and the vulgar pornography of &quot;The Black Crook&quot;—all these remained almost as irritatingly obtrusive at the end of his career as at the beginning. 

== On the word &quot;jazz&quot; ==
Holland coined a term that later became the word &quot;jazz.&quot; The earliest tracing in the Oxford English Dictionary finds that “jasm” first appears in Holland’s 1860 novel, : “‘She&#x27;s just like her mother... Oh! she’s just as full of jasm!’.. ‘Now tell me what jasm is.’.. ‘If you&#x27;ll take thunder and lightening [sic], and a steamboat and a buzz-saw, and mix &#x27;em up, and put &#x27;em into a woman, that&#x27;s jasm.’”

The word was used to describe the &quot;inexpressible personal force of the Yankee&quot; and morphed into the word “jazz” in the early twentieth century.

== Postbellum spiritual mentor ==

In the devastating wake of the American Civil War, Holland offered Americans spiritual guidance and ultimately, hope.That there was a Dr. Holland, a man who brought hope, reassurance, continuity and order into a chaotic, threatening world was itself a fact of great spiritual significance for millions of Americans. Unlike Henry Ward Beecher, whom he steadfastly supported, nothing even remotely suspect ever came near him. Instead, in such essays as &quot;The Reconstruction of National Morality,&quot; published in April 1876, and &quot;Falling from High Places,&quot; published in April 1878, he offered acute analyses of why, in the post-war years, so many Americans, including prominent Christian leaders, had succumbed to the temptation of attempting to obtain great riches dishonestly. Such was the sanctity of Holland&#x27;s own life that he seemed to offer a living, earthly warrant for the promise of eternity that he pictured in his writings.Of poets and their mission, Holland wrote: The poets of the world are the prophets of humanity. They forever reach after and foresee the ultimate good. They are evermore building the Paradise that it is to be, painting the Millennium that is to come. When the world shall reach the poet’s ideal, it will arrive at perfection; and much good will it do the world to measure itself by this ideal and struggle to lift the real to its lofty level.He also wrote: &quot;God never said it would be easy, He just said He would go with me.&quot;

Holland’s narrative poem &quot;“&quot;Bitter-Sweet” would become one of his most popular, and was described in 1894, by biographer Harriette Merrick Plunkett, as, Dr. Holland’s reflections on the mysteries of Life and Death, on the soul-wracking problems of Doubt and Faith, on the existence of Evil as one of the vital conditions of the universe, on the questions of Predestination, Original Sin, Free-will, and the whole haunting brood of Calvinistic theological metaphysics. She declared it to be “truly an original poem,” and compared it to the works of Robert Burns or Sir Walter Scott. She cited the praise that it had earned from poet James Russell Lowell. Today, a Holland sentence or paragraph is still quoted by politicians, artists and spiritual leaders alike, including Martin Luther King, Jr., though few recognize his name.

== In film ==
In 1920, Holland’s novel &quot;Sevenoaks&quot; (1875) was adapted into the Goldwyn comedy-drama, Jes&#x27; Call Me Jim, starring Will Rogers.

In the 2016 film A Quiet Passion about the life of Emily Dickinson, Steve Dan Mills portrays Holland.

In the 2018 film Wild Nights with Emily, Josiah and Elizabeth Holland are portrayed by actor Michael Churven and actress Guinevere Turner, respectively.

The Osage Nation politician Arthur Bonnicastle—named for the titular character in Holland’s 1873 novel—appears as a character in the 2023 film Killers of the Flower Moon.

<text>The Triennial Act 1640 (16 Cha. 1. c. 1), also known as the Dissolution Act, was an Act passed on 15 February 1641, by the English Long Parliament, during the reign of King Charles I. The act required that Parliament meet for at least a fifty-day session once every three years. It was intended to prevent kings from ruling without Parliament, as Charles had done between 1629 and 1640. If the King failed to call Parliament, the Act required the Lord Chancellor to issue the writs, and failing that, the House of Lords could assemble and issue writs for the election of the House of Commons. Clause 11 was unusual because it explicitly stated that this bill would receive the royal assent before the end of the parliamentary session. At that time, bills did not customarily gain royal assent until after the end of the session. Thus, if Clause 11 had not been present, the act might not have come into force until the next parliament.

In 1664, it was repealed by the Triennial Parliaments Act 1664 (16 Cha. 2. c. 1). Though the new Act kept the requirement that a parliament be called at least once in three years, there was no mechanism to enforce this requirement. Thus, Charles II was able to rule for the last four years of his reign without calling a parliament.

Under the Triennial Act 1694, also known as the Meeting of Parliament Act 1694 (6 &amp; 7 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 2), Parliament met annually and held general elections once every three years. The country now remained in a grip of constant election fever (ten elections in twenty years) and loyalties among MPs were difficult to establish, which increased partisanship and rivalry in Parliament. This state of political instability is often known as the &#x27;Rage of Party&#x27;. In 1716, the Septennial Act was passed, under which a parliament could remain in being for up to seven years. This Act ushered in a period of greater stability in British politics, with long-lasting parliaments and governments typical throughout much of the 18th century.

<text>Gerald Alexander Tinker (born January 19, 1951) is an American former track athlete and football player. He won a gold medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay at the 1972 Summer Olympics.

==Early years==
Gerald Tinker attended Coral Gables Senior High School in Coral Gables, Florida, where he excelled as a football and track athlete. In 1967, Tinker, along with quarterback Craig Curry and Bertram Taylor, was part of an all-black backfield at the previously all-white school. The team was rated the team of the century by the FHSAA.

==Sprinting career==
Running for the Kent State Golden Flashes track and field team, Tinker won the 1973 60 yards at the NCAA Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships.

At the 1972 Summer Olympics, Gerald Tinker ran the third leg in the American 4 × 100 metres relay team, which won a gold medal and equalled the United States&#x27; own world record of 38.19. His cousin, Larry Black, also ran a leg in that same relay. Larry Black attended Miami Killian High School where he also was a track star. His school was a football rival of Coral Gables Senior High School that Gerald attended. Despite that, both teamed up to help win Olympic Gold.

==NFL career==
After the Olympics, Tinker was selected by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2nd round (44th overall) of the 1974 NFL draft as wide receiver. He played for the Falcons (1974–1975) and the Green Bay Packers (1975).

<doc id="1079497" wikidata="Q5659344" url="?curid=1079497" title="Philemon Holland">
<text>Philemon Holland (1552 – 9 February 1637) was an English schoolmaster, physician and translator. He is known for the first English translations of several works by Livy, Pliny the Elder, and Plutarch, and also for translating William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; into English.

==Family==
Philemon Holland, born at Chelmsford, Essex, in 1552, was the son of John Holland (died 1578), a member of the same Norfolk family as Sir John Holland, 1st Baronet (1603–1701). The Norfolk branch claimed kinship with the Hollands of Up Holland, Lancashire, but this is questionable. Holland&#x27;s grandfather, Edward Holland, was from Glassthorpe, Northamptonshire. Holland&#x27;s father, John Holland, was one of the Marian exiles with Miles Coverdale during the reign of Mary I, when Catholicism was re-established. After the accession of Elizabeth I in November 1558, he returned to England, and in 1559 was ordained priest by Bishop Edmund Grindal. He was appointed rector of Great Dunmow, Essex, on 26 September 1564, where he died in 1578.

==Career==
Philemon Holland was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford, before going on to Trinity College, Cambridge about 1568, where he was tutored by John Whitgift, later Archbishop of Canterbury. Holland received a BA in 1571, and was elected a minor Fellow at Trinity on 28 September 1573 and a major Fellow on 3 April 1574. His fellowship was terminated automatically when he married in 1579.

After his marriage Holland moved to Coventry, about 25 miles from the home of his wife&#x27;s family at Perry Hall. He became usher (assistant master) at King Henry VIII School, founded in 1545 by John Hales. The position brought him a house and £10 a year.

On 11 July 1585 Holland was incorporated MA at Oxford, and in 1597 was granted the degree of MD at Cambridge.

Holland was admitted to the freedom of the city of Coventry on 30 September 1612, and when King James visited the city on 2 September 1617, he was chosen to make a speech in the King&#x27;s honour. He wore a suit of black satin for the occasion, and his oration is said to have been &quot;much praised&quot;. It was later published as &quot;A learned, elegant and religious Speech delivered unto His...Maiestie, at...Coventry&quot;.

In addition to his school-teaching duties, Holland became by 1613 tutor to George Berkeley (later 8th Baron Berkeley), whose home was nearby at Caludon Castle. On 23 January 1628, when he was 77 years of age, the mayor and aldermen of Coventry appointed Holland head schoolmaster; according to Sharpe, the order of appointment contains an original signature of Holland&#x27;s. It appears the position was given to him at his advanced age out of respect for his talents and service to the city, and in the hope of ameliorating his financial situation. However he retained it for only 14 months, formally requesting to be relieved on 26 November 1628.

On 24 October 1632 the mayor and alderman granted him a pension of £3 6s 8d for the ensuing three years, &quot;forasmuch as Dr. Holland, by reason of his age, is now grown weak and decayed in his estate.&quot;
On 11 April 1635 a licence was granted by Henry Smythe, Vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge to the Masters and Fellows of all colleges at Cambridge to bestow such charitable benevolence on Holland as they should see fit, considering his learning and his financial need. In 1636 he was already bedridden. He died at Coventry on 9 February 1637 and was buried at Holy Trinity Church, where he is remembered in an epitaph of his own composition, lamenting the deaths of the six sons who had predeceased him. Holland&#x27;s wife, Anne, who died in 1627 at the age of 72, is also buried in the church, where there is a Latin epitaph to her composed by her son, Henry.

==Works==
Holland combined his teaching and medical practice with the translation of classical and contemporary works. His first published translation, &quot;The Romane Historie&quot; (1600), was the first complete rendering of Livy&#x27;s Latin history of Rome, &quot;Ab Urbe Condita&quot;, into English. According to John Considine:

It was a work of great importance, presented in a grand folio volume of 1458 pages, and dedicated to the Queen. The translation set out to be lucid and unpretentious, and achieved its aim with marked success. It is accurate, and often lively, and although it does not attempt to imitate the terseness of Latin, it avoids prolixity. As part of his book Holland translated two other substantial works – an ancient epitome of Roman history which provides an outline of the lost books of Livy, and Bartolomeo Marliani&#x27;s guide to the topography of Rome – as well as some smaller texts. These were taken from the edition of Livy published in Paris in 1573; by translating them, Holland was making available in English a great learned compendium of historical knowledge, not simply a single ancient author.

In 1601 Holland published in two folios &quot;an equally huge translation&quot; from Latin, Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;The Historie of the World&quot;, dedicated to Sir Robert Cecil, then the Queen&#x27;s Principal Secretary. This was perhaps the most popular of Holland&#x27;s translations. Considine says of it:

This encyclopaedia of ancient knowledge about the natural world had already had a great indirect influence in England, as elsewhere in Europe, but had not been translated into English before, and would not be again for 250 years. Indeed, after four centuries, Holland is still the only translator of this work to attempt to evoke its literary richness and beauty.

In 1603 Holland published &quot;The Philosophie, commonly called, the Morals&quot;, dedicating it to King James. This was the first English translation of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Moralia&quot;. Holland followed the Greek of Plutarch&#x27;s original, and made use as well of a Latin translation and of the French translation of 1572 by Jacques Amyot. Holland is said to have claimed that he wrote out the whole of his translation of the &quot;Moralia&quot; with a single quill, which was later preserved by Lady Harington:

This Booke I wrote with one poore Pen, made of a grey Goose quill&lt;br&gt;
A Pen I found it, us&#x27;d before, a Pen I leave it still.

Summing up this early period of extraordinary productivity, Considine points out, &quot;In all, over the four years 1600–1603, Holland published 4332 folio pages of translations of the very highest quality.&quot; Three years later came &quot;The Historie of Twelve Caesars&quot; (1606), his translation of Suetonius&#x27;s &quot;De Vita Caesarum&quot;, dedicated to Lady Anne Harington (c. 1554–1620), daughter of Robert Keilway, Surveyor of the Court of Wards and Liveries, and wife of John Harington, 1st Baron Harington of Exton.

In 1609 he published his translation of the surviving books of Ammianus Marcellinus&#x27;s history of the Roman Empire in the later 4th century AD, dedicating it to the mayor and aldermen of Coventry. The Corporation paid £4 towards the publication.

In 1610 Holland translated the 1607 edition of William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot; into English. Although he appears to have been solely responsible for the translation, the work was expanded with a certain amount of new material supplied by Camden. One of the printer-publishers of the volume was John Norton, to whom Holland&#x27;s son, Henry, had been apprenticed, and it was probably Henry who recruited his father to the project. Philemon in turn found a patron in Elizabeth, Lady Berkeley, whose son, George, he would later tutor: she appears to have offered £20 towards the publication, and considered doubling this to £40. However, when the first printed pages were circulated, it was reported that Camden &quot;misliketh it &amp; thinketh he [i. e. Holland] hath don him wrong&quot;, and Lady Berkeley may have reconsidered her support: her patronage is not mentioned in the published volume. At the last minute, Coventry Corporation contributed £5 towards the publication. A second edition, entered in the Stationers&#x27; Register in 1625, was not published until 1637.

In 1615 Holland published &quot;Thomae Thomasii Dictionarium&quot;, a supplement to the Latin dictionary published in 1587 by the Cambridge printer, Thomas Thomas (1553–1588), adding to Thomas&#x27;s original some 6000 words and meanings culled from the works of both ancient and modern Latin authors. In the following year he published &quot;Theatrum Imperii Magnae Britanniae&quot;, a translation from English into Latin of Speed&#x27;s &quot;The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine&quot;.

In 1617 he translated the &quot;Regimen Sanitatis Salerni&quot;, publishing it together with Thomas Paynell&#x27;s earlier translation of Arnaldus de Villa Nova&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Regimen&quot;.

Holland also translated Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;, completing a first draft in 1621, and continuing to work on it for the ensuing decade. It was published in 1632, prefaced by his portrait and a dedication to Charles I by Holland&#x27;s son, the printer Henry Holland. The volume included a reprint of a poem on the Battle of Lepanto by another son, the poet Abraham Holland, and a description by Henry Holland of his father&#x27;s signet ring.

==Translation style==
Holland&#x27;s translation style was free and colloquial, sometimes employing relatively obscure dialect and archaic vocabulary, and often expanding on his source text in the interests of clarity. He justified this approach in prefaces to his translations of Livy and Pliny, saying that he had opted for &quot;a meane and popular stile&quot;, and for &quot;that Dialect or Idiome which [is] familiar to the basest clowne&quot;, while elaborating on the original in order to avoid being &quot;obscure and darke&quot;. When fragments of poetry were cited in the works Holland translated, he usually versified them into couplets.

==Reputation==
Holland was well regarded in his lifetime, both for the quantity and quality of his translations. A piece of doggerel, composed after the publication of Suetonius&#x27;s &quot;Historie&quot; in 1606 (and playing on Suetonius&#x27;s cognomen), ran:

Phil: Holland with translations doth so fill us,&lt;br&gt;
He will not let Suetonius be Tranquillus

Thomas Fuller, writing in the mid-17th century, included Holland among his &quot;Worthies of England&quot;, terming him &quot;the translator general in his age, so that those books alone of his turning into English will make a country gentleman a competent library for historians.&quot;

However, his colloquial language soon dated. John Aubrey, reading his translations of Livy and Pliny as an undergraduate in the 1640s, compiled lists of examples of what he saw as quaint and archaic terms. Edmund Bohun published a new translation of Livy in 1686, criticising Holland&#x27;s version by saying that &quot;our English Language is much refined within the last four score years&quot;, and in 1692–1693, Holland&#x27;s edition of &quot;Britannia&quot; was described as &quot;a very bad one, and the Translation very ill&quot;. Twentieth-century critics were more generous. It has been suggested that &quot;Holland&#x27;s Pliny is sometimes superior, despite the antiquated language he uses, to the 20th-century English translations commonly available&quot;, and that there are passages in his translation of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Moralia&quot; which &quot;have hardly been excelled by any later prose translator of the classics.&quot;

==Marriage and issue==
On 10 February 1579 Holland married Anne Bott (1555–1627), the daughter of William Bott (&quot;alias&quot; Peyton) of Perry Hall, Handsworth, Staffordshire, by whom he had seven sons and three daughters, including the poet Abraham Holland, the publisher and miscellanist Henry Holland, the print publisher Compton Holland (died 1622), the surgeon William Holland (1592–1632), whose treatise on gout, &quot;Gutta Podagrica&quot;, was published posthumously in 1633, and Elizabeth Holland, who married a London merchant, William Angell.

<doc id="1079500" wikidata="Q451207" url="?curid=1079500" title="Java syntax">
<text>The syntax of Java is the set of rules defining how a Java program is written and interpreted.

The syntax is mostly derived from C and C++. Unlike C++, Java has no global functions or variables, but has data members which are also regarded as global variables. All code belongs to classes and all values are objects. The only exception is the primitive data types, which are not considered to be objects for performance reasons (though can be automatically converted to objects and vice versa via autoboxing). Some features like operator overloading or unsigned integer data types are omitted to simplify the language and avoid possible programming mistakes.

The Java syntax has been gradually extended in the course of numerous major JDK releases, and now supports abilities such as generic programming and anonymous functions (function literals, called lambda expressions in Java). Since 2017, a new JDK version is released twice a year, with each release improving the language incrementally.

==Basics==

===Identifier===
An identifier is the name of an element in the code. There are certain standard naming conventions to follow when selecting names for elements. Identifiers in Java are case-sensitive.

An identifier can contain:
* Any Unicode character that is a letter (including numeric letters like Roman numerals) or digit.
* Currency sign (such as ¥).
* Connecting punctuation character (such as _).

An identifier cannot:
* Start with a digit.
* Be equal to a reserved keyword, null literal or Boolean literal.

===Keywords===

===Literals===

Integer literals are of codice_1 type by default unless codice_2 type is specified by appending codice_3 or codice_4 suffix to the literal, e.g. codice_5. Since Java SE 7, it is possible to include underscores between the digits of a number to increase readability; for example, a number can be written as .

===Variables===
Variables are identifiers associated with values. They are declared by writing the variable&#x27;s type and name, and are optionally initialized in the same statement by assigning a value.
int count; //Declaring an uninitialized variable called &#x27;count&#x27;, of type &#x27;int&#x27;
count = 35; //Initializing the variable
int count = 35; //Declaring and initializing the variable at the same time
Multiple variables of the same type can be declared and initialized in one statement using comma as a delimiter.

int a, b; //Declaring multiple variables of the same type
int a = 2, b = 3; //Declaring and initializing multiple variables of the same type
====Type inference====

Since Java 10, it has become possible to infer types for the variables automatically by using codice_6.
// stream will have the FileOutputStream type as inferred from its initializer
var stream = new FileOutputStream(&quot;file.txt&quot;);

// An equivalent declaration with an explicit type
FileOutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream(&quot;file.txt&quot;);
===Code blocks===

The separators and signify a code block and a new scope. Class members and the body of a method are examples of what can live inside these braces in various contexts.

Inside of method bodies, braces may be used to create new scopes, as follows:
void doSomething() {
 int a;
 int b;
 a = 1;

 a = 2;
 b = 3; // Illegal because the variable b is declared in an inner scope..


===Comments===
Java has three kinds of comments: &quot;traditional comments&quot;, &quot;end-of-line comments&quot; and &quot;documentation comments&quot;.

Traditional comments, also known as block comments, start with codice_7 and end with codice_8, they may span across multiple lines. This type of comment was derived from C and C++.
/* This is a multi-line comment.
It may occupy more than one line. */
End-of-line comments start with codice_9 and extend to the end of the current line. This comment type is also present in C++ and in modern C.

// This is an end-of-line comment
Documentation comments in the source files are processed by the Javadoc tool to generate documentation. This type of comment is identical to traditional comments, except it starts with codice_10 and follows conventions defined by the Javadoc tool. Technically, these comments are a special kind of traditional comment and they are not specifically defined in the language specification.
 * This is a documentation comment.
 * @author John Doe


===Universal types===

Classes in the package java.lang are implicitly imported into every program, as long as no explicitly-imported types have the same names. Important ones include:

====java.lang.Object====
 is Java&#x27;s top type. Superclass of all classes that do not declare a parent class. All values can be converted to this type, although for primitive values this involves autoboxing.

====java.lang.String====
 is Java&#x27;s basic string type. Immutable. Some methods treat each UTF-16 code unit as a &quot;character&quot;, but methods to convert to an codice_11 that is effectively UTF-32 are also available.

====java.lang.Throwable====
 is supertype of everything that can be thrown or caught with Java&#x27;s codice_12 and codice_13 statements.

==Program structure==
Java applications consist of collections of classes. Classes exist in packages but can also be nested inside other classes.

===codice_14 method===
Every Java application must have an entry point. This is true of both graphical interface applications and console applications. The entry point is the codice_14 method. There can be more than one class with a codice_14 method, but the main class is always defined externally (for example, in a manifest file). The codice_14 method along with the main class must be declared codice_18. The method must be codice_19 and is passed command-line arguments as an array of strings. Unlike C++ or C#, it never returns a value and must return codice_20.

public static void main(String[] args) {


===Packages===
Packages are a part of a class name and they are used to group and/or distinguish named entities from other ones. Another purpose of packages is to govern code access together with access modifiers. For example, codice_21 is a fully qualified class name for the class codice_22 which is located in the package codice_23.

A package is declared at the start of the file with the codice_24 declaration:
package myapplication.mylibrary;

public class MyClass {


Classes with the codice_18 modifier must be placed in the files with the same name and extension and put into nested folders corresponding to the package name. The above class codice_26 will have the following path: codice_27.

===Import declaration===

====Type import declaration====

A type import declaration allows a named type to be referred to by a simple name rather than the full name that includes the package. Import declarations can be &quot;single type import declarations&quot; or &quot;import-on-demand declarations&quot;. Import declarations must be placed at the top of a code file after the package declaration.
package myPackage;

import java.util.Random; // Single type declaration

public class ImportsTest {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 /* The following line is equivalent to
 * java.util.Random random = new java.util.Random();
 * It would&#x27;ve been incorrect without the import.
 Random random = new Random();
}
Import-on-demand declarations are mentioned in the code. A &quot;type import&quot; imports all the types of the package. A &quot;static import&quot; imports members of the package.
import java.util.*; /*This form of importing classes makes all classes
 in package java.util available by name, could be used instead of the
 import declaration in the previous example. */
import java.*; /*This statement is legal, but does nothing, since there
 are no classes directly in package java. All of them are in packages
 within package java. This does not import all available classes.*/
====Static import declaration====
This type of declaration has been available since J2SE 5.0. Static import declarations allow access to static members defined in another class, interface, annotation, or enum; without specifying the class name:
import static java.lang.System.out; //&#x27;out&#x27; is a static field in java.lang.System

public class HelloWorld {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 /* The following line is equivalent to
 System.out.println(&quot;Hi World!&quot;);
 and would have been incorrect without the import declaration. */
 out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
}
Import-on-demand declarations allow to import all the fields of the type:
import static java.lang.System.*;
 /* This form of declaration makes all
 fields in the java.lang.System class available by name, and may be used instead
 of the import declaration in the previous example. */
Enum constants may also be used with static import. For example, this enum is in the package called codice_28:
public enum ColorName {
 RED, BLUE, GREEN


It is possible to use static import declarations in another class to retrieve the enum constants:
import screen.ColorName;
import static screen.ColorName.*;

public class Dots {
 /* The following line is equivalent to &#x27;ColorName foo = ColorName.RED&#x27;,
 and it would have been incorrect without the static import. */
 ColorName foo = RED;

 void shift() {
 /* The following line is equivalent to
 if (foo == ColorName.RED) foo = ColorName.BLUE; */
 if (foo == RED) foo = BLUE;
}
==Operators==
Operators in Java are similar to those in C++. However, there is no codice_29 operator due to garbage collection mechanisms in Java, and there are no operations on pointers since Java does not support them. Another difference is that Java has an unsigned right shift operator (codice_30), while C&#x27;s right shift operator&#x27;s signedness is type-dependent. Operators in Java cannot be overloaded.

==Control structures==

===Conditional statements===

====codice_31 statement====
if statements in Java are similar to those in C and use the same syntax:

if (i == 3) {
 doSomething();


codice_31 statement may include optional codice_33 block, in which case it becomes an if-then-else statement:

if (i == 3) {
 doSomething();
} else {
 doSomethingElse();


Like C, else-if construction does not involve any special keywords, it is formed as a sequence of separate if-then-else statements:

if (i == 3) {
 doSomething();
} else if (i == 2) {
 doSomethingElse();
} else {
 doSomethingDifferent();


Also, a ?: operator can be used in place of simple if statement, for example

int a = 1;
int b = 2;
int minVal = (a &lt; b) ? a : b;
====codice_34 statement====
Switch statements in Java can use codice_35, codice_36, codice_37, and codice_1 (not codice_2) primitive data types or their corresponding wrapper types. Starting with J2SE 5.0, it is possible to use enum types. Starting with Java SE 7, it is possible to use Strings. Other reference types cannot be used in codice_34 statements.

Possible values are listed using codice_41 labels. These labels in Java may contain only constants (including enum constants and string constants). Execution will start after the label corresponding to the expression inside the brackets. An optional codice_42 label may be present to declare that the code following it will be executed if none of the case labels correspond to the expression.

Code for each label ends with the codice_43 keyword. It is possible to omit it causing the execution to proceed to the next label, however, a warning will usually be reported during compilation.
switch (ch) {
 case &#x27;A&#x27;:
 doSomething(); // Triggered if ch == &#x27;A&#x27;
 break;
 case &#x27;B&#x27;:
 case &#x27;C&#x27;:
 doSomethingElse(); // Triggered if ch == &#x27;B&#x27; or ch == &#x27;C&#x27;
 break;
 default:
 doSomethingDifferent(); // Triggered in any other case
 break;


=====codice_34 expressions=====

Since Java 14 it has become possible to use switch expressions, which use the new arrow syntax:
var result = switch (ch) {
 case &#x27;A&#x27; -&gt; Result.GREAT;
 case &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27; -&gt; Result.FINE;
 default -&gt; throw new ThisIsNoGoodException();


Alternatively, there is a possibility to express the same with the codice_45 statement, although it is recommended to prefer the arrow syntax because it avoids the problem of accidental fall throughs.
var result = switch (ch) {
 case &#x27;A&#x27;:
 yield Result.GREAT;
 case &#x27;B&#x27;:
 case &#x27;C&#x27;:
 yield Result.FINE;
 default:
 throw new ThisIsNoGoodException();


===Iteration statements===
Iteration statements are statements that are repeatedly executed when a given condition is evaluated as true. Since J2SE 5.0, Java has four forms of such statements. The condition must have type boolean or Boolean, meaning C&#x27;s
while (1) {
 doSomething();
results in a compilation error.

====codice_46 loop====
In the codice_46 loop, the test is done before each iteration.
while (i &lt; 10) {
 doSomething();


====codice_48 loop====
In the codice_48 loop, the test is done after each iteration. Consequently, the code is always executed at least once.
// doSomething() is called at least once
do {
 doSomething();
} while (i &lt; 10);
====codice_50 loop====
codice_50 loops in Java include an initializer, a condition and a counter expression. It is possible to include several expressions of the same kind using comma as delimiter (except in the condition). However, unlike C, the comma is just a delimiter and not an operator.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
 doSomething();
 
// A more complex loop using two variables
for (int i = 0, j = 9; i &lt; 10; i++, j -= 3) {
 doSomething();


Like C, all three expressions are optional. The following loop is infinite:

for (;;) {
 doSomething();


====Enhanced codice_50 loop====

Enhanced codice_50 loops have been available since J2SE 5.0. This type of loop uses built-in iterators over arrays and collections to return each item in the given collection. Every element is returned and reachable in the context of the code block. When the block is executed, the next item is returned until there are no items remaining. Unlike C#, this kind of loop does not involve a special keyword, but instead uses a different notation style.
for (int i : intArray) {
 doSomething(i);


===Jump statements===

====Labels====
Labels are given points in code used by codice_43 and codice_55 statements. The Java codice_56 keyword cannot be used to jump to specific points in code.
start:
someMethod();
====codice_43 statement====
The codice_43 statement breaks out of the closest loop or codice_34 statement. Execution continues in the statement after the terminated statement, if any.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
 while (true) {
 break;
 // Will break to this point


It is possible to break out of the outer loop using labels:
outer:
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
 while (true) {
 break outer;
}
// Will break to this point
====codice_55 statement====
The codice_55 statement discontinues the current iteration of the current control statement and begins the next iteration. The following codice_46 loop in the code below reads characters by calling codice_63, skipping the statements in the body of the loop if the characters are spaces:
int ch;
while (ch == getChar()) {
 if (ch == &#x27; &#x27;) {
 continue; // Skips the rest of the while-loop

 // Rest of the while-loop, will not be reached if ch == &#x27; &#x27;
 doSomething();


Labels can be specified in codice_55 statements and codice_43 statements:
outer:
for (String str : stringsArr) {
 char[] strChars = str.toCharArray();
 for (char ch : strChars) {
 if (ch == &#x27; &#x27;) {
 /* Continues the outer cycle and the next
 string is retrieved from stringsArr */
 continue outer;
 doSomething(ch);
}
====codice_66 statement====
The codice_66 statement is used to end method execution and to return a value. A value returned by the method is written after the codice_66 keyword. If the method returns anything but codice_20, it must use the codice_66 statement to return some value.
void doSomething(boolean streamClosed) {
 // If streamClosed is true, execution is stopped
 if (streamClosed) {
 return;
 readFromStream();

int calculateSum(int a, int b) {
 int result = a + b;
 return result;


codice_66 statement ends execution immediately, except for one case: if the statement is encountered within a codice_72 block and it is complemented by a codice_73, control is passed to the codice_73 block.
void doSomething(boolean streamClosed) {
 try {
 if (streamClosed) {
 return;
 readFromStream();
 } finally {
 /* Will be called last even if 
 readFromStream() was not called */
 freeResources();
}
===Exception handling statements===

====codice_75 statements====
Exceptions are managed within codice_72 ... codice_13 blocks.
try {
 // Statements that may throw exceptions
 methodThrowingExceptions();
} catch (Exception ex) {
 // Exception caught and handled here
 reportException(ex);
} finally {
 // Statements always executed after the try/catch blocks
 freeResources();


The statements within the codice_72 block are executed, and if any of them throws an exception, execution of the block is discontinued and the exception is handled by the codice_13 block. There may be multiple codice_13 blocks, in which case the first block with an exception variable whose type matches the type of the thrown exception is executed.

Java SE 7 also introduced multi-catch clauses besides uni-catch clauses. This type of catch clauses allows Java to handle different types of exceptions in a single block provided they are not subclasses of each other.
try {
 methodThrowingExceptions();
} catch (IOException | IllegalArgumentException ex) {
 //Both IOException and IllegalArgumentException will be caught and handled here
 reportException(ex);


If no codice_13 block matches the type of the thrown exception, the execution of the outer block (or method) containing the codice_72 ... codice_13 statement is discontinued, and the exception is passed up and outside the containing block (or method). The exception is propagated upwards through the call stack until a matching codice_13 block is found within one of the currently active methods. If the exception propagates all the way up to the top-most codice_14 method without a matching codice_13 block being found, a textual description of the exception is written to the standard output stream.

The statements within the codice_73 block are always executed after the codice_72 and codice_13 blocks, whether or not an exception was thrown and even if a codice_66 statement was reached. Such blocks are useful for providing clean-up code that is guaranteed to always be executed.

The codice_13 and codice_73 blocks are optional, but at least one or the other must be present following the codice_72 block.

====codice_72-with-resources statements====

codice_72-with-resources statements are a special type of codice_75 statements introduced as an implementation of the dispose pattern in Java SE 7. In a codice_72-with-resources statement the codice_72 keyword is followed by initialization of one or more resources that are released automatically when the codice_72 block execution is finished. Resources must implement codice_100. codice_72-with-resources statements are not required to have a codice_13 or codice_73 block unlike normal codice_75 statements.
try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(&quot;filename&quot;);
 XMLEncoder xEnc = new XMLEncoder(fos)) {
 xEnc.writeObject(object);
} catch (IOException ex) {
 Logger.getLogger(Serializer.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);


Since Java 9 it is possible to use already declared variables:
FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(&quot;filename&quot;);
XMLEncoder xEnc = new XMLEncoder(fos);
try (fos; xEnc) {
 xEnc.writeObject(object);
} catch (IOException ex) {
 Logger.getLogger(Serializer.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);


====codice_12 statement====
The codice_12 statement is used to throw an exception and end the execution of the block or method. The thrown exception instance is written after the codice_12 statement.
void methodThrowingExceptions(Object obj) {
 if (obj == null) {
 // Throws exception of NullPointerException type
 throw new NullPointerException();
 // Will not be called, if object is null
 doSomethingWithObject(obj);


===Thread concurrency control===
Java has built-in tools for multi-thread programming. For the purposes of thread synchronization the codice_108 statement is included in Java language.

To make a code block synchronized, it is preceded by the codice_108 keyword followed by the lock object inside the brackets. When the executing thread reaches the synchronized block, it acquires a mutual exclusion lock, executes the block, then releases the lock. No threads may enter this block until the lock is released. Any non-null reference type may be used as the lock.
/* Acquires lock on someObject. It must be of
a reference type and must be non-null */
synchronized (someObject) {
 // Synchronized statements


===codice_110 statement===
codice_110 statements have been available since J2SE 1.4. These types of statements are used to make assertions in the source code, which can be turned on and off during execution for specific classes or packages. To declare an assertion the codice_110 keyword is used followed by a conditional expression. If it evaluates to codice_113 when the statement is executed, an exception is thrown. This statement can include a colon followed by another expression, which will act as the exception&#x27;s detail message.
// If n equals 0, AssertionError is thrown
assert n != 0;
/* If n equals 0, AssertionError will be thrown
with the message after the colon */
assert n != 0 : &quot;n was equal to zero&quot;;
==Primitive types==
Primitive types in Java include integer types, floating-point numbers, UTF-16 code units and a Boolean type. There are no unsigned types in Java except codice_37 type, which is used to represent UTF-16 code units. The lack of unsigned types is offset by introducing unsigned right shift operation (codice_30), which is not present in C++. Nevertheless, criticisms have been leveled about the lack of compatibility with C and C++ this causes. 

codice_37 does not necessarily correspond to a single character. It may represent a part of a surrogate pair, in which case Unicode code point is represented by a sequence of two codice_37 values.

===Boxing and unboxing===
This language feature was introduced in J2SE 5.0. &quot;Boxing&quot; is the operation of converting a value of a primitive type into a value of a corresponding reference type, which serves as a wrapper for this particular primitive type. &quot;Unboxing&quot; is the reverse operation of converting a value of a reference type (previously boxed) into a value of a corresponding primitive type. Neither operation requires an explicit conversion.

Example:

int foo = 42; // Primitive type
Integer bar = foo; /* foo is boxed to bar, bar is of Integer type,
 which serves as a wrapper for int */
int foo2 = bar; // Unboxed back to primitive type
==Reference types==
Reference types include class types, interface types, and array types. When the constructor is called, an object is created on the heap and a reference is assigned to the variable. When a variable of an object gets out of scope, the reference is broken and when there are no references left, the object gets marked as garbage. The garbage collector then collects and destroys it some time afterwards.

A reference variable is codice_118 when it does not reference any object.

===Arrays===
Arrays in Java are created at runtime, just like class instances. Array length is defined at creation and cannot be changed.
int[] numbers = new int[5];
numbers[0] = 2;
numbers[1] = 5;
int x = numbers[0];
====Initializers====
// Long syntax
int[] numbers = new int[] {20, 1, 42, 15, 34};
// Short syntax
int[] numbers2 = {20, 1, 42, 15, 34};
====Multi-dimensional arrays====
In Java, multi-dimensional arrays are represented as arrays of arrays. Technically, they are represented by arrays of references to other arrays.
int[][] numbers = new int[3][3];
numbers[1][2] = 2;

int[][] numbers2 = ;
Due to the nature of the multi-dimensional arrays, sub-arrays can vary in length, so multi-dimensional arrays are not bound to be rectangular unlike C:

int[][] numbers = new int[2][]; //Initialization of the first dimension only

numbers[0] = new int[3];
numbers[1] = new int[2];
===Classes===
Classes are fundamentals of an object-oriented language such as Java. They contain members that store and manipulate data. Classes are divided into &quot;top-level&quot; and &quot;nested&quot;. Nested classes are classes placed inside another class that may access the private members of the enclosing class. Nested classes include &quot;member classes&quot; (which may be defined with the &quot;static&quot; modifier for simple nesting or without it for inner classes), &quot;local classes&quot; and &quot;anonymous classes&quot;.

====Declaration====
====Instantiation====
Non-static members of a class define the types of the instance variables and methods, which are related to the objects created from that class. To create these objects, the class must be instantiated by using the codice_119 operator and calling the class constructor.
Foo foo = new Foo();
====Accessing members====
Members of both instances and static classes are accessed with the codice_120 (dot) operator.

Accessing an instance member
Instance members can be accessed through the name of a variable.
String foo = &quot;Hello&quot;;
String bar = foo.toUpperCase();
Accessing a static class member
Static members are accessed by using the name of the class or any other type. This does not require the creation of a class instance. Static members are declared using the codice_19 modifier.
public class Foo {
 public static void doSomething() {
}

// Calling the static method
Foo.doSomething();
====Modifiers====
Modifiers are keywords used to modify declarations of types and type members. Most notably there is a sub-group containing the access modifiers.

* codice_122 - Specifies that a class only serves as a base class and cannot be instantiated.
* codice_19 - Used only for member classes, specifies that the member class does not belong to a specific instance of the containing class.
* codice_124 - Classes marked as codice_124 cannot be extended from and cannot have any subclasses.
* codice_126 - Specifies that all floating-point operations must be carried out conforming to IEEE 754 and forbids using enhanced precision to store intermediate results.

=====Abstract class=====
=====Final class=====
=====Access modifiers=====
The &quot;access modifiers&quot;, or &quot;inheritance modifiers&quot;, set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members. Members marked as codice_18 can be reached from anywhere. If a class or its member does not have any modifiers, default access is assumed.
public class Foo {
 int go() {
 return 0;

 private class Bar {
}
The following table shows whether code within a class has access to the class or method depending on the accessing class location and the modifier for the accessed class or class member:

====Constructors and initializers====
A constructor is a special method called when an object is initialized. Its purpose is to initialize the members of the object. The main differences between constructors and ordinary methods are that constructors are called only when an instance of the class is created and never return anything. Constructors are declared as common methods, but they are named after the class and no return type is specified:
class Foo {
 String str;

 Foo() { // Constructor with no arguments

 // Initialization

 Foo(String str) { // Constructor with one argument
 this.str = str;
}
Initializers are blocks of code that are executed when a class or an instance of a class is created. There are two kinds of initializers, &quot;static initializers&quot; and &quot;instance initializers&quot;.

Static initializers initialize static fields when the class is created. They are declared using the codice_19 keyword:
class Foo {
 static {
 // Initialization
}
A class is created only once. Therefore, static initializers are not called more than once. On the contrary, instance initializers are automatically called before the call to a constructor every time an instance of the class is created. Unlike constructors instance initializers cannot take any arguments and generally they cannot throw any checked exceptions (except in several special cases). Instance initializers are declared in a block without any keywords:
class Foo {
 // Initialization
}
Since Java has a garbage collection mechanism, there are no destructors. However, every object has a codice_129 method called prior to garbage collection, which can be overridden to implement finalization.

====Methods====
All the statements in Java must reside within methods. Methods are similar to functions except they belong to classes. A method has a return value, a name and usually some parameters initialized when it is called with some arguments. Similar to C++, methods returning nothing have return type declared as codice_20. Unlike in C++, methods in Java are not allowed to have default argument values and methods are usually overloaded instead.
class Foo {
 int bar(int a, int b) {
 return (a*2) + b;

 /* Overloaded method with the same name but different set of arguments */
 int bar(int a) {
 return a*2;
}
A method is called using codice_120 notation on an object, or in the case of a static method, also on the name of a class.
Foo foo = new Foo();
int result = foo.bar(7, 2); // Non-static method is called on foo

int finalResult = Math.abs(result); // Static method call
The codice_132 keyword indicates that a method throws an exception. All checked exceptions must be listed in a comma-separated list.

void openStream() throws IOException, myException { // Indicates that IOException may be thrown


=====Modifiers=====
* codice_122 - Abstract methods can be present only in abstract classes, such methods have no body and must be overridden in a subclass unless it is abstract itself.
* codice_19 - Makes the method static and accessible without creation of a class instance. However static methods cannot access non-static members in the same class.
* codice_124 - Declares that the method cannot be overridden in a subclass.
* codice_136 - Indicates that this method is implemented through JNI in platform-dependent code. Actual implementation happens outside Java code, and such methods have no body.
* codice_126 - Declares strict conformance to IEEE 754 in carrying out floating-point operations.
* codice_108 - Declares that a thread executing this method must acquire monitor. For codice_108 methods the monitor is the class instance or codice_140 if the method is static.
* Access modifiers - Identical to those used with classes.

======Final methods======
=====Varargs=====
This language feature was introduced in J2SE 5.0. The last argument of the method may be declared as a variable arity parameter, in which case the method becomes a variable arity method (as opposed to fixed arity methods) or simply varargs method. This allows one to pass a variable number of values, of the declared type, to the method as parameters - including no parameters. These values will be available inside the method as an array.
void printReport(String header, int... numbers) { //numbers represents varargs
 System.out.println(header);
 for (int num : numbers) {
 System.out.println(num);
}

// Calling varargs method
printReport(&quot;Report data&quot;, 74, 83, 25, 96);
====Fields====
Fields, or class variables, can be declared inside the class body to store data.
class Foo {
 double bar;


Fields can be initialized directly when declared.
class Foo {
 double bar = 2.3;


=====Modifiers=====
* codice_19 - Makes the field a static member.
* codice_124 - Allows the field to be initialized only once in a constructor or inside initialization block or during its declaration, whichever is earlier.
* codice_143 - Indicates that this field will not be stored during serialization.
* codice_144 - If a field is declared codice_144, it is ensured that all threads see a consistent value for the variable.

====Inheritance====
Classes in Java can only inherit from &quot;one&quot; class. A class can be derived from any class that is not marked as codice_124. Inheritance is declared using the codice_147 keyword. A class can reference itself using the codice_148 keyword and its direct superclass using the codice_149 keyword.
class Foo {

class Foobar extends Foo {


If a class does not specify its superclass, it implicitly inherits from codice_150 class. Thus all classes in Java are subclasses of codice_151 class.

If the superclass does not have a constructor without parameters the subclass must specify in its constructors what constructor of the superclass to use. For example:
class Foo {
 public Foo(int n) {
 // Do something with n
}

class Foobar extends Foo {
 private int number;
 // Superclass does not have constructor without parameters
 // so we have to specify what constructor of our superclass to use and how

 public Foobar(int number) {
 super(number);
 this.number = number;
}
=====Overriding methods=====
Unlike C++, all non-codice_124 methods in Java are virtual and can be overridden by the inheriting classes.
class Operation {
 public int doSomething() {
 return 0;
}

class NewOperation extends Operation {
 @Override
 public int doSomething() {
 return 1;
}
=====Abstract classes=====

An Abstract Class is a class that is incomplete, or is to be considered incomplete, so cannot be instantiated.

A class C has abstract methods if any of the following is true:

* C explicitly contains a declaration of an abstract method.
* Any of C&#x27;s superclasses has an abstract method and C neither declares nor inherits a method that implements it.
* A direct superinterface of C declares or inherits a method (which is therefore necessarily abstract) and C neither declares nor inherits a method that implements it.
* A subclass of an abstract class that is not itself abstract may be instantiated, resulting in the execution of a constructor for the abstract class and, therefore, the execution of the field initializers for instance variables of that class.
package org.dwwwp.test;
 * @author jcrypto
public class AbstractClass {
 private static final String hello;

 static {
 System.out.println(AbstractClass.class.getName() + &quot;: static block runtime&quot;);

 System.out.println(AbstractClass.class.getName() + &quot;: instance block runtime&quot;);

 public CustomClass() {
 System.out.println(CustomClass.class.getName() + &quot;: constructor runtime&quot;);

 public static void main(String[] args) {
 CustomClass nc = new CustomClass();
 hello();
 //AbstractClass.hello();//also valid
}
Output:

org.dwwwp.test.AbstractClass: static block runtime
org.dwwwp.test.CustomClass: static block runtime
org.dwwwp.test.AbstractClass: instance block runtime
org.dwwwp.test.AbstractClass: constructor runtime
org.dwwwp.test.CustomClass: instance block runtime
org.dwwwp.test.CustomClass: constructor runtime
hello from org.dwwwp.test.AbstractClass
====Enumerations====
This language feature was introduced in J2SE 5.0. Technically enumerations are a kind of class containing enum constants in its body. Each enum constant defines an instance of the enum type. Enumeration classes cannot be instantiated anywhere except in the enumeration class itself.
enum Season {
 WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, AUTUMN


Enum constants are allowed to have constructors, which are called when the class is loaded:
public enum Season {
 WINTER(&quot;Cold&quot;), SPRING(&quot;Warmer&quot;), SUMMER(&quot;Hot&quot;), AUTUMN(&quot;Cooler&quot;);

 Season(String description) {
 this.description = description;

 private final String description;

 public String getDescription() {
 return description;
}
Enumerations can have class bodies, in which case they are treated like anonymous classes extending the enum class:
public enum Season {
 WINTER {
 String getDescription() {return &quot;cold&quot;;}
 SPRING {
 String getDescription() {return &quot;warmer&quot;;}
 SUMMER {
 String getDescription() {return &quot;hot&quot;;}
 FALL {
 String getDescription() {return &quot;cooler&quot;;}
}
===Interfaces===
Interfaces are types which contain no fields and usually define a number of methods without an actual implementation. They are useful to define a contract with any number of different implementations. Every interface is implicitly abstract. Interface methods are allowed to have a subset of access modifiers depending on the language version, codice_126, which has the same effect as for classes, and also codice_19 since Java SE 8.
interface ActionListener {
 int ACTION_ADD = 0;
 int ACTION_REMOVE = 1;
 void actionSelected(int action);


====Implementing an interface====
An interface is implemented by a class using the codice_155 keyword. It is allowed to implement more than one interface, in which case they are written after codice_155 keyword in a comma-separated list. A class implementing an interface must override all its methods, otherwise it must be declared as abstract.
interface RequestListener {
 int requestReceived();

class ActionHandler implements ActionListener, RequestListener {
 public void actionSelected(int action) {

 public int requestReceived() {
}

//Calling method defined by interface
RequestListener listener = new ActionHandler(); /*ActionHandler can be
 represented as RequestListener...*/
listener.requestReceived(); /*...and thus is known to implement
 requestReceived() method*/
====Functional interfaces and lambda expressions====

These features were introduced with the release of Java SE 8. An interface automatically becomes a functional interface if it defines only one method. In this case an implementation can be represented as a lambda expression instead of implementing it in a new class, thus greatly simplifying writing code in the functional style. Functional interfaces can optionally be annotated with the codice_157 annotation, which will tell the compiler to check whether the interface actually conforms to a definition of a functional interface.
// A functional interface
@FunctionalInterface
interface Calculation {
 int calculate(int someNumber, int someOtherNumber);

// A method which accepts this interface as a parameter
int runCalculation(Calculation calculation) {
 return calculation.calculate(1, 2);

// Using a lambda to call the method
runCalculation((number, otherNumber) -&gt; number + otherNumber);

// Equivalent code which uses an anonymous class instead
runCalculation(new Calculation() {
 @Override
 public int calculate(int someNumber, int someOtherNumber) {
 return someNumber + someOtherNumber;
})
Lambda&#x27;s parameters types don&#x27;t have to be fully specified and can be inferred from the interface it implements. Lambda&#x27;s body can be written without a body block and a codice_66 statement if it is only an expression. Also, for those interfaces which only have a single parameter in the method, round brackets can be omitted.
// Same call as above, but with fully specified types and a body block
runCalculation((int number, int otherNumber) -&gt; {
 return number + otherNumber;

// A functional interface with a method which has only a single parameter
interface StringExtender {
 String extendString(String input);

// Initializing a variable of this type by using a lambda
StringExtender extender = input -&gt; input + &quot; Extended&quot;;
====Method references====

It is not necessary to use lambdas when there already is a named method compatible with the interface. This method can be passed instead of a lambda using a method reference. There are several types of method references:

The code above which calls codice_159 could be replaced with the following using the method references:
runCalculation(Integer::sum);
====Inheritance====

Interfaces can inherit from other interfaces just like classes. Unlike classes it is allowed to inherit from multiple interfaces. However, it is possible that several interfaces have a field with the same name, in which case it becomes a single ambiguous member, which cannot be accessed.
/* Class implementing this interface must implement methods of both
ActionListener and RequestListener */
interface EventListener extends ActionListener, RequestListener { 


====Default methods====

Java SE 8 introduced default methods to interfaces which allows developers to add new methods to existing interfaces without breaking compatibility with the classes already implementing the interface. Unlike regular interface methods, default methods have a body which will get called in the case if the implementing class doesn&#x27;t override it.
interface StringManipulator {
 String extendString(String input);
 // A method which is optional to implement
 default String shortenString(String input) {
 return input.substring(1);
}

// This is a valid class despite not implementing all the methods
class PartialStringManipulator implements StringManipulator {
 @Override
 public String extendString(String input) {
 return input + &quot; Extended&quot;;
}
====Static methods====
Static methods is another language feature introduced in Java SE 8. They behave in exactly the same way as in the classes.
interface StringUtils {
 static String shortenByOneSymbol(String input) {
 return input.substring(1);
}

StringUtils.shortenByOneSymbol(&quot;Test&quot;);
====Private methods====

Private methods were added in the Java 9 release. An interface can have a method with a body marked as private, in which case it will not be visible to inheriting classes. It can be called from default methods for the purposes of code reuse.
interface Logger {
 default void logError() {
 log(Level.ERROR);

 default void logInfo() {
 log(Level.INFO);

 private void log(Level level) {
 SystemLogger.log(level.id);
}
====Annotations====

Annotations in Java are a way to embed metadata into code. This language feature was introduced in J2SE 5.0.

=====Annotation types=====
Java has a set of predefined annotation types, but it is allowed to define new ones. An annotation type declaration is a special type of an interface declaration. They are declared in the same way as the interfaces, except the codice_160 keyword is preceded by the codice_161 sign. All annotations are implicitly extended from codice_162 and cannot be extended from anything else.

@interface BlockingOperations {


Annotations may have the same declarations in the body as the common interfaces, in addition they are allowed to include enums and annotations. The main difference is that abstract method declarations must not have any parameters or throw any exceptions. Also they may have a default value, which is declared using the codice_42 keyword after the method name:
@interface BlockingOperations {
 boolean fileSystemOperations();
 boolean networkOperations() default false;


=====Usage of annotations=====
Annotations may be used in any kind of declaration, whether it is package, class (including enums), interface (including annotations), field, method, parameter, constructor, or local variable. Also they can be used with enum constants. Annotations are declared using the codice_161 sign preceding annotation type name, after which element-value pairs are written inside brackets. All elements with no default value must be assigned a value.
@BlockingOperations(/*mandatory*/ fileSystemOperations,
/*optional*/ networkOperations = true)
void openOutputStream() { //Annotated method


Besides the generic form, there are two other forms to declare an annotation, which are shorthands. &quot;Marker annotation&quot; is a short form, it is used when no values are assigned to elements:

@Unused // Shorthand for @Unused()
void travelToJupiter() {


The other short form is called &quot;single element annotation&quot;. It is used with annotations types containing only one element or in the case when multiple elements are present, but only one elements lacks a default value. In single element annotation form the element name is omitted and only value is written instead:
/* Equivalent for @BlockingOperations(fileSystemOperations = true).
networkOperations has a default value and
does not have to be assigned a value */

@BlockingOperations(true)
void openOutputStream() {


==Generics==
Generics, or parameterized types, or parametric polymorphism, is one of the major features introduced in J2SE 5.0. Before generics were introduced, it was required to declare all the types explicitly. With generics, it became possible to work in a similar manner with different types without declaring the exact types. The main purpose of generics is to ensure type safety and to detect runtime errors during compilation. Unlike C#, information on the used parameters is not available at runtime due to type erasure.

===Generic classes===

Classes can be parameterized by adding a type variable inside angle brackets (codice_165 and codice_166) following the class name. It makes possible the use of this type variable in class members instead of actual types. There can be more than one type variable, in which case they are declared in a comma-separated list.

It is possible to limit a type variable to a subtype of some specific class or declare an interface that must be implemented by the type. In this case the type variable is appended by the codice_147 keyword followed by a name of the class or the interface. If the variable is constrained by both class and interface or if there are several interfaces, the class name is written first, followed by interface names with codice_168 sign used as the delimiter.
/* This class has two type variables, T and V. T must be 
a subtype of ArrayList and implement Formattable interface */
public class Mapper&lt;T extends ArrayList &amp; Formattable, V&gt; {
 public void add(T array, V item) {
 // array has add method because it is an ArrayList subclass
 array.add(item);
}
When a variable of a parameterized type is declared or an instance is created, its type is written exactly in the same format as in the class header, except the actual type is written in the place of the type variable declaration.
/* Mapper is created with CustomList as T and Integer as V.
CustomList must be a subclass of ArrayList and implement Formattable */
Mapper&lt;CustomList, Integer&gt; mapper = new Mapper&lt;CustomList, Integer&gt;();
Since Java SE 7, it is possible to use a diamond (codice_169) in place of type arguments, in which case the latter will be inferred. The following code in Java SE 7 is equivalent to the code in the previous example:
Mapper&lt;CustomList, Integer&gt; mapper = new Mapper&lt;&gt;();
When declaring a variable for a parameterized type, it is possible to use wildcards instead of explicit type names. Wildcards are expressed by writing codice_170 sign instead of the actual type. It is possible to limit possible types to the subclasses or superclasses of some specific class by writing the codice_147 keyword or the codice_149 keyword correspondingly followed by the class name.
/* Any Mapper instance with CustomList as the first parameter
may be used regardless of the second one.*/
Mapper&lt;CustomList, ?&gt; mapper;
mapper = new Mapper&lt;CustomList, Boolean&gt;();
mapper = new Mapper&lt;CustomList, Integer&gt;();

/* Will not accept types that use anything but
a subclass of Number as the second parameter */
void addMapper(Mapper&lt;?, ? extends Number&gt; mapper) {


===Generic methods and constructors===
Usage of generics may be limited to some particular methods, this concept applies to constructors as well. To declare a parameterized method, type variables are written before the return type of the method in the same format as for the generic classes. In the case of constructor, type variables are declared before the constructor name.
class Mapper {
 // The class itself is not generic, the constructor is
 &lt;T, V&gt; Mapper(T array, V item) {
}

/* This method will accept only arrays of the same type as
the searched item type or its subtype*/
static &lt;T, V extends T&gt; boolean contains(T item, V[] arr) {
 for (T currentItem : arr) {
 if (item.equals(currentItem)) {
 return true;
 }
 return false;


===Generic interfaces===
Interfaces can be parameterized in the similar manner as the classes.
interface Expandable&lt;T extends Number&gt; {
 void addItem(T item);

// This class is parameterized
class Array&lt;T extends Number&gt; implements Expandable&lt;T&gt; {
 void addItem(T item) {
}

// And this is not and uses an explicit type instead
class IntegerArray implements Expandable&lt;Integer&gt; {
 void addItem(Integer item) {
}

<doc id="1079505" wikidata="Q27603" url="?curid=1079505" title="Don Alden Adams">
<text>Don Alden Adams (January 16, 1925 – December 30, 2019) was president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania (2000–2014), the principal corporation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

== Biography ==
Born in January 16, 1925 in Oak Park, Illinois, Adams grew up in a big family, which originally had connections to the Episcopal church. His mother showed interest in Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and gradually the children also became interested. His father initially showed no interest, but involved himself in a legal case when one of Don&#x27;s younger brothers was not exempted from military service, and eventually became a member.

After serving as a full-time preacher, Adams was invited in late 1944 to serve at the world headquarters of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York, where he was secretary to Society president, Nathan H. Knorr. By the 1960s, Adams served directly under the Governing Body as a zone overseer, visiting various countries to audit branch offices and meet with Witness missionaries. Later, Adams directed world missionary activities, and served on the &quot;Bethel Home Committee&quot;.

In 2000, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; described Adams as &quot;a longtime insider ... at the world headquarters in Brooklyn Heights.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Adams as &quot;a 50-year veteran of the organization,&quot; which has been restated in subsequent publications. Adams also served on the Publishing Committee.

==Watch Tower Society presidency==
Adams, a Governing Body &quot;helper&quot;, became president of the Watch Tower Society after Governing Body member Milton G. Henschel stepped down from the position in 2000. In that year, members of the Governing Body resigned from their executive positions of the corporations of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, although the periodical &quot;Christianity Today&quot; reported that the Governing Body of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses would continue its &quot;oversight&quot; role.

Adams&#x27; presidency was administrative, and he is not considered to have impacted the organization&#x27;s ministry as have past Watch Tower Society presidents. Adams&#x27; brother, Joel Adams, was a vice-president of the Christian Congregation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Inc., a related corporation.

In 2014, Adams was replaced as president of the Watch Tower Society by Robert Ciranko. Adams died in December 2019, at the age of 94.

<text>Adrienne Ames (born Ruth Adrienne McClure; August 3, 1907 – May 31, 1947) was an American film actress. Early in her career she was known as Adrienne Truex.

==Early years==
Ames was born in Fort Worth, Texas, one of six children of Samuel Hugh McClure and Flora Parthenia (née Potter) McClure.

==Career==
===Film===

Ames began her film career in 1927 as a stand-in for Pola Negri. Ames was soon cast in small film roles in silent films. With the advent of talking pictures, Ames&#x27; popularity grew and she was usually cast as society women, or in musicals. She made thirty films during the 1930s with her biggest success in &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot; (1934). She appeared with the three leading men from the 1931 version of &quot;Dracula&quot; (Bela Lugosi, David Manners, and Edward Van Sloan) in &quot;The Death Kiss&quot; (1932).

===Radio===
Ames left Hollywood for New York. In 1941, she was hostess of two talk shows on station WHN in New York City. Her schedule included broadcasts at noon and 3:30 p.m. six days a week and 7:30 p.m. broadcasts on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. She continued broadcasting until two weeks before her death in 1947.

===Television===
In December 1941, Ames began a weekly series of movie-review programs on WNBT in New York City. The 10-minute programs ran on Tuesday afternoons.

==Personal life==
Ames was married three times. In 1920, at the age of 13 or 14, she married Derward Dumont Truax, the son of an oil businessman. They had a daughter, and divorced in 1924. A later marriage to broker Stephen Ames ended in divorce on October 30, 1933. Her last marriage, on October 31, 1933, was to fellow actor Bruce Cabot; they divorced on July 24, 1935.

==Death==
Ames died of cancer on May 31, 1947, in New York City, aged 39. She is interred in the Oakwood Cemetery in her hometown of Fort Worth, Texas.

For her contributions to the film industry, Ames has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1612 Vine Street. It was dedicated February 8, 1960.

<doc id="1079509" wikidata="Q352455" url="?curid=1079509" title="Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband">
<text>Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) is a patented wideband speech audio coding standard developed based on Adaptive Multi-Rate encoding, using a similar methodology to algebraic code-excited linear prediction (ACELP). AMR-WB provides improved speech quality due to a wider speech bandwidth of 50–7000 Hz compared to narrowband speech coders which in general are optimized for POTS wireline quality of 300–3400 Hz. AMR-WB was developed by Nokia and VoiceAge and it was first specified by 3GPP.

AMR-WB is codified as G.722.2, an ITU-T standard speech codec, formally known as &quot;Wideband coding of speech at around 16 kbit/s using Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB)&quot;. G.722.2 AMR-WB is the same codec as the 3GPP AMR-WB. The corresponding 3GPP specifications are TS 26.190 for the speech codec and TS 26.194 for the Voice Activity Detector.

The AMR-WB format has the following parameters:
* Frequency bands processed: 50–6400 Hz (all modes) plus 6400–7000 Hz (23.85 kbit/s mode only)
* Delay frame size: 20 ms
* Look ahead: 5 ms
* AMR-WB codec employs a bandsplitting filter; the one-way delay of this filter is 0.9375 ms
* Complexity: 38 WMOPS, RAM 5.3 kilowords
* Voice activity detection, discontinuous transmission, comfort noise generator
* Fixed point: bit-exact C code
* Floating point: under work

A common file extension for the AMR-WB file format is codice_1. There also exists another storage format for AMR-WB that is suitable for applications with more advanced demands on the storage format, like random access or synchronization with video. This format is the 3GPP-specified 3GP container format, based on the ISO base media file format. 3GP also allows use of AMR-WB bit streams for stereo sound.

==AMR modes==
AMR-WB operates, like AMR, with nine different bit rates. The lowest bit rate providing excellent speech quality in a clean environment is 12.65 kbit/s. Higher bit rates are useful in background noise conditions and for music. Also, lower bit rates of 6.60 and 8.85 kbit/s provide reasonable quality, especially when compared to narrow-band codecs.

The frequencies from 6.4 kHz to 7 kHz are only transmitted in the highest bitrate mode (23.85 kbit/s), while in the rest of the modes the decoder generates sounds by using the lower frequency data (75–6400 Hz) along with random noise (in order to simulate the high frequency band).

All modes are sampled at 16 kHz (using 14-bit resolution) and processed at 12.8 kHz.

The bit rates are the following:

* Mandatory multi-rate configuration
** 6.60 kbit/s (used for circuit switched GSM and UMTS connections; should only be used temporarily during bad radio connections and is not considered wideband speech)
** 8.85 kbit/s (used for circuit switched GSM and UMTS connections; should only be used temporarily during bad radio connections and is not considered wideband speech; provides quality equal to G.722 at 48 kbit/s for clean speech)
** 12.65 kbit/s (main anchor bitrate; used for circuit switched GSM and UMTS connections; offers superior audio quality to AMR at and above this bit rate; provides quality equal to or better than G722 at 56 kbit/s for clean speech)
* Higher bitrates for speech in adverse background noise environments, combined speech and music, and multi-party conferencing.
** 14.25 kbit/s
** 15.85 kbit/s
** 18.25 kbit/s
** 19.85 kbit/s
** 23.05 kbit/s (not targeted for full-rate GSM channels)
** 23.85 kbit/s (provides quality equal to G.722 at 64 kbit/s for clean speech; not targeted for full-rate GSM channels)
Notes: &quot;The codec mode can be changed every 20 ms in 3G WCDMA channels and every 40 ms in GSM/GERAN channels. (For Tandem Free Operation interoperability with GSM/GERAN, mode change rate is restricted in 3G to 40 ms in AMR-WB encoders.)&quot; 

==Configurations for 3GPP==
When used in mobile phone networks, there are three different configurations (combinations of bitrates) that may be used for voice channels:

* Configuration A (Config-WB-Code 0): 6.6, 8.85, and 12.65 kbit/s (Mandatory multi-rate configuration)
* Configuration B (Config-WB-Code 2): 6.6, 8.85, 12.65, and 15.85 kbit/s
* Configuration C (Config-WB-Code 4): 6.6, 8.85, 12.65, and 23.85 kbit/s

This limitation was designed to simplify the negotiation of bitrate between the handset and the base station, thus vastly simplifying the implementation and testing. All other bitrates can still be used for other purposes in mobile phone networks, including multimedia messaging, streaming audio, etc.

==Deployment==
AMR-WB has been standardized by a mobile phone manufacturer consortium for future usage in networks such as UMTS. Its speech quality is high, but older networks will have to be upgraded to support a wideband codec.

In October 2006, the first AMR-WB tests were conducted in a deployed network by T-Mobile in Germany, in cooperation with Ericsson.

In 2007 an end-to-end AMR-WB TrFO capable 3G &amp; VoIP product line was commercially released by NSN (M13.6 MSS, U3C MGW). AMR-WB TFO support was commercially released in 2008 (M14.2, U4.0). End-to-end TFO/TrFO negotiation and mid-call optimization (e.g. on handover, CF or CT events) was released in 2009 (M14.3, U4.1).

In late 2009, Orange UK announced that it would be introducing AMR-WB on its network in 2010. In France Orange S.A. and SFR are using AMR-WB format on their 3G+ networks since the end of summer 2010.

WIND Mobile in Canada launched HD Voice (AMR-WB) on its 3G+ network in February, 2011. WIND Mobile also announced that several handsets will support HD Voice (AMR-WB) in the first half of 2011, with the first one being Alcatel Tribe.

In January 2013, T-Mobile became the first GSM/UMTS based network in the US to enable AMR-WB.

In Feb 2013, Chunghwa Telecom became the first GSM/UMTS based network in Taiwan to enable AMR-WB.
In August 2013 the AMR-WB standard was introduced in Ukraine by Kyivstar.
Nokia developed the VMR-WB format for CDMA2000 networks, which is fully interoperable with 3GPP AMR-WB. AMR-WB is also a widely adapted format in mobile handsets for ringtones.

The AMR wideband speech format shall be supported in 3G multimedia services when wideband speech working at 16 kHz sampling frequency is supported. This requirement is defined in 3GPP technical specifications for IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and Transparent end-to-end Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS). In 3GPP specifications is AMR-WB format also used in 3GP container format.

==Licensing==

The patent for AMR expired in 2024. Previously G.722.2 was licensed by VoiceAge Corporation.

==Tools==
For encoding and decoding AMR-WB, an open-source library named OpenCORE exists. The OpenCORE codec can be used in ffmpeg.

For encoding, another open-source library exists as well, provided by VisualOn. It is included in the Android mobile operating system.

<text>Edward James &quot;Eddie&quot; Hart (born April 24, 1949) is an American former track and field sprinter and Olympic champion in the men&#x27;s 4 × 100 m relay race at the 1972 Summer Olympics.

Born in Martinez, California, Hart won the NCAA championships in 100 yd in 1970 as a University of California student.

At the US Olympic Trials in 1972, both Hart and Rey Robinson repeated the world record, running the 100 m in 9.9 seconds, and were favored to win the race at the Olympic Games. But in Munich, they were both eliminated in the 100 m race because their coach, Stan Wright, unknowingly using an outdated Olympic schedule to determine the starting time of their quarterfinal heat, failed to deliver them to the track on time. This failure due to disorganization created much controversy. Hart also ran the anchoring leg in the American 4 × 100 m relay team, which won a gold medal and equalled the United States&#x27; own world record of 38.19.

Hart continued to run and in 1989 set the Masters world record in the 100 m that lasted for 14 years.

In 2017 Hart released a book, &quot;Disqualified: Eddie Hart, Munich 1972, and the Voices of the Most Tragic Olympics&quot; about his Olympic experience.

<text>Algebraic code-excited linear prediction (ACELP) is a speech coding algorithm in which a limited set of pulses is distributed as excitation to a linear prediction filter. It is a linear predictive coding (LPC) algorithm that is based on the code-excited linear prediction (CELP) method and has an algebraic structure. ACELP was developed in 1989 by the researchers at the Université de Sherbrooke in Canada.

The ACELP method is widely employed in current speech coding standards such as AMR, EFR, AMR-WB (G.722.2), VMR-WB, EVRC, EVRC-B, SMV, TETRA, PCS 1900, MPEG-4 CELP and ITU-T G-series standards G.729, G.729.1 (first coding stage) and G.723.1. The ACELP algorithm is also used in the proprietary ACELP.net codec. Audible Inc. use a modified version for their speaking books. It is also used in conference-calling software, speech compression tools and has become one of the 3GPP formats.

The ACELP patent expired in 2018 and is now royalty-free.

==Features==
The main advantage of ACELP is that the algebraic codebook it uses can be made very large (&gt; 50 bits) without running into storage (RAM/ROM) or complexity (CPU time) problems.

==Technology==
The ACELP algorithm is based on that used in code-excited linear prediction (CELP), but ACELP codebooks have a specific algebraic structure imposed upon them.

A 16-bit algebraic codebook shall be used in the innovative codebook search, the aim of which is to find the best innovation and gain parameters. The innovation vector contains, at most, four non-zero pulses.

In ACELP, a block of &quot;N&quot; speech samples is synthesized by filtering an appropriate innovation sequence from a codebook, scaled by a gain factor &quot;g&quot; &quot;c&quot;, through two time-varying filters.

The long-term (pitch) synthesis filter is given by:

:formula_1

The short-term synthesis filter is given by: 
:formula_2

<text>John Hoole (December 1727 – 2 August 1803) was an English translator, the son of Samuel Hoole (born 1692), a mechanic, and Sarah Drury (c. 1700 – c. 1793), the daughter of a Clerkenwell clockmaker. He became a personal friend of Samuel Johnson&#x27;s.

==Family==
Hoole was born in Moorfields, London, and was educated at a private school at Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, kept by a James Bennet. In 1757 he married Susannah Smith (c. 1730 – 1808), a Quaker from Bishop&#x27;s Stortford. They had a son, Rev. Samuel Hoole, who became a poet and religious writer of some distinction.

==Works==
At the age of seventeen John Hoole became a clerk in India House (1744–83), of which he rose to be principal auditor of Indian accounts. In connection with his post, he wrote &quot;Present State of the English East India Company&#x27;s Affairs&quot; (1772).

Meanwhile he translated Torquato Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; (1763), and Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; (1773–83), as well as other works from the Italian. He was also the author of &quot;Cleonice, Princess of Bithynia&quot; and of two other dramas which failed.

Samuel Johnson was a personal friend of Hoole, who described Johnson&#x27;s final days in the &quot;European Magazine&quot; of 1799. Robert Southey recalled that Hoole&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem Delivered&quot; was &quot;the first book he ever possessed,&quot; apart from a set of sixpenny children&#x27;s books. Hoole was a genial character, but termed as a translator not unfairly by Sir Walter Scott as &quot;a noble transmuter of gold into lead&quot;.

David Barclay of Youngsbury turned to Hoole to write the biography of his friend John Scott of Amwell, when Johnson, his first choice, died before he could do so.

==Retirement==
In 1786 Hoole retired to the parsonage of Abinger, Surrey. Afterwards he lived at Tenterden, Kent, and died in Dorking.

==Selected works==
*&quot;Cyrus&quot; (1768, play)
*&quot;Timanthes&quot; (1770, play)
*&quot;Cleonice, Princess of Bithynia&quot; (1775, play)

<text>Thomas Hartwell Horne (20 October 1780 – 27 January 1862) was an English theologian and librarian.

==Life==
He was born in London and educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital until he was 15 when his father died and he had to work. He then became a clerk to a barrister, and used his spare time to write.

Horne was initially affiliated with the Wesleyans but later joined the Church of England. He was admitted to holy orders without the usual preliminaries, because of his published work. In 1833 he obtained a benefice in London and a prebend in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Horne was a librarian in 1814 at the Surrey Institution, which was dissolved in 1823. He was admitted sizar to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1819. In 1824 he joined the staff at the British Museum and was senior assistant in the printed books department there until 1860. He prepared a new system for cataloguing books at the museum but it was never used there. He did use it, however, to reclassify the extensive library of Frances Mary Richardson Currer in 1833.

==Works==
Horne wrote more than forty works in bibliography, Bible commentaries, and Christian apologetics. One of his best known works is the three-volume &quot;Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures&quot; that was published in 1818. This work enjoyed widespread circulation in Britain and North America and went through at least eleven editions during the nineteenth century. It was reissued in North America in 1970. Horne also produced a &quot;Tree Full of Bible Lore,&quot; a tree-shaped text of statistics on the Bible, in which he counted the number of books, chapters, verses, words, and even letters. He ended this tree with &quot;It [the Bible] contains knowledge, wisdom, holiness and love.&quot; (This &quot;tree&quot; is reproduced in the third series of Ripley&#x27;s paperbacks, originally published hardbound in 1949.)

He wrote an &quot;Introduction to the Study of Bibliography&quot; (1814), and various other works. Over a period of four years he catalogued the Harleian manuscripts then held at the British Museum.

<text>A defensive war () is one of the causes that justify war by the criteria of the Just War tradition. It means a war where at least one nation is mainly trying to defend itself from another, as opposed to a war where both sides are trying to invade and conquer each other.

The right to self-defence in international law is enshrined in Chapter VII, Article 51 of the UN Charter: 

Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of collective or individual self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by members in exercise of this right of self-defense shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.

==History==
American supporters of the war against the British argued that the War of 1812 was a defensive war, citing British harassment of American merchant shipping and impressment of American sailors on the high seas as well as armed support to Indian tribes resisting American expansion in the Midwest in order to create a pro-British Indian barrier state.

The Islamic scholar Sufyan al-Thawri (716–778), who was called by Majid Khadduri (1909–2007) a pacifist, maintained that &quot;jihad&quot; (holy war) was only a defensive war.

<doc id="1079534" wikidata="Q1484136" url="?curid=1079534" title="G.729">
<text>G.729 is a royalty-free narrow-band vocoder-based audio data compression algorithm using a frame length of 10 milliseconds. It is officially described as &quot;Coding of speech at 8 kbit/s using code-excited linear prediction&quot; speech coding (CS-ACELP), and was introduced in 1996. The wide-band extension of G.729 is called G.729.1, which equals G.729 Annex J.

Because of its low bandwidth requirements, G.729 is mostly used in voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications when bandwidth must be conserved. Standard G.729 operates at a bit rate of 8 kbit/s, but extensions provide rates of 6.4 kbit/s (Annex D, F, H, I, C+) and 11.8 kbit/s (Annex E, G, H, I, C+) for worse and better speech quality, respectively.

G.729 has been extended with various features, commonly designated as G.729a and G.729b:
* G.729: This is the original codec using a high-complexity algorithm.
* G.729A or Annex A: This version has a medium complexity, and is compatible with G.729. It provides a slightly lower voice quality.
* G.729B or Annex B: This version extends G.729 with silence suppression, and is not compatible with the previous versions.
* G.729AB: This version extends G.729A with silence suppression, and is only compatible with G.729B.
* G.729.1 or Annex J: This version extends G.729A and B with scalable variable encoding using hierarchical enhancement layers. It provides support for wideband speech and audio, using modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) coding.

Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF), fax transmissions, and high-quality audio cannot be transported reliably with this codec. DTMF requires the use of the named telephony events in the RTP payload for DTMF digits, telephony tones, and telephony signals as specified in RFC 4733.

==G.729 annexes==
===G.729 Annex A===
G.729a is a compatible extension of G.729, but requires less computational power. This lower complexity, however, bears the cost of marginally reduced speech quality.

G.729a was developed by a consortium of organizations: France Télécom, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT).

The features of G.729a are:
* Sampling frequency 8 kHz/16-bit (80 samples for 10 ms frames)
* Fixed bit rate (8 kbit/s 10 ms frames)
* Fixed frame size (10 bytes (80 bits) for 10 ms frame)
* Algorithmic delay is 15 ms per frame, with 5 ms look-ahead delay
* G.729a is a hybrid speech coder which uses Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction (ACELP)
* The complexity of the algorithm is rated at 15, using a relative scale where G.711 is 1 and G.723.1 is 25.
* PSQM testing under ideal conditions yields mean opinion scores of 4.04 for G.729a, compared to 4.45 for G.711 (μ-law)
* PSQM testing under network stress yields mean opinion scores of 3.51 for G.729a, compared to 4.13 for G.711 (μ-law)

Some VoIP phones incorrectly use the description &quot;G729a/8000&quot; in SDP (e.g. this affects some Cisco and Linksys phones). This is incorrect as G729a is an alternative method of encoding the audio, but still generates data decodable by either G729 or G729a - i.e. there is no difference in terms of codec negotiation. Since the SDP RFC allows static payload types to be overridden by the textual rtpmap description this can cause problems calling from these phones to endpoints adhering to the RFC unless the codec is renamed in their settings since they will not recognise &#x27;G729a&#x27; as &#x27;G729&#x27; without a specific workaround in place for the bug.

===G.729 Annex B===
G.729 has been extended in Annex B (G.729b) which provides a silence compression method that enables a voice activity detection (VAD) module. It is used to detect voice activity in the signal. It also includes a discontinuous transmission (DTX) module which decides on updating the background noise parameters for non speech (noisy frames). It uses 2-byte Silence Insertion Descriptor (SID) frames transmitted to initiate comfort noise generation (CNG). If transmission is stopped, and the link goes quiet because of no speech, the receiving side might assume that the link has been cut. By inserting comfort noise, analog hiss is simulated digitally during silence to assure the receiver that the link is active and operational.

===G.729 Annex J (G.729.1)===
G.729 Annex J, maintained by G.729.1, provides support for wideband speech and audio. Introduced in 2006, it defines variable bit-rate wideband enhancement using up to 12 hierarchical layers. The core layer is an 8 kbit/s G.729 bitstream, the second layer is a 4 kbit/s narrowband enhancement layer, and the third 2 kibt/s layer is a bandwidth enhancement layer. Further layers provide wideband enhancement in 2 kbit/s steps. The G.729.1 uses three-stage coding: embedded code-excited linear prediction (CELP) coding of the lower band, parametric coding of the higher band by Time-Domain Bandwidth Extension (TDBWE), and enhancement of the full band by a predictive transform coding algorithm called time-domain aliasing cancellation (TDAC), also known as modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) coding. Bit rate and the obtained quality are adjustable by simple bitstream truncation.

==Licensing==
As of January 1, 2017, the patent terms of most licensed patents under the G.729 Consortium have expired, the remaining unexpired patents are usable on a royalty-free basis. G.729 includes patents from several companies which were until the expiry licensed by Sipro Lab Telecom, the authorized Intellectual Property Licensing Administrator for G.729 technology and patent pool.

===Past patent litigation===
AIM IP LLC, a California Limited Liability Company based in Mission Viejo, CA filed 17 patent infringement lawsuits in the Central District Courts of California accusing 22 different companies, including, Cisco Systems, Polycom and others of infringing U.S. Patent No. 5,920,853. The &#x27;853 patent was filed at the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 1996 by Rockwell International. The inventors listed on the &#x27;853 patent are Benyassine Adil, Su Huan-Yu and Shlomot Eyal.

In 2000, the &#x27;853 patent was assigned by Rockwell International to Conexant Systems, an American-based software developer and fabless semiconductor company, which began as a division of Rockwell before being spun-off as its own public company. In 2010, the &#x27;853 patent was sold by Conexant Systems to AIM IP LLC, a California Limited Liability Company based in Mission Viejo.

The &#x27;853 patent contains patent claims which cover lookup tables used in G.729. The patent has since expired and is no longer in force due to its patent term expiring.

==RTP payload type==
G.729 is assigned the static payload type 18 for RTP by IANA. The rtpmap parameter description for this payload type is &quot;G729/8000&quot;.

Both G.729a and G.729b use the same rtpmap description as G.729. G.729a and G.729b are indicated using annexb=no or annexb=yes, respectively. G.729 Annex B (G.729b) is the default in absence of parameter &quot;annexb&quot; in the Session Description Protocol.

<doc id="1079537" wikidata="Q277928" url="?curid=1079537" title="Class A share">
<text>In finance, a class A share refers to a share classification of common or preferred stock that typically has enhanced benefits with respect to dividends, asset sales, or voting rights compared to Class B or Class C shares. There may be restrictions on any specific issue of class A shares in exchange for the benefits; for example, preferences with regard to dividends may be traded for &quot;reduced&quot; voting rights. They are often convertible into class B (may not be publicly traded) shares at a favorable rate.

For example, a company might allocate class A shares to its management giving them 7 times face value of class B shares, while class B shares have the same voting right as class A shares. Companies classify stock for many reasons. In some cases this is to give company insiders a greater degree of power over the company and to provide a better defense against events like hostile takeover attempts.

&quot;Class A share&quot; is also a way of pricing sales charges (loads) on mutual funds in the United States. In a class A share, the sales load is up front, typically at most 5.75% of the amount invested. In contrast is the class B share that does not have an upfront charge, but instead has higher ongoing expenses in the form of a higher 12B-1 fee, and a contingent deferred sales charge that only applies if the investor redeems shares before a specified period. The maximum A share sales load is decreased for larger investment amounts as a volume discount.

<doc id="1079538" wikidata="Q476914" url="?curid=1079538" title="Ryti–Ribbentrop Agreement">
<text>The Ryti–Ribbentrop letter of agreement () was a personal letter from President of Finland Risto Ryti to German Führer Adolf Hitler signed on 26 June 1944. It was sent during the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive, which had started on 9 June and threatened to knock Finland out of the Continuation War.

The letter was a product of a week of Finno-German negotiations, where the Germans sought a political commitment to the war, while the Finns sought increased military aid in the form of both troops and materiel. In the letter, Ryti agreed not to seek a separate peace in the war with the Soviet Union without approval from Nazi Germany. The letter was intentionally phrased by the Finns in a way where it would not bind Ryti&#x27;s successors, as Finland had already contacted the Soviet Union in secret, seeking to exit the war.

During the negotiations, the Germans sent to Finland one infantry division, a brigade of assault guns, and a Luftwaffe detachment. The Finns also received significant amounts of anti-tank weaponry. Because most of the German aid either predated the agreement, or alternatively arrived too late to meaningfully contribute to the Finnish success in stabilizing the military situation, historians have questioned whether the agreement was a necessity for the Finns.

The agreement, which completely bypassed the Finnish Parliament, was criticized heavily both within Finland and internationally. In July, Germany pulled all forces out of southern Finland, and Ryti resigned on 1 August, resulting in a Finno-Soviet armistice on 2 September. As a condition for peace, Finland had to remove any remaining German forces from Lapland, resulting in the Lapland War.

== Historical background ==
The Finnish military ties to Germany date back to World War I and the Finnish Civil War. During World War I, some 1,900 Finnish volunteers of the Jäger Movement traveled in secret to Germany where they received military training and formed the 27th Royal Prussian Jäger Battalion. The Battalion fought as part of the Imperial German Army on the Eastern Front of World War I. Following the start of the Finnish Civil War on 27 January 1918, the volunteers returned to Finland to fight on the side of the Whites. They took various roles in the White army, with some 400 jägers being promoted to officers and approximately 660 becoming non-commissioned officers. The jägers were soon joined by Imperial German forces who also took part on the side of the Whites and captured the capital Helsinki by mid-April. After the civil war, the jäger volunteers would go on to take leading roles in the post-civil war Finnish Army, which was consequently heavily influenced by a German military tradition.

Following the civil war, Germanophilic, Russophobic and anti-communist stances were prevalent especially among the ruling elites and the military leadership. These anti-communist sentiments were common even among those Finnish officers whose background was in the Russian Army. At the same time, this Germanophilia was not accompanied by keen Nazi sympathy. For example, Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, who commanded the White forces during the Finnish Civil War and would go on to command the Finnish military during World War II, &quot;preferred alliances with the Western Powers and the Scandinavian countries rather than with Germany.&quot;

The Finno-Soviet Winter War began on 26 November 1939, when the Soviet Union attacked Finland. The attack followed the signing of the Soviet–German Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact which in a secret appendix assigned Finland into the Soviet sphere of influence. While the international reactions to the war were strongly against the Soviet Union, the international outrage materialized in only limited support, focused on materiel rather than troops. The British and French planned for an expeditionary force in December 1939, but the plans remained &quot;diffused&quot; and vague to the end of the war. Similarly, the lack of German support came as a shock to many in Finland.

After the end of the Winter War in early 1940, Finnish officers began discussions with Germans about a possible future war with the Soviet Union. While historians have been unable to establish exactly what was discussed when and by whom, it is known that Hermann Göring messaged the Finnish leadership already during the Winter War, urging them to seek peace as the losses would be returned later. Later in the fall of 1940, the Finnish government allowed German troop movements to northern Norway.

Concrete negotiations for the future war between military officials began in 1941, potentially as early as January, but at the latest on 25 May 1941 in Salzburg. The Finns and the Germans agreed that Germany would take responsibility for operations in northern Finland, while the Finnish army was in charge of operations in the southeast of Finland and east of Lake Ladoga. The Finns would advance into Soviet Eastern Karelia where they would link up with German forces on the Svir. Forward elements of the German troops began arriving in Finland on 1 June, while follow-on talks continued in Helsinki to 6 June, with the Finnish army mobilizing on 10 June 1941.

Following the start of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June, the Soviet Air Force struck various targets in Finland. These included both military targets, such as airfields used by the Germans, as well as civilian targets in Helsinki and other major Finnish cities. Following the bombings, the Finnish parliament announced on 25 June that war had broken out between Finland and the Soviet Union. The Finnish Army of Karelia began offensive operations in south-eastern Finland on the night of 9–10 July 1941, with Finnish troops crossing the border soon after midnight. The Finnish forces reached Svir by 8 September, with forces of the Finnish VI corps arriving at Kuuttilahti, Lodeynoye Pole and the Svir railway station. The Finns crossed the river on 12 September, establishing a bridgehead that would eventually reach a width of and a depth of . It soon became clear, however, that the German forces would not be able to reach the Svir from the south. The Finns were hesitant to advance southwards, themselves, and the front stabilized into stationary or trench warfare.

Despite the extremely close Finno-German collaboration, Finland consistently rejected a political alliance with Germany, instead framing its actions to the Western powers as a separate, defensive war. Over the winter of 1941–42, the Finnish leadership became increasingly worried about the direction of the war. Finland, however, remained dependent on Germany for both food and military supply. Only after the collapse of the siege of Leningrad in January 1944 and the bombing of several Finnish cities did the Finns prepare for peace talks. The Germans answered these peace feelers by a weapons and grain embargo, which further increased the Finnish dependence on German aid. The situation deteriorated further when the Soviet Union launched the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive on 9 June 1944.

== Negotiations ==
The situation had not stabilized by 17 June, and the Finns were being pushed back, especially on the Karelian Isthmus, causing increasing concern among both the Finns and the Germans. It appeared to the Germans that Finnish forces would not be able to halt the offensive on their own, and preparations were made to evacuate all German citizens from Finland. The Finnish General Headquarters, meanwhile, estimated that six to eight German divisions would be needed to defeat the Soviet offensive in addition to material aid.

This request for troops was then conveyed to German officials in Finland on 20 June. According to historian Markku Jokisipilä, the Finns would have known that such a request was unrealistic given the larger German strategic situation, and that the request was likely also intended to test whether the Germans had sufficient forces to retaliate against Finland in case it decided to seek an exit from the war. The German representative in Finland, Waldemar Erfurth, reported this request to the German High Command, who understood that the Finns also wanted closer political ties.

Hitler reacted to the Finnish request for aid by first ordering that the troops assigned to operations Tanne Ost and Tanne West, contingency plans for the capture of Suursaari and Åland from the Finns, be put on high alert. Soon after, however, he decided to send one brigade of assault guns, a division of infantry, and a detachment of aircraft to Finland as aid. He also ordered shipments of military material to be expedited. Finally, several light ships of the Kriegsmarine, including 6 submarines and the cruisers &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; and &quot;Niobe&quot;, were ordered to the area. This help was contingent on the Finns holding the VKT-line of defense. The requested six divisions would not be available at this time.

On 21 June, the German High Command officially replied to the Finns that it was prepared to send the Finns one assault gun brigade, one detachment of aircraft, 30 assault guns, 40 Pak 40 anti-tank guns, 10,000 shots for Panzershreck anti-tank weapons, and some 85,000 rounds of artillery shells in various calibers. In turn, the Germans expected the Finns to hold the VKT-line of defenses. The situation, however, remained confused. In a phone call later that day, Erfurth was informed that the decision for sending aid had not, in fact, yet been officially made. Concurrently with these discussions, the Finnish leadership was privately discussing a need to exit the war, and decided to send out further peace feelers in secret.

Some disagreement remains over the discussions within the German leadership between 21 and 22 June. In any case, on 22 June 1944, Hitler sent his minister of foreign affairs Joachim von Ribbentrop to Helsinki. Ribbentrop was instructed to force the Finnish government to sign a political treaty with Germany in exchange for continued weapons shipments and other military aid. On the same day, the German cruisers &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; and &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; arrived in Helsinki, prompting Finnish concerns about the German intentions. The Finns were informed that a division from Heeresgruppe Nord had been ordered to reinforce the Finns, and that the first half of the promised assault gun brigade would arrive in Helsinki later that day. In all, the Germans could be expected to arrive at the front by 27 June.

In negotiations with the Finnish President Risto Ryti during the night of 22–23 June, Ribbentrop indicated the Germans would be able to send further help in the form of aircraft and two or three assault gun brigades, and that a further one or two divisions of infantry could be &quot;considered.&quot; On 23 June, Ribbentrop informed Erfurth that all help, including that currently en route, was contingent on a clear, official, &quot;confessions&quot; to Germany and that the &quot;theory&quot; of a Finnish separate war was no longer acceptable to the Germans. The decision would have to be made by 25 June, when Ribbentrop was to travel to Bulgaria, and this information was conveyed to the Finnish representatives the following day.

While the Finnish political and military leadership continued discussions on how to reply to the German demands, a Soviet reply to the Finnish peace feelers arrived in Helsinki. In it, the Soviet Union demanded an official declaration, signed by both the president and the minister of foreign affairs, that the Finns truly were prepared to surrender. This caused further chaos in the Finnish leadership, who were divided about the correct steps to take.

In a meeting on 24 June, the Finnish leadership estimated that the situation on the Finnish fronts had stabilized, with Soviet forces suffering heavy casualties and transferring their focus further south. The Germans were presented with a draft of a Finnish declaration that promised the Finns would continued to fight the Soviets, albeit without reference to fighting &quot;alongside&quot; the Germans. This draft, however, was rejected by Ribbentrop as being too vague and non-binding. He replied with a draft letter, to be signed and sent by Ryti. A key point of the letter was a promise that the Finns would not &quot;lay down their arms&quot; unless in agreement with the Germans. Debate remains about whether the rest of the German military and political leadership was aware of Ribbentrop&#x27;s hard line.

By 26 June, Mannerheim had been convinced that the Finns had to accept the German demands, but sought ways to make an agreement less binding. In the end, following Finno-German negotiations over some of the exact verbiage driven by the Finnish minister of foreign affairs Henrik Ramsay, it was decided that the Finnish government would completely bypass the parliament, and instead send a letter, signed personally by Ryti, which stated that no Finnish government or official authorized by Ryti would start peace negotiations without consulting with Germany. The letter had neither the official support of the Finnish government, nor was it passed through parliament. Ryti later stated that the agreement had been crafted specifically so as to not bind his successors.

== Final agreement ==

The final text of the letter, as sent by Ryti, is as follows (Finnish on the left, English translation on the right):
== Reactions and consequences ==

The agreement was criticized heavily both in Finland and internationally, but resulted in the renewal of German weapons shipments. The Social Democratic Party threatened to leave the government. While it did not act on the threat following internal debate, it published a statement where it denounced the letter and the idea that Finland was not in a separate defensive war. Internationally, United States severed diplomatic ties with Finland on 30 June.

Historians disagree about the necessity of the agreement. There exists a general agreement that especially the Panzerfaust and Panzerschrek anti-tank weapons were the most important part of the German aid. The weapons used to halt the Soviet offensive, however, were already in Finland by the time the agreement was signed. Some historians, such as Vesa Nenye &quot;et al.&quot;, state that the German military materiel, together with support from a German infantry division, an assault gun brigade and the Luftwaffe Detachment Kuhlmey, allowed the Finns to eventually stop the Soviet offensive. These formations, however, had also been sent to Finland in the days prior to the signing of the agreement. On the other hand, their continued stay in Finland could be attributed to the agreement. Similarly, Markku Jokisipilä estimates that Finnish stockpiles of artillery shells would have lasted to the end of the year. Jokisipilä cites historian Osmo Kolehmainen, who states that the German aid had an &quot;almost inconsequential&quot; effect on the stabilization of the front, with the exception of the Luftwaffe detachment.

Only a few weeks later, on 12 July, the Soviet offensive was officially halted, with troops transferred further south. Soon after, Hitler decided to pull back any German presence in southern Finland. Two assault gun brigades that had been ordered to Finland were instead redirected to other sectors of the front, and on 21 July, Detachment Kuhlmey was recalled from Finland.

== Finnish exit from the war ==

While the Soviet offensive had been halted, the Finns remained in a precarious strategic situation. They were still dependent on German food, and German forces remained in the country. At the same time, the Soviets would have no need for a negotiated peace if Finland waited until a German exit from the war. On 17 July 1944, the Soviets informed the Finns that they were prepared for peace negotiations, with the main demand being that Finland would need to change its government. As a result, on 1 August 1944, Ryti resigned the presidency and was replaced by Mannerheim on 4 August. The Germans attempted to keep the Finns involved in the war by sending Chief of the German High Command Wilhelm Keitel to Helsinki on 17 August, but Mannerheim informed Keitel he did not consider himself to be bound by Ryti&#x27;s agreement.

Finno-Soviet negotiations continued until 2 September, when the Finnish parliament accepted the Soviet demands. A cease-fire was agreed to begin on 4 September, ending the war between the Finns and the Soviets. As part of the Soviet demands, the Finns were to evict any remaining German forces from Finland. Accordingly, on 2 September 1944, the Finns informed the Germans of severing all ties between the nations, and demanded that Germans leave Finland. Despite initial peaceful movements by the Germans, the situation soon deteriorated in the wake of an attempted German landing on the Finnish-held Suursaari, resulting in the Finno-German Lapland War, which ended on 27 April 1945 when the last German forces left Finnish territory.

<text>John Howie (14 November 1735 – 5 January 1793) was a Scottish biographer. His best known work was &quot;Biographia Scoticana&quot;, first published in 1775, which is often called &quot;The Scots Worthies&quot;. It deals with Christians and particularly Presbyterians especially in their strivings with church and civil authorities.

==Life==
John Howie was an East Renfrewshire farmer from Lochgoin, who claimed descent from an Albigensian refugee. The author was the 28th descendant in a direct line, all of whom were called John. Although he was a plain unlettered peasant, cultivating the same farm which his ancestors had occupied for ages, a natural predilection for literary pursuits induced him to take up the task of recording the lives of the martyrs and confessors of Scotland. His family home at Lochgoin Farm was a noted refuge for Covenanters, and was subject to several searches by government soldiers. The farmhouse was rebuilt in the 18th century, with the date 1187 on a lintel marking when the Howies first settled there. Several relics were kept in what has become a small museum, and in 1896 a stone obelisk was erected nearby as a monument &quot;in memory of John Howie, author of the &quot;Scots Worthies&quot;&quot;. It now lies within the area of Whitelee Wind Farm and has track access from the visitor centre.
==Works==
Howie wrote &quot;Lives&quot; of the Protestant worthies of Scotland from Patrick Hamilton, the first martyr, under the title of &quot;Biographia Scoticana&quot;, first published in 1775. It became a classic of Scottish Church History and was often called &quot;The Scots Worthies&quot;. He revised and enlarged the work, 1781–5, and this edition was reissued, with notes by William McGavin, in 1827. In 1870 the Rev. William Henderson Carslaw revised Howie&#x27;s text and published it, with illustrations and notes, and a short biographical introduction; and in 1876 a further illustrated edition appeared, with biographical notice compiled from statements made by Howie&#x27;s relatives, and an introductory essay by Dr. Robert Buchanan.

&quot;A Collection of Lectures and Sermons by Covenanting Clergymen&quot; was issued by Howie in 1779, with an introduction by himself. He edited in 1780 Michael Shields&#x27;s &quot;Faithful Contendings Display&#x27;d&quot;, an account of the Church of Scotland between 1681 and 1691. He also wrote on the Lord&#x27;s Supper, patronage, and other topics, and prefaced and annotated other religious works.

<text>Nawab Ali Haider Khan (11 February 1896 – 30 June 1963) was a Bengali noble and politician.

==Early life and family==
Khan was born on 11 February 1896 to an royal Bengali Shia family known as the Nawabs of Longla based in the village of Prithimpassa in South Sylhet (then under the North-East Frontier province of the British Raj). The royal family are descended from Sakhi Salamat, a Persian nobleman from Greater Khorasan, who settled in Prithimpassa after being granted land there by the Lodi sultans of Delhi in the 15th century. Khan&#x27;s father, Nawab Ali Amjad Khan, was an honorary magistrate by occupation. His mother, Syeda Fatima Banu, was the daughter of Syed Aminuddin Hasan of Narpati West Haveli in Chunarughat, Habiganj and a descendant of Syed Nasiruddin.

==Career==
The Assam Legislative Assembly was founded in 1937, and Khan won a seat in its first elections in the South Sylhet (East) constituency. Khan served as Assam&#x27;s Minister of Agriculture in the cabinet of Sir Muhammed Saadulah. From 1942 to 1946, he was the Minister of Power and Water Development in Gopinath Bordoloi&#x27;s cabinet. He was also the leader of the Independent Muslim Party. In 1945, he led his party into an alliance with Assam Congress and its coalition partners which included the likes of Bordoloi and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed (who later became the President of India). Bordoloi considered Khan as their mainstay.

In 1950, he hosted King Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran and Governor-General Khwaja Nazimuddin at his estate for four days and went hunting with them.

==Personal life==
In 1917, he married Nawabzadi Husna Ara Begum, the eldest child of Nawab Wasif Ali Mirza of Murshidabad. They had three children - Ali Safdar Khan, Syedunnessa Begum and Ali Sarwar Khan. He also had a son named Ali Dawar Khan.

==Death==
Khan died on 30 June 1963, in the village of Prithimpassa.

<doc id="1079584" wikidata="Q378185" url="?curid=1079584" title="Ippolito de' Medici">
<text>Ippolito de&#x27; Medici (March 1511 – 10 August 1535) was the only son of Giuliano di Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, born out of wedlock to his mistress Pacifica Brandano.

==Biography==
Ippolito was born in Urbino. His father died when he was only five (1516), and he was subsequently raised by his uncle Pope Leo X and his cousin Giulio de&#x27; Medici.

When Giulio was elected pope as Clement VII in 1523, Ippolito ruled Florence on his behalf (1524–1527). After the siege of Florence (1529–1530), however, Clement favored his nephew Alessandro de&#x27; Medici as the family member to take charge of Florence. To assist and succeed him in church affairs, Clement VII created his cousin Ippolito a cardinal on 10 January 1529, and on the same day named him first Archbishop of Avignon, a position that brought him a considerable income. Since he was only eighteen, he could not be consecrated a bishop or even be the administrator of the diocese without a papal dispensation. Ippolito was named Cardinal Priest of Santa Prassede, though there is no evidence that he was ever ordained a priest or consecrated as a bishop. His own preference was to be ruler of Florence, not a cleric, and he spent the rest of his life trying to renounce his clerical calling and depose his cousin Alessandro. On 3 May 1529, Cardinal Ippolito was named Papal Legate in Perugia.
On 12 August 1529, Cardinal Ippolito de&#x27; Medici was one of the three Cardinal Legates who met Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at Genoa with the purpose of conducting him in state to his coronation as Emperor in Bologna. In Bologna, he participated in the ceremonies of the coronation.

On 15 February 1530, Pope Clement granted Cardinal Ippolito a ⅓ share in the annual papal income from the town and territory of Chiusi for his lifetime.

Ippolito was sent to Hungary in the spring of 1532 as Papal Legate, departing from Rome on 8 July, according to the diaries of the Italian literatus Pietro Aretino. He was in Regensburg by 12 August. There he demonstrated a talent for soldiering, leading 8000 Hungarian soldiers against the Ottoman Turks, though the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent was unwilling to move forward so late in the season, and the Emperor Charles V only had sufficient forces for defense, not offence. When the Emperor returned to Italy early in the next year, Cardinal Ippolito followed him.

On 3 July 1532, Cardinal Ippolito was named Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church, the most lucrative office in the Roman Curia. Along with that post he was transferred to the Titular church of San Lorenzo in Damaso.

He was a friend to, and possibly had a liaison with, Giulia Gonzaga, the Countess of Fondi. He loved Catherine de&#x27; Medici, but they never married. Alessandro de&#x27; Medici once caught him and Catherine de&#x27; Medici in a private embrace. However, when he was sent away as a Cardinal, they weren&#x27;t allowed to see each other any longer. Some theories suggest that the reason Clement made Ippolito Cardinal was to keep him and Catherine de&#x27; Medici apart. By 24 April 1531, Catherine had been promised to Henry, the son of King Francis I of France, in a draft contract of marriage. Catherine was 11, and Cardinal Ippolito was 21.

Ippolito&#x27;s cousin, Pope Clement, died on 25 September 1534. The Conclave elected Cardinal Alessandro Farnese on 12 October and he chose the name Paul III. In 1535, free of his cousin&#x27;s influence, Cardinal Ippolito acted as Florentine ambassador to Emperor Charles V, happily conveying complaints against the administration of Alessandro de&#x27; Medici. Suffering from a low-grade fever for eight days, Ippolito died from malaria in Itri, in southern Lazio, although there were rumors that he had been poisoned either by Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, whose abuses he was intending to denounce, or by Pope Paul III, who aimed to acquire Ippolito&#x27;s lucrative benefices for his own nephews.

During the Renaissance, the Medici developed a large menagerie with human zoo in the Vatican. In the 16th century, Cardinal Ippolito de&#x27; Medici had a collection of people of different races as well as exotic animals. He is reported as having a troupe of so-called Savages, speaking over twenty languages; there were also Moors, Tartars, Indians, Turks and Africans.

<text>Larysza is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==

There are supposed to be two plowshares standing side by side, with the points upward and the sharp ends of the blade facing each other, on a red shield. On the helmet there are three white ostrich feathers. Thus, it was described by the author Bielski in his work, page 184; by Paprocki in Gniazdo cnoty [Nest of virtue], page 402 and in &quot;O herbach&quot; (Of Coats of Arms), p. 263; and by Okolski in his book, vol. 2, p. 39, and in &quot;Klejnoty&quot; (Crests), p. 36.

None of these authors found anything certain about when and why this coat of arms was conferred. Parisius in his manuscript infers that it got the name from Larissa, a city in Thessaly, before the birth of Christ. At that time the Sarmatians called the Mesians invaded Italy from the town of Larissa in Thessaly and captured many people as the spoils of war. Soon they were settled in Sarmatia, which had been little used previously because no one there knew how to farm the land, which turned out to be fertile. This seems to be somewhat corroborated by Ovid, book 3, Tristium Elegia 10, where he says of Sarmatia&#x27;s lack of fertility at that time, &quot;Aspiceres nudos, sineftonde, sine arbore campos, etc.&quot; [One sees fields bare of foliage or trees&quot;]. This was the main reason for its fertility, and thus the plowshares appear in the coat of arms.

He also reports that the coat of arms was conferred at a time when the Sarmatians, irritated by the Romans&#x27; frequent raids, attacked Italy and captured several cities, leveling them, then plowing the land and sowing it with salt. The discoverers of this method received as an award a coat of arms with plowshares. At least, that is the conjecture Parisius made regarding the origin of this coat of arms.

Paprocki cites two opinions regarding the origin of these arms. First, when Piast had been elevated to the throne, he honored his mothers&#x27; relatives with this shield; Tylkowski In dedicat. attests to this, but Okolski thinks otherwise. Secondly, when Jaromir, the true prince of Bohemia, was fleeing from his brother Wratyslaw, he came to Boleslaw the Brave, King of Poland. Wratyslaw, not content with having driven his brother from Bohemia, took his army and pursued his brother into Poland. As Boleslaw was leading ail expedition against Wratyslaw, along the way he encountered a man who was carrying two plowshares to the blacksmith to be repaired. The King started talking to this man and learned that the man knew all the trails in the forest and promised to guide the King through it. The man proved to be instrumental in the King&#x27;s victory, for he crept into the Bohemian camp before dawn. Finding the enemy asleep, he took away all their horses, after which Boleslaw attacked and easily conquered the horseless and still sleepy Bohemians. The King therefore allowed Laryssa, as the progenitor of this clan was supposedly named, to bear on his shield the plowshares he had been carrying.

Paprocki cites count Jankal Laryssa in his charters of 1264, as well as count Choschanus Larysza, cupbearer of Kalisz, in the same year. Paprocki also cites an anonymous source, reporting that under them, Jews received great privileges from this Duke.

<text>Eric John Bristow (25 April 1957 – 5 April 2018), nicknamed &quot;The Crafty Cockney&quot;, was an English professional darts player and one of the most recognisable and successful players of the 1980s. He was ranked World No. 1 by the World Darts Federation a record five times, in 1980, 1981, 1983–1985 and 1989-1990. Between 1980 and 1991, Bristow featured in ten BDO World Darts Championship finals, winning the title five times, in 1980, 1981, 1984, 1985 and 1986. He was also a five-time World Masters Champion, a four-time World Cup singles champion and twice winner of the News of the World Darts Championship. He won 22 WDF and BDO Major titles, 65 individual career titles and 15 titles in team events, a total of 80 overall. He hosted the first two episodes of the darts-themed ITV game show &quot;Bullseye&quot; and regularly featured on the show.

In late 1986, Bristow began experiencing symptoms of dartitis, which affected his career thereafter. In 1987, he began sponsoring and mentoring Phil Taylor, who went on to become the most successful darts player of all time. In 1993, Bristow and Taylor both became involved in the split in darts as two of the 16 players who left the British Darts Organisation (BDO) to form the World Darts Council, which later became the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). Bristow&#x27;s last major achievement as a player was reaching the semi-finals of the 1997 WDC World Darts Championship, where he narrowly lost to Taylor.

After retiring from competitive darts in 2007, Bristow worked as a commentator and pundit on Sky Sports darts coverage until the network sacked him in 2016 following a controversial series of tweets. In April 2018, Bristow suffered a heart attack while attending a Premier League Darts event in Liverpool and died at the age of 60.

== Early career ==
In 1957, Bristow was born in the London Borough of Hackney, but brought up at 97 Milton Grove, Stoke Newington, when Stoke Newington was a borough in its own right, where his father was a plasterer and his mother worked as a telephone operator. He left school at age 14.

Bristow won his first world championship in 1980, defeating fellow Londoner Bobby George. Bristow retained his title in 1981 and won it again in 1984, 1985 and 1986. He also suffered a shock defeat in a final during the 1980s, when the relatively unknown Keith Deller beat him in the 1983 final; he had also lost to Steve Brennan in the previous year&#x27;s first round. As well as his five world titles, Bristow also finished as runner-up on five occasions, the last in 1991.

The nickname &quot;Crafty Cockney&quot; was given to Bristow when he visited an English pub of that name in 1976 during a visit to Santa Monica, California. Bristow wore a shirt (which he received from the same pub) depicting a uniformed British policeman, a Union Flag and the title &quot;Crafty Cockney&quot; whenever he took part in a tournament.

== Achievements ==
Bristow emerged as the most successful and consistent darts player of the 1980s, reigning as number one in the world rankings during most of the period from 1980 until 1987. Television began showing increased interest in the sport in the late 1970s, with the first world championship occurring in 1978.

As well as his world championship exploits, Bristow also lifted the prestigious Winmau World Masters crown five times (1977 beating Paul Reynolds, 1979 beating Canadian Allan Hogg, 1981 beating defending champion John Lowe, 1983 beating Mike Gregory and 1984 beating Keith Deller). He also reached the final in 1989, losing to Peter Evison.

Bristow was a winner of the World Cup Singles on four occasions (1983 beating Jocky Wilson, 1985 beating Tony Payne, 1987 beating Bob Sinnaeve and 1989 beating Jack McKenna) and won the News of the World Darts Championship in 1983 beating Ralph Flatt and 1984 beating Ian Robertson (becoming only the second man in 57 years to successfully defend that title) together with countless other major tournaments including the British Open and Swedish Open three times each and the North American Open on four occasions.

==Dartitis==
During the Swedish Open in November 1986, Bristow found himself unable to let go of his darts properly – a psychological condition known as dartitis, similar to the yips in golf. He was never quite the same player again, but did regain the number-one ranking briefly in late 1989 and early 1990 before losing his form again. He reached the semi-finals of the 1997 WDC World Darts Championship at the Circus Tavern, where he narrowly lost to Phil Taylor 4–5 in sets.

==Mentoring Phil Taylor==
In the 1980s, Bristow came across Phil Taylor, then a raw young darts talent in Stoke-on-Trent, and he sponsored him with about £10,000 to fund his development in the game, on the understanding that the money would be repaid. Taylor went on to usurp his mentor as the greatest darts player ever.

==Later career and retirement==
Bristow&#x27;s form deteriorated in the early 1990s and he was dropped from the Merseyside team in 1992. Bristow had joined Merseyside, his third county, in 1988, after previously playing for London from 1976 to 1980 and for Staffordshire from 1980 to 1988. With Merseyside, Bristow played with his international teammate Kevin Kenny, and after being dropped by Merseyside, he was dropped from the England national side later the same year. The split within darts saw Bristow become a founding member of the Professional Darts Corporation.

At the World Matchplay event in Blackpool, Bristow made six appearances without winning a match. His swansong came in a classic semi-final at the 1997 PDC World Championship, which he lost to his protégé, Phil Taylor. Bristow&#x27;s last appearance came at the World Championships in 2000, ending his 23-year run of playing in a world championship, after which, he stopped playing professionally after the event.

From late December 1993, until November 2016, when he was dismissed, he worked mainly as a spotter, a pundit and an occasional commentator for Sky Sports during televised PDC tournaments, while continuing to travel and play on the exhibition circuit. Bristow returned to TV screens as a player in 2008 on Setanta Sports to compete in the BetFred League of Legends tournament, beating Bobby George 7–5 in the opening match. Bristow failed to maintain his form, however, and did not win another match in the tournament, failing to qualify for the semi-finals and finishing bottom of the League of Legends table. In 2004, Bristow played John Lowe, with Bristow showing glimpses of his old form in winning the match 6 legs to 1.

==Personal life==

Bristow was educated at Newington Green JM School before leaving for Hackney Downs Grammar School from 1968 to 1971, having passed his eleven-plus exam. He left grammar school at the age of 14.

From 1978 to 1987, Bristow was in a relationship with former darts player Maureen Flowers. In 1989, he married Jane Higginbotham (born 1962). They had two children, a daughter and a son. They divorced in 2005 after 16 years of marriage, and he was later in a relationship with Rebecca Gadd until his death.

Bristow was awarded the MBE in 1989 for his services to sport.

In 2005, Bristow was accused of assaulting his wife. North Staffordshire magistrates ordered him to stay away from the family home in Milltown Way, Leek, Staffordshire and he was remanded on conditional bail. Bristow was alleged to have punched her in the face during a drunken row in their bedroom on 29 April 2005. He was subsequently cleared of the charges.

In 2012, Bristow participated in the reality show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; He was voted out on 29 November 2012, finishing fourth out of 12 celebrities.

On 29 November 2016, Bristow was sacked by Sky Sports following a series of tweets in which he responded to the United Kingdom football sexual abuse scandal centred around the football coach and convicted child sex offender, Barry Bennell. Bristow suggested the victims should have &quot;sorted out&quot; the perpetrators when they were older. According to him, &quot;Dart players tough guys footballers wimps&quot;. Bristow was condemned by some social media users, including alleged victims of Bennell, for his comments. Bristow apologised for his comments the following day. In a statement, he compared himself to a &quot;bull in a China shop&quot; and &quot;appreciated my wording was wrong and offended many people&quot;.

==Death==
Bristow died on 5 April 2018 after a heart attack while attending a Premier League Darts event at the Echo Arena in Liverpool. Bristow had finished playing some VIPs at a promotional event and was walking back to his car when he collapsed and was rushed to hospital.

Speaking to BBC Radio 2, Bobby George said: &quot;In the afternoon, I was doing a show at a pub opposite the Premier League (darts) building, and he just came in, said &#x27;hello&#x27; and had a pint, then said &#x27;see ya&#x27;. I said &#x27;see ya&#x27; because I was working... he went across the road, and two-and-a-half hours later, he was gone.&quot;

<text>G.728 is an ITU-T standard for speech coding operating at 16 kbit/s. It is officially described as &quot;Coding of speech at 16 kbit/s using low-delay code excited linear prediction&quot;.

Technology used is LD-CELP, low-delay code excited linear prediction. Delay of the codec is only 5 samples (0.625 ms). The linear prediction is calculated backwards with a 50th order linear predictive coding filter. The excitation is generated with gain scaled VQ. The standard was finished in 1992 in the form of algorithm exact floating point code. In 1994 a bit exact fixed point codec was released. G.728 passes low bit rate modem signals up to 2400 bit/s. Also network signaling goes through. The complexity of the codec is 30 MIPS. 2 kilobytes of RAM is needed for codebooks. Mean opinion score for G.728 is 3.61.

The essence of CELP techniques, which is an analysis-by-synthesis approach to codebook search, is retained in LD-CELP. The LD-CELP however, uses backward adaptation of predictors and gain to achieve an algorithmic delay of 0.625 ms.

RealAudio 28.8 is a reduced-bitrate variant of this standard, using 15.2 kbit/s.

<text>Barbara Guest, &quot;née&quot; Barbara Ann Pinson (September 6, 1920 – February 15, 2006), was an American poet and prose stylist. Guest first gained recognition as a member of the first generation New York School of poetry. Guest wrote more than 15 books of poetry spanning sixty years of writing. In 1999, she was awarded the Frost Medal for Lifetime Achievement by the Poetry Society of America. 

Guest also wrote art criticism, essays, and plays. Her collages appeared on the covers of several of her books of poetry. She was also well known for her biography of the poet H.D., &quot;Herself Defined: The Poet H.D. and Her World&quot; (1984).

== Early, education ==
Born in Wilmington, North Carolina and raised in California, Guest attended UCLA, and then earned a B.A. in General Curriculum-Humanities in 1943 at UC Berkeley. She worked as an editorial associate at &quot;ARTnews&quot; magazine from 1951 to 1959.

== Poetry ==
Barbara Guest wrote more than 15 books of poetry spanning sixty years of writing. &quot;Her poems begin in the midst of action,&quot; wrote Peter Gizzi in his introduction to a collection of her work, &quot;but their angle of perception is oblique.&quot; Her poems are known for their abstract quality, vivid language, and intellectualism. She believed that the subject of the poem finds itself through the writing of the poem and through the poet&#x27;s imagination. &quot;Disturbing the conventional relations of subjects and objects, of reality and imagination, is one of Guest&#x27;s signature gestures,&quot; noted Gizzi.

Among her most well-known poems are &quot;Parachutes, My Love, Could Carry Us Higher,&quot; (MP3) &quot;Wild Gardens Overlooked by Night Lights, (MP3)&quot; &quot;Roses,&quot; and &quot;Photographs.&quot;

<text>Tab () is a town in Somogy County, Hungary, and the seat of Tab District. It is situated approximately 175 km South West of Budapest and 22 km from Lake Balaton.

==History==
Tab was first mentioned as &quot;villa Thob&quot; in an official document from 1211. In 1320 the settlement belonged to a church dedicated to Saint Peter. Between 1285 and 1386 it was in the hands of the &quot;Ugali&quot; family under the name &quot;Thob&quot;. Their surname had been eternalized by the medieval village of &quot;Ugajpuszta&quot; which is now part of Tab. Later the settlement belonged to &quot;István Rozgonyi&quot;, the ispán of Bakony and his wife, &quot;Cecília Szentgyörgyi&quot; between 1428 and 1435. In 1438 the Batthyány and &quot;Fajsz&quot; families owned it. Before the Turkish occupation it belonged to &quot;László Ewleweldi&quot; and &quot;Demeter Tharródy&quot;.

It was first attacked by the Turks in 1542, but it fell finally later between 1551 and 1553. Then Tab became part of the &quot;Nahiye of Törökkoppány&quot;. Most of its residents died or fled to other parts of the country, some moved into the woods and swamplands. According to the tax registration of the Ottoman Porte between 1573 and 1574 there were 12 tax payer households in Tab. There were occasionally fights between the Hungarian and Turkish forces. Ferenc Nádasdy and &quot;György Zrínyi&quot; with the papal garrisons attacked once the &quot;Agha of Törökkoppány&quot; and chased the Turks away for a short time.

After the Liberation of Buda in 1689 Tab became part of the Habsburg Empire. Several noble families (e.g. &quot;Fajszky&quot;, &quot;Mérey&quot;, &quot;Lengyel&quot;, &quot;Nyitray&quot;, &quot;Gussits&quot;, &quot;Nagy de Felsőbükk&quot;, &quot;Révay&quot; etc.) who had previously lands here reclaimed them, therefore they moved into the villages near Tab.

It is known from the census of 1715 that Tab welcomed Hungarians, Germans and Slovaks from 1712 on in larger numbers. Tab had one of largest Jewish communities in Somogy County which is also proven by the fact that one of the most prestigious synagogue of Somogy County was built here in 1762. Tab stood on none of the important national or international trade routes, but the local authorities thought that the settling of the Jewish community could have a strong impact on the economic development of the settlement. Between 1798 and 1800 with the financial help of the Diocese of Veszprém the local church was restored and expanded. Its sanctuary and the nobles&#x27; oratorio was decorated by the fresco of &quot;Franz Xaver Bucher&quot; in 1799. The church was built in Baroque style however the main and side altars as well as the pulpit and the desks were made in Rococo.

Tab became a market town in 1847. In 1871 it was classified as the seat of its district. According to the 1853 census of Somogy County the town had a population of 2,090 residents of which 973 were Hungarians (46.6%), 625 Jews (29.9%), 428 Slovaks (20.5%) and 64 Germans (3.0%).

At the end of the 19th century the town experienced a rapid development in infrastructure, trade and industry. &quot;Jakab Zuckermandel&quot; established a printhouse there. &quot;Ignác Pallós&quot; founded a steam brick and tile factory which employed the labor of Tab and the surroundings every year from autumn until spring. The first newspaper of the town started in 1909 under the name &quot;Tab és Vidéke&quot; (). In 1913 the &quot;Otthon Coffeehouse&quot; started to project movies. A credit institute was founded. The sporting association of Tab was formed in 1914.

In the First World War 754 people from Tab served as soldier. After the war the nuns of the &quot;Szociális Missziótársulat&quot; started beside religious and moral lessons for the younger and older generations also handcraft, housekeeping and nursing courses. In 1928 the &quot;Népművelő Testvérek Társasága&quot; continued their work. They established a kindergarten and a folk house. A new journal was founded under the name &quot;Népapostol&quot; in 1930 which existed until 1933. There were three primary schools: a Catholic, a Lutheran and a Jewish.

In the Second World War a huge number of Polish refugees arrived to Tab. In March 1944 a ghetto was formed for the Jewish residents of Tab. The Soviets arrived on 2 December 1944.

<doc id="1079625" wikidata="Q1484117" url="?curid=1079625" title="G.722">
<text>G.722 is an ITU-T standard 7 kHz wideband audio codec operating at 48, 56 and 64 kbit/s. It was approved by ITU-T in November 1988. Technology of the codec is based on sub-band ADPCM (SB-ADPCM). The corresponding narrow-band codec based on the same technology is G.726.

G.722 provides improved speech quality due to a wider speech bandwidth of 50–7000 Hz compared to narrowband speech coders like G.711 which in general are optimized for POTS wireline quality of 300–3400 Hz. G.722 sample audio data at a rate of 16 kHz (using 14 bits), double that of traditional telephony interfaces, which results in superior audio quality and clarity.

Other ITU-T 7 kHz wideband codecs include G.722.1 and G.722.2. These codecs are not variants of G.722 and they use different patented compression technologies. G.722.1 is based on Siren codecs and offers lower bit-rate compressions (24 kbit/s or 32 kbit/s). It uses a modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) audio coding data compression algorithm. A more recent G.722.2, also known as AMR-WB (&quot;Adaptive Multirate Wideband&quot;) is based on ACELP and offers even lower bit-rate compressions (6.6 kbit/s to 23.85 kbit/s), as well as the ability to quickly adapt to varying compressions as the network topography mutates. In the latter case, bandwidth is automatically conserved when network congestion is high. When congestion returns to a normal level, a lower-compression, higher-quality bitrate is restored.

==Applications==
G.722 is an ITU standard codec that provides 7 kHz wideband audio at data rates from 48, 56 and 64 kbit/s. This is useful for voice over IP applications, such as on a local area network where network bandwidth is readily available, and offers a significant improvement in speech quality over older narrowband codecs such as G.711, without an excessive increase in implementation complexity. Environments where bandwidth is more constrained may prefer one of the more bitrate-efficient codecs, such as G.722.1 (Siren7) or G.722.2 (AMR-WB).

G.722 has also been widely used by radio broadcasters for sending commentary-grade audio over a single 56 or 64 kbit/s ISDN B-channel (the least significant bit is dropped on 56 kb circuits).

G.722 works by having the inbound voice signal pass through a digital filter that splits the audio signal into 0 Hz-to-4 kHz and 4 kHz-to-8 kHz audio bands. These sub-bands are then encoded using sub-band ADPCM. Most of the human voice energy is concentrated in the lower half of the audio band (0–4 kHz), so 48 kbit/s of the bandwidth is dedicated to the lower sub-band and the other 16 kbit/s is allocated to the higher sub-band.

===RTP encapsulation===
G.722 VoIP is typically carried in RTP payload type 9.
Note that IANA records the clock rate for type 9 G.722 as 8 kHz (instead of 16 kHz), RFC 3551 clarifies that this is due to a historical error and is retained in order to maintain backward compatibility. Consequently, correct implementations represent the value 8,000 where required but encode and decode audio at 16 kHz.

Whilst G.722 allows for bitrates of 64, 56 and 48 kbit/s, in practice, data is encoded at 64 kbit/s, with bits from the lower sub-band being used to encode auxiliary data. The greater the number of bits allocated to aux data, the lower the bit rate.

<text>Tata (; ) is a town in Komárom-Esztergom County, northwestern Hungary, northwest of the county town Tatabánya.

==Geography==

===Location===
Tata is located in the valley between the Gerecse Mountains and Vértes Mountains, some from Budapest, the Hungarian capital city. By virtue of its location, it is a railway and road junction. Motorway M1 (E60, E75) from Vienna to Budapest passes through the outer city limits, and the railway line Budapest–Vienna goes through the city.

=== Climate ===
Tata&#x27;s climate is classified as oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;). The annual average temperature is , the hottest month in July is , and the coldest month is in January. The annual precipitation is , of which July is the wettest with , while February is the driest with only . The extreme temperature throughout the year ranged from on December 28, 1996 to on August 8, 2013.
==Demographics==
According to the 2001 census, the town has 23,937 inhabitants: 93.3% Hungarians, 1.6% Germans, 0.6% Roma, 0.2% Slovaks and 6.5% other.

==History==

The area has been inhabited since prehistoric times; archaeological findings date back to 50,000 BCE. Later it was a Roman settlement.

The first known mention of Tata is from 1221. Its name may come from the name of Lombard king Tato. Its castle was built by the Lackfi family and had its prime under Matthias Corvinus, who had it rebuilt in a Renaissance style.

In 1526 when the disastrous battle with the Turks happened and Louis II died in the battlefield, Count György Cseszneky was the castellan of the Castle Tata. The plundering Ottoman army ransacked the area, but Cseszneky successfully defended the castle.

During the Ottoman occupation, the castle of Tata was an important fortress. It was captured in 1543 by the Turks. During this period the castle had many different owners until it was burned down by the Habsburgs in retaliation for the Rákóczi&#x27;s War of Independence. 

In 1727, Count József Esterházy bought Tata and the surrounding villages. The town prospered, in 1765 it already had a secondary school.

According to the article in the Pallas Lexicon about Tata in 1851, the town was a &quot;pretty and developing village in the Tata district of Komárom comitatus; 895 buildings, 6925 mostly Hungarian residents (3633 Roman Catholics, 2518 Lutherans and 673 Israelites), centre of the district, with secondary school, railway station, post office. Tata and the adjoining village Tóváros (4257 residents) are built around a large lake, Tata on the hillside, and Tóváros on the plain. Between them, there are the Esterházy mansion and an old castle with an archive and a gallery which included a painting of Leonardo da Vinci. The theatre was built in 1889. The mansion is surrounded by the English garden (140 hectares).&quot;

In 1938, the village of Tóváros was annexed to Tata. So thus, the city was renamed &quot;Tatatóváros&quot; but only for a short while; one year later, it was named Tata again.

During World War II, Tata was captured by Soviet troops of the 2nd Ukrainian Front on 19 March 1945 during the course of the Vienna Offensive. 

Tata was granted town status in 1954.

<text>G.722.1 is a licensed royalty-free ITU-T standard audio codec providing high quality, moderate bit rate (24 and 32 kbit/s) wideband (50 Hz – 7 kHz audio bandwidth, 16 ksps (kilo-samples per second) audio coding. It is a partial implementation of Siren 7 audio coding format (which offers bit rates 16, 24, 32 kbit/s) developed by PictureTel Corp. (now Polycom, Inc.). Its official name is &quot;Low-complexity coding at 24 and 32 kbit/s for hands-free operation in systems with low frame loss&quot;. It uses a modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) audio data compression algorithm.

G.722.1 Annex C (or G.722.1C) is a low-complexity extension mode to G.722.1, which doubles the algorithm to permit 14 kHz audio bandwidth using a 32 kHz audio sample rate, at 24, 32, and 48 kbit/s. It is included in the official ITU-T Recommendation G.722.1. The name of this annex is &quot;Annex C – 14 kHz mode at 24, 32, and 48 kbit/s&quot;. It is an implementation of the mono version of Polycom&#x27;s Siren 14 audio coding format.

G.722.1 is the successor to PT716plus developed by PictureTel Corp. (now Polycom, Inc.), which has been used in videoconferencing systems for many years. As ITU-T Recommendation G.722.1, it was approved on September 30, 1999 after a four-year selection process involving extensive testing. G.722.1/Annex C was approved by ITU-T on May 14, 2005.

G.722.1 is a transform-based compressor that is optimized for both speech and music. The G.722.1 algorithm is based on lapped transform technology, using a Modulated Lapped Transform (MLT), a type of MDCT. The computational complexity is quite low (5.5 floating-point MIPS) for an efficient high-quality compressor, and the algorithmic delay end-to-end is 40 ms.

The numbering of the wideband ITU audio codecs is sometimes confusing. There are three principal codecs, which are unrelated, but all carrying the G.722 label. G.722 is the original 7 kHz codec, using ADPCM and operating at 48–64 kbit/s. G.722.1, another 7 kHz codec, operates at half the data rate while delivering comparable or better quality than G.722, but is a transform-based codec. G.722.1 Annex C is very similar to G.722.1, but provides twice the audio bandwidth, 14 kHz. And G.722.2, which operates on wideband speech and delivers very low bitrates, is an ACELP-based algorithm.

== Licensing ==
G.722.1 is available under a royalty-free license by Polycom Corporation, who owns all rights. Licensees also receive the right to use Polycom&#x27;s 16 kbit/s decoder extension of G.722.1, as well as G.722.1 Annex C, and Polycom&#x27;s IP within the new 20 kHz ITU fullband codec, G.719.

<doc id="1079634" wikidata="Q1283233" url="?curid=1079634" title="G.726">
<text>G.726 is an ITU-T ADPCM speech codec standard covering the transmission of voice at rates of 16, 24, 32, and 40 kbit/s. It was introduced to supersede both G.721, which covered ADPCM at 32 kbit/s, and G.723, which described ADPCM for 24 and 40 kbit/s. G.726 also introduced a new 16 kbit/s rate. The four bit rates associated with G.726 are often referred to by the bit size of a sample, which are 2, 3, 4, and 5-bits respectively. The corresponding wide-band codec based on the same technology is G.722.

The most commonly used mode is 32 kbit/s, which doubles the usable network capacity by using half the rate of G.711. It is primarily used on international trunks in the phone network and is the standard codec used in DECT wireless phone systems. The principal application of 24 and 16 kbit/s channels is for overload channels carrying voice in digital circuit multiplication equipment (DCME). The principal application of 40 kbit/s channels is to carry data modem signals in DCME, especially for modems operating at greater than 4800 bit/s.

==History==
G.721 was introduced in 1984, while G.723 was introduced in 1988. They were folded into G.726 in 1990.

G.727 was introduced at the same time as G.726, and includes the same bit rates, but is optimized for packet circuit multiplex equipment (PCME) environment. This is achieved by embedding 2-bit quantizer to 3-bit quantizer and same for the higher modes. This allows dropping of the least significant bit from the bit stream without adverse effects on speech signal.

==Features==
*Sampling frequency 8 kHz
*16 kbit/s, 24 kbit/s, 32 kbit/s, 40 kbit/s bit rates available
*Generates a bitstream, therefore frame length is determined by packetization time (typically 80 samples for 10 ms frame size)
*Typical algorithmic delay is 0.125 ms, with no look-ahead delay
*G.726 is a waveform speech coder which uses Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM)
*PSQM testing under ideal conditions yields mean opinion scores of 4.30 for G.726 (32 kbit/s), compared to 4.45 for G.711 (μ-law)
*PSQM testing under network stress yields mean opinion scores of 3.79 for G.726 (32 kbit/s), compared to 4.13 for G.711 (μ-law)
* 40 kbit/s G.726 can carry 12000 bit/s and slower modem signals, while 32 kbit/s G.726 can carry 2400 bit/s and slower modem signals well and 4800 bit/s with some more degradation than clear channel codecs.

==Endianness and payload type==
Since the byte order for data protocols in the context of the internet was generally defined as big endian and called simply &quot;network byte order&quot;, as stated (among others) by the deprecated RFC 1700, the deprecated RFC 1890 did not explicitly define the endianness of the predecessor of G.726, G.721, in RTP either. Instead of that, in the deprecated RFC 1890, the use of big endian by the term network byte order was generally stated for all mentioned codecs again:
The payload type for G.721 was defined by the deprecated RFC 1890 as &quot;2&quot;, thus codice_1. In drafts for newer version of this RFC, it was reused for G.726, i.e. codice_2.

Contrary to that the ITU explicitly defined the byte order in its recommendations regarding G.726 or respectively ADPCM, but in two different ways. Recommendation &quot;X.420&quot; states, that it shall be little endian, respecting recommendation &quot;I.366.2 Annex E&quot; it should be big endian. This led to contradicting decisions in various implementations, as some manufacturers opted for little endian and others for big endian. The consequence was, that these implementations were incompatible, as decoding using the wrong byte order results in a heavily distorted audio signal. Therefore the unclear definition was fixed by the RFC 3551, which replaces RFC 1890. Section 4.5.4 in RFC 3551 defines the classical MIME-types G726-16, 24, 32 and 40 as little endian and introduces new MIME types for big endian, which are AAL2-G726-16, 24, 32 and 40. The payload type was changed to dynamic, in order to prevent confusion. Instead of payload type &quot;2&quot; a dynamic payload in the range from 96 to 127 shall be used: 


Newer implementations respect the RFC 3551 and clearly distinct between G726-xx (little endian) and AAL2-G726-xx (big endian). The Gigaset C610 IP DECT phone, e.g., generates the following code in its SIP INVITE:

codice_3 → dynamic payload type &quot;96&quot; and G.726 according to X.420, thus little endian, as defined in RFC 3551&lt;br&gt;
codice_4 → dynamic payload type &quot;97&quot; and G.726 according to I.366.2 Annex E, thus big endian, as defined in RFC 3551&lt;br&gt;
codice_2 → static payload type &quot;2&quot; and G.726 with unpredictable endianness, like G.721 according to the deprecated RFC 1890

<doc id="1079635" wikidata="Q1464314" url="?curid=1079635" title="Parliament House, Melbourne">
<text>Parliament House is the meeting place of the Parliament of Victoria, one of the eight parliaments of the Australian states and territories.

Located on Spring Street on the edge of the Hoddle Grid, the grand colonnaded front dominates the vista up Bourke Street. Construction began in 1855, and the first stage was officially opened the following year, with various sections completed over the following decades; it has never been completed, and the planned dome is one of the most well known unbuilt features of Melbourne. Between 1901 and 1927, it served as the meeting place of the Parliament of Australia, during the period when Melbourne was the temporary national capital. The building is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

==Background==

=== Site ===
The Victorian gold rush and population boom led calls for greater democracy and a home for political debate in Victoria. Prior to the Colony of Victoria acquiring self-government in 1851, Governor Charles La Trobe instructed Surveyor General Robert Hoddle to select a site for the colony&#x27;s new parliament to meet. Hoddle selected a site on the eastern hill at the top of Bourke Street, which commanded a view over the entire city. It was not until April 1854 that Eastern Hill, the current Spring Street site, was formally agreed to due to ongoing disagreements over the best location.

=== Design ===
The exact sequence of events is unclear, with a number of architects and designs chosen and rejected in succession, with the final result possibly based on earlier work. The first design appeared as early as 1851 by then Colonial Architect Henry Ginn; however, the Legislative Council then decided to have a competition in 1853, which Ginn took as a slight and resigned. A design by Smith &amp; Pritchard won first prize, but this was soon set aside as well. The Colony&#x27;s newly arrived Chief Engineer (from Nov 1855 Commissioner of Public Works) Captain Pasley was asked to prepare a design by April 1854, possibly for a unicameral building, which may have been soon reworked into one for a bi-cameral Parliament, which had just been decided upon. A design was published in c1854 showing a restrained Palladian building much like the then recently started State Library of Victoria; this design was credited to Knight &amp; Kerr &quot;under the general directions of Captain Pasley&quot;. John Knight and Peter Kerr had just formed a partnership, and Knight may possibly still have been an architect within the Public Works Department at this time, while also practicing privately. This design was also apparently deemed unsuitable, and Knight &amp; Kerr were employed separately to create a much grander design by 1855, which was perhaps mainly a reworking of the 1854 design. This design is extraordinarily impressive and elaborate for a fledgling colony, albeit one flush with the results of the recent gold rush. It featured a columned screen on at least three sides, with end and central bays set forward, statuary atop the cornice, grand stairs, and a tall multi-stage columned and domed tower. Images of this design were also published, and photographs exist of a model of the scheme. Knight &amp; Kerr are credited with the design of the first stages of Parliament House when construction commenced in 1855.

== Construction and completion ==

=== Chambers: 1855–1856 ===

It was decided to construct the building in stages, owing to its vast size and cost, so construction began in December 1855 on only the two chambers, one for the Victorian Legislative Assembly and a smaller more ornate chamber for the Victorian Legislative Council. Construction progressed rapidly and on 25 November 1856, the first session of the Victorian Government in the new chambers was opened, to great acclaim.

=== Library and Eastern Wing: 1858–1860 ===

Construction of the Library and eastern wing began in 1858 and was completed in 1860. There was much debate about an appropriate stone for the exterior, with a desire to use stone from Victoria, though none could be found that were known to be entirely suitable. Bluestone was rejected as too dark and sombre, local granite as too expensive, even Carrara marble was considered, but freestone from Bacchus Marsh was chosen. This proved to decay rapidly and large parts had to be replaced with stone from Tasmania within a few years. With the library complete, the two legislative chambers were joined at the rear, resulting in a `U-shaped&#x27; building. The classical architectural detail of the east facade were noted as the first expression of Peter Kerr&#x27;s vision for the building. No further construction took place for 18 years; however, the first set of electrical bells used to call members to divisions were installed circa 1877.

=== Queen&#x27;s Hall, Vestibule and Proposed Dome: 1879–1882 ===

In 1876 a Royal Commission was formed to recommend the next steps. It tabled several changes, including the addition of a large dome, and the appointment of Peter Kerr as leading architect, and a resumption of construction. Kerr produced new plans for the completion of the building in 1877, replacing the tower with a dome, and replacing the complex external architecture with a simpler design dominated by a long colonnade. This is the design that is widely known and referred to as the &#x27;original&#x27; design.

Though a radical simplification of the 1855 design, the main facade bears a strong similarity to Leeds Town Hall, designed 1853, and completed 1858, which is somewhat smaller and less elaborate. The dome however is quite different to Leeds’ square columned tower, which is however similar to the 1855 Melbourne tower, designed about the time a tower was added to the Leeds Town Hall design.

The Great Hall (renamed Queen&#x27;s Hall in 1887) and vestibule were completed in 1879, with the Commission continuing to produce reports on the progress. Their report of 1878 noted the progress on the construction of the Queens Hall and Vestibule (up to the base of the proposed dome), and that there was still no agreement on a suitable stone for the exterior.

Queen&#x27;s Hall was used for formal receptions and banquets, while the Vestibule offered a formal entry to Parliament House, though the grand front steps were not to be completed for another decade.

=== West Front and Stairs 1881–1891 ===

Planning for the construction of the grand classical colonnaded front of the building facing Bourke Street as envisaged in the 1877 plan was to follow on immediately after the completion of the previous section, but construction was delayed by the ongoing desire to find a suitable Victorian stone for the exterior. Work in interiors progressed, with the imported Minton tiled floor of the Vestibule laid in 1888, spelling out a quote from Proverbs 11:14: &quot;Where no Counsel is the People Fall; but in the Multitude of Counsellors there is Safety&quot;. Eventually sandstone from Mt Difficult in the Grampians National Park was decided upon, and a quarry was opened up. The colonnade with the grand front entry stairs was completed in 1889, and final interior decoration was completed in 1890. Final elements like the ornate wrought-iron fence around the grounds and the elaborate cast-iron lamps and the bronze lions of the entry stairs were completed over the next year. A contract for the north wing was let in 1890, with the dome to follow, but the boom years of the 1880s were over, and the subsequent economic depression of the 1890s meant no further work was started.

=== Refreshment Rooms 1927–1929 ===

After the Federal Parliament relocated to Canberra in 1927, the Federal Government paid for the last major addition, the refreshment rooms occupying the northeast corner. The exterior followed the 1877 design, and it was completed in 1929.

== Temporary home of Federal Parliament ==
From 1901 to 1927, Parliament House was the first home of the Commonwealth of Australia&#x27;s Federal Government, since the new capital city envisaged in the Australian Constitution did not yet exist and there were long delays in finding a site and commencing construction. During these years the Victorian Parliament met in the Royal Exhibition Building in Carlton.

Many of the major events of the early federal period took place in this building, including the formation of the Federal Parliamentary Australian Labor Party, the &quot;fusion&quot; of the Free Trade Party and the Protectionist Party into the first Liberal Party in 1909, the declaration of the Great War in 1914, and the split in the Labor Party over conscription in 1916.

==Modern use and developments==
The building resumed its original use as the Victorian Parliament chambers in 1928. Parliament House was then listed on the Victorian Heritage Register in 1982 and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2005–6.

Several modern governments have expressed interest in completing Pasley and Kerr&#x27;s original design by constructing the dome but were deterred by the substantial cost. Notably, the 1992 Kennett government established a committee to examine building the dome. Kennett and the then Opposition Leader John Brumby reached an agreement in 1996 for the building to be completed by the turn of the century. The idea was then abandoned by Kennett when he learned the original site of the sandstone mined for the building, now within Grampians National Park, could not be re-mined.

From 2016 to 2018, a $40 million two-storey office building was constructed in the gardens of Parliament House for MPs&#x27; use. The building is embedded into the landscape to specifically reduce its impact on Parliament House and other nearby buildings. The new building is called the Members Annexe and contains 102 offices for members of the Parliament of Victoria. The building was designed by Peter Elliott Architecture and Urban Design. The annexe is deliberately sunk to preserve the view of Parliament House. Its pincer shape ensures quick access for members to return to the legislative chambers within four minutes when votes are called.

The stairs on the west front of Parliament House are frequently used by protestors and activists to draw attention to contentious issues. Notable protests that used the stairs as a gathering point and podium for speeches include the 2020 Black Lives Matter protest and several anti-lockdown protests during the COVID-19 pandemic, While individuals or groups are not required to obtain permission from the City of Melbourne to hold a protest on the stairs of Parliament House, the City of Melbourne encourages notifying Victoria Police of planned activities in advance.

<text>Tura is a town in Pest County, Hungary. In 2001 Tura became a city.

==Geography==
Tura lies between the Great Plain and Mátra Hills, in the Galga Valley.

==Communications==
The Bagi Junction of the M3 motorway and primary route 32 (from Jászfényszarú) serve the town.

Express and stopping trains of the Hungarian State Railways serve the town on the Budapest—Hatvan—Miskolc line.

Around the end of the 19th and start of the 20th centuries the MÁV (Hungarian State Railways) employed more and more people in Tura and it became a railway town.

==History==
The first mention of Tura is as in a charter () of 1220. At that time the Ákos family owned the town. In 1425 one of the family&#x27;s descendants, Miklós Ördög Prodavizi, gave the estate to King Sigismund () in exchange for other properties.

A charter of 1523 mentions that the settlement levied its own taxation. In 1544, after the capture of Buda by the Ottoman Empire three years earlier, Tura came under Turkish rule. The town was never emptied and its church survived that period. Even though in 1594 Simon Forgách won in battle against the Turkish army, the Turkish still ruled Tura for centuries more. In 1633–34 the settlement was mentioned as a Turkish town with two taxable lands. At the end of Turkish rule there were only 61 families in the town.

In the 18th century Tura&#x27;s population started to grow because of agriculture. Trade improved and people sold their goods in the Buda, Pest, Miskolc, Hatvan, Vác and Gyöngyös markets. In 1740 Tura was Antal Hévizi Nagy’s land and it became a duty-free town. At that time there were 59 taxable houses.

Until 1873 Tura was owned by the Esterházy family, but they sold it to Baron Sigismund Schossberger. On 20 July 1849 one of the biggest battles of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 took place in Tura, between Mór Perczel&#x27;s and Alexander Petrovich Tolstoy’s troops. In 1910 there were 900 houses and 4759 inhabitants.

==Economy==
Tura had a leading role in agriculture. In the (Lower Galga) animal breeding and fruit cultivation was significant. Collective farming started in 1949. Later on, industrialisation started to improve too. At one time there were 200 employees. In the 1990s the collective farms started to be privatised and new owners rented them out.

The main industries are vegetable and flower cultivation and the Galga-Coop plc sells the goods at the local market or in Budapest.

In April 2024, the Hungarian oil company MOL found new crude oil deposits near the town.

==Tura in folk art==
Tura is famous for its folk songs and needlework. Béla Bartók the composer collected more than 150 folk songs in Tura in 1906. His name is on the wall of the Tura Community Centre. The famous embroidery of Tura boasts a long history and was particularly popular after the Second World War, when many clothing designers began using it in their work.

<doc id="1079639" wikidata="Q239076" url="?curid=1079639" title="Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)">
<text>&quot;Closer&quot; is a song by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released as the second single on their second studio album, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; (1994). Released in May 1994, it is considered one of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; signature songs and remains their most popular song. Most versions of the single are titled &quot;Closer to God&quot;, a rare example in music of a single&#x27;s title differing from the title of its A-side (&quot;Closer to God&quot; is also the title of an alternate version of &quot;Closer&quot; featured on the single, which was also released as a separate promotional single for club-play). The single is the ninth official Nine Inch Nails release, making it &quot;Halo 9&quot; in the band&#x27;s official Halo numbering system.

A promotional single provided by the label to radio stations included both long and short vocal-censored (i.e. silenced profanity) versions. Although the song addresses themes such as self-hatred and obsession, its sexually aggressive chorus led to widespread misinterpretation of the song as an anthem of lust, which helped it become Nine Inch Nails&#x27; most successful single up to that time and cemented Trent Reznor&#x27;s status as an industrial rock icon. Commercially, &quot;Closer&quot; reached 41 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 25 on the UK Singles Chart, and No. 3 on the Australian Singles Chart. Censored versions of the song and its Mark Romanek-directed music video received substantial airplay on radio and MTV.

==Composition==
&quot;Closer&quot; has been described as industrial rock and alternative rock. &quot;Closer&quot; uses elements of funk, and electronic music. The drum track of &quot;Closer&quot; is built around a heavily modified sample of the bass drum from the 1977 Iggy Pop song &quot;Nightclubbing&quot;, which was performed by a Roland drum machine. The samples were produced using two Akai S1100 samplers, each with an expander, essentially making up four samplers. The samples were then combined with beats produced by a Roland R-70 drum machine. The production features sound effects such as a bass squelch, synth echo, and feedback growl. Radio edits of &quot;Closer&quot; were created by muting the vocal track for the duration of each deleted obscenity.

Lyrically, &quot;Closer&quot; is a song about self-hatred and obsession; to Reznor&#x27;s dismay, the song was widely misinterpreted as a lust anthem due to its chorus, which famously includes the lines &quot;I wanna fuck you like an animal / I wanna feel you from the inside&quot;. In 2003, VH1 ranked the song at No. 93 in its countdown of the &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years.&quot; The song was ranked at No. 2 on AOL&#x27;s &quot;69 Sexiest Songs of All Time&quot; due to the explicit frankness of the chorus. Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, said of the song, &quot;Come on dude: &#x27;I wanna fuck you like an animal&#x27;? That&#x27;s the all-time fuck song. Those are pure fuck beats—Trent Reznor knew what he was doing. You can fuck to it, you can dance to it and you can break shit to it.&quot;

Although there were numerous remixes of &quot;Closer&quot;, the version titled &quot;Closer to God&quot; was heavily reworked, as the vocals were completely re-recorded and the overall song retained only a few elements from the original version. &quot;Closer to God&quot; was also released as a promotional single separate from &quot;Closer&quot;, mainly intended for club-play.

==Reception==
&quot;Closer&quot; had some radio airplay before it was released as a single. This factor increased within weeks, leading Interscope to release the song as a single in May 1994. When it premiered, the single charted on several US &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine music listings. Debuting near the bottom spot of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, it barely missed the top 40, peaking at No. 41. It climbed to No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, and also went on to reach No. 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart and No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart. &quot;Closer&quot; was the band&#x27;s first crossover hit and remains their most popular song to date.

The single was successful in several other countries as well. It charted the highest in Australia, where it rose to No. 3 on the week of November 13, 1994, and was the country&#x27;s 87th most successful single of 1994. Although &quot;Closer&quot; did not initially appear on Canada&#x27;s official music chart during its original release, it reached a peak of No. 5 on the Canadian Singles Chart in February 2002. It also did not chart in Denmark until 2007, when it reached No. 12 in July. In the United Kingdom, the single reached No. 25.

The aforementioned &quot;Closer to God&quot; version of the song charted at No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Music/Club Play Singles.

The song was voted in at No. 62 on Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 of all time in 2009, and ranked No. 42 on Pitchfork Media&#x27;s &quot;Top 200 Tracks of the 90s&quot; in 2010. In 2021, it was listed at No. 270 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Kerrang&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the song number five and number one, respectively, on their lists of the greatest Nine Inch Nails songs.

==Music video==

The music video was directed by Mark Romanek and first aired on May 12, 1994, having been filmed in April of that year. It was cut down from its original length to 4:36. Several sections of the video were shot inside the then-abandoned Linda Vista Community Hospital in Los Angeles. The video was popular and helped bolster the success of the band. Set in what appears to be a 19th-century mad scientist&#x27;s laboratory, the video&#x27;s imagery involves religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror, including:
* A heart connected to some sort of device; the beat of the heart corresponds to the beat of the song
* A little girl lounging on a chair 
* A nude, bald woman with a crucifix mask
* A monkey, scared, panicked, tied to a cross with a picture of Jack Nicholson (photograph taken by David Bailey) on the right.
* A severed pig&#x27;s head spinning on some type of machine.
* A diagram of the vulva/vagina.
* Reznor wearing various fetish gear, such as an S&amp;M mask, ball gag, and long leather gloves while swinging in shackles.
Several times, Reznor, wearing leather pants, floats and rotates through the air, suspended by invisible wires. There are also scenes of Reznor being blown back by a wind machine while wearing aviator goggles. Romanek has stated: 
These images were inspired by the work of Joel-Peter Witkin, as well as by the Brothers Quay&#x27;s animated short film &quot;Street of Crocodiles&quot;. Other artworks visually referenced in the video include Man Ray&#x27;s &quot;Object to Be Destroyed,&quot; Francis Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Figure with Meat&quot;, and photos by James Van Der Zee. For the television version, certain removed scenes were replaced with a title card that read &quot;Scene Missing,&quot; and the instances of the word &quot;fuck&quot; being edited out were accompanied by a stop in the video motion, making it appear as if the stop was a result of defective film (this was supposedly done to make sure the flow of the song was not affected). According to Romanek, the video was filmed using &quot;a slightly out of date film stock but it was still a contemporary film stock.&quot;

The unedited version of the video was shown on Playboy TV&#x27;s music video show &quot;Hot Rocks&quot; in 1994. In mid-2002, the unedited version aired on MTV2 as part of a special countdown showcasing the most controversial videos ever to air on MTV. This countdown was only shown late at night due to the sexually explicit imagery of &quot;Closer&quot; and several other videos.

In 2006, &quot;Closer&quot; was voted No. 1 in a VH1 Classic poll, &quot;20 Greatest Music Videos of All Time.&quot;

In retrospect, Reznor said of the video that &quot;The rarest of things occurred: where the song sounded better to me, seeing it with the video. And it&#x27;s &quot;my&quot; song.&quot;

The unedited video is included in &quot;Closure&quot;, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; (DualDisc), &quot;Directors Label Volume 4: The Work Of Director Mark Romanek&quot; and Vevo, and it is available for download from the United States iTunes Store under the band&#x27;s page. Behind-the-scenes footage with commentary by Romanek is included in &quot;Closure&quot; (DVD) and &quot;Directors Label&quot;. It is also available on YouTube, and was previously flagged there before this restriction was lifted.

==Live performances==
During the Self Destruct and Fragility tours, bassist Danny Lohner and guitarist Robin Finck joined Reznor and full-time keyboardists James Woolley (during the first half of the Self Destruct Tour) and Charlie Clouser (during the remaining tours) on keyboards for the song, with Reznor performing an extended synth solo. Nine Inch Nails performed the &quot;Closer to God&quot; rendition of the song live during their 1995 tour on numerous occasions, omitting the original song from the setlist when done so.

There are performance videos of &quot;Closer&quot; on &quot;And All that Could Have Been&quot; and &quot;Beside You in Time&quot;.

In the tours following the release of &quot;With Teeth&quot;, Nine Inch Nails performed a shorter version of &quot;Closer&quot; with the keyboard solo played as a guitar solo and a breakdown incorporating a portion of &quot;The Only Time,&quot; a track from &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;. Two performances of this version of the song appear on &quot;Beside You in Time&quot;.

==Formats and track listings==
The version of &quot;Closer&quot; on the single is 13 seconds longer than the album version; on the album, the piano tune at the end of the song is abruptly cut off in order to segue into the next track, &quot;Ruiner&quot;. On the single, the piano and background sounds of &quot;Closer&quot; are allowed to play out longer.

In addition, the U.S. CD single contains five guest remixes of &quot;Closer&quot;, a remix of its fellow &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot; track &quot;Heresy&quot;, an instrumental track &quot;March of the Fuckheads&quot; (unrelated to &quot;March of the Pigs&quot;), and a cover version of Soft Cell&#x27;s song &quot;Memorabilia&quot;, from their 1982 EP &quot;Non Stop Ecstatic Dancing&quot;. The UK single releases contain the same tracks split between two discs (each sold separately). A cassette single was issued in the U.S. and Australia, pairing &quot;Closer&quot; with the music video version of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; previous single, &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; (which was recorded live in the studio by the then-current lineup of the band).

The single&#x27;s cover artwork was done by photographer Joseph Cultice.

==Release history==
==Cover versions==
* &quot;Closer&quot; has been covered by many musical acts, including MGMT, Blood on the Dance Floor, Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine, Eric Gorfain, Maroon 5, Maxwell, The Asylum Street Spankers, Asking Alexandria, Rosetta Stone, In This Moment and Japanese Voyeurs.
* Thirty Seconds to Mars uses samples from &quot;Closer&quot; when they perform &quot;The Fantasy&quot;.
* &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic has paid tribute to &quot;Closer&quot; twice: in &quot;The Alternative Polka&quot; on his album &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot;, a section of the song was used in which the word &quot;fuck&quot; is replaced with a cartoon sound effect. &quot;Germs&quot; on his &quot;Running with Scissors&quot; album is a style parody of several Nine Inch Nails songs.
* The Asylum Street Spankers occasionally perform a bluegrass version, available at the Live Music Archive.
* In 1995, the Australian novelty act Nine Inch Richards covered the song under the title &quot;Closer to Hogs&quot;. Sung in a southern drawl, it combined Trent Reznor&#x27;s sexually charged lyrics with barnyard animal samples, humorously implying that the song is about bestiality. A video clip of the parody was taken at the Sydney Royal Easter Show. This single peaked at No. 51 in Australia.
* In 2008, Sy Smith performed the song as part of her &quot;Conflict Tour&quot;. In August 2010, Smith performed the song again at &quot;Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Heights Plaza&quot;.
* In 2014, from the compilation album in the &quot;Punk Goes 90&#x27;s 2&quot; has been covered by British rock Asking Alexandria.
* In 2016, singer-songwriter Father John Misty covered the song live in Chicago during two separate performances.
* Fellow Interscope act Limp Bizkit parodied &quot;Closer&quot; (as well &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; and &quot;Burn&quot;) in their song &quot;Hot Dog&quot;. The chorus goes, &quot;You wanna fuck me like an animal, You&#x27;d like to burn me on the inside, You like to think that I&#x27;m a perfect drug, Just know that nothing you do will bring you closer to me.&quot; Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said he was a big fan of Nine Inch Nails, who has additionally inspired his music.

<doc id="1079641" wikidata="Q1418489" url="?curid=1079641" title="Snuff (British band)">
<text>Snuff are a British punk rock band formed in Hendon in 1986. The original line-up was Duncan Redmonds on drums and vocals, Simon Wells on guitar and vocals and Andy Crighton on bass, with Dave Redmonds being added to the line-up on trombone before the release of &quot;Flibbiddydibbiddydob&quot;.

Snuff have released their material through a variety of independent record labels including their own, 10past12records, as well as on Fat Wreck Chords, a label owned by Fat Mike of NOFX.

==History==
The band signed to the Workers Playtime label and their first release was the &quot;Not Listening Anymore&quot; EP, which received regular airplay from BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, and reached number nine in the UK Independent Chart. Their first album was named &quot;Snuff Said&quot;, but the full album name was &quot;Snuffsaidbutgorblimeyguvstonemeifhedidn&#x27;tthrowawobblerchachachachachachachachachachachayou&#x27;regoinghomeinacosmicambience&quot;, which started their habit of playing on their supposed Cockney roots. The album peaked at number three on the UK Indie Chart.

Following up from their first album was the &#x27;mini-album&#x27; &quot;Flibbiddydibbiddydob&quot;, featuring mainly cover versions and TV commercial jingles reworked by the band. The release was the subject of a disagreement with the British Phonographic Industry (BPI); Snuff maintained it was an EP, and as such should be eligible for the UK Singles Chart, but the BPI insisted on classifying it as an album because of the large number of tracks.

In 1991, Snuff split up. During this period all three members applied to be the bassist for Leatherface. The break-up also spawned Guns n&#x27; Wankers and Your Mum in &#x27;93–&#x27;94 and whose lineup included Simon Wells, Loz Wong, Rory Blaney, Paul McMahon and Tony Poole.

Following a reformation of the original line-up in 1994, along with permanent Hammond and trombone, Simon Wells left the band and was replaced by Loz Wong who had played in Guns n&#x27; Wankers with Simon. A while later Andy Crighton was replaced by Lee Erinmez (née Batsford) on bass. They released a Christmas single, the theme to &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot;. Steve Lamacq has also featured Snuff on his radio show. Simon Wells has since formed the band Southport, and has played occasionally with Duncan under the name &quot;Footballer&#x27;s Wives&quot;.

In 2005, Snuff released a greatest hits double album. Also in 2005, Duncan Redmonds released a self-titled solo project CD, &quot;Billy No Mates&quot;, and at live shows his solo material is combined with some Snuff and Guns n&#x27; Wankers songs. Billy No Mates have two touring bands, one in Japan and one in the UK, and Redmonds has recorded different EP&#x27;s with each band.

In 2006 a new band called Pot Kettle Black formed. This featured Redmonds on drums, Wells on guitar, and Wes Wasley completing the trio on bass. The line-up played a mixture of old Snuff songs (generally up until &quot;Demmamussabebonk&quot;) and new material in the same vein. The project was pronounced &#x27;dead&#x27; by Redmonds on the 10past12 Records website guestbook in August 2007. Since then, Redmonds has played a series of gigs in Japan with Duncan&#x27;s Divas, and embarked on solo acoustic gigs in the UK.

In 2008, a brief tour of Japan was announced, featuring gigs in Tokyo. Following this, the band continued to gig in 2009, supporting NOFX in Birmingham and London on their UK tour, and played both the Reading and Leeds Festivals.

===&quot;Bubble and Squeak&quot;===
In 2009, Duncan Redmonds released &quot;Bubble and Squeak&quot;. The album featured collaborations with numerous members of bands on similar labels or tours, including Fat Mike from NOFX, Frankie Stubbs from Leatherface and Ken Yokoyama from the Japanese punk band Hi-Standard, as well as former and current members of Snuff, Billy No Mates and Pot Kettle Black. Notably, the album also included a new track recorded by Guns n&#x27; Wankers, the first since bassist Jools Parkin suffered a brain haemorrhage.

===&quot;Don&#x27;t Wake Up the Kids&quot;===
In March 2010, an album titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Wake Up The Kids&quot;, which featured acoustic tracks recorded by Duncan Redmonds, Joey Cape of Lagwagon and Ken Yokoyama of Hi-Standard, was released on Inyaface Records. To coincide with the release of the album, Duncan Redmonds and Joey Cape toured Japan, playing a series of acoustic shows.

===2011 to present===
The band undertook another short tour of Japan in 2011, as well as the recording and release of a tour EP, entitled &quot;5-4-3-2-1 Ding-a-Ling Yahon&quot;, which consisted of new songs and Japanese covers.
In spring 2012, the band took to the road for a 10-date UK tour, with Oliver Stewart taking over trombone duties from Dave Redmonds. Shows included The Borderline, London, and Trillians, Newcastle. Snuff also appeared at the 2012 Rebellion festival, in Blackpool, alongside bands such as Rancid and SNFU, as well as being lead support for the summer 2012 NOFX UK tour.

In 2012, Snuff recorded their first full-length album since 2003&#x27;s &quot;Disposable Income&quot;. The album, titled &quot;5-4-3-2-1 Perhaps?&quot;, contains 12 new tracks and was released on 8 January 2013. The vinyl was released in black vinyl, limited edition purple vinyl with green haze (407 copies) and even more limited green vinyl with Fat Record Store labels (100 copies). The album also came as a CD version along with a Japanese issue with exclusive artwork.

In August 2015, Snuff completed a full UK tour supporting Bad Religion. In February 2016, they celebrated &#x27;30 Years of Snuff&#x27; with a full UK tour.

In September 2019, Snuff released a new album, &quot;There&#x27;s A Lot of It About,&quot; on Fat Wreck Chords, recorded in 2018. Lee Erinmez left the band shortly after the recording and was replaced by Dan Goatham. In May 2020, Snuff released a new EP, &quot;The Wrath of Thoth&quot;.

In 2021, Snuff began recording a brand new album with a small run of UK dates. This marks the return of Dave Redmonds on trombone, with his daughter Flo Redmonds adding saxophone and giving the band a three-part brass section.

In 2022, Snuff announced a new 10-track album, &quot;Crepuscolo dorato della bruschetta borsetta calzetta cacchetta trombetta lambretta giallo ossido, ooooooh cosi magnifico!&quot;.

<text>Bergstrand is a lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon. It is located just to the southeast of the prominent crater Aitken, and northeast of the walled plain Vertregt.

The rim of Bergstrand is roughly circular, except along the southwest where the larger satellite crater Bergstrand Q intrudes into the outer wall. With one small craterlet covering the southern rim, Bergstrand&#x27;s outer wall is otherwise only slightly worn. There are a few small craterlets on the mostly flat interior floor.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bergstrand.

<doc id="1079651" wikidata="Q5533401" url="?curid=1079651" title="Geno's Steaks">
<text>Geno&#x27;s Steaks is a Philadelphia restaurant specializing in cheesesteaks, founded in 1966 by Joey Vento. Geno&#x27;s is located in South Philadelphia at the intersection of 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue, directly across the street from rival Pat&#x27;s King of Steaks, which is generally credited with having invented the cheesesteak in 1933. The cheesesteak has since become a signature dish for Philadelphia. 

After Joey Vento&#x27;s death in 2011, restaurant ownership was passed to his son Geno Vento.

The restaurant is known for its distinctive appearance, featuring hundreds of bright neon lights and signs that illuminate the corner of 9th and Passyunk. The establishment operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and serves an estimated 30,000 sandwiches per month.

Under Geno Vento&#x27;s leadership, the restaurant underwent a significant renovation in 2016, its first major update in 50 years. The renovation included expanded outdoor seating, updated ordering windows, and new interior designs while maintaining the iconic exterior appearance. The restaurant has been featured in numerous television shows, including appearances on The Tonight Show, Food Network, and Travel Channel programs.

Like its rival Pat&#x27;s, Geno&#x27;s is known for its specific ordering procedure, where customers are expected to order quickly and with precise terminology: specifying the type of cheese (including &quot;wit&quot; or &quot;witout&quot; onions) and following a particular sequence.

==History==
===20th century===

Owner Joey Vento started a small grill venue at 9th and Passyunk in 1966 and over time his business gained praise from locals. Joey had a son in 1971 and named him Geno, who from 17 on, worked in his father&#x27;s business.

According to Vento, the name &#x27;Geno&#x27;s&#x27; was chosen because &#x27;Joe&#x27;s Steak Place&#x27; was already in business. He improvised the name from a broken door on which someone had painted &#x27;GINO&#x27; and modified the spelling to prevent confusion with a regional fast food chain called Gino&#x27;s. Vento later named his own son Geno, who now is in charge of the family business.

===21st century===
Geno&#x27;s was awarded Best of Philly for Best Takeout by &quot;Philadelphia Magazine&quot; in 2000. In April 2004, a branch of the shop opened in Citizens Bank Park, the home of the Philadelphia Phillies. This location was closed in 2006 and replaced with Rick&#x27;s Steaks (operated by Rick Olivieri, grandson of Pat Olivieri, founder of Pat&#x27;s King of Steaks). 

On August 23, 2011, 71-year-old owner and founder Joey Vento died of a heart attack.

Geno&#x27;s Steaks has branch locations at Terminal B of Philadelphia International Airport and at Rivers Casino Philadelphia. 

On September 20, 2015, Geno&#x27;s Steaks opened a location at Xfinity Live! Philadelphia.

==Description==
Geno&#x27;s menu is very similar to that of Pat&#x27;s. Geno&#x27;s does not chop the meat while Pat&#x27;s does. Geno&#x27;s claims to have sold up to 4,500 sandwiches daily.

The walls, roof, and interior of Geno&#x27;s are decorated with memorabilia and hundreds of autographed and framed photos of celebrities who have eaten there.

==English sign controversy==

In June 2006, a sign on Geno&#x27;s window gained press notoriety during a national controversy over immigration. The sign reads: &quot;This Is AMERICA: WHEN ORDERING &quot;Please&quot; &quot;SPEAK ENGLISH&quot;.&quot; The Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations filed a discrimination complaint, arguing that Geno&#x27;s violated the city&#x27;s Fair Practices Ordinance, which prohibits discrimination in public accommodation, by &quot;denying service to someone because of his or her national origin, and having printed material making certain groups of people feel their patronage is unwelcome.&quot; Vento had previously said the signs are directed at the Mexican immigrants in the surrounding neighborhood.

Vento said that no one has been refused service for not speaking English, but said, &quot;If I can&#x27;t understand you, you might not get the sandwich you thought you ordered.&quot;

The Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations found probable cause that the sign is discriminatory. The commission says the sign could make non-English speakers feel unwelcome or discriminated against.

Vento enlisted the aid of the Southeastern Legal Foundation, a public-interest legal organization. In 2006, the Foundation had defended a bar owner cited by the Ohio Civil Rights Commission for a sign reading &quot;For Service, Speak English.&quot; That case was settled when the owner removed the sign.

Responding in an interview with Fox News analyst Neil Cavuto, Vento stated that he does not turn away any customer, and therefore does not discriminate. He also vowed to keep his sign displayed no matter how much pressure he receives. He explained to Cavuto that his parents had to learn English when they came to the U.S. He said that if his customers order in any other language, he will give them Cheez Whiz on bread. Vento posed some rhetorical questions: &quot;If one goes into a Puerto Rican neighborhood, how many signs would be seen in English?&quot; and &quot;When one is on the telephone, it may say press 1 for English, press 2 for Spanish; but where is the number for, say, Italian or Korean?&quot;

On March 19, 2008, Philadelphia&#x27;s Commission on Human Relations ruled that the restaurant did not violate the city&#x27;s Fair Practices Ordinance.

The sign was quietly removed at some point before the 2016 Democratic National Convention to avoid offense.

<doc id="1079659" wikidata="Q866419" url="?curid=1079659" title="Davy (crater)">
<text>Davy is a small lunar impact crater that is located on the eastern edge of the Mare Nubium. It was named after British physicist Humphry Davy. It overlies the lava-flooded remains of the satellite crater Davy Y to the east, a formation which contains a crater chain designated Catena Davy. To the southeast of Davy is the prominent crater Alphonsus.

The outer rim of Davy is low, and the interior has been partly resurfaced. The perimeter is somewhat polygonal in shape, especially in the western half, and the southeast rim has been overlain by Davy A. The latter is bowl-shaped with a notch in the northern rim. The interior of Davy lacks a central peak, although there are some low central mounds and the rim of Davy Y forms a low ridge leading from the northern outer rim.

Davy has a fractured floor, although the fractures are fairly subdued.

The crater was named in 1935 by the IAU after British physicist Humphry Davy.

==Catena Davy==
This linear string of 23 tiny craters runs from the midpoint of Davy Y towards the walled basin Ptolemaeus, following a slightly curving course to the east-northeast. It is located at selenographic coordinates 11.0° S, 7.0° W, and has a length of 50 km.

This formation is not believed to be due to secondary cratering because it is not radial to a suitable source crater. The most likely cause is believed to be a single body that broke apart prior to impact due to tidal effects. High resolution images have demonstrated that the craters formed at about the same time since the ejecta from each crater does not overlay neighboring craters. However, there are still some scientists who believe that this chain of craters may be volcanic in origin.

In 1974, six of the craters in the chain were given &quot;unofficial&quot; names for use in connection with NASA&#x27;s Topophotomap 77D1S1(10). These names, listed below, were later adopted by the IAU. Their positions in the chain are not readily distinguished based on their official coordinates, but they are well identified on the topophotomap.

Catena Davy was considered as a possible early Apollo landing site.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Davy.

<text>Fred Silverman (September 13, 1937 – January 30, 2020) was an American television executive and producer. He worked as an executive at all of the Big Three television networks, and was responsible for bringing to television such programs as &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; (the original incarnation of the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; franchise, 1969–1970), &quot;All in the Family&quot; (1971–1979), &quot;The Waltons&quot; (1972–1981), and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1976–1981), as well as the miniseries &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; (1976), &quot;Roots&quot; (1977), and &quot;Shōgun&quot; (1980). For his success in programming such successful shows, &quot;Time&quot; magazine declared him &quot;The Man with the Golden Gut&quot; in 1977.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and career ===
Silverman was born in New York City, the son of Mildred, a homemaker, and William Silverman, a radio and television service repairman. His father was Jewish and his mother was Catholic. He grew up in Rego Park, Queens, and attended Forest Hills High School. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Syracuse University, where he was a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, and then earned a master&#x27;s degree from Ohio State University. His 406-page masters thesis analyzed ten years worth of ABC programming and led to his hiring at WGN-TV in Chicago. At WGN, Silverman pioneered the concept of airing family-friendly feature films in prime time with &quot;Family Classics&quot;, which later inspired the major networks to do the same. This was followed by positions at WPIX in New York, and then at CBS. His first job at CBS was to oversee the network&#x27;s daytime programming. Silverman married his assistant, Cathy Kihn, and they had a daughter, Melissa, and son, William.

=== CBS ===
In 1970, Silverman was promoted from vice-president of program planning and development to vice president, Programs, heading the entire program department at CBS. Silverman was promoted to bring a change in perspective for the network, as it had just forced out the previous executive in that position, Michael Dann; Dann&#x27;s philosophy was to draw as many viewers as possible without regard to key demographics, which the network found to be unacceptable, as advertisers were becoming more specific about what kind of audience they were aiming for. To boost viewership in demographics that were believed to be more willing to respond to commercials, Silverman orchestrated the &quot;rural purge&quot; of 1971, which eventually eliminated many popular country-oriented shows, such as &quot;Green Acres&quot;, &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot;, &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; from the CBS schedule. In their place, however, came a new wave of classics aimed at the upscale baby boomer generation, such as &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;The Waltons&quot;, &quot;Cannon&quot;, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, and &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;.

Silverman had an uncanny ability to spot burgeoning hit material, especially in the form of spin-offs, new television series developed with characters that appeared on an existing series. For example, he spun off &quot;Maude&quot; and &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; from &quot;All in the Family&quot;, and &quot;Rhoda&quot; from &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; (as well as &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; from &quot;MTM&#x27;s&quot; writers). In early 1974, Silverman ordered a &quot;Maude&quot; spin-off titled &quot;Good Times&quot;; that series&#x27; success led Silverman to schedule it against ABC&#x27;s new hit, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, the following fall.

In other dayparts, Silverman also reintroduced game shows to the network&#x27;s daytime lineups in 1972 after a four-year absence; among the shows Silverman introduced was an updated version of the 1950s game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, which remains on the air over five decades later. After the success of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, Silverman established a working relationship with Mark Goodson and Bill Todman and most of their game shows appeared on CBS, including a revival of &quot;Match Game&quot;.

On Saturday mornings, Silverman commissioned Hanna-Barbera to produce the series &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;, and the character Fred Jones is named after Silverman. The success of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; led to several other Hanna-Barbera series airing on CBS in the early 1970s.

=== Move to ABC ===
Silverman was named president of ABC Entertainment in 1975, putting him in the ironic position of saving &quot;Happy Days&quot;, the very show that &quot;Good Times&quot; had brought to the brink of cancellation. Silverman succeeded in bringing &quot;Happy Days&quot; to the top of the ratings and generating a hit spin-off from that show, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; (another spin-off, &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot;, was also a ratings winner initially ending its first season at number three but the ratings quickly free fell).

At ABC, Silverman also greenlit other popular series such as &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; (a &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; spin-off), &quot;Family&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Donny &amp; Marie&quot;, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, &quot;Eight Is Enough&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Soap&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, long-form pioneer &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot;, and the award-winning miniseries, &quot;Roots&quot;. These moves brought ABC&#x27;s long-dormant ratings from third place to first place. However, Silverman was criticized during this period for relying heavily on escapist fare (it was Silverman who conceived the infamous &quot;The Brady Bunch Hour&quot; with Sid and Marty Krofft in late 1976) and for bringing T&amp;A or &quot;jiggle TV&quot; to the small screen with numerous ABC shows featuring buxom, attractive, and often scantily-clad young women (such as the popular &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot;).

ABC Daytime had mediocre ratings, so in order to increase them, Silverman hired Gloria Monty to produce the ailing &quot;General Hospital&quot;. He gave Monty thirteen weeks to increase the serial&#x27;s ratings or it would be cancelled. He later expanded &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;All My Children&quot;, and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; to a full hour, and created a -hour afternoon serial block. Among game shows, Silverman introduced Goodson and Todman&#x27;s &quot;Family Feud&quot; to the network.

During Silverman&#x27;s time at ABC, he overhauled the network&#x27;s Saturday-morning cartoon output, dumping Filmation (which had produced the failed &quot;Uncle Croc&#x27;s Block&quot;) and replacing it with content from Hanna-Barbera, including a continuation of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;. He also oversaw the creation of Ruby-Spears Productions, poaching two of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s lead writers, Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, to produce their own content in hopes of keeping Hanna-Barbera from becoming complacent. ABC abandoned the wiping of video-taped programs under Silverman&#x27;s tenure in 1978, as CBS had done while he was at that network.

=== Move to NBC ===
Although Silverman&#x27;s tenure at ABC was very successful, he left to become president and CEO of NBC in 1978. In stark contrast with his tenures at CBS and ABC, his three-year tenure at NBC proved to be a difficult period, marked by several high-profile failures such as the sitcom &quot;Hello, Larry&quot;, the variety shows &quot;The Big Show&quot; and &quot;Pink Lady&quot;, the drama &quot;Supertrain&quot; (which also was, at the time, the most expensive TV series produced; its high production costs and poor ratings nearly bankrupted NBC), and the Jean Doumanian era of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. (Silverman hired Doumanian after Al Franken, the planned successor for outgoing Lorne Michaels, castigated Silverman&#x27;s failures on-air in a way that Silverman took very personally.) Even in daytime, the network struggled as the expansion of &quot;Another World&quot; from 60 to 90 minutes drove away not only viewers, but longtime head writer Harding Lemay, while Regis Philbin&#x27;s talk show proved to be nowhere near as popular as his later syndicated talk show would prove to be. Compounding this was the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott costing the network millions in lost ad revenue, and multiple industry strikes pushing back the premieres of new shows.

Despite these failures, there were high points in Silverman&#x27;s tenure at NBC, including the launch of the critically lauded &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (1981), the epic mini-series &quot;Shōgun&quot;, and &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; (daytime, 1980), which would lead to Letterman&#x27;s successful &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; in 1982. Silverman had Letterman in a holding deal after the morning show which kept the unemployed Letterman from going to another network (NBC gave Letterman a $20,000 per week [$1,000,000 for a year] to sit out a year). However, Silverman nearly lost his then-current late night host, market leader Johnny Carson, after Carson sued NBC in a contract dispute; the case was settled out of court and Carson remained with NBC in exchange for the rights to his show and a reduction in time on air, along with a deal with Carson Entertainment Group that eventually resulted in the hit TV sitcom &quot;Amen&quot; as well as the &quot;TV&#x27;s Bloopers and Practical Jokes&quot; series and specials along with a handful of shows that proved short-lived.

Silverman also developed successful comedies such as &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, and &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot;. Silverman also pioneered entertainment reality programming with the 1979 launch of &quot;Real People&quot;. His contributions to the network&#x27;s game show output included Goodson and Todman&#x27;s &quot;Card Sharks&quot; and &quot;Password Plus&quot;, both of which enjoyed great success in the morning schedule, although he also canceled several other relatively popular series, including &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot; and &quot;High Rollers&quot;, to make way for &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; (those cancellations also threatened &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, whose host, Chuck Woolery, departed the show in a payment dispute during Silverman&#x27;s tenure, although the show survived). Silverman also oversaw the hiring of Pat Sajak as the new host of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; in 1981, a position that Sajak would hold for 43 years, although Silverman himself objected to Sajak&#x27;s hiring. On Saturday mornings, in a time when most of the cartoon output of the three networks was similar, Silverman oversaw the development of an animated series based on The Smurfs; the animated series &quot;The Smurfs&quot; ran from 1981 to 1990, well after Silverman&#x27;s departure, making it one of his longest-lasting contributions to the network.

In other areas of NBC, Silverman revitalized the news division, which resulted in &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; achieving parity with their competition for the first time in years. He created a new FM Radio Division, with competitive full-service stations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. During his NBC tenure, Silverman also brought in an entirely new divisional and corporate management, a team that stayed in place long after Silverman&#x27;s departure. (Among this group was a new Entertainment President, Brandon Tartikoff, who would help get NBC back on top by 1985.) Silverman also reintroduced the peacock as NBC&#x27;s corporate logo in the form of the proud &#x27;N&#x27; (which combined the peacock with the 1975 trapezoid &#x27;N&#x27; logo) in 1979; the logo was used until 1986.

=== Foundation of The Fred Silverman Company ===
In 1981, Silverman left NBC and formed The Fred Silverman Company (formerly Intermedia Entertainment) to produce shows to sell to television. The company would generate several hits including the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; TV movie series (1985–1994), &quot;Matlock&quot; (1986–1995), &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot; (1987–1992), &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1988–1995), &quot;Father Dowling Mysteries&quot; (1987–1991), and &quot;&quot; (1993–2001). Most of these continue to run in syndication. Most of these series were co-produced with Dean Hargrove and Viacom Productions.

==== History ====
After he quit NBC, Silverman formed his own production company in order to sign a deal with MGM and United Artists, who had specialized in film and television production, with George Reeves as Silverman&#x27;s partner. Shortly afterwards, he named his production company InterMedia Entertainment Co. In 1982, Silverman had sixteen development projects, but none of them got to series. It was reported that the company was working on &quot;The World of Entertainment&quot; with Gene Kelly.

In 1982, his InterMedia Entertainment Company had partnered with Marvel Productions to create a joint venture. In 1983, he partnered with Alan Thicke, along with Metromedia Producers Corporation for a syndicated late night show &quot;Thicke of the Night&quot;, which was designed to compete against &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. After several failed attempts to sell a primetime show, Silverman and MGM/UA successfully sold &quot;We Got It Made&quot; to NBC in 1983. It didn&#x27;t catch on and was gone after one season, although it did see a one-year revival in syndication for the 1987 season.

In 1984, Silverman secured a deal with Walt Disney Pictures to produce theatrical motion pictures, with the first release slated by late 1985, but it never happened. Silverman also produced the first &quot;Perry Mason&quot; telemovie, which came out in 1985, and marked the first writing-producing collaboration partnership between Silverman, writer Dean Hargrove and production company Viacom Productions.

Silverman also produced, with Earl Hamner, the drama &quot;Morningstar/Eveningstar&quot;, which was produced by Lorimar Productions and debuted on CBS in 1986. Later that year, he reunited with &quot;We Got It Made&quot; producer Gordon Farr and movie studio De Laurentiis Entertainment Group to produce &quot;Isabel Sanford&#x27;s Honeymoon Hotel&quot; for access syndication, which aired a trial week in January 1987, but was cancelled after DEG went bankrupt just before production was set to resume. Silverman and Farr also produced the sitcom &quot;California Girls&quot;, with DEG and Viacom as distributor, but it failed to sell. It was around that time that InterMedia was renamed The Fred Silverman Company. Also later that year, NBC had reached a deal with syndicator MGM Television to revive &quot;We Got it Made&quot; for the 1987–88 season in syndication.

Silverman also produced &quot;One of the Boys&quot; for NBC, in association with Stefan Phillips, Blake Hunter, Martin Cohan and Columbia Pictures Television.

During the game-show revival that followed the success of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, Silverman resurrected the 1950s game show &quot;Twenty One&quot; for NBC in 2000. A few years later, he returned to ABC in an advisory capacity.

In 1995, he was awarded the Women in Film Lucy Award in recognition of excellence and innovation in creative works that have enhanced the perception of women through the medium of television. In 1999, Silverman was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame.

=== Death ===
Silverman died from cancer on January 30, 2020, at his home in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles. He was 82.

<doc id="1079670" wikidata="Q1240657" url="?curid=1079670" title="Donati (crater)">
<text>Donati is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged south-central highlands of the Moon. It lies just to the northwest of the crater Faye, and the two outer rims are separated by a gap of less than 10 kilometers. To the north is the comparably sized Airy, and farther to the southeast is Playfair. Donati is 36 kilometers in diameter.

The outer wall of Donati has been eroded by subsequent impacts, particularly in the south and east, where craterlets overlie the rim. The distorted northern rim is joined with the irregularly shaped satellite crater Airy C. The inner floor of Donati is irregular and marked by small craters, particularly in the south and southwest. At the midpoint of the interior is a central rise. The crater is from the Pre-Imbrian period, 4.55 to 3.85 billion years ago.

It is named after the 19th-century Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Donati.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Donati.

<doc id="1079676" wikidata="Q2295321" url="?curid=1079676" title="Lestat de Lioncourt">
<text>Lestat de Lioncourt () is a fictional character from Anne Rice&#x27;s &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; novel series. Born in the mid 1700s, Lestat is an immortal vampire and the antihero of the franchise.

==Publication history==
Lestat is introduced in Rice&#x27;s 1976 novel &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, the first book of what would become &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;. His full backstory is explored in &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; (1985), which follows Lestat&#x27;s exploits from his youth in the Auvergne region of France to his early years as a vampire fledgling. Lestat is the lead character in most novels in the main series, including &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot; (1988), &quot;The Tale of the Body Thief&quot; (1992), &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot; (1995), and &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; (2003). Rice later revisited the Lestat-centric series, starting with &quot;Prince Lestat&quot; (2014), followed by &quot;Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis&quot; (2016) and &quot;Blood Communion: A Tale of Prince Lestat&quot; (2018).

===Character development===
According to Rice, Lestat was largely inspired by her husband, the poet and artist Stan Rice; both have blond hair and they share November 7 as a birth date. In a 2003 interview, Rice noted that the character had also taken on some of her own attributes, stating, &quot;Stan was Lestat; he was the inspiration. Perhaps it is best to say Lestat was Stan and me. He was Stan and what Stan taught me. Lestat was inspired by Stan, and then I became Lestat.&quot; The name &quot;Lestat&quot; was a misspelling of &quot;Lestan,&quot; which Rice believed to be an old Louisianan name. According to the characters themselves, who discuss the issue in &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot;, &quot;Blood Canticle&quot; and &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot;, the name is pronounced &quot;les-dot&quot; &quot;with a rather French flair.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==

===Physical appearance===
Lestat describes himself as six feet tall. He has blond hair that is not quite shoulder length, and that is rather curly, which sometimes appears white under fluorescent lighting. His eyes are gray-blue, but they reflect the colors of blue or violet easily from surfaces around them. He has a short narrow nose, and a mouth that is well shaped, but has always been slightly large for his face. His mouth can look very mean or extremely generous, but always sensual. He has a continuously animated face. Lestat&#x27;s fingernails (like those of all vampires in &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;) look like they are made of glass.

===Personality===

Because of his boldness, enthusiasm, and defiance, Lestat&#x27;s seniors refer to him affectionately as &quot;The Brat Prince&quot;, a title of which he is very fond. He is very vain and concerned with fashion, and will pause mid-narrative to remind the reader what he is wearing. He enjoys performing on stage, which he does as both a mortal actor in Paris and a vampire in his rock band called The Vampire Lestat, that he forms with a group of humans in the 1980s. Lestat is also fond of music; he sings and plays the piano and violin. Although he is illiterate as a mortal man, he learns to read and loves literature as a vampire. In one period of his life, he becomes a hermit and spends every night holed up at home, reading.

The first language that Lestat learns is French, although he &quot;writes&quot; his novels in English. In &quot;The Vampire Lestat,&quot; he notes that despite his French accent, he speaks English &quot;like a cross between a boatman and Sam Spade&quot; and is fond of slang.

Lestat in the books is bisexual, and has male and female lovers as both a vampire and a mortal. He is attracted to whoever most interests him at the time. Most of his early experiences are with male companions; he himself explains this by saying the women in previous centuries simply were not as interesting as men. Later in the series, Lestat offhandedly mentions that he is frightened of women and finds them extremely and egregiously distracting.

Throughout his long life, Lestat is plagued by common philosophical questions, such as &quot;Are my actions good or bad?&quot;, &quot;Is there a God?&quot;, &quot;Am I in His plan?&quot;, &quot;What happens after death?&quot;, and &quot;What makes a person happy?&quot; He finds himself more in love with humanity than ever before, despite his relationship with mankind being savage. For a while, he sees life as &quot;the Savage Garden&quot;, filled with beauty and death.

Lestat exhibits a strong altruistic nature at several points in the series. For instance, after he first becomes a vampire, he sends large gifts to his family and friends, purchases the theatre where he once worked, and settles the debts of his old manager, Renaud. Later, after his brothers and family are killed in the French Revolution, he steps forward to care for his ailing father, the only survivor, despite their hateful relationship. Lestat also frequently hunts evildoers instead of feeding from innocent victims, although he does not always abide by this rule.

As a vampire, Lestat&#x27;s abilities include telepathy, mind reading, superhuman physical attributes, and rapid healing. After receiving blood from several ancient vampires, including Magnus, Marius de Romanus, and Akasha, Lestat&#x27;s strength increases dramatically and allows him to fly, perform feats of telekinesis and pyrokinesis, and survive exposure to the sun. After Lestat ate the brain of Mekare, he was infused with the spirit of Amel and became the Host of the Sacred Core, effectively making himself the most powerful vampire on the planet.

Although he is painted as an anti-hero in &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, he is quick to defend his own behavior. In &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;, he spends much of the book telling people he is hardly the monster previous narrators have made him out to be. In much of the book, (and its follow up, &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot;), he is instead painted as a fun-loving anti-hero who is duplicit in the destruction of Akasha, the vampire queen. He loved her completely yet did not agree with her fundamental viewpoint on &quot;morality&quot;, leading to her demise.

===History===
Lestat was born on November 7, 1760, as the seventh son of the marquis d&#x27;Auvergne in the Auvergne region of France. Only two of his brothers survive to adulthood. While they are technically aristocrats, the de Lioncourt family&#x27;s fortune has been squandered, and they live in relative poverty in their medieval castle. Lestat&#x27;s mother, Gabrielle, is the only literate member of the family. Lestat&#x27;s father is blind and spends his days playing chess.

Lestat&#x27;s relationships with his father and brothers are bad - he tells his mother &quot;I dream sometimes that I might kill them all. I kill my father and my brothers in the dream. I go from room to room slaughtering them as I did the wolves.&quot; He attempts to escape from them several times, first by asking to remain at a monastery, and later by running away with a troupe of traveling players. In both instances, he is returned to his family. Encouraged by his mother, who sells her family heirloom jewels to purchase horses, guns, and mastiff dogs for him, Lestat takes up hunting, and soon becomes the family breadwinner.

The townspeople of Lestat&#x27;s village request his help with a pack of wolves that are terrorizing the town. He rides into the mountains and kills the entire pack of eight, losing his horse, dogs, and nearly his own life in the process. Although his bravery wins him the respect and admiration of the villagers, who present him with a lush red velvet cloak and boots made from the pelts of the wolves, he goes into a deep depression.

Prodded by Gabrielle, he eventually leaves Auvergne with friend and lover Nicolas and heads for Paris, intending to become an actor. During performances, he attracts the attention of an ancient vampire named Magnus, who later abducts him and transforms him into a vampire against his will.

Immediately after turning Lestat, Magnus commits suicide, leaving Lestat to fend for himself without any kind of guidance. Lestat finds himself heir to a nearly inexhaustible fortune, and begins an adventure that leads him all around the world.

===Relationships with other characters===
Despite his charisma, Lestat is portrayed as a lonesome individual. In his childhood, the only member of his family whom he had any connection with was his mother, Gabrielle. She is the only member of the family who could read, and she often immersed herself in novels, neglecting the mundane life around her. Lestat both admires and hates her for this, yet he is the only person of her family she can confide in; they develop a silent but strong bond. For this very reason Lestat makes a dying Gabrielle his first vampire companion when she comes to Paris in search of her son, wishing to see him before she succumbs to consumption.

Lestat also makes his friend and lover, Nicolas de Lenfent, a vampire. They find work at a small theatre called &quot;Renaud&#x27;s&quot;. Lestat starts off as a stage hand and then, to his surprise, becomes star of the show when he steps in for another actor. Nicolas is a violinist and performs with the theatre&#x27;s small orchestra. After Lestat is abducted and made a vampire, he tries to distance himself from his mortal friends and family, but he still provides for them. He buys Nicolas an apartment and many other luxuries, such as a Stradivarius violin, with his newly acquired &quot;coin of the realm&quot;. Nicolas is suspicious, and insists that Lestat was in fact abducted from their room at night, calling out to Nicolas. Lestat gives in to the love he feels for Nicolas and makes him a vampire as well after saving him from the self-proclaimed Children of Darkness, a coven of vampires led by Armand. But Nicolas rejects Lestat and sinks into &#x27;madness&#x27;. Lestat collapses Armand&#x27;s coven, buys Renaud&#x27;s old theatre, and gives it to Nicolas and Eleni, one of Armand&#x27;s former acolytes. Nicolas founds the Théàtre des Vampires, while Lestat and Gabrielle leave Paris to explore the world. Unhappy with life as a vampire, Nicolas immolates himself in a bonfire, leaving Lestat scarred with his insanity and death.

Another fledgling and long-term companion is Louis de Pointe du Lac. Louis is from a family who emigrated from France to North America when he was very young, he is described as young beautiful man like an angel with &quot;fine black hair&quot; and deep green eyes, whom Lestat turns into a vampire in 1791. For many years, Lestat and Louis live, travel, and kill together. Though Louis claims that Lestat made him into a vampire because Lestat merely wanted his fortune, Lestat refutes these claims in the following novel. He points out that he was heir to a vast fortune well before meeting him, and says that he &quot;fell fatally in love with Louis&quot;, who reminded him of Nicki.

Lestat and Louis &quot;adopt&quot; a dying orphan named Claudia in 1795. Lestat turns her into a vampire in order to tie Louis to him. While Lestat spoils Claudia and tries to teach her how to behave like a vampire, she largely ignores him and reserves her love for Louis. In 1860, after 65 years of living together, Claudia rebels and tries to kill Lestat by giving him two dead boys poisoned with absinthe and laudanum, then cutting his throat and stabbing him in the chest. With Louis&#x27;s help, she dumps him in a swamp near the Mississippi River. After Lestat comes back and assaults them with the help of a young composer he has transformed into a vampire, Louis flees with Claudia. In desperation, they burn down their French Quarter house while Lestat is still inside.

Louis and Claudia flee to Europe. Lestat follows them, and encounters them at the Théâtre des Vampires. Claudia dies from sun exposure while Louis is held captive by Armand and his followers. Armand leaves with Louis, finally feeling that he has had his revenge on Lestat for ruining his coven.

At the turn of the 20th century, Louis once again discovers Lestat living in New Orleans in a weakened state. Louis turns his back on him in pity and disgust. This version of events, however, is also refuted by Lestat, who made no mention of contact with Louis in that era, though he had been visited by Armand and freely admits that his memory of this period is fragmented. Louis and Lestat reunite in the 1980s with a new understanding, only to be caught up and briefly separated again in the events that are detailed in &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot;, though in later books Lestat refers to Louis as his lover.

Lestat has a disdain for rules and order, and states, in &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot;, that he has always had to be his own teacher. He openly disregards and refuses to show fear to Armand, the leader of the Paris coven, even when confronted with the possibility of execution. The only immortal Lestat appears to openly respect and defer to is Marius. Lestat seeks him out as a mentor in the late 18th century, leaving him messages across Europe and Asia until Marius decides to reveal himself. While Lestat eagerly learns from Marius, he also openly breaches many of the rules Marius seeks to impress upon him, such as the prohibition on revealing himself to mortals. Such behavior inspires Marius to refer to Lestat as &quot;the damnedest creature&quot; and nickname him &quot;the Brat Prince.&quot; Lestat sought Marius out to be his teacher but the relationship turned out also to be a father-son relationship.

Lestat is entirely responsible for the epic triumph and tragedy told in &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot;, after he presents himself to the world through his autobiography and formation of a rock band, singing vampire secrets. His songs waken Akasha, the Queen of the Damned, from her sleep, and she takes Lestat on as her lover while she enacts a horrible plan to take over the world. This adventure forces Lestat to think of things and people other than himself for one of the first times in his long life, and the adventure changes him forever, forcing him to begin fighting for a kind of redemption—though, as displayed in &quot;The Tale of the Body Thief&quot;, Lestat remains his old, devilish self, revelling in his identity as the Brat Prince.

After the mysterious and mystical events of &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot;, Lestat falls into a vampiric sleep from which the Mayfair witch Merrick eventually manages to wake him, forging a bond between them. After the spiritual, emotional and mystical changes within Lestat during his adventures in the heavenly and hellish realms he visited, Lestat became a legend amongst the remaining vampires, taking control of New Orleans and killing any fledgling vampires who killed mortals in his city. While it is largely due to his actions that the Talamasca—an order of scholars who study the supernatural world but vow to never interfere in it—declare a kind of war on vampires, it is also due to his efforts that no lives are taken over the course of the dispute between the two groups.

Lestat is sought out by a desperate Tarquin Blackwood in the novel &quot;Blackwood Farm&quot; to help him with a problem the young vampire feels only the legendary Lestat can help him with. Though Lestat suffers losses from this adventure, he falls somewhat in love with Quinn, and the two stay close after their adventure together reaches its conclusion.

In &quot;Blood Canticle&quot;, Lestat falls in love with a witch of the Mayfair clan named Rowan Mayfair, who shares the same feelings towards him. Rowan eventually asks Lestat to turn her into a vampire but, despite their feelings toward one another, he painfully chose not to, because she is a guiding figure in the Mayfair family and he cannot take her away from it or from her faithful and loving husband Michael.

In &quot;Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis&quot;, Lestat (now the leader of the vampire tribe) reunites with Louis, who left Armand and his home at Trinity Gate. Lestat requests Louis return with him to the chateau in France as his companion and confidante; Louis agrees and becomes consort to Lestat, taking an active role in solving the dilemma the tribe face in that novel.

<doc id="1079677" wikidata="Q3511551" url="?curid=1079677" title="Extended Adaptive Multi-Rate – Wideband">
<text>Extended Adaptive Multi-Rate – Wideband (AMR-WB+) is an audio codec that extends AMR-WB. It adds support for stereo signals and higher sampling rates. Another main improvement is the use of transform coding (transform coded excitation – TCX) additionally to ACELP. This greatly improves the generic audio coding. Automatic switching between transform coding and ACELP provides both good speech and audio quality with moderate bit rates.

As AMR-WB operates at internal sampling rate 12.8 kHz, AMR-WB+ also supports various internal sampling frequencies ranges from 12.8 kHz to 38.4 kHz. AMR-WB uses 16 kHz sampling frequency with a resolution of 14 bits left justified in a 16-bit word. AMR-WB+ uses 16/24/32/48 kHz sampling frequencies with a resolution of 16 bits in a 16-bit word.

3GPP originally developed the AMR-WB+ audio codec for streaming and messaging services in Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) and Third Generation (3G) cellular systems.
Its primary target applications are Packet-Switched Streaming service (PSS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service (MBMS).

File storage of AMR-WB+ encoded audio is specified within the 3GP container format, 3GPP-defined ISO-based multimedia file format defined in 3GPP TS 26.244.

The AMR-WB+ codec has a wide bit-rate range, from 5.2 to 48 kbit/s. Mono rates are scalable from 5.2 to 36 kbit/s, and stereo rates are scalable from 6.2 to 48 kbit/s, reproducing bandwidth up to 20 kHz (approaching CD quality). Moreover, it provides backward compatibility with AMR wideband.

== Software support ==
In September 2005, VoiceAge Corporation announced availability of AMR-WB+ decoder in Helix DNA Client.

== Licensing and patent issues ==
AMR-WB+ compression incorporate several patents of Nokia Corporation, Telefonaktiebolaget L. M. Ericsson and VoiceAge Corporation.

VoiceAge Corporation is the &quot;License Administrator&quot; for the AMR and AMR-WB+ patent pools. VoiceAge also accepts submission of patents for determination of their possible essentiality to these standards.
The initial fee for applications using &quot;real-time channels&quot; with AMR-WB+ is $6,500. Minimum annual royalty shall be $10,000, excluding the initial fee in year 1 of the license agreement.

AMR-WB+ monaural decoder in a category of personal computer products is licensed for free. Stereo AMR-WB+ decoder for personal computer products is licensed for $0.30.

<text>Hase is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged southeast part of the Moon, to the south-southwest of the prominent walled plain Petavius. Palitzsch and Vallis Palitzsch are attached to the northeastern rim of Hase.

The rim of this crater has been damaged and eroded by a long history of subsequent impacts. The most prominent of these is Hase D, a comparably sized crater that has overlain the southern rim, leaving only a low rim between the two formations. Hase A is a small crater that lies in the interior of Hase, near the irregular northern rim. The remainder of the floor is rough and irregular.

To the southeast of Hase D is a system of linear rilles designated Rimae Hase. Their north-western extension transects western part of Hase and Hase D.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hase.

<doc id="1079686" wikidata="Q4970722" url="?curid=1079686" title="British Rail Class 122">
<text>The British Rail Class 122 diesel mechanical multiple units were built by Gloucester RC&amp;W in 1958. Twenty single-car, double-ended driving motor vehicles, nicknamed &quot;Bubble Cars&quot;, were built, numbered 55000–55019. These were supplemented by nine single-ended trailer vehicles, numbered 56291–56299 (some of which were later renumbered into the 54291–54299 block).

==Construction==

== Operation ==
The Class 122s were built mainly for use on the London Midland Region of British Railways, although some were also used in Scotland. They were used on a variety of lightly used lines, many of which were closed during the Beeching Axe in the 1960s including the ex-LSWR lines in West Devon and North Cornwall. Routes served included the Stourbridge Town and St Albans Abbey branch lines, as well as local services between Dundee and Arbroath. (The similar Pressed Steel Company built Class 121 single units were also used on the Western Region).

During the 1990s, refurbished Class 122 units were used on the Cornish branches between Liskeard and Looe and St Erth and St Ives.

== Parcels conversion ==
In 1968, three cars (55013–55015) were converted for use on the Scottish Region to carry parcels traffic and were reclassified Class 131, though the vehicles themselves were not renumbered. The converted vehicles were given the TOPS classification DXV.

== Usage after passenger service ==
Upon privatisation of Britain&#x27;s railways, the Class 122 fleet has been withdrawn from normal service. However several units were operated by EWS and Network Rail (previously Railtrack) in departmental service, reclassified as Class 960.
== Preservation ==
&quot;Bubble Cars&quot; have proved popular for preservation on heritage railways.

== Models ==
Dapol has released models of the Class 122 railcar in both O gauge and OO gauge in a variety of liveries. In 2012, Dapol introduced a British N gauge model of the Class 122 in both BR blue and BR blue and grey liveries.

<text>Heaviside is a large lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It is attached to the eastern rim of the equally large walled plain Keeler, although Keeler is somewhat less eroded. To the northwest lies the crater Stratton, and to the southeast is the prominent Aitken.

The outer wall of Heaviside has been worn and eroded by subsequent impacts, particularly to the north and south. Only the eastern rim remains relatively intact, while the western rim has been slightly distorted by the adjacent Keeler impact.

The relatively flat interior floor is marked by many small craters and rugged terrain to the southeast and west. The most notable of these are the satellite craters Heaviside N in the south, Heaviside Z in the north, and the bowl-shaped Heaviside E near the eastern rim.

The crater was named after British mathematician and physicist Oliver Heaviside by the IAU in 1970. Heaviside was known as &quot;Crater 305&quot; prior to naming.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Heaviside.

<doc id="1079696" wikidata="Q322945" url="?curid=1079696" title="Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976">
<text>The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (ALRA) is Australian federal government legislation that provides the basis upon which Aboriginal Australian people in the Northern Territory can claim rights to land based on traditional occupation. It was the first law by any Australian government that legally recognised the Aboriginal system of land ownership, and legislated the concept of inalienable freehold title, as such was a fundamental piece of social reform. Its long title is An Act providing for the granting of Traditional Aboriginal Land in the Northern Territory for the benefit of Aboriginals, and for other purposes.

The Act has been amended 27 times between 1978 and 2021. Significant amendments were the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Act 2006, and Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Economic Empowerment) Act 2021.

==History==
The results of the 1967 Australian referendum meant that the Federal Government could make special laws relating to Aboriginal people which could override any state-based legislation; this was seen as a great victory in the struggle for Aboriginal land rights in Australia.

The Labor government under Gough Whitlam, after making land rights one of his election campaign priorities, first introduced a land rights Bill to Parliament. Whitlam chose to establish a precedent in the Northern Territory (NT), which was controlled by the Commonwealth (federal) government, rather than attempt federal legislation first off. He appointed Justice Woodward in February 1973 to head an inquiry into how best to recognise Aboriginal land rights in the NT, called the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission (also known as the &quot;Woodward Royal Commission&quot;). Woodward produced his final report in April 1974, expressing the opinion that one of the main aims of land rights was &quot;The doing of simple justice to a people who have been deprived of their land without their consent and without compensation&quot;. He said that Aboriginal land should be granted as inalienable freehold title, meaning &quot;it could not be acquired, sold, mortgaged or disposed of in any way&quot;, and title should be communal.

The Bill lapsed upon the dismissal of the government in 1975. The Liberal government, led by Malcolm Fraser, reintroduced a similar Bill, and this was signed by the Governor-General of Australia on 16 December 1976.

==Significance==
It was the first law by any Australian government that legally recognised the Aboriginal system of land ownership, legislating the concept of inalienable freehold title, and thus the first of all Aboriginal land rights legislation in Australia. &quot;The Land Rights Act&quot; is a fundamental piece of social reform. It established the legal basis on which Aboriginal people could claim rights to land based on customary or traditional occupation, also known as native title, if evidence could be shown. (The South Australian &quot;Pitjantjatjara Lands Act 1956&quot; had granted land to the Pitjantjatjara people, but as a one-off, did not provide a basis for future claims by others.)

==Description==
The main purpose of the Act is &quot;to reinstate ownership of traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory to Aboriginal people&quot; (Austrade). It provides for the grant of inalienable freehold title for Aboriginal land, meaning that the land cannot be bought or otherwise acquired, including by any NT law.

In the original Act, only claims to unalienated Crown land in the NT were permissible, under three district sections, and the Act specified an end date of June 1997 by which claims had to be lodged.
The Act allows for a claim of Australian native title if claimants can provide evidence of their traditional association with land. About 50% of the Northern Territory land and 85% of its coastline are owned communally by Aboriginal peoples.

Since 1976, many amendments to the Act have been passed. , the most recent compilation (No. 41) came into force on 4 April 2019. , the major sections of the Act are:
* Part I—Preliminary
* Part II—Grants of land to Aboriginal Land Trusts
* Part IIA—Executive Director of Township Leasing
* Part III—Aboriginal Land Councils
* Part IV—Mining
* Part V—Aboriginal Land Commissioners
* Part VI—Aboriginals Benefit Account
* Part VIA—Northern Territory Aboriginal Investment Corporation
* Part VII—Miscellaneous
* Schedules 1–7

=== Part II: Aboriginal Land Trusts ===
Aboriginal Land Trusts are established under the Act. Their main functions are:

* to hold title to land vested in it in accordance with this Act; and
* to exercise its powers as owner of land for the benefit of the Aboriginal people concerned.

Title to the land granted under the Act is held by these land trusts; , there are 151 Aboriginal land trusts, each administered by the a land council, dependent on location of the trust. 
=== Part III: Land Councils ===
The Act specified that at least two Land Councils must be created.
The Central Land Council, covering the southern part of the NT, and the Northern Land Council, covering the northern part of the NT, were created by the Act. The Tiwi Land Council, covering Bathurst and Melville Islands north of Darwin, and the Anindilyakwa Land Council, covering Groote Eylandt and Bickerton Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria, were later created from parts of the Northern Land Council. 

New Land Councils can be created under the Act: Section 23 of the Act specifies the functions of Land Councils; however, the four original land councils continue to exist .
=== Part IV: Mining===
Land development, including exploration and mining activities, on Aboriginal land are undertaken through negotiations with traditional owners groups and facilitated by land councils. Various types of payment for the land, other financial and non-financial benefits may be included in negotiations. The Act prescribes how the land councils and land trusts may grant usage rights and access, but in some circumstances a federal or NT Minister&#x27;s approval is also required. Income received for the use of the land is distributed by the land councils according to the agreements with the traditional owners and as the Act provides.

Royalties paid to the NT and Federal governments for the use of the land are processed and directed to the Aboriginals Benefit Account (ABA) (Part VI of the Act) and the funds are to be used for certain purposes prescribed by the Act which benefit Aboriginal peoples in the NT.

===Part VII: Miscellaneous===
====Sacred sites====
Section 69 (under &quot;Part VII - Miscellaneous&quot;) of the Act defines a special category of land, the sacred site, which is a site of significance according to Aboriginal tradition. It prohibits a person from entering a sacred site, with penalties of a fine or prison sentence. (There is also additional protection for sacred sites in the NT under the &quot;Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989&quot;.)

==1997 &quot;Reeves Report&quot;==
A significant review of the Act (referred to as ALRA) was undertaken from October 1997, when the government appointed barrister John Reeves to examine its effectiveness, operation of aspects relating to mining and the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account, and the role of the Land Councils. The &quot;Reeves Report&quot; concluded that the ALRA had been very effective in granting traditional Aboriginal land in the NT, with benefits exceeding their costs for the Aboriginal people, but it also made many recommendations for change.

After examination of the recommendations by various bodies in the following years, the Northern Territory Government and the Land Councils produced a joint response in June 2003, in their &quot;Detailed Joint Submission to the Commonwealth - Workability Reforms of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (ALRA)&quot;. Over some years, the issue of private versus communal ownership of Aboriginal land was considered and debated by many parties, including Warren Mundine, Mick Dodson, Galarrwuy Yunupingu, Noel Pearson and others. Tom Calma, as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, said in his &quot;Native Title Report 2005&quot; that it was &quot;not necessary to put the communal tenure of Indigenous land at risk&quot; by converting to individual freehold titles.

It was agreed that there were benefits in the new proposals, but various details were debated at length. Following the Government making changes to the ALRA in 2005, Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation expressed concern about Land Council funding and function changes and the establishment of new Land Councils. Tom Calma commented at length in July 2006, starting with three main concerns: that the amendments had been made without the full understanding and consent of traditional owners and Indigenous Northern Territorians; that the intention of the amendments was to reduce the capacity for Indigenous people to have decision making influence over their lands; and that it was likely that the amendments would have a range of negative impacts on Indigenous peoples’ rights and interests.

==2006 Amendments==
On 17 August 2006, the Howard government amended the Act. The &quot;Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 2006&quot;, in effect from 1 July 2007, added several clauses to the Act.

The government summary of the Amendments includes &quot;to increase access to Aboriginal land for development, especially exploration and mining; facilitate the leasing of Aboriginal land and the mortgaging of leases; provide for a tenure system for townships on Aboriginal land that will allow individuals to have property rights; devolve decision-making powers to regional Aboriginal communities&quot;, and change the provisions governing land councils to increase accountability.

The most significant amendments enabled Aboriginal groups to more directly manage their land. Two Land Councils (Central and Northern) manage manage mainland NT Aboriginal land. By comparison, New South Wales has 121 Land Councils. These new sections of the Act included Section 19a, which introduced the option of Township Leasing, and Section 28a, which introduced the option of a &#x27;delegation of powers&#x27; to a local Aboriginal corporation.

==Local decision making==
The Act specifies methods for Land Councils to support local Aboriginal groups to make decisions regarding their land, including:
* Part II (Grants of Land to Aboriginal Land Trusts): Section 19A: Land Trust may grant headlease over township
* Part III (Aboriginal Land Councils), Section 28A: Delegation of a Land Council’s functions or powers to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation

<text>Kayes (Bambara: ߞߊߦߌ tr. &quot;Kayi&quot;, Soninké: &quot;Xaayi&quot;) is a city in western Mali on the Sénégal River with a population of 127,368 at the 2009 census. Kayes is the capital of the administrative region of the same name. The city is located northwest of the capital Bamako.

==Toponymy==
There are multiple possible etymologies of the name &#x27;Kayes&#x27;, all derived from the Soninke language. These include: the word &quot;kharré&quot;, which describes a low humid place that floods in rainy season; the word &#x27;kayé&#x27;, a type of grass; &#x27;khayé&#x27;, the Soninke name for the rhun palm.

==History==
The area around Kayes was historically a part of the Soninke states of Diarra and Gajaaga. The important trading center of Goundiourou, known in Arabic sources as Ghiyaru, was just across the river, and was later rebuilt just south of the modern city.

Kayes itself was founded in the second half of the 19th century. Guéssé Sidy, a prince of Khasso, established a base there to protect the western approaches to the kingdom&#x27;s capital, Medina.

Prior to French colonial expansion, Kayes was still a small village. In 1881 the French chose it as the site for a fort and barracks, the headquarters of the colonial presence in the central Sudan, as Medina was difficult to access by boat. By 1886 the post had been fortified, and by 1889 a market town of 6000 people had grown up around it.

From the beginning, the French began building a railway linking Kayes, the furthest point reachable by boat on the Senegal river, with Bafoulabe upstream. This stretch was completed in 1890, and reached to Bamako in 1904. A rail link to Thiès was begun in 1907 which, interrupted by the First World War, was completed in 1923.

In 1892, Kayes became the capital of the French Sudan; Bamako replaced it as the capital, first of the state of Haut Sénégal-Niger on October 17, 1899, then as the capital of all of French Sudan in 1908.

During World War II, a portion of Poland&#x27;s gold reserve, evacuated during the German-Soviet invasion in 1939, was stored for several years in Kayes before being transported to the United States in 1944, to be returned to Poland after the occupation and war ended.
==Economy and transport==
Kayes lies on the Route Nationale 1 (RN1) highway and is by road from Bamako and from the border with Senegal. The town has an international airport (Kayes Airport), and lies on the Dakar-Niger Railway which offered regional passenger train service to Bamako three times a week via Kati and Diamou as of 2013. The area is rich in gold and iron.

==Climate==
Kayes has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;). The climate is subject to the West African Monsoon with all the rainfall occurring between June and October. August is the wettest month. There is almost no rainfall during the other seven months of the year. The total annual rainfall is around . Kayes is nicknamed the &quot;pressure cooker of Africa&quot; due to its extreme heat; the town is surrounded by iron-rich mountains which contribute to the temperature. The town has been described as the hottest continuously inhabited town in Africa. The average daily high temperature in the city is , with temperatures usually peaking in April and May at an average of nearly .

==Area==
Sites found in and around Kayes include:
* Fort du Médine 
* Félou Falls, upstream on the Senegal river
* Gouina Falls, to the southeast on the Senegal river
* The &quot;tata&quot; of Koniakari, constructed by El Hadj Umar Tall, to the northeast
* Lake Magui and Lake Doro, both watered by the Kolimbiné River
* The Manantali Dam

<text>Legendre is a lunar impact crater that is located near the eastern limb of the Moon. Just to the southwest is the crater Adams. To the northwest is Palitzsch and the prominent Petavius.

The rim of Legendre is worn and eroded, with many small craterlets along the rim and the sides of the outer wall. A small crater approximately 25 kilometers in diameter lies across the southern rim. There is also a narrow gap in the northeast rim that provides a valley leading into the interior. The crater floor is relatively flat, but is marked by multiple small craterlets.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Legendre.

<text>Bernard Joseph Francis Lonergan (17 December 1904 – 26 November 1984) was a Canadian Jesuit priest, philosopher, and theologian, regarded by many as one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century.

Lonergan&#x27;s works include &quot;Insight: A Study of Human Understanding&quot; (1957) and &quot;Method in Theology&quot; (1972), as well as two studies of Thomas Aquinas, several theological textbooks, and numerous essays, including two posthumously published essays on macroeconomics. The projected 25-volume &quot;Collected Works&quot; with the University of Toronto Press is now complete. Lonergan held appointments at the Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome; Regis College, Toronto, as distinguished visiting professor at Boston College, and as Stillman Professor of Divinity at Harvard University.

==Aims==

By his own account, Lonergan set out to do for human thought in our time what Thomas Aquinas had done for his own time. Aquinas had successfully applied Aristotelian thought to the service of a Christian understanding of the universe. Lonergan&#x27;s program was to come to terms with modern scientific, historical, and hermeneutical thinking in a comparable way. He pursued this program in his two most fundamental works, &quot;Insight&quot; and &quot;Method in Theology&quot;.

One key to Lonergan&#x27;s project is &quot;self-appropriation&quot;, that is, the personal discovery and personal embrace of the dynamic structure of inquiry, insight, judgment, and decision. By self-appropriation, one finds in one&#x27;s own intelligence, reasonableness, and responsibility the foundation of every kind of inquiry and the basic pattern of operations undergirding methodical investigation in every field.

A second key, one which subsumes the first, is a global &quot;turn to the idea&quot; of functionally specialized collaboration. Lonergan&#x27;s hope was that his discovery and articulation of eight dynamically-related but distinct tasks would, in good time, subsume, if not replace, the splintered and oftentimes isolated results of what he called &quot;field specialization&quot; and &quot;subject specialization&quot; that prevail in the modern university. Along the same lines, in the 1969 essay &quot;The Future of Christianity,&quot; he wrote that the transition from &quot;classicist culture&quot; to &quot;modern culture&quot; would require &quot;a complete restructuring of Catholic theology.&quot; The needed restructuring applies to all academic disciplines and all creeds.

Lonergan is often associated—with his fellow Jesuits Karl Rahner and Joseph Maréchal—with &quot;transcendental Thomism&quot;, i.e., a philosophy which attempts to combine Thomism with certain views or methods commonly associated with Immanuel Kant&#x27;s transcendental idealism. However, Lonergan did not regard this label as particularly helpful for understanding his intentions.

== Life ==

Bernard Joseph Francis Lonergan was born on 17 December 1904 in Buckingham, Quebec, Canada. After four years at Loyola College (Montreal), he entered the Upper Canada (English) province of the Society of Jesus in 1922 and made his profession of vows on the Feast of St Ignatius of Loyola, 31 July 1924. After two further years of formation and education, he was assigned to study scholastic philosophy at Heythrop College, then in Oxfordshire, in 1926. Lonergan respected the competence and honesty of his professors at Heythrop, but was deeply dissatisfied with their Suarezian philosophy. While at Heythrop, Lonergan also took external degrees in mathematics and classics at the University of London. In 1930 he returned to Canada, where he taught for three years at Loyola College, Montreal.

In 1933, Lonergan was sent for theological studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He was ordained to the Catholic priesthood in 1936. After a year of Jesuit formation (&quot;tertianship&quot;) in Amiens, Lonergan returned to the Gregorian University in 1937 to pursue doctoral studies in theology. Due to the Second World War, he was whisked out of Italy and back to Canada in May 1940, just two days before the scheduled defence of his doctoral dissertation. He began teaching theology at College de l&#x27;Immaculee Conception, the Jesuit theology faculty in Montreal in 1940, as well as the Thomas More Institute in 1945–46. In the event, he would not formally defend his dissertation and receive his doctorate until a special board of examiners from the Immaculee Conception was convened in Montreal on 23 December 1946.

Lonergan taught theology at Regis College (a theological school attached to the University of Toronto) from 1947 to 1953, and at the Gregorian University from 1953 to 1964. At the Gregorian, Lonergan taught Trinity and Christology in alternate years, and produced substantial textbooks on these topics. In 1964, he made another hasty return to North America, this time to be treated for lung cancer. He was appointed again to Regis College from 1965 to 1975, was Stillman Professor of Divinity at Harvard University in 1971–72, and distinguished visiting professor at Boston College from 1975 until 1983. He died at the Jesuit infirmary in Pickering, Ontario, on 26 November 1984.

== Influences ==
Lonergan described the genesis of his thought up to the mid-1950s in an interview. Augustine and John Henry Newman were major influences upon his early thinking. J. A. Stewart&#x27;s study of Plato&#x27;s doctrine of ideas was also influential.

In the epilogue to &quot;Insight&quot;, Lonergan mentions the important personal transformation wrought in him by a decade&#x27;s apprenticeship to the thought of Thomas Aquinas. He produced two major exegetical studies of Thomas Aquinas: &quot;Grace and Freedom,&quot; and &quot;Verbum: Word and Idea in Aquinas&quot;.

== Works ==
The University of Toronto Press has published Lonergan&#x27;s work in a 25-volume series, &quot;Collected Works of Bernard Lonergan&quot;.

===&quot;Grace and Freedom&quot;===
Lonergan&#x27;s doctoral dissertation was an exploration of the theory of operative grace in the thought of Thomas Aquinas. His director, Charles Boyer, S.J., pointed him to a passage in the &quot;Summa theologiae&quot; and suggested that the received interpretations were mistaken. A study of Thomas Aquinas on divine grace and human freedom was well-suited to his interest in working out a theoretical analysis of history. The dissertation was completed in 1940; it was rewritten and published as a series of articles in the journal &quot;Theological Studies&quot;. The articles were edited into a book by J. Patout Burns in 1972, and both the revised and the original version of his study were subsequently published in his &quot;Collected Works&quot; as &quot;Grace and Freedom: Operative Grace in the thought of St. Thomas Aquinas&quot;.

===&quot;Verbum: Word and Idea in Aquinas&quot;===
After his return from Rome, Lonergan wrote a series of four articles for &quot;Theological Studies&quot; on the inner word in Thomas Aquinas which became highly influential in the study of St. Thomas&#x27; accounts of knowledge and cognition. The articles were later collected and published under the title &quot;Verbum: Word and Idea in Aquinas&quot;.

===&quot;Insight: A Study of Human Understanding&quot;===
In 1945 Lonergan gave a course at the Thomas More Institute in Montreal that extended from September to April 1946 entitled &quot;Thought and Reality,&quot; and the success of that course was the inspiration behind his decision to write the book &quot;Insight&quot;. While teaching theology at Collegium Christi Regis, now Regis College affiliated with the University of Toronto, Lonergan wrote &quot;Insight: A Study of Human Understanding&quot;, inaugurating the generalized empirical method (GEM). GEM belongs to the movement of &quot;transcendental Thomism&quot; inaugurated by Joseph Maréchal. This method begins with an analysis of human knowing as divided into three levels – experience, understanding, and judgment – and, by stressing the objectivity of judgment more than Kant had done, develops a Thomistic vision of Being as the goal of the dynamic openness of the human spirit.

===&quot;Method in Theology&quot;===
In 1972, Lonergan published &quot;Method in Theology&quot;, which distinguishes eight groups of operations (&quot;functional specialties&quot;) in theology. Indeed, method is a phenomenon which applies across the board in all disciplines and realms of consciousness. Through his work on method, Lonergan aimed, among other things, to establish a firm basis for agreement and progress in disciplines such as philosophy and theology. Lonergan believed that the lack of an agreed method among scholars in such fields has inhibited substantive agreement from being reached and progress from being made, whereas in the natural sciences, for example, widespread agreement among scholars on the scientific method has enabled remarkable progress. The chapter on &quot;Religious Commitment&quot; in &quot;Method in Theology&quot; was delivered in a lecture at The Villanova University Symposium and published in: &quot;The Pilgrim People: A Vision with Hope&quot;, Volume IV (ed. Joseph Papin, Villanova University Press, 1970). Karl Rahner, S.J., however, criticized Lonergan&#x27;s theological method in a short article entitled: &quot;Some Critical Thoughts on &#x27;Functional Specialties in Theology&#x27;&quot; where he states: &quot;Lonergan&#x27;s theological methodology seems to me to be &quot;so generic that it really fits every science&quot;, and hence is not the methodology of theology as such, but only a very general methodology of science.&quot; In fact, by the time of writing &quot;Method in Theology&quot;, Lonergan had recognized that his proposal was along interdisciplinary lines. Moreover, his proposal was intended to move theology off a &quot;list of academic disciplines&quot; by appealing to patterns of operations yielding progress in &quot;successful sciences.&quot; Lonergan&#x27;s thinking in &quot;Method&quot; was, indeed, inspirational in bringing theological and psychology together in a unique way, e.g., Bernard J. Tyrrell, &quot;Christotherapy: A Theology of Christian Healing and Enlightenment Inspired by the Thought of Thomas Hora and Bernard Lonergan&quot; in &quot;The Papin Festschrift: Wisdom and Knowledge, Essays in Honour of Joseph Papin, Volume II&quot; (ed. Joseph Armenti, Villanova University Press, 1976, pp. 293–329).

===Trinitarian theology===
While at the Gregorian University, Lonergan composed a two-volume Latin textbook, &quot;De Deo Trino&quot; (third edition, 1964). It has recently appeared in the Collected Works together with an interleaf English translation under the title &quot;The Triune God: Doctrines&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Triune God: Systematics&quot; (2007).

In &quot;The Triune God: Doctrines&quot;, Lonergan begins with an examination of the dialectical process by which the dogma of the Trinity developed in the first four centuries. This section was previously published in English as &quot;The Way to Nicea&quot;. The second section of the work advances dogmatic theses on (1) the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, (2) the divinity of the Holy Spirit, (3) the distinction of the divine persons by relations of origin, and (4) the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son (the Filioque). The fifth and final thesis is that the Trinity is a theological mystery in the strict sense and can only be understood analogically. A concluding scholion presents New Testament evidence in favor of the &quot;psychological&quot; analogy of the Trinity.

In &quot;The Triune God: Systematics&quot;, Lonergan develops the theory of intelligible (or spiritual) emanations in God as propounded by Thomas Aquinas. The volume begins with a discussion of the method of systematic theology which seeks an imperfect but highly fruitful understanding of the mysteries of faith by means of analogies. The following chapters develop an analogical conception of the divine processions (as intelligible emanations), relations, persons, and the two missions of the Word and Spirit.

===Christology===
Lonergan produced two textbooks in Christology. In 1956 he produced a supplemental volume &quot;De Constitutione Christi Ontologica et Psychica&quot;; the fourth and final edition of 1964 was presented in the Collected Works with an interleaf translation as &quot;The Ontological and Psychological Constitution of Christ&quot; (2002). Lonergan clarifies the metaphysical principles of Christ&#x27;s constitution as one person in two distinct natures, and transposes that framework to address the consciousness of Christ as a single subject of two distinct conscious subjectivities.

Beginning with an edition of 1960, Lonergan introduced his own textbook for his Christology course, &quot;De Verbo Incarnato&quot;. Subsequent editions were published in 1961 and in 1964. &quot;De Verbo Incarnato&quot; is divided into four parts. The first part is an interpretation of the divinity and humanity of Christ as presented in the New Testament (thesis 1). The second part recapitulates the formation of the dogmatic theological tradition of Christology up through the monothelite controversy in the seventh century (theses 2–5). The third part, which covers much the same material as &quot;The Constitution of Christ&quot; but in a somewhat different manner, formulates what Lonergan calls &quot;theological conclusions&quot; from the hypostatic union regarding the ontological constitution of Christ as one person in two natures (theses 6–9), and his psychological constitution as a single subject of two subjectivities (thesis 10). The fourth part concerns &quot;what belongs to Christ&quot; (&quot;de iis quae christi sunt&quot;), including his grace, knowledge, sinlessness, and freedom (theses 11–14). The fifth and final section regards the redemptive work of Christ, in three theses: redemption in the New Testament (thesis 15), the satisfaction given by Christ (thesis 16), and &quot;Understanding the Mystery: The Law of the Cross,&quot; presenting Lonergan&#x27;s synthetic understanding of Christ&#x27;s work (thesis 17).

He also produced a separate treatise on the Redemption, of uncertain date and never published. This treatise treats, in six chapters divided into 45 articles, good and evil, divine justice, the death and resurrection of Christ, the cross of Christ, the satisfaction given by Christ, and the work of Christ.

Among Lonergan&#x27;s more noteworthy contributions to Christology include his theory about the ontological and psychological constitution of Christ, his interpretation of Christ&#x27;s human knowing, and his interpretation of Christ&#x27;s redemptive work.

Both &quot;De Verbo Incarnato&quot; and the supplement on Redemption are in preparation for the Collected Works. The plan is to present two volumes, &quot;The Incarnate Word&quot;, which would include theses 1–14 in Latin with an interleaf English translation, and &quot;The Redemption&quot;, which would include theses 15–17 and the supplement on Redemption.

===Macroeconomics===
In the 1930s and early 1940s, Lonergan developed an intense interest in macroeconomic analysis, but never published the manuscript he developed. In later life while teaching at Boston College, Lonergan returned his attention to the economic interests of his younger days. From 1978 until 1983, Lonergan taught the course &quot;Macroeconomics and the Dialectic of History&quot; at Boston College for one semester each year. The University of Toronto Press has published his two works on economics: &quot;For a New Political Economy&quot; and &quot;Macroeconomic Dynamics: An Essay in Circulation Analysis&quot;

== Philosophy: generalized empirical method ==
Lonergan described his philosophical program as a generalization of empirical method (GEM) to investigate not only data given through exterior sensation, but also the internal data of consciousness. More specifically, objects are known while considering the corresponding operations of the subject and vice versa, experiencing and the subsequent operations of the intellect being components of both knowing and reality. Method, for Lonergan, is not a technique but a concrete pattern of operations.

Lonergan maintained what he called &quot;critical realism&quot;. By &quot;realism&quot;, he affirmed that we make true judgments of fact and of value, and by &quot;critical&quot;, he based knowing and valuing in a critique of consciousness. GEM traces to their roots in consciousness the sources of all the meanings and values that make up personality, social orders, and historical developments. A more thorough overview of Lonergan&#x27;s work is available at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

Lonergan&#x27;s ideas include &quot;radical unintelligibility&quot;, &quot;theological critical realism&quot;, and &quot;functional specialization&quot;. Given the fact that no science can today be mastered by a single individual, Lonergan advocated sub-division of the scientific process in all fields. One of the leading voices in the effort to implement functional specialization was Philip McShane.

== Hermeneutics ==
Frederick G. Lawrence has made the claim that Lonergan&#x27;s work may be seen as the culmination of the postmodern hermeneutic revolution begun by Martin Heidegger. Heidegger replaced Edmund Husserl&#x27;s phenomenology of pure perception with his own linguistic phenomenology. Hans-Georg Gadamer worked out this seminal insight into his philosophical hermeneutics. According to Lawrence, however, Heidegger, and in a lesser way, Gadamer, remained under the influence of Kant when they refused to take seriously the possibility of grace and redemption. Lawrence makes the observation that Heidegger—influenced also by Augustine&#x27;s inability to work out a theoretical distinction between grace and freedom—conflated finitude and fallenness in his account of the human being. &quot;Sin&quot; is therefore absorbed into &quot;fallenness,&quot; and fallenness is simply part of the human condition. Lonergan builds on the &quot;theorem of the supernatural&quot; achieved in medieval times, as well as on the distinction between grace and freedom worked out by Thomas Aquinas, and so is able to remove all the brackets and return to the truly concrete with a unique synthesis of &quot;Jerusalem and Athens.&quot;

==Honours==
In 1970, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

In 1971, Loyola College, one of Concordia University&#x27;s founding institutions, awarded him the Loyola Medal. Concordia also awarded Lonergan an honorary doctorate in 1977.

== Conferences and journals ==
An annual Lonergan Workshop is held at Boston College, under the leadership of Frederick G. Lawrence. The proceedings of the Workshop are published under the same name, &quot;Lonergan Workshop&quot;, edited by Frederick G. Lawrence. The Workshop began in Lonergan&#x27;s lifetime and continued after his death. The West Coast Methods Institute sponsors the annual Fallon Memorial Lonergan Symposium at Loyola Marymount University. The Lonergan Symposium has been meeting for 32 years.

Boston College has a Lonergan Institute, and also publishes the bi-annual &quot;Method: Journal of Lonergan Studies&quot;. The journal was founded, and edited until 2013, by Mark D. Morelli. The &quot;Lonergan Studies Newsletter&quot; is put out four times a year by the Lonergan Research Institute, Toronto; it provides the most up-to-date bibliographical information on the Lonergan movement. Recently, Seton Hall University has put out &quot;The Lonergan Review&quot;.

Lonergan Centres have been set up in various places (see below, External links). The Lonergan Research Institute at Toronto holds the Lonergan archives as well as a good collection of secondary material, including a complete collection of dissertations on Lonergan&#x27;s work. Much of the primary archival material is available online at the Bernard Lonergan Archive (see below, External links), and a site for secondary material has also been set up, thanks to the work of Robert M. Doran.

<text>Muzaffarnagar (, ) is a city under Muzaffarnagar district in the Indian State of Uttar Pradesh. It is situated midway on the Delhi - Haridwar/Dehradun National Highway (NH 58) and is also well connected with the national railway network. It is known as the sugarbowl of Uttar Pradesh.

The city previously called Sarwat and is located in the middle of the highly fertile upper Ganga-Yamuna Doab region and is very near to New Delhi and Saharanpur, making it one of the most developed and prosperous cities of Uttar Pradesh. It comes under the Saharanpur division. This city is part of Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) and Amritsar Delhi Kolkata Industrial Corridor (ADKIC). It shares its border with the state of Uttarakhand and it is the principal commercial, industrial and educational hub of Western Uttar Pradesh.

==History==

The earliest settlers of Muzaffarnagar and the region around it were Brahmins and Rajputs, followed by later migrations of Jat and Gurjar tribes. The town was established in 1633 by the son of a Mughal Commander Sayyid Muzaffar Khan Barha, otherwise known as Khan-i-Jahan, during the reign of Shah Jahan. At the time Muzaffarnagar was part of the &quot;Barah country&quot; as it was intimately connected with the Indian Muslim kinship group called the Barah Sayyids, who controlled the upper Doab. From Muzaffarnagar, the influential Sayyid brothers became de-facto rulers of the Mughal empire in the 1710s. The Indian Muslim inhabitants of Barha especially from near the town of Jansath were heavily recruited in the Mughal army and in the personal cavalry of the Sayyid Brothers.

In 1901, during the British Raj, it was a district in the Meerut Division in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. In 1947, when the country got independence Indian flag was hoisted for the first time in the Muzaffarnagar City.

On 18 October 1976, during &quot;The Emergency, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s suspension of democracy in India, between 25 and 30 people protesting against compulsory sterilisation were killed when Uttar Pradesh police fired into the crowd.

Once visited for the sight of deer and rabbits and other wild animals, the Cheetal is now encroached by privately owned dhabas and resorts thus sidelining the animals.

<text>The  ( &quot;Old Palace&quot;) is the town hall of Florence, Italy. It overlooks the , which holds a copy of Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; statue, and the gallery of statues in the adjacent Loggia dei Lanzi.

Originally called the &quot;Palazzo della Signoria&quot;, after the Signoria of Florence, the ruling body of the Republic of Florence, this building was also known by several other names: &quot;Palazzo del Popolo&quot;, &quot;Palazzo dei Priori&quot;, and &quot;Palazzo Ducale&quot;, in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history. The building acquired its current name when the Medici duke&#x27;s residence was moved across the Arno River to the Palazzo Pitti.

==History==

In 1299, the commune and people of Florence decided to build a palace that would be worthy of the city&#x27;s importance, and that would be more secure and defensible in times of turbulence for the magistrates of the commune. Arnolfo di Cambio, the architect of the Duomo and the Santa Croce church, began construction upon the ruins of &quot;Palazzo dei Fanti&quot; and &quot;Palazzo dell&#x27;Esecutore di Giustizia&quot;, once owned by the Uberti family. Giovanni Villani (1276–1348) wrote in his &quot;Nuova Cronica&quot; that the Uberti were &quot;rebels of Florence and Ghibellines&quot;, stating that the palazzo was built to ensure that the Uberti family homes would never be rebuilt on the same location.

The cubical building is made of solid rusticated stonework, with two rows of two-lighted Gothic windows, each with a trefoil arch. In the 15th century, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo Michelozzi added decorative bas-reliefs of the cross and the Florentine lily in the spandrels between the trefoils. The building is crowned with projecting crenellated battlements, supported by small arches and corbels. Under the arches are a repeated series of nine painted coats of arms of the Florentine republic. Some of these arches can be used as embrasures (&quot;spiombati&quot;) for dropping heated liquids or rocks on invaders.
The solid, massive building is enhanced by the simple tower with its clock. Giovanni Villani wrote that Arnolfo di Cambio incorporated the ancient tower of the Foraboschi family (the tower then known as &quot;La Vacca&quot; or &quot;The Cow&quot;) into the new tower&#x27;s facade as its substructure; this is why the rectangular tower (height 94 m) is not directly centered in the building. This tower contains two small cells, that, at different times, imprisoned Cosimo de&#x27; Medici (the Elder) (1435) and Girolamo Savonarola (1498). The tower is named after its designer &quot;Torre d&#x27;Arnolfo&quot;. The tower&#x27;s large, one-handed clock was originally constructed in 1353 by the Florentine Nicolò Bernardo, but was replaced in 1667 with a replica made by Georg Lederle from the German town of Augsburg (Italians refer to him as Giorgio Lederle of Augusta) and installed by Vincenzo Viviani.

Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici (later to become grand duke) moved his official seat from the Medici palazzo in via Larga to the Palazzo della Signoria in May 1540, signalling the security of Medici power in Florence. When Cosimo later removed to Palazzo Pitti, he officially renamed his former palace the , the &quot;Old Palace&quot;, although the adjacent town square, the &quot;Piazza della Signoria&quot;, still bears the original name. Cosimo commissioned Giorgio Vasari to build an above-ground walkway, the Vasari corridor, from the , through the Uffizi, over the to the Palazzo Pitti. Cosimo I also moved the seat of government to the Uffizi.

The palace gained new importance as the seat of united Italy&#x27;s provisional government from 1865 to 1871, at a moment when Florence had become the temporary capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Although most of the is now a museum, it remains as the symbol and center of local government; since 1872 it has housed the office of the mayor of Florence, and it is the seat of the City Council. The tower currently has three bells; the oldest was cast in the 13th century.

==Entrance==

Above the front entrance door, there is a notable ornamental marble frontispiece, dating from 1528. In the middle, flanked by two gilded lions, is the Monogram of Christ, surrounded by a glory, above the text (&quot;in Latin&quot;): &quot;Rex Regum et Dominus Dominantium&quot; (translation: &quot;King of Kings and Lord of Lords&quot;. This text dates from 1851 and does not replace an earlier text by Savonarola as mentioned in guidebooks. Between 1529 and 1851 they were concealed behind a large shield with the grand-ducal coat of arms.

Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; also stood at the entrance from its completion in 1504 to 1873, when it was moved to the accademia Gallery. A replica erected in 1910 now stands in its place, flanked by Baccio Bandinelli&#x27;s &quot;Hercules and Cacus&quot;. The statuary present at the entrance of the Palazzo Vecchio is a testament to the fluctuating political atmosphere in Florence from 1504 to 1534, when Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot; and Bandinelli&#x27;s &quot;Hercules and Cacus&quot; were created, respectively. The statuary in front of this political building was commissioned under two different rulers in Florence, &quot;David&quot; under Piero Soderini and &quot;Hercules and Cacus&quot; under the Medici. These statues, thus engage in a fierce dialogue with each other as well as the Florentine public about the socio-political state of Florence under each of the rulers. The statues at the entrance were installed next to each other to perpetuate different political agendas depending on their patron and demonstrate superiority from one regime to the next.

==Courtyards==

===First courtyard===

The first courtyard was designed in 1453 by Michelozzo. In the lunettes, high around the courtyard, are crests of the church and city guilds. In the center, the porphyry fountain is by Battista del Tadda. The &quot;Putto with Dolphin&quot; on top of the basin is a copy of the original by Andrea del Verrocchio (1476), now on display on the second floor of the palace. This small statue was originally placed in the garden of the Villa Medici at Careggi. The water, flowing through the nose of the dolphin, is brought here by pipes from the Boboli Gardens.

In the niche, in front of the fountain, stands &quot;Samson and Philistine&quot; by Pierino da Vinci.

The frescoes on the walls are vedute of the cities of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy, painted in 1565 by Giorgio Vasari for the wedding celebration of Francesco I de&#x27; Medici, the eldest son of Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, to Archduchess Johanna of Austria, sister of the Emperor Maximilian II. Amongst the cities depicted are Graz, Innsbruck, Linz, Vienna, Bratislava (Pozsony), Prague, Hall in Tirol, Freiburg im Breisgau and Konstanz. Some were damaged over the course of time.

The harmoniously proportioned columns, at one time smooth, and untouched, were at the same time richly decorated with gilt stuccoes.

The barrel vaults are furnished with grotesque decorations.

===Second courtyard===
The second courtyard, also called &quot;The Customs&quot;, contains the massive pillars built in 1494 by Cronaca that sustains the great &quot;Salone dei Cinquecento&quot; on the second floor.

===Third courtyard===
The third courtyard was used mainly for offices of the city. Between the first and second courtyard the massive and monumental stairs by Vasari lead up to the &quot;Salone dei Cinquecento&quot;.

== Salone dei Cinquecento ==

The Salone dei Cinquecento (&quot;Hall of the Five Hundred&quot;) is the largest and most imposing chamber in the Palazzo Vecchio. It measures approximately 52 meters (170 feet) in length, 23 meters (75 feet) in width, and 18 meters (59 feet) in height. However, another source (page 54, footnote 6) provides slightly different dimensions, specifying a width of 22.15 meters and a length of 51.61 meters along the east wall and 53.47 meters along the west wall.

The &quot;Salone dei Cinquecento&quot; was built in 1494 by Simone del Pollaiolo, on commission of Savonarola who, replacing the Medici after their exile as the spiritual leader of the Republic, wanted it as a seat of the &quot;Grand Council&quot; (&quot;Consiglio Maggiore&quot;) consisting of 500 members.

Later, the hall was enlarged by Giorgio Vasari so that Grand Duke Cosimo I could hold his court in this chamber. During this transformation, famous (but unfinished) works were lost, including the &quot;Battle of Cascina&quot; by Michelangelo, and the &quot;Battle of Anghiari&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo was commissioned in 1503 to paint one long wall with a battle scene celebrating a famous Florentine victory. He was always trying new methods and materials and decided to mix wax into his pigments. Da Vinci had finished painting part of the wall, but it was not drying fast enough, so he brought in braziers stoked with hot coals to try to hurry the process. A legend exists that Giorgio Vasari, wanting to preserve Da Vinci&#x27;s work, had a false wall built over the top of &quot;The Battle of Anghiari&quot; before painting his fresco. Attempts to find Da Vinci&#x27;s original work behind the Vasari fresco have so far been inconclusive.

Michelangelo never proceeded beyond the preparatory drawings for the fresco he was commissioned to paint on the opposite wall. Pope Julius II called him to Rome to paint the Sistine Chapel, and the master&#x27;s sketches were destroyed by eager young artists who came to study them and took away scraps. The surviving decorations in this hall were made between 1555 and 1572 by Giorgio Vasari and his helpers, among them Livio Agresti from Forlì. They mark the culmination of mannerism and make this hall the showpiece of the palace.

It has been stated that the &quot;Salone dei Cinquecento&quot; is the largest hall in Italy by volume. However, Padova’s &quot;Palazzo della Ragione&quot; is 81,5 m long, 27 m wide and 24 m high. Even though &quot;Salone dei Cinquecento&quot; with its flat ceiling is close to parallelepiped and &quot;Palazzo della Ragione&quot;’s hall with open roof is not, the latter&#x27;s bounding box at 52 800 cubic m is 145% bigger than the 21 500 cubic m of &quot;Salone di Cinquecento&quot; (and likely to be larger even accounting for the roof). 


On the walls are large and expansive frescoes that depict battles and military victories by Florence over Pisa and Siena:
*&quot;The Taking of Siena&quot;
*&quot;The Conquest of Porto Ercole&quot;
*&quot;The Victory of Cosimo I at Marciano in Val di Chiana&quot;
*&quot;Defeat of the Pisans at the Tower of San Vincenzo&quot;
*&quot;Maximilian of Austria Attempts the Conquest of Leghorn&quot;
*&quot;Pisa Attacked by the Florentine Troops&quot;
The ceiling consists of 39 panels constructed and painted by Vasari and his assistants, representing &quot;Great Episodes from the life of Cosimo I&quot;, the quarters of the city, and the city itself. Toward the center is the apotheosis: &quot;Scene of His Glorification as Grand Duke of Florence and Tuscany&quot;.

On the north side of the hall, illuminated by enormous windows, is the raised stage called the &quot;Udienza&quot;, built by Bartolommeo Bandinelli for Cosimo I as a place to receive citizens and ambassadors. Above are frescoes of historical events; among these, that of Boniface VIII receiving the ambassadors of foreign States and, seeing that were all Florentines, saying: &quot;You Florentines are the quintessence.&quot;

In the niches are sculptures by Bandinelli: in the center the statue of the seated &quot;Leo X&quot; (sculpted assisted by his student Vincenzo de&#x27; Rossi), and on the right a statue of &quot;Charles V crowned by Clement VII&quot;. The six statues along the walls that represent the &quot;Labors of Hercules&quot; are by de&#x27; Rossi.

In the central niche at the south of the Hall is Michelangelo&#x27;s noted marble group &quot;The Genius of Victory&quot; (1533–1534), originally intended for the tomb of Julius II. The statue was placed in this hall by Vasari. In 1868 it was removed to the Bargello Museum, but was returned in 1921 by officials.

===Studiolo of Francesco I===
At the end of the hall is a small side room without windows. The studiolo was a small secret study designed by Vasari in a manneristic style (1570–1575). The walls and the barrel vault are filled with paintings, stucco and sculptures. Most paintings are by the School of Vasari and represent the four elements: fire, water, earth, and air. The portrait of Cosimo I and his wife Eleonora of Toledo was painted by Bronzino. The delicate bronze sculptures were made by Giambologna and Bartolomeo Ammanati. From a peep-hole, Francesco spied on his ministers and officers during meetings in the Salone dei Cinquecento. Dismantled within decades of its construction, it was re-assembled in the 20th century.

The other rooms on the first floor are the &quot;Quartieri monumentali&quot;. These rooms, the Residence of the Priors and the Quarters of Leo X, are used by the mayor as offices and reception rooms. They are not accessible to the public.

==Second Floor==
A staircase designed by Vasari leads to the second floor. This floor contains the Apartments of the Elements, Priori, and Eleonora of Toledo.

===Apartments of the Elements===
These apartments (&quot;Sala degli Elementi&quot;) consist of five rooms (such as the Room of Ceres) and two loggias. The commission for these rooms was originally given by Cosimo I to Giovanni Battista del Tasso. But on his death, the decorations were continued by Vasari and his helpers, working for the first time for the Medicis. These rooms were the private quarters of Cosimo I.

====Room of the Elements====
The walls in the Room of the Elements are filled with allegorical frescoes &quot;Allegories of Water, Fire and Earth&quot; and, on the ceiling, represents &quot;Saturn&quot;.

The original statue &quot;Boy with a Fish&quot; by Verrocchio is on exhibit in one of the smaller rooms (the copy stands on the fountain in the first courtyard).

====Terrace of Saturn====
Named for the fresco on the ceiling. Has a fabulous view of Florence. There is a southeastern view to Piazzale Michelangelo and the Fortress Belvedere. Also visible are the remains of the Church of San Piero Scheraggio.

====The Hercules Room====
This room (the Sala di Ercole) gets its name from the subject of the paintings on the ceiling. Also the tapestries show stories of Hercules. The room contains a &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; and an ebony cabinet called a &quot;stipo&quot; inlaid with semi-precious stones.

====The Lion House====
Cosimo the Elder kept a menagerie of lions in a dedicated lion house in the palazzo. He often fought them or baited them against other animals in large festivals for visiting Popes or dignitaries.

====The Room of Jupiter====
The room is named for the fresco on the ceiling. On the walls are Florentine tapestries made from cartoons by Stradanus (16th century).

====The Room of Cybele====
On the ceiling, the &quot;Triumph of Cybele&quot; and the &quot;Four Seasons&quot;. Against the walls are cabinets in tortoise shell and bronze. The floor was made in 1556. From the window one can see the third courtyard.

====The Ceres Room====
The room gets its name from the motif on the ceiling, by Doceno, a pupil of Vasari. On the walls are Florentine tapestries with hunting scenes, from cartoons by Stradanus.

===Apartments of Eleonora of Toledo===
Beginning in 1540 when Cosimo moved the seat of government here, these rooms were refurbished and richly decorated to be the living quarters of Eleonora.

====Sala Verde====
This room served as Eleonora&#x27;s bedchamber and was called the Green Room because of the color of the walls. The decorations on the ceiling are by Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio. A small door in the room indicates the beginning of the Vasari corridor, a passageway to the Palazzo Pitti built by Vasari for Cosimo I.

====Cappella di Eleonora====

The small, richly decorated chapel adjoining the Sala Verde is painted in fresco by the mannerist Angelo Bronzino and includes some of his masterpieces including the Crossing the Red Sea. It was built by Tasso to be Eleonora&#x27;s private chapel.

====The Room of the Sabines====
It was named because of the ceiling decoration. At one time it was used for the Ladies-in-waiting at the court of Eleonora di Toledo. It contains &quot;Portraits of Medici Princes&quot; by Sustermans, statues by a Florentine art school and a tapestry by Fevère.

====Dining Room====
On the ceiling is the &quot;Coronation of Esther&quot; decorated by Stradanus, with an inscription in honor of Eleonora di Toledo. The room contains a lavabo and two tapestries by Van Assel representing &quot;Spring and Autumn&quot;.

====The Room of Penelope====
On the ceiling &quot;Penelope at the loom&quot;, in the frieze, &quot;episodes from the Odyssey&quot;. On the walls: &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; and a &quot;Madonna and Child with St. John&quot; by Botticelli.

====The Room of Gualdrada====
This room is dedicated to Virtue as personified by Gualdrada. The ceiling painting of Gualdrada is by the Flemish painter Stradanus, better known under his Italian name Stradanus. Against the wall is a cabinet with Florentine mosaic designs.

===Apartments of the Priori===
These rooms were used by the &quot;priori&quot; (priors) representing the guilds of Florence.

====Sala dell&#x27;Udienza====

The Audience Chamber or Hall of Justice used to house the meetings of the priors. It contains the oldest decorations in the palace.

The carved coffer ceiling, laminated with pure gold, is by Giuliano da Maiano (1470–1476). On the portal to the Chapel of the Signoria is an inscription in honor of Christ (1529). The doorway to the Hall of Lilies has marble mouldings sculpted by the brothers Giuliano and Benedetto da Maiano. The inlaid woodwork (intarsia) on the doors was carved by Del Francione and depicts portraits of Dante and Petrarch.

The large frescoes on the walls portraying the &quot;Stories of Furius Camillus&quot; by Francesco Salviati were made in the middle of the 16th century. Since Salviati had his schooling in the circle around Raphael in Rome, these frescoes are based on Roman models and not typical of Florentine art. Marcus Furius Camillus was a Roman general mentioned in the writings of Plutarch.

====Chapel of the Signoria====
A small doorway leads into the adjoining small chapel dedicated to St. Bernard, containing a reliquary of the Saint. Here the priors used to supply divine aid in the execution of their duties. In this chapel, Girolamo Savonarola said his last prayers before he was hanged on the Piazza della Signoria and his body burned.

The frescoes on the walls and ceiling, on a background imitating gold mosaic, are by Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. Of particular interest are &quot;The Holy Trinity&quot; on the ceiling and &quot;The Annunciation&quot; on the wall facing the altar. On the altar was a painting representing the &quot;Holy Family&quot; by Mariano Graziadei da Pescia, a pupil of Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. It is now on exhibition in the corridor of the Uffizi Gallery. Instead, there is a good painting of St. Bernard by an unknown artist.

====Sala dei Gigli====

The carved ceiling of the Hall of the Lilies, as this room is usually called, decorated with &quot;fleur-de-lys&quot;, and the &quot;Statue of St. John the Baptist and Putti&quot; are all by Benedetto da Maiano and his brother Giuliano. The golden fleur-de-lys decorations on blue background on the ceiling and three walls refer to the (short-lived) good relations between Florence and the French Crown.
On the wall are frescoes by Domenico Ghirlandaio, painted in 1482. The apotheosis of St. Zenobius, first patron saint of Florence, was painted with a perspectival illusion of the background. In this background one can see the cathedral, with Giotto&#x27;s original facade and bell tower. In the lunette above is a bas-relief of the Madonna and Child. This fresco is flanked on both sides by frescoes of famed Romans: on the left &quot;Brutus, Gaius Mucius Scaevola and Camillus&quot;, and on the right &quot;Decius, Scipio and Cicero&quot;. Medaillons of Roman emperors fill the spandrels between the sections.

After its lengthy restoration, the (original) statue &quot;Judith and Holofernes&quot; by Donatello was given a prominent place in this room in 1988.

A door in the east wall leads to the &quot;Stanza della Guardaroba&quot; (Hall of Geographical Maps). This door is flanked by two dark marble pillars, originally from a Roman temple.

====Stanza delle Mappe geografiche o Stanza della Guardaroba====
The Hall of Geographical Maps or &quot;Guardaroba&quot; was an ambitious room that set out to represent the known world of the 16th century through the display of a collection of artifacts and murals of cartography, all seen in relation to scientific instruments of time and astronomy. For various reasons, it was not seen to completion, yet the accounts of Giorgio Vasari, the room&#x27;s designer, detail the proposed purpose and visualisation of the space. The Guardaroba was commissioned by Cosimo I de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany during his major reconstruction of the interior of the Palazzo. Construction of the &quot;guardaroba&quot; began in 1563.

The idea behind the guardaroba is similar to that of late medieval studioli, which were small private study spaces, containing precious collected artifacts. Many courtly residences possessed similar spaces to the &quot;guardaroba&quot;, yet the guardaroba of Palazzo della Signoria is one of the earliest examples that integrates cartography into its decorative elements.

&quot;Guardaroba&quot; best translates to a type of storage space, or ‘wardrobe’ and its purpose was to house a collection; an early &quot;wunderkammer&quot; of sorts. Evidently, collections of artifacts and precious items existed before the Renaissance, yet it is not until the Renaissance that there consistently appeared collections which were preserved and interpreted, known as wunderkammen. Vasari&#x27;s account of the program for the guardaroba highlights Cosimo I&#x27;s instructions to create a space for some of the more precious items in the Medici collection. He had also instructed Vasari to design the space so it was fit for visitors, ultimately becoming a semi-public gallery space.

Master carpenter Dionigi di Matteo Nigetti (active in Florence 1565–1579) constructed the finely crafted and carved walnut cabinets and ceiling panels that can still all be found in the room today. Each of the doors was to be decorated with an up-to-date map of a particular region. Vasari called the map murals, Tables of Ptolemy, recognising Claudius Ptolemaeus (AD b.127–d.145) significant contributions to the history and progress of cartography. The responsibility of painting the Tables of Ptolemy was entrusted to renowned cosmographer Egnazio Danti, who was later responsible for the maps in the Vatican Galleria, Hall of Maps. Each map mural, of which there were to be 57 in total, was painted directly onto the cabinet doors, 53 of these Murals remain today. The regions depicted in the map would correspond to a collection of objects and artifacts within that cabinet. The map murals were arranged across the cabinet doors in two horizontal rows representing the hemispheres and navigated most of the perimeter of the room, only interrupted at the doorway and window. A layout of maps in this fashion came to be known as a &quot;map cycle&quot;, a term Cosimo I&#x27;s guardaroba likely initiated. The map cycle is divided into sections of the then known four continents, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. The &quot;guardaroba&quot; was one of the more unusual projects commissioned by Cosimo I and therefore, Vasari wrote concisely on its programme and its progress.

&quot;Over the doors of those cupboards within their ornaments, Fra Egnazio has distributed fifty seven pictures about two braccia high and wide in proportion, in which are painted in oils on the wood with the greatest diligence, after the manner of miniatures, the Tables of Ptolemy, all measured with perfect accuracy and corrected after the most recent authorities, with exact charts of navigation and their scales for measuring and degrees, done with supreme diligence; and with these are all the names both ancient and modern. ... The images of plants and animals are exactly in line with the maps. ... The terrestrial globe is marked distinctly and it is possible to use it for all the operations of the astrolabe perfectly.&quot; – Giorgio Vasari, &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;

As well as the maps on the cabinets, other images adorned the room. Up to 300 portraits of famous people of the day hung around highest perimeters of the walls and would be revealed from beneath green cloth curtains. In between the cabinets doors, were to be mounted natural history drawings of flora and fauna that, as Vasari indicated above, would have been in line with its corresponding regions on the maps in a similar fashion to the objects that are revealed from beneath their corresponding region. The collected artifacts were arranged and maintained by curators and conservators known as guardarobiere, in a similar manner to the role of the contemporary museum.

The rarer an item, the more attractive it was to the collector and desired for the collection. Objects from the Americas or New World as it was then referred to, were particularly valuable at this time as Italians were not allowed to travel there without permission from Spain or Portugal. Instead, they explored this region vicariously through objects and the Medici possessed a significant collection of artifacts from the Americas, largely collecting featherwork.

Vasari intended the worldly representation in the &quot;guardaroba&quot; to be seen in relation to the larger cosmos, represented by a celestial sphere in the centre of the room and painted constellations on the ceiling. He also had grand visions of two large globes, a terrestrial and celestial hidden behind a false ceiling that could be lowered impressively via a pulley system into the room below. The room was also to display a copy of the 1484 clock made for Lorenzo de Medici by Lorenzo della Volpaia. An Antonio Santucci (b.? d.1613) armillary sphere that is now at the Florence Museum of the History of Science, was also displayed in the &quot;guardaroba&quot; along with a second, earlier armillary sphere that is now lost. It is the relationships between these objects and maps and the context for which they are shown that produces intended symbolic gestures; the clock, in relation to the maps, in relation to the celestial representations were an attempt to generate an effect of possessed knowledge over all space and time and in the case of the guardaroba, Cosimo I de Medici was to be seen as the possessor and purveyor of this knowledge, generating a narrative of his power.

A digital reconstruction of the room, as it was designed and described by Giorgio Vasari can be found here.

====Old Chancellery====

This was Machiavelli&#x27;s office when he was Secretary of the Republic. His polychrome bust in terracotta and his portrait are by Santi di Tito. They are probably modelled on his death mask.
In the center of the room, on the pedestal is the famous &quot;Winged Boy with a Dolphin&quot; by Verrocchio, brought to this room from the First Courtyard.

==Mezzanine==
Located in between the first and second floors, these rooms are occupied by Renaissance and Medieval objects given in a bequest by Charles Loeser, an American expat collector and scholar. This collection is one of the most valuable municipal collections for its artistic and historical value. The rooms are located in the old palace, and were renovated in the mid-15th century by Michelozzo. It is the only part of the palace where the original 14th- and 15th-century ceilings are still entirely visible. Cosimo I&#x27;s mother Maria Salviati lived in these rooms after Cosimo moved the family from Palazzo Medici to the (at that point Palazzo Ducale).

The first room holds a &quot;Madonna con Bambino e san Giovannino&quot;, from the school of Lorenzo di Credi, a &quot;Madonna col Bambino&quot; in stucco painted in the Florentine school in the 15th century, a &quot;Madonna in Adoration by Christ with Saint Giovannino&quot; by Jacopo del Sellaio, a &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; attributed to Master of the Griggs Crucifix (15th century), and a &quot;Madonna Enthroned&quot; by the Tuscan school of the 14th century. Above the stone steps is a little room that was for a time a studiolo for Cosimo I. The window looks out over and the room is decorated with birds, animals, fishes, and vegetal elements works by Bachiacca.

The dining room holds one of the most famous works of the Loeser Collection, &quot;The Portrait of Laura Battiferri&quot; (wife of Bartolomeo Ammannati), by famous Renaissance painter Bronzino around 1555. Adjacent is another Mannerist work, &quot;The Portrait of Ludovico Martelli&quot;, by a follower of Pontormo, possibly Michele Tosini. There is also a small sketch on fresco, &quot;Battle of the Knights&quot; for Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Defeat of the Pisans at the Tower of Saint Vincent&quot;, by a student Giovan Francesco Naldini, which used to be displayed on the balcony above the Salone dei Cinquecento by Vasari&#x27;s complementary monumental work. By the fireplace are two Romanesque sculptures, a capital with an eagle (first half of the 13th century) and a Coronation Head (first half of 12th century).

In the corner room, three Madonna and Children paintings are on display. The first, &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; is by the Master of Saints Flora and Lucilla, from the 14th century. The second, &quot;Madonna and Child with Saint Little Saint John&quot; is a later Renaissance work by Spanish artist Alonso Berruguete from 1514 to 1518, and the third is &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; by prominent Sienese artist Pietro Lorenzetti. This room also holds &quot;Adoring Angel&quot; by Tino di Camaino from around 1321, a &quot;Bust of Saint Antonino&quot; in painted plaster from the 15th century, and an embroidery designed by Raffaellino del Garbo.

== Multaka network ==
In 2019, the museum joined six similar museums in Germany, the United Kingdom, Greece and Switzerland, creating the international Multaka network. This intercultural museum project organizes guided tours for refugees and migrants designed and offered for free by specially trained Arabic-speaking Multaka guides. The visitor-centered discussions with migrants in their language are focused on the historical origin and history of acquisition of cultural objects, including the visitors&#x27; own understanding of their country&#x27;s cultural heritage.

<text>Prince Lincoln Thompson, known as Sax (10 July 1949 in Jonestown, Kingston, Jamaica – 14 January 1999 in London, England), was a Jamaican singer, musician and songwriter with the reggae band the Royal Rasses, and a member of the Rastafari movement. He was noted for his high falsetto singing voice, very different from his spoken voice.

==Career==
He began his recording career as a harmony singer along with Cedric Myton of The Congos in 1967, in a band called The Tartans, who then split up in 1969. In 1971 he was taken on by Coxsone Dodd, and recorded three songs with him at Studio One called &quot;Daughters of Zion&quot;, &quot;True Experience&quot; and &quot;Live Up to Your Name&quot;. In 1974, he recorded the &quot;Humanity&quot; album with Cedric Myton, Clinton Hall and Keith Peterkin, and set up the God Sent label. 
He had two hit singles with &quot;Kingston 11&quot; and &quot;Love the Way It Should Be&quot;. 

In 2010, the song, &quot;Humanity (Love the Way It Should Be)&quot; was covered by the American singer John Legend backed by the Philadelphia band, The Roots, and was featured on Legend&#x27;s album, &quot;Wake Up!&quot;.

Prince Lincoln received a record deal in 1978, he was signed up by Mo Claridge, who at the time ran Ballistics Records, a London offshoot of United Artists, and who noticed his &quot;eerie falsetto&quot;. A single &quot;Unconventional People&quot; was released as a 12-inch single in March 1979 with the &quot;Humanity&quot; album following in May. In mid 1979, the Royal Rasses recorded a second Prince Lincoln album, &quot;Experience&quot;, this time without Cedric Myton. This album contained more than just the traditional drum and bass sound of most reggae. The band renamed themselves the Rasses to avoid confusion with fellow reggae band The Royals to record a further album called &quot;Natural Wild&quot; in 1980. This time the music was recorded in London. Prince Lincoln&#x27;s decision to invite English rock musician Joe Jackson was controversial, and the album was a commercial flop.

Thompson returned to Jamaica and re-set up the successful God Sent label, with the help of German company Juicy Peeple to produce his fourth album, &quot;Ride with the Rasses&quot; in 1982. This music was recorded at Tuff Gong and Channel One studios. Around this time he and his family moved to Tottenham, London, England, where he opened an Ital shop called The Rasses Fish Mart and Grocery Store. In September 1983, he recorded &quot;Rootsman Blues&quot; in Addis Ababa studio in London. It was released by Target Records with only three musicians per track, giving the music the intimate quality of chamber music.

He released a final album, &quot;21st Century&quot; in 1997 after someone from the United States heard the music in Prince Lincoln&#x27;s shop, and agreed to become a sponsor. This final album was also recorded in London.

Thompson died in January 1999, in London, at the age of 49.

<text>Palisa is the remnant of a lunar impact crater that is located to the west of the walled plain Ptolemaeus. It lies to the north-northeast of the crater Davy, and is attached to the lava-flooded satellite crater Davy Y by a wide break in the southwest rim. The crater is named after the Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa.

The rim of Palisa is worn and eroded, especially in the western half where there are multiple gaps that join the crater floor to the Mare Nubium to the west. The interior is nearly flat, and marked only by a pair of tiny craterlets in the southwest gap. The larger of this crater pair is designated Palisa P. Additional satellite craterlets D, A, and W lie just outside the northeast rim.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Palisa.

<text>Robert Earl Hughes (June 4, 1926 – July 10, 1958) was an American man who was, during his lifetime, the heaviest human being recorded, weighing . He remains the heaviest human in the world able to walk without the need of assistance.

==Early life and family==
Robert Hughes was born in Monticello, Missouri, the son of Abraham Guy Hughes (1878–1957) and Georgia Alice Weatharby (1906–1947). He was born &quot;weighing a hefty but not abnormal&quot; and was a &quot;fairly average-size baby until he contracted whooping cough at about five months old.&quot;

The family moved to Fishhook, Illinois, when Robert was six months old.

==Career==
Hughes made some income from selling photographs of himself. During his adult life, Hughes made guest appearances at carnivals and fairs. At age 27, he joined a traveling roadshow, often accompanied by some of his family. Plans to appear on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; variety television program were announced but never materialized.

In 1957, traveling with his brother Guy and Guy&#x27;s wife Lillian, Hughes had bookings throughout the country. Walking, even with his massive cane, had started to be difficult for the 31-year-old. While at a carnival, word reached Hughes that his father had died at age 79 back in Illinois. Guy and Lillian returned to Illinois for the funeral, but Robert stayed on, believing it was his duty to honour his commitments. At season&#x27;s end, he returned to Guy&#x27;s farm, unable to walk more than without the assistance of family members, who would follow closely, lugging a wide, steel-reinforced chair in case of exhaustion.

==Death==
While traveling with the roadshow in Nappanee, Indiana, Hughes developed a rash, and the flesh under his fingernails turned blue. Because he was unable to be moved to the nearest hospital in Bremen, Indiana, doctors treated him at his trailer, and determined he was suffering from measles. He developed uremia.

He died on July 10, 1958, at the age of 32. He was buried in a small church cemetery in Benville, Illinois, in Brown County near his hometown, Fishhook. About 2,000 people attended the funeral.

<text>Eos Press is an American game publisher named for the ancient Greek goddess of the dawn. It was established in 2001 in Seattle, Washington, as &quot;Hawthornn Hobgoblynn Press&quot;. Eos has operations in Suzhou (China), Taiwan and Singapore.

==History==
Financier and businessman Hsin Chen and Aron Anderson (game designer and owner of &quot;The Dreaming&quot;, a Seattle comic and game store) founded Hawthorn Hobgoblynn Press on January 12, 2001, to publish &quot;Godlike&quot;, a game created by their friends Dennis Detwiller and Greg Stolze. In 2003 they renamed the company &quot;Eos Press&quot; and business manager Brad Elliott became the third partner. Brad Elliott left the company in March, 2009, and the company was reformed by Hsin Chen (owner and director); adding Jesse Covner (partner and general manager) and David Ramirez (game project manager).

In 2010, Eos signed famed role playing game (RPG) designer and Nobilis creator Jenna Moran in an exclusive contract to create games and properties. Eos published the third edition of Nobilis and a supplement.

In 2015, Jenna Moran cut ties with Eos because of deceptive behavior by the company and repeated non-delivery of books paid for by the &quot;Chuubo&#x27;s Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine&quot; Kickstarter. Later in the year, an anonymous donor contributed money to Jenna Moran so that print on demand copies could be distributed independently of Eos.

As of 2020, the company is inactive and may be defunct, as the website has not been updated since 2017.

==Products==
Notable Eos Press products are card games&quot; Abuse: The Final Insult&quot;; &quot;Creatures and Cultists&quot; and &quot;The Wormwood Tarot&quot;, a Victorian, gothic tarot set.
Eos also publishes RPGs, including &quot;Godlike&quot;, under the name &quot;Hobgoblynn&quot;, as well as &quot;Unhallowed Metropolis&quot;, a game of neovictorian horror. &quot;Weapons of the Gods&quot;, the first licensed RPG published by Eos, is a Wuxia game inspired by the eponymous comic.

<text>Tempel is the remnant of a lunar impact crater whose outer rim has been eroded, indented, and reshaped by subsequent impacts and lava flows. It is attached to the eastern rim of the crater Agrippa, in an area that has been resurfaced by old lava flows. To the southwest is Godin, and to the east lies the small, bowl-shaped Whewell. Its diameter is 43 km. The crater was named after German astronomer Wilhelm Tempel.

There is a gap in the northwestern rim of Tempel that forms a protrusion that follows the rim of Agrippa. Smaller gaps exist in the southern rim, and the relatively flat interior surface of the crater is joined by these valley clefts to the lava-covered exterior. From here the flow can be followed eastwards until it joins the Mare Tranquillitatis. Little of the original rim remains intact, and the formation is now a somewhat circular range of rounded, irregular ridges.

<text>[[Koninklijk]]e DSM N.V. (Royal DSM, commonly known as DSM, which is the acronym for &quot;Dutch State Mines&quot;), was a Dutch multinational corporation active in the fields of health, nutrition and materials. Headquartered in Maastricht, at the end of 2017 DSM employed 21,054 people in approximately 50 countries and posted net sales of €8.632 billion in 2018 and €9.204 billion in 2021. In May 2023, it merged with the Swiss company Firmenich to form a new entity named dsm-firmenich.

==History==
DSM was formed by the Dutch state in 1902 to mine coal reserves in southern Limburg and although the company had diversified into commodity chemicals and petrochemicals by 1973, when the last mine closed, DSM retains a link to its origins by continuing to use the initials, originally an abbreviation for Dutch State Mines, to this day.

During World War II researchers worked on penicillin. The code name Bacinol was used to keep the research secret from the Germans. The research was done at the company Nederlandsche Gist- en Spiritusfabriek, Dutch Yeast and Spirits Factory, later becoming DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals, in Delft.

In 1989, the government floated 70% of its shares in the company on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange (now Euronext Amsterdam) with the remaining 30% floated in 1996, thereby completing DSM&#x27;s privatization. The 21st century has seen DSM follow successive five-year strategic periods of portfolio transformation and internationalization involving acquisitions, divestments and partnerships. In 2001, 48% of DSM&#x27;s workforce was based in the Netherlands; in 2017, this was 18%.

In 2022, DSM and Swiss privately owned group Firmenich announced their intention to form a &quot;merger of equals&quot; to form a new group named &quot;dsm-firmenich&quot;.

<text>Mescalero or Mescalero Apache () is an Apache tribe of Southern Athabaskan–speaking Native Americans. The tribe is federally recognized as the Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Apache Reservation, located in south-central New Mexico.

In the 19th century, the Mescalero opened their reservation to other Apache tribes, such as the Mimbreno (Chíhéńde, Warm Springs Apaches) and the Chiricahua (Shá’i’áńde or Chidikáágu). Some Lipan Apache (Tú’édįnéńde and Túntsańde) also joined the reservation. Their descendants are enrolled in the Mescalero Apache Tribe.

==Reservation==
Originally established on May 27, 1873, by executive order of President Ulysses S. Grant, the reservation was first located near Fort Stanton (Zhúuníidu). The present reservation was established in 1883. It has a land area of 1,862.463 km2 (719.101 sq mi), almost entirely in Otero County. The 463,000-acre reservation lies on the eastern flank of the Sacramento Mountains and borders the Lincoln National Forest. A small, unpopulated section is in Lincoln County just southwest of Ruidoso (Tsé tághe&#x27; si&#x27;â-yá). U.S. Route 70 is the major highway through the reservation.

Given that the Mescalero Tribal lands in the Lincoln National Forest are ranked as one of the most beautiful scenic locations in the world, much of the tribal economy is in hospitality and tourism. The trades and ranching also contribute to their growing economy. With a growing technology sector their Native Innovation Centers and multi state University Consortiums will soon provide a robust research and development sector to their economy.

The Mescalero Department of Resource Management and Land Development celebrated 60 years of success in 2022 on the 20th anniversary of their two premier tourist destination resorts. The Mescalero designed, developed and own the Inn of the Mountain Gods (IMG) Casino and Golf Resort within the Lincoln National Forest. 
The Mescalero designed, developed, own and operate Ski Apache Resort in the Sierra Blanca Mountains. This is the southern most large ski resort in New Mexico. 
The Mescalero ownership and management of these facilities including all of the Alpine Sports including equestrian center and zip lines requires effective resource management. They reflect the entrepreneurial vision and resilience of the Mescalero Tribe. These resorts are premier destination tourism spots according to New Mexico, US, North American and global travel guides. Native American heritage combined with one-of-a kind resorts that features hand made cultural accessories to high tech operations. The mountains and foothills are forested with pines; resource and commercial development are managed carefully by the Mescalero Apache Tribal Council. The Mescalero Apache developed a cultural center near the tribal headquarters on U.S. Route 70 in the reservation&#x27;s largest community of Mescalero. On display are tribal artifacts and important historical information. The tribe also operates another, larger museum on the western flank of the Sacramento Mountains in Dog Canyon, south of Alamogordo (T&#x27;iis ntsaadz-í &#x27;úú&#x27;á).
New museums and exhibits are being planned to fully capture the Mescalero Space Innovation integration capabilities through partnerships with the New Mexico Space Consortium, Spaceport America, NASA, other commercial space companies, the Intl Institute for Homeland Security Defense and US military partners (Air Force-AFRL and Space Force) the Mescalero Apache Space Innovation and Integration Centers.

The ski area is situated adjacent to the massive peak of Sierra Blanca (Dziãgais&#x27;â-ní = &quot;sacred mountain&quot;) a mountain. It is the southernmost alpine peak in the continental United States, and is part of the Sacramento Mountains. Using the EPA&#x27;s Level III Ecoregion System, derived from Omernik, this mountain is included in the Arizona/New Mexico Mountains, which are south of the Southern Rocky Mountains of northern New Mexico. Sierra Blanca Peak, located on the reservation, is sacred ground for the Mescalero Apache Tribe. They do not allow access without a permit.

==Tribal government==

The Mescalero Apache Tribe holds elections for the office of president every two years. The eight tribal council members also are elected for two years. Strong woman leadership is welcomed and encouraged in the Mescalero Apache Tribal Council. Election for the council is held every year, when one half of the members are up for re-election. The Apache nation of over 64,000 coordinate with each other through tribal meetings. The tribe comprised over 12,468 with 8,652 according to the United States Census.

In 1959, the tribe elected Virginia Klinekole as its first woman president. She later was elected to the tribal council, serving on it until 1986. The tribe repeatedly re-elected Wendell Chino as president; he served a total of 43 years, until his death on November 4, 1998.

Soon after Chino&#x27;s death, the late Sara Misquez was elected as president. Chino&#x27;s son, Mark Chino, also has been elected and served as president.

In 2022, Eddie Martinez was sworn in as the new president of the Mescalero Apache tribe. Leadership from Holloman Airforce Base attended the tribal council ceremony for the newly elected president, officers, and Tribal Council. Kelton Starr, retired Army veteran and Tribal Defense Liaison maintained coordination with the Defense Research Labs and US military bases in New Mexico. The new leadership was focused on building on past successes and accelerating economic development projects with a new focus on Native Innovation and the “Made-in-Native-America” campaign. Martinez was appointed chair of the Native American Regional Commission (comprising all 34 states with Federally recognized tribes) to accelerate economic security, development, and defense projects that benefit the Mescalero Apache Tribe and all Native American and other Indigenous peoples.

In 2024, Thora Walsh Padilla serves as the tribe&#x27;s president alongside Vice President Duane Duffy.

==Culture and language==

The Mescalero language is a Southern Athabaskan language which is a subfamily of the Athabaskan and Dené–Yeniseian families. Mescalero is part of the southwestern branch of this subfamily; it is very closely related to Chiricahua, and more distantly related to Western Apache. These are considered the three dialects of Apachean. Although Navajo is a related Southern Athabaskan language, its language and culture are considered distinct from those of the Apache.

The Mescalero Apache were primarily a nomadic mountain people. They were innovative warriors, stealth, fierce, precise and tactical. Their capabilities are forever recognized as superior military tactics. Modern defense industrial base utilizes this irregular warfare precision and “brand” in naming the most superior military aircraft i.e. the Boeing Manufactured Apache helicopter, the Sikorsky Blackhawk etc. after the Native Americans. 
They traveled east on the arid plains to hunt the buffalo and south into the desert for gathering Mescal Agave. Spanish colonists associated them with this plant and named them Mescalero Apache. The Mescalero Apache, along with the other Apache groups, lived by traditional hunting and gathering. The Mescalero Apache culture protected the ecology and were able to utilize their resources very effectively.

The Mescalero Apache relied on hunting and gathering for subsistence. Men led the hunting parties for buffalo, antelope, and deer. Women accompanied men and dressed the meat and skins and would also participate in the hunting of small game such as rabbits. Women would gather Mescal Agave in groups of 4–10 people, mainly consisting of female friends and family members and usually several men. Men would also take an active role in the processing of mescal.

Family descent was matrilineal, but men&#x27;s heritage would be remembered especially if there was a famous warrior in his lineage. Extended families consisted of grandparents, unmarried children, and their remarried daughters&#x27; nuclear families. The Mescalero also practiced matrilocal residence patterns. When a woman married, the couple would move into a new tipi or wickiup close to her parents&#x27; home.

The Mescalero&#x27;s autonym, or name for themselves, is Shis-Inday (&quot;People of the Mountain Forests&quot;) or Mashgaléńde / Mashgaléneí (&quot;People close to the mountains&quot; or &quot;Mescalero Apache People&quot;). The Navajo (in Mescalero: ’Indaa’bixúńde / ’Indabixúńde, modern name: Chusht’a ’íízhańde), another Athabascan-speaking tribe, call the Mescalero Naashgalí Dineʼé. Like other Apache peoples they often identify simply as Ndé / Nndéí / Ndéne / Ndéńde (&quot;The People&quot;, &quot;Apaches&quot;). Neighboring Apache bands called the Mescalero Nadahéndé (&quot;People of the Mescal&quot;), because the mescal agave (&quot;Agave parryi&quot;) (Apache: naa’da / ’inaa’da / na’da) was a staple food source for them. In times of need and hunger, they depended on stored mescal for survival. They adopted and identify today also as Naa&#x27;dahéńdé / Naa’dańde (&quot;The People of the Mescal&quot;). Since 1550 Spanish colonists referred to them as the &quot;Mescalero.&quot;

Mescalero Apache bands were often referred to by European colonists and settlers by different names, some related to their geographic territory. They were recorded in documents by a wide number of names: &quot;Apaches de Cuartelejo, Apaches del Río Grande, Apachi, Faraones, Mezcaleros, Natage (more correctly, one of the Lipan Apache subdivisions, along with the Nahizan), Natahene, Querechos, Teyas, Tularosa Apaches, and Vaqueros.&quot; They were also distinguished as &quot;Sierra Blanca Apaches, Sacramento Mountains Apaches, Guadalupe Mountains Apaches, Limpia Mountains Apaches.&quot; according to their homelands in northern or southern Mescalero territory.

== Tribal territory ==
Originally the different Mescalero bands and local groups ranged in an area between the Rio Grande (Tú &#x27;ichii-dí – &quot;the water that is the color of red ocher&quot;) in the west and the eastern and southern edge of the Llano Estacado and the southern Texas Panhandle in Texas in the east; from present-day Santa Fe (Yuutu&#x27;) in the northwest and the Texas Panhandle in the northeast, down to the Big Bend of Texas and what became the Mexican provinces of Chihuahua and Coahuila to the south. The diverse landscape of this area has high mountains up to 12,000 feet, as well as watered and sheltered valleys, surrounded by arid semi-deserts and deserts, deep canyons and open plains. The Mescalero Apache Reservation is located at geographical coordinates .
Mescalero identity is filled with legends of the past. For instance, four mountains represent the direction of everyday life for the Mescalero Apache people: those being (1) Sierra Blanca Peak (White Peak), (2) El Capitan within the Guadalupe Mountains, (3) Three Sisters Mountain (Las Tres Hermanas) and (4) Oscura Mountain Peak (sometimes the Salinas Peak within the San Andres Mountains is listed as the fourth sacred mountain instead of the Oscuru Mountain Peak). Moreover, their forefathers spoke of a creator giving them life on White Mountain. It was there that White Painted Woman gave birth to two sons, Child of Water and Killer of Enemies

Since each band of Mescalero had the right to use the resources of deer and plants of the neighboring groups, the different bands felt at home in any area of their wide tribal territory. The Mescalero or &quot;Mashgalé-õde&quot; bands often ranged widely for hunting, gathering, warring and raiding. They called their home Indeislun Nakah (&quot;people, forming a group, when they are there,&quot; &quot;place where people get together&quot;) or today Mashgalé-ne bikéyaa (&quot;Mescalero Apache Country&quot;; &quot;Mescalero Apache Homelands&quot;).
When many Mescalero bands were displaced by the enemy Comanche (&quot;&#x27;Indaa tse&#x27;-éõde&quot; or &quot;Indassene&quot;; modern name: Gumáõchí-í) from the Southern Plains in northern and central Texas between 1700 and 1750, they took refuge in the mountains of New Mexico, western Texas, and Coahuila and Chihuahua in Mexico. Some southern Mescalero bands, together with Lipan, lived in the Bolsón de Mapimí, moving between the Nazas River, the Conchos River and the Rio Grande to the north.

== Bands ==
 The Mescalero were divided into some regional bands, which were known to the Spanish/Mexican (&#x27;indantûhé-õde) and later Americans (&#x27;indaa łiga-ńne bindáa-í datł&#x27;ij-í – &quot;white [enemy] people with blue eyes&quot; or &#x27;indáá-ńne – &quot;white people&quot;; &quot;[white] enemies&quot;; modern name: nndé bindáa datł&#x27;ijé-ńne – &quot;white people&quot;; lit. &quot;blue-eyed people&quot;) by different names (most were transliterations or renderings of the bands Apache name).

* Naa’dańde / Naa’dahéńdé (&quot;Mescal People&quot;, &quot;People of the Mescal&quot;) or Natagés (Spanish rendering and transliteration, pronounced Na-ta-hay); really a Lipan group, they lived between Rio Grande and Pecos River (also known as &quot;Rio Salado&quot; or &quot;Rio del Natagee&quot;) in central New Mexico, with several local groups traveling on the southern and western edge of the Llano Estacado onto the southern Texas Panhandle, original Apachean group who would become the Mescalero and Salinero Apaches (&quot;Salt producing People&quot;).)
* Gułgahéńde / Gułgańde (&quot;People of the Plains&quot;, &quot;The People of Open Spaces&quot;) or Cuelcajenne, later Llañeros (&quot;Plains People&quot;; really a Jicarilla group, they lived east of the mountains and the Pecos River, on the High Plains from the Texas Panhandle to the Pecos Valley, between Amarillo (Bighą́ą́’ gułga-yá / Bighą́ą́’ gułtsúú-yá), Tucumcari, Lubbock and the Llano Estacado, along the Sandia and Tijeras Mountains westward to Santa Fe, from Nogal Canyon to the north to Las Vegas, from the Organ Mountains (Tsé daadeezhá-yá; Tsé deezhá-yá – &quot;The place where rocks are jagged&quot;) eastwards to El Paso (Tsé táhúú&#x27;á-yá) in Texas (Ch&#x27;a nteeã-õde bikéé&#x27;yaa&#x27;). In Oklahoma (Indian Territory) they developed kinship ties by marriage with the Comanche.)
* Dził-í naańde / Dził-í naahńde (&quot;Mountain Ridge Band People&quot;, &quot;The People of the Mountainside&quot;, &quot;The People who Live on the Edge of the Mountains&quot;) or Chilpaines (lived in the mountains west and south of the Pecos River, extending in northern Chihuahua and Coahuila of present-day Mexico.)
* Ch’ilaańde / Jilaa’éńde (&quot;Antelope Band People&quot;, &quot;The People of Antelope&quot;) (lived west of the Pecos west to the Rio Grande in the mountains of central and south New Mexico and the Tularosa Basin (Tséts’ųųsí yaneeł’ą́’-ee tú nk’ų́jí siką́-yá).
* Nii’t’ahéńde / Niit’ahéńde (&quot;The People of the Side of the Land&quot;, &quot;The People at the Side of the Earth&quot;, &quot;The People at the Edge of the Earth&quot;, &quot;People Who Live Against the Mountains&quot;, &quot;Earth Crevine (Deer) People&quot;) or Sierra Blanca (White Mountains) Mescaleros, sometimes Sacramento Mountains Mescaleros (so named because their 19th century dominant local groups lived in the Sacramento Mountains and in the Sierra Blanca (White Mountains) (Dził Gais ’ą́ní) in New Mexico with other local groups living east in the Guadalupe Mountains of western Texas.)
* Tséichíńde (&quot;People of Hook Nose&quot;, &quot;The People of Red Rock&quot;, &quot;The People of the Guadalupe Mountains&quot;) or Guadalupe Mountains Mescaleros (several bands, who lived in the &quot;Tséichí&quot; (&quot;red rock&quot;, i.e. Guadalupe Mountains), the adjacent Plains of Texas and in northern Coahuila and Chihuahua of Mexico.)
* Tsébikįnéńde (&quot;Rock House People&quot;, &quot;Stone House People&quot;, &quot;The People of Rock Houses&quot;), Aguas Nuevas Apaches or Norteños (&quot;The Northerners&quot;), later Limpia Mescaleros (have been based around the Nuevo Casas Grandes in Chihuahua, migrating north toward the Sacramento Mountains and south to Agua Nueva 60 miles north of Chihuahua City (Ją́’é łą́yá- &quot;the place where (there are) many donkeys&quot;), also on both sides of the Rio Grande between El Paso and Ojinaga, Chihuahua; some local groups lived in the Guadalupe and Limpia mountains)
* Tahuundé / Tá&#x27;huú&#x27;ndé (&quot;Mountains Extending into the River People&quot;) (lived on both sides of the Pecos River in southern New Mexico and into southwestern Texas)
* Chisos Apaches / Chishéńde / Chishhéńde (&quot;Forest People&quot;), Chinati Apaches (&quot;People at the mountain pass&quot;) or Rio Grande Apaches (one mighty band with several local groups living in the Chihuahuan Desert and arid mountains ranging on both sides of the Rio Grande from the Trans-Pecos south down into the Sierra Madre Oriental of North Mexico, with strongholds in the mountain ranges of the Davis Mountains (former Limpia Mountains), Chisos Mountains and Chinati Mountains (from Apache name &quot;ch&#x27;íná&#x27;itíh&quot; – &quot;gate&quot; or &quot;mountain pass&quot;) of West Texas and in the adjoining Sierra del Burro (Serranias del Burro), Sierra (Maderas) del Carmen of Coahuila and Sierra Alamos of Chihuahua north of the Bolsón de Mapimí, today&#x27;s Big Bend National Park in Texas and the Cañón de Santa Elena Protected Area and Maderas del Carmen Protected Area are part of their former band territory.)
* Túntsańde / Tú ntsaa-ńde (&quot;Big Water People&quot;) (once the &quot;Tú sis Ndé&quot; band of the Lipan Apache, who lived in south central Texas and in northern Coahuila, camping together with several bands of the Mescalero on the Plains for hunting and raiding; they merged with the Mescalero, forming a Mescalero band)
* Tú’édįnéńde (&quot;No Water People&quot;, &quot;Tough People of the Desert&quot;) (once the &quot;Tú é diné Ndé&quot; band of the Lipan Apache, who had territory in northern Coahuila and Chihuahua; they eventually merged with some southern Mescalero bands)

The &quot;Naa’dahéńdé&quot; had had a considerable influence on the decision-making of some bands of the Western Lipan in the 18th century, especially on the &quot;Tindi Ndé&quot;, &quot;Tcha shka-ózhäye&quot;, &quot;Tú’édįnéńde&quot; and &quot;Tú sis Ndé&quot;. To fight their common enemy, the Comanche, and to protect the northeastern and eastern border of the Apacheria against the Comancheria, the Mescalero (&quot;Naa’dahéńdé&quot; and &quot;Gułgahéńde&quot;) on the Plains joined forces with their Lipan kin (&quot;Cuelcahen Ndé&quot;, &quot;Te&#x27;l kóndahä&quot;, &quot;Ndáwe qóhä&quot; and &quot;Shá’i’áńde&quot;) to the east and south of them.

In August 1912, by an act of the U.S. Congress, the surviving members of the Chiricahua tribe were released from their prisoner-of-war status. They were given the choice to remain at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where they had been imprisoned since 1894, or to relocate to the Mescalero Apache reservation. One hundred and eighty-three elected to go to New Mexico, while seventy-eight remained in Oklahoma. Their descendants still reside in both places.

==Notable Mescalero==

=== Historical chiefs and headmen ===
Northern Mescalero
* Barranquito (also known as &quot;Palanquito&quot;): most influential chief of the &quot;Nii’t’ahéńde (Sierra Blanca Mescalero)&quot; band, which ranged between the Sierra Blanca east toward the Pecos River, probably the most important Mescalero chief in the early 1800s, when he died in 1857, his three sons and/or nephews Santana, Cadete and Roman succeeded him.
* Santana (also known as &quot;Santa Ana&quot;, ca. 1810 / 1815 – †1876): son and successor of Barranquito, since about 1830&#x27; had been a local group leader of great authority of the Sierra Blanca Mescalero band, since the death of Barranquito Santana seem to have had the most influence within the northern Mescalero bands, but avoided the spotlight and was hardly known by the whites, in his later years he became the most steadfast friend of the whites, until his death of pneumonia or smallpox.
* Cadete (also known as &quot;Cadette&quot; – &quot;Volunteer&quot;, in Apache: &quot;Gian-na-tah&quot; – &quot;Always Ready&quot;, also known as &quot;Zhee-es-not-son&quot;, &quot;Zhee Ah Nat Tsa&quot;): a son and successor of Barranquito, after Santana he was the most prominent and powerful chief of the Sierra Blanca Mescalero band, was more diplomatic than Santana and was a spokesman for the northern Mescalero bands. After the outbreak from Bosque Redondo on November 3, 1863, he had fled with his band toward the Staked Plains, trading stolen cattle and horses from Mexico directly or via the Comanchero to Comanche. He was murdered in 1872 while on a peace mission and returning from Tularosa.
* Roman Grande: a son and successor of Barranquito, serving as chief of a local group of the Sierra Blanca Mescalero band. Less important than Santana and Cadete, he followed the lead of his brother Santana; died during an epidemic in 1885.

* Caballero (&quot;Ca-bal-le-so&quot;, eventually to be identified with &quot;Kutbhalla&quot; or &quot;Kutu-hala&quot;): war chief and later principal chief of the &quot;Nii’t’ahéńde (Sacramento Mountains Mescaleros)&quot; local groups of the Sacramento Mountains during the decades 1860s and 1870s, likely married to a daughter of the Chihenne Chief Mangas Coloradas, close ally and long-time friend of the great Mimbreño chief Victorio (and likely his brother-in-law as Mangas Coloradas&#x27; son-in-law); in March 1880 he left Tularosa and joined Victorio, fighting along with him in their last battles, but, according to some reports, he was killed in a trouble between the chiefs before the Tres Castillos massacre on oct. 14 1880.
* Peso: ca. *1849 – †1929, was born in the Guadalupe Mountains near present-day Carlsbad as son of chief San Juan and his wife Nagoo-nah-go, his &quot;Nii’t’ahéńde&quot; or maybe &quot;Tséichíńde (Guadalupe Mountains Mescaleros)&quot; band joined Nautzili&#x27;s band of Guhlkahéndé on the Southern Plains, from time to time he also joined the &quot;Tu&#x27;sis Nde&quot; band of Lipan Apaches of southeastern Texas and northeastern Mexico under Chief Magoosh, he was an expert tracker and served as Apache Scout in the campaigns against Geronimo, in the late 1800s he, together with his brother Sin Miedo (Sans Peur, Without Fear) and Magoosh were the three primary leaders on the reservation—Magoosh for the Lipans at Elk Springs, Sin Miedo at Tule Canyon and Peso representing the Rinconada and the Three Rivers.
* Sin Miedo (&quot;Without Fear&quot; = &quot;Sans Peur&quot;): brother of chief Peso and son of chief San Juan, his &quot;Nii’t’ahéńde&quot; or maybe &quot;Tséichíńde (Guadalupe Mountains Mescaleros)&quot; band were close allies of the eastern Mescalero band named Gułgahéńde on the Southern Plains and of the &quot;Túsis Nde&quot; band of Lipan Apaches of southeastern Texas and northeastern Mexico; together with his brothers Peso, Crook Neck, and leaders as Shanta Boy and Big Mouth he served as Apache Scout in the campaign against Geronimo, the war leader and shaman of the Bedonkohe band of the Ndendhe Apaches; he, together with his brother Peso and Magoosh were the three primary leaders on the reservation—Magoosh for the Lipans at Elk Springs, Peso representing the Rinconada and the Three Rivers, and Sin Miedo at Tule Canyon.

Muchacho Negro was considered a renegade who would return to his people and continue to cause trouble. He was captured in June 1883 and imprisoned at Fort Sill, Indian Territory. 
* Gorgonio: medicine-man, aide to old Barranquito and, later, to Santana.
Southern Mescalero 
* Carnoviste: chief of &quot;Tsehitcihéndé (Guadalupe Mountains Mescaleros)&quot; or maybe &quot;Tsebekinéndé (Aguas Nuevas Apaches or Limpia Mescaleros)&quot;, his band lived in the Big Bend Country, ranged on both sides of the Rio Grande from the Guadalupe Mountains towards east of the Limpia Mountains also known as Davis Mountains onto the edge of the Southern Plains, was reported to have committed frequent &quot;depredations&quot; on the San Antonio road and to have kidnapped Hermann—soon adopted in the tribe—and Willie Lehmann near Fort Mason in May 1870; in 1874 he promoted a council of Mescalero, Mimbreño and Lipan Apache chiefs, and Victorio succeeded in persuading the council to send peace messengers to the Comanches and Kiowas; he was killed by a medicine man of his band in the spring 1876.
* Gómez (also known as Chief Gómez or Juan Gómez or by the Apache Negoyani, &quot;Old Man of Wisdom&quot;): chief of the 1840s1860s who led a large &quot;Tsebekinéndé (Aguas Nuevas Apaches or Limpia Mescaleros)&quot; band of five local groups with about 400 warriors. His band lived in the Big Bend Country and the Trans-Pecos on both sides of the Rio Grande; his stronghold was in the Limpia Mountains, later named Davis Mountains. When the governor of Chihuahua Ángel Trías Álvarez offered 1000 pesos for his scalp, Gómez offered an equal amount for any Mexican or American scalp. The Glanton Gang&#x27;s quest to capture Gómez on behalf of Gov. Trías was dramatized by Cormac McCarthy in his 1985 novel &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;. Gómez&#x27;s lieutenants () were Cigarito, Chinonero or Chino Huero, Simón Porode, and Simón Manuel.
** Cigarito: leader of a local group in the Limpia also known as Davis Mountains and in the lowlands of the Trans-Pecos; &quot;segundo&quot; and war chief of southern Mescalero Chief Gómez, 1840s–1860s

He was reported to have led frequent raids and attacks of parties on the San Antonio road and in the settlement near El Paso. He wished to join the Sierra Blanca Mescalero band, but their request was refused, because they were considered a Texas Mescalero band; active in the 1840s–1860s.

<text>Pinoy ( or ) is a common informal self-reference used by Filipinos to refer to citizens of the Philippines and their culture as well as to overseas Filipinos in the Filipino diaspora. A Pinoy who has any non-Filipino foreign ancestry is often informally called &quot;Tisoy.&quot;

Many Filipinos refer to themselves as &quot;Pinoy&quot;, sometimes the feminine Pinay ( ), instead of the standard term &quot;Filipino&quot;. Filipino is the widespread formal word used to call a citizen of the Philippines. &quot;Pinoy&quot; is formed by taking the last four letters of &quot;Filipino&quot; and adding the diminutive suffix -y in the Tagalog language (the suffix is commonly used in Filipino nicknames: e.g. &quot;Noynoy&quot; or &quot;Kokoy&quot; or &quot;Toytoy&quot;). &quot;Pinoy&quot; was used for self-identification by the first wave of Filipinos going to the continental United States before World War II and has been used both in a pejorative sense and as a term of endearment.

&quot;Pinoy&quot; was created to differentiate the experiences of those immigrating to the United States, but is now a slang term used to refer to all people of Filipino descent. &quot;Pinoy music&quot; impacted the socio-political climate of the 1970s and was employed by both Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos and the People Power Revolution that overthrew his regime. Recent mainstream usages tend to center on entertainment (&quot;Pinoy Big Brother&quot;) that can be watched on Pinoy Tambayan and music (&quot;Pinoy Idol&quot;), which have played a significant role in developing national and cultural identity.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Pinoy&quot; was coined by expatriate Filipino Americans during the 1920s and was later adopted by Filipinos in the Philippines. According to historian Dawn Mabalon, the historical use has been to refer to Filipinos born or living in the United States and has been in constant use since the 1920s. She adds that it was reclaimed and politicized by &quot;Filipino American activists and artists in the FilAm movements of the 1960s/1970s&quot;.

==Earliest usages==
The earliest known usages of &quot;Pinoy&quot;/&quot;Pinay&quot; in magazines and newspapers date to the 1920s include taking on social issues facing Pinoy, casual mentions of Pinoys at events, while some are advertisements from Hawaii from Filipinos themselves. The following are the more notable earliest usages:

===United States===
In the United States, the earliest published usage known is in a &quot;Republic&quot; article written in January 1924 by Dr. J. Juliano, a member of the faculty of the Schurz school in Chicago – &quot;Why does a Pinoy take it as an insult to be taken for a Shintoist or a Confucian?&quot; and &quot;What should a Pinoy do if he is addressed as a Chinese or a Jap?&quot;

According to the late Filipino-American historian Dawn Bohulano Mabalon, another early attestation of the terms &quot;Pinoy&quot; and &quot;Pinay&quot; was in a 1926 issue of the &quot;Filipino Student Bulletin&quot;. The article that featured the terms is titled &quot;Filipino Women in U.S. Excel in Their Courses: Invade Business, Politics.&quot;

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, the earliest published usage known is from December 1926, in &quot;History of the Philippine Press&quot;, which briefly mentions a weekly Spanish-Visayan-English publication called &quot;Pinoy&quot; based in Capiz and published by the Pinoy Publishing Company. In 1930, the Manila-based magazine &quot;Khaki and Red: The Official Organ of the Constabulary and Police&quot; printed an article about street gangs stating &quot;another is the &#x27;Kapatiran&#x27; gang of Intramuros, composed of patrons of pools rooms who banded together to &#x27;protect pinoys&#x27; from the abusive American soldados.&quot;

==Motivations==
The desire to self-identify can likely be attributed to the diverse and independent history of the archipelagic country – comprising 7,107 islands in the western Pacific Ocean – which trace back 30,000 years before being colonized by Spain in the 16th century and later occupied by the United States, which led to the outbreak of the Philippine–American War (1899–1902). The Commonwealth of the Philippines was established in 1935 with the country gaining its independence in 1946 after hostilities in the Pacific Theatre of the Second World War had ended. The Philippines have over 170 languages indigenous to the area, most of which belong to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. In 1939, then-president Manuel L. Quezon renamed the Tagalog language as the &quot;Wikang Pambansa&quot; (&quot;national language&quot;). The language was further renamed in 1959 as &quot;Filipino&quot; by Secretary of Education Jose Romero. The 1973 constitution declared the Filipino language to be co-official, along with English, and mandated the development of a national language to be known as Filipino. Since then, the two official languages are Filipino and English.

As of 2003 there are more than eleven million overseas Filipinos worldwide, equivalent to about 11% of the total population of the Philippines.

==Notable literature==
&quot;Pinoy&quot; is first used by Filipino poet Carlos Bulosan, in his 1946 semi-autobiography, &quot;America Is in the Heart&quot; – &quot;The Pinoys work every day in the fields but when the season is over their money is in the Chinese vaults.&quot; The book describes his childhood in the Philippines, his voyage to America, and his years as an itinerant laborer following the harvest trail in the rural West. It has been used in American ethnic studies courses to illustrate the racism experienced by thousands of Filipino laborers during the 1930s and 40s in the United States.

==Pinoy music==

In the early 1970s, Pinoy music or &quot;Pinoy pop&quot; emerged, often sung in Tagalog – it was a mix of rock, folk and ballads – marking a political use of music similar to early hip hop but transcending class. The music was a &quot;conscious attempt to create a Filipino national and popular culture&quot; and it often reflected social realities and problems. As early as 1973, the Juan de la Cruz Band was performing &quot;Ang Himig Natin&quot; (&quot;Our Music&quot;), which is widely regarded as the first example of Pinoy rock. &quot;Pinoy&quot; gained popular currency in the late 1970s in the Philippines when a surge in patriotism made a hit song of Filipino folk singer Heber Bartolome&#x27;s &quot;Tayo&#x27;y mga Pinoy&quot; (&quot;We are Pinoys&quot;). This trend was followed by Filipino rapper Francis Magalona&#x27;s &quot;Mga Kababayan Ko&quot; (&quot;My Countrymen&quot;) in the 1990s and Filipino rock band Bamboo&#x27;s &quot;Noypi&quot; (&quot;Pinoy&quot; in reversed syllables) in the 2000s. Nowadays, &quot;Pinoy&quot; is used as an adjective to some terms highlighting their relationship to the Philippines or Filipinos. Pinoy rock was soon followed by Pinoy folk and later, Pinoy jazz. Although the music was often used to express opposition to then Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos and his use of martial law and the creating of the Batasang Bayan, many of the songs were more subversive and some just instilled national pride. Perhaps because of the cultural affirming nature and many of the songs seemingly being non-threatening, the Marcos administration ordered radio stations to play at least one – and later, three – Pinoy songs each hour. Pinoy music was greatly employed both by Marcos and political forces who sought to overthrow him.

<doc id="1079771" wikidata="Q101949" url="?curid=1079771" title="Earth's mantle">
<text>Earth&#x27;s mantle is a layer of silicate rock between the crust and the outer core. It has a mass of and makes up 67% of the mass of Earth. It has a thickness of making up about 46% of Earth&#x27;s radius and 84% of Earth&#x27;s volume. It is predominantly solid but, on geologic time scales, it behaves as a viscous fluid, sometimes described as having the consistency of caramel. Partial melting of the mantle at mid-ocean ridges produces oceanic crust, and partial melting of the mantle at subduction zones produces continental crust.

== Structure ==
===Rheology===
Earth&#x27;s upper mantle is divided into two major rheological layers: the rigid lithosphere comprising the uppermost mantle (the lithospheric mantle), and the more ductile asthenosphere, separated by the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Lithosphere underlying ocean crust has a thickness of around , whereas lithosphere underlying continental crust generally has a thickness of . The lithosphere and overlying crust make up tectonic plates, which move over the asthenosphere. Below the asthenosphere, the mantle is again relatively rigid.

The Earth&#x27;s mantle is divided into three major layers defined by sudden changes in seismic velocity:

* the upper mantle (starting at the Moho, or base of the crust around downward to )
* the transition zone (approximately ), in which wadsleyite (≈ ) and ringwoodite (≈ ) are stable
* the lower mantle (approximately ), in which bridgmanite (≈ ) and post-perovskite (≈ ) are stable

The lower ~200 km of the lower mantle constitutes the D&quot; (D-double-prime) layer, a region with anomalous seismic properties. This region also contains large low-shear-velocity provinces and ultra low velocity zones.

=== Mineralogical structure ===
The top of the mantle is defined by a sudden increase in seismic velocity, which was first noted by Andrija Mohorovičić in 1909; this boundary is now referred to as the Mohorovičić discontinuity or &quot;Moho&quot;.

The upper mantle is dominantly peridotite, composed primarily of variable proportions of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and an aluminous phase. The aluminous phase is plagioclase in the uppermost mantle, then spinel, and then garnet below ~. Gradually through the upper mantle, pyroxenes become less stable and transform into majoritic garnet.

At the top of the transition zone, olivine undergoes isochemical phase transitions to wadsleyite and ringwoodite. Unlike nominally anhydrous olivine, these high-pressure olivine polymorphs have a large capacity to store water in their crystal structure. This and other evidence has led to the hypothesis that the transition zone may host a large quantity of water. At the base of the transition zone, ringwoodite decomposes into bridgmanite (formerly called magnesium silicate perovskite), and ferropericlase. Garnet also becomes unstable at or slightly below the base of the transition zone.

The lower mantle is composed primarily of bridgmanite and ferropericlase, with minor amounts of calcium perovskite, calcium-ferrite structured oxide, and stishovite. In the lowermost ~ of the mantle, bridgmanite isochemically transforms into post-perovskite.

=== Possible remnants of Theia collision ===
Seismic images of Earth’s interior have revealed in the lowermost mantle two continent-sized anomalies with low seismic velocities. These zones are denser and likely compositionally different from the surrounding mantle. These anomalies may represent buried relics of Theia mantle material remaining after the Moon-forming giant impact. 

== Composition ==

The chemical composition of the mantle is difficult to determine with a high degree of certainty because it is largely inaccessible. Rare exposures of mantle rocks occur in ophiolites, where sections of oceanic lithosphere have been obducted onto a continent. Mantle rocks are also sampled as xenoliths within basalts or kimberlites.

Most estimates of the mantle composition are based on rocks that sample only the uppermost mantle. There is debate as to whether the rest of the mantle, especially the lower mantle, has the same bulk composition. The mantle&#x27;s composition has changed through the Earth&#x27;s history due to the extraction of magma that solidified to form oceanic crust and continental crust.

It has also been proposed in a 2018 study that an exotic form of water known as ice VII can form from supercritical water in the mantle when diamonds containing pressurized water bubbles move upward, cooling the water to the conditions needed for ice VII to form.

== Temperature and pressure ==
In the mantle, temperatures range from approximately 500 K (230 °C; 440 °F) at the upper boundary with the crust to approximately 4,200 K (3,900 °C; 7,100 °F) at the core-mantle boundary. The temperature of the mantle increases rapidly in the thermal boundary layers at the top and bottom of the mantle, and increases gradually through the interior of the mantle. Although the higher temperatures far exceed the melting points of the mantle rocks at the surface (about 1,500 K (1,200 °C; 2,200 °F) for representative peridotite), the mantle is almost exclusively solid. The enormous lithostatic pressure exerted on the mantle prevents melting, because the temperature at which melting begins (the solidus) increases with pressure.

The pressure in the mantle increases from a few hundred megapascals at the Moho to at the core-mantle boundary.

== Movement ==

Because of the temperature difference between the Earth&#x27;s surface and outer core and the ability of the crystalline rocks at high pressure and temperature to undergo slow, creeping, viscous-like deformation over millions of years, there is a convective material circulation in the mantle. Hot material rises (in a mantle plume) while cooler (and heavier) material sinks downward. Downward motion of material occurs at convergent plate boundaries called subduction zones. Locations on the surface that lie over plumes are predicted to have high elevation (because of the buoyancy of the hotter, less-dense plume beneath) and to exhibit hot spot volcanism. The volcanism often attributed to deep mantle plumes is alternatively explained by passive extension of the crust, permitting magma to leak to the surface: the plate hypothesis.

The convection of the Earth&#x27;s mantle is a chaotic process (in the sense of fluid dynamics), which is thought to be an integral part of the motion of plates. Plate motion should not be confused with continental drift which applies purely to the movement of the crustal components of the continents. The movements of the lithosphere and the underlying mantle are coupled since descending lithosphere is an essential component of convection in the mantle. The observed continental drift is a complicated relationship between the forces causing oceanic lithosphere to sink and the movements within Earth&#x27;s mantle.

Although there is a tendency to larger viscosity at greater depth, this relation is far from linear and shows layers with dramatically decreased viscosity, in particular in the upper mantle and at the boundary with the core. The mantle within about above the core–mantle boundary appears to have distinctly different seismic properties than the mantle at slightly shallower depths; this unusual mantle region just above the core is called D (&quot;D double-prime&quot;), a nomenclature introduced over 50 years ago by the geophysicist Keith Bullen. D may consist of material from subducted slabs that descended and came to rest at the core–mantle boundary or from a new mineral polymorph discovered in perovskite called post-perovskite.

Earthquakes at shallow depths are a result of faulting; however, below about the hot, high pressure conditions ought to inhibit further seismicity. The mantle is considered to be viscous and incapable of brittle faulting. However, in subduction zones, earthquakes are observed down to . A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including dehydration, thermal runaway, and phase change.
The geothermal gradient can be lowered where cool material from the surface sinks downward, increasing the strength of the surrounding mantle, and allowing earthquakes to occur down to a depth of between and .

The pressure at the bottom of the mantle is ~. Pressure increases as depth increases, since the material beneath has to support the weight of all the material above it. The entire mantle, however, is thought to deform like a fluid on long timescales, with permanent plastic deformation accommodated by the movement of point, line, and/or planar defects through the solid crystals composing the mantle. Estimates for the viscosity of the upper mantle range between and Pa·s, depending on depth, temperature, composition, state of stress, and numerous other factors. Thus, the upper mantle can only flow very slowly. However, when large forces are applied to the uppermost mantle it can become weaker, and this effect is thought to be important in allowing the formation of tectonic plate boundaries.

== Exploration ==
Exploration of the mantle is generally conducted at the seabed rather than on land because of the relative thinness of the oceanic crust as compared to the significantly thicker continental crust.

The first attempt at mantle exploration, known as Project Mohole, was abandoned in 1966 after repeated failures and cost over-runs. The deepest penetration was approximately . In 2005 an oceanic borehole reached below the sea floor from the ocean drilling vessel &quot;JOIDES Resolution&quot;.

More successful was the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) that operated from 1968 to 1983. Coordinated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, DSDP provided crucial data to support the seafloor spreading hypothesis and helped to prove the theory of plate tectonics. &quot;Glomar Challenger&quot; conducted the drilling operations. DSDP was the first of three international scientific ocean drilling programs that have operated over more than 40 years. Scientific planning was conducted under the auspices of the Joint Oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling (JOIDES), whose advisory group consisted of 250 distinguished scientists from academic institutions, government agencies, and private industry from all over the world. The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) continued exploration from 1985 to 2003 when it was replaced by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).

On 5 March 2007, a team of scientists on board the RRS &quot;James Cook&quot; embarked on a voyage to an area of the Atlantic seafloor where the mantle lies exposed without any crust covering, midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Caribbean Sea. The exposed site lies approximately three kilometres beneath the ocean surface and covers thousands of square kilometres.
A relatively difficult attempt to retrieve samples from the Earth&#x27;s mantle was scheduled for later in 2007. The Chikyu Hakken mission attempted to use the Japanese vessel &quot;Chikyū&quot; to drill up to below the seabed. This is nearly three times as deep as preceding oceanic drillings.

A novel method of exploring the uppermost few hundred kilometres of the Earth was proposed in 2005, consisting of a small, dense, heat-generating probe which melts its way down through the crust and mantle while its position and progress are tracked by acoustic signals generated in the rocks. The probe consists of an outer sphere of tungsten about one metre in diameter with a cobalt-60 interior acting as a radioactive heat source. It was calculated that such a probe will reach the oceanic &quot;Moho&quot; in less than 6 months and attain minimum depths of well over in a few decades beneath both oceanic and continental lithosphere.

Exploration can also be aided through computer simulations of the evolution of the mantle. In 2009, a supercomputer application provided new insight into the distribution of mineral deposits, especially isotopes of iron, from when the mantle developed 4.5 billion years ago.

In 2023, JOIDES Resolution recovered cores of what appeared to be rock from the upper mantle after drilling only a few hundred meters into the Atlantis Massif. The borehole reached a maximum depth of 1,268 meters and recovered 886 meters of rock samples consisting of primarily peridotite. There is debate over the extent to which the samples represent the upper mantle with some arguing the effects of seawater on the samples situates them as examples of deep lower crust. However, the samples offer a much closer analogue to mantle rock than magmatic xenoliths as the sampled rock never melted into magma or recrystallized.

<text>Frederick William Harvey DCM (26 March 1888 – 13 February 1957), often known as Will Harvey, was an English poet, broadcaster and solicitor. His poetry became widely popular during and after World War I.

==Early life==
Harvey was born in 1888 in Hartpury, Gloucestershire, and grew up in Minsterworth. He was educated at the King&#x27;s School, Gloucester, where he formed a close friendship with Ivor Gurney, and then at Rossall School. Gurney and Herbert Howells, another local composer, later set a number of his poems to music.

He started on a legal career, which would always be somewhat tentative; and began to consider conversion to Roman Catholicism.

==World War I==
On 8 August 1914, four days after the United Kingdom had declared war on Germany, Harvey joined the 5th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment as a private. Shortly afterwards, in November, he became a Roman Catholic. He was an adherent of the distributism movement, described as a &quot;third way&quot;, in opposition to both socialism and capitalism; and he was influenced by the work of G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc.

His battalion was posted to France in March 1915, where he was promoted to lance corporal and awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. His citation for the DCM reads:
Harvey returned to England for officer training, but after being commissioned and returning to France he was captured on 17 August 1916 in the German front-line trench while carrying out a reconnaissance patrol. He spent the rest of the war in prisoner-of-war camps, including those at Gütersloh, Crefeld, Schwarmstedt, Holzminden, Bad Colberg, and Stralsund.

==Writing==
Soon after his arrival in France, Harvey began to contribute to a trench newspaper, the &quot;Fifth Gloucester Gazette&quot;. His first volume of poems, &quot;A Gloucestershire Lad at Home and Abroad&quot;, was published in September 1916, shortly after his capture. He began to write more intensively in captivity, and poems were sent back to England for publication: his second collection, &quot;Gloucestershire Friends&quot;, appeared in 1917. His time in the camps is held to be his most productive period of writing. On returning from a spell of solitary confinement at Holzminden after a failed escape attempt, he saw that a fellow prisoner had drawn a picture over his bed in chalk of ducks in a pool of water. This inspired his most celebrated poem (and the title poem of his third collection, published in 1919), &quot;Ducks&quot;.

==Post-war life==
Harvey returned home in 1919, married in 1921, and returned to legal practice. He became a respected and loved figure in the Forest of Dean. He worked largely as a defence solicitor (his own captivity convincing him that incarceration was destructive and pointless), and became known as the &quot;poor man&#x27;s solicitor&quot;. His work was not financially successful, and in the 1930s he sold off his practice.

In 1920 he published a memoir of his prison-camp experiences, &quot;Comrades in Captivity&quot;; and in 1921 &quot;Farewell&quot;, an acknowledgement of his intention to remove himself from the literary world. He had a brief creative union with his great friend and collaborator, Ivor Gurney. Gurney had written &quot;After-Glow&quot; and &quot;To His Love&quot; for Harvey, on hearing of his supposed death in 1916; and &quot;Ypres-Minsterworth&quot; as a gesture of solidarity with him in his captivity. Their reunion was cut sadly short by Gurney&#x27;s mental breakdown in 1922.

Harvey&#x27;s gift for oration and his versatile voice and scripting led him to become a popular broadcaster at the BBC, Bristol, where he used his popularity to promote the Forest of Dean, its people and traditions. He furthered local choirs, musicians and young authors such as Leonard Clark. He was friends with Rutland Boughton and the local MP, Morgan Philips Price, who worked with him to promote the arts and the interests of Foresters.

==Later years==
In later life Harvey craved the comradeship he had found in the trenches and was saddened that the new social order he had expected never appeared. His later poetry of remembrance captured those feelings, but retained the essential humour of his early work and included verse in local dialect.

He died in 1957 and was buried at Minsterworth.

==Personal life==
In 1921 Harvey married Anne Kane, an Irish nurse. They had two children, Eileen Anne (born 1922) and Patrick (born 1925). He led a Bohemian lifestyle, rejecting material values, and often recklessly gave away his professional services and income.

==Reputation and legacy==

Harvey&#x27;s poems published during and immediately after World War I were acclaimed, and his status was acknowledged when a collection was published in 1926 in the &quot;Augustan Books of Modern Poetry&quot; series, edited by Edward Thompson.

The lyricism of his poetry led to it being set to music by his friends Ivor Gurney, Herbert Howells and Sir Herbert Brewer, and others, including post-war composers such as Johnny Coppin. His work is noted particularly for its appreciation of the natural world and the landscape and traditions of West Gloucestershire.

Harvey was commemorated in 1980 by a slate memorial tablet in the south transept of Gloucester Cathedral. &quot;Ducks&quot;, Harvey&#x27;s best known verse, was voted one of the nation&#x27;s 100 favourite poems in 1996 in a nationwide poll conducted by the BBC.

<text>Vertregt is the ancient remnant of a large lunar impact crater. It is located on the far side of the Moon, to the north of the unusual walled plain Van de Graaff. The prominent crater Aitken lies across the northeast rim of Vertregt, and Zwicky is attached to the northwestern rim.

Vertregt has been heavily eroded and reshaped by subsequent events, leaving only a few segments of the outer rim still visible. The northwestern section of the rim is the most intact portion, although even this arcing ridge is marked by small craterlets.

The interior consists of rugged ridges and smaller impacts, most prominently the crater pair of Vertregt L and Vertregt K in the southeast. There is a wide rift leading from the southern end of the crater floor towards Van de Graaff.

Vertregt was named by the IAU in 1979 after Dutch chemist Marinus Vertregt. Vertregt was known as &quot;Crater 369&quot; prior to naming.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Vertregt.
