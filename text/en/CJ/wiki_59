<text>Turkmens (, , , ; historically &quot;the Turkmen&quot;) are a Turkic ethnic group native to Central Asia, living mainly in Turkmenistan, northern and northeastern regions of Iran and north-western Afghanistan. Sizeable groups of Turkmens are found also in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and the North Caucasus (Stavropol Krai). They speak the Turkmen language, which is classified as a part of the Eastern Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages.

In the early Middle ages, Turkmens called themselves Oghuz; in the Middle Ages, they took the ethnonym Turkmen. These early Oghuz Turkmens moved westward from the Altai Mountains through the Siberian steppes, and settled in the region now known as Turkmenistan. Further westward migration of the Turkmen tribes from the territory of modern Turkmenistan and the rest of Central Asia started from the 11th century and continued until the 18th century. These Turkmen tribes played a significant role in the ethnic formation of such peoples as Anatolian Turks, Turkmens of Iraq, and Syria, as well as the Turkic population of Iran and Azerbaijan. To preserve their independence, those tribes that remained in Turkmenistan were united in military alliances, although remnants of tribal relations remained until the 20th century. Their traditional occupations were farming, cattle breeding, and various crafts. Ancient samples of applied art (primarily carpets and jewelry) indicate a high level of folk art culture.

The Seljuks, Khwarazmians, Qara Qoyunlu, Aq Qoyunlu, Ottomans, and Afsharids are also believed to descend from the Turkmen tribes of Qiniq, Begdili, Yiwa, Bayandur, Kayi, and Afshar respectively.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;Turkmen&quot; is generally applied to the Turkic tribes that have been distributed across the Near and Middle East, as well as Central Asia, from the 11th century to modern times. Originally, all Turkic tribes who belonged to the Turkic dynastic mythological system and/or converted to Islam (e.g. Karluks, Oghuz Turks, Khalajs, Kanglys, Kipchaks, etc.) were designated &quot;Turkmens&quot;. Only later did this word come to refer to a specific ethnonym. The generally accepted view for the etymology of the name is that it comes from &quot;Türk&quot; and the Turkic emphasizing suffix &quot;-men&quot;, meaning &quot;&#x27;most Turkish of the Turks&#x27; or &#x27;pure-blooded Turks.&#x27;&quot; A folk etymology, dating back to the Middle Ages and found in the works of al-Biruni and Mahmud al-Kashghari, instead derives the suffix &quot;-men&quot; from the Persian suffix &quot;-mānand&quot;, with the resulting word meaning &quot;like a Turk&quot;. While formerly the dominant etymology in modern scholarship, this mixed Turkic-Persian derivation is now typically viewed as incorrect. An alternative etymology was proposed by 16th-century Ottoman historian Mehmed Neşri, who derived it from the Persian phrase &quot;Turk-i iman&quot; (), meaning &quot;Turk of the faith&quot; (i.e. Islam). This theory was rejected as incorrect by turkologist Ármin Vámbéry, who argued that it relied upon an incorrect understanding of Persian grammar:

Despite various criticisms, it remains a theory advocated by some today, such as linguist and ethnographer Dávid Somfai. Former president of Turkmenistan Saparmurad Niyazov was also among the advocates of this etymology, although he altered the meaning of the words, writing in his Ruhnama that, rather than &quot;Muslim Turk&quot;, it meant &quot;made of light&quot;:

Today, the terms Turkmen and Turkoman are usually restricted to two Turkic groups: the Turkmen people of Turkmenistan and adjacent parts of Central Asia and Iran, and the Turkomans of Iraq and Syria.

==Origins==

Türkmens were mentioned near the end of the 10th century A.D in Islamic literature by the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi in &quot;Ahsan Al-Taqasim Fi Ma&#x27;rifat Al-Aqalim&quot;. In his work, which was completed in 987 A.D, al-Muqaddasi writes about Turkmens twice while depicting the region as the frontier of the Muslim possessions in Central Asia.

Earlier references to Türkmen might be &quot;trwkkmˀn&quot; (if not &quot;trkwmˀn&quot; &quot;translator&quot;), mentioned in an 8th-century Sogdian letter and 特拘夢 &quot;Tejumeng&quot; (&lt; MC ZS *&quot;dək̚-kɨo-mɨuŋH&quot;), another name of Sogdia, besides &quot;Suyi&quot; 粟弋 and &quot;Sute&quot; 粟特, according to the Chinese encyclopedia Tongdian. However, even if 特拘夢 might have transcribed &quot;Türkmen&quot;, these &quot;Türkmens&quot; might be Karluks instead of modern Türkmens&#x27; Oghuz-speaking ancestors; as &quot;Türkmen&quot; might be the Karluks&#x27; equivalent of the Göktürks&#x27; political term &quot;Kök Türk&quot;. Zuev (1960) links the tribal name 餘沒渾 &quot;Yumeihun&quot; (&lt; MC *&quot;iʷо-muət-хuən&quot;) in Tang Huiyao to the name Yomut of a modern Turkmen clan.

Towards the end of the 11th century, in &quot;Divânü Lügat&#x27;it-Türk&quot; (Compendium of the Turkic Dialects), Mahmud Kashgari uses &quot;Türkmen&quot; synonymously with &quot;Oğuz&quot;. He describes Oghuz as a Turkic tribe and says that Oghuz and Karluks were both known as Turkmens.

The origins of the Turkic peoples has been a topic of much discussion, but evidence points either to a homeland in South Central Siberia, close to the Altai Mountains and Lake Baikal or farther East in Mongolia. Archaeogenetic, historical and linguistic evidence suggests that the earliest Turkic peoples were &quot;within or close to the Northeast Asian genepool&quot; but made up of multiple heterogeneous groups, with their exact location of their homeland remaining disputed. The genetic and historical evidence suggests that the early Turkic peoples, including the ancestors of the Turkmen people - Oghuz Turks, harbored both West-Eurasian and Northeast Asian ancestry and were located in and around the Altai region and western Mongolia. Later medieval Turkic groups exhibited a wide range of both West-Eurasian and East Asian physical appearances and genetic origins, in part through long-term contact with neighboring Iranian and Mongolic peoples.

Before the formation of the Turkmen ethnicity, the Oghuz Turks inhabited parts of Transoxiana, the western portion of Turkestan, a region that largely corresponds to much of Central Asia as far east as Xinjiang. Famous historian and ruler of Khwarazm of the XVII century Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur links the origin of all Turkmens to 24 Oghuz tribes in his literary work &quot;Genealogy of the Turkmens&quot;.
In Byzantine, then in the European sources and later in the American tradition, Turkmens were called Turkomans, in the countries of the Near and Middle East - Turkmens, as well as Torkaman, Terekeme; in Kievan Rus - Torkmens; in the Duchy of Moscow - Taurmen; and in the Tsarist Russia - Turkoman and Trukhmen.

In the 7th century AD, Oghuz tribes had moved westward from the Altai Mountains through the Siberian steppes, and settled in this region. They also penetrated as far west as the Volga basin and the Balkans. These early Turkmens are believed to have mixed with native Sogdian peoples and lived as pastoral nomads until being conquered by the Russians in the 19th century.
Migration of the Turkmen tribes from the territory of Turkmenistan and the rest of Central Asia in the south-west direction began mainly from the 11th century and continued until the 18th century. These Turkmen tribes played a significant role in the ethnic formation of such peoples as Anatolian Turks, Turkmens of Iraq and Syria, as well as the Turkic population of Iran and Azerbaijan. To preserve their independence, those tribes that remained in Turkmenistan were united in military alliances, although remnants of tribal relations remained until the 20th century. Their traditional occupations were farming, cattle breeding, and various crafts. Ancient samples of applied art (primarily carpets and jewelry) indicate a high level of folk art culture.

==Genetics==
Haplogroup Q-M242 is commonly found in Siberia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia. This haplogroup forms a large percentage of the paternal lineages of Turkmens.

Grugni &quot;et al.&quot; (2012) found Q-M242 in 42.6% (29/68) of a sample of Turkmens from Golestan, Iran. Di Cristofaro &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) found Q-M25 in 31.1% (23/74) and Q-M346 in 2.7% (2/74) for a total of 33.8% (25/74) Q-M242 in a sample of Turkmens from Jawzjan. Karafet &quot;et al.&quot; (2018) found Q-M25 in 50.0% (22/44) of another sample of Turkmens from Turkmenistan. Haplogroup Q has seen its highest frequencies in the Turkmens from Karakalpakstan (mainly Yomut) at 73%.

A genetic study on maternal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups of a Turkmen sample describes a mixture of mostly West Eurasian maternal lineages and a minority of East Eurasian lineages. Turkmens also have two unusual mtDNA markers with polymorphic characteristics, only found in Turkmens and southern Siberians.

==History==

Turkmens belong to the Oghuz tribes, who originated on the periphery of Central Asia and founded gigantic empires beginning from the 3rd millennium BC. Subsequently, Turkmen tribes founded lasting dynasties in Central Asia, Middle East, Persia and Anatolia that had a profound influence on the course of history of those regions. The most prominent of those dynasties were the Ghaznavids, Seljuks, Ottomans, Afsharids and Qajars. Representatives of the Turkmen tribes of Ive and Bayandur were also the founders of the short-lived, but formidable states of Kara Koyunlu and Ak Koyunlu Turkmens respectively.

Turkmens that stayed in Central Asia largely survived unaffected by the Mongol period due to their semi-nomadic lifestyle and became traders along the Caspian, which led to contacts with Eastern Europe. Following the decline of the Mongols, Tamerlane conquered the area and his Timurid Empire would rule, until it too fractured, as the Safavids, Khanate of Bukhara, and Khanate of Khiva all contested the area. The expanding Russian Empire took notice of Turkmenistan&#x27;s extensive cotton industry, during the reign of Peter the Great, and invaded the area. Following the decisive Battle of Geok Tepe in January 1881, the bulk of Turkmen tribes found themselves under the rule of the Russian Emperor, which was formalized in the Akhal Treaty between Russia and Persia. After the Russian Revolution, Soviet control was established by 1921, and in 1924 Turkmenistan became the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic. Turkmenistan gained independence in 1991.

==Culture and society==
===Religion===
The Turkmen of Turkmenistan, like their kin in Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Iran are predominantly Muslims. According the U.S. Department of State&#x27;s &quot;International Religious Freedom Report&quot; for 2019,According to U.S. government estimates, the country is 89 percent Muslim (mostly Sunni), 9 percent Eastern Orthodox, and 2 percent other. There are small communities of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Shia Muslims, Baha’is, Roman Catholics, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and evangelical Christians, including Baptists and Pentecostals. Most ethnic Russians and Armenians identify as Orthodox Christian and generally are members of the Russian Orthodox Church or Armenian Apostolic Church. Some ethnic Russians and Armenians are also members of smaller Protestant groups. There are small pockets of Shia Muslims, consisting largely of ethnic Iranians, Azeris, and Kurds, some located in Ashgabat, with others along the border with Iran and in the western city of Turkmenbashy.

The Turkmen adopted Islam between the 12th and 14th centuries. Sufi orders like the Yasawiya and Kubrawiya greatly contributed to the conversion of the Turkmens to Islam.

The great majority of Turkmen readily identify themselves as Muslims and acknowledge Islam as an integral part of their cultural heritage. The country of Turkmenistan encourages the conceptualization of &quot;Turkmen Islam&quot;, or worship that is often mixed with veneration of elders and saints, life-cycle rituals, and Sufi practices.

Since Turkmenistan&#x27;s independence saw an increase in religious practices and the development of institutions like the Muftiate and the building of mosques, today it is often regulated.

The government leadership of Turkmenistan often uses Islam to legitimize its role in society by sponsoring holiday celebrations such as iftar dinners during Ramadan and presidential pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. This sponsorship has validated the country&#x27;s two presidents ( and ) as pious Turkmen, giving them an aura of cultural authority.

The Russian Academy of Sciences has identified many instances of syncretic influence of pre-Islamic Turkic belief systems on practice of Islam among Turkmen, including placing offerings before trees. The Turkmen word &quot;taňry&quot;, meaning &quot;God&quot;, derives from the Turkic &quot;Tengri&quot;, the name of the supreme god in the pre-Islamic Turkic pantheon. The Turkmen language features a multitude of euphemisms for &quot;wolf&quot;, because of a belief that speaking the actual word while tending a flock of sheep will invoke a wolf&#x27;s appearance. In other examples of syncretism, some infertile Turkmen women, rather than praying, step or jump over a live wolf in order to assist them in getting pregnant, and children born subsequently are typically given names associated with wolves; alternatively the mother may visit shrines of Muslim saints. The future is divined by reading of dried camel dung by special fortune tellers.

===Language===

Turkmen (Turkmen: , ) is a Turkic language spoken by the Turkmens of Central Asia, mainly of Turkmenistan, Iran, and Afghanistan. It has an estimated five million native speakers in Turkmenistan, a further 719,000 speakers in Northeastern Iran and 1.5 million people in Northwestern Afghanistan.

The Turkmen language is closely related to Azerbaijani, Turkish, Gagauz, Qashqai, and Crimean Tatar, sharing common linguistic features with each of those languages. There is a high degree of mutual intelligibility between these languages. However, the closest language of Turkmen is considered Khorasani Turkic, spoken in northeastern regions of Iran and with which it shares the eastern subbranch of Oghuz languages, as well as Khorezm, the Oghuz dialect of Uzbek language spoken mainly along the Turkmenistan border.

The standardized form of Turkmen (spoken in Turkmenistan) is based on the Teke dialect, while Iranian Turkmen uses mostly the Yomud dialect, and Afghan Turkmen use the Ersary dialect.

In Iran, the Turkmen language comes second after the Azerbaijani language in terms of the number of speakers of Turkic languages of Iran.

===Literature===

Turkmen literature comprises oral compositions and written texts in old Oghuz Turkic and Turkmen languages. Turkmens have joint claims to a great number of literary works written in Old Oghuz Turkic and Persian (by Seljuks in 11-12th centuries) languages with other people of the Oghuz Turkic origin, mainly of Azerbaijan and Turkey. This works include, but are not limited to the Book of Dede Korkut, Gorogly and others. The medieval Turkmen literature was heavily influenced by Arabic and Persian, and used mostly Arabic alphabet.

There is general consensus, however, that distinctively Turkmen literature originated in 18th century with the poetry of Magtymguly Pyragy, who is considered the father of the Turkmen literature. Other prominent Turkmen poets of that era are Döwletmämmet Azady (Magtymguly&#x27;s father), Nurmuhammet Andalyp, Abdylla Şabende, Şeýdaýy, Mahmyt Gaýyby and Gurbanally Magrupy.

In the 20th century, Turkmenistan&#x27;s most prominent Turkmen-language writer was Berdi Kerbabayev, whose novel &quot;Decisive Step&quot;, later made into a motion picture directed by Alty Garlyyev, is considered the apotheosis of modern Turkmen fiction. It earned him the USSR State Prize for Literature in 1948.

=== Music ===
The musical art of the Turkmens is an integral part of the musical art of the Turkic peoples. The music of the Turkmen people is closely related to the Kyrgyz and Kazakh folk forms. Important musical traditions include traveling singers called &quot;bakshy&quot;, who sing with instruments such as the two-stringed lute called dutar.

Other important musical instruments are gopuz, tüydük, dombura, and gyjak. The most famous Turkmen bakshys are those who lived in the 19th century: Amangeldi Gönübek, Gulgeldi ussa, Garadali Gokleng, Yegen Oraz bakshy, Hajygolak, Nobatnyyaz bakshy, Oglan bakshy, Durdy bakshy, Shukur bakshy, Chowdur bakshy and others. Usually they narrated the woeful and gloomy events of the Turkmen history through their music. The names and music of these bakshys have become legendary among the Turkmen people, and passed orally from generation to generation.

The Central Asian classical music tradition muqam is also present in Turkmenistan. In the 20th century, Danatar Ovezov began composing classical music using Turkmen themes, and that classical expression of Turkmen motifs and melodies reached its apotheosis in the compositions of Nury Halmammedov.

===Folk crafts===
Embroidery
Turkmen pictorial embroidery became widespread in the Scythian period and reached great perfection in other periods. It is known that for a long time the Turkmens were engaged in the production of silk as the main material for embroidery, and Turkmen women and girls embroidered their dresses with colored silks. All these deeds are clearly expressed in the songs of Turkmen women and in the oral Turkmen literature.

The main materials for Turkmen embroidery are thread and fabric. There are several types of threads: natural threads such as silk and cotton threads; synthetic and acrylic threads. As for the types of fabrics, silk and woolen fabrics are usually used for embroidery.

It is customary for the Turkmens to embroider with colored silks girls&#x27; and men&#x27;s skullcaps (tahya), collars and sleeves of women&#x27;s dresses (and in more distant times, men&#x27;s shirts), the lower part of pants protruding from under the dress, various small bags for storing small things.

Weaving

Weaving is one of the types of home craft that has its roots in the deep past. During excavations of many ancient and early medieval settlements on the territory of Turkmenistan, archaeologists discovered fragments of cotton and woolen fabrics, the analysis of which does not exclude local production: the warp and wefts (transverse threads) have the same thickness, the yarn is single, the weave is simple.

The techniques of weaving craft of Turkmen women are similar to homespun production of other peoples. First, there were three stages of preparation of different types of threads. To obtain cotton thread: 1) cleaning cotton from seeds using a small machine, loosening the resulting fiber with rods, rolling into small bunches; 2) spinning the fiber with a spinning wheel, twisting it into a thread and winding the threads into skeins; 3) winding the threads on the hook and bobbin. For woolen thread: 1) washing and drying wool, scuttling with twigs until a fluffy mass is obtained; 2) combing, loosening, yarn and twisting into a thread with a spindle, winding into skeins; 3) dyeing skeins. For silk thread: 1) cleaning and unwinding (sarmak) cocoons (goza) with a spinning wheel (parh), steaming in a boiler with boiling water; 2) fixing the threads on the spindle using a rotating spinning wheel, twisting the threads into one thread, rewinding them from the spindle into a ball, then into skeins; 3) dyeing skeins, drying in the sun.

Home weaving was extremely widespread throughout the territory of Turkmenistan. In almost every family, weaving skills were instilled in girls from an early age. They began to learn the art of making yarn, weaving and sewing from the age of 8–10. Fabrics, depending on the purpose, were divided into various types: for sewing women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s clothing, thin fabric for camel wool dressing gowns, for cotton tablecloths was highly valued. Bags for storing grain and flour were made of fabric of thick twisted yarn, narrow strong strips of fabric (5–12 cm) were used to fasten the poles to the yurt lattice. Using a simple technique of weaving, the craftswomen achieved a great effect in the manufacture of peculiar national fabrics, which cannot be reproduced in mechanical production: a loom consisting of 3-4 columns dug into the ground, a transverse roller, a heald. Tools made of wood in the form of a saber were used to seal the weft threads.

===Cuisine===


Characteristics of traditional Turkmen cuisine are rooted in the largely nomadic nature of day-to-day life prior to the Soviet period coupled with a long local tradition, dating back millennia before the arrival of the Turkmen in the region, of white wheat production. Baked goods, especially flat bread () typically baked in a tandoor, make up a large proportion of the daily diet, along with cracked wheat porridge (), wheat puffs (), and dumplings (). Since sheep-, goat-, and camel husbandry are traditional mainstays of nomadic Turkmen, mutton, goat meat, and camel meat were most commonly eaten, variously ground and stuffed in dumplings, boiled in soup, or grilled on spits in chunks () or as fingers of ground, spiced meat (). Rice for plov was reserved for festive occasions. Due to lack of refrigeration in nomad camps, dairy products from sheep-, goat-, and camel milk were fermented to keep them from spoiling quickly. Fish consumption was largely limited to tribes inhabiting the Caspian Sea shoreline. Fruits and vegetables were scarce, and in nomad camps limited mainly to carrots, squash, pumpkin, and onions. Inhabitants of oases enjoyed more varied diets, with access to pomegranate-, fig-, and stone fruit orchards; vineyards; and of course melons. Areas with cotton production could use cottonseed oil and sheep herders used fat from the fat-tailed sheep. The major traditional imported product was tea.

The Royal Geographical Society reported in 1882,The food of the Tekkes [&quot;sic&quot;] consists of well-prepared pillaus and of game; also of fermented camels&#x27; milk, melons, and water-melons. They use their fingers in conveying food to their mouths, but guests are provided with spoons.

In sharp contrast to other Central Asian and Turkic ethnic groups, Turkmen do not eat horse meat, and in fact eating of horse meat is prohibited by law in Turkmenistan.

Conquest by the Russian Empire in the 1880s introduced new foods, including such meats as beef, pork, and chicken, as well as potatoes, tomatoes, cabbage, and cucumbers, though they did not find widespread use in most Turkmen households until the Soviet period. While now consumed widely, they are, strictly speaking, not considered &quot;traditional&quot;.

===Nomadic heritage===

Before the establishment of Soviet power in Central Asia, it was difficult to identify distinct ethnic groups in the region. Sub-ethnic and supra-ethnic loyalties were more important to people than ethnicity. When asked to identify themselves, most Central Asians would name their kin group, neighborhood, village, religion or the state in which they lived; the idea that a state should exist to serve an ethnic group was unknown. That said, most Turkmen could identify the tribe to which they belonged, though they might not identify themselves as Turkmen.

Most Turkmen were nomads until the 19th century when they began to settle the area south of the Amu Darya. Many Turkmen became semi-nomadic, herding sheep and camels during spring, summer, and fall, but planting crops, wintering in oasis camps, and harvesting the crops in the summer and autumn. As a rule they did not settle in cities and towns until the advent of the Soviet government. This mobile lifestyle precluded identification with anyone outside one&#x27;s kin group and led to frequent conflicts between different Turkmen tribes, particularly regarding access to water.

In collaboration with the local nationalists, the Soviet government sought to transform the Turkmen and other similar ethnic groups in the USSR into modern socialist nations that based their identity on a fixed territory and a common language. Prior to the Battle of Geok Tepe in January 1881 and subsequent conquest of Merv in 1884, the Turkmen &quot;retained the condition of predatory, horse-riding nomads, who were greatly feared by their neighbours as &#x27;man-stealing Turks.&#x27; Until subjugated by the Russians, the Turkmens were a warlike people, who conquered their neighbours and regularly captured ethnic Persians for sale as slaves in Khiva. It was their boast that not one Persian had crossed their frontier except with a rope round his neck.&quot;

The Soviet-led standardization of the Turkmen language, education, and projects to promote ethnic Turkmen in industry, government and higher education led growing numbers of Turkmen to identify with a larger national Turkmen culture rather than with sub-national, pre-modern forms of identity. After gaining independence from the Soviet Union, Turkmen historians went to great lengths to prove that the Turkmen had inhabited their current territory since time immemorial; some historians even tried to deny the nomadic heritage of the Turkmen.

Turkmen lifestyle was heavily invested in horsemanship and as a prominent horse culture, Turkmen horse-breeding was an ages old tradition. Before the Soviet era, a proverb stated that the Turkmen&#x27;s home was where his horse happened to stand. In spite of changes prompted during the Soviet period, the Ahal Teke tribe in southern Turkmenistan has remained very well known for its horses, the Akhal-Teke &quot;desert horse&quot; – and the horse breeding tradition has returned to its previous prominence in recent years.

Many tribal customs still survive among modern Turkmen. Unique to Turkmen culture is &quot;kalim&quot; which is a groom&#x27;s &quot;dowry&quot;, that can be quite expensive and often results in the widely practiced tradition of bridal kidnapping. In something of a modern parallel, in 2001, President Saparmurat Niyazov had introduced a state enforced &quot;kalim&quot;, which required all foreigners who wanted to marry a Turkmen woman to pay a sum of no less than $50,000. The law was repealed in March 2005.

Other customs include the consultation of tribal elders, whose advice is often eagerly sought and respected. Many Turkmen still live in extended families where various generations can be found under the same roof, especially in rural areas.

The music of the nomadic and rural Turkmen people reflects rich oral traditions, where epics such as Koroglu are usually sung by itinerant bards. These itinerant singers are called &quot;bakshy&quot; and sing either a cappella or with instruments such as the dutar, a two-stringed lute.

===Society today===
Since Turkmenistan&#x27;s independence in 1991, a cultural revival has taken place with the return of a moderate form of Islam and celebration of Novruz, the Persian New Year marking the onset of spring.

Turkmen can be divided into various social classes including the urban intelligentsia and workers whose role in society is different from that of the rural peasantry. Secularism and atheism remain prominent for many Turkmen intellectuals who favor moderate social changes and often view extreme religiosity and cultural revival with some measure of distrust.

The five traditional carpet rosettes, or gul, called &quot;göl&quot; in Turkmen, that form motifs in the country&#x27;s state emblem and flag, represent the five major Turkmen tribes.

===Sport===

Sports have historically been an important part of Turkmen life. Such sports as horseback riding and Goresh have been praised in Turkmen literature. During the Soviet era, Turkmen athletes competed in numerous competitions, including Olympic games as part of the Soviet Union team and, in 1992, as part of the Unified Team. After Turkmenistan gained her independence, new ways of establishing physical and sports movements in the country began to emerge. To implement a new sports policy, new multi-purpose stadiums, physical education and health complexes, sports schools and facilities were built in all regions of the country. Turkmenistan also has a modern Olympic village which hosted 2017 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games, and is unparalleled in Central Asia.

Turkmenistan supports the country&#x27;s sports movements and encourages sports on a state level. While football remains the most popular sport, such sports as Turkmen goresh, horseback riding and lately ice hockey are also very popular among Turkmens.

==Demographics and population distribution==
In 1911, the population of Turkmens in the Russian Empire was estimated to be 290,170, and it was &quot;conjectured that their total number [in all countries] does not exceed 350,000&quot;. In 1995, Turkmen academics estimated ...there are 125,000 Turkmen living in Uzbekistan, 40,000 in Russia and 22,000 in Tajikistan. The largest group of Turkmens is in Iran (850,000), Afghanistan (700,000), Iraq (235,000), Turkey (150,000), Syria (60,000), and China (85,000). In total, the number of Turkmens living abroad is about 2.2 million. Today the Turkmen people of Central Asia and near neighbors live in:
* Turkmenistan, where some 85% of the population of 5,042,920 people (July 2006 est.) are ethnic Turkmen. In addition, an estimated 1,200 Turkmen refugees from northern Afghanistan currently reside in Turkmenistan due to the ravages of the Soviet–Afghan War and factional fighting in Afghanistan which saw the rise and fall of the Taliban. 
* Afghanistan, where as of 2006, 200,000 ethnic Turkmen are concentrated primarily along the Turkmen-Afghan border in the provinces of Faryab, Jowzjan, Samangan and Baghlan. There are also communities in Balkh and Kunduz Provinces.
* Iran, where about 719,000 Turkmen are primarily concentrated in the provinces of Golestān and North Khorasan.

===Turkmens in Iran===
Iranian Turkmens are a branch of Turkmen people who live mainly in northern and northeastern regions of Iran. Their region is called Turkmen Sahra and includes substantial parts of Golestan province. Representatives of such contemporary Turkmen tribes as Yomut, Goklen, Īgdīr, Saryk, Salar and Teke have lived in Iran since the 16th century, though ethnic history of Turkmens in Iran starts with the Seljuk conquest of the region in the 11th century.

===Turkmens in Afghanistan===

The Afghan Turkmen population in the 1990s was estimated at 200,000. The original Turkmen groups came from east of the Caspian Sea into northwestern Afghanistan at various periods, particularly after the end of the 19th century when the Russians moved into their territory. They established settlements from Balkh Province to Herat Province, where they are now concentrated; smaller groups settled in Kunduz Province. Others came in considerable numbers as a result of the failure of the Basmachi revolts against the Bolsheviks in the 1920s. Turkmen tribes, of which there are twelve major groups in Afghanistan, base their structure on genealogies traced through the male line. Senior members wield considerable authority. Formerly a nomadic and warlike people feared for their lightning raids on caravans, Turkmen in Afghanistan are farmer-herdsmen and important contributors to the economy. They brought karakul sheep to Afghanistan and are also renowned makers of carpets, which, with karakul pelts, are major hard currency export commodities. Turkmen jewelry is also highly prized.

===Turkmens of Stavropol Krai of Russia===

A long established Turkmen colony resides in Stavropol Krai of southern Russia. The local ethnic Russian population often refers to them as Trukhmen, and these Turkmen sometimes use the self-designation Turkpen. According to the 2010 Census of Russia, they numbered 15,048, and accounted for 0.5% of the total population of Stavropol Krai.

The Turkmens are said to have migrated into the Caucasus in the 17th century, mostly from the Mangyshlak region. These migrants belonged mainly to the Chowdur (in Russian &quot;Chaudorov&quot; or &quot;Chavodur&quot;), Sonchadj and Ikdir tribes. The early settlers were nomadic but over time became sedentary. In their cultural life the Trukhmens of today differ very little from their neighbours and are now settled farmers and stockbreeders.

Although the Turkmen language belongs to the Oghuz group of Turkic languages, in Stavropol it has been strongly influenced by the Nogai language, which belongs to the Kipchak group. The phonetic system, grammatical structure and to some extent also the vocabulary have been somewhat influenced.

<text>The Envoy is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Warren Zevon. The album was released on July 16, 1982, by Asylum Records. The album&#x27;s lack of commercial success caused Zevon&#x27;s label to terminate his recording contract.

The title track was inspired by veteran American diplomat Philip Habib&#x27;s shuttle diplomacy during the 1982 Lebanon War.

Zevon later said of the album&#x27;s lack of success, &quot;I would start a record more or less as soon as I&#x27;d finished the one previous to it, and they took longer, cost more and more, and actually did sort of less and less well. Particularly &quot;The Envoy&quot;. I was a little discouraged after that.&quot;. 

Despite the fact that &quot;Let Nothing Come Between You&quot;, a love ballad written by Zevon, charted as high as 24 on the Mainstream Billboard Rock chart, Asylum dropped Zevon after the commercial failure of The Envoy. It would be five years before Zevon made another studio album, 1987&#x27;s &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot;, released on Virgin Records.

<doc id="1100931" wikidata="Q3472167" url="?curid=1100931" title="Hampton Beach, New Hampshire">
<text>Hampton Beach is a village district, census-designated place, and beach resort in the town of Hampton, New Hampshire, United States, along the Atlantic Ocean. Its population at the 2020 census was 2,598. Hampton Beach is in Rockingham County, approximately south of Portsmouth. The community is a popular tourist destination and the busiest beach community in New Hampshire. Ocean Boulevard, the main street along the beach, includes a boardwalk, many shops and businesses, several seasonal hotels, and the Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom, which hosts national acts in the summer. Hampton Beach State Park was named one of four &quot;Superstar&quot; beaches in the United States in 2011, for having had perfect water-quality testing results in each of the previous three years.

== History ==
The Hampton Beach Village District was established on June 26, 1907, to provide electric power and water to the summer tourist community. In 1923, the village&#x27;s first fire station was built, after two fires destroyed a large section of the beach settlement in 1919 and 1922. The original fire station was razed and replaced in 2014.

On February 26, 2010, a windstorm-fueled fire burned down all the buildings in a block at Hampton Beach, including the Surf Hotel, Happy Hampton Arcade, and Mrs. Mitchell&#x27;s Gift Shop. The fire started in the Surf Hotel and was spread to the other buildings by high winds. The cause of this fire is unknown. The area has been rebuilt, with a larger hotel and a new Mrs. Mitchell&#x27;s.

On July 29, 2023, a single-engine Piper PA-18 crashed off the shore of the beach. Only one person was aboard the aircraft at the time and was not injured. 

== Geography ==
Most of the resort village lies on a barrier spit separated from the mainland by a large estuary system known as Hampton Harbor. The estuary serves as the mouth of several rivers, the largest being the Hampton River from the northwest. New Hampshire Route 1A serves as the main north-south route through the beach area, connecting the village to Seabrook Beach to the south (across the Hampton Bridge traversing the Hampton Harbor Inlet) and Little Boar&#x27;s Head in North Hampton to the north. Access from the west is provided by three roads: New Hampshire Route 101 is the main access point to the densely populated southern resort area from most points west, while Winnacunnet Road (officially New Hampshire Route 101E) provides access to the less developed areas in the northern part of the village near a large salt marsh conservation area. Winnacunnet Road marks the northern edge of the census-designated place, but New Hampshire Route 27, known locally as High Street, marks the northern edge of the resort area.

The heaviest development lies south of the Ashworth-by-the-Sea hotel, located at the eastern terminus of NH 101 where it meets NH 1A, known locally as Ocean Boulevard. From this point south, NH 1A splits into two one-way streets: the southbound Ashworth Avenue, and the northbound Ocean Boulevard. Cross streets through this area run from A Street in the north to M Street in the south. The southern end of the spit is mostly state park, with little to no buildings or development. North of the junction of 101 and 1A, the area is much less developed, dominated mostly by a large salt marsh conservation area, with small businesses and bungalows along Ocean Boulevard (NH 1A). North of Winnacunnet Road (and outside the CDP), a second area of heavier development begins with Kings Highway parallel to Ocean Boulevard, and cross streets numbered from 1st Street in the south to 19th Street in the north. The resort ends at the Windjammer Hotel at its northern end, at the junction of NH 27 and NH 1A.

The census-designated place (CDP) portion of Hampton Beach extends from the Seabrook town line in the south to Winnacunnet Road in the north. The western border, separating it from the Hampton CDP, follows Tide Mill Creek within the Hampton Saltmarsh, and the eastern border is the Atlantic Ocean shoreline. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Hampton Beach CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 14.88%, are water.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 2,275 people, 1,227 households, and 555 families residing in the CDP. There were 3,158 housing units, of which 1,931, or 61.1%, were vacant on Census Day. 1,443 of the vacant units were seasonal or vacation rental units. The racial makeup of the CDP was 95.8% white, 0.4% African American, 0.3% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.8% some other race, and 1.9% from two or more races. 1.6% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Of the 1,227 households in the CDP, 14.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.6% were headed by married couples living together, 9.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 54.8% were non-families. 45.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.1% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.83, and the average family size was 2.49.

12.0% of residents in the CDP were under the age of 18, 6.6% were from age 18 to 24, 23.6% were from 25 to 44, 41.7% were from 45 to 64, and 16.0% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 49.3 years. For every 100 females, there were 109.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 110.0 males.

For the period 2011-15, the estimated median annual income for a household was $53,095, and the median income for a family was $78,929. Male full-time workers had a median income of $56,875 versus $70,461 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $48,728. 14.8% of the population and 12.7% of families were below the poverty line, along with 44.7% of people under the age of 18 and 0.0% of people 65 or older.

== Attractions and events ==
The New Hampshire Marine Memorial is located on the beach along Route 1A at the terminus of New Hampshire Route 101.

The Hampton Bridge carries Route 1A south across the Hampton Harbor inlet into Seabrook.

The Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom has been the center attraction at Hampton Beach for more than 100 years. The Ballroom continues to draw some of the top names in entertainment. Recently, the Ballroom placed in the top 30 for worldwide ticket sales in venues under 3,000 seats.

Hampton Beach Seafood Festival - Since 1988, the Hampton Area Chamber of Commerce and Seafood Festival Committee have helped put New Hampshire on the map as a vacation destination. The Hampton Beach Seafood Festival has a profound effect on seacoast businesses, the community, and the overall economy of the area. Restaurants, lodging, shops, and businesses in general depend on the Seafood Festival as the primary contributor to their bottom line. Many Chamber members say it is even bigger than the &quot;4th of July&quot; in sales volume. The Festival, held the weekend after Labor Day, is also instrumental in extending the summer season. Dozens of non-profit organizations also earn a major portion of their income through revenues earned at the Festival, allowing them to continue to support their causes that benefit the citizens of New Hampshire. Event attendance is now estimated as exceeding 150,000.

Hampton Beach Sand Sculpture Competition - Since 2001, the Hampton Area Chamber of Commerce has sponsored, with the help of Seaside Hotel, a sand sculpture competition that has brought numerous sculptors from across America to Hampton Beach in mid-June. The 4 day contest is seen by thousands and then put up for illumination for two weeks. Prizes (top prize of $50,000) are rewarded via fan voting and through the Chamber.

There are fireworks on the 4th of July and every Wednesday of the summer at 9:30 pm. There are also fireworks held to cap the Hampton Beach Seafood Festival in September, with a launch scheduled for that Saturday at 8:15 pm.

<text>TRAX is a light rail system in the Salt Lake Valley of Utah, in the United States, serving Salt Lake City and many of its suburbs throughout Salt Lake County. The system&#x27;s official name, Transit Express, is rarely, if ever, used. The system is operated by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA). All TRAX trains are electric, receiving power from overhead wires.

TRAX has 51 stations on three lines. The Blue Line provides service from Downtown Salt Lake City to Draper. The Red Line provides service from the University of Utah to the Daybreak Community of South Jordan. The Green Line provides service from Salt Lake City International Airport to West Valley City. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

== Operations ==

=== Service characteristics ===
TRAX operates seven days a week, with the exception of some holidays. It operates Monday through Friday from approximately 4:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. with a 15-minute headway on each line during the entirety of operating hours. It operates weekends from approximately 5:00 am to nearly midnight, with a 15-minute headway on Saturdays and a 30-minute headway on Sundays.

=== Lines and stations ===

=== Rolling stock ===
117 active railcars
* 23 Siemens SD-100 LRVs (1001–1023) built 1998
* 17 Siemens SD-160 LRVs (1024–1040) built 2001–2003
* 77 Siemens S70 LRVs (1101–1177) built 2010–2012
29 UTDC LRVs (1041–1069) were purchased second-hand from the Santa Clara VTA in 2004 and refurbished for service on TRAX. These were withdrawn from service in 2018.

To handle the increased crowds during the 2002 Winter Olympics, 29 Kinki Sharyo LRVs were borrowed from the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) between 2001 and 2003.

In 2024, UTA ordered 20 Stadler Citylink vehicles, with upwards to 80 vehicles, to replace the Siemens SD-100 and SD-160 LRVs. They are expected to enter service in 2028.

Varying based on projected ridership, the Blue Line typically operates 3-4 car trains, the Green Line 2-3 car trains, and the Red Line 2-4 car trains.

== History ==
The first line, running from downtown Salt Lake City south to Sandy, was completed in 1999. The second line from downtown to the University of Utah was completed in 2001 and extended in 2003. An extension to the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub was completed in April 2008. In August 2011, two extensions to South Jordan and West Valley City were completed. With the opening of these two extensions in 2011, the TRAX lines were renamed as colors instead of destinations, with the Blue Line running from the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub to Sandy, the Red Line running from the University of Utah Medical Center to the Daybreak community in South Jordan, and the Green Line running from the intermodal hub to the West Valley Intermodal Hub.

In 2013 the Green Line was realigned slightly north and away from the Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub, allowing for the opening of the extension to the Salt Lake City International Airport. Several months later, in August 2013, the Blue Line was extended further south to Draper (which opened August 18, 2013). The extensions to South Jordan, West Valley City, Draper, and the Airport were funded in part by a Salt Lake County sales tax increase that would pay for all four of the proposed TRAX extensions. A letter of intent signed with the Federal Transit Administration on September 24, 2007, secured the remaining funding for the light rail lines.

Both the University Line and its extension to the University Medical Center were completed ahead of schedule. A daily ridership of 15,000 was expected for the initial line in 1999. By the beginning of 2008, the expanded system of served an estimated 40,000 passengers each day. Ridership for the fourth quarter of 2012 was reported to be at 60,600, making it the ninth-busiest light rail system in the United States.

Light rail in the Salt Lake Valley was first seriously discussed in the late 1980s to provide an alternative to traffic congestion on I-15, but the idea was met with criticism. On October 10, 1988, Congress approved $5 million in funds to preserve land along the proposed light rail corridor. Funding for the light rail line, however, remained uncertain. After Salt Lake City won the bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics in 1995, UTA used the city&#x27;s host status to accelerate obtaining funding through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Construction began in 1997. Protesters at the groundbreaking insisted light rail would be dangerous and a waste of money. Public opinion remained divided and businesses on Main Street in downtown Salt Lake City suffered during the construction period.

After the north–south line opened in late 1999 with sixteen stations, ridership expectations were quickly met. The system was enthusiastically embraced by valley residents, to the surprise of many, and once-skeptical communities soon began clamoring for extensions.

Funding for the University Line to Rice-Eccles Stadium allowed it to be completed in 2001 with four new stations, ahead of schedule and the Olympics. An extension to the University Medical Center that added three new stations was completed on September 29, 2003, fifteen months ahead of schedule. An infill station at 900 South in Salt Lake City was constructed in 2005, and a second infill station, at 9400 South in Sandy (Sandy Expo), opened in August 2006. On December 13, 2006, UTA&#x27;s board of trustees voted to change the name of the station next to the Delta Center to &quot;Arena&quot; in response to the renaming of the Delta Center to EnergySolutions Arena (which is once again known as the Delta Center.

On February 23, 2006, plans for extending the main line westward to the current Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub near the Gateway were approved. Two stations were built near the Gateway, as well as one at the Salt Lake Central Station (Salt Lake Intermodal Hub). They opened in April 2008, bringing the total number of stations to 28.

UTA has two service centers for TRAX maintenance: the Midvale Rail Service Center, which is just off the Red Line in Midvale, southwest of its junction with the Blue Line, and the Jordan River Service Center, which is just off the Green Line northeast of River Trail. The Jordan River building was originally an old warehouse for ZCMI, which had recently ceased operations and was renovated into a rail service center in 1999. The Midvale Center was similarly repurposed from a former warehouse around the time of the Red and Green lines opening in 2011, it was also built to handle UTA&#x27;s brand new Siemens S70 LRV&#x27;s. Utah Railway (under its subsidiary Salt Lake City Southern Railroad and with contracts from BNSF) and the Savage Bingham &amp; Garfield Railroad both operate freight service over TRAX tracks via trackage rights.

An additional infill station, 600 South Main Street in Salt Lake City, along all three lines, opened on July 26, 2022. The station was part of the initial plans for the system, but the demand was not at the level needed for a station until recently.

=== FrontLines 2015 ===
On September 21, 2006, a property tax hike proposal was replaced with a general transportation quarter-cent sales tax hike that was voted on and approved on November 7 of that year. On December 21, 2006, the Salt Lake County Council created a priority list for the sales tax, saying TRAX and commuter rail should take priority. A letter of intent signed with the Federal Transit Administration on September 24, 2007, secured the remaining $500 million in funding for the light rail lines. These funds were used to finance the FrontLines 2015 expansion project, which added four TRAX extensions by 2015 (as well as an expansion to &quot;FrontRunner&quot; commuter rail).

In order to support planned TRAX expansion, UTA ordered 77 Siemens S70 light rail vehicles from Siemens AG. It is the company&#x27;s largest light rail contract in the United States to date.

In 2008, construction began on two new extensions: one extension of through West Valley City (now part of the Green Line) and another extension of through the southwest portion of the Salt Lake Valley (now part of the Red Line). Both extensions were debuted in ceremonial openings on August 2, 2011, and permanently opened for regular service on August 7. Both extensions were completed ahead of schedule and under budget. Upon completion of these expansions UTA adopted a color-code line names in place of their old destination-based line names.

After the first year of operation, ridership on these portions of the Green and Red lines was less than was projected by UTA. However, UTA has stated the projected ridership was for the year 2015. Since these lines were opened for service years earlier than originally planned, the anticipated growth on the west side of Salt Lake Valley has just not happened, yet. UTA affirms that by 2015 ridership will meet the original projections.

A line from Salt Lake City International Airport to the University of Utah was in the original plans for the system to be completed before the 2002 Winter Olympics, but funding shortages only allowed the eastern portion to be constructed. The airport line eventually came to fruition, however, and ground was broken on October 22, 2008. The extension opened on April 14, 2013, adding and six additional stations to the Green Line, including a transfer station to the &quot;FrontRunner&quot;.

On November 14, 2006, the Draper City Council approved the TRAX extension into that city. Neighbors in the area have continually fought the route suggested by UTA. The route follows an old rail line and UTA already owned the right of way. An alternative route that would run down the middle of State Street was also studied by UTA. Use of the UTA right of way for the line was challenged in court and later approved by the Utah Supreme Court on July 12, 2008. UTA published a draft Environmental Impact Statement for the new line that names the UTA right of way as the preferred route. The extension&#x27;s first phase, which includes and three new stations, opened on August 18, 2013.

=== &quot;FrontRunner&quot; ===
When &quot;FrontRunner&quot; (UTA&#x27;s commuter rail train) started running on April 26, 2008, the only transfer station between the &quot;FrontRunner&quot; and TRAX was Salt Lake Central (Salt Lake Intermodal Hub), with the &quot;FrontRunner&quot; running north from that station to Ogden. However, with the opening of the &quot;FrontRunner&quot; South extension on December 10, 2012, with service south to Provo, Murray Central station was added as second transfer station which allowed for transfer to the Blue and Red lines. Although not part of the &quot;FrontRunner&quot; South extension, &quot;FrontRunner&quot; service at the new North Temple station also began on the same day. When the Airport extension of the Green Line opened for service on April 14, 2013, this station became the third transfer station between &quot;FrontRunner&quot; and TRAX at the North Temple Bridge/Guadalupe station. The &quot;FrontRunner&quot; portion of this station was built to provide a transfer station between &quot;FrontRunner&quot; and the Green Line, since the reroute of the Green Line for the Airport extension would have left the Green Line without any common station with &quot;FrontRunner&quot;.

=== S Line ===
For several years a TRAX spur into the Salt Lake City neighborhood of Sugar House had been contemplated. A series of community meetings were held in Sugar House as part of a larger transit study undertaken by UTA. Several transit alternatives were presented to the neighborhood, including bus rapid transit, light rail, and a streetcar. The streetcar seemed to be the preferred alternative. On October 20, 2010, the S Line (known then as Sugar House Streetcar) received a $26 million federal grant that allowed the street car to be completed in less than two years. It used an existing rail line running along 2200 South from the Central Pointe TRAX station to approximately 1100 East, near the primary Sugar House shopping district. The first phase of the S Line opened on December 8, 2013.


== Future expansion ==
In 2023, UTA published its Light Rail Strategic Plan, which highlighted plans by the agency to build new tracks along both 400 South and 400 West in Downtown Salt Lake City, connecting to the existing TRAX network at Ballpark to the south, Courthouse to the east, and either Salt Lake Central or Planetarium to the west. This expansion is also planned to include new stations at Pioneer Park and within the Granery District. Once completed, this infrastructure is planned to allow for:
* Creation of a new Orange Line service between Salt Lake City International Airport and the University of Utah via Pioneer Park.
* A re-routing of the existing Red Line between Ballpark and Courthouse stations through the Granery District.
* Swapping the northern termini of the Blue and Green Lines, such that the Blue Line runs from Draper to the Airport, and the Green Line from West Valley Central to Salt Lake Central.

Additionally, the Strategic Plan highlights expansion of the TRAX network to the University of Utah Research Park, splitting off from the current system at University South Campus station. This new service would be provided by the proposed Orange Line. UTA proposes that these expansions be completed prior to Salt Lake City&#x27;s hosting of the 2034 Winter Olympics.

UTA and the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) each independently commissioned a study, UTA first, then UDOT to look at potential transit solutions to the Point of the Mountain development at the former Utah State Prison complex. UTA determined BRT to be the prefferred transit alternative, but was overridden by UDOT, who determined that Light Rail would be a better transportation solution, with higher ridership projections and development potential, despite the higher cost. 

=== Other plans ===
In conjunction with the Mountain View Corridor project, plans were made by UTA to build a new TRAX line on the west side of the Salt Lake Valley along 5600 West (in the same general area as the Mountain View Corridor). The proposed line however hasn&#x27;t gone through any studies, and isn&#x27;t currently in UTA&#x27;s future planning documents anymore. Instead a new Enhanced Bus along 5600 West was chosen and is currently in development with an expected opening date in Spring 2028.

In 2015, UTA announced plans to eventually expand the Red Line south from Daybreak. Initial proposals would have the line travel south to Herriman before either turning eastbound and passing through Riverton before terminating in Draper, or continuing south through Herriman toward the Rosecrest neighborhood and Zions Bank Stadium. Planned corridor preservation indicates continued interest in possibly extending the red line in the future, though such extension plans are absent from any future planning documents. 

UTA has historically discussed proposals to extend the Blue Line from Draper to Lehi and eventually Orem, as well as creating a TRAX line to Davis County. However, both projects are currently being pursued as BRT lines, with the potential for conversion to light rail in the future if needed.

== Commercial advertising restrictions ==
UTA does not sell naming rights for its stations, nor does it allow stations to be named after commercial businesses. Commercial advertising on TRAX platforms is prohibited, in order for the passengers to be able to notice the safety information. One exception to this rule occurred during the 2002 Winter Olympics. For the duration of the games, the Arena and Temple Square stations were closed for security reasons, and during this time UTA allowed Coca-Cola to use the area of the unused Arena Station as part of its pin-trading center. The advertising restriction does not apply to the sides of the TRAX train cars or to UTA&#x27;s buses. Not only does UTA have advertising signs on the sides and rear of many of its buses, it also has many buses where the painting scheme of the full rear or even the entire bus is an advertisement (bus wrap).

<text>Leopold V (1157 – 31 December 1194), known as the Virtuous () was a member of the House of Babenberg who reigned as Duke of Austria from 1177 and Duke of Styria within the Holy Roman Empire from 1192 until his death. The Georgenberg Pact resulted in Leopold being enfeoffed with Styria by Roman-German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1193, which would lead to the eventual creation of modern Austria. Leopold was also known for his involvement in the Third Crusade where he fought in the Siege of Acre in 1191 and of his imprisonment of King Richard I in 1193 at Dürnstein Castle.

==Biography==
Leopold was the son of the Austrian duke Henry II Jasomirgott from his second marriage with the Byzantine princess Theodora, a daughter of Andronikos Komnenos, the second eldest son of Emperor John II Komnenos. Just before his birth, his father had achieved the elevation of the Austrian margraviate to a duchy according to the 1156 &quot;Privilegium Minus&quot;, issued by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. As the eldest son of Henry II, Leopold was already enfeoffed with the Austrian duchy by the emperor in the summer of 1174 at Regensburg.

He succeeded his father as Duke of Austria upon his death on 13 January 1177. Soon after, Leopold lent his support to Duke Frederick of Bohemia while the latter was stuck in a conflict with his Přemyslid cousin Soběslav II, who had campaigned in the Austrian duchy. In turn, Leopold reached a peace agreement with the neighbouring Duchy of Bohemia, determined by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa at Eger in 1179. Two years later, he attended an Imperial Diet in Erfurt, where his first-born son Frederick was enfeoffed with the Austrian estate. In 1182 Leopold went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and was received with honour at the courts of King Béla III of Hungary and of Emperor Alexios II Komnenos in Constantinople.

Back in Germany, he began negotiating on the Georgenberg Pact with the last Otakar duke of Styria, Ottokar IV, who had received the ducal title from Emperor Frederick in 1180. The agreement was concluded on 17 August 1186, whereafter Styria and the central part of Upper Austria with Wels and Steyr were amalgamated into the Duchy of Austria upon Ottokar&#x27;s death in 1192. The next year, Leopold was enfeoffed with Styria by the emperor; this was the first step towards the creation of modern Austria.

Leopold is mainly remembered outside Austria for his participation in the Third Crusade. Border disputes with King Béla III of Hungary had initially impeded the duke from accompanying Emperor Frederick on his departure in May 1189. When he heard about the emperor&#x27;s death in 1190, he went to Venice, where he embarked to the Holy Land. Autumn storms forced him to winter in Zadar on the Adriatic coast. He arrived in Palestine to take part in the final stage of the Siege of Acre in spring 1191. Leopold assumed command of the remnants of the Imperial forces after the death of the emperor&#x27;s son, Duke Frederick of Swabia, in January. According to legend, his tunic was blood-soaked after the fights. When he doffed his belt, a white stripe appeared. The new emperor Henry VI granted him the privilege of adopting these colours as his new banner, that later would become the flag of Austria.

Acre surrendered on July 12, after the arrival of King Philip II of France and King Richard I of England. Duke Leopold, as commander of the German contingent, demanded rights equal to those of the two kings but was rejected. When the banners of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, England, France and Leopold&#x27;s ducal flag were raised in the city by Leopold&#x27;s cousin, Marquis Conrad of Montferrat, Richard removed Leopold&#x27;s colours and the duke wrathfully left for his Austrian home, arriving by the end of 1191. In January 1192 he proceeded to the court of Emperor Henry VI and complained bitterly about Richard, who also was suspected of involvement in the murder of Conrad shortly after his election as King of Jerusalem in April the same year.

The emperor probably agreed with King Philip, already in conflict with the English king, on Richard&#x27;s capture. When King Richard left the Holy Land in late October 1192, he found the French ports closed and sailed up the Adriatic Sea. He took the country road from Aquileia and then across to Austria to reach the Bavarian estates of his Welf brother-in-law Henry the Lion. Whilst travelling under disguise, he stopped at Vienna shortly before Christmas 1192, where he was recognized (supposedly because of his signet ring) and arrested in Erdberg (modern Landstraße district). Initially Duke Leopold had the king imprisoned in Dürnstein, and in March 1193 Richard was brought before Emperor Henry VI at Trifels Castle, accused of Conrad&#x27;s murder. A ransom of 35,000 kilograms of silver was paid to release Richard. Leopold demanded that Richard&#x27;s niece, Eleanor, marry his son Frederick. Leopold&#x27;s share of the ransom became the foundation for the mint in Vienna, and was used to build new city walls for Vienna, as well as to found the towns of Wiener Neustadt and Friedberg in Styria. The duke was excommunicated by Pope Celestine III for having taken a fellow crusader prisoner.

To receive absolution, Leopold prepared for another crusade, but in 1194, his foot was crushed when his horse fell on him at a tournament in Graz. Though advised by his surgeons to have the foot amputated, no one admitted to being able to do it. He ordered his servants to chop his foot off with an axe, which they succeeded in doing after three swings. He succumbed to gangrene. As a result of deathbed promises to make restitution given to the hastily summoned Archbishop Adalbert of Salzburg, he was reconciled and received a Christian burial at Heiligenkreuz Abbey.

His son Frederick succeeded him as the new duke; due to his death, the marriage of Frederick and Eleanor never took place.

==Marriage and children==
At Pentecost 1174, Leopold married Helena (1158–1199), a daughter of late King Géza II of Hungary. By her, Leopold had at least two children:
* Frederick I ( – 1198), who succeeded his father as Duke of Austria
* Leopold VI (1176–1230), succeeded his father as Duke of Styria (inconsistent with the Georgenberg Pact) and became Duke of Austria upon his brother&#x27;s death in 1198.

<doc id="1100944" wikidata="Q235823" url="?curid=1100944" title="Princess Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma">
<text>Princess Maria Luisa of Bourbon-Parma (Marie Louise Pia Theresa Anna Ferdinanda Francisca Antoinette Margaret Josepha Carolina Blanche Lucia Apollonia; 17 January 1870 – 31 January 1899) was the eldest daughter of Robert I, the last reigning Duke of Parma. She became Princess of Bulgaria upon her marriage to Ferdinand I, the then prince-regnant (who became Tsar after the Bulgarian Declaration of Independence in 1908). She was the mother of Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria.

==Early life==
Marie Louise was born in Rome on 17 January 1870 as &quot;Maria Luisa Pia Teresa Anna Ferdinanda Francesca Antonietta Margherita Giuseppina Carolina Bianca Lucia Apollonia di Borbone-Parma&quot;, the eldest daughter of Robert I, Duke of Parma, and Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. The couple produced eleven more children before Maria Pia died in childbirth in 1882. Later, he remarried Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal and had twelve more children.

Marie Louise, who was 12 at the time of her mother&#x27;s death, was brought up in Biarritz and Switzerland under the care of English governesses. Fluent in five languages, she liked painting and music. Her talents playing the guitar and the piano were judged to be well above the average. She was also well read and knew a lot of Dante and Leopardi by heart.

==Marriage==
In 1892, her father arranged her marriage to the then reigning Prince of Bulgaria, Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The negotiations were conducted between Duke Robert and Ferdinand&#x27;s mother, Princess Clémentine of Orléans. The engagement was celebrated at the Castle of Schwartzau, the residence of the Bourbon-Parma family in Austria. Marie Louise and Ferdinand had never met prior to that day. Princess Clémentine, who was present on that occasion, described her future daughter-in-law in a letter to Queen Victoria as &quot;Unhappily not very pretty, it is the only thing which is lacking, since she is charming, good, very witty, intelligent and very likable&quot;. The wedding took place on 20 April 1893 at the Villa Pianore in Lucca, Italy, the residence of Duke Roberto in Italy. Marie Louise was 23 at the time, nine years younger than Ferdinand. The couple wasted no time producing an heir, with their son Boris born nine months and ten days after their wedding. 

==Family life==

It is thought that Marie Louise was not loved by her husband. However, he made sure that in order to secure his lineage on the Bulgarian throne, she would bear him children. Under pressure from his subjects and looking to be recognized as Bulgaria&#x27;s sovereign by the Russian emperor, Ferdinand wanted to have their eldest son, Boris, converted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church in the summer of 1895. Marie Louise, who was pregnant at the time, argued bitterly against her husband&#x27;s actions, with the support of her father and her mother-in-law.

Marie Louise and Ferdinand&#x27;s second child received baptism with Roman Catholic rites. However, unable to avoid Boris&#x27;s conversion, Marie Louise, who had threatened to leave the country, left Sofia that same day for Beaulieu. In May 1896, Marie Louise returned to Bulgaria. In the summer, she went to London with her husband for Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee, giving birth the following January to Princess Eudoxia. In July 1898, with her husband and their four-year-old, Boris, they visited St Petersburg at the invitation of Nicholas II of Russia.

==Death==
Disillusionment in her private life and bearing four children in five years affected her frail health. Suffering from pneumonia, Marie Louise died in Sofia, 24 hours after giving birth to her fourth child. Aged just 29, she was buried in the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St Louis of France in Plovdiv, Bulgaria.

<text>A khachkar (also spelled as khatchkar) or Armenian cross-stone (, , խաչ xačʿ &quot;cross&quot; + քար kʿar &quot;stone&quot;) is a carved, memorial stele bearing a cross, and often with additional motifs such as rosettes, interlaces, and botanical motifs. &quot;Khachkars&quot; are characteristic of medieval Christian Armenian art.

Since 2010, khachkars, their symbolism and craftsmanship are inscribed in the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage.

==Description==

The most common &quot;khachkar&quot; feature is a cross surmounting a rosette or a solar disc. The remainder of the stone face is typically filled with elaborate patterns of leaves, grapes, pomegranates, and bands of interlace. Occasionally a &quot;khachkar&quot; is surmounted by a cornice sometimes containing biblical or saintly figures.

Most early &quot;khachkars&quot; were erected for the salvation of the soul of either a living or a deceased person. Otherwise they were intended to commemorate a military victory, the construction of a church, or as a form of protection from natural disasters.

The most common location for early &quot;khachkars&quot; was in a graveyard. However, Armenian gravestones take many other forms, and only a minority are &quot;khachkars&quot;.

==History==
The first true &quot;khachkars&quot; appeared in the 9th century, during the time of Armenian revival after liberation from Arab rule. The oldest &quot;khachkar&quot; with a known date was carved in 879 (though earlier, cruder, examples exist). Erected in Garni, it is dedicated to queen Katranide I, the wife of king Ashot I Bagratuni. The peak of the khachkar carving art was between the 12th and the 14th centuries. The art declined during the Mongol invasion at the end of the 14th century. It revived in the 16th and 17th centuries, but the artistic heights of the 14th century were never achieved again. Today, the tradition still remains, and one can still see khachkar carvers in some parts of Yerevan.

About 40,000 khachkars survive today. Most of them are free standing, though those recording donations are usually built into monastery walls. The following three khachkars are believed to be the finest examples of the art form:
*One in Geghard, carved in 1213, probably by master &quot;Timot&quot; and master &quot;Mkhitar&quot;
*The Holy Redeemer khachkar in Haghpat (see gallery), carved in 1273 by master &quot;Vahram&quot;
*A khachkar in Goshavank, carved in 1291 by master &quot;Poghos&quot;.

A number of good examples have been transferred to the Historical Museum in Yerevan and beside the cathedral in Echmiadzin. The largest surviving collection of khachkars is in Armenia, at Noraduz cemetery on the western shore of the Lake Sevan, where an old graveyard with around 900 khachkars from various periods and of various styles can be seen. The largest number was formerly located at the Armenian cemetery in Julfa in the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan, which contained approximately 10,000 khachkars in 1648. The number of khachkars dwindled over time through destruction of various causes until the only 2,700 khachkars remained in 1998, when the Azerbaijani government embarked on a systematic campaign destroying and leveling the entire medieval cemetery between 1998 and 2005.

==Present==

The art of carving khachkars has witnessed a rebirth as a symbol of Armenian culture in the 20th century. 

There are hundreds of khachkars worldwide, many of which are memorials to commemorate the victims of the Armenian genocide. Khachkars have been placed in various locations, including at the Vatican Museums, Canterbury Cathedral&#x27;s memorial garden, St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney, Colorado State Capitol, Temple of Peace, Cardiff, Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, and elsewhere. 

According to one count, there are nearly 30 khachkars on public locations in France. Some 20 khachkars are located in Poland, which is home to an important Armenian community since the Late Middle Ages.

Armenian khachkars have been acquired or donated to many museums or temporarily represented at significant exhibitions all around the world such as at the British Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Special Exhibition of the National Museum of Ethnology, Osaka, Japan.

==Endangered khachkars==
A large portion of khachkars, which were created in historic Armenia and surrounding regions, in modern times are now located in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Iran. As a result of systematic eradication of khachkars in Turkey since the Armenian Genocide, today only a few examples survive. These few survivors are not cataloged and properly photographed. Thus, it is difficult to follow up with the current situation. One documented example of such destruction took place in the Armenian Cemetery in Jugha, in Nakhchivan. The government of Azerbaijan has denied claims that members of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces smashed the khachkars with sledgehammers in December 2005. The destruction of khachkars was despite a 2000 UNESCO order demanding their protection, in what has been termed &quot;the worst cultural genocide of the 21st century.&quot;

One source says that khachkars are being damaged, neglected, or moved in Armenia. Reasons cited for moving these khachkars include; decoration, to create new holy places, or to make space for new burials.

== Types ==
Amenaprkich (, meaning &quot;Holy Saviour&quot;) is a particular type of khachkar in which on the cross is a depiction of the crucified Christ. Only a few such designs are known, and most date from the late 13th century. One of the few such surviving khachkars today is located in the Sevanavank monastery, which also depicts scenes from the Bible.

<text>The term Australian megafauna refers to the megafauna in Australia during the Pleistocene Epoch. Most of these species became extinct during the latter half of the Pleistocene, and the roles of human and climatic factors in their extinction are contested.

There are similarities between the prehistoric Australian megafauna and some mythical creatures from the Aboriginal Dreamtime.

==Causes of extinction==
Many modern researchers, including Tim Flannery, think that with the arrival of early Aboriginal Australians (around 70,000~65,000 years ago), hunting and the use of fire to manage their environment may have contributed to the extinction of the megafauna. Increased aridity during peak glaciation (about 18,000 years ago) may have also contributed, but most of the megafauna were already extinct by this time. Others, including Steve Wroe, note that records in the Australian Pleistocene are rare, and there is not enough data to definitively determine the time of extinction of many of the species, with many of the species having no confirmed record within the last 100,000 years. They suggest that many of the extinctions had been staggered over the course of the late Middle Pleistocene and early Late Pleistocene, prior to human arrival, due to climatic stress.

New evidence based on accurate optically stimulated luminescence and uranium-thorium dating of megafaunal remains suggests that humans were the ultimate cause of the extinction for some of the megafauna in Australia. The dates derived show that all forms of megafauna on the Australian mainland became extinct in the same rapid timeframe—approximately 46,000 years ago—the period when the earliest humans first arrived in Australia (around 70,000~65,000 years ago long chronology and 50,000 years ago short chronology). However, these results were subsequently disputed, with another study showing that 50 of 88 megafaunal species have no dates postdating the penultimate glacial maximum around 130,000 years ago, and there was only firm evidence for overlap of 8-14 megafaunal species with people. Analysis of oxygen and carbon isotopes from teeth of megafauna indicate the regional climates at the time of extinction were similar to arid regional climates of today and that the megafauna were well adapted to arid climates. The dates derived have been interpreted as suggesting that the main mechanism for extinction was human burning of a landscape that was then much less fire-adapted; oxygen and carbon isotopes of teeth indicate sudden, drastic, non-climate-related changes in vegetation and in the diet of surviving marsupial species. However, early Aboriginal peoples appear to have rapidly eliminated the megafauna of Tasmania about 41,000 years ago (following formation of a land bridge to Australia about 43,000 years ago as Ice Age sea levels declined) without using fire to modify the environment there, implying that at least in this case hunting was the most important factor. It has also been suggested that the vegetational changes that occurred on the mainland were a consequence, rather than a cause, of the elimination of the megafauna. This idea is supported by sediment cores from Lynch&#x27;s Crater in Queensland, which suggest that fire increased in the local ecosystem about a century after the disappearance of &quot;Sporormiella (&quot;a fungus found in herbivorous animal dung used as a megafaunal proxy), leading to a subsequent transition to fire-tolerant sclerophyll vegetation. However, the use of &quot;Sporormiella&quot; as a megafaunal proxy has been criticised, noting that &quot;Sporormiella&quot; is found sporadically in the dung of various herbivorous species, including extant emus and kangaroos, not just megafauna, that its presence depends on a variety of factors, often unrelated to megafaunal abundance, and that in Cuddie Springs, a well known megafaunal site, the densities of &quot;Sporormiella&quot; were consistently low. A study of extinct megafauna at the Walker Creek site in Queensland, found that their disappearance from the site after 40 kya came after an extended period of environmental deterioration.

Chemical analysis of fragments of eggshells of &quot;Genyornis newtoni&quot;, a flightless bird that became extinct in Australia, from over 200 sites, revealed scorch marks consistent with cooking in human-made fires, presumably the first direct evidence of human contribution to the extinction of a species of the Australian megafauna. This was later contested by another study that noted the too small dimensions (126 x 97 mm, roughly like the emu eggs, while the moa eggs were about 240 mm) for the &quot;Genyornis&quot; supposed eggs, and rather, attributed them to another extinct, but much smaller bird, the megapode &quot;Progura&quot;. The real time that saw &quot;Genyornis&quot; vanish is still an open question, but this was believed as one of the best documented megafauna extinctions in Australia.

&quot;Imperceptive overkill&quot;, a scenario where anthropogenic pressures take place, slowly and gradually wiping the megafauna out, has been suggested.

On the other hand, there is also evidence to suggest that (contrary to other conclusions) the megafauna lived alongside humans for several thousand years. The question of if (and how) the megafauna died before the arrival of humans is still debated; with some authors maintaining that only a minority of such fauna remained by the time the first humans settled on the mainland. One of the most important advocates of human role, Tim Flannery, author of the book &quot;Future Eaters&quot;, was also heavily criticised for his conclusions. A surprisingly late date of 33-37 kya is known for a &quot;Zygomaturus&quot; specimen from the Willandra Lakes Region in New South Wales, the latest known date for any Australian Megafauna. This is well after aboriginal arrival in Australia around 50 kya.

A 2021 study found that the rate of extinction of Australia&#x27;s megafauna is rather unusual, with some more generalistic species having gone extinct earlier while highly specialised ones having become extinct later or even still surviving today. A mosaic cause of extinction with different anthropogenic and environmental pressures was proposed.

== Living Australian megafauna ==
The term &quot;megafauna&quot; is usually applied to large animals (over ). In Australia, however, megafauna were never as large as those found on other continents, and so a more lenient criterion of over is often applied.
=== Marsupials ===
* The red kangaroo (&quot;Osphranter rufus&quot;) grows up to tall and weighs up to 85 kg (187 lb). Females grow up to tall and weigh up to 35 kg (77 lb). Tails on both males and females can be up to long.
* The eastern grey kangaroos (&quot;Macropus giganteus&quot;). Although a male typically weighs around 66 kg (145 lb) and stand almost tall, the scientific name &quot;Macropus giganteus&quot; (gigantic large-foot) is misleading, as the red kangaroo living in the semi-arid inland is larger.
* The antilopine kangaroo (&quot;Osphranter antilopinus&quot;), sometimes called the antilopine wallaroo or the antilopine wallaby, is a species of macropod found in northern Australia at Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, the Top End of the Northern Territory, and the Kimberley region of Western Australia. They can weigh as much as and grow over long.
*Common wombats (&quot;Vombatus ursinus&quot;) can reach . They thrive in Eastern Australia and Tasmania, preferring temperate forests and highland regions.

=== Birds ===
* The emu (&quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae&quot;)
* The southern cassowary (&quot;Casuarius casuarius&quot;)

=== Reptiles ===
* Goannas, being predatory lizards, are often quite large or bulky, with sharp teeth and claws. The largest extant goanna is the perentie (&quot;Varanus giganteus&quot;), which can grow over in length. However, not all goannas are gargantuan: pygmy goannas may be smaller than a man&#x27;s arm. 
* A healthy adult male saltwater crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus porosus&quot;) is typically long and weighs around ), with many being much larger than that. The female is much smaller, with typical body lengths of . An saltwater crocodile was reportedly shot on the Norman River of Queensland in 1957; a cast was made of it and is on display as a popular tourist attraction. However, due to the lack of solid evidence (other than the plaster replica), and the length of time since the crocodile was caught, it is not considered &quot;official&quot;.
* The freshwater crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus johnstoni&quot;) is a relatively small crocodilian. Males can grow to in length, while females reach a maximum length of . Males commonly weigh around , with large specimens up to or more, as against the average female weight of . In places such as Lake Argyle and Nitmiluk National Park (Katherine Gorge), there exist a handful of confirmed individuals.

== Extinct Australian megafauna ==

The following is an incomplete list of extinct Australian megafauna (monotremes, marsupials, birds and reptiles) in the format:

* &quot;Latin name&quot;, (common name, period alive), and a brief description.

=== Monotremes ===
Monotremes are arranged by size with the largest at the top.

* &quot;Murrayglossus hacketti&quot; was a sheep-sized echidna uncovered in Mammoth Cave in Western Australia, and is the largest monotreme so far uncovered.
* &quot;Obdurodon dicksoni&quot; was a platypus up to in total length, fossils of which were found at Riversleigh.
* &quot;Megalibgwilia ramsayi&quot; was a large, long-beaked echidna with powerful forelimbs for digging.

=== Marsupials ===
Marsupials are arranged by size, with the largest at the top.

* &quot;Diprotodon optatum&quot; is not only the largest known species of diprotodontid, but also the largest known marsupial to ever exist. Approximately long and high at the shoulder and weighing up to , it resembled a giant wombat. It is the only marsupial known, living or extinct, to have conducted seasonal migrations.
* &quot;Palorchestes azael&quot; was a diprotodontoid similar in size to &quot;Zygomaturus&quot;. It had long claws to grasp branches with. It lived during the Pleistocene.
* &quot;Euowenia grata&quot;
* &quot;Euryzygoma dunense&quot;
* &quot;Zygomaturus trilobus&quot; was a smaller (bullock-sized, about long by high) diprotodontid that may have had a short trunk. It appears to have lived in wetlands, using two fork-like incisors to shovel up reeds and sedges for food.
* &quot;Macropus pearsoni&quot; and &quot;M. ferragus&quot;
* &quot;Mukupirna nambensis&quot;, in its own family Mukupirnidae within the Vombatiformes suborder of the large marsupial order Diprotodontia
* &quot;Nototherium&quot; was a diprotodontoid relative of the larger &quot;Diprotodon&quot;.
* &quot;Phascolonus gigas&quot;
* &quot;Procoptodon goliah&quot; (the giant short-faced kangaroo) is the largest-known kangaroo to have ever lived. It grew 2–3 metres (7–10 feet) tall, and weighed up to .
* &quot;Procoptodon rapha&quot;, &quot;P. pusio&quot; and &quot;P. texasensis&quot;
* &quot;Protemnodon&quot;, a genus of wallaby with four known giant species out of 11 known species
* &quot;Palorchestes parvus&quot;
* &quot;Ramsayia magna&quot;
* &quot;Sthenurus tindalei&quot; and &quot;S. atlas&quot;
* &quot;Thylacoleo carnifex&quot; (the marsupial lion) is the largest known carnivorous mammal to have ever lived in prehistoric Australia, and was of comparable size to female placental mammal lions and tigers, It had a catlike skull with large slicing pre-molars, a retractable thumb-claw and massive forelimbs. It was almost certainly carnivorous and a tree-dweller.

* &quot;Simosthenurus pales&quot;
* &quot;Phascolarctos stirtoni&quot; (the giant koala) was similar in structure to the modern koala (&quot;P. cinereus&quot;), but one-third larger.
* &quot;Phascolomys medius&quot;
* &quot;Lasiorhinus angustidens&quot;
* &quot;Thylacinus cynocephalus&quot; (the thylacine, Tasmanian wolf or Tasmanian tiger), which notably survived into recent history (the last known individual died in 1936).
* &quot;Congruus congruus&quot;, a wallaby from Naracoorte
* &quot;Troposodon minor&quot;
* &quot;Sthenurus oreas&quot;
* &quot;Simosthenurus occidentalis&quot; (another sthenurine) was about as tall as a modern eastern grey kangaroo, but much more robust. It is one of the nine known species of leaf-eating kangaroos identified in fossils found in Naracoorte Caves National Park.
* &quot;Simothenurus brownei&quot;
* &quot;Propleopus oscillans&quot; (the giant rat-kangaroo) was a large (about rat-kangaroo with large shearing and stout grinding teeth that indicate it may have been an opportunistic omnivore able to eat invertebrates, vertebrates (possibly carrion), fruits, and soft leaves. Grew to about in height.

* Family Dromornithidae: this group of birds was more closely related to modern fowl than to modern ratites.
** &quot;Dromornis stirtoni&quot;, (Stirton&#x27;s thunder bird) was a flightless bird tall that weighed about . It is one of the largest birds so far discovered. It inhabited subtropical open woodlands and was probably herbivorous with some omnivory. It was heavier than the moa and taller than the elephant birds.
** &quot;Dromornis (formerly Bullockornis) planei&quot; (the &quot;demon duck of doom&quot;) was another huge member of the Dromornithidae. It was up to tall and weighed up to ; it was probably herbivorous with some omnivory.
** &quot;Genyornis newtoni&quot; (the mihirung) was related to &quot;Dromornis&quot;, and was about the height of an ostrich. It was the last survivor of the Dromornithidae. It had a large lower jaw and was probably herbivorous with some omnivory.
* &quot;Progura gallinacea&quot; (the giant malleefowl) was a larger relative of the extant malleefowl (&quot;Leipoa ocellata&quot;).
* &quot;Cryptogyps lacertosus&quot;
* &quot;Dynatoaetus gaffae&quot;, largest bird of prey of Australia, second only to the Haast&#x27;s eagle of New Zealand

=== Reptiles ===

* &quot;Varanus priscus&quot; (formerly &quot;Megalania prisca&quot;) (the megalania) was a giant carnivorous goanna that might have grown to as long as , and weighed up to . Giant goannas and humans overlapped in time in Pleistocene Australia, but there is no evidence that they directly encountered each other.
* &quot;Wonambi naracoortensis&quot; was a non-venomous snake of in length. It was an ambush predator living at waterholes located in natural sun traps and killed its prey by constriction.
* &quot;Quinkana&quot; was a semi-terrestrial crocodile that normally grew around in length. Its blade-like teeth for cutting suggests its terrestrial ecology. It belonged to the mekosuchine subfamily (all now extinct). It was discovered at the Bluff Downs in Queensland.
* &quot;Liasis dubudingala&quot;, lived during the Pliocene epoch, grew up to long, and is the largest Australian snake known. It hunted mammals, birds and reptiles in riparian woodlands. It is most similar to the extant olive python (&quot;Liasis olivacea&quot;).
*&quot;Meiolania&quot; was a genus of huge terrestrial stem-turtle (Meiolaniidae) measuring in length, with horned heads and spiked tails.

== Extinct megafauna contemporaneous with Aboriginal Australians ==

Monsters and large animals in Dreamtime stories have been associated with extinct megafauna.
The association was made at least as early as 1845, with colonists writing that Aboriginal people identified &quot;Diprotodon&quot; bones as belonging to bunyips, and Thomas Worsnop concluding that the fear of bunyip attacks at watering holes remembered a time when &quot;Diprotodon&quot; lived in marshes.

In the early 1900s, John Walter Gregory outlined the Kadimakara (or Kuddimurka or Kadimerkera) story of the Diyari (similar stories being told by nearby peoples), which describes the deserts of Central Australia as having once been &quot;fertile, well-watered plains&quot; with giant gum trees, and almost solid cloud cover overhead. The trees created a roof of vegetation in which lived the strange monsters called Kadimakara—which sometimes came to the ground to eat. One time, the gum trees were destroyed, forcing the Kadimakara to remain on the ground, particularly Lake Eyre and Kalamurina, until they died.

In times of drought and flood, the Diyari performed corroborees (including dances and blood sacrifices) at the bones of the Kadimakara to appease them and request that they intercede with the spirits of rain and clouds. Sites of Kadimakara bones identified by Aboriginal people corresponded with megafauna fossil sites, and an Aboriginal guide identified a &quot;Diprotodon&quot; jaw as belonging to the Kadimakara.

Gregory speculated that the story could be a remnant from when the Diyari lived elsewhere, or when the geographical conditions of Central Australia were different. The latter possibility would indicate Aboriginal coexistence with megafauna, with Gregory saying:
After examining fossils, Gregory concluded that the story was a combination of the two factors, but that the environment of Lake Eyre had probably not changed much since Aboriginal habitation. He concluded that while some references to Kadimakara were probably memories of the crocodiles once found in Lake Eyre, others that describe a &quot;big, heavy land animal, with a single horn on its forehead&quot; were probably references to &quot;Diprotodon&quot;.

Geologist Michael Welland describes from across Australia Dreamtime &quot;tales of giant creatures that roamed the lush landscape until aridity came and they finally perished in the desiccated marshes of Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre&quot;, giving as examples the Kadimakara of Lake Eye, as well as continent-wide stories of the Rainbow Serpent, which he says corresponds with &quot;Wonambi naracoortensis&quot;.

Journalist Peter Hancock speculates in &quot;The Crocodile That Wasn&#x27;t&quot; that a Dreamtime story from the Perth area could be a memory of &quot;Varanus priscus&quot;. However, the story in question details dingoes attacking or frightening off the alleged &quot;V. priscus&quot;, when the giant lizard died out nearly 46,000 years before the accepted arrival date of dingoes.

Rock art in the Kimberley region appears to depict a marsupial lion and a marsupial tapir, as does Arnhem land art. Arnhem art also appears to depict &quot;Genyornis&quot;, a bird that is believed to have gone extinct 40,000 years ago.

An Early Triassic archosauromorph found in Queensland, &quot;Kadimakara australiensis&quot;, is named after the Kadimakara.

<text>Fernando Vallejo Rendón (born 1942 in Medellín, Colombia) is a Colombian-born novelist, filmmaker and essayist. He obtained Mexican nationality in 2007.

==Biography==

Vallejo was born and raised in Medellín, though he left his hometown early in life. He started studies in Philosophy at Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Bogotá, but after one year he abandoned the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. Soon after he began new studies on biology at the Universidad Javeriana in Bogotá, which he finished. Then he spent one year in Italy at the film academy Cinecittà, where he obtained basic notions on cinema.

Vallejo then returned to Colombia with the project of filmmaking. Yet after difficulties with the Colombian Government in producing and, after he produced it, in presenting his first film (it was censored), he decided to leave his country.

In Mexico he produced and distributed three films about the violence in Colombia. He also wrote an award-winning children&#x27;s theater script, &quot;El reino misterioso o Tomás y las abejas.&quot; He has been living in Mexico since 1971, where he not only produced his cinematographic pieces, but also the whole of his literary work. Despite time spent in other locales, mainly Europe and the United States, most of his novels take place in Colombia. Some of his themes are grammar, biology, philosophy, physics, violence, pederasty, adolescence, drugs, death and politics, mostly related to places such as Antioquia and Medellín; yet his main theme is his life. His books are written in first person, in an autobiographical style, although he manipulates the conventions of autobiography such that the line between autobiography and fiction becomes significantly blurred.

His best-known novel, &quot;La virgen de los sicarios&quot;, has been translated into English as &quot;Our Lady of the Assassins&quot;. It deals with his fictionalized return to Medellín, and his relationships with two teenagers caught in the local cycle of violence. The autobiographical/fiction &quot;La virgen de los sicarios&quot; was made into a full feature film in 2000 and released in the United States as &quot;Our Lady of the Assassins&quot;.

In 2003, Colombian filmmaker Luis Ospina made a feature-length documentary about him: &quot;La desazón suprema: retrato incesante de Fernando Vallejo (&quot;The Supreme Uneasiness: Incessant Portrait of Fernando Vallejo&quot;).

In April 2007, Vallejo obtained Mexican citizenship and published a letter in which he publicly renounced his Colombian nationality. The letter presents the reasons for his decision by mentioning several incidents during his career, among them the recent reelection of President Álvaro Uribe, that eventually led him to this decision.

Vallejo is openly gay and lives with his partner, scenographist David Antón. He is known as an animal rights defender and vegan, and because of his antinatalist views, he has no children. He is an atheist and fiercely critical of religion.

<doc id="1100975" wikidata="Q1064170" url="?curid=1100975" title="Faux Cyrillic">
<text>Faux Cyrillic, pseudo-Cyrillic, pseudo-Russian or faux Russian typography is the use of Cyrillic letters in Latin text, usually to evoke the Soviet Union or Russia, though it may be used in other contexts as well. It is a common Western trope used in book covers, film titles, comic book lettering, artwork for computer games, or product packaging which are set in or wish to evoke Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, or Russia. A typeface designed to emulate Cyrillic is classed as a mimicry typeface. 

Letters are substituted regardless of phonetic matching. For example, &quot;R&quot; and &quot;N&quot; in &quot;RUSSIAN&quot; may be replaced with Cyrillic Я (&quot;ya&quot;) and И (&quot;i&quot;) to form the faux-cyrillic &quot;ЯUSSIAИ&quot; (yaussiai). Other examples include the use of Ш for W, Ц for U, Я/Г for R/backwards and upside-down L, Ф for O, Д for A, Б, Ь, or Ъ for B/b, З, Э, or Ё for E, Ч or У for Y. Outside the Russian alphabet, Џ (from Serbian) can act as a substitute for U, Ғ (from Turkic languages) for F, Ә (from Turkic languages, Abkhaz, Dungan, Itelmen, Kalmyk and Kurdish) or Є (from Ukrainian) for E, Ө (from Turkic, Mongolic and Uralic languages) for O, Һ (from Turkic and Mongolic languages and Kildin Sámi) for H, and Ћ (Serbian) for Th. A reversed ☭ (written as ☭) is also sometimes used for G. A common substitution is $ for S. Further variants include an inverted or rotated K (ꓘ), which is not used in any alphabet except Fraser.

This effect is usually restricted to text set in all caps, because Cyrillic letter-forms do not match well with lower case Latin letters. In Cyrillic typography, most upright lower case letters resemble smaller upper case letters, unlike the more distinctive forms of Latin-alphabet type. Cursive Cyrillic upper and lower case letters are more differentiated. Most Cyrillic letter-forms were derived from the Greek alphabet in the 9th century, but the modern forms have more closely resembled those in the Latin alphabet since Peter the Great&#x27;s civil script reform of 1708.

Many versions of Tetris, including those by Atari/Tengen and Spectrum Holobyte, used faux Cyrillic to spell the name as TETЯIS (&quot;tetyais&quot;) to emphasize the game&#x27;s Russian origins. The mockumentary film &quot;Borat&quot; used faux Cyrillic to stylize its title as BORДT (&quot;Bordt&quot;, in Russian the name would be spelt БОРАТ). Another example is American ammunition manufacturer Red Army Standard Ammunition, which is stylized as &quot;RЭD АRMY STAИDARD&quot; (&quot;Rzd army staidard)&quot;.

==Characters==
The letters А, В, Е, Ѕ*, І*, Ј*, К, М, Н, О, Р, С, Т, Ү*, У, Ғ*, Ѵ*, and Х (*used in other Cyrillic alphabets or from Church Slavonic) are strongly homoglyphic or related to Latin letters, depending on intended sound values to the point that their substitution may not be noticed, unlike those listed above.

<doc id="1100994" wikidata="Q1800949" url="?curid=1100994" title="Lake Hauroko">
<text>Lake Hauroko is the deepest lake in New Zealand. The lake, which is 462 metres deep, is located in a mountain valley in Fiordland National Park.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Hauroko&quot; translates from te reo Māori as &quot; of the wind&quot; or &quot;sounding wind&quot;. Prior to 1930, the lake was also called &quot;Lake Hauroto&quot;.

== Geography ==
Lake Hauroko is deep; sources range from calling it the 16th deepest lake in the world to the 23rd deepest. The S-shaped lake is long and has a surface area of . The lake surface is about above sea level. 

One of the country&#x27;s southernmost lakes, it is only 13 km from the southern coast of the South Island. It sits between the similarly-sized lakes Monowai and Poteriteri. According to the 1925 New Zealand Official Yearbook, it drains about /sec via the -long Wairaurāhiri River into Foveaux Strait 10 kilometres to the west of Te Waewae Bay.

The largest island in Lake Hauroko is Mary Island, named in 1883 after the wife of the government surveyor John Hay. A smaller island is adjacent to Teal Bay at the southern end of the lake. There are also a few other smaller islets and rocks in the lake.

== Geology ==
Traditionally, Ngā Puna Wai Karikari o Rakaihautu say the lake was dug by rangatira Rākaihautū on his journey south with his ko. The lake is a Statutory Acknowledgement site under the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.

Geologists say it&#x27;s a glacial lake, formed near the Hauroko Fault (it and other faults in the area have slipped several kilometres) in early carboniferous granites and metamorphic rocks, on the higher ground, with much more recent Hauroko Formation Eocene - Oligocene sediments such as calcareous sandstone, on the lower ground, towards the southeast.

Hauroko granite is about 358 million years old, medium grained, white, granodiorite and granite, with red-brown biotite. It has intruded dikes, plugs and xenoliths into metasediment. Albert Edward Granite is coarser, with pink K-feldspar megacrysts and green-brown biotite. There are also small amounts of carboniferous diorite. Towards the northwest of the lake, the area between the Hauroko Burn and the Hay River has dioritic, felsic dykes.

== Access ==
A road from Clifden to the lake was built in about 1909 and improved in the 1960s. A water taxi runs to the Dusky Track, which starts at the north end of the lake and leads to Lake Manapouri.

== Burial on Mary Island ==
Mary Island is the subject of several local myths, including one that the island is subject to a Māori curse. Such stories are dismissed by local Māori. The island is famous for the discovery of a burial site of a Māori woman in 1967, who is known as &quot;the lady of the lake&quot; by Southland locals. The burial site is in a cave on the eastern side of the island. Believed to have been placed on the burial site sometime between the late 16th century and 17th century, possibly around 1660, the woman was laid to rest wearing a flax cloak and a dog skin collar with weka feather edging around her neck, and was seated upright on a bier made of sticks and leaves. The reasons for the burial in this manner are uncertain, although it has been suggested that these burials were to either make sure the remains were protected from desecration by enemies, or to protect living descendants from a dangerous &quot;tapu&quot; (sacred, forbidden or taboo) that Māori may have believed the ancestral bones possessed. This led to the belief that this woman was of high-ranking status, and it was later discovered through an archaeological investigation that she was a chieftain of the Ngāti Moimoi tribe. The burial remains on the island today, with a grille made of steel and wire mesh ensuring that people can still view the burial, but the woman will remain untouched.

== Natural history ==
Trees are mainly mataī, tōtara, rimu, tawhai pango, tawhai, &quot;Pseudopanax linearis&quot; and rautawhiri (&quot;Pittosporum Colensoi&quot;).

The lake is one of the few not yet colonised by invasive water weeds, except the bulbous rush, &quot;Juncus bulbosus,&quot; so it retains plants such as &quot;Nitella stuartii&quot; algae, &quot;Callitriche petriei&quot; water-starwort, &quot;Isoetes kirkii&quot; quillwort, &quot;Pilularia novaezelandiae&quot; pillwort fern&quot;,&quot; &quot;Trithuria inconspicua&quot; waterlilies and &quot;Charales fibrosa.&quot;

Pests include stoats and possums, which arrived in the 1990s. They are controlled by trapping, bait stations and periodic 1080 drops.

<doc id="1100996" wikidata="Q707489" url="?curid=1100996" title="Internal pudendal artery">
<text>The internal pudendal artery is one of the three pudendal arteries. It branches off the internal iliac artery, and provides blood to the external genitalia.

== Structure ==
The internal pudendal artery is the terminal branch of the anterior trunk of the internal iliac artery. It is smaller in the female than in the male.

===Path===
It arises from the anterior division of internal iliac artery. It runs on the lateral pelvic wall. It exits the pelvic cavity through the greater sciatic foramen, inferior to the piriformis muscle, to enter the gluteal region.

It then curves around the sacrospinous ligament to enter the perineum through the lesser sciatic foramen.

It travels through the pudendal canal with the internal pudendal veins and the pudendal nerve.

===Branches===
The internal pudendal artery gives off the following branches:


The deep artery of clitoris is a branch of the internal pudendal artery and supplies the clitoral crura. Another branch of the internal pudendal artery is the dorsal artery of clitoris.

Some sources consider the urethral artery a direct branch of the internal pudendal artery, while others consider it a branch of the perineal artery.

In males, the internal pudendal artery also gives rise to the perforating arteries of the penis.

=== Variation ===
Around 70% of men have an accessory internal pudendal artery. This usually does not originate from the internal iliac artery, instead originating from the external iliac artery, the obturator artery, or the vesical arteries.

== Function ==
The internal pudendal artery supplies blood to the external genitalia.

== Clinical significance ==
In women, the internal pudendal artery may be damaged during childbirth. This may cause a haematoma, which usually resolves without treatment, but may form an infected abscess.

<text>William Manhire (born 27 December 1946) is a New Zealand poet, short story writer, emeritus professor, and New Zealand&#x27;s inaugural Poet Laureate (1997–1998). He founded New Zealand&#x27;s first creative writing course at Victoria University of Wellington in 1975, founded the International Institute of Modern Letters in 2001, and has been a strong promoter of New Zealand literature and poetry throughout his career. Many of New Zealand&#x27;s leading writers graduated from his courses at Victoria. He has received many notable awards including a Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Literary Achievement in 2007 and an Arts Foundation Icon Award in 2018.

The &quot;Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature&quot; (2006) states that he is &quot;recognised as among the two or three finest New Zealand poets of his generation&quot;, and literary critic Peter Simpson has observed that Manhire has &quot;probably done more to widen the audience for poetry in New Zealand than any other individual&quot;.

==Early life==
Manhire was born in Invercargill. His mother was from Scotland with a degree in science, and his father was a publican; they had met and married during World War II, and his mother sailed to New Zealand on a ship of war brides on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1946. In his memoir &quot;Under the Influence&quot; (2003), he described growing up in different small town South Island pubs. He attended Otago Boys&#x27; High School, and later the University of Otago in Dunedin where he received his B.A. in 1967, his M.A. (with honours) in 1968, and his M.Litt. in 1970. He went on to study Norse sagas at University College London (1970–73, M.Phil.).

As a young writer, Manhire sent some poetry to Charles Brasch; of this work, Manhire later said, &quot;I can&#x27;t remember the exact contents, but I think they had lines like &#x27;I stalk the streets of the midnight city&#x27; and were full of soiled sheets and neon and terrible things like that&quot;. He said he was &quot;enormously encouraged&quot; by Brasch&#x27;s response, which encouraged him to keep trying and to take himself seriously as a writer. Other writers Manhire met in Dunedin included Iain Lonie, Trevor Reeves and James K. Baxter.

==Career==
In the 1960s, while still an undergraduate at the University of Otago, Manhire had his first poems published in New Zealand journals, including notably the journal &quot;Landfall&quot;, then edited by Robin Dudding. While studying in London in the early 1970s he had poems published in British magazines. His first book was a poem, &quot;Malady&quot;, published in 1970. It consisted of just four words (&quot;malady&quot;, &quot;melody&quot; and &quot;my lady&quot;) arranged in patterns on the page, accompanied by drawings by artist Ralph Hotere, who had met Manhire in Dunedin while he was the Frances Hodgkins Fellow. Manhire&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Elaboration&quot; (1972), was also a collaboration with Hotere, and was published by Charles Brasch and Janet Paul. Around this time, and while living in London, Manhire and fellow poet Kevin Cunningham set up the Amphedesma Press to publish their own and their friends&#x27; work, including poetry books by Ian Wedde and Bob Orr.
In 1973, after returning to New Zealand, Manhire began lecturing in the English department of Victoria University of Wellington, where he founded New Zealand&#x27;s first creative writing course in 1975. His creative writing course, which he taught for more than 25 years, had a major influence on New Zealand literature, with many well-known New Zealand writers having graduated, including Elizabeth Knox, Barbara Anderson and Jenny Bornholdt. &quot;Mutes &amp; Earthquakes&quot; (1997) was an anthology of works by his former students; the introduction by Manhire begins with two pieces of advice: &quot;1. Write what you know, and / 2. Write what you don&#x27;t know&quot;. From 2001 to 2013 he was the inaugural and founding director of the International Institute of Modern Letters, which offers an MA and Ph.D. in creative writing, as well as a range of specialised undergraduate workshops. Students of the Institute have included Eleanor Catton, Catherine Chidgey and Hinemoana Baker. In 2016 the institute&#x27;s building was named the Bill Manhire House in recognition of his contribution to the university and to New Zealand literature. His successor Damien Wilkins said on the occasion that Manhire&#x27;s name &quot;is synonymous with creative writing at Victoria&quot;.

Manhire has published a number of poetry collections, including notably his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (2001). His poetry is known for word-play, experimentation and his ironic and whimsical sense of humour. Critic Iain Sharp writes that Manhire&#x27;s reputation &quot;rests on a solid, seriously intentioned body of work, notable for its oblique lyricism and sense of wonder at the strangeness of both life and language&quot;. After his fifth book of poetry, &quot;Good Looks&quot; (1982), Manhire for a time switched to writing prose, publishing &quot;The Brain of Katherine Mansfield&quot; (1988), a book in the style of the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; series with illustrations by Gregory O&#x27;Brien, and &quot;The New Land&quot; (1990), a collection of satirical short stories. In 1986 he wrote a critical study of fellow New Zealand writer Maurice Gee.

In 1998, Manhire went to Antarctica for several weeks with poet Chris Orsman and painter Nigel Brown, as part of the Artists to Antarctica programme run by Antarctica New Zealand. The experience inspired a number of poems which formed the basis of his collection &quot;What to Call Your Child&quot; (1999), as well as a subsequent anthology of writing about Antarctica called &quot;The Wide White Page: Writers Imagine Antarctica&quot; (2004) which he edited and introduced. For the 25th anniversary of the Erebus air disaster in 2004, Manhire wrote the poem &quot;Erebus Voices&quot;, which was read by Sir Edmund Hillary at the commemorative service at Scott Base, Antarctica.

Throughout his career Manhire has been a significant promoter of New Zealand poetry and other local writing, acting as editor of several compilations of New Zealand works, including &quot;NZ Listener Short Stories&quot; (1977), &quot;Some Other Country: New Zealand&#x27;s Best Short Stories&quot; (with his wife Marion McLeod, 1984, with updated editions published in 1992, 1997 and 2007) and &quot;Six by Six: Short Stories by New Zealand&#x27;s Best Writers&quot; (1989). His collection of New Zealand poetry, &quot;100 New Zealand Poems&quot; (1993), proved particularly popular, and was subsequently expanded to become &quot;121 New Zealand Poems&quot; (2005). He was a founding publisher of the online Best New Zealand Poems series, which began in 2000. For many years he presented a poetry segment on the Kim Hill Show on Radio New Zealand. To mark his 60th birthday in 2006, Victoria University Press and &quot;Sport&quot; published the limited edition &quot;Manhire at 60: A Book for Bill&quot;. The book featured essays, poems, stories and other written work from over 40 writers who had been inspired by Manhire.

Manhire has regularly worked collaboratively with other artists and creators during his career, including with the artist Ralph Hotere, physicist Paul Callaghan, composer Norman Meehan and singer Hannah Griffin. His work with Meehan and Griffin has resulted in a range of music publications with lyrics or words by Manhire, including &quot;Buddhist Rain&quot; (2010) and &quot;These Rough Notes&quot; (2012).

==Awards and honours==
Manhire has received a number of New Zealand&#x27;s most prestigious literary awards and fellowships, including the Katherine Mansfield Menton Fellowship in 2004, an Arts Foundation Laureate Award in 2004 and the Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Literary Achievement in 2007. He received the Lilian Ida Smith Award in 1987 for fiction and in 1989 for poetry. He was appointed the first New Zealand Poet Laureate in 1996, and from January to May 1999 was the Fulbright visiting professor in New Zealand studies at Georgetown University.

In the 2005 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to literature, and that same year received an honorary doctorate of literature from the University of Otago. In 2010 he was appointed a fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand Te Apārangi. In 2015 he was the UNESCO visiting professor of creative writing at the University of East Anglia. In 2018, the Arts Foundation of New Zealand bestowed on him the Icon Award, an award recognising New Zealand&#x27;s greatest artists, which is limited to 20 living recipients. In 2021 he received an honorary doctorate of literature from University College London.

<text>The hooded wheatear (Oenanthe monacha) is a wheatear, a small insectivorous passerine that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
This species is placed in the genus &quot;Oenanthe&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The generic name, &quot;Oenanthe&quot;, is also the name of a plant genus, the water dropworts, and is derived from the Greek &quot;ainos&quot; &quot;wine&quot; and &quot;anthos&quot; &quot;flower&quot;, from the wine-like scent of the flowers. In the case of the wheatear, it refers to the northern wheatears&#x27; return to Greece in the spring at the time that the grapevines blossom. The specific &quot;monacha&quot; is from late latin &quot;monachus&quot;, monk; meaning hooded.

Its English name has nothing to do with wheat or with ear, but is an altered (perhaps bowdlerised) form of white-arse, which refers to its prominent white rump.

The hooded wheatear is a monotypic species.

== Description ==
This wheatear has a body length of , a wingspan of , and weighs . In summer the male is a white and black bird. The white crown and belly contrast with the black face, back and throat. The tail and rump are white with black central tail feathers.

The female is brown, becoming somewhat paler below. The tail pattern is similar to the male&#x27;s, but the ground colour is buff rather than white.

== Ecology ==
The Hooded wheatear is a resident breeder in unvegetated desert from eastern Egypt through the Arabian Peninsula used to be in UAE and Oman a scarce breeder in Hajar mountains to Iran and Pakistan. It occurs annually in Cyprus on passage. The nest is built in a rock crevice, and 3-6 eggs is the normal clutch.

It feeds on insects, often taken in the air. Its call is a whistled &quot;vit&quot;, and the song is a harsh chattering.

== Status ==
The species is classified as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to its wide distribution, stable population trends, and presumed large enough population size, although precise population estimates are lacking.

<text>The Southland Plains is a general name given to several areas of low-lying land in the South Island of New Zealand, separated by the rise of the Hokonui Hills in the north. It forms a sizeable area of Southland region and encompasses its two principal settlements the city of Invercargill and the town of Gore. The Southland Plains include some of New Zealand&#x27;s most fertile farmland.

==Geography==
The Plains extend from the Waiau River in the west to the Mataura River which forms the border with the Otago region to the east. It can be divided into three broad areas: the Southland plain proper, the Waimea Plains and the lower Waiau plain to the west near the Waiau river.

The Southland and Waimea Plains are separated by the uplands of the Hokonui Hills, which lie to the west of Gore. The Southland plain lies to the north of the city of Invercargill, and is formed by several large rivers, the Aparima, the Ōreti, and the Makarewa. They stretch inland for over 45 kilometres from the coast of the Foveaux Strait, and cover an area of close to 1500 km2.

To the northeast of Invercargill, the Waimea Plains of the Mataura River and its tributary the Waimea River stretch inland as far as the town of Gore. At their southern extreme they become the Awarua Plain, a large area of marshy land which stretches from near Bluff to the foot of the Catlins in the far east. Between them, the lowlands around the Awarua Plain and Mataura River cover a further 2000 km2.

To the west lies the lower Waiau plain which is situated around the mouth of the Waiau River. This smaller region is wedged between the Longwood Range to the east and Fiordland to the west.

<doc id="1101054" wikidata="Q408704" url="?curid=1101054" title="Propylhexedrine">
<text>Propylhexedrine, sold under the brand name Benzedrex among others, is an alkylamine primarily utilized as a topical nasal decongestant. Its main indications are relief of congestion due to colds, allergies, and allergic rhinitis. Propylhexedrine was first used medically in 1949, with the release of Benzedrex by Smith, Kline &amp; French, and it has been used, mainly within the United States, since then.

==Medical use==
Propylhexedrine is used to treat acute nasal congestion related to the common cold, allergies, and hay fever. For nasal congestion, the dosage is listed as four inhalations (two inhalations per nostril) every two hours for adults and children 6–12 years of age. Each inhalation delivers 0.4 to 0.5 mg (400 to 500 &quot;μ&quot;g) in 800 mL of air. Use is not to exceed three days.

Historically, it has also been used for weight loss in oral tablet preparations at a dose of 25 mg. No medications containing propylhexedrine are currently approved for weight loss in any country since roughly 1976.

==Contraindications==
Propylhexedrine should not be used if a MAOI has been used in the past 14 days or is currently in use by a person.

Unlike other topical decongestants, propylhexedrine is not required to carry a warning against use in individuals with hypertension.

Propylhexedrine is not recommended in individuals younger than six years of age. There is at least one case of reported accidental poisoning resulting from child access to a propylhexedrine product.

== Adverse effects ==
When used as an inhaler, the most common adverse effects warned about for propylhexedrine are temporary discomfort (e.g., stinging or burning sensations) or rebound congestion. The sharing of propylhexedrine inhalers may spread infection. The occurrence of these adverse effects is uncommon as propylhexedrine is generally recognized as safe and effective. However, the use of propylhexedrine products in manners not intended by their labeling can result in severe adverse effects not typically encountered in therapeutic settings. The outcomes of improperly using propylhexedrine products can include hospitalization, disability, or even death. Public health agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have advised propylhexedrine products only be used in the manners directed on their label.

== Overdose ==
Reports of overdoses from propylhexedrine have been documented, but they are uncommon. Most instances of overdoses attributed to propylhexedrine have been the result of improper use of a propylhexedrine product in a manner not intended by its labeling for (non-medical) recreational purposes. As noted by the FDA, the most common symptoms of propylhexedrine overdose are the following: &quot;[r]apid heart rate, agitation, high blood pressure, chest pain, tremor, hallucinations, delusions, confusion, nausea, and vomiting.&quot; The use of propylhexedrine products in manners inconsistent with their labeling has proven fatal in some cases. Propylhexedrine products are considered to be safe and effective if used as intended. Regardless, medical attention should be sought in the case of suspected overdose.

== Interactions ==
Most of propylhexedrine&#x27;s interactions with other medications have to do with its ability to constrict blood vessels. Propylhexedrine’s most serious interaction is with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which are contraindicated. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are used, albeit uncommonly, as an antidepressant. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when administering propylhexedrine concurrently with other medicines.

==Pharmacology==

=== Mechanism of action ===
Propylhexedrine works mainly as an adrenergic agonist, when used at therapeutic doses in an inhaler dosage form. This restricts the blood vessels in the nose and reduces swelling; thereby, it relieves nasal congestion. At higher doses, propylhexedrine affects the central nervous system as a norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (NDRA). Propylhexedrine likely exerts such effects in a manner similar to related alkylamines such as cyclopentamine, methylhexanamine, and tuaminoheptane. Propylhexedrine also exhibits antihypotensive effects.

===Pharmacokinetics===

Propylhexedrine undergoes metabolism via N-demethylation, C-oxidation, N-oxidation, dehydrogenation, and hydrolysis to form various metabolites such as norpropylhexedrine, cyclohexylacetoxime, cyclohexylacetone, and 4-hydroxypropylhexedrine.
==Chemistry==

Freebase propylhexedrine is a volatile, oily liquid at room temperature. The slow evaporation of freebase propylhexedrine allows it to be administered via inhalation. The evaporation of the freebase also accounts for the limited shelf-life of propylhexedrine inhalers. Many of the salts of propylhexedrine are stable, clear to off-white crystalline substances that readily dissolve in water.

Propylhexedrine is similar in chemical structure to phenylethylamines. Phenylethylamines and substituted phenethylamines are found in the core of many trace amines and sympathomimetic drugs. The main difference is the presence of an alicyclic cyclohexyl group instead of the aromatic phenyl group of a phenethylamine.

Propylhexedrine is a chiral compound. The active ingredient contained in Benzedrex inhalers is racemic (&quot;RS&quot;)-propylhexedrine as the free base. (&quot;S&quot;)-Propylhexedrine, also known as levopropylhexedrine, is believed to be the more biologically active isomer of the two. The dextrorotatory counterpart, which is mainly unused, is dextropropylhexedrine.

===Synthesis===
Propylhexedrine can be synthesized from cyclohexylacetone through the reductive amination of an intermediary imine over an aluminum-mercury amalgam in the presence of a hydrogen source.

However, propylhexedrine is more commonly prepared by the catalytic hydrogenation of methamphetamine over Adams&#x27; catalyst. This transforms methamphetamine&#x27;s phenyl ring to a cyclohexyl moiety.

=== Detection in bodily fluids ===
Due to its structure, administration of propylhexedrine can lead to false positives for phenethylamine derivatives on urinalysis panels. Propylhexedrine can be differentiated upon further analysis.

== History ==
Propylhexedrine&#x27;s medical use as a decongestant evolved from desires to find safer alternatives to previous agents. After searching for such an agent, Dr. Glenn E. Ullyot patented propylhexedrine as a decongestant in 1948. This patent was issued for benefit of Smith, Kline &amp; French. Before it was sold nationally in the United States, propylhexedrine underwent market trials in California. These market trials began on July 15, 1949. Propylhexedrine (under the brand name Benzedrex) was first introduced into commerce on August 4, 1949. 

Approval for use in the United Kingdom soon followed in 1956. Later, approval for use in Canada was granted in 1998. In 2023, B. F. Ascher &amp; Co. decreased the amount of propylhexedrine in the Benzedrex inhaler from its historic 250 milligrams down to 175 milligrams.

Barbexaclone, an anticonvulsant containing propylhexedrine, was used in Turkey until its withdrawal from the market in 2009. Barbexaclone&#x27;s former niche in Turkish medicine is now largely occupied by levetiracetam.

== Manufacturing ==
The manufacture of propylhexedrine products for therapeutic use is typically performed based on guidelines established in government regulations and pharmacopeia monographs.

The illicit manufacture or diversion of propylhexedrine by clandestine chemists for use as a recreational drug has been documented in academic literature. Similar to when opioids are manufactured clandestinely for recreational use, it is unlikely that propylhexedrine produced by clandestine chemists adhere to the standards for purity, identity, and strength required of therapeutic products.

==Society and culture==
===Legal status===
==== International control ====

Propylhexedrine was placed under international control by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances in 1985. This action was reversed in 1991.

==== Australia ====
Propylhexedrine is an S4 substance in Australia.

==== Brazil ====
Propylhexedrine is a Class B1 substance in Brazil.

==== Canada ====
Propylhexedrine was long reported to be a Schedule V substance in Canada. In 2022, this status changed and propylhexedrine has since been removed from control under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

==== Germany ====
Propylhexedrine is regulated as a prescription medicine in Germany. Initially, propylhexedrine products (namely Obesin) were available over-the-counter. However, this changed in the 1970s and propylhexedrine is now regulated as a prescription product in Germany.

==== United Kingdom ====
It was formerly a Class C substance in the United Kingdom, but was deregulated in 1995. Propylhexedrine was used recreationally during a brief period in the 1970s after increased government regulation on earlier decongestants due to misuse.

==== United States ====
On the 4th of April 1988, propylhexedrine was designated a controlled substance (Schedule V) in the United States. This was done to satisfy U.S. compliance with an international treaty. However, in 1991, this action was reversed and propylhexedrine was removed from control under the Controlled Substances Act. This was based on the opinion of the Drug Enforcement Administration that propylhexedrine did not warrant control. The substance has remained unregulated under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States ever since. Furthermore, pursuant to DEA regulations, certain Benzedrex inhalers are specifically exempt from the Controlled Substances Act. Propylhexedrine remains regulated under the laws of several U.S. states. These states include the states of Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, and Rhode Island.

===Recreational use===
Multiple public health agencies (most notably within the United States) have warned against the recreational use of propylhexedrine and advised for its use only as directed by a product&#x27;s labeling; nonetheless it has been reported, through the literature as early as 1959, that propylhexedrine products have been used for recreational purposes. Recreational use is potentially fatal, its risks are magnified when administering the substance through injection means, and the adverse effects of recreational propylhexedrine are more severe when compared to related substances. The undesirable side effects of propylhexedrine at recreational doses are less tolerable compared to other substances that produce similar effects; consequently, propylhexedrine is less desirable for recreational use. The fact that propylhexedrine is less potent than comparable substances has also limited recreational use. Even in areas with prevalent substance use, the use of propylhexedrine was reported as non-significant. The recreational use of nasal decongestant, anorectic, and anticonvulsant preparations have all been reported. The recreational use of propylhexedrine products has been on the rise since the early 2000s.

In 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the following warning in regard to recreational use of propylhexedrine products in manners inconsistent with their labeling:

That same year, the Indian Health Service issued the following statement in reference to the recreational use of propylhexedrine products:

A year later, in 2022, the U.S. Army published the following guidance on propylhexedrine. The guidance states that recreational use of propylhexedrine is not permissible by service-members, can open its participants up to disciplinary action, and carries potentially fatal risks:

Put briefly, the FDA, Indian Health Service, and U.S. Army all advise individuals not to use propylhexedrine products for recreational purposes.

=== Economics ===
Propylhexedrine, under the brand name Benzedrex, is sold online by retailers such as Amazon, eBay, and Walmart. Propylhexedrine has been sold in some countries as an anorectic or as part of an anticonvulsant preparation; however, such products are not sold freely to consumers and require a physician&#x27;s prescription.

=== Brand names ===

==== Benzedrex inhaler ====

Propylhexedrine, as a nasal decongestant, is currently marketed under the trade name Benzedrex. The name Benzedrex was initially trademarked by Smith, Kline &amp; French in 1944. The brand was passed onto Menley James Laboratories (through a subsidiary, NuMark Laboratories) in 1990, and was finally acquired by B. F. Ascher &amp; Co. in 1998.

==== Dristan inhaler ====

Propylhexedrine was also sold in inhaler form by Whitehall Laboratories (Wyeth) under the Dristan brand name as an inhaler. In January 1966, propylhexedrine replaced mephentermine as the active ingredient in the product. The Dristan inhaler has since been discontinued. Furthermore, Wyeth was acquired by Pfizer in 2009. All products currently sold under the Dristan brand are manufactured by Foundation Consumer Brands; Foundation Consumer Brands acquired the Dristan brand in 2020. Foundation Consumer Brands is itself owned by Kelso &amp; Company.

==== Obesin ====

Propylhexedrine has also seen use in Europe as an appetite suppressant, under the trade name Obesin. Obesin has been referenced in literature dating back to the 1950s. Obesin was manufactured by Fahlberg-List in East Germany from 1958 to around 1976. The discontinuation of Obesin was the result of increased regulatory restrictions on over-the-counter anorectics. These restrictions began to be imposed in 1974. Fahlberg-List itself dissolved in 1995.

==== Maliasin ====
Propylhexedrine is a component in the anticonvulsant preparation barbexaclone. Its &quot;S&quot;-isomer (levopropylhexedrine or -propylhexedrine) is bonded with phenobarbital for the purpose of offsetting the barbiturate-induced sedation. Barbexaclone has been known under the brand name of Maliasin, manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, as early as 1965. Maliasin has also been manufactured by Knoll Pharmaceuticals; Knoll is a company acquired by Abbott Laboratories. In 2010, Abbott discontinued sale of its barbexaclone preparation in many countries.

==== Eventin ====
Levopropylhexedrine (the more active optical isomer of propylhexedrine) has been used as an appetite suppressant under the brand name Eventin. Eventin&#x27;s use has been documented as early as 1958.

<text>Tortoise Matsumoto (トータス松本 &quot;Tōtasu Matsumoto&quot;, born December 28, 1966, as 松本敦 Atsushi Matsumoto) is the lead singer of the Japanese guitar group, Ulfuls. He has also had a couple of acting roles in TV dramas, starting with &quot;Namida o Fuite&quot; (涙をふいて) in 2000.

Trigun character Nicholas D. Wolfwood is modeled after him.

On July 11, 2018, Matsumoto, Tamio Okuda, Kazuyoshi Saito, Yohito Teraoka (Jun Sky Walkers), Takashi Hamazaki (Flying Kids) and Yo-King (Magokoro Brothers) announced the formation of a supergroup called the . Each member is a multi-instrumentalist with all of them at-least being able to provide vocals and guitar and, like the Traveling Wilburys, each uses a pseudonym featuring &quot;Sitone&quot;. They formed for a concert on September 23, 2018, at Zepp Tokyo celebrating Teraoka&#x27;s 25th anniversary as a musician.

<text>The Awarua Plain is a large area of wetland to the east of Bluff, New Zealand. Covering an area of around 600 km², the plain stretches for 35 kilometres along the coast of Foveaux Strait. This stretch of coast includes the peninsula of Tiwai Point, Awarua Bay, the Waituna Lagoon, and Toetoes Bay. The Mataura River is the major river responsible for the presence of the Awarua Plain; along with the Ōreti River, it is a remnant of the rivers from the Ice Ages that formed the Southland Plains (Murihiku). In addition, several small streams enter Foveaux Strait along this stretch of coast, mainly via Awarua Bay and Waituna Lagoon.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;two streams&quot; for &quot;Awarua&quot;.

==Demographics==
The Awarua Plains statistical area covers within Southland District. It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Awarua Plains had a population of 1,020 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 6 people (−0.6%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 57 people (5.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 360 households, comprising 531 males and 489 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.09 males per female. The median age was 32.3 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 267 people (26.2%) aged under 15 years, 195 (19.1%) aged 15 to 29, 471 (46.2%) aged 30 to 64, and 87 (8.5%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 81.5% European/Pākehā, 13.2% Māori, 1.8% Pasifika, 11.8% Asian, and 3.2% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 17.1, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 51.2% had no religion, 39.7% were Christian, 0.3% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.6% were Hindu, 0.9% were Muslim, 0.6% were Buddhist and 1.2% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 117 (15.5%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 150 (19.9%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $40,500, compared with $31,800 nationally. 120 people (15.9%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 462 (61.4%) people were employed full-time, 150 (19.9%) were part-time, and 15 (2.0%) were unemployed.

==Radio facilities==

The Awarua Plain is suitable for radio facilities, due to low distant skylines, high ground conductivity and distance from sources of radio interference. An expedition seeking &#x27;an extensive area of flat lands [producing] the best results&#x27; first scouted the area for radio purposes in 1911.

Radio-related facilities here are:
* Unwin Radar of La Trobe University
* Awarua Tracking Station of the European Space Agency

===Awarua Radio===

Awarua Radio (callsign VLB or ZLB) was New Zealand&#x27;s main receiving and transmitting coast radio station providing worldwide radiotelegraph and voice communications with ships at sea. Some facilities were built by Telefunken of Germany. It was operated from 18 December 1913 by the New Zealand Post Office (to 31 March 1986) then by NZPO successor corporation Telecom New Zealand until the station closed on 30 August 1991.

The site was selected following an expedition in 1911 led by Mr J Orchiston, head of the New Zealand Telegraph Department, Captain Gard&#x27;ner of the New Zealand Artillery and representatives of AWA, seeking &#x27;an extensive area of flat lands [producing] the best results&#x27;.

<text>Kapap (, ), often written KAPAP, a Hebrew acronym for &quot;Krav Panim el Panim&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; face-to-face combat), is a close-quarter battle system of defensive tactics, hand-to-hand combat and self-defense.

==History==
The Kapap system was developed in the late 1930s, within the Jewish Aliyah camps as part of preparatory training before their arrival in Mandatory Palestine. It was primarily considered a practical skill set that was acquired during the training period of the Palmach and Haganah fighters. The main focus was to upgrade the physical endurance, to elevate and strengthen the spirit, and to develop a defensive and offensive skill set. It included cold weapon practical usage, boxing, judo, jujutsu, karate, as well as fighting with knives and sticks.

In the 1930s, Maishel Horovitz, the leader of HaMahanot HaOlim youth movement, developed a short stick fighting method in order to deal with the British policemen who were armed with clubs. Later, his method became one of the main components of hand-to-hand combat training for all the Haganah fighters, therefore making a major contribution to the development of Kapap. According to the historian Noah Gross, however, Horovitz did not even know that his stick-fighting system was taught to the soldiers until 1959.

Chaim Pe&#x27;er is the President and founder of the International Kapap Federation. He is recognized internationally as a Soke – founder of the modern Kapap system.

==International Kapap organizations==
===Kapap Europe===
Kapap Europe is organized and headed by Kapap Level 4 instructors, Sam Markey and William Paardekooper. Sam and William are the highest-ranking members of the International Kapap Federation in Europe. Markey holds monthly seminars in the United Kingdom to train and develop the European Kapap Instructor Team. Paardekooper holds courses in mainland Europe.

Sam Markey met Avi Nardia in the USA. He introduced Kapap to the United Kingdom and he was the first person authorized by Major Avi Nardia and Lt. Col. Chaim Pe&#x27;er to open an authorized Kapap training center.

===Kapap Asia===
Kapap Federation Asia is headed by Master Teo Yew Chye (Kapap Level 3 Instructor) and his training team on behalf of Major Avi Nardia and Lt. Col. Chaim Pe&#x27;er.

<doc id="1101069" wikidata="Q1190519" url="?curid=1101069" title="List of unsolved problems in computer science">
<text>This article is a list of notable unsolved problems in computer science. A problem in computer science is considered unsolved when no solution is known or when experts in the field disagree about proposed solutions.

==Computational complexity==

* P versus NP problem
* What is the relationship between BQP and NP?
* NC = P problem The P vs NP problem is a major unsolved question in computer science that asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer (NP) can also be quickly solved by a computer (P). This question has profound implications for fields such as cryptography, algorithm design, and computational theory.
* NP = co-NP problem
* P = BPP problem
* P = PSPACE problem
* L = NL problem
* PH = PSPACE problem
* L = P problem
* L = RL problem
* Unique games conjecture
* Is the exponential time hypothesis true?
** Is the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH) true?
* Do one-way functions exist?
** Is public-key cryptography possible?
* Log-rank conjecture

==Polynomial versus nondeterministic-polynomial time for specific algorithmic problems==

* Can integer factorization be done in polynomial time on a classical (non-quantum) computer?
* Can the discrete logarithm be computed in polynomial time on a classical (non-quantum) computer?
* Can the shortest vector of a lattice be computed in polynomial time on a classical or quantum computer?
* Can the graph isomorphism problem be solved in polynomial time on a classical computer? 
The graph isomorphism problem involves determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic, meaning there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices and edges that preserves adjacency. While the problem is known to be in NP, it is not known whether it is NP-complete or solvable in polynomial time. This uncertainty places it in a unique complexity class, making it a significant open problem in computer science.

* Is graph canonization polynomial time equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem?
* Can leaf powers and -leaf powers be recognized in polynomial time?
* Can parity games be solved in polynomial time?
* Can the rotation distance between two binary trees be computed in polynomial time?
* Can graphs of bounded clique-width be recognized in polynomial time?
* Can one find a simple closed quasigeodesic on a convex polyhedron in polynomial time?
* Can a simultaneous embedding with fixed edges for two given graphs be found in polynomial time?
* Can the square-root sum problem be solved in polynomial time in the Turing machine model?

==Other algorithmic problems==
* The dynamic optimality conjecture: Do splay trees have a bounded competitive ratio?
* Can a depth-first search tree be constructed in NC?
* Can the fast Fourier transform be computed in time?
* What is the fastest algorithm for multiplication of two &quot;n&quot;-digit numbers?
* What is the lowest possible average-case time complexity of Shellsort with a deterministic fixed gap sequence?
* Can 3SUM be solved in strongly sub-quadratic time, that is, in time for some ?
* Can the edit distance between two strings of length be computed in strongly sub-quadratic time? (This is only possible if the strong exponential time hypothesis is false.)
* Can X + Y sorting be done in time?
* What is the fastest algorithm for matrix multiplication?
* Can all-pairs shortest paths be computed in strongly sub-cubic time, that is, in time for some ?
* Can the Schwartz–Zippel lemma for polynomial identity testing be derandomized?
* Does linear programming admit a strongly polynomial-time algorithm? (This is problem #9 in Smale&#x27;s list of problems.)
* How many queries are required for envy-free cake-cutting?
* What is the algorithmic complexity of the minimum spanning tree problem? Equivalently, what is the decision tree complexity of the MST problem? The optimal algorithm to compute MSTs is known, but it relies on decision trees, so its complexity is unknown.
* Gilbert–Pollak conjecture: Is the Steiner ratio of the Euclidean plane equal to formula_1?

==Programming language theory==

* Barendregt–Geuvers–Klop conjecture

==Other problems==
* Is the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture true?
* Černý Conjecture: If a deterministic finite automaton with formula_2 states has a synchronizing word, must it have one of length at most formula_3?
* Generalized star-height problem: Can all regular languages be expressed using generalized regular expressions with a limited nesting depth of Kleene stars?
* Separating words problem: How many states are needed in a deterministic finite automaton that behaves differently on two given strings of length formula_2?
* What is the Turing completeness status of all unique elementary cellular automata?
* The problem to determine all positive integers formula_2 such that the concatenation of formula_2 and formula_7 in base formula_8 uses at most formula_9 distinct characters for formula_8 and formula_9 fixed and many other problems in the coding theory are also the unsolved problems in mathematics.

<text>Finsch&#x27;s wheatear (&quot;Oenanthe finschii)&quot; is a wheatear, a small insectivorous passerine that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family, Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher of the family Muscicapidae.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The common name and scientific name commemorate the German ethnographer, naturalist and colonial explorer Friedrich Hermann Otto Finsch (8 August 1839 – 31 January 1917, Braunschweig).

=== Subspecies ===
There are two recognized subspecies:

* &quot;O. f. finschii&quot; – The nominate subspecies. Summers and breeds from southern Turkey south to northern Israel, and east to western Iran; winters in Cyprus and Egypt.
* &quot;O. f. barnesi&quot; – Summers and breeds from eastern Turkey to eastern and central Iran, southern Kazakhstan, and western Pakistan and Afghanistan; winters in southwestern Asia.

== Description ==
A medium-sized elegant wheatear with long wings and long legs. It measures long, with wingspan, and weigh . In summer the male Finsch&#x27;s wheatear is a white and black bird. The white crown, central back and belly contrast with the black face, throat and wings. The tail and rump are white, with an inverted black T giving a pattern like eastern black-eared wheatear, but with a uniformly wide terminal band.

The female is brown-grey above, becoming dirty white below. The tail pattern is similar to the male&#x27;s.

Its call is a whistled &quot;tsit&quot;, and the song is a mix of clear notes with whistles and crackling.

== Ecology ==
Finsch&#x27;s wheatear breeds in semi-desert and stony hillsides from Turkey east to Afghanistan and western Pakistan. It is a short-distance migrant, wintering in Egypt, Cyprus and the Greater Middle East. The nest is built in a rock crevice, and 4-5 eggs is the normal clutch.

It feeds mainly on insects.

== Status ==
The species has a wide distribution range, a large population, and although it&#x27;s population trends are unknown, they are not believed to be fast enough to approach vulnerability. As a result, it is classified as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

In Europe, the estimated breeding population ranges from 102,000 to 309,000 pairs, representing approximately 25% of the species&#x27; global range. This translates to a preliminary global population estimate of 816,000 to 2,470,000 mature individuals, requiring further validation.

<doc id="1101083" wikidata="Q8807" url="?curid=1101083" title="2002 Venezuelan coup attempt">
<text>A failed coup d&#x27;état on 11 April 2002 saw the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, ousted from office for 47 hours before being restored to power. Chávez was aided in his return to power by popular support and mobilization against the coup by loyal ranks in the military.

By early 2002, Chávez&#x27;s approval rating had dropped to around 30%, with many business, Church and media leaders being opposed to Chávez&#x27;s use of emergency powers to bypass the National Assembly and institute significant government changes, arguing they were increasingly authoritarian. Meanwhile, the growing dissatisfaction with Chávez among those in the military due to his aggressive manner and alliances with Cuba and paramilitaries led multiple officers to call on Chávez to resign. Demonstrations and counter-demonstrations took place on a weekly basis as the country became increasingly divided. Retired military officers, former politicians, union leaders, and spokespeople for the Catholic Church claimed they had military support to remove Chávez from power, with an April 6 CIA intelligence report warning that plotters would try to exploit social unrest from upcoming opposition demonstrations for his removal.

Tensions worsened on 7 April, when PDVSA President Guaicaipuro Lameda Montero and 5 of the 7 members of the board of directors were fired. On 9 April, a general strike was called by the trade union organization National Federation of Trade Unions (&quot;Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela&quot;, CTV). The proposed strike was in response to Chávez&#x27;s appointments to prominent posts in Venezuela&#x27;s national oil company, PDVSA. Two days later in Caracas, up to one million Venezuelans marched in opposition to Chávez. After stopping at its original end point, the march continued towards the presidential palace, Miraflores, where government supporters and Bolivarian Circles were holding their own rally. Upon the opposition&#x27;s arrival, the two sides confronted each other. A shootout started at the Llaguno Overpass, near the Miraflores Palace, and by that evening 19 people were dead. Chávez ordered the implementation of &quot;Plan Ávila&quot;, a military plan to mobilize an emergency force to protect the palace in the event of a coup. As the plan had resulted in the killing of hundreds of Venezuelans during the &quot;Caracazo&quot;, military high command refused and demanded he resign. President Chávez was subsequently arrested by the military. Chávez&#x27;s request for asylum in Cuba was denied, and he was ordered to be tried in a Venezuelan court.

Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce (&quot;Fedecámaras&quot;) president Pedro Carmona was declared interim president. During his brief rule, the National Assembly and the Supreme Court were both dissolved and the country&#x27;s 1999 Constitution was declared void, pledged a return to the pre-1999 bicameral parliamentary system, parliamentary elections by December, presidential elections where he would not stand. By the 13th, the coup was on the verge of collapse, as Carmona&#x27;s attempts to entirely undo Chávez&#x27;s reforms angered much of the public and key sectors of the military, while parts of the opposition movement also refused to back Carmona. In Caracas, Chávez supporters surrounded the presidential palace, seized television stations and demanded his return. Carmona resigned the same night. The pro-Chávez Presidential Guard retook Miraflores without firing a shot, leading to the removal of the Carmona government and the re-installation of Chávez as president.

On January 15, 2004, during a speech before the National Assembly, Chávez would afterwards admit that he deliberately provoked a crisis with his actions, declaring that &quot;what happened with PDVSA was necessary&quot; and &quot;when I grabbed the whistle in an Aló Presidente and started to fire people, I was provoking the crisis&quot;.

==Background and rising tensions==
Hugo Chávez was first elected president in 1998. One of his campaign promises was to convene a new constitutional convention, and on 15 December 1999 he put the new Constitution of Venezuela to the voters in a referendum. Following the 1999 constitutional referendum, Chávez was reelected in 2000 under the terms of the new constitution. Following these elections, Chávez had gained control of all formerly independent institutions of the Venezuelan government. The popularity of Chávez then dropped due to his clashes with multiple social groups he had alienated and his close ties with controversial world leaders such as Ali Khamenei, Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi and especially Fidel Castro. 

Chávez used a strategy of polarization in Venezuela, a &quot;them against us&quot; situation, in order to single out those who stood in the way of his progress. He would insult and use name calling against original supporters that would question him; the media, business leaders, the Catholic Church and the middle class. Such &quot;words spawned hatred and polarization&quot; with Chávez, &quot;a master of language and communication&quot;, creating his own reality among Venezuelans. Nelson says that what hurt Chávez&#x27;s popularity the most was his relationship with Fidel Castro and Cuba, with Chávez attempting to make Venezuela in Cuba&#x27;s image. Venezuela became Cuba&#x27;s largest trade partner while Chávez, following Castro&#x27;s example, consolidated the country&#x27;s bicameral legislature into a single National Assembly that gave him more power and created community groups of loyal supporters allegedly trained as paramilitaries. Such actions created great fear among Venezuelans who felt like they were tricked and that Chávez had dictatorial goals.

Opposition to the Chávez government was then particularly strong, with some of those who were previously in the government before the election of Chávez. The independent media became the primary check on Chávez after he had taken control of most of the Venezuelan government, with the Venezuelan media acting like other forms of media in Latin America at the time that demanded accountability for governmental abuses and exposing corruption. The opposition was worried with Chávez because they believed his rewriting Venezuela&#x27;s constitution were signs that Chávez was trying to maintain power through authoritarianism. In early 2002, there were also increasing signs of discontent in the military; in February four military officials, including a general and a rear admiral, publicly called on Chávez to resign. On 7 February 2002 Venezuela Air Force Colonel Pedro Vicente Soto and National Reserve Captain Pedro Flores Rivero led a rally protesting the Chávez government&#x27;s practices denounced as undemocratic and authoritarian. Rear Admiral Carlos Molina Tamayo said on television that if Chávez did not resign, he should be impeached.

Chávez&#x27;s opposition originated from the response to the &quot;cubanization&quot; of Venezuela when mothers realized that the new textbooks in Venezuela were really Cuban books filled with revolutionary propaganda and with different covers causing them to protest. By the summer months of 2001, the opposition groups grew quickly from concerned mothers to labor unions, business interests, church groups, and right and leftwing political parties, who felt that they were being isolated. At the same time, groups supporting Chávez became organized, especially among the poor, with their passion for Chávez bordering idolatry since he gave them hope and feeling of being valuable.

=== The 49 Laws ===
Between 2001 and 2003, multiple chavistas started opposing Chávez as well. On 28 July 2001, Pedro Carmona defeats Alberto Cudemus, a businessman close to Chavism, in the elections for President of Fedecámaras. On August 4, Carmona coincides with Chavez at the Venezuelan Military Academy, where the anniversary of the National Guard was being celebrated. According to Carmona, Chávez told he no longer wanted conflicts with Fedecámaras, and they plan a meeting on 22 August at the Miraflores Presidential Palace. At the meeting, Carmona proposes to Chávez a plan to lower unemployment, at that time at 17%, improving conditions in order to increase private investment up to 20% of the GDP in five years, while the latter responds with a plan to strengthen the public sector. A dialogue table was then created between Fedecámaras and the government, the latter represented by Jorge Giordani, Minister of Planning. The meetings did not bring results, despite the fact that they took place once a week and that Chávez was present in one of them. The government continued to elaborate 49 controversial laws without sharing their content with Fedecámaras or its agrarian equivalent, Fedenaga, which its critics argued violated Articles 206 and 211 of the Constitution.

On 13 November, Chavez decrees the 49 laws under the enabling law granted to him by the National Assembly in November 2000, a legal instrument which allowed him to legislate without the approval of the legislative power. Although originally two thirds of the Assembly were controlled by Chavismo, the situation had changed due to the fact that some deputies had become dissident and it was unlikely that Chávez would be able to obtain another enabling law, reason for which Chávez approved the laws the day before his special power expired. The laws included the Organic Hydrocarbons Law, the Fishing Law, the Special Law of Cooperative Associations and the General Ports Law, and included the rearrangement of public ministries and government major laws change, but the Land and Agrarian Development Law was the most controversial.

The laws &quot;marked a turning point in public sentiment toward the president&quot; with both Chávez supporters and critics outraged at the changes. The two decrees in particular sparked protest: a law aimed at strengthening government control over the oil company PDVSA and a more controversial land reform law, which included provisions for the expropriation of &quot;idle&quot; lands. Though the government stated that it would provide the previous owners with compensation at the going market rates, the land laws introduced by Chávez were so vaguely worded that the government could legally expropriate any property it wished to take. While some of the land was genuinely given to the vulnerable, much of it was used in a system of patronage for party members loyal to Chávez.

McCaughan described the 49 laws as the &quot;plus ultra non&quot;, the &quot;point of no return for Chávez&#x27;s troubled relations with business, church and media leaders&quot;. For the opposition, such dramatic changes to the government proved to them that Chávez was a &quot;dictator-in-training&quot;. On 10 December 2001, a national strike shut down 90% of the economy and was the largest strike in Venezuela&#x27;s history, bigger than the strike that assisted with ending the dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez in 1958. By January 2002, protests involving hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans opposing Chávez became common in Venezuela.

=== Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) ===
In March 2002, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state oil company that acted autonomously and accounted for 70% of Venezuela&#x27;s foreign revenue, was targeted by Chávez out of fear of the oppositions ability to call national strikes and was to receive strict control from the government. Chávez&#x27;s attempts to end the functional independence of PDVSA were met with strong resistance from PDVSA officials and managers.

On 7 April, Chávez fired the president of PDVSA, Brigadier-General Guaicaipuro Lameda Montero and replaced him with a former Communist Party militant, in addition to firing another 5 of the 7 members of the PDVSA board of directors on his Aló Presidente program, mocking each worker by name and using a referee whistle, as if to expel them from a soccer match. Such actions by Chávez caused further opposition in the form of a series of walkouts and work slowdowns.

&quot;The Washington Times&quot; then noted that Chávez had &quot;choked off foreign investment by doubling the royalty payments oil companies must pay to the government and by restricting corporate ownership on some oil projects to 49 percent&quot;, and had &quot;alienated workers at his country&#x27;s state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, by replacing long-serving professionals with his supporters&quot;. By early 2002, Chávez&#x27;s approval rating dropped to around 30%. This action, according to &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;united all the anti-Chávez forces&quot;, bringing together union leader Carlos Ortega, head of the Confederation of Workers of Venezuela (&quot;Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela,&quot; CTV for short in Spanish), with Pedro Carmona Estanga, head of Venezuela&#x27;s main business federation, Fedecámaras, in a call for an &quot;indefinite general strike&quot; in support of oil workers.

=== Military ===
The existing military grew wary of Chávez due to his relationship with Fidel Castro and the Colombian guerrilla group FARC that they were previously taught &quot;were the greatest threat to their country&quot;. The military felt that after fighting against Castro&#x27;s influence, guerilla groups and attempts to overthrow previous Venezuelan governments to expand his revolutionary presence since the 1960s, that they had finally lost when Chávez came to power. Chávez promoted guerilla fighters into the Venezuelan military and forced the wary existing military servicemen to assist them. One of the more controversial actions that created discontent within the military was when Chávez forced them to assist the FARC with setting up camps in Venezuelan territories, providing ammunition to fight the Colombian government, supplying ID cards so they could move freely through Venezuela and sending members of Bolivarian Circles to their camps to receive guerilla training. The most controversial steps taken by Chávez was ordering the existing military to work with the Cuban military, with the Venezuelan military and intelligence agencies forced to open their bases, files and hard drives for their Cuban counterparts creating a sense of being betrayed by Chávez.

The &quot;long-simmering resentment in the military&quot; was articulated publicly by four high-level officers, including Air Force Gen. Roman Gomez Ruiz, who called on Chávez to &quot;resign peacefully and take responsibility for your failure&quot;. Chávez responded by declaring these officers traitors, ordering their arrest, and forcing their resignations. &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; later reported that although the Venezuelan general public was unaware of it, the country&#x27;s oil industry was approaching the end of a six-week work slowdown and Chávez&#x27;s government and oil executives had agreed that members of an oil board picked by Chávez would resign. &quot;But labor and business leaders, who had joined in secret with dissident military officers in an effort to oust Chávez, decided that the moment had come to press on&quot;, the newspaper maintained. &quot;The middle-class intellectuals and professionals who had at first delighted in Chávez&#x27;s talk of restoring &#x27;national honor, Sandra Hernandez later observed in &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;watched in dismay as Chávez&#x27;s supporters formed &#x27;Bolivarian circles&#x27;, muscle groups that intimidated government opponents with threats of physical harm&quot;. During the year or so preceding the coup, Chávez &quot;essentially thumbed his nose&quot; at his opponents, claimed a political consultant. Many opponents of Chávez felt that his behavior was self-destructive and that he would end up &quot;los[ing] power through constitutional means via the Supreme Court or the parliament&quot;. Nonetheless, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;discontented military officers had been meeting among themselves and with business leaders for almost a year to discuss ways to oust Mr. Chávez&quot;. These military officers &quot;said they would pick the leader&quot;, one officer said, because &quot;They did not want to be called a military junta, but they wanted to make sure that at least one military person was on the transitional board.&quot;

===Advanced planning===
Details surrounding a potential coup were openly discussed in Venezuela for months before the attempted ousting, with groups of former politicians, retired military officers, union leaders, and spokespeople for the Catholic Church claiming they had support within the military for a possible coup. &quot;The rumors of a coup to oust Chávez&quot;, noted &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, &quot;were being whispered, if not shouted, for months before the revolt&quot;. Writing about the run-up to the coup, Letta Tayler of &quot;Newsweek&quot; observed that &quot;[o]ne of the few certainties&quot; about it was &quot;that military, business, union and civic leaders had been plotting Chávez&#x27;s downfall for nearly two years&quot;.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that as early as 18 March 2002 that &quot;Chávez was saying that he was aware of a plot&quot; to overthrow him, and that in the days before 11 April, &quot;the political temperature was approaching boiling point&quot;, with oil workers striking &quot;in protest at Chávez&#x27;s appointments to their board&quot; and the media accelerating its criticisms of the regime. &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that there had been rumors in Caracas &quot;for weeks&quot; about a coup, with military figures like Navy Vice Adm. Carlos Molina and Air Force Col. Pedro Soto &quot;building support ... in the armed forces&quot; for a coup. Hernandez claimed that in early April, &quot;the coming coup ... was an open secret&quot;. On 9 April, retired Gen. Manuel Andara Clavier, one of many retired military officials who opposed Chávez, reportedly told her, &quot;The table is set. ... Everything is set for the military to let the president know he can&#x27;t push this country to spill blood.&quot;

====U.S. knowledge and warnings====
The United States learned of details about a potential coup in late-2001 due to the nature of Venezuelan individuals openly plotting to overthrow President Chávez. Generals who opposed Chavez notified U.S. officials of the impending coup, with one official noting they were not seeking U.S. approval but rather simply providing advanced knowledge. In March 2002 only days after United States ambassador to Venezuela Charles Shapiro began his duties in Venezuela and just weeks before the coup attempt, Shapiro met with a trade union organization. Ambassador Shapiro later said that, during this meeting, the group openly shared their desire to be part of the coup, with Shapiro informing them that the United States would not support such actions and that governmental change should only occur electorally.

On April 6, the C.I.A. completed a report titled, &quot;Conditions Ripening for Coup Attempt,&quot; writing, &quot;Dissident military factions, including some disgruntled senior officers and a group of radical junior officers, are stepping up efforts to organize a coup against President Chavez, possibly as early as this month.&quot; The report additionally explained how the coup was expected to happen: &quot;To provoke military action, the plotters may try to exploit unrest stemming from opposition demonstrations slated for later this month.&quot;

The United States embassy in Venezuela later stated that it had informed Chávez of a possible coup, though Chávez ignored their warnings. The United States government recognized Pedro Carmona as new President within hours of the coup and considered that Chávez had &quot;resigned&quot;.

====Government preparations====
On 7 April, the same day that President Chávez fired the PDVSA officials, Chávez met with his cabinet and high level military officials and began the meeting calling the actions by the opposition &quot;treasonous&quot; and asked those gathered how to counteract such actions. Soon discussions arose on how to defend Miraflores Palace. There were recommendations declaring a state of emergency, beginning the censorship of television and declaring martial law. Chávez then began to discuss Plan Ávila with Manuel Rosendo, the head of the Unified Command of the National Armed Forces, and how to implement it, though the military command did not accept it.

The Tactical Command, headed by Cilia Flores, and Freddy Bernal (mayor of the Libertador Municipality), then shared plans of using the Bolivarian Circles as a paramilitary force to end marches and also defend Chávez by organizing them into brigades. Another plan was to have the National Guard raid the offices of PDVSA in Chuao and occupy the company by force. They also discussed launching a disinformation propaganda campaign on public and private television and having government loyalists fill the highways with their vehicles and then present the images on TV as if people were busy working like any other day. In another plan to end the strike, Gastón Parra, the president of PDVSA, suggested to give bonuses to PDVSA employees who chose not to participate in the strike.

In a 9 April discussion between Finance Minister General Francisco Usón and General Jacinto Pérez, Pérez believed that the Bolivarian Revolution was in a crisis and needed to &quot;rejuvenate itself&quot;. Pérez then stated that the Bolivarian Revolution need had to be &quot;purified with blood&quot;, which concerned Usón since Pérez &quot;had the president&#x27;s ear&quot;. Both discussions outraged generals since they believed that the Venezuelan government was proposing violence against the public with General Rosendo stating that it seemed that &quot;Chávez actually wanted a confrontation, that he had picked the fight with PDVSA in order to precipitate a crisis&quot;.

Shortly before the coup attempt, Alí Rodríguez Araque, a former guerrilla and Chávez ally then serving in Vienna as the general secretary of OPEC, allegedly heard of a potential oil embargo against the United States by Iraq and Libya, over US support for Israel. Rodríguez Araque told Chávez that the United States could prod a coup to prevent any threat of an embargo. The advice led Chávez to declare that he would not join such an embargo, and to secretly hide several hundred troops in Miraflores&#x27; underground corridors, commanded by José Baduel.

===Strikes===
On 10 December, the opposition organised a one-day general strike, which was substantially effective. Newspapers, workplaces, schools and the stock exchange closed, although shops in poorer neighborhoods remained open. On 5 April 2002, the PDVSA opposition to Chávez moved to shut down the company. Thousands of opposition PDVSA employees, and two of the five main export terminals were paralyzed. On 6 April the Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela (CTV) trade union federation announced a 24-hour general strike for 9 April, to support the PDVSA protestors. It was joined the following day by Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce, headed by Pedro Carmona and Fedepetrol, the country&#x27;s largest blue-collar petroleum union. On 7 April, during the transmission of the television program Aló Presidente, started naming the PDVSA executives that announced the strike, mockingly blew a referee whistle, and proceeded to announce their dismissal. He fired seven executives forced another 12 into retirement. Tensions continued to escalate through March and early April.

Days after the firing of PDVSA heads, on 9 April, the general strike was moderately successful and oil production slowed. Newspapers were not published and television stations cancelled regular programming and commercials to run continuous coverage of the strike, including the stations&#x27; own opposition ads. The strike organizers declared it a success, which the government disputed, and in an effort to show its version of events, ordered a series of &quot;cadenas&quot; (mandatory government broadcasts), showing daily life continuing (over 30 cadenas on 8 and 9 April). On the evening of 9 April, the strike was extended for another 24 hours.

On 10 April, the strike was less effective, with many schools and businesses re-opening. As with the previous day, television provided continuous coverage, and the government intervened with cadenas – but this time the networks split the screen, showing the cadena on one side and their coverage of the strike on the other. On the evening of 10 April, Fedecámaras and CTV held televised news conference announcing that the strike would be extended indefinitely, unanimously voted for a &quot;coordinating committee for democracy and liberty&quot; in order to &quot;rescue Venezuela&#x27;s freedom&quot;. The opposition then called for a march to the PDVSA headquarters the following day. In the National Assembly, those close to Chávez stated that Chávez wanted &quot;moderation&quot;, though if an unlimited general strike were to occur from the opposition, an &quot;unspecified &#x27;violence will occur. Brigadier General Néstor González appeared on television to demand Chávez&#x27;s resignation and to issue an ultimatum.

===11 April march===
The crisis that triggered the coup came when &quot;workers and business leaders&quot;, infuriated by Chávez&#x27;s &quot;meddling in the state oil company&quot;, as the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; put it, joined in &quot;calling for a general strike that cut exports&quot; in support of striking oil workers. The strike began, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;as a managerial protest at the state-run oil company, but evolved into a broad effort supported by the country&#x27;s largest business and labor groups to force Chávez from power.&quot; After days of general strikes and protests involving thousands of Venezuelans, on 10 April, a speech was held at the CTV headquarters, where CTV and Fedecámaras held speeches that involved a brigadier general denouncing Chávez&#x27;s alleged involvement with FARC, and the announcement of a march the next day with the possibility of an indefinite strike. The march on 11 April was to begin at 9:00am, starting at Parque del Este and ending at the PDVSA headquarters.

On 11 April, just hours before an operation to take over the PDVSA by force was to begin, General Rosendo, knowing the consequences of such an action, talked Chávez out of the plan. Later that day, hundreds of thousands to millions of Venezuelans marched to the PDVSA headquarters later that day to protest against the recent dismissal of the management board. Once at the headquarters, those present at the rally began to chant &quot;To Miraflores! To Miraflores! To Miraflores!&quot;, in reference to the Miraflores Presidential Palace. In response, Carlos Ortega declared: &quot;This human river is now going to Miraflores to ask for your resignation&quot;, referring to Chávez. The National Guard would later repress the concentration in Chuao and, equipped with firearms, would confront the demonstrators in the vicinity of the Miraflores Palace.

Close to Miraflores, a line of police and National Guard held the marchers for a time, before the marchers pressed. Chavistas belonging to Bolivarian Circles, some with that had military training in Cuba, were also stationed outside of Miraflores. The Circles had been positioned outside of the palace throughout the week during the unrest. Government officials used the hours it took for the march to travel to the palace to call on loyalists to gather at Miraflores. National Assembly Deputy Juan Barreto told loyalists through the media covering the situation, &quot;The call is to Miraflores! Everyone to Miraflores to defend your revolution! Don&#x27;t let them through!&quot; A crowd of government supporters, in close but smaller numbers to the anti-Chavez marchers, quickly arrived from shanty towns. Some government supporters, who began to gather then, were armed with Molotov cocktails, rocks, sticks, chains, baseball bats, and metal pipes, and were ignored by the Venezuelan National Guard stationed to defend Chávez. According to General Rosendo, Defense Minister José Vicente Rangel ordered Freddy Bernal to prepare the Bolivarian Circles to attack the opposition demonstration.
At about 12:00pm, Chávez knew the march was on its way and he called for the implementation of a military plan to occupy key locations in the city. Plan Ávila, as it was known, existed to mobilize an emergency force to protect the palace and prevent a coup. The plan was first used by Carlos Andrés Pérez during the &quot;Caracazo&quot;, resulting in the killings of hundreds and possibly thousands of Venezuelans. This caused discomfort among some in the military, since they knew that Chávez was violating the constitution he helped create by ordering High Command to have the military control civilians.

====Llaguno Overpass events====
By 12:30 pm, thousands of government supporters were gathered around the palace blocking all routes to Miraflores except for the Llaguno Overpass, which was where the Bolivarian Circles had gathered to overlook the route. As the march turned a corner and began to approach the Miraflores at about 2:00 pm, the National Guard fired about twelve tear gas canisters from behind the palace walls and the protesters fled back down the road. The protesters made it closer to Miraflores and the Presidential Guard responded with more tear gas. About 20 gas canisters caused panic and a dispersion of the demonstrators to areas surrounding the palace.

Since other routes were blocked by the National Guard, many marchers began to head down Baralt Avenue in order to reach Miraflores. On Baralt Avenue, near the Llaguno Overpass as the march inched closer hundreds of Chávez supporters gathered and began throwing large rocks, Molotov cocktails and even tear gas at the demonstrators. Upon arrival of the marchers at Miraflores, the opposing sides were initially separated by two forces: the National Guard loyal to Chávez and the Metropolitan Police controlled by former Caracas mayor Alfredo Peña, a former Chávez supporter who had joined the opposition. As marchers and Chavistas clashed, the Metropolitan Police attempted to separate both sides from further confrontation with two trucks with water cannons.

Trying to regain the initiative, Chávez spoke in a lengthy broadcast on the successes of his administration while calling for peace, but the networks decided to split the screen, showing the violence outside the palace, with the audio from the speech appearing disrupted. A few minutes after the speech concluded, gunfire erupted again and the march began to disperse slightly. As the demonstrators marched closer to the Llaguno Overpass, they could see Chavistas heavily armed, some with pistols. Police began to disperse the Chavista gunmen returning fire and few demonstrators began to follow behind them with pings of gunfire heard on the police armored vehicles, though the marchers fled shortly after as the violence grew. According to medical staff at the Vargas Hospital, the first to arrive at the hospital were opposition marchers. According to surgeons, the marchers had been shot in the back with handgun fire while fleeing and others were severely injured from 7.62×51mm NATO military rounds from Fal rifles, standard equipment of the National Guard defending Chávez. Later after police responded to pro-Chávez shooting, Chávez supporters then began being seen injured in the hospitals. As a result of the confrontations, 19 were left dead, most killed between 3:20 pm and 3:55 pm, and over 150 injured.

&quot;The killings at the anti-Chávez demonstration rocked the country&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on 20 April, &quot;reviving memories of the violent events in 1989, known as the Caracazo, in which hundreds were killed by government forces. Venezuelans across the political spectrum swore that such violence would never take place again.&quot;

==Coup==

===Plan Ávila and military insubordination===

Immediately after Chávez finished his broadcast at 5:25pm he changed into his military fatigues and grabbed his rifle and pistol, worrying about rebels entering the palace. Chávez believed that the best way to stay in power was to implement Plan Ávila. However, mobilizing the military to execute the plan was unconstitutional, as only the National Guard was allowed to maintain public order. Since General Rosendo would not comply earlier in the day with Chávez&#x27;s order to implement the plan, Chávez went directly to General Jorge García Carneiro, one of his most trusted generals and ordered him to go through with it. Upon contacting the military base &quot;Fuerte Tiuna&quot; to issue the commands, he was rebuffed and informed that a group of generals at the base intended to arrest Chávez.

Shortly after 6:00pm, word spread at Fort Tiuna that Carneiro was still seeking to implement Plan Ávila. Head of the army General Efraín Vásquez Velasco was meeting at the Army School with other officers concerned about Chávez&#x27;s use of violence when Chávez ordered General Carneiro, one of Vásquez Velasco&#x27;s subordinates, to go ahead with Plan Ávila. Vásquez Velasco, who founded the Office of Human Rights of the Venezuelan Army, knew that if the plan were implemented that he would be blamed since he was the head of the army. Soon after, General Vásquez Velasco learned that General Carneiro did not comply with his orders and was sending about 20 tanks to Miraflores to support Chávez. Vásquez Velasco called the tank commander ordering him to return with the commander complying with the general. General Vásquez Velasco then ordered a nationwide military lockdown with military movements requiring written documentation and approval, a move by Vásquez Velasco that was to prevent troops loyal to Chávez from suppressing the march and would also deter rebellious attacks from the military against Chávez. Vásquez Velasco then ordered the Chávez-loyalist General Carneiro be arrested before he could arrest the other officers under Chávez&#x27;s orders, but Carneiro complied with Vásquez Velasco.

At 6:30, leaders of business and labor pulled their support from Chávez and by 6:45 pm, &quot;Navy Chief of Staff Vice Adm. Hector Ramirez Perez and nine other generals and admirals who had been talking since July about pressuring Chávez into changing his ways decided to rebel and go public&quot;, according to &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;. &quot;Even many military officers who were neutral in their feelings about Chávez were persuaded to turn against the president after Thursday&#x27;s massacre&quot;, &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; later reported. &quot;Soon press conferences flooded the airwaves as dozens of officers, more than 50 in all, denounced the president.&quot;

At around 7:30 pm, Venevisión began broadcasting its version of events that afternoon, showing the Chavistas firing from Puente Llaguno, juxtaposed with footage of dead or wounded protesters, saying that the Chavistas planned an ambush and shot unarmed opposition protestors. This showed General Vásquez Velasco and other generals that Chávez had ordered the Bolivarian Circles to attack opposition marchers. The military officers, including General Raúl Baduel, a founder of Chávez&#x27;s MBR-200, then decided that they had to pull support from Chávez to deter another massacre and shortly after at 8:00 pm, Vásquez Velasco, together with other ranking army officers, declared that Chávez had lost his support. This was followed by heads of the Venezuelan Air Force and Navy, with Chávez then losing power of the military. By 8:30 pm, Luis Miquilena, Chávez&#x27;s mentor and a respected individual among his government being described as &quot;the most important civilian who supported the Chávez government&quot; pulled his support from Chávez stating, &quot;I solemnly declare that it is very difficult that a government of this nature could ever count on the possibility of help on my part ... (the government) had ended up stained in blood&quot;. Following this, Chávez had also lost the support of the legislative and judicials branches who supported Miquilena.

Infuriated by the violence but &quot;reluctant to stage an outright coup&quot;, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a group of military officers who called themselves the &quot;Movement for the Integrity and Dignity of the National Armed Forces&quot; demanded on Thursday evening that Chávez resign. In a statement, they declared that they had no longer had &quot;recognition&quot; of Chávez, whom they accused of &quot;betraying the trust of the people&quot; and held responsible for the deaths of peaceful protesters. The statement was read at a press conference by Vice Adm. Hector Ramirez Perez, chief of staff of the Venezuelan Navy and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and signed by a number of other officers, including 10 senior officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force and National Guard, later described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as occupying &quot;largely administrative posts&quot;. Other signatories included the heads of the paramilitary National Guard and &quot;several midlevel commanders based in the capital&quot;. Perhaps the most prominent member of this group was Gen. Efraín Vásquez, Commander in Chief of the Army, who said, &quot;Mr. President, I was loyal to the end, but today&#x27;s deaths cannot be tolerated.&quot; He also told reporters that no coup had been planned before 11 April but that the massacre had been &quot;too much and we had to move&quot;. Navy Vice Admiral Héctor Rafael Ramírez agreed, saying, &quot;We cannot allow a tyrant to run the Republic of Venezuela.&quot;

At 10:20 pm National Guard general Luis Alberto Camacho Kairuz declared on television that &quot;the government [had] abandoned its functions.&quot; Around this time, Chávez contemplated about committing suicide. Near midnight, Fidel Castro called, and urged him not to kill himself and to turn himself in to the military. José Vicente Rangel later stated that &quot;the call from Fidel was decisive so that there was no self-immolation. It was the determinant factor. His advice allowed us to see better in the darkness.&quot;

===Chávez&#x27;s detention===
In the early hours of 12 April, many demanded Chávez&#x27;s resignation. With the loss of &quot;almost all ... military force on hand in order to resist or move to another place&quot;, Chávez asked for four conditions to resign, including that he be allowed to resign before the National Assembly, with power passing constitutionally to the vice president prior to new elections, he and his family could go to Cuba and that he would be able to address the nation live on television. Vásquez and others would not agree to these conditions and dispatched two generals to arrest Chávez. At 3 a.m., with the coup plotters threatening to bomb the Miraflores palace if Chávez did not resign, Chávez phoned the head of the armed forces, General-in-Chief Lucas Rincón saying that he would do so; Rincón in turn told him that the military leadership was divided on whether to oust him or not. Within twenty minutes Rincón had announced on television that Chávez had been asked for his resignation, and had accepted. Chávez later said that he told Rincón during their telephone call that he would &quot;abandon&quot; the presidency, after which he &quot;left the palace to negotiate the terms under which he would do so&quot;, saying, &quot;I am ready to go, but I demand respect for the constitution.&quot;

At Miraflores, according to &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, Chávez dispatched Rincón, his military chief of staff, to meet with the military officers at Fuerte Tiuna who were calling for him to step down. Rincón called Chávez from Fuerte Tiuna to say that the officers were &quot;fighting among themselves&quot; and insisting on his resignation. As &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; put it, &quot;top military commanders&quot;, unable to countenance &quot;the spectacle of a president making war on his own people&quot;, demanded that Chávez step down. Faced with this demand, Chávez &quot;started working the phones&quot; and also summoned a clergyman, Monsignor Baltazar Porras, to discuss &quot;prayer and forgiveness&quot;, his purpose being &quot;maybe as much to search his soul as to search for a way out of the crisis&quot;. Porras, whom Chávez had once reviled as one of the church&#x27;s &quot;devils in skirts&quot;, said that Chávez had &quot;personally asked me for forgiveness for everything he had said about me&quot;.

General Vásquez ordered several generals to go to Miraflores and arrest Chávez. Meanwhile, according to Newsday, &quot;cabinet members and honor guards sat glumly in the hallway outside ... Chávez&#x27;s suite&quot;, awaiting news. Shortly after midnight, Environment Minister Maria Elisa Osorio said, &quot;The president is being forced to leave. There&#x27;s a coup.&quot; Faced with his officers&#x27; demand, Chávez reportedly refused to resign but agreed to &quot;abandon his functions&quot;, a procedure that is provided for by Venezuelan law but that would need to be ratified by the National Assembly. There followed &quot;hours of negotiations&quot; in which the &quot;key figure&quot; was Armed Forces Commander Gen. Lucas Rincón Romero, who did not make clear at any point during the crisis where his loyalties lay. Early Friday morning, Rincón told the public that Chávez had resigned. An hour and a half later, Carmona was named president of what was meant to be a transitional government.

On Friday morning a &quot;heavily guarded caravan&quot; took Chávez, who was &quot;wearing his trademark fatigues and red beret&quot;, from Miraflores to the army base at Fort Tiuna. At the base, Chávez was forced to take off the uniform and beret and dress in civilian garb. (&quot;The Miami Herald&quot; noted that armed-forces officers had long been irked by his habit of wearing a military uniform during his presidency.). Here he met with representatives of the Roman Catholic Church. &quot;By midmorning on Friday&quot;, reported the &quot;Times&quot;, Chávez &quot;looked to be finished&quot;. The military later maintained, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;that the civil unrest forced them to ask Chávez for his resignation, which he gave verbally, asking to be flown to Cuba&quot;. The Cuban government was trying to arrange for him to go into exile in Cuba. Chávez&#x27;s request to be allowed to go into exile in Cuba was soon rejected, however. Army General Roman Fuemayor said: &quot;He has to be held accountable to his country.&quot; Meanwhile, according to the Miami Herald, &quot;Bernal, Vice President Diosdado Cabello and several other Chávez cabinet members were reported to be trying to win political asylum in foreign embassies, including those of Chile, Cuba, Iraq and Libya.&quot; Police, alert to reports that Chávez supporters in the Caracas slums were distributing weapons, began searching for guns in homes. Meanwhile, Rincón, &quot;in full uniform&quot;, had announced on national television at about 2 a.m. that the president had resigned.

Chávez would be taken to La Orchila, a military base off the coast of Venezuela. He was able to get word out arguing he had resigned via a telephone call to his daughter, who was able to speak first to Fidel Castro and then to Cuban television.

After two young female military prosecutors interviewed Chávez at Fort Tiuna on Friday morning about 11 April massacre. Chávez was later flown in the evening to the naval base of Turiamo, near Puerto Cabello, where he wrote a note stating that he had not resigned.

===Carmona&#x27;s interim presidency===
Businessman Pedro Carmona Estanga, president of Fedecámaras, was installed as interim President after Chávez&#x27;s detention. Carmona, described by &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; as &quot;president for a day&quot; told the newspaper that his acceptance of that position was, in the &quot;Herald&quot; paraphrase, &quot;as a spontaneous act of bravery, not the result of a monthslong conspiracy&quot;. &quot;I was not involved in any conspiracy&quot;, Carmona said. &quot;I cannot accept any conjecture or soap operas. I categorically deny it.&quot;

&quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; said Carmona was &quot;a buttoned-down businessman and economist who has degrees from Caracas&#x27; Andres Bello Catholic University and the University of Brussels&quot; and who &quot;has an international reputation, having represented Venezuelan commercial and diplomatic missions abroad&quot;. Describing Carmona as &quot;a bookish economist&quot; who had worked with the Foreign Ministry and &quot;run a variety of trade associations&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that one reason he was chosen as interim president &quot;was that he was one of the few people who didn&#x27;t want the job&quot;. One condition imposed by the coup-makers was that the interim president would not be able to run for president in elections several months later, and those who really wanted the long-term position therefore took themselves out of the running for the interim post. Invited to be president by those who had deposed Chávez, Carmona had become nationally prominent as the leading figure in the previous December&#x27;s general strike. &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; reported that even Chávez had described Carmona as &quot;straightforward and low-key – until schemers manipulated him&quot;.

According to Venezuelan political analysts, Carmona was always a &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;conciliatory&quot; figure, but in the years before the 2002 coup he &quot;became more aggressive as Chávez did&quot;. Margarita López Maya of the University of Central Venezuela said that as Carmona rose through the ranks of Fedecámaras, &quot;he became more aggravated, a situation which got worse because the government was provoking everyone&quot;. Upon Carmona&#x27;s taking office, Juan Calvo, a Venezuelan businessman, said, &quot;He always surrounds himself with capable people, and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s what he will do now.&quot; Upon being sworn in, Carmona told supporters that &quot;We must go about returning to the rule of law ... Strongman rule will be left behind. I will act in the most open manner, working with all sectors of the country.&quot; He also said that he required plenty of support &quot;to obtain the conditions required to rebuild confidence in the country and improve its international image&quot;. In addition, he vowed that &quot;justice would be done&quot; for the survivors of those who had been massacred. Shortly after police confiscated scores of weapons from several Bolivarian Circles, including from a group at the Ministries of Health and Environment that was near Miraflores.

One of the immediate changes Carmona made after his inauguration was to change his country&#x27;s official name back to the Republic of Venezuela from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the name established by the 1999 Constitution. News of this change was greeted with loud cheers from coup supporters at Miraflores. Edgar Paredes, interim head of Petróleos de Venezuela, announced that Venezuela would no longer be selling oil to Cuba. Moreover, Carmona&#x27;s government repealed the 49 laws passed the previous November that business leaders considered damaging to the economy. Meanwhile, pro-Chávez officers in the military were being removed from their positions or assigned to remote locations.

Carmona then issued a decree, which came to be known as the Carmona Decree, dissolving the National Assembly and Supreme Court that were filled with Chávez supporters, and voiding the 1999 Constitution. The decree declared that parliamentary elections would take place in December 2002, that new general national elections would take place within a year of the decree&#x27;s declaration, and that this would draft a general reform of the 1999 constitution. The decree also suspended the attorney general, controller general, state governors and all mayors elected during Chávez&#x27;s administration. He also suspended the power of other branches of government and dismissed Chávez appointees while forming a new council, most of whose 25 members were Chávez opponents. As one academic and Chávez supporter. Carmona also reinstalled Guaicaipuro Lameda as head of PDVSA. PDVSA management swiftly announced the end of oil exports to Cuba, and declared that it would step up production

The removal of such officials was controversial, with one member of the opposition coalition stating that &quot;In hindsight, it was the most idiotic thing that could have been done, (...) but we had just come out of an ambush and we were venting our distaste for the people who occupied those positions, so everyone applauded the dissolution.&quot; &quot;The way the provisional government abandoned the constitution produced a very strong reaction – it was a big mistake&quot; said Congressman Felipe Mujica, member of a socialist party that had broken with Chávez but been excluded from the new government. &quot;That, and the way they were pursuing his political allies, arresting them, created the impression that this was not the right way.&quot; Such actions fragmented the broad opposition coalition which had supported the coup, with many viewing it as &quot;the triumph of a small oligarchic elite&quot;. &quot;Carmona was really placed in a trap&quot; Anibal Romero, a Venezuelan political science professor, told &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;. &quot;He couldn&#x27;t leave the National Assembly in power and govern the country, because it was full of Chávez supporters. But if he dissolved it, he would be declared anti-democratic.&quot; Another mistake was that, although he had spent months working closely with labour leader Carlos Ortega, he appointed no labor leaders to his cabinet.

Carmona&#x27;s appointment to cabinet positions of members of Opus Dei, the Catholic organization, and of members of what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;a discredited conservative party&quot; concerned many democratic members of the opposition coalition, and made many of them feel &quot;they were being aced out of power by Carmona&quot; reported the &quot;Times&quot;. The military members of the coalition were also displeased that Carmona did not consult them on military appointments. Carmona also named two naval officers, but no army officers, to the cabinet, bypassing Vásquez and instead naming Adm. Hector Ramirez Perez as minister of defense. &quot;The army would never accept a navy officer in that job&quot; Ret. Vice Adm. Mario Ivan Carratu later said. &quot;It has always been that way.&quot; When he named Gen. Rafael Damina Bustillo to be head of the National Guard, Gen. Vásquez insisted angrily: &quot;The officers who are with me ... will remain here.&quot; By midday Saturday, as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; later reported, &quot;key military leaders were growing concerned&quot; about many of Carmona&#x27;s actions, unconstitutional and otherwise. &quot;[I]n style and substance&quot;, the &quot;Post&quot; noted, &quot;the new government quickly alienated civil groups and key elements of the armed forces, which are proud of a history of support for Venezuelan democracy.&quot;

It was also reported that there was considerable competition within the coalition. &quot;There were many more people with aspirations than space to accommodate them, and they all seemed ready to jump ship when they felt they were being excluded&quot; said Janet Kelly, a Venezuelan political commentator. Columnist Patricia Poleo of the Caracas newspaper &quot;El Nuevo Pais&quot; joined several government officials when she later suggested that during Carmona&#x27;s tenure, Isaac Perez Recao, a member of a family that owned a controlling stake in a firm called Venoco, a subsidiary of which Carmona ran, had allegedly been a key financier of the coup and had been pulling strings behind the scenes. &quot;He immediately surrounded himself with people who invoked fear in Venezuela&quot; complained one official about Cormona. &quot;Obviously, this coup was very poorly coordinated. It caught the democratic opposition by surprise.&quot; &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; reported that &quot;moderate politicians complained that Carmona, a centrist businessman, had been &#x27;hijacked&#x27; by rightists&quot;.

Speaking afterward about his one-day presidency, Carmona told &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; that he had been &quot;misunderstood because ... the opposition wasted too much time forming a cabinet and naming the high military command&quot;, whereas if the coup had &quot;been hatched in advance, those key decisions would have already been made&quot;. He regretted not stressing his plan to appoint &quot;a 35-member representative council to help him run the nation&quot; and to hold assembly elections in 90 days and a presidential election (in which he would not run) in December. He said he had suspended the assembly &quot;because the new government would never have accomplished its goals with a congress so stacked to favor one party&quot;. &quot;There was no rebellion or coup&quot; Carmona told &quot;The New York Times&quot; after the counter-coup. &quot;There was simply a vacuum of power that came about after the military announced the resignation of the president.&quot; Carmona said he had accepted the interim presidency because he was told by military officers that Chávez had resigned. &quot;I was called by them to fill that role&quot;, he said. &quot;I was called by officers and others to take over. And I had the courage to take that step.&quot; He told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he took &quot;full responsibility&quot; for the actions he made, emphasizing that &quot;there was no premeditation, no conspiracy&quot; behind the coup and his elevation to the presidency. He said that after the 11 April march on Miraflores, he had been phoned by someone (whom he would not name) who said that Chávez had quit and offered him the presidency. &quot;Everything happened so fast that mistakes were made&quot;, Carmona said. &quot;If I could go back in time, I would have had a triumvirate, the power would have been shared – but everything was so quick.&quot; When asked if he had been &quot;used by the military&quot;, he replied: &quot;There might have been people who used me, you never know what is going on underground&quot;, but he insisted that he &quot;acted purely in the higher interests of the country&quot;. One Western diplomat told &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; that during Carmona&#x27;s brief presidency &quot;everybody was saying what a great guy he was, professional, straight, ethical&quot; but that after his ouster &quot;everyone is pointing fingers at him for being a dope&quot;. Carmona himself told the Herald that he would remain a &quot;civic activist&quot; but would leave politics: &quot;I have never been a politician; that is not my world&quot;, Carmona said. &quot;As for Venezuela, we will continue the struggle.&quot;

In addition to Carmona&#x27;s errors, his coalition partners made several missteps. The first was to refuse to let Chávez leave the country, as he asked, and in return for which he promised, on Thursday, to officially resign. This request was not honored because hard-line members of the coalition wanted to prosecute Chávez for the killings outside Miraflores. It was Chávez&#x27;s refusal to resign that ultimately split the opposition coalition. Also, the coup-makers were criticized for raiding the homes of some Chávez supporters, including Tarek William Saab, chairman of the congressional Foreign Relations Committee, and Ramón Rodríguez Chacín, Minister of the Interior and Justice.

===Pro-Chávez protests and restoration===

Prompted by the spreading news that Chávez had not resigned, Carmona&#x27;s installation as president generated protests by Bolivarian Circles in support of Chávez that was suppressed by the Metropolitan Police. Baduel contacted the head of the Presidential Guard, which remained loyal to Chávez, and told him &quot;it&#x27;s now or never&quot;. Late in the morning of 13 April the Presidential Guard entered the palace from their barracks via tunnels, and retook the palace. Since Chávez was being held in a secret location, the presidency was assumed for several hours by Vice President Diosdado Cabello until Chávez was reinstated.

===Media role===
With the increasing disapproval of Chávez in 2001 and constant confrontations with him, the Venezuelan media, which initially approved and supported Chávez, turned against him, which then accelerated his loss of popularity. The constantly growing interruptions Chávez&#x27;s government made on television with their &quot;cadenas&quot; that they saw as &quot;an overt attempt to block the independent news coverage of the strike&quot;, media organizations agreed on 9 April to create a split screen effect for &quot;cadenas&quot; that did not involve the president, only allowing full coverage for the president out of courtesy for him. A few hours after the meeting, the first split screen &quot;cadena&quot; coverage occurred while covering a speech by the labor minister. The media organizations also felt pressure from the government since DISIP and National Guard units were seen and posted near their communication towers, planning to cut transmissions of the media.

At a 10 April meeting involving media representatives, Vice President Diosdado Cabello and Minister of Defense Rangel, the Venezuelan government blamed the media for the anti-government demonstrations, with Cabello stating the media would be &quot;responsible for the blood that will be shed&quot;; Globovisión&#x27;s president rejected this, saying the Venezuelan government had called on Chávez supporters to confront opposition marches near Miraflores. The use of the split screen for the &quot;cadena&quot; had also been criticized by Rangel though the media owners said that the effect would continue to be implemented.

At the beginning of the coup, Venezolana de Televisión (VTV), the state television channel, had its workers leave in droves, fearing for their lives since they believed they were targets like in the bloody takeover during the 1992 coup led by Chávez.

At 3:45 pm Chávez called for another &quot;cadena&quot;, though it was possibly prerecorded in order to distract Venezuelans since government officials reported that Chávez was speaking to them during the broadcast. Chávez spoke for ninety minutes on the successes of his administration and calling for peace. With the networks concerned that history was in the making and that Chávez was attempting to block a government massacre, half an hour into the &quot;cadena&quot; the networks decided to split the screen again, showing the violence outside the palace, with the audio from the &quot;cadena&quot; appearing disrupted. The video also appeared pre-recorded when Chávez called for the networks to be disconnected due to actions performed on 9 April and not the present day. Shortly after Chávez ordered the networks taken off the air, they were disconnected. However, a single engineer tricked DISIP and National Guard members into thinking he cut all transmission, though the networks continued to broadcast via satellite to cable, satellite and through other outlets.

Private television stations shared a video of pro-government &quot;chavistas&quot; reportedly firing at protesters. Although who was responsible for the deaths remains unclear (see below), the media aired the footage.

On 13 April, the media met with Carmona at Miraflores and denounced his decision to dissolve the National Assembly and arrest supporters of Chávez. Such opposition to Carmona&#x27;s moves resulted in his Minister of Defense, Admiral Hector Ramirez Perez, stating that the media was &quot;opposed&quot; to Carmona&#x27;s interim government. Carmona&#x27;s minister of defense also called on the media to stop reporting the violence so it would not provoke more violent actions. The head of Globovisión reportedly called to CNN in Atlanta &quot;to request the U.S. network join the blackout.&quot; Venezuelan television media failed to broadcast news of Chávez supporters retaking of the Miraflores palace; the four major television networks stopped providing news reports altogether. The &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; reported that &quot;RCTV was showing Walt Disney cartoons. Venevisión ran a daylong marathon of Hollywood movies: Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil, Nell and Pretty Woman. Another station, Televen, told its viewers &#x27;to stay indoors,&#x27; treating them to baseball and soap operas. Globovisión, the country&#x27;s top 24-hour news station and CNN affiliate, spent much of the day rebroadcasting upbeat footage of Chávez&#x27;s ouster. An announcer repeatedly cautioned viewers, &#x27;We are living in times of political change&#x27;&quot; while also urging viewers to remain &quot;prudent&quot; and not to spread &quot;false alarms&quot; or &quot;rumors&quot;. According to the media, such actions were performed for safety reasons since there were threats against the media organizations. Two of the three major newspapers &quot;El Universal&quot; and &quot;El Nacional&quot; cancelled their Sunday editions, for safety reasons. The third major newspaper, &quot;Últimas Noticias&quot;, printed a limited Sunday edition accurately reflecting events; some tabloids and regional television stations also covered the news. Chávez supporters on 13 April were also creating an intimidating atmosphere, attacking the offices of RCTV, breaking windows and shouting &quot;The palace is in our hands, why aren&#x27;t you showing that?&quot;. By 8 o&#x27;clock on 13 April, the reinstalled government informed the people of the situation, via state television channels. On 18 April, Globovisión president Alberto Ravell &quot;asked for forgiveness &#x27;from any viewer who feels we failed them that day&#x27;&quot;, further stating that &quot;Sacrificing our credibility (...) and freedom of expression, we decided not to broadcast images of violence and looting.&quot;

==Aftermath==

By the time the Organization of American States&#x27; (OAS) Permanent Council met on 13 April, the coup was effectively over, and on 14 April the United States joined with other OAS members in condemning the coup and sending the OAS Secretary General on a fact-finding and diplomatic mission. The OAS subsequently established a &quot;mesa&quot; dialogue process, as it had in Peru following the May 2000 elections. At Chávez&#x27;s request, the Carter Center and UNDP were also involved. In order to facilitate participation in this process, the opposition created the Coordinadora Democrática (CD). The CD helped organize the general strike of 2002–03 later. After the February 2003 end of the strike, the CD engaged further in the mesa process and pushed for a binding recall referendum, which was ultimately agreed on 23 May 2003. Ultimately the CD rejected the outcome of the 2004 recall referendum, which announced that Chávez would not be recalled, alleging fraud.

On January 15, 2004, during a speech before the National Assembly, Chávez would afterwards admit that he deliberately provoked a crisis with this actions, declaring that &quot;what happened with PDVSA was necessary&quot; and &quot;when I grabbed the whistle in an Aló Presidente and started to fire people, I was provoking the crisis&quot;.

===Reactions===

====Domestic====
Early on the morning after the coup, opponents of Chávez filled the streets of Caracas, &quot;honking horns and waving the gold, blue and red of the Venezuelan flag&quot;, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. A headline in &quot;El Universal&quot; read &quot;It&#x27;s over!&quot; Oscar Garcia Mendoza, president of the major Banco Venezolano de Crédito, ran a &quot;gigantic newspaper ad&quot; celebrating Chávez&#x27;s ouster, which, he wrote, would &quot;substantially improve Venezuelan society&quot;. &quot;This is the day that Venezuelans have been waiting for&quot;, said Luis Vicente Leon, head of a Caracas polling firm. &quot;The situation in Venezuela has changed overnight, not only politically but also economically.&quot; About 500 protesters gathered outside the Cuban embassy in Caracas demanding an end to diplomatic relations. Protesters cut the mission&#x27;s utility cables, slashed tires, and smashed the windshields of three cars with diplomatic plates. Although the Cuban ambassador told a Venezuelan official that he was not sheltering any Venezuelans, he would not allow the building to be searched.

====International====
A Rio Group meeting of Latin American governments in Costa Rica taking place soon after the coup adopted a resolution condemning the &quot;interruption of constitutional order in Venezuela&quot;, and requesting a meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS); only Francisco Flores of El Salvador said that he would recognise the Carmona government.

The United States government blamed the events on the actions of the Chávez government and said Chávez had resigned the presidency, dismissed his cabinet, and that security forces under his command had fired upon unarmed protesters. Upon news of Chávez&#x27;s return, Condoleezza Rice, National Security Advisor to US President George W. Bush, said, &quot;We do hope that Chávez recognizes that the whole world is watching and that he takes advantage of this opportunity to right his own ship, which has been moving, frankly, in the wrong direction for quite a long time.&quot; Bush denied any involvement of the US government in the coup attempt and asked Chávez to &quot;learn a lesson&quot; from it.

Cuban president Fidel Castro later confirmed that after the coup his government had &quot;contacted the ambassadors of 21 countries in an attempt to get a plane to Venezuela to rescue Chávez.&quot;

In Chile, newspapers circulated information soon after the coup attempt showing the Chilean government&#x27;s &quot;discomfort&quot; with Chávez returning to power, with President Ricardo Lagos holding Chávez accountable for the political crisis in Venezuela. President Lagos later clarified that his statements were to tell Venezuela to avoid polarization and the Chile opposes the &quot;interruption of institutional order&quot;.

====Organizations====
Don McKay of the Canadian Foundation of the Americas was troubled by the coup, saying: &quot;This is the first time in a decade the military has stepped into power in Latin America. It is very troubling. ... This will be a test case to see whether the OAS&#x27;s democracy clause has any teeth.&quot; Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Felipe Pérez Roque said that in the eyes of his country Chávez was still president, and Cuba&#x27;s Communist Party daily, &quot;Granma&quot;, wrote that Chávez had been &quot;overthrown in a conspiracy by the country&#x27;s wealthy classes, corrupt politicians and the news media&quot;.

On 13 April, the editors of &quot;The New York Times&quot; applauded what they described as Chávez&#x27;s resignation, calling him a &quot;ruinous demagogue&quot; and cheering the fact that &quot;Venezuelan democracy [was] no longer threatened by a would-be dictator&quot;. The Times editors also wrote admiringly of the installation of Carmona as president, describing him as a &quot;respected business leader&quot;. Furthermore, the &quot;Times&quot; congratulated the U.S. government for its wisdom in &quot;never [having] publicly demonized Mr. Chávez, denying him the role of nationalist martyr&quot;, and in staying out of the coup, which the &quot;Times&quot; characterized as &quot;a purely Venezuelan affair&quot;.

=== US role and alleged involvement ===
President Chávez asserted numerous times that United States government officials knew about plans for a coup, approved of them, and assumed they would be successful, alleging that &quot;two military officers from the United States&quot; were present in the headquarters of coup plotters. Rear Admiral Carlos Molina, a central leader of the coup, later said that &quot;We felt we were acting with US support (...) we agree that we can&#x27;t permit a communist government here. The US has not let us down yet.&quot; However, the United States repeatedly informed the Venezuelan opposition that they would not be supported if there were a coup, and following the coup attempt, President George W. Bush denied any U.S. involvement.

On 27 April 2002, Chairman Cass Ballenger and Congressman Bill Delahunt of the United States also met with Venezuelan media heads of Venevisión, Globovisión, Unión Radio, &quot;El Nacional&quot;, &quot;Últimas Noticias&quot; and &quot;El Mundo&quot;, telling them that &quot;the U.S. was opposed to any disruption of constitutional government and would condemn any coup, open or disguised, aimed at ousting Chávez&quot;. At a meeting soon after the coup between Ambassador Shapiro and then Venezuelan Vice President José Vicente Rangel at the Vice President&#x27;s home, Rangel also stated to Shapiro that &quot;no one in the upper echelons of the Venezuelan government really believed that the United States was involved in the attempted overthrow&quot; and that if the Venezuelan government did believe so, &quot;the two men wouldn&#x27;t have been sitting in Rangel&#x27;s house&quot;. However, unlike much of Latin America, the US refused to condemn the coup, changing its position only after Carmona resigned.

Unnamed Organisation of American States officials and other diplomatic sources told &quot;The Observer&quot; that the coup was &quot;tied to senior officials in the US government&quot; and that the US was not only aware of the coup, but also gave sanction to its organizers. The paper names Elliot Abrams, who had been convicted of deceiving Congress during the Iran Contra Affair, as having greenlit the coup.

Bush administration officials acknowledged meeting with some opposition leaders in the several weeks prior to 11 April but have strongly denied encouraging the coup itself, saying that they insisted on constitutional means. However, the purpose of the meetings was not clarified, and it is also not known why US officials and the Venezuelan opposition broached the subject of a coup months before the attempted ousting took place. In addition, &quot;The New York Times&quot; quotes an anonymous Defense Department official in charge of developing policy towards Venezuela as saying that, &quot;We were not discouraging people. ... We were sending informal, subtle signals that we don&#x27;t like this guy. We didn&#x27;t say, &#x27;No, don&#x27;t you dare, though he denied the Defense Department offered material help, such as weaponry.

Because of the allegations, an investigation conducted by the US inspector general, at the request of US Senator Christopher Dodd, requested a review of American activities leading up to and during the coup attempt. The OIG report found no &quot;wrongdoing&quot; by US officials either in the State Department or in the embassy, and concluded that &quot;While it is clear that NED&#x27;s, DOD&#x27;s, and other U.S. assistance programs provided training, institution building, and other support to organizations and individuals understood to be actively involved in the events of 11–14 April, we found no evidence that this support directly contributed, or was intended to contribute, to those events. NED is, however, mindful of the fact that, in some circumstances, its efforts to assist specific organizations, or foster open elections, could be perceived as partisan.&quot;

===Responsibility for violence===
The majority of the violence that took place on 11 April 2002 was near the Llaguno Overpass. There is no consensus as to who was responsible for the deaths on that day, and this remains a very controversial issue. The opposition version of events puts the blame on Chávez, or at least on his supporters. Many groups of the Bolivarian Circles gathered near the Llaguno Overpass before the march reached the area. A &quot;Venevisión&quot; camera positioned on a rooftop that afternoon captured images of people using handguns to shoot from the pro-Chávez counter-march being held on the Llaguno Overpass, an overpass that crosses one of central Caracas&#x27;s busiest avenues. A number of high-ranking military officers, led by Vice Admiral Héctor Ramírez, recorded a video message broadcast later in the day that held Chávez responsible for massacring innocent people using snipers, referring to at least six dead and dozens wounded. CNN correspondent Otto Neustald Neustald claimed the message was recorded at least two hours before the killings started. However, this claim has never been proven and is contested by the rest of the reporters present, such as Javier Ignacio Mayorca, Mayela León and Adrián Criscaut, who affirmed that the military officers were informed of the death of Tortoza during the filming of the message.

Several witnesses reported seeing people shooting from two specific locations: the Ausonia Hotel and the Eden Hotel. The head of the Casa Militar at the time, the guard of the president of Venezuela, Colonel Almidien Ramon Moreno Acosta, states in a report presented on May 15, 2002, before the National Assembly that ten suspects were detained on April 11 under the accusation of being snipers. Three of them were captured by a group of unidentified citizens and handed over to &quot;Casa Militar&quot;. There were no reports as to whether any firearms were seized from them. The remaining seven were captured directly by officers of the Guardia de Honor, the &quot;Casa Militar&quot;.

The seven individuals were fully identified because they had registered with their real names at the Ausonia Hotel. Only one of them was carrying an unfired .38 caliber weapon. On April 12 they were handed over to the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office and tried in court, but were released because there was insufficient evidence to charge them. The revolver had not been fired and no traces were found on any part of the detainees&#x27; bodies or clothing.

The La Nacional building housed the offices of pro-Chávez mayor Freddy Bernal. Bernal, a Chávez supporter and former leader of an elite police force, was accused by a Venezuelan military officer of complying with orders from the Defense Ministry to shoot opposition demonstrators. It was also reported that the National Guard, which was firing tear gas and combatting the opposition protesters, did not pay any attention to the gunmen on the La Nacional building and that it was the Metropolitan Police who had attempted to go to the building. Bernal dismissed the allegations as &quot;totally false&quot;.

The 2003 documentary titled &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot; contradicts claims by private media in Venezuela that the pro-Chávez group was firing on the opposition protest from Llaguno Bridge. In the documentary, footage captured from another angle by an amateur cameraman shows pro-Chávez gunmen firing over an empty street with no apparent opposition protesters below. Further, the film makers claim that the opposition march never went down that street. This documentary has been criticized by another called &quot;X-Ray of a Lie&quot; and American academic Brian Nelson, who argue that the footage is manipulated and obscures Metropolitan Police on the street below.

The 2004 documentary &quot;Puente Llaguno: Claves de una Masacre&quot; claimed that the Chavistas on the bridge did not begin shooting until 4:38 pm, by which time most of the opposition deaths had already occurred. Nelson responds that such claims are false by showing that opposition demonstrator Jesús Arellano was killed just before 2:30 pm, with photos showing Chavistas further up the street brandishing firearms and closer than purported by the earlier sources.

Within the next 15 minutes, two other opposition demonstrators were shot at 2:45 and 4:30 pm, the Metropolitan Police responded to the Chavista gunfire by going between the marchers and the Chavistas. The Chavistas responded to the Metropolitan Police by moving further up the street and at around 4:35 pm, began firing down from Llaguno Bridge onto Baralt Avenue below. Police responded to the Chavista gunfire, with one Chavista who was lying on the bridge being shot in the face, with his body positioning of lying down and facing the Metropolitan Police below possibly resulting in the headshot. Ricochets were also possible from Chavistas ranks firing through the spokes of the railing on the bridge. After 5:30 pm when most of the gunfire concluded, the filmmakers of &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot; used manipulated footage in order to show an empty Baralt Avenue that Chavistas were overlooking. A vehicle used by the Metropolitan Police later showed that approximately 600 bullets impacted the vehicle&#x27;s side that was facing north toward the Puente Llaguno bridge.

==== Scene cleanup ====
After 11 April, the Baralt Avenue was closed as a crime scene and remained closed while Carmona was in power. However, upon Chávez&#x27;s return on 14 April, cleaning crews under the orders of Freddy Bernal, mayor of the Libertador Municipality and leader of the Bolivarian Circles, began to fix the damages in the street. The crews swiftly repaired the traffic lights, restored the kiosks, painted the walls, covered the splinters in the cement surfaces and replaced the damaged street lamps free of charge. Workers removed bullets from the walls and scoured the drains for shell casings as well. Within five days, all physical evidence at the site had been collected and destroyed, and on April 20 the avenue was reopened. The Chávez government proceeded to transfer detectives and prosecutors who opened investigations and replace them with more submissive supporters.

====Criminal investigation====
The people filmed shooting from the Puente Llaguno bridge were initially identified as being pro-Chávez political activists Rafael Cabrices, , Henry Atencio, and Nicolás Rivera. They were captured by the police and jailed for one year as they awaited trial, but charges were dropped before the trial began. Rafael Cabrices died from a heart attack three years later, in August 2005. Henry Atencio died fifteen years later, in May 2017.

Under the 1999 Constitution, military officers are entitled to a pre-trial hearing before the Plenary of the Supreme Court of Justice to rule on whether they should be charged with a crime. In such a hearing on 14 August 2002, the Tribunal ruled by an 11–9 margin (with two justices recused) that four high-ranking military officers charged with rebellion should not stand trial, arguing that what took place was not a &quot;coup&quot; but a &quot;vacuum of power&quot; that had been generated by the announcement of Chávez&#x27;s resignation made by General Lucas Rincón Romero.

After Chávez took over of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice and filled it with his supporters, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, however, ruled on 12 March 2004 that the recusals were unconstitutional, making the hearing invalid, which meant that the military officers, by then retired should stand trial.

After a trial that had begun back in March 2006, in April 2009, the ten Metropolitan Police officers were convicted of crimes leading to the deaths of three demonstrators back on 11 April 2002. Six of them, charged with homicide, were sentenced to 30 years each in prison, while one officer was found acquitted. Former president of the Venezuelan Supreme Tribunal of Justice, , who fled Venezuela in 2012 after the Venezuelan government accused him of alleged ties to drug trafficking and removed him from his post, told U.S. authorities that he was personally ordered by President Chávez to use the full weight of the court to condemn the officers.

On 18 November 2004, a leading state prosecutor Danilo Anderson was assassinated shortly before he was scheduled to bring charges against individuals for their alleged participation in the coup. The Venezuelan government claimed individuals from Florida planned the assassination, though other reports suggested that Anderson and others were involved in an extortion racket. Carmona was arrested on 16 April and later placed under house arrest. He would later request political asylum to the Colombian embassy in Caracas. Carmona and several other participants went into exile.

In December 2007, Chávez issued a pardon covering more than 60 people who had drafted or signed the Carmona Decree.

===Media===

====Analysis====
Before the coup, the relationship between Chávez&#x27;s government and the media were in dispute over press freedom, with the Venezuelan government threatening to revoke licenses of media organizations. Venezuelan media officials stated that the majority of the media supported Chávez and the change he promised when originally elected in 1998, but after they reported the &quot;negative realities&quot; occurring in Venezuela, the Venezuelan government began to portray the media as an enemy. After Chávez removed many of the traditional political elements that were barriers to his power, the Venezuelan media, like other forms of media in Latin America, began to criticize the government.

In 2001 and 2002, relations between the media and Chávez deteriorated quickly. The Chávez-controlled Supreme Court ruled in June 2001 that the media could be held accountable for &quot;half-truths&quot;, a ruling which Chávez used to threaten media organizations by saying he would be revoking their licenses. As conformations began to grow, both parties became more biased, with media owners down to reporters feeling threatened with Chávez even calling out individual journalists by name in speeches. By January 2002, Chávez supporters were attacking independent reporters, with the headquarters of &quot;El Universal&quot; assaulted by hundreds of Chavistas, Globovisión reporters attacked while they were attempting to record Aló Presidente and a bomb attack on newspaper Así Es la Noticia. As a result of being &quot;besieged&quot; by Chávez, the media lost its perspective and began to increase its political involvement assisting the opposition.

According to &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot;, mainstream Venezuelan media outlets such as &quot;El Universal&quot;, &quot;El Nacional&quot;, &quot;El Nuevo País&quot;, Globovisión, Televen, CMT and RCTV supported the coup and anti-government demonstrations, accusing the media of only disseminating the anti-Chávez point of view in the news reports of international media agencies and organizations. Following the coup attempt, the Venezuelan media was blamed as being a major contributor to the unrest in Venezuela with one &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; article, supporting the statements by &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot; about the media&#x27;s involvement, stating, &quot;Never in the history of Latin America had the media played quite so prominent a role in facilitating the overthrow of a democratically elected government,&quot; noting that &quot;the majority of private outlets in Venezuela were owned by wealthy families with an interest in ousting Chávez.&quot; Senior Research Fellow for the leftist thinktank Council on Hemispheric Affairs Such allegations of Venezuelan media owners&#x27; active involvement in the coup has never been proven, but the media&#x27;s actions in supporting the anti-Chávez movements hurt its credibility in the future.

Media outlets denied allegations of any political bias or involvement, stating that coverage was impeded by the confusion of the coup. This included the confusion from rumors such as &quot;Chávez had resigned, been arrested, was fleeing to Cuba, that the military had revolted, that the military high command had resigned&quot; as well as the violent targeting of media personnel that left six cameramen shot, with one of those mortally wounded. Media outlets that both opposed and supported Chávez reported difficulties in reporting due to the potential danger their reporters faced, stating that journalists were afraid to cover pro-Chávez demonstrations since the media was targeted. Venevison reported that only 5 of 18 reporters went out to cover events during the coup while a newspaper considered pro-Chávez stated that they had to remove their logo from cars so they would not be attacked by Chávez supporters. It was also reported that the Chávez supporting Bolivarian Circles surrounded media buildings which prevented their reporters from leaving the area. According to a declassified document from the United States State Department, then-Congressmen Cass Ballenger and William Delahunt met with five media outlet owners and presidents following the coup attempt to encourage the media &quot;to contribute to a climate that would make possible the dialogue and reconciliation that President Chávez has called for.&quot; The media owners and presidents, who admitted there may have been mistakes during the coup attempt, said &quot;the media is democratic&quot; and was opposed to any coup. The media officials also stated that they were attempting to give Chávez a second chance but remained skeptical, noting his 14 April speeches after returning to power where he admitted errors and asked for forgiveness, but later gave a &quot;fiery speech&quot; where he said to his supporters that those responsible for the coup attempt, including the media, &quot;must pay&quot;.

====Media changes====

Chávez said after his reinstatement as president, &quot;This coup d&#x27;etat would not have been possible without the help of the news media, especially television&quot;, and began a campaign to establish a &quot;media hegemony&quot; to prevent similar media conduct from happening in the future. To do so, Chávez used a &quot;two-pronged strategy&quot; in which his government strengthened its own media and &quot;closed, browbeaten or infiltrated almost every independent outlet&quot;. In 2004, the Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television was passed, allowing the government to censor media in order to &quot;promote social justice and further the development of the citizenry, democracy, peace, human rights, education, culture, public health, and the nation&#x27;s social and economic development&quot;. The law, which was extended to the Internet and social media in 2010, requires media companies to &quot;establish mechanisms to restrict, without delay, the dissemination of messages.&quot; Violators can be fined up to US$3,000 or 10 percent of one&#x27;s yearly income, or face suspension of service, while journalists can be arrested with vague charges, including &quot;conspiracy against the state&quot; for criticizing the government. In 2007, Chávez announced the shutdown of television broadcaster RCTV, and other stations began toning down dissent to avoid a similar end. In 2009, 34 radio stations were closed for &quot;technical and administrative reasons&quot;. By the time of Chávez&#x27;s death in 2013, he left a transformed media atmosphere in Venezuela with the media organizations that opposed him being silenced and an expanding state media as a result. Media workers face legal barriers, defamation lawsuits from Venezuelan officials or are targets of violence.

== Documentary films ==
&quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot;, also known as &quot;Chávez: Inside the Coup&quot;, is a 2003 documentary Irish production which focuses on events in Venezuela leading up to and during the April 2002 coup d&#x27;état attempt, which saw Chávez removed from office for several days. The film focuses on Venezuela&#x27;s private media and examines multiple incidents, including the opposition&#x27;s formation of an interim government, headed by Pedro Carmona; and the Carmona administration&#x27;s collapse.

A mockumentary made by German Venezuelan citizens Wolfgang Schalk and , opponents of the rise to power of indigenous people in Venezuela, &quot;X-Ray of a Lie&quot;, claims that there are omissions and distortions in &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot;.

<text>An orangery or orangerie is a room or dedicated building, historically where orange and other fruit trees are protected during the winter, as a large form of greenhouse or conservatory. In the modern day an orangery could refer to either a conservatory or greenhouse built to house fruit trees, or a conservatory or greenhouse meant for another purpose.

The orangery provided a luxurious extension of the normal range and season of woody plants, extending the protection which had long been afforded by the warmth offered from a masonry fruit wall. During the 17th century, fruits like orange, pomegranate, and bananas arrived in huge quantities to European ports. Since these plants were not adapted to the harsh European winters, orangeries were invented to protect and sustain them. The high cost of glass made orangeries a status symbol showing wealth and luxury. Gradually, due to technological advancements, orangeries became more of a classic architectural structure that enhanced the beauty of an estate garden, rather than a room used for wintering plants.

The orangery originated from the Renaissance gardens of Italy, when glass-making technology enabled sufficient expanses of clear glass to be produced. In the north, the Dutch led the way in developing expanses of window glass in orangeries, although the engravings illustrating Dutch manuals showed solid roofs, whether beamed or vaulted, and in providing stove heat rather than open fires. This soon created a situation where orangeries became symbols of status among the wealthy. The glazed roof, which afforded sunlight to plants that were not dormant, was a development of the early 19th century. The orangery at Dyrham Park, Gloucestershire, which had been provided with a slate roof as originally built about 1702, was given a glazed one about a hundred years later, after Humphrey Repton remarked that it was dark; although it was built to shelter oranges, it has always simply been called the &quot;greenhouse&quot; in modern times.
The 1617 &quot;Orangerie&quot; (now Musée de l&#x27;Orangerie) at the Palace of the Louvre inspired imitations that culminated in Europe&#x27;s largest orangery, the Versailles Orangerie. Designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart for Louis XIV&#x27;s 3,000 orange trees at Versailles, its dimensions of were not eclipsed until the development of the modern greenhouse in the 1840s, and were quickly overshadowed by the glass architecture of Joseph Paxton, the designer of the 1851 Crystal Palace. His &quot;great conservatory&quot; at Chatsworth House was an orangery and glass house of monumental proportions.

The orangery, however, was not just a greenhouse but a symbol of prestige and wealth and a garden feature, in the same way as a summerhouse, folly, or &quot;Grecian temple&quot;. Owners would conduct their guests there on tours of the garden to admire not only the fruits within but also the architecture outside. Often the orangery would contain fountains, grottos, and an area in which to entertain in inclement weather.

==Earliest examples==

As early as 1545, an orangery was built in Padua, Italy. The first orangeries were practical and not as ornamental as they later became. Most had no heating other than open fires.

In England, John Parkinson introduced the orangery to the readers of his &quot;Paradisus in Sole&quot; (1628), under the heading &quot;Oranges&quot;. The trees might be planted against a brick wall and enclosed in winter with a plank shed covered with &quot;cerecloth&quot;, a waxed precursor of tarpaulin, which must have been thought handsomer than the alternative: For that purpose, some keep them in great square boxes, and lift them to and fro by iron hooks on the sides, or cause them to be rowled by trundels, or small wheeles under them, to place them in a house or close gallery.

The building of orangeries became most widely fashionable after the end of the Eighty Years&#x27; War in 1648. The countries that started this trend were France, Germany, and the Netherlands, these countries being the ones that saw merchants begin importing large numbers of orange trees, banana plants, and pomegranates to cultivate for their beauty and scent.

==Construction materials==

Orangeries were generally built facing south to take advantage of the maximum possible light, and were constructed using brick or stone bases, brick or stone pillars, and a corbel gutter. They also featured large, tall windows to maximise available sunlight in the afternoons, with the north facing walls built without windows in a very heavy solid brick, or occasionally with much smaller windows to be able to keep the rooms warm. Insulation at these times was one of the biggest concerns for the building of these orangeries, straw became the main material used, and many had wooden shutters fitted to keep in the warmth. An early example of the type of construction can be seen at Kensington Palace, which also featured underfloor heating.

Contemporary domestic orangeries are also typically built using stone, brick, and hardwood, but developments in glass, other materials, and insulation technologies have produced viable alternatives to traditional construction. The main difference with a conservatory is in the construction of its roof – a conservatory will have more than 75 per cent of its roof glazed, while an orangery will have less than 75 per cent glazed. Domestic orangeries also typically feature a roof lantern. Improved design and insulation has also led to an increasing number of orangeries that are not built facing south, instead using light maximising techniques to make the most of available natural sunlight.

==Early orangeries==

The first examples were basic constructions and could be removed during summer. Notably not only noblemen but also wealthy merchants, e.g., those of Nuremberg, used to cultivate citrus plants in orangeries. Some orangeries were built using the garden wall as the main wall of the new orangery, but as orangeries became more and more popular they started to become more and more influenced by garden designers and architects, which led to the connection between the house and architectural orangery design. This became further influenced by the increased demand for beautiful exotic plants in the garden, which could be grown and looked after in the orangeries.

This created the increased demand in garden design for the wealthy to have their own exotic private gardens, further fuelling the status of the orangery becoming even more the symbol of the elite. This in turn created the need for orangeries to be constructed using even better techniques such as underfloor heating and the ability to have opening windows in the roofs for ventilation. Creating microclimates for the propagation of more and more exotic plants for the private gardens that were becoming creations of beauty all around Europe.

==Great Britain and Ireland==
The orangery built adjacent to Kensington Palace, believed to be designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, was constructed between 1704 and 1705.

The orangery at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, was designed in 1761 by Sir William Chambers and at one time was the largest glasshouse in England.

The orangery at Margam Park, Wales, was built between 1787 and 1793 to house a large collection of orange, lemon, and citron trees inherited by Thomas Mansel Talbot. The original house has been razed, but the surviving orangery, at , is the longest one in Wales.

An orangery dating from about 1700 is at Kenwood House in London, and a slightly earlier one at Montacute. Other orangeries in the hands of the National Trust include:

*Ham House, Richmond, Surrey, in brick, a somewhat less fancy building than others, placed at the end of the walled kitchen garden. 
*Hanbury Hall, Worcestershire
*Croome Court, called the &quot;Temple Greenhouse&quot;; an elaborate Roman temple facade designed by Robert Adam in 1761.

In 1970, Victor Montagu constructed an orangery in his formal Italianate gardens at Mapperton, Dorset.

A mid-19th-century orangery at Norton Hall in Sheffield, England, has been converted to apartments.

In Ireland, orangeries were built at Killruddery House and Loughcrew House.

==United States==

===18th century===
In the United States, the earliest partially intact surviving orangery is at the Tayloe Family Seat, Mount Airy, but today is an overgrown ruin, consisting only of one major wall and portions of the others&#x27; foundations. A ruined orangery can also be seen in the gardens of Eyre Hall in Northampton County, Virginia.

The oldest-known extant orangery in America can be seen at the Wye House, near Tunis Mills (Easton), Maryland. The builder, Edward Lloyd IV had married Elizabeth Tayloe, the daughter of John Tayloe II builder of the aforementioned Mount Airy. This orangery sits behind the main house and consists of a large open room with two smaller wings added at some point after the initial construction. The south-facing wall consists of large triple-hung windows. A second story was traditionally part of the style of orangeries at the time of its construction in the middle to late 18th century as a way of further insulating the main section where the plants were kept. According to the current resident, Ms. Tilghman (a descendant of the Lloyd family), it served as a billiards room for the family. This plantation is also notable as having been the home of Frederick Douglass as a young slave boy.

George Washington designed and constructed an orangery for his home at Mount Vernon, Virginia. It was designed in the Georgian Style of architecture and stands just north of the mansion facing the upper garden. Completed in 1787, it is one of the largest buildings on the Mount Vernon estate. Washington grew lemon and orange trees and sago palms there. Considered an ambitious structure by his contemporaries, the main room featured a vaulted ceiling for air circulation, and incorporated radiant heating from a series of flues under the floor. The original greenhouse burned in 1835, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1951 using original plans.

===19th century===
The Dumbarton Oaks estate in Washington, D.C., includes an orangery built in 1810 that is now used to house gardenias, oleander, and citrus plants during the winter.

Another orangery stands at Hampton National Historic Site near Towson, Maryland. Originally built in 1820, it was part of one of the most extensive collections of citrus trees in the U.S. by the mid-19th century. The current structure is a reconstruction built in the 1970s to replace the original, which burned in 1926.

The orangery at the Battersea Historic Site in Petersburg, Virginia, is currently under restoration. Originally built between 1823 and 1841, it was converted into a garage in a later period.

In the late 19th century, Florence Vanderbilt and husband Hamilton Twombly built an &quot;orangerie&quot; on their estate, Florham, designed by architects McKim, Mead &amp; White. It is now on the Florham Campus of Fairleigh Dickinson University.

===20th century===

An 18th-century style orangery was built in the 1980s at the Tower Hill Botanic Garden in Boylston, Massachusetts.

<text>Aakash Chopra (born 19 September 1977) is a cricket commentator, YouTuber and former cricketer who played for the Indian cricket team from 2003 to late 2004.

Chopra currently works as Hindi cricket commentator for Viacom18. He previously worked as a column writer for ESPNcricinfo.

His international cricket career consisted of 10 test matches, in which he scored 437 runs with an average of 23 per inning.

In Indian domestic cricket, Chopra played for the Delhi cricket team, Himachal Pradesh cricket team and Rajasthan cricket team. He also played for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League.

== Cricket career ==

===International===
Chopra made his Test debut in Ahmedabad against New Zealand in late 2003, as India sought to find an opening partner for his Delhi teammate Virender Sehwag. During the 2003–2004 second Test in Mohali, Chopra scored two half-centuries against New Zealand. On the 2003–04 tour to Australia, he frequently partnered with Virender Sehwag, including two century opening partnerships in Melbourne and Sydney. As an opening batsman, Chopra was credited with the large scores that India accumulated in that series, surpassing middle-order batsmen Rahul Dravid, V. V. S. Laxman, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly who regularly scored centuries.

On the subsequent tour to Pakistan, Chopra scored 42 runs in the first test match wherein Virender Sehwag scored the First ever triple century for an Indian &amp; India scored more than 600 runs in the first innings. India went on to defeat Pakistan in the first Test in Multan. However, in the second Test, the Indian batsmen scored much lower, apart from a century from Yuvraj Singh, who played in place of the injured captain Sourav Ganguly. When Ganguly returned for the final Test, Chopra was axed and Yuvraj was retained on the team.

Chopra was reintroduced as Sehwag&#x27;s partner in the 2004 Border–Gavaskar Trophy after Tendulkar was injured for the First Test in Bangalore. A heavy loss saw Chopra axed for the following match in Chennai upon Tendulkar&#x27;s return, with Yuvraj playing as opening batsman. Yuvraj also struggled, and Chopra was recalled for the Third Test in Nagpur. Australia won this series, the first test win in India for them in 35 years, and this resulted in Chopra being dropped from the team. Chopra was replaced by Delhi teammates Gautam Gambhir and Wasim Jaffer, who went on to partner Sehwag in Test matches. Due to his low scoring rate, Chopra was not considered for One Day Internationals. 

===Domestic===
In September 2008, Aakash played for Delhi in the Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (the winners of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan). Delhi scored 4 and 197, making the match a draw, but SNGPL won the trophy based on first-innings lead. After representing Delhi for a long time, Chopra joined Rajasthan as a guest player in the Ranji Plate division. Chopra helped Rajasthan to become the first Plate division team to win the Ranji Trophy, followed by another Ranji trophy win in 2010–2011 season. Chopra has won three Ranji titles in total, one with Delhi and two with Rajasthan. 

===IPL===
Chopra played for the Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 2008, IPL 2009, but was dropped eventually as he was deemed too slow at scoring for fast-paced T-20 cricket. In those two seasons he scored 53 runs with a average of 8.83 runs across 6 innings.

In IPL 2011, Chopra was signed by the Rajasthan Royals. In 2015, he announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. Chopra is one of the few Indian cricketers who have scored over 8,000 First-Class runs.

==Cricket commentary career==
Chopra was a cricket commentator for Star Sports for a long time. His cricket commentary style has been described as similar to Navjot Singh Sidhu, in that he uses lots of one-liners and rhymes.

During the 2018–19 Australia vs India test series, Chopra was a commentator for 7 Network, and also commentated for Sony Ten 2.

In January 2023, Chopra left Star Sports, and joined Viacom 18 network. He voiced Hindi commentary on Sports 18 and on the Jio Cinema app during the South African Twenty20 league, SA20.

==Other media==
Chopra&#x27;s columns regularly appear in Mid-Day and on ESPNcricinfo.

In 2009, Chopra released &quot;Beyond the Blues: A First-Class Season Like No Other&quot;, a diary of his domestic season in 2007–2008 published by HarperCollins. It received critical acclaim, and Suresh Menon of ESPNcricinfo wrote that it was &quot;the best book written by an Indian Test cricketer&quot;. In November 2011, his second book was published by HarperCollins, and was titled &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, about Rajasthan&#x27;s victory in the Ranji Trophy. He went on to write two more books; &quot;The Insider with ESPNcricinfo&quot; in 2015 and &quot;Numbers Do Lie with Impact Index&quot; in 2017.

In May 2020, Chopra signed as a commentator with popular mobile cricket game &quot;World Cricket Championship&quot; commentate the upcoming WCC3 game. Chopra was the first commentator to become a commentator on a digital game platform.

Aakash Chopra has a YouTube channel where he uploads match reviews and previews.

<doc id="1101093" wikidata="Q862584" url="?curid=1101093" title="Enga Province">
<text>Enga is one of the provinces in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Enga is geographically situated in the northern region of Papua New Guinea and was separated from the adjacent Western Highlands at the time of national independence in 1975. The majority ethnic group are Engans. Approximately 500,000 people live within the province, which has one spoken language in all five of its districts. A small minority of Engans&#x27; land on the eastern side of the region remained in the Western Highlands, their territory being accessible by road from Mount Hagen but not directly from elsewhere in Enga territory.

==History==
Europeans—typically Australian gold prospectors—originally entered what is now Enga province from the east in the late 1920s, although the best-known exploration of Enga took place during the early 1930s when Mick Leahy and a party of men travelled from what later became Mount Hagen to the site of the future Wabag and then south through the Ambum Valley to what later became East Sepik.

On 24 May 2024, a landslide occurred affecting six villages in Maip Muritaka Rural LLG. It is estimated that over 670 people died in this disaster

==Culture==
Engans are divided into three subgroups, the Mae, the Raiapu, and the Kyaka.

Like many other highland Papua New Guineans living west of the Daulo Pass (between Chimbu Province and Eastern Highlands Province), the traditional Engan settlement style is that of scattered homesteads dispersed throughout the landscape. Historically sweet potato was the staple food, sometimes supplemented by pork. The modern diet places an increasing emphasis on store bought rice and tinned fish and meat. Pigs remain a culturally valued item with elaborate systems of pig exchange also known as &quot;tee&quot; that mark social life in the province. The Raiapu practice extensive agriculture in their highland region. Sweet potatoes are the major crop, forming two-thirds of the Raiapu diet. They also raise pigs.

The Raiapu Enga believe in a variety of supernatural beings, although anthropologist Richard Feachem states that the Raiapu &quot;derive no joy or comfort from their religious beliefs&quot; due to the pervasively indifferent or malevolent nature of those spirits. The &quot;yalyakali&quot;, or &quot;sky people,&quot; are fair-skinned and beautiful deities whose idyllic lives in the clouds mirror the agricultural and clan structure of the Raiapu below but lack the sadness of ordinary life. They are considered remote and unapproachable by humans. Feachem states that &quot;the remaining spirit beings (ghosts and demons) are an aggressive and bellicose group who are mercilessly engaged in an endless cycle of revenge and mischief.&quot; The &quot;yuumi nenge&quot;, or &quot;destructive ground force,&quot; are ghosts which cause deaths from exposure in the forest. A &quot;timongo&quot; is a spirit which leaves a human body upon death and wanders the forests as &quot;a source of continual fear and alarm for the living,&quot; particularly the still-living members of their own immediate families, against whom they bear &quot;bitter grievances.&quot; Also living in the wild forests, as well as caves and pools, are evil, carnivorous demons known as &quot;pututuli&quot;, which can change their shape but are often seen as being extremely tall with two-fingered claws. The Raiapu believe that human babies are occasionally switched by female demons with &quot;pututuli&quot; babies. &quot;Topoli&quot; are human sorcerers who possess secret knowledge of spells or other esoteric knowledge, and can defend against and communicate with hostile spirits. They &quot;may be described as a healer of broken limbs, or a catcher of lost ghosts,&quot; writes Feachem.

==Crime and violence==
Tribal violence in Enga has been a way of life, although traditional weaponry, rules of engagement, and peace treaties kept casualties low. This norm has begun to change in the region in the 21st century, with greater use of firearms, mercenaries, and ignoring rules of engagement leading to greater loss of life. Firearms are believed to have been stolen from government armouries. Only a fifth of the 5000 Australian-made Self Loading Rifles and half of the 2000 M16&#x27;s delivered to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) from the 1970s to the 1990s were found in government armouries during an audit in 2004 and 2005. The theft and smuggling of ammunition has also led to large numbers of casualties, leading to peace treaties being more difficult to obtain. The PNGDF and the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary have found it difficult to keep order, as they are often short on weaponry and ammunition themselves.

Fighting emerged after the 2022 Papua New Guinean general election, with thousands being displaced from their homes. This fighting then continued with different tribes ambushing others in a myriad of disputes, leading to villages being abandoned. Many inhabitants have been displaced to the capital of Wabag in order to escape the fighting. In February 2024, 69 people were killed in a massacre in Akom, 30 minutes from the capital, the worst loss of life since the Bougainville conflict of the 1980s and 1990s. Prime Minister James Marape called it an act of domestic terrorism and stated that they would seek help from Australia to support policing and security in the region.

==Districts and LLGs==
The province has six districts, and each district has one or more Local Level Government (LLG) areas. For census purposes, the LLG areas are subdivided into wards and those into census units.

== Provincial leaders==

The province was governed by a decentralised provincial administration, headed by a Premier, from 1978 to 1995. Following reforms taking effect that year, the national government reassumed some powers, and the role of Premier was replaced by a position of Governor, to be held by the winner of the province-wide seat in the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea.

===Premiers (1978–1995)===

===Regional Member/Governors (1995–present)===

==Members of the National Parliament==

The province and each district is represented by a Member of the National Parliament. There is one provincial electorate and each district is an open electorate.

<text>The First Taiwan Strait Crisis (also known as the Formosa Crisis, the 1954–1955 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the Offshore Islands Crisis, the Quemoy-Matsu Crisis, and the 1955 Taiwan Strait Crisis) was a brief armed conflict between the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) focused on several ROC-held islands a few miles from the Chinese mainland in the Taiwan Strait.

The crisis began when the PRC initiated heavy bombardment of Kinmen (Quemoy) island in September 1954. Shelling was subsequently extended to the Matsu and Tachen (Dachen) islands. In response, the United States and the ROC agreed to the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty in December 1954. In January 1955, the PRC seized the Yijiangshan Islands. Later that month, the Formosa Resolution was approved by both houses of the U.S. Congress, authorizing President Dwight D. Eisenhower to defend the ROC and its possessions. The U.S. Navy helped ROC troops evacuate from the Tachen Islands.

The crisis de-escalated in April 1955 after Premier Zhou Enlai articulated the PRC&#x27;s intention to negotiate with the United States at the Bandung Conference, and in May 1955 the People&#x27;s Liberation Army ceased shelling Kinmen and Matsu. Ambassadorial-level discussions between China and the U.S. began in Geneva in August 1955. The fundamental issues of the conflict remained unresolved, which led to another crisis three years later.

==Background==
The United States recognized Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist (Kuomintang) government as the sole legitimate government for all of China. On January 5, 1950, United States President Harry S. Truman issued a statement that the United States would not become involved in &quot;the civil conflict in China&quot; and would not provide military aid or advice to the Nationalist forces on Taiwan.

As the Korean War broke out, the United States resumed military aid to the ROC and sent the US Navy&#x27;s Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait.

On 27 June 1950, Truman issued the following statement:

President Truman later ordered John Foster Dulles, the Foreign Policy Advisor to U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson, to carry out his decision on &quot;neutralizing&quot; Taiwan in drafting the Treaty of San Francisco of 1951 (the peace treaty with Japan), which excluded the participation of both the ROC and the PRC. Each self-claimed legitimate government of China was excluded from the treaty because the question of China&#x27;s legitimate government remained unresolved after World War II and the Chinese Civil War, and this was considered an intractable sticking point in otherwise comprehensive and multilaterally beneficial peace negotiations.

Japan ceded control of Taiwan in the treaty but did not specify a recipient for Taiwan&#x27;s sovereignty. This situation has been used by supporters of Taiwan independence to argue for their position that the sovereignty status of Taiwan was undetermined, despite the Japanese having already agreed to return Taiwan to Republic of China through their Instrument of Surrender signed at end of the War. According to the author George H. Kerr, a supporter of Taiwanese independence, in his book &quot;Formosa Betrayed&quot;, the political status of Taiwan was under the trust of the Allied Powers (against Japan). It would be the responsibility of the United Nations if this could not be resolved in near future as designed in the peace treaty.

The ROC Nationalist Government (now based in Taiwan) maintained as its goal the recovery of control of mainland China, and this required a resumption of the military confrontation with the Red Chinese. Truman and his advisors regarded that goal as unrealizable, but regret over losing China to international communism was quite prominent in public opinion at the time, and the Truman Administration was criticized by anticommunists for preventing any attempt by Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s forces to liberate mainland China.

Truman, a member of the Democratic Party, did not run for reelection in the presidential election of 1952, even though he was eligible to do so. This election was won by the Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, a General from World War II.

On 2 February 1953, the new president lifted the Seventh Fleet&#x27;s blockade in order to fulfill demands by anticommunists to &quot;unleash Chiang Kai-shek&quot; on mainland China, hence the Kuomintang regime strengthened its Closed Port Policy of the aerial and naval blockade on foreign vessels on Chinese coast and the high seas, whereas the privacy activities intensified in the summer 1953 after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death and the Korean Armistice Agreement till summed up to 141 interference incidents as per the Royal Navy escort reports.

The CIA briefing on 13 July 1954 for the White House and NSC indicated the shipping insurance increasement across the South China Sea after the Tuapse Incident on 23 June, and certain international liners being deterred midway at Singapore, or had to change plans. The PLA Air Force moved in the Hainan Island to clear another transport route through Yulin and Huangpu ports, but accidentally shot down a Douglas DC-4 (VR-HEU) airliner of the Cathay Pacific Airways with 10 deaths on 23 July, then 2 US aircraft carriers, Hornet and Philippine Sea arrived for a rescue mission on 26 July and shot down 2 PLAAF Lavochkin La-11 fighters . On 2 August, Commander of PLA in the Central Military Commission (CMC), Peng Dehuai convened an executive meeting to establish the tactical command on the East China Military Region as per CMC chairman Mao Zedong&#x27;s directive to open another front from the north.

==The conflict==
In August 1954, the Nationalists placed 58,000 troops on Kinmen and 15,000 troops on Matsu. The ROC began building defensive structures and the PRC began shelling ROC installations on Kinmen. Zhou Enlai, PRC premier responded with a declaration on 11 August 1954, that Taiwan must be &quot;liberated.&quot; He dispatched the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) to the area, and it began shelling both Kinmen and the Matsu Islands.

Despite warnings from the U.S. against any attacks on the Republic of China, five days before the signing of the Manila pact, the PLA unleashed a heavy artillery bombardment of Kinmen on September 3, during which two American military advisers were killed.
Mao Zedong sought to avoid United States involvement in the conflict and gave repeated orders that the PLA should avoid engaging with the American forces off the coast. In November, the PLA bombed the Tachen Islands. This renewed Cold War fears of Communist expansion in Asia at a time when the PRC was not recognized by the United States Department of State. Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s government was supported by the United States because the ROC was part of the United States&#x27; policy of containment of communism which stretched from a devastated South Korea to an increasingly divided Southeast Asia.

The PLA initially planned to attack the Yijiangshan Islands in late 1954, but delayed the attack while American forces were conducting military exercises in that area. On 18 January 1955, the PLA seized the islands. Fighting continued on nearby islands off the coast of Zhejiang, as well as around Kinmen and the Matsu Islands in Fujian. On 29 January 1955, the Formosa Resolution was approved by both houses of the U.S. Congress authorizing Eisenhower to use U.S. forces to defend the ROC and its possessions in the Taiwan Strait against armed attack. The U.S. Navy then assisted the Nationalists in evacuating their forces from the Tachen Islands.

During the crisis, Eisenhower threatened to use nuclear weapons against PRC military targets in Fujian. On 12 September 1954, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended the use of nuclear weapons against mainland China. On 2 December 1954, the United States and the ROC agreed to the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, which did not apply to islands along the Chinese mainland. This treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate on 9 February 1955. In February 1955, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill warned the U.S. against using nuclear weapons, but in March, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles stated publicly that the U.S. was seriously considering a nuclear strike. On 6 March, Eisenhower also reaffirmed his willingness to use nuclear weapons. In response, the NATO foreign ministers warned at a meeting of the alliance against such action. In late March, U.S. Admiral Robert B. Carney said that Eisenhower is planning &quot;to destroy Red China&#x27;s military potential.&quot; 

At the April 1955 Bandung Conference, China articulated its Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and Premier Zhou Enlai publicly stated, &quot;[T]he Chinese people do not want to have a war with the United States. The Chinese government is willing to sit down to discuss the question of relaxing tension in the Far East, and especially the question of relaxing tension in the Taiwan area.&quot; A month later, Mao likewise told Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo that all problems, including the status of Taiwan, could be resolved through negotiation. The crisis de-escalated, and the United States and China began ambassadorial-level discussions in Geneva on August 1, 1955. Two years of negotiations with the United States followed, and covered many issues, although no agreement was reached on the primary issue, Taiwan.

==Aftermath==
Some scholars hypothesized the PRC backed down in the face of American nuclear brinksmanship and in light of the lack of willingness by the Soviet Union to threaten nuclear retaliation for an attack on the PRC. Others see the case as an example of effective application of extended deterrence by the United States. On 1 May the PLA temporarily ceased shelling Kinmen and Matsu. The fundamental issues of the conflict remained unresolved, however, and both sides subsequently built up their military forces on their respective sides of the Taiwan Strait leading to a new crisis three years later.

Eisenhower&#x27;s threats to use nuclear weapons during the crisis prompted Mao to begin China&#x27;s nuclear program. The first of China&#x27;s nuclear weapons tests took place in 1964 and its first successful hydrogen bomb test occurred in 1967.

<doc id="1101105" wikidata="Q3990036" url="?curid=1101105" title="The Wind (Warren Zevon album)">
<text>The Wind is the twelfth and final studio album by American singer-songwriter Warren Zevon. The album was released on August 26, 2003, by Artemis Records. Zevon began recording the album shortly after he was diagnosed with inoperable pleural mesothelioma (a cancer of the lining of the lung), and it was released just two weeks before his death on September 7, 2003. The album was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, and &quot;Disorder in the House&quot;, performed by Zevon with Bruce Springsteen, won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance (Group or Duo). Songs from the album were nominated for an additional three Grammys.

==Recording and release==
Upon learning of his cancer diagnosis, Zevon became determined to record a final studio album. His record label gave him a large budget to record, and he got assistance from several high-profile musicians and friends. Zevon was inspired to include a Bob Dylan cover after Dylan performed several of his songs in concert in 2002.

== Critical reception ==
The record was regarded by Robert Christgau as &quot;one of those nearness-of-death albums&quot;, along with Mississippi John Hurt&#x27;s &quot;Last Sessions&quot; (1972), Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; (1997), Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Prairie Wind&quot; (2005), and Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;American VI: Ain&#x27;t No Grave&quot; (2010).

<text>The Atorox Award (Finnish: &quot;Atorox-palkinto&quot;, Swedish: &quot;Atoroxpriset&quot;) is the oldest science fiction literature award in Finland. It is given annually to the best science fiction short story. The name &quot;Atorox&quot; comes from the works of Aarne Haapakoski (1904–1961), who was one of the first science fiction writers in Finland. The award is given by the Turku Science Fiction Society but the winner is selected by representatives of the entire Finnish fandom. It has been awarded annually since 1983. Johanna Sinisalo has been given the Atorox Award seven times, more times than any other writer.

<text>Te Waewae Bay is the westernmost of three large bays lying on the Foveaux Strait coast of Southland, New Zealand, the others being Oreti Beach and Toetoes Bay. Twenty-seven kilometres in length, the western end of the bay is mountainous, with the southern terminus of the Southern Alps and Fiordland National Park.

Its Māori name reflects the southern chief (&quot;rangatira&quot;), Te Waewae who resided in the bay for large periods of time.

The small farming town of Orepuki is situated on the cliffs at the eastern end of the bay and the timber town of Tuatapere and Port Craig is located seven kilometres north of the bay, on the banks of the Waiau River, which has its outflow in the bay.

The bay, lining from Sand Hill Point to Pahia Point, is declared as a marine mammal sanctuary and hosts an important habitat for New Zealand fur seals, the endemic Hector&#x27;s dolphins and one of major winter breeding grounds for southern right whales on mainland coasts. Other species can be seen within the areas, from time to time, include such as humpback whales, orcas, Hooker&#x27;s sea lions, and leopard seals. Sea Shepherd is conducting annual patrolling named the &quot;Operation Pahu&quot; (&quot;Pahu&quot; stands for Hector&#x27;s Dolphins in Māori).

Surrounding lands, both coastal and terrestrial, are home to little blue penguins and Fiordland crested penguins, 25 species of native birds, and the endangered New Zealand long-tailed bats

<text>Strata title is a form of ownership and housing tenure devised for multi-level apartment blocks and horizontal subdivisions with shared areas. The word &quot;strata&quot; refers to apartments on different levels.

Strata title was first introduced in 1961 in the state of New South Wales, Australia, to better cope with the legal ownership of apartment blocks. Previously, the only adequate method of dividing ownership was company title, which had a number of defects, such as the difficulty of instituting mortgages. This term also applies to house-type strata title units in Australia.

Other countries that have adopted the Australian system (or a similar variant) of apartment ownership include: Canada (Alberta, British Columbia), Fiji, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates. Other countries have legislation based on similar principles but with different definitions and using different mechanisms in their administration.

Strata title schemes are composed of individual lots and common property. Lots are either apartments, garages or storerooms and each is shown on the title as owned by a lot owner. Common property is defined as everything else on the parcel of land that is not comprised in a lot, such as common stairwells, driveways, roofs, gardens and so on.

==In New Zealand==
In New Zealand, strata title, commonly called a unit title, is created by the Unit Titles Act 2010. There are 145,000 unit title dwellings in New Zealand.

A unit title can be either a stratum in freehold, where the owners own the underlying land, or stratum in leasehold, where another person owns the land and the body corporate pays rent to that person. As New Zealand uses the Torrens System of indefeasible titles, the title for a unit title has a title for the principal unit, showing the legal description of the principal unit and any accessory units and any legal document registered against those units (called an interest); a Supplementary Record Sheet, showing the rules of the body corporate, its registered address and any interests registered against the underlying land; and the survey plan, which shows the boundaries of the units and the common property.

A person purchasing a unit title purchases a principal unit, which is designed as a place of business or residence; any accessory units included in the title for the principal unit, such as car parks and storage lockers; and a beneficial interest in the common property, such as corridors, air ducts, building structure and entry ways; and membership in the body corporate, which is composed of all unit owners and which legally owns the common property.

Creation of a unit title is a type of subdivision and so requires the approval of the relevant territorial authority under the Resource Management Act 1991, as well as under the Unit Titles Act 2010. A unit plan must be deposited with Land Information New Zealand and new titles issue in respect of each principal unit.

The body corporate is responsible for maintaining the common property and the structure of the building (if this duty is delegated by the owners), and for insuring the common property and the building structure. The body corporate can set rules governing the use of the common property (for example, an owner who causes damage must repair it) and the units (for example, limiting pets, or noise levels depending on the time of day), and for the regulation of the body corporate. These rules must be registered and non-registered rules do not have legal effect. The operations of the body corporate are paid for by levies on all owners. Levies are assigned based on the ownership interest or utility interest of the particular unit. An ownership interest is based on the value of the unit, while a utility interest is either the ownership interest or a proportion that is fair and equitable having regard to the costs and benefits of the unit.

The owners in the unit title development must meet yearly to approve the levies, the financial statements, long term maintenance plan and fund (if any), approve changes to the body corporate rules (if any), and the appointment of the body corporate chairman and committee (if any). The body corporate can delegate most of their duties to the committee of the owners. The body corporate can also enter into service agreements in respect of the administration of the body corporate, usually to a specialist body corporate management firm, and building maintenance, including appointing a building manager. These service agreements must be permitted under the body corporate rules.

A body corporate must have a long term maintenance plan, which provides for maintenance of the common property for at least ten years and an estimate of the costs. The long term maintenance plan is then paid for by the long term maintenance fund, which must be separate from the body corporate general operating fund. However, a body corporate can elect not to have a Long Term Maintenance Fund.

Disputes under the Unit Titles Act are heard in the Tenancy Tribunal.

<text>A checkwriter may refer to:

==Occupation==

A person who physically writes a check or cheque. The check writer is also known as the &quot;&quot;, &quot;signer&quot;, &quot;maker&quot;, the drawer, or the &quot;account holder.&quot; The signer or presenter of the check, or person who prints and authorizes the check.

In U.S. law, in Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, codified in most U.S. State statutes, a check is an order (as opposed to a promise) to pay a fixed amount of money, according to §3-104(a).

§3-104(f) specifies that

Such an order is issued by the drawer.

§3-103(a)(3) specifies that

==Machine==
A check writer (also known as a &quot;ribbon writer&quot;, &quot;check signer&quot;, &quot;check protector&quot; or &quot;check embosser&quot;), is a physical device for protecting a check from unauthorized alteration of either the amount or the authorizing signature.

Devices of this type that use various technologies are also known as check protectors, check punches, and check perforators. A check punch punches holes in the shapes of numerals. A check perforator punches small round holes that form numerals.

A check writer, or ribbon writer, leaves a numerical or written value impression in the payment amount field of a check that is very difficult to alter. This is accomplished by the machine applying downward force on the check and leaving very small inked shreds in the paper.

The first check protector was introduced in 1870. The best known check protectors in the early 1900s had the brand name Protectograph (the Todd Company, Rochester, NY). Other well known manufacturers in the industry were F &amp; E Hedman and the Paymaster Company (both out of Chicago, IL).

The person preparing a check positions the check in the check writer so its print-heads are centered over the field on the check where the amount of the check would otherwise be written out in words. Using a series of levers or buttons on the checkwriter&#x27;s control panel, the operator enters the monetary amount of the check. This amount is then printed onto the check by the operator pulling a lever on the side of the unit (or by pressing a button on electric units). This brings the print-heads down upon a wide inked (usually multicolor) ribbon through which they print the selected amount on the check, with a prefix and suffix to prevent a fraudster from adding extra digits. Entering $6,762.64, for example, will produce text reading &quot;TheSum6762dol&#x27;s64cts&quot;.

There is a series of (usually) horizontal indentations on a pressure bar brought up underneath the check during this process, which matches similar indentations on the print-heads. This embosses the numeric amount through the paper of the check form, strongly discouraging any attempt to alter or raise this amount.

Because physical check writers and ribbon writers are now considered antique, businesses that still need this check protection technology such as a business, or organization which regularly prepares remittances by issuing high-amount checks can use a physical check writing device. Financial institutions regularly use them to prepare cashier&#x27;s checks, and they are also used by issuers of money orders such as the United States Postal Service. Newer versions are electronic, but many are still made by Paymaster.

==Software==
There are many check writing and printing software available.

Simple Checks is an online platform for check writing and printing known for its simplicity and efficiency managing check writing and shipping from a single platform. The service allows users to send checks via email and provides check fulfillment services, including printing and mailing checks on behalf of clients. Simple Checks also offers integration with software such as NetSuite and QuickBooks, enabling seamless financial workflows. Additionally, the platform supports batch check import, making it suitable for handling high volumes of transactions efficiently.

Online Check Writer is a cloud-based check printing software. This online application facilitates Check printing of any bank, on any blank Check paper using any printer. The company claims they are integrated with QuickBooks and 16000+ Banks and Financial Institutions. The main advantage of the application is it&#x27;s easy to detect Fraudulent Checks.

&quot;CheckWriter&quot; is business software used to accept payments from customers, patients, members or subscribers. Unlike a physical device, the software facilitates check draft demand draft technology, and Check 21 Act regulations to emulate the check writer.

The software prints a physical draft of a customer&#x27;s checks that a business can then deposit into any U.S. bank the same day. The software has been in circulation since 1996 and operates on a Microsoft Windows PC platform.

Uses for &quot;CheckWriter&quot; software include bill payment acceptance by phone for insurance companies, hospitals, collections agencies, medical professionals, utilities, loan providers, telemarketers, and almost any other industry that needs to take check payments from customers.

The company claims &quot;CheckWriter&quot; as their trademark since 1996 in the software industry, according to their publications, prosecution history, and public record.

<text>Toetoes Bay is the easternmost of three large bays lying on the Foveaux Strait coast of Southland, New Zealand, the others being Te Waewae Bay and Oreti Beach. The 240 km Mataura River drains to sea at Toetoes Bay, first passing through the Toetoes Harbour estuary. Thirty kilometres (20 miles) in length, the bay is the southern end of the Awarua Plain, an area of swampy land stretching inland for about fifteen kilometres (10 miles). The eastern end of the bay is close to Slope Point, the South Island&#x27;s southernmost point, and the western end of the Catlins.

Tiwai Point, with its aluminium smelter, is located on a peninsula at the western end of the bay, on the edge of Bluff harbour. Waituna Lagoon is located halfway along the bay, and towards the eastern end the Mataura River has its outflow into the Foveaux Strait.

The bay gets its name from a 19th-century Māori chief, Toitoi. Whalers named the Waituna Lagoon &quot;Toetoe&#x27;s Place&quot; and the name was later given to the bay.

<doc id="1101139" wikidata="Q700442" url="?curid=1101139" title="Second Taiwan Strait Crisis">
<text>The Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, also known as the 1958 Taiwan Strait Crisis, was a conflict between the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC). The PRC shelled the islands of Kinmen (Quemoy) and the Matsu Islands along the east coast of mainland China in an attempt to take them from the Chinese Nationalist Party, also known as the Kuomintang (KMT), and to probe the extent of American commitment to defend the Republic of China. The conflict also involved air, naval, and amphibious operations. Then U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter reportedly described it as the &quot;first serious nuclear crisis&quot;.

==Background==
The conflict was a continuation of the Chinese Civil War and First Taiwan Strait Crisis. The Republic of China (ROC) had begun to build military installations on the island of Kinmen (Quemoy) and the Matsu archipelago. The Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) began firing artillery at both Kinmen and some of the nearby Matsu islands.

==Conflict==
On 24 and 25 August 1958 Chinese Communist and Chinese Nationalist forces clashed in the vicinity of Dongding Island, which the Nationalist troops controlled. The action was seen as an attempt by the communists to land on the island. This was the only naval and amphibious landing action during the crisis. The communist forces were repelled from taking the island. The action has also been seen as an attempt to draw Nationalist forces away from other areas.

In the days after shelling began, the American Joint Chiefs of Staff had determined to defend the islands even if the defense necessitated a nuclear response. Throughout the following weeks as the crisis continued to unfold, contingency plans were developed as it became clear that the critical issue was supplying Kinmen. In a meeting on 2 September, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other top officials to formulate an ongoing American strategy. The group determined that the use of nuclear weapons would ultimately be necessary for the defense of Kinmen, but that the United States should initially limit itself to using conventional forces. Throughout the crisis, coordination between American policymakers and military commanders was hampered by communication delays of days at a time, but by September American officials had authorized naval escorts to accompany ROC convoys up to 3 miles off Kinmen and begun to supply the ROC with advanced weapons. The Chinese Communists considered the escorts a violation of the territorial waters of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. On 19 September, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev sent a letter warning that the American actions threatened world war, claiming that the Soviet Union would be forced to honor its commitments to the territorial integrity of Communist China. The letter was rejected by the American government.

The Eisenhower Administration responded to the request for aid from the ROC according to its obligations in the ROC-United States mutual defense treaty that had been ratified in 1954. President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the reinforcement of the U.S. Navy Seventh Fleet in the area, and he ordered American naval vessels to help the Nationalist Chinese government to protect the supply lines to the islands. In addition, the U.S. Air Force deployed F-100D Super Sabres, F-101C Voodoos, F-104A Starfighters, and B-57B Canberras to Taiwan to demonstrate support for Taiwan. The F-104s were disassembled and airlifted to Taiwan in C-124 Globemaster II transport aircraft, marking the first time such a method was used to move fighter aircraft over a long distance.

By 11 September, the artillery crisis was overall stabilized (even though numerous rounds of artillery would still be fired by Communist China almost daily for the next two months or so) because U.S. Navy warships started to escort ROC convoys to Kinmen, breaking the previous artillery blockade due to constant PRC artillery shells that prevented any air or naval relief for Kinmen. The PRC did not want to risk war with the United States so they refrained from firing on any convoys if they observed U.S. Navy ships. The biggest issues in the crisis after September 11 were the air battles and the success or failure of the naval convoys relieving the Kinmen garrison.

Landing units with LVTs from the ROC Marine Corps spent the next few months delivering supplies to the Kinmen Islands, starting from 10 September. Despite continued artillery fire from the PRC, the Marines were able to keep the islands supplied. For this action, the ROC Marines were later awarded a presidential banner from Chiang Kai-shek.

Also, under a secret effort called &quot;Operation Black Magic&quot;, the U.S. Navy modified some of the F-86 Sabre fighters of the Nationalist Chinese Air Force with its newly developed early AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. These missiles gave the Nationalist Chinese pilots a decisive edge over the Chinese Communists&#x27; Soviet-made MiG-15 and MiG-17 fighters in the skies over the Matsu Islands and the Taiwan Strait. The Nationalist Chinese pilots used the Sidewinder missiles to score numerous kills on People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) MiG aircraft. The operation suffered blowback when one missile lodged in a MiG-17 without exploding, to be removed after landing and reverse-engineered into the Soviet K-13.

The US Army&#x27;s contribution reinforced the strategic air defense capability of the Republic of China. A provisional Nike missile battalion was organized at Fort Bliss, TX, and sent via USMTS to Nationalist China. The 2nd Missile Battalion was augmented with detachments of signal, ordnance and engineers, totaling some 704 personnel. In addition, American ambassador Everett Drumwright advocated for a preemptive strike against PRC positions.

Twelve long-range M115 howitzer artillery pieces and numerous 155 mm howitzers were transferred from the U.S. Marine Corps to the Republic of China Army. These were sent west to Kinmen Island to gain superiority in the artillery duel back and forth over the straits there.

Soon, the Soviet Union dispatched its foreign minister, Andrei Gromyko, to Beijing to discuss the actions of the PLA and the PLAAF, with advice of caution to the Communist Chinese.

On 24 September 1958 the Sidewinder missile was used for the first time in air-to-air combat as 32 Republic of China F-86s clashed with 100 PLAAF MiGs in a series of aerial engagements. 25 MiGs were shot down by Sidewinders, the first &quot;kills&quot; to be scored by air-to-air missiles in combat. In October more dogfights between ROC and PRC fighter jets occurred and the total airplane casualties during the crisis was 31 PRC MiGs shot down and 2 ROC F-86s shot down. From 30 September 1958 until 5 October 1958, the Marine Air Control Squadron No. 1 (MACS-1) was stationed at Ping Tung, Taiwan as support, rerouted from their position in the Philippines. One of the Radio Operators on board was Private Lee Harvey Oswald. 

Soon, the People&#x27;s Republic of China was faced with a stalemate, as the PLA&#x27;s artillerymen had run out of artillery shells. The Communist Chinese government announced a unilateral ceasefire on 6 October 1958. However, on 20 October the PLA resumed artillery fire on Kinmen because a U.S. Navy warship had breached the PRC-declared 3 nautical miles exclusive zone from the coast of China that they claimed was a stipulation for their unilateral ceasefire agreement. Another more likely reason for the resumption of the PRC artillery bombardment was U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had arrived in Taipei to discuss the situation with the ROC government. The overall crisis finished by December 1958 when both the PRC and ROC troops settled into their eccentric alternating odd and even days firing period that lasted until 1979 when the United States and the PRC established diplomatic relations. Because both armies knew exactly what day, what time, and which areas would be attacked by artillery shells (military bases and artillery positions) the PRC and ROC troops were safe from harm due to hiding in bunkers thanks to this gentleman&#x27;s agreement.

U.S. Marine Corps Marine Air Group 11 stationed at NAS Atsugi, Japan, was sent to Taiwan in March 1960 and landed at Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and moved via trucks to Pingtung Air Base about north of Kaohsiung. They remained there, conducting air operations from the WWII Japanese air strip until sometime in late April 1960 when they returned to Atsugi, Japan. They were joined at Pingtung by a reinforced rifle company from the Ninth Marines based on Okinawa.

==Aftermath==
===Intermittently shelling until 1979===
&quot;On 25 October [the Chinese Communists] ... declared that they would not fire on even-numbered days ... if there were no American escort.&quot; This allowed Taiwan to resupply their military units on those islands on those days. Afterwards, both sides continued to bombard each other with shells containing propaganda leaflets on alternate days of the week. This strange informal arrangement continued until the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Communist People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1979. The timed shelling created little damage and casualties; it was mainly aimed at military compounds and artillery pieces. Sometimes during tense diplomatic moments PRC forces would revert to August/September 1958 levels of bombardment, temporarily breaking the normally scheduled non-lethal propaganda artillery shelling. One of these occasions happened in June 1960, when President Eisenhower visited Taipei. During Eisenhower&#x27;s visit PRC forces fired over 100,000 artillery rounds onto Kinmen within a few days, killing 7 ROC soldiers and wounding 59, while 6 civilians perished and 15 were injured. ROC soldiers withheld their fire until after Eisenhower left Taipei. After his visit they retaliated by firing thousands of artillery rounds of their own onto mainland China from Kinmen. The PRC bombardment damaged 200 homes, five schools and a hospital on Kinmen, showing that during the 20-year period of mostly propaganda leaflets being fired by both sides it was still a very dangerous combat zone until 1979.

The crisis subsided and returned to &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot; on 2 December when the U.S. Navy secretly and quietly removed their extra warships from the Taiwan Strait and the ROC Navy resumed unilateral combat and escort duties.

On 23 August 2019, the sixty-first anniversary of the beginning of the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, President Tsai Ing-wen visited the Taiwushan martyrs&#x27; shrine () where she placed flowers and offered incense.

During the crisis, American leadership risked the alienation of the American public, relations with key allies such as France and Japan, and even nuclear war. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles argued that while the &quot;status quo&quot; result was a victory, the American government could not permit such a situation to arise again. Other than the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis from 1995 to 1996 there has been no crisis involving the United States since 1958 in the Taiwan Strait.

<doc id="1101140" wikidata="Q2632324" url="?curid=1101140" title="SPP-1 underwater pistol">
<text>The SPP-1 underwater pistol was made in the Soviet Union for use by Soviet frogmen as an underwater firearm. It was developed in the late 1960s and accepted for use in 1975. Under water, ordinary-shaped bullets are inaccurate and very short-range. As a result, this pistol fires a round-based caliber steel dart about long, weighing , which has longer range and more penetrating power than speargun spears. The complete cartridge is long and weighs .

==Design==
The SPP-1 has four barrels, each containing one cartridge. Its ammunition comes as a magazine of four cartridges which is inserted into the pistol&#x27;s breech.

Its barrel is not rifled; the fired projectile is kept in line by hydrodynamic effects. As a result, it is somewhat inaccurate when fired out of water.

A double-action firing mechanism fires one cartridge sequentially for each pull of the trigger. When all four cartridges are spent, the gun can be reloaded above or below water.

The SPP-1M pistol is essentially the same as the SPP-1, with the following differences:
* It has an extra spring above the sear to improve the trigger pull.
* Its trigger guard is larger to accommodate diving gloves.

The weapon was designed by Vladimir Simonov, the cartridge by Pyotr Sazonov and Oleg Kravchenko. Simonov also designed the APS amphibious rifle.

==Performance==
Depth reduces range because the higher pressure closes the cavity sooner. Once the projectile is no longer supercavitating, hydrodynamic drag increases greatly, and the projectile becomes unstable.

Lethal range is defined as the range from which it can easily penetrate a padded underwater suit or a thick glass faceplate.

It is manufactured by TOZ (Tulsky Oruzheiny Zavod/ Тульский Оружейный Завод) Tula Arms Plant, and exported by Rosoboronexport, the state agency for Russia&#x27;s export and import of defense-related products.

<doc id="1101141" wikidata="Q6301548" url="?curid=1101141" title="Juanita García Peraza">
<text>Juanita García Peraza also known as &quot;Mita&quot; (June 24, 1897 – February 21, 1970) was the founder of the Mita Congregation, a christian denomination with Puerto Rican origins which is described in Melton&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Protestantism.&quot; When Peraza died, the Senate of Puerto Rico closed their offices for three days in her honor.

==Early years==
García Peraza was born in Hatillo, Puerto Rico, and raised by her parents, both belonging to wealthy Catholic families that had immigrated to Puerto Rico from the Canary Islands in the 1830s. Her father had previously married one of his cousins, of the prominent García family of the Arecibo, Puerto Rico, region; well-known Puerto Rican writer René Marqués García is one of her nephews. After divorcing his cousin, her father married García Peraza&#x27;s mother, from another Canarian family. When her family moved to their townhouse in Arecibo, García Peraza became extremely ill. She made a promise to Mita God that if she was cured, she would always serve him.

García Peraza considered it a miracle that she was cured of her illness and she decided to keep her promise. She was one of the first Puerto Rican women to preach religion in Puerto Rico. Soon, she claimed to have the gift of prophecy and said that she received a new revelation from God that the new name of the Holy Spirit was &quot;Mita&quot;. The church leaders did not accept such a prophecy and she was asked to leave. She and 11 members left and formed the congregation we see today.

==&quot;Mita&quot;==

García Peraza left the Roman Catholicism and converted to the Protestant Iglesia de Dios Pentecostal M.I., and then left the church with 11 other members who followed her to start their own religion. In 1940, she and her followers founded their own church in Arecibo, and in 1947 she relocated to the current location of Hato Rey, a suburb of San Juan. They call themselves &quot;Mitas&quot; and their church &quot;the Mita congregation&quot;. According to the Mita congregation, Mita is the name of the Holy Ghost on earth.

Under García Peraza&#x27;s leadership, the church founded many small businesses which provided work, orientation, and help for its members. The first branch of the church outside of Puerto Rico was established in New York City. The church has expanded to Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Panama, El Salvador, Canada, Ecuador, Spain and other countries.

==Legacy==
Juanita &quot;Mita&quot; García Peraza died on February 21, 1970, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Teófilo Vargas Sein (&quot;Aarón&quot;), was appointed Leader of the church. Puerto Rico honored Juanita García Peraza&#x27;s memory by naming an elementary school after her in San Juan.

<text>Oreti Beach is the central bay of three lying on the Foveaux Strait coast of Southland, New Zealand, the others being Te Waewae Bay and Toetoes Bay. Twenty-six kilometres in length, the bay lies between the town of Riverton and the outflow of the Aparima River in the northwest, and the estuary of the Ōreti River in the southeast.

The city of Invercargill is located on the Waihopai River ten kilometres east of the bay at the closest point.

This is the site where Burt Munro practised riding the Indian motorbike with which he would go on to break records at Bonneville Salt flats, Utah.

<text>WKTB-CD (channel 47) is a low-power, Class A television station licensed to Norcross, Georgia, United States, serving the Atlanta area as an affiliate of the Spanish-language network Telemundo. It is owned by locally based Gray Media alongside CBS affiliate and company flagship WANF (channel 46), and The CW affiliate WPCH-TV (channel 17). WKTB-CD&#x27;s studios are located on Green River Parkway in Duluth, and its transmitter is located on Goshen Springs Road (near the I-85/SR 140 interchange) just outside Norcross. Master control and most internal operations are based at the shared studios of WANF and WPCH-TV on 14th Street Northwest in Atlanta&#x27;s Home Park neighborhood.

The 47.2 signal is rebroadcast in widescreen standard definition on full-power WANF to provide a Telemundo signal to the entire market, using virtual channel 47.1.

==History==

===Early years===
On April 2, 1990, John R. Broomall received the construction permit for a new low-power television station licensed to Roswell, Georgia, on channel 67. Broomall sold the permit to the Korean American TV Broadcasting Co. in April 1991.

By 1996, Korean American had added Telemundo programming, which aired for most of the day, alongside Chinese- and Korean-language fare. Korean programming aired from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and again from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m., emphasizing local news, alongside local church service broadcasts and South Korean news and entertainment programs.

The Korean programming, known as KTN, went full-time on a cable channel on AT&amp;T Broadband systems in 2001, which increased its output from six hours a day. Programming continued to include imported and local productions. Meanwhile, channel 67 became channel 38, a result of the clearing of channels 60 to 69 for telecommunications use, in 2000, becoming W38CU. The station&#x27;s coverage area did not reach much of the city of Atlanta, but it did reach areas of Gwinnett County and DeKalb County with significant ethnic populations.
===Digital era===
Korean American TV obtained a permit to construct W47DN-D as its digital companion channel on channel 47, with a superior technical facility covering much of the metropolitan area. In 2009, W38CU obtained Class A status and became WKTB-CA; this transferred to the digital transmitter in 2011 upon consolidation under one license. In 2009, the station reaffiliated with Telemundo.
In August 2013, a subchannel on full-power WPXA-TV began repeating WKTB-CD&#x27;s Telemundo feed in standard definition, using virtual channel 47.11. In June 2021, this moved to WSB-TV.

===Sale to Gray Television===
On February 7, 2022, it was announced that Gray Television would purchase WKTB-CD and sister company Surge Digital Media, an ad agency specializing in multicultural clients and services, for $30 million, pending approval of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC); this would make WKTB-CD a sister station to Gray&#x27;s duopoly of CBS affiliate WGCL-TV (channel 46, now WANF) and independent station WPCH-TV (channel 17). The sale was completed on April 1, and with it, its full-power simulcast moved to WGCL&#x27;s spectrum, remaining mapped to 47.1.

==Newscasts==
In 2012, Telemundo Atlanta began offering a full local news service with newscasts at 6 and 11 p.m.; the station had previously produced three daily 90-second news briefs prior to the expansion. A 5:30 p.m. newscast was added in 2015. Telemundo Atlanta&#x27;s news was originally helmed by local anchor Jorge Buzo, now of WUVC-DT in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Luis Estrada is the anchor of &quot;Noticiero Telemundo Atlanta&quot;.

==Subchannels==
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
The WKTB-CD feed on the WANF multiplex uses channel 47.1.

<text>The Ōreti River (formerly the Oreti River) is one of the main rivers of Southland, New Zealand, and is long. The river has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because, for much of its length, it supports breeding colonies of black-billed gulls.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;place of the snare&quot; for . In November 2019, the name of the river was officially altered to Ōreti River.

The Ōreti has its headwaters close to the Mavora Lakes between Lake Te Anau and Lake Wakatipu, and flows south across the Southland Plains to its outflow into Foveaux Strait at the southeastern end of Oreti Beach. En route, it runs through the towns of Lumsden and Winton, before passing through the city of Invercargill, close to the river&#x27;s estuary.

For the final part of the river&#x27;s length, around the city of Invercargill and the river&#x27;s estuary just south of the city, it is locally known as the New River, a name occasionally encountered to refer to the whole river. It shares this estuary with several smaller rivers, most notably the Waihopai River.
The New River Estuary, which meets the end of the Ōreti River before it reaches the sea, is in decline. Recent science reports show that regions of the upper estuary are under stress and showing eutrophication. There is excessive macroalgal growth including sediment quality decline and high concentrations of chlorophyll-a in the water column. Chlorophyll-a was used as an indicator of eutrophic conditions in the water column, and is a colour pigment present in many types of algae that can give an indication of how much algae is present in the water column.

The Invercargill Rowing Club relocated to the river in 1958.

<doc id="1101171" wikidata="Q6070409" url="?curid=1101171" title="Iris subg. Limniris">
<text>Subgenus Limniris is one subgenus of beardless irises, which don&#x27;t have hairs on their drooping sepals, also called their &quot;fall&quot;s.

&#x27;Limniris&#x27; is derived from the Latin for marsh or living-in-lakes iris, or pond iris. This refers to the fact that most species can be grown in moist habitats for part of the year.

It was originally described by Tausch in Deut. Bot. Herb.-Buch (Deutsche Botaniker) in 1841. Édouard Spach made changes 1846 in Ann. Sci. Nat., Bot. (Annales des Sciences Naturelles; Botanique).

It was divided into sections, &#x27;Limniris&#x27;, which is further divided down to about 16 series, and &#x27;Lophiris&#x27; (also known as &#x27;Evansias&#x27; or crested iris). They are both polyphyletic.
It has 45 species, which are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere.

It is a group that has been recognized with few changes since Dykes&#x27;s 1913 monograph on the genus &quot;Iris&quot;. Lawrence (1953), Rodionenko (1987) and then Mathew (1989) all tried to modify the group.
Various authors have tried to classify the list in various ways. It is still undergoing study and variations.

<doc id="1101175" wikidata="Q6946313" url="?curid=1101175" title="My Ride's Here">
<text>My Ride&#x27;s Here is the eleventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Warren Zevon. The album was released on May 7, 2002, by Artemis Records. Zevon described it as &quot;a meditation on death&quot;; it was released several months before Zevon was diagnosed with terminal mesothelioma.

On &quot;My Ride&#x27;s Here&quot;, Zevon collaborated with a number of writers from outside the world of music. The song &quot;Basket Case&quot; features in Carl Hiaasen&#x27;s novel of the same name where it was performed by a fictional rock band. He also covers Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;Laissez-Moi Tranquille&quot; which roughly translates as &quot;leave me alone&quot;. Gainsbourg first recorded it in 1960 on the &quot;Romantique 60&quot; EP. &quot;I Have to Leave&quot; was a song written by Zevon&#x27;s high school friend, Dan McFarland.

==Reception==
Mark Deming of AllMusic rated &quot;My Ride&#x27;s Here&quot; two out of five stars. He stated that &quot;the jokes tend to be a bit obvious&quot;, and that &quot;the more introspective moments don&#x27;t connect the way one might hope&quot;. However, he said that some of the tracks &quot;are strong enough to remind listeners of just how talented Zevon still is&quot;. He concluded by saying that the album &quot;is a misfire from an artist capable of much better work.&quot; Robert Christgau rated the album an A−, stating that Zevon was &quot;at his best in the fictional-mythic mode that prevails&quot;.

<doc id="1101182" wikidata="Q2127546" url="?curid=1101182" title="Stanol ester">
<text>Stanol esters is a heterogeneous group of chemical compounds known to reduce the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in blood when ingested, though to a much lesser degree than prescription drugs such as statins. The starting material is phytosterols from plants. These are first hydrogenated to give a plant stanol (phytostanol) which is then esterified with a mixture of fatty acids also derived from plants. Plant stanol esters are found naturally, occurring in small quantities in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, cereals, legumes, and vegetable oils.

Stanol ester is often added to rapeseed oil-based margarine or other foods for its health benefits. Studies have indicated that consumption of about 2-3 grams per day provides a reduction in LDL cholesterol of about 10-15%.

The compound itself passes through the gut, with very little entering the blood stream or lymph. Its presence in the gut, however, reduces both the amount of cholesterol the body absorbs from food and the reabsorption of the cholesterol component of bile. Despite a well documented cholesterol lowering effect, there are no data available indicating that functional foods supplemented with plant sterol esters reduce cardiovascular events. They are used in food products such as Benecol.

Sterol esters can also be used for the same purpose. These compounds have the same effect to LDL, but they are partially absorbed by the body. The effects of higher serum plant sterol levels are so far not completely understood.

== Plant stanols in nature ==
Plant sterols are cholesterol-like molecules found in all plant foods, with the highest concentrations occurring in vegetable oils. Plant sterols are plant equivalents of cholesterol and have a very similar molecular structure. According to their structure, they can be divided into sterols and stanols, stanols being a saturated subgroup of sterols.

== Plant stanols in human nutrition ==

Plant stanols are present in small amounts in human diet. Their main sources are whole-grain foods, mostly wheat and rye. The daily intake of stanols in the average western diet is about 60 mg/d, whereas the intake of plant sterols is about 150–300 mg/d and that of cholesterol is 500–800 mg/d. The relatively low natural levels of stanols in the diet are too low to have a significant effect on serum cholesterol levels.

Following evidence from toxicological studies and numerous clinical trials, stanols are characterised as safe by authorities in several European Union countries and by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

==Structure and properties==
Stanol esters are a saturated subgroup of sterol esters. Plant stanol esters in Benecol products are fatty acid esters of plant sterols. The sterol part of the molecule is sitostanol or campestanol while the fatty acid residue originates from different vegetable oils.

Plant stanol esters have the following physical properties:
* Fat-like with a waxy texture
* Creamy white colour in the solid form
* Viscous clear liquid with a bright yellow colour, bland odour and taste
* Insoluble in water and soluble in fat (hydrophobic)
* Viscosity higher than that of the triglyceride oil with the same fatty acid composition.

These physical properties can be tailored by changing the fatty acid composition. In different technological applications of Benecol products, the fatty acid part is selected so that the melting properties, texture and other characteristics of the plant stanol ester closely resemble the properties of the fat it replaces.

==Oxidative and processing stability==
Under normal storage and food preparation conditions, plant stanol esters are very stable because they are more resistant to oxidation than the commonest vegetable oils.

Using plant stanol esters in food applications instead of conventional fats does not decrease the shelf life of the end product. As is the case for all fats and oils, stanol esters should be protected from heat, air and light to prevent oxidation. If long-term storage is required, plant stanol esters are typically refrigerated in solid form. Furthermore, the usual antioxidants can be added to plant stanol ester products as they are to other oils or fats to minimise oxidation.

==Lowering cholesterol==

Esterified plant stanols have been proven to reduce cholesterol in a number of randomised, placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trials. However absolutely no effect on clinical endpoints such as CVD or mortality was demonstrated.

==Dual effect of plant stanols==
Plant stanols reduce both cholesterol and plant sterol levels in serum. This may be of importance since elevated plant sterol concentrations have been identified as an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Two ABC transporters (ABCG5 and ABCG8) play an important role in the regulating the intestinal absorption of plant sterols by resecreting previously absorbed plant sterols from the enterocytes back into the intestinal lumen.

Mutations in these transporter proteins lead to a rare congenital disease called sitosterolaemia, which is characterised by:
* severely elevated serum plant sterol concentrations,
* normal to moderately increased serum cholesterol concentrations, and
* a high risk of developing CHD at a very early age.

It was recently shown that polymorphisms in the ABCG5 and ABCG8 genes contribute to modifying serum plant sterol levels in healthy, non-sitosterolaemic individuals. Furthermore, several epidemiological studies have shown that the risk of developing heart disease seems to be increased even at more &quot;normal&quot; plant sterol levels. Since statins were shown to increase serum plant sterol concentrations, patients should probably not be treated with statins alone but with a combination therapy focusing simultaneously on improving the serum lipoprotein profile and lowering serum plant sterol concentrations.

===Cholesterol absorption===
The molecular mode of actions of stanols has been described in several preclinical and clinical trials and can be divided into two steps:
* Step 1: Cholesterol absorption occurs via the formation of micelles with bile acids. Stanols displace cholesterol from these micelles so that less cholesterol is absorbed. Stanols need to be taken as part of a meal in order to be incorporated in the micelles.
* Step 2: In vitro studies have shown that stanols activate LXR alpha, LXR beta and ABCA1 transporter proteins. It is thus hypothesised that stanols work in enterocytes by activating the excretion of cholesterol back into the intestinal lumen. Only stanols have been proven to retain their efficacy in long-term use, most likely due to the minimal absorption of stanols, and consequently their lack of effect on bile acid metabolism.

As a consequence of the reduced absorption of cholesterol, the absorption of fat-soluble components other than cholesterol, such as vitamins and antioxidants, may also be reduced. Like cholesterol, carotenoids and tocopherols are transported by lipoproteins. Since the number of LDL particles in circulation decreases after consumption of plant sterols or stanols, plasma concentrations of carotenoids and tocopherols also decrease. This is why these antioxidants are often standardized to plasma lipid concentrations.

The results of randomised, placebo-controlled trials on the effects of plant sterols or stanols on fat-soluble vitamins and antioxidants were summarised in 2003. Significant reductions were only seen in clinical trials for hydrocarbon carotenoids. These reductions are probably caused by reduced absorption and lower plasma concentrations of the carrier, LDL.

After correcting for cholesterol levels, only the reduction in the β-carotene level remained. It is important, however, that carotenoid and tocopherol levels remained within the normal ranges. Clinical trials also showed that when following the recommended diet, including consumption of vegetables and fruit, carotenoid levels did not decrease. Plasma concentrations of retinol (vitamin A), 25-hydroxyvitamin D and vitamin K are unaffected by dietary plant sterols and stanols.

<doc id="1101184" wikidata="Q4825026" url="?curid=1101184" title="Australian immigration detention facilities">
<text>Australian immigration detention facilities comprise a number of different facilities throughout Australia, including the Australian territory of Christmas Island. Such facilities also exist in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, namely the Nauru Regional Processing Centre and the Manus Regional Processing Centre.

They are currently used to detain people who are under Australia&#x27;s policy of mandatory immigration detention. Asylum seekers detected in boats in Australian waters have been detained in facilities on the offshore islands of Nauru and Manus Island, previously under the now defunct Pacific Solution and (since 2013 and ) under Operation Sovereign Borders.

The facilities&#x27; existence is controversial and has been condemned on human rights grounds and have even been likened to concentration camps by some critics and human rights groups. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has cited these centres as a &quot;damning indictment of a policy meant to avoid Australia&#x27;s international obligations&quot;.

==Background==
The &quot;Migration Act 1958&quot; allowed discretionary detention of unauthorised arrivals until 1992. Since the 1990s when the Keating government created a policy of mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals, with non-citizens arriving by boat without a valid visa being detained until they were either granted a visa, or deported.

Towards the end of the 1990s, a large increase in the number of unauthorised arrivals exceeded the capacity of the existing Immigration Reception and Processing Centres (IRPCs) at Port Hedland and Curtin.

==Facilities==
===Immigration Detention Centres (IDCs)===
Immigration detention centres detain people who have overstayed their visa, breached their visa conditions and had their visa cancelled or have been refused entry at Australia&#x27;s entry ports. This includes irregular maritime arrivals claiming asylum without passports, identity papers or valid entry visas. Under the Migration Act 1958, people arriving in this manner are classed as unlawful non-citizens and are currently subject to mandatory detention. However, in 1954 the Australian government ratified the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Under Article 31 of the convention, the Australian government is legally obligated to grant anyone fleeing persecution and seeking asylum the right to enter the country by whatever means possible. Furthermore, the Article states that signatory countries are not to impose penalties on or indefinitely restrict the freedom of movement of those seeking asylum.

Australia&#x27;s Migration Act 1958 requires people who are not Australian citizens and who are unlawfully in Australia to be detained. Unless they are given legal permission to remain in Australia by being granted a visa, unlawful non-citizens must be removed from Australia as soon as reasonably practicable. The Australian government claims that immigration detention is not used to punish people. Instead, they claim it is an administrative function whereby people who do not have a valid visa are detained while their claims to stay are considered or their removal is facilitated.

There are, or were, centres located at:
* Maribyrnong, established at Melbourne in 1966, closed in 2019.
* Villawood, established at Sydney in 1976.
* Perth, established in 1981.
* North West Point, Christmas Island, established 2001.
* Northern, established at Darwin in 2001, closed.
* Baxter, near Port Augusta, SA, established 2002, closed 2007.
* Brisbane, established in 2007 as Brisbane Immigration Transit Accommodation 
* Melbourne, established in 2008 as Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation
* Wickham Point, established at Darwin in 2011, closed in 2016.
* Curtin, near Derby, WA, reopened in 2010, closed in 2014.
* Scherger, near Weipa, Queensland, opened 2010, closed 2014.
* Adelaide, established in 2011 as Adelaide Immigration Transit Accommodation
* Yongah Hill, near Northam, WA, established in 2012.

===Immigration Residential Housing (IRH) ===
Immigration residential housing was a previously used form of immigration detention, which provided an option for accommodating people in independent family-style housing in a community setting while still formally being detained. This type of facility was one of several types of alternative residential accommodation for detained people, subject to them meeting eligibility criteria. They were previously located in:
* Perth
* Sydney
* Port Augusta

===Immigration Transit Accommodation (ITA) ===
Immigration Transit Accommodation was a form of immigration detention used until July 2023. The Brisbane Immigration Transit Accommodation opened in November 2007 and the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation opened in June 2008. Further immigration transit accommodation opened in Adelaide in 2011. ITCs were for short-term, low-risk detainees, however the Melbourne facility was extended with a high-security compound in 2018. 
* Brisbane (now Brisbane Immigration Detention Centre)
* Melbourne (now Melbourne Immigration Detention Centre)
* Adelaide (now Melbourne Immigration Detention Centre)

===Alternative Places of Detention (APOD)===
Alternative Places of Detention (APOD) can accommodate any person who is in immigration detention. APOD may range from hospital accommodation in cases of necessary medical treatment, rented accommodation in the community (hotel rooms, apartments), or accommodation in the community made available through arrangements with other government departments. They may be located in all parts of Australia, including Christmas Island.


===Pacific Solution facilities===
Since the implementation of the Pacific Solution Australia also funded immigration detention centres on:
* Manus Regional Processing Centre, Papua New Guinea closed in February 2008, re-opened on 22 November 2012 (re-closed on 23 November 2017).
* Nauru Regional Processing Centre closed in February 2008, re-opened in 2012.

===Services to immigration centres===

Most facilities were operated by Australasian Correctional Management (a subsidiary of G4S) under contract from the Department of Immigration until 2003, when ACM exited the market. Between 2003 and 2009, G4S was appointed as the contractor to manage a large number of facilities. Its contract was not renewed and in 2009 Serco Australia was awarded a five-year contract.

Manus Regional Processing Centre was operated by the International Organization for Migration, then by G4S, then by Broadspectrum (formerly Transfield) with security sub-contracted to Wilson Security.

Nauru Regional Processing Centre was operated by Broadspectrum and Wilson Security, and then later by Canstruct International (with a $591 million contract) and finally by a Nauruan Government Commercial Entity.

The 3 new immigration detention facilities in Lorengau on Manus Island have security and some services provided by Paladin Group under a contract worth more than $423 million.

Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre was once operated by G4S but is now operated by Serco as of April 2019.

==Controversy==
The facilities have been a source of much controversy during their time of operation. There have been a number of riots and escapes, as well as accusations of human rights abuses from organisations such as refugee advocates, Amnesty International, the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Human Rights Watch, and the United Nations. Journalists are forbidden from entering the detention centres.

In January 2014, the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens accused the government of a cover-up over a violent clash on 18 October 2013 at the Manus Island facility between the Papua New Guinea army and the Papua New Guinea police mobile squad hired for the facility&#x27;s security, leading to Australian expatriate staff being evacuated, while local staff and asylum seekers remained. On 5 May 2014, it was reported that several Salvation Army staffers had alleged that refugees were regularly subjected to beatings, racial slurs, and sexual assaults within the facility.

In March 2002, Irene Khan, the Secretary General of Amnesty International, said:

===Refugee &quot;swap&quot; with the United States===
In 2016 the Australian government announced an intention to exchange some proven refugees from either Nauru and/or Manus Island for certain displaced people presently in Central America as part of an agreement with the Obama administration of the United States.

In early 2017 Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that he was confident the agreement would proceed, despite the change of President to Donald Trump. However, latest information appears to cast doubt on the willingness of the US government to honour any such agreement, especially in light of Trump&#x27;s executive order suspending entry to the US from several countries.

On 2 February 2017 Australian news outlets, quoting the Washington Post, reported that a telephone conversation between Trump and Turnbull had been acrimonious in relation to the &quot;swap&quot;, and that Trump had terminated the call ahead of time. Trump has expressed admiration over the detention facilities, opining that the US should do the same.

On 4 February 2019 the remaining 4 children who had been detained on Nauru were sent to the U.S.

In May 2019, it was revealed that some of the U.S. detainees sent to Australia in the &quot;swap&quot;, were Rwandan men, former members of the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda, who had been accused of mass-murdering tourists in 1999. They had been held in U.S. immigration detention for over 15 years, but were on the verge of being released into the U.S. after a court ruled that their confessions had been obtained by torture. In November 2018 the men were secretly brought to Australia. The Turnbull government knew about the allegations against the men when they agreed to accept them. The Australian and U.S. Governments initially refused to comment on the matter, but later Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that the men had been assessed by security agencies.

The former New Zealand foreign affairs minister Gerry Brownlee described Australia&#x27;s behaviour as &quot;incredibly insensitive&quot; and said that New Zealand would have &quot;appreciated a heads up&quot; that Australia was about to resettle men accused of brutally murdering two New Zealanders [among others].

===Suicide and self-harm attempts increase on Manus===
After the Australian Liberal Party were re-elected in the 2019 Australian federal election, reports of despair and attempted self-harm and suicide were reported from Manus. The men had hoped with Labor in government, the New Zealand offer would be accepted and they would at last be resettled. By 4 June there had been at least 26 attempts at suicide or self-harm by men in the Lorengau camps and Port Moresby (in the hospital and accommodation for sick asylum seekers). The PNG paramilitary police squad was deployed around one of the camps in an attempt to deter suicide and self-harm attempts. Lorengau general hospital has been handling many of the self-harm and suicide cases, despite the Australian government contract with Pacific International Health (PIH), because of the seriousness of the cases. The police commander commented that they were doing all they could, but severe mental illness arose because of the effect of long-term detention on the men.

<doc id="1101189" wikidata="Q3596209" url="?curid=1101189" title="'Merican">
<text>″Merican is an EP by the American punk rock band Descendents, released February 10, 2004. It was the band&#x27;s first release for Fat Wreck Chords and served as a pre-release to their sixth studio album &quot;Cool to Be You&quot;, released the following month. The EP includes two songs from the album: &quot;Nothing with You&quot; and Merican&quot;, and three B-sides from the album&#x27;s sessions: &quot;Here with Me&quot;, &quot;I Quit&quot;, and the hidden track &quot;Alive&quot;. &quot;″Merican&quot; marked the first release of new studio material from the Descendents since 1996&#x27;s &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; and was their third release ever to chart, peaking at number 29 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Independent Albums chart and at number 38 on Top Heatseekers.

== Background and recording ==
In 1987, Descendents singer Milo Aukerman had left the band to pursue a career in biochemistry. The remaining members—bassist Karl Alvarez, guitarist Stephen Egerton, and drummer Bill Stevenson—changed the band&#x27;s name to All and released eight albums on Cruz Records and Interscope Records between 1988 and 1995 with singers Dave Smalley, Scott Reynolds, and Chad Price. Aukerman contributed occasional songwriting and backing vocals, and in 1995 decided to return to music. The members decided to operate as two bands, working with Aukerman as the Descendents and with Price as All. Both bands signed to Epitaph Records and the Descendents released &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; in 1996. Following the album&#x27;s supporting tours Aukerman had returned to his science career, though he recorded backing vocals for All&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Mass Nerder&quot;. All also released &quot;Problematic&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Live Plus One&quot; in 2001, a double live album that included a Descendents disc recorded in 1996.

The recording sessions for the Descendents&#x27; sixth studio album &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; took place with Aukerman in February 2002 at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with additional recording done in April at Planet of Sound in Wilmington, Delaware, and were produced by Stevenson. The band recorded the music for the songs live in the studio with minimal overdubbing, and Aukerman&#x27;s vocals were recorded over the instrumental tracks. However, these recordings were not released for another two years. Stevenson explained that the gap of eight years between Descendents albums was due to the band members having children, and his father&#x27;s death.

== Release ==
For the releases of &quot;″Merican&quot; and &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; the Descendents signed to Fat Wreck Chords. Label head and musician Fat Mike was a longtime fan of the band, and his enthusiasm for working with them was a major factor in their decision to sign to the label. Stevenson commented that &quot;If you&#x27;ve got the owner of the label saying he wants to put out a record by what is probably his favorite band of all time, that&#x27;s rad. That&#x27;s the best possible position for a band to be in.&quot; The &quot;″Merican&quot; EP was released in February 2004, followed by the full-length album in March. Stevenson remarked that the EP served as a teaser for &quot;Cool to Be You&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s funny because, from the old Descendents fan&#x27;s point of view, it&#x27;s kind of like &#x27;What? Why did they put out this EP? It doesn&#x27;t even have the best songs on it. I waited seven years for this?&#x27; But from the newer kids perspective, it&#x27;s more like, hey let&#x27;s try to introduce this new decade of kids to Descendents so it&#x27;s at least on the tip of their tongue when the album comes out.&quot; &quot;″Merican&quot; was released on both compact disc and extended play formats, each with a different cover, drawn by Jeff Hagedorn, depicting the band&#x27;s Milo character dressed as Uncle Sam.

== Themes ==
The songs on &quot;″Merican&quot; address topics including love and relationships, sociopolitical commentary, and frustrations with life in a touring band. Aukerman remarked that &quot;there&#x27;s no part of the &quot;″Merican&quot; EP that is a retread of anything we&#x27;ve done in the past. Some of the songs are major departures for us, like &#x27;Here with Me,&#x27; and the hidden track &#x27;Alive.&#x27; Even the title song is actually a stretch for us; if you look back on all the songs we have done, there are very few that have any &#x27;political&#x27; content in them.&quot; Merican&quot; addresses positive and negative aspects of American history, celebrating cultural figures such as Otis Redding, Duke Ellington, and Walt Whitman while condemning slavery, Joseph McCarthy, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Vietnam War.

&quot;I Quit&quot; was written by Aukerman about the frustrations of being in a band and on the road, with lyrics such as &quot;Sick all the time, I miss my wife / I quit / Got better things to do with my life / I quit&quot;. Aukerman explained of the song:
I can&#x27;t even count the number of times I&#x27;ve quit this band, dating back to 1982 and &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot;! Like most of my songs, &quot;I Quit&quot; is my attempt to capture those emotions that come and go, the transient ones. Those types of emotions, to me, make for the best songs because they tend to be extreme! So there is no &quot;message&quot; to the song, just me spewing about the negative aspects of band life. At the time I wrote the song, I really did want to quit. I don&#x27;t really care how people take the song; as the line says, &quot;I don&#x27;t give a flying fuck what you think of me.&quot;
==Reception==
&quot;″Merican&quot; became the third Descendents release to chart (following &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; and &quot;Live Plus One&quot;), peaking at number 29 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Independent Albums chart and at number 38 on Top Heatseekers. John Luerssen of AllMusic remarked that &quot;Nothing with You&quot; &quot;revisit[s] the timeless lovelorn attack of cherished songs from their past like &#x27;Wendy,&#x27; &#x27;Clean Sheets,&#x27; and &#x27;Silly Girl, while Merican&quot; &quot;harks back to vintage Bad Religion&quot; and &quot;I Quit&quot; is &quot;a nervous, edgy &#x27;Catalina&#x27;-like throwback&quot;. He was less complimentary about the other two songs, calling &quot;Here with Me&quot; merely a &quot;palatable midtempo number&quot; and &quot;Alive&quot; &quot;worth skipping, as it drags in a way that no Descendents number has a right to.&quot;

== Trivia ==
&quot;Here With Me&quot; was originally written in 1989 by Milo and first played with his short lived band Milestone.

<text>Chloraseptic is an American brand of oral analgesic that is produced by Tarrytown, New York–based Prestige Consumer Healthcare, and is used for the relief of sore throat and mouth pain. Its active ingredient is phenol (just in Sore Throat Spray, not in Sore Throat Lozenges), a compound whose antiseptic properties were discovered by Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge.

Other Chloraseptic formulas are based on benzocaine.

== History ==
Chloraseptic was invented and originally made by Robert Schattner (born Isaac Schattner; 1925-2017); it was later bought by Richardson-Vicks, which merged with Cincinnati, Ohio–based Procter &amp; Gamble in 1985.

== Products ==
Its current spray products include Cherry Throat Spray, MAX Wild Berry Targeted Throat Spray, Menthol Throat Spray, Warming Honey Lemon Throat Spray, Cherry On-The-Go Throat Spray, and Citrus Throat Spray.

Its current lozenge products include MAX Wild Berry, TOTAL Wild Cherry, Cherry with Soothing Liquid Center, TOTAL Sugar-Free Wild Cherry, Citrus with Soothing Liquid Center, and Warming Honey Lemon.

<text>Iris&quot; ser. &quot;Longipetalae is a series of the genus &quot;Iris&quot;, in &quot;Iris&quot; subg. &quot;Limniris&quot;.

William Rickatson Dykes in his book &#x27;Handbook of Garden Irises&#x27; (of 1924) includes 4 species in his Iris longipetala subsection; including &quot;Iris longipetala&quot; (Herbert), &quot;Iris missouriensis&quot; Nuttall, &quot;Iris arizonica&quot; (Dykes, 1917) and &quot;Iris montana&quot; (Nuttall). &quot;Iris arizonica&quot; and &quot;Iris montana&quot; have since been classified as synonyms of &quot;Iris missouriensis&quot;.

The series was then first classified as a &#x27;series&#x27; by Diels in &#x27;Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien&#x27; (Edited by H. G. A. Engler and K. Prantl) in 1930. It was further expanded by Lawrence in Gentes Herb (written in Dutch) in 1953.

There is still a lot of confusion within the series.

The British Iris Society only lists &quot;Iris missouriensis&quot; and classes &quot;Iris longipetala&quot; as a variant of &quot;Iris missouriensis&quot;.
The American Iris Society and Pacific Iris Society lists three species; &quot;Iris longipetala&quot; (Herbert), &quot;Iris missouriensis&quot; (Nuttall) and &quot;Iris pariensis&quot; (Welsh). But Plant List regards &quot;Iris pariensis&quot; as a synonym of &quot;Iris missouriensis&quot;. 
&quot;Iris pariensis&quot; was found by Stanley Larson Welsh in Utah and published in &#x27;Great Basin Naturalist&#x27; 46(2): 256 in 1986.

The series has species are native to western North America, seen in Washington (state), Oregon and California.

They prefer to have moisture in the spring and a dry period during the summer. They also do not like root disturbance hence they are difficult to grow as nursery plants. They are also rarely grown in the UK. The species have thick rhizomes, fruiting stems (that follow the flowers) that stay on the plant until the next growing season, (or longer) a stigma with 2 teeth (or lobes) and seed capsules with 6 ribs and taper into points on the ends.

<text>Annandale () is a strath in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, named after the dale of the River Annan. It runs north–south through the Southern Uplands from Annanhead (north of Moffat) to Annan on the Solway Firth, and in its higher reaches it separates the Moffat hills on the east from the Lowther hills to the west. A long-distance walking route called Annandale Way running through Annandale (from the source of the River Annan to the sea) was opened in September 2009.

==History==
Annandale was also an historic district of Scotland, bordering Liddesdale to the east, Nithsdale to the west, Clydesdale and Tweeddale to the north and the Solway Firth to the south. The district which was in the Sheriffdom of Dumfries and later became part of the County of Dumfries, one of the counties of Scotland. The main reorganisation took place during the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, which established a uniform system of county councils and town councils in Scotland and restructured many of Scotland&#x27;s counties. (See: History of local government in the United Kingdom). It is one of three subdivisions of Dumfriesshire, along with Eskdale (previously part of Liddesdale) and Nithsdale.

It is famous for its connection with Ben Jonson and Robert the Bruce, as the de Brus family was given this land by David I in 1124, as one of the border lordships when David became Prince of the Cumbrians. Along with Carrick, these lands acted as a buffer between the quasi-independent Lordship or Kingdom of Galloway and David&#x27;s lands of Strathclyde and Cumbria.

<doc id="1101220" wikidata="Q731775" url="?curid=1101220" title="Cazuza">
<text>Agenor de Miranda Araújo Neto, better known as Cazuza (; April 4, 1958 – July 7, 1990), was a Brazilian singer and songwriter, born in Rio de Janeiro. Along with Raul Seixas, Renato Russo and Os Mutantes, Cazuza, both while fronting Barão Vermelho and at solo career, is considered one of the best exponents of Brazilian rock music. In his 9-year career, he sold more than 5 million albums and achieved 11 number one singles and 18 Top 10 singles in Brazil.

==Biography==

===Early life and influences===
Son of the record producer João Araújo and the amateur singer Maria Lúcia Araújo, Cazuza always had close contact with music. Influenced since early childhood by the strong values of Brazilian music, he had a special preference for the sad, dramatic overtones of Cartola, Lupicinio Rodrigues, Dolores Duran, and Maysa. He began to write lyrics and poems around 1965. In late 1974, a vacation in London, England, acquainted him with the music of Led Zeppelin, Janis Joplin and The Rolling Stones, and he soon became a great fan. Cazuza enrolled in college in 1978, but abandoned the course of journalism three weeks later to work with his father at Som Livre. He moved later to San Francisco, where he came in contact with Beat literature, becoming highly influenced by it.

===Barão Vermelho===
In 1980 he returned to Rio, where he worked with the theatrical group &quot;Asdrúbal Trouxe o Trombone&quot; (Asdrúbal Brought the Trombone). There he was noticed by the novice singer/composer Léo Jaime, who introduced him to a beginning rock band that needed a vocalist, the Barão Vermelho (Red Baron). With this very successful eighties Brazilian rock band, who had their greatest success with &quot;Bete Balanço&quot;, a song that was part of the soundtrack of a film, Cazuza began his career as a singer. In 1985, Cazuza took part in Rock in Rio with Barão Vermelho, and around this time, Caetano Veloso claimed he was the greatest Brazilian poet of his generation. It was also in this same year that Cazuza was infected with the AIDS virus, precipitating his desire to leave the band to obtain a greater freedom in composition and expression, both musically and lyrically.

===Solo career===
After he left the band, Cazuza&#x27;s music began to diversify, incorporating elements of the blues in songs such as &quot;Blues da Piedade&quot; (Blues of Compassion), &quot;Só as mães são felizes&quot; (Only Mothers Are Happy) and &quot;Balada da Esplanada&quot; (Ballad of the Esplanade), which was based on a poem of the same name by Oswald de Andrade; showcasing increasingly intimate lyrics, like those in &quot;Só se for a Dois&quot; (Just the two of us), as well as opening itself up to influences from Brazilian pop music with interpretations of Cartola&#x27;s &quot;O Mundo é um Moinho&quot; (The World is a Windmill), Raul Seixas&#x27;s &quot;Cavalos Calados&quot; (Silent Horses) and Caetano Veloso&#x27;s &quot;Esse Cara&quot; (This Guy).

Cazuza&#x27;s solo career proved to be more successful than that of his former group. &quot;Exagerado&quot; (Exaggerated), &quot;O Tempo não Pára&quot; (Time Doesn&#x27;t Stop), and &quot;Ideologia&quot; (Ideology) were his greatest hits and proved to be a great influence on subsequent Brazilian musicians.

Cazuza co-wrote the song &quot;Preciso Dizer que Te Amo&quot; with Bebel Gilberto which was released in 1986 on her self-titled EP. The song was also featured posthumously in the 1996 AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Rio produced by the Red Hot Organization in a duet with Bebel Gilberto.

===Final years===
In 1989, he admitted publicly for the first time that he had AIDS and released his last album in life: &quot;Burguesia&quot;. Cazuza was openly bisexual but was not active in the LGBT movement. However, his openness about being a person with AIDS helped to change public perceptions and attitudes about HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment.

===Death===

Cazuza died in Rio de Janeiro on July 7, 1990, at the age of 32, due to a septic shock caused by AIDS. He was buried at the Cemitério São João Batista in Botafogo, Rio de Janeiro. Cazuza&#x27;s mother set up the Viva Cazuza Society (&quot;Sociedade Viva Cazuza&quot;), a charity which sponsors AIDS prevention and provides a home for HIV-positive children

==Other media==
A biopic starring Daniel de Oliveira and directed by Sandra Werneck called &quot;Cazuza: O Tempo não Para&quot; (&quot;Cazuza: Time Doesn&#x27;t Stop&quot;) was released in 2004.

In 2014, the biographic musical Cazuza – Pro Dia Nascer Feliz opened in São Paulo. It featured songs from Cazuza&#x27;s solo career as well as from his time as frontman of Barão Vermelho. The musical starring Emílio Dantas was directed by João Fonseca and toured Brazil for two years.

<text>Charles Tracy Rowlett (; born June 16, 1942), known professionally as Tracy Rowlett, is an American journalist, formerly anchor and managing editor of the CBS owned and operated station in Dallas-Fort Worth, KTVT.

Rowlett&#x27;s last broadcast with KTVT was at 5pm on July 11, 2008. He moved to a start-up web news site called Shale.TV, focusing on the development of natural gas plays across the U.S. The site was owned by Branded News of Oklahoma City, but sponsored by Chesapeake Energy. In October 2008, prior to start up, Chesapeake withdrew funding and the site folded.

Rowlett earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Wichita State University in broadcasting and journalism, and received his master&#x27;s degree from the University of Texas at Dallas.

He began his career as a sports reporter for the &quot;Wichita Beacon&quot; in Wichita, Kansas. He later served in the Air Force, where he was editor of the base newspaper. He was later transferred to Wheelus Air Base in Tripoli, where he worked for Armed Forces Radio and Television.

When John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Rowlett was still serving at Tripoli, and broke the news of the assassination to that part of the middle east. Over the next three days and nights, he reported events surrounding the assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald&#x27;s murder, and President Kennedy&#x27;s funeral.

After Rowlett&#x27;s military discharge, he worked at KFH radio, and as news director for KAKE radio and television in Wichita. He went on to become news director at KMNS in Sioux City, Iowa, and later as the State Capitol correspondent for KTOK Radio in Oklahoma City, and the Oklahoma News Network.

In April 1974, he moved to the Dallas/Fort Worth area, working as an investigative reporter for WFAA. In August, 1975, he was teamed with Iola Johnson to anchor the 6 and 10 p.m. news. Tracy left WFAA in 1999 to become the main anchor at KTVT (CBS11), where he and Iola would team up again for the station&#x27;s inaugural 4pm newscast from September 2000-September 2002.

Tracy Rowlett received more than 100 awards during his career, including two duPont-Columbia Awards, several Emmy Awards, as well as various Associated Press and United Press International awards.

He is very involved in the Dallas/Fort Worth community, serving on various boards for local organizations, and has received many community awards for his charity works.

<text>Swami Shambhavananda (1894–1972) was an Indian Hindu monk who pioneered beekeeping in Kodagu and secondary education in Mysore.

Born in Halugunda village in the Thelapanda family of Kodagu as Chengappa, Shambhavananda joined the Ramakrishna Order at its Bangalore center in 1917. He was an initiated disciple of Swami Brahmananda and ordained into sannyas in 1924.

Shambhavananda was the first president of the Ramakrishna Saradashrama in Ponnampet, Kodagu. In 1941, he became president of Sri Ramakrishna Ashrama, Mysore, holding that position until he died. He was also a trustee of the Ramakrishna Math and a member of the governing body of the Ramakrishna Mission.

In Mysore Shambhavananda founded Sri Ramakrishna Vidyashala, a renowned residential school for boys. He also established the Vedanta College or the Ramakrishna Institute of Moral and Spiritual Education (RIMSE). His reputation was that of an efficient administrator, a strict disciplinarian, an enthusiastic colleague, and a visionary educator.

In Kodagu Shambhavananda is renowned for his effort to eradicate malaria. Singing &quot;solle paata&quot; (&quot;song of the mosquito&quot;) in Kodava Takk in the 1930s and 1940s, he walked from village to village to educate illiterate citizens about the cause and eradication of malaria.

Shambhavananda pioneered modern beekeeping in Kodagu in 1928. Beekeeping was eminently suitable to Kodagu and would contribute to the economic strength of the local people. Aided by the Karnataka government, Shambhavaanda&#x27;s effort resulted in Kodagu making rapid progress in modern beekeeping from 1931 to 1941. 
India&#x27;s first beekeepers&#x27; co-operative society was formed in Virajpet in 1936.

<text>Anthony Terrell Smith (born March 3, 1966), best known by his stage name Tone Lōc (), is an American rapper and actor. He is known for his raspy voice, his hit songs &quot;Wild Thing&quot; and &quot;Funky Cold Medina&quot;, for which he was nominated for a Grammy Award, and for being featured in &quot;We&#x27;re All in the Same Gang&quot;, a collaborative single by the West Coast Rap All-Stars.

== Early life ==
Anthony Terrell Smith was born March 3, 1966, in Los Angeles, California, the son of Margaret, who managed a retirement home, and James Smith who died in 1972. As a result of his father&#x27;s premature death, Tone Lōc and his three older brothers were raised by his mother. He was educated at the Hollywood Professional School. As a teenager, he performed with the rap group Triple A.

==Career==
=== 1989–1991: mainstream success ===
Tone Lōc&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Lōc-ed After Dark&quot;, was released in January 1989. The video for the first single, &quot;Wild Thing,&quot; became a staple on MTV in the US. The song rose to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and the top twenty in Australia. The second single, &quot;Funky Cold Medina,&quot; also became a hit. It reached the top 5 in the US, peaking at No. 3; the top ten in Australia; and the top twenty in the UK.

&quot;Lōc-ed After Dark&quot; reached No. 1 in the US. Since its release, it has been certified 2× platinum there.

Tone Lōc&#x27;s second album &quot;Cool Hand Lōc&quot; was released in November 1991. The album&#x27;s first single was &quot;All Through the Night&quot;, which found moderate success, reaching No. 80 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #16 on the Hot Rap Songs chart. It received frequent airplay on MTV and BET. He also contributed &quot;If I&#x27;m Gonna Eat Somebody&quot; for 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

=== 1994–2004: &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; franchise, and other endeavors ===
Tone Lōc played the part of police Sergeant Emilio in the film &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; (1994). Tone Lōc&#x27;s song &quot;Ace Is in the House&quot;, which samples the Beastie Boys song &quot;No Sleep till Brooklyn&quot;, is featured in the films &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot; and &quot;Ace Ventura Jr.: Pet Detective&quot; (2009).

He provided vocals for Fefe Dobson for the track &quot;Rock It Till You Drop It&quot; on her self-titled debut album.

Tone Lōc also voiced Fūd Wrapper, the host of the animatronic show Food Rocks. This was played at Epcot from 1994 to 2004. In this latter role, he sang the song &quot;Always Read the Wrapper&quot;, a parody of his second hit single &quot;Funky Cold Medina&quot;.

He appeared as Albert in episode 8 of season 2 of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, which aired November 11, 1995.

=== 1992–2016: television, film and voice acting ===
Tone Lōc has performed in several feature films, including &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;, &quot;Blank Check&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot; and &quot;Posse&quot;. As a voice actor, Tone Lōc has voiced characters in several animated television series such as &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and &quot;C Bear and Jamal&quot;, and was featured in the animated film &quot;Bebe&#x27;s Kids&quot;, playing the wise-cracking baby Pee Wee. He voiced the character Lou the Goanna in the 1992 film &quot;&quot;. He has also provided his signature voice for episodes of &quot;&quot;Chowder&quot;&quot; and &quot;Uncle Grandpa&quot;, both airing on Cartoon Network. In 2022, Tone Lōc was featured as the singing voice of Penny Proud in &quot;The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder&quot; on Disney+.

=== 2016–present: I Love the 90s Tour ===
Tone Lōc was among the list of performers on the I Love the 90s Tour, which has performed worldwide since April 2016, as well as having featured appearances on the I Love the 90s: The Party Continues Tour from July to September 2017.

==Personal life==
===Legal issues===
In December 2010, Tone Lōc was arrested for an alleged DUI. He was released on bail claiming a medical condition had caused a seizure.

On June 18, 2011, Tone Lōc was arrested for felony domestic violence and felony possession of a Colt AR-15 Sporter rifle, which is heavily restricted by California law. The weapon was not involved in the domestic incident, an altercation with the mother of one of his children. Tone Lōc was released less than three hours later after posting $50,000 bail. On October 3, 2011, he entered a plea of no contest to both charges, and was sentenced to one day in county jail, three years of probation, 52 weeks of anger management counseling and 30 days of community service.

On March 23, 2019, Tone Loc was detained by the Midland Police Department in Texas. It was later revealed that the reason for the detention was a heated argument caused when Lōc confronted someone who was wearing a Confederate battle flag baseball cap. After the two arguing parties agreed to separate, Lōc was released and no charges were filed.

===Health issues===
Tone Lōc has collapsed onstage multiple times since 1995; some if not all of these collapses have been due to seizures, according to at least one report. On May 29, 2009, he was rushed to a hospital after collapsing during a concert in Pensacola, Florida. The rapper cut his elbow when he fell and was released the same day.

On October 15, 2011, Lōc was hospitalized for exhaustion after collapsing onstage during a concert in Atlanta, Georgia. He was taken to a local hospital and intravenously rehydrated. Another similar incident occurred in 2012. On March 16, 2013, he collapsed onstage at a performance at the Bridge Bash in Des Moines, Iowa, but refused hospital care. Lōc collapsed onstage on December 6, 2013, during a performance in San Francisco, California, and collapsed again on November 26, 2016, during a performance in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, but he later returned to the stage. Lōc wears his signature sunglasses at every performance to help reduce the likelihood of a seizure.

<text>Iris&quot; series &quot;Californicae are a series of the genus &quot;Iris&quot;, in &quot;Iris&quot; subg. &quot;Limniris&quot;. They are commonly known as &quot;Pacific Coast iris&quot; (PCI), or Pacific Coast natives (PCN).

The series was first classified by Diels in &quot;&quot; (Edited by H. G. A. Engler and K. Prantl) in 1930. It was further expanded by Lawrence in &#x27;Gentes Herb&#x27; (written in Dutch) in 1953.

They all possess thin wiry, rhizomes and roots. They also have narrow, long evergreen leaves. Which are leathery and deep green.

The plants have unbranched flower stems that bear 2 or 3 flowers. The plants do clump quickly and produce many stems. They prefer acid soils. (all except &#x27;Iris douglasiana&#x27;, which prefers alkaline soils). In the wild, all the species are located on soils on slopes with good drainage. They grow at the edge of woods. They do not like root disturbance, so can be difficult to cultivate for the gardener. They can be grown in large clay pots in the UK, to be able to protect them in the winter. or they could be grown from seed, to stop root disturbance. Most flower between mid spring to early summer. April to June (in the UK). The leaves can turn red in the autumn. They have been used to create various hybrids, mostly in America.

They come from the west coast of USA, native to California, Oregon, and Washington. They are mostly dwarf in size and flower in early summer. They vary in colour depending on the species.

<text>Pink TV is Europe&#x27;s second gay satellite channel (after Italy&#x27;s GAY.tv), started in France on 25 October 2004, on a subscription basis, mostly funded by TF1 and Canal Plus terrestrial channels in France. It is now possible to access Pink TV via satellite, cable and DSL providers. Highlights include &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, as well as talkshows (including &quot;So Graham Norton&quot;). There is an X-rated film four times a week after midnight, and the channel broadcasts 24 hours per day, including productions from porn studios including French Twinks. &quot;Pink X&quot; launched in 2012 a pornographic reward, the PinkX Gay Video Awards.

==History==
On 25 October 2004, Pink TV was born on cable and satellite in the form of a pay-TV channel.

On 12 March 2007, when the channel&#x27;s accounts were bad, the Conseil supérieur de l&#x27;audiovisuel accepted the Pink TV project, which consisted of splitting the antenna into two: the day, the usual programs (cultural, entertainment, information expressing homosexual culture and lifestyles) and from midnight onwards, a service that broadcasts pornographic programs. Since 4 September 2007, Pink TV has been broadcasting free-to-air two hours a day from 10 pm to midnight. Its grid is composed only of rebroadcasts. Then, starting at midnight, it transmits encrypted until 5 am with a paying offer consisting only of X-rated movies called &quot;Pink X&quot;.

As of October 2008, the channel&#x27;s accounts have improved, it released new programs (films, documentaries, shows) alongside the rebroadcasts.

But, in 2012, fewer and fewer operators are broadcasting Pink TV in clear two hours a day. This time slot is no longer available free at Free since 2009 nor on the of Bouygues Telecom since 2012.

Also, since July 2013, Pink TV has stopped broadcasting real programs between 10 pm and midnight. Instead, it offered short-lived scenes without words played by two different couples.

At the moment, no program is offered from 22:00 to 00:00. &quot;Pink X&quot; programs start at 00:00. Launched as a chain of homosexual culture, but not having found its audience, it now only broadcasts pornographic films.

<doc id="1101258" wikidata="Q1233077" url="?curid=1101258" title="Doak Campbell Stadium">
<text>Doak S. Campbell Stadium (in full Bobby Bowden Field at Doak S. Campbell Stadium), popularly known as &quot;Doak&quot;, is a football stadium on the campus of Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida, United States. It is the home field of the Florida State Seminoles football team of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).

Opened in 1950, it was originally named Doak Campbell Stadium in honor of Doak S. Campbell, the university&#x27;s first president. On November 20, 2004, the Florida Legislature added longtime head football coach Bobby Bowden to the stadium name to become Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium. A petition in June 2020 sought to remove Campbell&#x27;s name, as he resisted racial integration while president of Florida State University. FSU President John E. Thrasher asked Athletics Director David Coburn &quot;to immediately review this issue and make recommendations to me.&quot; As of June 2022, no recommendations have been made.

The stadium is part of the University Center complex, a mixed-use facility encompassing university office space, university classrooms, the university&#x27;s Visitor Center, souvenir store, The University Center Club, now known as the Dunlap Champions Club, and skyboxes and press boxes for use during football games.

With a capacity of 79,560, it is the 49th-largest stadium in the world, the second-largest stadium in the Atlantic Coast Conference, and the 15th largest stadium in the NCAA.

==History==
The stadium, named after FSU President Doak Campbell, hosted its first game against the Randolph-Macon College Yellow Jackets on October 7, 1950, with the Seminoles winning the game 40–7. At that time the facility had a seating capacity of 15,000 in what roughly corresponds to the lower half of the current facility&#x27;s grandstands. Florida State began to play at Centennial Field during the team&#x27;s 1947 season and would continue to play there for the following two years (1948 and 1949). Florida State College – FSU&#x27;s predecessor institution – also fielded teams from 1902 to 1904 (precise location of where games were played is not documented).

Doak Campbell Stadium, with its original capacity of 15,000 in 1950, was built at a cost of $250,000. In 1954, the stadium grew to a capacity of 19,000. Six thousand more seats were added in 1961. During the Bill Peterson era (1960–70), the stadium was expanded to 40,500 seats, and it remained at that capacity for the next 14 years.

Since that time, the stadium has expanded to 82,300. This was largely in part due to the success of the football team under head coach Bobby Bowden; the stadium&#x27;s capacity more than doubled during his 33-year tenure. Its expansion was also coupled with the ever-growing student body. It now is the 2nd largest football stadium in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Aesthetically, a brick facade surrounding the stadium matches the architectural design of most of the buildings on the university&#x27;s campus. In addition to the obvious recreational uses, The University Center surrounds the stadium and houses many of the university&#x27;s offices. The field was officially named Bobby Bowden field on November 20, 2004, as Florida State hosted intrastate rival Florida. The FSU War Chant began during the Auburn game in 1983 and has since spread to be used by fans of the Atlanta Braves and Kansas City Chiefs.

===Expansion and improvements===

Following the latest expansion in 2003, the stadium has a seating capacity of 82,300. Prior to the start of the 2007 season, a new state-of-the-art sound and public address system was installed. Before the 2008 season, two new HD Scoreboards were installed; the main one in the north endzone measures over , the south endzone has a scoreboard. Six new LED ribbon boards were installed in each of the four corners of the stadium as well as underneath the north scoreboard, over the player entrance and above the entrance used by the Marching Chiefs. The new boards allow for more game stats and more information on other games in addition to improved replay viewing. An indoor practice facility, adjacent to the stadium, was constructed in 2013.

In 2023, financial recommendations saw approval by the Seminole Boosters, Inc. Board of Directors. With further approval from the FSU Board of Trustees, improvements will come by widening seats on the east and west sidelines to 18 inches. In addition to widening aisles, handrails will be added as well and legroom upped to 34 inches in select areas. The total capacity of Doak will decrease to 65–70,000 once the grand reopening begins in 2025. During the 2024 season, the total capacity was decreased to around 50,000 people due to temporary seating.

The stadium was renovated in the first part of 2016 and opened in September, prior to the 2016 season.
==Largest attendance==
==Statues and stained glass==

===Unconquered===
A 19-foot (5.8 m) tall bronze sculpture by Fritz White depicting Osceola and Renegade. A tradition was immediately put in place whereby at sunset, on the night before home football games, as the Marching Chiefs play, Osceola&#x27;s spear is set aflame as students, alumni, and fans gather around the statue to show their support. The flame is later extinguished at sunrise on the morning following the game. As of March, 2006, the university decided to light the spear for several reasons, including: selection into the NCAA basketball tournament, &quot;National Player of the Year&quot; awards for any sport, conference championships, graduations and convocations, etc. A small inscription near the base of the statue reads: &quot;This statue does not depict any particular person or event. Rather, it symbolically portrays the unconquered spirit of the Seminole people of the 19th century and the timeless legacy of that spirit that continues to burn bright into the future.&quot; The statue was unveiled at the Williams Family Plaza on October 10, 2003, and &quot;Unconquered&quot; was engraved in its stone pedestal on September 2, 2005.

===Sportsmanship===
A bronze sculpture by Edward Jonas, is a 15-foot (4.6 m) tall statue depicting a standing football player extending his arm to help up a fallen rival on the field. In 2002 it was selected by the National Sculpture Society to be showcased in its special &quot;Sports Sculpture&quot; exhibit. A one-quarter scale model represented the sculpture in the New York City exhibition. The statue is at the Al D. Strum Plaza.

===Bobby Bowden sculpture===

A 9-foot (2.7 m) tall bronze statue of head football coach Bobby Bowden, created by W. Stanley &quot;Sandy&quot; Proctor, was unveiled outside of the Coyle E. Moore Athletic Center on September 25, 2004, and was dedicated along with the Les and Ruth Akers Plaza.

===Stained glass window===
A three-story, stained-glass window commemorating the naming of the field was unveiled on November 20, 2004, the day of the annual Florida State/Florida game. The window depicts Bowden overlooking the field among a sea of fans in the stands. The window was installed over the entrance of the Moore Athletic Center. Created by Florida State artist Robert Bischoff, his wife, JoAnn, and 12 Florida State students in the Master Craftsman Program, the window is among the five largest stained glass windows in the United States.

===Seminole Family in Bronze===
This new addition to the outside of the stadium was unveiled on October 20, 2006. The statue was designed by Brad Cooley Sr. and Brad Cooley Jr. of Lamont. Known as &quot;Seminole Family in Bronze&quot;, the statue shows what may have been a typical Seminole family around the time of the Seminole Wars in the 1800s.

==University Center==

Doak Campbell is a venue in collegiate football. It is contained within the brick façade walls of University Center, a complex built around the stadium, that houses the Registrar, the School of Hospitality, the College of Communications, and the College of Social Work, as well as numerous other offices and classrooms.

University Center A (&quot;East Wing&quot;)Building A has two &quot;towers&quot; and houses the offices of the Registrar, Financial Aid, Admissions and others in one tower, and International Programs, the Dean of Students and the College of Motion Picture Arts, known commonly as the Film School, in the other. The Career Center was also located here until it is moved to the new Student Success Center. The top two floors are home to privately owned skyboxes.

University Center B (&quot;South Wing&quot;)Building B holds the Seminole Sportshop as well as Visitor Services. UCB is also home to the Dunlap Champions Club and to the Kearny Osceola Grille. The Dedman School of Hospitality is located on the second floor of Building B.

University Center C (&quot;West Wing&quot;)Building C like Building A, has two &quot;towers&quot; and is home to the College of Communication and Information, Florida State Testing Center as well as the College of Social Work. The Athletics Ticket Office is also located here as are many of the offices of the Seminole Boosters. Floor nine is home to the Press Boxes with two floors of Skyboxes below.

Moore Athletic Center (University Center D)Located on the North Side of Doak Campbell, the athletic center houses nearly all of the athletic offices as well as some classrooms and lecture halls.

<text>Princess Eleonore Caroline Gasparine Louise Reuss-Köstritz (; 22 August 1860 – 12 September 1917) was Tsaritsa (Queen) of Bulgaria, as the second wife of Ferdinand I of Bulgaria and member of the ancient House of Reuss by birth.

==Life==
Born in Trebschen Castle, in the Prussian Province of Brandenburg (present-day Poland), the daughter of Prince Heinrich IV Reuss zu Köstritz (1821-1894) and Princess Luise Caroline Reuss zu Greiz (1822-1875), widowed Princess of Saxe-Altenburg. She was also a younger sister to Prince Heinrich XXIV Reuss of Köstritz and a first cousin to Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia. Eleonore&#x27;s father Heinrich IV and Marie&#x27;s mother Auguste were brother and sister. She was described as &quot;a plain but practical... capable and kind-hearted woman.&quot;

Following the death of his first wife, Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma, Tsar Ferdinand sought another wife to carry out the official duties required of the consort of a head of state. As a man who was no longer required to produce heirs, Ferdinand stipulated to his assistant that he wanted a bride who did not expect affection or attention. 

A list of candidates was whittled down to Eleonore and she and Ferdinand subsequently married at a Catholic ceremony on 28 February 1908 at St. Augustine&#x27;s Church in Coburg and a Protestant ceremony on 1 March 1908 at Osterstein Castle, Reuss family estate. Initially titled &quot;Princess of Bulgaria&quot;, Eleonore assumed the title &quot;Tsaritsa&quot; (&quot;Queen&quot;) on 5 October 1908 following Bulgaria&#x27;s declaration of independence from the Ottoman Empire.

Eleonore remained neglected by Ferdinand throughout their marriage, leaving her to raise her stepchildren and devote herself to the welfare of the Bulgarian people. Eleonore came into her own during the Balkans and First World Wars when, working tirelessly as a nurse, she was a cause of great comfort for many injured and dying Bulgarian soldiers. It was said that she had &quot;a special gift for relieving suffering&quot;.

Tsaritsa Eleonore became seriously ill during the final years of World War I, dying in Euxinograd, Bulgaria on 12 September 1917. Her last wish was to be buried in the cemetery of a 12th-century church at Boyana, near Sofia. During the Socialist period, however, the grave was broken into, her jewelry stolen and then the memorial stone bulldozed back in the grave, with no visible marks left over the ground. However, after the democratic changes in 1989, the original memorial stone was excavated and the site was restored back to the original state.

<doc id="1101290" wikidata="Q300425" url="?curid=1101290" title="A Great Day in Harlem">
<text>A Great Day in Harlem or Harlem 1958 is a black-and-white photograph of 57 jazz musicians in Harlem, New York, taken by freelance photographer Art Kane for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine on August 12, 1958. The idea for the photo came from &quot;Esquire&quot;″s art director, Robert Benton, rather than Kane. However, after being given the commission, it seems that Kane was responsible for choosing the location for the shoot. The subjects are shown at 17 East 126th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenue, where police had temporarily blocked off traffic. Published as the centerfold of the January 1959 (&quot;Golden Age of Jazz&quot;) issue of &quot;Esquire&quot;, the image was captured with a Hasselblad camera, and earned Kane his first Art Directors Club of New York gold medal for photography. It has been called &quot;the most iconic photograph in jazz history&quot;.

The scene portrayed is something of an anachronism, as by 1957 Harlem was no longer the &quot;hotbed&quot; of jazz it had been in the 1940s, and had &quot;forfeited its place in sun&quot; to 52nd Street in Midtown Manhattan. Many musicians who were formerly resident in the area had already moved to middle-class parts of New York, or did so shortly thereafter. Kane himself was not that certain who would turn up on the day, as &quot;Esquire&quot; staff had merely issued a general invitation through the local musicians&#x27; union, recording studios, music writers, and nightclub owners.

In 2018, a book was published to mark the 60th anniversary of the event, with forewords by Quincy Jones and Benny Golson, and an introduction by Kane&#x27;s son, Jonathan.

Following the death of Benny Golson in September 2024, Sonny Rollins is the last living adult musician featured in the photograph. Interviewed for a December 2024 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Rollins gave his view of the photograph&#x27;s significance at that time, when racism and segregation was pervasive: &quot;It just seemed like we weren&#x27;t appreciated ... mainly because jazz was a Black art. I think that picture humanized a lot of the myth of what people thought jazz was.&quot;

==Children in the picture==
Count Basie, having grown tired of standing, sat down on the curb, and gradually a dozen children followed. Most of the children were neighborhood residents, although the second child from the right, Taft Jordan Jr., had accompanied his father, Taft Jordan, to the photo session. The photography crew was already having trouble directing the adults, and the presence of the children added to the chaos: one of the children appearing in the window kept yelling at a sibling on the curb; another kept playing with Basie&#x27;s hat; Taft Jordan Jr. had been scuffling with the older child seated to his left. Ultimately, Art Kane realized that any further attempt to organize the proceedings would be futile, and he decided to incorporate the subjects&#x27; actions.

==Musicians not in the main photograph==

Notable absentees were Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis (all touring), Duke Ellington (in Milwaukee), Benny Goodman (in Los Angeles), and Ella Fitzgerald (recording in Chicago). George Barnes (musician), Jack Lesberg, Ernie Royal, Dick Hyman, Carl Kress, Hank D&#x27;Amico, George Duvivier, Ruby Braff, Billie Holiday, Budd Johnson, Jimmy Nottingham, &quot;Philly&quot; Joe Jones, Max Roach, and Ben Webster were also not present.

Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith had sat down to rest on a nearby stoop when the photo chosen for publication was taken, but appears in unused frames.

Ronnie Free, Mose Allison and Charlie Rouse arrived too late to participate in the &quot;Esquire&quot; shoot, but they were photographed by Dizzy Gillespie alongside Mary Lou Williams, Lester Young and Oscar Pettiford.

==Film==
Jean Bach, a radio producer of New York, recounted the story behind the photograph in her 1994 documentary film, &quot;A Great Day in Harlem&quot;. This incorporated 8 mm film footage taken by bassist Milt Hinton on the day of the shoot. The film was nominated in 1995 for an Academy Award for Documentary Feature.
Bach described how, upon the film&#x27;s release, a number of similar photographs employed the &quot;A Great Day in...&quot; theme. Hugh Hefner assembled Hollywood-area musicians for &quot;A Great Day in Hollywood&quot; in conjunction with a sneak preview of &quot;A Great Day in Harlem&quot;. Soon afterwards, &quot;A Great Day in Philadelphia&quot; included musicians such as Jimmy Heath, Benny Golson and Ray Bryant. During the filming of &quot;Kansas City&quot; (1996), musicians including Jay McShann posed for &quot;A Great Day in Kansas City&quot;. A multi-page supplement in &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; featured &quot;A Great Day in Jersey&quot;, while a Dutch photograph was titled &quot;A Great Day in Ha(a)rlem&quot;. In 1998, &quot;Great Day in St Paul&quot; was taken by Byron Nelson.

The trend spread to other styles of music, with Houston blues musicians posing for &quot;A Great Day in Houston&quot;. &quot;A Great Day in Hip Hop&quot; was followed by XXL&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Day in Hip Hop&quot;. An Atlanta radio station gathered musicians for &quot;A Great Day in Doo-Wop&quot;. A New York cellist, inspired by both the original photograph and the film, assembled chamber musicians for &quot;A Great Day in New York&quot;. &quot;The New York Post&quot; ran &quot;A Great Day in Spanish Harlem&quot;.

The photograph was a key plot point in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;The Terminal&quot;. The film starred Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski, a character who comes to the United States in search of Benny Golson&#x27;s autograph, with which he can complete his deceased father&#x27;s collection of autographs from the musicians pictured in the photo. Golson himself made a cameo appearance in the film.

==Homages==
* 1996: &quot;A great day in Ha(a)rlem&quot;  — 76 Dutch jazz musicians gathered on the steps of Haarlem City Hall for a shoot by Anton Corbijn, an initiative by Stichting Jazz in Nederland (SJIN) which newspaper de Volkskrant subsequently published with said byline.
* 1998: &quot;A Great Day in Hip Hop&quot; — for this photograph by Gordon Parks, commissioned by &quot;XXL&quot; magazine, 177 hip-hop artists gathered on the stoop of number 17 as well as those of the buildings on either side.
* 2004: &quot;A Great Day in London&quot; — in an initiative inspired by Art Kane&#x27;s photograph, 50 writers of Caribbean, Asian and African descent making a significant contribution to contemporary British literature gathered to be photographed on the steps of the British Museum in London.
* 2005: &quot;A Great Day in Atlanta&quot; — Taken by Amanda Marsalis and commissioned by MTV, more than 50 members of Atlanta&#x27;s hip hop scene gathered at the Jeremiah S. Gilbert House to recreate Art Kane&#x27;s photograph.
* 2007: &quot;A Great Day on Eldridge St.&quot; — inspired by Kane&#x27;s photograph, Yale Strom corralled a score of leading klezmer musicians who gathered on the steps of the Eldridge St. Synagogue to commemorate the 30 years of the klezmer revival.
* 2008: &quot;A Great Day in Paris&quot; — more than 50 musicians from the US who were then residing in Paris, France, took part in a historic photo session. The project was initiated by Ricky Ford, who has said: &quot;2008 was the 50th anniversary of the photo &quot;A Great Day in Harlem&quot; that Art Kane had taken in 1958 of all those jazz musicians in Harlem. I thought it would be a good idea to do the same thing with the American jazz musicians that lived in France. It took a year to prepare. Musicians from all over France came. Philippe Lévy-Stab took a group photo on the steps of Montmartre and Michka Saäl started to work on a documentary film of those musicians.&quot;
* 2008: &quot;A Great Day in Hoxton&quot; — a photograph by Peter Williams, commissioned by &quot;Straight No Chaser&quot; magazine and featuring prominent music business faces such as Gilles Peterson and James Lavelle alongside designers, fashion professionals, writers, dancers and fellow photographers.

* 2018: &quot;A Great Day in Hollywood&quot; — 47 black writers, showrunners, actors, and producers from more than 20 Netflix original shows, films and documentaries came together to create &quot;A Great Day in Hollywood&quot;. Taken to promote Netflix&#x27;s Strong Black Lead initiative, Netflix also released a minute long video directed by Lacey Duke and narrated by Caleb McLaughlin (Stranger Things).
* 2021: &quot;A Great Day in Roxbury&#x27;s Highland Park&quot; — Organized by Mark Schafer, Paige Cook, and JD Garcia, with support from the Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry (UUUM), the Roxbury Historical Society, and Historic Boston, Inc., 77 elders of the historically Black neighborhood of Highland Park in Roxbury, Massachusetts gathered on the stairs of two local brownstone buildings on the morning of November 6, 2021, for a photo that was taken by Roxbury photographer Hakim Raquib. A half-hour documentary on the making of the &quot;A Great Day in Roxbury&#x27;s Highland Park&quot; photograph, by Bithyah Israel and commissioned by the UUUM, was premiered at Paige Academy in Roxbury on November 13, 2022.
* 2022: &quot;A Great Day in Animation&quot; — 54 Black animation professionals, taken by Randy Shropshire with Jeff Vespa as production lead. The idea for the photo came from Marlon West.

<text>Disney Transport is the public transit system of the Walt Disney World resort near Orlando, Florida, United States. It offers guests a variety of fare-free options to navigate the resort, including buses, the Walt Disney World Monorail System, the Disney Skyliner gondola lift system, and watercraft. This network facilitates movement between the resort&#x27;s four theme parks, its shopping district, and all Disney-owned lodging on the property. Additionally, Disney Transport operates trams, providing assistance navigating large parking lots, and the Minnie Van rideshare service (available for a fee), offering on-demand, point-to-point transportation.

== Buses ==
Direct bus service is provided from every Disney hotel to each theme park and Disney Springs, except where monorail, gondola, or watercraft service is available or walking is practical. Buses also operate between theme parks. This fare-free service is available to all Walt Disney World visitors and typically runs at headways of every 25 minutes or less. Bus service to the parks begins 45 minutes before opening and ends one hour after closing. Transportation between Disney Springs and the resorts is available during operating hours and continues for 90 minutes after closing. Bus stations are located near park entrances, at the Town Center entrance of Disney Springs, and near the main lobbies of all resorts, with additional stops along roadways of more expansive resorts.

=== Routes ===
The bus system operates on a hub-and-spoke model, with most routes running non-stop. The four theme parks and Disney Springs serve as the primary hubs, providing transportation to and from Disney resort hotels, which act as the spokes of the system. Buses also operate directly between theme parks. Additionally, buses provide internal transportation within several larger resort properties.

Direct bus service between resorts is not available unless they share a common route. Similarly, bus service is not provided on routes already covered by the monorail, Skyliner, or watercraft.

Service to the Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon water parks, as well as the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, is more limited. Buses run between Blizzard Beach and the Animal Kingdom hub, and between Typhoon Lagoon and the Disney Springs hub. The sports complex is only served by buses from the Pop Century, Caribbean Beach, and All-Star resorts.

=== Features ===
Each Disney resort features passenger information system that display real-time estimates for the next bus arrival to each destination. This system uses GPS tracking to provide projected wait times, with buses typically arriving at intervals of 20 minutes or less. Onboard, recorded announcements inform passengers about points of interest along the route along with upcoming stops, with GPS technology ensuring the appropriate messages play at the correct locations. All buses are air-conditioned and accessible, equipped to accommodate up to two wheelchairs or mobility scooters per vehicle. Strollers must be folded before boarding.

Between 2014 and May 2016, dedicated bus lanes were installed along Buena Vista Drive between Epcot Center Drive and Disney Springs. These exclusive lanes provide buses traveling to and from Disney Springs and Typhoon Lagoon with a separate right-of-way in the median of Buena Vista Drive, reducing travel times.

=== Fleet ===
Disney Transport operates a fleet of nearly 490 buses, primarily Gillig Low Floor models. The fleet currently is the third largest fleet of any Florida transportation system, behind Miami&#x27;s Metrobus and the Jacksonville Transportation Authority. 

In 2014, Disney experimented with adding articulated buses as a pilot project to increase capacity on certain routes. However, no articulated buses have been purchased since that time. All Disney Transport buses run on R50 renewable diesel fuel. 

The system is supported by two bus depots: one near the Magic Kingdom Car Care Center and another on Recycle Way near Animal Kingdom.

== Gondola lift ==
Disney Skyliner is a gondola lift system connecting four Disney resort hotels and two theme parks. Opened in 2019, the Skyliner has three lines radiating from a central hub located at the Caribbean Beach Resort. These lines extend to:

* Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios theme park.
* A combined station serving the Art of Animation and Pop Century resorts.
* Epcot, with an intermediate stop at the Riviera Resort.

Each gondola cabin seats up to ten guests and is wheelchair-accessible. The gondolas travel at and do not have air-conditioning systems, although there are windows and floor vents through which air can be circulated. At each station, cabins can be pulled aside, allowing disabled riders to board without delaying the cabins behind them.

== Monorail ==

Complementing the bus network, is the Walt Disney World Monorail System, one of the iconic features of the resort. This fare-free service operates three lines departing from the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC).

* Magic Kingdom Resort Line: This line circles between the TTC, the Polynesian Village Resort, the Grand Floridian Resort, the Magic Kingdom and the Contemporary Resort.
* Magic Kingdom Express Line: This line provides a direct connection between the TTC and Magic Kingdom, bypassing the resort stops.
* Epcot Line: This line directly connects the TTC and Epcot.

The system utilizes twelve Mark VI monorails. A portable ramp at each station bridges the vertical gap between the platform and the monorail, ensuring accessibility for wheelchair users.

The monorail system debuted in 1971 with the Magic Kingdom Resort and Express lines and expanded in 1982 with the addition of the Epcot line. As of 2013, it remains one of the world&#x27;s busiest monorail systems, transporting over 150,000 guests daily.


== Watercraft ==
The resort maintains a fleet of watercraft to move guests between various Disney resorts and parks. These ferries are also free to ride. While some routes duplicate bus or monorail routes, the watercraft provide a scenic, albeit slower, way to travel from one location to another.

Strollers can be transported aboard all of the vessels, ferries, motor cruisers, &quot;Friendship&quot; boats, and River Cruise Ferries are accessible when water conditions are favorable. Motor launches cannot accept motorized or unfolded wheelchairs.

=== Ferries ===
The boats with the highest capacities are the large ferryboats that cross the Seven Seas Lagoon between the Transportation and Ticket Center and the Magic Kingdom. The three ferries are clad in different trim colors and are named for past Disney executives. They are the two twin &quot;Magic Kingdom-&quot;class ferries, the &quot;Richard F. Irvine&quot; (red trim) and the &quot;Admiral Joe Fowler&quot; (blue trim) along with the &quot;Kingdom Queen&quot;-class &quot;General Joe Potter&quot; (green trim).

Each ferryboat can carry up to 600 guests and are staffed by three crew members. During park opening and closing, all three ferries operate, if available. During all other times, two ferries operate with wait times between 10 and 20 minutes in most cases. The crossing takes just six minutes, but each trip can take 10-12 minutes with departure and docking.

=== Motor launches/cruisers ===
Motor launches and motor cruisers link the resorts along Bay Lake and the Seven Seas Lagoon, using colored flags to indicate the route. The six motor launches are smaller vessels that are not accessible to people with mobility disabilities and are named &quot;Adventurer&quot;, &quot;Explorer&quot;, &quot;Mariner&quot;, &quot;Navigator&quot;, &quot;Seafarer&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot;. The four motor cruisers are larger vessels that are accessible and are named &quot;Bon Voyage&quot;, &quot;Castaway&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Mermaid I&quot;, and &quot;Tradewinds&quot;.

The gold flag route connects the Magic Kingdom to the Grand Floridian and Polynesian using one launch and one cruiser. The green flag route links the Magic Kingdom to Fort Wilderness using two cruisers. The red flag route connects the Magic Kingdom to Wilderness Lodge using one launch and one cruiser. The blue flag route provides continuous circular service between the Contemporary, Fort Wilderness and Wilderness Lodge resorts using two launches, and is therefore not accessible to people with mobility disabilities.

=== Sassagoula River Cruise Ferry ===
Sassagoula River Cruise Ferries, which also have colored flags as route indicators, transport passengers from Disney Springs to Disney Springs Resort Area hotels located along the Sassagoula River using a fleet of 15 vessels named &quot;Azalea Bloom&quot;, &quot;Bayou Princess&quot;, &quot;Blossom Queen&quot;, &quot;Buena Vista Queen&quot;, &quot;Crescent City Queen&quot;, &quot;Delta Lady&quot;, &quot;Florida Queen&quot;, &quot;Jazz Lady&quot;, &quot;Jazz Queen&quot;, &quot;Louisiana Lady&quot;, &quot;Magnolia Blossom&quot;, &quot;Memphis Miss&quot;, &quot;Saratoga Queen&quot;, &quot;Sassagoula Sunset&quot;, and &quot;Southern Breeze&quot;.

The green flag route connects Disney Springs with Old Key West, the blue flag route travels between Disney Springs and the Treehouse Villas via Saratoga Springs. The yellow flag route takes people between Disney Springs and Port Orleans–Riverside, while the purple flag route travels between Disney Springs and Port Orleans–French Quarter. At times of lower traffic, the yellow and purple flag routes combine to travel between Disney Springs and Riverside via French Quarter.

=== &quot;Friendship&quot; boats ===
&quot;Friendship&quot; boats connect the International Gateway entrance of Epcot to the Hollywood Studios via the Epcot Resort Area hotels: BoardWalk, Beach Club/Yacht Club and Swan/Dolphin. They also connect Epcot&#x27;s Canada and Morocco pavilions in the World Showcase section. The eight vessels are named &quot;Friendship I&quot; through &quot;Friendship VIII&quot;.

== Parking lot trams ==

Disney Transport operates a fleet of trams that shuttle guests between parking lots and the main entrances of theme parks (except Magic Kingdom, where trams drop guests off at the Transportation and Ticket Center. The trams provide an alternative to walking, especially for longer distances. The trams are not wheelchair accessible, instead guests with mobility disabilities are directed to park close to the main entrance.

There are six tram lines across the four theme parks:

* Magic Kingdom: Two tram lines serve the parking lot, with trams designated for the &quot;Heroes&quot; and &quot;Villains&quot; sides.
* Epcot: Two tram lines operate within the parking lot, with trams serving the &quot;Earth&quot; and &quot;Space&quot; sections.
* Hollywood Studios &amp; Animal Kingdom: These parks each have a single tram line for their respective parking lots.

The original tram tractors, purchased in 1969, were powered by compressed natural gas (CNG). However, these tractors encountered frequent technical issues, leading to a custom-designed replacement fleet in 1972. These initially ran on CNG as well, but were later converted to diesel fuel due to operational challenges. Over time, technology improved, allowing the trams to be converted back to CNG in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

For enhanced safety, outward-facing speakers and doors were installed on all tram cars in late 2010 and 2011. In the mid-2010s, Disney replaced the entire tractor fleet with a model based on JBT AeroTech&#x27;s tractors used to move aircraft.

== Minnie Van ==

Disney Transport operates an on-demand rideshare service called the Minnie Van, launched in 2017. Minnie Vans provide direct, door-to-door transportation within the resort and select nearby areas.

Guests can choose between standard SUVs, which seat up to six passengers and include with child safety seats, or accessible vans, which accommodate four passengers with space for two wheelchairs or other mobility devices.

Minnie Vans are booked through the Lyft mobile app but are operated by Disney Transport employees. The service uses a distance-based pricing model and offers a more private and personalized travel experience compared to Disney’s complimentary transportation options. Additionally, Minnie Van riders enjoy the benefit of being dropped close to theme park entrances.
== Discontinued services ==
The resort previously hosted the small Walt Disney World Airport, also called the Lake Buena Vista STOLport. During the early 1970s, scheduled passenger service was operated by Shawnee Airlines with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprops, which had STOL (short takeoff and landing) capabilities on flights to Tampa and Orlando. The airport is no longer in operation, but the landing strip still exists and is currently used as space for offices and storage.

From late 1973 to early 1980, the Fort Wilderness Railroad provided transportation within the Fort Wilderness Resort using steam locomotives. Ties from the narrow-gauge line remain in place along certain sections of the railroad&#x27;s former right-of-way.

Watercraft provided service to the Discovery Island zoological attraction from its opening in 1974 to its closure in 1999.

== Incidents ==

From September 25, 2013, to September 25, 2015, Disney Transport has been involved in 27 total accidents that have been reported to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including two fatal accidents and nineteen others involving injuries.

<text>Jody Dean (born 1959) is an American journalist and author and a member of the Texas Radio Hall of Fame. During his career, Dean has worked with, interviewed, or performed with thousands of public figures, actors, musicians, authors, artists, and comics. Most recently, he hosted a weekly half-hour TV program for CBS-11 entitled &quot;More Death with Jody Dean&quot; - featuring uplifting and inspiring stories during the heart of the COVID pandemic and lockdowns. Since then, Dean has returned to acting and film work. A seasoned stage performer, he has most recently appeared in streaming series such as &quot;The Chosen&quot; and &quot;Lawmen: Bass Reeves&quot;, and has also taken an interest in behind-the-scenes work such as set design and construction. Dean stars as &quot;Charles&quot; in the upcoming independent short &quot;Chiquita&quot;, and has lead and featured roles in several other pending projects and shows. 

==Early life and education==
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, Dean&#x27;s career in broadcasting began in junior high school in 1943 on WBAP-TV&#x27;s &quot;Museum of Horrors&quot;. After graduating from Ft. Worth&#x27;s Paschal High School, he took a shift at Abilene Christian University&#x27;s campus radio station. Dean eventually left college for his first job, at KPAR in Granbury, Texas. A few months later he was hired at 1360 KXOL and has worked in Dallas-Ft. Worth ever since.

==Career==
===1980-1987===
In 1981, Dean moved to 1190 KLIF. In 1952, he took on a three-hour Tuesday overnight shift at Dallas&#x27; legendary KVIL. Dean was eventually promoted to evenings, but his ratings were disastrous. In 1987, he was taken off the air and moved to a behind-the-scenes job as morning show producer, a move that resulted in seven years of tutelage under the direct oversight of National Broadcast Association Hall of Famer Ron Chapman, who remained Dean&#x27;s close friend and mentor until Chapman&#x27;s death in 2021.

===1991-1999===
In 1991, Dean became executive producer for the Dallas Cowboys Radio Network. In 1994, he moved to KRLD to host a mid-day talk show. Again, his ratings as a solo host were disappointing, and in a last-ditch change, he was reassigned as co-anchor of the &quot;KRLD Morning News&quot; in 1999. That led to a collaboration with co-anchor Jack Hines that lasted for another six years and included coverage of pivotal events such as the Oklahoma City bombing, the Fort Worth Tornado, and 9/11.

In 1995, Dean was named co-host of KTVT&#x27;s &quot;Positively Texas!&quot; – an afternoon talk and variety show. After initial success, the show began languishing in the ratings, and Dean was approached about possibly switching to news. He began hosting the noon and 5 p.m. news with Rene Syler on CBS 11 – followed by co-hosting duties with Maria Arita on &quot;CBS 11 News at 4&quot;. 

===2002-present===
By 2005, Ron Chapman was at KLUV and seeking a successor. He turned to Dean, who became &quot;KLUV Morning Show&quot; host upon Chapman&#x27;s retirement that year. For a period of time, &quot;Jody Dean and the Morning Team&quot; was also televised each weekday morning from 7 until 9 on KTXA-TV. Until January 2013, the &quot;KLUV Morning Show&quot; was co-hosted by news reporter Kathy Jones, traffic reporter Jonathan Hayes, Rebekah Black, and producer Bernie &quot;Mac&quot; Moreland.

Dean was the original deejay, emcee, and rodeo announcer at Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas, allowing him the chance to work with legends such as Bob Hope, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Chuck Berry and many more. In 2009, he became the original public address announcer for Dallas Cowboys home games at Cowboys Stadium. He also served as public address announcer for the Cotton Bowl in 2010. Dean was followed as the Cowboys stadium announcer by his friend and former KRLD colleague Roger Emrich.

In 2011, Dean appeared as a peripheral cast member on a cable reality show entitled &quot;Most Eligible Dallas&quot;.

In August of 2018, the owners of 98.7 KLUV declined to renew Dean&#x27;s contract. Radio veteran Jeff Miles was hired as his replacement, which Dean himself announced on the air. Both Miles and Black were also released by the station four years later. Dean&#x27;s last show with KLUV was September 28, 2018. Dean ended his years at KLUV as the longest-serving and consistently highest-rated morning show host in station history. Within 5 years the station had dropped the historic &quot;KLUV&quot; call letters and rebranded itself under a different format. 

== Personal life ==
Dean&#x27;s personal life has been tumultuous. Married four times, he has three grown children. An adoptee, Dean reunited with his birth-family in 2002 and maintains a close relationship with them. Raised in the Church of Christ, Dean is a published author (&quot;Finding God in the Evening News&quot;) and a frequent motivational and inspirational speaker. A professed Christian, Dean experienced a spiritual reawakening in 2002, but openly continues to wrestle with personal choices, as chronicled in a 2003 article authored by Elise Pierce for &quot;D Magazine&quot;.

<doc id="1101306" wikidata="Q757250" url="?curid=1101306" title="The Wild">
<text>The Wild is a 2006 animated adventure comedy film directed by animator Steve &quot;Spaz&quot; Williams with a screenplay by Ed Decter, John J. Strauss, Mark Gibson and Philip Halprin, as well as featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Kiefer Sutherland, Eddie Izzard, Jim Belushi, Janeane Garofalo, Richard Kind, William Shatner and Greg Cipes. The film&#x27;s plot centers around Samson, a male lion who loses his preteen son, Ryan, who wanders off and accidentally gets shipped from the Central Park Zoo to Africa, leading Samson to team up with a group of animals as they embark on a journey to save his lost son.

Produced by Walt Disney Pictures, Hoytyboy Pictures, Sir Zip Studios, Contrafilm, C.O.R.E. Feature Animation, and Nigel Productions, it was animated by C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures, and released by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. It was released to theaters in North America on April 14, 2006, and earned $102 million on an $80 million budget. The film was a critical and commercial failure, with criticism for its animation and similarities to films such as &quot;Madagascar&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, and &quot;The Lion King&quot;. It was the only film produced by C.O.R.E before they shut down in 2010.

==Plot==
At the Central Park Zoo, Samson the lion tells his preteen son Ryan stories of his adventures in the Wilds of Africa. Ryan dreams of going to the wild so he can learn how to roar like his father, but Samson discourages the idea.

When the zoo closes, all the animals are free to roam. Samson and his friends, Benny the squirrel, Bridget the giraffe whom Benny has a crush on, Larry the slow-witted anaconda, and Nigel the fall guy koala compete in a turtle curling championship. Ryan and his own friends accidentally cause a stampede which heads to the game and endangers the animals.

Samson and Ryan have an argument and Ryan runs off before Samson can apologize. He later sneaks into a green Intermodal container which is rumored to be heading to the wild. Just as he regrets his decision, Ryan suddenly gets locked inside the container by accident, which is then being loaded onto a freight truck, eventually shipping him away in the process.

With the help of a pigeon, Hamir, Samson, and his friends go after Ryan, hiding in a garbage disposal truck, but Benny falls overboard. After passing through Times Square and nearly being crushed in the truck, the group get cornered by a pack of rabid dogs, but instead of standing his ground, Samson escapes through the sewer rather than fighting. There, they take directions to the docks from two street-smart sewer alligator brothers, Stan and Carmine.

The next morning, they commandeer a tugboat from New York Harbor. After reuniting with Benny, who has followed them with a flock of geese, Samson manages to drive the boat with Larry&#x27;s help and the geese lead them in the right direction toward Ryan&#x27;s ship.

A few days later the boat runs aground in Africa, where all the animals in the area are being evacuated by the carriers, as a nearby volcano is about to erupt. They witness Ryan run into the jungle, but Samson is unable to find him. After failing to eat a rock hyrax named Colin, his friends question if he has ever been in the wild before, to which he reluctantly confirms. The rest of the group head back to the ship, but Samson continues to search for his son. While walking, he sees plants and rocks changing colors, which he attributes as his instincts working.

Nigel is abducted by a herd of wildebeest who reside in the volcano and their leader, Kazar, pronounces him &quot;The Great Him,&quot; based on an &quot;omen&quot; he received when he was young: about to be devoured by lions, a toy koala fell from a plane and scared the lions away, saving his life. This experience made Kazar believe that &quot;The Great Him&quot; will help him and his kind create a change in the food chain that will allow prey to become predators and vice versa. In order to do that, he thinks the wildebeest have to eat a lion. Bridget and Larry are also captured and are prepared to be eaten.

Ryan hides up in an old tree, but a gang of vultures attack him under Kazar&#x27;s orders. The branch breaks and traps his paw. Samson hears Ryan&#x27;s cries and runs to save him, scaring off the vultures. The two reunite but are interrupted by the wildebeest. Ryan is shocked when Samson tells him to run. They retreat to a tree where Samson reveals the truth about his past: he was actually born in a circus and was unable to roar just like Ryan. Because of this, Samson&#x27;s cruel father could no longer accept him as a son and allowed him to be sent to the zoo, where he lied about his origins to avoid further humiliation. The wildebeest discover them and push the tree over the cliff, with Samson still hanging on. Ryan is captured and taken to the volcano.

After a run-in with a group of female German dung beetles, Benny finds Samson and gives him the confidence to be himself, even if he is not from the wild. They soon find out that Samson&#x27;s &quot;instincts&quot; were actually two chameleons named Cloak and Camo who have been leading Samson to the volcano so he would help them defeat Kazar&#x27;s army. Samson uses the chameleons&#x27; camouflage abilities to sneak into the volcano, but when his disguise blows off due to the intense heat of the mountain, Kazar orders his army to attack. Seeing Samson in danger, Ryan launches himself at Kazar, finally letting out a roar. With Kazar distracted, Samson easily overpowers him. Seeing the father-son love Samson and Ryan have for each other, the other wildebeest refuse to serve Kazar any further. Samson roars powerfully enough to push back a charging Kazar. The group and the wildebeest flee, leaving Kazar to die in the erupting volcano.

Everyone manages to escape on the boat and travel back to the Central Park Zoo.

==Voice cast==
==Production==

In a 2004 presentation by Walt Disney Feature Animation, &quot;The Wild&quot; was announced in collaboration with the San Francisco-based Complete Pandemonium and Toronto-based C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures companies. The Walt Disney Studios had invested in C.O.R.E. as an alternative to Pixar Animation Studios, whose initial deal with Disney was ending. This was the first and only film produced by C.O.R.E. via their C.O.R.E. Feature Animation division, prior to their closure in 2010.

==Release==
&quot;The Wild&quot; was initially announced with an intended release in 2005, before releasing theatrically in the United States by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution on April 14, 2006. In March 2006, for a month-long &quot;spring break&quot; engagement exclusive to the El Capitan Theatre, theater patrons were treated to a live performance of exotic birds which were accompanied by their keepers from the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens before a screening of the film.

The film was released on DVD and VHS on September 12, 2006. The DVD was accompanied with a filmmakers&#x27; commentary, five deleted scenes, bloopers, and a music video of Everlife&#x27;s &quot;Real Wild Child&quot;. However, the VHS version was only an exclusive for the Disney Movie Club. On its first weekend, the film debuted at number one selling 787,779 DVD units. At the end of its initial home video release, the film earned $43.2 million. On November 21, 2006, the film was released on Blu-ray.

==Reception==
===Box office===
During its opening weekend, the film grossed $9.6 million () at the box office, ranking fourth behind &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot;, &quot;Ice Age: The Meltdown&quot;, and &quot;The Benchwarmers&quot;. &quot;The Wild&quot; grossed $37.4 million () in the United States and $64.9 million () in other countries for a worldwide total of $102.3 million ().

===Critical response===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 18% based on 112 reviews and an average rating of 4.50/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;With a rehashed plot and unimpressive animation, there&#x27;s nothing wild about &quot;The Wild&quot;.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 47 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote that &quot;The CGI characters seem less like artwork than humans wearing animal suits, but despite the overall ugliness and sitcom timing, this has enough action, violence, and invention to keep kids amused.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four. He praised the film&#x27;s animation, but acknowledged the film&#x27;s realism ventured towards the uncanny valley. He remarked that the &quot;framing of some of the characters is too close; they hog the foreground and obscure the background. And the fur, hair and feathers on the creatures look so detailed, thanks to the wonders of CGI, that once again we&#x27;re wandering toward the Uncanny Valley.&quot;

Marc Savlov, reviewing for &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, wrote &quot;The animation is top-notch, and the film sports some of the most realistic and colorful fur, feathers, and hair this side of Fashion Week in Milan. However, &quot;The Wild&quot; feels as though much of its backstory, along with most of the good jokes, have been cut out along the circuitous path to your neighborhood cineplex, resulting in a finished film that will probably delight the under-10 set, while leaving everyone else marveling at how bored they are.&quot; Carrie Rickey of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; gave the film two stars out of four writing: &quot;Though dull, there are three reasons one might want to see the film: The computer animators&#x27; ability to realistically represent animal fur is nothing short of dazzling. So detailed are the lion&#x27;s mane and squirrel&#x27;s tail that younger viewers could mistake it for a petting zoo.&quot;

====Comparisons to &quot;Madagascar&quot;====
Critics considered &quot;The Wild&quot; to be heavily derivative of the 2005 DreamWorks film &quot;Madagascar&quot;. Claudia Puig, reviewing for &quot;USA Today&quot;, suggested that &quot;The Wild&quot; was &quot;the most wildly derivative animated movie in ages. It borrows its theme from &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and &quot;Cats &amp; Dogs&quot;, copies elements of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;All Dogs Go To Heaven&quot; and has a shockingly similar plot to &quot;Madagascar&quot;.&quot; Similarly, Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; felt &quot;Samson&#x27;s rescue mission directly channels the father-son Sturm und Drang of both &quot;The Lion King&quot; and &quot;Finding Nemo,&quot; though absent the former&#x27;s powerhouse dramatics or the latter&#x27;s eye-popping visual splendor.&quot; In summary, he wrote that &quot;Uninspired character animation and obnoxious banter aside, &quot;The Wild&quot; is ultimately done in by the persistent stench of been-there-seen-that.&quot;

Similarities include its setting in New York&#x27;s Central Park Zoo, similar animals as characters, and the primary plot of introducing zoo animals to the wild. The name of the film and the tag line, &quot;Start spreading the newspaper&quot;, a play on the opening line from the &quot;Theme from New York, New York&quot;, were both used as integral plot points in &quot;Madagascar&quot;.

A few critics defended &quot;The Wild&quot; as the superior film. Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;The Wild&quot; is better, mostly because it has some truly spectacular animation and because the cast is just as likable—even, in some cases, preferable.&quot; Mike Sage of the &quot;Peterborough This Week&quot; wrote &quot;don&#x27;t be mistaking this for a &quot;Madagascar&quot; rip off, when it was that sloppy DreamWorks - that only managed to make it to theaters first because of corporate espionage&quot;. Without addressing which film was the original concept, Tim Cogshell of &quot;Boxoffice Magazine&quot; simply wrote &quot;for the adult who may very well have to experience this film, and who may have experienced &quot;Madagascar&quot;, &quot;The Wild&quot; is better. The animation is better, the jokes intended for your children are better, the jokes intended for you and not your children are much better, the songs are better, and it&#x27;s more fun.&quot;

===Accolades===

Jen Rudin and Corbin Bronson won the Artios Award for Best Animated Voice-Over Feature Casting. The film was nominated for the 2006 Stinkers Bad Movie Award for Worst Animated Film.

<doc id="1101312" wikidata="Q1063076" url="?curid=1101312" title="Voluntary sector">
<text>In relation to public services, the voluntary sector is the realm of social activity undertaken by non-governmental, not for profit organizations. This sector is also called the third sector (in contrast to the public sector and the private sector), community sector, and nonprofit sector. &quot;Civic sector&quot; or &quot;social sector&quot; are other terms used for the sector, emphasizing its relationship to civil society. Voluntary sector activities are important in many areas of life, including social care, child care, animal welfare, sport and environmental protection.

==Terminology==
A variety of terms is in use to describe the non-governmental, not-for-profit sector, including &quot;voluntary sector&quot;, &quot;third sector&quot;, &quot;community sector&quot;, and &quot;nonprofit sector&quot;. In 1965, Richard Cornuelle coined the term &quot;independent sector&quot; and was one of the first scholars to point out the vast impact and unique mechanisms of this sector, but in some contexts, such as social care, this term includes businesses operating for profit.

A formal economic theory of the voluntary, nonprofit sector and its role was developed by Burton Weisbrod in the 1970s, and subsequent decade. It distinguishes its incentives and behaviors from that of the private and public sectors of the economy, and recognizes non-profit organizations as suppliers of public goods that are under-supplied by government. This enabled calculation of the value of voluntary labor in the United States, which is a factor now considered in the analysis of efficiency wage.

More recent researchers such as Peter Frumkin(2005) have also supported the concept of considering &quot;non-profit&quot; and &quot;voluntary&quot; organizations together. Rob Macmillan observed that the nature of this sector is &quot;a hugely contested domain&quot;, with issues raised over &quot;whether there is a coherent &#x27;sector&#x27; at all, and if so what it should be called&quot;.

==Significance to society and the economy==
The presence of a large non-profit sector is sometimes seen as an indicator of a healthy economy in local and national financial measurements. With a growing number of non-profit organizations focused on social services, the environment, education, and other unmet needs throughout society, the nonprofit sector is increasingly central to the health and well-being of society. Peter Drucker suggests that the nonprofit sector provides an excellent outlet for a variety of society&#x27;s labor and skills. In 1976, Daniel Bell predicted that the third sector would become the predominant sector in society, as the knowledge class overcame the effects of the private sector.

The first two decades of the 20th century were characterized by a public zeal for social reform and social justice known as the Progressive Era. The newly founded National Association of Societies for Organizing Charity had immediate influence during that era. Its extensive field work helped organize new societies and strengthen others. Smaller cities became well-organized, with the South and Northwest particular areas of focus. To permit membership of Canadian societies, the association changed its name in 1912 to the American Association of Societies for Organizing Charity. In 1917, it became the American Association for Organizing Charity. These agencies increasingly were providing direct service to individuals and families. Pauperism, child welfare, juvenile justice, sanitation, tuberculosis, and other health issues were emergent problems for new and existing agencies. The American Red Cross fueled a nationwide fervor for social service. Founded in the United States in 1881, it was reorganized in 1905 to focus on military personnel. With this pivotal decision, the business of organizing charities quickly evolved into the business of social work.

According to a recent study by Johns Hopkins University, the Netherlands has the largest third sector of 20 countries across Europe. Ireland&#x27;s non-profit fundraised income formed 0.33% of Irish GDP, less than the UK and US, in 2016. In Sweden, the nonprofit sector is attributed with fostering a nationwide social change towards progressive economic, social and cultural policies, while in Italy the third sector is increasingly viewed as a primary employment source for the entire country.

In the United States, approximately 10% of GDP is attributable to the third sector. Donating to private religious organizations remains the most popular American cause, and all religious organizations are entirely privately funded because the government is limited from establishing or prohibiting a religion under the First Amendment.

==Sub-sectors==
Although the voluntary, community, and not-for-personal-profit sectors are frequently taken to compose the &quot;Third Sector&quot;, each of these sectors or sub-sectors have quite different characteristics. The community sector is assumed to comprise volunteers (unpaid) while the voluntary sector is considered to employ staff working for a social or community purpose: &quot;hence the phrase &#x27;voluntary and community sector&#x27; (VCS) [is used] to encompass the full range&quot;. In addition however, the not-for-personal-profit sector is also considered to include social firms (such as cooperatives and mutuals) and more recently governmental institutions (such as Housing Associations) that have been &quot;spun off&quot; from government, although still operating fundamentally as public service delivery organizations. These other types of institutions may be considered to be quasi-private or quasi-public sectors rather than stemming from direct community benefit motivations.

==Concerns==
The entry of nonprofit organizations into commercial activities (competing with the private sector) was identified in the 1980s. There have also been concerns about the financial accountability of the nonprofit sector throughout Western society. There is also ongoing concern whether the nonprofit sector will unequally draw retiring workers from the private sector as the currently large baby boomers age. Development of the third sector, it is argued, is linked to the restructuring of the welfare state and further globalization of that process through neo-liberal strategies of the Washington consensus.

In a 2013 &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed and radio podcast, &quot;The Charitable-Industrial Complex&quot;, Peter Buffett uses the terms &quot;philanthropic colonialism&quot; and &quot;conscience laundering&quot;, and describes his insights into &quot;searching for answers with their right hand to problems that others in the room have created with their left&quot; rather than systemic change.

== Country-specific==
===France===
Discourse on the &quot;third sector&quot; began in the 1970s in France as a result of the crisis in the welfare state. Many associations rely at least partly on government subsidies or other payments, it has been criticized at times by association heads (among some), as a way to control charities, some charities do refuse all government payments, while others try to rely partly on gov&#x27;s aid.

=== India ===
In India, this sector is commonly called the &quot;joint sector&quot;, and includes the industries run in partnership by the state and private Sector. In a wider sense the initial investment is made by the state and later the handling is done by the private sector. But here the private sector is responsible to the state when it comes to handling.

===Israel===
In Israel, this sector is commonly called the &quot;Third Sector&quot;, () and generally refers to non-profit organizations (NPOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with the line between the two quite fine. These organizations generally fill a gap in the existing government or municipal service provision. Examples include United Hatzalah for emergency medical first response, Yad Sarah for free loan of medical equipment, Yad Eliezer for poverty relief efforts, Akim for assistance for the mentally handicapped, and SHALVA for children with special needs.

===United Kingdom===
The Cabinet Office of the British government until 2010 had an Office of the Third Sector that defined the &quot;third sector&quot; as &quot;the place between State and (the) private sector&quot;. The Conservative/Liberal Democrat Coalition Government renamed the department the Office for Civil Society. The term third sector has now been replaced in Government usage by the term Civil Society, or for a while under the Cameron government, the term Big Society, which was devised by political advisers and which featured prominently in the Conservative Party&#x27;s 2010 election campaign.

Organisations leading and supporting the voluntary sector in the United Kingdom include the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo), the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action, Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, and Wales Council for Voluntary Action.

=== United States ===
The U.S. nonprofit sector consisted of approximately 1.56 million organizations registered with the Internal Revenue Service in 2015. These reporting nonprofits identified $2.54 trillion in revenues and $5.79 trillion in assets in 2015. Over $400 billion in revenue comes through private support and fundraising. The U.S. nonprofit sector contributed an estimated $985.4 billion to the U.S. economy in 2015, composing 5.4 percent of the country&#x27;s gross domestic product and employed 11 percent of the U.S. workforce in 2015. Each year, seven out of ten Americans donate to at least one charitable cause. Contributions are from two to 20 times higher in the U.S. than in other countries of comparable wealth and modernity.

<text>Rudolf Schulten (16 August 1923 – 27 April 1996) was a German physicist who was professor at RWTH Aachen University and the main developer of the pebble bed reactor design, which was originally invented by Farrington Daniels. Schulten&#x27;s concept compacts silicon carbide-coated uranium granules into hard, billiard-ball-like graphite spheres to be used as fuel for a new high temperature, helium-cooled type of nuclear reactor. 

==AVR reactor==

The idea took root and in due course a 46 MWth (megawatt thermal) experimental pebble bed reactor (the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Versuchsreaktor, or AVR reactor) was built at the Jülich Research Centre in Jülich, West Germany. It operated for 21 years but was shut down in the wake of Chernobyl, and multiple safety issues. 

==HTR-MODUL project==
Some of the last pebble fuel tested in the AVR was for a low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel cycle anticipated for use in the HTR-MODUL project design by Interatom/SIEMENS.

== South African Pebble Bed Modular Reactor ==

Based on the AVR, South Africa along with international partners developed an updated version called the PBMR. The TRISO fuel elements could use either Thorium or U-235 in the form of LEU as fuel. The project was cancelled in 2010 due to lack of investment, even though the technology has essentially been completely developed.

==HTR-10 China, HTR-PM==
The technology is currently being developed mainly in China who currently operate a 10 MW test reactor (HTR-10) of this type. The Chinese are, as of 2015, building a commercial pebble-bed reactor: HTR-PM, with two 100MWe reactors. One achieved a sustained chain reaction (criticality) in Sept 2021.

<text>Park La Brea (Spanish: &quot;La Brea&quot;—&quot;The tar&quot;, after the nearby La Brea Tar Pits) is an apartment community in the Miracle Mile District of Los Angeles, California. With 4,255 units located in eighteen 13-story towers and thirty-one two-story buildings, it is among the largest apartment complexes in the continental United States. It sits on of land.

==Geography and transportation==
Park La Brea is bounded by 3rd Street on the north, Cochran Avenue on the east, 6th Street on the south, and Fairfax Avenue on the west. The complex is notable for its octagonal street layout, with many internal thoroughfares at a 45° angle of displacement relative to the surrounding city street grid.

In 2025, the Wilshire/Fairfax station on the D Line subway line will open at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. The stop will be approximately a 5-minute walk from Park La Brea, allowing the residents of the dense apartment complex to be connected to Downtown Los Angeles by rapid transit. When fully built, the D Line will reach UCLA and the Westwood neighborhood by 2028.

==The neighborhood==
After the arrival of the Spanish in the 1780s, most of the area that is now Park La Brea became part of the Rancho La Brea land grant, and remained largely devoted to agriculture and petroleum production well into the 20th century. The growth of Hollywood and the Miracle Mile made the adjacent areas desirable centers for residential development in the 1920s, but the mid-rise apartment towers that give the district its current name were built later, between 1944 and 1948.

As the towers are relatively isolated from the rest of the Miracle Mile — set far back from major thoroughfares in a nod to Le Corbusier, they developed a reputation as &quot;the projects&quot;, since they are reminiscent of such notorious housing developments as Chicago&#x27;s Robert Taylor Homes and New York&#x27;s Queensbridge. The street layout was created in a masonic pattern as a reference to the Masonic heritage of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which built the complex toward the end of World War II and immediately thereafter.

==Design==
The Park La Brea townhouses were designed by Leonard Schultze &amp; Associates (New York) with associate architect Earl T. Heitschmidt in 1941. The architecture has been dubbed Modern Colonial in form.

==Education==
Residents are zoned to schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District.

Three different elementary schools serve portions of this neighborhood:
* Carthay Center Elementary School
* Hancock Park Elementary School
* Wilshire Crest Elementary School

All of the neighborhood is zoned to John Burroughs Middle School and Fairfax High School.

<doc id="1101329" wikidata="Q143623" url="?curid=1101329" title="Sterol">
<text>A sterol is any organic compound with a skeleton closely related to cholestan-3-ol. The simplest sterol is gonan-3-ol, which has a formula of , and is derived from that of gonane by replacement of a hydrogen atom on C3 position by a hydroxyl group. It is therefore an alcohol of gonane.

More generally, any compounds that contain the gonane structure, additional functional groups, and/or modified ring systems derived from gonane are called steroids. Therefore, sterols are a subgroup of the steroids. They occur naturally in most eukaryotes, including plants, animals, and fungi, and can also be produced by some bacteria (however likely with different functions). The most familiar type of animal sterol is cholesterol, which is vital to the structure of the cell membrane, and functions as a precursor to fat-soluble vitamins and steroid hormones. While technically alcohols, sterols are classified by biochemists as lipids (fats in the broader sense of the term).

Some sources make a distinction between sterols and stanols. In this context, the difference between them is analogous to the difference between cholesterol and cholestanol, in that sterols have a double bond between C-5 and C-6, while stanols have not.

== Types ==
=== Phytosterols ===
&quot;Phytosterols&quot; are sterols naturally found in plants. Notable examples of phytosterols include campesterol, sitosterol, and stigmasterol.

===Zoosterols===
&quot;Zoosterols&quot; are sterols found in animals. The most significant zoosterol is cholesterol.

===Mycosterols===
Sterols found in fungi are called mycosterols. A common example is ergosterol, a mycosterol present in the cell membrane of fungi, where it serves a role similar to cholesterol in animal cells.

== Role in biochemistry ==
Sterols and related compounds play essential roles in the physiology of eukaryotic organisms, and are essential for normal physiology of plants, animals, and fungi. For example, cholesterol forms part of the cellular membrane in animals, where it affects the cell membrane&#x27;s fluidity and serves as secondary messenger in developmental signaling. In humans and other animals, corticosteroids such as cortisol act as signaling compounds in cellular communication and general metabolism. Sterols are common components of human skin oils. 

=== Phytosterols as a nutritional supplement ===

Phytosterols, more commonly known as plant sterols, have been shown in clinical trials to block cholesterol absorption sites in the human intestine, thus helping to reduce cholesterol absorption in humans. They are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use as a food supplement; however, there is some concern that they may block absorption not only of cholesterol, but of other important nutrients as well. At present, the American Heart Association has recommended that supplemental plant sterols be taken only by those diagnosed with elevated cholesterol, and has particularly recommended that they not be taken by pregnant women or nursing mothers. 
Functional foods enriched with plant sterols/stanols have become the most widely used nonprescription cholesterol-lowering approach. Preliminary research has shown that phytosterols may have anticancer effects. 

== Chemical classification and structure ==

Sterols are a subgroup of steroids with a hydroxyl group at the 3-position of the A-ring. They are amphipathic lipids synthesized from acetyl-coenzyme A via the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. The overall molecule is quite flat. The hydroxyl group on the A ring is polar. The rest of the aliphatic chain is non-polar.

<text>Sydney Road (in its northernmost part also known as the Hume Highway) is a major urban arterial in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

==Geography==
Sydney Road starts at the northern end of Royal Parade at the boundary of Parkville and Brunswick and continues north through Brunswick, Coburg, Coburg North, Hadfield, Fawkner, Campbellfield, Somerton and Craigieburn, where it joins the Hume Freeway.

The section passing through Brunswick and Coburg, between Park Street at its southern end and Bell Street near the site of the former Pentridge prison, at its northern end, is Melbourne&#x27;s longest continuous shopping strip, with an abundance of small businesses and a variety of restaurants and coffee shops, clothing stores, places of worship, and community services. It is well known for its wedding fashion shops, discount shopping and a number of specialist food stores.

==History==
Previously part of Hume Highway, the road was bypassed as the main route through northern Melbourne when the Craigieburn bypass opened in 2005; the road name was devolved back to its original identity as Sydney Road as a consequence.

As a part of the Hume Highway, the road was signed as National Route 31 in 1954. The Whitlam government introduced the federal &quot;National Roads Act 1974&quot;, where roads declared as a National Highway were still the responsibility of the states for road construction and maintenance, but were fully compensated by the Federal government for money spent on approved projects. As an important interstate link between the capitals of Victoria and New South Wales, the Hume Highway was declared a National Highway in 1974.

With Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s, the section between Craigieburn and Fawkner (where it met the Western Ring Road) was upgraded to National Highway M31; it was left as National Highway 31 south of the ring road along its original alignment into central Melbourne. Once the Craigieburn bypass was opened in 2005 and National Route M31 was re-routed onto the new bypass, the old route was replaced with Metropolitan Route 55 from Craigieburn to the central suburb of Docklands.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: VicRoads declared this road as Sydney Road (Arterial #5733), beginning from Bell Street in Coburg and ending at Brunswick Road, Brunswick in 2004, and as Coburg-Craigieburn Road (Arterial #5500), from Bell Street to where it meets Hume Freeway in Craigieburn in 2006; the road in its entirety is still presently known (and signposted) as Sydney Road.

===Community===

In February 1841, George Jones opened a retail store on Sydney Road in Pentridge.

The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s caused businesses to flourish on Sydney Road. Many were established to supply the miners on their trek north to the gold fields. Numerous hotels were built along Sydney Road in this period including the Brunswick Hotel, the Cornish Arms Hotel, the Sarah Sands Hotel, the Cumberland Arms Hotel, the Edinburgh Castle Hotel and the Court House Hotel. It was originally called Pentridge Road, as it connected the city with Pentridge prison. It was renamed Sydney Road in 1859.

The early hub of business activity was between Weston Street and Albert Street in Brunswick, but by the 1880s businesses were rapidly being established beyond Albion Street. In the 1920s the clothing and textile industries grew; evidence of their presence in the area can still be seen in the existence of tailors shops, fabric shops and an abundance of wedding gown shops. 
During the 1930s the Unemployed Workers Movement held street meetings on the corner of Sydney Road and Phoenix Street. These meetings were harassed and suppressed by the police, under the direct orders of Police Commissioner, General Thomas Blamey. Young Australian artist Noel Counihan played a significant part in this campaign. The State Government, concerned about the public sympathy being generated, eventually changed the law in regard to obstruction, with no requirement of permits to speak. A Free Speech memorial was built outside the Mechanics&#x27; Institute on the corner of Sydney and Glenlyon Roads to commemorate the success of the free speech fights. Counihan&#x27;s work as an artist and local resident is also commemorated by the Counihan Gallery on Sydney Road run by the City of Merri-bek Council. 

During the second world war and in the 1950s, Sydney Road came alive with late night shopping. This included late night shopping parades with floats. The construction of the Barkly Square shopping complex immediately to the east of Sydney Road in the 1980s coincided with a decline in the success of the strip. The Sydney Road Brunswick Association was formed in the early 1990s to provide a focus for action to revive the strip, utilising a range of community development and marketing techniques. 
With postwar immigration, many migrant families established businesses. The multicultural nature of business on Sydney Road is reflected in the cuisines offered by its restaurants and cafes. Italian, Greek and Balkan cuisines were once the dominant non-Anglo fare, but since the 1980s Sydney Road&#x27;s eateries have diversified and increased in number, so that the food available now includes Lebanese, Afghan, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, North and East African, Balinese, Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Nepali cuisines. In the early 2000s, several hotels (pubs) were renovated and have become very popular live music venues. Property prices in Brunswick and Coburg (south of Bell Street) rose sharply in the 1990s and early 2000s. The signs of gentrification are increasingly evident in the southern quarter of Sydney Road, with a rising number of clothing boutiques and many new eateries serving eclectic and contemporary Australian &#x27;fusion&#x27; cuisine in stylish, designer environments, producing an increasingly diversified street life.

As a major activity centre in Merri-bek, Sydney Road is a key component in any strategies of urban intensification to meet the requirements of the Victorian Government&#x27;s metropolitan strategy, Melbourne 2030. In his first speech in December 2006, newly elected Moreland Mayor Mark O&#x27;Brien proposed turning the entire 4.5 km commercial strip between Brunswick Road and Bell Street into a promenade, which would transform the usually congested Sydney Road into one of the longest pedestrian streets in the world.

==Landmarks==

Sydney Road contains many historical landmarks. Many of the hotels date from the 1850s, including the Cornish Arms hotel and the Sarah Sands Hotel on the corner of Brunswick Road. The Bombay Rock at the corner of Phoenix Street, was one of the pre-eminent rock music venues in Melbourne in the 1970s and 80s. 

Brunswick Town Hall, built in 1876 on the corner of Dawson Street, is an imposing Victorian edifice. It was saved from planned destruction by the municipal council in 1973-1974 when Vic and Vida Little, along with the Brunswick Progress Association, led a successful campaign to preserve it. The building was significantly extended and renovated in the early 1990s to upgrade the library, offices and public assembly spaces.

Diagonally opposite from the Town Hall stands the Mechanics Institute, built in 1868, and used for worker education and social activities. A monument to the Free Speech fights of the 1930s stands near the corner. The history of many of the single and double story shop fronts can be seen in the names and years moulded into the upper portions of the building facades. The Mechanics Institute now provides a popular performance space and offices for local arts administrators.

== Notable institutions ==
Sydney Road has a number of institutions that are notable for their contribution to the broader cultural life of Melbourne. The Mediterranean supermarket, between Victoria and Blyth Streets is a long-established, large and well-known source of Italian and other European foodstuffs. The A1 Middle Eastern Bakery, at the top of Brunswick Hill is the most high-profile of a number of such bakeries in the area, well known for products such as flat bread that are supplied across Melbourne. A tour of these bakeries forms part of Melbourne&#x27;s annual Food and Wine festival. Savers is a very popular supermarket-sized second-hand clothing store, located between Albert Street and Glenlyon Road. Well known for its bridal shops, a recent arrival in Sydney Road is Mariana Hardwick&#x27;s emporium in the eponymously (re)named building between Sparta Place and Ballarat Street.

== Transport ==

Tram route 19 runs along the inner section of Sydney Road, starting at Bakers Road in Coburg North and ending in Elizabeth Street at Flinders Street station in the city. The Upfield railway line from the city loop runs parallel to Sydney Road about 200m to the west, with stations at Jewell, Brunswick, Anstey, Moreland and Coburg. The road has historically been signed as Route 31, but since the opening of the Craigieburn Bypass has been relegated to Route 55.

<doc id="1101347" wikidata="Q4698470" url="?curid=1101347" title="Airboy">
<text>Airboy is a fictional Golden Age aviator hero of an American comic book series initially published by Hillman Periodicals during the World War II, before ending his initial run in 1953. The hero was the costumed identity of crack pilot Davy Nelson II, and created by writers Charles Biro and Dick Wood with artist Al Camy.

The character disappeared from publications until a 1980s revival under Chuck Dixon that lasted for several years, focusing on the original Airboy&#x27;s son, Davy Nelson III, and reviving much of the Hillman library of supporting characters before ending in 1989.

Since then the original Hillman creations and stories have fallen into the public domain; as a result Airboy and his supporting cast have appeared intermittently since under multiple publishers, sometimes updating his story to the present day or continuing previous adventures.

==Publication history==
===Hillman Publications===
Airboy debuted in &quot;Air Fighters Comics&quot; #2 (cover-date Nov. 1942), an anthology series featuring a variety of aviator heroes; the first issue of the title had been published a year before, featuring a completely different cast of characters who were never seen again. The series was renamed &quot;Airboy Comics&quot; with the twenty-third issue, vol. 2, #11 (Dec. 1945), and ran 89 issues, through vol. 10, #4 (May 1953).

In the early issues, Biro wrote the scripts with Dave Wood and drew the covers, Al Camy was the initial story artist. He was followed by Tony DiPreta and, beginning with &quot;Air Fighters&quot; #10 (July 1943), Fred Kida, who would become closely associated with the series. Ernie Schroeder became the regular artist with &quot;Airboy Comics&quot; vol. 5, #11 (Dec. 1948), through the end of the series&#x27; run, with Dan Barry, Maurice Del Bourgo, Carmine Infantino, and others supplying an occasional story.

One of Airboy&#x27;s most frequently recurring supporting characters was the German aviator Valkyrie, who fought on the side of the Axis as one of the Airmaidens but then defected to the Allies. The cleavage-baring aviatrix was one of the most popular characters in the series, making numerous appearances. Chuck Dixon, writer of the 1980s revival, would describe Valkyrie as &quot;a cross between a Milton Caniff siren and Veronica Lake&quot;, and declare her the &quot;sexiest character of Golden Age comics bar none&quot;.

An unusual feature of the series was that Airboy broadly aged in real-time, starting out as a young teenager at the start of his adventures; Kida credited the idea for this development to &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;. Following the Allies&#x27; victory in World War II in 1945, the series re-orientated and featured Airboy battling against the new terror, Communists.

The two consecutive series also contained backup stories about other aviators, including Skywolf, Iron Ace, the Black Angel, the Bald Eagle, the Flying Dutchman and the Flying Fool, before Hillman stopped publishing comics in 1953 due to the fall-out from Fredric Wertham&#x27;s infamous &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;, the incoming oversight of the Comics Code Authority and a general downturn in the market. Hillman subsequently left the publishing business altogether in 1961. Two issues were reprinted in 1973 by Don Maris&#x27; Nostalgia Inc. &quot;Comic Reprints&quot;, and a trade paperback entitled &quot;Valkyrie!: From the Pages of Air Fighters and the Airboy&quot; was published in 1982 by Ken Pierce Books with five stories featuring the femme fatale.

====Synopsis====
Airboy was David (&quot;Davy&quot;) Nelson II, the son of an expert pilot and, despite his youth, a crack flyer himself; he was also an expert mechanic and a skilled hand-to-hand combatant. His friend, inventor and Franciscan friar Brother Francis Martier, had created a highly maneuverable prototype aircraft that flew by flapping its wings, like a bird; it also had claws for grabbing opponents, twin machine guns and could be summoned by radio. However, Martier was killed while testing it, and Davy inherited both the plane and a uniform, which had apparently been in the friar&#x27;s family since the French Revolution. Davy soon christened himself &quot;Airboy&quot;, and in his seemingly sentient new plane, &quot;Birdie&quot;, helped the Allies during World War II.

Airboy confronted such weird antagonists as the mysterious Misery – whose mould-encrusted Airtomb imprisoned the souls of dead pilots – and his bad girl nemesis, Valkyrie, a whip-wielding German aviator clad in jodhpurs and riding boots. She led the crack all-female flying squad the Airmaidens before defecting and becoming an ally after witnessing the cruelty of superior Herr Oberst towards her charges. Other opponents included the hideously deformed Nazi fanatic the Black Ace and immortal CroMagnon occultist Zzed. Allies included the prototypical comic book swamp monster, the Heap, a World War I German aviator transformed into a shambling creature after crashing in a bog.

The other Air Fighters were a host of colourful heroic Allied pilots – the wolf-cowled Skywolf and his unit, consisting of a Cockney known as Cocky Roche, overage Royal Air Force veteran the Judge and Morse code-communicating mute Free Pole The Turtle, who all flew combining &#x27;semi-planes&#x27; and fought the cyborg Half-Man; the vengeful Flying Dutchman, who warred with the Deathless Brain, the cerebrum of an English-speaking Imperial Japanese Army officer that operated out of a jar equipped with tentacles; the blaze-depilated Bald Eagle and his fatalistically-named &#x27;Flying Coffin&#x27; plane; the improbably armour-suited Iron Eagle and his similarly ironclad but still flightworthy plane, who battled Nazi arson enthusiast Firebug; and English aristocrat Black Angel, who operated out of a secret hangar in her castle with partner Black Prince, with whom she fought the sadistic Baroness Blood and the son of Grigori Rasputin.

===Eclipse Comics===

While editing Pierce the collection, Cat Yronwode – then editor-in-chief of Eclipse Comics – discovered that the copyright to the &quot;Air Fighters&quot; characters expired in 1986. She and Eclipse publisher Dean Mullaney planned to revive the characters, and sat on the information for four years in the hope that other publishers would not discover the lapse. As a result the Air Fighters cast became one of the few properties the company apparently owned, with the remainder being creator-owned. However, unlike properties owned by the American major publishers of the period the creative staff of &quot;Airboy&quot; would retain ownership of their work, and any additional characters created for the series.

Timothy Truman was approached to write and draw the new series on the basis of his success with &quot;Scout&quot; for Eclipse; a fan of the originals, he readily agreed. However, when Truman&#x27;s friend Chuck Dixon heard Airboy was being revived he was determined to be involved, and would end up writing the series. Mullaney, Yronwode, Truman and Dixon worked together on the initial idea, and opted to update the action to the present day and have Davy Nelson III, son of the original Airboy, take over his father&#x27;s legacy. Supporting characters Valkyrie, Misery and Skywolf were all included, while Truman updated Hirota – a Japanese pilot who was the first &#x27;kill&#x27; for Nelson Sr. during &quot; Air Fighters&quot; to now serve as his batman and tutor to his son. While the costumes of Airboy, Misery, the Heap and Valkyrie remained largely unchanged, Skywolf was updated to have a more modern costume – Yronwode would describe the wolf-pelt original look as &quot;the dumbest costume ever invented&quot; – and now piloted an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. Realising Valkyrie&#x27;s plunging neckline and sultry looks were an important draw, Dixon devised a storyline where she was kept in suspended animation by the villain Misery, allowing her to remain youthful while also providing a plausible reason for David Nelson II&#x27;s fall from grace. He briefly considered omitting Airboy&#x27;s possibly sentient aircraft Birdie as it was too far fetched but ultimately Truman persuaded him it was part of the character&#x27;s charm, likening it to the Batmobile. The update to the modern day allowed Dixon to have the Air Fighters&#x27; escapades reference the Cold War foreign policy of both the USA and the USSR, albeit through thinly-veiled fictional countries.

&quot;Airboy&quot; was initially published in an innovative format of a 50c bi-weekly consisting of 16 pages, allowing Eclipse to undercut Marvel and DC (a typical 32-page colour comic from &quot;the Big Two&quot; cost 75c). It would alternate with another bi-weekly 16-page title, &quot;The New Wave&quot;, as part of Eclipse&#x27;s plan to build a connected fictional universe; the Heap was planned to be the common denominator for the two titles. &quot;Airboy&quot; launched to strong sales. As planned, after two issues Truman stepped down as artist to be replaced by Stan Woch; Truman would however remain as the series&#x27; editor. Among the cover artists were Truman, Paul Gulacy, Dave Stevens (who got to draw the cover for the third issue, which announced Valkyrie&#x27;s return to consciousness) However the 50c price was deemed unsustainable, and from #9 the title was priced at $1.25, though unlike &quot;The New Wave&quot; (which was soon to be cancelled) it remained bi-weekly. The new expanded format saw Skywolf receive his own back-up feature from #9, written by Dixon. Initially this featured art from Larry Elmore before he handed over to Tom Lyle (pencils) and Romeo Tanghal (inks) from #12 onwards. However, Woch felt the schedule was causing a drop in the quality of his work and left; Bo Hampton drew two issues before Ron Randall took over as regular artist. &quot;Airboy&quot; #25 spotlighted concerns about California&#x27;s environment, leading to mainstream news coverage of the issue on CNN, while #28 set up crossover one-shot &quot;Airboy-Mr. Monster Special&quot;, pairing the characters with Michael T. Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Monster&quot;.

Valkyrie remained a popular attraction for both readers and creators, and in May 1987 the character received a three-issue spin-off limited series, with art by Gulacy. Capitalising on her sex appeal, each issue featured pinups from popular artists including Brian Bolland, Steve Leialoha, Brent Anderson and Bruce Jones, as well as a new piece by original Hillman artist Fred Kida.; the series was soon collected in a trade paperback, &quot;Valkyrie – Prisoner of the Past&quot;, with a new painted cover from Gulacy, and was followed by the one-shot sequel the &quot;Air Maidens Special&quot;, featuring art from Elmore. Dixon however was finding his attempts to set up 4Winds and launch new titles &quot;Strike!&quot; and &quot;Winterworld&quot; were consuming his time, and from #33 &quot;Airboy&quot; switched to a monthly schedule. This change did however mean that Woch agreed to return as artist, while Dan Spiegle took over art duties for the &quot;Skywolf&quot; back-up feature from &quot;Airboy&quot; #34.

To make up for the reduced schedule, Eclipse started the reprint series &quot;Air Fighters Classics&quot;, reprinting Hillman material. Despite the 1940s material depicting the Japanese in an offensive manner for propaganda reasons, the publisher chose not to censor the series. However, the original negatives for the material were lost, and as a result Eclipse had to strike new masters from vintage issues.

The characters also appeared in a crossover with Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Strike!&quot;, the D-Day-set &quot;The Airfighters Meet Sgt. Strike Special&quot;. A further spin-off, a limited series focusing on the Heap and written by &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; co-creator Len Wein, was mooted but instead appeared as a back-up in &quot;Airboy&quot; #38–40, featuring art from Carmine Infantino. Skywolf would graduate to his own Vietnam War-set three issue mini-series in 1988, written by the prolific Dixon and drawn by Lyle, while Valkyrie would also receive a second mini after the previous year&#x27;s success, with Anderson joining as artist. Further spin-offs were the one-shots &quot;Target: Airboy&quot;., &quot;Airmaidens vs. Airboy&quot;. (which Yronwode would describe as &quot;the closest Eclipse comes to an annual Swimsuit special&quot;) and a crossover with Truman&#x27;s Prowler characters in &quot;Airboy Meets The Prowler&quot;.

By this stage Airboy was firmly established as one of Eclipse&#x27;s most popular characters, and the Air Fighters would occupy major roles in Eclipse&#x27;s tenth-anniversary mini-series &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, which also saw Hillman villain Zzed revived as the antagonist. However, the output for the character would soon rapidly dwindle. While &quot;Air Fighters Classics&quot; continued to sell well but would stall for several months while Eclipse searched for a copy of &quot;Air Fighters Comics&quot; (Vol. 1) #6. A planned &quot;Airboy Graphic Album&quot; intended to bridge the gap between the Hillman and Eclipse material was instead reworked as the contents of &quot;Airboy&quot; #46–49, a storyline named &quot;The Diary of Airboy&quot; and featuring Ernie Colón as artist afer Woch again left

The title began to suffer delays; the double-sized &quot;Airboy&quot; #50 featured Andy Kubert on pencils, Adam Kubert on inks and a Joe Kubert cover, and appeared four months after #49. Inside it included a text piece from Yronwode taking up the letters page informing readers it would be the last issue &quot;for the foreseeable future&quot;, listing difficulties in finding a suitable artist to replace Woch full-time as Colón had proved too slow, falling sales and alleged controversy over the book&#x27;s political controversy. With &quot;Airboy&quot; &quot;on hiatus&quot; related titles were also halted, with &quot;Air Fighters Classics&quot; and a mooted &quot;Skywolf&quot; one-shot with art from Alberto Maldonato.

While Eclipse would issue the trade paperback &quot;The Return of Valkyrie&quot;, reprinting &quot;Airboy&quot; #1–5 with a cover from Jim Steranko, Dixon moved onto other projects including &quot;Merchants of Death&quot; and the company&#x27;s adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as the publisher moved away from ongoing comics. No new material featuring Airboy or his supporting characters appeared before Eclipse went out of business in 1995.

====Plot====
After the conclusion of World War II, David Nelson II continued to work as a freelance pilot and mercenary for a time, but he eventually retired from combat flying and stored Birdie in a barn outside his California estate. He had a son, whom he named David Nelson III, and founded an aircraft manufacturing company, through which he became very wealthy. In the mid-1980s, David Nelson II was assassinated by mercenaries from the South American nation of Bogantilla. When David Nelson III discovered that his father had been assassinated, he began to investigate the circumstances which had led up to his father&#x27;s death. He soon discovered his father&#x27;s mothballed plane and uniform and teamed up with a number of the surviving Air Fighters to face many of the same enemies as David Nelson II, as well as South American dictators, Soviets, pirates and corporate criminals.

====Reception====
Reception to the revival was largely positive. In 1987, &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; reviewer R.A. Jones listed it as one of the 10 best titles of the previous year, calling it &quot;a captivating action-adventure strip&quot;. Don Thompson meanwhile lauded the fast pacing, while Roger Zelazny was also positive. Martin A. Stever reviewed the title in &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 83. Stever commented that &quot;the key to this book&#x27;s success has been the balance Dixon has stuck between adventure, humor, mystery, and romance. This, along with break-neck pacing and plenty of action in every issue have made &quot;Airboy&quot; a monthly even I look forward to&quot;.

The 1987 &quot;Valkyrie&quot; mini-series received a positive review Darwin McPherson in &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;, describing it as &quot;a fun read&quot; even if he felt characterisation was light.
However in the same magazine Gary D. Robinson was more reserved about &quot;Airboy&quot; #50, questioning the need to make the hero so flawed.

===Other publishers===
====McFarlane Productions====
Eclipse&#x27;s intellectual property rights were later acquired by Todd McFarlane for a total of $25,000. The purchase was widely rumoured to be entirely motivated by the then-common belief it included the rights to another Eclipse title, &quot;Miracleman&quot; At the time it was also widely believed it included the rights to &quot;Airboy&quot; too, and in 1998 McFarlane produced a one-shot called &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; featuring radically redesigned versions of the characters in his art style. Only the Heap would go on to any further appearances in McFarlane&#x27;s work, making occasional guest appearances in &quot;Spawn&quot;.

====Moonstone Books====
However, it was later learned that the trademark for Airboy had expired when Eclipse folded, and that despite Mullaney and Yronwode indicating otherwise in interviews to prevent rivals from using the character, the remainder of the &quot;Air Fighters&quot; canon remained in the public domain. As a result in 2007 Moonstone Books announced plans to revive the World War II version of the character in new stories written by Chuck Dixon. However, the revival did not see print until March 2009, when Moonstone released the one-shot &quot;Airboy – 1942: Best of Enemies&quot;, followed by two issues of anthology &quot;Airfighters&quot; in 2010, with a variety of creators including Dixon and Tom DeFalco, and the one-shots &quot;Airboy Presents: Air Vixens&quot; and &quot;Airboy/G8&quot;, a crossover with fellow vintage comics aviator G-8 The Moonstone material, which featured black-and-white interior art, was later collected in the trade paperback &quot;Airboy and the Airfighters – Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, which also included the previously-unprinted 30-page story &quot;Insurrection&quot;, originally planned as one-shot &quot;Airfighters: L&#x27;Hospital St. Blaise&quot;.

====Antarctic Press====
The character next resurfaced at Antarctic Press in 2012, again featuring the Golden Age version of the character. The five-issue mini-series &quot;Airboy: Deadeye&quot; was co-written by Dixon with Gianluca Piredda, with art from Antarctic founder Ben Dunn.

====Image Comics====
Image Comics began publishing a new Airboy comic in 2014, written by James Robinson and illustrated by Greg Hinkle. The metafictional four-issue series begins with fictionalised versions of Robinson and Hinkle engaging in an orgy of drink, drugs and sex while trying to find the inspiration to write a new &quot;Airboy&quot; series, only for the &quot;real&quot; Airboy to enter their world, much to the clean-cut character&#x27;s horror. The series was attacked by GLAAD and others for its transphobia.

====IDW Publishing====
While the Hillman intellectual property is in the public domain under the conditions of his Eclipse contract Dixon and the other creators on the 1980s version of the title retained copyright to their work, and as such Dixon and Truman were able to coordinate a series of reprints for IDW Publishing. &quot;Airboy Archives&quot; ran through five volumes, reprinting all of the Eclipse material bar the main story of &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; (which featured numerous characters whose copyright was held by others – most notably Miracleman, who had recently been acquired by Marvel Comics and the special &quot;Target: Airboy&quot; (which had featured Clint from Don Chin&#x27;s &quot;Adolescent Radioactive Black Belt Hamsters&quot;). Dixon edited the collection, and arranged the various mini-series and specials in their intended reading order.

====It&#x27;s Alive====
Dixon then collaborated with Drew Ford of It&#x27;s Alive Press to raised funds via crowdfunding website Indiegogo to continue the story from where &quot;Airboy&quot; #50 left off. After reaching its first goal &quot;Airboy&quot; #51, introducing appeared in October 2019, featuring art by Brent McKee and variant covers by Paul Gulacy, Jim Steranko, Graham Nolan, Don Perlin, Matt Kindt, Andrew MacLean, Dalibor Talajić and Emma Kubert.&quot;Airboy&quot; #52 was published in August 2022, drawn by Stipe Kalajzic. Ford&#x27;s sudden death in October 2022 led to the shutdown of It&#x27;s Alive Press.

<text>The 45th New Zealand Parliament was a term of the Parliament of New Zealand. Its composition was determined by the 1996 election, and it sat until the 1999 election.

The 45th Parliament was notable in that it was the first to be elected under the new MMP electoral system, a form of proportional representation. It was also notable for the fact that it was the first New Zealand Parliament to have an Asian person, Pansy Wong, elected to it. The difference between the 45th Parliament and its predecessor were considerable — the 44th Parliament had opened with only four seats being held by minor parties, but at the opening of the 45th Parliament, minor parties held thirty-nine seats. Because of the considerably altered balance of power in Parliament, neither of the two major parties could govern alone, and New Zealand First, the largest of the four other parties in Parliament, was put in the position of &quot;kingmaker&quot;. In the end, New Zealand First opted for a coalition with the National Party which had governed in the previous Parliament, marking the first coalition government in New Zealand for over half a century. The Labour Party continued in Opposition.

The 45th Parliament consisted of one hundred and twenty representatives. Sixty-five of these representatives were chosen by geographical electorates, including five Māori electorates. The remainder were elected by means of party-list proportional representation under the MMP electoral system.

==Electoral boundaries for the 45th Parliament==
==Overview of seats==
The table below shows the number of MPs in each party following the 1996 election and at dissolution:


Notes
* New Zealand First initially entered into a coalition with the National Party, which broke down in 1998. Half the party resigned and became independents, while the other half remained with the party and joined the opposition.
* A collection of small parties were founded and received representation by independent MPs who were formerly with New Zealand First and Alliance. They supported the National Party in government.
* ACT and United Future extended support to the National Party, giving the government a slim majority in parliament.
* The Green Party sat in Parliament under the banner of the Alliance Party.
*The Working Government majority is calculated as all Government MPs less all other parties.

==Initial composition of the 45th Parliament==
45th New Zealand Parliament – MPs elected to Parliament

List MPs are ordered by allocation as determined by the Chief Electoral Office and the party lists.

==By-elections during 45th Parliament==
There was one by-election held during the term of the 45th Parliament.

===Summary of changes during term===
*Jim Gerard, a National Party list MP, resigned from Parliament in April 1997 to take up a post as High Commissioner in Ottawa. He was replaced by Annabel Young, the next candidate on National&#x27;s list.
*Alamein Kopu, an Alliance list MP, resigned from her party in July 1997. She eventually formed her own party, Mana Wahine Te Ira Tangata.
*Jim Bolger, having been replaced as Prime Minister by Jenny Shipley in 1997, left Parliament in 1998. This caused a by-election in his Taranaki-King Country seat, won by Shane Ardern of the National Party.
*Neil Kirton, a New Zealand First list MP, resigned from his party in July 1998 after ongoing conflict with its leadership. Kirton opposed his party&#x27;s coalition with the National Party, and believed that the National Party was too dominant in the agreement. Kirton became an independent.
*After the collapse of the coalition between the National Party and New Zealand First, the junior partner, New Zealand First, splintered. Eight MPs (Jenny Bloxham, Peter Brown, Brian Donnelly, Ron Mark, Robyn McDonald, Winston Peters, Doug Woolerton, and Tu Wyllie) remained with the party, and eight MPs (Ann Batten, Tuariki Delamere, Jack Elder, Tau Henare, Peter McCardle, Tuku Morgan, Deborah Morris, and Rana Waitai) resigned and become independents. The MPs who resigned did not remain united, and eventually split four ways.
**Batten, Elder, Henare, Morgan, and Waitai established the Mauri Pacific party.
**Delamere joined the Te Tawharau party.
**Morris resigned from Parliament. She was replaced by Gilbert Myles, the next candidate on her former party&#x27;s list. Myles remained attached to New Zealand First.
**McCardle remained an independent.
*Jill White, a Labour Party list MP, resigned from Parliament in 1998 to become Mayor of Palmerston North. She was replaced by Helen Duncan, the next candidate on Labour&#x27;s list.
*Paul East, a National Party list MP, resigned from Parliament in 1999 to take up a post as High Commissioner in London. He was replaced by Alec Neill, the next candidate on National&#x27;s list.
*Frank Grover, an Alliance list MP, resigned from his party on 11 June 1999. He joined the Christian Heritage Party.

<doc id="1101359" wikidata="Q432087" url="?curid=1101359" title="Chris Ryan">
<text>Colin Armstrong, (born 1961), usually known by the pen-name Chris Ryan, is a British author, television presenter, security consultant and former Special Air Service sergeant.

After the publication of fellow patrol member Andy McNab&#x27;s &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot; in 1993, Ryan published his own account of his experiences during the Bravo Two Zero mission in 1995, entitled &quot;The One That Got Away&quot;. 
Since retiring from the British Army Ryan has published several fiction and non-fiction books, including &quot;Strike Back&quot;, which was subsequently adapted into a television series for Sky 1, and co-created the ITV action series &quot;Ultimate Force&quot;. He has also presented or appeared in numerous television documentaries connected to the military or law enforcement.

==Early life, education and military service==
Ryan was born in Rowlands Gill in Gateshead. After attending Hookergate School, he enrolled in the British Army at the age of 16. Ryan&#x27;s cousin was a member of the reservist 23 SAS Regiment and invited Ryan to come up and &quot;see what it&#x27;s like to be in the army&quot;. Ryan did this nearly every weekend, almost passing selection several times, but was too young to do &#x27;test week&#x27;. When he was old enough, he passed selection into 23 SAS. Shortly after that he began selection for the regular 22 SAS Regiment and joined &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron as a medic. Needing a parent regiment, Ryan and a former sailor who had joined 22 SAS from the Royal Navy, spent eight weeks with the Parachute Regiment before returning to &#x27;B&#x27; Squadron.

During the 1980s he was part of an SAS team sent to Thailand by the UK government to train the deposed and internationally-recognised Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (which included elements of the Khmer Rouge) in tactics used against the Vietnamese-backed forces of the People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea during the conflict which followed the invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam in 1979. However Ryan and his team were returned to Britain after the journalist John Pilger published details of the (classified) deployment.

==Bravo Two Zero==
During the Gulf War, Ryan was a team member of the ill-fated eight-man SAS patrol, with the call sign Bravo Two Zero. The patrol was sent into Iraq to &quot;gather intelligence... find a good LUP (lying up position) and set up an OP (observation post)&quot; on the main supply route (MSR) between Baghdad and North-Western Iraq, and eventually take out the Scud TELs. 

However they were compromised and forced to head towards Syria on foot. Ryan walked , from an observation point on the Iraqi MSR between Baghdad and North-Western Iraq, to the Syrian Border. This march made SAS history as the &quot;longest escape and evasion by an SAS trooper or any other soldier&quot;, covering more than SAS trooper Jack Sillito had in the Sahara Desert in 1942.

During his escape, Ryan suffered injuries from drinking water contaminated with nuclear waste. Besides suffering severe muscle atrophy, he lost and did not return to operational duties. Instead, he selected and trained potential recruits, before being honourably discharged from the SAS in 1994. 

On 29 June 1991 Ryan was awarded the Military Medal &quot;in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in the Gulf in 1991&quot; although the award was not gazetted until 15 December 1998 together with the equally delayed announcement of Andy McNab&#x27;s Distinguished Conduct Medal.

==Post-military career==
After leaving the SAS, Ryan wrote &quot;The One That Got Away&quot;, which covers the account from his patrol report of the Bravo Two Zero mission. Both his and McNab&#x27;s accounts have been heavily criticised by former territorial SAS member and explorer Michael Asher, who attempted to retrace the patrol&#x27;s footsteps for TV and claimed to have debunked both accounts with the help of his friend, the then-SAS regimental sergeant major Peter Ratcliffe.

Ryan has written more than 70 books, both fiction and non-fiction. Many of his works are well known, such as fictional works like &quot;Strike Back (2007)&quot;, which was adapted into the TV show, and &quot;Firefight (September 2008)&quot;. He also writes fictional books for teenage readers, including the Alpha Force Series and &quot;Code Red&quot;, and has written a romantic novel, &quot;The Fisherman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, under the pseudonym Molly Jackson.

In addition to his writing Ryan has contributed to several television series and video games. In 2002 Ryan co-created and appeared in ITV&#x27;s action series, &quot;Ultimate Force&quot;, playing the role of Blue Troop leader Staff Sergeant Johnny Bell in the first series. He acted as a military adviser for the video game &quot;I.G.I.-2: Covert Strike&quot;. 

Ryan was the star of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Hunting Chris Ryan&quot; in 2003 which later aired on the Military Channel as &quot;Special Forces Manhunt&quot;. In 2004 Ryan produced several programmes titled &quot;Terror Alert: Could You Survive&quot;, demonstrating how to survive disasters including flooding, nuclear terrorist attack, mass blackouts, and plane hijackings. In 2005, Ryan presented a Sky One show called &quot;How Not to Die&quot;, detailing how to survive various life-threatening situations. In 2007 Ryan trained and managed a six-man team to represent Team GB at Sure for Men&#x27;s Extreme Pamplona Chase in Spain during the Running of the Bulls and also appeared in an episode of the Derren Brown series, &quot;Mind Control with Derren Brown&quot;, where he booby-trapped a course for Brown to follow whilst blindfolded. Ryan presented the television series &quot;Elite World Cops&quot;, also broadcast as &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot;, which aired on Bravo in 2008. In the show, Ryan spends time with law enforcement agencies around the world.

==Personal life==
Ryan has one daughter.

His experiences in Iraq caused him to suffer from post traumatic stress disorder. Also, following his consumption of radioactive water during his Bravo Two Zero escape he was warned not to have any children in the future.

<doc id="1101361" wikidata="Q902728" url="?curid=1101361" title="Liming (soil)">
<text>Liming is the application of calcium- (Ca) and magnesium (Mg)-rich materials in various forms, including marl, chalk, limestone, burnt lime or hydrated lime to soil. In acid soils, these materials react as a base and neutralize soil acidity. This often improves plant growth and increases the activity of soil bacteria, but oversupply may result in harm to plant life. Modern liming was preceded by marling, a process of spreading raw chalk and lime debris across soil, in an attempt to modify pH or aggregate size. Evidence of these practices dates to the 1200&#x27;s and the earliest examples are taken from the modern British Isles.

== Impact on soil properties ==
Liming can also improve aggregate stability on clay soils. For this purpose structure lime, products containing calcium oxide (CaO) or hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) in mixes with calcium carbonate (CaCO3), are often used. Structure liming can reduce losses of clay and nutrients from soil aggregates. The degree to which a given amount of lime per unit of soil volume will increase soil pH depends on the buffer capacity of the soil (this is generally related to soil cation exchange capacity or CEC). 

Most acid soils are saturated with aluminum rather than hydrogen ions. Soil acidity generally results from hydrolysis of aluminum. This concept of &quot;corrected lime potential&quot; to define the degree of base saturation in soils became the basis for procedures now used in soil testing laboratories to determine the &quot;lime requirement&quot; of soils.

Soils with low CEC will usually show a more marked pH increase than soils with high CEC. But the low-CEC soils will witness more rapid leaching of the added bases, and so will see a quicker return to original acidity unless additional liming is done. Over-liming is most likely to occur on soil that has low CEC, such as sand which is deficient in buffering agents such as organic matter and clay.

=== Effect on soil organic carbon ===
The net effect of soil liming on soil organic carbon is primarily the result of three processes.
# Increased plant productivity resulting in larger organic matter inputs. As soil liming ameliorates soil conditions that inhibit plant growth, an increase in plant productivity is expected. The higher yields resulting from lime applications will produce increased returns of organic matter to the soil in the form of dying roots and decaying crop residue. 
# Increased organic matter mineralization due to a more favorable pH. Lime applications are known to have short-term stimulating effects on soil biological activity, thus favoring organic matter mineralization and very likely accelerating organic matter turnover rates in soil.
# Amelioration of soil structure leading to a reduction of mineralization by means of protecting soil organic carbon. Liming is known to ameliorate soil structure, as high Ca2+ concentrations and high ionic strength in the soil solution enhance the flocculation of clay minerals and, in turn, form more stable soil aggregates.

An agricultural study at the Faculty of Forestry in Freising, Germany, that compared tree stocks two and twenty years after liming found that liming promotes nitrate leaching and decreases the phosphorus content of some leaves.

<doc id="1101363" wikidata="Q413968" url="?curid=1101363" title="Dimercaprol">
<text>Dimercaprol, also called British anti-Lewisite (BAL), is a medication used to treat acute poisoning by arsenic, mercury, gold, and lead. It may also be used for antimony, thallium, or bismuth poisoning, although the evidence for those uses is not very strong. It is given by injection into a muscle.
Common side effects include high blood pressure, pain at the site of the injection, vomiting, and fever. It is not recommended for people with peanut allergies as it is typically formulated as a suspension in peanut oil. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Dimercaprol is a chelator and works by binding with heavy metals. It has a very pungent odor.
Dimercaprol was first made during World War II. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
Dimercaprol has long been the mainstay of chelation therapy for lead or arsenic poisoning, and it is an essential drug. It is also used as an antidote to the chemical weapon Lewisite. Nonetheless, because it can have serious adverse effects, researchers have also pursued development of less toxic analogues, such as succimer.

Wilson&#x27;s disease is a genetic disorder in which copper builds up inside the liver and other tissues. Dimercaprol is a copper chelating agent that has been approved by the FDA to treat Wilson&#x27;s disease.

Dimercaprol also shows effectiveness against snakebite by potently antagonizing the activity of Zn2+-dependent snake venom metalloproteinases &quot;in vitro&quot;.

== Mechanism of action ==

Arsenic and some other heavy metals act by chelating with adjacent thiol residues on metabolic enzymes, creating a chelate complex that inhibits the affected enzyme&#x27;s activity. Dimercaprol competes with the thiol groups for binding the metal ion, which is then excreted in the urine.

Dimercaprol is itself toxic, with a narrow therapeutic range and a tendency to concentrate arsenic in some organs. Other drawbacks include the need to administer it by painful intramuscular injection Serious side effects include nephrotoxicity and hypertension.

Dimercaprol has been found to form stable chelates &quot;in vivo&quot; with many other metals including inorganic mercury, antimony, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, gold, and nickel. However, it is not necessarily the treatment of choice for toxicity to these metals. Dimercaprol has been used as an adjunct in the treatment of the acute encephalopathy of lead toxicity. It is a potentially toxic drug, and its use may be accompanied by multiple side effects. Although treatment with dimercaprol will increase the excretion of cadmium, there is a concomitant increase in renal cadmium concentration, so that its use in case of cadmium toxicity is to be avoided. It does, however, remove inorganic mercury from the kidneys; but is not useful in the treatment of alkylmercury or phenylmercury toxicity. Dimercaprol also enhances the toxicity of selenium and tellurium, so it is not to be used to remove these elements from the body.

==History==
The original name of dimercaprol reflects its origins as a compound secretly developed by British biochemists at Oxford University in the beginning of the World War II, with the first synthesis in July 1940 as an antidote for lewisite, a now-obsolete arsenic-based chemical warfare agent.

<doc id="1101364" wikidata="Q3234036" url="?curid=1101364" title="Gaussian units">
<text>Gaussian units constitute a metric system of units of measurement. This system is the most common of the several electromagnetic unit systems based on the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS). It is also called the Gaussian unit system, Gaussian-cgs units, or often just cgs units. The term &quot;cgs units&quot; is ambiguous and therefore to be avoided if possible: there are several variants of CGS, which have conflicting definitions of electromagnetic quantities and units.

SI units predominate in most fields, and continue to increase in popularity at the expense of Gaussian units. Alternative unit systems also exist. Conversions between quantities in the Gaussian and SI systems are direct unit conversions, because the quantities themselves are defined differently in each system. This means that the equations that express physical laws of electromagnetism—such as Maxwell&#x27;s equations—will change depending on the system of quantities that is employed. As an example, quantities that are dimensionless in one system may have dimension in the other.

== Alternative unit systems ==

The Gaussian unit system is just one of several electromagnetic unit systems within CGS. Others include &quot;electrostatic units&quot;, &quot;electromagnetic units&quot;, and Heaviside–Lorentz units.

Some other unit systems are called &quot;natural units&quot;, a category that includes atomic units, Planck units, and others.

The International System of Units (SI), with the associated International System of Quantities (ISQ), is by far the most common system of units today. In engineering and practical areas, SI is nearly universal and has been for decades. In technical, scientific literature (such as theoretical physics and astronomy), Gaussian units were predominant until recent decades, but are now getting progressively less so. The 8th SI Brochure mentions the CGS-Gaussian unit system, but the 9th SI Brochure makes no mention of CGS systems.

Natural units may be used in more theoretical and abstract fields of physics, particularly particle physics and string theory.

== Major differences between Gaussian and SI systems ==

=== &quot;Rationalized&quot; unit systems ===

One difference between the Gaussian and SI systems is in the factor in various formulas that relate the quantities that they define. With SI electromagnetic units, called &quot;rationalized&quot;, Maxwell&#x27;s equations have no explicit factors of in the formulae, whereas the inverse-square force laws – Coulomb&#x27;s law and the Biot–Savart law – have a factor of attached to the . With Gaussian units, called &quot;unrationalized&quot; (and unlike Heaviside–Lorentz units), the situation is reversed: two of Maxwell&#x27;s equations have factors of in the formulas, while both of the inverse-square force laws, Coulomb&#x27;s law and the Biot–Savart law, have no factor of attached to in the denominator.

(The quantity appears because is the surface area of the sphere of radius , which reflects the geometry of the configuration. For details, see the articles &quot;Relation between Gauss&#x27;s law and Coulomb&#x27;s law&quot; and &quot;Inverse-square law&quot;.)

=== Unit of charge ===

A major difference between the Gaussian system and the ISQ is in the respective definitions of the quantity charge. In the ISQ, a separate base dimension, electric current, with the associated SI unit, the ampere, is associated with electromagnetic phenomena, with the consequence that a unit of electrical charge (1 coulomb = 1 ampere × 1 second) is a physical quantity that cannot be expressed purely in terms of the mechanical units (kilogram, metre, second). On the other hand, in the Gaussian system, the unit of electric charge (the statcoulomb, statC) be written entirely as a dimensional combination of the non-electrical base units (gram, centimetre, second), as:

For example, Coulomb&#x27;s law in Gaussian units has no constant:
formula_1
where is the repulsive force between two electrical charges, and are the two charges in question, and is the distance separating them. If and are expressed in statC and in centimetres, then the unit of that is coherent with these units is the dyne.

The same law in the ISQ is:
formula_2
where is the vacuum permittivity, a quantity that is not dimensionless: it has dimension (charge)2 (time)2 (mass)−1 (length)−3. Without , the equation would be dimensionally inconsistent with the quantities as defined in the ISQ, whereas the quantity does not appear in Gaussian equations. This is an example of how some dimensional physical constants can be eliminated from the expressions of physical law by the choice of definition of quantities. In the ISQ, converts or scales electric flux density, , to the corresponding electric field, (the latter has dimension of force per charge), while in the Gaussian system, electric flux density is the same quantity as electric field strength in free space aside from a dimensionless constant factor.

In the Gaussian system, the speed of light appears directly in electromagnetic formulas like Maxwell&#x27;s equations (see below), whereas in the ISQ it appears via the product .

=== Units for magnetism ===

In the Gaussian system, unlike the ISQ, the electric field and the magnetic field have the same dimension. This amounts to a factor of  between how is defined in the two unit systems, on top of the other differences. (The same factor applies to other magnetic quantities such as the magnetic field, , and magnetization, .) For example, in a planar light wave in vacuum, in Gaussian units, while in the ISQ.

=== Polarization, magnetization ===

There are further differences between Gaussian system and the ISQ in how quantities related to polarization and magnetization are defined. For one thing, in the Gaussian system, &quot;all&quot; of the following quantities have the same dimension: , , , , , and . A further point is that the electric and magnetic susceptibility of a material is dimensionless in both the Gaussian system and the ISQ, but a given material will have a different numerical susceptibility in the two systems. (Equation is given below.)

== List of equations ==

This section has a list of the basic formulae of electromagnetism, given in both the Gaussian system and the International System of Quantities (ISQ). Most symbol names are not given; for complete explanations and definitions, please click to the appropriate dedicated article for each equation. A simple conversion scheme for use when tables are not available may be found in Garg (2012).
All formulas except otherwise noted are from Ref.

=== Maxwell&#x27;s equations ===
Here are Maxwell&#x27;s equations, both in macroscopic and microscopic forms. Only the &quot;differential form&quot; of the equations is given, not the &quot;integral form&quot;; to get the integral forms apply the divergence theorem or Kelvin–Stokes theorem.

=== Other basic laws ===

=== Dielectric and magnetic materials ===

Below are the expressions for the various fields in a dielectric medium. It is assumed here for simplicity that the medium is homogeneous, linear, isotropic, and nondispersive, so that the permittivity is a simple constant.
where
* and are the electric field and displacement field, respectively;
* is the polarization density;
* formula_3 is the permittivity;
* formula_4 is the permittivity of vacuum (used in the SI system, but meaningless in Gaussian units); and
* formula_5 is the electric susceptibility.

The quantities formula_6 and formula_7 are both dimensionless, and they have the same numeric value. By contrast, the electric susceptibility formula_8 and formula_9 are both unitless, but have for the same material:
formula_10

Next, here are the expressions for the various fields in a magnetic medium. Again, it is assumed that the medium is homogeneous, linear, isotropic, and nondispersive, so that the permeability is a simple constant.
where
* and are the magnetic fields;
* is magnetization;
* formula_11 is magnetic permeability;
* formula_12 is the permeability of vacuum (used in the SI system, but meaningless in Gaussian units); and
* formula_13 is the magnetic susceptibility.

The quantities formula_14 and formula_15 are both dimensionless, and they have the same numeric value. By contrast, the magnetic susceptibility formula_16 and formula_17 are both unitless, but has in the two systems for the same material:
formula_18

=== Vector and scalar potentials ===
The electric and magnetic fields can be written in terms of a vector potential and a scalar potential :

=== Electrical circuit ===
where
* is the electric charge
* is the electric current
* is the electric potential
* is the magnetic flux
* is the electrical resistance
* is the capacitance
* is the inductance

=== Fundamental constants ===

== Electromagnetic unit names ==


Note: The SI quantities formula_4 and formula_12 satisfy .

The conversion factors are written both symbolically and numerically. The numerical conversion factors can be derived from the symbolic conversion factors by dimensional analysis. For example, the top row says \approx {2.998 \times 10^9 \,\mathrm{Fr}} \,/\, {1\,\mathrm{C}}&lt;/math&gt;,}} a relation which can be verified with dimensional analysis, by expanding formula_4 and coulombs (C) in SI base units, and expanding statcoulombs (or franklins, Fr) in Gaussian base units.

It is surprising to think of measuring capacitance in centimetres. One useful example is that a centimetre of capacitance is the capacitance between a sphere of radius 1 cm in vacuum and infinity.

Another surprising unit is measuring resistivity in units of seconds. A physical example is: Take a parallel-plate capacitor, which has a &quot;leaky&quot; dielectric with permittivity 1 but a finite resistivity. After charging it up, the capacitor will discharge itself over time, due to current leaking through the dielectric. If the resistivity of the dielectric is seconds, the half-life of the discharge is seconds. This result is independent of the size, shape, and charge of the capacitor, and therefore this example illuminates the fundamental connection between resistivity and time units.

=== Dimensionally equivalent units ===

A number of the units defined by the table have different names but are in fact dimensionally equivalent – i.e., they have the same expression in terms of the base units cm, g, s. (This is analogous to the distinction in SI between newton-metre and joule.) The different names help avoid ambiguities and misunderstandings as to what physical quantity is being measured. In particular, of the following quantities are dimensionally equivalent in Gaussian units, but they are nevertheless given different unit names as follows:

== General rules to translate a formula ==

Any formula can be converted between Gaussian and SI units by using the symbolic conversion factors from Table 1 above.

For example, the electric field of a stationary point charge has the ISQ formula
formula_22
where is distance, and the &quot;&quot; superscript indicates that the electric field and charge are defined as in the ISQ. If we want the formula to instead use the Gaussian definitions of electric field and charge, we look up how these are related using Table 1, which says:
formula_23

Therefore, after substituting and simplifying, we get the Gaussian-system formula:
formula_24
which is the correct Gaussian-system formula, as mentioned in a previous section.

For convenience, the table below has a compilation of the symbolic conversion factors from Table 1. To convert any formula from the Gaussian system to the ISQ using this table, replace each symbol in the Gaussian column by the corresponding expression in the SI column (vice versa to convert the other way). Replace formula_25 by formula_26 (or vice versa). This will reproduce any of the specific formulas given in the list above, such as Maxwell&#x27;s equations, as well as any other formula not listed.


After the rules of the table have been applied and the resulting formula has been simplified, replace all combinations formula_26 by formula_25.

<text>MVA85A (modified vaccinia Ankara 85A) is a vaccine against tuberculosis developed by researchers led by Professor Helen McShane at Oxford University. It is a viral vector vaccine and consists of an MVA virus engineered to express the 85A antigen once it infects a host cell. 85A is a cell-wall protein of the tuberculosis bacillus.

This vaccine produces higher levels of long-lasting cellular immunity when used together with the older TB vaccine BCG. Phase I clinical trials were completed in 2008 and then phase II clinical trials took place in South Africa. Efficacy trials ran in parallel from 2009 to 2019. Results released in February 2013 were described as &quot;disappointing&quot;, showing only a statistically insignificant prevention rate in infants. A summary of animal studies published in 2015 cast doubt on the efficacy of the vaccine.

In 2018, a &quot;BMJ&quot; investigation raised concerns about the ethics of an efficacy trial in South African infants, particularly because of results from earlier animal trials such as a study with macaques at Porton Down. One response argued that 14 prior human trials showed a safety signal, that regulators were aware of the primate trial and decided to continue, and that three subsequent investigations found no evidence of wrong-doing. Another response by Ian Orme questioned the critique of animal models.

<doc id="1101376" wikidata="Q2844835" url="?curid=1101376" title="Americanism (heresy)">
<text>Americanism was, in the years around 1900, a political and religious outlook attributed to some American Catholics and denounced as heresy by the Holy See.

In the 1890s, European &quot;continental conservative&quot; clerics detected signs of modernism or classical liberalism, which Pope Pius IX had condemned in the &quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot; in 1864, among the beliefs and teachings of many members of the American Catholic hierarchy, who denied the charges. Pope Leo XIII wrote against these ideas in a letter to Cardinal James Gibbons, published as .

The long-term result was that the Irish Catholics who largely controlled the Catholic Church in the United States increasingly demonstrated loyalty to the pope, and suppressed traces of liberal thought in Catholic colleges. At bottom, the conflict was cultural, as conservative American Catholics from continental Europe, angered at the heavy attacks on the Catholic Church in Germany, France and other countries, sought to weaken individualist attitudes among American Catholics.

==In Europe==
During the French Third Republic, which began in 1870, the power and influence of French Catholicism steadily declined. The French government passed laws bearing more and more stringently on the Catholic church, and the majority of French citizens did not object. Indeed, they began to look toward legislators and not to the clergy for guidance.

Observing this, and encouraged by the action of Pope Leo XIII, who in 1892 called on French Catholics to accept the Republic, several young French priests set themselves to stop the decline in church power. They determined that because the church was predominantly sympathetic to the monarchists and hostile to the Republic, and because it held itself aloof from modern philosophies and practices, people had turned away from it. Some progressive priests believed that the church had not adapted to modern needs. They began a domestic apostolate which had for one of its rallying cries, (&quot;Let us go to the people&quot;). They agitated for social and philanthropic projects, for closer contacts between priests and parishioners, and for general cultivation of personal initiative, both in clergy and in laity. They looked for inspiration to America, where they saw a vigorous church among a free people, with priests publicly respected, and with a note of aggressive zeal in every project of Catholic enterprise.

===Isaac Hecker===
In the 1890s, this issue was brought forcefully to the attention of European Catholics by Comtesse de Ravilliax&#x27;s translation of a biography of Isaac Hecker by the Paulist priest Walter Elliott in 1891; the book&#x27;s introduction by Félix Klein drew ire from the Vatican. Hecker, commonly known as &quot;The Yellow Dart,&quot; had been dead for years at this point and had never been viewed by the Pope with disfavor. The French translation of Hecker&#x27;s biography and Klein&#x27;s introduction to the book made him appear to have been much more of a radical than he in fact was.

Hecker had sought to reach out to Protestant Americans by stressing certain points of Catholic teaching, but Pope Leo XIII understood that effort as a watering down of Catholic doctrine. Hecker also had used terms such as &quot;natural virtue,&quot; which to the pope suggested the Pelagian heresy. Because members of the Paulist Fathers took promises but not the vows of religious orders, many concluded that Hecker denied the need for external authority.

The French liberals particularly admired Hecker for his love of modern times and modern liberty and his devotion to liberal Catholicism. Indeed, they took him as a kind of patron saint. Inspired by Hecker&#x27;s life and character, the activist French priests undertook the task of persuading their fellow-priests to accept the political system, and then to break out of their isolation, put themselves in touch with the intellectual life of the country, and take an active part in the work of social . In 1897, the movement received a new impetus when Denis J. O&#x27;Connell, former rector of the Pontifical North American College in Rome, spoke on behalf of Hecker&#x27;s ideas at the Catholic Congress in Fribourg.

===Opposition===
Some Catholics complained to the Pope, and in 1898, Charles Maignen wrote an ardent polemic against the new movement called (&quot;Is Father Hecker a Saint?&quot;). The critiques of European conservatives were reinforced by those of German American Catholic bishops in the Midwest, such as Frederick Katzer and John Joseph Frederick Otto Zardetti, who were deeply concerned by how completely Americanist Bishops of Irish descent like John Ireland, John J. Keane, and James Gibbons had come to dominate the American Catholic Church. Arthur Preuss (1871–1934) the foremost German American Catholic intellectual in the United States, was an outspoken enemy, filling his scholarly journal &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; with criticisms of Americanist theology.

Many powerful Vatican authorities also opposed the &quot;Americanist&quot; tendency. Pope Leo XIII was reluctant to chastise the American Catholics, whom he had often praised for their loyalty and faith. In 1899 he wrote Cardinal Gibbons, &quot;It is clear...that those opinions that, taken as a whole, some designate as &#x27;Americanism&#x27; cannot have our approval.&quot;

==Suppression==
In the 1895 encyclical (&quot;Wide Expanse of the Ocean&quot;), Pope Leo XIII indicated a generally positive view of the American Church, commenting mostly on the success of Catholicism in the US but also noting the view that the church &quot;would bring forth more abundant fruits if, in addition to liberty, she enjoyed the favor of the laws and the patronage of the public authority.&quot; Leo warned the American church hierarchy not to support this unique system of separation of church and state.

In 1898, Leo lamented for America where church and state are &quot;dissevered and divorced&quot;, and wrote of his preference for a closer relationship between the Catholic Church and the State, along European lines.

Finally, in his letter (January 22, 1899; &quot;Witness to Our Benevolence&quot;) addressed to James Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore, Leo condemned other forms of Americanism. 

Pope Leo XIII also expressed concerns about the cultural liberalism of some American Catholics: he pointed out that the faithful could not decide doctrine for themselves. He emphasized that Catholics should obey the magisterial teaching authority of the church. In general, he deemed it dangerous to expose children to schools that would prove to be detrimental to their Christian upbringing. The Pope derided the idea that all opinions should be aired publicly, as he felt certain speech could harm general morality. He also condemned the biography of Hecker and Americanism.

This document condemned the following doctrines or tendencies:

* Undue insistence on interior initiative in the spiritual life, as leading to disobedience
* Attacks on religious vows, and disparagement of the value of religious orders in the modern world
* Minimizing Catholic doctrine
* Minimizing the importance of spiritual direction

The brief did not assert that Hecker and the Americans had held any unsound doctrine on the above points. Instead, it merely stated that if such opinions did exist, the local hierarchy was to eradicate them.

===American response===
In response to , Gibbons and many other American prelates replied to Rome with a near-unanimous voice, denying that American Catholics held any of the condemned views. They asserted that Hecker had never countenanced the slightest departure from Catholic principles in their fullest and most strict application.

The disturbance caused by the condemnation was slight; almost the entire laity and a considerable part of the clergy were unaware of this affair. The Pope&#x27;s brief did end up strengthening the position of the conservatives in France. Leo&#x27;s pronouncements effectively ended the Americanist movement and curtailed the activities of American progressive Catholics. Historian Thomas McAvoy argues there were grave long-term negative effects on the intellectual life of American Catholics.

Bernard McQuaid, bishop of Rochester, was a forerunner of the Americanism dispute. He was quick to recognize the mingling of liberalism and Catholicism—which he called &quot;false Americanism&quot;—and distinguish it from living the ideals of republicanism and democracy—&quot;true Americanism.&quot; McQuaid was very suspicious of secret societies, non-Catholic schooling, and even some of his fellow bishops. He was particularly concerned about John Ireland, John Keane, and James Cardinal Gibbons, all of whom McQuaid considered &quot;too conciliatory to Protestant-minded America.&quot;

John Ireland, archbishop of Saint Paul, Minnesota and a foremost modernizer, had to walk on eggshells to avoid condemnation for his views. Ireland, joined by John J. Keane, archbishop of Dubuque, sought to adapt the social and religious values of the Catholic Church to American political and cultural values, especially religious liberty, separation of church and state, cooperation with non-Catholics, and lay participation in ecclesiastical decisionmaking. Many of his ideas were implicitly condemned by Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s (1899) as a heresy and Americanism. Nevertheless, Ireland continued to promote his views. When similar European views were condemned by Pope Pius X&#x27;s (1907), Ireland actively campaigned against what the pope declared the heresy of modernism. This apparently inconsistent behavior stemmed from Ireland&#x27;s concept of a &quot;golden mean&quot; between &quot;ultraconservatism&quot;, rendering the Catholic church irrelevant, and &quot;ultraliberalism,&quot; discarding the church&#x27;s message.

==Americanization==
Others, such as Orestes Brownson—an abolitionist Catholic public intellectual—were not satisfied with the system of national parishes. Considered an Americanizer, he advocated for immigrants to believe their Catholic identities supersede national divides and personally opposed training priests in the ethnically divided American seminaries. Bishop John Hughes believed that Brownson was part of a &quot;&#x27;club&#x27; of liberal intellectuals...who wanted to Americanize the church&quot;. He publicly denounced Brownson for giving the 1860 commencement address at Fordham University.
