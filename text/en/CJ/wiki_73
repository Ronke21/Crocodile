<text>The Lyre of Orpheus is a 1988 novel by Canadian author Robertson Davies first published by Macmillan of Canada. &quot;Lyre&quot; is the last of three connected novels of the &quot;Cornish Trilogy&quot;. It was preceded by &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; (1981) and &quot;What&#x27;s Bred in the Bone&quot; (1985).

==Plot==
In &quot;The Lyre of Orpheus&quot;, the executors of the will of Francis Cornish (the subject of &quot;What&#x27;s Bred in the Bone&quot;) find themselves at the head of the &quot;Cornish Foundation&quot;. The directors of the Foundation, who are the three remaining Frank Cornish&#x27;s estate executors, being Professor the Reverend Simon Darcourt, Arthur Cornish, and Maria Cornish, plus Professor Clement Hollier and Stratford, Ontario actor Geraint Powell, are called upon to decide what projects deserve funding. They decide that an unfinished opera by E. T. A. Hoffmann will be finished and staged at Stratford; to this end, they hire a brilliant young composition student, Hulda Schnakenburg (&quot;Schnak&quot;), to complete the opera as her PhD. dissertation, while Darcourt is charged with the completion of the libretto, which James Planché had attempted to write.

The opera to be completed is &quot;King Arthur or the Magnanimous Cuckold&quot;. The storyline follows the writing and then production of the opera, and the plot parallels the legend of King Arthur, and in particular the triangle of King Arthur, his queen, Guenevere, and Lancelot. Geraint Powell, using deception, fathers a child by Maria Cornish, forcing Arthur Cornish to choose between a generous or vindictive response. &quot;The Lyre of Orpheus&quot; not only explores the world of early eighteenth century opera, but also follows Darcourt&#x27;s research into the life of the benefactor and artist Francis Cornish. Darcourt discovers that a painting of &quot;The Wedding at Cana&quot;, previously attributed to an unknown sixteenth century painter known only as &quot;The Alchemical Master&quot;, was in fact the work of Francis Cornish himself, as described in the second book of the trilogy, &quot;What&#x27;s Bred in the Bone&quot;. A further plotline involves the sexual and artistic flowering of Hulda Schnakenburg under the hand of Gunilla Dahl-Soot, a distinguished Swedish musicologist who serves as Schnak&#x27;s academic advisor and becomes her lover.

The book explores a number of themes, including the pursuit of life beyond the ordinary or comfortable routine, which is exemplified in the artistic quest to produce the opera and in Darcourt&#x27;s quest to uncover the truth behind the painting of &quot;The Wedding at Cana.&quot; The theme of marriage is examined through the relationship between Arthur and Maria Cornish, a relationship tested by infidelity. And the modern approach to relationships is mocked in the dysfunctional common-law situation of two minor characters, Al and Mabel, who present themselves in Toronto to monitor and record the production of the opera from start to finish.

As often happens in Davies&#x27; novels, all is not simple; for example, the ghost of Hoffman, trapped in Limbo as a result of the unsatisfactory state of his artistic work, attends and comments on the proceedings. Nor is all peaceful among the characters, as they react to Powell&#x27;s seduction of Maria Cornish, Dahl-Soot&#x27;s seduction of Schnak, and the tensions created by the effort to mount an operatic production.

<doc id="1106195" wikidata="Q7755810" url="?curid=1106195" title="The Oxford Student">
<text>The Oxford Student is a newspaper produced by and for students of the University of Oxford; often abbreviated to The OxStu. The paper was established in 1991 by the Oxford University Student Union (Oxford SU) and is published fortnightly every Friday during term time.

== Structure ==
&quot;The Oxford Student&quot; is owned by the Oxford SU and run through the Student Union&#x27;s commercial subsidiary, &quot;Oxford Student Services Ltd&quot; (OSSL). The newspaper&#x27;s constitution grants the paper editorial independence. It enjoys close relations with Oxide Radio, also owned by Oxford SU.

Two Editors-In-Chief are appointed each term by the Oxford SU Media Board, a panel of former Editors-In-Chief, student sabbatical officers, and SU staff. The Editors-In-Chief are current students of the university who have complete editorial autonomy over the paper. After their appointment in the finals weeks of term, they are responsible for releasing editorial team applications for the upcoming term, inviting applicants to interview. Applications are competitive, and a team of anywhere from 30 to 80 students are accepted to edit and work on the publication each term.

Current sections of the newspaper include: News, Comment, Investigations, Features, Identity, Profile, Science &amp; Technology, Culture (consisting of Life and Entertainment sub-sections), OxYou, E-Sports and Sports. In addition, there is a Broadcasting Team which produces video content for the paper&#x27;s website and social media platforms.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lack of sports fixtures within the university, the Sports section was temporarily changed to E-sports and Gaming in Trinity 2020 but will remain alongside Sport for Michaelmas 2020 due to its popularity.

In Hilary 2021, a new Green section was added to cover environmental and sustainability issues.

==Inclusivity==

In Michaelmas 2016, the newspaper introduced Pink (aimed towards LGBTQIA+ members of the university) as a sub-section of Features; due to its popularity, in Hilary 2017, Pink was launched as its own section. Edited and written by non-heterosexual or non-cisgender students, the newspaper regularly anonymises the Pink articles in order to protect the identities of writers who do not feel comfortable publicly authoring articles relating to LGBTQIA+ issues.

In January 2020, a new section was created called Identity, described as being &quot;dedicated to spotlighting the issues, opinions and experiences of BAME students within the University&quot;. Structured similarly to Pink, the editors of Identity - as well as those who submit writing to be published in the section - are BAME students at the university.

==Accolades==

&quot;The Oxford Student&quot; was named &quot;Student Newspaper of the Year&quot; at the &quot;Guardian&quot; Student Media Awards in 2001, was shortlisted in 2004 and 2012, and awarded the runner-up prize in 2007.

==Controversies==

In 2004, the newspaper gained national publicity when two reporters broke University rules to expose security flaws in the university&#x27;s computer network; the student journalists responsible, Patrick Foster and Roger Waite, were rusticated by the University Court of Summary Jurisdiction, but on appeal their punishment was reduced to a fine. Foster now works as Media Correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;, and Waite worked for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; for a few years after graduating.

In June 2021, the newspaper was the subject of controversy over perceived threats to their independence, after a vetting system was proposed which would have required student articles to be reviewed by a university-affiliated readers. In February 2025, &quot;Cherwell&quot; published a story accusing the Oxford University Student Union of suppressing the newspaper&#x27;s editorial independence. A private letter from three former editors-in-chief alleged that they had faced &quot;overbearing censorship&quot; when attempting to publish a story about OUSU issuing an apology to a former student union president.

==Notable contributors==

Former contributors include Laura Barton and Jonathan Wilson of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Mark Henderson and Rob Hands of &quot;The Times&quot;, and Karl Smith of &quot;The Independent&quot;.

<doc id="1106198" wikidata="Q684002" url="?curid=1106198" title="Not That Kind">
<text>Not That Kind is the debut studio album by American singer Anastacia. It was released on June 16, 2000, by Epic Records and Daylight Records. The album features production by Sam Watters, Louis Biancaniello, Ric Wake, Evan Rogers, Carl Sturken, Rickey Minor, and The Shadowmen.

Bolstered by the global success of lead single &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Love&quot;, the album reached the top two and top five of the majority of the countries in Europe and Oceania, including Australia, Germany and the UK (all number two), also topping the charts in New Zealand and Norway. Anastacia embarked on a promotional album tour that visited multiple countries, while three more singles were being released: title track &quot;Not That Kind&quot;, &quot;Cowboys &amp; Kisses&quot; and &quot;Made for Lovin&#x27; You&quot;. The album eventually sold over five million copies worldwide.

==Background==
In 1998, Anastacia was unemployed after being fired from a Los Angeles beauty salon for &quot;being too loud.&quot; Disappointed after years of bad luck in the music industry, she was considering switching to a career in child psychology, when Lisa Braude, who later became her manager, encouraged her to join the MTV talent show &quot;The Cut&quot; (1998), hosted by rapper Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes. Anastacia made her way to be one of the ten finalists, performing her own composition entitled &quot;Not That Kind&quot;. While the season was won by male-female rap duo Silk-E, Anastacia attracted the interest of record labels after appearing on the shows, having impressed singers Elton John and Michael Jackson as well as the show&#x27;s judges David Foster and Faith Evans. In March 1999, she signed a contract with Daylight Records, a custom label of Sony Music Entertainment&#x27;s Epic Records and began work on her debut album.

==Promotion==
&quot;I&#x27;m Outta Love&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on February 29, 2000. It received acclaim from music critics, many of whom praised its production and Anastacia&#x27;s vocal performance. A commercial success, it became the biggest-selling song of 2000 in both Australia and New Zealand and reached the top ten on most charts in appeared on. In the United States, the song peaked at number 92 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and spent three weeks on the chart only, though it fared better on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s component charts, reaching number two on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. The song&#x27;s music video, directed by Nigel Dick, was filmed on location at the Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. 

Title track &quot;Not That Kind,&quot; originally performed by Anastacia on the MTV talent show &quot;The Cut&quot; in 1998, was released as the album&#x27;s second single on October 2, 2000. The song received positive reviews from critics, with many praising its 1980s funk elements. It became a top hit in Italy, Scotland, and Spain and reached the top 20 on several further charts but failed to chart in the US. In France, the &quot;Not That Kind&quot; was awarded a silver certification in 2003. Directed by Marc Webb, the music video for &quot;Not That Kind&quot; was shot in New York City and opens with Anastacia singing the song in a club.

The country-flavoured soft rock tune &quot;Cowboys &amp; Kisses&quot; was issued as the album third single on January 22, 2001. It earned a mixed reception from music critics, and became a moderate commercial success, peaking at number 17 on the Scottish Singles Chart, while also reaching the top thirty in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom as well as the top forty in Italy and Switzerland. Anastacia reteamed with Nigel Dick for the music video for &quot;Cowboys &amp; Kisses&quot; which was filmed at the Camarillo Airport in January 2001 and depicts her as a cowgirl.

&quot;Made for Lovin&#x27; You&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth and final single on June 25, 2001. The uptempo track received positive reviews, and reached number five on the Dutch Top 40 Tipparade. It also peaked at number 27 on both the Scottish Singles Chart and the UK Singles Chart. The music video for &quot;Made for Lovin&#x27; You&quot; consists of several live performances, particularly a montage with scenes from her appearance at the Rock am Ring music festival in Germany in 2001. 

==Critical reception==
Tricia Boey from MTV Asia praised Anastacia for her voice which she described as &quot;a blue-eyed-soul version of Tina Turner or Chaka Khan&quot; but felt the material on &quot;Not That Kind&quot; was &quot;unworthy of it&quot;. She called it a &quot;collection of songs that relies on tried and tested pop tactics. But hey, this kind of material is fashionable these days and so this disc may very likely go on to sell billions of records. Too bad they couldn&#x27;t have matched that stunning voice to more interesting material.&quot; Similarly, Russell Baillie from &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; wrote: &quot;While her accompanying multi-producer debut is quite a showcase for the white New Yorker&#x27;s [...] black, soul-scorch of a voice, it&#x27;s not anything special in the song department. It doesn&#x27;t lack for variety, though, managing almost-earthy retro soul-funk, a big rock ballad, too much overblown diva stuff and points in between. No doubt it will prove quite the career-starter, but musically it shows that maybe Mariah divided by Macy doesn&#x27;t necessarily go.&quot;

AllMusic editor William Ruhlmann rated the album four out of five stars. He noted that &quot;Macy Gray demonstrated that a broad audience may respond to an older style if the singer herself is distinguished enough. Anastacia doesn&#x27;t have the kind of unique timbre that Gray does – in fact, the minute she opens her mouth she starts reminding you of other singers, especially Aretha Franklin – but she is clearly a big talent, and that should count for something.&quot; Chris Lorraine, writing for &quot;Blender&quot;, found that &quot;Anastacia&#x27;s understated vocals give even the clichés of &quot;Black Roses&quot; some plain-spoken credibility. Her throaty voice evokes the anonymous disco-inflected divas of the late &#x27;70s, particularly on the Chic-ish &quot;I&#x27;m Outta Love.&quot; But if Anastacia&#x27;s alto should prove too conventional for megastardom, her debut suggests there are many more syllables yet to be sung.

<text>In philosophy of science and philosophy of mind, cognitive closure is the proposition that human minds are constitutionally incapable of solving certain perennial philosophical problems. Owen Flanagan calls this position anti-constructive naturalism or the &quot;new mysterianism&quot; and the primary advocate of the hypothesis, Colin McGinn, calls it transcendental naturalism acknowledging the possibility that solutions may be knowable to an intelligent non-human of some kind. According to McGinn, such philosophical questions include the mind-body problem, identity of the self, foundations of meaning, free will, and knowledge, both &quot;a priori&quot; and empirical.

==Colin McGinn==

==Friedrich Hayek==
For Friedrich Hayek, &quot;The whole idea of the mind explaining itself is a logical contradiction&quot;... and &quot;takes this incompleteness—the constitutional inability of mind to explain itself—to be a generalized case of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem... Hayek is &quot;not&quot; a naturalistic agnostic, that is, the view that science &quot;currently&quot; cannot offer an explanation of the mind-body relationship, but in principle it could.&quot;

==John Tyndall==
==Noam Chomsky==
Noam Chomsky argues that the cognitive capabilities of all organisms are limited by biology and that certain problems may be beyond our understanding:
==Phenomena and noumena==
As argued in Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, human thinking is unavoidably structured by categories of the understanding:

These are ideas from which there is no escape and thus they pose a limit to thinking. What can be known through the categories is called &quot;things for us&quot; and what is outside the categories is unthinkable, called &quot;things in themselves&quot;.

==New mysterians==

In his (famous) essay &quot;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&quot; Thomas Nagel mentions the possibility of cognitive closure to the subjective character of experience and the (deep) implications that it has for materialist reductionist science. Owen Flanagan noted in his 1991 book &quot;Science of the Mind&quot; that some modern thinkers have suggested that consciousness will never be completely explained. Flanagan called them &quot;the new mysterians&quot; after the rock group Question Mark and the Mysterians. According to McGinn, the solution to the mind-body problem cannot be grasped, despite the fact that the solution is &quot;written in our genes&quot;.

Emergent materialism is a similar but different claim that humans are not yet smart enough to determine the relationship between mind and matter.

<doc id="1106211" wikidata="Q434521" url="?curid=1106211" title="Susan Brownmiller">
<text>Susan Brownmiller (born Susan Warhaftig; February 15, 1935) is an American journalist, author and feminist activist best known for her 1975 book &quot;Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape&quot;, which was selected by The New York Public Library as one of 100 most important books of the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Brownmiller was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Mae and Samuel Warhaftig, a lower-middle-class Jewish couple. She was raised in Brooklyn and was the only child of her parents. Her father emigrated from a Polish shtetl and became a salesman in the Garment Center and later a vendor in Macy&#x27;s department store, and her mother was a secretary in the Empire State Building. She later took the pen name Brownmiller, legally changing her name in 1961.

As a child Brownmiller was sent to the East Midwood Jewish Center for two afternoons a week to learn Hebrew and Jewish history. She would later comment, &quot;It all got sort of mishmashed in my brain except for one thread: a helluva lot of people over the centuries seemed to want to harm the Jewish people. ... I can argue that my chosen path – to fight against physical harm, specifically the terror of violence against women – had its origins in what I had learned in Hebrew School about the pogroms and The Holocaust.&quot;

She had &quot;a stormy adolescence&quot;, attending Cornell University for two years (1952 to 1954) on scholarships, but not graduating. She later studied acting in New York City. She appeared in two off-Broadway productions.

== Activism ==
Brownmiller also participated in civil rights activism, joining CORE and SNCC during the sit-in movement in 1964. Brownmiller volunteered for Freedom Summer in 1964, wherein she worked on voter registration in Meridian, Mississippi. According to her own account:

:Jan Goodman and I were in the second batch of volunteers for Mississippi Freedom Summer...When no one else at the Memphis orientation session volunteered for Meridian, Jan and I accepted the assignment. Between us, we had a good ten years of organizing experience, hers in Democratic primaries and presidential campaigns, mine in CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality, and both of us together in voter registration drives in East Harlem. The night we arrived in Meridian, a field secretary called a meeting, asking to see the new volunteers. Proudly we raised our hands. &#x27;Shit!&#x27; he exploded. &#x27;I asked for volunteers and they sent me white women.&#x27;

She first became involved in the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement in New York City in 1968, by participating in a consciousness-raising group in the newly formed New York Radical Women organization, where she stated &#x27;I&#x27;ve had three illegal abortions&#x27;.

Brownmiller went on to coordinate a sit-in against &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; in 1970. She began work on her book &quot;Against Our Will&quot; after a New York Radical Feminists speak-out on rape in 1971, and then spent four years researching and writing in the New York Public Library.

In 1972, Brownmiller signed her name to the &quot;Ms&quot;. campaign “We Have Had Abortions” which called for an end to &quot;archaic laws&quot; limiting reproductive freedom; they encouraged women to share their stories and take action.

In 1977, Brownmiller became an associate of the Women&#x27;s Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. She attended a feminist anti-pornography conference in 1978. She co-founded Women Against Pornography in 1979.

==Career==
Brownmiller&#x27;s path into journalism began with an editorial position at a &quot;confession magazine&quot;. She went on to work as an assistant to the managing editor at &quot;Coronet&quot; (1959–60), as an editor of the &quot;Albany Report,&quot; a weekly review of the New York State legislature (1961–1962), and as a national affairs researcher at &quot;Newsweek&quot; (1963–1964). In the mid-1960s, Brownmiller continued her career in journalism with positions as a reporter for NBC-TV in Philadelphia (1965), staff writer for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; (1965), and as a network news writer for ABC-TV in New York City (1966–68).

Beginning in 1968, she worked as a freelance writer; her book reviews, essays, and articles appeared regularly in publications including &quot;The New York Times,&quot; &quot;Newsday,&quot; &quot;The New York Daily News,&quot; &quot;Vogue,&quot; and &quot;The Nation.&quot; In 1968, she signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

In New York, she began writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and became a network TV newswriter at the American Broadcasting Company, a job she held until 1968. She continues to write and speak on feminist issues, including a memoir and history of Second Wave radical feminism titled &quot;In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution&quot; (1999). Her papers have been archived at Harvard, in the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America.

==&quot;Against Our Will&quot;==

&quot;Against Our Will&quot; (1975) is a feminist book in which Brownmiller argues that rape &quot;is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear.&quot; In order to write the book, after having helped to organize the New York Radical Feminists Speak-Out on Rape on January 24, 1971, and the New York Radical Feminists Conference on Rape on April 17, 1971, she spent four years researching rape. She studied rape throughout history, from the earliest codes of human law up into modern times. She collected clippings to find patterns in the way in which rape is reported in various types of newspapers, analyzed portrayals of rape in literature, films, and popular music, and evaluated crime statistics.

Brownmiller&#x27;s basic premise was contested by some sections of the left wing, who considered it untrue that &quot;all men benefit&quot; from the culture of rape, and who believed rather that it was possible to organize both women and men together to oppose sexual violence. The book also received criticism from feminists, including bell hooks and Angela Davis, who wrote Brownmiller&#x27;s discussion of rape and race became an &quot;unthinking partisanship which borders on racism&quot;.

After the book was published, she was named as one of the &quot;Time&quot; magazine people of the year. In 1995, the New York Public Library selected &quot;Against Our Will&quot; as one of 100 most important books of the 20th century.

==Honors==
Brownmiller won an Alicia Patterson Journalism Fellowship in 1973 to research and write about the crime of rape. She was named as one of 12 Women of the Year by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1975.

She is featured in the feminist history film &quot;She&#x27;s Beautiful When She&#x27;s Angry&quot; (2014).

==Personal life==
She has described herself as &quot;a single woman&quot;, even though &quot;I was always a great believer in romance and partnership.&quot; &quot;I would like to be in close association with a man whose work I respect,&quot; she told an interviewer in 1976, attributing her unmarried status to the fact that she was &quot;not willing to compromise.&quot; As of 2018, she has not married.

<doc id="1106213" wikidata="Q671617" url="?curid=1106213" title="Laplace distribution">
<text>In probability theory and statistics, the Laplace distribution is a continuous probability distribution named after Pierre-Simon Laplace. It is also sometimes called the double exponential distribution, because it can be thought of as two exponential distributions (with an additional location parameter) spliced together along the abscissa, although the term is also sometimes used to refer to the Gumbel distribution. The difference between two independent identically distributed exponential random variables is governed by a Laplace distribution, as is a Brownian motion evaluated at an exponentially distributed random time. Increments of Laplace motion or a variance gamma process evaluated over the time scale also have a Laplace distribution.

==Definitions==

===Probability density function===
A random variable has a formula_1 distribution if its probability density function is

: formula_2

where formula_3 is a location parameter, and formula_4, which is sometimes referred to as the &quot;diversity&quot;, is a scale parameter. If formula_5 and formula_6, the positive half-line is exactly an exponential distribution scaled by 1/2.

The probability density function of the Laplace distribution is also reminiscent of the normal distribution; however, whereas the normal distribution is expressed in terms of the squared difference from the mean formula_3, the Laplace density is expressed in terms of the absolute difference from the mean. Consequently, the Laplace distribution has fatter tails than the normal distribution. It is a special case of the generalized normal distribution and the hyperbolic distribution. Continuous symmetric distributions that have exponential tails, like the Laplace distribution, but which have probability density functions that are differentiable at the mode include the logistic distribution, hyperbolic secant distribution, and the Champernowne distribution.

===Cumulative distribution function===
The Laplace distribution is easy to integrate (if one distinguishes two symmetric cases) due to the use of the absolute value function. Its cumulative distribution function is as follows:
:formula_8

The inverse cumulative distribution function is given by

:formula_9

==Properties==
===Moments===

:formula_10

===Probability of a Laplace being greater than another ===

Let formula_60 be independent laplace random variables: formula_61 and formula_62, and we want to compute formula_63.

The probability of formula_64 can be reduced (using the properties below) to formula_65, where formula_66. This probability is equal to

formula_67

When formula_68, both expressions are replaced by their limit as formula_69:

formula_70

To compute the case for formula_71, note that formula_72

since formula_73 when formula_74 .

===Relation to the exponential distribution===
A Laplace random variable can be represented as the difference of two independent and identically distributed (iid) exponential random variables. One way to show this is by using the characteristic function approach. For any set of independent continuous random variables, for any linear combination of those variables, its characteristic function (which uniquely determines the distribution) can be acquired by multiplying the corresponding characteristic functions.

Consider two i.i.d random variables formula_17. The characteristic functions for formula_76 are

:formula_77

respectively. On multiplying these characteristic functions (equivalent to the characteristic function of the sum of the random variables formula_78), the result is

:formula_79

This is the same as the characteristic function for formula_80, which is

:formula_81

===Sargan distributions===
Sargan distributions are a system of distributions of which the Laplace distribution is a core member. A formula_82th order Sargan distribution has density
:formula_83
for parameters formula_84. The Laplace distribution results for formula_85.

==Statistical inference==
Given formula_86 independent and identically distributed samples formula_87, the maximum likelihood (MLE) estimator of formula_3 is the sample median,
:formula_89

The MLE estimator of formula_90 is the mean absolute deviation from the median,
:formula_91
revealing a link between the Laplace distribution and least absolute deviations.
A correction for small samples can be applied as follows:
:formula_92
(see: exponential distribution#Parameter estimation).

==Occurrence and applications==
The Laplacian distribution has been used in speech recognition to model priors on DFT coefficients and in JPEG image compression to model AC coefficients generated by a DCT.

*The addition of noise drawn from a Laplacian distribution, with scaling parameter appropriate to a function&#x27;s sensitivity, to the output of a statistical database query is the most common means to provide differential privacy in statistical databases.
*In regression analysis, the least absolute deviations estimate arises as the maximum likelihood estimate if the errors have a Laplace distribution.
*The Lasso can be thought of as a Bayesian regression with a Laplacian prior for the coefficients.
* In hydrology the Laplace distribution is applied to extreme events such as annual maximum one-day rainfalls and river discharges. The blue picture, made with CumFreq, illustrates an example of fitting the Laplace distribution to ranked annually maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% confidence belt based on the binomial distribution. The rainfall data are represented by plotting positions as part of the cumulative frequency analysis.
* The Laplace distribution has applications in finance. For example, S.G. Kou developed a model for financial instrument prices incorporating a Laplace distribution (in some cases an asymmetric Laplace distribution) to address problems of skewness, kurtosis and the volatility smile that often occur when using a normal distribution for pricing these instruments.

: The Laplace distribution, being a composite or double distribution, is applicable in situations where the lower values originate under different external conditions than the higher ones so that they follow a different pattern.

==Random variate generation==
Given a random variable formula_93 drawn from the uniform distribution in the interval formula_94, the random variable

:formula_95

has a Laplace distribution with parameters formula_3 and formula_90. This follows from the inverse cumulative distribution function given above.

A formula_98 variate can also be generated as the difference of two i.i.d. formula_99 random variables. Equivalently, formula_100 can also be generated as the logarithm of the ratio of two i.i.d. uniform random variables.

==History==
This distribution is often referred to as &quot;Laplace&#x27;s first law of errors&quot;. He published it in 1774, modeling the frequency of an error as an exponential function of its magnitude once its sign was disregarded. Laplace would later replace this model with his &quot;second law of errors&quot;, based on the normal distribution, after the discovery of the central limit theorem.

Keynes published a paper in 1911 based on his earlier thesis wherein he showed that the Laplace distribution minimised the absolute deviation from the median.

<text>Fondi (; Southern Laziale: &quot;Fùnn&quot;) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Latina, Lazio, central Italy, halfway between Rome and Naples. As of 2017, the city had a population of 39,800. The city has experienced steady population growth since the early 2000s, though this has slowed in recent years.

Before the construction of the highway between the latter cities in the late 1950s, Fondi had been an important settlement on the Roman Via Appia, which was the main connection from Rome to much of southern Italy.

==Geography==
Fondi is the main town of the Plain of Fondi (&quot;Piana di Fondi&quot; in Italian), a small plain between the Ausoni and Aurunci mountains and the Tyrrhenian Sea. The plain includes three lakes and is agriculturally very fertile. Most in evidence are greenhouses for the production of early crops for sale in Rome. The long sandy beach stretches from Sperlonga in the south-east to Terracina in the north-west and lies along the Gulf of Gaeta, with views (when the weather is clear) to the Pontine Islands. It is marked by a somehow well-preserved, typical Mediterranean coastal dune landscape.

The territory of Fondi is partially included in the Regional Natural Park of Monti Aurunci.

==History==

Fondi has an ancient history, beginning with early settlements about 1000 BC: later the area was settled by the Italic tribes of Aurunci and, subsequently, Volsci. According to the legend, it would have been founded by Hercules in memory of the killing of Cacus.

The first historical reference to Fondi dates to 338 BC, at the time of the Latin War, when its inhabitants (together with those of the nearby Formia) gained minor Roman citizenship status (&quot;civitas sine suffragio&quot;). After a failed attempt of revolt led by Vitruvius Vaccus (330 BC), Fondi remained a Roman prefecture; later (188 BC) it received full citizenship, with a government led by 3 aediles.

The importance of Fondi lay in its position across the old Via Appia. Begun in 312 BC, it was for more than two millennia the main roadway from Rome to southern Italy. Today the historical centre and surrounding wall of Fondi still form a square, as in the Roman camp walls, whose decumanus was formed by the city tract of the Via Appia.

After the Gothic War and the Lombard conquest of Italy, Fondi remained a dominion of the Eastern Roman Empire. Later a part of the Papal States, in 846 it was burnt out by the Saracens coming from their fortress of Garigliano: they settled there until they were defeated in the Battle of Circeus of 877, and Fondi was passed to the Duchy of Gaeta.

In 1140 Fondi passed to the Dell&#x27;Aquila family, of Norman heritage, and then, in 1299, to the powerful Caetani barons (in the person of Loffredo Caetani, nephew of Pope Boniface VIII), who for two centuries made Fondi the centre of their power, and a centre of artistic development as well. Here in 1378 the powerful Count Onorato I Caetani summoned the conclave in which the cardinals elected Clement VII against Urban VI (Western Schism).

The Caetani lost Fondi after Charles VIII of France&#x27;s expedition to southern Italy, and it was assigned to the condottiero Prospero Colonna. Under the Colonna the city met another period of artistic and cultural splendour, thanks of the court held by Giulia Gonzaga, who lived in Fondi between 1526 and 1534.

In 1534, Fondi was sacked by Barbarossa, who was seeking to kidnap the beautiful Giulia and bring her as a gift to his emperor Suleiman. However, she managed to escape, but many other inhabitants were enslaved in the Barbary slave trade.
Another sack followed in 1594, starting the decline of the city, which had in the meantime passed to the Carafa of Stigliano. In 1720 Fondi was acquired by the di Sangro family.

In 1818 the declining city, surrounded by malaria-infested marshes malaria and brigandage, lost the bishopric seat existing there since the very early years of Christianity.

After the Armistice of 8 September 1943, the anti-Fascist novelist Alberto Moravia and his wife Elsa Morante took refuge in Fondi; the experience inspired Moravia&#x27;s book &quot;La Ciociara&quot; (&quot;The Woman from Ciociaria&quot;) (1958).

==Economy==

Agriculture in the area around Fondi has always been favoured by the presence of abundant water sources and by the climatic conditions. The traditional production of citrus has been recently supplanted by that of vegetables and fruit of all kinds.

Fondi is the seat of an important market for agriculture and food products which distribute millions of tons of agricultural products every year.
==Main sights==
Fondi&#x27;s main sights include:
*The Castle, with a characteristic round tower standing more than , symbol of the city. The castle was built in the 14th century by Onorato I Caetani over a stretch of ancient Roman walls. In the 16th century it was the seat of Giulia Gonzaga&#x27;s court of literates and artists. Since 1987 it houses the city&#x27;s Museum.
*The adjacent &quot;Palazzo del Principe&quot; (&quot;Prince&#x27;s Palace&quot;), constructed in 1466–77 is attributed to the Catalan architect Matteo Forcimanya. Its portals, the mullioned window, the court and the loggiato form a synthesis of Catalan-Gothic and Angevine architectures.
*The Cathedral of St. Peter (Duomo, 14th century) is built over a Roman edifice identified as a temple of Jupiter. It houses the sepulchre of Cristoforo Caetani, a marble bishop cathedra and Cosmatesque pulpit from the 13th century, an &quot;Annunciation Tryptych&quot; by Cristoforo Scacco and &quot;Majesty with St. Peter and St. Paul&quot; by Antoniazzo Romano.
*The &quot;Collegiata di Santa Maria Assunta&quot;, preceded by a wide staircase and built in the 15th century by Onorato II Caetani. It has a Latin cross plant, with an aisle and two naves: main points of interests are a cyborium from 1491 and the venerated statue of the &quot;Madonna of the Sky&quot;.
*The medieval churches of &quot;San Domenico&quot; and &quot;San Francesco&quot;.
*Abbey of San Magno, Fondi

<text>Gäufelden is a municipality in the administrative district of Böblingen, in the German state of Baden-Württemberg.

==Geography==
Gäufelden is located in the upper Gäu about seven kilometres from Herrenberg and just as far from Nagold. The local subdistrict extends from 390 to 545 metres above sea level.

==Economy and Infrastructure==
===Traffic===
====Rail====
Gäufelden is connected to the national railway network via the Stuttgart–Horb railway. The railway station is served every two hours by regional express trains to Singen (in the opposite direction to Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof), by regional trains to Freudenstadt Hauptbahnhof or Rottweil, which also share every two hours in Eutingen im Gäu, and by individual regional trains to Herrenberg (in the opposite direction to Bondorf (b Herrenberg)). In the evenings from Monday to Friday, a pair of trains on the line of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, which otherwise ends in Eutingen im Gäu, will also be tied through to Herrenberg, which also stops in Gäufelden.

====Bus transport====
In order to provide a connection to the line of the Stuttgart S-Bahn to Kirchheim unter Teck, which terminates in Herrenberg, Gäufelden is served hourly by buses in the direction of Herrenberg.

====Roads====
Gäufelden is located on several &quot;Landesstraßen&quot; and &quot;Kreisstraßen&quot;.

==History==
The municipality was founded July 1, 1971 by the voluntary merger of the previously independent villages of Nebringen, Öschelbronn and Tailfingen.
Since then, the population has more than doubled. These three villages constitute &quot;Ortsteile&quot; (districts) of Gäufelden. Each district retains a &quot;Rathaus&quot; (town hall), but the administration is centralized in Öschelbronn.

<text>Jay Calvin Warren (born 29 July 1956) is a political figure from the Pacific territory of the Pitcairn Islands.

==Political roles==

Jay Warren was elected mayor of the last remaining British dependency in Oceania in the general election held on 15 December 2004, defeating Brenda Christian, who had held the mayoralty in an interim capacity following the dismissal from the post of her brother, Steve Christian, by the British authorities on 30 October 2004, following his rape convictions. Warren was expected to take up his duties sometime around Christmas, when he was to return from Tahiti, where his daughter Darylynn was hospitalized and recovering from a longboat accident in which her arm was nearly severed. Besides Darylynn, he has another child, Charlene.

Jay Warren was no stranger to the post to which he was elected. From 1 January 1991 to 31 December 1999, he served in an almost identical capacity as &quot;Magistrate,&quot; as the chief elected official was known prior to a constitutional revision in 1999. Previously, after a brief stint as a member of the Island Council in 1982, he had assumed the second-most influential position on the island in 1985, as chairman of the &quot;Internal Committee.&quot; He continued to hold this office up to his election to the office of magistrate in late 1990.

As magistrate throughout most of the 1990s, Warren had executive, legislative, and judicial authority, serving &quot;ex officio&quot; as chairman of the Island Council, which doubles as the dependency&#x27;s legislature and court. Following the constitutional review and the replacement of the magistrate by a mayor in 1999, Steve Christian was elected to the new position. Warren remained politically active, however, and served two further terms (in 2000 and 2002) as chairman of the Internal Committee.

Warren&#x27;s election to the mayoralty in 2004 was welcomed by British Deputy Governor Matthew Forbes. &quot;We appointed Jay as chairman of the (island&#x27;s) internal committee in the period after the trials and before this election,&quot; Forbes told Radio New Zealand from his office at the British High Commission (the equivalent of an embassy in Commonwealth countries) in Wellington. &quot;He&#x27;s very experienced and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll make a very good mayor.&quot;

He was succeeded by Mike Warren as mayor in December 2007.

==Charges and acquittal==

In the 2004 Pitcairn Islands sexual assault trial Warren was charged with the indecent assault of a 12-year-old girl. He was acquitted on 24 October 2004, the only one of the seven defendants to be found not guilty. He is the brother of Meralda Warren, who has also held political office and is one of the most vocal defenders of the islanders&#x27; traditional acceptance and practice of sexual activity from puberty onwards. Meralda Warren was also elected to the council on 15 December 2004.

<text>Edward Lascelles, 1st Earl of Harewood (7 January 1740 – 3 April 1820) was a British landowner, art collector, peer and, before which, member of parliament.

==Early life==
He was the son of Edward Lascelles, a senior customs official in Barbados, himself a son of Daniel Lascelles.

==Career==
On the death of his cousin, the childless Edwin Lascelles, 1st Baron Harewood, Edward inherited the family fortune made in the West Indies through customs positions and the slave trade. He vested much of his fortune in fine art. In 1799 he (or his immediate family benefit trust) was estimated to be the third-wealthiest small family unit in Britain, owning £2.9M ().

He sat as Whig member of parliament for Northallerton from 1761 to 1774 and from 1790 to 1796. The latter year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Harewood, of Harewood in the County of York. In 1812 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Lascelles and Earl of Harewood, in the County of York.

==Personal life==
On 12 May 1761, Lascelles was married to Anne Chaloner (–1805), a daughter of Thomas Chaloner of Guisborough and Mary Finny. Before her death on 22 February 1805, they had four children:

* Lady Mary Anne Lascelles (d. 1831), who married Richard York and had issue.
* Edward Lascelles, Viscount Lascelles (–1814), who died unmarried.
* Henry Lascelles, 2nd Earl of Harewood (1767–1841)
* Lady Frances Lascelles (–1817), who married Hon. John Douglas, a son of James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton and had issue.

Lord Harewood died on 3 April 1820 and was succeeded in his titles by his second son, Henry.

<text>Peter K. Unger (; born April 25, 1942) is a contemporary American philosopher and professor in the Department of Philosophy at New York University. His main interests lie in the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and the philosophy of mind.

==Biography==
Unger attended Swarthmore College at the same time as David Lewis, earning a B.A. in philosophy in 1962, and Oxford University, where he studied under A. J. Ayer and earned a doctorate in 1966.

Unger has written a defense of profound philosophical skepticism. In &quot;Ignorance&quot; (1975), he argues that nobody knows anything and even that nobody is reasonable or justified in believing anything.

In &quot;Philosophical Relativity&quot; (1984), he argues that many philosophical questions cannot be definitively answered.

In the field of applied ethics, his best-known work is &quot;Living High and Letting Die&quot; (1996). In this text, Unger argues that the citizens of first-world countries have a moral duty to make large donations to life-saving charities (such as Oxfam and UNICEF), and that once they have given all of their own money and possessions, beyond what is needed to survive, they should give what belongs to others, even if having to beg, borrow, or steal in the process.

In &quot;The Mental Problems of the Many&quot; (2002), he argues for substantial interactionist dualism on questions of mind and matter: that each of us is an immaterial soul. The argument is extended and fortified in his 2006 book &quot;All the Power in the World&quot;.

In &quot;Empty Ideas&quot; (2014), he argues that analytic philosophy has delivered no substantial results as to how things are with concrete reality.

<doc id="1106228" wikidata="Q7727642" url="?curid=1106228" title="The Cornish Trilogy">
<text>The Cornish Trilogy is three related novels by Canadian novelist, playwright, critic, journalist, and professor Robertson Davies.

The trilogy consists of &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; (1981), &quot;What&#x27;s Bred in the Bone&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Lyre of Orpheus&quot; (1988). The series explores the life and influence of Francis Cornish. In each novel, Davies looks at how underlying medieval patterns surface in modern lives. It takes place in the same universe as the Deptford Trilogy, with several characters from that trilogy either appearing or being mentioned. The Cornish Trilogy was abridged, dramatised and broadcast in 3 one-hour parts by the BBC in January 2001. The reduction in content to fit the time resulted in omission of numerous elements critical to the full complexity of the narrative as written. 

==&quot;The Rebel Angels&quot;==
The story of &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot; is set in motion by the death of eccentric art patron and collector Francis Cornish. University professors Clement Hollier, Urquhart McVarish, and Simon Darcourt are the executors of Cornish&#x27;s complicated will, which includes material that Hollier wants for his scholarly work in Medieval Studies. The deceased&#x27;s nephew Arthur Cornish, who stands to inherit the fortune, is also a character. All three executors (and Arthur) are intrigued by Maria Theotoky, Hollier&#x27;s half-Hungarian, half-Gypsy graduate student, while the plot revolves around John Parlabane: ex-monk, skeptic philosopher, famulus, and general mischief-maker. The intuitive theme in this novel is the Tarot. The novel was abridged and dramatised for radio by the BBC in 2001 with the title &quot;The Death Card&quot;.

==&quot;What&#x27;s Bred in the Bone&quot;==
&quot;What&#x27;s Bred in the Bone&quot; is the life story of Francis Cornish, whose death and will were the subject of &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot;. His was a full life, and we follow him through his childhood as a wealthy and precocious misfit in a small Ontario town, his education in Toronto (in which we meet Dunstan Ramsay from the Deptford Trilogy) and Oxford, his unusual apprenticeship as a restorer and painter in Nazi Germany, his wartime experiences in England, and his later career as a collector and a patron of the arts in Toronto. Cornish&#x27;s life story develops as related by Cornish&#x27;s daemon, a Mercurial influence who intervenes at crucial moments to ensure that Cornish becomes a great man, although that may be seen only after his death. Intuition in this novel is expressed through astrology. The novel was abridged and dramatised for radio by the BBC in 2001 with the title &quot;The Knave of Coins&quot;.

&quot;What&#x27;s Bred in the Bone&quot; was shortlisted for the 1986 Booker Prize.
“What’s bred in the bone” is available as an audible audiobook. As of 2024 the other two books were not. 

==&quot;The Lyre of Orpheus&quot;==
In the third novel, Simon Darcourt, Arthur Cornish, and Maria Cornish find themselves at the head of the &quot;Cornish Foundation&quot; and are called upon to decide what projects deserve funding. Their first assay into the world of humanist patronage is to support a precocious composer in completing an unfinished opera by E.T.A. Hoffmann entitled &quot;Arthur of Britain, or the Magnanimous Cuckold&quot;, and then bringing it to the stage at Stratford, Ontario. The novel follows the course of this project from inception to completion. At the same time, the archetypes in the opera are reflected in the personal lives of those involved: Arthur and Maria as the central &quot;ruling&quot; couple, Arthur&#x27;s best friend Geraint Powell, a Welsh actor-turned-director as Lancelot, Simon Darcourt as the household cleric and writer, and so on. In this final novel, archetypes tie together the three levels of Arthurian, Romantic, and modern characters. The novel was abridged and dramatised for radio by the BBC in 2001 with the title &quot;The Fool&quot;.

<doc id="1106230" wikidata="Q709997" url="?curid=1106230" title="Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthès">
<text>Baron Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d&#x27;Anthès (born Georges-Charles d&#x27;Anthès; 5 February 1812 – 2 November 1895) was a French military officer and politician. Despite his later career as a senator under the Second French Empire, D&#x27;Anthès is mostly known for fatally wounding the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin in a duel in 1837.

==Career==
Born in Colmar to aristocratic Alsatian parents, the first boy among six children, he was destined for a military career. He was therefore sent to Saint-Cyr, the premier French military academy, and, in 1830, as cavalry officer, he supported Charles X&#x27;s party during the July Revolution. After the exile of Charles X, d&#x27;Anthès refused to serve under the July Monarchy, resigned from the army and withdrew to his father&#x27;s home in Alsace.

As he was authorized by the French government to serve abroad without losing his nationality, he set off first for Prussia, then for Russia. In St. Petersburg, he succeeded in entering the Knights Guards of the Empress as cornet. Two years later, in 1836, he became lieutenant.

His family ties and good looks gave him access to St. Petersburg high society. It was there that he met the Dutch plenipotentiary to the court, Baron Heeckeren, who, after a lengthy correspondence and a journey to Alsace, proposed to d&#x27;Anthès&#x27;s father that he adopt his son as his own heir. After the agreement of the King of the Netherlands, Georges-Charles d&#x27;Anthès took the name of Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d&#x27;Anthès.

According to a booklet written by Prince A. Trubetskoy: &quot;...d&#x27;Anthès was known for his antics, quite inoffensive and appropriate to youths except the one, of which we learnt much later. I don&#x27;t know what to say: whether he took Heeckeren or Heeckeren took him [...] All in all, [...] in the intercourse with Heeckeren he was ever a passive partner.&quot;


D&#x27;Anthès met Pushkin and his wife, Natalia, a beautiful and flirtatious young woman who had many admirers. In the beginning, Pushkin took to d&#x27;Anthès amicably, yet the latter chose to court Natalia, and in a compromising way. Soon after, a number of Pushkin&#x27;s closest friends, as well as Pushkin himself, received copies of an anonymous lampoon on Pushkin. The lampoon was a mock letter awarding Pushkin the title of &quot;Deputy Grand Master and Historiographer of the Order of Cuckolds&quot;. Pushkin accused Heeckeren of being the lampoon&#x27;s author, though the true author has never been established. Expert research ruled out Heeckeren authorship as the lampoon (written in French) contained errors extremely unlikely for a native speaker, and such authorship would have been too risky for a diplomat. In the complicated affair that ensued, D&#x27;Anthès married Natalia&#x27;s sister, Yekaterina Goncharova, on 10 January 1837. It has been suggested that d&#x27;Anthès&#x27;s engagement and marriage to Natalia&#x27;s sister was devised to contradict society gossip that he was in pursuit of Natalia. In any event, this was not enough to settle the conflict between the two new brothers-in-law. After marrying Yekaterina, D&#x27;Anthès continued to behave provocatively with Natalia, instigating a new duel challenge.

On the evening of 27 January 1837, d&#x27;Anthès fired first, mortally wounding Pushkin in the stomach. Pushkin, who had fought several duels, managed to rise and shoot at d&#x27;Anthès, but only wounded him lightly in the right arm. As he lay on his deathbed, Pushkin sent a message to d&#x27;Anthès pardoning him of any wrongdoing. Pushkin died two days later, after which d&#x27;Anthès was imprisoned at Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg. Dueling was illegal in Russia, and d&#x27;Anthès was called to court, but he was pardoned by the Emperor. Stripped of his rank, he was escorted back to the frontier and ordered to leave Russia permanently. In Berlin, he was joined by his wife, and the couple returned to France, in his father&#x27;s region. There he began a successful political career: as first president of the local assembly, then member of the National Constituent Assembly from 1848 to 1852, and, at last, irremovable senator from 1852 to 1870.

His wife died on 15 October 1843 while giving birth to their fourth child. He died on 2 November 1895 at his family house of Soultz-Haut-Rhin (Sulz/Oberelsaß), then part of the German Empire.

<text>Brian Curtin (b. 1951/52) is a former barrister and Irish circuit court judge, who was tried for possessing images of child pornography. After the case collapsed, the question of whether Curtin could continue as a judge became the focus of political and legal dispute. An impeachment motion was launched in the Dáil in 2004 by Minister for Justice Michael McDowell. Curtin resigned in 2006 on grounds of ill health, and the motion lapsed.

==Early life and career==
Curtin is the only child of a builder and his wife, who had emigrated from near Tralee in county Kerry to south London where Brian was born and raised, attending St Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School, Putney Bridge Road, Wandsworth, as well as the Salesian College, in Surrey Lane, Battersea. In the 1970s he attended Trinity College Dublin, and qualified from King&#x27;s Inns in 1976. As a barrister he worked on the Kerry Babies Tribunal, and developed a high profile in Kerry.

Curtin married Miriam McGillicuddy, a solicitor and later mayor of Tralee. They have one daughter, and separated in c.1998. Curtin was involved in amateur drama, and presented a Sunday morning show on Radio Kerry. He was politically active in Fianna Fáil, and later the Progressive Democrats, for which party stood unsuccessfully for election to Tralee Town Council.

Curtin was appointed to the Garda Complaints Appeals Board in May 2001; to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in August 2001; and to the circuit court in November 2001. He heard cases on the Southwestern Circuit, encompassing his home county of Kerry.

==Trial and acquittal==
In May 2002, the Garda Síochána launched Operation Amethyst, a major investigation based on details received from Interpol in August 2001 of Irish credit card transactions made in 1999 to a child-pornography website in Texas. The operation led to numerous arrests and convictions. Detectives executed a search warrant on Curtin&#x27;s private residence, seized his computer and reported finding 273 pornographic images of children on the hard disk. Curtin was charged in January 2003. Following delays due to the judge&#x27;s ill-health, the trial took place in April 2004. At the trial, Curtin claimed that the search was illegal because it had taken place outside the limit of the 7-day warrant. The Gardaí claimed that the delay was due to Curtin&#x27;s extended absence from his home and that when it took place at 2:20pm on 27 May 2002, it was still within the 7-day limit. The trial judge ruled that the search was illegal. As a result, the computer evidence found could not be used. Without that evidence Curtin was found not guilty, the judge declaring that the case was &quot;crystal clear&quot;.

==Attempted impeachment==
There was considerable public outcry in response to the acquittal. Online opinion polls showed little support for his continuing to serve on the bench. Curtin refused a Government request to step down, claiming that under the Constitution of Ireland he could only be removed for &quot;stated misbehaviour&quot;. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; urged him to resign to prevent a constitutional crisis.

In June 2004 Justice Minister McDowell moved an impeachment motion in the Dáil, saying Curtin was &quot;unsuitable to exercise the office of a judge of the Circuit Court&quot;. This was only the second judicial &quot;impeachment&quot; motion under the 1937 Constitution — the first, in 1941, had been withdrawn. The Dáil suspended McDowell&#x27;s motion and established a joint Oireachtas select committee to examine the evidence. This inquiry was challenged by Judge Curtin in the courts. The challenges were unsuccessful and following a Supreme Court ruling in March 2006 upholding the process, the select committee took custody of the computer from the Gardaí and hired experts to examine it. Curtin suggested that malware could have downloaded the pornographic images his computer without his knowledge. The process took longer than expected but they planned to issue a report to the Oireachtas in late 2006 to facilitate a debate and vote.

In November 2006, Judge Curtin resigned from the judiciary on health grounds, ending the investigation. This occurred days before he was to give evidence in private to the committee, and days after he had completed five years on the bench, the minimum sufficient to qualify for a pension.

<text>Thomas Storer (c. 1571 – 1604) was an English poet and mathematician. His major work was the &quot;Life and Death of Cardinal Wolsey&quot;.

==Life==
He was the son of John Storer of London. He was elected a student of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1587, and graduated B.A. on 27 March 1591, M.A. on 13 May 1604. He died in London in November 1604, and was buried in the church of St Michael Bassishaw.

==Works==
In 1599 appeared &quot;The Life and Death of Thomas Wolsey, cardinall. … By Thomas Storer, student of Christ Church in Oxford. At London printed by Thomas Dawson&quot;. The poem is written on the model of Thomas Churchyard&#x27;s legend on the history of Wolsey in &quot;The Mirrour for Magistrates&quot;. It consists of three parts, &quot;Wolseius aspirans&quot;, &quot;Wolseius triumphans&quot;, and &quot;Wolseius moriens&quot;; these contain respectively 101, 89, and 51 seven-line stanzas of decasyllabic verse (rhyming , as in rhyme royal). The volume is dedicated to John Howson, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s chaplain, and there are introductory verses by Charles Fitzgeffrey and Thomas and Edward Michelborne, and a poem in fifteen eight-line stanzas addressed to the author by his fellow-collegian John Sprint. The poem is based on the narratives of George Cavendish (&quot;Life of Woolsey&quot;) and Raphael Holinshed, and contains a felicitous characterisation of Richard Foxe. It was praised by Alberic Gentilis in his &quot;Laudes Academiæ Perusinæ et Oxoniensis&quot; (1605). The &quot;Life&quot; was reprinted in Thomas Park&#x27;s &quot;Heliconia&quot; (1815, vol. ii.), and reissued separately in 1826 from the press of David Alphonso Talboys at Oxford. This poem was brought up as a possible influence on Shakespeare&#x27;s composition of the play &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, from the end of the 18th century onwards.

In &quot;England&#x27;s Parnassus&quot; (1600) are about 20 poems by Storer; they are derived from the &quot;Life of Wolsey&quot;, and display an elaborate style of metaphor. Some verses by Storer are prefixed to Sir William Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;Golden Grove&quot; (1600).

<doc id="1106241" wikidata="Q4347855" url="?curid=1106241" title="1986 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1986 United States Senate elections were elections for the United States Senate. Held on November 4, in the middle of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s second presidential term, the 34 seats of Class 3 were contested in regular elections. The Republicans had to defend an unusually large number of freshman Senate incumbents who had been elected on President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s coattails in 1980. Democrats won a net of eight seats, defeating seven freshman incumbents, picking up two Republican-held open seats, and regaining control of the Senate for the first time since January 1981. This remains the most recent midterm election cycle in which the sitting president&#x27;s party suffered net losses while still flipping a Senate seat.

Democrats gained a net eight seats, and recaptured control of the Senate from the Republicans with a 55–45 majority. They defeated seven incumbents, all but one of whom had been elected in 1980, and gained open seats held by retiring Republicans in Maryland and Nevada. Republicans gained one open seat in Missouri. Bob Dole (R-Kansas) and Robert Byrd (D-West Virginia) exchanged positions as the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader. However, the Democratic majority would be reduced to 54-46 following the March 1987 death of Democrat Edward Zorinsky, who was then replaced with a Republican.

This was the last election cycle — until 2016 — in which the Democrats in this class of senators amassed a gain in seats (not including special elections held in off-years in some states to fill the seats that had been vacated by senators due to death, resignation, or otherwise).

All of the elections involved the Class 3 seats.

== Closest races ==

In sixteen races the margin of victory was under 10%.

== Alabama ==

Incumbent Republican Jeremiah Denton ran for a second term but lost to Democrat Richard Shelby.

Shelby, a moderate-to-conservative Democrat avoided a primary runoff and won nomination in the Democratic Party primary over Jim Allen Jr., son of former senator James Allen.




Incumbent Senator Jeremiah Denton, a retired Rear Admiral and decorated Vietnam War veteran who six years earlier became the first Republican elected to the Senate from Alabama since Reconstruction, won the Republican primary with little opposition from Richard Vickers.



Shelby won a very narrow victory over Denton (less than one percent), once again making Alabama&#x27;s Senate delegation entirely Democratic.



== Alaska ==

Incumbent Republican Frank Murkowski ran for a second term and was primarily opposed by Democrat and Alaska Pacific University President Glenn Olds and Libertarian Chuck House, field representative for Eastman Kodak Company. Following a highly competitive election in 1980, Murkowski faced a legitimate opponent in Olds, and the contest was fairly close throughout the campaign. However, in the end, Murkowski was able to defeat Olds 63%-25% in the open primary. He won 54%-44% against Olds in the runoff.







== Arizona ==

Incumbent Republican Barry Goldwater decided to retire instead of seeking a sixth term. The open seat was won by Republican John McCain, a Congressman and former Navy Officer who beat Democratic State Legislator Richard Kimball. Both candidates were unopposed in their respective primaries.

Kimball&#x27;s campaign was subject to negative press from the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot; and &quot;Phoenix Gazette&quot;. One Gazette columnist described him as displaying &quot;terminal weirdness.&quot; McCain ultimately won the election by a margin of 20%, and he would go on to win six more terms to the U.S. Senate.




== Arkansas ==

Incumbent Democrat Dale Bumpers won re-election to a third term over Republican U.S. Attorney Asa Hutchinson. Both ran unopposed in their respective primaries.




== California ==

Incumbent Democratic Alan Cranston won re-nomination over nominal Democratic opposition. Congressman Ed Zschau narrowly defeated Bruce Herschensohn in the Republican primary to secure the nomination. Cranston narrowly won re-election to a fourth term over Zschau, 49%-48%.




== Colorado ==

Incumbent Democrat Gary Hart retired instead of seeking a third term. Democratic nominee Tim Wirth and Republican Ken Kramer ran unopposed for the seat. In an ultimately very close election, Wirth defeated Kramer by just under 2%. Wirth would retire and opt not to seek a second term.




== Connecticut ==

Incumbent Democrat Chris Dodd received the Democratic nomination with no opposition. Republican Roger Eddy of the Republican National Committee won the Republican nomination. Dodd handily defeated Eddy, 65%-35%.




== Florida ==

Incumbent Republican Paula Hawkins won renomination with nominal opposition, but so did her Democratic opponent, popular Governor of Florida Bob Graham. Graham defeated Hawkins by nearly 9% on election day.








== Georgia ==

Incumbent Republican Mack Mattingly decided to run for re-election and lost a close race to Democratic U.S. Congressman Wyche Fowler, who had defeated former White House Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan in the Democratic primary. Fowler would lose re-election in 1992. 



== Hawaii ==

Incumbent Democratic Daniel Inouye won re-election to a fifth term, 74%-26%, over Republican Frank Hutchinson, who had defeated Marvin Franklin in the Republican primary.



== Idaho ==

Incumbent Republican Steve Symms won re-election to a second term over Democratic Governor John V. Evans. Evans was a popular governor, and the race was ultimately close, but Symms prevailed by just over 2%.



== Illinois ==

The incumbent Democratic Alan J. Dixon won re-election to a second term over Republican State Representative Judy Koehler, who won the Republican nomination over George Ranney. This was also the last time until 2022 that a winning Senate Candidate was elected to this seat twice.

Dixon easily won the senate race. Koehler fared poorly throughout most parts of the state, only winning 10 of the states 102 counties.





== Indiana ==

Incumbent Republican Dan Quayle won re-election to a second term over Democratic Valparaiso City Councilwoman Jill L. Long.





== Iowa ==

Incumbent Republican Chuck Grassley ran for re-election to a second term, which he won easily over Democratic nominee John P. Roehrick, an attorney.








== Kansas ==

Incumbent Republican Bob Dole ran for re-election to a fourth term, which he won easily over Democratic nominee Guy MacDonald, a school teacher, who had narrowly prevailed in a crowded field of Democratic candidates.



== Kentucky ==


Democrat Wendell Ford won re-election, He defeated Republican Jackson Andrews, who emerged from a competitive primary.



== Louisiana ==

Incumbent Democratic Russell B. Long decided to retire instead of seeking an eighth term. The open seat was won by Democrat U.S. Representative John Breaux, who beat Republican U.S. Representative Henson Moore by just over 5% after the two finished second and first in the open primary, respectively.



== Maryland ==

Incumbent Republican Charles Mathias decided to retire, instead of seeking a fourth term. At the time of this announcement, it was expected that then-Governor Harry Hughes would run for the seat being vacated by retiring Senator Mathias. However, Hughes became caught up in the aftermath of the Maryland savings and loan crisis. He lost popularity with voters, opening the door for Mikulski&#x27;s bid for the Senate. Congresswoman Barbara Mikulski received the Democratic nomination over fellow Congressman Michael D. Barnes and governor Harry Hughes, the last of whom finished third. Mikulski had previously run for the seat in 1974.

Chavez won the primary handily, defeating several Republican challengers. Later, she made comments that some Mikulski supporters interpreted as an attempt to draw attention to the issue of Mikulski&#x27;s sexual orientation. In an article quoting Chavez&#x27;s claim that Mikulski was a &quot;San Francisco-style, George McGovern, liberal Democrat&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Chavez was directly implying that the never-married Mikulski was a lesbian. Chavez was accused of making Mikulski&#x27;s sexual orientation a central issue of the political campaign. In defending her use of the phrase, Chavez stated the line &quot;San Francisco Democrats&quot; was a reference to Jeane Kirkpatrick&#x27;s 1984 Republican National Convention &quot;Blame America First&quot; speech, in which Kirkpatrick coined the phrase &quot;San Francisco Liberal.&quot;. The phrase &quot;San Francisco liberal&quot; was common at the time.

Mikulski eventually won the race with 61 percent of the vote. She was the first female Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in her own right (not appointed or filling a seat of a deceased husband). No Republican since Mathias has represented Maryland in the U.S. Senate.













== Missouri ==

Incumbent Democrat Tom Eagleton decided to retire instead of seeking a fourth term. Republican Governor Kit Bond won the open seat, beating Democratic Lieutenant Governor Harriett Woods.



== Nevada ==

Incumbent Republican Paul Laxalt decided to retire instead of seeking a third term. U.S. Representative Democratic nominee Harry Reid won the open seat over Republican former U.S. Representative James David Santini. Reid had previously run for the seat in 1974.





== New Hampshire ==


Incumbent Republican Warren Rudman won re-election to a second term, beating the Democratic former Governor of Massachusetts Endicott Peabody.




== New York ==

Incumbent Republican Al D&#x27;Amato won re-election to a second term over Democrat Mark Green, the Chief Speechwriter for U.S. Senator Gary Hart and former congressional candidate. Green had won a contested primary over the more moderate John S. Dyson. D&#x27;Amato won most counties in the state, losing just 5 counties. This was D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s largest margin of victory during his Senate career.






== North Carolina ==
There were two elections in North Carolina.

Incumbent Republican Jim Broyhill, who had been appointed in June 1986 to serve out the rest of John Porter East&#x27;s term, faced off against the popular Democratic former Governor Terry Sanford. There were two separate elections held on the same day: a special election for what little remained of the 99th United States Congress (November 1986 – January 1987) and a regular election for a new six-year term (beginning in January 1987). Sanford won both elections.

The primary elections would nominate candidates to the special and the regular election.

=== North Carolina (regular) ===
Terry Sanford, then the outgoing president of Duke University, first said in September 1985 that he was planning to run for the U.S. Senate the next year but quickly withdrew, as it appeared that the party wanted a &quot;fresh&quot; face, most likely in the person of UNC System President William Friday. Then, Friday declined to run, as did other well-known politicians like former Gov. Jim Hunt. Former North Carolina Secretary of Commerce Lauch Faircloth then made it known that he would run, but he was considered too conservative by many party leaders, who encouraged Sanford to enter the race in order to defeat Faircloth. Sanford agreed to run, which led Faircloth and another candidate, Judge Marvin K. Blount Jr., to withdraw before filing their candidacies. Six years later, Faircloth did run for the Senate against Sanford, but this time as a Republican.

Sen. East declined to run for a second term, citing his health. Longtime U.S. Representative Jim Broyhill entered the race with much of the establishment support, but David Funderburk had the backing of the organization of Senator Jesse Helms. Funderburk charged Broyhill with being insufficiently conservative, but in the end, Broyhill won the nomination handily in the May primary. The next month, Sen. East committed suicide, and Gov. James G. Martin appointed Broyhill to his seat.

Sanford narrowly defeated incumbent Broyhill on both election ballots, though he received a slightly smaller margin of victory to finish the remainder of East&#x27;s term due to a lower turnout.









=== North Carolina (special)===
This was a special election for what little remained of the 99th United States Congress (November 1986 – January 1987), being held contemporaneously with a regular election for a new six-year term (beginning in January 1987).



== North Dakota ==

Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Mark Andrews lost re-election to a second term to Dem-NPL nominee Kent Conrad, State Tax Commissioner. Andrews lost re-election by just over 2,000 votes after a rigorous campaign involving personal attacks.




== Ohio ==


Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator John Glenn won re-election to a third term over Republican U.S. Congressman Tom Kindness.





== Oklahoma ==


Incumbent Republican Don Nickles won re-election to his second term, over Democratic U.S. Congressman James R. Jones, who defeated James Gentry in the primary.



== Oregon ==

Incumbent Bob Packwood ran for re-election, though he faced a significant primary challenge from Joe Lutz. U.S. Congressman Jim Weaver received the Democratic nomination. A populist Democratic congressman from Eugene, Oregon, he was a darling of the environmentalists. Weaver supported the Oregon Wilderness Act of 1984. Packwood was confident despite the popular opponent, because had more money and a better campaign organization. After winning the party nomination, Weaver was the subject of a House Ethics Committee probe into his campaign finances, and withdrew his candidacy. Rick Bauman was selected to replace Weaver on the ballot, and lost handily to Packwood.








== Pennsylvania ==


Incumbent Republican Arlen Specter, who had been elected in 1980, ran for re-election and faced Democrat Robert W. Edgar in the general election.

Specter was viewed somewhat tepidly by the Pennsylvania electorate entering the race, although both men shared similar moderate profiles. Additionally, economic woes had dragged down the popularity of Republican candidates in the industrial states. Don Bailey, the state&#x27;s incumbent Auditor General, who projected a strong blue collar image and had moderate positions that were often relatively close to Specter&#x27;s, and Edgar, a Methodist minister and sitting Congressman, who had more liberal viewpoints and was with the Vietnam War-era peace movement and anti-corruption movement following the Watergate scandals, ran for the Democratic nomination. However, issues played a very minor role in the primary, which instead showcased the state&#x27;s geographical divide, with Delaware County-based Edgar narrowly defeating Westmoreland County-based Bailey.

Specter defeated Edgar in the general election by nearly 13% of the vote.




== South Carolina ==

Popular incumbent Democratic Senator Fritz Hollings easily defeated Republican U.S. Attorney and future Governor Henry McMaster, who defeated Henry Jordan for the Republican nomination, to win his fifth (his fourth full) term.


The race was not seriously contested and was not a target by the Republicans. With little financial assistance, McMaster was unable to mount a credible challenge to Hollings&#x27;s re-election in what became a difficult year for Republicans.




== South Dakota ==

Incumbent Republican James Abdnor ran for re-election to a second term, but was defeated by Democratic Congressman Tom Daschle.

Daschle was uncontested for the Democratic nomination and therefore was able to focus on the general election early, while Abdnor had to fight a challenge from an incumbent governor, Bill Janklow.





== Utah ==


Republican Jake Garn, originally elected in 1974, ran for re-election to a third term. He faced nominal opposition from Democrat Craig S. Oliver in the general election, defeating him 72%-27%.




== Vermont ==

Incumbent Democrat Patrick Leahy won re-election to a third term over Republican former Governor of Vermont Richard A. Snelling and Liberty Unionist sociologist and perennial candidate Jerry Levy. The race was initially expected to be competitive, with Ronald Reagan encouraging Snelling to run.

Both Leahy and Snelling were well-respected and highly popular in Vermont, and the general feeling was that they would both make good senators. However, Snelling was felt to be at a disadvantage for several reasons, including the fact that his main campaign plank was deficit reduction, which &quot;The Caledonian-Record&quot; noted Leahy was already a well-known advocate for, and the fact that Leahy had acquired a reputation as one of the Senate&#x27;s most knowledgeable figures on the issue of nuclear proliferation, an issue which the &quot;Brattleboro Reformer&quot; noted that Snelling had no experience with.

Nonetheless, Leahy defeated Snelling in a 63%-35% landslide. Leahy would face one more tough re-election challenge in 1992 against Republican Jim Douglas, handily winning each term thereafter.










== Washington ==

Incumbent Republican Senator Slade Gorton lost re-election to former Transportation Secretary Brock Adams. Gorton later won Washington&#x27;s other Senate seat in 1988 and 1994 before losing re-election again in 2000. 



== Wisconsin ==


Incumbent Republican Bob Kasten ran unopposed in the Republican primary. Ed Garvey, former Deputy Attorney General of Wisconsin and executive director of the NFLPA, defeated Matt Flynn in the Democratic primary. Kasten defeated Garvey in the general election by just over 3%.

<doc id="1106243" wikidata="Q13554485" url="?curid=1106243" title="Henry Lascelles, 2nd Earl of Harewood">
<text>Henry Lascelles, 2nd Earl of Harewood DL (25 December 1767 – 24 November 1841), known as Viscount Lascelles from 1814 to 1820, was a British peer, Tory politician, planter and art collector.

==Early life and politics==
Harewood was the second son of Edward Lascelles, 1st Earl of Harewood, and Anne Chaloner. He was elected to the House of Commons for Yorkshire in 1796, a seat he held until 1806, when he chose not to force a very expensive contested election. He tried and failed to regain it in the 1807 Yorkshire election. Then held it again from 1812 to 1818, and also represented Westbury from 1807 to 1812 and Northallerton from 1818 to 1820. The latter year he succeeded his father in the earldom and entered the House of Lords. Between 1819 and 1841 he also served as Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire.

According to the &quot;Legacies of British Slave-Ownership&quot; at University College London, Harewood was awarded remuneration as a former slave trader in the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 via the Slave Compensation Act 1837. The British Government took out a £15 million loan (worth £ in 2025) with interest from Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Moses Montefiore, which was subsequently paid off by British taxpayers (ending in 2015). Harewood was associated with six different claims; he enslaved roughly 1,277 people in Barbados and Jamaica and received a payment of £26,307 at the time (worth £ in 2025).

==Marriage and issue==
Lord Harewood married Henrietta Sebright (d. 15 February 1840), daughter of Sir John Sebright, 6th Baronet, on 3 September 1794. They had eleven children:

*Edward Lascelles, Viscount Lascelles (18 Jul 1796 – 7 Dec 1839), married (1) Ann Elizabeth Rosser, (2) Philippine Munster and died without issue.
*Henry Lascelles, 3rd Earl of Harewood (11 Jun 1797 – 22 Feb 1857)
*William Saunders Sebright Lascelles (29 Oct 1798 – 2 Jul 1851)
*Edwin Lascelles (1799 – 25 Apr 1865), died unmarried.
*Francis Lascelles (12 Feb 1801 – 2 Feb 1814)
*Lady Harriet Lascelles (19 Jun 1802 – 1 Jan 1889), married George Holroyd, 2nd Earl of Sheffield, and had issue.
*Frederick Lascelles (1803 – 13 Oct 1823)
*Lady Frances Anne Lascelles ( 2 Jun 1804 – 7 Dec 1855), married John Thomas Hope, son of General Sir Alexander Hope and had issue.
*Arthur Lascelles (23 Jan 1807 – 19 Jul 1880), married Caroline Frances Brooke, daughter of Richard Brooke, 6th Baronet and had issue.
*Lady Emma Lascelles (16 Mar 1809 – 8 Feb 1865), married Edward Portman, 1st Viscount Portman and had issue.
*Lady Louisa Lascelles (10 Sep 1812 – 10 Mar 1886), married Lord George Henry Cavendish, younger brother of William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire, and had issue.

His wife is mentioned in Mansfield Park, by Jane Austen, in a letter from Mary Crawford to Fanny Price while Fanny is staying with her mother and father in Portsmouth: &quot;I was there, two years ago, when Lady Lascelles had it, and I prefer it over any other house in London.&quot; (She is talking about a house in Wimpole Street.)

<text>The Clan of the Cave Bear is a 1980 novel and epic work of prehistoric fiction by Jean M. Auel about prehistoric times. It is the first book in the &quot;Earth&#x27;s Children&quot; book series, which speculates on the possibilities of interactions between Neanderthal and modern Cro-Magnon humans.

==Setting==
The novel references the advance of the polar ice sheets, setting the story 18,000 years BCE, when the farthest southern encroachment of the last glacial period of the current ice age occurred. Auel&#x27;s time-frame, sometime between 28,000 and 25,000 BCE, corresponds generally with archaeological estimates of the Neanderthal branch of humankind disappearing.

== Plots ==

A five-year-old girl, Ayla, who readers come to understand is Cro-Magnon, is orphaned and left homeless by an earthquake that destroys her family&#x27;s camp. She wanders naked and unable to feed herself, for several days. She is attacked and nearly killed by a cave lion, and, suffering from starvation, exhaustion, and infection of her wounds, she collapses, on the verge of death.

The narrative switches to a group of people who call themselves &quot;Clan&quot; and who the reader comes to understand are Neanderthal. Their cave was destroyed in the earthquake, and they are searching for a new home. The medicine woman of the group, Iza, discovers Ayla and asks permission from her brother Brun, the Clan leader, to help her, despite the child being clearly a member of &quot;the Others,&quot; the distrusted antagonists of the Clan. The child is adopted by Iza and her eldest brother Creb. Creb is the group&#x27;s &quot;Mog-ur&quot; or shaman, despite being deformed as a result of a difficult birth caused by his abnormally large head, and the later loss of an arm and eye after being attacked by a cave bear. The Clan worships spiritual representations of Earthly animals, called totems, that they believe can influence their lives by sending good or bad luck, and for whom Mog-ur acts as an intermediary. Brun allows Iza to treat the dying child and agrees to adopt her providing Creb can discover her personal totem spirit.

Through meditation, Creb comes to believe that the child may be protected by the spirit of the cave lion, a powerful totem never given to a woman and only to very few men. He cites the cave lion attack the girl experienced shortly before being discovered as proof that its spirit marked her so that she could be adopted into the Clan. The girl travels with them for a while and starts to heal. When the group stops to discuss what they should do since they have not found a new home, Ayla wanders and discovers a huge, beautiful cave, perfect for their needs. Many of the people begin to regard Ayla as lucky, especially since good fortune continues to come their way as she lives among them.

In Auel&#x27;s books, Neanderthals possess only limited vocal apparatus and rarely speak, but have a highly developed sign language. They do not laugh or even smile, and they do not cry; when Ayla weeps, Iza thinks she has an eye disease. They also mature very early - to the point a person in their 20s and 30s is considered old and they become pubescent at around 7-9 years old with few maturing at 10 years old. Very soon after, they are given a mate and have children. Iza was considered to have a geriatic pregnancy when she was nearly twenty and had stumbled upon Ayla.

Ayla&#x27;s different thought processes lead her to break important Clan customs, particularly the taboo against females handling weapons. She is self-willed and spirited, but she tries to fit in with the Neanderthals, although she has to learn everything first-hand; she does not possess the ancestral memories of the Clan that enable them to do certain tasks after being shown only once.

Iza is concerned that when Ayla grows up, nobody will want her as their mate as she is very ugly to the Neaderthal, making her a burden to the group. She therefore trains Ayla as a medicine woman of her line, the most prestigious line of medicine women of the entire Clan. This will give Ayla her own status, independent of whether or not she is mated. It takes Iza much longer to train Ayla than it will her own daughter, Uba, since Ayla does not possess the memories of the Clan. 

Ayla&#x27;s main antagonist in the novel is Broud, son of the leader Brun, who feels that she takes credit and attention away from him. As the two mature, the hatred in Broud&#x27;s heart festers. When they are young adults, he brutally rapes Ayla in a bid to demonstrate his total control over her, and he continues to sexually assault her multiple times a day. She sinks into depression that leaves her despondent and uninterested, and she becomes pregnant soon after at the age of ~11 years old. Iza explains to Ayla that her unattractive appearance compared to a Clan woman will likely preclude her from obtaining a mate before she gives birth — a circumstance Iza&#x27;s people believe will bring the group bad luck. Having dreamed of being a mother for most of her life and convinced that this may be her only chance due to her powerful totem, Ayla refuses Iza&#x27;s suggestion that she take medicine to abort the child. Following a difficult pregnancy and a near-fatal labor, Ayla rejoices in the birth of her son Durc, but because he has a number of Cro-Magnon features, he is classified by the Clan as deformed and is almost taken away from her, but after much pleading and convincing, Ayla is allowed to stay in the Clan and keep her son Durc.

Iza becomes extremely unwell due to her chronic illness and at her deathbed, she was just past twenty-six with white hair, gaunt frame and wrinkled skin.

The book ends with Broud&#x27;s succession of Brun to leadership and Goov&#x27;s succession of Creb as mog-ur. Broud orders Goov to place an immediate death-curse on Ayla. Another earthquake then happens, killing Creb. Ayla sets off to find other people of her own kind. Durc remains with the tribe under the protection of Brun who admonishes Broud and regrets his decision to make him leader.

==Sequels==
The sequel, &quot;The Valley of Horses&quot;, continues Ayla&#x27;s story, which is further developed in the four other books of the Earth&#x27;s Children series: &quot;The Mammoth Hunters&quot;, &quot;The Plains of Passage&quot;, &quot;The Shelters of Stone&quot;, and &quot;The Land of Painted Caves&quot;.

==Background==
The archaeological and paleontological research for this book was carried out by Auel from her public library, by attending archaeological conventions, and touring extensively on sites with briefings by working field archaeologists. Some of the descriptions are based on the first adult Neanderthal skeletons found in Iraq from the cave burial at Shanidar, dating between 60–80,000 years BP. Other data is clearly linked to the widespread Aurignacian culture and Gravettian culture, and their tell-tale Venus figurines, which Auel uses as one center of her Cro-Magnon religious practices.

==Film and television adaptations==
In 1986, the novel was adapted into a film directed by Michael Chapman and starring Daryl Hannah.

In 2014, the Lifetime television network ordered a pilot episode, based on the series of novels. Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, Jean M. Auel, and Linda Woolverton are executive producers, with Woolverton writing the teleplay. The launch was slated for some time in 2015.

Despite reports of plans to shoot a pilot for a series to have started in 2016, with Ireland as one location, this plan was canceled by Lifetime and has been shopped around to various networks with no luck. It is presumed to be dead, as of March 2016.

<doc id="1106253" wikidata="Q3534634" url="?curid=1106253" title="Tirumurai">
<text>Tirumurai (Tamil: திருமுறை, meaning Holy Order) is a twelve-volume compendium of songs or hymns in praise of Shiva in the Tamil language from the 6th to the 11th century CE by various poets in Tamil Nadu. Nambiyandar Nambi compiled the first seven volumes by Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar as &quot;Tevaram&quot; during the 12th century. During the course of time, a strong necessity was felt by scholars to compile Shaiva literature to accommodate other works. &quot;Tiruvasakam&quot; and &quot;Tirukovayar&quot; by Manickavasagar are included as the eighth, nine parts are compiled as the ninth &quot;Tirumurai&quot; out of which most are unknown, and the tenth as &quot;Tirumandiram&quot; by Tirumular, the famous &quot;Siddhar&quot;. The eleventh is compiled by Karaikal Ammaiyar, Cheraman Perumal and others. The contemporary Chola king was impressed by the work of Nambi and included Nambi&#x27;s work in the eleventh &quot;Tirumurai&quot;. Sekkilar&#x27;s &quot;Periya Puranam&quot;, composed a century later, contains the life depiction of all the 63 &quot;Nayanmars&quot;. The response for the work was so tremendous among Shaiva scholars and Kulothunga Chola II that it was included as the 12th &quot;Tirumurai&quot;. &quot;Tirumurai&quot; along with &quot;Vedas&quot; and &quot;Shaiva agamas&quot; form the basis of &quot;Shaiva Siddantha&quot; philosophy in South India and Sri Lanka.

==History and background==
The Pallava period in the history of the Tamil land is a period of religious revival of Shaivism by the Shaivite Nayanars who by their Bhakti hymns captured the hearts of the people. They made a tremendous impression on the people by singing the praise of Shiva in soul-stirring devotional hymns. &quot;Tirumurai&quot; in anthology supersedes Sangam literature, which is predominantly secular in nature. The entire &quot;Tirumurai&quot; is in &quot;viruttam&quot; meter or lines of four. The principal characteristics of the head-rhyming is influenced both by syllabic and moric prosody.

==Poets==
==Hymns==

The Shaiva Tirumurais are twelve in number. The first seven Tirumurais are the hymns of the three great Shaivite saints, Sambandar, Appar and Sundarar. These hymns were the best musical compositions of their age.

The first three &quot;Tirumurais&quot; (meaning parts) of &quot;Tevaram&quot; are composed by Sambanthar, the next three by Appar and the seventh one is composed by Sundarar. Appar and Sambanthar lived around the 7th century, while &quot;Sundarar&quot; lived in the 8th century. During the Pallava period these three travelled extensively around Tamil Nadu offering discourses and songs characterised by an emotional devotion to Shiva. Their hymns include allegations against Jain monks and criticism of Jainism.

Sambanthar was a 7th-century child poet-saint who died at the age of 16 in 655 CE. His verses were set to tune by Nilakantaperumalanar who is set to have accompanied the poet on his &quot;yal&quot; or lute. The first three volumes of Tirumurai contain 383 hymns. Appar (alias Tirunavukkarasar) was born in the middle of the 7th century in Tiruvamur, Tamil Nadu, and lived about 81 years. He converted to Jainism as a youth, became the head of a Jain monastery over time, but then returned to Shaivism. Tirumurai contains 313 hymns of Appar over volumes 4-7. His hymns are highly devotional, with some containing criticism of Jainism as he experienced it. Sundarar (alias Sundaramurthi) was born towards the end of the 7th century. He is the author of 100 hymns compiled as the 7th &quot;Tirumurai&quot;.
Manikkavasagar&#x27;s &quot;Tiruvasakam&quot; and &quot;Tirukovayar&quot; are compiled as the eighth &quot;Tirumurai&quot; and is full of visionary experience, divine love and urgent striving for truth. Manickavasagar was the Pandya King Varaguna II&#x27;s prime minister and renounced his post in search of divinity.

The ninth Tirumurai has been composed by Tirumalikaittever, Sundarar, Karuvurttevar, Nambiyaandar Nambi, Gandaraditya, Venattatikal, Tiruvaliyamutanar, Purutottama Nambi and Cetirayar. Among these the notable is Gandaraditya (950-957 CE), a Chola king who later became a Saivite saint.

&quot;Tirumandiram&quot; by Tirumular unfolds &quot;siddantha&quot; (attainment) as a fourfold path - virtuous and moral living, temple worship, internal worship and union with Siva. Tirumular worked out an original philosophical system, and the southern school of Saiva siddantha draws its authority from &quot;Tirumandiram&quot;, a work of 3000 verses. &quot;Tirumandiram&quot; represents another school of thought detailing &quot;agamic&quot; traditions, which run parallel to the &quot;bhakthi&quot; movement. It does not glorify temples or deities as in the case of other &quot;Tirumurais&quot;.

The eleventh Tirumurai was composed by Karaikkal Ammaiyar, Cheraman Perumal, Pattinattu p-pillaiyar, Nakkiratevar, Kapilateva, Tiruvalavaiyudaiyar, Nampiyantarnampi, Iyyadigal katavarkon, Kalladateva, Paranateva, Ellamperuman Adigal and Athirava Adigal. Nambi&#x27;s &quot;Tirutottanar Tiruvanthathi&quot; followed an exclusive style of mincing Tamil and Sanskrit verses in &quot;anthati&quot; meter similar to &quot;Tevaram&quot; of the trio. Karaikkal Ammaiyar (550-600 CE) is the earliest of the woman Saivite poets who introduced the &quot;kattalai-k-kali-t-turai&quot; meter, which is a complicated structural departure from the old classical Tamil meters. The other meter used by Ammaiyar was an old &quot;venba&quot; and also an &quot;antathi&quot; arrangement in which the offset of one line or stanza is identical with the onset of the next line or stanza.

&quot;Periya Puranam&quot; (Tamil:பெரிய‌ புராண‌ம்), the &quot;great purana&quot; or epic, sometimes also called &quot;Tiruttontarpuranam&quot; (read as &quot;Tiru-Thondar-Puranam&quot;) (the purana of the holy devotees) is a Tamil poetic mythistory depicting the legendary lives of the sixty-three Nayanars, the canonical poets of Tamil Shaivism. It was compiled during the 12th century by Sekkizhar. It provides evidence of trade with West Asia. Sekkizhar compiled and wrote the &quot;Periya Puranam&quot; listing the life stories of the sixty-three Shaiva Nayanars, poets of the God Shiva who composed the liturgical poems of the Tirumurai, and was later himself canonised and the work became part of the sacred canon. Sekkizhar was a poet and the chief minister in the court of the Chola King, Kulothunga Chola II.

==Compilation==
Raja Raja Chola I (985-1013 CE) embarked on a mission to recover the hymns after hearing short excerpts of &quot;Tevaram&quot; in his court. He sought the help of Nambi Andar Nambi, who was a priest in a temple. It is believed that by divine intervention Nambi found the presence of scripts, in the form of cadijam leaves half eaten by white ants in a chamber inside the second precinct in Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram. The &quot;brahmanas&quot; (Dikshitars) in the temple informed the king about the tradition that only when all three poets come together, that the chamber can be opened, and Rajaraja found a worakaround by consecrating the images of the saint-poets through the streets of Chidambaram. Rajaraja thus became known as &quot;Tirumurai Kanda Cholan&quot; meaning one who (re)discovered the &quot;Tirumurai&quot;. Thus far Shiva temples only had images of god forms, but after the advent of Rajaraja, the images of the Nayanar saints were also placed inside the temple. Nambi arranged the hymns of three saint poets Sampantar, Appar and Sundarar as the first seven books, Manickavasagar&#x27;s &quot;Tirukovayar&quot; and &quot;Tiruvacakam&quot; as the 8th book, the 28 hymns of nine other saints as the 9th book, the &quot;Tirumandiram&quot; of Tirumular as the 10th book, 40 hymns by 12 other poets as the 10th book, &quot;Tirutotanar Tiruvanthathi&quot; - the sacred &quot;anthathi&quot; of the labours of the 63 Nayanar saints, and added his own hymns as the 11th book. The first seven books were later called &quot;Tevaram&quot;, and the whole Saiva canon, to which was added, as the 12th book, Sekkizhar&#x27;s &quot;Periya Puranam&quot; (1135 CE) is wholly known as &quot;Tirumurai&quot;, the holy book. Thus Saiva literature which covers about 600 years of religious, philosophical and literary development.

==Temples revered==
&quot;Paadal Petra Sthalams&quot; are 276 temples that are revered in the verses of &quot;Tevaram&quot; and are amongst the greatest Shiva temples of the continent. &quot;Vaippu Sthalangal&quot; are places that were mentioned casually in the songs in Tevaram. The focus of the &quot;moovars&quot;″ (first three poets) hymns suggests &quot;darshan&quot; (seeing and being seen by God) within the &quot;puja&quot; (worship) offering. The hymnists made classificatory lists of places like &quot;katu&quot; (for forest), &quot;turai&quot; (port or refuge), &quot;kulam&quot; (water tank) and &quot;kalam&quot; (field) being used - thus both structured and unstructured places in the religious context find a mention in &quot;Tevaram&quot;. The temples mentioned in the works of the 9th &quot;Tirumarai&quot;, &quot;Thiruvisaippa&quot;, are in turn referred to as &quot;Tiruvisaipa Thalangal&quot;. The shrine of Gangaikonda Cholapuram are revered as under
&quot; He of the Shrine of Gangaikonda Choleswaram takes whatever forms that his worship visualize&quot; - 131,5.

==In culture==
&quot;Tirumurai&quot; was one of the reasons for converting Vedic ritual to &quot;Agamic puja&quot; followed in Shiva temples. Though these two systems are overlapping, &quot;Agamic&quot; tradition ensures the perpetuation of the Vedic religion&#x27;s emphasis on the efficacy of ritual as per Davis. &quot;Odhuvars&quot;, &quot;Sthanikars&quot;, or &quot;Kattalaiyars&quot; offer musical programmes in Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu by singing &quot;Tevaram&quot; after the daily rituals. These are usually carried out as a chorus programme soon after the divine offering. There are records from Kulothunga Chola III from Nallanyanar temple in South Arcot indicating singing of &quot;Tiruvempavai&quot; and &quot;Tiruvalam&quot; of Manickavasagar during special occasions in the temple. From the 13th century, the texts were passed on to the Odhuvars by the &quot;Adheenams&quot; or &quot;mathas&quot; and there was no more control by the kings or the &quot;brahmanas&quot;. The &quot;Odhuvars&quot; were from the &quot;vellala&quot; community and were trained in ritual singing in &quot;Tevaram&quot; schools.

&quot;Periya Puranam&quot;, the eleventh-century Tamil book on the Nayanars that forms the last volume of the &quot;Tirumurai&quot;, primarily had references only to &quot;Tevaram&quot; and subsequently expanded to 12 parts and is one of the first anthologies of &quot;Tirumurai&quot;. One of the first anthologies of &quot;moovars&quot;″ hymns called the &quot;Tevara Arulmuraitirattu&quot; is linked to Tamil Saiva siddhantha philosophy by grouping ninety-nine verses into 10 categories. The category headings are God, soul, bond, grace, guru, methodology, enlightenment, bliss, mantra and liberation - corresponding to Umapthi&#x27;s work, &quot;Tiruvarutpayan&quot;. &quot;Tirumurai kanda puranam&quot; is another anthology for &quot;Tirumurai&quot; as a whole, but primarily focuses on &quot;Tevaram&quot;. It is the first of the works to refer the collection of volumes as &quot;Tirumurai&quot;.

<text>Yusuf Dia Pasha al-Khalidi (1842–1906; , ) was a prominent Ottoman politician who served as mayor of Jerusalem during several non-consecutive terms in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Al Khalidi served as mayor of Jerusalem from the years 1870 to 1876, 1878 to 1879, and 1899 to 1906.

He was an elected member of the first Ottoman parliament, and he represented Jerusalem. He was also a governor, translator, professor and prolific writer. As an Ottoman patriot and an active participant in the reform of the system following Egyptian withdrawal from Syria, Khalidi was proud of his Jerusalem heritage, and was a relentless reformer of the Ottoman system from within, rather than a precursor of Arab, or Syrian independence from the Ottomans. He continuously referred to his homeland (watani) as Jerusalem 

==Early life and education==
Al-Khalidi was born in Jerusalem, Ottoman Palestine in 1842. His father, al-Sayyid Muhammad Ali al-Khalidi, served as deputy qadi and chief of the Jerusalem Sharia court secretariat in Jerusalem, Ottoman Empire for about fifty years. Members of the Khalidi family, one of the politically prominent old families of the local nobility (the others being the al-Husayni family and the Nashashibi family), continuously held the office through the 18th and 19th centuries. Although the Husayni family was larger and wealthier, the Khalidis were more united and noted for their intellect.

As a teenager, al-Khalidi may have been influenced by the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856. At the age of 17, he wrote of his thoughts about the state of the world, personal dignity and the individual&#x27;s quest to become free, in the context of meditations on why the Ottoman Empire was being increasingly surrounded by European powers pilfering the region of its wealth and identified the cause of the situation to be the disparity in knowledge between the region and Europe. The interests of the country could only be defended by dropping frivolous studies and acquiring scientific, historical and philosophical knowledge.

Yousef&#x27;s initial requests to receive an education in Egypt was turned down because he lacked an invitation from that country and his father rebuffed his proposal that he be educated in Europe. Afterward he and his cousin Husayn left Jerusalem without the family&#x27;s permission and reached Malta where they were enrolled into the Protestant college through the mediation of the Anglican bishop Gobat of Jerusalem. There, he studied English and French. Yousef&#x27;s brother Yasin persuaded him after two years in the Protestant college to attend the Imperial Medical School in Constantinople, capital of the Empire. Yousef was dissatisfied with his time at the medical school after a year, finding no &quot;salvation, he enrolled in an American Protestant missionary school outside of the capital, Robert College.&quot; He remained there for a year and a half before returning to Jerusalem because of the death of his father.

Later in life he taught Semitic languages in the Oriental Academy of Vienna, where he also wrote the first Kurdish-Arabic dictionary.

==Career==
Al Khalidi served as mayor of Jerusalem from the years 1870 to 1876, 1878 to 1879, and 1899 to 1906.

Al-Khalidi played a key role in the opposing political factions established to prohibit the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s attempts to violate the constitution. Al-Khalidi was very familiar with Zionist thought, and the anti-Semitic environment in Europe out of which it emerged. He also perceived the danger Zionism could expose Jews to throughout the domains of the Ottoman Empire.

Compelled by a &quot;holy duty of conscience&quot; to voice his concerns that Zionism would jeopardize the friendly associations between Muslims, Christians and Jews, he wrote a letter On 1 March 1899 to Zadok Kahn, the chief rabbi of France, to prevail on Zionists, through Kahn&#x27;s offices, to leave the area of Palestine in peace.

According to Rashid Khalidi (al-Khalidi&#x27;s great-great-great-nephew), Alexander Scholch and Dominique Perrin, Khalidi was prescient in predicting that, regardless of Jewish historic rights, given the geopolitical context, Zionism could stir an awakening of Arab nationalism uniting Christians and Muslims.

Kahn showed the letter to Theodor Herzl, the founder of political Zionism. On 19 March 1899 Herzl replied to al-Khalidi arguing that both the Ottoman Empire and the non-Jewish population of Palestine would benefit from Jewish immigration. As to al-Khalidi concerns about the non-Jewish majority population of Palestine, Herzl replied rhetorically: &quot;who would think of sending them away?&quot; and concluded ambiguously that &quot;If he (the Ottoman Sultan) will not accept it, we will search and, believe me, we will find elsewhere what we need.&quot;


Scholar Rashid Khalidi notes that this sentiment was penned 4 years after Herzl had confided to his diary the idea of spiriting the Arab population away to make way for Jews:
We must expropriate gently the private property on the estates assigned to us. We shall try to spirit the penniless population across the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it employment in our own country The property owners will come over to our side. Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly.&#x27;

==Death==
Al-Khalidi died on 25 January 1906.

<text>Mosaic Records is an American jazz record company and label established in 1982 by Michael Cuscuna and Charlie Lourie. It produces limited-edition box sets.

The sets recordings are leased from the major record companies, usually for a three- or five-year period, with the edition limited to a specific number of copies, typically 5,000. Sometimes the complete catalog of a label would appear: the complete masters of Milt Gabler&#x27;s Commodore Records were contained in three sets consisting of some 66 LPs. In 2003, the company initiated the Select series of smaller sets, not necessarily &quot;complete&quot; in the usual sense. In 2006, the company began a third line, Mosaic Singles, a series dedicated to reissuing individual albums on CD that have not previously been available in US editions, or at all. In 2009, Mosaic returned to the vinyl format with the HQ Vinyl Series and began issuing three and four LP sets of 2,500-5,000 copies.

Mosaic&#x27;s sets are primarily sold and distributed directly to customers, initially promoted through leading jazz publications, then mail order catalog, and now the internet. The first three years of releases did not sell particularly well. In 1986, Cuscuna reached out to a record-producing acquaintance, Fred Seibert, for help. With partner Alan Goodman their company, Fred/Alan Inc. in New York, devised a catalog and strategy that immediately increased sales almost tenfold and put the company on a solid footing for the first time. Goodman continues to write the copy for all new release sales.

Over 200 sets have now been issued by the company, with most sets&#x27; leases now expired, becoming sought after, expensive collectors&#x27; items. Over three decades the jazz press and general publications have recognized Mosaic, with the New York Times naming it “the most distinctive reissue label in jazz,” All About Jazz calling the company “arguably the premier reissue label in jazz,” and Esquire suggesting it is “America’s most obsessive jazz label.”

<text>The 1984 United States Senate elections were held on November 6, with the 33 seats of Class 2 contested in regular elections. They coincided with the landslide re-election of President Ronald Reagan in the presidential election. In spite of the lopsided presidential race, Reagan&#x27;s Republican Party suffered a net loss of two Senate seats to the Democrats, although it retained control of the Senate with a reduced 53–47 majority. 

Democrats defeated incumbents in Illinois and Iowa, and won an open seat in Tennessee, while Republicans defeated an incumbent in Kentucky. This was the first time since 1972 that Democrats gained Class 2 Senate seats.

== Closest races ==

In six races the margin of victory was under 10%.

Minnesota was the tipping point state with a margin of victory of 16.8%.

== Alabama ==


The 1984 United States Senate election in Alabama was held on November 6, 1984. Incumbent Democratic Senator Howell Heflin was easily re-elected to a second term. Heflin received 94% of the black vote.
== Alaska ==

Incumbent Republican Ted Stevens sought re-election to a fourth term. Owing to his popularity and the conservative bent of Alaska, Stevens did not face major opposition, and easily defeated former Alaska Attorney General John Havelock in the general election.








== Arkansas ==


Incumbent Democrat David Pryor won re-election to a second term over Republican U.S. Representative Ed Bethune.



== Colorado ==

Incumbent Republican William L. Armstrong won re-election to a second term over Democratic Lieutenant Governor of Colorado Nancy E. Dick.




== Delaware ==

Incumbent Democrat and future President of the United States Joe Biden won re-election to a third term, defeating Republican challenger John M. Burris, former Majority Leader of the Delaware House of Representatives.



== Georgia ==

Incumbent Democrat Sam Nunn won re-election to a third term over Republican educator, Mike Hicks



== Idaho ==

Incumbent Republican James A. McClure won re-election to a third term over Democratic Vietnam War veteran, Peter M. Busch.




== Illinois ==

Incumbent Republican Charles H. Percy ran for re-election to a fourth term in the United States Senate. Senator Percy was opposed by Democratic nominee Paul Simon, who was a United States Congressman from Illinois&#x27;s 22nd congressional district. The campaign between Percy and Simon was brutal and toughly-fought, and ended up with Simon ousting Percy by fewer than 90,000 votes, which was, at the time, considered an upset.

The election was very close. Simon prevailed by only 89,126 votes, or 1.86%. Incumbent Percy did well all throughout the state, including the Chicago collar counties. However, Simon received huge numbers out of the heavily populated and Democratic Cook County, which encompasses most of the Chicago Metropolitan Area. Percy led early on and well into the night, but as Cook County began to count all of its votes, Simon pulled ahead. Simon won despite then-president Reagan winning the state easily. Percy called Simon at around 5 A.M. the next day and conceded. Percy also congratulated Simon on his hard-earned victory. Simon was sworn in on January 3, 1985, and served in the senate until January 3, 1997, when he retired. Simon was later succeeded by Dick Durbin, a close friend and fellow Democrat.





== Iowa ==

Incumbent Republican Roger Jepsen ran for re-election to a second term in the United States Senate. Jepsen was opposed by United States Congressman Tom Harkin, from Iowa&#x27;s 5th congressional district, who won the Democratic primary uncontested. The general election was full of mudslinging and personal attacks, including the embellishment by both candidates of their military records; Harkin attacked Jepsen for failing to keep his promise to not sell AWACS aircraft to Saudi Arabia. Ultimately, Harkin defeated Jepsen by a wide margin, winning the first of five terms in the Senate.








== Kansas ==

Incumbent Republican Nancy Kassebaum won re-election to a second term over Democrat James R. Maher, a financial consultant.





== Kentucky ==

Incumbent Democrat Walter Huddleston ran for re-election to a third term, but lost by less than 0.5% to Jefferson County Executive Mitch McConnell.

Huddleston was unopposed in the Democratic Party&#x27;s primary.







== Louisiana ==

Incumbent Democratic J. Bennett Johnston won unopposed to a third term.


== Maine ==

Incumbent Republican William Cohen won re-election to a second term over Democrat Libby Mitchell, State Representative.




== Massachusetts ==

The election was won by Democrat John Kerry, the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts who remained Senator until 2013 when he resigned to become U.S. Secretary of State. One-term incumbent Paul Tsongas declined to seek re-election and retired from the Senate following a battle with cancer.









== Michigan ==

Incumbent Democrat Carl Levin won re-election to a second term.






== Minnesota ==


Incumbent Republican Rudy Boschwitz defeated Democratic challenger Joan Growe, Minnesota Secretary of State.




== Mississippi ==


Incumbent Republican Thad Cochran won re-election to a second term over former Democratic Governor William Winter.




== Montana ==

Incumbent Max Baucus ran for re-election. He easily won renomination in the Democratic primary, and advanced to the general election, where he faced Chuck Cozzens, a former State Representative and the Republican nominee. Despite President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s strong performance in the state that year, Baucus was able to easily win a second term over Cozzens.









== Nebraska ==

Incumbent Democrat J. James Exon won re-election to a second term over Republican businesswoman Nancy Hoch.




== New Hampshire ==

Incumbent Republican Gordon J. Humphrey won re-election to a second term over Democratic U.S. Representative Norman D&#x27;Amours.




== New Jersey ==

Incumbent Democrat Bill Bradley ran for re-election to a second term, defeating Republican Mayor of Montclair Mary V. Mochary.






== New Mexico ==

Incumbent Republican Pete Domenici ran for re-election to a third term, defeating Democrat Judith Pratt.







== North Carolina ==

The election was fought between the Republican incumbent Jesse Helms and Democratic Governor Jim Hunt. Helms won the election, the most expensive non-presidential election in United States history up to that point, by a margin significantly reduced from that that Helms achieved in 1978.





Hunt had a commanding lead in opinion polls for much of the campaign, with one poll in 1983 putting him nineteen points clear of Helms. However, that was changed by the most bitterly contested election in the country that year. Hunt ran a campaign ad connecting Helms to death squads in El Salvador through his association with the Nationalist Republican Alliance, for whom Roberto d&#x27;Aubuisson had recently run for the President of El Salvador. In the short time before election day, however, the highly popular incumbent US President Ronald Reagan gave Helms a significant boost by campaigning for him and running a local TV ad praising Helms and asking registered voters in North Carolina to re-elect him.

The election cost a total of $26,379,483 in total reported spending (over twelve times as much as the 1980 race), of which, 64% ($16.9m) was spent by Helms.



Voters Education Project (VEP) in Atlanta study showed that Helms received 63 percent of the white vote and was particularly successful in small towns and rural areas, while receiving less than 1 percent of the black vote in 35 almost-all-black precincts. &quot;Hunt got 37 percent of the white and 98.8 percent of the black vote, according to VEP. But only 61 percent of registered blacks voted, down from 63 percent in 1980.&quot; While, It had among the lowest industrial wages in the United States and was third in terms of mobile homes.

== Oklahoma ==
Incumbent Democrat David Boren won re-election to a second term.






== Oregon ==

Incumbent Republican Mark Hatfield sought re-election, defeating Democratic State Senator Margie Hendricksen.




== Rhode Island ==

Incumbent Democrat Claiborne Pell sought re-election, defeating Republican Barbara M. Leonard.



== South Carolina ==

Popular incumbent Republican Strom Thurmond cruised to re-election against Democratic challenger Melvin Purvis. Melvin Purvis, a white minister and the son of famous FBI agent Melvin Purvis, won a close race against black photographer Cecil J. Williams. The closeness of the race and the fact that the black candidate did not win propelled Jesse Jackson to request a Justice Department investigation into the primary and he also considered an independent bid for the seat. Governor Richard Riley and 3rd district Representative Butler Derrick flirted with running, but backed down when Thurmond received endorsements from prominent Democrats in South Carolina.

Senator Strom Thurmond easily defeated Robert Cunningham to advance to the general election.

Thurmond received endorsements from former Democratic governor Robert Evander McNair, Charleston mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., and an assortment of black mayors in the state. He did not face a serious challenge and spent almost $1.5 million on the race whereas Purvis spent less than $10,000. An ironic footnote to the election is the fact that Purvis used Thurmond&#x27;s age as an issue in the campaign. He claimed Thurmond was too old, yet Purvis died less than two years after the election of a heart attack at age 46.

== South Dakota ==

Incumbent Republican Larry Pressler won re-election for a second term, defeating Democrat George V. Cunningham.



== Tennessee ==
Three-term popular incumbent Howard Baker, who had served as United States Senate Majority Leader since 1981 (Minority Leader from 1977 to 1981) decided not to seek re-election in order to concentrate on a planned bid for 1988 Republican presidential nomination (which did not happen, as he later accepted a White House Chief of Staff position under President Ronald Reagan). This made a seat open.

Democrats nominated Representative and future Vice President of the United States Al Gore, whose father Albert Gore, Sr. once held the other Tennessee Senate seat.


In the Republican primary, held on August 2, state Senator Victor Ashe easily emerged as a winner.


Although the Senate election coincided with the landslide re-election of President Reagan, who carried Tennessee by a wide margin, this time his victory did not have any coattails, as it did in 1980, and Democrats picked up three Republican seats. One of the Democratic gains was in Tennessee, where moderate democrat Gore won in a landslide:





== Texas ==

Incumbent Republican John G. Tower decided to retire, instead of seeking a fifth term. Republican Phil Gramm won the open seat over Democratic State Senator Lloyd Doggett.

The Democratic primary was 45% Hispanic, but included many moderate to conservative voters. Hance positioned himself as the most moderate to conservative candidate, who co-sponsored President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s tax package. Doggett was the more liberal candidate, attacking Reaganomics and getting endorsements from the Texas teachers&#x27; union and Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower. Krueger was seen as the front runner and was a moderate who supported the state&#x27;s oil and gas industry, but had close ties with the Hispanic community because he was Spanish-speaking. Hance attacked both Kroeger and Doggett for supporting amnesty for illegal aliens and supporting gay rights.
The initial primary was extremely close between the top three candidates. Each candidate got 31% of the electorate. Hance ranked first, only 273 votes ahead of Doggett and 1,560 votes ahead of Krueger.

Since no candidate passed the 50% threshold, Hance and Doggett qualified for the run-off election. Hance fired his pollster despite ranking first. Krueger endorsed fellow U.S. Congressman Hance, saying &quot;Ultimately, the quality of one&#x27;s public service depends upon the character that one displays in filling an office.&quot; In the June election, Doggett very narrowly defeated Hance by just 1,345 votes.

Initial election on May 5, 1984



Run-off election on June 2, 1984

The Republican primary was a highly competitive, multimillion-dollar contest. Gramm recently switched parties in 1983, but he was a conservative who supported Reaganomics. Gramm spent $4 million.






== Virginia ==

Incumbent Republican John W. Warner won re-election to a second term. He handily defeated Edythe C. Harrison, member of the Virginia House of Delegates the &quot;first woman in Virginia nominated by the Democratic Party for statewide office.&quot;




== West Virginia ==

Incumbent Democratic Jennings Randolph decided to retire, instead of seeking a fifth term. Democrat Jay Rockefeller won the open seat over Republican John Raese.




== Wyoming ==

Incumbent Republican Alan K. Simpson has won re-election for a second term, defeating Democrat Victor A. Ryan.

<text>Ampelography (ἄμπελος, &quot;vine&quot; + γράφος, &quot;writing&quot;) is the field of botany concerned with the identification and classification of grapevines, &quot;Vitis&quot; spp. Traditionally this has been done by comparing the shape and colour of the vine leaves and grape berries; more recently the study of vines has been revolutionised by DNA fingerprinting.

==Early history==
The grape vine is an extremely variable species and some varieties, such as Pinot, mutate particularly frequently. At the same time, the wine and table grape industries have been important since ancient times, so large sums of money can depend on the correct identification of different varieties and clones of grapevines.

The science of ampelography began seriously in the 19th century, when it became important to understand more about the different species of vine, as they had very different resistance to disease and pests such as phylloxera.

Many vine identification books were published at this time, one of which is Victor Rendu&#x27;s &quot;Ampélographie française&quot; of 1857, featuring hand-colored lithographs by Eugene Grobon.

==Pierre Galet==
Until the Second World War, ampelography had been an art. Then Pierre Galet of the &quot;École nationale supérieure agronomique de Montpellier&quot; made a systematic assembly of criteria for the identification of vines. The Galet system was based on the shape and contours of the leaves, the characteristics of growing shoots, shoot tips, petioles, the sex of the flowers, the shape of the grape clusters and the colour, size and pips of the grapes themselves. The grapes are less affected by environmental factors than the leaves and the shoots, but are obviously not around for as long. He even included grape flavour as a criterion, but this is rather subjective.

Galet then published the definitive book, &quot;Ampélographie pratique&quot;, in 1952, featuring 9,600 types of vine. &quot;Ampélographie pratique&quot; was translated into English by Lucie Morton, published in 1979 and updated in 2000.

==&quot;Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography&quot;==
In 2012, Italian publisher L&#x27;Artistica Editrice published &quot;Illustrated Historical Universal Ampelography&quot;, a three volume set which contains the most important books edited in France and Italy between 1800 and 1900: the &quot;Ampélographie&quot; of Pierre Viala and Victor Vermorel, the grapes section of &quot;Pomona Italiana&quot; by Count Giorgio Gallesio and the &quot;Ampelografia Italiana&quot; of the Italian Ministry of Agriculture. The book collects 551 color plates of grapes from all over the world, with texts in Italian and English, which describe the morphological and agricultural characteristics of each vine variety, as well as their synonyms and historical curiosities.

==DNA==
Carole Meredith at the University of California, Davis, pioneered the use of genetic fingerprinting for vine identification. Famous successes with the technique include proving the identity of Zinfandel, Primitivo, and Crljenak Kaštelanski, and identifying the parents of Sangiovese as Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo. Such exercises are giving valuable insight into historical patterns of trade and migration.

DNA fingerprinting uses segments of DNA that do not affect the look or taste of the grapes. More recent work has identified the genes responsible for the differences between grape varieties, such as the &quot;VvMYBA1&quot; and &quot;VvMYBA2&quot; genes that control grape colour, or the &quot;VvGAI1&quot; gene that is mutated in some cells of Pinot Meunier compared to Pinot noir.

<text>Agnes Strickland (18 July 1796 – 8 July 1874) was an English historical writer and poet. She is particularly remembered for her &quot;Lives of the Queens of England&quot; (12 vols, 1840–1848).

==Biography==
The daughter of Thomas Strickland and his wife Elizabeth ( Homer), Agnes was born in Rotherhithe, at that time in Surrey, where her father was employed as a manager of the Greenland Dock. She was christened at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Rotherhithe on 18 August 1796. The family subsequently moved to Thorpe Hamlet, Norwich, and then Stowe House, near Bungay, Suffolk, before settling in 1808 at Reydon Hall, Reydon, near Southwold, also in Suffolk. Agnes&#x27; siblings were Elizabeth, Sarah, Jane Margaret, Catharine Parr Traill, Susanna Moodie (1803–1885), Thomas, and Samuel Strickland. Agnes and her elder sister, Elizabeth, were educated by their father to a standard more usual for boys at that time. All of the children except Sarah and Tom eventually became writers.

Agnes began her literary career with a poem, &quot;Worcester Field&quot;, followed by &quot;The Seven Ages of Woman&quot; and &quot;Demetrius&quot;. Abandoning poetry, she produced &quot;Historical Tales of Illustrious British Children&quot; (1833), &quot;The Pilgrims of Walsingham&quot; (1835), and &quot;Tales and Stories from History&quot; (1836). Her chief works, however, are &quot;Lives of the Queens of England from the Norman Conquest, Lives of the Queens of Scotland, and English Princesses, etc.&quot;. (8 vols., 1850–1859), &quot;Lives of the Bachelor Kings of England&quot; (1861), and &quot;Letters of Mary Queen of Scots&quot;, in some of which she was assisted by her sister Elizabeth. Strickland&#x27;s researches were laborious and conscientious, and she remains a useful source. Her style is engaging and anecdotal, not as objective as most modern historians, but gives valuable insight into the mores of her own time.

Much of the Strickland sisters&#x27; historical research and writing was done by Elizabeth. Elizabeth, however, refused all publicity, and Agnes was named as the sole author. Their biographical works are fine representations of the biographies written by Victorian women, many of which focused on female subjects and included aspects of social history such as dress, manners, and diet.

Agnes&#x27; sisters Susanna Moodie and Catharine Parr Traill became particularly well known for their works about pioneer life in early Canada, where they both emigrated with their husbands in 1832. Agnes Strickland was a friend and correspondent of the Scottish poet and composer, Mary Maxwell Campbell.

<text>Navoiy ( ; ) is a city and the capital of Navoiy Region in the central part of Uzbekistan. Administratively, it is a district-level city, that includes the urban-type settlement Tinchlik. It is located at latitude 40° 5&#x27; 4N; longitude 65° 22&#x27; 45E, at an altitude of 382 meters. The city is named after Alisher Navoiy. As of 2024, its population was 161,300 inhabitants.

== History ==
The city was founded in 1958, near the &quot;Old city&quot; originally known as Karmana under the Emirate of Bukhara, under the name of the great poet and statesman Alisher Navoiy, who wrote in Persian and Chaghatai at the court of Emir Husein Boykara (or Husayn Bayqaro) in Herat.

Even though the town is very young, it has rich history in this area and its surroundings. The Great Silk Road went through the region in ancient times. Archeological research in the area has also produced findings of numerous traces of Ancient Saki, Khorezm and Baktriya cultures.

== Government ==
== Population ==
== Main sites ==

* The Rabati Malik is a heavily fortified 11th century caravanserai built by the Karakhanid ruler Abu’l Hasan Shams al Mulk Nasr to protect Silk Road merchants, their animals, and trade goods at night. The building is on UNESCO’s Tentative List for World Heritage Site status, along with Sardoba Malik, the domed reservoir which supplied the caravanserai with water. Rabati Malik is largely in ruins due to an earthquake in 1968, but the 12m high portal still stands and has been partially restored, as has the reservoir dome. The portal is decorated with carved terracotta, including eight-pointed stars and Arabic calligraphy.
* The Deggaroniy Mausoleum is the burial place of the theologian Mavlono Orif Deggaroniy (1313–76), teacher of Khoja Bahauddin Naqshbandi. It is a simple mud brick building with low domes, and is a place of pilgrimage for Naqshbandi Sufis.
* The Mir Said Bakhrom Mausoleum is a simple brick built mausoleum dating from the 11th century. The building is an important architectural prototype, with certain similarities to the Samanid Mausoleum in Bukhara. The portal is decorated with a Kufic inscription made from raised bricks, and the saint’s grave is covered with marble. The building is on UNESCO’s Tentative List for World Heritage Site status.
* The Kasim Sheikh complex was built in the 16th century by Abdulla Khan, Emir of Bukhara, as a khanagha, a hostel for wandering Sufi holy men. The mosque at the khanagha is now used as Navoi’s main mosque, but it is open to the public. There is an attractive turquoise dome and majolica tile work on the exterior of the building, and the interior is painted in geometric patterns in shades of blue.
* Adventist Church is the first and only Seventh-day Adventist church in the city of Navoi and it was built between 1996 and 2001. 
* Navoi Bazaar is the city’s main market. It is a huge, mostly covered market with different areas dedicated to fresh fruit and vegetables, dried goods, bread and pastries, meat, etc.

== Economy ==
Navoiy Region has large stocks of natural gas and deposits of precious metals, as well as large stocks of raw materials for production of construction materials. Among enterprises there are Navoi and Zarafshan Gold Mining and Metallurgical Complexes, which extract one of the purest golds in the world. The enterprise NavoiyAzot is the largest producer of mineral fertilizers in the country.

=== Navoiy Free Industrial Economic Zone (FIEZ) ===
The Navoi Free Industrial Economic Zone (FIEZ) with special conditions for foreign investments was created in Navoi Region of Uzbekistan, nearby Navoiy International Airport. It is due to operate for 30 years.

Businesses in FIEZ enjoy favourable customs, currency and tax regulations and simplified procedures for entry, stay and obtaining of work permit for non-resident citizens. They are exempt from taxes for a period depending on the amount of direct investments:
* from 3 to 10 million dollars – for 7 years;
* from 10 to 30 million dollars – for 10 years, with reduction of profit and unified tax payment rates by 50% in the next 5 years;
* more than 30 million dollars – for 15 years, with reduction of profit and unified tax payment rates by 50% in the next 10 years.
* Along with this, business entities will be exempted from paying customs duties (excluding charges for customs clearance) for equipment, raw materials and components imported for the production of export oriented goods. They will be able to make payments in foreign currency within the FIEZ, as well as to use convenient terms of payments for exported and imported goods.
Management of the FIEZ will be by an Administrative Council which may select an international company to manage the zone on a contract basis. A FIEZ development fund aimed to support infrastructure development is also planned.

13 joint ventures operate in Navoi FIEZ which produce car components, ADSL modems, LED lamps, cosmetics, diapers, and other products.

=== Transportation ===
The Zone will be located at a distance of 800 meters from the highway E-40, 1,8 km from the cargo terminal of Navoiy Airport, connected to international railway routes towards countries of Europe (via Russia), South Asia (via China), Middle East and the Gulf (via Iran). The distance to the nearest water and gas distribution centres is 800 m, electrical station – 8 km.

==Climate==
Navoiy has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) bordering on a cold desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;), characterised by hot to sweltering and arid summers, alongside chilly winters with frequent light precipitation.

<text>John Albert Taylor (June 6, 1959 – January 26, 1996) was an American who was convicted of burglary and carrying a concealed weapon in the state of Florida, and sexual assault and murder in the state of Utah. Taylor&#x27;s own sister tipped off police in June 1989 after 11-year-old Charla King was found raped and strangled to death in Washington Terrace, Utah. His fingerprints were found at the crime scene, which was located in an apartment complex where he had been staying. In December 1989, Taylor was sentenced to death and placed on death row at Utah State Prison.

Taylor gave up appealing his sentence after his request for retrial was rejected by the Utah Supreme Court, though he continued to maintain his innocence. He became the second person to be executed by firing squad in the United States (after Gary Gilmore) since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Taylor said he chose this method of execution to embarrass the state of Utah. On January 26, 1996, the day of Taylor&#x27;s execution, legislation was introduced in the Utah House of Representatives to eliminate the firing squad.

==Background==
John Albert Taylor was born in Ogden, Utah to Albert and Gaylene Taylor, who separated during his infancy. He moved several times during his youth, including a move to Colorado at the age of nine, when he was told that his father had died. According to Taylor, he was raised in Florida, where he was abused as a child and became involved in drugs by his teens. Taylor stated that he did not get along with his stepfather, a Vietnam veteran, or his mother: &quot;But she could never control me. My mother had a lot of animosity toward my father. They alienated me for a long time. I was the whipping post.&quot; At the age of 13, he stabbed his stepfather. According to court records, he repeatedly raped and sodomized his sister Laurie during his teens, and raped, and sodomized other young girls, and was committed to a sex offender program. In 1974, Taylor moved back to Ogden to live with his grandmother, but soon returned to Florida.

In 1977, Taylor was arrested in Florida and charged with burglary and carrying a concealed weapon after he was caught with a stolen gun. He was convicted and imprisoned until December 1981, when he was released on parole. In March 1982, he was arrested in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for armed burglary, armed robbery, and sexual assault. He had been characterized by medical personnel at the age of 17 as &quot;a remorseless pedophile.&quot; He was acquitted of the charges in September 1982, but was sentenced to 15 additional years in prison for parole violations. In 1989, Taylor was released and departed for Utah to be with his sisters and biological father, who he discovered was still alive.

==Murder of Charla King==
At around 3:20 p.m. on June 23, 1989, Sherron King returned from work to her apartment in Washington Terrace, Utah to find the body of her daughter Charla in the bedroom with a nightgown wrapped around her head and panties stuffed in her mouth. After calling the police, she was instructed to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation and discovered that Charla had been strangled to death with a telephone cord. Charla&#x27;s foster grandmother Bertha Poster stated that she had dropped Charla off at the apartment at about 1:30 p.m. after visiting the mall. Charla had been planning to celebrate her 12th birthday at an amusement park on the next day. Prosecutors believe that Taylor entered the house with intent on sexually molesting the girl. When she caught him in the house, prosecutors believe, he chased her into the bedroom, and placed her underwear in her mouth. He raped her, placed a nightgown over her head, and strangled her to death.

===Arrest===
On June 25, a tipster, who was later revealed to be Taylor&#x27;s sister Laurie Galli, contacted Washington Terrace Police officer Marcia Gathercole with information connected to the murder. Taylor&#x27;s fingerprints were found on a telephone in the King residence and matched to records provided by authorities in Fort Lauderdale. He was arrested at about 9 p.m. on June 28 at the home of his half-sister/incestuous lover Tresa Taylor in Ogden, Utah and charged with first-degree burglary, first-degree child rape, and first-degree murder the next morning. Taylor had arrived from Florida four days before the murder and had been staying with another sister in the same apartment complex.

Sherron King moved out of the apartment complex on June 28. She was upset that the neighbors who came forward as witnesses did nothing when they heard her daughter screaming.

===Murder trial===
On November 27, 1989, the trial commenced under District Judge David Roth after Taylor waived his right to a jury. Taylor testified on his own behalf that he only entered the apartment in the act of burglary while no one was home, leaving his fingerprints on the phone when he found money underneath it. Weber County deputy attorney William Daines stated that Taylor previously denied being in the apartment and that two witnesses placed him at the scene at the time of the crime. Prison inmate Mike Gallegos testified that he had a brief conversation in which Taylor told him that he killed a girl by accident, and masturbated on the corpse. Duane Moyes and James Gaskill of the Weber State College crime laboratory testified that the person who cut the telephone cord with a knife and wrapped it around the neck of the victim was likely the same as the one who left behind fingerprints on the phone. Lab director Gaskill stated that the prints, three of which were matched to fingers on Taylor&#x27;s left hand, were the only evidence that placed Taylor at the crime scene. Gaskill said there was no evidence in the apartment to indicate a burglary took place or that any other person was connected to the murder.

On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor guilty of the first-degree child rape and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King. During the penalty phase of Taylor&#x27;s trial, his half-sister Leslie Beale traveled from Florida to testify about his harsh treatment under his stepfather and the three years that Taylor spent in a sex offender program at a Florida mental institution. On December 19, Taylor became the first convict in 40 years to be sent to death row by a Weber County court. Roth said that the facts of the case outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Taylor&#x27;s father Albert attended most of his son&#x27;s court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990. Taylor said he was not permitted to attend his father&#x27;s funeral.

===Appeals===

The case was automatically appealed to the Utah Supreme Court, which upheld Taylor&#x27;s conviction and sentence in October 1991. Taylor&#x27;s execution was initially scheduled for January 15, 1992. The date was rescheduled to June 24 when Taylor&#x27;s attorney Martin Gravis requested to withdraw from the case. On June 17, Judge Roth granted a stay of execution after Taylor&#x27;s new defense attorney Ron Yengich requested more time to prepare an appeal. At issue was a new 1992 law in Utah that established the sentence of life imprisonment without parole.

While incarcerated at Utah State Prison, Taylor kept busy in an effort to overcome his claustrophobia and boredom. He earned his high school diploma and studied to be a paralegal until his educational grant money ran out.

In October 1995, Taylor decided to end further appeals after the Utah Supreme Court rejected his argument that his legal counsel was ineffective. He fired defense attorney Ed Brass, stating: &quot;If I don&#x27;t fight for my appeal, I don&#x27;t need an attorney.&quot; Taylor said he was prepared to die partly because of his failing health, including an enlarged heart, bleeding ulcers, and swollen legs and feet.


Judge Roth ordered Taylor to choose a method of execution. Taylor chose to be executed by firing squad to make the process more difficult for Utah state officials. In an interview with the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, he stated: &quot;I didn&#x27;t commit the murder, and I&#x27;m not going to submit to letting them kill me on that table.&quot; Regarding the option of lethal injection, Taylor said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to go flipping around like a fish out of water on that table.&quot;

==Execution==
For his last meal Taylor ordered a large Ambassador pizza with thin crust, onions, mushrooms, hot peppers, sausage, pepperoni, ham and extra cheese. He also asked for a Coke. When Taylor ordered a last meal of pizzas &quot;with everything,&quot; some law enforcement veterans recalled that the same request was made by Barton Kay Kirkham, the last man to be hanged in Utah. Like Taylor, Kirkham had selected his method of execution with the goal of inconveniencing the state. On January 25, 1996, Taylor spent his final evening sharing his pizza with his uncle Gordon Lee while joined by former attorney Ed Brass and Catholic priest Reyes Rodriguez, who administered the Last Rites. Taylor, whose stomach had been doing &quot;flip-flops&quot; earlier in the day, requested antacid medication and declined deputy warden Wally Schulsen&#x27;s offer for more pizza, soda, and coffee. He gave his glasses to warden Hank Galetka and said, &quot;There is no need for them.&quot; Taylor refused an offer to be sedated before his execution, but was allowed his first cigarette in six years.

Five police officers, who volunteered to carry out the execution, were each paid $300. The shooters used identical Winchester Model 94 rifles. One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table and handed them to another prison official sitting in a small room, out of sight. The second prison official would then load the rifle, and return it to the table. Four of the rifles were loaded with live ammunition. One chosen at random was loaded with a wax bullet so that none of the officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot. The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the report and recoil were difficult to distinguish from those of a real cartridge.

===Media coverage===

Over 168 news and television crews from around the world were on hand to report the execution, which was set up inside a warehouse at Utah State Prison in Draper. Nine media witnesses were allowed to record the actual event. Actor and activist Mike Farrell appeared as a commentator for the American Civil Liberties Union in opposition to the death penalty. Elliott King, the uncle of Charla King, was the sole member of the victim&#x27;s family to arrive as a witness and expressed that he had no sympathy for Taylor. Sister Helen Prejean, the author of &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, wrote Taylor a letter that was delivered right before his execution.

===Death===
Shortly before midnight, Taylor was led into the execution chamber and strapped to a chair 17 feet away from the shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor&#x27;s chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor&#x27;s neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.

===Aftermath===
After an autopsy, Taylor&#x27;s remains were cremated and shipped to his uncle Gordon Lee in Oregon. The Salt Lake County Sheriff&#x27;s Office said it would specify homicide as the cause of death on Taylor&#x27;s death certificate because the execution met the state&#x27;s definition of &quot;death by another&#x27;s hand.&quot; A commemorative coin was created to recognize the staff who had participated in the execution. Eight hours after Taylor&#x27;s execution, Utah State Representative Sheryl Allen first introduced a bill to eliminate the firing squad, and later succeeded in passing HB180, which removed the right of the condemned to choose their method of execution after February 2004.

<text>The 1982 United States Senate elections were held on November 2, 1982. They were elections for the United States Senate following Republican gains in 1980. The 33 Senate seats of Class 1 were up for election in 1982. A total of four seats changed hands between parties, with Democrats winning seats in New Jersey and New Mexico, and Republicans taking seats in Nevada and the seat of the lone independent, Senator Harry Byrd Jr., in Virginia. Democrats made a net gain of one seat bringing them to 46 seats, while Republicans stayed at 54 seats for a majority. However, the Democratic gain in New Jersey replaced a Republican that had been appointed earlier in the year. Liberal Republicans senators in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Vermont held onto their seats, keeping the Senate in Republican hands.

A special election was also held in Washington state in 1983 that gave Republicans a seat that was previously held by a Democrat, bringing their majority to 55–45. , this is the last time Democrats won a U.S. Senate election in Mississippi and the last time Republicans won one in Connecticut.

== Arizona ==

Incumbent Democrat Dennis DeConcini won re-election to a second term over Republican Pete Dunn, State Representative.





== California ==

Incumbent Republican S. I. Hayakawa decided to retire after one term. Republican Pete Wilson, mayor of San Diego and former Assemblyman, won the open seat over Democratic Governor Jerry Brown.

Wilson was known as a fiscal conservative who supported Proposition 13, although Wilson had opposed the measure while mayor of San Diego. However, Brown ran on his gubernatorial record of building the largest state budget surpluses in California history. Both Wilson and Brown were moderate-to-liberal on social issues, including support for abortion rights. The election was expected to be close, with Brown holding a slim lead in most of the polls leading up to Election Day. Wilson hammered away at Brown&#x27;s appointment of California Chief Justice Rose Bird, using this to portray himself as tougher on crime than Brown was. Brown&#x27;s late entry into the 1980 Democratic presidential primary, after promising not to run, was also an issue. President Ronald Reagan made a number of visits to California late in the race to campaign for Wilson. Reagan quipped that the last thing he wanted to see was one of his home state&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats falling into Democrats&#x27; hands, especially to be occupied by the man who succeeded him as governor. Despite exit polls indicating a narrow Brown victory, Wilson won by a wide margin.






== Connecticut ==

Incumbent Republican Lowell P. Weicker Jr. won re-election to a third term over Democratic member of the House Toby Moffett.





== Delaware ==

Incumbent Republican Bill V. Roth won reelection to a third term over the state&#x27;s Democratic Insurance Commissioner David N. Levinson.





== Florida ==

Incumbent Democrat Lawton Chiles won re-election to a third term over Republican state senator Van B. Poole.









== Hawaii ==

Incumbent Democrat Spark Matsunaga won re-election to a second term over Republican Clarence Brown, a retired Foreign Service officer




== Indiana ==

Incumbent Republican Richard Lugar faced Democratic United States Representative Floyd Fithian in the general election. Lugar won with a margin of 54% of the vote, compared to Fithian&#x27;s 46%.

After the 1980 census, the Indiana General Assembly redistricted Indiana&#x27;s congressional districts, pushing Democratic representative Floyd Fithian&#x27;s district into more conservative territory. After redistricting, Fithian, the three term incumbent of Indiana&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, decided to run for Secretary of State of Indiana, but withdrew from the primary to ultimately run for the United States Senate. He challenged fellow Democrat and one term Indiana State Senator Michael Kendall of Jasper, Indiana, who Fithian earlier encouraged to run for the Senate. Kendall, who represented Indiana&#x27;s 47th Senate district and formed the Notre Dame Students for Robert Kennedy organization during the 1968 presidential election, was seen a young progressive alternative to Fithian, who he called the &quot;ideological twin of Richard Lugar.&quot; After the bitterly contested primary, Fithian prevailed over Kendall, winning with 59% of the vote.



Incumbent United States Senator Richard Lugar won the republican nomination in an uncontested primary on May 4, 1982.


In the general election, Lugar faced Fithian and American Party candidate Raymond James.

On November 5, 1982, Lugar defeated Fithian and James in the general election, winning 74 of Indiana&#x27;s 93 counties.




== Maine ==


Incumbent Democrat George J. Mitchell, originally appointed to the seat after Edmund Muskie resigned, won re-election to his full six-year term over Republican U.S. Representative David F. Emery, earning 61% of the vote to Emery&#x27;s 39%. Mitchell would serve two more terms in the Senate, eventually serving as Senate Majority Leader.



== Maryland ==

Incumbent Democrat Paul Sarbanes won re-election to a second term in office. He defeated the Republican former Representative from Maryland&#x27;s 5th district and Prince George&#x27;s County Executive Lawrence Hogan.




== Massachusetts ==

Incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy won re-election to his fifth (his fourth full) term over Republican Ray Shamie, a millionaire businessman and metalwork entrepreneur.





== Michigan ==

Incumbent Democrat Don Riegle won re-election to a second term, defeating Republican challenger Philip Ruppe, a former U.S. Representative from Houghton.






== Minnesota ==

Incumbent Republican David Durenberger won re-election to his second term over Democratic businessman Mark Dayton.




Dayton, 35, self-financed his campaign. Married to a Rockefeller and heir to a department store, his net worth was an estimated $30 million. Durenberger, who in 1978 and won the special election to finish the term of the late Hubert Humphrey, was largely unknown. He was considered a moderate, but supported Reagan&#x27;s tax cuts. Dayton ran against Reaganomics. He has also campaigned against tax breaks for the wealthy and even promised &quot;to close tax loopholes for the rich and the corporations—and if you think that includes the Daytons, you&#x27;re right.&quot; By the end of September, the senate election already became the most expensive election of all time, with over $8 million being spent. Dayton spent over $5 million, while Durenberger spent over $2 million.




== Mississippi ==

Incumbent Democrat John C. Stennis won re-election to his seventh term over Republican Haley Barbour, a political operative who campaigned for U.S. Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.



== Missouri ==


Incumbent John Danforth, originally elected in the 1976 United States Senate election in Missouri, ran for a second term. In the general election, he narrowly defeated state senator Harriett Woods by just over a percentage point. Danforth would go on to serve two more terms in the Senate.




== Montana ==

Incumbent John Melcher, who was first elected to the Senate in 1976, opted to run for re-election. He won the Democratic primary after he faced a tough intraparty challenger, and advanced to the general election, where he faced Larry R. Williams, an author and the Republican nominee, and Larry Dodge, the Libertarian nominee. Though his margin was reduced significantly from his initial election, Melcher still comfortably won re-election to his second and final term in the Senate.

During his first term in the Senate, Melcher&#x27;s relative conservatism for a Democrat prompted a primary challenger in Michael Bond, a housing contractor who campaigned on his opposition to nuclear war. Bond attacked Melcher for voting to increase spending on nuclear arms, and pledged to reduce military spending to $60 billion and to use the savings to reduce interest rates. During the campaign, Bond came under fire from the state branches of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Disabled American Veterans for turning in his draft card in 1967 to protest the Vietnam War, who put out a statement, saying, &quot;There is no place in the U.S. Senate for any draft dodger, draft card burner or draft protester of any kind.&quot;








== Nebraska ==

Incumbent Democrat Edward Zorinsky won re-election.





== Nevada ==

Incumbent Democrat Howard Cannon ran for re-election to a fifth term, but lost to Republican State Senator Chic Hecht.




== New Jersey ==

Democrat Frank Lautenberg won for the seat held by retiring incumbent Republican Senator Nicholas Brady. Lautenberg won the seat with a margin of 3.2% over member of the House Millicent Fenwick.

Cresitello dropped out of the race on May 27 but remained on the June 8 primary ballot.







The seat had been occupied by Democrat Harrison A. Williams, who resigned on March 11, 1982, after being implicated in the Abscam scandal. After Williams&#x27; resignation, Republican Governor Thomas Kean appointed Republican Nicholas F. Brady to the seat. Brady served in the Senate through the primary and general elections but did not run for the seat himself.

In the general election, Lautenberg faced popular Republican member of the House Millicent Fenwick. She ran on a very progressive platform and polls in the Summer of 1982 put her ahead by 18 points. Even Lautenberg quipped that she was &quot;the most popular candidate in the country.&quot; Lautenberg spent more of his own money, eventually out-spending Fenwick two-to-one. He emphasised President Reagan&#x27;s unpopularity, reminded the voters that she would be a vote for a Republican majority in the Senate and called Fenwick, who was 72, &quot;eccentric&quot; and &quot;erratic&quot; but denied that he was referring to her age. He did however point out that she would be almost 80 at the end of her first term and was therefore unlikely to gain much seniority in the Senate. Coincidentally, the age issue would be used against Lautenberg in his own re-election bid in 2008.

Lautenberg won by 51% to 48%, in what was considered a major upset. Brady, who had just a few days left in his appointed term, resigned on December 27, 1982, allowing Lautenberg to take office several days before the traditional swearing-in of senators, which gave him an edge in seniority over the other freshman senators.





== New Mexico ==

Incumbent Republican Harrison Schmitt was running for re-election to a second term, but lost to Democrat Jeff Bingaman, Attorney General of New Mexico.



== New York ==

Incumbent Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan won re-election to a second term over Republican Assemblywoman Florence Sullivan.




== North Dakota ==


The incumbent, North Dakota Democratic NPL Party (Dem-NPL) Quentin Burdick, sought and received re-election to his fifth term, defeating Republican candidate Gene Knorr.

Only Burdick filed as a Dem-NPLer, and the endorsed Republican candidate was cattle rancher Gene Knorr. Burdick and Knorr won the primary elections for their respective parties. Burdick&#x27;s campaign was known for employing more television advertisement spending when compared with his campaigns in the past, as well as making several negative portrayals. Knorr had the support of Vice President George H. W. Bush, who campaigned in state to support his candidacy. The election was also noted as the first where Burdick&#x27;s age began to become an issue. Burdick, who was 74 during the year of the election, faced a much younger Knorr, who was 41. At one point, Burdick challenged Knorr to a fistfight to prove his vitality; but the challenge, assumed to be a joke, never occurred. After being defeated, Knorr moved to Washington, D.C., where he took the position of staff vice president with Philip Morris International.

One independent candidate, Anna B. Bourgois, also filed before the deadline, running under her self-created party titled God, Family, and Country. Bourgois would later run for North Dakota&#x27;s other United States Senate seat as an independent in 1986, challenging Mark Andrews. She received over 8,000 votes in the election, which is rather high for an independent. Some attribute her large number of votes to the name of her party – which was based on things that North Dakotans valued. Despite the result, Bourgois&#x27; campaign still had little impact on the outcome.




Prior to the 1982 Senate campaign, Knorr had been working in Washington, DC since 1970 when he worked for the Department of Treasury. He began working in Washington, DC, residing in McLean, Virginia after receiving a Juris Doctor from Northwestern University where he was celebrated in debate. From Treasury, he worked as a lobbyist with Charls E. Walker Associates.

== Ohio ==

Incumbent Democrat Howard Metzenbaum successfully sought re-election to his third term, defeating Republican State Senator from Bucyrus Paul Pfeifer.





== Pennsylvania ==

Incumbent Republican H. John Heinz III successfully sought re-election to another term, defeating Democratic nominee Cyril Wecht, member of the Allegheny County Board of Commissioners.

John Heinz&#x27;s Democratic opponent in the 1982 election was Allegheny County commissioner and former coroner Cyril Wecht, who lacked significant name recognition outside of Pittsburgh, his home town. Although the 1982 elections were a setback nationally for incumbent President Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party, neither Heinz nor incumbent Republican governor Dick Thornburgh, who was also up for re-election in 1982, were challenged by Democrats with statewide prominence. Wecht ran a low-budget campaign lacking the assets to boost his name recognition; &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; ran a headline dubbing the race &quot;The Race for Senator No One Seemed to Notice.&quot; Despite this, Heinz ran a cautious campaign, running as a moderate due to Pennsylvania&#x27;s unemployment, 11%, one of the highest in the nation at the time, as well as the declining health of Pennsylvania&#x27;s coal mining, manufacturing and steel industries. In the end, Heinz won the election by a wide margin, winning 59.3% of the popular vote. Wecht won 39.2% of the popular vote.




== Rhode Island ==

Incumbent Republican John Chafee successfully sought re-election to a second term, defeating Democrat Julius C. Michaelson, former Attorney General of Rhode Island.






== Tennessee ==

Democrat Jim Sasser was re-elected with 61.9% of the vote, over Republican Robin Beard, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.



== Texas ==

Incumbent Democrat Lloyd Bentsen successfully ran for re-election to his third term, defeating Republican U.S. Representative James M. Collins.

Democratic incumbent, Lloyd Bentsen, won re-election.





== Utah ==


Incumbent Republican Orrin Hatch successfully ran for re-election to his second term, defeating Democrat mayor of Salt Lake City Ted Wilson.





== Vermont ==

Incumbent Republican Robert Stafford successfully ran for re-election to another term in the United States Senate, defeating Democratic candidate James A. Guest.











== Virginia ==

U.S. Representative from Virginia&#x27;s 1st district, Paul Trible replaced Independent Senator Harry F. Byrd Jr., who was stepping down after three terms. He beat Democratic Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, Richard Joseph Davis.




== Washington ==

Incumbent Democrat Henry M. Jackson successfully ran for re-election to his sixth and final term, defeating Republican challenger Doug Jewett, a Seattle City Attorney and independent King Lysen, a state senator.





== West Virginia ==

Incumbent Democrat Robert Byrd won re-election to a fifth term over Republican Cleve Benedict, a freshman member of the House.

Benedict made great note of Byrd&#x27;s record of high office in the Ku Klux Klan, his avoidance of service in World War II, and the fact that Byrd, then alone among members of Congress, owned no home in the state he represented. His campaign represented the last serious and well-funded effort to unseat Byrd, spending $1,098,218. Byrd was Minority Leader at the time.



== Wisconsin ==

Incumbent Democrat William Proxmire successfully ran for re-election to his fifth and final term, defeating Republican States Representative Scott McCallum.




== Wyoming ==

Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Malcolm Wallop was re-elected to a second term in office, defeating Democratic State Senator Rodger McDaniel.

<text>The Algonquians are one of the most populous and widespread North American indigenous North American groups, consisting of the peoples who speak Algonquian languages. They historically were prominent along the Atlantic Coast and in the interior regions along Saint Lawrence River and around the Great Lakes.

Before contact with Europeans, most Algonquian settlements lived by hunting and fishing, with many of them supplementing their diet by cultivating corn, beans and squash (the &quot;Three Sisters&quot;). The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice.

==Colonial period==

At the time of the first European settlements in North America, Algonquian peoples resided in present-day Canada east of the Rocky Mountains, New England, New Jersey, southeastern New York, Delaware, and down the Atlantic Coast to the Upper South, and around the Great Lakes in present-day Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The precise homeland of the Algonquian peoples is not known. At the time of the European arrival, the hegemonic Iroquois Confederacy, based in present-day New York and Pennsylvania, was regularly at war with their Algonquian neighbors.

==Tribal identity==
The Algonquian peoples include and have included historical populations in:

* Narragansett of Rhode Island, United States
* Mohegan of Connecticut, United States
* Chowanoke, formerly of North Carolina
* Carolina Algonquian
** Roanoke, formerly of North Carolina
*** Croatan, formerly of North Carolina
* Powhatan Confederacy of Virginia
** Pamunkey of Virginia, United States
** Powhatan people of Virginia, United States
* Wampanoag of Massachusetts
**Patuxet, formerly a band of the Wampanoag peoples
* Wabanaki of the Maritime provinces/Atlantic provinces in Canada and New England in the United States
** Abenaki of Quebec, Canada; historically New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont.
** Penobscot of Maine
** Miꞌkmaq of Maine, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Newfoundland
** Passamaquoddy of Maine, United States, and New Brunswick, Canada.
** Maliseet of New Brunswick and Quebec
* Shawnee, formerly of the Ohio River Valley, now Oklahoma
* Central Algonquian peoples
** Kickapoo (Kikapú, Kiikaapoa, Kiikaapoi): originally from southeast Michigan and Wisconsin United States; now in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, United States; Coahuila, Mexico
** Peoria (Illiniwek), formerly Illinois now Oklahoma
** Menominee (kāēyas-mamāceqtaw) of Wisconsin, Upper Michigan, United States
** Anishinaabe, Great Lakes, Subarctic, Northern Plains
*** Ojibwe (including the Saulteaux and Oji-Cree)), Minnesota, North Dakota, and Michigan, United States, as well as Ontario, Canada
*** Potawatomi of Michigan, Indiana, Kansas, Oklahoma, United States; Ontario, Canada
*** Odawa of Michigan and now Oklahoma, United States; Ontario, Canada
*** Mississaugas of Ontario, Canada
*** Nipissing of Ontario, Canada.
*** Algonquin of Ontario and Quebec, Canada 
** Cree of Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and the Northwest Territories, Canada, as well as Montana, United States.

===New England area===
Colonists in the Massachusetts Bay area first encountered the Wampanoag, Massachusett, Nipmuc, Pennacook, Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, and Quinnipiac. The Mohegan, Pequot, Pocumtuc, Podunk, Tunxis, and Narragansett were based in southern New England. The Abenaki were located in northern New England: present-day Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont in what became the United States and eastern Quebec in what became Canada. They traded with French colonists who settled along the Atlantic coast and the Saint Lawrence River. The Mahican were located in western New England in the upper Hudson River Valley (around present-day Albany, New York). These groups cultivated crops, hunted, and fished.

The Algonquians of New England such as the Piscataway (who spoke Eastern Algonquian), practised a seasonal economy. The basic social unit was the village: a few hundred people related by a clan kinship structure. Villages were temporary and mobile. The people moved to locations of greatest natural food supply, often breaking into smaller units or gathering as the circumstances required. This custom resulted in a certain degree of intertribal mobility, especially in troubled times.

In warm weather, they constructed portable wigwams, a type of hut usually with buckskin doors. In the winter, they erected the more substantial longhouses, in which more than one clan could reside. They cached food supplies in more permanent, semi-subterranean structures.

In the spring, when the fish were spawning, they left the winter camps to build villages at coastal locations and waterfalls. In March, they caught smelt in nets and weirs, moving about in birch bark canoes. In April, they netted alewife, sturgeon and salmon. In May, they caught cod with hook and line in the ocean; and trout, smelt, striped bass and flounder in the estuaries and streams. Putting out to sea, they hunted whales, porpoises, walruses and seals. They gathered scallops, mussels, clams and crabs and, in southern New Jersey, harvested clams year-round.

From April through October, natives hunted migratory birds and their eggs: Canada geese, brant, mourning doves and others. In July and August they gathered strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and nuts. In September, they split into small groups and moved up the streams to the forest. There, they hunted beaver, caribou, moose and white-tailed deer.

In December, when the snows began, the people created larger winter camps in sheltered locations, where they built or reconstructed longhouses. February and March were lean times. The tribes in southern New England and other northern latitudes had to rely on cached food. Northerners developed a practice of going hungry for several days at a time. Historians hypothesize that this practice kept the population down, with some invoking Liebig&#x27;s law of the minimum.

The southern Algonquians of New England relied predominantly on slash and burn agriculture. They cleared fields by burning for one or two years of cultivation, after which the village moved to another location. This is the reason the English found the region relatively cleared and ready for planting. By using various kinds of native corn (maize), beans and squash, southern New England natives were able to improve their diet to such a degree that their population increased and they reached a density of 287 people per 100 square miles as opposed to 41 in the north.

Scholars estimate that, by the year 1600, the indigenous population of New England had reached 70,000–100,000.

===Midwest===
The French encountered Algonquian peoples in this area through their trade and limited colonization of New France along the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. The historic peoples of the Illinois Country were the Shawnee, Illiniwek, Kickapoo, Menominee, Miami, Sauk and Meskwaki. The latter were also known as the Sac and Fox, and later known as the Meskwaki Indians, who lived throughout the present-day Midwest of the United States.

During the nineteenth century, many Native Americans from east of the Mississippi River were displaced over great distances through the United States passage and enforcement of Indian removal legislation; they forced the people west of the Mississippi River to what they designated as Indian Territory. After the US extinguished Indian land claims, this area was admitted as the state of Oklahoma in the early 20th century.

===Upper west===
Ojibwe/Chippewa, Odawa, Potawatomi, and a variety of Cree groups lived in Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Western Ontario, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Canadian Prairies. The Arapaho, Blackfoot and Cheyenne developed as indigenous to the Great Plains.

<text>Greenfield is a village in the civil parish of Saddleworth in the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, in Greater Manchester, England. It is east of Oldham and north-east of Manchester. It is located in a broad rural area at the southern edge of the South Pennines; Dovestone Reservoir, Chew Reservoir and Greenfield Reservoir lie to the east of the village in the Peak District National Park.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Greenfield is sited in the Chew Valley, on the main A635 road from Ashton-under-Lyne to Holmfirth.

==History==

A Roman road passes along the Saddleworth hills, from the fort of Ardotalia in Glossop to Castleshaw Roman fort. The route of the Roman road passes through Greenfield and crosses Chew Brook at Packhorse Bridge.

The old stone houses of Saddleworth date from the 17th century and were home to farmers and hand loom weavers in the woollen trade. The first industrial looms were also designed and built in Saddleworth. England&#x27;s highest church &#x27;The Heights&#x27; and canal tunnel &#x27;Standedge Tunnel&#x27; are also here, the latter dating from the end of the 18th century and being a Thomas Telford project.

The world&#x27;s first rock climbers&#x27; sit harness was invented in Saddleworth in the 1970s, variations of it now forming the basis of almost all the world&#x27;s climbing sit harnesses.

The poem &quot;Jone o Grinfilt&quot; was written about a fictional inhabitant of the village with the aim of ridiculing countryside dwellers. The poem was written in the Oldham dialect of English, and was very popular in the 19th century. The author was probably Joseph Lees of Glodwick and it was written in the first decade of the 19th century.

In 1849 the Boarshurst Silver Band was formed as the village band. This brass band is still in existence.website

==Governance==
Greenfield was located in the historic county of the West Riding of Yorkshire and, prior to 1974, was administered by the West Riding County Council. Their administration led to problems; for example, the village was dependent on a fire service based in Holmfirth, despite it being located significantly further away than Oldham. This was particularly problematic in the winter months, as the roads into the village often become blocked or dangerous due to snow and ice, coupled with the village&#x27;s exposed position on the Pennine moorland.

In 1974, governance was transferred to the newly created Greater Manchester County Council. When that body was abolished in 1986, Greenfield moved under the auspices of Oldham Borough Council.

==Geography==

Greenfield is at the western end of the Chew Valley in the south west edge of the South Pennines and is fringed by the Peak District to the east. The village contains four reservoirs, three of which are linked to one another: Greenfield, Yeoman Hey and Dovestones. The fourth is Chew Reservoir at the head of Chew Valley, which is the highest man-made reservoir in England. There is a yachting club on Dovestone Reservoir, the largest of these, and a set of walking paths round the first three. A steep walking path also connects Dovestones to Chew Reservoir. Much of the area covered by the reservoirs lies within the boundary of the Peak District National Park.

Saddleworth Moor rises above Greenfield and leads over impressively barren and disorientating moorlands to Holmfirth. The area includes some of the sites used by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, known as the &#x27;Moors murders&#x27;, to bury their child victims in the early to mid 1960s. The sinister nature of the crimes was the subject of a song by the Smiths in 1984.

Greenfield is also the home of an amateur rugby league side, Saddleworth Rangers, as well as Greenfield Cricket Club and Saddleworth Cricket Club. There are two junior and infant schools, and three churches (one Methodist and two Anglican).

==Landmarks==
Pots and Pans is a locally well-known hill overlooking the village. It is the site of the Saddleworth war memorial (a Grade II listed building), constructed in 1923. Approximately above sea level, it is visible from seven of the ten villages that comprise Saddleworth. A service is held there on Remembrance Sunday each year.

A second line, known as the Micklehurst Line, cut through the village and was mainly used for freight. This closed in 1966 and the viaducts were removed in the mid 1970s; the former route is now occupied, in the main, by a bridleway.

<text>George Croghan (c. 1718 – August 31, 1782) was an Irish-born fur trader in the Ohio Country of North America (current United States) who became a key early figure in the region. In 1746 he was appointed to the Onondaga Council, the governing body of the Iroquois, and remained so until he was banished from the frontier in 1777 during the American Revolutionary War. Emigrating from Ireland to Pennsylvania in 1741, he had become an important trader by going to the villages of Indigenous Peoples, learning their languages and customs, and working on the frontier where previously mostly French had been trading. During and after King George&#x27;s War of the 1740s, he helped negotiate new treaties and alliances for the British with Native Americans.

Croghan was appointed in 1756 as Deputy Indian Agent with chief responsibility for the Ohio region tribes. He assisted Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Northern District, who was based in New York and had strong alliances with the Iroquois. Beginning in the 1740s and following this appointment, Croghan amassed hundreds of thousands of acres of land in today&#x27;s western Pennsylvania and New York by official grants and from Native American purchases. Beginning in 1754, he was a rival of George Washington for influence in Ohio Country and remained far more powerful there for more than 20 additional years. During the American Revolutionary War in 1777, he was falsely accused of treason. He was acquitted the following year but patriot authorities did not allow him back in the Ohio territory.

Ohio&#x27;s recorded history begins with Croghan&#x27;s actions in the mid-1740s as fur trader, Iroquois sachem, and go-between for Pennsylvania, according to historian Alfred A. Cave. Cave concludes that the treason charge that ended Croghan&#x27;s career was trumped up by his enemies. Western Pennsylvania became the focal point in August 1749 when Croghan purchased 200,000 acres from the Iroquois, exclusive of two square miles at the Forks of the Ohio for a British fort. Croghan soon learned that his three deeds would be invalidated if part of Pennsylvania, sabotaged that colony&#x27;s effort to erect the fort, and led the Ohio Confederation to permit Virginia&#x27;s Ohio Company to build it and settle the region. Late in 1753 Virginia sent George Washington to the Ohio Country, who would eventually end Croghan&#x27;s influence there.

Braddock&#x27;s Defeat in 1755 and French control of Ohio Country, which they called the Illinois Country, indicating the area of their greater settlement, found Croghan building forts on the Pennsylvania frontier. Following which he manned the farthest frontier post in present-day New York as Deputy Indian agent under Sir William Johnson, called the &quot;Mohawk Baron&quot; for his extensive landholdings and leadership with the Mohawk and other Iroquois. Croghan briefly lived until 1770 on a quarter of a million New York acres. He resigned as Indian agent in 1771 to establish Vandalia, a fourteenth British colony to include parts of present-day West Virginia, southwestern Pennsylvania, and eastern Kentucky, but continued to serve as a borderland negotiator for Johnson, who died a British loyalist in 1774.

While working to keep the Ohio Indians neutral during the Revolutionary War, Croghan served as Pittsburgh&#x27;s president judge for Virginia and chairman of its Committee of Safety. General Edward Hand, the local military commander, banished Col. Croghan from the frontier in 1777 on suspicion of treason. Despite his acquittal in a November, 1778 trial, Croghan was not allowed to return to the frontier. His death in 1782, shortly after the end of the Revolutionary War, received little if any notice. Although often quoted by historians, the story of Croghan&#x27;s 30 years as the pivotal figure in Ohio Country history is only found in the handful of biographies.

==Early life and career==
Little is known of Croghan&#x27;s early life, including the names of his parents. He was born in Ireland around 1718. The best evidence for Croghan&#x27;s age is found in the treasonous &quot;Filius Gallicae&quot; letters, written early in 1756 by an otherwise anonymous author. &quot;France&#x27;s friend&quot; claimed to be nearly 38 years old, among other self-descriptions that pointed to Croghan, but a secret British investigation exposed the fraud. Croghan testified to his Irish origins in meetings in London in the 1760s. Croghan is a corruption and Anglicization of an older native Irish surname Mac Conchruacha

Apparently Croghan&#x27;s father died young and his widowed mother married again, to Thomas Ward. Croghan emigrated as a young man from Dublin, Ireland to the province of Pennsylvania in 1741. His mother and step-father, his half-brother Edward Ward, and cousin Thomas Smallman also emigrated, the men working for him in America. Among relatives remaining in Ireland were a merchant, Nicholas Croghan (likely a brother of George); an aunt, Mrs. Smallman; and George&#x27;s grandfather Edmund Croghan.

Within a few years Croghan became one of Pennsylvania&#x27;s leading fur traders. A key to his success was establishing trading posts in Native American villages, as the French traders did, and learning their languages and customs. At the time, the usual British practice was to set up a post at a site for their own convenience, generally at a major crossroads, and wait for Native Americans to come to them. Croghan learned at least two Native languages, Delaware (an Algonquian language common to the Lenape of the mid-Atlantic region) and probably Seneca (an Iroquoian language spoken by the westernmost Seneca nation of the Iroquois), whose territory extended into what colonists called Pennsylvania. They also had hunting grounds in the Ohio Valley. These were the languages of the two major nations of Native Americans in the region.

Croghan also learned Native American customs, rapidly adopting the practice of exchanging gifts when he met with the people. He established his first trading base and wintered in a mostly Seneca village at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River on Lake Erie. (This area later developed as Cleveland, Ohio.) During the early years, Croghan&#x27;s primary business partner was William Trent, also a trader. The son of the founder of Trenton, New Jersey, Trent likely supplied capital to acquire trade goods and set up their business.

==Marriages and families==
Croghan married in the 1740s and had a daughter, Susannah Croghan. He later married again, while serving as Deputy Indian agent to Sir William Johnson, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Northern District. His second wife was a Mohawk woman, Catherine (&quot;Takarihoga&quot;), daughter of Mohawk chief Nickus Peters (Karaghaigdatie). Their daughter Catherine (&quot;Adonwentishon&quot;) Croghan (1759-1837) would assume her mother&#x27;s hereditary role as head of the Turtle clan. She later was the third wife of Joseph Brant, the prominent Mohawk war leader who led his people during their migration and settlement in Canada on lands granted by the Crown after the American Revolutionary War. Brant&#x27;s sister Molly was a long-term consort of Sir William Johnson, so Croghan was doubly connected to influential British and Mohawk families in the East. Elizabeth Brant, a daughter of Joseph Brant and Catherine (&quot;Adonwentishon&quot;) Crogan, married William Johnson Kerr, a grandson of Sir William Johnson and Molly Brant.

==King George&#x27;s War, 1744–1748==
Britain&#x27;s blockade of French ports made the few French trade goods reaching Ohio Country prohibitively expensive; this resulted in a bonanza for the Pennsylvania British traders that alarmed the French. They knew that Native American trade and diplomacy were closely linked, and Croghan&#x27;s activities from his base on the Cuyahoga River threatened French influence among the regional natives. As Croghan expanded his trading network westward toward Detroit, then held by the French, they encouraged French-allied Native Americans to attack him.

The British trader quickly took advantage of wartime conditions, establishing new posts at the Wyandot village of Sandusky and the Miami village of Pickawillany, tribes that had previously traded with the French.

His partnership with Trent was temporarily suspended when the latter joined the military to serve in King George&#x27;s War (1744–48). The two men bought property on Conedogwinet Creek in present-day Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. Croghan developed a plantation there which served as his home and base of operations from about 1745 until 1751.

In April 1745 the Seneca protected Croghan from capture, but elsewhere French-allied Natives robbed a canoe-load of Croghan&#x27;s furs. Croghan was adopted by the Seneca and in 1746, according to his testimony before the Lords of Trade in 1764, was one of their hereditary sachems among the 50 chiefs comprising the Six Nations&#x27; Onondaga Council. Already on it was William Johnson, the future British Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Northern District, Croghan&#x27;s superior. Their principal French competitor for influence among the Native Americans in the Ohio region was Philippe-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire, son of the French fur trader Louis-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire (1670–1740), another Seneca appointee to the Onondaga Council two decades earlier. That these men were members of the tribes they represented cannot be overemphasized in understanding their roles in American history.

Early in 1747, Seneca and Wyandot warriors murdered five French traders at the Wyandot village of Sandusky. This was the start of a regional Indian revolt against the French fomented by Croghan. The Wyandot chief Nicholas Orontony led it at first. He was followed by Memeskia (or &quot;Old Briton&quot; as Croghan named him), known by the French as &quot;La Demoiselle&quot;, who was a Piankeshaw Miami chief.

Unsuccessful in driving out the French, the participating bands became more closely aligned with the British. Reports claimed that Croghan had encouraged the uprising so that the Natives would trade with him and not the French. Old Briton relocated to Pickawillany on the Great Miami River, where Croghan built a stockade and trading post.

Aided by local Iroquois chiefs Tanacharison (Half King) and Scarouady sent to oversee the Mingo and dependent Ohio Country nations, Croghan organized the Ohio Confederation of the region&#x27;s tribes in 1748; they lit a &quot;council fire on the Ohio River, independent of the Six Nations.&quot; Greenwood believes this was Croghan&#x27;s initiative, as shown by earlier and subsequent events.

At the same time Croghan brought the Miami into an alliance with Great Britain, formalized in a July, 1748 treaty at Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Andrew Montour, a conference interpreter, became Croghan&#x27;s closest associate until his death in 1772. The other interpreter, Conrad Weiser, had been appointed as British Indian agent for Pennsylvania.

Weiser held a conference in August 1748 at Logstown, on the Ohio River near its confluence in today&#x27;s western Pennsylvania, to inform the recently allied tribes of the Ohio Confederation gathered at their capital that Britain had signed a peace treaty with France ending the war. As a result, the English had no more war supplies for them and he distributed gifts instead. Pennsylvania approved Weiser&#x27;s recommendation that the colony appoint Croghan as its negotiator with the Ohio Country Indians. His success in that role should surprise no one.

The French attacked pro-British tribes left hanging by the peace without arms and ammunition to defend themselves. Celeron de Bienville led a 1749 expedition to claim the Ohio Valley for France and drive out the English traders; Governor James Hamilton (Pennsylvania), sent Croghan to Logstown to investigate. Days before Celeron reached Logstown, its chiefs sold Croghan in the area, excluding at the Forks of the Ohio reserved for construction of a British fort.(A map accompanying the text for the first Pennsylvania Croghan historical marker may be found on the Critical Comments page of the ohiocountry.us website). Biographer Wainwright said gaining this huge amount of land was &quot;a momentous event in his [Croghan&#x27;s] life,&quot; a gross understatement of its impact on history, namely the otherwise unlikely penetration of Virginia into Ohio Country.

Virginia&#x27;s Ohio Company, which acted on behalf of the Commonwealth, sent agents Col. Thomas Cresap and Hugh Parker into the region, who made overtures to the Miami at Pickawillany. In a November,1749 letter to Pennsylvania&#x27;s governor, Croghan offered to oppose them. Not long thereafter he learned that his in Indian grants were against Pennsylvania statutes, as the colony tried to protect the natives, but were permitted in Virginia. By 1750 he and Montour were aiding the Virginia Commonwealth, guiding its scout Christopher Gist on a tour of Ohio Indian villages.

Croghan had already informed Pennsylvania Governor Hamilton that the Ohio Confederation wanted a British fort at the Forks of the Ohio. During a Logstown conference at the end of May 1751, he formally recorded the request and sent Andrew Montour to the Pennsylvania Assembly to confirm it. Montour, however, denied that the Indians wanted a fort, claiming that it was all Croghan&#x27;s idea. The colony&#x27;s plans for a fort evaporated as Pennsylvania &quot;defaulted its leadership in the West to Virginia&#x27;s Ohio Company.&quot;

Croghan protested and among other things had Montour retract his testimony before the Pennsylvania Assembly, but no one believed it. Evidence of the underhanded charade is found in the Native American conference held in June 1752 at Logstown (the Treaty of Logstown), with Croghan serving on the Indian Council and Andrew Montour acting as translator. The Ohio Confederation gave Virginia&#x27;s Ohio Company permission to build a fort and settle one hundred families on in today&#x27;s Western Pennsylvania. Immediately after the conference, a French force led by Charles Langlade made a Raid on Pickawillany, killing a few British traders and 13 Miami, including Old Briton.

Early in the spring of 1753, Canada&#x27;s Governor Duquesne &quot;opened his campaign to drive the English out of the Ohio Valley.&quot; That October during a conference held at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, &quot;Scarouady&quot; officially appointed Croghan as the representative of the Ohio Confederation in communications to and from Pennsylvania, and authorized him to receive its gifts for the tribes. His biographer Wainwright says this suggests that he organized his own appointment.

When the year ended with 21-year-old George Washington making his diplomatic journey to the French at Fort Le Boeuf, Croghan, about 35, had been operating in Ohio Country for twelve years, and was the leading figure among its British traders, Native American tribes and bands, and colonial agents. Soon after Washington returned from delivering Virginia Governor Dinwiddie&#x27;s summons to the French, Croghan was in Ohio Country gathering intelligence for Pennsylvania, helping to build the Ohio Company stockade commanded by William Trent, and supplying the Indians with food, rum, and weapons. When the French reached the Forks of the Ohio early that spring, Croghan&#x27;s half-brother Ensign Edward Ward was in charge of the garrison and forced to surrender.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
The Seven Years&#x27; War (1756-1763) in North America, or French and Indian War as this front was known in the colonies, unofficially began in 1754 with the Battle of Jumonville Glen and effectively ended in 1760 with the British capture of Montreal. French forces occupied the Ohio Country and expelled or arrested British fur traders.

By the end of May, Croghan and Montour were in Winchester, Virginia, where Governor Dinwiddie commissioned them as captains under Col. George Washington. Croghan was to supply flour for the expedition and advise Washington on Indian affairs. Washington alienated his Indian allies during a crucial conference at Gist&#x27;s plantation and blamed Croghan for the subsequent defeat at Fort Necessity. The Half King and Queen Aliquippa took their people to Croghan&#x27;s plantation on Aughwick Creek, seeking refuge. The Half-King became fatally ill and died that October, followed by the Queen in late December.

During the Braddock Expedition in 1755, Croghan, assisted by Montour, led eight Indian scouts, the same group who had been with the Half King at Jumonville Glen a year earlier. General Braddock alienated the other friendly Indians, yet Montour and the handful with Croghan attended the gravely wounded general. Teamsters Daniel Boone and Daniel Morgan fled on horseback as Croghan pressed Braddock to relinquish command and, despite the general&#x27;s refusal, apparently took charge. He got Braddock off the battlefield with the help of Braddock&#x27;s aide, the 23-year-old Washington. Washington&#x27;s account differs and his biographer James Flexner does not mention Croghan being present. Captains Croghan and Montour were there, outranked the General&#x27;s aide, and worked together to save Braddock, with Croghan the more likely leader in the emergency. It was a familiar role, one Croghan assumed on the Pennsylvania frontier a year earlier, and during the almost continuous crises in Ohio Country before and after until 1777.

In 1755, friendly Indians again sought refuge at Augwick. Croghan fortified it as Fort Shirley, one of four forts he built on the frontier. In 1756, he relocated to the western edge of the New York frontier, beginning a 15-year career as Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs under Sir William Johnson. Johnson appointed him to deal with the Susquehanna and Allegheny Indians.

With Montour at his side and in command of 100 Indians on an overlooking hilltop, Croghan witnessed in July 1758 General James Abercrombie&#x27;s calamitous frontal assault on Fort Ticonderoga. Afterward Croghan wrote Johnson that he feared a similar &quot;thrashing&quot; for Gen. John Forbes advance forces nearing Fort Duquesne, unaware that Major James Grant had been defeated five days earlier. Claiming to be one himself, Croghan used his influence on the Indians at Easton, Pennsylvania, where the treaty that stripped the French of their local allies was negotiated, assuring Forbes&#x27; success. He then joined Forbes on November 20 with fifteen Indian scouts in his usual role at the head of the military column, likely the first to see that the French had burned Fort Duquesne to prevent it being used by the British.

Forbes assigned Croghan and Montour to bring in the regional Delaware warriors for a peace treaty with the British. Still under Col. Henry Bouquet&#x27;s command early in 1759, Croghan gathered intelligence about the French force at Venango, &quot;700 troops and about 950 Indians.&quot; About to overwhelm Pittsburgh in July, these French forces were ordered to relieve Fort Niagara, where they were ambushed and defeated by Sir William Johnson. The following year Croghan took part in the Montreal Campaign which resulted with the French capitulation to the British. Soon after Croghan accompanied Major Rogers on an expedition
to Detroit which was also captured.

During 1761 and 1762, Croghan negotiated preliminary treaties with thirteen western tribes on behalf of the British Crown, gaining their acceptance of its assumption of rule in areas ceded by the French. These treaties were formalized in the September 1761 conference at Detroit, which was presided over by Sir William Johnson.

Croghan countered Seneca efforts to enlist the western Indians in an anti-British alliance; as he had in 1748, he organized the western groups into a confederacy independent of the Six Nations.

General Jeffery Amherst did not understand Native American culture, calling the practice of gift giving foolish, akin to bribery. He considered the cost of maintaining peace with the Indians exorbitant, and cut Indian Department expenses to the bone. By stopping gift giving, he insulted the Native Americans. (Croghan covered some expenses and wrote that he served &quot;the King for nothing&quot;). Amherst also severely limited the gunpowder and lead available to the Indians, thinking it would forestall future uprisings. But the friendly Native Americans needed these supplies to hunt and acquire game for survival, as well as to trade the skins and furs for necessities. Amherst ignored Croghan&#x27;s intelligence that as a result, an Indian war was imminent.

The French had released all claims and trade relations to the British in the Treaty of Paris for all lands from the Allegheny to the Ohio River and Mississippi, most of which had already been sparsely settled by the British. After having achieved relatively amicable relations with the French, who had learned about their culture and with whom they had relations for a long time, they resented the patronizing and insulting treatment by Amherst and his officers. They complained he treated them like slaves and dogs. They joined Pontiac&#x27;s War to expel the British from their territory. 

==Pontiac&#x27;s War==
When Indian attacks engulfed Ohio Country in 1763, Croghan was in Philadelphia advising Governor Hamilton on Indian affairs and selling real estate. He galloped to Lancaster where word reached him that his business partner Col. Clapham had been killed in the region&#x27;s initial attack, their Sewickley Creek trading post burned along with Croghan Hall near Pittsburgh, and that Fort Pitt was under siege.

General Amherst in New York ordered Croghan to Fort Pitt to investigate the causes of the uprising and Col. Bouquet to relieve it with a few hundred men. Croghan provided Bouquet with the latest intelligence from Carlisle. At Shippensburg he helped calm fearful residents by recruiting and arming 25 men to garrison Fort Lyttleton, abandoned in 1759. He also hired locals to carry ammunition and supplies from Fort Loudon to Bedford. He reached Bedford on June 12 and, believing further travel west too dangerous, he fed starving families and bolstered the garrison of seven soldiers under Captain Lewis Ourry. A few weeks later Indians attacked fifteen men mowing Croghan&#x27;s fields within a mile of the fort, scalping two. Croghan refused Bouquet&#x27;s order to march with his column when it left Bedford on July 27. Instead on August 2 he set out for Philadelphia to pursue private interests.

Denied leave by General Amherst to travel to London, Croghan resigned as Deputy Indian agent, angering Amherst. The general sailed to London on his own business. Croghan, accompanied by two officers recently besieged in Ft. Detroit and recalled to testify about the Indian uprising, set sail on the &quot;Britannia.&quot; The ship wrecked off the Normandy coast in January 1764. He survived, visiting Normandy historical sites on his journey to Le Havre, where he crossed the Channel to London.

While in London, Croghan was described as &quot;the personification of wealth and power.&quot; The Lords of Trade declined Croghan&#x27;s request to transfer his Indian grant of from the Ohio to the Mohawk River valley, refused to compensate traders for war losses, or to permit an Illinois colony. But the Lords agreed to free the Indian Department from military control and to consider moving the Proclamation Line of 1763, which was intended to prevent westward settlement by British colonists and keep peace with Native Americans, from the Appalachian Mountains to the Ohio River. As the months waiting on the Lords dragged by, a planned trip to Ireland to claim the estate of his grandfather, Edmund Croghan, was put aside, significant for showing that Croghan&#x27;s extreme ethnic pride and possible homesickness were now secondary to his life in America.

Upon Croghan&#x27;s return, Sir William Johnson ordered him to accompany Col. Bouquet&#x27;s expedition against the Ohio tribes, but furnishing newly purchased Monckton Hall near Philadelphia was a higher priority. He assigned the negotiations to his assistant, Alexander McKee. Col. Bouquet, traveling east after his victorious 1764 Ohio campaign, was outraged to learn in a letter from Croghan to McKee that the Indian Department was now independent of local military control. Further incensed when the report was confirmed, Bouquet called Croghan &quot;illiterate, imprudent [or &quot;impudent,&quot; sources vary], and ill bred&quot; in a letter to British General Thomas Gage complaining of the agent. Although Bouquet soon recanted, saying that Croghan was the best person to pacify Illinois Country, his ill-considered and untrue characterization of Croghan has endured.

From 1764 onward, despite continual provocations, the tribes were kept at peace on the frontier, largely due to the herculean efforts of Croghan. The exceptions were isolated incidents and Dunmore&#x27;s War in 1774 on the Shawnee, when the former Indian agent worked to keep the Delaware and other Indian nations neutral.

Seen as a 1765 prelude to the Revolutionary War, Croghan&#x27;s first shipment of Indian presents and trade goods to Pittsburgh provoked armed rebellion by frontiersmen led by James Smith. Played by John Wayne in Hollywood&#x27;s 1939 version of the incident, Allegheny Uprising, Smith&#x27;s hatred of Indians was long standing. At nineteen, as a captive in Fort Duquesne, Smith was traumatized by the screams of Braddock&#x27;s captured soldiers being slowly tortured to death by Indian allies of the French. There were two justifications for leading the Black Boys in the attack on the British convoy, burning most of Croghan&#x27;s gifts, and threatening his life if he ever returned to Cumberland County. Pennsylvania had proscribed trade with the Ohio Indians before a peace was established under a new treaty and as a Crown Indian agent, Croghan was prohibited from engaging in Indian trade. Without the trade and gifts, no peace treaty was possible and Croghan was quick to point out the threat to British rule.

Despite Black Boy opposition, Croghan accumulated enough goods to open trade with the Ohio Indians in Pittsburgh; he set off for Illinois Country. His party was attacked near the mouth of the Wabash River by eighty Kickapoo and Mascouten warriors. Two of Croghan&#x27;s men and three Indians were killed, Croghan tomahawked, the camp plundered and the survivors marched to Vincennes and eventually Ouiatenon. In a conference on July 13, Croghan reconciled the Ottawa, Piankashaw, Miami, Ouiatenon, Mascouten, and Kickapoo Indians to British rule, a peace confirmed shortly afterward in a grand council that included Chief Pontiac. The principals journeyed to Detroit, where Croghan conducted an even larger conference that brought the Potawatomi, Ojibway, Wyandot, and Wea tribes into the British economic orbit, with Pontiac &quot;playing an important part in the proceedings.&quot; At the time, Croghan was celebrated as a national hero for negotiating with Pontiac and ending the Indian war.

Croghan led a group of speculators, including Benjamin Franklin and his son William Franklin, in pursuing land in the Ohio Country, the Illinois Country, and New York. On September 6, 1765, Croghan was awarded a grant of .

By Spring 1766 Croghan resumed his mission to the Illinois tribes on the Mississippi. Seventeen bateaux left Pittsburgh on June 18, one carrying Croghan and his party, another carrying Captain Harry Gordon and Ensign Thomas Hutchins on a river mapping expedition, two carrying provisions for Fort Chartres, and thirteen carrying Baynton, Wharton, and Morgan trade goods. They traveled north from the Ohio River on the Mississippi to reach the former colonial French settlement of Fort Chartres. During his August conferences there, Croghan successfully negotiated with 22 tribes, soon augmented by three Indian nations under French influence. Weak from malaria, Croghan accompanied Gordon and Hutchins to New Orleans. From there he sailed for New York with stops at Mobile, Pensacola, Havana, and Charleston.

==Later life==
His ship reached New York on January 10, 1767, and two days later Croghan joined Samuel Wharton in urging Gen. Gage to establish an Illinois colony. When Gage refused, Croghan publicly resigned as Deputy Indian agent. Laid low by illness, he spent February recuperating at Monckton Hall near Philadelphia. In March he went to New York to visit with Sir William Johnson, who convinced him to withdraw his resignation. Sent to Fort Pitt in May, Croghan defused an Indian war over squatters and illegal trade. Governor John Penn detained Croghan in Philadelphia on his return east, with questions about the Indians to accompany the survey of borders between the colonies by Mason and Dixon, to settle the borders of Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Virginia (now West Virginia). He said of Croghan: &quot;It would be very difficult to manage this business without his assistance.&quot; The Indians halted the survey before it was completed, in what was a vain attempt by Croghan to protect his 1749 grant by the Seneca for 200,000 acres from being included in Pennsylvania.

A hard year for Croghan&#x27;s Indian diplomacy followed: the Black Boys&#x27; pledged in March to kill Croghan on his way to an Indian conference in Pittsburgh, and hostile Lord Hillsborough was appointed in London to the government portfolio for American affairs. Croghan established a quiet retreat at his large parcel of land at Lake Otsego. Its outlet is the headwater of the Susquehanna River. He built a six-chimney &quot;hutt&quot; and had Croghan Forest&#x27;s surveyed in September 1768 prior to final discussions by Sir Johnson with the Six Nations of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix.

As noted above, before completion of the Fort Stanwix Treaty in November 1768, the Six Nations sold Croghan in New York bordering Lake Otsego, plus numerous tracts for his friends. At the large conference, attended by more than 3100 Iroquois, the Six Nations demanded (on his part) that the Crown recognize these and other pre-treaty sales. They also asked that a grant by them of on the Ohio to Trent and his associates be made part of the treaty. Third, they wanted to ensure that should Pennsylvania seize the which the Indians had granted to Croghan at the Forks of the Ohio, they requested that the Crown grant Croghan as much land elsewhere. Sir William Johnson was censured by the Crown for aiding Croghan&#x27;s private land dealings, and the government refused to ratify these private requests.

Facing bankruptcy, Croghan &quot;drew bills payable on Samuel Wharton in London&quot; for thousands of pounds in order to patent his New York land. Crippled with gout and hounded by creditors, Croghan sought refuge in Croghan Forest, which totaled more than . Its remote setting did not protect him when the Wharton bills were returned for nonpayment in February 1770.

Croghan Hall gave the ailing Croghan a refuge from lawsuits and debtors&#x27; prison, but he could do little more than watch as settlers poured into the Ohio Country on land he considered to be his. Pennsylvania appointed officials for newly established Bedford County in 1771.

Among those buying land from Croghan&#x27;s 1749 Indian grant was George Washington through his agent William Crawford.[13] &quot;I am likely to sell another tract to Coll. Washington and his friends,&quot; Croghan wrote to Joseph Wharton, Jr. and to Michael Gratz, &quot;I have sold a parcel of lands to Coll Washington,&quot;[14], but there were no further sales to him beyond in today&#x27;s Perryopolis, Pennsylvania. Crawford surveyed land near Chartiers Creek for Washington that Croghan claimed when his survey of an Indian deed fell far short of the called for and he had it redone. More than twenty years later, in 1784, Washington won a court case against Chartiers Creek families who had bought their land from Croghan. Washington&#x27;s document was dated July 5, 1775, two years after his land dispute with Croghan began.[15] It was made out by Lord Dunmore aboard a British warship on the James River, signed a few days after Washington had assumed command of the Continental army besieging Boston.[16]

Croghan&#x27;s luck appeared to change when the Crown agreed to a new inland colony, Vandalia, appointing him as Indian agent and its largest land owner. Crown agents were restricted from forming such ventures, however, so Croghan resigned from the Indian Department on November 2, 1771. Alexander McKee took his place as deputy agent, with Croghan &quot;on call when Indian affairs were critical.&quot; He took his cousin Thomas Smallman into a fur trading partnership and Croghan &quot;made a major effort to liquidate his debts.&quot;

Although failing to sell any of his New York acres, Barnard and Michael Gratz remained Croghan&#x27;s agents, creditors, primary suppliers and friends. He felt great sorrow at the loss of his friend Andrew Montour, murdered in January 1772. The British abandoned Fort Pitt that fall, and Croghan had McKee tell the Indians that it was done to please them. 1772 ended with &quot;the news that the Privy Council had overruled Lord Hillsborough and approved Vandalia.&quot;

A year passed with Vandalia still in limbo. Croghan borrowed money and pawned his plate (silver), spending £1,365 for provisions and gifts for 400 Indians who attended his November conference regarding the proposed colony. &quot;Convinced that the powerful Vandalia project had fallen through, Lord Dunmore, governor of Virginia, decided to make good his colony&#x27;s western claims. Presumably, when Dunmore visited Pittsburgh in the summer of 1773, he met Croghan, for he agreed to recognize the validity of Croghan&#x27;s Indian grant.&quot; Dunmore appointed an associate and nephew of Croghan as his western agent. Dr. John Connolly, fully supported by Croghan, &quot;claimed Pittsburgh for Virginia in January, 1774, and called up the militia. The first men to appear at the parade ground for the initial muster came from Croghan Hall.&quot; Virginia&#x27;s claim was opposed by Pennsylvania&#x27;s General Arthur St. Clair, the colony&#x27;s chief official west of the Alleghenies.

==Dunmore&#x27;s War==
Dunmore&#x27;s War broke out in the Pennsylvania area in the spring of 1774, when frontiersmen led by Michael Cresap killed two Shawnee warriors, and Daniel Greathouse led other pioneers to kill the family of Logan, old Shikallamy&#x27;s son. Croghan kept the Seneca and Delaware neutral, but his cooperation with St. Clair in defending the frontier prompted Connolly to accuse him of deserting Virginia. Shawnee chief Cornstalk, not wanting war, had three chiefs escort the traders from his villages to Croghan Hall. Connolly ordered 40 militiamen to capture or kill the Indians and they succeeded in shooting one of the Shawnee chiefs after they had escaped across the Allegheny. St. Clair, echoing other Pennsylvanians, said that Croghan was &quot;indefatigable in endeavoring to make up the breeches.&quot;

That August deputies of the Six Nation brought the news of Sir William Johnson&#x27;s death. He had died in July, the day before a sheriff&#x27;s sale put over of Croghan&#x27;s New York land on the auction block. Bids totaled £4,840 despite the pall Johnson&#x27;s death cast over the proceedings. Many of the bids were never paid and the sheriff absconded with most of the money collected, leaving only £900 for Croghan. He raised $6,000 in Virginia to buy directly from the Iroquois on the eastern bank of the Allegheny River. Samuel Wharton sent encouraging news about Vandalia, including the arrival of a large shipment of goods for gifts to the Indians and land payments, temporarily stored at Georgetown because of Dunmore&#x27;s War.

Governor Dunmore reached Pittsburgh in September, pausing in his campaign against the Shawnee to grill Croghan concerning &quot;Connolly&#x27;s accusations about inciting the Shawnees to attack Virginia and siding with Pennsylvania against Virginia. Croghan easily disproved the charges and was reinstated in Dunmore&#x27;s good graces.&quot; After bringing his war to a successful close that fall, Dunmore left 75 militia under Connolly to garrison Fort Pitt, renamed Fort Dunmore. The Virginia governor also adjourned the Augusta county court from Staunton to Pittsburgh, where he appointed Croghan to serve as president judge.

==American Revolution==
Croghan chaired Pittsburgh&#x27;s committee of correspondence, formed in May 1775 after the battles of Lexington and Concord. The next month, Croghan was hosting a conference with Indians to ratify the Treaty of Camp Charlotte when Connolly was arrested by Pennsylvanians and imprisoned at Hannastown. Croghan and his committee secured Connolly’s release and Connolly subsequently left the frontier to join Lord Dunmore aboard a British man-of-war.

On July 10, 1775, Croghan purchased from the Six Nations between the Allegheny and Beaver rivers. Two days later, Congress established an Indian Department and appointed trader Richard Butler as its Pittsburgh agent. When Butler retired in April 1776, Croghan lobbied for his position. But, George Morgan was chosen as Indian agent and, still resentful for the failed Illinois trading venture a decade earlier, &quot;had absolutely no use for Croghan.&quot;

During the summer of 1777, Croghan visited Williamsburg, Virginia, at the expense of the Gratz brothers to obtain a clear title to land he had sold them. After conferring with Governor Patrick Henry about frontier defenses, he returned to Pittsburgh with dispatches for General Edward Hand, who greeted him with suspicion. What was believed to be a Loyalist conspiracy had been uncovered. Colonel George Morgan, the Indian agent, Alexander McKee; Simon Girty, and others were under arrest. General Hand examined Thomas Smallman&#x27;s papers and although there was nothing to indicate Croghan was disloyal, Hand ordered him to Philadelphia.

Two weeks after he reached the city, it was captured by the British. Croghan, too ill with gout to escape, was hauled before General Howe and castigated for chairing Pittsburgh&#x27;s Committee of Safety and keeping the Lake Indians neutral. Ordered to take lodgings in town, where he was kept under constant supervision by two British officers, Croghan learned that Monckton Hall was burnt after the battle of Germantown, &quot;another severe financial blow.&quot; When the British evacuated Philadelphia in June 1778, they left Croghan behind on parole. Returning Pennsylvania officials accused him of collaborating with the enemy, but Croghan was acquitted in a November 12, 1778, trial.

General Hand refused to let him return to Croghan Hall in western Pennsylvania, and Croghan spent the next two winters in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In an effort to pay off debts, Croghan mortgaged Croghan Hall to Joseph Simon. He deeded of his Indian grant to the Gratzes, who paid his bills and financed another trip to Williamsburg to seek to have his Indian titles recognized by the state of Virginia, without success. Bedridden with gout upon his return, Croghan wrote few letters to family and friends. In May 1780, he moved to Philadelphia, where he learned his western properties were within the boundaries of the new state of Pennsylvania.

Croghan died at his home in Passyunk Township, on August 31, 1782. By then he was such an obscure figure that his death was not reported in newspapers. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. The marker on his grave was deteriorated by the elements, and the location was unmarked for many years.

==Croghan&#x27;s estate==

While the total value of his personal estate was valued at only £50 13s.6d, his extensive land holdings were &quot;conservatively estimated at £140,000.&quot; Except for some specific bequests, his June 12, 1782, will left his entire estate to his daughter Susannah. Susannah Croghan Prevost died in 1790, survived by six of her twelve children. For decades, they pursued their claims to Croghan&#x27;s often clouded deeds in numerous lawsuits. &quot;For some years, the hopeless involvements of his estate kept courtrooms abuzz, and, when that ceased and his contemporaries died off, the man&#x27;s name and fame faded away into the obscurity from which he had emerged.&quot;

Since the late 20th century, historians have re-evaluated Croghan&#x27;s role and begun to assert his importance in the Ohio Country. He was a flamboyant character like William Johnson, brash and grasping, but also with a talent for diplomacy and relations with the Native Americans.

History continues to be made by Croghan descendants. To this day the female line of Croghan&#x27;s Mohawk daughter Catherine are inheritors of her position and power in the Turtle Clan. &quot;Catharine Adonwentishon was head of the Turtle clan, the first in rank in the Mohawk Nation. Her birthright was to name the Tekarihoga, the principal sachem of the Mohawk nation.&quot;[80]

Speculation in western New York lands and clouded titles resulted in many unscrupulous transactions. In 1786 William Cooper and his partner Andrew Craig &quot;by questionable methods . . . purchased the Otsego lands [40,000 of Croghan&#x27;s acres] for only £2,700.&quot; Cooper laid out the town of Cooperstown, New York, and built his mansion, Otsego Hall, on the former site of Croghan&#x27;s residence. William Franklin and the Prevost heirs watched bitterly as the property increased in value twentyfold. &quot;Andrew Prevost, Jr., wrote Franklin on December 12, 1812: &#x27;We have lost an immense property from the infamous advantage taken by Cooper and others without your knowledge by a forced Sale under your Title.&#x27;&quot; William Cooper&#x27;s son, the author James Fenimore Cooper, presented his family&#x27;s side of the dispute in his &quot;Chronicles of Cooperstown&quot; (1838).

==Pronunciation of name==
There has been disagreement as to how to pronounce Croghan&#x27;s name. The governor of Canada, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, in a letter to the Minister of France on August 8, 1756, referred to “George Craon’s fort”, which appears to be a phonetic spelling. Although biographer Robert. G. Crist concludes that, given the Gaelic origins of the surname, the pronunciation was “Crone,&quot; his evidence is less than conclusive: a financial account that one of Croghan&#x27;s clerks labeled as &quot;Crohan and Trent;&quot; and &quot;a Frenchman who recorded his name as &quot;Croan,&quot; apparently the way it sounded. Descendants have used the hard &quot;g&quot; pronunciation favored by Croghan scholar Margaret Pearson Bothwell, but Crist dismisses them and &quot;the practice in Ireland today,&quot; where the name is pronounced &quot;CROG-han.&quot; &quot;CRO-ghan&quot; seems to be the standard English pronunciation. Crist cites Nicholas B. Wainwright&#x27;s &quot;Crowan&quot; as an intermediate step between &quot;something like &#x27;Crohan,&#x27; and in further simplification, &#x27;Crone.&#x27;&quot; A study of Crogan&#x27;s dialect by Michael Montgomery, a linguist specializing in Irish, written more than thirty years after Crist, does not find the name pronunciation dispute worth mentioning.

<doc id="1106309" wikidata="Q4346145" url="?curid=1106309" title="British Home Stores">
<text>British Home Stores, commonly abbreviated to BHS and latterly legally styled BHS Ltd, is an online store and formerly a British department store chain, primarily selling clothing and household items. In its later years, the company began to expand into furniture, electronics, entertainment, convenience groceries and fragrance and beauty products. BHS traded from 1928 to 2016; the brand was later licenced to an online retailer.

The company was founded in 1928 by a group of U.S. entrepreneurs, and had a total of 163 stores, mainly in high streets or shopping centres, by the time of its closure in 2016, as well as 74 overseas stores in 18 territories.

BHS was previously a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, but was bought by Sir Philip Green in 2000 and taken private. The company became part of Green&#x27;s Arcadia Group in 2009. Following a number of loss-making years, the company was sold to the consortium Retail Acquisitions Ltd, led by the serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell, in March 2015 for the nominal price of £1. In April 2016, 13 months after the purchase by Retail Acquisitions, the company entered administration following unsuccessful attempts to continue trading. It was eventually wound down, and all stores were closed by late August 2016 following failed attempts to find a buyer.

In July 2016, a committee of the UK parliament issued a report titled &quot;Leadership failures and personal greed led to collapse of BHS&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported &quot;Sir Philip Green&#x27;s reputation ripped apart in damning report on BHS demise. MPs say retailer’s former owners subjected it to &#x27;systematic plunder&#x27; and describe the collapse as &#x27;unacceptable face of capitalism&#x27;&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===
British Home Stores was founded in 1928 by a group of U.S. entrepreneurs who wanted to follow the successful model set by Woolworths. They did not want go into direct competition with Woolworths, so set their highest price at a shilling. The first store opened in Brixton, and by 1929 the price limit had been lifted to five shillings to allow the business to offer more goods.

The business expanded by opening further branches, all offering small cafeterias and grocery departments, and in 1933 the business went public. After the war, the business continued to grow, and by the end of the 1960s had 94 stores nationwide.

===Expansion===

The company expanded in the 1970s and 1980s, including the opening of stores in the newly developing wave of indoor shopping centres (such as Broadway Shopping Centre and Lakeside Shopping Centre). A joint venture was launched with supermarket retailer Sainsbury&#x27;s to create hypermarkets using the SavaCentre brand. Sainsbury&#x27;s took full control of SavaCentre in 1989, and later converted the stores to the Sainsbury&#x27;s branding.

A downturn in business in the early 1980s was fought with a revamp of the stores and the selling of goods with higher profit margins. The company closed its only overseas store, in Dublin, Ireland, during this time (although there was a rapidly aborted re-entry in 1996 via a franchise store in Dublin&#x27;s Jervis Centre). In 1985, the first overseas franchise store opened in Gibraltar. Such stores, not directly owned by the BHS company itself, have operated over Europe and the Middle East.

In 1986, BHS merged with Habitat and Mothercare to form Storehouse plc. Soon afterwards, the British Home Stores registered company name and branding across its shops was replaced with &quot;BhS&quot; (later &quot;Bhs&quot;, and since reverted to the all-caps &quot;BHS&quot;, which the company used in addition to the full British Home Stores name prior to the full rebrand) and a new corporate logo. The exception was in stores that displayed a &quot;historic&quot; fascia, such as that in Edinburgh&#x27;s Princes Street, which continued to feature the British Home Stores name in its original Roman type etched into the granite shop front.

British Home Stores, like many other major retailers, followed a trend of opening stores at out-of-town locations since the 1980s. One of these was the two-level store at Merry Hill Shopping Centre in the West Midlands (which formed part of an Enterprise Zone). This store opened on 14 November 1989, ultimately replacing the store in nearby Dudley, which closed in June 1990 after a directly related sharp fall in turnover. The nearby West Bromwich store closed around the same time, its fortunes also affected by the Merry Hill development and smaller developments around nearby Oldbury, which had begun with the SavaCentre hypermarket in 1980.

===Takeover by Philip Green===
In the mid-1990s, the brand saw a further reinvention under guidance from retail design house &#x27;20:20&#x27;. The new look was showcased with the launch of the &quot;millennium concept&quot; shopfit, initially at the Grafton Centre, Cambridge during 1995. With its softer &quot;Bhs&quot; &quot;signature&quot; logo and warm interior lighting, the concept attempted with varying degrees of success to meet the needs of the modern, more sophisticated shopper. During the late 1990s, the stores which formed Storehouse Plc fell on hard times; BHS and Mothercare were the worst affected. Following a number of years of tough trading, Philip Green bought BHS from Storehouse Plc in May 2000 for £200 million. He then changed the company from public (Plc) to private (Ltd). In 2002, Green went on to acquire the Arcadia Group of high street retailers, which included Topshop, Burton, Evans, Dorothy Perkins and Wallis among others, to form Britain&#x27;s second largest clothes retailer, after Marks and Spencer. Alan Smith, chairman of Storehouse at the time of the Bhs sale, commented, &quot;He [Philip Green] had a crystal-clear vision and strategy. He had the guts to do the deal, to make it work when nobody else thought he could.&quot;

===Return to British Home Stores===
In May 2005, Green, owner of BHS, purchased Etam UK from its French owner, Etam Développement. The Etam UK brands included Etam, Amelie May, and Tammy. The girls&#x27; fashion retailer Tammy was the strongest brand in terms of sales and consumer recognition. For this reason, and to help improve girls&#x27; perception of BHS as a whole, from September 2005 stand-alone stores were closed and the brand integrated into BHS stores.
In 2005, BHS resurrected its British Home Stores fascia, more than 20 years after it had disappeared from the UK high street. The move followed the purchase of several former Allders at Home sites from the department store chain. These projects were designed to build upon the success of the homewares and lighting that BHS stores currently offered and to tap into new areas of business such as furniture, curtains, rugs, and wall art. Brands sold included Denby, Maxwell Williams, Typhoon, Brabantia, Terence Conran and Jasper Conran.

In 2005, Green&#x27;s wife, a Monaco resident, received a £1.2 billion dividend from Arcadia.

On 27 February 2009, it was announced that the company would be integrated into the Arcadia Group. Central support functions were merged and selected BHS stores housed selected Arcadia brands; for example, in July 2009, BHS stores in Solihull in the West Midlands and Bexleyheath in South London both opened Evans and Wallis concessions. In August 2009, the Canterbury branch opened Wallis and Evans concessions within the store. Other stores with Arcadia insertions included Tunbridge Wells, Oxford, Peterborough, Watford, Kilmarnock, Nottingham, Camberley, Norwich and Aberdeen.

===Leadership changes===

Mike Goring was appointed managing director to the chain in May 2009, and in July, Jacquie Gray was appointed Creative Director. In 2010, BHS changed its logo, resurrecting the uppercase form of the abbreviation that had not been used since the Storehouse rebrand and the later rebrand in the 1990s. A new e-commerce website was launched, and a new store design was gradually introduced across the estate.

Goring left BHS in 2012 to take up the position of Retail Director for Debenhams. After he left, former Marks and Spencer Menswear Trading Director, Richard Price was appointed managing director. Gray left in 2014.

In January 2015, Green confirmed that he was considering selling the company following sustained losses, and that he had received a number of approaches.

===Sale and restructuring===
On 12 March 2015, it was announced that BHS had been sold to Retail Acquisitions for a nominal price of £1. It was also confirmed that Richard Price had left his post as managing director for a position with the clothing arm of Tesco; former BHS Chief Operating Officer Darren Topp was confirmed as the interim Chief Executive. Shortly after the takeover, 51 of the company&#x27;s 171 stores were reported as being under threat of closure.
In September 2015, BHS owners Retail Acquisitions announced another rebrand, as part of a £60m rejuvenation plan, which resulted in the full British Home Stores name being resurrected on the high street for the first time since 1986. A programme of modernising stores with the new branding was announced, while plans to roll out food halls were to continue.

By early 2016, periodic store closures had seen the company withdraw entirely from several city centres including Bath, Cardiff, Carlisle, Oxford, Reading and Southampton. Plans were also being made to reduce the size of the flagship Oxford Street branch by leasing excess space to other retailers.

In March 2016, the company sought a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to allow it to restructure the business. As part of its application, it revealed a deficit in its pension scheme of £207 million, and sought to transfer its schemes to the Pension Protection Fund. A consortium led by the banker Nicholas de Scossa was involved in negotiations to buy the company.

===Administration and closure===

On 24 April 2016, Dominic Chappell (owner of Retail Acquisitions) announced that administrators would be appointed the next day. It was announced that the chain had entered administration on 25 April 2016, putting 11,000 jobs at risk. Duff &amp; Phelps were appointed administrators and sought to sell the business as a going concern. It at this point had debts of £1.3 billion including £571 million in pension liabilities, meaning either individual assets (such as stores) would have to be sold or the chain would be in new ownership. UK sports chain Sports Direct was reported to be in talks to buy a number of BHS stores, but no buyer was found for the company, resulting in the closure of BHS stores. Head office staff were made redundant on the announcement that no buyer had been found, with stores expected to last up to 8 weeks selling the remaining stock. On 23 July 2016, the administrators Duff and Phelps shut 20 stores, and the next week another 30. Closure of the final outlets was on 28 August 2016. The insolvent part of the company finally went into liquidation on 2 December 2016, with the remainder of winding up proceedings commencing on that date.
The Qatari Al Mana Group purchased the company&#x27;s international franchise stores and online operations in June 2016. The group formed a new business, BHS International (UK) Limited, based in London. It launched a website, bhs.com, under the new brand name &quot;The British Home Store&quot; in September 2016. Al Mana announced that the website would close by 27 June 2018, shifting focus to their international franchise business.

In June 2024, the High Court ordered two former directors of the company, Lennart Hennington and Dominic Chandler, to pay £18m, made up of £13m for wrongful trading, and £5m for breach of corporate duties. This was as a result of legal action brought by the liquidator on behalf of the creditors. A further hearing is due in June 2024, at which a final decision will be made on the total amount to be paid by the two men.

=== Successor ===
, the bhs.com website is operated by Litecraft Group Limited, using the BHS logo and &quot;BRITISHOMESTORE LONDON 1928&quot; brand name under licence. The website sells lighting and selected homewares.

==Products==

=== Clothing ===
In December 2014, New Zealand-based childrenswear brand Pumpkin Patch was introduced into larger stores and online.

===Furniture===
The company had an independent furniture website, bhsfurniture.co.uk.

The stores and website sold a number of leading brands including Italsofa, G-Plan, Relyon and Silentnight. Larger homes stores, such as the Barton Square branch in the Trafford Centre, Greater Manchester, also sold the Welle cabinet range and had Sharps showrooms.

===Electrical goods===
In its stores, BHS sold a mixture of basic electricals based primarily on kitchen products such as kettles and toasters. Latterly the range had begun to increase, particularly in the designated Home stores and larger high street branches. Ranges introduced included Breville, Russell Hobbs, De&#x27;Longhi and Vax. In addition, BHS began to sell larger electrical items through a separate website, bhsdirect.co.uk. The service was run through a third-party company, Buy it Direct, and was not directly controlled by BHS. This allowed the company to expand its product range to laptops, tablets, large kitchen appliances such as fridge-freezers, TVs and air-conditioners.

===Food store===

In January 2014, it was announced that the chain would sell branded food products; the service was to be trialled in 50 stores with the intention of making this a permanent addition in up to 150 stores. The first of three trial stores opened in Staines in March 2014, and was shortly followed by another in Warrington and a third in Romford.

==International franchises==
The BHS brand has been franchised since 1985 to stores around the world and, although they are not directly owned, products and support were supplied by BHS. The Tammy brand was available as a separate franchise. In early 2006 a new franchise, &quot;Bhs Kids&quot;, was launched in the Middle East, carrying many best-selling children&#x27;s lines from BHS stores.

In 1995, BHS was the first high street retailer to open a branch in Moscow. The £3 million venture was the largest in the international portfolio and was quickly followed by the opening of a second store in St Petersburg. Further stores opened in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in 1998, and there were stores in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Dubai, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi. By 2000 the chain also had stores in Greece, Tenerife, Gibraltar, Malta and the Far East. In 2011, a store in Armenia opened. In 2013, a franchised concession opened in the Falkland Islands and a store was opened in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

<text>George Croghan (November 15, 1791 – January 8, 1849) was an American soldier who was a recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal.

==Early life==
Croghan was born at the Locust Grove farm in what is now Louisville, Kentucky. He was a son of Lucy ( Clark) Croghan (1765–1838) and William Croghan (1752–1822), from Dublin, Ireland who he had served in the Revolutionary War at the battles of Brandywine and Monmouth. Among his maternal uncles were Capt. William Clark and Gen. George Rogers Clark. 

Croghan studied at the College of William and Mary, graduating in 1810.

==Career==
After he graduated from William and Mary, Croghan joined the U.S. Army. He fought at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. He also served at Fort Meigs (modern Perrysburg, Ohio) with distinction. For his defense with a small garrison against a British attack during the Battle of Fort Stephenson, Ohio, in 1813 during the War of 1812, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He later led a troop that was defeated in the Battle of Mackinac Island.

Following the war, Croghan resigned from the army during a reduction in force and was appointed as a postmaster in New Orleans. In 1825, he became one of the two inspector generals in the army. During the Mexican–American War Croghan fought as a colonel at Monterrey.

==Personal life==
Croghan married Serena Eliza Livingston (1795–1884), a daughter of John R. Livingston and Margaret ( Sheafe) Livingston. Serena was a granddaughter of Robert Livingston (1718–1775) of Clermont Manor in New York. Together, they were the parents of:

* Mary Angelica Croghan (1819–1906), who married the Rev. Christopher Billop Wyatt, a grandson of Christopher Billop, in 1848.
* St. George Louis Livingston Croghan (1823–1861), who married Cornelia Adelaide Ridgely, daughter of Commodore Charles C. Ridgely (son of Gov. Charles C. Ridgely) and Cornelia Louisiana ( Livingston) Ridgely (daughter of Robert L. Livingston and granddaughter of Walter Livingston), in 1846.
* Serena Livingston Croghan (1833–1926), who married Augustus Frederick Rodgers.

Croghan died in New Orleans, Louisiana during the cholera epidemic of 1849, which had high mortality rates. He was buried at the site of Fort Stephenson, in what is now Fremont, Ohio.

===Legacy and honors===
Croghan&#x27;s tomb and a soldiers&#x27; memorial to the war installed by the DAR in 1903 are both located on the library grounds near Croghan Street, which was renamed in his honor.

The village and town of Croghan, New York are also named after him.

<doc id="1106313" wikidata="Q5166675" url="?curid=1106313" title="Convoy rescue ship">
<text>During the Second World War, designated convoy rescue ships accompanied some Atlantic convoys to rescue survivors from ships that had been attacked. Rescue ships were typically small freighters with passenger accommodation converted to rescue service. This involved enlarging galley and food storage areas and providing berthing and sanitary facilities for approximately 150 men. Preparation for service included the installation of scrambling nets along the sides, and the substitution of boats suitable for open sea work for normal lifeboats. Rescue ships normally included a small operating room for an embarked naval doctor and sick bay staff.

==Service==

The first specially equipped rescue ship went into service in January 1941. When rescue ships were unavailable, large, ocean-going tugboats or converted trawlers were sometimes designated to perform rescue duty.

By the end of the war 30 rescue ships had been built or converted. They participated in 797 convoys and rescued 4,194 survivors from 119 ships. Seven rescue ships were lost, six to enemy action (three to U-boats and three to aircraft).

==Origins==

In 1940 Admiral Sir Max Horton (later Commander-in-Chief Western Approaches Command) broached the idea of rescue ships with the Admiralty. The concept was to have merchant vessels that would accompany convoys but not carry cargo; they would instead have the role of saving the lives of seamen from ships sunk by enemy action. The rescue ship would take its position at the rear of one of the central columns of ships. From this position it could observe damaged ships falling astern of the convoy and quickly rendezvous to transfer survivors. The rescue ships would also be able to provide surgical or other treatment as required. This would free the cargo vessels of the convoy to continue on their way and escorts to focus on countering the attacking U-boats or aircraft.

The convoy rescue ship was a response to early experience. Each merchant ship in a convoy was assigned a station so that the convoy formation would consist of several columns of three to five ships. The lead ships of the columns were spaced at intervals of 1,000 yards (910 m) along a line perpendicular to the convoy course. Each ship in the column followed the ship ahead at a distance of . The typical convoy would be approximately wide and long. The rescue plan for early convoys was to have the last ship of each column rescue survivors of other ships in that column. If the last ship in column was hit, the rescue task fell to the escorting warships. In practice, the escorting warships performed rescue tasks more often than the 25% suggested by random hits on a four-ship column because some merchant ships refused to leave the protection of the convoy formation to fall back and remain a stationary target while rescuing survivors. Furthermore, merchant ships were not well suited to manoeuvre to pick up survivors, and those attempting rescue were hampered by lack of suitable rescue equipment.

For the role the Admiralty sought out small, quick, manoeuvrable vessels; it drew many from among the Clyde Shipping Company&#x27;s coastal passenger transports. The requisitioned passenger ships had a speed of 11 to 12 knots, which enabled them, after completing their rescue operations, to catch up with the convoys travelling at 10 knots. Although these vessels had not been built for the Atlantic or the Arctic, none was lost to Atlantic storms; one did ice-up and founder off the coast of Newfoundland.

The rescue ships were not hospital ships and so were legitimate targets as far as German submarines or bombers were concerned. Consequently, the Admiralty armed them with AA guns for protection when they were separated from the convoy and vulnerable to enemy attack. In addition to equipment for rescuing and treating survivors, rescue ships carried High Frequency radio Direction Finding equipment (abbreviated to HF/DF and known as &quot;Huff-Duff&quot;) to assist in the location of U-boats. The rescue ship&#x27;s position at the rear of the convoy provided good triangulation in combination with the HF/DF installed on the escort leader typically patrolling in front of the convoy.

The Rescue Ship Service was organised by Lieutenant-Commander L. F. Martyn RNVR, who later co-authored a book highlighting the successes and challenges of the rescue ships.

<doc id="1106329" wikidata="Q3139292" url="?curid=1106329" title="Hold Out">
<text>Hold Out is the sixth album by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 1980. Although critically the album has not been as well-received as other Browne recordings, it remains his only album to date to reach number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

==History==
The song &quot;Of Missing Persons&quot; was written for Inara George, the daughter of Lowell George (formerly of the band Little Feat), a songwriting collaborator and longtime friend of Jackson Browne&#x27;s who died a year prior to the release of &quot;Hold Out&quot;. The phrase &quot;of missing persons&quot; was derived from a line in a Little Feat song, &quot;Long Distance Love&quot;.

The album was certified as a Gold and Platinum record in 1980 by the RIAA. It reached Multi-platinum in 2001.

==Reception==

Despite being Browne&#x27;s only album to date to reach number 1 in the Billboard charts, it received mixed critical reviews. Writing retrospectively for AllMusic, music critic William Rulhmann called some of the tracks awkward or foolish. He compared the album with earlier releases: &quot;If Browne was still trying to write himself out of the cul-de-sac he had created for himself early on, &quot;Hold Out&quot; represented an earnest attempt that nevertheless fell short.&quot; Similarly, critic Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;Never hep to his jive, I&#x27;m less than shocked by the generalized sentimentality disillusioned admirers descry within these hallowed tracks, though the one about the late great Lowell George... is unusually rank.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed &quot;Hold Out&quot; &quot;a fine record; perhaps his finest, overall... It confirms his growth as an artist.&quot;

<doc id="1106345" wikidata="Q4753041" url="?curid=1106345" title="Ancillary relief">
<text>In English law, an application for financial relief following the presentation of a petition for divorce, nullity or judicial separation used to be described as ancillary relief. The term arose because the financial application was &#x27;ancillary&#x27; to the petition. However, the term was discarded by the Family Procedure Rules 2010 which substituted it with the term &quot;application for a financial order&quot;.

==Explanation==
The courts powers derive in large part from the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, and in particular section 25(2) which sets out the statutory checklist of factors that should be taken into account. The court can order lump sum payments, property adjustment orders (e.g. requiring a property is transferred into the ownership of a husband or wife), periodical payments (known as &#x27;maintenance&#x27;) and (from 2000) pension sharing orders.

Maintenance orders can be given on nominal or specific terms. Nominal orders operate on the basis that if the court makes no order for maintenance (known as &quot;periodical payments&quot;) at the time of the final order, it cannot later come back and make an order. If, on the other hand, it makes an order, it can later vary it. This is why an order for periodical payments at the rate of 5 pence per year (the usual nominal order) is known as a nominal order - it gives the recipient the right to come back and make an application for a substantive monthly sum at a later date.

Following a 1984 amendment, the court is obliged to consider whether the parties&#x27; financial relationship should be terminated (&#x27;clean break&#x27;).

==Legal rulings==
The leading cases are now the House of Lords decisions of &quot;White v White 2001&quot; 1 A.C. 596 and Miller/ McFarlane.

<doc id="1106351" wikidata="Q14875769" url="?curid=1106351" title="Sir Sandford Fleming Park">
<text>Sir Sandford Fleming Park is a Canadian urban park located in the community of Jollimore in Halifax Regional Municipality. It is also known as Dingle Park or simply The Dingle, named after the town of Dingle in southwestern Ireland. The park was donated to the people of Halifax by Sir Sandford Fleming. The centrepiece of the park is an impressive tower that commemorates Nova Scotia&#x27;s achievement of representative government in 1758. Constructed between 1908 and 1912, the Memorial Tower was erected during the same period of building other commemorative towers in the British Commonwealth, notably Cabot Tower in Bristol, England (1898) and Cabot Tower in St. John&#x27;s (1900).

==History==
During the 1880s Sir Sandford Fleming, famous for introducing standard time to North America, established a summer retreat on property fronting Halifax&#x27;s Northwest Arm, after he finished constructing the Intercolonial Railway. He called his retreat The Dingle, the name that is still used today.

The park contains two walking trails passing through forests, heath barrens, saltwater marsh, and a large pond (Frog Pond). As well, the park also hosts a small sandy beach. The water quality of the beach had been a long, contentious issue due to decades of raw sewage being dumped into the Northwest Arm. Following the completion of new sewage treatment facilities in 2008, many of these concerns were allayed. Swimmers should check the municipality&#x27;s website, and note that users should not swim at the Dingle beach for three days after heavy rainfall.

=== Dingle Tower ===

In 1908, Fleming donated the property to the citizens of Halifax for use as a park and proposed the construction of a tower within it to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the establishment of representative government in Nova Scotia, the province having held on 2 October 1758 the first elected assembly in what is now Canada.

An ardent imperialist, Fleming also intended the proposed tower to serve as a memorial to the development of parliamentary institutions in the British Empire, now the Commonwealth. Designed by the architects Sidney Dumaresq and Andrew Cobb, the tower stands out as a rare form of architectural expression in the pre-World War I period of rising Canadian nationalism and fervent loyalty to the British Empire. The Memorial Tower is architecturally important because it combines Italianate influences with local construction methods and materials. 
The ten-storey stone &quot;Dingle Memorial Tower&quot; plan was accepted by the City of Halifax and the local Canadian Club undertook a fundraising drive to pay for construction. Donations were received from throughout the British Empire and plaques commemorating the contributions, as well as stones from all of the countries of the Empire were placed on the interior walls.

It was formally dedicated in an impressive ceremony in August 1912 by Canada&#x27;s Governor General the Duke of Connaught who was also Queen Victoria&#x27;s son Prince Arthur. The presence of members of the Royal Family and dignitaries from other parts of the Empire emphasized the importance of the occasion.

In 1913, two large bronze lions at the foot of the tower were donated by the Royal Colonial Institute of London. Designed by British sculptor Albert Bruce-Joy, they are similar to Sir Edwin Landseer&#x27;s lions at Nelson&#x27;s Column in Trafalgar Square.

==== Restoration ==== 

The Memorial Tower was restored between 2010 and 2013. It was partially reopened at the beginning of August 2012 when the 100th Anniversary was celebrated at the opening ceremony. The bulk of the restoration was done by Coastal Restoration and Masonry with the involvement of a number of other specialist firms. The restoration included repointing the entire tower interior and exterior, rebuilding the copper roof, installing new stainless steel grilles on the Observation Deck to keep birds out and people in, reinforcing and refinishing the internal stairs, installing new interior and exterior lighting, refurbishing the window openings and installing new windows, and refurbishing the 35 plaques on the interior walls and the two bronze lions guarding the entrance. The total cost was approximately $2.3 million.
The Dingle Memorial Tower is open to the public in the summer months and has views of the city and Northwest Arm.

===Sir Sandford Fleming Cottage===

This rustic cottage on Dingle Road in the park was built in 1886 on land purchased in 1871 by Sandford Fleming. He spent summers at the cottage until his death in the cottage in 1915. The cottage was noted for its large stone fireplace studded with Nova Scotia amethyst The cottage was purchased by the city in 1948 and designated a municipal heritage building in 1985. It was used for rental accommodation as well as by park maintenance workers until the 1990s. Concerns have been raised about its fate as it currently remains vacant and boarded up, although the Halifax Regional Municipality is studying restoration and adaptive reuse.

<text>Theodore D. &quot;Ted&quot; Pappas is executive editor and chief development officer of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica.&quot; He has been with the company since 1998.

He was managing editor of the paleoconservative magazine &quot;Chronicles: A Magazine of American Culture&quot;. His books include &quot;True Grit: Classic Tales of Perseverance&quot; (2018), &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica Anniversary Edition: 250 Years of Excellence (1768-2018),&quot; &quot;Britannica Brainbusters: Challenging Puzzles for the Curious-Minded (&quot;2015), and &quot;Plagiarism and the Culture War: The Writings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Other Prominent Americans&quot; (1998)&quot;.&quot; He contributes to Britannica&#x27;s PR activities and media relations.

Pappas&#x27; first publication was his undergraduate thesis at Beloit College on the missionary Arthur Henderson Smith, who had a long career in China and himself graduated from Beloit in 1845.

== Martin Luther King&#x27;s plagiarism controversy ==
The Rockford Institute published &quot;Plagiarism and the Culture War: The Writings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Other Prominent Americans&quot; in 1994, and a revised and enlarged edition came out in 1998, with a Preface by Eugene Genovese. The political scientist David J. Garrow wrote in evaluation of Pappas&#x27; preliminary article in &quot;Chronicle&quot; that &quot;nothing can be gained by attempting to minimize or understate either the amount of King&#x27;s plagiarism or the seriousness of the academic wrongdoing that it represented.&quot; He continued that &quot;those who are either uncomfortable with or downright hostile to King and the movement&#x27;s larger political legacy,&quot; in particular Pappas, &quot; are hard at work to amplify and emphasize&quot; the pirating.&quot; D.D. Murphey, however, welcomed the expanded argument presented in the 1994 book. 

== Criticism of Wikipedia ==
in 2004, Pappas disparaged the reliability of Wikipedia. He was quoted in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as noting that &quot;The premise of Wikipedia is that continuous improvement will lead to perfection&quot; but &quot;that premise is completely unproven...&quot; He continued that &quot;with many of the pieces you don&#x27;t know who it&#x27;s written by, and who the administrators are...,&quot; and concluded that &quot;hyperlinks, bulletpoints and cut-and-paste press releases do not an encyclopedia entry make.&quot;

<doc id="1106360" wikidata="Q7941037" url="?curid=1106360" title="Volunteer Ministers">
<text>A Volunteer Minister (VM) is a member of the Church of Scientology sent to a disaster zone to spread the doctrine of Scientology during disaster relief efforts. The program was created in the 1970s by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.

The Church of Scientology says that the program constitutes &quot;the only effective steps to arrest and reverse the deterioration of [the] world&quot;, but critics argue that Scientology uses the program to gain positive media attention and recruit new members (known within Scientology as &quot;raw meat&quot;).

There has been controversy over the group&#x27;s goals and activities.

==Objectives==

According to Hubbard, the objective of the program is to &quot;put basic Dianetics and Scientology technology into view and into use at the raw public level.&quot; In Hubbard&#x27;s words, &quot;The Volunteer Minister&#x27;s Handbook&quot; &quot;will be broadly distributed on [Scientology] and non-Scientology lines, bought by the man on the street. He&#x27;ll use some of the data, produce some miracles, save a marriage or two, rescue some kid from drugs, help his next door neighbor who&#x27;s upset because her child&#x27;s failing in school and couldn&#x27;t care less, plus brighten up her yawning of Spring and teach him to study, and handle Aunt Martha&#x27;s dizziness with assists.&quot;

Each Volunteer Minister pays to attend a two-week course and purchase Scientology materials; in 1994, these materials cost $435. The book is called &quot;The Scientology Handbook&quot; and is 968 pages long.

==Origins==
The program is the successor to earlier Scientology outreach efforts, notably the &quot;Casualty Contact&quot; program for recruiting new Scientologists (called &quot;preclears&quot;) from hospitals, the scenes of accidents and other places where people might have experienced trauma. As Hubbard put it, &quot;One takes every daily paper he can get his hands on and cuts from it every story whereby he might have a preclear. [...] He should represent himself to the person or the person&#x27;s family as a minister whose compassion was compelled by the newspaper story concerning the person. [...].&quot;

Hubbard advised that &quot;using his minister&#x27;s card, an auditor need only barge into any non-sectarian hospital, get permission to visit the wards from the superintendent, mentioning nothing about processing but only about taking care of people&#x27;s souls.&quot; The primary objective was simply to recruit more members for Scientology: &quot;Some small percentage of the persons visited or their families will turn up in his group. Thus he will build a group and naturally from that group he will get a great many individual preclears.&quot; This was, however, not how the program was to be presented to the general public: &quot;A great many miracles will follow in his wake and he is later to become a subject of the press himself. However, in handling the press we should simply say that it is a mission of the Church to assist those who are in need of assistance.&quot;

The Volunteer Ministers program is also intended to operate as a recruitment activity. As Hubbard puts it,

:As the benefits of the Volunteer Minister program begin to spread throughout the society, a rank and file of people that have been helped will begin to accumulate. These people will begin to feed into missions and Churches of Scientology from wherever the Volunteer Minister has been at work.

==Activities==
Volunteer Ministers have been sent to the scenes of major disasters, where they have distributed Scientology pamphlets and purport to heal or relieve pain using Scientology techniques such as &quot;Locationals,&quot; &quot;Nerve assists&quot; and &quot;Touch assists.&quot;

VMs were sent to Southeast Asia after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Eight hundred were sent following Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

In 2012, news broke that Volunteer Ministers were providing purification rundowns in Vietnam to people who had been exposed to Agent Orange. Doctors and researchers criticized the treatments as unscientific and unproven, and warned that the high doses of niacin administered could be harmful. Dr. Marcella L. Warner, who studies the long-term health effects of dioxin exposure, said that &quot;a treatment focused on exercise and sweating would not be an effective way to rid the body of the toxin&quot;.

==Controversy==

As with many of the Church of Scientology&#x27;s programs, the Volunteer Ministers have generated controversy and criticism. They have been accused of attempting to take advantage of disasters in order to promote Scientology to a grief-stricken populace.

The Volunteer Minister program most heavily promoted by Scientology took place in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Critics of Scientology accused the organization of attempting to take advantage of the disaster in order to promote Scientology to the grief-stricken populace in the area. The National Mental Health Association issued a public warning in response to the conduct of Scientologists in the immediate aftermath of September 11, claiming that Scientologists were &quot;Intentionally confusing [the] public&quot; by presenting themselves as mental health service providers. According to NMHA President Michael M. Faenza, &quot;The public needs to understand that the Scientologists are using this tragedy to recruit new members. They are not providing mental health assistance.&quot;

In Russia, after the Beslan school hostage crisis tragedy in 2004, the Health Ministry ordered Scientologists out of the area, saying &quot;that various psychological tactics the groups use, including what it called hypnosis, may be harmful not only for adults, but for children that have already suffered severe mental shock.&quot;

In the United Kingdom, Volunteer Ministers played a similar role in the aftermath of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, targeting the families of victims and emergency workers. As in the United States in 2001, this resulted in controversy, and it was reported that Volunteer Ministers had been removed from the vicinity of survivors of the bus bombing in Tavistock Square. It later emerged that the Metropolitan Police had agreed to give the Church of Scientology privileged access to the Police Message Broadcasting System, enabling the Church to dispatch Volunteer Minister rapid-response teams in the event of future emergencies in the capital.

Paul Fletcher, director of the London branch of CCHR and Stefania Cisco, a Director of Special Affairs for Scientology, in 2006 admitted to an undercover BBC reporter that the purpose of the volunteer ministers was to keep the psychiatrists away, and called this &quot;spiritual security&quot;.

In the US, after the Virginia Tech massacre, April 16, 2007, 20 Volunteer Ministers were on the campus. Bulletins to Scientology members said that help had been requested by the university provost, the Salvation Army and the Red Cross, but these organizations denied that any requests had been made. The activities of the Volunteer Ministers at Virginia Tech was reported to have received strong criticism from local pastors.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Scientology produced and printed booklets titled &quot;How to Keep Yourself and Others Well&quot; for a campaign to contact businesses and government offices in many countries. Distributed in person by Scientologists dressed as Volunteer Ministers, local business owners in Switzerland sought information from a local activism group, [Free Anti-Scientology Activists] (FASA), because they had been told the booklet was produced in cooperation with the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (BAG). FASA contacted BAG, received a response, and posted online that BAG reported no such cooperation with Scientology. The Church of Scientology Basel sued FASA for slander; the case was dismissed after an evidentiary hearing in September 2023.

<text>Tuluá (), is a city located in the heart of Valle del Cauca, Colombia. A major industrial and commercial center, it is the region&#x27;s fourth-largest city after Cali—the department capital—Palmira and Buenaventura. Founded around 1741 by Juan de Lemos y Aguirre, it has a population of approximately 178,000. It is also known as the &quot;Corazón del Valle&quot; (meaning &#x27;The Heart of Valle&#x27;), as &quot;La Villa de Céspedes&quot; (&#x27;Town of Céspedes&#x27;, named after the naturalist Juan María Céspedes) and &quot;Tierra Fácil&quot; (&#x27;Easy Land&#x27; in the native language).

It is well known throughout Colombia and many parts of South America as a major center of salsa dancing.

==Geography==

The Tuluá River runs through Tuluá&#x27;s urban area. The city is located 269 miles from Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, 63 miles northeast of Cali and 108 miles from the important harbor city of Buenaventura, which lies on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. Although it has a relatively small urban area, Tuluá&#x27;s metropolitan area is comparatively big. The city lies between the two westernmost cordilleras of Colombia, about 50 miles east of Buenaventura.

===Climate===
Located just three degrees north of the equator, Tuluá has a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot; in the Köppen climate classification). It has hot, sunny days usually in the high 20s and low 30s, punctuated by intense storms. Night temperatures are on average in the high teens. A lot of different vegetables and fruit are grown in Tuluá.


==Crime==

Tuluá has high crime rates. The surge in murders is allegedly due to rivaling paramilitary gangs Los Urabeños and Los Rastrojos fighting for control of the city&#x27;s lucrative drug trade. In 2022, over 50 people were killed by a prison riot.

==Education==
The University of Valle has a branch campus in Tuluá. The main campus is based in Cali, the department&#x27;s capital. UCEVA (the Central University of Valle del Cauca) has its main campus in the city.

==Transportation==
The closest airport is Cali&#x27;s international airport—which in fact is in Palmira—Alfonso Bonilla Aragón International Airport (CLO) or Palmaseca. Sixteen airlines provide service for the airport, including American Airlines, Avianca (Colombia&#x27;s largest airline and flag carrier) and Avianca Cargp. Tuluá also has a regional airport, Heriberto Gíl Martínez Airport (ULQ).

<text>Whittier is a neighborhood within the Powderhorn community in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, bounded by Franklin Avenue on the north, Interstate 35W on the east, Lake Street on the south, and Lyndale Avenue on the west. It is known for its many diverse restaurants, coffee shops and Asian markets, especially along Nicollet Avenue (also known as &quot;Eat Street&quot;). The neighborhood is home to the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, and the Children&#x27;s Theatre Company.

While the neighborhood is officially part of the greater Powderhorn community, it is separated from most of those areas by Interstate 35W, and also lies further north than the rest of the community area. Most of Powderhorn is east of Interstate 35W and south of Lake Street; the Whittier neighborhood is west of I-35W and north of Lake Street. Whittier is often associated with adjacent neighborhoods, such as Lowry Hill East in the Calhoun-Isles community to the west and Stevens Square neighborhood in the Central community to the north.

==History==
In the 1800s, Mdewakanton Dakota occupied the area from Saint Anthony Falls toward the Minnesota River following their migration from Mille Lacs Lake and the onward expansion of the quarreling Ojibwa. Temporary Dakota camps were photographed in Whittier which are in the MNHS catalog.
In 1849 at the age of 21, John T. Blaisdell moved from Maine and squatted on land just south of downtown Minneapolis. His brothers eventually came and together they lived in a log house which became Blaisdell School.

Following the 1851 Treaty of Traverse des Sioux which expropriated lands to the United States, Blaisdell developed the area south of Downtown Minneapolis into Blaisdell&#x27;s Addition. For capital, he sold timber to the booming lumber industry and leased land for the Morrison Farm in the east, which the Morrisons eventually purchased.

=== Blaisdell to Whittier ===

After the Blaisdell brothers returned from the Civil War in 1865, Minneapolis began growing in population again. Annexations in 1867 and 1883 turned Blaisdell&#x27;s Addition into South Minneapolis. Entrepreneurs and businessmen soon moved out of Downtown East and built their mansions in the present Washburn-Fair Oaks Mansion District. Much of the Morrison&#x27;s farm was sold for this expansion. Fair Oaks Park, at the center of this district, was formerly the site of William D. Washburn&#x27;s mansion. Meanwhile, the southern end of Whittier grew as an agricultural and industrial job center with working-class housing along the Hastings and Dakota tracks of the Milwaukee Road rail line along 29th Street which shipped grain from southern Minnesota. Blaisdell Road became Blaisdell Avenue, extending past the neighborhood to the southern boundaries.

In 1882, Blaisdell built his manor at Nicollet and 24th Street West. The family moved out of Blaisdell School. A year later, Blaisdell, Longfellow and Irving Schools across the southern prairie were annexed to the Minneapolis school system from Hennepin County. In naming tradition with the other schools, the board renamed the school Whittier after the 19th century poet and abolitionist, John Greenleaf Whittier. Like other areas of the city, families would soon call their neighborhoods after the primary school. Called the &quot;millionaire pioneer of the city&quot; by the New York Times, John T. Blaisdell died in 1898.
Into the 20th century, Thomas Lowry and his partners assumed control of the insolvent McCrory&#x27;s Motor Line. Whittier filled along Lowry&#x27;s new Nicollet Ave. and 4th Ave. streetcar routes. The increasingly residential nature of southern Minneapolis brought contention with the Milwaukee Road as neighbors petitioned the City Council from 1905 to 1909 to alleviate the effects of the crossings which was blamed for several deaths. The Milwaukee Road offered a failed proposal to elevate the tracks and returned with a $1.3 million plan to depress the tracks and construct a dozen road bridges. After a legal battle with the businesses affected by loss of rail access, the project was upheld and completed in 1916. 
===Post-War Decline===

The neighborhood maintained a dense population and high rental occupancy up towards the city&#x27;s population peak in the 1950s. The latter 20th century followed with other inner core neighborhoods as the postwar boom of the 1960s depleted Whittier&#x27;s population. The routing of Interstate 35W was modified following city concerns over expensive land acquisition of apartments and mansions including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. In November 1967, Interstate 35W was built around the neighborhood to spare the Mansion District which was later preserved in its current historic district.

Whittier experienced decline as middle-class residents moved out. The demolition of Nicollet Ball Park in Lyndale neighborhood led to retail failure on the neighborhood&#x27;s south end. Abandoned buildings and adult bookstores prompted the city to establish the Nicollet/Lake Economic Development District in 1972. Several years passed without activity as Target and Herberger&#x27;s refused to build. K-Mart finally agreed to become a tenant on the grounds that the City close Nicollet Avenue at Lake Street, and the project was done in 1978.

However a boon for the city, the closing accelerated the neighborhood&#x27;s problems and Nicollet north of Lake Street was stifled of car traffic. Crime and prostitution became common. Neighbors who stayed had formed a neighborhood association in response to bitter protests over the K-Mart project. The Whittier Alliance (WA) was established in 1977 to monitor the weakened community and rehabilitate housing. WA operated as a Community Development Corporation, developing housing for many years in order to sustain its operations in community outreach. The City attempted to bring about a citizen participation model to assist neighborhoods until with the Legislature&#x27;s assistance created the Neighborhood Revitalization Program in 1987 to formally address urban issues with funding. The city began designating official neighborhood boundaries at this time and Whittier was formalized.

===Millennial rebirth===

Several factors had sown seeds for Whittier&#x27;s comeback from the post-war suburban flight. Nicollet Avenue had not suffered completely. An authentic German restaurant, the Black Forest Inn, opened in 1965 at the corner of 26th and Nicollet, becoming the avenue&#x27;s main restaurant anchor for decades. As Whittier gained a bohemian culture for its cheap housing, the Artist Quarter jazz club was opened in the 1970s on the adjoining corner establishing a music anchor in the region. During this time, Chinese and Vietnamese businesses began opening on Nicollet following the Vietnam War. The Hip Sing Tong branch headquarters at 2633 Nicollet may explain the presence. Mexican businesses too opened but later in the 1980s on as they became a growing proportion of the immigrant population.

Recognizing the street&#x27;s potential, the Whittier Alliance and Business Association created a new branding scheme called Eat Street. It was completed in 1997 with a street scape reconstruction along the entire corridor. The abandoned Milwaukee Road trench also gained renewed interest during this time for re-use as a rails to trails transportation corridor. The Midtown Community Works and Midtown Greenway Coalition formed and federal funds were acquired for redevelopment. The first phase of the new Midtown Greenway was built in 1999 and entirely finished in Minneapolis by 2005. In the 2000s, after nearly two decades of private sector disinvestment, three major condominium projects were completed along Nicollet Avenue. In 2011 a major development came to the corner of 26th and Nicollet including a major indoor climbing facility and several new restaurants. In 2012, Whittier Alliance and the City of Minneapolis began working to move Kmart and restore Nicollet Avenue including a possible streetcar system. In 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, K-Mart shuttered their doors, closing the last remaining store in the state. In 2023, the K-Mart was demolished and as of April 2024, plans are underway for new Nicollet Redevelopment.

==Demographics==

The population of Whittier is 14,483. The neighborhood is 52.8% non-Hispanic White, 23.3% Black, 13.6% Hispanic or Latino, 3.5% Asian, and 6.8% other. The top five single ancestries in 2000 were German (1,780 people), Subsaharan African (1,070 people), Norwegian (870 people), Irish (830 people), and Somali (490 people).

About 82% of households rent. Whittier is the most populous neighborhood in Minneapolis, and second only in density to its neighbor Stevens Square.

==Government==
Whittier was part of Ward 6 until redistricting in 2013, which placed Whittier in Ward 10. Ward 10 is currently represented by Minneapolis City Council Member Aisha Chughtai. The neighborhood is currently officially represented by the Whittier Alliance, a community organization founded in 1977, which is recognized by the City of Minneapolis and its Neighborhood Revitalization Program (NRP). These NRP funds allow the Whittier Alliance to work with individuals, families, and businesses to build the community in terms of safety, economic development, and livability. Another informal organization is the Whittier Neighbors, founded in 1996. The Fifth Police Precinct serves the neighborhood under Sector One.

Whittier is in Minnesota Senate District 62, represented by Omar Fateh, and in Minnesota House district 62A, represented by Aisha Gomez. Minneapolis Public Schools Area 23.

==Education==
The Minneapolis College of Art and Design (MCAD) is in Whittier.

In the 1990s, the City of Lakes Waldorf School and Watershed High School moved into Whittier. Both schools renovated the American Hardware Mutual Insurance Company building (constructed 1922) at the corner of 24th Street and Nicollet Avenue. Behind this building, at the corner of 24th Street and Blaisdell Avenue, the &quot;play yard&quot; occupies the former site of a Dayton&#x27;s family mansion. Whittier School had moved to Blaisdell Avenue and closed in the 1960s. 

After the departure of Whittier High, the Whittier Alliance led an effort with its NRP capital to build the new Whittier International Elementary School, constructed on the east half of Whittier Park in 2001. This public school serves a population of 350 students in grades K-5.

The Minneapolis Japanese School, a weekend Japanese educational program designated by the Japanese Ministry of Education, previously held its classes at MCAD.

<doc id="1106367" wikidata="Q171301" url="?curid=1106367" title="Culture of the Soviet Union">
<text>The culture of the [[Soviet Union]] passed through several stages during the country&#x27;s 69-year existence. It was contributed to by people of various nationalities from every one of fifteen union republics, although the majority of the influence was made by the Russians. The Soviet state supported cultural institutions, but also carried out strict censorship.

==History==
===Lenin era===
The main feature of communist attitudes towards the arts and artists in the years 1918–1929 was relative freedom, with significant experimentation in several different styles in an effort to find a distinctive Soviet style of art. In many respects, the NEP period was a time of relative freedom and experimentation for the social and cultural life of the Soviet Union. The government tolerated a variety of trends in these fields, provided they were not overtly hostile towards the establishment. In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated. Communist writers Maxim Gorky and Vladimir Mayakovsky were active during this time, but other authors, many of whose works were later repressed, published work lacking socialist political content. Film, as a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, received encouragement from the state; much of cinematographer Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s best work dates from this period.

Education, under Commissar Anatoly Lunacharsky, entered a phase of experimentation based on progressive theories of learning. At the same time, the state expanded the primary and secondary school system, and introduced night schools for working adults. The quality of higher education was affected by admissions policy that preferred entrants from the proletarian class over those from bourgeois backgrounds, regardless of the applicants&#x27; qualifications.

Under NEP, the state eased its active persecution of religion begun during war communism but continued to agitate on behalf of atheism. The party supported the Living Church reform movement within the Russian Orthodox Church in hopes that it would undermine faith in the church, but the movement died out in the late-1920s.

In family life, attitudes generally became more permissive. The state legalized abortion, and it made divorce progressively easier to obtain, whilst public cafeterias proliferated at the expense of private family kitchens.

===Stalin era===

Arts during the rule of Joseph Stalin were characterized by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of socialist realism, with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions. Many notable works of Mikhail Bulgakov were not repressed, although the full text of his novel &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; was published only in 1966. Many writers were imprisoned and killed, or died of starvation, examples being Daniil Kharms, Osip Mandelstam, Isaac Babel and Boris Pilnyak. Andrei Platonov worked as a caretaker and was not allowed to publish. The work of Anna Akhmatova was also condemned by the government, although she notably refused the opportunity to escape to the West. During the time when the Party was trying to make Soviet government more palatable to Ukrainians, a great deal of national self-determination and cultural development was tolerated. After this short period of the renaissance of Ukrainian literature ended, more than 250 Ukrainian writers died during the Great Purge, for example Valerian Pidmohylny (1901–1937), in the so-called Executed Renaissance. Texts of imprisoned authors were confiscated by the NKVD and some of them were published later. Books were removed from libraries and destroyed.

In addition to literature, musical expression was also repressed during the Stalin era, and at times the music of many Soviet composers was banned altogether. Dmitri Shostakovich experienced a particularly long and complex relationship with Stalin, during which his music was denounced and prohibited twice, in 1936 and 1948 (see Zhdanov Doctrine). Sergei Prokofiev and Aram Khachaturian had similar cases. Although Igor Stravinsky did not live in the Soviet Union, his music was officially considered formalist and anti-Soviet.

===Late Soviet Union===

In the late Soviet Union, Soviet popular culture was characterized by fascination with the Western popular culture as exemplified by the blue jeans craze.

In arts, the liberalization of all aspects of life starting from the Khrushchev Thaw created a possibility for the evolution of various forms of non-formal, underground and dissident art; still repressed, but no longer under the immediate threat of imprisonment. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who wrote the critical &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and subsequently exiled from the Soviet Union. 

Greater experimentation in art forms became permissible in the 1970s, with the result that more sophisticated and subtly critical work began to be produced. The government loosened the strictures of socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author Yury Trifonov concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism. In music, although the state continued to frown on such Western phenomena as jazz and rock, it began to permit Western musical ensembles specializing in these genres to make limited appearances. But the native balladeer Vladimir Vysotsky, widely popular in the Soviet Union, was denied official recognition because of his iconoclastic lyrics.

<doc id="1106368" wikidata="Q992490" url="?curid=1106368" title="Lukeville, Arizona">
<text>Lukeville is a small unincorporated town on the Mexico–United States border in southern Pima County, Arizona, United States. It was started by Charles Luke brother of World War I aviator Frank Luke, an Arizona native who was awarded a posthumous Medal of Honor.

==Description==
The community lies at Lukeville Port of Entry border crossing into Sonoyta, Sonora, Mexico. It is the terminus of State Route 85 and is located entirely within Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. There is a stop-over spot for buses that are bound for Phoenix and Tucson along with a post office and a duty-free shop.

Its population was approximately 35 at the 2000 census, 27 (77%) of whom were Hispanic or Latino.

A project to replace portions of the Mexico–United States barrier in this area began in 2019.

Lukeville is not in a school district. The closest district is the Ajo Unified School District.

==Climate==
This area has a large amount of sunshine year round due to its stable descending air and high pressure. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Lukeville has a hot desert climate, abbreviated &quot;BWh&quot; on climate maps.

==Education==
The Pima County School Superintendent arranges for education of K-12 students living in areas without school districts. It arranges for transportation to the Ajo Unified School District from the Lukeville area.

<doc id="1106375" wikidata="Q4348114" url="?curid=1106375" title="1980 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1980 United States Senate elections were held on November 4, coinciding with Ronald Reagan&#x27;s victory in the presidential election. The 34 Senate seats of Class 3 were contested in regular elections. Reagan&#x27;s large margin of victory over incumbent Jimmy Carter gave a huge boost to Republican Senate candidates, allowing them to flip 12 Democratic seats and win control of the chamber for the first time since the end of the 83rd Congress in January 1955. This was the first time since 1966 that any party successfully defended all their own seats.

This is one of only five occasions where ten or more Senate seats changed hands in an election, with the others being in 1920, 1932, 1946, and 1958. This is the earliest Senate election with a Senator that is still serving, that being Chuck Grassley of Iowa.

This was the largest Senate swing since 1958, and was the largest Republican gain since 1946, when the Republicans also picked up 12 seats. This was also the last time the Senate changed hands in a presidential election year until 2020 when Democrats won control, the last time the Republicans gained control of the Senate in a presidential election year until 2024, and the last time Maryland elected a Republican to the Senate. These elections were also the last time the winner of the presidential election had coattails in the Senate until 2004.

== Closest races ==

In nineteen races the margin of victory was under 10%.

== Alabama ==


Incumbent Democrat Donald Stewart decided to run for his first full term, but was defeated in the primary. In November, Republican Jeremiah Denton defeated Democrat Jim Folsom, Public Service Commissioner.





==Alaska==


Incumbent Democrat Mike Gravel ran for a third term, but lost in the Democratic primary to Clark Gruening, a former state representative who was the grandson of Ernest Gruening, whom Gravel had defeated twelve years prior in an election for the same seat. Gruening later went on to lose the general election to Republican nominee Frank Murkowski, a banker.

After the loss of Gravel&#x27;s seat, no Alaska Democrat would win a congressional race again until Mark Begich&#x27;s narrow, protracted triumph in Alaska&#x27;s 2008 Senate election.

First elected in 1968, by 1980 two-term Democratic incumbent Mike Gravel had become noted for a filibuster that attempted to end the draft during the Vietnam War and for including the full text of the Pentagon Papers in the Congressional Record.

Gravel faced a challenging bid for re-election, complicated by the fact that his triumph over Ernest Gruening years prior had made him a pariah in the Alaska Democratic Party. Though Gravel had campaigned to be selected as George McGovern&#x27;s running mate in the 1972 U.S. presidential election and had easily won re-election to the Senate in 1974, he had never established a strong political base in Alaska.

The passage of a controversial land bill earlier in the year, as opposed to a compromise bill worked out by fellow senator Ted Stevens that failed thanks to Gravel two years prior, further harmed his re-election bid. A group of Democrats, including future governor Steve Cowper, campaigned against Gravel on the land bill issue.

The sources of Gravel&#x27;s campaign funds, some of which came from political action committees outside the state, also became an issue in the contest. Another factor may have been Alaska&#x27;s blanket primary system, which allows unlimited cross-over voting across parties and from its large unaffiliated electorate; Republicans believed Gruening would be an easier candidate to defeat in the general election. The blanket primary had first been used in the 1968 election, and was something Gravel himself was able to capitalize upon in his 1968 campaign.

Gravel would later comment that by the time of his primary defeat, he had alienated &quot;almost every constituency in Alaska.&quot; In the August 26, 1980, primary Gruening defeated Gravel by 11 percentage points.










== Arizona ==


Incumbent Republican Barry Goldwater decided to run for reelection to a third consecutive term, after returning to the U.S. Senate in 1968 following his failed Presidential run in 1964 against Lyndon B. Johnson. Goldwater defeated Democratic Party nominee Bill Schulz in the general election, but only by a narrow margin, which later caused Goldwater to decide against running for reelection to a fourth consecutive term.







== Arkansas ==

Incumbent Democrat Dale Bumpers won re-election to a second term over real estate broker William Clark.



== California ==

Incumbent Democrat Alan Cranston easily won re-election to a third term over Paul Gann, political activist, even as the state&#x27;s former Republican governor, Ronald Reagan, claimed a landslide victory in the presidential election.





== Colorado ==

Incumbent Democrat Gary Hart won re-election to a second term over Mary Estill Buchanan, Colorado Secretary of State.



== Connecticut ==

Incumbent Democrat Abraham Ribicoff decided to retire. Democrat Chris Dodd won the open seat over James Buckley, former U.S. senator from New York.





== Florida ==

Incumbent Democrat Richard Stone decided to run for re-election to a second term, but was defeated in the Democratic primary election by Bill Gunter. Republican Paula Hawkins won the open seat.

Stone, a freshman senator, had a reputation for changing his mind. In 1980, the AFL–CIO actively campaigned against him, and Stone was deemed vulnerable in his re-election bid. Six Democrats entered the race for Stone&#x27;s seat including his 1974 runoff opponent Bill Gunter who was Florida State Treasurer/Insurance Commissioner in 1980. As was the case in 1974, Stone and Gunter were forced into a runoff but, unlike 1974, Gunter won the nomination.















== Georgia ==

Incumbent Democrat and former Governor of Georgia Herman Talmadge decided to run for re-election to a fifth term, but lost a close race to Mack Mattingly, Chairman of the Georgia Republican Party. 1980 resulted in a landslide election for Republicans that would come to be known as the Reagan Revolution.




== Hawaii ==

Incumbent Democrat Daniel Inouye was re-elected to a fourth term, defeating Republican Cooper Brown.



== Idaho ==

Incumbent Democrat Frank Church ran for re-election to a fifth term, but was defeated by Republican Steve Symms, U.S. Congressman.



== Illinois ==

Incumbent Democrat Adlai Stevenson III decided to retire. Democrat Alan J. Dixon won the open seat, beating Dave O&#x27;Neal, Lieutenant Governor of Illinois






== Indiana ==

Incumbent Democrat Birch Bayh ran for a fourth term, but was defeated by Republican Dan Quayle.


Birch Bayh, the incumbent senator, faced no opposition within the Indiana Democratic Party and avoided a primary election. Bayh was originally elected in 1962 and re-elected in 1968 and 1974. He was Chairman of Senate Intelligence Committee and architect of 25th and 26th Amendments. This election was one of the key races in the country, and signaled a trend that would come to be known as Reagan&#x27;s coattails, describing the influence Ronald Reagan had in congressional elections. Incumbent three-term senator Birch Bayh was defeated by over 160,000 votes to Representative Dan Quayle, who would later go on to be Vice President of the United States.

== Iowa ==


Incumbent Democrat John Culver sought re-election to a second term in the Senate, but he was unsuccessful in his bid to do so, falling to Chuck Grassley, the United States Congressman from Iowa&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, the Republican nominee.








== Kansas ==

Incumbent Republican Bob Dole won re-election to a third term, defeating Democratic (formerly Republican) State Senator John Simpson.




== Kentucky ==


Democrat Wendell Ford won re-election, defeating Republican Mary Louise Foust.



== Louisiana ==

Incumbent Russell B. Long ran for re-election to a seventh and final term, defeating State Representative Woody Jenkins.





== Maryland ==


Incumbent Republican Charles Mathias ran for re-election to a third term and defeated Democratic State Senator Edward T. Conroy.




== Missouri ==

Incumbent Democrat Thomas Eagleton won reelection, defeating Republican County Executive of St. Louis County Gene McNary.



== Nevada ==

Incumbent Republican Paul Laxalt won re-election to a second term over Mary Gojack, former State senator (1974–1978) and former State Assemblywoman (1972–1974).




== New Hampshire ==

Incumbent Democrat John Durkin was defeated by former Attorney General of New Hampshire Warren Rudman in a relatively close election, where nationwide Republicans would have a landslide election known as the Reagan Revolution.




== New York ==

Incumbent Republican Jacob K. Javits was defeated in the primary, and Republican Al D&#x27;Amato, Presiding Supervisor of the Town of Hempstead, won the three-way election with Elizabeth Holtzman, U.S. Representative.




Javits&#x27;s refusal to adjust politically to the rightward movement of his party as well as his 1979 diagnosis with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease) led to a primary challenge. Javits was defeated in the primary by Hempstead Presiding Supervisor Al D&#x27;Amato on September 9.

D&#x27;Amato, also running on the Conservative line, proceeded to defeat Democratic U.S. Representative Elizabeth Holtzman and Javits, who ran on the Liberal Party ticket. In the traditionally liberal state of New York, Javits split the Democratic vote with Holtzman to give D&#x27;Amato a close victory.







== North Carolina ==

Incumbent Democrat Robert Morgan lost re-election a second term to Republican John East, Professor at East Carolina University.




== North Dakota ==


Incumbent Republican Milton Young was retiring. Republican Mark Andrews defeated North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party candidate Kent Johanneson to fill the vacated seat.

Andrews, who had served as a Representative since 1965, easily received the Republican nomination, and the endorsed Democratic-NPL candidate was Kent Johanneson. Andrews and Johanneson won the primary elections for their respective parties.

Two independent candidates, Harley McLain and Don J. Klingensmith also filed before the deadline under the Chemical Farming Banned and Statesman parties respectively. McLain would later run for the same seat in 1998 against then incumbent Byron Dorgan.




== Ohio ==

Incumbent Democrat John Glenn won re-election to a second term in a landslide with 69% of the vote over Jim Betts, State Representative, coinciding with Ronald Reagan&#x27;s substantial win in the state during the presidential election.




== Oklahoma ==

Incumbent Republican Henry Bellmon decided to retire, instead of seeking a third term. Republican nominee Don Nickles won the open seat over Andy Coats, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma district attorney.

After two years in the State Senate and displeased by the policies of the Carter Administration, Nickles ran for the United States Senate in 1980 to succeed Republican Henry Bellmon who was retiring. As an unknown in a field crowded with business and political bigwigs, Nickles was not initially given much of a chance. Bellmon even tried to convince him to wait and run for the U.S. House. Utilizing personal contact and passing out unique &quot;wooden nickel&quot; campaign button novelties, Nickles unique grassroot community ties to local Amway distributors throughout Oklahoma gave him an interpersonal network which proved helpful. Nickles beat two well funded oil millionaires (Jack Zink and Ed Noble) in the primary and won the primary run-off against Zink, a race car driver. He later won the general election against Democrat Oklahoma City Mayor Andy Coats and independent Charles Nesbitt, the Oklahoma Corporation Commissioner and former Oklahoma Attorney General. At the age of 31, Nickles was the youngest Republican ever elected to the United States Senate.





== Oregon ==


Republican incumbent Bob Packwood was re-elected to a third term, defeating Democratic state senator Ted Kulongoski and Libertarian Tonie Nathan.

The primary elections were held on May 20, 1980, in conjunction with the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries. Interest in the primaries was somewhat subdued because they occurred just two days after the eruption of Mount St. Helens, about north of Oregon&#x27;s most populous city, Portland. The eruption (which was a VEI = 5 event) was the first significant one to occur in the contiguous 48 U.S. states since the 1915 eruption of California&#x27;s Lassen Peak.







In addition to the candidates chosen in the primaries, Tonie Nathan was chosen as the Libertarian Party candidate at that party&#x27;s convention in June. Previously, Nathan had been the Libertarian vice presidential candidate in the 1972 Presidential election and was the first woman to ever receive an electoral vote in a U.S. presidential election from a faithless elector who voted for her.

As a well-funded incumbent, Packwood was expected to have a fairly easy road to re-election and led by double digit margins in most early polls. Packwood chose defense spending as his key issue in the campaign while Kulongoski focused on the economy and unemployment. Nathan hammered at core Libertarian principles of limited government, with a goal of 5% of votes which would keep the party as a valid minor party. The three candidates agreed to three debates, to be held across the state in the summer of 1980. As the challenger, Kulongoski aggressively attempted to engage Packwood in the debates, but the debate format did not allow the candidates to ask follow-up questions or rebut each other&#x27;s statements and Packwood was largely able to avoid confrontation and stay above the fray. As the campaign wore on, Kulongoski grew more confident and tried to appeal to Oregonians&#x27; independent values by saying that Packwood&#x27;s enormous cash advantage was due to &quot;eastern&quot; money.

Kulongoski closed to within a few points in some late polls, but with no mistakes made by Packwood and with the coattail effect of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential victory, the incumbent achieved an electoral majority and a fairly comfortable 8-point margin over Kulongoski. Nathan finished with less than 4% of the vote, short of her goal of 5%. With Republicans taking control of the U.S. Senate, Packwood was in line to become chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. Fellow Oregon Republican senator Mark Hatfield was also elevated to chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, giving Oregon power in the Senate it had never seen before.




== Pennsylvania ==

Incumbent Republican Richard Schweiker decided to retire, instead of seeking a third term. Republican nominee Arlen Specter won the open seat, defeating Democratic nominee Peter F. Flaherty, former Mayor of Pittsburgh.

Arlen Specter, formerly a member of the Democratic party, had served as legal counsel to the Warren Commission, which investigated the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, after which he became District Attorney of Philadelphia. After he was defeated in a 1967 run for Mayor of Philadelphia, Specter was defeated in his bid for a third term as district attorney. He had run in the Republican primary in the 1976 Senate election, but was defeated by John Heinz and also ran in the 1978 gubernatorial election, but was defeated by Dick Thornburgh in the primary. Shortly after Specter opened a law practice in Atlantic City, New Jersey, incumbent Republican Richard Schweiker unexpectedly announced his decision not to seek re-election to his seat. Specter, believing his reputation as a political moderate would help him in the general election, decided to run. In the Republican primary, Specter faced state senator Edward Howard, as well as Delaware County councilman Bud Haabestad, who was endorsed by Schweiker, then-governor Thornburgh and John Heinz. Specter ultimately defeated Haabestad, his most prominent challenger, by approximately 37,000 votes.

In the Democratic primary, former Pittsburgh mayor Peter Flaherty contended with State Representative Joseph Rhodes Jr., former U.S. Representative Edward Mezvinsky, State senator H. Craig Lewis and Dean of Temple University Law School Peter J. Liacouras. Flaherty&#x27;s name recognition enabled him to defeat his primary opponents, winning every county and thus winning the Democratic nomination.

Flaherty employed a general election strategy he had used in two previous statewide office campaigns: win by a wide margin in the southwestern part of the state and narrowly win Philadelphia. He also hoped to carry several swing towns on account of his support from several labor unions. Specter hoped to carry his home town of Philadelphia, despite the Democrats&#x27; 7–2 voter registration advantage there. To this end, Specter sought endorsements among city Democratic leadership, including future mayor John F. Street. Specter hoped that, with wins in suburban areas and the heavily Republican central portion of the state in addition to winning Philadelphia, he would be able to win the election. Specter distanced himself from Governor Dick Thornburgh, who had become unpopular in some demographics due to his proposals to decrease welfare program spending.

In the end, Specter defeated Flaherty by approximately 108,000 votes, carrying Philadelphia and its suburbs as well as the central and northeastern portions of the state. Flaherty performed strongest in the western portion of the state, including Cambria, Clarion, Erie and Mercer counties.




== South Carolina ==

Incumbent Democratic senator Fritz Hollings easily defeated Republican challenger Marshall Mays to win his fourth (his third full) term.










== South Dakota ==

Incumbent Democrat George McGovern ran for re-election to a fourth term, but was defeated by Republican James Abdnor, U.S. Representative.





McGovern was one of several liberal Democratic U.S. senators targeted for defeat in 1980 by the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC), which put out a year&#x27;s worth of negative portrayals of McGovern. They and other anti-abortion groups especially focused on McGovern&#x27;s support for pro-choice abortion laws. McGovern faced a Democratic primary challenge for the first time, from an anti-abortion candidate.

Abdnor, a four-term incumbent congressman who held identical positions to McGovern on farm issues, was solidly conservative on national issues, and was well liked within the state. Abdnor&#x27;s campaign focused on both McGovern&#x27;s liberal voting record and what it said was McGovern&#x27;s lack of involvement in South Dakotan affairs. McGovern made an issue of NCPAC&#x27;s outside involvement, and that group eventually withdrew from the campaign after Abdnor denounced a letter they had sent out. Far behind in the polls earlier, McGovern outspent Abdnor 2-to-1, hammered away at Abdnor&#x27;s refusal to debate him (drawing attention to a slight speech defect Abdnor had), and, showing the comeback pattern of some of his past races in the state, closed the gap for a while.

However, in the general election McGovern was solidly defeated, getting only 39 percent of the vote to Abdnor&#x27;s 58 percent. McGovern became one of many Democratic casualties of that year&#x27;s Republican sweep, which became known as the &quot;Reagan Revolution&quot;.



== Utah ==

<text>Grumpy Old Men is a conversational-style British television series, first shown in October 2003 on BBC Two. The first run of four programmes was repeated several times before a second series, also of four episodes, was shown in 2004. A third series was broadcast in April 2006. There were also 2003 and 2004 Christmas specials. An Irish version, &quot;Gaybo&#x27;s Grumpy Men&quot;, was produced by RTÉ in 2005.

==Format==
The format shows a number of well-known middle-aged men talking about any issues of modern life which irritate them, from the proliferation of excessive road signs to unnecessary and overly-loud mobile phone conversations.

Regular contributors include Jeremy Clarkson, Bob Geldof, John Humphrys, A. A. Gill, Nigel Havers, Tony Hawks, Simon Hoggart, John O&#x27;Farrell, Rory McGrath, Bill Nighy, Matthew Parris, John Peel, Will Self, Arthur Smith, Tim Rice, Rick Stein, Tony Slattery, Rick Wakeman, Lemn Sissay, Don Warrington, Des Lynam, Richard Madeley, Kelvin MacKenzie, Felix Dexter and Michael Grade. The narrator is Geoffrey Palmer.

==Spin-offs==
The success of the series spawned &quot;Grumpy Old Women&quot;, first as a Christmas special and then as a full series in 2005. It repeated the formula of the original, featuring famous middle-aged women talking about their pet hates.

The grumpy old men and women together made a series, &quot;Grumpy Old Holidays&quot;, in which they talk about the frustrations of air travel, packing and so on. This was first shown on 18 June 2006.

A companion book to the series written by the original series producer Stuart Prebble, &quot;Grumpy Old Men (The Official Handbook)&quot;, was published in 2004, followed by &quot;Grumpy Old Men: The Secret Diary&quot; in 2005 and &quot;Grumpy Old Christmas&quot; in 2006, also by Prebble. The first series and its accompanying Christmas special was released on DVD and an audiobook based on the first two series was also made available, read by Arthur Smith.

Following the success of &quot;Grumpy Old Men/Women&quot;, the producers, Liberty Bell TV, have made a number of other series based on the same format, including &quot;Grumpy Old Holidays&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Grim Up North&quot;, &quot;My Appalling School Report&quot;, &quot;He Says, She Says&quot; and &quot;The Meaning Of Life&quot;. All of these were broadcast on BBC Two, except the last-named which was on BBC One.

The &quot;Grumpy Guide to Christmas&quot; was shown on BBC Two on 23 December 2009.

<doc id="1106380" wikidata="Q7804427" url="?curid=1106380" title="Tim Vine">
<text>Timothy Mark Vine (born 4 March 1967) is an English comedian, actor, writer and presenter best known for his one-liners and his role on the sitcom &quot;Not Going Out&quot; (2006–2012, 2014). He has also released a number of stand-up comedy specials and has written several joke books.

From 2004 to 2014, Vine held the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for the most jokes told in an hour; each joke had to get a laugh from the audience to count towards the total, and he set the new record with 499 jokes. In both 2010 and 2014, he won the award for best joke at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and was the runner-up for the three years in between.

==Early life==
Timothy Mark Vine was born in the Cheam suburb of London on 4 March 1967, the son of Diana (née Tillett), a housewife and occasional doctor&#x27;s receptionist, and Guy Vine (died 2018), a lecturer in civil engineering at North East Surrey College of Technology. He is the younger brother of broadcaster Jeremy Vine and the older brother of artist Sonya Vine. He was educated in Surrey, attending Lynton Prep in Ewell, Aberdour School in Burgh Heath, and Epsom College in Epsom.

==Career==
===Stand-up===
Vine&#x27;s stand-up act consists primarily of a series of quick-fire one-liners and puns, along with silly songs and a bagful of props.

Vine and a security guard from his office job in Croydon started doing open mic nights as a hobby. 
During 1991, Tim Vine regularly honed his routine at the Comedy Café in London, adding other clubs throughout 1992. He came second in the Hackney Empire New Act competition in 1993. Vine quit his job to go on tour as a support act for Boothby Graffoe, who later wrote additional material for &quot;The Sketch Show&quot;. Vine became a regular on the London comedy circuit by 1994, trying a variety of comedy styles. He realised one-liners were a good way forward after the audience&#x27;s positive reaction to his joke: &quot;So I went to the doctors. He said, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got hypochondria&#x27;. I said, &#x27;Not that as well! Vine built up this repertoire, before making his first TV appearance on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Pebble Mill&quot;.

In 1996, Vine met Lee Mack at the Comedy Lounge in Kingston-Upon-Hull. Mack was competing in The Gong Show, where up to ten comedians try to last for a full five minute slot, hoping to beat the Gong and not get voted off by the public. Mack inadvertently did a couple of Vine&#x27;s jokes, to which the audience shouted &quot;Tim Vine&quot;. When Mack came off stage, he asked a man who Tim Vine was, and got the reply &quot;He plays here quite a bit.&quot; The man he had asked was Tim Vine. The pair later worked together on &quot;The Sketch Show&quot;, &quot;Not Going Out&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Play Darts&quot; for Comic Relief.

The comedian has regularly appeared at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, with shows such as &quot;The Tim Vine Shambles&quot; and &quot;The Tim Vine Fiasco&quot; (1995) - which won him the Perrier Newcomer Award - then &quot;Tim Vine Flat Out&quot; (1998), &quot;I&#x27;m Vine Thanks&quot; and &quot;Tim Vine and the Minotaur&quot; (1999). In 2006, he had a large advertising hoarding erected featuring his name and image, with a small sub-heading &quot;...is not appearing at this year&#x27;s Edinburgh Festival.&quot; Vine appeared at the Pleasance Courtyard for the first two weeks of the 2008 Edinburgh Festival Fringe performing a show entitled &quot;Punslinger&quot;.

He appeared at the Christian festival, Spring Harvest, in 2007, 2008 and 2013 alongside John Archer at Skegness and Minehead, and at the Cambridge Theatre in May 2007 for a show entitled &quot;Tim Vine, Live in Concrete&quot;.
Vine&#x27;s UK comedy tours include &quot;Current Puns&quot; (2006) and &quot;Punslinger&quot; (2008). In July 2008, he recorded a performance at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London, which was released as a new DVD entitled &quot;So I Said To This Bloke...&quot; on 27 October 2008. His third tour, &quot;The Joke-amotive&quot;, took place during February and March 2010, with a DVD of the show released in November 2011. Vine&#x27;s &quot;Tim Timinee Tim Timinee Tim Tim to You&quot; tour recording was released in 2016, followed by &quot;Sunset Milk Idiot&quot; (2019). Vine&#x27;s support act is usually Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&#x27;s comedy magician John Archer.

In a BBC Radio Wales interview with Behnaz Akhgar (12 October 2021), Vine revealed that he had intended to perform a new stand-up show at the 2020 Edinburgh Fringe but &quot;Breeeep!&quot; was delayed until 2022 due to the covid pandemic. Vine released a CD entitled Tim Vine Edinburgh Festival Diary, recorded each day at the Fringe. The &quot;Breeeep!&quot; tour (2023) sold out at many venues, despite covid, the financial crisis and rail strikes. However, September 21&#x27;s show was relocated after the original venue cancelled due to the RAAC concrete crisis.

Many of Vine&#x27;s jokes have been falsely attributed to Tommy Cooper, being in Cooper&#x27;s style; the West End show about Cooper actually features some of Vine&#x27;s jokes.

===Music===
Vine&#x27;s musical talents, aside from the comedy songs in his act, include playing the guitar, bass, piano and drums.

He occasionally plays the drums at his church. He was in several bands, including alongside his brother Jeremy in The Flared Generation, which &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine described as &quot;the most unfashionable punk band in the country.

Vine has released three novelty music albums, &quot;Pretend Popstar - Fake Hits&quot;, &quot;Dance Floor Gridlock&quot; and &quot;Angus Crunch and the Nepali Flautist&quot;.

Vine is a huge Elvis Presley fan and has been since his death in 1977; he has a picture of the rock and roll legend in every room at home. The megastar was Vine’s Specialist Subject on &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; and his inspiration for performing to &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; on &quot;Comic Relief Does Fame Academy&quot;. In August 2019, Vine’s &quot;Plastic Elvis&quot; tribute act was a sell-out at the Edinburgh Fringe. On 6 January 2020, Plastic Elvis was the Dictionary Corner Guest on Countdown, plugging the 2020 UK tour, which was later postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and rescheduled for autumn 2021 through spring 2022. Although promotional material states &quot;This is NOT a stand up comedy show&quot;, Vine&#x27;s regular support act comic/magician John Archer plays Big Buddy Holly. David Martin, who wrote four of the show&#x27;s Elvis numbers, sings a duet with Plastic. Music is performed by The High Noon Band (UK) with backing vocals by Josie Quinn Abraham.

In May 2020, when the Eurovision Song Contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Vine competed in the &quot;Isolation Song Contest&quot; representing Romania with his home-filmed, self-composed entry &quot;Room Mania&quot;. John Archer also made several appearances in shots from his own house. The event raised around £40,000 for the homeless charity Crisis, Refuge (which supports female domestic abuse survivors) and The Trussell Trust food banks.

===Podcasts and YouTube===
In December 2007, Vine launched his first podcast, &#x27;Tim Vine Celebrates&#x27;. The first episode &quot;Tim Vine Celebrates... Christmas&quot; was released for free on 19 December and includes many previously unheard jokes and humorous songs, as well as an array of comedy characters, mostly voiced by himself.

In autumn 2019, Vine premiered his YouTube channel &quot;Tim Vine TeleVisual (TVTV)&quot;, releasing a short video of sketches every Monday evening for over a year. Additional videos include &quot;Recreating Columbo&quot;, predominantly filmed in Vine&#x27;s home during the pandemic. Vine reprised his Columbo on Countdown, dressing as and impersonating the dishevelled detective in his guest spot (3 February 2022). Further instalments, based on season one, form part of Vine&#x27;s YouTube channel content for 2022.

Similarly, Vine also contributed scenes to the 2020 international project &quot;Jaws We Make&quot;, along with over 100 other superfans of &quot;Jaws&quot;. The entire movie was recreated using a variety of amateur/professional production methods and released on YouTube to celebrate the blockbuster&#x27;s 45th anniversary. The previous year, &quot;Jaws&quot; was Vine&#x27;s Specialist Subject on his second &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; appearance.

===Television===
Tim Vine&#x27;s first TV appearance was on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Pebble Mill&quot; in 1994.

In autumn 1995, Vine hosted the BBC One morning quiz &quot;Housemates&quot;, featuring an endgame called &quot;Up The Garden Path&quot;. The show ran for one season of 25 episodes.

Vine was the first man to appear on Channel 5, alongside Julia Bradbury and the Spice Girls, when the network launched on 30 March 1997. The following day, game show &quot;Whittle&quot; premiered with Vine as host for two seasons March–June and September–December.

From May to August 1997, Vine presented the Channel 4 game show &quot;Fluke&quot; which he devised. The warm-up comedian was Lee Mack.

From 2001 to 2004, Vine co-wrote/starred in both series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Sketch Show&quot; with Lee Mack. Additional material was written by Vine&#x27;s good friend and tour support act, John Archer and, on occasion, Boothby Graffoe and Tim&#x27;s sister Sonya Vine.

From 2006 to 2012, Vine played Timothy Gladstone Adams in Mack&#x27;s BBC One sitcom &quot;Not Going Out&quot;. He returned for a cameo in the 2014 Christmas episode and the series 7 finale as Lee&#x27;s best man.

Since 2009, Vine has made appearances on the Channel 4 game show &quot;Countdown&quot; as a guest in Dictionary Corner.

In 2012, Vine hosted one series of teatime game show &quot;Don&#x27;t Blow the Inheritance&quot; for ITV.

Vine faced &quot;The Beast&quot; Mark Labbett on &quot;The Chase&quot; in 2012 and 2021.

Replacing Mark Williams, Vine portrayed Sebastian Beach in the second and final season of BBC One&#x27;s comedy &quot;Blandings&quot; (2013-2014), based on the books by P. G. Wodehouse.

In 2014 and 2015, Vine appeared in the revival of &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot; as resident comedian alongside Joe Wilkinson.

In 2017, he appeared in two episodes of &quot;Tim Vine Travels Through Time&quot; on BBC One. Regular cast members included Sally Phillips, Mandeep Dhillon, Marek Larwood and John Archer. Special guests included Emma Bunton and Ore Oduba; the latter later starred with Vine in the 2019/2020 &quot;Cinderella&quot; panto at Fairfield Halls, Croydon.

In mid-2018, Vine was a celebrity contestant in 10 episodes of &quot;Taskmaster&quot; series 6, on Dave. His improvisations included measuring a piece of string with a plastic lobster.

In autumn 2018, Vine hosted ITV quiz show &quot;Football Genius&quot;.

Vine has participated in several Comic Relief / Sport Relief charity competitions. In &quot;Comic Relief Does Fame Academy&quot; Vine performed Presley&#x27;s hit &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; (2007) and on &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance for Comic Relief&quot; (2013), Vine was talked out of Presley and given Justin Timberlake;s &quot;Rock Your Body&quot;, making it to the final. In 2015, he was runner-up in &quot;Let&#x27;s Play Darts&quot;, losing out to Mack. Vine returned in 2016 to win it, beating Mike Tindall in the final. For the 2021 telethon, Vine&#x27;s contribution was &quot;Joke In A Box&quot;, entertaining military personnel who had assisted medical centres during the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2022, Vine competed against Kiri Pritchard-McLean in &quot;One Red Nose and Their Dog&quot; with training shown on &quot;Countryfile&quot; (6 March) and the finale broadcast on Comic Relief night (18 March). Filmed at Penrhyn Castle, Wales, this is a variation on the long-running televised competition &quot;One Man and His Dog&quot;.

===Radio and audiobooks===
BBC Radio 4 airs &quot;The Tim Vine Chat Show&quot;, where members of the audience are interviewed, having filled in a form before the show if they wish to be considered for selection. Vine presented one series of four episodes in July 2016, and a Christmas edition on 26 December 2016. A second series of six episodes was broadcast in September and October 2017. Additional Festive and Summer specials aired in 2018 and 2019. The series and specials are available on BBC Sounds and via audiobook (released April 2020). &quot;The Tim Vine Christmas Chat Show&quot; 2021 was recorded on 30 November at The CryerArts Centre, airing 23 December.

In 2017, &quot;Tim Vine Travels Through Time&quot; was broadcast on BBC Radio 2, before moving to BBC One for two televised episodes.

Vine&#x27;s &quot;Punslinger&quot; audiobook is slightly shorter than the DVD version, as some of the visual jokes are omitted.

===Books===
In 2003, Vine contributed to the &quot;Sit-Down Comedy&quot; book, but his first book was released in 2010 entitled &quot;The Biggest Ever Tim Vine Joke Book&quot; containing over 1,000 jokes and puns.

==Awards==

===BAFTA===
Vine&#x27;s ensemble series &quot;The Sketch Show&quot; won the BAFTA for Best Comedy Programme in 2002.

===Fringe awards===
In August 2010, Vine won the prize for the funniest joke of that year&#x27;s Edinburgh Fringe, following a public vote from a judged shortlist. His winning joke was &quot;I&#x27;ve just been on a once-in-a-lifetime holiday. I&#x27;ll tell you what, never again.&quot;

On 25 August 2011, Vine won the prize for the second funniest joke at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. His joke was &quot;Crime in multi-storey car parks. That is wrong on so many different levels.&quot; He was beaten by Nick Helm. In 2012 Vine again came second with the joke &quot;Last night me and my girlfriend watched three DVDs back to back. Luckily I was the one facing the telly.&quot; He was beaten by Stewart Francis. In 2013 Vine came fourth with the joke &quot;My friend told me he was going to a fancy dress party as an Italian island. I said to him &#x27;Don&#x27;t be Sicily&#x27;.&quot; The winner was Rob Auton.

Vine won the award for the second time in 2014 with the joke &quot;I decided to sell my Hoover... well it was just collecting dust.&quot;

===World record===
On 7 October 2004, Vine broke the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for the most jokes told in an hour with 499, beating the previous record of 362 by Estonian Erkki Kolu. Each joke had to get a laugh from the paying audience to count towards the total. The record was subsequently broken on two occasions by Anthony Lehmann and Korukonda Ranga Rao, but Guinness later decided both performers had breached guidelines by using cue cards, so Vine was reinstated. He held the record until November 2014, when Australian comedian Taylor Goodwin, inspired by Vine, told 550 jokes.

==Personal life==
Vine lives in Banstead, Surrey. He is a practising Anglican, and has performed at Spring Harvest Christian festivals.

Vine is a supporter of Sutton United, stating that the first of the team&#x27;s games he attended was an FA Cup match against Middlesbrough during the 1987–88 season. He is also a keen darts fan, having attended several Professional Darts Corporation tournaments along with Lee Mack. Some of these were televised, such as the 2011 World Championships when both Vine and Mack appeared in the crowd. He also plays darts in his spare time. On 31 December 2020, during a live Twitter broadcast, Vine scored 170 in darts in front of a large online audience.

<doc id="1106382" wikidata="Q3401655" url="?curid=1106382" title="Waldo Williams">
<text>Waldo Goronwy Williams (30 September 1904 – 20 May 1971) was one of the leading Welsh-language poets of the 20th century. He was also a notable Christian pacifist, anti-war campaigner, and Welsh nationalist. He is often referred to by his first name only.

==Life==
Waldo Goronwy Williams was born in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, the third child of John Edwal Williams (1863–1934), headmaster of Prendergast primary school in Haverfordwest, and his wife Angharad Williams (1875–1932). His father spoke both Welsh and English, but his mother only spoke English, as did Waldo himself in his early years.

In 1911 Waldo&#x27;s father was appointed head of the primary school at Mynachlog-ddu, Pembrokeshire. There Waldo learnt to speak Welsh. In 1915 his father moved again, to be head of Brynconin School, the primary school at Llandissilio, Pembrokeshire. Waldo was raised as a Baptist and baptised as a member of Blaenconin Baptist Chapel in 1921 at the age of 16.

After attending the grammar school at Narberth, Pembrokeshire, Waldo studied at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he graduated in English in 1926. He then trained as a teacher: he taught in various schools in Pembrokeshire and the rest of Wales and England, including Kimbolton School, Huntingdonshire. He also taught night classes for the Department of Extra-Mural Studies at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Waldo was a friend and supporter of Willie Jenkins (Hoplas), one of the pioneers of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and the Labour Party in Pembrokeshire. Willie Jenkins was a pacifist, who had been imprisoned as a conscientious objector in the First World War; he stood as Labour candidate for Pembrokeshire in four elections between 1922 and 1935. Waldo&#x27;s famous poem &quot;Cofio&quot; (Remembering) was written in 1931 during a visit to Willie Jenkins&#x27;s farm at Hoplas, Rhoscrowther, near Pembroke.

Waldo married Linda Llewellyn in 1941. Her death in 1943 caused him anguish and distress. He never remarried. Later he would describe his two-year marriage as &quot;fy mlynyddoedd mawr&quot; – &quot;my great years&quot;.

Waldo was a conscientious objector in the Second World War, which led to his dismissal from a headmastership. During the Korean War (1950–1953) he refused to pay his income tax on pacifist grounds as a protest against the war and forced military conscription – a protest he continued until compulsory military service ended in 1963 and all the conscripted had been released. His goods were sequestrated by bailiffs and he was twice imprisoned in the early 1960s for refusing to pay his income tax.

Meanwhile in the 1950s he joined the Quakers at Milford Haven.

Waldo Williams&#x27;s volume of poetry &quot;Dail Pren&quot; (Leaves of the Tree) was published in 1956 by Gwasg Gomer. It has been described as the most outstanding work of Welsh language poetry published since 1945.

By the 1950s, partly influenced by his friend D. J. Williams, Waldo Williams had become a supporter of Plaid Cymru. In the 1959 General Election he stood as a parliamentary candidate for Plaid Cymru in the Pembrokeshire constituency, winning 4.32 per cent (2,253) of the votes.

In the late 1960s, Waldo Williams taught Welsh to children of 10–11 at the Holy Name Catholic School, Fishguard, Pembrokeshire. He is said to have been a mesmerising teacher, passionate and enthusiastic, who used wooden silhouettes of farm animals with their names painted in Welsh on one side.

==Death and legacy==
Waldo Williams died in 1971 at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital, Haverfordwest. He was buried at the Blaenconin Baptist Chapel burial ground in Llandissilio, with his parents and his wife Linda. There is a memorial at Rhos-fach, near to his childhood home in Mynachlog-ddu.

In 2019, Waldo Williams Primary School in Haverfordwest was named in his honour.

The Waldo Williams room at Friends House, London, UK is named after him.

==Poetry==

Waldo Williams&#x27;s poetry shows many influences, ranging from William Wordsworth and Walt Whitman to Welsh hymns and the strict alliterative metres of traditional Welsh poetry, known as cynghanedd.

He was within the Welsh tradition of the , poets who served a locality by recording its life and people in verse. He took as his moral anchor the cooperative, harmonious living he saw in the farming communities in the Preseli Hills. A mystical revelation about the unity of humankind, which he experienced in his youth, affected him deeply. Belonging to a humane local community, and desiring that people live together in peace, are constant themes in his poetry. This revelation inspired some of his greatest poetry, including &quot;Mewn dau gae&quot; (In two fields, 1956), perhaps his greatest of all. Other well-known poems of his include &quot;Cofio&quot; (Remembering, 1931), &quot;Y tangnefeddwyr&quot; (The peacemakers, 1941), &quot;Preseli&quot; (1946), and &quot;Pa beth yw dyn?&quot; (What is it to be human? 1952).

<text>Gaucelm (died 834) was a Frankish count and leading magnate in Gothia during the reign of Louis the Pious. He was initially the Count of Roussillon from about 800, but he received Empúries in 817 and was thenceforward the chief representative of imperial authority in that region.

He was the son of William of Gellone and his first wife, Gunegunde (Cunegonde), a Frankish lady. It was from his father, sometime after 790, that he received the county of Roussillon to govern within his father&#x27;s vast holdings in Septimania, centered on Toulouse. At that time, Roussillon included Vallespir. Gaucelm, thoroughly Frankish, supported ongoing war with the Moors and was supported by his brother, Bernard of Septimania. Bera, the Visigothic Count of Razès and Conflent since 790, and Count of Barcelona since 801, supported the local Goth population who desired peace with the Moors to their south.

In January 820, at an assembly in Aachen, Sanila, Gaucelm&#x27;s Gothic lieutenant, probably on orders from Gaucelm, accused Bera of infidelity and perfidy. Bera was deposed, but Gaucelm did not receive his &quot;honores&quot; as he had wanted. However, he did later obtain two of them (Barcelona and Besalú) for his brother Bernard (February 826). The third, Girona, went either to Bernard or Gaucelm himself, but which is unclear. After taking part in the defeat of the son of Bera, Guillemundus, and his lieutenant, Aisso, in Barcelona and Girona (to 827), he received the counties of Razès and Conflent (both previously ruled by Guillemundus). While Bernard was absent from Septimania (April to April, 829 – 830), Gaucelm also ruled his &quot;honores&quot;: Uzès, Nîmes, Melguelh, Agde, Béziers, Narbonne, Besalú, and Barcelona.

In Autumn 831, Pepin I of Aquitaine revolted against his father, Emperor Louis the Pious. Bernard and Gaucelm supported Pepin. Subsequently invading royal forces quickly occupied Bernard&#x27;s lands. In another assembly at Aachen in February 832, the whole region was assigned to Charles the Bald, while Gaucelm and Bernard were deposed later that same year. Gaucelm tried to resist and held out in Ampurias. Finally, in 833, after mediation with Ansegisus, Abbot of Fontanelle, he resigned and retired with Sanila to some familial properties in Burgundy.

Gaucelm and Sanila were killed in the battle of Chalon-sur-Saône the next year, while fighting for Louis the Pious against his son Lothair.

<text>The North Pennines is the northernmost section of the Pennine range of hills which runs north–south through northern England. It lies between Carlisle to the west and Darlington to the east, straddling the borders of the counties of Cumbria, Durham, Northumberland and North Yorkshire. It is bounded to the north by the Tyne Valley and to the south by the Stainmore Gap.

As a sparsely-populated upland region known for its moorland ecology and industrial archaeology, a large part of the North Pennines is protected as a National Landscape and a UNESCO Global Geopark. Several major rivers rise in the North Pennines, including the Tees and Wear, and form the Durham Dales valleys.

==Geology==
The North Pennines are formed from a succession largely of sedimentary rocks laid down during the Palaeozoic era, later intruded by the Whin Sill and affected by glaciation during the Quaternary period.

Mud and volcanic ash deposited during the Ordovician and Silurian periods were buried and subsequently faulted and folded during the Caledonian orogeny, the mudstone becoming slaty. These rocks which are between 500 and 420 million years old are now exposed along the great scarp which defines the western edge of the area and also in an inlier in upper Teesdale. Unseen at the surface but proved in boreholes is the Weardale Granite, a batholith emplaced as molten rock into the slates and other rocks around 400 million years ago. Its presence beneath the region results in it being an upland area since granite is relatively less dense and therefore ‘buoys up’ the North Pennines. This uplifted area is known as the Alston Block and is partly defined by major faults; the Stublick and Ninety-Fathom faults to the north and the Pennine Fault to the west. To the south is the Stainmore Trough.

Overlying the early Palaeozoic rocks and granite are a succession of limestones, shales and mudstones dating from the Carboniferous period. At this time the part of the Earth’s crust which would later become England lay in the equatorial zone and was covered from time to time by shallow tropical seas. Repeated cycles of inundation led to the development of a series of cyclothems; the laying down of layers of limestone, shale and sandstone with occasional coal seams.

Shortly afterwards, (c. 295 million years ago) molten rock once again intruded the sedimentary succession, this time resulting in the emplacement of the doleritic Whin Sill within the Carboniferous sequence. Known as whinstone locally, it baked the rocks with which it came into contact, resulting in the Sugar Limestone found in upper Teesdale. Cooling of the sill itself resulted in the formation of columnar joints, characteristic of its outcrop at places like High Cup. The sill has been dated at between 301 and 294 million years old thus straddling the Carboniferous/Permian boundary.

Around the start of the Permian period, about 290 million years ago, mineral-rich waters, associated with the still warm granite, circulated within the Carboniferous succession and gave rise to mineral-rich veins which have formed the basis of a lead mining industry since at least Roman times.

During the rest of this period and into the Triassic at the start of the Mesozoic era, desert sands characterised the area; these are now seen as the New Red Sandstone of the Vale of Eden, the eastern parts of which form the lower slopes of the Pennine scarp and are within the AONB. There is no bedrock of younger age to be found within the North Pennines; for much of the time since the deposition of the Triassic sandstones, it is likely the area was above sea level and subject to erosion.

A series of major global climate cycles during the current Quaternary period resulted in a series of ice ages, evidence for the last ice age is found within the North Pennines both in term of erosional and depositional features. Glacial till is widespread and drumlin are encountered, both indicative of the presence of moving ice within the landscape. It may be that some higher ground was not over-ridden by ice but remained exposed through subject to harsh climatic conditions. Glacial meltwater carved channels and rivers have continued to shape the landscape in the post-glacial era.

==Economy==
Besides farming, mining and quarrying have been a mainstay of the local economy over centuries. The area has in the past been mined and quarried for minerals such as barytes, coal fluorspar, iron, lead, witherite and zinc.

In 2013, a Canadian mining company were allowed to test drill for zinc around Allenheads and Nenthead. They said the region was sitting on a &quot;world-class&quot; deposit of zinc and predicted that a new mine in the area could produce of zinc ore per year.

==Natural history==
In the North Pennines National Landscape area are: 40% of the UK&#x27;s upland hay meadows; 30% of England&#x27;s upland heathland and 27% of its blanket bog; 80% of England&#x27;s black grouse (and also breeding short-eared owl, ring ouzel, common snipe and common redshank); 36% of the National Landscape area is designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest; red squirrels, otters and rare arctic alpine plants; 22,000 pairs of breeding waders and one of England&#x27;s biggest waterfalls – High Force. The area shares a boundary with the Yorkshire Dales National Park in the south and extends as far as the Tyne Valley, just south of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in the north.

The North Pennines are notable for rare flora and fauna, including wild alpine plants not found elsewhere in Britain. It is also home to red squirrels and diverse birds of prey. The impressive landscape of the North Pennines – from High Force on the River Tees to the sweeping valley of High Cup Gill above Dufton – are the product of millions of years of geological processes. The worldwide significance of the geology found in the area was recognised in 2003 when the National Landscape became Britain&#x27;s first European Geopark. A year later the area become one of the founding members of the UNESCO-assisted Global Geopark family and in 2015 it was accorded official status as a UNESCO Global Geopark. Geoparks are areas with outstanding geological heritage where this is being used to support sustainable development.

Another of the North Pennines&#x27; oddities is that it is home to England&#x27;s only named wind, the Helm Wind. It has caught out many walkers traversing the plateaux around Cross Fell, the Eden Valley fellside, and the valleys between Alston and Dufton.

==Recreation==
One of the many walking routes in the North Pennines is Isaac&#x27;s Tea Trail, a circular route of around the area, running from Ninebanks via Allendale, Nenthead and Alston. In addition to this, a large section of the Pennine Way falls in the AONB, including one of the most celebrated stretches through Teesdale, a lush valley with dramatic river scenery including the twin attractions of High Force and Cauldron Snout.

==Culture==
The great English poet W. H. Auden spent much time in this area and some forty poems and two plays are set here. Auden visited the area in 1919 and &quot;five years later was writing poems about Alston Moor and Allendale.&quot; He referred to the region as his &quot;Mutterland&quot;, his &quot;great good place&quot;, and equated it with his idea of Eden. Scores of Pennine place-names are found in his work, including Cauldron Snout and Rookhope.

==National Landscape==
An area of in the North Pennines was designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1988 for its moorland scenery, the product of centuries of farming and lead-mining. It is the second largest of the 49 AONBs in the United Kingdom after the Cotswolds. The landscape of the North Pennines AONB is one of open heather moors between deep dales, upland rivers, hay meadows and stone-built villages, some of which contain the legacies of a mining and industrial past. In 2023, AONBs were rebranded as National Landscapes, and the area is now marketed as the North Pennines National Landscape, although the legal designation remains unchanged.

There is a small National Landscape visitor centre at Bowlees which aims to provide a gateway to Upper Teesdale and the wider North Pennines.

<text>Johan Nordahl Brun Grieg (1 November 1902 – 2 December 1943) was a Norwegian poet, novelist, dramatist, journalist and political activist. He was a popular author and a controversial public figure. He served in World War II as a war correspondent and was killed while covering a bombing mission to Berlin.

== Background ==
Nordahl Grieg was born in Bergen, Norway. He was the son of Peter Lexau Grieg (1864–1924) and Helga Vollan (1869–1946). He was the brother of Norwegian publisher Harald Grieg (1894–1972) and was distantly related to composer Edvard Grieg. In 1940, he married actress Gerd Egede-Nissen (1895–1988).

He studied at the Royal Frederick University (now the University of Oslo) and spent time travelling abroad, sometimes as a tourist and sometimes as a sailor. 
Receiving the 1924 Norway Scholarship, Grieg spent a year at Wadham College at Oxford, England, studying history and literature. At least one of Grieg&#x27;s poems, &quot;Kapellet i Wadham College&quot; was inspired by his stay there, where he was a contemporary of Cecil Day-Lewis.

== Career ==
=== Poet, playwright and journalist ===

Grieg debuted in 1922 with his first book of poetry &quot;Omkring Kap det gode Haab&quot;, based on his seagoing experiences – as was &quot;Skibet gaar videre&quot; (1924). The latter book aroused controversy for its exposure of sailors&#x27; harsh living and working conditions.

Grieg spent 1927 as a newspaper correspondent in China, where he witnessed firsthand the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communists. The same year Grieg&#x27;s plays &quot;En ung manns Kjaerlighet&quot; and &quot;Barabbas&quot; were produced. The latter was a modern revolutionary interpretation of New Testament character Barabbas. The 1929 poetry collection &quot;Norge i våre hjerter&quot; expressed deep love for his country and his people in their poverty and misery and attracted critical acclaim.

His 1935 play &quot;Vår ære og vår makt&quot; depicted the lives of Norwegian sailors during World War I in which Norway remained neutral and traded with both sides. The work was an attack on the shipping industry&#x27;s exploitation of seafarers. From 1936 to 1937, Grieg published the magazine &quot;Veien Frem&quot;, which initially succeeded in attracting prominent writers, but as the magazine adopted an increasingly Stalinist position relating to the Moscow Trials, most of them severed ties with it and it ceased publication.
His 1937 dramatic play &quot;Nederlaget&quot; was about the Paris Commune. The Spanish Civil War was the subject of &quot;Spansk sommer&quot; (1937) and partly also of &quot;Ung må verden ennu være&quot;, whose plot shifts between Spain and the Soviet Union. The war also inspired the 1936 poem &quot;Til ungdommen&quot;, one of his most well-known works, which was set to music in 1952 by Danish composer Otto Mortensen and was performed on numerous occasions (see Til ungdommen).

=== Communism ===
Compassion for the poor and the exploited led Grieg to join the Norwegian Communist Party. From 1933 to 1935, he lived in the Soviet Union, where he was officially invited to study the techniques of Soviet stage and film. On returning to Norway, he became an ardent supporter of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s policies, and became the chairman of the Friends of the Soviet Union (1935–1940). In 1937, he famously wrote a defence of the Moscow Trials, attacking Norwegian authors who had criticized them. His novel &quot;Ung må verden ennu være&quot; (English: The World Must Still Be Young) was also a defence of Stalin and the Moscow Trials. In many articles, he criticized the supporters of Leon Trotsky, who lived in Norway from 1937 to 1939.

== World War II ==

The outbreak of World War II, and especially the German invasion and occupation of Norway, led Grieg to oppose Stalin&#x27;s policies. In 1939, the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany and, until the 1941 Nazi invasion, instructed Communists worldwide to regard the ongoing war as an &quot;Imperialist&quot; war in which they should not take part. Grieg was a staunch anti-Nazi and Norwegian patriot and committed himself in 1940 to the struggle against the Nazi occupation. In the winter of 1939–40, Grieg served in the Norwegian Army in Finnmark on neutrality guard during the Russo-Finnish Winter War. In 1940, after serving during the Norwegian Campaign against German forces, he escaped to the United Kingdom aboard the same vessel that carried the Norwegian Royal family and the National Gold reserves.

=== War correspondent ===
Once in Britain, Grieg served the Norwegian government in exile, and participated in making patriotic radio programs. He was commissioned in the Norwegian Armed Forces and served as a war correspondent. His work involved visiting and reporting on Norwegian units around Britain. He met Norwegian servicemen on duty in Iceland and other remote outposts. In the summer of 1942 Grieg spent several weeks on the Norwegian island of Jan Mayen in the North Atlantic during which time he wrote the poem &quot;Øya i Ishavet&quot;. As with other war correspondents, he joined operational missions over occupied Europe. In the course of one of these he lost his life, carrying the rank of captain.

=== Final mission ===

On the night of 2–3 December 1943, Grieg was one of several observers for an Allied air raid on Berlin. He was attached to 460 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), which was based at RAF Binbrook. Grieg joined the crew of a Lancaster Mk.III (serial number &quot;LM316&quot;, squadron code &quot;AR-H2&quot;) captained by Flying Officer A. R. Mitchell, RAAF. Berlin was well-defended. It lay in the east of the country, requiring crews to test the limits of their fuel supply and of their own endurance.

The long journey took them over the ranges of many night fighters. 460 Squadron lost five aircraft that night, including &quot;LM316.&quot; 37 airmen had been on board these aircraft, but only eight survived, none of them from &quot;LM316&quot;. The survivors spent the rest of the war in a POW camp. In addition to Grieg, the seven crew members (four Australians and three Britons) were killed in the crash. Grieg was neither the only correspondent shot down that night, nor the only Norwegian.

Grieg&#x27;s burial place went unrecorded after the crash. In the early 2000s, the grave was believed to be located under a highway between Potsdam and Berlin. A new theory emerged in 2013, when journalist Asbjørn Svarstad stated that he believed that Grieg had been first buried in Berlin in 1944, and then exhumed and reburied at the Berlin Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery at Heerstraße in 1949. In response to the new information, the leader of the Norwegian Socialist Left Party, Audun Lysbakken, declared that Grieg should be exhumed and reburied in Bergen, Norway.


== Legacy ==
Grieg became a hero in Norway because of his resistance to the Nazi Occupation. Grieg is still popular in Norway, especially for his anti-fascist poetry. The pre-war controversies in which he was involved were eclipsed by his war record.

Grieg was a friend of English novelist Graham Greene, who wrote about various aspects of Grieg&#x27;s life and wartime career in his 1980 biographical work &quot;Ways of Escape&quot;. The two met when Grieg turned up unannounced at Greene&#x27;s cottage at Chipping Campden in 1931.

In 1945, a collection of his war poems, &quot;Friheten&quot;, was published and remained a best-selling Norwegian poetry collection.

In 1957, a statue of Grieg by Roar Bjorg (1912–1984) was unveiled at Den Nationale Scene in Bergen.

In 1990, the musical &quot;Nordahl Grieg i våre hjerter&quot; written by Erling Gjelsvik with music by Knut Skodvin, debuted in Bergen.

In 2003, a memorial stone was unveiled at the site () where Nordahl Grieg died in Kleinmachnow.

In 2010, Nordahl Grieg High School was opened in the Rådal neighborhood of Bergen.

<doc id="1106405" wikidata="Q100649" url="?curid=1106405" title="Blackwater river">
<text>A blackwater river is a type of river with a slow-moving channel flowing through forested swamps or wetlands. Most major blackwater rivers are in the Amazon Basin and the Southern United States. The term is used in fluvial studies, geology, geography, ecology, and biology. Not all dark rivers are blackwater in that technical sense. Some rivers in temperate regions, which drain or flow through areas of dark black loam, are simply black due to the color of the soil; these rivers are &quot;black mud rivers&quot;. There are also black mud estuaries.

Blackwater rivers are lower in nutrients than whitewater rivers and have ionic concentrations higher than rainwater. The unique conditions lead to flora and fauna that differ from both whitewater and clearwater rivers. The classification of Amazonian rivers into black, clear, and whitewater was first proposed by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1853 based on water colour, but the types were more clearly defined by chemistry and physics by from the 1950s to the 1980s. Although many Amazonian rivers fall clearly into one of these categories, others show a mix of characteristics and may vary depending on season and flood levels.

==Comparison between white and black waters==

Black and white waters differ significantly in their ionic composition, as shown in Table 1. Black waters are more acidic, resulting in an aluminum concentration greater than that of the more neutral white waters. The major difference is the concentrations of sodium, magnesium, calcium, and potassium; these are very low in black waters. This has ecological implications. Some animals need more calcium than is available in blackwaters, so for example, snails, which need much calcium to build shells, are not abundant in blackwaters. The lack of dissolved ions in black waters results in a low conductivity, similar to that of rainwater.

Black and white waters differ in their planktonic fauna and flora. Tables 2 and 3 compare the number of planktonic animals caught in black and white water localities only a few meters apart. The black water was not as extreme an example as the Rio Negro system. However, it can be seen that the black water held greater numbers of rotifers but fewer crustaceans and mites. These crustaceans are important foods for larval fish. The zones where the two waters mix are attractive to ostracods and young fish. These mixing zones tend to have many animals. The abundance is shown in Table3, which compares animals in of water.


==Comparison between clear and black waters==
Blackwater rivers resemble clearwater rivers in having a low conductivity and relatively low levels of dissolved solids, but clearwater rivers have water that often only is somewhat acidic (typical pH ~6.5) and very clear with a greenish color. The main Amazonian clearwater rivers have their source in the Brazilian Plateau (such as Tapajós, Tocantins, Xingu and some right tributaries of the Madeira), but some originate in the Guiana Shield (such as Nhamundá, Paru, and Araguari).

<text>Liberation Day is a day, often a public holiday, that marks the liberation of a place, similar to an independence day. Liberation marks the date of either a revolution, as in Cuba, the fall of a dictatorship, as in Syria, or the end of an occupation by another state, as in the Netherlands, thereby differing from original independence day or creation of statehood, while in Italy commemorates the victory of the Italian resistance movement against Nazi Germany and the Italian Social Republic, puppet state of the Nazis and rump state of the fascists, culmination of the liberation of Italy from German occupation and of the Italian civil war in the latter phase of World War II.

<text>Anne Letitia Dickson CBE (born 18 April 1928) is a former Northern Irish Unionist politician.

==Background==
Born in London, she moved with her family to Northern Ireland at an early age and was educated at Holywood and Richmond Lodge School. After service as the Chair of the Northern Ireland Advisory Board of the Salvation Army she became actively involved in politics for the Ulster Unionist Party. Elected as chair of the Carrick Division Unionist Association she later became a member of the Newtownabbey Urban District Council; serving as vice-chair of the council from 1967 to 1969.

She was then elected as an Ulster Unionist politician for the Carrick constituency in the Parliament of Northern Ireland at Stormont as a supporter of the prime minister Terence O&#x27;Neill. After the dissolution of the Stormont Parliament, she was elected in the 1973 Assembly election for South Antrim as an Independent Unionist candidate having resigned from the UUP in 1972. After the Ulster Unionist party split in 1973/4 over the Sunningdale agreement she joined the newly formed Unionist Party of Northern Ireland (UPNI) along with other supporters of the former Northern Ireland prime minister Brian Faulkner. She retained her seat in South Antrim in the 1975 constitutional convention election. After the retirement of Brian Faulkner she became leader of the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland (UPNI) in 1976, becoming the first woman to lead a major political party in Northern Ireland.
In 1979 she contested the Belfast North constituency in the Westminster election, polling 10% of the vote, the best performance by a UPNI candidate in Northern Ireland, however, her intervention was sufficient to split the moderate Unionist vote resulting in the seat being gained by the DUP. The UPNI disbanded in 1981 after poor results in the local government elections that year and Dickson retired from active politics. Subsequently, she was chair of the Northern Ireland Consumer Council from 1985 to 1990. She was appointed CBE in the 1990 Birthday Honours.

<text>Squint Entertainment was a record label owned by Word Entertainment, started and run by musician and songwriter Steve Taylor in 1997. Squint pushed Sixpence None the Richer to mainstream success with their single &quot;Kiss Me&quot;. The band had been in the CCM genre for several years before that. Other successful bands, such as Chevelle, emerged from Squint&#x27;s brief creative life.

== History ==
It first appeared in the United States in 1997. In an attempt to bring meaningful Christian content to other media, the company started a major film project called &quot;St. Gimp&quot;. The project was abandoned when Taylor was forced out of the company leadership.

The label name was resurrected by Word Entertainment after Taylor&#x27;s departure, to create a new, unrelated label as an avenue for potential crossover acts under their newfound partnership with AOL Time Warner. The only common element was the existence of Sixpence None the Richer on the label&#x27;s roster, due to their existing contract.

<text>Thomas Dunne is an Irish radio broadcaster with Newstalk, and a singer/songwriter with the band Something Happens.

Prior to joining Newstalk, Dunne worked on Today FM, presenting his &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; radio program, which began airing in 1999.

Dunne left Today FM to join Newstalk in August 2008. Dunne&#x27;s former slot on Today FM was taken over by various guest presenters and later by Paul McLoone, who had previously worked as a producer on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, from September 2008.

==Early life==
Dunne graduated from University College, Dublin, with a degree in engineering, before becoming lead singer and songwriter for the band Something Happens from the 1980s until the mid-1990s.

==Radio career==
Dunne became involved in radio, initially presenting a nighttime contemporary Irish music show called Totally Irish on 98FM, taking over from Jim O&#x27;Neill. He moved to early evenings on 98FM before moving to the new national radio station, Today FM in 1999, where he presented his show, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; from 7.00pm to 10.00pm every Monday to Thursday, with assistance from Ann Gleeson. The show itself quickly became well-regarded among music fans in Ireland for playing a mix of alternative, indie rock and new music, frequently airing songs before they received mainstream radio airplay.

Dunne also filled in on &quot;The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show&quot; and &quot;The Ray D&#x27;Arcy Show&quot;, whenever Ian Dempsey and Ray D&#x27;Arcy were on holidays. Former A-House frontman Dave Couse filled in for Dunne when he covered for another DJ during the daytime or if Dunne was on off holidays.

In 2006, Dunne contacted Paul McLoone, the current frontman/lead vocalist with the Northern Irish punk group, The Undertones and offered McLoone a position as producer on his show. McLoone, who had previously worked as a producer on the Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show for five years until 2004, accepted the offer and returned to Today FM.

Two years later, during August 2008, it was announced that Dunne was leaving Today FM to join stablemate station, Newstalk, which also saw Dunne&#x27;s &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; radio show come to an end as well after nine years of being on the air.

Following Dunne&#x27;s departure from Today FM, various guest presenters took over the role on a temporary basis which enabled the guests themselves to play a selection of their own songs. McLoone approached Today FM management himself, asking to be given the opportunity to take over the position temporarily until another replacement could be found. Management agreed, and McLoone stepped down from his role as a producer and became an official radio presenter. Although McLoone&#x27;s tenure as Dunne&#x27;s replacement was originally intended to last for three months, McLoone became the permanent replacement for Dunne due to the increasing popularity of his own radio show, later named &quot;The Paul McLoone Show&quot; and becoming the permanent replacement for &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. A month after Dunne&#x27;s official departure from Today FM, McLoone made his own on-air debut as a radio presenter, during September 2008, with the show itself first airing at 7pm-10pm, then 7pm-midnight before receiving its final time slot of 10pm to midnight, until it was cancelled in 2021.

Dunne moved to Newstalk in September 2008. Newstalk and Today FM are part of the Communicorp Group, owned by Denis O&#x27;Brien and at first, presented his show titled &quot;The Tom Dunne Show&quot; on weekday mornings from 10am to midday before being moved to the nighttime slot due to Pat Kenny&#x27;s arrival. Dunne has appeared on various talk-based shows on Newstalk as an expert contributor for music-based discussions including, for example, following the death of a notable musician.

On Sunday nights, Dunne presents an alternative-leaning music show on Newstalk called &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;.

Newstalk was obliged to issue an on-air apology to Mary Harney after Nell McCafferty&#x27;s comments on &quot;The Tom Dunne Show&quot; in 2010. Nell McCafferty was unapologetic about her remarks.

==Television career==
Dunne&#x27;s first foray into TV presenting was on a short-lived youth-orientated music programme on RTÉ called &quot;Popscene&quot;. Dunne later took over the reins of &quot;Planet Rock Profiles&quot; from Dave Fanning, a programme that has aired on RTÉ, ITV, VH1, and many other TV stations around the world. He presented (along with Jenny Huston) RTÉ&#x27;s coverage of the Electric Picnic music festival in 2006. Dunne also presents a mobile TV show called &quot;The Hive&quot; on the 3 Ireland mobile network. Tom is the unseen narrator of RTÉ&#x27;s The Zoo.

==Other media work==
Dunne occasionally contributes the voice of Bill Cullen to Today FM&#x27;s &quot;Gift Grub&quot;. He writes a weekly column in the &quot;HQ Magazine&quot; City Entertainment supplement of the &quot;Evening Herald&quot;. He has also published three collections of his favourite songs by Irish artists, or artists associated with Ireland, known as the &quot;Tom Dunne Collections&quot;. In early 2006, he released &quot;The Definitive Tom Dunne Vol. 01: Pet Picks 2000-2006&quot;, a compilation of some of the most popular tracks from the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; radio show.

==Awards==
In 2002, Dunne scooped the double of the Best DJ title at the Meteor Music Awards and the same prize from &quot;Hot Press&quot; magazine. He has five PPI Awards.

<doc id="1106435" wikidata="Q3234181" url="?curid=1106435" title="Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation">
<text>Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation is a 1966 book written by psychiatrist Ian Stevenson on claims of spontaneous recall of information about previous lives by young children. The book focuses on twenty cases investigated by the author. It has been translated into seven foreign languages.

==General approach==
Stevenson describes his general approach as following an &quot;almost
conventional pattern&quot;:
Stevenson set up a network of volunteers to find these spontaneous past life recall cases as soon as the children began to speak of them. He then would carefully question both the family of the living child and the family of the deceased to ensure that they had no contact and that no information would be passed between them. He would obtain detailed information about the deceased, including information not fully known to anyone involved, such as details of the will, that he would use to verify that the child actually did know the information required.

The publication of the book was delayed when it was discovered that one of Stevenson&#x27;s interpreters had been accused of dishonesty. Stevenson claimed that the translator was dishonest in some matters, but &quot;did not think the man had deceived him&quot;. Nevertheless, he returned to India, where the interpreter had been used, and examined the cases in question again, with different interpreters. He found them to be even stronger evidence for reincarnation than he had previously thought.

==Published results==

Stevenson concluded that reincarnation was the &quot;best possible explanation&quot; for the following reasons:

* The large number of witnesses and the lack of apparent motivation and opportunity, due to the vetting process, make the hypothesis of fraud extremely unlikely.
* The large amount of information possessed by the child is not generally consistent with the hypothesis that the child obtained that information through investigated contact between the families.
* Demonstration of similar personality characteristics and skills not learned in the current life and the lack of motivation for the long length of identification with a past life make the hypothesis of the child gaining his recollections and behavior through extra-sensory perception improbable.
* When there is correlation between congenital deformities or birthmarks possessed by the child and the history of the previous individual, the hypothesis of random occurrence is improbable.

==Reception==
In 1977, the &quot;Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease&quot; devoted most of one issue to Stevenson&#x27;s work in which psychiatrist Harold Lief described Stevenson as &quot;a methodical, careful, even cautious, investigator, whose personality is on the obsessive side...Either he is making a colossal mistake, or he will be known ... as &#x27;the Galileo of the 20th century. When philosopher Leonard Angel criticized one of the cases in &quot;Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation&quot; personally handled by Stevenson, Stevenson published a rebuttal which argued the critique itself was flawed. Mainstream scientists tended to ignore or dismiss Stevenson&#x27;s research. Some questioned his objectivity, claimed he was credulous and suggested his investigations were flawed.

==Reviews==
Reviews of &quot;Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation&quot; have been published in the &quot;American Journal of Psychiatry&quot;, &quot;British Journal of Psychiatry&quot;, &quot;British Journal of Medical Psychology&quot;, &quot;Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease&quot; and some other journals.

<text>Chivas Regal () is a blended Scotch whisky produced by the Chivas Brothers subsidiary of Pernod Ricard in Scotland.

== History ==
Chivas Regal was created in 1909 by Chivas Brothers Master Blender Charles Stewart Howard as a 25-year-old luxury whisky. 

1939 saw the debut and continued success of Chivas Regal 12-year-old Blended Scotch in the US, at what was to become a global standard proof value of 75 degrees, i.e., 42.8% ABV. (The Americans mark it as 86 proof as they double the ABV to arrive at proof value.) Henceforth, quality, age (generally 12 years), cost (high), popularity (sales) and demography (high-end) would define a &quot;premium&quot; Scotch Whisky.

In 1997, the Chivas Regal range was expanded with the launch of much older whiskies, such as the Chivas Regal 18-year-old, and in 2007 the Chivas Regal 25. Other expressions followed, like the Mizunara in 2014, The Icon in 2015 and the XV in 2018.

In 2001, Pernod Ricard acquired Chivas Brothers. Its sales grew by 61% between 2002 and 2008. In global terms, Chivas Regal recorded volume sales of 4.9 million nine-litre cases in 2012 and 2013, but sales decreased to 4.4 million cases in 2015. It has been the world&#x27;s fourth-best-selling Scotch whisky since 2016. Chivas Regal has been the market-leading Scotch whisky aged 12 years and older in Europe and Asia Pacific.

==Strathisla distillery==

Strathisla distillery in Speyside is home to Chivas Regal and its visitor centre. Founded in 1786 as Milton/Miltown distillery, it is the oldest working distillery in the Highlands of Scotland. The Strathisla single malt is the core malt whisky in all Chivas Regal blends, buttressed by malts from Longmorn, The Glenlivet, Allt-a-Bhainne, Miltonduff Distillery and Braes of Glenlivet (now Braeval) among other distilleries, and grain from Strathclyde distilleries in the Lowlands.

==Awards==
Chivas Regal whiskies have performed well at international spirit ratings competitions. In 2013, the San Francisco World Spirits Competition jury awarded its Double Gold Medals to the Chivas Regal 18yr, 21yr and 25yr whiskies.

<text>Terence Davies (10 November 1945 – 7 October 2023) was a British screenwriter, film director, and novelist. He is best known as the writer and director of autobiographical films, including &quot;Distant Voices, Still Lives&quot; (1988), &quot;The Long Day Closes&quot; (1992) and the collage film &quot;Of Time and the City&quot; (2008), as well as the literary adaptations &quot;The Neon Bible&quot; (1995), &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; (2000), &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; (2011) and &quot;Sunset Song&quot; (2015). His final two feature films were centered around the lives of influential literary figures, Emily Dickinson in &quot;A Quiet Passion&quot; (2016) and Siegfried Sassoon in &quot;Benediction&quot; (2021). Davies was considered by some critics as one of the great British directors of his period.

==Early years==
Terence Davies was born in Kensington, Liverpool, on 10 November 1945, as the youngest of ten children of working-class Catholic parents. Though he was raised Catholic by his deeply religious mother, at the age of 22 he rejected religion and considered himself an atheist. Davies&#x27;s father, whom Davies remembered as &quot;psychotic&quot;, died of cancer when Davies was seven years old. He recalled the period from then until he entered secondary school, at the age of 11, as the four happiest years of his life.

After leaving school at 16, Davies worked for ten years as a shipping office clerk and as an unqualified accountant, before leaving Liverpool in 1971 to attend Coventry Drama School.

==Career==
===Early short films===
While at Coventry, Davies wrote the screenplay for what became his first autobiographical short, &quot;Children&quot; (1976), filmed under the auspices of the BFI Production Board. After that introduction to filmmaking, Davies attended the National Film School, completing &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; (1980), a continuation of the story of his alter ego, Robert Tucker, covering his years as a clerk in Liverpool. He completed the trilogy with &quot;Death and Transfiguration&quot; (1983), in which he speculates about the circumstances of his death. Those works went on to be screened together at film festivals throughout Europe and North America as &quot;The Terence Davies Trilogy&quot;, winning numerous awards. Davies, who was gay, frequently explored gay themes in his films.

===First feature films===
Davies&#x27;s first two features, &quot;Distant Voices, Still Lives&quot; and &quot;The Long Day Closes&quot;, are autobiographical films set in Liverpool in the 1940s and 1950s. In reviewing &quot;Distant Voices, Still Lives&quot;, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that &quot;years from now, when practically all the other new movies currently playing are long forgotten, it will be remembered and treasured as one of the greatest of all English films&quot;. In 2002, critics polled for &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; ranked &quot;Distant Voices, Still Lives&quot; as the ninth-best film of the previous 25 years. Jean-Luc Godard, often dismissive of British cinema in general, singled out &quot;Distant Voices, Still Lives&quot; as an exception, calling it &quot;magnificent&quot;. &quot;The Long Day Closes&quot; was also praised by J. Hoberman as &quot;Davies&#x27;[s] most autobiographical and fully achieved work&quot;.

Davies&#x27;s next two features, &quot;The Neon Bible&quot; and &quot;The House of Mirth&quot;, were adaptations of novels by John Kennedy Toole and Edith Wharton respectively. &quot;The House of Mirth&quot; received favourable reviews, with &quot;Film Comment&quot; naming it one of the ten best films of 2000. Gillian Anderson won Best Performance in the Second Annual &quot;Village Voice&quot; Film Critics&#x27; Poll and the film was named the third best film of 2000 in the same poll.

===Radio projects and &quot;Of Time and the City&quot;===
After completing &quot;The House of Mirth&quot;, Davies intended to make an adaptation of &quot;Sunset Song&quot;, a novel by Lewis Grassic Gibbon published in 1932, as his fifth feature, but financing proved difficult. Scottish and international backers left the project after the BBC, Channel 4 and the UK Film Council each rejected proposals for final funds. Davies apparently considered Kirsten Dunst for the lead role before the project was postponed. Afterwards, he wrote an original romantic comedy screenplay and an adaptation of Ed McBain&#x27;s novel crime novel &quot;He Who Hesitates&quot;, neither of which were produced.

In the interim, Davies produced two works for radio, &quot;A Walk to the Paradise Garden&quot;, an original radio play broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 2001, and a two-part adaptation of Virginia Woolf&#x27;s novel &quot;The Waves&quot;, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2007.

The long interval between films ended with his only documentary, &quot;Of Time and the City&quot;, which was premiered out of competition at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. The work uses vintage newsreel footage, contemporary popular music and Davies&#x27;s narration in a paean to Liverpool. It received positive reviews on its premiere.

In 2010, after completing &quot;Of Time and the City&quot;, Davies produced a third radio project, &quot;Intensive Care&quot;, a personal recollection of his youth and his relationship with his mother.

===Later films===
Davies&#x27;s &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot;, based on the play by Terence Rattigan, was commissioned by the Rattigan Trust. The film was met with widespread acclaim, and Rachel Weisz won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and topped the Village Voice Film Critics&#x27; Poll for best lead female performance. 

Davies finally found financing for &quot;Sunset Song&quot; in 2012, and it went into production in 2014. In October 2014 the film went into post-production. It was released in 2015. During this time, an attempted adaptation of Richard McCann&#x27;s &quot;Mother of Sorrows&quot; did not come to fruition.

Davies&#x27;s next film was &quot;A Quiet Passion&quot;, based on the life of the American poet Emily Dickinson.

His last film, &quot;Benediction&quot; (2021), tells the story of the British war poet and memoirist Siegfried Sassoon.

In February 2023, it was announced that Davies was working on a film adaptation of Stefan Zweig&#x27;s novel &quot;The Post Office Girl&quot;, though the project was subsequently abandoned due to a lack of funding. Davies said he was working on another script in September 2023, the month before he died. After his death, the script was revealed to be based on Janette Jenkins&#x27;s novel &quot;Firefly&quot;, which focuses on the last five days in the life of playwright and composer Noël Coward.

==Personal life==
Davies lived in an 18th-century cottage in Mistley from the early 1990s until his death in 2023. Davies was openly gay and often explored gay themes in his work, though he said his most serious relationship was with a woman in the late 1970s, and that he later went &quot;on to the gay scene for a couple of months&quot; before deciding he was also uninterested in relationships with men. In 2015, he told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he had been celibate for most of his life, adding in another interview with the newspaper in 2022 that he would &quot;prefer to be lonely and on [his] own&quot; than to live a life he &quot;couldn&#x27;t justify&quot; to himself.

Discussing the impact his childhood had on him, Davies described his father as a &quot;psychotic&quot; man who made him feel &quot;terrified all the time&quot;, and that the years following his father&#x27;s death were the happiest of his childhood. He explained, &quot;The one thing I can&#x27;t bear now is atmospheres. I can come into a room full of people and I can tell you who&#x27;s had [an argument]. I always say: if I&#x27;ve upset you, just come out with it. If you cold-shoulder me, I instantly see [my father] sitting in the corner of the parlour and I&#x27;m a seven-year-old again.&quot;

On 7 October 2023, at the age of 77, Davies died of cancer at his home in Mistley.

<text>Tracy Rose Chevalier (born 19 October 1962) is an American-British novelist. She is best known for her second novel, &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot;, which was adapted as a 2003 film starring Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.

==Personal background==
Chevalier was born on 19 October 1962, in Washington, D.C. She is the daughter of Douglas and Helen (née Werner) Chevalier. Her father was a photographer who worked with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; for more than 30 years. Chevalier has an older sister, Kim Chevalier, who resides in Soulan, France; and a brother, Michael Chevalier, who lives in Salida, Colorado. , Chevalier lives in London with her husband, Jonathan Drori.

She graduated from Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1980. After receiving her bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from Oberlin College in 1984, she moved to England, where she began working in publishing. In 1993, she began studying Creative Writing, earning a master&#x27;s degree from the University of East Anglia. Her tutors included novelists Malcolm Bradbury and Rose Tremain.

==Professional background==
Following her graduation from Oberlin College, Chevalier moved to England, where she began working as an editorial assistant with Macmillan&#x27;s Dictionary of Art, then later joined St. James Press, serving as a reference book editor.

Her first novel, &quot;The Virgin Blue&quot;, was published in the UK in 1997 and was chosen by W H Smith for their showcase of new authors. Her second novel, &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot;, was published in 1999. The work, which was based on the famous painting by Vermeer, has been translated into 38 languages. As of 2014, it has sold over five million copies worldwide.
It won the Barnes and Noble Discover Award in 2000. In 2003, a film based on the novel was released, receiving three Academy Award nominations in 2004, along with ten BAFTAs and two Golden Globes. Her 2013 novel, &quot;The Last Runaway&quot;, was honored with the Ohioana Book Award and was chosen for the Richard and Judy Book Club for autumn 2013.

In 2011, Chevalier edited and contributed to &quot;Why Willows Weep&quot;, a collection of short stories by 19 authors, the sale of which raised money for the Woodland Trust, for which her husband served as a trustee.

Other of her works that feature historical figures as characters include William Lobb and Johnny Appleseed in &quot;At the Edge of the Orchard&quot;, and William Blake in &quot;Burning Bright&quot;.

==Memberships==
Chevalier has been involved in representing authors as a member of various community organizations. In 2004, she began serving as the chairperson for the Management Committee for the UK&#x27;s Society of Authors, serving in that capacity for four years. &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; was chosen as one of the books given away in both the US and UK for World Book Night 2013.

<text>The Molniya (now Vympel) R-60 (NATO reporting name: AA-8 &quot;Aphid&quot;) is a short-range lightweight infrared homing air-to-air missile designed for use by Soviet fighter aircraft. It has been widely exported, and remains in service with the CIS and many other nations.

==History==
The R-60 was initially developed for the MiG-23. Work began on the weapon, under the bureau designation K-60 (&quot;izdeliye&quot; 62), in the late 1960s. Series production began in 1973. It entered service with the designation R-60 (NATO reporting name &quot;Aphid-A&quot;).

When introduced, the R-60 was one of the world&#x27;s lightest and most agile air-to-air missiles, with a launch weight of . It has infrared guidance, with an uncooled &quot;Komar&quot; (Mosquito) seeker head. Control is by forward rudders with large rear fins. The distinctive canards on the nose, known as &quot;destabilizers,&quot; serve to improve the rudders&#x27; efficiency at high angles of attack. The R-60 uses a small, tungsten expanding-rod surrounding a high explosive fragmentation warhead. Two different types of proximity fuze can be fitted: the standard &quot;Strizh&quot; (Swift) optical fuse, which can be replaced with a &quot;Kolibri&quot; active radar fuse. Missiles equipped with the latter fuse were designated R-60K.

According to Russian sources, practical engagement range is about , although &quot;brochure range&quot; is at high altitude. The weapon was one of the most agile air-to-air missiles until the advent of thrust vectored missiles like the R-73 and AIM-9X. The R-60 can be used by aircraft maneuvering at up to 9&quot;g&quot; against targets maneuvering at up to 8&quot;g&quot;. A tactical advantage is the short minimum range of only .

Soviet practice was to manufacture most air-to-air missiles with interchangeable IR-homer and semi-active radar homing (SARH) seekers – however, an SARH version of the R-60 was never contemplated due to the small size of the missile which makes a radar-homing version with an antenna of reasonable size impractical.

An inert training version, alternatively designated UZ-62 and UZR-60, was also built.

An upgraded version, the R-60M (NATO reporting name: &quot;Aphid-B&quot;), using a nitrogen-cooled seeker with an expanded view angle of ±20°, was introduced around 1982. Although its seeker is more sensitive than its predecessor, the R-60M has only limited all-aspect capability. Minimum engagement range was further reduced, to only . The proximity fuzes had improved resistance to ECM, although both optical and radar fuzes remained available. The export version with the &quot;Kolibri-M&quot; Radar-fuze are designated R-60MK (NATO reporting name: &quot;Aphid-C&quot;). The R-60M is longer, and has a heavier, continuous-rod warhead, increasing launch weight to . In the R-60M the continuous rod warhead now uses of depleted uranium rods for enhanced fragmentation.

The inert training version of the R-60M was the R-60MU.

Since 1999, a modified version of the weapon has been used as a surface-to-air missile (SAM) as part of the Yugoslav M55A3B1 towed anti-aircraft artillery system. It has also been seen carried on a twin rail mount on a modified M53/59 Praga armored SPAAG of (former) Czechoslovakian origin. These missiles have been modified with the addition of a first stage booster motor, with the missile&#x27;s own motor becoming the sustainer. This was done in lieu of modifying the missile&#x27;s motor for ground launch, as in the case of the US MIM-72 Chaparral.

The current Russian dogfight missile is the R-73 (AA-11 &quot;Archer&quot;), but large numbers of R-60 missiles remain in service.

==Operational history==
===Soviet Union===
On 20 April 1978, two R-60 missiles were fired at Korean Air Lines Flight 902 after a navigational error had caused it to fly into Soviet airspace. One missile hit, detaching 4 meters of the left wing and killing 2 passengers. The plane made an emergency landing on a frozen lake.

On 21 June 1978, a PVO MiG-23M flown by Pilot Captain V. Shkinder shot down two Iranian Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters that had trespassed into Soviet airspace, one helicopter being dispatched by two R-60 missiles and the other by cannon fire.

===Syria===
Several Russian reports affirm the R-60 was widely used during the 1982 Lebanon war, and it was the main weapon used by the Syrians in air-to-air combat. Some Russian reports affirm that the R-60 was the most successful air-to-air missile deployed by the Syrians in Lebanon over the Bekaa Valley. According to Israeli reports, the vast majority of air-to-air combat consisted of visual range dogfights, and this has been also confirmed by Russian sources. The Russian reports also mentioned that several F-4s, F-16s, and IAI Kfirs were destroyed by R-60s among other aircraft. Israel claims some F-4s and Kfirs were lost in 1982, but lists surface-to-air missiles as responsible for all Israeli aircraft losses. However, on 9 June 1982, a Syrian MiG-21 heavily damaged an F-15 using an R-60, but the Israeli aircraft was able to make it back to its base and was subsequently repaired.

===Iraq===
On 11 August 1984, during the Iran–Iraq War, an Iraqi Air Force MiG-23ML shot down an Iranian F-14A piloted by Hashem All-e-Agha using an R-60.

Iraqi MiG-23s damaged two EF-111A Raven by R-60 (missile)s during the Gulf War.

On 19 January 1991, during the Gulf War, Iraqi air force pilot Jameel Sayhood claimed to have shot down a Royal Air Force Panavia Tornado with an R-60 missile. However, the Royal Air Force claimed that the aircraft crashed on 22 January 1991 on a bombing mission in Ar Rutba.

===Angola/Cuba===
On 27 September 1987, during Operation Moduler, two Cuban FAR MiG-23MLs intercepted Captain Arthur Piercy&#x27;s Mirage F1CZ, which was damaged by an R-60 fired head-on by Major Alberto Ley Rivas. The explosion destroyed the aircraft&#x27;s drag chute and damaged the hydraulics. Piercy was able to recover to AFB Rundu, but the aircraft overshot the runway. The impact with the rough terrain caused Piercy&#x27;s ejection seat to fire, but he failed to separate from the seat and suffered major spinal injuries.

===India===
In 1999, an Indian Air Force MiG-21 used an infrared-homing R-60 to bring down a Pakistani Navy Breguet Atlantic which intruded over Indian airspace. Part of the wreckage was found in contested territory, this incident is widely known as the Atlantic incident.

===Ukraine===
In 2024, the R-60 has seen some minor use by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Russian invasion, being reportedly adapted for the surface-to-air role and mounted on Sea Baby naval drones. The R-60M has also been mounted on Su-25s, possibly for shooting down drones.

<text>Dacryoadenitis is inflammation of the lacrimal glands.

==Symptoms ==

* Swelling of the outer portion of the upper lid, with possible redness and tenderness
* Pain in the area of swelling
* Excess tearing or discharge
* Swelling of lymph nodes in front of the ear

===Complications===

Swelling may be severe enough to put pressure on the eye and distort vision. Some patients first thought to have dacryoadenitis may turn out to have a malignancy of the lacrimal gland.

==Causes ==
Acute dacryoadenitis is most commonly due to viral or bacterial infection. Common causes include mumps, Epstein-Barr virus, staphylococcus, and gonococcus.

Chronic dacryoadenitis is usually due to noninfectious inflammatory disorders. Examples include sarcoidosis, thyroid eye disease, and orbital pseudotumor.

==Diagnosis==
Dacryoadenitis can be diagnosed by examination of the eyes and lids. Special tests such as a CT scan may be required to search for the cause. Sometimes biopsy will be needed to be sure that a tumor of the lacrimal gland is not present.

==Prevention==

Mumps can be prevented by immunization. Gonococcus, bacteria can be avoided by the use of condoms. Most other causes cannot be prevented.

==Treatment==

If the cause of dacryoadenitis is a viral condition such as mumps, simple rest and warm compresses may be all that is needed. For other causes, the treatment is specific to the causative disease.

==Prognosis==

Most patients will fully recover from dacryoadenitis. For conditions with more serious causes, such as sarcoidosis, the prognosis is that of the underlying condition.

<doc id="1106464" wikidata="Q5888807" url="?curid=1106464" title="Home Truths">
<text>Home Truths is a weekly BBC Radio 4 programme which began on 11 April 1998 and was usually hosted by the DJ John Peel until his death in October 2004. In the Saturday 910am slot, it gradually became one of Radio 4&#x27;s most successful programmes.

&quot;Home Truths&quot; was a talk show in which the host would interview ordinary people with an extraordinary story to tell. There was also considerable correspondence with its listeners. &quot;Home Truths&quot; was based on a previous show called &quot;Offspring&quot; (which aired from 1995 to 1997), also hosted by Peel. &quot;Home Truths&quot; took essentially the same format as its predecessor but widened the remit from talking about the relationship between parents and children to discussion of all aspects of life.

After Peel&#x27;s death, the programme was presented by a series of guest presenters including Paul Heiney, writer David Stafford, comedian Linda Smith and musician Tom Robinson. However, the programme was axed after the BBC decided that the formula did not work as well without Peel&#x27;s presence.

The last edition of &quot;Home Truths&quot; was presented by David Stafford and was broadcast on 24 June 2006. The slot was taken over the same year by &quot;Saturday Live&quot;.

The series theme tune was Dick Dale&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Trippin&#x27;&quot;.

<doc id="1106477" wikidata="Q1886046" url="?curid=1106477" title="Lumbee">
<text>The Lumbee, also known as People of the Dark Water, are a mixed-race community primarily located in Robeson County, North Carolina, which claims to be descended from myriad Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands who once inhabited the region.

Genetic research has shown some members of the community to be overwhelmingly of African and European descent, with a smaller amount of Native American genetic ancestry. However, historical records show that many of the progenitors of the Lumbee were recorded as being Native Americans.

The Lumbee are shown to have connections with other tri-racial isolate groups, such as the Melungeons.

The Lumbee take their name from the Lumber River, which winds through Robeson County. Pembroke, North Carolina, in Robeson County, is their economic, cultural, and political center. According to the 2000 United States census report, 89% of the population of the town of Pembroke identified as Lumbee; 40% of Robeson County&#x27;s population identified as Lumbee. The Lumbee Tribe was recognized by North Carolina in 1885. In 1956, the U.S. Congress passed the Lumbee Act, which recognized the Lumbees as being American Indians but denied them the benefits of a federally recognized tribe.

All recognized Cherokee tribes in the United States have vehemently opposed the federal recognition of the Lumbee as a Native American tribe.

In 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to advance the tribe&#x27;s recognition.

==History==
Archaeological evidence reveals that the area now known as Robeson County (central to modern Lumbee territory) has been continuously occupied by Native people for at least 14,000 years. Every named era found elsewhere in pre-European-contact North Carolina is also present in the archaeological record of Robeson County (artifacts from Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian cultures). All modern vicinities of Lumbee occupation contain numerous archaeological sites as recent as the Late Woodland period (mid-1700s), and oral traditions about the history of some Lumbee families extend back as far in Robeson County as the mid-1700s.

=== 18th century ===
The earliest European document referring to Indian communities in the area of the Lumber River is a map prepared in 1725 by John Herbert, the English commissioner of Indian trade for the Wineau Factory on the Black River. Herbert identified the four Siouan-speaking communities as the Saraw, Pee Dee, Scavano, and Wacoma. Modern-day Lumbees claim connection to those settlements, but none of the four tribes is located within the boundaries of present-day Robeson County.

A 1772 proclamation by the governor of North Carolina, Arthur Dobbs — derived from a report by his agent, Colonel Griffith Rutherford, head of a Bladen County militia — listed the names of inhabitants who took part in a &quot;Mob Raitously Assembled together,&quot; apparently defying the efforts of colonial officials to collect taxes. The proclamation declared the &quot;Above list of Rogus is all living upon the Kings Land without title.&quot; A later colonial military survey described &quot;50 families a mixt crew, a lawless People possess the Lands without Patent or paying quit Rents.&quot;

Hamilton McMillan wrote that Lumbee ancestor James Lowrie had received sizable land grants early in the century, and, by 1738, possessed combined estates of more than 2,000 acres (810 ha). Adolph Dial and David Eliades claimed that another Lumbee ancestor, John Brooks, held the title to over 1,000 acres (400 ha) in 1735 and that Robert Lowrie gained possession of almost 700 acres (280 ha).

A state archivist noted in the late 20th century that no land grants were issued during these years in North Carolina. The first documented land grants made to individuals claimed to be Lumbee ancestors did not take place until the 1750s, more than a decade later. None of the various petitions for federal recognition by the Lumbee people relied on the McMillan, Dial, or Eliades claims.

Land records show that in the second half of the 18th century, persons since identified as ancestral Lumbees began to take titles to land near Drowning Creek (Lumber River) and prominent swamps such as Ashpole, Long, and Back. According to James Campisi, an anthropologist retained by the Lumbee tribe to aid their petition for federal recognition, the area &quot;is located in the heart of the so-called old field of the Cheraw documented in land records between 1737 and 1739.&quot; In 1771, a convicted felon, by the name of Winsler Driggers, captured &quot;near Drowning Creek, in the Charraw settlement,&quot; was reported as hanged under the Negro Act. That mention, along with no evidence that a new settlement was established or the old settlement was abandoned, is not sufficient to confirm that the settlement on Drowning Creek in 1754 was a Cheraw settlement.

Pension records for veterans of the American Revolutionary War in Robeson County listed men with surnames later associated with Lumbee families, such as Samuel Bell, Jacob Locklear, John Brooks, Berry Hunt, Thomas Jacobs, Thomas Cummings, and Michael Revels. In 1790, other men with surnames since associated with Lumbee-identified descendants, such as Barnes, Braveboy (or Brayboy), Bullard, Chavers (Chavis), Cumbo, Hammonds, Lowrie (Lowry/Lowery), Oxendine, Strickland, and Wilkins, were listed as inhabitants of the Fayetteville District; they were all &quot;Free Persons of Color&quot; in the first federal census.

===Antebellum===
Following Nat Turner&#x27;s slave rebellion of 1831, the state legislature passed amendments to its original 1776 constitution, abolishing suffrage for free people of color. This was one of a series of laws passed by North Carolina whites from 1826 to the 1850s which the historian John Hope Franklin characterized as the &quot;Free Negro Code&quot;, creating restrictions on that class. Free people of color were stripped of various civil and political rights which they had enjoyed for almost two generations. They could no longer vote or serve on juries, bear arms without a license from the state, or serve in the state militia. As these were obligations traditionally associated with citizenship, they were made second-class citizens.

In 1853, the North Carolina Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the state&#x27;s restrictions to prevent free people of color from bearing arms without a license. Noel Locklear, identified as a free man of color in &quot;State v. Locklear&quot;, was convicted of being in illegal possession of firearms. In 1857, William Chavers from Robeson County was arrested and charged as a free person of color for carrying a shotgun without a license. Chavers, like Locklear, was convicted. Chavers promptly appealed, arguing that the law restricted only &quot;free Negroes,&quot; not &quot;persons of color from Indian blood.&quot; The appeals court reversed the lower court, finding that &quot;free persons of color may be, then, for all we can see, persons colored by Indian blood&quot;.

===Civil War===
A yellow fever epidemic in 1862–1863 killed many slaves working on the construction of Fort Fisher near Wilmington, North Carolina, then considered to be the &quot;Gibraltar of the South&quot;. As the state&#x27;s slave owners resisted sending more slaves to Fort Fisher, the Confederate Home Guard intensified efforts to conscript able-bodied free persons of color as laborers. There does not appear to be documentation of conscription among the free people of color in Robeson County.

Despite the widespread sympathies among the Indian community for the plight of the participants in this guerilla warfare, nearly 150 Lumbee ancestors voluntarily enlisted in the Confederate Infantry, including the nephew-in-law of Henry Berry Lowry described below.

====Lowry War====

Early in the Civil War, North Carolina turned to forced labor to construct its defenses. Several Lowrie cousins had been conscripted as laborers to help build Fort Fisher, near Wilmington. Henry Berry Lowrie and several of his relatives took to the swamps where Indians resorted to &quot;lying out&quot; to avoid being rounded up by the Home Guard and forced to work as impressed laborers.

The Lowrie gang, as it became known, resorted to crime and conducting personal feuds, committing robberies and murders against white Robeson County residents and skirmishing with the Confederate Home Guard. They grew bolder as the war turned against the Confederacy. In December 1864, the Lowrie gang killed James P. Barnes after he had drafted workers, including the Lowries, for work on local defenses. Barnes had earlier accused Henry&#x27;s father, Allen Lowrie, of stealing hogs. Next, the gang killed James Brantley Harris, a Confederate conscription officer who had killed a Lowrie relative.

After the Civil War, the Lowrie gang continued their insurgency, committing robberies and murders. The authorities&#x27; raids and attempts to capture gang members became known as the Lowry War. Lowrie&#x27;s gang continued its activities into the Reconstruction Era. Republican governor William Woods Holden declared Lowrie and his men outlaws in 1869, and offered a $12,000 reward for their capture: dead or alive. Lowrie responded with more revenge killings. Eluding capture, the Lowrie gang persisted after Reconstruction ended and conservative white Democrats gained control of North Carolina government, imposing segregation and white supremacy.

In February 1872, shortly after a raid in which he robbed the local sheriff&#x27;s safe of more than $28,000, Henry Berry Lowrie disappeared. It is claimed he accidentally shot himself while cleaning his double-barrel shotgun. As with many folk heroes, the death of Lowrie was disputed. He was reportedly seen at a funeral several years later.

===State recognition as Indians===
During Reconstruction, the legislature established public education for the first time, providing for white and black schools. All children of color were assigned to black schools, which were dominated by the children of freedmen (freed slaves). The Indian people of Robeson County had always been free and did not socially associate or interact with Blacks. They refused to send their children to school with the free Blacks and demanded for separate Indian schools. In the 1880s, as the Democratic Party was struggling against the biracial Populist movement which combined the strength of poor whites (Populist and Democrats) and blacks (mostly Republicans), Democratic state representative Hamilton McMillan proposed to have the state recognize these Indian people of Robeson County as the &quot;Croatan Indians&quot; and to create a separate system of Croatan Indian schools. By the end of the 19th century, the &quot;Indians of Robeson County&quot; (as they then identified) established schools in eleven of their principal settlements.

Following the Reconstruction Era, white-dominated legislatures across the South imposed codified racial segregation into law. In North Carolina, the law effectively recognized only whites and free persons of color regardless of race; therefore people of mixed or Native ancestry had no other option than to attend black schools established for and in which most students were the children of freedmen. Since they and their ancestors had always been free, most of the state&#x27;s Indian population, including the Lumbee, refused to send their children to those schools established for blacks by the Freedmen’s Bureau. In 1887, Democratic state representative Hamilton McMillan supported an effort to charter separate schools for Indians.

====An Indian school system====

In 1887, the Indians of Robeson County petitioned the state legislature to establish a normal school to train Indian teachers for the county&#x27;s Indian schools. With state permission, they raised the requisite funds, along with some state assistance, which proved inadequate. Several tribal leaders donated money and privately held land for schools. Robeson County&#x27;s Indian Normal School eventually developed as Pembroke State University and subsequently as the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.

In 1899, North Carolina Congressman John D. Bellamy introduced the first bill in Congress to appropriate federal funds to educate the Indian children of Robeson County. They introduced another bill a decade later, and yet another in 1911. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, T. J. Morgan, responded to Congress and the Croatan Indians, writing that, &quot;so long as the immediate wards of the Government [Indians on reservations] are so insufficiently provided for, I do not see how I can consistently render any assistance to the Croatans or any other civilized tribes.&quot; [sic, civilized tribes were defined in contrast to Indians on reservations, who were wards of the government.]

By the first decade of the 20th century, a North Carolina Representative introduced a federal bill to establish &quot;a normal school for the Indians of Robeson County, North Carolina,&quot; to be paid for by the federal government. Charles F. Pierce, U.S. Supervisor of Indian Schools in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, opposed the legislation since, &quot;[a]t the present time it is the avowed policy of the government to require states having an Indian population to assume the burden and responsibility for their education, so far as is possible.&quot;

====Ku Klux Klan conflict====
During the 1950s, the Lumbee made nationwide news when they came into conflict with the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist terrorist organization, then headed by Grand Dragon James W. &quot;Catfish&quot; Cole. Cole began a campaign of harassment against the Lumbee, claiming they were &quot;mongrels and half-breeds&quot; whose &quot;race mixing&quot; threatened to upset the established order of the segregated Jim Crow South. After giving a series of speeches denouncing the &quot;loose morals&quot; of Lumbee women, Cole burned a cross in the front yard of a Lumbee woman in St. Pauls, North Carolina, as a &quot;warning&quot; against &quot;race mixing&quot;. Emboldened, Cole called for a Klan rally on January 18, 1958, near the town of Maxton. The Lumbee, led by veterans of the Second World War, decided to disrupt the rally.

The &quot;Battle of Hayes Pond&quot;, also known as &quot;the Klan Rout&quot;, made national news. Cole had predicted more than 5,000 Klansmen would show up for the rally, but fewer than 100 and possibly as few as three dozen attended. Approximately 500 Lumbee, armed with guns and sticks, gathered in a nearby swamp, and when they realized they possessed an overwhelming numerical advantage, attacked the Klansmen. The Lumbee encircled the Klansmen, opening fire and wounding four Klansmen in the first volley, none seriously. The remaining Klansmen panicked and fled. Cole was found in the swamps, arrested and tried for inciting a riot. The Lumbee celebrated the victory by burning Klan regalia and dancing around the open flames.

The Battle of Hayes Pond, which marked the end of Klan activity in Robeson County, is celebrated as a Lumbee holiday.

===Early efforts to gain federal recognition===
The people achieved state recognition as &quot;Croatan Indians&quot; in 1885. They first petitioned the federal government for recognition in 1888, but were rejected due to the Bureau of Indian Affairs&#x27; lack of funding. In 1911, at the request of the tribe, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation changing their name to &quot;Indians of Robeson County.&quot; In 1913, future North Carolina Governor Angus McLean supported renaming the tribe to &quot;Cherokee Indians of Robeson County&quot; despite objections from some Lumbee people. The tribe had previously petitioned for federal recognition as &quot;Cherokee&quot; Indians, but it was denied.

From 1913 to 1932, North Carolina legislators introduced bills in Congress to change the name of the people to Cherokee and gain federal recognition, but did not succeed.

In 1915, the report of Special Indian Agent O.M. McPherson of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, was sent to the North Carolina legislature. He primarily reported on the Cherokee in the state. He noted that the Indians of Robeson County had developed an extensive system of schools and a political organization. He thought that, as state-recognized Indians, they were eligible to attend federal Indian schools. But, as they were highly assimilated, spoke English, and already worked in the common state culture, he doubted that the federal Indian schools could meet their needs. Congress did not provide any additional funding to support education for Indians in North Carolina.

In 1924, the Cherokee Indians of North Carolina petitioned for federal recognition as &quot;Siouan Indians&quot;; their request was rejected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. That same year, representative Homer L. Lyon introduced legislation to federally recognize the Lumbee as the &quot;Cherokee Indians of Robeson and Adjoining Counties,&quot; but the bill failed after opposition from Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke. In 1932, senator Josiah W. Bailey introduced a bill to recognize the Lumbee as Cherokee, but it failed after opposition from the Cherokee Nation and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.

====Federally commissioned reports====
In 1912, legislation was introduced to the US Senate to establish a school for the Indians of Robeson County. When the bill was sent to committee, it requested information from the Department of the Interior. The Indian Office sent Charles F. Pierce, the Supervisor of Indian Schools, to Robeson County to conduct a study of the tribe. Pierce reported that the state and county were providing funds to educate the 1,976 school-age Indian children. He also stated in his report that &quot;one would readily class a large majority [of the Lumbee] as being at least three-fourths Indian.

On April 28, 1914, the Senate called for an investigation into the status and conditions of the Indians of Robeson and adjoining counties. The Indian Office sent Special Indian Agent O.M. McPherson to the county to obtain information regarding the educational system of the tribe. In his report, submitted to the Senate on January 4, 1915, he wrote:

While these Indians are essentially an agricultural people, I believe them to be as capable of learning the mechanical trades as the average white youth. The foregoing facts suggest the character of the educational institution that should be established for them, in case Congress sees fit to make the necessary appropriation, namely the establishment of an agricultural and mechanical school, in which domestic science shall also be taught.

Anthropologist John R. Swanton reported on possible origins of the Indians of Robeson County in his work on Southeast Indians. He wrote:

The evidence available thus seems to indicate that the Indians of Robeson County who have been called Croatan and Cherokee are descended mainly from certain Siouan tribes of which the most prominent were the Cheraw and Keyauwee, but they probably included as well remnants of the Eno, and Shakori, and very likely some of the coastal groups such as the Waccamaw and Cape Fears. It is not improbable that a few families or small groups of Algonquian or Iroquoian may have cast their lot with this body of people, but contributions from such sources are relatively insignificant. Although there is some reason to think that the Keyauwee tribe actually contributed more blood to the Robeson County Indians than any other, the name is not widely known, whereas that of the Cheraw has been familiar to historians, geographers and ethnologists in one form or another since the time of De Soto and has a firm position in the cartography of the region. The Cheraws, too, seem to have taken a leading part in opposing the colonists during and immediately after the Yamasee uprising. Therefore, if the name of any tribe is to be used in connection with this body of six or eight thousand people, that of the Cheraw would, in my opinion, be most appropriate.

In 1935, Indian Agent Fred Baker was sent to Robeson County in response to a proposed resettlement project for the Cherokee Indians of Robeson County. At the time, the people were attempting to organize as a tribe under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, which largely applied to Indians on reservations to encourage their self-government.

Baker reported:

I find that the sense of racial solidarity is growing stronger and that the members of this tribe are cooperating more and more with each other with the object in view of promoting the mutual benefit of all the members. It is clear to my mind that sooner of later government action will have to be taken in the name of justice and humanity to aid them.

D&#x27;Arcy McNickle, from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, came to Robeson County in 1936 to collect affidavits and other data from people registering as Indian under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. McNickle stated, &quot;there are reasons for believing that until comparatively recently some remnant of language still persisted among these people.&quot;

In the 1960s, Smithsonian ethnologists William Sturtevant and Samuel Stanley described the Lumbee as &quot;larger than any other Indian group in the United States except the Navajo&quot;, and estimated their population as 31,380 Lumbee (from North and South Carolina) in 1960.

====Indian New Deal====
The federal Indian Reorganization Act in 1934 was chiefly directed at Native American tribes on reservations. It encouraged them to re-establish self-government, which had been diminished since the founding of reservations and the supervision by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.

At this time, the Indians of Robeson County renewed their petition for federal recognition as a tribe. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) sent John R. Swanton, an anthropologist from the Bureau of American Ethnology, and the Indian Agent Fred Baker to evaluate the claim of the Indians of Robeson County to historical continuity as an identified Indian community. In 1934, the future Lumbee revived their claim to Cherokee identity, joining the National Congress of American Indians under the name, &quot;Cherokee Indians of Robeson County.&quot;

Swanton speculated that the group were more likely descended in part from Cheraw and other eastern Siouan tribes, as these were the predominant Native American peoples historically in that area. The Indians of Robeson County split in terms of how they identified as Native Americans: one group supported the Cheraw theory of ancestry. The other faction believed they were descended from the Cherokee, although the tribe had historically occupied territory in the mountains and western part of the state rather than the area of Robeson County. North Carolina&#x27;s politicians abandoned support for the federal recognition effort until the tribal factions agreed on their identity.

In 1952, under the leadership of D.F. Lowrie, the tribe voted to adopt the name &quot;Lumbee.&quot; The North Carolina legislature recognized the tribe&#x27;s name change to the &quot;Lumbee Indians of North Carolina&quot; in 1953. The tribe petitioned again for federal recognition.

====Lumbee Act====
In 1955, congressman F. Ertel Carlyle introduced The Lumbee Act to recognize the &quot;Lumbee Indians of North Carolina.&quot; It was passed into by Congress as H.R. 4656 () in 1956 and signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Senate inserted a compromise that withheld full recognition as a federally recognized tribe and prevented the tribe from being federally recognized or receiving federal benefits designated for tribal governments. The Lumbee Act designated the Indians of Robeson, Hoke, Scotland, and Cumberland counties as the &quot;Lumbee Indians of North Carolina.&quot;

It provided further, &quot;Nothing in this Act shall make such Indians eligible for any services performed by the United States for Indians because of their status as Indians.&#x27;&quot; It also forbids a government-to-government relationship between the federal government and the Lumbee as well as forbidding them from applying through the BARS, the Bureau of Indian Affairs administrative process to gain recognition. This restriction as to eligibility for services was a condition which tribal representatives agreed to at the time in order to achieve status as a recognized tribe and have the Lumbee name recognized. The Lumbee had essentially assimilated into early colonial life prior to the formation of the United States. They lived as individuals, as did any other colonial and U.S. citizens. Lumbee spokesmen repeatedly testified at these hearings that they were not seeking federal financial benefits; they said they only wanted a name designation as Lumbee people.

===Petitioning for full federal recognition===
In 1987, the Lumbee petitioned the United States Department of the Interior for full federal recognition. This is a prerequisite to receive the financial benefits accorded federally recognized Native American tribes. The latter have generally been those tribes who had signed treaties with the federal government and had reservations established, and a history of a tribal relationship with the federal government. The petition was denied in 1989 because of the Lumbee Act.
The Lumbee resumed lobbying Congress, testifying in 1988, 1989, 1991 and 1993 in efforts to gain full federal recognition by congressional action. All of these attempts failed in the face of opposition by the Department of Interior, the recognized Cherokee tribes (including North Carolina&#x27;s Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians), some of the North Carolina Congressional delegation, and some representatives from other states with federally recognized tribes. Some of the North Carolina delegation separately recommended an amendment to the 1956 Act that would enable the Lumbee to apply to the Department of Interior under the regular administrative process for recognition. In 2004 and 2006 the tribe made renewed bids for full recognition, to include financial benefits.

In 2007, US Senator Elizabeth Dole from North Carolina introduced the Lumbee Recognition Bill. It was not enacted. Lumbee Tribal Chairman Jimmy Goins appeared before the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in September 2007 to lobby for federal recognition of the tribe.

In January 2009, US Representative Mike McIntyre introduced legislation (H.R. 31) to grant the Lumbee full federal recognition. The bill gained support of more than 180 co-sponsors, including both North Carolina US Senators, Richard Burr and Kay Hagan. In June 2009, the United States House of Representatives voted 240 to 179 for federal recognition for the Lumbee tribe, acknowledging that they are descendants of the historic Cheraw tribe. The bill went to the United States Senate. In October 2009, the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs approved a bill for federal recognition of the Lumbee that also included a no-gaming clause. The Senate adjourned for 2010 without taking action on the bill.

In 2021, Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii sought a hearing on Lumbee federal recognition. In April 2021, US Representative G. K. Butterfield introduced legislation to grant the Lumbee full federal recognition (H.R. 2758). The bill passed the House of Representatives in November 2021. The Senate never acted. Another attempt at federal recognition passed the House but not the Senate. On December 17, 2024 Bruce Westerman of Arkansas introduced a bill sponsored by David Rouzer of Wilmington, North Carolina. The House approved 311-96, but the Senate would not be able to take action if Congress adjourned as planned.

====2020 presidential election====
During the 2020 United States presidential election campaign, then-candidate Joe Biden announced, on October 8, 2020, his support for federal recognition of the Lumbee tribe by pledging his backing to the Lumbee Recognition Act. On October 21, 2020, President Donald Trump announced his support for federal recognition of the tribe via the same legislation. The following weekend, Trump held a rally in Robeson County to shore up support among Native Americans. During the rally, Trump stated that &quot;[The] Lumbee Nation is forgotten no more!&quot; Trump&#x27;s rally was significant in that it was the first official visit to Robeson County by a sitting US President in history.

Historically most of Robeson County had trended Democratic, voting for Barack Obama by an 18 point margin in 2012. However, Donald Trump carried the county narrowly in 2016, winning by a 5 point margin over Hillary Clinton. In 2020, his margin of victory increased dramatically to an 18 point victory over Biden. Many attribute this swing in Trump&#x27;s favor to his visit and explicit support for recognition of the tribe by the federal government.

==Theories of origins==
===Lost Colony of Roanoke===
In 1888, Hamilton McMillan proposed the Native inhabitants of Robeson County were descendants of England&#x27;s &quot;Lost Colony of Roanoke&quot;, who intermarried with what he described as the &quot;Croatan Indians.&quot; The Roanoke colony disappeared during a difficult winter, but the colonists reportedly left the word &quot;Croatan&quot; carved into a tree, hence the name MacMillan gave to the proto Lumbee.

MacMillan&#x27;s theory may have been part of a cynical effort to woo Lumbee voters to the Democratic Party by creating a segregated Indian school system separate from the school system for African Americans.

By the early 1900s, Robeson County whites used &quot;Cro&quot; as a racial epithet to describe their &quot;Indian&quot; neighbors. The Lost Colony theory of origins fell out of favor in the early twentieth century. &quot;Croatan&quot; was dropped from their name and they became known as the &quot;Indians of Robeson County&quot; in 1911.

Lumbee historian Adolph Dial continued to advocate for the lost colony theory until his death in the 1990s. Lumbee historian Malinda Mayor Lowery &quot;is highly skeptical&quot; of the theory.

===Cherokee descent===
The proto Lumbee first began identifying as Cherokee Indians in 1915, when they changed their name to the &quot;Cherokee Indians of Robeson County.&quot; Four years earlier, they had changed their name from the &quot;Croatan Indians&quot; to the generic &quot;Indians of Robeson County.&quot; But the Cherokee occupied territory much further to the west and in the mountains during the colonial era.

In his unpublished 1934 master&#x27;s thesis, graduate student Clifton Oxendine theorized that the Lumbee descended from Iroquoian-speaking Cherokee. Citing &quot;oral traditions,&quot; Oxendine suggested that the Lumbee were the descendants of Cherokee warriors who fought with the British under Colonel John Barnwell of South Carolina in the Tuscarora campaign of 1711–1713. He said the Cherokee settled in the swamps of Robeson County when the campaign ended, along with some Tuscarora captives.

The Oxendine theory of Cherokee origin has been uniformly rejected by mainstream scholars. First, no Cherokee warriors are listed in the record of Barnwell&#x27;s company. Second, the Lumbee do not speak Cherokee or any other Indian language. Third, Oxendine&#x27;s claims of oral traditions are completely unsubstantiated; no such oral traditions survive or are documented by any other scholar.

The Lumbee have abandoned this theory in their documentation supporting their effort to obtain federal tribal recognition. The federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians categorically rejects any connection to the Lumbee, dismissing the Oxendine claims as &quot;absurd&quot; and disputing even that the Lumbee qualify as Native American.

===Cheraw descent===
Shortly after abandoning the Croatan label and changing their name to the generic &quot;Indians of Robeson County&quot;, the proto Lumbee seized on the speculations of Indian agent McPherson that they may be related to the defunct Cheraw, a band of Siouan-speaking Indians that had been reduced by war and disease to 50 or 60 individuals by 1768.

The 1915 &quot;McPherson Report&quot; said in reference to the Cheraw (quoting the &quot;Handbook of American Indians&quot;, 1906):

Their numbers in 1715, according to Rivers, was 510, but this estimate probably included the Keyauwee. Being still subject to attack by the Iroquois, they finally—between 1726 and 1739—became incorporated with the Catawba ... They are mentioned as with the Catawba but speaking their own distinct dialect as late as 1743 (Adair). The last notice of them in 1768, when their remnant, reduced by war and disease to 50 or 60, were still living with the Catawba.

The Catawba are a federally recognized tribe. The McPherson Report does not explain how or when the remaining four or five dozen Cheraw identified in 1768 separated from the Catawba and became the ancestors of the Lumbee.

===Siouan descent===
After repeated rejections under the Croatan, Cherokee and Cheraw labels, the proto Lumbee petitioned the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1924 for recognition as &quot;Siouan&quot; Indians. This refers to Siouan language-speaking groups, not the Sioux, an Indigenous people of the Great Plains. This petition was rejected largely on the grounds that Siouan is a language family, not a tribe. Moreover, there was no record of the Lumbee or their ancestors having ever spoken a Siouan or any other Indian language.

===Keyauwee descent===
In 1933, John Swanton wrote that the Siouan-speaking Keyauwee and Cheraw of the Carolina Piedmont were the most likely Indian ancestors of the people known from 1885 to 1912 as Croatan Indians and later as the Indians of Robeson County. He suggested that surviving descendants of the Waccamaw and the Woccon likely lived in the central coastal region of North Carolina. In the 21st century, these tribes are extinct as groups, except for a small band of Waccamaw that live on Lake Waccamaw and have been recognized by the state.

Swanton traced the migration of Southeast tribes. In addition to the Keyauwee, Cheraw, Bear River, Waccamaw, and Woccon already mentioned, he noted that the Eno and Waxhaw migrated from Piedmont South Carolina northeast to the north-central part of North Carolina, then back south again to a point on the Pee Dee River just south of the border of the two Carolinas.

By the 1770s, remnant Indians from the once distinct tribal communities of the Cheraw, Keyauwee, Hatteras, Waxhaw, Sugaree, Eno and Shakori gathered along the Lumbee River, near the border that now divides North and South Carolina. Some of these Indians moved further southward to join with the few surviving Catawba, but the majority settled near the pines, web of wetlands, and river that bear the name of the Lumbee. Over time in a process of ethnogenesis, they identified as a common people.

===Multiple tribes theory===
Lumbee historian Malinda Mayor Lowery proposed that the Lumbee people were most likely descended from the members of several other tribes who settled in the swamplands around Robeson County. Lowery argues that Cheraw, Saponi, Hatteras, Tuscarora and Cape Fear Indians settled in the area during the 18th and 19th centuries and adopted English as a lingua franca. Over time the various refugees merged into the Lumbee.

=== Authenticity and doubts of origins ===
Due to their lack of evidence of Native American ancestry and other conventional Indigenous cultural markers such as a unique language, Lumbee people are often confronted with doubts concerning the validity of their claims to Indigenous status. Some white and black residents of Robeson County have expressed doubts about their origins, asserting that the Lumbee are descendants of white and black people who do not want to be viewed as black due to discrimination based on skin tone. Some federally recognized tribes have endorsed the extension of recognition to the Lumbee, while others have opposed it, accusing the Lumbee of making fraudulent claims to Indigenous ancestry.

Several tribes from the Western United States also promulgate the belief that the Lumbee are a mixed, mostly African-descent group. Historian Malinda Maynor Lowery, a member of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, criticized the usefulness of such tests, stating that the testing companies lack base samples of the Lumbee&#x27;s Indigenous ancestors&#x27; DNA with which the results can be compared. Some Lumbee report that the doubts about their status have caused emotional and psychological harm in their community.

==Culture and traditions==
=== Surnames ===
Locklear, Oxendine, Lowry, Hunt, Chavis, Brayboy, Freeman and Bullard are common Lumbee surnames.

===Language===
Lumbee people speak both mainstream varieties of English and a vernacular form, Lumbee English. The latter is not a Native American language, but rather a form of American Indian English. In 2020, the ISO 639-3 language code &quot;lmz&quot; was retired from use, as it was determined that no separate Lumbee language has ever existed. Linguists have speculated that the ancestors of the Lumbees had been Native peoples who had originally spoken the Cheraw dialect of the Eastern Siouan language prior to adopting English sometime before the early 18th century. Lumbee ancestors encountered English-speaking European settlers and adopted their language much earlier than other Native American groups. The Lumbee Act of 1956 specifically mentioned the dialect as a defining attribute of the people.

By 1730, English settlers were surprised at the presence of a large English-speaking Native American tribe. The Lumbee&#x27;s lack of a traditional language led to extra difficulty in gaining federal recognition.

Lumbee dialectal English descends from the English spoken by the British English, Highland Scots, and Scots-Irish. Probably due to this heritage, it shares similarities with the High Tider accent found in the Outer Banks, namely in use of the sound where other English speakers use , the use of the word &#x27; (&#x27;to mess up&#x27;), and the grammatical use of &quot;weren&#x27;t&quot; (e.g. &quot;she weren&#x27;t here&quot;). Lumbee dialect also makes use of several unique words and phrases: &quot;chauld&quot; (&#x27;embarrassed&#x27;); &quot;on the swamp&quot; (&#x27;in the neighborhood&#x27;); &#x27; (sling shot); and &quot;bog&quot; (a serving of chicken and rice). Grammatically, Lumbee dialect employs the word &quot;bes&quot; as a verb form (e.g. &quot;it bes really crowded&quot;).

There is a variation in the use of these elements among Lumbee people; some frequently use most of the vernacular&#x27;s unique characteristics, while others use few of them but easily understand their meaning. The vernacular has also evolved over time, with older speakers frequently using the sound and &quot;a&quot;-prefixing verbs, while the grammatical use of &quot;weren&#x27;t&quot; has been retained and strengthened in use among younger speakers.

===Lumbee Homecoming===

Lumbee Homecoming is a celebration held annually in Pembroke since 1968. Homecoming is important in bringing together members of families, many from great distances, for a weeklong celebration of Lumbee culture. Festivities include a parade, a pow wow, pageants, and other cultural events. 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the homecoming and saw crowds of over 20,000 spectators, including the Governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper.

===Communities===
Lumbee communities were linked together by their extensive kinship ties, church affiliations, their sense of themselves as Indians, and their control of their educational system, all of which served as a mechanism for defining tribal membership and maintaining tribal boundaries. Communities are basically self-governing. One form of self-governance in the early 20th century was exhibited by a fraternal organization known as the Red Men&#x27;s Lodge. By 1914, lodges existed in Prospect, Magnolia, Pembroke, Saddletree, Oxendine, and Union Chapel. Lodge members maintained social order, carried out ceremonies, marched in parades, and conducted funerals. The 1987 Lumbee Petition states that, &quot;[w]ith so many prominent leaders it is easy to understand how the lodges could maintain order and, at the same time, protect the tribal members from organized violence from whites in the area&quot;.

===Lumbee patchwork===
In the late 19th century, Maggie Lowry Locklear (Lumbee), daughter of Henry Berry Lowry, created a unique patchwork quilt inspired by the longleaf pine. Her quilt is in the collection of the Museum of the Southeast American Indian at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.

In 1993, Hayes Alan Locklear (Lumbee) designed a dress, which was sewn by Kat Littleturtle (Lumbee) for Miss Lumbee Natascha Wagoner, who was chosen as the 8th Miss Indian USA. The dress featured a pinecone patchwork pattern inspired by Maggie Lowry Locklear&#x27;s quilt. Since then, Lumbee women have adopted this pinecone patchwork dress style as the signature Lumbee dress.

=== Cuisine ===

Traditional Lumbee cuisine heavily intersects with Southern cuisine. Chicken and pastry is a mainstay of Lumbee food, as is cornbread. The collard sandwich—consisting of fried cornbread, collard greens, and fatback—is a popular dish among the Lumbee in Robeson County. It is sometimes served with chow-chow.

===Religion===
Today the Lumbee primarily practice Protestantism, and attending church is an important social activity. Churches have Sunday schools, youth organizations, senior citizens&#x27; programs, Bible study programs, and choir practices. Gospel songs are popular. Ministers are highly respected. When a sizeable number of Lumbee people move to a city, they tend to settle in a particular section or neighborhood and establish a church. This took place in Lumbee communities in Baltimore, Greensboro, Fayetteville, Charlotte, and Claxton, Georgia.

A study has documented Lumbee Methodism back to 1787. Lumbees created two church conferences of Indian congregations — the Burnt Swamp Baptist Association, founded around 1880, and the Lumbee River Conference of the Holiness Methodist Association in 1900. In 1984 Bruce Barton documented 104 Lumbee churches. Prospect Community Church , with 1,008 members in 2017, has purportedly the largest congregation of Native Americans in the United States.

== Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina ==

The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina is one of eight state-recognized Native American tribes in North Carolina. They participate at the state level in many ways, including in the North Carolina Commission of Indian Affairs. They also participate in such national organizations as the National Congress of American Indians and the National Indian Education Association.

According to its constitution, adopted in 2000, the Lumbee tribal government is organized into three branches: the tribal chairperson (executive), the 21-member Tribal Council (legislative), and Supreme Court (judicial). The tribal chairperson and the Tribal Council are elected to three-year terms.

The current administration includes:
* Chairman: John Lowery
* Administrator: Tammy Maynor
* Administration assistant to the chairman: Camera Brewer
* Enrollment director: Reena Locklear.

== Unrecognized organizations ==
Some unrecognized organizations identify as being Lumbee. One, the United Lumbee Nation of North Carolina and America, based in Exeter, California, petitioned for federal recognition in 1980. The final determination was that the group &quot;does not exist as an Indian tribe&quot; and that they did not descend from any Lumbee community.

<text>The Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE ) is the historical name for the (AAP) administered for Australia by the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD).

==History==
Australia has had a long involvement in south polar regions since as early as Douglas Mawson&#x27;s Australasian Antarctic Expedition in 1911. Further Australian exploration of the Antarctic continent was conducted during the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE), which was conducted over the years 1929–1931.

The Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions were established in 1947 with expeditions to Macquarie Island and Heard Island. In 1948 the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) was established to administer the expedition program.

== ANARE Name ==
The name ANARE fell out of official use in the early 2000s. However current and former Australian Antarctic expeditioners continue to use the term informally as a means of identification with the long and continuous history of Australian expeditions to Antarctica. 

==ANARE Symbols==

Soon after being appointed Antarctic Division director in 1949, Dr. Phillip Law saw the need for a recognisable symbol for the fledgling ANARE. His wife, Nel, was an artist and produced the distinctive and enduring circular emblem that Dr Law described as &quot;...a circular badge whose centre is the Antarctic Continent with the Australian sector shaded. Surrounding this is an annular set of designs depicting flora and fauna of Antarctica and the Sub-Antarctic Islands&quot;.

The main ANARE emblem was, in Dr Law&#x27;s words, &quot;too complex to reproduce as a lapel badge or as a logo on aircraft, vehicles or flags.&quot; Dr Law saw potential in the leopard seal as a simplified ANARE symbol. &quot;I was struck with the possibility of formalising a sketch of the creature to produce a geometrical pattern of straight lines...I drew it in the national colours of gold and green.&quot; That symbol served until 1985, when a new &#x27;globe&#x27; logo based on the Australian and Antarctic continents was developed by the AAD.

At the same time the term ANARE fell out of official use the &#x27;globe&#x27; logo was also discarded in favour of the Australian coat of arms to bring the livery of the AAD in line with the rest of the Australian Public Service. However like the ANARE name the logo continues to be used on an informal basis by expeditioners each year in the production of Antarctic Station badges, T-shirts and other memorabilia.

==ANARE Club==
The ANARE Club is a membership organisation established in 1951 for current and previous members of Australian Antarctic expeditions. Its headquarters are in Melbourne, Australia, with branches in most Australian capital cities. Membership is open to anyone who has travelled to Antarctic or subantarctic regions with the Australian Antarctic Program. The club has thousands of members. Its emblem is the emperor penguin on a map of Antarctica.

A sub-organisation is the Antarctic Family and Friends Association, originally established in 1965 by Nel Law as the Antarctic Wives&#x27; Association of Australia.

== References to ANARE ==

Anare Street in the Aurora Village in Greenwith, South Australia is named after the expeditions. Nearby streets also share similarly themed names.

<text>Streetball (or street basketball) is a variation of basketball, typically played on outdoor courts and featuring significantly less formal structure and enforcement of the game&#x27;s rules. As such, its format is more conducive to allowing players to publicly showcase their own individual skills. Streetball may also refer to other urban sports played on asphalt. It is particularly popular and important in New York City and Los Angeles, though its popularity has spread across the United States due to the game&#x27;s adaptability.

Some places and cities in the United States have organized streetball programs, operated similarly to midnight basketball programs. Many cities also host their own weekend-long streetball tournaments, with Hoop-It-Up and the Houston Rockets&#x27; Blacktop Battle being two of the most popular. Holcombe Rucker had a big impact on streetball when he created a league in New York City, and it was later dedicated to him and named Rucker Park. Since the mid-2000s, streetball has seen an increase in media exposure through television shows such as ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Street Basketball&quot; and &quot;City Slam&quot;, as well as traveling exhibitions such as the AND1 Mixtape Tour, YPA, and Ball4Real.

It is also popular in other countries, such as the Philippines. Many Filipino streets have their own basketball court. Tournaments are also organized, especially during the summer and holiday season. Divisions are divided into 4 brackets, Mosquito (ages 7 to 13), Midget (ages 14 to 17), Junior (ages 18 to 25), and Senior division (ages 26 and up). In France, Quai 54 takes place every summer. It is one of the biggest streetball tournaments in the world.

==Rules and features==

Streetball rules vary widely from court to court.

Players typically divide into teams by alternating choices. No referees are employed, so almost invariably a &quot;call your own foul&quot; rule is in effect, and a player who believes he has been fouled, simply needs to call out &quot;Foul!&quot;, and play will be stopped, with the ball awarded to the fouled player&#x27;s team (free throws are not usually awarded in street ball), usually after a brief debate over the alleged foul.

Calling fouls is generally disfavored. The etiquette of what rightly constitutes a foul, as well as the permissible amount of protestation against such a call, are the products of individual groups, and of the seriousness of a particular game.

Other violations which are enforced include traveling, double-dribble, carrying, kicking, out of bounds, goaltending and backcourt violation.

===Half-court play===

The majority of streetball games are played 3-on-3 on a half court. Special rules have been developed for half-court play:

* At the beginning of the game and after each made basket, play begins at the top of the key. A &quot;checking&quot; system is used to ensure that both teams are ready to begin play. This involves the offensive player saying &quot;check&quot; while throwing the ball to his defender. The defender then makes sure their team is ready and then throws the ball back to begin play.
* If the ball goes out of bounds during play, the ball can either be checked from out of bounds near where the ball went out or at the top of the key, depending on the rules established before the game.
* FIBA recently had to add the &quot;check clock&quot; rule into play in their streetball tournaments due to some players taking excruciatingly long amounts of time to check the ball, interrupting the flow of play. This &quot;check clock&quot; means that when the defending player has been checked the ball, he has to return it within 5 seconds.
* The &quot;12-second shot clock&quot; rule can be implemented as well to prevent longer possessions. (used in streetball tournaments)
* If the defending team gains possession of the ball, they must &quot;clear&quot; the ball past the three-point line before they can score a basket. This does not need to be at the top of the key and no checking is required.
* Sometimes in a half-court game, a &quot;winner&#x27;s ball&quot; or &quot;make it, take it&quot; rule is used. This means that when a team scores, they get the ball back on offense. Potentially, the other team could end up never getting the ball on offense if the first team scores on every possession.

=== Game structure ===
A common feature of street basketball is the &quot;pick up game&quot;. To participate in most streetball games around the world, one simply goes to an outdoor court where people are playing, indicates a wish to participate, and from all the players who were at the court before one has played, two players acting as &quot;captains&quot; will get to pick their team out of the players available and play a game. Generally, the team captains alternate their choices, but different courts have differing rules in regards to player selection. Many games play up to 7, 11, 13, 15 or 21 points with the scoring system of 2-point baskets and 3-point baskets counting for 1 and 2 points respectively. It is possible to do (1&#x27;s only), (2&#x27;s only), (1&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s) or (2&#x27;s and 3&#x27;s). Players often play &quot;win by 1&quot; or &quot;win by 2&quot; as in tennis to win the game.

* 1&#x27;s only – each basket counts as 1 point
* 2&#x27;s only – each basket counts as 2 points
* 1&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s – each basket counts as 1 point inside the arc and 2 points outside the arc
* 2&#x27;s and 3&#x27;s – each basket counts as 2 points inside the arc and 3 points outside the arc

The streetball game can be played at different team formats such as 2-on-2 or 3-on-3 for a half court play while 4-on-4 or 5-on-5 for a full court play. In most instances, the winning team gets first possession and usually choose which direction (which basket) they get to use.

In a 3-on-3 or higher, the first game often plays up to 15 points. Second game then goes to 12, then every game after is 15.

Another possible streetball feature is having an MC call the game. The MC is on the court during the game and is often very close to the players (but makes an effort to not interfere with the game) and uses a microphone to provide game commentary for the fans.

===One-on-one play===

Special rules have been developed for one-on-one play:

* If the player loses the match of a one-on-one, the losing player is given a second chance for overtime. This either results with the match continuing or if the match is close enough the next person to go up by 2 points wins.
* In a game of One-on-One at a close game, the game cannot end on a bank shot. If a bank shot happens on the last point of the game it is a replay of possession. (refer as the no bankshot rule)
* Another additional variation to the rules is the (skunk rule). This merely means that if a player reaches a certain point without the other player scoring then the game is over. The skunk rule limit can vary, but is often used at the score 7 to 0 mark.
* A local dead end limit rule can be apply; for instance a game may be played to 7, win by 2, with a 9-point dead end, (refer to as 7 by 2&#x27;s, 9 straight) which would mean scores of 7–3, 8–6, or 9–8 would all be final, while with scores of 7–6 or 8–7, play would continue.
* Sometimes in a One-on-One game, a (&quot;winner&#x27;s ball&quot; or &quot;make it, take it&quot; rule) is used. This means that if a player scores will gets the ball again on offense; the other player could end up never getting the ball on offense if that other player scores on every possession.

==Variations==

=== 21 ===
A popular variation of street basketball is &quot;21&quot;, also known as &quot;Hustle,&quot; &quot;American,&quot; &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s,&quot; &quot;V or Varsity,&quot; &quot;Roughhouse,&quot; 33, 50 or &quot;Crunch,&quot; or &quot;New York.&quot; 21 is played most often with 3–5 players on a half court. However it is possible to play &quot;21&quot; with only two players or more.

Further, in some forms, players can freely enter the game after it has begun, starting at zero points or being &quot;spotted&quot; the same number as the player with the lowest score. &quot;21&quot; is an &quot;every player for himself&quot; game, with highly variable rules. The rules of &quot;21&quot; are usually agreed by the players at the beginning of the game.

The typical rules of &quot;21&quot; are:

* one player &quot;breaks&quot; to begin the game by shooting from 3 point range. Sometimes players agree that the &quot;break&quot; must not be a successful shot, in order to give every player an equal chance at rebounding to gain the 1st possession of the game
* the normal foul rule is in effect
* baskets are scored as 2 points (short/med range) and 3 points (long range)
* after a successful shot, the shooter can take up to three 1-point free-throws (or play the &quot;shoot til you miss&quot; rule, where the shooter continues to shoot the ball until a player misses), but as soon as he misses, the ball may be rebounded by anyone; conversely, if he makes all three free throw shots, he then gets to keep the ball and &quot;check up&quot; or start play again at the top of the arc
* In some games, 1 point free throws start at the charity stripe and then move to the 3 point line at the score of 11 and so on. (referred as the &quot;long all day&quot; rule)
* the last person with a shot attempt should be the first person to step out on defense
* after any change of possession, the ball should be cleared past the 3 point line (or at times just out of the key)
* in order to win, a player must make exactly 21 points; if he goes over then he restarts back at either 11, 13 or 15 points, depending on the rules in use
* whoever wins the game starts with the ball at the beginning of the next game
* only serious fouls are called (commonly referred to as &quot;No blood, No foul&quot;)
* other typical basketball rules, such as out-of-bounds, are also frequently ignored in the game &quot;21&quot;; this is to avoid confusion on possession of the ball

Common additional rules include:

* if a missed shot is tipped in to the basket by another player without their feet touching the ground, then the shooter&#x27;s score reverts to 0 (or 13, if their score was over 13); this rule may not apply on free-throws. (This is referred to as playing with “tips” or “taps”)
* if a player who has 13 points misses their next shot, regardless of whether it is a free-throw, then their points revert to 0. (This is referred to as poison points)
* whoever wins the game must shoot a three-pointer in order to start with the ball at the beginning of the next game; if he makes it, he gets the three points, but doesn&#x27;t have to take free-throws, and starts with the ball.
* players with less than 13 points at the end of a game keep their points into the next game using the (handicap system) for when there is a wide variation in skill amongst the players.

&quot;21&quot; is considered a very challenging game, especially because the offensive player must possibly go up against several defenders at the same time. For this reason, it is exceedingly difficult to &quot;drive to the hole&quot; and make lay-ups in &quot;21.&quot; Therefore, and also because of the emphasis on free-throws, &quot;21&quot; is very much a shooter&#x27;s game, and because a successful shot means you keep the ball, it is possible for there to be come-backs when a player recovers from a large deficit by not missing any shots (this can also result in failure when they miss their final free-throw at 20 points and revert to 13 or 15). &quot;21&quot; is popular because it allows an odd number of people to play, unlike regular basketball or other variants.

=== H-O-R-S-E ===
The game of H-O-R-S-E is played by two or more players. The order of turns is established before the game starts. The player whose turn is first is given control, which means they must attempt to make a basket in a particular way of their choosing, explaining to the other players beforehand what the requirements of the shot are. If that player is successful, every subsequent player must attempt that same shot according to its requirements. If a player fails to duplicate the shot, they acquire a letter, starting with H and moving rightward through the word &quot;Horse&quot;. After all players have made an attempt, control moves to the next player, and the game continues on in this fashion. If a player who has control misses their shot, there is no letter penalty and control moves to the next player. Whenever any player has all of the letters, they are eliminated from the game. The last person in the game is declared the winner.

<text>Felsőzsolca is a small town in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county, in northern Hungary, in the Miskolc agglomeration. It is the city with the tenth highest population in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county and the second biggest in the Miskolc agglomeration.

==Location==
Felsőzsolca is situated next to Miskolc, from the outskirts of Miskolc (the centres of the two cities are about from each other). The town is situated at the eastern tip of the Bükk Mountain, on the left bank of the river Sajó, and in the Borsod region bordered by the eastern side of Abaúj. The topography is flat, mildly hilly.

==Transport==
It is accessible by roads 3 and 37, by train on the Budapest-Miskolc-Sátoraljaújhely line, and on the Miskolc-Hidasnémeti line. The railway station is from the town.

Public transit for Felsőzsolca is provided by the neighboring Transport Company of Miskolc, (MVK Zrt.) Now, one bus service, line 7, serves the citizens. Besides this, several coach services travel through the town on Szent István street, and on Kassai street.

==Geographical connections==
*Northeast: valley of river Hernád, Szikszó
*North: hills of Cserehát
*Northwest: Sajószentpéter, Kazincbarcika, Edelény towns
*West: Bükk Mountain, Miskolc centre of the county
*South: valley of river Sajó, Tisza, Tiszaújváros, Polgár, Debrecen towns
*East: underneath of Tokaj Mountain, Taktaköz, Szerencs, Tokaj towns

==Climate==
Complexion: continental temperature, min-max.: -25 °C till +35 °C, annual average temperature is 11 °C

==Hydrogeology==
Next to the town, on the western side is the river Sajó and its tributary stream, Little-Bódva (Little-Sajó as others call it). There was a lake, called Pond Priest, between Miskolc and Felsőzsolca that has a legend associated with it. According to the legend, a church had sunk into the pond. The pond was pumped out in 2008, and the area has been built on. In June 2010 a historic flood hit Felsőzsolca. Out of a total of 2200, about 1800 houses were damaged, and over 200 houses collapsed. The restoration is in progress now.

==History==
The area has been inhabited since Neolithic times. The town was first mentioned in 1281 in a document about territory disputed between Zsolca and Miskolc. The document states that the border of the two towns shall always remain the river Sajó.

In the Middle Ages Zsolca had been a prospering village until occupying Turks destroyed it. The village suffered significantly again during the revolution against the Habsburgs in 1848–49 when Russian forces (allies of the Habsburgs) burned it down. In 1867 a monument was erected commemorating the Battle of Zsolca which made the village the second place in the country where a monument for the revolution was erected.

During the 20th century, the county became an important industrial area, the population of Felsőzsolca was growing rapidly due to its proximity to Miskolc. By 1980 it had more than 7,000 residents and in 1997 it was granted “city” status.

Unlike many villages in the area, Felsőzsolca managed to avoid being annexed by Miskolc mostly because of the river Sajó which acts as a natural border between them. The two cities exist in symbiosis. Despite being a sovereign city outside the boundaries of Miskolc, Felsőzsolca is directly connected to Miskolc by the bus lines of MVK Zrt., (the official Miskolc mass transport company).

Before World War II, there was a Jewish community in Felsőzsolca. At its height, there were 82 Jews in the community most of them were murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust.

==Ethnical groups==
91% of the population has Hungarian nationality, and 9% of the inhabitants have Roma nationality. Out of this, the Bulgarian and Polish minority also live in Felsőzsolca.

<text>USS &quot;Tucson&quot; (SSN-770), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Tucson, Arizona. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 10 June 1988 and her keel was laid down on 15 August 1991. She was launched on 20 March 1994 sponsored by Mrs. Diane C. Kent.

==History==
&quot;Tucson&quot; was originally supposed to be commissioned on 18 August 1995, however, Hurricane Felix threatened the Virginian coastline, and the U.S. Navy decided to sortie the fleet, to prevent damage to ships in port if the hurricane made landfall. &quot;Tucson&quot; was the last ship to leave port, in case the prediction for landfall changed. As it turned out, the hurricane never did make landfall, but &quot;Tucson&quot; was at sea on 18 August. Upon returning to port, the commissioning ceremony was quickly rescheduled for 19 September 1995. At the new commissioning ceremony, the commanding officer, Commander Duane M. Baker, declared that for the next two hours, it was officially 18 August.

In June 1996, &quot;Tucson&quot; was struck by the Military Sealift Command vehicle cargo ship while moored in port at Newport News. A sudden windstorm caused &quot;Gilliland&quot; to break free from her mooring and cross the harbor, colliding with &quot;Tucson&quot; and the destroyer moored behind her. While &quot;Deyo&quot; suffered the most damage, &quot;Tucson&quot; suffered minor damage to her AN/BRA-34 antenna.

From September 1996 to October 1996, &quot;Tucson&quot; changed her home port. &quot;Tucson&quot; left Norfolk, Virginia, passed through the Panama Canal and stopped in San Diego, California for five days. VIPs from Tucson, Arizona, were allowed to ride on three separate short cruises, and then busloads of tourists from the city of Tucson came for tours of the submarine while in port. Following this port visit, &quot;Tucson&quot; continued on to arrive in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

&quot;Tucson&quot; left for her first deployment ever, to the Western Pacific Ocean, in February 1998. At that time, tensions between the United Nations and Iraq had escalated drastically. In the 30 days leading up to departure, the government of Iraq had blocked access to the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and had withdrawn cooperation with the UNSCOM monitoring teams. The ship traveled as far west as the Persian Gulf before returning to Pearl Harbor in August 1998. It was during this period of time that the PBS series &quot;Nova&quot; filmed the episode &quot;Battlegroups&quot; aboard &quot;Tucson&quot;.

On 19 May 2004, &quot;Tucson&quot; departed for a Western Pacific deployment.
