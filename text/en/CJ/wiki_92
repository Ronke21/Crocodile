<text>Miller Lite is a 4.2% ABV light American lager beer sold by Molson Coors (previously MillerCoors) of Chicago, Illinois. It was first produced in 1975. The company also produces Miller Genuine Draft and Miller High Life. Miller Lite competes mainly with Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s Bud Light. Miller Lite is the official beer sponsor of the Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee Brewers, Milwaukee Bucks, Dallas Cowboys, Baltimore Ravens, Philadelphia Eagles, Chicago Bears, and Bellator MMA.

==History==
Calorie-reduced light beer was first introduced to the market by New York&#x27;s Rheingold Brewery as &quot;Gablinger&#x27;s Diet Beer&quot;, brewed using a process developed in 1964 by chemist Hersch Gablinger of Basel, Switzerland. The version that evolved into Miller Lite had its origins in a recipe developed in 1967 by Joseph L. Owades, PhD, a biochemist working for Rheingold. Next, the recipe was offered by Owades to Chicago&#x27;s Peter Hand Brewing. That year, Peter Hand Brewing was purchased by a group of investors, renamed Meister Brau Brewing, and Lite was soon introduced as Meister Brau Lite, a companion to their flagship Meister Brau. Under the new management, Meister Brau Brewing encountered significant financial problems, and in 1972, sold several of its existing labels to Miller. The recipe was relaunched simply as &quot;Lite&quot; on packaging and in advertising (with &quot;Lite Beer from Miller&quot; being its &quot;official&quot; name until the late &#x27;90s) in the test markets of Springfield, Illinois; Providence, Rhode Island; Knoxville, Tennessee; and San Diego, California, in 1973, and heavily marketed using masculine pro sports players and other &quot;macho&quot; figures of the day in an effort to sell to the key beer-drinking male demographic. Miller Lite was introduced nationally in 1975. and became the first successful mainstream light beer in the United States.

Miller&#x27;s youth-oriented, heavy-advertising approach worked where the two previous light beers had failed, and Miller&#x27;s early production totals of 12.8 million barrels quickly increased to 24.2 million barrels by 1977 as Miller rose to 2nd place in the American brewing marketplace. Other brewers responded, in particular Anheuser-Busch with its heavily advertised Bud Light in 1982, which eventually overtook Lite in sales by 1994. Anheuser-Busch played on the branding style of &quot;Lite&quot;, boasting that next to Bud Light &quot;everything else is just a light&quot;. In 1992, light beers became the biggest domestic beer in America, and in 1998, Miller relabeled its &quot;Lite&quot; brand as &quot;Miller Lite&quot;.

In 2008, Miller Brewing Company test-marketed three new recipes – an amber, a blonde ale, and a wheat – under the Miller Lite brand, marketed as Miller Lite Brewers Collection.

At the 2010 and 2014 Great American Beer Festival, Miller Lite won the gold medal for Best American Style Lager or Light Lager, besting Miller Genuine Draft.

===Advertising===

Miller Lite&#x27;s long-running &quot;Tastes Great!...Less Filling!&quot; advertising campaign was ranked by &quot;Advertising Age&quot; magazine as the eighth best advertising campaign in history. The campaign was developed by the McCann-Erickson Worldwide advertising agency. In the prime of the campaign, television commercials typically portrayed a Lite Beer drinker noting its great taste followed by another who observed that it was less filling. This usually led to a parody of Wild West saloon fights in which every patron got involved in the dispute for no real reason, though in this case it was always a shouting match, and blows were never thrown. The commercials were closed with a voice-over from actor Eddie Barth, who read the slogan, &quot;Lite Beer from Miller: Everything you&#x27;ve always wanted in a beer. And less.&quot;

The then-recently retired New York Jets running back Matt Snell was the first person to appear in Miller Lite&#x27;s first commercial in 1973.

To attract &#x27;Joe Sixpack&#x27; to a light beer, these commercials started to feature both elite ex-athletes such as Ray Nitschke, Ben Davidson, and Bubba Smith but also oddball cultural figures such as Mickey Spillane (accompanied by a blonde, Lee Meredith, who is better known for her role as Ulla, the secretary in &quot;The Producers&quot;), and comedian Rodney Dangerfield. As the series of commercials went on, it began featuring athletes and celebrities of all sorts. Some commercials from this era include:

* Former Major League catcher and Milwaukee Brewers broadcaster Bob Uecker being moved from his seat at a ballgame, and escorted away by an usher. Uecker exclaims &quot;I must be in the front row,&quot; but ends up in the back row of the stands. This gave rise to the term &quot;Bob Uecker seats&quot;. The ad itself was filmed at the Los Angeles Dodgers home field, Dodger Stadium.
*Heavyweight boxing champion Joe Frazier walking into a full bar as part of a barbershop quartet while the on-screen caption says &quot;Joe Frazier, Famous Heavyweight Singer&quot;. The quartet sings &quot;do like Smokin&#x27; Joe&quot; and the song goes on to praise Miller Lite&#x27;s advantages.
* Former Baltimore Orioles first baseman Boog Powell and former umpire Jim Honochick doing a spot together, with Honochick unaware who he is standing next to, until he puts his glasses on at the end, and exclaims, &quot;Hey, you&#x27;re Boog Powell!&quot;
* Footballer and actor Bubba Smith proclaims at the end of a spot, &quot;I also love the easy-opening can&quot;, then tears off the top third of an aluminum Miller Lite can. In a later ad, pro ten-pin bowler Don Carter laments that bowlers are athletes too, and attempts to prove it by repeating Smith&#x27;s feat, but struggles to do so.
* When Billy Martin and George Steinbrenner were in the middle of their 1970s feuds, they did an ad with Martin saying, &quot;Tastes great, George&quot;, and Steinbrenner replying, &quot;Less filling, Billy!&quot;, back and forth until Steinbrenner finally says, &quot;You&#x27;re fired!&quot; (changed to &quot;You&#x27;re hired!&quot; when Martin was re-hired by Steinbrenner in real life). Martin replies, &quot;Not Again!&quot;
*Former baseball player Marv Throneberry also starred in ads, usually making deadpan comment about being featured in the ad, despite his being known as an inept baseball player, quipping, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why they asked &quot;me&quot; to do this commercial.&quot;

As the popularity of the ads and the number of athletes and celebrities that appeared in them grew, Miller produced occasional &quot;alumni&quot; ads featuring all of the stars, generally in some sort of competition between the &#x27;Less Fillings&#x27; and the &#x27;Taste Greats&#x27;. The ads usually ended with Rodney Dangerfield somehow being the goat of the losing team. In one of the last spots to feature Dangerfield, the Miller Lite alumni are competing in a bowling match. It is the last frame of a tie game, and Ben Davidson grumbles to Dangerfield, &quot;All we need is &quot;one&quot; pin, Rodney.&quot; Dangerfield rolls the ball down the lane, only to have it bounce horizontally off the head pin and into the gutter, knocking down zero pins.

As part of this campaign, Miller Brewing ran a series of television commercials in the winter of 1993–1994 showing several fictitious &quot;extreme sports&quot; such as &quot;Wiener Dog Drag Racing&quot; (which featured two wiener dogs racing each other at a drag racing strip), &quot;Sumo High Dive&quot; (which depicted a Japanese sumo wrestler diving off a platform) and &quot;The Miss Perfect Face-Off&quot; (which featured beauty pageant contestants playing ice hockey). The tag line that followed was, &quot;If you can combine great taste with less filling, you can combine anything.&quot; and the question &quot;Can your beer do this?&quot;

In 1995-1996, Miller Lite ran the &quot;Life Is Good&quot; campaign, which showed Miller Lite drinkers&#x27; aspirational transition to more fun via a Miller Lite bottle tap, like &quot;Beach Rewind&quot;, where three men on a beach admired three beautiful women walking by, and could rewind, and enjoy, the scene repeatedly. The campaign was developed by Leo Burnett Company, and received the American Marketing Association EFFIE award for outstanding advertising effectiveness. The campaign included celebrities such as Larry Bird, Keith Jackson, and Richard Karn.

Beginning January 12, 1997, a series of surrealistic Miller Lite ads, purportedly made by a man named &quot;Dick&quot;, began to air. They were hallmarked as such either at the beginning or the end of the commercial. The campaign was developed by Minneapolis-based ad agency Fallon. The series of &quot;Dick&quot; commercials was directed by Gerald Casale of the new wave band Devo. Such commercials include one where a middle-aged man sees the message &quot;twist to open&quot; on a Miller Lite bottle cap, and he proceeds to do the Twist.

The ad campaign changed back to using high-profile celebrities who were either on opposite ends of the spectrum or had bragging rights to exchange with the other, which leads to them arguing about whether Miller Lite was better because of how &quot;smooth&quot; it tastes, or because of &quot;the choice hops&quot;. Notable pairings included the following:

* George Brett and Robin Yount. Brett and Yount were both elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999 with 98 and 77 percent of the vote respectively while Yount won two MVP awards to Brett&#x27;s one.
* Edgar Winter and George Hamilton. Winter&#x27;s albinism was a stark contrast to the tanned look of Hamilton on screen.
* Ken Stabler and Dan Fouts. Stabler needles Fouts about never getting to or winning a Super Bowl while Fouts lets Stabler know about his inferior passing statistics.

In 2003, &quot;Catfight&quot;, another high-profile commercial in the long-running &quot;Great Taste...Less Filling&quot; campaign, was denounced by critics as depicting women as sexual objects. The commercial featured two beautiful young women, a blonde (Tanya Ballinger) and a brunette (Kitana Baker), discussing the classic &quot;Great Taste/Less Filling&quot; debate, except they engaged in a catfight, hence the ad&#x27;s title. The fight moving from a fountain to a mud pit, with the girls stripping each other of their clothing in the process. An uncensored version of the commercial ended with the women, stripped down to their underwear, sharing a passionate kiss. The girls received much publicity from the commercial, and later starred in a few related commercials, videos and events.

In 2006, Miller Lite had an advertising campaign called Man Laws featuring celebrities that include actor Burt Reynolds, professional wrestler Triple H, comedian Eddie Griffin, and former American football player Jerome Bettis. The celebrities and other actors were in a &quot;Men of the Square Table&quot;, a group meeting where they discuss different situations that should be included in the &quot;Man Laws&quot;. The ads were developed by the ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky/Miami, and were directed by comedy film director Peter Farrelly.

In June 2010, commercials premiered featuring actresses Lindsey McKeon and Nadine Heimann as bartenders.

===Marketing===
In December 2013, as part of a product placement marketing campaign with the film &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot;, Miller reintroduced the 1974 navy-blue blackletter font &quot;Lite&quot; packaging on its cans for a limited time (the original 1972 cans used a light-blue script logo). However, the vintage packaging was such a success that by September 2014, the company decided to switch back to the vintage packaging full-time, including on bottles and tap handles, mirroring the unexpected success that PepsiCo had in 2009 with its Pepsi Throwback &amp; Mountain Dew Throwback lines in tapping into the retro-themed packaging market. The unexpected sales increase, combined with wanting to differentiate the packaging from Bud Light, were factors in the decision, with some consumers even stating that Miller actually improved on the taste when nothing changed in the beer itself.

===Sponsorship===
====Motorsport====
Miller Brewing Company began their NASCAR sponsorship in 1983 with driver Bobby Allison, advertising the Miller High Life brand and later in 1990 with driver Rusty Wallace, advertising the Miller Genuine Draft brand. In 1997, the company began advertising the Miller Lite brand on Wallace&#x27;s #2 Penske Racing car. The car later earned the nickname &quot;Blue Deuce&quot;, due to its number and blue paint scheme. Wallace retired following the 2005 season, and Kurt Busch was named as his replacement. Busch drove the &quot;Blue Deuce&quot; from 2006 to 2010. The car was driven by Brad Keselowski, who won the 2012 Sprint Cup Series championship. Molson Coors has since dropped the sponsorship from the #2 car, with the last sponsorship occurring during the 2020 Coca-Cola 600 and was replaced by sister company Keystone Light since 2021.

Other promotion in motorsport included the sponsoring of Don Prudhomme&#x27;s Larry Dixon-driven NHRA top fuel dragster from 1997 to 2007. Prior to that, Dixon was sponsored by Miller Genuine Draft. Additionally, Miller Brewing sponsored the Unlimited hydroplane of R.B. &quot;Bob&quot; Taylor in 1984 with the U-7 &quot;Lite All-Star&quot;, driven by Tom D&#x27;Eath. The following year, Miller switched teams and brands with the &quot;Miller American&quot; Unlimited hydroplane owned by Fran Muncey and Jim Lucero—which resulted in the 1985 National Championship, and APBA Gold Cup wins in 1985, 1986, and 1987, driven by Chip Hanauer.

For the first time in a video game, it was featured in NASCAR &#x27;15: Victory Edition and NASCAR Heat Evolution as a sponsor available to users verified to be over 21 years of age.

<text>John Stuart Hans Plohman (born May 11, 1948) is a former politician from Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1995, and a cabinet minister in the NDP government of Premier Howard Pawley from 1982 to 1988.

The son of Hans W. Plohman and Anne Werstiuk, he was educated at the University of Manitoba, University of Winnipeg, and Red River Community College. He worked as a teacher before entering public life. In 1980, he was elected a municipal councillor in the town of Dauphin.

Plohman was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1981 as a New Democrat, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Jim Galbraith by 636 votes in the central-northern riding of Dauphin. He entered cabinet on August 20, 1982, serving as Minister of Government Services with responsibility for the Manitoba Telephone Act. Following a cabinet shuffle on November 4, 1983, he became Minister of Highways and Transportation. On January 30, 1985, he was also named Minister of Government Services.

Plohman was re-elected by an increased margin in the 1986 provincial election. He relinquished the Government Services portfolio on February 4, 1987, and on September 21, 1987 he left the Highways and Transportation portfolio to accept the position of Minister of Natural Resources.

The Manitoba NDP were defeated in parliament in early 1988, when disgruntled backbench Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Jim Walding voted against his government&#x27;s budget. Despite this Plohman was re-elected in the following election, defeating Progressive Conservative Russell Secord by 548 votes. The NDP were reduced to 12 seats (out of 57) and third-party status following this election; Plohman formally resigned his cabinet portfolio on May 9 when the new government was sworn into office.

The NDP recovered to twenty seats in the provincial election of 1990, and Plohman was re-elected with an increased majority. He did not seek re-election in 1995 and returned to the teaching profession from which he retired in 2003.

In 2002, Plohman was appointed to a provincial advisory board recommending ways to stimulate economic growth at the Port of Churchill, in northern Manitoba. In 2004 he was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Churchill Gateway Development Corporation.

In 2005, Plohman was appointed as the first Chairman of the Board of the newly formed Manitoba Agriculture Services Corporation (MASC). In this capacity Plohman provided leadership in the amalgamation of the former Manitoba Agriculture Credit Corporation (MACC) and the Manitoba Crop Insurance Corporation (MCIC) into the dynamic MASC serving the lending and insurance needs of rural Manitobans. In 2014 Plohman was appointed to the Government of Manitoba&#x27;s Crown Corporations Council as a Director from which he resigned on May 25, 2016.

John Plohman married Patricia Ann Yanke in 1971 and they have three children, Rychelle Anne Plohman Lytle, Dr. Jodi Lynn Plohman Jones and Robert James Plohman CA. They also have nine grandchildren.

<text>Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala (; 8 September 1914 – 21 July 1982), better known as B. P. Koirala (), was a Nepali revolutionary, political leader, and writer. He was the Prime Minister of Nepal from 1959 to 1960. He led the Nepali Congress, a social democratic political party. He was the grandfather of Bollywood actors Manisha Koirala and Siddharth Koirala, the elder brother of former prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala and the younger brother of former prime minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.

Koirala was the first democratically elected and 22nd Prime Minister of Nepal. He held the office for 18 months before being deposed and imprisoned on the instruction of King Mahendra. The rest of his life was spent largely in prison or exile and in steadily deteriorating health.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest political personalities in Nepal, Koirala was a staunch supporter of democracy. He asserted that guarantees of individual liberty and civil and political rights alone were not sufficient in a poor country like Nepal, and that democratic socialism was the solution to Nepal&#x27;s underdevelopment.

==Early life==
The second son of Krishna Prasad Koirala, a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala was raised in Banaras. Until the age of 14, he attended a school established by his father. Afterwards he joined the Harishchandra School in the city. He began writing when he was in the ninth grade.

The British Raj charged him and his brother, Matrika Prasad Koirala, with having contacts with terrorists in 1930. They were arrested and set free after three months. Because of this, Bishweshwar began to study at the Scottish Church College in Calcutta as per his father&#x27;s wishes. Towards the end of 1930, he left college and returned to Banaras. In 1932, he completed his intermediate level of studies. His father again insisted that his son join Scottish Church College in Calcutta. So for the second time, he joined the college, but left it soon afterwards. In 1934, he completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in Economics and Politics from Banaras Hindu University. He also earned a degree in law from the University of Calcutta in 1937, and practised for several years in Darjeeling.

While still a student, he became involved in the Indian nationalist movement. In 1934, he joined the Indian National Congress. During World War II, he was interned by the British in Dhanbad for two years (1942–1944).

==Political career==

Following his release, with Indian independence imminent, he set about trying to bring change to Nepal. In 1947 he founded in India the socialist Nepali National Congress, which in 1950 became the Nepali Congress Party. On 9 March 1947, Koirala crossed over to Nepal to help his brother Girija Prasad Koirala instigate the Biratnagar jute mill strike. He was arrested along with Girija Prasad Koirala and four other National Congress leaders and taken with his fellow agitators to Kathmandu via a 21-day long, slow walk across the hills. The prisoners&#x27; march attracted much attention and helped to radicalise the peasants whose villages lay en route. The Koiralas along with other detainees were kept in a Kathmandu bungalow but were soon released after a 27-day hunger strike, popular protests, and at the request of Mahatma Gandhi in August 1947.

Koirala went back to India, and began looking for arms to storm Kathmandu. Finally, Koirala led the Revolution of 1951, which overthrew Nepal&#x27;s 104-year-old Rana regime. The last Rana prime minister was dismissed in October 1951 when the Rana-Congress coalition cabinet (in which Koirala served for nine months as the Home minister) broke apart. Koirala then concentrated on developing the Nepali political structure. King Mahendra responded with a new constitution enabling free parliamentary elections to take place in 1959. Only a fragmented parliament was expected, but Koirala&#x27;s Nepali Congress scored a landslide, taking more than two-thirds of the seats in the lower house. After several weeks of significant hesitation, Mahendra asked Koirala to form a government, which took office in May 1959.

Koirala led his country&#x27;s delegation to the United Nations and made carefully poised visits to China and India, then increasingly at odds over territorial disputes. Yet, he was in trouble at home almost from the beginning. His land reform measures, especially the revision of the tenancy laws so easily passed by parliament, deeply offended the landed aristocracy which had long dominated the army. King Mahendra, on 15 December 1960, suspended the constitution, dissolved parliament, dismissed the cabinet, imposed direct rule, and for good measure imprisoned Koirala and his closest government colleagues. Many of them were released after a few months, but Koirala, though he was suffering from throat cancer, was kept imprisoned without trial until 1968.

In 1968, the then Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, played a significant role in releasing Koirala from prison, but he was the main actor for also making sure that Koirala stayed out of the country in self-exile for the rest of his life. Koirala was in self-exile in Banaras, India until December 1976. After his return from almost a decade of self-exile in Banaras, he was kept under house arrest at his Chabahil residence. During that time, King Birendra asked the then Prime Minister Dr Tulsi Giri, a tough political rival of Koirala to recommend to him by the joint meeting of the Council of Ministers and Back to the Village National Campaign Central Committee, whether Koirala should be freed for medical treatment in the USA or not. Accordingly, the joint meeting recommended King Birendra to release Koirala and provide him with the necessary expense for medical treatment in the USA. The passport and necessary visa were arranged by the government of Nepal for Koirala and his wife Sushila Koirala, a doctor and an assistant. The then Royal Nepalese Embassy in the Washington DC, was instructed to provide all support to the Koirala family for the medical treatment.

King Birendra, educated in England and the United States, succeeded his father in 1972 when the political climate was believed to be gradually improving. Koirala, however, was arrested immediately upon his return from exile in 1976 and charged with the capital offence of attempting armed revolution. Finally, in March 1978, he was cleared of all treason and sedition charges. Then, in 1981, he was cleared to travel to the United States for medical treatment. The Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa convinced the king to allow Koirala to proceed to the US for treatment as per recommendation from the royal physician Dr. M. R. Pandey. The government of Nepal bore a portion of the cost of his medical treatment in the US, while the rest was arranged by his nephew Shail Updhaya, Dr. Shukdev Shah, family and friends.

After returning from a further medical visit to the United States, he had a series of audiences with King Birendra, as he tried for a &quot;national reconciliation&quot;. During the student demonstrations in 1979, he was under house arrest. However, he welcomed King Birendra&#x27;s call for a national referendum on the question of the political system for Nepal. The referendum results were announced to be in favour of retaining the political system led by the B. P. Koirala was the first leader to welcome the result of the national referendum and accepted the people verdict and claimed that the referendum was fair and free. However, owing to differences in the electoral process to seek membership of class organization as mandatory, Koirala demanded a boycott of the 1981 elections.

Despite obviously failing health and political strength, Koirala could still draw great popular support. He addressed one of Nepal&#x27;s largest public meetings in recent years in Kathmandu&#x27;s Ratna Park in January 1982. He died on 21 July 1982, in Kathmandu. An estimated half a million people attended his funeral.

==Literature==

While Koirala is considered one of the most charismatic political leader of Nepal, he was also one of the most well-read and thoughtful writers of Nepalese literature. He wrote short stories and novels, and some poems. Koirala began writing short stories in Hindi.

His first stories were published in Banaras in &quot;Hansa&quot;, a Hindi literary magazine edited by Prem Chand (India&#x27;s Tolstoy). His first Nepali short story &quot;Chandrabadan&quot; was published in &quot;Sharada&quot;, a Nepali literary magazine in 1935. Koirala was very good at depicting the character and mind of women. Four other stories of Koirala were included in &quot;Katha Kusum&quot; (an anthology of Nepali stories), published in 1938 in Darjeeling. As a social realist, with good psychological insight as he was first writer to write stories and novels based on human psychology in history of Nepalese literature, Koirala had established himself as one of the most important Nepali short story writers by 1938. &quot;Doshi Chashma&quot;, Koirala&#x27;s anthology of sixteen short stories, was published in 1949. He was one of the greatest writer to contribute to the Nepali literature.

Koirala was very busy in the 1950s as he was often found amidst the political situations of Nepal. He was, however, able to write an incomplete novel &quot;Hitlar ra Yahudi&quot; (&quot;Hitler and the Jews&quot;) in the form of travelogue. The 1960s were very productive for Koirala in terms of his literary output. He wrote many novels and short stories in jail during 1960–68. They include: &quot;Teen Ghumti&quot; (&quot;Three Turns&quot;), 1968; &quot;Narendra Dai&quot; (&quot;Brother Narendra&quot;), 1969; &quot;Sumnima&quot; (&quot;A story of the first Kirata woman&quot;), 1969; &quot;Modiain&quot; (&quot;The Grocer&#x27;s Wife&quot;), 1980; &quot;Shweta Bhairavi&quot; (&quot;The White Goddess of Terror&quot;), 1983; &quot;Babu Ama ra chora&quot; (&quot;Father, mother and sons&quot;), 1989; and an incomplete autobiography &quot;Mero Katha&quot; (&quot;My Story&quot;), 1983, and many more yet to be published.

Koirala also has dozens of political essays including the following: &quot;Rajatantra ra Lokatantra&quot; (&quot;Monarchy and Democracy&quot;), 1960; &quot;Thichieka Janata Jagisake&quot; (&quot;The Oppressed People Rise&quot;), 1969; &quot;Rastriyata Nepalko Sandarbhama&quot; (&quot;Nationalism in the Context of Nepal&quot;), 1970; &quot;Kranti: Ek Anivaryata&quot; (&quot;Revolution: An Absolute Necessity&quot;), 1970; &quot;Panchayati Vyavastha Prajatantrik Chaina&quot; (&quot;The Panchayat System is not Democratic&quot;), 1978; &quot;Prajatantra ra Samajvad&quot; (&quot;Democracy and Socialism&quot;), 1979; and &quot;Rastriya Ekata ko Nimti Ahwan&quot; (&quot;A Call for National Reconciliation&quot;), 1980.

Koirala&#x27;s writings (both political and literary) were banned until recently. Nepalese youths spent several years of imprisonment just on the charges of possessing Koirala&#x27;s writings. Another problem is that his rare and important writings have been scattered all over. Old newspapers and magazines (including the underground publications) have to be researched. Libraries, museums, and archives in Kathmandu, Banaras, Calcutta, New Delhi, London, Paris, Berkeley, Stanford, and many other places have to be visited to collect the materials on Koirala. As a result, one can hope to produce volumes of his political writings and literary works.

Koirala was the focus of Nepalese politics during the 1950s, 1960s, and the 1970s. Even today, long after his death, people of Nepal feel that the restoration of multi-party democracy is a tribute to him. Koirala was also one of the most important literary figures of Nepal. In politics Koirala was a social democrat; in literature he was an existentialist especially in his novel &quot;Tin Ghumti&quot; (&quot;Three Turns&quot;). He said that he wrote his literary works to satisfy his anarchist impulses, impulses which revolted against the traditional order of things. But as a social democrat he was in search of a political order that was agreeable to every citizen of Nepal.

As a politician, Koirala struggled throughout his life for the establishment of a multi-party democracy in his country. Traditional forces, still strong to resist such effort, made it very hard for &quot;B. P.&quot; to accomplish his political mission. As a social democrat, Koirala differed with communists; as he often said man cannot live by bread alone. He also differed with the capitalists as he thought that unbridled consumerism was immoral, and that the appalling exploitation of the world&#x27;s resources was short-sighted and unrealistic. He believed that only socialism could guarantee political freedom and equal economic opportunities to the people. He said, &quot;socialism is the wave of the future.&quot;

Koirala had studied economics, logic, literature, and law. He was a voracious reader of English, German, French, Russian, Hindi, Bengali and Nepali literature. His educational background and artistic abilities were combined in his own works to present a view of life in an artistic, logical and compelling manner. He would thus shake the conscience of Nepali readers by questioning their unreflective acceptance of the traditional value systems.

Koirala&#x27;s short stories were first published in the 1930s in Hindi and Nepali literary magazines. Koirala first came to notice in Nepali literature because often his characters seemed to have been treated with an understanding of Freudian psychoanalysis. Even when a short story or novel of Koirala was not Freudian in its approach, it was still noteworthy to Nepali readers because he presented an unconventional approach to life.

&quot;Modiaain&quot; (&quot;The Grocer&#x27;s wife&quot;) is probably his shortest novel. In &quot;Modiaain&quot; Koirala looks at the Mahabharata war from the point of view of a young woman who loses her husband to the war. This woman was not alone. There were hundreds of thousands of young women who were widowed by the war. Thus, Koirala presents a passionate plea against the philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita, which assumes that the world is but an illusion and thus makes life and death a meaningless phenomena and that the observance of one&#x27;s own duty is the ultimate priority. Koirala was against war, and by looking at the Vedanta philosophy and the issue of war from a war widow&#x27;s point of view, he once again shakes the conscience of the Nepali readers who generally tend to accept the philosophy of Vedanta especially its idea of karma (fate). Characteristically, Koirala presents one more instance in which he analyses the mind of a woman, as he did in most of his short stories and novels.

==Legacy==
The following institutions have been set up in his memory:

#In 1992, the B. P. Koirala Nepal Health Foundation was inaugurated by the prime ministers of India and Nepal with the objective of supplementing the normal cooperation and interaction at the Government-to-Government level by providing statesmen, media persons, etc. to constantly nurture and further enhance the understanding and friendship between two countries. The trust is a symbol of Nepali renaissance.
#In 1992, the Government of Nepal has established the B. P. Koirala Memorial Planetarium, Observatory and Science Museum Development Board in 1992 in order to establish Planetaria, Observatories and Science Museums in Nepal &amp; conduct research activities in the area of Astronomy, Astrophysics and Cosmology.
#B. P. Koirala Memorial Trust (B. P. Trust) was established in 2000 in memory of the late B. P. Koirala. It is the only legal institution approved by the government of Nepal to collect royalties, claim copyrights and allow legal permission regarding B. P. Koirala. B. P. Trust receives financial support from the government. The establishment of this Trust in B. P. Koirala&#x27;s memory can be considered as a remarkable achievement.

Also, various programs are organized in Nepal as well as outside Nepal to remember his selfless contributions to Nepal.

<doc id="1113364" wikidata="Q11860652" url="?curid=1113364" title="Greatest Hits, Volume II (Chicago album)">
<text>Greatest Hits, Volume II is the second greatest hits album by American rock band Chicago, released on November 23, 1981 by Columbia Records.

==Background==
Following the poor reception of 1980&#x27;s &quot;Chicago XIV&quot;, Columbia Records dropped Chicago from its roster and cancelled a lucrative contract that had recently been signed. While the band had begun its association with David Foster and was in the process of building a new identity, Columbia had contractual obligations for a new release. Therefore, the label wanted a sequel to the band&#x27;s first, and highly successful, hits package which had been 1975&#x27;s &quot;Chicago IX: Chicago&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;. This sequel, &quot;Volume II&quot;, featured bare-bones album artwork consisting of a collage of photos from around the city of Chicago. The album lacked liner notes and was the only Chicago album not to have its own rendition of the band&#x27;s distinctive logo; a small picture of the logo from the band&#x27;s second album appears in the center of the collage.

Released in November 1981, &quot;Greatest Hits, Volume II&quot; primarily sampled material from &quot;Chicago VIII&quot; through 1978&#x27;s &quot;Hot Streets,&quot; after which the hits stopped coming, though it also stretches back to pick up overlooked hits from the era first covered by the original compilation album. Appearing just before Chicago&#x27;s unexpected career revival with &quot;Chicago 16,&quot; it reached number 171 in the US.

<doc id="1113365" wikidata="Q3453599" url="?curid=1113365" title="SHI Stadium">
<text>SHI Stadium is the football stadium at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. Rutgers Scarlet Knights football, Rutgers Scarlet Knights men&#x27;s lacrosse, and women&#x27;s lacrosse use the venue for home games. It is located on the Busch Campus at Rutgers, and overlooks the Raritan River to the South. The stadium was opened as Rutgers Stadium on September 3, 1994, when the Rutgers Scarlet Knights hosted the Kent State Golden Flashes. It currently seats 52,454 spectators after a 2009 expansion in the south end zone student section.

==Current facilities==
SHI Stadium underwent significant reconstruction from 2008 to 2009 to increase its capacity to 52,454. The stadium features a 5,000-seat upper deck on each side of the playing field, as well as 968 loge and club seats on the mezzanine level of the East side of the stadium. A two-story press box sits on the mezzanine level of the West side of the stadium. Electronic ribbon scoreboards spanning the length of the field along the bottom of both upper decks were installed prior to the 2008 season, which complement the video scoreboard in the South end zone. Also located in the South end zone is the Brown Football Recruiting Pavilion and Welcome Center, part of the 2008–2009 expansion project.

The stadium also features light stanchions that allow for night games, a cannon for firing if Rutgers scores, concessions, and restrooms. Until 2004, the field maintained a grass surface, but has since been replaced with FieldTurf.

==History==

The first intercollegiate football game, in which Rutgers College beat Princeton (then the &quot;College of New Jersey&quot;) 6–4 on November 6, 1869, was played at &quot;College Field&quot;, which is now the location of the College Avenue Gymnasium and its parking lot. From 1891 to 1938, the Rutgers football team played at &quot;Neilson Field&quot; on the College Avenue Campus in New Brunswick.

With the aid of grants from the Works Progress Administration, and after three years of construction, the original Rutgers Stadium was completed in 1938. The first game in the new stadium was against Hampden-Sydney in front of an estimated crowd of about 10,000 persons. Rutgers was victorious in the contest, defeating Hampden-Sydney 32–0. The stadium was dedicated on November 5, 1938 in a game against Princeton. Rutgers won the game, 20-18. It was the first time Rutgers had defeated Princeton since the first intercollegiate football game in 1869.

On September 27, 1969, Rutgers and Princeton met for The Centennial Game at old Rutgers Stadium, which was played in front of 31,000 fans. Rutgers won 29-0, its 10th win in 60 tries against the Tigers.

The current stadium was built on the site of the original old Rutgers Stadium. During the construction of the current stadium, the Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team played the 1993 season at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, a facility operated by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA). The NJSEA financed the construction of the stadium via the issuance of bonds. The Scarlet Knights had previously played several games at Giants Stadium, including the first college football game hosted at that venue: a 47-0 victory over Columbia University on October 23, 1976.

The new Rutgers Stadium originally was constructed to accommodate 41,500 fans at its maximum capacity and was officially opened on September 3, 1994, in a game against Kent State University. Light stanchions were integrated into the design so night games could be played. A two-story press box that fits 200 reporters was also constructed and is still in use today. A free-standing scoreboard was built near the south end zone, which did not originally contain any seating areas. The original design of the stadium replicated the shape of a horseshoe, with the &quot;open&quot; end located near the south end zone.

Heralded by many newspapers, sports writers, and Rutgers fans as the &quot;most important game in Rutgers history&quot;, on November 9, 2006, a then record crowd of 44,111 saw the Scarlet Knights upset the Louisville Cardinals at Rutgers Stadium, 28-25. The Scarlet Knights were ranked #15 and the Louisville Cardinals #3 in the nation in the Associated Press poll at the time. The game drew ESPN&#x27;s third-largest TV audience for a college football game up to that point in time. The official attendance exceeded the normal maximum capacity of the stadium due to the temporary addition of bleachers in the South end zone of the stadium. The bleachers were used to seat additional students.

===Stadium expansion (2008–2009)===

In January 2008, the Board of Governors of Rutgers University announced a $102 million stadium expansion project in order to increase the stadium&#x27;s seating capacity to nearly 56,000. However, the scale of the project was slightly reduced due to a poor economy and financial difficulties, resulting in a new maximum capacity of precisely 52,454.

The first phase of the project, which included the addition 968 club seats and related infrastructure to the East mezzanine level of the stadium, was completed on time and within budget for the 2008 football season. The second phase included the addition of approximately 11,500 seats to the previously &quot;open&quot; South end zone, as well as supplementary restrooms and concession stands to the southern end of the stadium. The second phase of the project also involved the addition of a large scoreboard in the South end zone, which is 38&#x27; tall by 112&#x27; wide, for a total surface area of 4,256 sq ft. The old scoreboard (since demolished) was 22&#x27; tall by 30&#x27; wide, for a total surface area of . The sound system was also enhanced as a part of the second phase of the expansion.

In addition to adding seats, concession stands, and bathrooms to the south end zone, the stadium expansion project called for a new entrance off River Road. The facade of the entrance is adorned with brownstone.

====Brown Football Recruiting Pavilion and Welcome Center====
On July 14, 2009, the Rutgers Board of Governors unanimously approved a $5 million donation specifically appropriated for a recruiting lounge in the newly expanded end zone. The lounge had been included in the original expansion design, but was later deferred after the Board of Governors revised the expansion financing plan. The donation was provided by two Rutgers alumni. The lounge was named after one of the donors, Greg Brown, who is the President and Co-CEO of Motorola. The second donor requested anonymity. Construction on the lounge commenced in August 2009, and was completed in December of that same year.

The facility seats approximately 300 people and serves as a multi-purpose center for the university. The pavilion hosts and accommodates recruits around the year and also holds fundraising events for potential donors. The center is also used during tours for prospective students.

====Expansion financing plan====
The $102 million price tag of the expansion project was to originally be financed via private fundraising ($30 million) and the issuance of bonds ($72 million). The private fundraising effort, however, fell significantly short of the original goal.

This situation prompted the Board of Governors of Rutgers University to approve a new financing plan for the stadium expansion in which the entire amount of $102 million was to be borrowed. Specifically, the university issued $85 million in bonds, and borrowed the remaining $17 million by way of low-interest commercial paper. In addition, a few aspects of the stadium expansion project were scaled back, including a reduction in the number of new seats (the original plan called for 14,000 seats, but only 11,500 were actually added). Also included in the original expansion plan was the construction of new locker rooms in the South end zone. The construction of these locker rooms was deferred to a later date.

====Naming rights====

For decades, &quot;Rutgers Stadium&quot; had been the name of the school&#x27;s football facility. However, in June 2010, Rutgers University put up for sale the naming rights to the stadium in order to bring in much needed revenue. Rutgers hired Brooklyn Sports &amp; Entertainment and IMG College to act as agents in making a deal, who had previously negotiated deals on the now-Brooklyn Nets&#x27; home arenas in New Jersey and New York. On June 22, 2011, it was announced that High Point Solutions, based in Sparta, had purchased the rights, and that the stadium would be known as High Point Solutions Stadium. In May 2018, High Point Solutions announced they were rebranding the company to just be HighPoint.com. As a result, the name of the stadium was changed to HighPoint.com Stadium. On July 19, 2019, Rutgers signed a new naming rights agreement with Somerset-based IT firm SHI International Corp. The stadium was then renamed SHI Stadium.

==Attendance records==

The stadium attendance records were repeatedly broken throughout the 2006 and 2007 football seasons as the football program experienced a drastic resurgence. On October 18, 2007, a record 44,267 spectators attended a game in which the Scarlet Knights played against the then #2 ranked South Florida Bulls. The Scarlet Knights would go on to win that game, and the attendance on that night would be the highest prior to the 2008–2009 stadium expansion.

The new attendance record was set in the 2022 match-up against Penn State. 55,676 spectators watched Rutgers lose 55-10 in a lopsided affair at the hands of the 11th ranked Nittany Lions. The top five games in terms of attendance at Rutgers Stadium are listed below:
Rutgers men&#x27;s Lacrosse hold the attendance record in SHI Stadium outside of football. They set their attendance record on April 16, 2023 with a number of 5,823 people in attendance in an 11-8 loss to Maryland.

<text>The Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front (AINDF; ) is a banned united front organization in South Korea.

The AINDF is guided by &quot;Juche&quot;, the official state ideology of North Korea, and aims to carry out a popular revolution in South Korea, achieve independence by removing the United States Forces Korea, and hasten the reunification of the country. The AINDF is identical in organization to the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea, the &quot;de jure&quot; united front of North Korea, and has missions in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang (the only ostensibly South Korean organization to) and another in Japan.

The AINDF is banned in South Korea under the National Security Law as a spy group for the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea, the ruling party of North Korea, but operates clandestinely within the country and is regarded as a legitimate organization by North Korea.

== History ==
The Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front was officially founded on 25 August 1969 by Kim Jong-tae (), who published a magazine named &quot;Chongmaek&quot; (), and Choi Yong-do as the Revolutionary Party for Reunification (), with a history dating back to the 1964 formation of a preparatory committee. The group was established during the period of the Third Republic of Korea, an anti-communist military dictatorship under President Park Chung Hee, and both founders were executed along with other leaders of the organization; other members were sentenced to long prison terms. Kim Jong-tae&#x27;s wife and two children were never seen again.

On 27 July 1985, it renamed itself to the National Democratic Front of South Korea (), and renamed its propaganda broadcasting station (that had a main station in Haeju) from &quot;Revolutionary Party for Reunification&quot; () to &quot;Voice of National Salvation&quot; (). It adopted its current name on 23 March 2005.

<doc id="1113371" wikidata="Q3595444" url="?curid=1113371" title="Upton, Merseyside">
<text>Upton is a village in the northern part of the Wirral Peninsula, England, and is situated within of Birkenhead, of the Dee Estuary, a similar distance from the River Mersey, and from Liverpool Bay. The village is a ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. Upton was in the traditional county of Cheshire. At the 2011 census, the population was 16,130.

Upton was originally settled as an Anglo-Saxon farming community, and remained as a farming community until the village&#x27;s rapid urbanisation and expansion from the mid-19th century. This was brought about by the development of Liverpool as a major port, with rail and road links across the Mersey estuary. The village now has a strong service economy which is based primarily around healthcare and retail, with a variety of places nearby, and within the village, to pursue sport and leisure activities.

==History==
===Etymology===
The name Upton is from the Old English &quot;upp&quot;, meaning up, high or a hill, and &quot;tūn&quot;, meaning a farmstead or settlement. Upton therefore could be explained as meaning Hill Farm. This is still recognisable today, as Upton is on a low hill. As the name Upton is relatively common, it was sometimes known historically as Upton in Wyrhale (in 1307) or Upton by Birkenhead.

The name Overchurch may translate as &quot;shore church&quot;, from the Old English &quot;ofer&quot; meaning a shore and &quot;cirice&quot;, a church. This implies that, during the Anglo-Saxon era, the shoreline of the Irish Sea was much closer to the centre of the village.

===Ownership of the manor===
Upton was originally settled as a farming community, during the Anglo-Saxon period. In Norman times, Upton was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Optone&quot; and was written as being in the possession of William Malbank.
The manor passed to the Orrebies under the family of Praers, and then through the Arderne family, and by marriage to Baldwin of Bold in 1310. His descendants owned the manor for six generations, before it was sold in 1614. Subsequent owners have included the Earls of Derby. Notably, as a likely consequence of the 8th Earl of Derby who lived at nearby Bidston Hall. From Elizabethan times, the manor was associated with Upton Hall, which passed hands along with the manor. Upton Hall was sold by the Webster family to the Society of the Faithful Companions of Jesus (FCJ) who turned it into a school (currently Upton Hall School FCJ).

===Early modern===

Upton was the primary economic centre of northern Wirral until the industrial development of Birkenhead during the mid-19th century. Five important local roads converged on the village, and its main thoroughfare was the place of a weekly market, recorded as being held from 1662. 
Fairs were also held in the village at Michaelmas and Easter.

When the original parish church at Overchurch was pulled down in 1813, a runestone, attributed to the 7th or 8th centuries, was discovered in the ruins. It has been interpreted as a memorial to Æthelmund, perhaps a local leader or missionary. The stone is now kept at the Grosvenor Museum in Chester.
&quot;..though now only a small village, Upton was formerly considered the metropolis of the lower mediety of Wirral, and had two annual fairs of considerable importance, and also a weekly market that was discontinued in 1620, the village having been recently almost entirely rebuilt, contains several good houses, among which may be particularly mentioned Upton Hall ...&quot;

—said of Upton in the &quot;History of the Hundred of Wirral&quot; by William Williams Mortimer, 1847.
A major contributor to the village was William Inman, owner of the Inman Line, who donated money for the construction of St. Mary&#x27;s Church. Inman resided at Upton Manor, within the grounds of Upton Park. Both Upton Manor and St. Mary&#x27;s Church were designed by John Cunningham.

Few buildings remain in Upton from before the mid-19th Century. Two notable examples are the Stone House at the top of the village, on Ford Road, and the Old Smithy on Rake Lane. These buildings are both built of local red sandstone, hewn into large blocks. They are both of similar material and style to many old buildings which are found throughout Cheshire and Lancashire farming communities. Neither of these buildings is designated as a listed building.

===World War II===
Just prior to World War II, the War Department requisitioned a large amount of land to the northern side of Arrowe Farm, next to the Police station. This was used for military weapons storage. The camp was known as 64 Anti-Aircraft Ordnance Depot. The site had three reinforced bunkers for storage of ordnance, in the area which is now occupied by the Sainsbury&#x27;s building. The site eventually came into the use of the Territorial Army and part of the area is currently in use by army and air force cadets.

During this period, RAF West Kirby was also situated just under west the centre of the village, along Saughall Massie Road, and backed on to Larton.

===Civic history===
Upton was a township in the ancient parish of Overchurch in the Wirral Hundred, which became a civil parish in 1866 named Upton by Birkenhead. 
Between 1894 and 1933 Upton was administered as part of Wirral Rural District. 
The civil parish was disbanded on 1 April 1933 and mergd with Birkenhead St Mary and Wallasey and became part of the county boroughs of Birkenhead and Wallasey. In 1931 the parish had a population of 2564.

On 1 April 1974, local government reorganisation in England and Wales resulted in most of the Wirral Peninsula, including Upton, transferring from the county of Cheshire to the newly created county of Merseyside.

==Geography, geology and environment==
Upton lies at the geographic centre of the northern part of the Wirral Peninsula, from the Irish Sea at Leasowe Lighthouse, north-east of the Dee Estuary and a similar distance south-west of the River Mersey. Upton sits on a low-lying hill, in a wide and shallow glacial U-shaped valley, formed during the Quaternary Ice Age, between Bidston Hill and Thurstaston Hill. The underlying bedrock is Triassic bunter sandstone of the Helsby Sandstone Formation and the Sidmouth Mudstone Formation. This is overlain with boulder clay from the Quaternary Ice Age, similar to the nearby Dee Cliffs, and clay soil. The bedrock is not usually visible, as it is on the nearby Bidston Hill.

The highest point in Upton is above sea level, just off the junction with the A551 and the B5139, at Moreton Road, in the centre of the village. A further prominence of above sea level is at Upton Manor, from the centre of the village. Most of the populated area is more than above sea level, and most of the ground is on a gentle hillside. Consequently, Upton has avoided the significant flooding which can happen in the nearby low-lying Fender valley. Due to its inland location and elevation Upton is not prone to coastal flooding, which can happen at West Kirby, Hoylake, Meols and New Brighton.

Upton is bounded by Arrowe Brook, at Upton Meadow, and the River Fender which is alongside the M53 motorway. Both are tributaries of the Birket, which discharges into West Float and then into the River Mersey.

===Upton Meadow Millennium Wood===
Upton Meadow Millennium Wood is an ancient, semi-natural woodland, a community forest and a county wildlife site which has informal public access. The area has of footpaths and a bridleway along the western boundary. The area is one of the last remaining unbuilt, natural areas in Upton. Parts of the site were planted in 1997 and the site was leased to the Woodland Trust on a 99-year lease, from Wirral Borough Council, in the same year. The woodland contains a mixture of species such as oak, ash, hazel, birch, blackthorn and hawthorn. Additional plantations by the local council, in 1980, have also included maple, grey alder, grey willow and guelder rose. Other plants include holly, English elm and sycamore. The area has a pond which contains a good population of invertebrates and some amphibians, with a significant colony of common toad. The meadow is and the habitat is rare, within the local area.

===Climate===
Upton has a temperate maritime climate (Köppen: Cfb), similar to much of the rest of the United Kingdom. Being close to the sea and sheltered from the prevailing south-westerly wind by Snowdonia, the area has relatively warm summers. The winters are generally mild and wet, mornings with light frost are common, and there are few days of snow. The nearest official weather station, as the crow flies, is at Hall Road in Crosby, which is about away.

===Wirral Business Park===
A former major employer was the Champion spark plug factory on Arrowebrook Road. The factory was opened in 1968. At its peak, the business employed over 1,000 people in Upton. The factory was closed in 2006 with production transferred to Italy. After the business withdrew from the area, the buildings were allowed to remain and the site is now operated as the Wirral Business Park and, informally, as the Champion&#x27;s Business Park. The site is now primarily intended for the use of small businesses which need a significant degree of indoor space. Vacant space, at the business park, has been utilised quite rapidly, since the closure of the Champion&#x27;s business. Businesses, at the site, now include a furniture retailer, a recording studio and rehearsal room, a hydroponics store and a self-storage facility amongst others.

===Upton Retail Park===
Upton Retail Park is a small retail park which was developed in the early 1990s. The development was built on of Upton Meadow, adjacent to Arrowe Park Road and Upton Bypass. There was local protest to the new development on a green space. The original businesses to open on the site were J Sainsbury PLC and Homebase, which still operate. McDonald&#x27;s opened shortly after the retail park was opened to the public, and Argos opened around 2010.

===Other shops===
Other small shopping areas are located on Royden Road and along Manor Drive, the latter having a branch of The Co-operative Food.

===Services===

Arrowe Park Hospital is barely a mile from the centre of the village, and includes an Accident and Emergency department. Upton is served by Upton Group Practice, a dentist and two opticians. Pharmacies in the village include Boots Pharmacy and Numark, as well as further pharmacies at Upton Group Practice and Arrowe Park Hospital. Upton is also served by several residential, care and nursing homes, one of which is situated at Upton Manor and another on Ford Road, as well as a recently built care home on Salacre Lane.

Upton has its own Police station, which is a branch of Merseyside Police, and a Fire station which is a branch of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, as well as an ambulance station, operated by the North West Ambulance Service, at the nearby Arrowe Park Hospital. The village has a Jobcentre Plus, as well as a postal sorting office. There is also a driving test centre on Arrowe Park Road and two MOT test centres, one of which is on Manor Drive and the other being on Arrowe Park Road, next to the fire station. There are two petrol stations in the village, these being operated by Shell, which is a 24-hour business, as well as Sainsbury&#x27;s. Both of these are situated next to Upton Bypass at Arrowe Park Road. Meanwhile, the Arrowebrook telephone exchange is situated on Church Road and serves approximately 25,000 residential premises and 686 non-residential premises. The exchange is operated by BT. This provides ADSL and SDSL services, among others.

The village once had several toll houses, only one of which now remains. The toll houses were used by passing travellers, during the 19th century, to pay for use of the turnpike. These were situated at the junction of Saughall Massie Lane and Old Greasby Road, at the top of Moreton Road, and the Arrowe Park Road junction with Arrowe Brook Road. This final toll house is the only surviving example.

== Community ==
===Schools===

Upton has a number of schools. These include Overchurch Primary School and St. Joseph&#x27;s Primary School, which are both on Moreton Road, and Hayfield School on Manor Drive. These all cater for children between the ages of four and eleven. Overchurch Primary School is separated into two parts. These are Overchurch Infants&#x27; School, which is for children between the ages of 4 and 8 years, and Overchurch Junior School, which is for children from 9 to 11 years old. Upton Hall School FCJ, a grammar school for girls, is situated near to the centre of the village, with entrances on Moreton Road and Saughall Massie Lane. The original school in Upton was situated on Rake Lane, before moving to the building which is now part of St. Mary&#x27;s church hall, and then onto Overchurch Primary School. The original school building still stands in Rake Lane and was used as a church hall for teenagers, prior to the opening of &quot;The Bank&quot;. Other former schools include St. Benedict&#x27;s High School which has now been closed and demolished, as well as Kingsley Nursery School, which suffered a similar fate. Upton is also home to Wirral&#x27;s only bilingual day nursery, Habla which caters for children aged 6 months to 5 years.

===Churches===
St. Mary&#x27;s Church is Upton&#x27;s Church of England parish church. This is a large church, which was consecrated on 28 April 1868.
The church had its own office and meeting room, situated in Holmleigh, which was next door to the church hall, on Church Road. Holmleigh was originally built by William Inman, for his estate bailiff, in 1869. The building was given to the church, in 1884, by another owner and became the vicarage in 1911. A new vicarage was built in 1928, further down Church Road, and the building was sold. However, the church repurchased Holmleigh in 1985, when the building acquired its present use. St. Mary&#x27;s Church replaced Holmleigh and the church hall, with modern housing. This led to some opposition to the proposal.

St. Joseph&#x27;s Church, the local Roman Catholic parish church, was opened on 31 August 1954. Upton&#x27;s United Reformed Church was opened on 11 May 1900, with the final service held on 26 July 2015.

====Former Churches and Religious Buildings====
The original Norman church was a steepled church, of decorative design, and was situated opposite Upton Manor on Moreton Road. The earliest reference to the church is in 1347. The steeple was damaged by a storm in 1709 and, by 1813, the church was in such poor condition that it was petitioned to be demolished. The church is understood to have been built on the site of at least one previous Saxon church.

The 1837 tithe map of the area indicates a half-circle of standing stones, around a wooded hollow which was situated next to the church, at a diameter of . Although much detail is lost to history, this has raised the possibility that the site was once a stone circle and, therefore, a pre-Christian, Neolithic religious site.

Greenbank Church was built in 1813 and was situated closer to the centre of the village, next to Greasby Road. This church reused material from the former Norman church, though was of much simpler design. This church was used until the construction of St. Mary&#x27;s and was later demolished. During which time, the Overchurch runic stone was discovered.

The priory was originally known as The Parsonage. This building was situated on Ford Road, was constructed before 1850, and was used as the vicarage until 1911. The building was quite large, with seven bedrooms. The building no longer stands, having been demolished in the 1950s. However, the wall and the walled-in gateway still remain, on Ford Road.

===Leisure===

Victory Hall, a community hall rebuilt in 1963, was originally sited in a large Victorian villa, which had been purchased by public subscription. Upton Library was opened in 1936 and built in the Art Deco style of architecture. The village&#x27;s war memorial is located within its grounds.

The Village Youth Project, known as &quot;The Bank&quot;, is a youth club set up in 1999. This provides a range of activities for the youth of Upton. The club runs various events for the community, including a popular annual fair, situated at Overchurch Primary School each summer. The club also organises many residential visits to various parts of the United Kingdom.

Overchurch Upton Scout Group was formed in 1924, and is situated on Salacre Lane. The site of the scout hut was acquired after the 3rd World Scout Jamboree, held less than a mile away, in Arrowe Park, in 1929.

====Historic public houses====

The village has two historic public houses which are close to the centre. These are &quot;Eagle and Crown&quot;, built around 1840, and the &quot;Horse and Jockey&quot;. Built around 1850, the &quot;Horse and Jockey&quot; used to be situated opposite the &quot;Eagle and Crown&quot; and was owned by William Inman until 1875. The old &quot;Horse and Jockey&quot; building was demolished in the 1960s, before moving to new premises nearby. Meanwhile, the &quot;Overchurch Hotel&quot; and the &quot;Stirrup&quot; are situated away from the centre of the village. Upton also used to have a beer house known as &quot;The Traveller&#x27;s Rest&quot;. This beer house closed in 1903, although the building remains.

====Parks and Commons====
Upton has a number of parks and commons, the largest of which is Arrowe Park, which is less than a mile from the centre of the village. This park is also home to Arrowe Park Hospital and was the location of the 3rd World Scout Jamboree, in 1929. The park is used, weekly, by amateur football teams playing against the Arrowe Park Blades FC and for the Wirral Radio Control Flying Society.

Upton Park is the second largest park in the area. This park is situated near to Upton Manor and next to the M53 motorway, on the border with Moreton. The park used to have a racecourse and was part of the property of Upton Manor. This park has an annual firework display, which is free, on Guy Fawkes Night.

Warwick Park is a small suburban park with an area of and which is situated in Overchurch. This park has its own group of friends. The park was originally known as Warwick Hay. 
Overchurch Park is situated nearby to Warwick Park, and includes the site of the old Norman Church and graveyard, which have been scheduled as monuments by English Heritage.

Upton Meadow is a public common with a semi-natural woodland and of footpaths. This area is bordered by Arrowe Brook and separates Upton from Greasby. Meanwhile, Salacre Common is also a public common, but somewhat smaller. Salacre common was originally the front garden of a large house and is the closest green space to the centre of the village.

===Sport===

The village is represented in sport by Upton Cricket Club, which was established in 1901 by William Hannay, following a lease of land from Lord Leverhulme. The cricket club originally had its own tennis and football clubs. However, the tennis club had folded, on this site, by 1968.

Upton Victory Hall Lawn Tennis &amp; Badminton Club was established in 1919, and was situated behind a large house on the corner of Salacre Lane, known as &quot;The Elms&quot;. The Elms building was sold in 1963, and Victory Hall was built behind the house, before the house was demolished. The tennis club has four grass courts and four AstroTurf courts. The clubhouse is a separate building from Victory Hall, and has its own bar, function room and an entrance on Rake Lane. The sports club also provides facilities for croquet and bowls.

In football, Upton FC was founded in 1994, and has teams for both boys and girls of all abilities and ages from six onwards.

Upton Park is an area of recreational open space and woodland. The park was part of William Inman&#x27;s Upton Manor estate and had included a racecourse between 1922 and 1924. Part of the Upton Park site is now the Moreton Spur road, connected to the M53 motorway.

==Transport==
===Roads===

Upton today is most notable for its central location between Birkenhead and West Kirby. The consequence of this is that road transport through Upton is uncharacteristically efficient for the rural suburban area of Wirral. Upton is situated at the junction of roads from Birkenhead, Moreton (the A551), Greasby (the B5139), Saughall Massie and Arrowe Park (the A551). The road network was further enhanced with the building of a bypass (the A5027) in the early 1980s. The M53 motorway, at Junction 2, is situated less than a mile from the centre of the village and connects directly to the bypass.

===Buses===
The first bus to run from Upton village was a horse-drawn bus, in 1891. This bus operated to Claughton Village. Whilst the first motorised Birkenhead Corporation bus worked on 14 July 1920. Until deregulation of the bus services, in 1986, Upton was served by both the forerunner to Merseytravel, the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive (MPTE) and the separate operator, Crosville.

Present-day services are run primarily by Arriva, and are coordinated by Merseytravel.
The village has bus stops along all four of the main roads entering the village. Merseytravel&#x27;s daily &quot;Saveaway&quot; &quot;Area B&quot; and &quot;All Zones&quot; tickets are valid to use from any bus stop in Upton, on the basis of being for the passenger of relevant age, in-date and for use after 9:30am.

===Railways===
Upton is not part of the major electrified Merseyrail Wirral line from Birkenhead to West Kirby, which instead passes around the more densely populated coast Upton railway station exists as part of the Borderlands line between Bidston and Wrexham and is operated by Transport for Wales, with a diesel service. However, the station is within the Merseytravel area. Journeys can be made from the station with a daily &quot;Saveaway&quot; ticket. This is a reasonably priced ticket, and allows unlimited travel within the Merseytravel area, for one day, as far afield as Chester, Southport, Ormskirk and Newton-le-Willows, as well as Birkenhead and Liverpool. Though, due to its location, the station is more of service to the Noctorum community, rather than Upton. This is not considered a problem however, as the locality is well served by regular bus services.

===Cycling===
National Cycle Route 56 passes along the eastern side of the village. This route goes from Chester to Liverpool via Leasowe and Seacombe and includes part of the Wirral Way, along its course.

<text>The Nicaraguan Socialist Party (&quot;Partido Socialista Nicaragüense&quot;) is a political party in Nicaragua. Founded in July 1944 by Dr. Mario Flores Ortiz. PSN operated as the official communist party in the country. At the time of its foundation, PSN supported the regime of Anastasio Somoza García. PSN considered that Somoza (nominally a liberal) was an anti-fascist ally.

== History ==
In the mid-1960s the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 250. After the surge of the FSLN (which had its origins in PSN), PSN was gradually side-lined.

In 1967 a group of radicals who opted for armed struggle were expelled. They formed the Socialist Workers Party.

In 1974 PSN joined UDEL.

From 1976 onwards there was a PSN breakaway group, called the Nicaraguan Socialist Party (de los Sánchez).

Towards the end of the Somoza regime, the PSN established the Organización Militar del Pueblo (Military Organization of the People). The OMP conducted a few attacks against the regime.

In 1990 PSN joined hands with right-wing forces in the National Opposition Union to topple the Sandinista government. PSN still exists, but is no longer a communist party per se.

PSN publishes &quot;El Popular&quot;.

For the 2006 Nicaraguan general election, it joined with the Sandinista Renovation Movement.

<doc id="1113382" wikidata="Q1146374" url="?curid=1113382" title="Plantigrade">
<text>In terrestrial animals, plantigrade locomotion means walking with the toes and metatarsals flat on the ground. It is one of three forms of locomotion adopted by terrestrial mammals. The other options are digitigrade, walking on the toes and fingers with the heel and wrist permanently raised, and unguligrade, walking on the nail or nails of the toes (the hoof) with the heel/wrist and the digits permanently raised. The leg of a plantigrade mammal includes the bones of the upper leg (femur/humerus) and lower leg (tibia and fibula/radius and ulna). The leg of a digitigrade mammal also includes the metatarsals/metacarpals, the bones that in a human compose the arch of the foot and the palm of the hand. The leg of an unguligrade mammal also includes the phalanges, the finger and toe bones.
Among extinct animals, most early mammals such as pantodonts were plantigrade. A plantigrade foot is the primitive condition for mammals; digitigrade and unguligrade locomotion evolved later. Among archosaurs, the pterosaurs were partially plantigrade and walked on the whole of the hind foot and the fingers of the hand-wing. Out of the plantigrade animals, only a few, such as humans, kangaroos and certain rodents, are obligate bipeds, while most others are functional bipeds. 

==List of plantigrade mammals==
Plantigrade mammal species include (but are not limited to):
*Several primates (including humans and lemurs)
*Carnivora:
**Ursidae: bears
**amphicyonids
**Musteloidea: skunks, raccoons, weasels, badgers, otters, and red pandas
**&quot;Barbourofelis:&quot; false saber-tooth cats
*Rodents: mice, rats, porcupines
*Hedgehogs
*Hyraxes
*Marsupialia: kangaroos, opossums

==Evolution==
The primary advantages of a plantigrade foot are stability and weight-bearing ability; plantigrade feet have the largest surface area. The primary disadvantage of a plantigrade foot is speed. With more bones and joints in the foot, the leg is both shorter and heavier at the far end, which makes it difficult to move rapidly.

In humans and other great apes, another possible advantage of a plantigrade foot is that it may enhance fighting performance by providing a more powerful stance for striking and grappling.

Plantigrade foot occurs normally in humans in static postures of standing and sitting. It should also occur normally in gait (walking). Hypertonicity, spasticity, clonus, limited range of motion, abnormal flexion neural pattern, and a plantar flexor (calf) muscle contracture, as well as some forms of footwear such as high heeled shoes may contribute to an individual only standing and/or walking on their toes. It would be evident by the observable heel rise.

<doc id="1113384" wikidata="Q8049825" url="?curid=1113384" title="Yasmin Alibhai-Brown">
<text>Yasmin Alibhai-Brown (&quot;née&quot; Damji; born 10 December 1949) is a British journalist and author. A columnist for the &quot;i &quot; newspaper and the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, she is a commentator on immigration, diversity, and multiculturalism issues.

She was the founder of the British Muslims for Secular Democracy. She was also a patron of the SI Leeds Literary Prize.

==Early life and family==
Yasmin Damji was born in 1949 into the Indian community in Kampala, Uganda. Her family belonged to the Nizari Ismaili branch of the Shia Islamic faith, and she regards herself as a Shia Muslim. Her mother was born in East Africa and her father moved there from British India in the 1920s.

After graduating in English literature from Makerere University in 1972, Alibhai-Brown left Uganda for Britain, along with her niece, Farah Damji, shortly before the expulsion of Ugandan Asians by Idi Amin, and completed a Master of Philosophy degree in literature at Linacre College, University of Oxford, in 1975. After working as a teacher, particularly with immigrants and refugees, she moved into journalism in her mid-thirties. 

Alibhai-Brown is married to Colin Brown, former chairman of the Consumer Services Panel of the Financial Services Authority, whom she met in 1988. The couple have a daughter, and Alibhai-Brown has a son from a previous marriage. Alibhai-Brown describes herself as &quot;a leftie liberal, anti-racist, feminist, Muslim. part-Pakistani...person&quot;.

==Career and views==
A journalist on the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine in the early 1980s, Alibhai-Brown contributes a weekly column to &quot;The Independent&quot;. She has also written for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, and has appeared on the current affairs TV shows &quot;Dateline London&quot; and &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;. Alibhai-Brown has won awards for her journalism, including Media Personality of the Year in 2000 (awarded by the Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy (EMMA)), the George Orwell Prize for Political Journalism in 2002, and the EMMA Award for Journalism in 2004.

Alibhai-Brown was a research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), a think tank associated with New Labour, from 1996 to 2001. She ended her connection with the Labour Party over the 2003 war in Iraq and other issues, and supported the Liberal Democrats in the 2005 and 2010 general elections. She is senior research associate at the Foreign Policy Centre, an honorary fellow at Liverpool John Moores University, and honorary visiting professor at Cardiff and Lincoln Universities.

In the New Year Honours 2001, Alibhai-Brown was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) &quot;for services to journalism&quot;. In 2003, Benjamin Zephaniah&#x27;s public refusal of an OBE inspired her to return the award. She wrote that her decision had been made partly in a growing spirit of republicanism and partly in protest at the Labour government, particularly its conduct of the war in Iraq, and she has since criticised the British honours system as &quot;beyond repair&quot;.

In 2005, she performed her autobiographical one-woman show &quot;Tales of an Extravagant Stranger&quot; at the Soho Theatre, under the auspices of the Royal Shakespeare Company. In 2006 the charity, British Muslims for Secular Democracy, was formed. The writer Imran Ahmad, who was another early committee member, cites Alibhai-Brown as the organisation&#x27;s founder. 

In May 2011, Alibhai-Brown wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot; that Muslims and others should stop focusing solely on the wrongdoings of Israel, saying: &quot;We Muslims need to accept our burdens too.&quot; She also said: &quot;It is no longer morally justifiable for activists to target only Israel and either ignore or find excuses for corrupt, murderous Arab despots. That kind of selectivity discredits pro-Palestinian campaigners and dishonours the principles of equality and human rights.&quot; Brown previously condemned ethnic minority campaigners against racism failing to mention white victims of racially motivated crimes, suggesting they were guilty of double standards. Highlighting cases such as the murder of Ross Parker, Alibhai-Brown wrote: &quot;Our values are worthless unless all victims of these senseless deaths matter equally&quot;, adding &quot;to treat some victims as more worthy of condemnation than others is unforgivable and a betrayal of anti-racism itself&quot;.

In May 2012, Alibhai-Brown received an anonymous three-page letter alleging that while the sender was a schoolgirl in the 1970s she (the anonymous sender) had been sexually abused by veteran BBC presenter Stuart Hall. After Alibhai-Brown passed the letter to police, an investigation was initiated, culminating in Hall being arrested and charged with multiple counts of sexual assault. On 16 April 2013, Hall pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting 13 girls, aged from nine to 17, during the period 1967–86. The police credited Alibhai-Brown&#x27;s actions as instrumental in triggering an investigation into Hall&#x27;s past.

In 2016, Alibhai-Brown won the Columnist of the Year Broadsheet at the British Press Awards. In 2017, she received the &quot;Outstanding Contribution to Media Award&quot; at the Asian Media Awards, presented by Sarfraz Manzoor.

She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2022.

==Criticism==
Alibhai-Brown has attracted criticism for her views. Michael Wharton has accused her of an excessive pursuit of political correctness: &quot;At 3.6 degrees on the Alibhai-Brown scale, it sets off a shrill scream that will not stop until you’ve pulled yourself together with a well-chosen anti-racist slogan.&quot;

Stephen Pollard accused her of racism and called her opinions &quot;utterly vile&quot; in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; in June 2008. In October 2009, Luciana Berger, MP and then director of Labour Friends of Israel (LFI), criticised Alibhai-Brown for writing in her column: &quot;All three parties were lavishly entertained by the over-influential Friends of Israel.&quot; Berger said that Alibhai-Brown had not attended the LFI event or provided any evidence to sustain her comment. Berger insisted the hospitality (&quot;house wine or orange juice and chips. Crisps and peanuts if you got to a bowl in time&quot;) was not lavish.

<text>The MV &quot;Bloemfontein Castle&quot; was a passenger liner. She was launched at Harland &amp; Wolff&#x27;s yard at Belfast on 25 August 1949 by Mrs Leif Egeland, wife of the High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa in London. She was completed on 25 March 1950. Built for Union-Castle Line&#x27;s Intermediate service to South and East Africa, she was their first one-class ship. She took her name after the town of Bloemfontein, capital of the Orange Free State.
The &quot;Bloemfontein Castle&quot; was given the familiar Union-Castle profile of well-raked rounded stem, cruiser stern, a low streamlined funnel and a single mast abaft the bridge, giving a well-balanced appearance. There were two hatches forward and three aft, served by six 10-ton and four 5-ton capacity derricks. Cargo &#x27;tweendeck spaces were insulated for the carriage of fruit, with certain compartments for chilled and frozen produce.
The &quot;Bloemfontein Castle&quot; was the first intermediate liner to be built since the war had ended, and the institution of a single class-tourist was an innovation for Union-Castle. She was built to cater for an expected emigrant boom and to alleviate the still considerable pressure at the time for accommodation at lower range fares. The main public rooms were on the promenade deck, a large lounge forward being extended the whole width of the ship so there were no passageways either side. Aft of this was a combined library and writing room, connected by a long gallery to a commodious smoking room. On the upper deck a dining room for 386 also extended the width of the ship. Accommodation for 739 passengers was spread through seven decks.

Some 250 of Union-Castle&#x27;s staff were invited for the shakedown cruise made from London in March, 1950. She left London on her maiden voyage on 6 April 1950 – sailing the London – Rotterdam – Las Palmas – Ascension – St. Helena – Walvis Bay – Cape Town – Port Elizabeth – East London – Durban – Lourenço Marques – Beira route that she alone served. She sometimes called at Southampton homewards during the busy fruit season.

On 8 January 1953, &quot;Bloemfontein Castle&quot; rescued 234 passengers and crew from the Holland Afrika liner which was sinking after hitting a submerged object off Mozambique. Captain J. A. Fergurson and his senior officers later received commemorative gifts from the Holland Afrika Line.

When the expected flow of European emigrants to South Africa did not materialize, &quot;Bloemfontein Castle&quot; was sold to the Greek Chandris Lines in 1959, after a short life of only nine years with Union-Castle.

Renamed &quot;Patris&quot; and refitted in just three weeks for Chandris&#x27; service between Europe and Australia, the ship was the first large liner in the Chandris fleet. After Darwin was almost destroyed by Cyclone Tracy on Christmas Day in 1974, the Patris anchored in Darwin Harbour for nine months to provide emergency accommodation for those left homeless. 
In December 1975 Patris was refitted as car ferry for the Adriatic service. She was operated under the Chandris brand from 1976 until 1979, connecting Venice and Ancona to Patras.
In 1979 Chandris sold &quot;Patris&quot; to Karageorgis Lines, who first renamed her &quot;Mediterranean Island&quot; then &quot;Mediterranean Star&quot; in 1981. She was used as a ferry until sold to Pakistani breakers in 1987.

<text>The Great Western Turnpike was a series of east–west toll roads that crossed part of New York in the United States. The toll roads that carried this name were:
*The First Great Western Turnpike, extending from Albany to Cherry Valley over a path similar to today&#x27;s U.S. Route 20 (US 20)
*The Second Great Western Turnpike, extending from Cherry Valley to Sherburne via Cooperstown over a path similar to today&#x27;s New York State Route 80 (NY 80)
*The Third Great Western Turnpike (Cherry Valley Turnpike), extending from Cherry Valley to Cazenovia over a path similar to today&#x27;s US 20
*The Fourth Great Western Turnpike, extending the Second Great Western initially from Sherburne to Fabius, and then later extended to Homer, over a path similar to New York State Routes 80 and 13 (NY 80/NY 13)
*The Fifth Great Western Turnpike, extending the Fourth Great Western from Homer to Lake Cayuga near King Ferry over a path similar to today&#x27;s New York State Route 90 (NY 90)

The First and Third Turnpikes were rebuilt as part of US 20 in the 1920s, bypassing the older NY 5, which passed through several cities.

He also finished in the top five in the best-and-fairest on four other occasions. Thompson played in the 1984 and 1985 premiership sides and captained the 1993 premiership team. In 2002, Thompson&#x27;s contribution to the club was recognised when he was voted the 20th best Essendon player of all time in the &quot;Champions of Essendon&quot; list.

==Coaching career==
===Essendon Football Club (1996–1998)===
Thompson was restricted by age and injury to just eight appearances for Essendon during the 1996 AFL season, his last match was the night the lights went out at Waverley Park in round 10. He would take over as coach of the club&#x27;s reserves team during the season, guiding the club to grand final defeat against .

After Thompson retired as a player, Thompson became an assistant coach at Essendon Football Club under senior coach Kevin Sheedy for the 1997 season and 1998 season.

===North Melbourne Football Club (1999)===
In 1999, Thompson joined the North Melbourne Football Club as an assistant coach under senior coach Denis Pagan in what became a premiership year for the Kangaroos in the 1999 season, when North Melbourne defeated Carlton in the 1999 Grand Final to win the premiership.

===Geelong Football Club (2000–2010)===
Thompson was appointed as Geelong Football Club senior coach at the end of the 1999 season, for the 2000 season when he replaced Gary Ayres, who quit as Geelong Football Club senior coach. Thompson as Geelong Football Club senior coach was given an extended time to rebuild the club&#x27;s playing list. Geelong under Thompson finished 5th in the 2000 season in his first season as senior coach but was eliminated by 8th placed Hawthorn in the first week of the finals in the first finals match ever held at the Docklands Stadium. The club under Thompson performed poorly for the next three seasons from 2001 until 2003, missing the top 8 and not making the finals. Thompson&#x27;s position looked in danger, but in the 2004 season, Geelong under Thompson was a big improver, finishing fourth and making the Preliminary Finals, losing to eventual runners-up Brisbane Lions. Due to his success in reinvigorating the club, Thompson&#x27;s contract was extended until 2007. The following year in the 2005 season, the club under Thompson finished sixth and was beaten in the Semi-Finals by 3 points against the eventual premiers Sydney Swans after leading for the majority of the match. 

In the 2006 season, however the club under Thompson eventually missed the finals after winning the NAB Cup and winning their first two matches in convincing style, leading them into flag favouritism. It was also a season where Thompson had used the 2005 semi-final loss to the Swans as motivation. Following a Round 22 61-point demolition at the hands of lower-placed Hawthorn, Thompson&#x27;s job was under immense pressure.

After a very public review of the club, it was decided that Thompson should keep his job as senior coach. After a shaky start to the 2007 season that led many supporters to believe that nothing had changed from the 2006 season, Thompson led Geelong to a massive 15 match winning streak (the biggest in a single season in club history) and a 106-point win against the Kangaroos in the Qualifying Final which is the 5th biggest finals winning margin in AFL/VFL history.

The 2007 season then culminated in one of the biggest, if not the best highlight of Thompson&#x27;s career, in both a coaching and footballer&#x27;s role. Thompson coached Geelong to win the AFL premiership in the 2007 AFL Grand Final by more than 100 points, which was the highest winning margin in Grand Final history, against Port Adelaide Football Club at the MCG on 29 September. It was the club&#x27;s first premiership since 1963, the year of Thompson&#x27;s birth. 

After the Essendon Football Club decided not to give Thompson&#x27;s former mentor, Kevin Sheedy, a renewal of contract, there was speculation that Mark Thompson would take up the senior coaching role at Essendon for the 2008 season. However, with trade week quickly approaching, the club instead appointed Matthew Knights to the position.

After Geelong&#x27;s record-breaking win in the grand final, Geelong under Thompson were red hot favourite to repeat their 2007 success in the 2008 season and their form during the year did nothing to change that. The Cats went 21–1 to claim the McClelland Trophy four games ahead of their nearest challenger, Hawthorn. After relatively easy wins against St Kilda and the Western Bulldogs in the finals, Geelong under Thompson were into their second straight grand final, this time against Hawthorn, and were again hot favourites. In an upset, though, Hawthorn beat Geelong under Thompson by 26 points in front of 100,012 fans in the 2008 AFL Grand Final. 

During an end-of-season holiday to New York that year, Thompson ran into Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy whilst inside a hotel. They were said to have drowned their sorrows following their respective Grand Final losses (Bellamy&#x27;s Melbourne Storm lost the 2008 NRL Grand Final to Manly).

In the 2009 season, following a heartbreaking loss to Hawthorn in the 2008 Grand Final Premiership decider, Geelong under Thompson compiled an 18–4 record during the minor round and disposed of the Western Bulldogs and then Collingwood during the finals series. On 26 September 2009 in the 2009 AFL Grand Final, Geelong under Thompson faced a St Kilda side determined to break its 43-year Premiership drought. In front of 99,251 fans on a rain-soaked MCG deck, the Cats under Thompson clawed their way back after trailing at every break to win the AFL premiership by 12 points. This would be Geelong&#x27;s second flag under Thompson in three years cementing their place as one of the great teams of the modern era. Thompson as always was magnanimous in victory and accepted the AFL Premiership trophy alongside Geelong legend Bob Davis. 

After Geelong under Thompson were eliminated from the preliminary finals to Collingwood, at the conclusion of the 2010 season, on 4 October 2010, Thompson announced his retirement and resignation as Geelong Football Club senior coach effective immediately, his reason being that he was &quot;tired of coaching&quot; after a decade at the helm. Thompson was replaced by Chris Scott as Geelong Football club senior coach.

===Return to Essendon Football Club (2010–2014)===
On 10 November 2010, Thompson signed a lucrative contract to return to Essendon as the senior assistant coach under senior coach James Hird, putting an end to weeks of speculation following his resignation from Geelong. According to football writer and commentator Caroline Wilson&#x27;s sources, his contract was said to be worth $650,000 per year. He was appointed the senior coach for the 2014 season while James Hird served his suspension, and left the club after Hird returned as senior coach at the end of that year.

==2013 supplements controversy==
Following months of rumours and investigations, on 13 August 2013, Thompson, along with the Essendon Football Club, senior coach James Hird, football manager Danny Corcoran and club doctor Bruce Reid, were charged by the AFL with bringing the game into disrepute in relation to the supplements program at the club in 2011 and 2012. The club was given 14 days to consider the charges and faced an AFL Commission hearing on 26 August 2013. On 27 August 2013, Thompson was fined $30,000 for his role in the supplements saga.

==Legal Issues==
On 2 May 2018, he was charged with seven counts of drug trafficking and possession. He was released on $20,000 bail to appear in court at a later date. He was later cleared of trafficking but convicted of possession.

<text>The Thomson-CSF ATLIS II (Automatic Tracking and Laser Integration System) is a French laser/electro-optical targeting pod for fighter bomber and attack aircraft.

ATLIS was developed starting in 1976, entering service in 1980. It was developed for the French Armée de l&#x27;Air, initially carried by SEPECAT Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft.

ATLIS incorporates a laser designator boresighted with a television camera. The pilot or weapon systems officer uses the crosshairs to mark a target, which can then be attacked with laser-guided bombs or other guided weapons from the designating aircraft or other, friendly forces. Because it is designed for use by single-seat aircraft, it has a novel automatic lock-on feature, which keeps the laser focused on the target without further operator intervention (using an inertial guidance system, it can generally keep the laser on target even if the beam is temporarily interrupted by clouds).

ATLIS II is used by the SEPECAT Jaguar, Mirage F1, Mirage 2000, Mirage 2000N, and some Pakistani F-16s. It is compatible with various U.S. and French laser-guided bombs, with the French Aerospatiale AS-30L missile, and even with some Russian bombs and guided weapons.

In 1985, Pakistan Air Force selected ATLIS-II for its F-16 aircraft, making it the first non-European operator of this system. ATLIS-II pod is carried on the 5L intake station on the F-16. Over the years precision targeting using ATLIS has been a distinct phenomenon over-viewed regularly in PAF’ s operational exercises. In the recent PAF operations in Global War on Terrorism, ATLIS-II was extensively used for precision targeting.

The pod is limited in being primarily a daylight/clear-weather system. It was briefly replaced by the more capable Thomson-CSF [[PDLCT]] (&quot;Pod de Designation Laser a Camera Thermique&quot; / Laser Designation Pod with Infrared Camera&quot;) and then the Thales Damocles, which has a FLIR.

<doc id="1113406" wikidata="Q6704458" url="?curid=1113406" title="Lunt">
<text>Lunt is a small village in the civil parish of Sefton, in the borough of Sefton in Merseyside, England, close to Sefton Village and to the west of Maghull and is in the L29 postcode.

==History==
The name derives from either the Old Norse word &quot;Lundr&quot; or the Old Swedish word &quot;lunder&quot;, both meaning &quot;grove&quot; or &quot;copse&quot;. This was likely a reference to the remnants of a large ancient forest that existed in the area at the time the settlement was founded. The town was first documented in 1251 in the Chartulary of Cockersand Abbey, where it was referred to as &quot;de Lund&quot;. However, earlier settlement have been discovered through recent archaeological excavations at Lunt Meadows which were commissioned and funded by the Environment Agency, supported by National Museums Liverpool ahead of the transformation of farmland in the Alt valley, Sefton into a wetland reserve and flood alleviation scheme. These excavations found settlement buildings dating back to the mesolithic period (5800 BC) when the inhabitants were still living as hunter-gatherers

==Governance==
From 1997 until 2010 the village of Lunt was part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency represented by George Howarth, a Labour Party MP. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency was abolished with Sefton East, including Lunt, being merged with the northern parts of the former Crosby constituency, which was also abolished, to form the new Sefton Central constituency which is represented by the Labour Party MP Bill Esterson.

For elections to Sefton Council the village of Lunt is within the Park electoral ward and is represented by three councillors. 

Lunt was formerly a township in the parish of Sefton, in 1866 Lunt became a civil parish, on 1 April 1932 the parish was abolished and merged with Sefton. In 1931 the parish had a population of 87.

<text>Jerry Thomas Storie (born March 23, 1950) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1995, and a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Howard Pawley from 1982 to 1988.

He was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the son of Clifford Earl Storie and Iris Eloise Young, and was educated at Brandon University and the University of Manitoba. In 1970, Storie married Betty Louise Embury. (She died in March 2007.) They moved to Flin Flon in 1975 and he worked as a teacher and sociologist for the Flin Flon School Division before entering public life.

Storie was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1981 general election, defeating Progressive Conservative Bob McNeil by over 1400 votes in the northern riding of Flin Flon. He entered the cabinet on August 20, 1982, having been appointed Minister of Housing, with responsibility for the Landlord and Tenant Act, the Residential Rent Corporation Act, the Housing and Renewal Corporation Act and the Infirm Persons&#x27; Housing Act.

Following a cabinet shuffle on November 4, 1983, Storie was named Minister of Northern Affairs with responsibility for the Communities Economic Development Fund Act, the Manitoba Natural Resources Act, and Manitoba Forestry Resources Ltd. He was relieved of the Northern Affairs portfolio and the first two responsibilities on January 30, 1985, and named Minister of Business Development and Tourism, with responsibility for Manitoba Data Services (he also retained the Forestry responsibility).

Storie was re-elected by a substantial majority in the 1986 provincial election. On April 17, 1986, he was promoted to Minister of Education, and on September 21, 1987 was again shifted to the Ministry of Energy and Mines, with responsibility for Manitoba Hydro and the Natural Resources Development Act. On November 23, 1987, he was also given responsibility for the Natural Gas Supply Act. Throughout his second term in office, he retained responsibility for Forestry.

The NDP government of Howard Pawley was defeated in 1988, when disgruntled backbencher Jim Walding voted against his government&#x27;s budget. The party was reduced to only twelve seats (out of fifty-seven) in the election which followed, although Storie was re-elected in his riding without any serious difficulties. He was again re-elected in the 1990 provincial election, in which the NDP recovered to twenty seats. He retired from the legislature on July 20, 1994. He returned to the field of education as Area 4 Superintendent for the Frontier School Division in Cranberry Portage, Manitoba throughout the late 1990s.

In 2001, Storie negotiated on behalf of Manitoba&#x27;s provincial government in a dispute with the Canadian federal government over hydro resources. He later became Superintendent of the Turtle Mountain school division in Manitoba. Storie was appointed the Dean of Education at Brandon University in 2005.

<doc id="1113417" wikidata="Q726179" url="?curid=1113417" title="David Vetter">
<text>David Phillip Vetter (September 21, 1971 – February 22, 1984) was an American boy with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a hereditary disease that dramatically weakens the immune system. Individuals born with SCID are abnormally susceptible to infections, and exposure to typically innocuous pathogens can be fatal. Vetter was referred to as &quot;David, the bubble boy&quot; by the media, as a reference to the complex containment system used as part of the management of his SCID. Vetter&#x27;s surname was not revealed to the general public until 10 years after his death in order to preserve his family&#x27;s privacy.

In his first years of life, he lived mostly at Texas Children&#x27;s Hospital in Houston, Texas. As he grew older, he lived increasingly at home with his parents and older sister Katherine in Dobbin, Texas. He died in 1984 at the age of 12.

==Family and birth==

Vetter&#x27;s parents were Carol Ann and David Joseph Vetter Jr. Their first son, David Joseph III, was also born with SCID and died at seven months old. Physicians advised the Vetters that any future male children they might conceive would have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. At the time, the only management available for children born with SCID was isolation in a sterile environment until a successful bone-marrow transplant could be performed. The Vetters, who had a daughter, decided to proceed with another pregnancy. Their third child, David Phillip Vetter, was born on September 21, 1971.

A special sterilized cocoon bed was prepared for Vetter at his birth. Immediately after being removed from his mother&#x27;s uterus, Vetter entered the plastic germ-free environment that would be his home for most of his life. Vetter was baptized a Roman Catholic with sterilized holy water once he had entered the bubble. Initial plans to proceed with a bone-marrow transplant came to a halt after it was determined that the prospective donor, Vetter&#x27;s sister Katherine, was not a match.

==Life in the bubble==
Water, air, food, diapers, and clothes were sterilized before they could enter the sterile chamber. Items were placed in a chamber filled with ethylene oxide gas for four hours at 60 degrees Celsius (140 °F), then aerated for a period of one to seven days before being placed in the sterile chamber.

After he was placed in the sterile chamber, Vetter was touched only through special plastic gloves attached to the walls of the chamber, which was kept inflated by air compressors that were so loud that communication with David was difficult. His parents and medical team, which included Dr. John Montgomery, sought to provide him as normal a life as possible, including a formal education and a television and playroom inside the sterile chamber. About three years after Vetter&#x27;s birth, the treatment team built an additional sterile chamber in his parents&#x27; home in Conroe, Texas, and a transport chamber, so Vetter could spend periods of two to three weeks at home, with his sister and friends for company. A friend arranged for a special showing of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; at a local theater so that Vetter could attend the movie in his transport chamber.

When Vetter was four years old, he discovered that he could poke holes in his bubble using a butterfly needle that was left inside the chamber by mistake. At this point, the treatment team explained to him what germs were and how they affected his condition. As he grew older, he became aware of the world outside his chamber and expressed an interest in participating in what he could see outside the windows of the hospital and via television.

In 1977, researchers from NASA used their experience with the fabrication of space suits to develop a special suit that would allow Vetter to get out of his bubble and walk in the outside world. The suit was connected to his bubble via an eight-foot (2.5 m) long cloth tube and although cumbersome, it allowed him to venture outside without serious risk of contamination. Vetter was initially resistant to the suit, and although he later became more comfortable wearing it, he used it only six times. He outgrew the suit and never used the replacement one provided for him by NASA.

==Death==
Approximately $1.3 million was spent on Vetter&#x27;s care, but scientific study failed to produce a true cure and no donor match was identified. Vetter later received a bone marrow transplant from his sister Katherine. While his body did not reject the transplant, he became ill with infectious mononucleosis after a few months. He died on February 22, 1984, from Burkitt lymphoma at age 12. The autopsy revealed that Katherine&#x27;s bone marrow contained traces of a dormant virus, Epstein–Barr, which was undetectable in the pre-transplant screening.

He was buried at Conroe Memorial Park, Conroe, Montgomery County, Texas, on February 25, 1984, next to his older brother, David Joseph Vetter III.

==Legacy==
A Conroe ISD elementary school which opened in 1990 in The Woodlands, Montgomery County, Texas, was named David Elementary after Vetter.

The case has resulted in several parodies in film and television. &quot;The Boy in the Plastic Bubble&quot; is a 1976 TV movie drama inspired by Vetter, starring John Travolta. The 1986 Paul Simon song &quot;The Boy in the Bubble&quot; was inspired by Vetter&#x27;s story. In 1992, American sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; parodied the case in their episode &quot;The Bubble Boy&quot;. The 2001 film &quot;Bubble Boy&quot;, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, was inspired by Vetter and the previously mentioned 1976 film; it received criticism for its comedic approach of the disease.

==Aftermath==
Vetter&#x27;s parents later divorced. His father became the mayor of Shenandoah, Texas. His mother married Kent Demaret, a magazine reporter who had written about her son. Vetter&#x27;s psychologist, Mary Murphy, wrote a book about Vetter&#x27;s case that was to be published in 1995; however, its initial publication was blocked by his parents and Baylor College of Medicine. The book was published in 2019 under the title &quot;Bursting the Bubble: The Tortured Life and Untimely Death of David Vetter&quot;.

<doc id="1113420" wikidata="Q3544153" url="?curid=1113420" title="USS Roncador">
<text>USS &quot;Roncador&quot; (SS/AGSS/IXSS-301), a , was a ship of the United States Navy named for the roncador.

==Construction and commissioning==
The &quot;Roncador&quot; was laid down on 21 April 1943 by the Cramp Shipbuilding Company at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, launched on 14 May 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Thomas B. Klakring, and commissioned on 27 March 1945.

==Service history==
Following commissioning, the &quot;Roncador&quot; conducted shakedown exercises into late May 1945; on 26 May 1945, she arrived at Port Everglades, Florida. Based there for two months, she assisted in the development of antisubmarine warfare techniques. On 29 July 1945 she got underway for Panama and, from 3 August through the end of World War II in mid-August 1945, conducted advanced training exercises off the Panama Canal Zone.

In late August 1945, she proceeded to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, then in mid-September 1945 headed for the Pacific She arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 3 October 1945 and remained in Hawaiian waters into 1946. On 3 January 1946, she got underway for San Francisco, California, and inactivation.
==Decommissioning and disposal==
The &quot;Roncador&quot; was decommissionedon 1 June 1946 and through the 1950s remained in the inactive fleet. In February 1960, she was taken out of reserve fleet and assigned to United States Naval Reserve training duty in the 11th Naval District in a non-commissioned status. Reclassified as an auxiliary submarine and accordingly redesignated AGSS-301 on 1 December 1962, she continued training duty, at Naval Station Long Beach on Terminal Island in Los Angeles, California, until 1 December 1971, at which time she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, reclassified as a &quot;miscellaneous unclassified submarine,&quot; and redesignated IXSS-301.

Plans were made for &quot;Roncadaor&quot; to be used as a museum ship at Ports O&#x27; Call Village in San Pedro, California, but they fell through. Instead she was sold for scrapping on 2 January 1973. Instead of being scrapped, however, she was placed on display for a brief period of time circa February 1976 at King Harbor in Redondo Beach, California.

She was resold in September 1976 to Nicolai Joffe of Beverly Hills, California, and subsequently portrayed the fictional submarine USS &quot;Sea Tiger&quot; — painted pink for the role — in the ABC situation comedy &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;, which aired in the United States from September 1977 to October 1978. The Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1982 listed her as having been sold again for scrapping.

==Commemoration==
The &quot;Roncador&quot;′s conning tower was preserved and was displayed for several years at the National Museum of the United States Navy at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. It then was moved to Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego, California, where it now resides as the centerpiece of the Submarine Memorial at Ballast Point.

<text>The RT 125 was a German two-stroke motorcycle made by DKW in Zschopau in the 1930s, IFA and MZ in the 1950s and early 1960s, and DKW in Ingolstadt in the 1950s and 1960s. &quot;RT&quot; stands for , .

In the 1930s DKW pioneered the Schnürle two-stroke loop scavenging process to dispense with the use of a deflector piston and improve efficiency of the combustion chamber. DKW also developed a highly efficient arrangement of transfer ports. These two features were included in the RT 125 to great commercial advantage. Competitor companies such as Adler and TWN copied the adoption of flat-topped pistons and strove to develop equally efficient transfer port arrangements without infringing DKW&#x27;s patent.

==Copies and variants==
Copies of the RT 125 were built by at least eight different entities in at least six countries.

===War reparations===

After World War II the Soviet Union took plans, tooling and even several dozen personnel as war reparations to MMZ in Moscow (later transferred to MMVZ and SMZ) and to a factory in Kovrov, and produced copies of the RT 125 as the M1A Moskva and K-125 respectively. WFM of Poland made a modified version of the RT 125 (under SHL 125 and Sokół 125 brands), developed into 125/175 cc family motorcycles, produced until 1985.

RT 125 plans were also taken to the United Kingdom where they became the basis of the BSA Bantam, and to the USA where they formed the basis of the Harley-Davidson &quot;Hummer&quot; (Hummer is really just a few specific years, but generally people call the Harley lightweights Hummers).

===Postwar German production: DKW and MZ===
After the Second World War, DKW&#x27;s factories in Zschopau were in the Soviet occupation zone. As such, they were under the control of the Soviet Union until they were handed over to the government of East Germany. The factory continued production of the RT 125 under the MZ (&quot;Motorradwerk Zschopau&quot;) brand into the 1950s.

Meanwhile, DKW had reorganized itself in Ingolstadt, where it began production of the RT 125W (for &quot;West&quot;) in 1949. Variants of the RT 125W, usually with larger engines, were in production throughout the 1950s.
===Yamaha YA-1===
In the 1950s, after reestablishing themselves as manufacturers of musical instruments, Nippon Gakki decided to use the manufacturing equipment left over from wartime production to make motorcycles. Since the copyright on the RT 125 had been voided by the Allies, the company reverse engineered it as the basis for their first motorcycle. Nippon Gakki formed the Yamaha Motor Company in 1955 to build their copy of the RT 125 as the Yamaha YA-1, which was in production from 1955 to 1958. The YA-1 inherited design characteristics of RT 125 and, due to its thin body and chestnut brown tank, was affectionately nicknamed the .

<text>The Wright R-2600 Cyclone 14 (also called Twin Cyclone) is an American radial engine developed by Curtiss-Wright and widely used in aircraft in the 1930s and 1940s.

==History==
In 1935, Curtiss-Wright began work on a more powerful version of their successful R-1820 Cyclone 9. The result was the R-2600 Twin Cyclone, with 14 cylinders arranged in two rows. The R-2600-3 was originally intended for the C-46 Commando (being fitted to the prototype CW-20A). It was also the original engine choice for the F6F Hellcat; a running change (one which would not stop production) for the CW-20A, and one in late April 1942 for the second XF6F-1, led to the adoption of the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp in the R-2600&#x27;s place for both designs.

The Twin Cyclone went on to power several important American World War II aircraft, including the A-20 Havoc, B-25 Mitchell, TBF Avenger, SB2C Helldiver, and the PBM Mariner.

Over 50,000 R-2600s were built at plants in Paterson, New Jersey, and Cincinnati, Ohio.

==Variants==
* R-2600-1 - 1,600 hp (1,194 kW)
* R-2600-2 - 1,500 hp (1,118 kW)- Prototype variant; Few were made.
* R-2600-3 - 1,600 hp (1,194 kW)
* R-2600-4 - 1,650 hp (1,230 kW)
* R-2600-6 - 1,600 hp (1,194 kW)
* R-2600-8 - 1,700 hp (1,268 kW)
* R-2600-9 - 1,700 hp (1,268 kW)
* R-2600-10 - 1,700 hp (1,268 kW)- Experimental high-altitude R-2600 variant with a two-stage mechanical supercharger, vs the usual single-stage supercharger. The 2600-10 also served as a testbed for turbo-supercharging the 2600 series. Very few were produced.
* R-2600-11 - 1,600 hp (1,194 kW)
* R-2600-12 - 1,700 hp (1,268 kW)
* R-2600-13 - 1,700 hp (1,268 kW)
* R-2600-14 - 1,700 hp (1,268 kW)- One of the engines which powered Grumman&#x27;s prototype F6Fs, the XF6F-1 (the two-stage supercharged R-2600-10 was also tested in the XF6F-1). Grumman was not happy with the performance, which led to the 2,000 hp Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 engine replacing the R-2600 on F6F production models.
* R-2600-15 - 1,800 hp (1,342 kW)- Planned to power the XB-33A, a prototype model of the B-33 Super Marauder (itself a high-altitude version of the B-26 Marauder). The project was cancelled, and neither the prototype XB-33A or production B-33A were ever built.
* R-2600-16 - 1,700 hp (1,268 kW)- Similar to the R-2600-10 &amp; -14, the -16 powered a Grumman prototype F6F, the XF6F-2.
* R-2600-19 - 1,600 hp (1,194 kW), 1,660 hp (1,237 kW)
* R-2600-20 - 1,700 hp (1,268 kW), 1,900 hp (1,420 kW)
* R-2600-22 - 1,900 hp (1,420 kW)
* R-2600-23 - 1,600 hp (1,194 kW)
* R-2600-29 - 1,700 hp (1,268 kW), 1,850 hp (1,380 kW)
* GR-2600-A5B - 1,500 hp (1,118 kW), 1,600 hp (1,194 kW), 1,700 hp (1,268 kW)
* GR-2600-A71 - 1,300 hp (969 kW)
* GR-2600-C14 - 1,750 hp (1,304 kW)

==Applications==


* Boeing 314 Clipper
* Brewster SB2A Buccaneer
* Curtiss SB2C Helldiver
* Douglas A-20 Havoc
* Douglas B-23 Dragon
* Grumman F6F Hellcat (XF6F-1 &amp; -2 prototypes only, pre-April 1942)

<doc id="1113426" wikidata="Q9005258" url="?curid=1113426" title="Hugh Brannum">
<text>Hugh Brannum (January 5, 1910 – April 19, 1987) was an American vocalist, arranger, composer, and actor known for his role as Mr. Green Jeans on the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;. During his days with Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians, Brannum used his childhood nickname &quot;Lumpy&quot;.

==Early years==

Brannum was born in Sandwich, Illinois, in 1910 to a Methodist minister. He attended Maine Township High School in suburban Chicago, where he played sousaphone in the school&#x27;s marching band, later learning the bass violin.

Brannum went to college at University of Redlands, where he became interested in jazz; after graduation in 1931, he played bass in various bands.

==Career==
During World War II, Brannum enlisted in the US Marine Corps and joined a Marine band led by Bob Crosby. After the war, he joined the Four Squires, and later moved to Fred Waring and His Pennsylvanians; Waring&#x27;s group had a regular radio show on NBC, where Brannum met fellow Marine Bob Keeshan, who was working at the network, and who later hired Brannum for &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;.

Before his time on &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, Brannum hosted a local children&#x27;s TV series called &quot;Uncle Lumpy&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, seen weekday afternoons at 5 on WJZ-TV, (now WABC-TV) in New York City during the 1951 season.

Mr. Green Jeans earned his moniker from his distinctive apparel, a pair of farmer&#x27;s overalls (later, jeans and a denim jacket) in his signature green (although, since the show was broadcast in black-and-white until 1967, this was lost on viewers during its first years). He was a talented and inquisitive handyman who provided assistance at the Treasure House. He frequently visited the Captain with the latest addition to his menagerie of zoo animals.

Aside from Mr. Green Jeans, Brannum played a number of characters on &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; from 1955 to 1984, including the Professor, Greeno the Clown, the New Old Folk Singer, and Mr. Bainter the Painter. His role as Mr. Green Jeans was partly based on stories about a farm kid named &quot;Little Orley&quot; that he told with the Fred Waring orchestra, on the radio and on 78-rpm records under the pseudonym &quot;Uncle Lumpy&quot;. According to Bob Keeshan, Mr. Green Jeans was an extension of Brannum&#x27;s real personality. During one episode of &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, a lion cub bit Brannum&#x27;s finger and drew blood. Brannum stuck his bleeding hand into his pocket and never broke character for the remainder of the episode.

==Death==
Brannum died of cancer in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1987.

==In popular culture==
*A long-running but incorrect rumor claims Brannum was the father of musician Frank Zappa, apparently because of a Zappa composition titled &quot;Son of Mr. Green Genes&quot; on his 1969 album, &quot;Hot Rats.&quot;
*Along with Bob Keeshan, he is mentioned in the Jim Lehrer novel &quot;The Phony Marine&quot;.

<text>Little Altcar is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton on Merseyside, within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire and on the West Lancashire Coastal Plain of England. The village forms part of the built-up area of Formby. It had a population of 892 in the 2001 Census, increasing to 910 at the 2011 Census.

==Etymology==
The name Altcar is Norse meaning &#x27;marsh by the River Alt&#x27;.

==Governance==
===Local Government===
Little Altcar has two tiers of local government, at parish and metropolitan borough level: Little Altcar Parish Council, and Sefton Council. Sefton is also a constituent part of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

The civil parish now called Little Altcar was created in 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, which split the former parish of Altcar between Lancashire and the new metropolitan county of Merseyside. The parts in each county became new parishes, with the parish in Lancashire taking the name Great Altcar. The parish in Merseyside was initially called simply &quot;Altcar&quot;, changing to &quot;Altcar-in-Merseyside&quot; in 1977, before changing again to &quot;Little Altcar&quot; on 19 November 1987.

Little Altcar has seven parish councillors. For elections to Sefton Council the village is part of Ravenmeols ward which has three councillors.

===Parliamentary representation===
From 1950 until 2010 Little Altcar was within the boundaries of the Crosby constituency, whose MP from 1997 until 2010 was Claire Curtis-Thomas, a member of the Labour Party, prior to her election the Crosby seat was generally considered to be a safe Conservative Party stronghold with Tory MP&#x27;s elected at every election barring the 1981 Crosby by-election where Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected to represent the constituency. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Crosby constituency was abolished with its northern parts, including Little Altcar, being merged with the Eastern parts of Sefton that were formerly part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency, to form the new constituency of Sefton Central, which is currently represented by the Labour Party MP Bill Esterson.

<doc id="1113439" wikidata="Q350954" url="?curid=1113439" title="Ralph Modjeski">
<text>Ralph Modjeski (born Rudolf Modrzejewski; ; January 27, 1861 – June 26, 1940) was a Polish-American civil engineer who achieved prominence as &quot;America&#x27;s greatest bridge builder.&quot;

He furthered the use of suspension bridges and oversaw the design and construction of nearly forty bridges that spanned the great rivers of North America, as well as the development of new rail lines. In addition, he trained succeeding generations of American bridge designers and builders, including Joseph B. Strauss, chief engineer of San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Bridge (which was completed six months after Modjeski&#x27;s San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge).

==Formative years and family==
Modjeski was born in Bochnia, in Galicia, on January 27, 1861, to Gustav Sinnmayer Modrzejewski and actress Helena Opid Modrzejewska (best known outside Poland as Helena Modjeska). In 1865, his mother left Sinnmayer, and in 1868, she married polish nobleman Karol Bożenta Chłapowski. In July 1876, they emigrated to America, where, as a matter of convenience, the boy&#x27;s mother changed her name to Helena Modjeska and her son&#x27;s name to Ralph Modjeski.

He was a classmate of Ignacy Jan Paderewski in Poland and was a formidable pianist in his own right.

The son returned to Europe to study at &quot;l&#x27;Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées&quot; (the School of Bridges and Roads) in Paris, France. It was in 1883, while studying at Paris, that he obtained American citizenship; however, he always maintained contact with Poland, wrote much in Polish, and emphasized his Polish origins.

In 1885, he graduated from the School of Bridges and Roads at the top of his class. That same year, he married a cousin Felicie Benda; the couple had three children. They divorced in 1931 after a sixteen-year-long separation. That same year, the now seventy-year-old Modjeski married Virginia Mary Giblyn. 
==Career==
After completing his academic training, Modjeski returned to America to begin his career, working first under the &quot;father of American bridge-building,&quot; George S. Morison. In 1893, Modjeski opened his own design office in Chicago. Joined in 1924 by Frank M. Masters Sr., the firm still exists as Modjeski &amp; Masters.

Modjeski&#x27;s first project as chief engineer was the railroad bridge across the Mississippi River at Rock Island, Illinois. During his career, he served as chief or consulting engineer on dozens of bridges across the United States.

He took over the mis-designed Quebec Bridge after the 1907 disaster that killed seventy-five workers, and succeeded in creating the longest truss span in the world (though a construction accident killed another thirteen workers). It is still the longest cantilever bridge in the world.

Modjeski was the recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees. He received a doctorate in engineering from Illinois State University in 1911, the Franklin Medal in 1923, a doctorate &quot;honoris causa&quot; from the Lwów Polytechnic in 1929, and the prestigious John Fritz Medal in 1930. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1925 and the American Philosophical Society in 1926. In Modjeski&#x27;s obituary, Frank Masters considered him &quot;one of the world&#x27;s leading bridge engineers.&quot; A PHMC Historical Marker was dedicated in 2007 in commemoration.

==Death==
He died on June 26, 1940, in Los Angeles, California, nearly 80 years old. He was buried at the Ingelwood Eternity Mausoleum Cemetery in the crypt K-208.

<doc id="1113442" wikidata="Q4704622" url="?curid=1113442" title="Al Qa'qaa high explosives controversy">
<text>The Al Qa&#x27;qaa high explosives controversy concerns the possible removal of about 377 tonnes of high explosives (HMX and RDX) from the Al Qa&#x27;qaa facility by the Iraqi insurgency, after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Although Pentagon spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has not come forward with documentation that explains how it arrived at the figure of 377 tons of missing explosives. The IAEA so far only has verified in its paperwork that 219 tons of explosive materials were at Al Qaqaa and surrounding facilities.

The explosives, considered dangerous by the IAEA, were certified by UN weapons inspectors to be inside facilities whose doors were fastened with chains and the United Nations&#x27; seal, at the Al Qa&#x27;qaa industrial complex in Iraq in 2003. By October 2004, the facility was empty.

==Background==
In October 2004, the Iraqi interim government warned the U.S. that nearly 380 tons of conventional explosives had been removed from the Al Qa&#x27;qaa facility. The Bush administration was criticized for failing to guard known weapons stashes of this size after the invasion. Critics of the Bush administration claimed that U.S. forces were to blame for the looting, which put weapons that were formerly under UN control into the hands of insurgents.

The Bush administration asserted before the 2004 U.S. election that the explosives were either removed by Iraq before invaders captured the facility, or properly accounted for by US forces, even while White House and Pentagon officials acknowledged that they had vanished after the invasion.

MSNBC wrote:
&quot;Time&quot; magazine reported the sequence of events: &quot;In late April IAEA&#x27;s chief weapons inspector for Iraq warned the U.S. of the vulnerability of the site, and in May 2003, an internal IAEA memo warned that terrorists could be looting &quot;the greatest explosives bonanza in history.&quot; Seventeen months later, on October 10, in response to a long-standing request from the IAEA to account for sensitive materials, the interim Iraqi government notified the agency that AlQaqaa had been stripped clean. The White House learned about the notification a few days later.&quot;

Evidence indicated that the explosives were most likely removed after invading US forces captured the facility. The looting was witnessed by U.S. Army reservists and National Guardsman from separate units as well as officials of the new Iraqi government. Frank Rich editorialized in &quot;The New York Times&quot; (May 15, 2005):
&quot;For a timeline of events resulting in the storage and subsequent loss of the high explosives, please see Al Qa&#x27;qaa high explosives timeline.&quot;

==Other facilities looted==
Sami al-Araji, Iraq&#x27;s deputy minister of industry, noted that besides al Qa&#x27;qaa, looters had targeted explosives and other weapons material in the Nida Factory, the Badr General Establishment, Al Ameer, Al Radwan, Al Hatteen, and Al Qadisiya. Some of these factories had WMD (weapon of mass destruction) significance, such as the Nida Factory and Al Radwan, which were part of Saddam&#x27;s nuclear program in the early 1990s. The looting of five of these sites were also confirmed by the IAEA&#x27;s satellite reconnaissance.

Former U.S. Ambassador Peter W. Galbraith (who supported Bush&#x27;s war in Iraq) reported two additional incidents of significant looting in post-invasion Iraq. He witnessed U.S. troops standing outside Baghdad&#x27;s Disease Center as looters attacked the complex on 16 April 2003, &quot;taking live HIV and black fever virus among other potentially lethal materials.&quot; At the same time, looters attacked Iraq&#x27;s nuclear facilities at Tuwaitha, taking &quot;barrels of yellowcake (raw uranium), apparently dumping the uranium and using the barrels to hold water. US troops were at Tuwaitha but did not interfere.&quot; Galbraith noted that the facilities were all under IAEA seal and that &quot;they remained untouched until the US troops arrived.&quot;

Former counterterrorism directors for the National Security Council Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon noted the danger of these nuclear materials falling into the hands of terrorists as a result of the U.S. invasion: &quot;Another potential consequence of the invasion is the spread of weapons of mass destruction to al-Qaeda or other terrorists ... [T]he International Atomic Energy Agency certified that there were highly radioactive materials at the al-Tuwaitha facilities, including partially enriched—though not weapons-grade—uranium. These materials could be used to fabricate one or more radiological dispersion devices—or &#x27;dirty bombs,&#x27; as they have come to be known. Some of these materials appear to be missing—how much remains unclear—and it seems a fair conjecture that someone ... may have &#x27;privatized&#x27; these weapons with the intent of selling them to the highest biddeer. Ultimately, this material could find its way into the hands of al-Qaeda. It is difficult to imagine a more horrifyingly ironic outcome to the war.&quot;

==Impact of the looting==
Many commentators expressed fears that the explosives had fallen into the hands of terrorists and would be used by the Iraqi insurgency to mount attacks against US and Iraqi troops. Many insurgent attacks have been carried out using improvised explosive devices made from military munitions, most often 122 mm artillery shells and landmines. IEDs made with high explosives are far more powerful and devastating and have been used in some of the most damaging attacks carried out in Iraq, such as the August 19, 2003 suicide attack on the U.N. headquarters, and the March 17, 2004 attack on the Mount Lebanon Hotel, both in Baghdad. It is not clear whether these attacks were mounted using explosives from Al Qa&#x27;qaa. However, on October 28, 2004 a video was released by a group calling itself &quot;Islam&#x27;s Army Brigades, Al-Karar Brigade&quot; in which a masked man claimed that &quot;the American intelligence&quot; had helped them to obtain a &quot;huge amount of the explosives that were in the Al Qa&#x27;qaa facility&quot; and that the explosives would be &quot;use[d] against the occupation forces and those who cooperate with them in the event of these forces threatening any Iraqi city.&quot; And a December 2003 report from a joint Defense Department intelligence task force concluded that the insurgents in Iraq &quot;retain access to virtually all the weapons systems and ordnances previously controlled by the Iraqi military, security and intelligence assets. Unsecured arms depots and storage sites, in addition to open and black market availability of weapons and ammunition, eliminate the need for the [insurgents] to maintain a formidable arsenal.&quot;

Montgomery McFate of the Human Terrain Team program noted in 2005:
==The high explosives==
The high explosives were stored under the supervision of the United Nations due to their sensitive nature and dual use in WMDs.
According to the IAEA, there were 340 tonnes consisting of:
* 194.741 tonnes of HMX,
* 141.233 tonnes of RDX, and
* 5.800 tonnes of PETN. 
These explosives were stored in solid crystalline form and could be used to make powerful plastic explosives, are safe to transport and do not detonate on impact. The total quantity, 341.744 tonnes (753,417 pounds), would require approximately 40 large trucks to convey.

==Chemical weapons equipment==
In addition to the explosives, al Qa&#x27;qaa held some of the remnants of Iraq&#x27;s chemical warfare program from the early 1990s, &quot;including 800 pieces of chemical equipment.&quot; The areas that had been involved in chemical processing were &quot;wrecked by fire and possible extensive looting&quot; after the invasion; as &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;Unknown is the fate of such equipment there like separators, heat exchangers, mixers and chemical reactors, all of which can be used in making chemical weapons.&quot; (13 March 2005). The &quot;Times&quot; reported that &quot;the kinds of machinery at the various sites included equipment that could be used to make missile parts, chemical weapons or centrifuges essential for enriching uranium for atom bombs.&quot; Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, said, &quot;Targeted looting of this kind of equipment has to be seen as a proliferation threat.&quot;

==The storage facilities==
The HMX was stored at the Qa&#x27;qaa Store, one of a number of facilities at the Al Qa&#x27;qaa complex in Iraq. Al Qa&#x27;Qaa is very large, occupying 28 km² of land near to Iskandariya and about 48 km south of Baghdad. It includes almost 1100 individual structures and buildings. This is about the same size as Newport, Rhode Island, Little Cayman or Bath. As a result of its large size, most accounts of the complex deal only with a specific facility located within its bounds.

The Qa&#x27;qaa Store was located at the southern end of the facility in underground bunkers. The bunker doors were sealed by IAEA officials upon being closed. Although the doors were sealed, the bunker itself was not hermetically sealed. Air ventilation shafts leading into the bunkers were not sealed. The high explosives subject to the controversy were the only materials under UN seal at Al Qa&#x27;qaa.

The RDX was stored at the Al Mahaweel Stores, a site physically separate from, but administered by, Al Qa&#x27;qaa.

Satellite imagery of the main Al Qa&#x27;qaa complex (about 28 km ¹) is publicly available for 2001 from GlobalSecurity.org and for 2003 and 2004 from DigitalGlobe.

==Claims of removal prior to US arrival==
* Fox News reported that a U.S. Army officer came forward Friday, October 29, 2004 claiming the 3rd Infantry Division took about 250 tons of munitions and other material, including plastic explosives, from Al Qaqaa 10 days after Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime fell in April 2003. According to ABC News, however, &quot;the Pentagon stopped short of saying that the material that is reputed to be lost, missing, unaccounted for is the material that this exploitation team took away.&quot; (ABC World News Tonight, 31 October 2004).
* An aerial photograph declassified and released by Donald Rumsfeld showing two trucks at the site after IAEA inspectors last visited it before the invasion. However, the trucks in the photographs were not at any of the bunkers that had been identified as containing explosives. It has also been noted that they represent only a small fraction of the total shipping capacity required to move all the explosives.
* US Army Colonel David Perkins, commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division which originally took the facility, and oversaw the area afterwards called the claim the explosives were taken after US troops were in the area &quot;highly improbable&quot;. Perkins said that &quot;the enemy sneaks a convoy of 10-ton trucks in and loads them up in the dark of night and infiltrates them in your convoy and moves out&quot;, he said. &quot;That&#x27;s kind of a stretch too far.&quot;
* According to an NBC news crew embedded with the 101st, large stockpiles of conventional weapons were found on April 10, 2003, but not the 380 tons of HMX or RDX

==Evidence against the claim of removal prior to US arrival==
* A letter from former Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri (who was also a CIA asset at the time) to deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein &quot;suggests taking the HMX from underground bunkers where it had been kept under seal by the International Atomic Energy Agency and giving it to suicide bombers.&quot; The letter was written on 4 April 2003.
* Explosives were reported intact after the invasion—Col. John Peabody of the 3rd Infantry Division told AP that his troops found thousands of boxes of explosives at the facility on 5 April 2003.
* DIA confirmation—the DIA issued a report on 9 November 2003 that concluded that the &quot;[v]ast majority of explosives and ordnance used in anti-Coalition improvised explosive devices/IED s have come from pilfered Iraqi ammunition stockpiles and prewar established ... caches.&quot;
* Pentagon official—the AP reported on 25 October 2004 &quot;At the Pentagon, an official who monitors developments in Iraq said US-led coalition troops had searched Al Qaqaa in the immediate aftermath of the March 2003 invasion and confirmed that the explosives, which had been under IAEA seal since 1991, were intact. Thereafter the site was not secured by U.S. forces, the official said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.&quot;
* videotape made by a KSTP-TV St. Paul, Minnesota, television crew embedded with U.S. 101st Airborne Division troops on April 18, 2003, nine days after Hussein&#x27;s fall. The television crew accompanying US troops recorded the sealed explosives containers at the site, displaying ammunition caches and explosives and clearly displaying the ammunition cache of explosives and other weapons supplies. &quot;The New York Times&quot; summarized in April 2005, &quot;videos taken by television crews with American troops show the bunkers were still full of explosives well after the invasion.&quot;
* Mohammed al-Sharaa, head of the science ministry&#x27;s site monitoring department: &quot;It is impossible that these materials could have been taken from this site before the regime&#x27;s fall. The officials that were inside this facility (Al Qaqaa) beforehand confirm that not even a shred of paper left it before the fall.&quot;
* U.S. surveillance: the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported on 27 October 2004: &quot;Given the size of the missing cache, it would have been difficult to relocate undetected before the invasion, when U.S. spy satellites were monitoring activity.&quot;
* Eyewitness testimony of Army reservists and National Guardsman from separate units as reported to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in November 2004.
* Iraqi Interim Government Investigation: Iraqi official Sami al-Araji reported on the Iraqi government&#x27;s investigation into the theft, indicating that the looters &quot;came in with the cranes and the lorries, and they depleted the whole sites. They knew what they were doing; they knew what they want. This was sophisticated looting.&quot;

==Timeline==
* Alternative article Timeline of Al Qa&#x27;qaa high explosives for more information.

The Al Qa&#x27;qaa complex was occupied for two days by the United States Army&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Division following a brief battle on April 3, 2003, shortly before the fall of Baghdad. Although no banned weapons were discovered, atropine and 2-Pam chloride — both antidotes for nerve gas — were reported found there. Thousands of bottles of white powder were also discovered, but were found to be explosives rather than chemical weapons.

On April 10, 2003, troops from the Second Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division arrived at Al Qa&#x27;qaa &quot;en route&quot; to Baghdad. They stopped overnight and moved on the following day. According to the brigade&#x27;s commander, Colonel Joseph Anderson, at this point the complex showed few signs of looting or damage. Al Qa&#x27;qaa was reportedly unoccupied and unguarded until the arrival of the 75th Exploration Task Force (better known as Task Force 75) on May 27. By this time, according to Wathiq al-Dulaimi, a local security chief, and other local Iraqis, the complex had been thoroughly looted with enterprising locals even renting their trucks to looters. Task Force 75 found that the complex had largely been stripped of anything of value. Although they searched 32 bunkers and 87 other buildings, they found no signs of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. The team did not find any of the explosives sealed by the IAEA inspectors two months earlier.

On April 13, a team from the 3rd Infantry Division led by Maj. Austin Pearson arrived at Al-Qaqaa. Pearson said at a Pentagon news conference that his mission was to secure and destroy ammunition and explosives. He estimated that his team, &quot;Task Force Bullet&quot;, removed 250 tons of material including TNT, plastic explosives, detonation cords and munitions.

Pearson&#x27;s story provoked skepticism as it came the morning after new videotape surfaced indicating that the explosives were still at the base after Saddam&#x27;s fall; the videotape (from April 18, 2003) shows what appeared to be high explosives still in barrels bearing IAEA seals. &quot;The photographs are consistent with what I know of Al Qaqaa&quot;, David A. Kay, who directed the hunt in Iraq for WMD and visited the site, told The New York Times. &quot;The damning thing is the seals. The Iraqis didn&#x27;t use seals on anything. So I&#x27;m absolutely sure that&#x27;s an IAEA seal.&quot;

The situation did not become publicly known for over a year afterwards, but IAEA officials reportedly warned as early as May 2003 that looting at Al Qa&#x27;qaa could be &quot;the greatest explosives bonanza in history.&quot; Although IAEA inspectors were unable to inspect the site themselves due to the US ban on their presence, they were able to obtain commercial satellite imagery in late 2003 that showed severe damage to the facility. Two of roughly ten bunkers in which high explosives had been stored appeared to have been leveled by blasts. Other bunkers were damaged and some were untouched.

On October 10, 2004, Dr. Mohammed J. Abbas of the Iraqi Ministry of Science and Technology wrote to the IAEA to say that the Qa&#x27;qaa stockpile had been lost after April 9, 2003, because of the &quot;theft and looting of the governmental installations due to lack of security.&quot; Nearly 340 tonnes of HDX and RDX explosives, an amount equivalent to 40 ten-ton truckloads, was said to be missing.

The news led to an immediate controversy in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. Presidential challenger John Kerry has accused President George W. Bush of presiding over an inexcusable failure to prevent the loss of the explosives, while President Bush has criticized Senator Kerry for &quot;jump[ing] to conclusions without knowing the facts.&quot;

On October 28, 2004, the DoD released imagery dated March 17, 2003, showing two trucks parked outside one of the 56 bunkers at Al Qa Qaa. However, the bunker nearest where the trucks were parked are not any of the nine bunkers identified by the IAEA as containing the missing explosive stockpiles.

On the same day, the London &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that the French and Russians may have been involved in the removal of the explosives from Al Qa&#x27;qaa before the war began, quoting Deputy Undersecretary for Defense John A. Shaw, who said &quot;various Russian units on the eve of hostilities [helped] to orchestrate the collection of munitions and assure their transport out of Iraq via Syria&quot;. He also told &quot;The Washington Times&quot; &quot;the organized effort was done in advance of the conflict&quot;. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; also reported that defense officials believed the Russians could also explain what happened to Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction programs. The Russian Government has denounced this theory as &quot;nonsense&quot;, saying that there were no Russian military in the country at the time. Shaw&#x27;s theory has attracted little public support from elsewhere in the administration.

On October 29, 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the existence of a videotape made by a KSTP-TV St. Paul, Minnesota television crew embedded with U.S. 101st Airborne Division troops on April 18, 2003, nine days after Hussein&#x27;s fall. The television crew accompanying US troops recorded the sealed explosives containers at the site, displaying the ammunition cache of explosives and other weapons supplies. Commentators have pointed out that the complex would have been under intensive surveillance during the war as a suspected centre of WMD production. They point out that an operation involving removing 40 truckloads of materials should have been extremely visible and would probably have been attacked, had it been spotted. Some said that the materials being moved might just as easily have been WMDs being moved to the battlefront. However, there is no indication that any such transport operation was spotted by US forces. The tape displaying the sealed explosives containers, as they were being found by the 101st Airborne Division troops, was re-broadcast by ABC on October 27, and by MSNBC on October 28, 2004. The explosives, classified as &quot;dual use&quot; materials, had been sealed by the IAEA, and reported 18 months earlier.

The administration subsequently stated that it was a &quot;mystery&quot; when the explosives disappeared and that the President did not want to comment on the matter until the facts were known. The Bush administration asserted that an investigation had begun into how, where, and when the explosives went missing; no such investigation has been reported on since the 2004 election.

In May 2005, Iraqi official Sami al-Araji reported on the Iraqi government&#x27;s investigation into the theft, indicating that the looters &quot;came in with the cranes and the lorries, and they depleted the whole sites. They knew what they were doing; they knew what they want. This was sophisticated looting.&quot; (&quot;The New York Times&quot;, March 13, 2005).

<text>Willow Run, also known as Air Force Plant 31, was a manufacturing complex in Michigan, United States, located between Ypsilanti Township and Belleville, built by the Ford Motor Company to manufacture aircraft, especially the Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber. Construction of the Willow Run Bomber Plant began in 1940 and was completed in 1942.

== Defense plant ==

The plant began production in summer 1941; the dedication plaque is dated June 16. The plant initially built components. The aircraft manufacturer Douglas Aircraft, and the B-24&#x27;s designer, Consolidated Aircraft, assembled the finished airplane. Remote assembly proved problematic, however, and by October 1941 Ford received permission to produce complete Liberators. Willow Run&#x27;s Liberator assembly line ran until May 1945, building almost half of all the Liberators produced.
===Statistics===
* employees: 42,500
* military draft losses: each month 8,200 workers were drafted into military service
* training: the Aircraft Apprentice School had up to 8,000 students per week complete training and report for work
* size: 3.5-million-square-feet
* dimensions: More than 3,200 feet long and 1,279 feet across at its widest point
* building: Construction began in April 18, 1941
* aircraft: B-24 aircraft production began in the final weeks of 1942
* subassemblies: parts production and subassemblies were produced at almost 1,000 Ford factories and independent suppliers
==Airport==
Willow Run Airport was built as part of the bomber plant. The airfield passed into civilian hands after the war and is now controlled by Wayne County Airport Authority. Part of the airport complex operated at various times as a research facility affiliated with the University of Michigan, and as a secondary United States Air Force Installation. Willow Run Airport has remained active as a cargo and general aviation airfield. Since 1992, it has been home to the Yankee Air Museum.

== Camp Willow Run ==

Willow Run takes its name from a small tributary of the Huron River that meandered through pastureland fields and woodland along the Wayne–Washtenaw county line until the late 1930s. By the mid-1920s, a local family operating as Quirk Farms had bought the land in Van Buren Township that became the airport. Quirk Farms was purchased by automobile pioneer Henry Ford in 1931. Ford, a keen exponent of the virtues of country living, used it as farmland for a &quot;social engineering&quot; experiment that brought inner-city boys to the Willow Run Camp to learn about farming, nature, and the rural way of life.

The residents of the Willow Run Camp planted, tended, and harvested field crops and collected maple syrup, selling their products at the farm market on the property. In the process, the boys were to learn self-discipline and the values of hard work, and benefit from the fresh air of the country.

Camp Willow Run was for boys age 17–19, mostly sons of dead or disabled WWI vets and those helping to support their families. According to the Benson Ford Research Center, the camp offered:

=== Chapel of Martha and Mary ===
Henry and Clara Bryant Ford dedicated a series of churches, the chapels of Martha and Mary as a perpetual tribute to their mothers, Mary Ford and Martha Bryant. The Fords built seven of these: The first at Greenfield Village, Michigan, was completed in 1929. The others, completed in the 1930s, were located in Dearborn, Michigan (site of the Fords&#x27; Fair Lane estate); Sudbury, Massachusetts; two in Richmond Hill, Georgia (the Fords&#x27; winter home); Macon, Michigan; and Willow Run.

The Willow Run Chapel was the one originally built for Camp Willow Run, and became the place of worship for the Belleville Presbyterian Church in 1979 after a series of handoffs. After the war, Ford sold the chapel to Kaiser-Frazer, who in turn sold it to General Motors as part of the purchase of the Willow Run bomber plant. GM used the building to store files until an undetermined time, where it was sold to the Cherry Hill Baptist Church. When Cherry Hill outgrew the little chapel and decided to build a new church, it sold the chapel to the Belleville Presbyterian Church for one dollar in July 1978.

The Willow Run chapel of Martha and Mary now stands a few miles from where it was originally constructed, on property that used to be owned by Henry Ford&#x27;s Quirk Farms. Of the seven chapels, this is the only one currently in use as a regular place of worship. It still has the original pews and other furnishings; the only other set in active use belongs to the Greenfield Village chapel.

== Factory construction ==
Like virtually all of the United States&#x27; industrial concerns, Ford Motor Company, by this time under the direction of Henry Ford&#x27;s only son Edsel, directed its manufacturing output during World War II to Allied war production.

In early 1941 the Federal government established the Liberator Production Pool Program to meet the projected demand for the B-24, and the Ford company, joined the program shortly thereafter. Ford Motor would not only build the bombers, it would supply the airfield as well; the farm at Willow Run was an ideal location for the airfield&#x27;s runways, being under the personal ownership of Henry Ford (thus solving any land acquisition problem) and sited between the main roads and rail lines connecting Detroit with Ann Arbor and points to the west. Easements were acquired from landowners across the county line in Ypsilanti Township where the Liberator plant (and eventually the airport terminal) would be built.

Although officially retired, Henry Ford still had a say in the company&#x27;s affairs and refused government financing for Willow Run, preferring to have his company build the factory and sell it to the government, which would lease it back to the company for the duration of the war. Ford Motor was to have first option on the plant after war production ended, an option it ultimately chose not to exercise, although a rumor in Drew Pearson&#x27;s syndicated column had Ford planning a postwar use as a tractor factory, but that never came to pass. Ford would eventually sell its land to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation&#x27;s Defense Plant Corporation in July 1944, shortly after the Ford farms were transferred to the company&#x27;s ownership.

Architect Albert Kahn designed the main structure of the Willow Run bomber plant, which had of factory space, and an aircraft assembly line over a mile (1600 m) long. It was thought to be the largest factory under one roof anywhere in the world. The Willow Run plant featured four large turntables two-thirds of the way along the assembly lines, allowing the B-24 production lines to make a 90° turn before continuing to final assembly. According to legend, this arrangement allowed the company to pay taxes on the entire plant (and its equipment) to Washtenaw County, and avoid the higher taxes of Wayne County where the airfield is located; overhead views suggest that avoiding encroachment on the airfield&#x27;s taxiways was also a motivation.

===Employee housing crisis===
Even with people driving 100 miles or renting every spare room between Ann Arbor and Grosse Pointe, the sheer size of Willow Run led inevitably to a housing shortage. Because of the urgent need for shelter, the Federal Public Housing Administration took action and built temporary housing.

====Willow Run Lodge and Village====

The resulting housing complexes were built in several different groups. Willow Run Lodge was a series of dormitories for single people and was built on the land north of Michigan Avenue and south of Geddes Road. This covered 90 parcels of land totaling .

In February 1943, the first dormitory (Willow Run Lodge) opened, consisted of fifteen buildings containing 1,900 rooms, some single- and others double-occupancy, with room for 3,000 people. Between June and December 1943, construction was completed on temporary &quot;flat-top&quot; buildings providing homes for 2,500 families. This section was known as Willow Run Village. The flat-tops contained four, six, or eight apartments with one, two, or three bedrooms.

Also in the Willow Run Village were the West Court buildings, with peaked rooftops and space for couples or three adults. Of the 1,000 apartments in West Court, some had no bedrooms and were called &quot;zero bedroom&quot; apartments, and the rest had one bedroom. The first of these apartments were ready for occupancy in August 1943. Another large dormitory project, containing 1,960 rooms and known as West Lodge, was also ready for tenants at that time.

By the end of 1943 there were six different temporary projects in the vicinity of Willow Run: two dormitory projects, two trailer projects (one renting trailers, and another for privately owned trailers; each with community laundry, shower, and toilet facilities), and two projects with apartments for couples or families, West Court and the Village. Between them, there was a shelter for more than 15,000 people, roughly the number of people living in Ypsilanti at the time.

==== Parkridge Homes ====

In addition to the Willow Run Lodge and Village housing projects, another community named Parkridge Homes was also built in 1943 to house African-American Willow Run employees. Efforts to desegregate Willow Run Lodge and Village and build additional integrated housing were rebuffed by the Detroit Housing Commission and the National Housing Agency, so noted African-American architect Hilyard Robinson was contracted to design an 80-unit community. The housing complex remained in use until 2016 as public housing when it was demolished and rebuilt with new modern units. In May 2017, the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office recognized Parkridge Homes with the unveiling three historic markers signifying the importance to Ypsilanti history.

Also constructed at this time was the Parkridge Community Center.

==== Sociological study on Willow Run housing crisis ====
Sociologist and professor Lowell Juilliard Carr and James Edson Stermer of the University of Michigan studied the sociological conditions at Willow Run arising from the wartime surge in the worker population in their book of 1952. They discuss &quot;cultural inadequacy theory&quot;, stating that &quot;industrial culture provides no criterion by which either a manufacturer or a government official can determine in advance when a manufacturer should divert his own capital to housing and other community services and when he shall rely on the capital of others for such facilities and services&quot;.

== Liberator production ==
Despite intensive design efforts led by Ford production executive Charles E. Sorensen, the opening of the plant still saw some mismanagement and bungling, and quality was uneven for some time. Although the Ford Trimotor had been a success in the 1920s, the company had since shied away from aviation, and initially, Ford was assigned to provide B-24 components with final assembly performed by Consolidated at its Fort Worth, Texas plant, or by Douglas Aircraft at its Tulsa, Oklahoma, plant. However, in October 1941, Ford received permission from Consolidated and the Army to assemble complete Liberators on its own at its new Willow Run facility. It took only a short year before finished Liberators left the factory. An amazing feat of factory construction and commissioning.

According to Max Wallace, Air Corps Chief, General &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold told Charles Lindbergh, then a consultant at the plant, that &quot;combat squadrons greatly preferred the B-17 bomber to the B-24 because &#x27;when we send the 17&#x27;s out on a mission, most of them return. But when we send the 24&#x27;s out, most of them don&#x27;t.&#x27;&quot;

A 1943 committee authorized by Congress to examine problems at the plant issued a highly critical report; the Ford Motor Company had created a production line that too closely resembled an automobile assembly line &quot;despite the warning of many experienced aircraftmen.&quot;

Although the jumping of an automotive company into aircraft production posed these quality problems, it also brought remarkable production rates. The plant held the distinction of being the world&#x27;s largest enclosed &quot;room.&quot; The first Ford-built Liberator rolled off the Willow Run line in September 1942; the first series of Willow Run Liberators was the B-24E model.
The Willow Run Plant had many initial startup problems, due primarily to the fact that Ford employees were used to automobile mass production and found it difficult to adapt these techniques to aircraft production. The plant at Willow Run was also beset with labor difficulties, high absentee rates, and rapid employee turnover. The factory was nearly an hour&#x27;s drive from Detroit, and the imposition of wartime gasoline and tire rationing had made the daily commute difficult. In only one month, Ford had hired 2,900 workers but had lost 3,100.

Also, Henry Ford was cantankerous and rigid in his ways. He was violently anti-union and there were serious labor difficulties, including a massive strike. In addition, Henry Ford refused on principle to hire women. However, he finally relented and did employ &quot;Rosie the Riveters&quot; on his assembly lines, probably more because so many of his potential male workers had been drafted into the military than due to any sudden change of principle on his part.

By autumn 1943, the top leadership role at Willow Run had passed from Charles Sorensen to Mead L. Bricker.

At the request of the government, Ford began to decentralize operations and many parts were assembled at other Ford plants as well as by the company&#x27;s sub-contractors, with the Willow Run plant concentrating on final aircraft assembly. The bugs were eventually worked out of the manufacturing processes, and by 1944, Ford was rolling a Liberator off the Willow Run production line every 63 minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

At its peak monthly production (April, 1944), Willow Run produced 428 B-24s with highest production listed as 100 completed bombers flying away from Willow Run between April 24 and April 26, 1944. By 1945, Ford produced 70% of the B-24s in two 9-hour shifts. Ford built 6,972 of the 18,482 total B-24s and produced ‘knock down’ kits for 1,893 more to be assembled by Consolidated in Ft. Worth, TX and Douglas Aircraft in Tulsa, OK. The B-24 holds the distinction of being the most produced heavy bomber in history.

=== Army Air Forces support and post-production activities ===
After their manufacture, the next step in the process was the delivery of the aircraft to the operational squadrons. This was done at Willow Run by 1st Concentration Command (1st CC). The 1st CC was responsible for completing the organization and equipment of tactical and combat bombardment squadrons prior to their deployment to the overseas combat theaters. It also provided a final inspection of the aircraft and made any appropriate final changes; i.e., install long-range fuel tanks, remove unnecessary equipment, and give it a final flight safety test.

While the planes were being serviced and made ready for overseas movement, personnel for these planes were also being processed. Pilots, co-pilots, navigators and crew chiefs were assigned as a crew for each aircraft, sleeping on 1,300 cots as they waited for the B-24s to roll off the assembly line. Paperwork was handled, necessary specific B-24 life support equipment was issued and some technical training for supporting the aircraft accomplished.

Once production began, it became difficult to introduce changes dictated by field experience in the various overseas theaters onto the production line in a timely fashion. Consequently, newly constructed Liberators needed modifications for the specific geographic areas they were to be flown in combat. For this reason, a series of Air Technical Service Command modification centers were established for the incorporation of these required theater changes into new Liberators following their manufacture and assignments. There were seven known modification centers: the Birmingham Air Depot in Alabama; Consolidated&#x27;s Fort Worth plant, the Oklahoma City Air Materiel Center at Tinker Field, the Tucson Modification Center at Tucson International Airport; the Northwest Airlines Depot in Minneapolis; the, Martin-Omaha manufacturing plant, and the Hawaiian Air Depot at Hickam Field. The Birmingham Air Depot&#x27;s primary mission was modifying Liberators from Willow Run.

=== Liberator variants produced at Willow Run ===
The B-24E was the first variant for primary manufacture at Willow Run. Ford built 490 complete planes and supplied B-24E components as kits that could be trucked for final assembly at Consolidated in Fort Worth and Douglas in Tulsa, 144 and 167 kits respectively.
B-24Es built and fully assembled at Ford were designated B-24E-FO; those assembled at Tulsa and Fort Worth out of parts supplied by Ford were designated B-24E-DT and B-24E-CF respectively. Because of production delays the B-24Es produced at Willow Run were, generally, obsolete by the time they came off the production lines, and most were relegated to training roles in the United States and hence few ever saw combat.

The B-24H was the first variant produced by Ford at Willow Run in large numbers that went into combat. The B-24H differed from earlier B-24s by having a nose turret, the Emerson Electric A-15, to increase defensive firepower. Due to the many structural changes required the first B-24Hs were delivered slightly behind schedule, with the first machines rolling off the production lines at Ford in late June 1943. Production for the B-24H at Willow Run was 1,780 aircraft.

Upon the introduction of the B-24J, all three of the Liberator manufacturing plants converted to the production of this version. The B-24J incorporated a hydraulically driven tail turret and other defensive armament modifications in the nose of the aircraft. The bomber plant produced its first B-24J in April 1944; 1587 were built at Willow Run.

During June 1944, the Army determined that the San Diego and Willow Run plants would be capable of meeting all future requirements for Liberator production. The Boeing B-29 Superfortress was taking over the long-range bombing role in the Pacific Theater and no new B-24 units were programmed for deployment in the other combat theaters of Europe, the Mediterranean or in the China Burma India.

The B-24L was the first product of the new, downsized Liberator production pool. It was an attempt to reverse the trend toward ever-increasing weight of the Liberator as more and more armament, equipment, and armor had been added, with no corresponding increase in engine power. With the weight reduction measures and more powerful engines, it also had a much longer range than earlier models. 1,250 B-24L aircraft were built at Willow Run.

The B-24M was the last large-scale production variant of the Liberator. Apart from a new tail turret, the B-24M differed little from the B-24L. The first B-24Ms were delivered in October 1944, and by the end of its production in 1945, Willow Run had built 1677; a further 124 B-24Ms to be built by Ford were cancelled before delivery.

Ford had switched over to the single-tailed B-24N in May 1945, but the end of the war in Europe in the same month brought a rapid end to Liberator production; the contract with Ford was officially terminated on 31 May 1945. Orders for 5,168 unbuilt B-24N bombers were cancelled and only seven &#x27;pre-production&#x27; YB-24N were built by Ford. Liberator production at Willow Run ended June 1945.

== Post-war conversion ==
Although Ford had an option to purchase the plant once it was no longer needed for war production, the company declined to exercise it, and ended its association with Willow Run.

=== Kaiser ===

After Ford declined to purchase the plant, it was sold to the Kaiser-Frazer Corporation, a partnership of construction and shipbuilding magnate Henry J. Kaiser and Graham-Paige executive Joseph W. Frazer. The plant produced both Kaiser and Frazer automobile models, including the compact Henry J, which with minor differences was also sold through Sears-Roebuck as the Allstate.

Willow Run produced 739,000 cars as part of Kaiser-Frazer and Kaiser Motors, from 1947 through 1953, when after years of losses, the company (now called Kaiser Motors after Frazer&#x27;s exit from the partnership) purchased Willys-Overland and began moving its production at Willow Run to the Willys plant in Toledo, Ohio.

As the US Air Force struggled to expand its airlift capacity during the Korean War, Kaiser-Frazer built C-119 Flying Boxcar cargo planes at Willow Run under license from Fairchild Aircraft, producing an estimated 88 C-119s between 1951 and 1953. Kaiser bought half of the Chase Aircraft company in order to access the military contract for the C-123 Provider transport aircraft. Senate hearings into the C-119 production by Kaiser found that the Kaiser aircraft were costing far more than Fairchild&#x27;s. C-123 contracts were cancelled by the USAAF and the only airframes built were scrapped

=== General Motors operations ===
Later in 1953, after a fire on August 12 destroyed General Motors&#x27; Detroit Transmission factory in Livonia, Michigan, the Willow Run complex was first leased and then later sold to GM. The salvaged Hydramatic transmission tooling and machinery relocated to Willow Run and were back in production just nine weeks after the fire.
Over the years, GM expanded the bomber plant by roughly half, into a nearly GM Powertrain factory and engineering center. A parcel of land to the south of Powertrain was set aside for assembly operations that began in 1959, with a Fisher Body plant that built bodies for the Chevrolet models assembled there, including the Corvair and Nova. In 1968, General Motors began reorganizing its body and assembly operations into the GM Assembly Division (GMAD). GMAD required 16 years to completely absorb Fisher Body&#x27;s operations, and Fisher would manufacture bodies at Willow Run Assembly until the 1970s; vehicles would roll off the line there until 1992.

In addition to making automatic transmissions, Willow Run Transmission also produced the M16A1 rifle and the M39A1 20mm autocannon for the US military during the Vietnam War.

By the time General Motors entered bankruptcy in 2009, manufacturing and assembly operations at Willow Run had dwindled to almost nothing; the GM Powertrain plant closed in December 2010 and the complex passed into the control of the RACER Trust, which is charged with cleaning up, positioning for redevelopment and ultimately, selling properties of the former General Motors.

=== MARC and Willow Run Laboratories ===
On the other side of the airport from the assembly plant were a group of World War II hangars, which were sold to the University of Michigan in 1946. The university operated the Michigan Aeronautical Research Center (MARC), later known as Willow Run Laboratories (WRL), from 1946 to 1972. MARC and WRL produced innovations, including the first ruby laser and operation of the ruby maser, as well as early research into antiballistic missile defense and advanced remote sensing.

In 1972, the university spun off WRL into the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, which eventually left Willow Run for offices in Ann Arbor.
==Postwar==
Ford built the factory and sold it to the government, then leased it back for the duration of the war. When Ford declined to purchase the facility after the war, Kaiser-Frazer Corporation gained ownership, and in 1953 Ford&#x27;s rival General Motors took ownership and operated the factory as Willow Run Transmission until 2010. Willow Run Assembly operated from 1959 to 1992 on a parcel to the south of the airport. The Fisher Body division also operated at Willow Run Assembly until its operations were assumed by the GM Assembly Division in the 1970s. In 2009, General Motors announced that it would shut down all operations at the GM Powertrain plant and engineering center in the coming year.

Since the 2010 closure of Willow Run Transmission, the factory complex has been managed by the RACER Trust, which controls the properties of the former General Motors. In 2011, A.E. Equities Group Holdings offered to buy the former Powertrain plant from the RACER Trust. In April 2013, a redevelopment manager for the RACER Trust said unused portions of the powertrain plant would likely be razed as a step toward redeveloping the property. Indeed, the majority of the plant was demolished in late 2013 and early 2014. In 2014, the Yankee Air Museum moved into the bomber factory.

In November 2016, RACER Trust sold Willow Run to an entity created by the State of Michigan, which leases the property to the American Center for Mobility (AMC).

The Willow Run complex has given its name to a community on the east side of Ypsilanti, defined roughly by the boundaries of the former Willow Run Community School District.

==Redevelopment efforts and the Yankee Air Museum==
The airfield, owned by the Wayne County Airport Authority since 2004, continues to operate as the Willow Run Airport and is primarily used for cargo and general aviation flights. The Yankee Air Museum resides on the airport grounds, occupying as of April 2013 a hangar and other properties.

For a period of time before the eventual demolition of Willow Run Assembly, portions were used as a warehouse, about a quarter of which was leased by GM as a facility for parts distribution.

In April 2013, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; confirmed that the facility&#x27;s current owner, RACER Trust, was negotiating with the Yankee Air Museum to preserve a small portion of the original bomber plant as a new home for the museum. Yankee was originally granted until August 2013 (deadline was later extended) to raise the funds needed to purchase and separate a portion of the approximately 5,000,000 sq. ft. building, which later became the GM Powertrain facility. The museum would consolidate operations scattered on various parcels at Willow Run, and the Trust expects to clear the remainder of the plant for redevelopment. The portion of the original bomber plant that Yankee seeks to preserve is less than 5% of the massive facility, comprises the end of the former B-24 assembly line at the far eastern edge of the property, and contains the two iconic bay doors from which the finished Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers exited the plant during World War II.

The campaign to save a portion of Willow Run for the Yankee Air Museum was called SaveTheBomberPlant.org, and is centered on a fundraising website by the same name. The campaign attracted national, and even international, attention from media outlets that include many major news dailies in the US as well as National Public Radio, &quot;The History Channel&quot; magazine, National Geographic TV, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, the latter two of the UK.

Building owner RACER Trust extended the original fundraising deadline (August 1, 2013) a total of three times since the Yankee Air Museum launched its SaveTheBomberPlant.org campaign. The first two extensions were to October 1, 2013, and then to November 1, 2013. On October 26, 2013, RACER Trust and the Yankee Air Museum again reached a third, and final, deadline extension agreement that gave Yankee until May 1, 2014, to raise the $8 million estimated as necessary to secure, enclose and preserve a portion of the original Willow Run plant for the Yankee Air Museum. The majority of the $8 million goal reflects separation costs to make the preserved portion of the plant viable as a standalone structure. RACER Trust has been supportive of the campaign, even reconfiguring engineering and demolition plans to save cost for the museum.

By the May 1, 2014, deadline, the Yankee Air Museum had raised over $7 million of its original $8 million fundraising goal, which was enough to enable the building&#x27;s owners to move forward with signing a Purchase Agreement with Yankee, with the actual purchase expected to be finalized in late summer or fall of 2014.

Meanwhile, the remaining portion of the Willow Run property, which includes over 95% of the historic original bomber plant building, was optioned to Walbridge, Inc., for redevelopment as a connected car research and test facility. The option to Walbridge has since lapsed and the property remains available for purchase and redevelopment.

==Decommission and demolition==

Michigan Live reporter Amy Biolchini toured the empty Willow Run facility in early 2013, observing:

Part of the tour led them to a hidden room within the facility:

Demolition of the majority of the Willow Run facility began in December 2013. The Yankee Air Museum was able to gain control of approximately 144,900 square feet of the plant, and plans to develop a permanent home for the museum. By mid-2014, the majority of the facility had been demolished and cleared.

<text>Paatos is a Swedish rock band that was formed in 1999 by Reine Fiske and Stefan Dimle (both previous members of Landberk), Petronella Nettermalm, Ricard Nettermalm and Johan Wallen. Paatos is usually classified as progressive rock, albeit influenced by bands such as Portishead and Massive Attack.

==History==
Paatos was formed in 1999 by Reine Fiske and Stefan Dimle of the Swedish band Landberk, and Ricard &quot;Huxflux&quot; Nettermalm and Johan Wallen of the band Agg. The band appeared at a folk rock festival with Turid Lindqvist and later recruited vocalist Petronella Nettermalm, Ricard&#x27;s wife. 

The band recorded their first single &quot;Perception/Tea&quot; in early 2001, and quickly assembled material for their full-length debut, &quot;Timeloss&quot;, released in 2002. The same year, the band composed and performed music for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Nosferatu&quot;.

Reine Fiske was replaced by Peter Nylander on guitar in 2003. During this time, the band was noticed by British band Porcupine Tree and played a couple of concerts in Sweden as their opening act. Steven Wilson went on to mix Paatos&#x27; next studio album, &quot;Kallocain&quot;, released in the summer of 2004.

After the release of third album &quot;Silence of Another Kind&quot;, the band again provided the support for Porcupine Tree on the successful European &quot;Deadwing&quot; tour of 2006. Recordings of that tour appeared as the live album &quot;Sensors&quot;.

During a lengthy break from band activities, it was announced in April 2009 that Stefan Dimle and Johan Wallén had left Paatos. In December of the same year, it was announced that the band has a new member, bassist Ulf &quot;Rockis&quot; Ivarsson.

The band released &quot;Breathing&quot; in February 2011. Later that year they went on a European tour supporting Riverside.

&quot;V&quot;, released in 2012, marked the final studio sessions of the band until 2024, when the release of new songs was announced.

<doc id="1113453" wikidata="Q788897" url="?curid=1113453" title="Interstate 265">
<text>Interstate 265 (I-265) is a Interstate Highway partially encircling the Louisville metropolitan area. Starting from I-65 in the southern part of Louisville, it runs through Jefferson County, Kentucky, crosses the Ohio River on the Lewis and Clark Bridge into Indiana, meets I-65 for a second time, and then proceeds westbound to terminate at the I-64 interchange.

The entire Kentucky stretch of the road is cosigned with Kentucky Route 841 (KY 841). An additional stretch of freeway between U.S. Route 31W (US 31W)/US 60/KY 1934 and I-65 in the southern Louisville is solely designated as KY 841. The portion from I-71 to the Ohio River, while designated as I-265 by AASHTO, is only signed as KY 841. The highway is named the Gene Snyder Freeway (originally named the Jefferson Freeway), after the former congressman from Kentucky, and usually called &quot;the Snyder&quot; by locals.

Likewise on the Indiana side, the stretch from I-65 to the bridge, while designated as I-265 is signed as State Route 265 (SR 265). The highway is known as the Lee H. Hamilton Freeway after the former congressman from Indiana.

I-265 signage for the section from I-71 to the Indiana I-65 interchange has not yet been placed.

==Route description==
| IN || 
| KY || 
| Total || 

===Indiana===
I-265 in the US state of Indiana presently runs from I-64 at the western edge of New Albany to the Lewis and Clark Bridge near Utica. Beginning at its western terminus, the freeway is concurrent with State Road 62 (SR 62) until exit 10.

===Kentucky===
I-265 in the U.S. state of Kentucky presently runs from the Lewis and Clark Bridge in northern Louisville to an interchange with I-65 in southern Louisville. The entire freeway is concurrent with KY 841.

The Gene Snyder Freeway, in which KY 841 and I-265 overlap for between I-65 and the Indiana state line, has seen an increase in serious accidents. The primary factors stem from its low-level grass median which offers little to no protection for crossover incidents. Driver inattention and increased traffic and congestion has led to a decline in the overall level-of-service. In 2006, cable barriers were installed in the median for between I-71 and I-64, with further installation possible in the near future. For many years, a section of the freeway spanning from exit 30 to exit 32 was signed in kilometers, which is unusual in the United States. Most but not all of the kilometer-based signs were replaced with mile-only signage as part of an expansion project set for completion in fall 2024.

===Kentucky Route 841===

Kentucky Route 841 (KY 841) is a state highway in the suburbs of Louisville. The route is a partial beltway, encircling Louisville on its southern and eastern sides. Compass direction changes to the north and south of exit 23, the Taylorsville Road interchange. The western terminus of the route is at US 31W and US 60 in the southwest Louisville community of Valley Station, where KY 841 continues to the west as KY 1934 while the northern terminus is at the Lewis and Clark Bridge north of the north of the East End Tunnel. Even though the section between its terminus at KY 1934 and I-65 was built to Interstate Highway standards, it is designated only as KY 841 due to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) numbering rules. The exit numbering for the Kentucky portion of beltway currently starts at the western terminus of KY 841. The KY 841 designation mostly concurrent with I-265 in Kentucky has remained.

==History==

=== Kentucky portion ===
Originally signed as KY 841, the Jefferson Freeway was initially constructed in the 1960s in two sections—one between KY 155 (Taylorsville Road) and US 60 (Shelbyville Road) and a second section between KY 1447 (Westport Road) and US 42—as short connectors to the eastern suburban expansion as well as a new Ford plant. By 1970, I-264 had become very congested and was in need of reconstruction and other improvements. I-265 was proposed as an outer beltway to provide pass-through motorists relief from the congestion of I-264. Construction started in the early 1980s and was finished later that decade and signed in 1987.
=== Indiana portion ===
Originally signed as State Road 265 (SR 265), the segment of the highway stretched from I-64 to I-65. It was later extended to SR 60, today&#x27;s exit 10. The freeway was legally rechristened in June 2019 to I-265 after a new section of highway that includes the Lewis and Clark Bridge (known as the East End Bridge during planning and construction) fully opened to traffic on December 18, 2016, however the SR 265 signs along the road and the exits still remain and have not been updated to I-265 signage, while the Kentucky portion of the new roadway likewise has not had I-265 signage added as of yet. In early 2023, Indiana DOT announced plans to redesignate as well as renumber the exits of the freeway beginning in the fall of 2023 and with completion expected over the . As of February 2025, I-265 signage exists from the western terminus at I-64 to Charlestown Pike, about a mile west of the IN 62 interchange.

=== East End Bridge ===
Negotiations between Indiana and Kentucky to build the bridge had taken place over the preceding 30 years.

In late 2005, members of the Louisville Metro Council proposed a committee to begin planning a western bridge over the Ohio River to link the southwestern end of the highway in Kentucky to Indiana.

On December 18, 2016, SR 265 was extended east of SR 62, which crosses the Ohio River connecting with KY 841, and north of US 42 in Kentucky as part of the Ohio River Bridges Project, creating a bypass around the eastern side of the city of Louisville.

The I-265/I-64 interchange, previously a cloverleaf with no collector–distributor lanes, was reconstructed as part of the I-Move Kentucky project, with estimated completion originally set for fall 2023 but delayed to fall 2024.

<text>Henry Rutgers (October 7, 1745 – February 17, 1830) was a United States Revolutionary War hero and philanthropist from New York City. Rutgers University was named after him, and he donated a bond which placed the college on sound financial footing. He also gave a bell that is still in use.

==Early life==
Rutgers was born in New York City, in the Province of New York which was then a part of British America. He was the son of New Netherland colonists Hendrick Rutgers and Catharine (née DePeyster) Rutgers.

His maternal grandparents were Johannes de Peyster, the 23rd Mayor of New York City, and Anna (née Bancker) de Peyster, the sister of Evert Bancker, the 3rd and 12th Mayor of Albany, New York. His paternal grandparents were Harmanus Rutgers and Rachel (née Meyers) Rutgers, herself a granddaughter of Claes Martenszen van Rosenvelt, the first Roosevelt to arrive in America. Through his father&#x27;s sister, he was a first cousin of Samuel Provoost, the first Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. He was a third cousin twice removed of both U.S. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

In 1728 Harmanus Rutgers, Jr. purchased a farm near present-day East Broadway and Oliver Streets. Rutgers was a brewer and had a barn on Catherine Street to store the barley he grew. A lane that would later become Cherry Street ran along the southern border. His son Hendrick inherited the property and in 1754 built a new farmhouse farther to the north and nearer the East River. The Rutgers extended their holdings, purchasing water lots. Fill was added to the water on either side at the ends of the larger streets that ran perpendicular to the shore, forming slips or inlets where small boats could dock.

==Career==
Rutgers graduated from King&#x27;s College (now Columbia University) in 1766. Following his graduation, he promptly became an advocate for independence of the American colonies from Great Britain. He went on to serve as a captain of American forces at the Battle of White Plains, and later as a colonel for the New York militia. During the British occupation of New York, Rutgers withdrew to Albany. During his absence, the British used the family home as an army hospital.

Rutgers continued to play a role in the defense of the young nation after the Revolution, presiding over a meeting held June 24, 1812, to organize American forces in New York in anticipation of a British attack in the ensuing War of 1812.

===Politics and public life===

In 1783, Rutgers was elected to the New York State Assembly, where he served in the 7th New York State Legislature. He also served on the New York Board of Education Regents from 1802 to 1826. He was a presidential elector, chosen by the legislature, in 1808, 1816, and 1820.

Rutgers supported the American Colonization Society, arguing against abolitionists that free people of color should be removed from the United States rather than allowed to grow as a population. He was himself a slaveowner, like many of his relatives.

Rutgers continued to expand his holdings, extending his water lots further out into the river. In his later years, Rutgers, a bachelor, devoted much of his fortune to philanthropy. As a landowner with considerable holdings on the island of Manhattan (especially in the vicinity of Chatham Square), he donated land for the use of schools, churches, and charities in the area. Both Henry Street and Rutgers Street in lower Manhattan are named for him, as well as the Rutgers Presbyterian Church (formerly the Collegiate Presbyterian Church) which was also named for Rutgers who donated the parcel of land at the corner of Henry Street and Rutgers Street on which the original church was built in 1798.

Rutgers&#x27; most lasting legacy, however, is due to his donations to Queen&#x27;s College in New Brunswick, New Jersey, which at the time was suffering considerable financial difficulties and temporarily closed. The college had been founded as a seminary for the Reformed Church in America and appealed to Rutgers, a devout member of the church with a reputation for philanthropy, for aid. Rutgers donated a bond valued at $5000 to reopen the faltering school, and subsequently donated a bronze bell that was hung in the cupola of the Old Queens building which housed the college. In gratitude, and hoping the college would be remembered in Rutgers&#x27; will, the trustees renamed it Rutgers College on December 5, 1825. (Rutgers left nothing to the college upon his death.) The institution later became Rutgers University, then Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.

==Death and legacy==

Rutgers died in 1830 in New York City, at the age of 84. His body was initially buried in the Reformed Church on Nassau Street (the same church in which he was baptized) in Manhattan. However, as cemeteries in Manhattan were redeveloped during the mid-1800s, Rutgers&#x27; body was re-interred several times (first moved in 1858 to the Middle Church in Lafayette Place, on the corner of Nassau Street and Cedar Street in Manhattan, and then, in 1865, interred in Green-Wood Cemetery). For many years, no one remembered where his body had been finally buried, although it was long believed that he was buried in a Dutch Reformed churchyard in Belleville, New Jersey. One road running alongside this New Jersey graveyard is now called Rutgers Street (signed as, but not technically part of, Route 7).

Misplaced by history for over 140 years, Rutgers&#x27; final grave was rediscovered in October 2007 by Civil War research volunteers sifting through burial records of the historical Green-Wood Cemetery. In 1865, Rutgers&#x27; body had been finally buried in an unmarked grave (he is interred in Lot 10776, Sec. 28, in an underground vault) within the Dutch Reformed Church&#x27;s plot at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

The Green-Wood Historic Fund and members of the Rutgers Community honored Rutgers&#x27; memory on Flag Day, June 14, 2008, by unveiling a bronze marker at his gravesite. Elsewhere in Green-Wood Cemetery lies the grave of Mabel Smith Douglass, founder and first dean of the New Jersey College for Women (renamed Douglass College in her honor). Douglass College is part of Rutgers University&#x27;s New Brunswick campus.

<doc id="1113470" wikidata="Q5259123" url="?curid=1113470" title="Denniston, New Zealand">
<text>Denniston is a small settlement, 15 kilometres (9 miles) east of Westport, on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It is situated on the Denniston Plateau, above sea level in the Papahaua Ranges.

It is named for R. B. Denniston, manager of the first major mine to open on the West Coast in the 1870s. During the first few decades of the 20th century, up to 1400 people lived in the townships on the Denniston Plateau to service the large coal mines there. Coal was transported in railway wagons from the plateau via the Denniston Incline to Conns Creek, where steam locomotives of New Zealand Railways took coal trains to the port of Westport.

The Denniston Incline closed in 1967. The plateau now has a population of fewer than 10 people, and virtually all the buildings and structures are gone, although many historical relics remain – scattered throughout the plateau and incline area amongst the scrub vegetation.

The open-cast Escarpment Mine Project was established by Bathurst Resources in an area of 200 hectares of conservation land on the southern Denniston Plateau. Mining commenced in 2014, but was suspended in 2016 in response to the closure in June of the Holcim cement works at Cape Foulwind and a decline in global prices for hard coking coal.

==Overview==

The townships of the Denniston Plateau, and the Denniston Incline itself, existed solely to extract coal from the plateau. Living conditions at Denniston were harsh; the rocky, windswept plateau is often immersed in cloud, receives a high annual rainfall, and very low temperatures are common. Once good road access to the plateau was established and the demand for coal declined, the townships shrank – and disappeared altogether once the incline and mines closed. A former schoolhouse, now used as a museum, is one of the few buildings remaining. Very few people now live on the plateau but the area is of increasing interest to tourists interested in its history. Future opencast mining is a possibility.

The setting and history of Denniston is similar to that of Millerton, located on a similar plateau to the north.

==History==
===The Westport Coal Company===
The Westport Colliery Company, predecessor to the Westport Coal Company, was formed in 1878 to mine the high quality coal on the Mount Rochfort Plateau, commonly known as the Denniston Plateau. To access the coal, the company extended the nearby Wellington Coal Company&#x27;s branch railway on the south bank of the Waimangaroa River by to Conns Creek, and constructed the Denniston Incline, and the roperoads from the mines to the top of the incline. To raise additional capital to develop the mines further, the Westport Colliery Company was reformed into the Westport Coal Company in 1881. The company also operated mines in other places on the West Coast, including Millerton, and by 1905, the company was by far the largest coal producer in New Zealand. The Westport Coal Company&#x27;s mines and the Denniston Incline were taken over by the New Zealand State Mines Department in 1948.

===Denniston incline===

The Denniston Incline began operation in April 1880. It was a self-acting ropeway that used gravity to lower 12.5 ton gross laden weight New Zealand Railways&#x27; coal wagons one at a time from Brakehead, at Denniston, at the top to Conns Creek below. Each descending wagon hauled an empty one up the incline by means of wire ropes, each wagon attached to its own rope and brake drum. The two drums were mounted beside each other on a common shaft, and the wire rope wound in opposite directions on each drum. So while one drum was letting the rope out and lowering a full wagon down the incline, the other drum was winding its rope in and pulling an empty wagon up the incline. Hydraulic pistons slowed the rotation of the winding drums to control the speed of the wagons.

The Denniston Incline was actually two inclines. The higher of the two began at Brakehead, and descended steeply to the appropriately named Middle Brake. Here wagons were disconnected from the first incline&#x27;s rope, and placed on the rope of the second incline for a more gentle descent to Conns Creek, where the accumulated wagons would then be marshalled into trains before being taken to Westport. The drum from Middle Brake is now on display at Westport&#x27;s Coaltown Museum.

The upper part of each incline had essentially two sets of railway tracks side by side (three rails, with the inner rail shared by both tracks), while below the midsection of each incline (where wagons passed each other) the two sets of track were &#x27;interwoven&#x27;. Each side of the inclines alternately had wagons ascending and descending – otherwise the ropes would get crossed over. (An image of a full wagon descending the upper part of one incline can be seen below in External links.) The southern side of the inclines was called the &#x27;Company Side&#x27;, as that was the side the company offices were located on; the northern side of the inclines was called the &#x27;Donkey Side&#x27;.

The system did not always function as intended and collisions, derailments and runaways were not unknown. The remains of several wrecked wagons still lie beside, or even some distance from, the incline formation.

The Denniston incline fell a total of in 1,670 metres (83 chains or 1.04 miles), with some sections having gradients steeper than 1 in 1.3. The short-lived Koranui Incline on the other side of the valley was higher, with a total fall of , and over twice as long as the Denniston Incline, with a length of .

Wagons could be delivered from Denniston to Conns Creek at a rate of 12 to 18 wagons per hour. The track gauge was the standard NZR track gauge of . The railway wagons used on the incline were mainly the common &quot;Q&quot; class hopper wagons, the hoppers of which could be detached from their wagon bodies and lifted by wharf crane over the hold of a ship, and the bottom discharge doors of the wagons then opened manually to discharge coal into the ships&#x27; holds. (Two images of a crane lifting a hopper out of a wagon and over a ship&#x27;s hold can be seen below in External links.)

===The mines and roperoads===
The mines on the Denniston Plateau included the Banbury, Ironbridge, Coalbrookdale, Whareatea, and Sullivan mines. The first mine was the Banbury, which began production in 1880. A double track gauge 560-metre long horse tramway was built from the top of the incline to the Banbury Mine above the Waimangaroa Gorge to carry coal from the mine to the top of the incline. Later, horse-power was replaced by a steam engine-powered moving endless rope to which mine tubs were hooked by chains for their journeys to and from the bins at Brakehead. By 1889, the double track tramway (now called a roperoad) had been extended through and beyond the Banbury Mine, past the Ironbrook Mine and on to the Coalbrookdale Mine—a distance of about . The roperoad system was renewed along a partly new alignment between 1900 and 1904. (An image of one of these roperoads can be seen below in External links.)

In 1952, a monocable aerial ropeway in length was commissioned (with buckets carrying coal suspended from the rope) to carry coal from the new Whareata and Sullivan mines to Brakehead, and the roperoad was abandoned. The Coalbrookdale and Ironbridge mines had reached the end of their economic lives and closed in 1944 and 1945 respectively; Banbury Mine had closed in 1890.

The Westport Coal Company&#x27;s coal production from the Denniston Plateau increased to an annual peak in 1910, when 464 men working underground produced 348,335 tons of coal. Production then declined. In all, the incline carried an estimated 12.6 million tons of coal during its life. Some mining continued and the Escarpment Mine operated from 1964 to 1982.

===The townships and people===
There were three main townships on the Denniston Plateau – Denniston, Burnett&#x27;s Face, and Coalbrookdale. There were no roads connecting the townships, and everyone walked alongside the roperoads to move about. The population of the plateau as a whole peaked in 1911, at just over 1400 inhabitants (the population of Denniston township peaked later, in 1926).

====Denniston====
The first settlement, known as &quot;The Camp&quot;, was located on a rock ledge above the Waimangaroa River. It was built below the level of the plateau between two escarpments for protection from relentless winds. The first workers developed the Banbury Mine, but many did not stay long owing to the inhospitable conditions. However, by 1883 there were about a hundred residents, a school, and a brass band. The company&#x27;s offices were above The Camp and Brakehead, alongside the tramway from the mine to the top of the incline.

A bridle track was built between Waimangaroa and Denniston by 1885. Prior to this, the only access for people and goods had been to ride in coal wagons travelling at high speed up or down the incline.

Settlement soon spread up onto the plateau itself, and by 1887, there were three hotels, a postal and telegraph office, four general stores, three butchers and three bakers in Denniston. Living conditions were squalid and visitors complained about the unsanitary and &#x27;smelly&#x27; nature of the township. The cottages were utilitarian small wooden buildings with roofs and chimneys of corrugated iron. There was no running water, no baths in houses, and toilets were tin sheds with cans that were emptied by night cart men. Large families were often confined to two-room huts for long periods during bad weather. There were no shrubs, flowers or gardens. Even after 20 years, these poor living conditions still prevailed.

Denniston played a key role in the development of the union movement in New Zealand, and the country&#x27;s first miner&#x27;s union was formed at Denniston in 1884. A report to the coal industry in 1919 attributed much of the industrial unrest and dissatisfaction of the Deniston miners to their &#x27;sordid&#x27; living conditions.

Denniston had a communal recreation and sports ground, its own sports clubs and Returned Services Association, and churches included Presbyterian, Methodist, Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Salvation Army. There were five lodges (Masonic, Druids, Odd Fellows, Orange and Buffaloes). In the days before social welfare, in an isolated community on low hourly wages, churches, unions, friendly societies and lodges provided important security for their members. Miners had formed their own Medical Association in 1883 (a doctor was contracted to visit Denniston twice a week) and an Accident and Relief Fund Association was formed in 1890. A hospital, which opened in 1910 – paid for by subscriptions, levies and fundraising efforts – was built in a central location to deal with emergencies from mines in all directions. Denniston did not have a cemetery as the ground was too hard; bodies were transported from Denniston to Waimangaroa for burial, initially down the Denniston Incline and later by road.

The peak of population came in 1926, when there were 910 living in the township. During the 1932–35 Depression, and after World War 2, people began to move away from Denniston, with many houses being moved in sections for re-erection at Waimangaroa or Westport. For the remaining workers, the provision of buses enabled them and their families to live in more pleasant conditions down on the coastal plain. The school, last shop, and last hotel (the Red Dog Saloon, owned by Johnny Cotter) closed in the 1960s, and the Post Office closed in 1971. The last lodge, the Buffaloes Lodge, closed in 1996 – though by then it had relocated from Denniston to the former Waimangaroa RSA rooms.

====Burnett&#x27;s Face====

The development of the Ironbridge Mine led to the establishment of the settlement known as Burnett&#x27;s Face, about 2 kilometres southeast from Denniston. It was initially a cluster of tents, but by 1891 there were wooden cottages, a school, two hotels, a butchery, a bakery, several stores, two halls, and two billiard saloons. Its main road was the constantly running roperoad skipway linking the mine with the bins at the head of the Denniston Incline. By the 1950s, little remained of the settlement.

====Coalbrookdale====
Another township, Coalbrookdale, stretched for several hundred metres along sides of the roperoad in the lower Coalbrookdale Valley, southwest of Burnett&#x27;s Face. There were about 21 buildings in Coalbrookdale in 1891, and the population peaked in 1896 when there were 165 people living in the valley. There was a licensed hotel from 1894 to c.1921. The last permanent resident departed in 1956.

===Decline and closure===
The community at Denniston served no other purpose than to support the operations of the coal mines and the incline. Once a usable road was put through from Waimangaroa to the plateau, people started to drift away from the plateau to the warmer climate of Waimangaroa or Westport below.

By the 1960s, demand for coal was falling and the Denniston Incline closed on 16 August 1967. The Conns Creek branch, which connected to the foot of the incline, was cut back to become a long spur siding where the coal carried by truck from the bins at Brakehead was transferred into railway wagons. A few months later, in 1968, the aerial ropeway from the mines also closed in favour of trucking of coal down the hill directly from the mines. In May 1968, the Inangahua earthquake caused much damage to the incline, making the closure irreversible. Thus, what was once described as the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot; by locals, faded into history.

==Denniston Plateau today==
===Heritage preservation===
Little remains of the Incline or the townships on the plateau but relics can be found throughout the area. Middle Brake is one of the most intact industrial areas remaining because its inaccessibility resulted in much equipment being left on site. At Brakehead and Denniston township, the main street grid, building foundations, chimneys, and the square water tanks that many houses had, are the main relics that can be seen. Most of the former building sites are empty and covered in low scrub and only a few buildings still stand. The former high school is occupied by the Friends of the Hill and is used as a museum and information centre. Other remaining buildings are now privately owned.

Denniston is listed as a Category 1 Historic Place on the New Zealand Heritage List, and considered to have special or outstanding historical or cultural significance or value.

The Denniston Incline and the key historical areas of the plateau are now managed by the New Zealand Department of Conservation. At Brakehead, replicas have been built of some of the former trackwork and three original Q wagons placed on the site.

With recognition of the historic nature of Denniston and its increasing status as a local tourist icon and one that is close to Westport, a group of mainly locals, The Friends of the Hill, seek to preserve Denniston&#x27;s heritage and interpret it for the benefit of people visiting one of New Zealand&#x27;s most famous coalfield settlements. The growth of interest in Denniston has been aided by &quot;The Denniston Rose&quot;, a historical novel by Jenny Pattrick, set in the 1880s at Denniston.

===Future mining===
Coal is still mined on the Denniston Plateau, at a small scale, and to the north at the Stockton Mine near Millerton. In 2010, Bathurst Resources announced the Escarpment Mine Project to mine for coal on the Denniston Plateau, a move strongly opposed by environmentalists.

In March 2013 the Environment Court gave Bathurst the go-ahead, though groups such as Forest &amp; Bird vowed to continue fighting.

<text>The Wright R-1820 Cyclone 9 is an American radial engine developed by Curtiss-Wright, widely used on aircraft in the 1930s through 1950s. It was produced under license in France as the Hispano-Suiza 9V or Hispano-Wright 9V, and in the Soviet Union as the Shvetsov M-25.

==Design and development==
The R-1820 Cyclone 9 represented a further development of the Wright P-2 engine dating back to 1925. Featuring a greater displacement and a host of improvements, the R-1820 entered production in 1931. The engine remained in production well into the 1950s.

The R-1820 was built under license by Lycoming, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada, and also, during World War II, by the Studebaker Corporation. The Soviet Union had purchased a license for the design, and the Shvetsov &quot;OKB&quot; was formed to metricate the American specification powerplant for Soviet government-factory production as the &quot;M-25&quot;, with the R-1820&#x27;s general design features used by the Shvetsov design bureau for many of their future radials for the Soviet air forces through the 1940s and onwards. In Spain the R-1820 was license-built as the &quot;Hispano-Suiza 9V&quot; or &quot;Hispano-Wright 9V&quot;.

The R-1820 was at the heart of many famous aircraft including early Douglas airliners (the prototype DC-1, the DC-2, the first civil versions of the DC-3, and the limited-production DC-5), every wartime example of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Douglas SBD Dauntless bombers, the early versions of the Polikarpov I-16 fighter (as the M-25), and the Piasecki H-21 helicopter.

The R-1820 also found limited use in armored vehicles. The G-200 variant developed at 2,300 rpm and powered the strictly experimental M6 Heavy Tank.

===D-200 Diesel===
The Wright R-1820 was converted to a diesel during World War II by Caterpillar Inc. as the D-200 and produced at 2,000 rpm in the M4A6 Sherman.

==Variants==
Notes: Unit numbers ending with W indicate engine variants fitted with water-methanol emergency power boost systems.

===Hispano-Suiza 9V===
The Hispano-Suiza 9V is a licence-built version of the R-1820.

<doc id="1113479" wikidata="Q1277959" url="?curid=1113479" title="Satellite flare">
<text>Satellite flare, also known as satellite glint, is a satellite pass visible to the naked eye as a brief, bright &quot;flare&quot;. It is caused by the reflection toward the Earth below of sunlight incident on satellite surfaces such as solar panels and antennas (e.g., synthetic aperture radar). Streaks from satellite flare are a form of light pollution that can negatively affect ground-based astronomy, stargazing, and indigenous people.

Many satellites flare with magnitudes bright enough to see with the unaided eye, i.e. brighter than magnitude +6.5. Smaller magnitude numbers are brighter, so negative magnitudes are brighter than positive magnitudes, &quot;i.e.&quot; the scale is reverse logarithmic .

The Iridium constellation was one of the first anthropogenic sources of near-space light pollution to draw criticism. Larger satellite constellations, like OneWeb and Starlink, have received increased criticism. Scientific and policy analyses have raised questions about which regulatory bodies hold jurisdiction over human actions that obscure starlight in ways that affect astronomy, stargazers, and indigenous communities.

== Controlled satellites ==

The time and place of the satellite&#x27;s flare can be predicted only when the satellite is controlled, and its orientation in space is known. In this case it is possible to predict the exact time of the flare, its place in the sky, the brightness and duration.

The first generation of the Iridium constellation launched a total of 95 telecommunication satellites in low Earth orbit which were known to cause Iridium flares, the brightest flares of all orbiting satellites, starting in 1997. From 2017 to 2019 they were replaced with a new generation that does not produce flares, with the first generation completely deorbited by 27 December 2019.

While the first-generation Iridium satellites were still controlled, their flares could be predicted. These Iridium communication satellites had three polished door-sized antennas, 120° apart and at 40° angles with the main bus. The forward antenna faced the direction the satellite is traveling. Occasionally, an antenna reflects sunlight directly down at Earth, creating a predictable and quickly moving illuminated spot on the surface below of about diameter. To an observer this looks like a bright flash, or flare in the sky, with a duration of a few seconds.

Ranging up to −9.5 magnitude, some of the flares were so bright that they could be seen in the daytime. This flashing caused some annoyance to astronomers, as the flares occasionally disturbed observations.

As the Iridium constellation consisted of 66 working satellites, Iridium flares were visible quite often (2 to 4 times per night). Flares of brightness −5 magnitude occurred 3 to 4 times per week, and −8 magnitude were visible 3 to 5 times per month for stationary observers.

Flares could also occur from solar panels, but they were not as bright (up to −3.5 magnitude). Such flares lasted about twice as long as those from the main mission antennas (MMA), because the so-called &quot;mirror angle&quot; for the solar panels was twice that for the MMAs. There were also rare cases of flares from MMAs and solar panels, or two MMAs (front and either right or left) of one satellite in a single pass.

The flares were bright enough to be seen at night in big cities where light pollution usually prevents most stellar observation. When not flaring, the satellites were often visible crossing the night sky at a typical magnitude of 6, similar to a dim star.

=== Mega-constellations ===
Planned low-orbit satellite constellations such as Starlink are a concern for astronomers, stargazers, and indigenous communities because of light pollution.

In February 2020, the Russian Academy of Sciences said it would send a letter to the United Nations complaining that Starlink&#x27;s satellites will damage &quot;30-40% of astronomical images.&quot;

Numerous satellite operators have criticized SpaceX for attempting to overwhelm the FCC with paperwork as a means to gain approval to launch 42,000 satellites, which has raised questions about which aspects of space law pertain to light pollution from satellites.

SpaceX and Elon Musk have asserted in meetings with the National Academy of Sciences and in FCC filings that &quot;SpaceX is committed to reducing satellite brightness to allow enjoyment of the skies and not thwart scientific discovery&quot; and that its objectives are (1) to &quot;make the satellites generally invisible to the naked eye within a week of launch&quot;, and (2) to &quot;minimize Starlink&#x27;s impact on astronomy by darkening satellites so they do not saturate observatory detectors.&quot;

=== Other satellite flares ===


Many other controlled satellites also flare to magnitudes visible to the naked eye, i.e. larger than +6.5.

MetOp-B and C, however, can produce predictable flares up to −5 magnitude (MetOp-A in no longer controlled) . Four COSMO-SkyMed satellites can produce flares up to -3 magnitude, and lasting much longer than the Iridium flares.
The Terrasar X and Tandem X also can produce predictable flares up to -3 magnitude. 

The International Space Station (ISS) is known to cause bright ISS flares.

Starlink satellites can flare repeatedly in an isolated area of the sky, typically directly above the sun (below the horizon) as they transit the highest latitude of their orbits. This phenomenon is most obvious when satellites are low over the horizon, and is due to the large number of Starlink satellites that are orbiting the Earth, predominantly at ~53° orbital inclination.

The flares from Starlink have been misidentified as UFOs by airline pilots due to their unusual repetitive nature, which is visually analogous to a car&#x27;s headlights at night getting brighter (then dimmer) as it rounds a turn.

== Uncontrolled satellites ==

When a satellite goes out of control, it becomes possible to predict only a trajectory of its pass, while it becomes virtually impossible to accurately predict any flaring. These non-operational satellites are also described as &quot;tumbling&quot;. This category includes many rotating rocket bodies, some failed Iridium satellites, ALOS satellite (which can produce flashes up to −10 mag), etc.
The most important and valuable information about tumbling satellites is the period of flashes. It can vary from 0.5 seconds (rapidly rotating objects) to a minute or more (slowly rotating objects). Other important characteristics are the amplitude of changes in brightness and period of repetition of these changes.

== Observation ==
While satellites may be seen by chance, there are websites and mobile apps which provide location-specific information as to when and where in the sky a satellite flare may be seen (for controlled satellites), or trajectory of a tumbling satellite&#x27;s pass (for uncontrolled satellites) in the sky.

Reflections from satellites and other human space objects are sometimes reported as unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and are often a result of repetitive observations in an isolated area of the sky over a short time period.

<doc id="1113489" wikidata="Q1964385" url="?curid=1113489" title="Nanpō Islands">
<text>The is a collective term for the groups of islands that are located to the south of the Japanese archipelago. They extend from the Izu Peninsula west of Tokyo Bay southward for about , to within of the Mariana Islands. The Nanpō Islands are all administered by Tokyo Metropolis.

The Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department of the Japan Coast Guard defines the Nanpō Shotō as follows:

* Nanpō Shotō (Nanpō Islands)
** Izu Shotō (Izu Islands)
** Ogasawara Guntō (Bonin Islands)
*** [[Bonin Islands|Mukojima]] Rettō
*** [[Chichijima]] Rettō
*** [[Hahajima]] Rettō
** Kazan Rettō (Volcano Islands)
*** Kita Iwo Jima (North Iwo Jima)
*** [[Iwo Jima]]
*** Minami Iwo Jima (South Iwo Jima)
*** [[Nishinoshima (Ogasawara)|Nishinoshima]]
** [[Okinotorishima]]
** [[Minami-Tori-shima|Minamitorishima]]

The Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, a government agency that is responsible for standardization of place names, does not use the term Nanpō Shotō, although it has agreed with the Japan Coast Guard over the names and extents of the subgroups of the Nanpō Shotō.

The Japanese claim to have discovered the islands in 1593; however, many of the islands were known by the Spanish sailors that went from Philippines to New Spain since Bernardo de la Torre&#x27;s voyage in 1543, while the British claimed the islands in 1827. However, archeological evidence has since revealed that some of the islands were prehistorically inhabited by members of an unknown Micronesian ethnicity.

Neither Japan nor Britain developed the Nanpō Islands, although a small colony of Europeans and Americans was established at Chichi-jima. Japan began colonizing the islands in 1853, claimed them in 1861, then finally annexed them in 1891 as part of Tokyo Prefecture. By the mid-1930s the islands were closed to foreigners and a small Imperial Japanese Navy base was established at Chichi-jima.

<doc id="1113490" wikidata="Q3667591" url="?curid=1113490" title="Chicago 16">
<text>Chicago 16 is the thirteenth studio album by the American rock band Chicago, released on June 7, 1982. It is considered their &quot;comeback&quot; album because it was their first album to go platinum since 1978&#x27;s &quot;Hot Streets.&quot; It made it into the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 top ten, and produced their second number one single in the United States, &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in August, 1982, two months after its release, and platinum in December, 1982. &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

&quot;Chicago 16&quot; was the first album in a decade-long association with their new label Warner Bros. Records; the band&#x27;s first project to be produced by David Foster, who has been called the &quot;key&quot; to their comeback; their first album to include some songs exclusively by composers outside of the group; and is also the first album since &quot;Chicago VII&quot; (1974) not to feature Laudir de Oliveira as a band member. It is also the first studio album to be released two years after the previous, as previous studio albums were released annually.

==Background==
The band brought in Sons of Champlin founder Bill Champlin as keyboardist and singer. The group also retained Chris Pinnick from the &quot;Chicago XIV&quot; sessions. Through the band&#x27;s manager, Jeff Wald, and on suggestion of Danny Seraphine, producer David Foster would make contact with the band. Jeff Wald was dismissed as manager and the band enlisted Irving Azoff and Howard Kaufman as their new managers shortly thereafter.

Once they agreed to Foster producing the album (the band had considered him for 1980&#x27;s &quot;Chicago XIV&quot;), Foster radically redefined Chicago&#x27;s sound for the 1980s, with all of the latest technologies and techniques, and also brought in outside songwriters and studio players to the sessions. Three members of Toto lent their expertise to the sessions. In 2015 former Chicago drummer Danny Seraphine defended this choice to change their sound: 

The soft rock leanings of Peter Cetera and Foster permeate much of &quot;Chicago 16&quot;. The band was moving to a new label after an entire career at Columbia. Robert Lamm was also unavailable for the majority of the album&#x27;s production because of personal issues, and the once-prolific writer only shared a sole partial writing credit on the release, with no lead vocal contributions. Lamm said of this change: In an interview in 2019, Cetera described the initial songwriting efforts from band members that were presented to Foster as &quot;pure shit,&quot; blaming alcohol and drug abuse in the band for the decline in the quality of songwriting. Eventually, Foster and Cetera collaborated to write the album&#x27;s two hit singles.
Percussionist Laudir de Oliveira was dismissed from the band after the &quot;Chicago XIV&quot; tour, as his Latin-American style would not fit with the &quot;more pop-oriented sound&quot; of the band.

Upon its June 1982 release, &quot;Chicago 16&quot; was a hit album, especially as &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; became the band&#x27;s second number one US single, going to number one on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. The album ultimately went platinum and reached number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The single would also be included in its lengthier form &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry/Get Away&quot; on the &quot;Summer Lovers&quot; movie soundtrack. &quot;Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, the second single lifted off the album, features a lengthy orchestration at the end. It went to number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. A third single, &quot;What You&#x27;re Missing&quot;, was released and peaked at number 81 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

The Rhino remaster does not include the full-length versions of &quot;What You&#x27;re Missing&quot; and &quot;Love Me Tomorrow.&quot; The former was replaced with its single edit, and the latter had two bars of the sequence (prominently featuring strings) that begins the instrumental bridge removed. However, this remastered version does include a Bill Champlin demo, called &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Favorite Fool&quot;, as a bonus track. A subsequent international release in 2010 (included in the &quot;Studio Albums 1979-2008&quot; box set from 2015) has the original album restored, with additional bonus tracks of the single versions of &quot;Hard To Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;, &quot;What You&#x27;re Missing&quot;, and Love Me Tomorrow&quot; as well as &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Favorite Fool.&quot;

The original UK LP release contains &quot;Rescue You&quot; before &quot;What Can I Say,&quot; unlike subsequent releases of this album.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to poker:

[[Poker]] – family of card games that share betting rules and usually (but not always) hand rankings. Poker games differ in how the cards are dealt, how hands may be formed, whether the high or low hand wins the pot in a showdown (in some games, the pot is split between the high and low hands), limits on bet sizes, and how many rounds of betting are allowed.

== Nature of poker ==

Poker can be described as all of the following:

* Game – structured playing, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports/games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).
** Card game
* Sport – an organized, competitive, entertaining, and skillful activity requiring commitment, strategy, and fair play, in which a winner can be defined by objective means. It is governed by a set of rules or customs.
** Mind sport – a game where the outcome is determined

== Equipment of the game ==

<doc id="1113496" wikidata="Q773144" url="?curid=1113496" title="Sud Aviation Vautour">
<text>The Sud-Ouest Aviation (SNCASO) S.O. 4050 Vautour II (French for &quot;vulture&quot;) is a French jet-powered multirole aircraft. The Vautour served as a bomber, ground attack, reconnaissance and interceptor aircraft. 

Developed and manufactured by aircraft company Sud Aviation, the Vautour was operated by France&#x27;s &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;, having been originally designed in response to a requirement for a jet aircraft for bombing, low-level attack and all-weather interception. The Vautour was used in the Force de frappe under the Commandement des Forces Aériennes Stratégiques; each aircraft was suitable for the carriage of a nuclear weapon. The shortcomings of the type as a bomber, such as its lack of radar or other advanced navigation/attack systems, led to the type being replaced by the more capable Dassault Mirage IV. The Vautour never saw combat use with the French Air Force.

The only other customer for the Vautour was Israel. During its service with the Israeli Air Force (IAF), the type undertook various mission and roles and was quickly used in combat. Vautours were used during the wars between Israel and its neighbors, including the Six-Day War and the War of Attrition. Only one air-to-air kill was recorded by a Vautour; the type was used more for bombing and ground strafing and was reportedly considered by Israel to be comparable to the Soviet-built Ilyushin Il-28 medium bombers used by its regional adversaries. During the early 1970s, the Vautour was replaced by the American Douglas A-4 Skyhawk.

==Development==
===Origins===
In the aftermath of the Second World War, France set about the rebuilding and modernisation of its armed forces. In regards to aviation, this task had been made substantially more difficult due to setbacks incurred by the German occupation of France during the conflict; nearly all aircraft factories had been destroyed while individual design teams had scattered, meaning that there was little to no continuity of work and that the nation would be basically starting from scratch. Additionally, France had little technical knowledge or operational know-how with the newly developed field of jet propulsion in comparison to other powers, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. A major step towards bridging this gap was a licensing arrangement between Hispano-Suiza and British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce Limited, under which the former would manufacture the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine; accordingly, the majority of early French jet aircraft were powered by the Nene while an indigenous engine was to be developed in the form of the Snecma Atar engine.

During June 1951, the French &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; (AdA) issued a detailed requirement for a jet-powered aircraft capable of functioning in several roles, including as a bomber, a low-level attack aircraft, or an all-weather interceptor. In response to this requirement, French aircraft manufacturer SNCASO decided to adapt its existing &quot;S.O. 4000&quot; design so that it could perform the desired missions roles. During 1951, test flight of the S.O.4000 prototype had demonstrated promising performance for the type, supporting the decision to proceed with a further development of the design. According to aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, &quot;It would be fair to claim that in the early 1950s the Vautour was the most promising twin-jet warplane in Western Europe&quot;. An initial order for three prototypes was placed by the AdA. On 16 October 1952, the first prototype of the revised design, which had been designated as the &quot;S.O. 4050&quot;, conducted its maiden flight.

The flight test programme proceeded relatively smoothly; during one early flight, a prototype was recorded as having exceeded Mach 1 during a shallow dive. A follow-on order for six pre-production aircraft was soon received; one of these was powered by a pair of Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire engines while another was furnished with Rolls-Royce Avon engines, both British designs, while the remainder were powered by the French Atar engine. Subsequent production aircraft would use the Atar engine, having proven to be sufficiently mature and, with the aid of water injection, capable of sufficient power to enable the Vautour to take off while carrying a full payload.

===Production and further development===
 &quot;Vautour II&quot;, the aircraft was manufactured in three distinct variants. During 1958, the aircraft entered service with the AdA; the Vautour would remain in use by the AdA for several decades. While the final French aircraft being retired from frontline service during 1979, a number were retained and soldiered on in various secondary duties into the early 1980s. The Vautour ultimately saw no combat usage during its service with the AdA; throughout the majority of its service life, the type was maligned as obsolete and relatively underpowered. Although it had been a moderately competent aircraft when it had been originally developed, the Vautour never benefitted from the adoption of sufficiently powerful engines, even though suitable powerplants did become available over time. As an interceptor, it was soon outclassed by the newer Dassault Mirage III, while in its roles either as a bomber or attack aircraft, the lack of an advanced navigation/attack system became a crippling limitation upon its effectiveness.

The only export customer for the Vautour was Israel, who had chosen to procure a number of other types of combat aircraft from France as well. During the 1950s, France and Israel closely cooperated on various areas of defence, including armaments, aviation, and nuclear research. According to author Sylvia K. Crosbie, a major motivating factor in the Israeli decision to procure the Vautour was to make a political statement to the country&#x27;s neighbours, viewing the aircraft as a counterpart, and a response, to the Soviet-built Ilyushin Il-28 medium bombers, which had been acquired by Egypt.

During 1956, two years prior to the Vautour even entering squadron service, France had issued a more demanding requirement for a supersonic replacement aircraft. The Vautour was used as a stop-gap measure as the airborne carrier of France&#x27;s independent nuclear deterrent while the more capable follow-on aircraft was being selected and developed; its performance in this role was typically thought to be limited at best. While the newer bomber requirement would ultimately result in the selection, development and manufacture of the Dassault Mirage IV bomber; Sud Aviation had also chosen to respond to the requirement, producing their own proposal for the production of an envisioned &quot;Super Vautour&quot;. According to aviation author Bill Gunston, the unbuilt &#x27;stretched&#x27; Super Vautour variant would have featured an increased combat radius of 1,700 miles as well as the ability to attain at least Mach 0.9.

==Design==
The Sud Aviation Vautour was a jet-propelled mid-sized combat aircraft, typically employed as a bomber and attack aircraft, as well as having some usage as an interceptor. In terms of its basic configuration, it had a shoulder-wing monoplane configuration, furnished with a 35° swept wing and a &quot;flying&quot; tail. Power was provided by a pair of SNECMA Atar 101 turbojet engines, which were carried in pods located underneath the wings. The Vautour was equipped with a bicycle-type landing gear configuration in which the main units were located upon the underside of the fore and aft fuselage, these were augmented by smaller stabilizing gear set into bottom of the engine pods. The internal space of the central fuselage was largely dedicated to a large 5.0 meter (16 ft 5 in) weapons bay, along with substantial internal fuel tankage.

The Vautour IIB bomber lacked any sort of radar arrangement or many of the contemporary navigational aids and attack systems that were installed upon several aircraft performing the same role during this era. Aiming of the armaments was performed by a bombardier, who would principally perform his bomb-aiming function using a Second World War-vintage American-built Norden bombsight. The navigator/bombardier position was within the nose section, which was glazed to provide external visibility. Both the Vautour IIB and IIA models were restricted to performing missions only under clear-weather operations during daylight. The Vautour IIN interceptor model was not as restrictive, having some capacity to conduct both nighttime and adverse weather operations, having been furnished with a radar system. During its service in Israel, where the weather of the local climate was generally favorable and daylight missions commonplace, the Vautour&#x27;s lack of advanced targeting and navigation equipment was found to be not a crippling limitation. However, when operated in Europe, these restrictions were considered to be a major disadvantage. As a result, the French AdA never deployed their single-seat Vautour IIA fleet in a frontline capacity; the majority of its IIB bombers were quickly converted to the improved Vautour IIBR standard, which was used to perform photo reconnaissance missions instead.

The Vautour was capable of being equipped with various armaments. In Israeli service, it was typically armed with a pair of 30 mm cannons, as well as up to four removable underwing rocket pods, containing up to 19 air-to-ground rockets each; up to 3,000lb of bombs or alternatively a maximum of 232 68 mm rockets could be accommodated internally in the bomb bay. 4,000lb of bombs could also be mounted externally. The Vautour IIB bomber could be used to carry and deploy nuclear weapons in addition to its conventional arsenal. The internal bomb bay of a single aircraft could contain either one AN-11 or one AN-22 nuclear bomb; however, in AdA service, the primary carrier of nuclear weapons would quickly be transitioned to the newer and more capable Dassault Mirage IV, which supplemented and eventually replace the Vautour IIB bomber.

==Operational history==
Originally, the AdA had intended to order a total of 440 Vautours, comprising 300 of the IIA model and 140 of the IIN variant. However, plans were modified; ultimately no Vautour IIAs would enter AdA service and around 30 were believed to be constructed, 18 of which being sold to Israel at a relatively low price. In place of the IIA, the Vautour IIB was procured instead, which was suitable for performing level bombing runs across all altitudes, as well as the low altitude toss bombing attack profile. To address a deficiency of the Vautour that had been determined mid-service life, this being its limited range in comparison to contemporary strategic bombers, considerable emphasis was placed upon the introduction and perfection of aerial refueling techniques in the AdA. This led to the adoption of a &#x27;buddy pack&#x27; to enable pairs of Vautours to refuel one another in mid-air, allowing for the range factor to be better addressed.

A fleet of 40 AdA-operated Vautour IIBs constituted the original air-based component of the French force de frappe, the Commandement des Forces Aériennes Stratégiques (CFAS) of the French Air Force, which had been established during 1955. However, their use in the strategic bomber role was determined to be less than optimal; allegedly, the Vautour&#x27;s performance was commonly considered to be marginal and suitable for use as a stop gap measure at best. The deficiencies of the type contributed to France issuing a more stringent requirement calling for a new high performance bomber aircraft to be developed to perform the strategic mission. While efforts were made by Sud Aviation to design improved variants of the Vautour to conform with the new demands, the AdA opted to pursue rival aircraft company Dassault Aviation&#x27;s proposal, which eventually resulted in the deployment of the Mirage IV, which eventually succeeded the Vautour in the bombing role in French service.

As early as 1955, preliminary agreements for Israel&#x27;s procurement of the Vautour were being drawn up and advanced plans being laid for its deployment. During early 1957, the type was officially selected to replace the British-built de Havilland Mosquito then in service with the Israeli Air Force (IAF). On 1 August 1957, the first Vautour arrived in Israel, delivered secretly via French air bases in Tunisia and with AdA markings. The planes were delivered at a rate of 1 or 2 per month. Their entry into service had allegedly been delayed by several months due to political issues between Israel and France, which was resolved when permission to commence operations was granted by the latter. Deliveries of the type were completed in 1958. During August 1958, the existence of Israeli Vautours was publicly revealed in an air display.

Crosbie described the Vautour as being &quot;Israel&#x27;s most important delivery system at the time&quot;, also observing the type to possess the capability to launch attacks upon the majority of Egyptian targets while carrying a payload of 6,000-8,000lb bombs. The IAF fielded a pair of squadrons equipped with the type. In Israeli service, the Vautour was used to perform many different roles, the IIN variant were initially tasked with night fighter operations, before transitioning to the attack role or being converted to perform aerial reconnaissance or electronic warfare operations. The Vautour proved to be quite capable as a reconnaissance aircraft; on 23 January 1962, one overflew right across Egypt to the Libyan border, evading repeated attempts at interception; during the following years, the type was used to gather evidence of Soviet-provided surface to air missiles (SAM)s present in Egypt. Likewise, in the electronic warfare mission, the aircraft proved effective at disabling Egyptian air defenses via onboard jamming equipment.

In Israeli service, the Vautour had a relatively active combat career. As early as 1959, the type was being used against Egyptian targets; the Vautour would also participate in a series of actions throughout major conflicts between Israel and its neighbours, including the Six-Day War and the War of Attrition. Israeli Vautours were normally used to conduct bombing and strafing runs, along with several air-to-air engagements. During the Six-Day War, Israeli Vautours engaged in air-to-air combat with Iraqi Air Force aircraft while in the process of performing raiding missions against H-3 airfield in Iraq&#x27;s western region. On 6 June 1967, Captain Ben-Zion Zohar scored the type&#x27;s only aerial victory, having downed an Iraqi Hawker Hunter during one such engagement, although this did not mean the aircraft had a clear advantage over the latter, emphasized by a pair of Vautours being downed after being struck by cannon fire from Iraqi Hunters on the following day. Overall, a total of 15 Vautours were recorded as lost in combat. Remaining examples of the type were retired during 1971 in favor of the American-built Douglas A-4 Skyhawk; the last aircraft left operational service during March 1972, their final role being decoy aircraft flown in the vicinity of the Sinai. The Israelis were pleased with the Vautour&#x27;s range and versatility, and it was well regarded in Israeli service.

==Variants==

* S.O. 4050-01 : Two-seat all-weather fighter prototype, powered by two 23.5-kN (5,291-lb) Atar 101B turbojet engines. First flew on 16 October 1952. One built.
* S.O. 4050-02 : Single-seat ground-attack prototype, powered by two 27.6-kN (6,217-lb) Atar 101D turbojet engines. First flew on 16 December 1953. One built.
* S.O. 4050-03 : Two-seat bomber prototype, powered by two Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet engines. First flew on 5 December 1954. One built.

The Vautour was produced in three principal variants, which had 90% commonality:
* IIA: Single-seat, long-range attack aircraft, armed with cannon and bombs (carried internally or on four underwing pylons)
* IIN: Two-seat, all-weather interceptor with DRAC-25AI or DRAC-32AI radar in nose, pilot and co-pilot in tandem seats, armed with cannon, air-to-air missiles, and (theoretically) unguided rockets. The designation was later changed to II-1N.
* IIB: Two-seat bomber with glazed nose position for bombardier/observer replacing cannon pack, carrying bombs internally and on underwing pylons.
Some IIB aircraft were converted to various specialized roles, principally reconnaissance (IIBR and IIBN), electronic countermeasures, and eventually target tug (IIB-TT).

<text>Spectrum are an Australian progressive rock band which formed in April 1969 and broke up in April 1973. The original line-up was Mark Kennedy on drums, Lee Neale on organ (ex-Nineteen87), Bill Putt on bass guitar (ex-Lost Souls), and Mike Rudd on guitar and lead vocals (ex-Chants R&amp;B, The Party Machine). In August 1970 Kennedy was replaced by Ray Arnott on drums. These members also performed under the alter ego, Indelible Murtceps, from 1971 to 1973. Spectrum had a number-one hit, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Gone&quot; (January 1971), on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; National Top 60 singles chart. After Spectrum and Indelible Murtceps disbanded, Putt and Rudd formed Ariel. In 1999 the pair formed Spectrum Plays the Blues, which later trimmed their name back to Spectrum. On 7 August 2013 Bill Putt died, after a heart attack.

==History==
===1969–1971: Early years ===

Spectrum were formed in April 1969 in Melbourne, as a progressive rock group, by Mark Kennedy on drums (ex-Gallery), Lee Neale on organ (ex-Nineteen87), Bill Putt on bass guitar (ex-Gallery, The Lost Souls), and Mike Rudd on guitar, harmonica and lead vocals (ex-Chants R&amp;B, The Party Machine, Sons of the Vegetal Mother). Initially the group drew on the work of contemporary bands such as Traffic, Soft Machine and Pink Floyd; they played cover versions of their material. Spectrum developed their own style as Rudd began writing original material. Alongside Kennedy&#x27;s drum solos, Putt&#x27;s bass playing and Neale&#x27;s keyboard work, a feature of Spectrum&#x27;s sound was Rudd&#x27;s guitar playing — he eschewed the near-universal use of guitar picks – using a finger-picking style on a vintage Fender Stratocaster to develop a characteristic sound.

During twelve months of regularly performing on the local dance and discothèque circuit, Spectrum refined their original material. They appeared at various &quot;head&quot; (see cannabis slang) venues around Melbourne: T.F. Much Ballroom, Garrison and Sebastian&#x27;s, alongside other progressive rockers, Tully, Tamam Shud and Sons of the Vegetal Mother. Spectrum used an elaborate set-up which included a large PA and a full multi-media light show; often supplemented by a performance troupe, Tribe. Early in 1970 they cut a demo single which they hawked to record companies as a 7&quot; acetate. One side was an early, folk version of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Gone&quot;. The B-side was another original, &quot;You Just Can&#x27;t Win&quot;. According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, these acetates are now &quot;impossibly rare&quot; and only two or three copies are known to have survived.

Despite a loyal following and praise from the music press – including from Australia&#x27;s pop newspaper &quot;Go-Set&quot; – the band were almost broke by mid-1970. After they signed to EMI under their progressive rock imprint, Harvest Records, the band went into the studio in August 1970 to make their first official recordings, using producer, Howard Gable (The Masters Apprentices). Rudd described the recording sessions, &quot;[we had] gone into the studio in order to record &#x27;Launching Place Parts I &amp; II&#x27;, to help promote the Launching Place Festival. When we had finished recording those, Howard asked us did we have any others and I said, &#x27;Yeah, I&#x27;ve got this one called &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Gone&quot;&#x27;, which we recorded as an afterthought. But then it became a hit single.&quot; Rudd had decided to add a harmonica part to the song.

The festival at Launching Place occurred in December 1970. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Gone&quot; was released in January 1971, which became a surprise No. 1 Australian hit on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; National Top 60 singles chart in May that year. It became one of the most enduring Australian rock songs of that era. McFarlane described it as a &quot;shuffling, hypnotic&quot; track, for which &quot;suddenly the band was in big demand.&quot;

===1971–1973: Albums and Indelible Murtceps ===
Spectrum released their debut studio album, &quot;Spectrum Part One&quot;, in March 1971, although it did not include the hit single. Rudd had refused to add it as &quot;It didn&#x27;t fit with the innovative roaming style of the rest of the music.&quot; The album reached No. 10 in April. Kennedy had left in August of the previous year just after it was recorded, he had &quot;lost patience&quot; as the group &quot;struggled for gigs (promoters found them &#x27;too progressive&#x27;).&quot; He was replaced on drums and vocals by Ray Arnott (ex-Chelsea Set, Cam-Pact, Company Caine). Rudd praised Kennedy&#x27;s musicianship: &quot;Mark really carried us through the first year because people would say &#x27;Wow, look at that drummer, they must be a good group&#x27;... He used to play things like drum solos!, but he was very good. By the same token, I was almost relieved to get away from that &#x27;cause the emphasis swung back to the material and the band in general rather than one player.&quot; Kennedy later worked with Leo de Castro, Ayers Rock and then Marcia Hines.

Spectrum&#x27;s follow up singles, &quot;Trust Me&quot; (June 1971) and &quot;But That&#x27;s Alright&quot; (November), did not reach the top 60. During October that year Spectrum formed a side project, Indelible Murtceps, using the same line-up of Arnott on drums, Neale on electric piano, Putt on bass guitar and Rudd on vocals and guitar. They performed at pubs, and local dances, playing a more dance/pop-oriented repertoire and using a simpler set-up than when performing as Spectrum.

Their second album, &quot;Milesago&quot;, was released in December 1971, as the first Australian rock music double album. It is also the first Australian rock album to be recorded using a 16-track recorder – newly installed – at Armstrong Studios during the previous September. McFarlane stated that it &quot;remains one of the landmark releases of the Australian progressive rock era.&quot; It peaked at No. 9 on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; Top 20 Albums chart. By September 1972 Neale had left both bands; he was replaced by John Mills on keyboards. Neale quit the music scene permanently after leaving Spectrum and Indelible Murtceps.

Spectrum&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Testimonial&quot;, was co-credited to Indelible Murtceps. It appeared in July 1973, which reached No. 12. In March, before its release, Arnott announced he was going to join Mighty Kong. Putt and Rudd decided to end both bands; each played their farewell gig at the Dallas Brooks Hall in Melbourne on 15 April 1973. It was recorded and released in December 1973 as a double live album, &quot;Terminal Buzz&quot;. Both of these releases were produced by Peter Dawkins.

Spectrum had toured other Australian rock festivals, including, Wallacia (January 1971), Myponga (February), Sunbury (January 1972, January 1973), Mulwala (April 1972), and Rosebud. Their national profile was limited by a lack of radio airplay in other capitals and, other than festivals, they rarely toured outside Victoria. Ian McFarlane opined that the group were &quot;one of the first underground bands of the early 1970s to gain mainstream acceptance. [Their] brand of progressive rock was often built around long, complex musical passages, very much in the vein of UK bands... Yet the band did embrace a commercial aesthetic at times.&quot;

===1973–1999:After disbanding and reunions ===
Following the disbandment of Spectrum and Indelible Murtceps, Rudd, Putt and Mills formed Ariel in mid-1973. The other members were Tim Gaze on guitar and Nigel Macara on drums (both ex-Tamam Shud). After Ariel disbanded in 1977, Rudd and Putt continued their musical collaborations in a series of groups: Instant Replay, Mike Rudd and the Heaters, W.H.Y., No. 9 and The Burwood Blues Band. After Mighty Kong disbanded at the end of 1973, Ray Arnott was a member of The Dingoes (1974–76), Ray Arnott Band (1978–80), Cold Chisel 1983–84) and Jimmy Barnes Band (1984–85).

EMI issued a compilation album, &quot;Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet&quot;, early in 1984 and during March that year Spectrum undertook a reunion tour with the line-up of Arnott, Putt, and Rudd joined by Tony Fossey on keyboards (ex-Mike Rudd and the Heaters). Subsequent reformations occurred: in 1989 with Fossey, Putt and Rudd joined by Martyn Sullivan on guitar and bass guitar; and David Hicks on drums. In the following year Hicks was replaced by Trevor Courtney on drums. The 1991 line-up of Courtney, Putt, Rudd, Sullivan, with Cres Crisp on keyboards performed as Spectrum Plays the Blues. During the early 1990s Putt and Rudd worked as an acoustic duo with various guest musicians. From 1995 they continued &quot;to perform under a variety of names, to suit different situations and line-ups, but predominantly still call themselves Spectrum.&quot;

===1999–current: Spectrum Plays the Blues &amp; &quot;Breathing Space&quot;===

By 1999 Putt and Rudd had formed another band together, Spectrum Plays the Blues, which included Spectrum material in their set list. They issued two albums, &quot;Spill&quot; (March 1999) and &quot;No Thinking&quot; (June 2004); before they trimmed the name back to Spectrum. In May 2008 the first new recording under that name, &quot;Breathing Space&quot;, was released as a six-track EP on the band&#x27;s own label, Volcano Records. The EP features guest musicians, including Gaze.

In 2004, TISM sampled &quot;Launching Place, Part II&quot; in their song &quot;As Seen on Reality&quot;, which appeared on their album &quot;The White Albun&quot; that year.

Aztec Music reissued &quot;Milesago&quot; on CD for the first time, with extra tracks. The label then reissued &quot;Spectrum Part One&quot; in 2007, with its bonus tracks titled &quot;Spectrum Part Two&quot;. A second EP, &quot;Breathing Space Too&quot;, was released on Volcano in 2009, and a third EP, &quot;Breathing Space As Well&quot;, followed in 2011. Spectrum played in either three- or four-piece mode. Spectrum&#x27;s bass guitarist Bill Putt died of a heart attack on 7 August 2013. Rudd continued Spectrum with Dirk Dubois very briefly then Broc O&#x27;Connor on bass guitar, Daryl Roberts on keyboards and Peter &#x27;Robbo&#x27; Robertson on drums and percussion. Spectrum&#x27;s keyboardist Lee Neale died on 31 March 2019.

<text>Wright Cyclone was the name given to a family of air-cooled radial piston engines designed by the Wright Aeronautical Corporation and used in numerous American aircraft in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.

==Background==
The Wright Aeronautical Corporation was formed in 1919, initially to develop liquid-cooled Hispano-Suiza V8 engines under license. In 1923 the Wright purchased the Lawrance Aero Engine Company, and with the purchase Charles Lawrance came to Wright as the Vice-President. Later that year the US Navy awarded Wright a contract to develop two new air-cooled radial engines. The first, called the P-1, was a 9-cylinder single row design of displacement that was derived from an earlier Lawrence design, it produced . The second, the P-2, had the same displacement as the P-1, but was an improved design that produced . Neither engine entered production, with the Navy selecting the superior Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340 Wasp, so in 1926 work started on the improved design, which became the R-1750 Cyclone.

<doc id="1113514" wikidata="Q416095" url="?curid=1113514" title="MyoD">
<text>MyoD, also known as myoblast determination protein 1, is a protein in animals that plays a major role in regulating muscle differentiation. MyoD, which was discovered in the laboratory of Harold M. Weintraub, belongs to a family of proteins known as myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs). These bHLH (basic helix loop helix) transcription factors act sequentially in myogenic differentiation. Vertebrate MRF family members include MyoD1, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4 (Myf6). In non-vertebrate animals, a single MyoD protein is typically found.

MyoD is one of the earliest markers of myogenic commitment. MyoD is expressed at extremely low and essentially undetectable levels in quiescent satellite cells, but expression of MyoD is activated in response to exercise or muscle tissue damage. The effect of MyoD on satellite cells is dose-dependent; high MyoD expression represses cell renewal, promotes terminal differentiation and can induce apoptosis. Although MyoD marks myoblast commitment, muscle development is not dramatically ablated in mouse mutants lacking the MyoD gene. This is likely due to functional redundancy from Myf5 and/or Mrf4. Nevertheless, the combination of MyoD and Myf5 is vital to the success of myogenesis.

==History==
MyoD was cloned by a functional assay for muscle formation reported in Cell in 1987 by Davis, Weintraub, and Lassar. It was first described as a nuclear phosphoprotein in 1988 by Tapscott, Davis, Thayer, Cheng, Weintraub, and Lassar in Science. The researchers expressed the complementary DNA (cDNA) of the murine MyoD protein in a different cell lines (fibroblast and adipoblast) and found MyoD converted them to myogenic cells. The following year, the same research team performed several tests to determine both the structure and function of the protein, confirming their initial proposal that the active site of the protein consisted of the helix loop helix (now referred to as basic helix loop helix) for dimerization and a basic site upstream of this bHLH region facilitated DNA binding only once it became a protein dimer. MyoD has since been an active area of research as still relatively little is known concerning many aspects of its function.

== Function ==
The function of MyoD in development is to commit mesoderm cells to a skeletal myoblast lineage, and then to regulate that continued state. MyoD may also regulate muscle repair. MyoD mRNA levels are also reported to be elevated in aging skeletal muscle.

One of the main actions of MyoD is to remove cells from the cell cycle (halt proliferation for terminal cell cycle arrest in differentiated myocytes) by enhancing the transcription of p21 and myogenin. MyoD is inhibited by cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). CDKs are in turn inhibited by p21. Thus MyoD enhances its own activity in the cell in a feedforward manner.

Sustained MyoD expression is necessary for retaining the expression of muscle-related genes.

MyoD is also an important effector for the fast-twitch muscle fiber (types IIA, IIX, and IIB) phenotype.

==Mechanisms==
MyoD is a transcription factor and can also direct chromatin remodelling through binding to a DNA motif known as the E-box. MyoD is known to have binding interactions with hundreds of muscular gene promoters and to permit myoblast proliferation. While not completely understood, MyoD is now thought to function as a major myogenesis controller in an on/off switch association mediated by KAP1 (KRAB [Krüppel-like associated box]-associated protein 1) phosphorylation. KAP1 is localized at muscle-related genes in myoblasts along with both MyoD and Mef2 (a myocyte transcription enhancer factor). Here, it serves as a scaffold and recruits the coactivators p300 and LSD1, in addition to several corepressors which include G9a and the Histone deacetylase HDAC1. The consequence of this coactivator/corepressor recruitment is silenced promoting regions on muscle genes. When the kinase MSK1 phosphorylates KAP1, the corepressors previously bound to the scaffold are released allowing MyoD and Mef2 to activate transcription.

Once the &quot;master controller&quot; MyoD has become active, SETDB1 is required to maintain MyoD expression within the cell. Setdb1 appears to be necessary to maintain both MyoD expression and also genes that are specific to muscle tissues because reduction of Setdb1 expression results in a severe delay of myoblast differentiation and determination. In Setdb1 depleted myoblasts that are treated with exogenous MyoD, myoblastic differentiation is successfully restored. In one model of Setdb1 action on MyoD, Setdb1 represses an inhibitor of MyoD. This unidentified inhibitor likely acts competitively against MyoD during typical cellular proliferation. Evidence for this model is that reduction of Setdb1 results in direct inhibition of myoblast differentiation which may be caused by the release of the unknown MyoD inhibitor.

MyoD has also been shown to function cooperatively with the tumor suppressor gene, Retinoblastoma (pRb) to cause cell cycle arrest in the terminally differentiated myoblasts. This is done through regulation of the Cyclin, Cyclin D1. Cell cycle arrest (in which myoblasts would indicate the conclusion of myogenesis) is dependent on the continuous and stable repression of the D1 cyclin. Both MyoD and pRb are necessary for the repression of cyclin D1, but rather than acting directly on cyclin D1, they act on Fra-1 which is immediately early of cyclin D1. MyoD and pRb are both necessary for repressing Fra-1 (and thus cyclin D1) as either MyoD or pRb on its own is not sufficient alone to induce cyclin D1 repression and thus cell cycle arrest. In an intronic enhancer of Fra-1 there were two conserved MyoD binding sites discovered. There is cooperative action of MyoD and pRb at the Fra-1 intronic enhancer that suppresses the enhancer, therefore suppressing cyclin D1 and ultimately resulting in cell cycle arrest for terminally differentiated myoblasts.

==Wnt signalling can affect MyoD==

Wnt signalling from adjacent tissues has been shown to induce cells in somites that receive these Wnt signals to express Pax3 and Pax7 in addition to myogenic regulatory factors, including Myf5 and MyoD. Specifically, Wnt3a can directly induce MyoD expression via cis-element interactions with a distal enhancer and Wnt response element. Wnt1 from dorsal neural tube and Wnt6/Wnt7a from surface ectoderm have also been implicated in promoting myogenesis in the somite; the latter signals may act primarily through Myod.

In typical adult muscles in a resting condition (absence of physiological stress) the specific Wnt family proteins that are expressed are Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Wnt7a and Wnt4. When a muscle becomes injured (thus requiring regeneration) Wnt5a, Wnt5b, and Wnt7a are increased in expression. As the muscle completes repair Wnt7b and Wnt3a are increased as well. This patterning of Wnt signalling expression in muscle cell repair induces the differentiation of the progenitor cells, which reduces the number of available satellite cells. Wnt plays a crucial role in satellite cell regulation and skeletal muscle aging and also regeneration. Wnts are known to active the expression of Myf5 and MyoD by Wnt1 and Wnt7a. Wnt4, Wnt5, and Wnt6 function to increase the expression of both of the regulatory factors but at a more subtle level. Additionally, MyoD increases Wnt3a when myoblasts undergo differentiation. Whether MyoD is activated by Wnt via cis-regulation direct targeting or through indirect physiological pathways remains to be elucidated.

== Coactivators and repressors ==
IFRD1 is a positive cofactor of MyoD, as it cooperates with MyoD at inducing the transcriptional activity of MEF2C (by displacing HDAC4 from MEF2C); moreover IFRD1 also represses the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, which is known to inhibit MyoD mRNA accumulation.
NFATc1 is a transcription factor that regulates composition of fiber type and the fast-to-slow twitch transition resulting from aerobic exercise requires the expression of NFATc1. MyoD expression is a key transcription factor in fast twitch fibers which is inhibited by NFATc1 in oxidative fiber types. NFATc1 works to inhibit MyoD via a physical interaction with the MyoD N-terminal activation domain resulting in inhibited recruitment of the necessary transcriptional coactivator p300. NFATc1 physically disrupts the interaction between MyoD and p300. This establishes the molecular mechanism by which fiber types transition in vivo through exercise with opposing roles for NFATc1 and MyoD. NFATc1 controls this balance by physical inhibition of MyoD in slow-twitch muscle fiber types.

The histone deacetyltransferase p300 functions with MyoD in an interaction that is essential for the myotube generation from fibroblasts that is mediated by MyoD. Recruitment of p300 is the rate-limiting process in the conversion of fibroblasts to myotubes. In addition to p300, MyoD is also known to recruit Set7, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and RNAP II to the enhancer that is bound with and this allows for the activation of muscle gene that is condition-specific and established by MyoD recruitment. Endogenous p300 though, is necessary for MyoD functioning by acting as an essential coactivator.
MyoD associatively binds to the enhancer region in conjunction with a placeholding &quot;putative pioneer factor&quot; which helps to establish and maintain a both of them in a specific and inactive conformation. Upon the removal or inactivation on the placeholder protein bound to the enhancer, the recruitment of the additional group of transcription factors that help to positively regulate enhancer activity is permitted and this results in the MyoD-transcription factor-enhancer complex to assume a transcriptionally active state.

<doc id="1113519" wikidata="Q6905748" url="?curid=1113519" title="Montgomery M. Taylor">
<text>Montgomery Meigs Taylor (13 October 1869 – 21 October 1952) was an admiral in the United States Navy. He served in the Navy from 1890 to 1933, fought in the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War in 1898, and later commanded the Control Fleet and the Scouting Fleet. He served as commander-in-chief of the United States Asiatic Fleet from 1931 to 1933.

==Early life==
Taylor was born on October 13, 1869, in Washington, D.C., to Joseph Hancock and Mary Meigs Taylor. He was born in the house of his grandfather, Montgomery C. Meigs, Quartermaster General of the United States Army during the American Civil War, for whom he was also named. His grand-uncle was President Zachary Taylor. His brother was John R. M. Taylor, an officer in the United States Army during the Philippine–American War.

Taylor grew up in Washington, D.C., where he attended public school.

==Naval career==
===Early assignments===

Taylor was appointed in 1886 to the United States Naval Academy, where he was an outstanding halfback on the first football team the school fielded. He graduated in 1890, and was to have trained aboard the armed steamer , but she was wrecked before he could join her. He spent the next two years aboard the screw sloop , the screw sloop , and finally the protected cruiser . He was appointed an ensign in 1892, and his first assignment was aboard the protected cruiser . He also served short stints aboard the screw sloops and and the steamer .

Taylor was next assigned to the gunboat . He traveled to Shanghai, China, via commercial steamer and joined the ship in the summer of 1900. &quot;Yorktown&quot; was ordered back to the United States on 10 September 1900. Taylor disembarked at Nagasaki, Japan, and joined the protected cruiser , Admiral George Dewey&#x27;s flagship, in September 1897.

During the Spanish–American War of 1898, Taylor served as a battery commander aboard &quot;Olympia&quot; and took part in the Battle of Manila Bay on 1 May 1898. Taylor received a promotion to lieutenant after &quot;Olympia&quot; returned to the United States in 1899.

Taylor was assigned to the full-rigged ship USS &quot;Chesapeake&quot; in November 1899 for the ship&#x27;s sea trials, but after a month was ordered to leave the ship and proceed to Washington, D.C., for coursework in modern armament. In February 1900, he successfully applied for sea duty in the Pacific. Over the next few years, Taylor served on several ships:

* Commanding officer, from March 1900 to 1902 during the Philippine–American War.
* Commanding officer, gunboat , from 1903 to 1905.
* Commanding officer, tender 
* Commanding officer, 2nd Torpedo Flotilla, United States Atlantic Fleet, from 1905 to 1906.
* Commanding officer, receiving ship , from 1906 to 1908.
* Executive officer, scout cruiser , from 1908 to 1909.
* Executive officer, protected cruiser , from 1909 to 1910.
* Commanding officer, gunboat , from 1910 to 1911.

Talor was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 July 1905 and to commander on 4 March 1911.

===Rise in the ranks===

After 21 years at sea, Taylor received his first land assignment. He was appointed aide to the commandant of the Brooklyn Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, in 1911, and served there until 1913. He was given command of the auxiliary cruiser in 1913, serving until 1915. &quot;Buffalo&quot; cruised through the Caribbean Sea and along the west coast of Central America before being ordered to Alaska. While in port at Kodiak, Alaska, Taylor learned that World War I had broken out in Europe in 1914.

From 1915 to 1916, Taylor attended the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, with orders to report to the armored cruiser to serve as her commanding officer in the event of a national emergency. After graduating in 1916, he was promoted to captain on 16 August 1916 and given command of the battleship .

After the United States entered World War I in 1917, Taylor was assigned duties in the Office of Naval Operations at the United States Department of the Navy. He took command of the battleship in 1918. &quot;Florida&quot; operated in cooperation with the British Grand Fleet during the war, and Taylor received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for this service.

Taylor was assigned to the staff of the Naval War College from 1919 to 1921. In June 1922 he became commander of the 15th Naval District and of the Naval Operating Base at Coco Solo in the Panama Canal Zone.

Taylor returned to the United States in 1923 and was appointed a member of the Naval Examining and Retiring Board in the Department of the Navy. In June 1923, he was appointed commander of the Control Fleet, a unit consisting of submarines, destroyers, and Marine Corps units designed to control sea lanes after they had been cleared of enemy forces by the Navy Battle Fleet.

===Admiralty===
Taylor was promoted to rear admiral on 1 October 1922. He was director of fleet training from 1925 to 1927, and afterward commanded the 3rd Battleship Division of the Battle Fleet, with the battleship as his flagship. During fleet exercises in August 1927, he received an informal reprimand from his superior, Admiral Henry A. Wiley, (Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet), for launching planes from aircraft carriers after confronting an enemy rather than using his ships&#x27; superior speed to escape. In September 1927, Taylor made Joseph J. Clark (later an admiral himself who played a significant role in the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944) his division chief of staff.

Taylor was given command of the Scouting Fleet on 30 March 1926. The Scouting Fleet, based in the Atlantic Ocean, was an operational step down for Taylor. Although it contained two divisions of battleships, these were some of the Navy&#x27;s oldest battleships, and the Scouting Fleet primarily consisted of cruiser and destroyer divisions. The old aircraft carrier was also attached to the Scouting Fleet for aircraft training purposes. Taylor&#x27;s job was to train the Scouting Fleet for scouting missions. He was promoted to vice admiral in the summer of 1928.

Taylor&#x27;s command of the Scouting Fleet ended on March 8, 1929. He was succeeded by Rear Admiral William Carey Cole. Taylor was named chief of the War Plans Division of the Office of Naval Operations. Although energetic, deeply interested in Asia and the Pacific region, and a student of blockades and invasions, Taylor contributed little to war planning in these crucial years. According to naval historian Edward S. Miller, Taylor believed that Japan (a rising naval power in the Pacific) &quot;deserved&quot; American friendship, and that Japanese attempts to control Manchuria were a positive development. Naval historian Robert Love agrees, noting that Taylor deeply distrusted the Chinese and believed the Nationalist Government unwilling to defend its own territory. During this period, Taylor became good friends with Japanese Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura. While serving in the War Plans office, Taylor was appointed to the navy board assigned with selecting officers for promotion to admiral, commander, and captain. He also was appointed to the board of inquiry into comments made by Major General Smedley Butler (USMC) about an alleged crime committed by Benito Mussolini. Butler retired before the board finished its work.

===Command of the Asiatic Fleet===

Taylor was promoted to admiral and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet (CICAF) on April 2, 1931. His command became effective September 1, 1931. He won the position based on a reputation for quick thinking and making decisions without waiting for approval by superiors. His chief of staff was Captain Frank Jack Fletcher (a future admiral who would successfully lead fleets in the Battle of the Coral Sea and Battle of Midway). Admiral Taylor believed that the role of the United States Navy in the Far East was &quot;sitting tight&quot; and not getting involved. He openly counseled American non-intervention in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria (which began on September 19, 1931) and believed that Japan could not be convinced to give up her war-won possessions on the mainland without coercion. Nonetheless, he acted decisively to ensure that the United States was positioned to intervene if necessary. The Asiatic Fleet was based in Manila in the Philippines. After the Mukden Incident, Taylor dispatched four fast destroyers to Shanghai without orders. He then ordered (again without approval from superiors) a troop of U.S. Marines to board his remaining ships so that the Asiatic Fleet had a ground force to use as well. As he prepared to sail, only then did U.S. Fleet Admiral William V. Pratt order him to proceed to Shanghai.

Taylor&#x27;s tenure as commander-in-chief of the Asiatic Fleet was a tumultuous one. On February 24, 1932, Taylor helped Italy and China avoid an international incident. An artillery shell from the mainland hit the Italian Navy ship &quot;Libia&quot;, leading the Italians to threaten retaliation. Taylor convinced the Italians that, in the absence of any intentional shelling, they should consider the matter closed. His advice was taken, and Admiral Pratt publicly praised him for his quick thinking. On March 5, 1932, Taylor joined a joint British, French, and Italian committee sponsored by the League of Nations to investigate the war between China and Japan. The Asiatic Fleet returned to Manila in late March 1932. In May 1933, Taylor ordered the Asiatic Fleet to make a goodwill tour of Japan. He was cordially received by Emperor Hirohito.

Admiral Taylor became nationally known for his tact and diplomacy in dealing with the Japanese. Nonetheless, he stepped down as CINCAF on August 18, 1933. His successor was Admiral Frank B. Upham.

==Retirement and death==

Montgomery M. Taylor retired from the U.S. Navy due to age restrictions on November 1, 1933.

Retirement did not end Taylor&#x27;s public service, however. He was appointed to serve on the United States Maritime Commission on September 26, 1936, replacing Admiral Harry G. Hamlet. He remained on the commission until 1938, and then resigned. Thomas M. Woodward was appointed to fulfill the remainder of Taylor&#x27;s term, which was due to end on September 26, 1939.

Taylor never married. After a lengthy illness, he died at Bethesda Naval Medical Center of a stroke on October 21, 1952. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Awards and decorations==
His awards and medals included the Dewey Medal, Spanish Campaign Medal, Philippine Campaign Medal, World War I Victory Medal, and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.

He was a member of the Aztec Club of 1847 by right of his relationship to Major General Zachary Taylor.

Each show opened with Kellerman relaying three bits of information he has heard/been told of. He always concluded by saying, &quot;but I, Max, say wrong, wrong, wrong&quot; and would add a pithy comment afterward.

The show was divided into segments, with topics in each segment being scored as &quot;rounds&quot; (not unlike boxing, which Max has a background in as an analyst for HBO and previously ESPN2). The show was originally scored on a 10-point scale system like a boxing match, with the loser of the round scoring 9 in most cases (8 or less if Wolff determined the argument to be weak enough to warrant it). This later was changed to the winner of the argument getting credit for winning the round. Originally a 15-round format, the show later reduced the rounds to 12.

The show was conducted as follows:

* Segment 1: Kellerman and Holley argued over the day&#x27;s sports topics, with Max being presented with the argument from the World&#x27;s side and countering it with his own opinion while Holley would defend the World&#x27;s side. Max could stop Holley -or Wolff- from commenting at any time with the use of the &quot;MeVR&quot;, a button that immediately paused their video screens and prevented them from talking. Kellerman would often use the button on Holley in order to interject so he could respond to Holley&#x27;s argument without talking over him. His use of the button on Wolff was often used as a comic annoyance, with Wolff feigning frustration on camera afterward.
* Segment 2: The second segment of the show saw Kellerman and Holley square off against each other in a rotating series of argument-based segments. One was called &quot;I Object,&quot; where Max and Holley took turns presenting cases for a certain sports subject, with the other side almost always jumping in by saying &quot;I object&quot; and presenting the opposing view. Wolff served as the &quot;honorable judge&quot; (dressed as a barrister, even down to a powdered wig) and would either sustain (give the round to the objector) or overrule (give the round to whoever was presenting the case) the objection accordingly. Another segment was &quot;The Great Flip-Off,&quot; where Wolff (dressed as an old card shark dubbed Willie &quot;12 Fingers&quot; Wolff) would arbitrarily give Max and Holley two sides of an argument and would score based on who made the better argument for their side. After this segment Holley&#x27;s involvement with the show ended, although he would appear during the final segment (usually gloating if his side won, which was often immediately met with Kellerman hitting the MeVR).
* Segment 3: An interview with a sports figure, ranging from sports columnists to athletes. The entire segment was scored as one round, and if Kellerman performed well enough the round went to him. The World was credited with the round if he didn&#x27;t.
* Segment 4: Max read short emails about topics (sports or otherwise) written by viewers in a rapid-fire segment. Max would then give his opinion on the topic that was the subject of the email. If Max&#x27;s opinion wasn&#x27;t considered strong enough, Wolff gave the round to the World side. If there was not enough time to finish all the rounds before the end of the show, Wolff had the power to arbitrarily end the fight after one of the arguments. This would be regarded as either Kellerman or The World being &quot;knocked out.&quot; If The World won, Wolff read a brief hate e-mail from a viewer. If Kellerman won, Wolff read a positive fan e-mail, referred to as &quot;love mail&quot;.

Late in the show&#x27;s run, the format changed. The first round would still feature the same debate between Holley and Max, but they were no longer scored. The next two segments usually consisted of Kellerman conducting interviews, although there was an occasional second segment game from the previous format that Holley would participate in (otherwise, his time on the show ended after the first segment). The final segment saw Bill Wolff make his first appearance of the show and again saw Max answer emails from viewers, with Wolff arbitrarily deciding after the segment was over whether Kellerman would receive love or hate mail.

==Cancellation==
The show was the most popular show on Fox Sports Net, though many people thought the show to be too similar in style to Max&#x27;s former show, &quot;Around the Horn&quot;. Despite the high ratings, the last episode of &quot;I, Max&quot; aired on February 18, 2005, nine months after it debuted. Max Kellerman, on the other hand, has an explanation for the demise of &quot;I, Max&quot;. According to statements made by Kellerman frequently on his radio show, the show was the highest-rated show on Fox Sports. The cancellation of &quot;I, Max&quot;, according to Kellerman, was due to his not agreeing to making changes to the show&#x27;s format that he viewed would damage the show. He also took time away from sports television media just beforehand and after the cancellation due to grief over his brother&#x27;s October 2004 death from a homicide, which former boxer James Butler was convicted for carrying out.

<doc id="1113540" wikidata="Q7132333" url="?curid=1113540" title="Papa Gino's">
<text>Papa Gino&#x27;s, Inc., is a restaurant chain based in Dedham, Massachusetts, specializing in traditional thin crust pizza along with pasta, subs, salads, and a variety of appetizers. As of 2023, there are 79 Papa Gino&#x27;s locations in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.

== History ==
Papa Gino&#x27;s originated in East Boston, Massachusetts as a single location named &quot;Piece O&#x27; Pizza,&quot; which opened in 1961. In 1968, the owners, Helen and Michael Valerio, changed the name to &quot;Papa Gino&#x27;s&quot; and began expanding the business to multiple locations, 220 when they sold the company to a group of investors in 1991.

In 1997, Papa Gino&#x27;s bought D&#x27;Angelo Sandwich Shops, another Massachusetts-based fast-food outlet, specializing in sandwiches, from prior owner Yum! Brands (then known as PepsiCo Inc.&#x27;s Pizza Hut unit). A few months later, executives of a holding company, Papa Gino&#x27;s Holdings Corporation (later known as PGHC Holdings), bought out the company in a deal financed by Bunker Hill Capital Partners.

===2018 bankruptcy===
On September 18, 2018, Bunker Hill Capital Partners ended their investment with PGHC Holdings. On November 4, 2018, dozens of Papa Gino&#x27;s locations closed abruptly, including their only location in Maine, at the Auburn Mall, bringing the chain from over 150 locations to 97. Employees were not given advance notice of the closures and were told to apply to other restaurants when they arrived for work at closed stores. The following day, PGHC Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection and announced that it had reached an agreement in principle to sell its restaurant chains to Wynnchurch Capital.

===Post-bankruptcy===
On June 14, 2022, it was revealed that Papa Gino’s would be opening a new restaurant for the first time since it emerged from bankruptcy. 

== Advertising ==
Since the late 1990s, the chain has partnered with the Boston Red Sox and New England Patriots, as well as individual players with the teams such as former Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz. Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi replaced kicker Adam Vinatieri as pitchman in the fall of 2006, after Vinatieri was signed by the Indianapolis Colts. In 2020, Papa Gino&#x27;s continues to partner with the Providence Bruins, the Worcester Red Sox and Holy Cross. They also partner with many local kids teams in the communities that they serve.

<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp was the civilian name of a family of air-cooled radial piston engines developed in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.

The Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Company (P&amp;W) was founded in 1925 by Frederick B. Rentschler, who had previously been the President of Wright Aeronautical. He brought with him some of Wright&#x27;s best designers and the new team quickly came up with their first design, the R-1340 Wasp. The name &quot;Wasp&quot; was suggested for the first model by Rentschler&#x27;s wife, Faye.

<doc id="1113557" wikidata="Q2377054" url="?curid=1113557" title="System bus">
<text>A system bus is a single computer bus that connects the major components of a computer system,
combining the functions of a data bus to carry information, an address bus to determine where it should be sent or read from, and a control bus to determine its operation. The technique was developed to reduce costs and improve modularity, and although popular in the 1970s and 1980s, more modern computers use a variety of separate buses adapted to more specific needs.

The system level bus (as distinct from a CPU&#x27;s internal datapath busses) connects the CPU to memory and I/O devices.
Typically a system level bus is designed for use as a backplane.

==Background scenario==
Many of the computers were based on the &quot;First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC&quot; report published in 1945. In what became known as the Von Neumann architecture, a central control unit and arithmetic logic unit (ALU, which he called the central arithmetic part) were combined with computer memory and input and output functions to form a stored program computer. The &quot;Report&quot; presented a general organization and theoretical model of the computer, however, not the implementation of that model.
Soon designs integrated the control unit and ALU into what became known as the central processing unit (CPU).

Computers in the 1950s and 1960s were generally constructed in an ad-hoc fashion.
For example, the CPU, memory, and input/output units were each one or more cabinets connected by cables. Engineers used the common techniques of standardized bundles of wires and extended the concept as backplanes were used to hold printed circuit boards in these early machines. 
The name &quot;bus&quot; was already used for &quot;bus bars&quot; that carried electrical power to the various parts of electric machines, including early mechanical calculators.
The advent of integrated circuits vastly reduced the size of each computer unit, and buses became more standardized.
Standard modules could be interconnected in more uniform ways and were easier to develop and maintain.

==Description==
To provide even more modularity with reduced cost, memory and I/O buses (and the required control and power buses) were sometimes combined into a single unified system bus.
Modularity and cost became important as computers became small enough to fit in a single cabinet (and customers expected similar price reductions).
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) further reduced cost for mass-produced minicomputers, and memory-mapped I/O into the memory bus, so that the devices appeared to be memory locations. This was implemented in the Unibus of the PDP-11 around 1969, eliminating the need for a separate I/O bus.
Even computers such as the PDP-8 without memory-mapped I/O were soon implemented with a system bus, which allowed modules to be plugged into any slot.
Some authors called this a new streamlined &quot;model&quot; of computer architecture.

Many early microcomputers (with a CPU generally on a single integrated circuit) were built with a single system bus, starting with the S-100 bus in the Altair 8800 computer system in about 1975.
The IBM PC used the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus as its system bus in 1981. The passive backplanes of early models were replaced with the standard of putting the CPU and RAM on a motherboard, with only optional daughterboards or expansion cards in system bus slots.
The Multibus became a standard of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers as IEEE standard 796 in 1983. 
Sun Microsystems developed the SBus in 1989 to support smaller expansion cards.
The easiest way to implement symmetric multiprocessing was to plug in more than one CPU into the shared system bus, which was used through the 1980s.
However, the shared bus quickly became the bottleneck and more sophisticated connection techniques were explored.

Even in very simple systems, at various times the data bus is driven by the program memory, by RAM, and by I/O devices.
To prevent bus contention on the data bus, at any one instant only one device drives the data bus.
In very simple systems, only the data bus is required to be a bidirectional bus.
In very simple systems, the memory address register always drives the address bus, the control unit always drives the control bus,
and an address decoder selects which particular device is allowed to drive the data bus during this bus cycle.
In very simple systems, every instruction cycle starts with a READ memory cycle where program memory drives the instruction onto the data bus while the instruction register latches that instruction from the data bus.
Some instructions continue with a WRITE memory cycle where the memory data register drives data onto the data bus into the chosen RAM or I/O device.
Other instructions continue with another READ memory cycle where the chosen RAM, program memory, or I/O device drives data onto the data bus while the memory data register latches that data from the data bus.

More complex systems have a multi-master bus—not only do they have many devices that each drive the data bus, but also have many bus masters that each drive the address bus.
The address bus as well as the data bus in bus snooping systems is required to be a bidirectional bus, often implemented as a three-state bus.
To prevent bus contention on the address bus, a bus arbiter selects which particular bus master is allowed to drive the address bus during this bus cycle.

==Dual Independent Bus==
Intel has used the term &quot;Dual Independent Bus&quot; (DIB) for two different purposes. The first one came when Intel changed from a single local bus to the DIB, using the external front-side bus to the main system memory and I/O devices, and the internal back-side bus to the L2 CPU cache. This was introduced in the Pentium Pro in 1995.

In 2005 and 2006 Intel introduced the 8500 and 5000 chipsets, where DIB referred to the two front-side buses on a chipset, which doubles the system bandwidth compared to having just one FSB shared by all the CPUs. However, the information needed to guarantee the cache coherence of shared data located in different caches have to be sent in broadcast (snooped) to check the other FSB&#x27;s CPUs&#x27; cache state, reducing the available bandwidth. To reduce the coherency traffic, a snoop filter was included in the higher-end chipsets, in order to have cache state information available on-chipset. In 2007 Intel extended the idea of multiple buses in the 7300 chipset with four independent FSBs, calling it &quot;dedicated high-speed interconnects&quot; (DHSI). 

The system bus approach is obsolete in the modern personal and server computers, which instead use higher-performance interconnection technologies such as HyperTransport and Intel QuickPath Interconnect, while the system bus architecture continued to be used on simpler embedded microprocessors.
The systems bus can even be internal to a single integrated circuit, producing a system-on-a-chip. Examples include AMBA, CoreConnect, and Wishbone.

== Examples ==

=== Intel Direct Media Interface ===

Direct Media Interface is an example of a system bus (besides directly accessed PCIE lanes) implemented by Intel and known since at least 2004. It&#x27;s primarily used to access memory-mapped I/O devices and communicate CPU to the chipset.

<doc id="1113560" wikidata="Q7680132" url="?curid=1113560" title="Tallgrass prairie">
<text>The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Historically, natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison) provided periodic disturbances to these ecosystems, limiting the encroachment of trees, recycling soil nutrients, and facilitating seed dispersal and germination. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled large scale conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies extended throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba.

They were characteristically found in parts of the upper Mississippi River Valley, in the central forest-grasslands transition, the central tall grasslands, the upper Midwest forest-savanna transition, and the northern tall grasslands ecoregions. They flourished in areas with rich loess soils and moderate rainfall around 30-35 inches (700–900 mm) per year. To the east were the fire-maintained eastern savannas. In the northeast, where fire was infrequent and periodic windthrow represented the main source of disturbance, beech-maple forests dominated. In contrast, shortgrass prairie was typical in the western Great Plains, where rainfall is less frequent, and soils are less fertile. Due to expansive agricultural land use, very little tallgrass prairie remains.

==History of origin and demise==
Retreating glaciers deposited the parent material for soil in the form of till, i.e. unsorted sediment, about 10,000 years ago. Wind-dropped loess and organic matter accumulated, resulting in deep levels of topsoil. Animals such as bison, elk, deer, and rabbits added nitrogen to the soil through urine and feces. Prairie dogs, a type of squirrel and considered to be a keystone species, dug tunnels, turning the soil and allowing water to travel several feet underground.

For 5,000 to 8,000 years, more than of prairie grasslands were a major feature of the landscape. Between 1800 and 1930, the vast majority was destroyed. Settlers transformed what they named &quot;the Great American Desert&quot; or &quot;The Inland Sea&quot; into farmland. Major reasons for the prairie&#x27;s demise were the confined grazing pattern of European cattle versus bison, the near-extermination of prairie dogs, and the plowing and cultivation of the land, which breached tallgrass root systems and interrupted reproduction. Furthermore, extensive tile drainage has changed the soil&#x27;s water content and hydrodynamics, and ongoing soil erosion results in its increasing loss.

Estimates differ of how much original tallgrass prairie survives, ranging from less than 1% mostly in &quot;scattered remnants found in pioneer cemeteries, restoration projects, along highways and railroad rights-of-way, and on steep bluffs high above rivers&quot; to 4%.

==Ecosystem==
Tallgrass prairie is capable of supporting significant biodiversity. According to the World Wildlife Fund, parts of the ecoregion are among the &quot;top ten ecoregions for reptiles, birds, butterflies, and tree species. Tallgrass species are found in the understory layer.&quot; Oak, such as blackjack oak (&quot;Quercus marilandica&quot;) and post oak (&quot;Q. stellata&quot;), and hickory tree species occur in some areas, but generally in moderate densities. Bison (&quot;Bison bison&quot;) were a dominant species.

The tallgrass prairie biome depends on prairie fires, a form of wildfire, for its survival and renewal. Tree seedlings and intrusive alien species without fire tolerance are eliminated by periodic fires. Such fires may either be set by humans (for example, Native Americans used fires to drive bison and improve hunting, travel, and visibility) or started naturally by lightning.

White-tailed deer fecal matter has nutrients for plant biodiversity in Tallgrass prairie area.

==Boundaries==
As its name suggests, the most famous members of the tallgrass prairie are tall warm-season grasses, such as indiangrass (&quot;Sorghastrum nutans&quot;), big bluestem (&quot;Andropogon gerardi&quot;), and switchgrass (&quot;Panicum virgatum&quot;), which average between tall, and little bluestem (&quot;Schizachyrium scoparium&quot;), which is typically up to . Remnant prairies typically have a larger number of shorter grasses, such as prairie dropseed (&quot;Sporobolus heterolepis&quot;), porcupine grass (&quot;Hesperostipa spartea&quot;), and Leiberg&#x27;s panic grass (&quot;Dichanthelium leibergii&quot;) in the Upper Midwest. Prairies also include a large percentage of forbs, such as lead plant (&quot;Amorpha&quot; spp.), prairie rosinweed (&quot;Silphium&quot; spp.), gayfeathers (&quot;Liatris&quot; spp.), sunflowers (&quot;Helianthus&quot; spp.), asters (&quot;Symphyotrichum&quot; spp.), coneflowers (&quot;Echinacea&quot; spp., and &quot;Rudbeckia&quot; spp.), and many other species.

Technically, prairies have less than 5–11% tree cover. A grass-dominated plant community with 10–49% tree cover is a savanna.

After the steel plow was invented by John Deere in 1833, this fertile soil became one of America&#x27;s most important resources. Over 95% of the original tallgrass prairie is now farmland.

==Remnants==

The tallgrass prairie survives in areas unsuited to plowing: the rocky hill country of the Flint Hills, which runs north to south through east-central Kansas; the eastern fringe of the Red River Valley (Tallgrass Aspen Parkland) in Manitoba and Minnesota; the &quot;Coteau des Prairies&quot;, which extends from South Dakota through Minnesota and into Iowa; and the far north portion of Oklahoma. In Oklahoma, the tallgrass prairie has been maintained by ranchers, who saw the hat-high grass as prime grazing area for cattle.

The Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Osage County, Oklahoma, and the somewhat smaller Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in Kansas, attempt to maintain this ecosystem in its natural form. They have reintroduced plains bison to the vast expanses of grass. Other U.S. preserves include Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie in Illinois, Broken Kettle Preserve and Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in Iowa, Konza Prairie in Kansas, and Prairie State Park in Missouri. In eastern North Dakota is Sheyenne National Grassland, the only national grassland on the tallgrass prairie. Also, several small tallgrass prairie reservations are in Cook County, Illinois, including the National Natural Landmark, Gensburg-Markham Prairie. Tallgrass prairie remnants can also be found among nature preserves in the Hobart Nature District, located in Hobart, Indiana, just outside of Chicago.

The original extent of tallgrass prairie in Canada was the plain in the Red River Valley, southwest of Winnipeg in Manitoba (&quot;see&quot; map). While most of Manitoba&#x27;s tallgrass prairie has been destroyed through cultivation and urban expansion, relatively small areas persist. One of the largest blocks of remaining tallgrass prairie in Manitoba is protected by several conservation partners in a conservation area called the Tallgrass Aspen Parkland. The Manitoba Tall Grass Prairie Preserve, which occupies small portions of the municipalities of Stuartburn and Emerson – Franklin, forms a part of the Tallgrass Aspen Parkland. This preserve contains about of tallgrass prairie, aspen parkland, and wetlands.

A small pocket of less than of tallgrass prairie remains in the southwest corner of Windsor, Ontario, protected by Ojibway Park, and Spring Garden Area of Natural Scientific Interest, along with the interconnected parks: Black Oak Heritage Park, Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve, and the Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park. Aside from the Provincial Nature Reserve, all are operated by the City of Windsor&#x27;s Parks and Recreation.

==Restoration==
Considered the birthplace of ecological restoration, the first tallgrass prairie restoration was the 1936 Curtis Prairie at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum. The UW Arboretum was the center of tallgrass prairie research through the first half of the 20th century, with the development of the nearby Greene Prairie, Aldo Leopold Shack and Farm and pioneering techniques like prescribed burning. The latter half of the 20th century saw the growth of tallgrass prairie restoration beyond Wisconsin borders, with projects in Illinois such as at Knox College, College of DuPage, Morton Arboretum, and Fermi National Laboratory, and projects in Iowa including Grinnell College&#x27;s Conard Environmental Research Area. These major tallgrass restoration projects marked restoration’s growth from isolated studies to widespread practice. Tallgrass prairie restoration efforts picked up wider public recognition in the 1980s, spurred by the publication of a book of appreciation, John Madson&#x27;s &quot;Where the Sky Began: Land of the Tallgrass Prairie&quot; (1982). Nonprofit organizations throughout the former tallgrass prairie region began to reserve or restore small remnants of native prairie. For example, the Native Prairies Association of Texas was founded in 1986 to locate, restore, and protect prairies in Texas; the group currently protects about of Texas prairies.

The Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, founded in 1996 near Elwood, Illinois, was, as of 2006, the largest tallgrass prairie restoration area in the United States. In Minnesota, Glacial Ridge National Wildlife Refuge was established in 2004. The core of the refuge is a preserved tallgrass prairie remnant, and an additional are either in the process of restoration or will be soon. According to The Nature Conservancy, so far, 100 wetlands have been restored, and of land has been seeded with native plant species.

Several books have been published on tallgrass prairie restoration, including:

<doc id="1113562" wikidata="Q3279287" url="?curid=1113562" title="Chicago 17">
<text>Chicago 17 is the fourteenth studio album, seventeenth overall by American rock band Chicago, released on May 14, 1984. It was the group&#x27;s second release for Full Moon/Warner Bros. Records, their second album to be produced by David Foster and their last with founding bassist/vocalist Peter Cetera. As of 2023, it remains Chicago&#x27;s best-selling album, with over 6.1 million copies being sold in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Four singles were released from the album, all of which peaked in the top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The success of the music videos for &quot;Stay the Night&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot;, and &quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot; on MTV propelled &quot;Chicago 17&quot; to achieve an RIAA certification of six times platinum.

In 1985, the album received three Grammy Awards. David Foster won for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical (tied in this category with Lionel Richie and James Anthony Carmichael), Humberto Gatica won for Best Engineered Recording – Non-Classical, and David Foster and Jeremy Lubbock won for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocal(s) for &quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot; which was also nominated for Record of the Year, Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals and Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices. In his review of the album for AllMusic, music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine says &quot;Chicago 17&quot; is &quot;the pinnacle of [producer David Foster&#x27;s] craft and one of the best adult contemporary records of the &#x27;80s,&quot; and one of the most influential albums &quot;within its style.&quot; Writing for &quot;Billboard&quot;, Bobby Olivier said the album &quot;is one of the greatest pure power ballad albums of all time — or at least from 1984 — and &quot;[Hard] Habit [to Break]&quot; is one of the finest entries.&quot;

In 2006, Rhino Entertainment remastered and reissued the album, using the original analog versions of &quot;Please Hold On&quot; (which was co-written with Lionel Richie who was enjoying success from his album &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot;) and &quot;Prima Donna&quot; and adding a Robert Lamm demo, &quot;Here Is Where We Begin&quot; as a bonus track.

==Artwork, packaging==

In keeping with the majority of their albums up to that time (1984), the traditional &quot;Chicago&quot; logo, designed by John Berg and Nick Fasciano, is the main feature of the album cover. It does not feature any photos of the group. In a 2020 article for &quot;Muse by Clio&quot;, it was listed among &quot;Nine Great Album Covers, Chosen by Gregory Sylvester.&quot; Sylvester describes the cover as, &quot; ... an illusion of a package within a package ... brown kraft paper, twine and a faux red stamp.&quot; The album cover looks like a package wrapped in brown paper tied with twine and (on the back) secured with tape. On the front, the &quot;Chicago&quot; logo appears to be in bas-relief (it is not), covered by the wrapping paper. The number &quot;17,&quot; in Arabic numerals rather than the Roman numerals used by the group formerly, appears to be stamped on the wrapping paper below the logo. In the upper left-hand quadrant of the cover back, a pink &quot;receipt form&quot; is depicted (designated as a &quot;TOPS FORM 3014&quot; in small print at the bottom of the &quot;receipt&quot;), tucked underneath the &quot;twine,&quot; with the &quot;Chicago&quot; logo stamped on it near the top in purple ink and, below the logo, a &quot;DESCRIPTION OF PACKAGE&quot; lists the tracks on side one and side two. The bottom of the &quot;receipt form&quot; shows production and engineering credits and the Warner Bros. logo &quot;stamped&quot; on the slip. On the inner dust sleeve, a large group photo of the band appears on one side: (back row, left to right) Lee Loughnane, Bill Champlin, James Pankow, Walt Parazaider, Robert Lamm, (front row, left to right) Danny Seraphine, Peter Cetera. The reverse side of the dust sleeve gives track listings, song lyrics, and song and album credits, including credits for artwork and packaging: Art Direction/Design, Simon Levy; Album Cover Art, Larry Vigon; Photography, Harry Langdon, James Goble.

==Track listing==

Some songs were recorded during the &quot;Chicago 17&quot; sessions but not released. &quot;Good for Nothing&quot; was later released on the &quot;We Are the World&quot; superstar charity album in 1985. This is the last released Chicago song to feature Peter Cetera on vocals.

A song called &quot;Sweet Marie&quot; recorded during sessions for the &quot;Chicago 17&quot; album has been performed by the Norwegian band TOBB. Bill Champlin offered this song to the band. It was released on May 14, 2014 by TOBB, the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Chicago 17&quot; album&#x27;s release. It was performed by Chicago on rare occasions in 1984, and has surfaced online from VHS recordings of some of their performances.

A subsequent international release in 2010 (included in the &quot;Studio Albums 1979 - 2008&quot; boxed set from 2015) has the original album restored, with additional bonus tracks of alternate versions of &quot;Only You&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot;, and &quot;Prima Donna&quot; as well as &quot;Here Is Where We Begin&quot;. A demo version of &quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot; exists with Robert Lamm on vocals, as briefly heard during the documentary “Now More Than Ever: The History of Chicago.”

<text>Luigi Ciriaco De Mita (; 2 February 1928 – 26 May 2022) was an Italian politician and statesman who served as Prime Minister of Italy from April 1988 to July 1989.

A member of the Christian Democracy (DC), De Mita served as its secretary and leader from May 1982 until February 1989, becoming one of the most influential politicians in the country, as well as one of the most prominent members of DC&#x27;s left-wing. During his long-time career, he also served as Minister of Industry, Commerce and Crafts from 1973 to 1974, Minister of Foreign Trade from 1974 to 1976, and Minister for Interventions in the South from 1976 until 1979. He was a member of the Chamber of Deputies for more than 40 years between 1963 and 2008 and also member of the European Parliament. During his final years, De Mita served as mayor of his hometown Nusco from 2014 until his death in 2022.

==Early life and studies==
Ciriaco De Mita was born in Nusco in the Avellinese hinterland in 1928. His father was a tailor and postman, while his mother was a housewife. After attending the classical high school in nearby Sant&#x27;Angelo dei Lombardi with excellent grades, he won a scholarship in the Augustinianum College and enrolled at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, where he graduated in law and then started working as a consultant at Enrico Mattei&#x27;s Eni legal office.

==Political career==
As a young man, De Mita joined the Christian Democracy (DC) and entered politics. In 1953, De Mita was among the proponents of &quot;La Base&quot;, a leftist wing of the party, close to Giovanni Marcora. He rose through the ranks of the party, becoming a member of its national council in 1956 during the party&#x27;s congress in Trento.

In the 1963 general election, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the constituency of Benevento–Avellino–Salerno with more than 67,000 votes. and he will be a deputy uninterruptedly until the elections of 1994. In 1968 De Mita was appointed undersecretary of state to the Ministry of Interior, becoming a member of the government for the first time. 

De Mita was appointed deputy secretary of the Christian Democracy in 1969, serving under the leadership of Arnaldo Forlani; he hold the position until February 1973. During the 1970s, De Mita hold various positions in the government. He served in the cabinet of Mariano Rumor as Minister of Industry, Trade and Crafts from 8 July 1973 until 23 November 1974; Minister of Foreign Trade from 23 November 1974 to 30 July 1976 in the government of Aldo Moro and Minister for Extraordinary Interventions in Southern Italy in the cabinet of Giulio Andreotti from 30 July 1976 to 21 March 1979.

===Secretary of the Christian Democracy===
In the 1982 party congress, De Mita was elected secretary of the Christian Democracy with a clear objective of renewing the party. As party&#x27;s leader, De Mita suffered a huge loss in the 1983 general election. In 1986, De Mita was re-elected secretary with 60% support from the party.

His secretariat is remembered for a rivalry with Bettino Craxi, socialist leader who in the 1980s held the office of Prime Minister for four years. Craxi had always promoted his reformist drive as opposed to the inaction of the Christian democrats and in 1987 he clashed with De Mita for the breaking of the so-called &quot;relay pact&quot; (&quot;patto della staffetta&quot;), under which the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) would have had to cede the leadership of the government to the DC in the last year of the legislature. Craxi refused to do this and in 1987 a snap election was called.

In 1984 De Mita pushed the future president of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, and Leoluca Orlando to intensify their political commitment with the task of cleaning up the Sicilian branch of the DC from Mafia control. De Mita appointed Mattarella as extraordinary commissioner for Palermo.

De Mita remained secretary of the DC until 22 February 1989, when he became president of the party, a position he held until 1992.

==Prime Minister of Italy==
After the elections of 1987, De Mita waited a year to become Prime Minister and was appointed on 13 April 1988, heading a five-way coalition (&quot;Pentapartito&quot;) with DC, PSI, PSDI, PRI and PLI. Three days later, on 16 April 1988, in Forlì, Red Brigades killed Senator Roberto Ruffilli, an advisor of De Mita. De Mita&#x27;s government obtained a vote of confidence from the Chamber of Deputies on 21 April, government that had as its main objective the reform of the institutions based on four urgent points: the Italian Parliament, the presidency of the Council of Ministers, local entities and the rules of procedure of the Chamber of Deputies.

In June 1988 his cabinet approved the relocation of 72 U.S. Air Force F-16 fighters to Italy, in response to Spain&#x27;s request to remove them from its territory.

In social policy, De Mita&#x27;s time in office witnessed the passage of a law in May 1988 that introduced a new benefit for salaried workers called &quot;benefit for the family nucleus&quot; (&quot;assegno per il nucleo familiare&quot;), with the amount varying depending on the number of family members and the family income of the previous year.

After a government crisis caused by rivalry with Craxi, De Mita resigned on 19 May 1989. He was called to form a new coalition government, but did not succeed. His government finally fell in July 1989 and was succeeded by Giulio Andreotti on 23 July. 

===Later political roles===

In September 1992, he was appointed Chairman of the Bilateral Commission for Constitutional Reform, a position he left in March 1993 when was succeeded by Nilde Iotti. In the 1994 elections, De Mita did not run for reelection as a deputy, but ran again in 1996 after a lag of two years and then re-elected in 2001 and 2006. He then joined the Italian People&#x27;s Party and later Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy until 2008.

De Mita was Member of the European Parliament between 1999 and 2004, and 2009 to 2014.

On 25 May 2014, De Mita was elected as mayor of Nusco, his native town, and re-elected in 2019, serving until his death in 2022.

==Personal life and death==
In 1958, De Mita married Anna Maria Scarinzi (born 12 February 1939), with whom he had one son and three daughters, Antonia (born 23 December 1967), Giuseppe (born 10 May 1969), Floriana (born 19 March 1973), and Simona (born 21 April 1974). His nephew Giuseppe De Mita was member of the Chamber of Deputies between 2013 and 2018, and whose political career Ciriaco was in charge of catapulting. 

De Mita died on 26 May 2022, at the age of 94, while recovering from surgery for a fracture of a femur following a fall at home. His funeral was held the following day in Nusco.

<doc id="1113569" wikidata="Q1336295" url="?curid=1113569" title="Polish Operation of the NKVD">
<text>The Polish Operation of the NKVD (Soviet security service) in 1937–1938 was an anti-Polish mass-ethnic cleansing operation of the NKVD carried out in the Soviet Union against Poles (labeled by the Soviets as &quot;agents&quot;) during the period of the Great Purge. It was ordered by the Politburo of the Communist Party against so-called &quot;Polish spies&quot; and customarily interpreted by NKVD officials as relating to &#x27;absolutely all Poles&#x27;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hoover/pdf2&quot;&gt;The Great Terror (Chapter 4) – from: &quot;Stalin&#x27;s Loyal Executioner: People&#x27;s Commissar Nikolai Ezhov, 1895–1940&quot; by Marc Jansen and Nikita Petrov, pp. 95 (17 / 33). Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; It resulted in the sentencing of 139,835 people, and summary executions of 111,091 Poles living in or near the Soviet Union. The operation was implemented according to NKVD Order No. 00485 signed by Nikolai Yezhov. 

The majority of the shooting victims were ethnically Polish, but not all, with some belonging to various minority groups from the Kresy macro-region, for instance, Ruthenians; these groups in the Soviet worldview had some element of Polish culture or heritage, and were therefore also &quot;Polish&quot;. The NKVD agents looked through local phone books to expedite the procedure and detained people with names that sounded Polish.

While similar to other operations such as the &quot;Greek Operation&quot;, &quot;Finnish Operation&quot;, &quot;Latvian Operation&quot; and &quot;Estonian Operation&quot;, the Polish Operation was the largest ethnic shooting and deportation action during the Great Purge campaign of political murders in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;B/E/F&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to official data, victims of the &quot;Polish Operation&quot; accounted for 41.7% of the sentenced people and 44.9% of the executed people during all such ethnic operations.

== NKVD Order No. 00485 ==

The top secret NKVD Order No. 00485, titled &quot;&quot;On the liquidation of the Polish diversionist and espionage groups and POW units&quot;,&quot; was approved on August 9, 1937 by the Party&#x27;s Central Committee Politburo, and was signed by Nikolai Yezhov on August 11, 1937. It was distributed to the local subdivisions of the NKVD simultaneously with Yezhov&#x27;s thirty-page &quot;secret letter&quot;, explaining what the &quot;Polish operation&quot; was all about. The letter from Yezhov was titled, &quot;On fascist-resurrectionist, spying, diversional, defeationist, and terrorist activity of Polish intelligence in the USSR&quot;. Joseph Stalin was approving of the operation saying &quot;&#x27;Very good! Dig up and purge this Polish espionage mud in the future as well. Destroy it in the interest of the USSR..&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hoover/pdf&quot;&gt;The Great Terror (Chapter 4) – from: &quot;Stalin&#x27;s Loyal Executioner: People&#x27;s Commissar Nikolai Ezhov, 1895–1940&quot; by Marc Jansen and Nikita Petrov, pp. 95 (17 / 33). Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;
The &quot;Order&quot; adopted the simplified so-called &quot;album procedure&quot; (as it was called in NKVD circles). The long lists of Poles condemned by a lower NKVD organ (so-called &quot;dvoika&quot;, a two-man team) during early meetings, were then collected into &quot;albums&quot; and sent to the midrange NKVD offices for a stamp of approval by a &quot;troika&quot; (a three-man team; a communist official, NKVD leader, and party procurator). Poles were the first ever major Soviet population group to be sentenced in this manner. After the approval of the entire &quot;album&quot;, the executions were carried out immediately. This procedure was also used later on in other mass operations of the NKVD.

The &quot;Polish Operation&quot; was a second in a series of national operations of the NKVD, carried out by the Soviet Union against ethnic groups including Latvian, Finnish, German, and Romanian, based on a theory about an internal enemy (i.e., the fifth column), labelled as the &quot;hostile capitalist surrounding&quot; residing along its western borders. In the opinion of historian Timothy Snyder, this fabricated justification was intended only to cover-up the state-sanctioned campaign of mass-murder aiming to eradicate Poles as a national (and linguistic) minority group. Another possible cause, according to Snyder, might have sprung from the necessity to explain the Holodomor, the Soviet-made famine in Ukraine, which required a political scapegoat. A top Soviet official, Vsevolod Balitsky, chose the Polish Military Organization which was disbanded in 1921. The NKVD declared that it continued to exist. Some Soviet Poles were tortured in order to confess to its existence, and denounce other individuals as spies. Meanwhile, the Communist International helped by revisiting its files in search of Polish members, producing another bountiful source of made-up evidence.

==Targets of the operation==

The operation took place approximately from August 25, 1937, to November 15, 1938. The largest group of people with a Polish background, around 40 percent of all victims, came from Soviet Ukraine, especially from the districts near the border with Poland. Among them were tens of thousands of peasants, railway workers, industrial labourers, engineers and others. An additional 17 percent of victims came from Soviet Byelorussia. The rest came from around Western Siberia and Kazakhstan, where exiled Poles had lived since the Partitions of Poland, as well as from the southern Urals, northern Caucasus and the rest of Siberia, including the Far East.

The following categories of people were arrested by the NKVD during its Polish Operation, as described in Soviet documents:
# All &quot;antisoviet and nationalistic elements&quot; from districts and region in the USSR where there existed a Polish community.
# All immigrants from the Second Polish Republic.
# Political exiles from Poland.
# Former and present members of the Polish Socialist Party and other non-communist Polish political parties.
# All prisoners of war from the Polish-Soviet war remaining in the Soviet Union.
# Members of the Polish Military Organisation listed in the special list.
#All &quot;clerical elements&quot; having, or having had, some kind of connection with Poland.

==Ethnic breakdown==
Although the Soviet authorities claim that the executed victims were all ethnic Poles, some of those killed were also ethnic Belarusians, Jews, Ukrainians and Russians mistaken and alleged for being ethnic Poles due to their surnames or religious denominations. 47.3% of the total number of &quot;Poles&quot; who were arrested in Belarus were actually ethnic Belarusian Catholics, of whom many declared themselves to be Poles in the 1920s. They made up 14.2% of those arrested in the Polish Operation across the Soviet Union (September–November 1938). 13.4% of those arrested were ethnic Ukrainians. 8.8% of the arrested were ethnic Russians.

==Killing process and death toll==
According to archives of the NKVD, 111,091 Poles and people accused of ties with Poland, were sentenced to death, and 28,744 were sentenced to labor camps; 139,835 victims in total. This number constitutes 10% of the total number of people officially convicted during the Yezhovshchina period, based on confirming NKVD documents.

According to historian Bogdan Musiał: &quot;It is estimated that Polish losses in the Ukrainian SSR were about 30%, while in the Belorussian SSR... the Polish minority was almost completely annihilated or deported.&quot; Musiał is also of the opinion that &quot;it does not seem unlikely, as Soviet statistics indicate, that the number of Poles dropped from 792,000 in 1926 to 627,000 in 1939.&quot;

Almost all victims of the NKVD shootings were men, wrote Michał Jasiński, most with families. Their wives and children were dealt with by the NKVD Order No. 00486. The women were generally sentenced to deportation to Kazakhstan for an average of 5 to 10 years. Orphaned children without relatives willing to take them were put in orphanages to be brought up as Soviet, with no knowledge of their origins. All possessions of the accused were confiscated. The parents of the executed men – as well as their in-laws – were left with nothing to live on, which usually sealed their fate as well. Statistical extrapolation, wrote Jasiński, increases the number of Polish victims in 1937–1938 to around 200–250,000 depending on the size of their families.

In Leningrad, the NKVD reviewed local telephone books and arrested almost 7,000 citizens with Polish-sounding name with the vast majority of such nominal &quot;suspects&quot; were executed within 10 days of arrest.
The Polish-majority villages of Siberia were also targeted. In Belostok, Tomsk Oblast, 100 men of Polish origins were executed and their bodies thrown into the Ob River. In Polozovo, Tomsk Oblast 33 Poles were arrested, of which 32 were executed and one died in captivity, and in Vershina 30 Poles were arrested (29 men and one woman), of which one person died during transport to Irkutsk and the rest were executed there.

The small Polish communities of the more remote parts of the USSR were also targeted in the &quot;Polish Operation&quot;. According to the former secret police archives in Tbilisi, Georgia alone, at least 89 people were victims of the &quot;Polish Operation&quot;, and further 125 Poles were victims of other concurrent operations, whereas, according to Kyrgyz archives, at least 180 Poles fell victim to all simultaneous operations of the Great Purge in Kyrgyzstan.

==Assessment==
According to historian Michael Ellman, &quot;The &#x27;national operations&#x27; of 1937–38, notably the &#x27;Polish operation&#x27;, may qualify as genocide as defined by the UN Convention, although there is as yet no legal ruling on the matter&quot;. Karol Karski argues that the Soviet actions against Poles are genocide according to international law. He says that while the extermination was targeting other nationalities as well, and according to the criteria other than ethnicity, but as long as Poles were singled out based on their ethnicity, that makes the actions to be genocide. The historian Terry Martin refers to the &quot;national operations&quot;, including the &quot;Polish Operation&quot;, as ethnic cleansing and &quot;ethnic terror&quot;. According to Martin, the singling out of diaspora nationalities for arrest and mass execution &quot;verged on the genocidal&quot;. Historian Timothy Snyder called the Polish Operation genocidal: &quot;It is hard not to see the Soviet &quot;Polish Operation&quot; of 1937-38 as genocidal: Polish fathers were shot, Polish mothers sent to Kazakhstan, and Polish children left in orphanages where they would lose their Polish identity. As more than 100,000 innocent people were killed on the spurious grounds that theirs was a disloyal ethnicity, Stalin spoke of &quot;Polish filth&quot;. On the other hand, Stalin often praised Poland as a good nation and the Poles as brave fighters, the third most &quot;dogged&quot; soldiers after the Russians and Germans. Norman Naimark called Stalin&#x27;s policy towards Poles in the 1930s &quot;genocidal&quot; but did not consider the entire Great Purge genocidal since it targeted political opponents as well. Simon Sebag Montefiore presents a similar opinion.

According to historians Olle Sundström and Andrej Kotljarchuk, most scholars (for example, Nicolas Werth, Michael Mann and Hiroaki Kuromiya) focus on the security dilemma in the border areas suggesting the need to secure the ethnic integrity of Soviet space &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; neighboring capitalistic enemy states. They stress the role of international relations and believe that representatives of ethnic minorities such as the Poles, were killed not because of their ethnicity, but because of their possible relations to countries hostile to the USSR and fear of disloyalty in the case of an invasion.

<doc id="1113573" wikidata="Q269329" url="?curid=1113573" title="Lettice Knollys">
<text>Lettice Knollys ( , sometimes latinized as Laetitia, alias Lettice Devereux or Lettice Dudley), Countess of Essex and Countess of Leicester (8 November 1543 – 25 December 1634), was an English noblewoman and mother to the courtiers Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and Lady Penelope Rich. By her second marriage to Elizabeth I&#x27;s favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, she incurred the Queen&#x27;s unrelenting displeasure.

A grandniece of Elizabeth&#x27;s mother, Anne Boleyn, and close to Elizabeth since childhood, Lettice Knollys was introduced early into court life. At 17 she married Walter Devereux, Viscount Hereford, who in 1572 became Earl of Essex. After her husband went to Ireland in 1573, she possibly became involved with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. There was plenty of scandalous talk, not least when Essex died in Ireland of dysentery in 1576. Two years later on 20 Sep 1578, Lettice Knollys was married to Robert Dudley in private by his chaplain Humphrey Tyndall. When the Queen was told of the marriage, she banished the Countess forever from court, effectively curtailing her social life. The couple&#x27;s child, Robert, Lord Denbigh, died at the age of three, to the great grief of his parents and ending all prospects for the continuance of the House of Dudley. Lettice Knollys&#x27; union with Leicester was nevertheless a happy one, as was her third marriage to the much younger Sir Christopher Blount, whom she unexpectedly married in 1589 only six months after the Earl&#x27;s death. She continued to style herself Lady Leicester.

The Countess was left rich under Leicester&#x27;s will; yet the discharge of his overwhelming debts diminished her wealth. In 1604–1605 she successfully defended her widow&#x27;s rights in court when her possessions and her good name were threatened by the Earl&#x27;s illegitimate son, Robert Dudley, who claimed that he was his father&#x27;s legitimate heir, thus implicitly declaring her marriage bigamous. Lettice Knollys was always close to her large family circle. Helpless at the political eclipse of her eldest son, the second Earl of Essex, she lost both him and her third husband to the executioner in 1601. From the 1590s she lived chiefly in the Staffordshire countryside, where, in reasonably good health until the end, she died at age 91 on Christmas Day 1634.

==Family and upbringing==
Lettice Knollys was born on 8 November 1543 at Rotherfield Greys, Oxfordshire. Her father, Sir Francis Knollys, was a Member of Parliament and acted as Master of the Horse to Prince Edward. Her mother, Catherine Carey, was a daughter of Mary Boleyn, sister to Anne Boleyn. Thus Catherine was Elizabeth I&#x27;s first cousin, and Lettice Knollys her first cousin once removed. Lettice was the third of her parents&#x27; 16 children.

Sir Francis and his wife were Protestants. In 1556 they went to Frankfurt in Germany to escape religious persecution under Queen Mary I, taking five of their children with them. It is unknown whether Lettice was among them, and she may have passed the next few years in the household of Princess Elizabeth, with whom the family had a close relationship since the mid-1540s. Her parents and the remainder of the family returned to England in January 1559, two months after Elizabeth I&#x27;s succession. Francis Knollys was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household; Lady Knollys became a senior Lady of the Bedchamber, and her daughter Lettice a Maid of the Privy Chamber.

==First marriage and love affair==
In late 1560 Lettice Knollys married Walter Devereux, Viscount Hereford. The couple lived at the family seat of Chartley in Staffordshire. Here, the two eldest of their five children, the daughters Penelope and Dorothy, were born in 1563 and 1564, respectively. Lettice Devereux returned to court on at least one occasion, in the summer of 1565, when the Spanish ambassador Diego Guzmán de Silva described her as &quot;one of the best-looking ladies of the court&quot; and as a favourite with the Queen. Pregnant with her first son, she flirted with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, the Queen&#x27;s favourite. The Queen found out at once and succumbed to a fit of jealousy. The Viscountess went back to Staffordshire where, in November 1565, she gave birth to Robert, later 2nd Earl of Essex. Two more sons followed: Walter, who was born in 1569, and Francis, who died soon after birth at an unknown date.

Walter Devereux was raised to the earldom of Essex in 1572. In 1573 he successfully suggested to the Queen a project to plant Englishmen in Ulster. In the autumn he went to Ireland, not to return for two years. During this time Lettice Devereux possibly engaged in a love affair with the Earl of Leicester; her whereabouts in the following years are largely unknown, though. In 1573 Leicester sent her a present of venison at Chartley from his seat Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire, and she made hunting visits to Kenilworth in 1574 and 1576. She was also present in July 1575 when Dudley entertained the Queen with a magnificent 19-day festival at the castle. Elizabeth and the court (including the Earl of Leicester) then progressed to Chartley, where they were welcomed by the Countess of Essex.

When Walter Devereux returned to England in December 1575, the Spanish agent in London, Antonio de Guaras, reported:As the thing is publicly talked of in the streets, there can be no harm in my writing openly about the great enmity between the Earl of Leicester and the Earl of Essex, in consequence, it is said, of the fact that while Essex was in Ireland his wife had two children by Leicester. ... Great discord is expected in consequence.

These rumours were elaborated on years later in &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot;, a Catholic underground libel against the Protestant Earl of Leicester that satirically detailed his alleged enormities. Here the Countess of Essex, after having a daughter by Leicester, kills a second child &quot;cruelly and unnaturally&quot; by abortion to prevent her homecoming husband from discovering her affair. There is no evidence that any such children ever existed.

The Earl of Essex returned to Ireland in July 1576. At Dublin, he died of dysentery on 22 September during an epidemic, bemoaning the &quot;frailness of women&quot; in his last words. Rumours of poison, administered by Leicester, immediately sprang up and continued, notwithstanding an official investigation which concluded that Essex had died of natural causes. His body was carried over to Carmarthen, where his widow attended the funeral.

The Countess&#x27; jointure, the lands left to her under her husband&#x27;s will, was too little to live by and did not comprise Chartley, so that she and her children had to seek accommodation elsewhere. She partly lived in her father&#x27;s house at Rotherfield Greys, but also with friends; &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot; claimed that Leicester had her move &quot;up and down the country from house to house by privy ways&quot;. She pleaded for an augmentation of her jointure with the authorities and, to reach a compromise with the late Earl&#x27;s executors, threatened &quot;by some froward advice&quot; to claim her dower rights. These would have amounted to one third of the Devereux estate. After seven months of wrangling, she reached a more satisfactory settlement, the Countess declaring to be &quot;content to respect my children more than myself&quot;. She equally—though unsuccessfully—tried to move the Queen to forgive Essex&#x27; debts to the Crown, which very much burdened the inheritance of her son, the young Earl of Essex.

==Marriage to Leicester and banishment from court==
Lettice Knollys married Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester on 21 September 1578 at around seven o&#x27;clock in the morning. Only six other people were present at the Earl&#x27;s country house of Wanstead Hall in Essex; among these were the bride&#x27;s father and brother, Francis and Richard Knollys; the bridegroom&#x27;s brother, Ambrose, Earl of Warwick; and his two friends, the Earl of Pembroke and Lord North. The officiating chaplain Humphrey Tyndall later remarked that the bride wore a &quot;loose gown&quot; (an informal morning dress), which has triggered modern speculation that she was pregnant and that the ceremony happened under pressure from her father. The marriage was, however, in planning between Leicester and his wedding guests for almost a year. While Lettice Devereux may well have been pregnant, there is no further indication as to this. The marriage date coincided with the end of the customary two-years-mourning for a widow.

Leicester—a widower since 1560—had for many years been in hope of marrying Elizabeth herself, &quot;for whose sake he had hitherto forborne marriage&quot;, as he confessed to Lord North. He feared Elizabeth&#x27;s reaction and insisted that his marriage be kept a secret. It did not remain one for long, the French ambassador, Michel de Castelnau, reporting it two months later. When the Queen was told of the marriage the next year, she banished Lettice Dudley permanently from court; she never forgave her cousin, nor could she ever accept the marriage. Even Lady Leicester&#x27;s movements through London were resented by the Queen, let alone summer visits to Kenilworth by husband and wife.

Lettice Dudley continued to style herself Countess of Essex for several years into her new marriage. She lived very discreetly, often with her relatives at the Knollys family home in Oxfordshire. In February 1580 she was expecting the birth of a child there. For the birth of Leicester&#x27;s heir, Robert, Lord Denbigh, in June 1581, she moved to Leicester House on the Strand. A further advanced pregnancy was reported in September 1582 by the French ambassador, yet the outcome is again unknown. The next year Lettice Dudley became officially resident at Leicester House, and Elizabeth was once again furious with the Earl &quot;about his marriage, for he opened the same more plainly than ever before&quot;. A few weeks later Michel de Castelnau was a guest at Leicester&#x27;s palatial mansion: &quot;He especially invited me to dine with him and his wife, who has much influence over him and whom he introduces only to those to whom he wishes to show a particular mark of attention.&quot;

Robert Dudley had been close to the Knollys family since the early 1550s; several of Lettice&#x27;s brothers had been in his service, and his marriage only enhanced his relations with her siblings. To his four stepchildren he was a concerned and generous stepfather. The Dudleys&#x27; domestic life is partly documented in the Earl&#x27;s accounts. Lettice Dudley financed her personal expenses and servants out of her revenue as Dowager Countess of Essex, and remained largely excluded from society life.

The three-year-old Lord Denbigh died suddenly on 19 July 1584 at Wanstead. His death shattered the hopes of a dynasty for the House of Dudley. Leicester stayed away from his court duties for a few weeks &quot;to comfort my sorrowful wife for the loss of my little son, whom God has lately taken from us.&quot; He thanked Lord Burghley for—unsuccessfully—pleading with the Queen &quot;on behalf of my poor wife. For truly my Lord, in all reason she is hardly dealt with.&quot;

In 1585 Leicester led an English expedition to assist the rebellious United Provinces against Spain. He incurred Elizabeth&#x27;s wrath when he accepted the title of Governor-General in January 1586. What had especially kindled her fury was a tale that the Countess of Leicester was planning to follow her husband to the Netherlands &quot;with such a train of ladies, and gentlewomen, and such rich coaches, litters, and side-saddles, as Her Majesty had none, and that there should be such a court of ladies, as should far pass Her Majesty&#x27;s court here.&quot; Thomas Dudley, who informed Leicester about these events, stressed that &quot;this information&quot; was &quot;most false&quot;. At this same time the Earl was giving his wife authority to handle certain land issues during his absence, implying they had no plans to meet in Holland. William Davison, whom Leicester had sent to explain his doings to the Queen, described a visit to the Countess during the crisis: &quot;I found her greatly troubled with tempestuous news she received from court, but somewhat comforted when she understood how I had proceeded with Her Majesty.&quot;

The Earl returned to England in December 1586, but was sent again to the Netherlands in the following June—to the grief of his wife, as the young Earl of Essex remarked in a letter. Leicester eventually resigned his post in December 1587. The Countess was with him when he died unexpectedly, possibly of malaria, on 4 September 1588 at Cornbury Park, Oxfordshire; they had been on their way to Kenilworth and Buxton. The Earl&#x27;s funeral at Warwick in October 1588 was attended by his widow as well as numerous members of her family circle.

==Blount and Essex==

Lettice Dudley was left a wealthy widow. Leicester&#x27;s will appointed her as executrix and her income from both her husbands&#x27; jointures amounted to £3,000 annually, to which came plate and movables worth £6,000. However, her jointure was to suffer greatly from paying off Leicester&#x27;s debts, which at some £50,000 were so overwhelming that she was advised to decline the responsibility of dealing with her husband&#x27;s financial legacy.

In March or April 1589, hardly six months after Leicester&#x27;s death, Lettice married Sir Christopher Blount, a relatively poor Catholic soldier 12 years her junior, who had been the Earl of Leicester&#x27;s Gentleman of the Horse and a trusted friend of his. The marriage was a great surprise, and the Earl of Essex complained that it was an &quot;unhappy choice&quot;. In the face of tittle-tattle that had reached even France, Lady Leicester—she continued to be styled thus—explained her choice with being a defenceless widow; like her marriage to Leicester, the union proved to be a &quot;genuinely happy&quot; one. Some 60 years later, it was claimed in a satirical poem that she had poisoned the Earl of Leicester on his deathbed, thereby forestalling her own murder at his hands, because he had found out about her supposed lover, Sir Christopher Blount.

Lettice&#x27;s second son, Walter Devereux, died 1591 in France while on military duty, and in subsequent years she was anxious for her elder son&#x27;s safety. She addressed him &quot;Sweet Robin&quot;, longing for his letters and helpless about his moodiness and depression. In 1593, she sold Leicester House to him, after which it became known as Essex House. She moved to Drayton Bassett near Chartley in Staffordshire, which would be her main residence for the rest of her life. Still banished from court, she saw no point in returning to London without being reconciled to Elizabeth. In December 1597, having heard from friends that &quot;Her Majesty is very well prepared to hearken to terms of pacification&quot;, she prepared to do &quot;a winter journey&quot; if her son thought &quot;it be to any purpose&quot;. &quot;Otherwise a country life is fittest for disgraced persons&quot;, she commented. She travelled to London, staying at Essex House from January till March 1598, and seeking a reconciliation with Elizabeth. At last a short meeting was granted, in which the Countess kissed the Queen and &quot;the Queen kissed her&quot;, but nothing really changed.

Essex was imprisoned in 1599 after returning from his command in Ireland without licence; his mother came to London to intercede for him with the Queen. She tried to send Elizabeth a present in the form of a gown, which Elizabeth neither accepted nor refused. Her efforts to get sight of her son made matters worse: &quot;Mislike is taken that his mother and friends have been in a house that looks into York Garden where he uses to walk, and have saluted each other out of a window.&quot; Both his military incompetence and his &quot;de facto&quot; abandonment of his post were condoned on that occasion, but rather than count his blessings and hold his peace, he became malcontent, chaffed at his failures, and fell into rebellion. During Essex&#x27; revolt, trial, and execution in February 1601, Lettice remained at Drayton Basset. The event was a comprehensive personal disaster for her, because she lost not only her son but also her beloved third husband, who was, she wrote, her &quot;best friend&quot;. Sir Christopher Blount was executed on 18 March 1601, three weeks after the execution of his stepson, to whom he had been a friend and confidant for many years. Sir Christopher had taken in Mary Cresswell and after he died she was looked after by Lettice. Lettice was alarmed when she discovered that Cresswell was set on becoming a nun. With the aid of her chaplain she close to brainwashed the child until she finally accepted the Protestant faith. Cresswell&#x27;s life story would in time be well known.

==Litigation and old age==

The executions and attainders of Essex and Blount led to a legal dispute over the Countess of Leicester&#x27;s remaining property. In this context she claimed that Blount, in the process of paying off Leicester&#x27;s debts, had squandered her jewels and much of her landed wealth. The death of Elizabeth I in 1603 meant some form of rehabilitation for the Countess; the new monarch, James I, not only restored her grandson, the third Earl of Essex, to his father&#x27;s title and estate, but quickly cancelled the rest of her debts to the Crown, almost £4,000.

Even more than his debts, the Earl of Leicester&#x27;s will triggered litigation. He had intended his illegitimate son from his early 1570s relationship with Douglas Sheffield, the adolescent Robert Dudley, to inherit Kenilworth after the death of his brother, Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick. Some of the countess&#x27; jointure manors lay in the castle&#x27;s vicinity, while at the same time they had been assigned to the younger Dudley&#x27;s inheritance by the overseers of Leicester&#x27;s will. After Warwick&#x27;s death in February 1590, lengthy legal proceedings ensued over whether particular parts of Lady Leicester&#x27;s jointure belonged to the Kenilworth estate or not.

In 1603, Dudley initiated moves to prove that he was the legitimate son of his parents and thus the heir to the earldoms of Warwick and Leicester. If successful, this claim would not only have implied that Lettice Knollys&#x27; union with Leicester had been bigamous, but would also have nullified her jointure rights. 

Consequently, in February 1604, she filed a complaint against Dudley in the Star Chamber, accusing him of defamation. She was backed by Sir Robert Sidney, who considered himself the only legitimate heir of his uncles Leicester and Warwick. During the Star Chamber proceedings 56 former servants and friends of the Earl of Leicester testified that he had always regarded Dudley as his illegitimate son. The other side was unable to cite clear evidence and the King&#x27;s chief minister, Robert Cecil, thought it unwise to rake up the existing property settlement, so the outcome was in favour of Lady Leicester. All the evidence was impounded to preclude a resumption of the case.

Throughout her life, Lettice Knollys cared for her siblings, children, and grandchildren. Until their respective deaths in 1607 and 1619, her daughters Penelope and Dorothy were her closest companions. The young third Earl of Essex, also called Robert, shared much of his life with the old Countess at Chartley and Drayton Bassett. 

Still walking a mile a day at nearly 90, she died in her chair on Christmas morning, 25 December 1634, aged 91. Widely mourned as a symbol of a by-gone age, she wished to be buried &quot;at Warwick by my dear lord and husband the Earl of Leicester with whom I desire to be entombed&quot;. Her request was respected and she came to rest in the Beauchamp Chapel of Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, opposite the tomb of her son, young Lord Denbigh.

An episode of the genealogical television series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; traced British comedian Josh Widdicombe&#x27;s ancestry in direct line to Knollys, via his grandmother, a member of the Barings family.

<text>Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that mediates the addition of phosphate molecules onto serine and threonine amino acid residues. First discovered in 1980 as a regulatory kinase for its namesake, glycogen synthase (GS), GSK-3 has since been identified as a protein kinase for over 100 different proteins in a variety of different pathways. In mammals, including humans, GSK-3 exists in two isozymes encoded by two homologous genes GSK-3α (GSK3A) and GSK-3β (GSK3B). GSK-3 has been the subject of much research since it has been implicated in a number of diseases, including type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, inflammation, cancer, addiction and bipolar disorder.

GSK-3 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylate either threonine or serine, and this phosphorylation controls a variety of biological activities, such as glycogen metabolism, cell signaling, cellular transport, and others. GS inhibition by GSK-3β leads to a decrease in glycogen synthesis in the liver and muscles, along with increased blood glucose or hyperglycemia. This is why GSK-3β is associated with the pathogenesis and progression of many diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, cancer, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. It is active in resting cells and is inhibited by several hormones such as insulin, endothelial growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor. Insulin indirectly inactivates GSK3 via downstream phosphorylation of the specific serine residues Ser21 and Ser9 in GSK-3 isoforms α and β, respectively via the PI3K/Akt pathway.

, GSK-3 is the only type of glycogen synthase kinase named and recognized. The gene symbols for GSK1 and GSK2 have been withdrawn by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), and no new names for these &quot;genes&quot; nor their locations have been specified.

==Mechanism==
GSK-3 functions by phosphorylating a serine or threonine residue on its target substrate. A positively charged pocket adjacent to the active site binds a &quot;priming&quot; phosphate group attached to a serine or threonine four residues C-terminal of the target phosphorylation site. The active site, at residues 181, 200, 97, and 85, binds the terminal phosphate of ATP and transfers it to the target location on the substrate (see figure 1).

==Glycogen synthase==
Glycogen synthase is an enzyme that is responsible in glycogen synthesis. It is activated by glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), and inhibited by glycogen synthase kinases (GSK3). Those two mechanisms play an important role in glycogen metabolism.

== Function ==
Phosphorylation of a protein by GSK-3 usually inhibits the activity of its downstream target. GSK-3 is active in a number of central intracellular signaling pathways, including cellular proliferation, migration, glucose regulation, and apoptosis.

GSK-3 was originally discovered in the context of its involvement in regulating glycogen synthase. After being primed by casein kinase 2 (CK2), glycogen synthase gets phosphorylated at a cluster of three C-terminal serine residues, reducing its activity. In addition to its role in regulating glycogen synthase, GSK-3 has been implicated in other aspects of glucose homeostasis, including the phosphorylation of insulin receptor IRS1 and of the gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6 phosphatase. However, these interactions have not been confirmed, as these pathways can be inhibited without the up-regulation of GSK-3.

GSK-3 has also been shown to regulate immune and migratory processes. GSK-3 participates in a number of signaling pathways in the innate immune response, including pro-inflammatory cytokine and interleukin production. The inactivation of GSK3B by various protein kinases also affects the adaptive immune response by inducing cytokine production and proliferation in naïve and memory CD4+ T cells. In cellular migration, an integral aspect of inflammatory responses, the inhibition of GSK-3 has been reported to play conflicting roles, as local inhibition at growth cones has been shown to promote motility while global inhibition of cellular GSK-3 has been shown to inhibit cell spreading and migration.

GSK-3 is also integrally tied to pathways of cell proliferation and apoptosis. GSK-3 has been shown to phosphorylate Beta-catenin, thus targeting it for degradation. GSK-3 is therefore a part of the canonical Beta-catenin/Wnt pathway, which signals the cell to divide and proliferate. GSK-3 phosphorylates cyclins D and E, which are important for the transition from G1 to S phase, and causes their degradation. The transcription factors c-myc and c-fos (also S phase promoters ), which are primarily phosphorylated by the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase, are also phosphorylated by GSK3, causing them to be degraded. GSK-3 also participates in a number of apoptotic signaling pathways by phosphorylating transcription factors that regulate apoptosis. GSK-3 can promote apoptosis by both activating pro-apoptotic factors such as p53 and inactivating survival-promoting factors through phosphorylation. The role of GSK-3 in regulating apoptosis is controversial, however, as some studies have shown that GSK-3β knockout mice are overly sensitized to apoptosis and die in the embryonic stage, while others have shown that overexpression of GSK-3 can induce apoptosis. Overall, GSK-3 appears to both promote and inhibit apoptosis, and this regulation varies depending on the specific molecular and cellular context.

GSK-3 is also involved in nuclear transcriptional activator kappa B (NFκB) signaling pathway, Hedgehog signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

Due to its importance across numerous cellular functions, GSK-3 activity is subject to tight regulation and is considered an &quot;Ace&quot; among kinases.

The speed and efficacy of GSK-3 phosphorylation is regulated by several factors. Phosphorylation of certain GSK-3 residues can increase or decrease its ability to bind substrate. Phosphorylation at tyrosine-216 in GSK-3β or tyrosine-279 in GSK-3α enhances the enzymatic activity of GSK-3, while phosphorylation of autoinhibitory serine-9 in GSK-3β or serine-21 in GSK-3α significantly decreases active site availability (see figure). Further, GSK-3 is unusual among kinases in that it usually requires a &quot;priming kinase&quot; to first phosphorylate a substrate. A phosphorylated serine or threonine residue located four amino acids C-terminal to the target site of phosphorylation allows the substrate to bind a pocket of positive charge formed by arginine and lysine residues.

Depending on the pathway in which it is being utilized, GSK-3 may be further regulated by cellular localization or the formation of protein complexes. The activity of GSK-3 is far greater in the nucleus and mitochondria than in the cytosol in cortical neurons, while the phosphorylation of Beta-catenin by GSK-3 is mediated by the binding of both proteins to Axin, a scaffold protein, allowing Beta-catenin to access the active site of GSK-3. 

Insulin indirectly inactivates GSK3 via downstream phosphorylation of the specific serine residues Ser21 and Ser9 in GSK-3 isoforms α and β, respectively, via the PI3K/Akt pathway (protein kinase B).

==Disease relevance==

Due to its involvement in a great number of signaling pathways, GSK-3 has been associated with a host of high-profile diseases. GSK-3 inhibitors are currently being tested for therapeutic effects in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), some forms of cancer, and bipolar disorder.

There is evidence that lithium, which is used as a treatment for bipolar disorder, acts as a mood stabilizer by selectively inhibiting GSK-3. The mechanism through which GSK-3 inhibition may stabilize mood is not known, though it is suspected that the inhibition of GSK-3&#x27;s ability to promote inflammation contributes to the therapeutic effect. Inhibition of GSK-3 also destabilises Rev-ErbA alpha transcriptional repressor, which has a significant role in the circadian clock. Elements of the circadian clock may be connected with predisposition to bipolar mood disorder.

GSK-3 activity has been associated with both pathological features of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, namely the buildup of amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. GSK-3 is thought to directly promote Aβ production and to be tied to the process of the hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, which leads to the tangles. Due to these roles of GSK-3 in promoting Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, GSK-3 inhibitors may have positive therapeutic effects on Alzheimer&#x27;s patients and are currently in the early stages of testing.

In a similar fashion, targeted inhibition of GSK-3 may have therapeutic effects on certain kinds of cancer. Though GSK-3 has been shown to promote apoptosis in some cases, it has also been reported to be a key factor in tumorigenesis in some cancers. Supporting this claim, GSK-3 inhibitors have been shown to induce apoptosis in glioma and pancreatic cancer cells. GSK-3 also seems to be responsible for NFκB aberrant activity in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and pancreatic cancer cells. In renal cancer cells, GSK-3 inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest, differentiation of the malignant cells, and autophagy. In contrast to the above neoplasms, high expression of inactive pGSK3β-S9 is found in skin, oral, and lung cancers, suggesting tumor suppressive effects of the enzyme in these cancers. In melanoma, the microRNA miR-769 inhibits GSK-3 activity during the tumor development process, also indicating tumor suppressive effects of GSK3.

GSK-3 inhibitors have also shown promise in the treatment of T2DM. Though GSK-3 activity under diabetic conditions can differ radically across different tissue types, studies have shown that introducing competitive inhibitors of GSK-3 can increase glucose tolerance in diabetic mice. GSK-3 inhibitors may also have therapeutic effects on hemorrhagic transformation after acute ischemic stroke. GSK-3 can negatively regulate the insulin signaling pathway by inhibiting IRS1 via phosphorylation of serine-332, rendering the insulin receptor incapable of activating IRS1 and further initiating the canonical PI3K/Akt pathway. The role that inhibition of GSK-3 might play across its other signaling roles is not yet entirely understood.

GSK-3 inhibition also mediates an increase in the transcription of the transcription factor Tbet (Tbx21) and an inhibition of the transcription of the inhibitory co-receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) on T-cells. GSK-3 inhibitors increased in vivo CD8(+) OT-I CTL function and the clearance of viral infections by murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 and lymphocytic choriomeningitis clone 13 as well as anti-PD-1 in immunotherapy.

== Inhibitors ==
Glycogen synthase kinase inhibitors are different chemotypes and have variable mechanisms of action; they may be cations, from natural sources, synthetic ATP and non-ATP competitive inhibitors and substrate-competitive inhibitors. GSK3 is a bi-lobar architecture with N-terminal and C-terminal, the N-terminal is responsible for ATP binding and C-terminal which is called as activation loop mediates the kinase activity, Tyrosine located at the C-terminal it essential for full GSK3 activity.

===Benefits of GSK-3β inhibitors===
In diabetes, GSK-3β inhibitors increase insulin sensitivity, glycogen synthesis, and glucose metabolism in skeletal muscles, and reduce obesity by affecting the adipogenesis process. GSK-3β is also over expressed in several types of cancers, like colorectal, ovarian, and prostate cancer. GSK-3β inhibitors also aid in the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, stroke, and mood disorders, including bipolar disorder. &quot;In vitro&quot; studies have shown the beneficial effects of GSK-3 inhibitors in lung cancer, ovarian cancer and neuroblastoma.

===Lithium===
Lithium which is used in the treatment of bipolar disorder was the first natural GSK-3 inhibitor discovered. It inhibits GSK-3 directly by competition with magnesium ions and indirectly by phosphorylation and auto-regulation of serine.
Lithium has been found to have insulin-like effects on glucose metabolism, including stimulation of glycogen synthesis in fat cells, skin, and muscles, increasing glucose uptake, and activation of GS activity. In addition to inhibition of GSK-3, it also inhibits other enzymes involved in the regulation of glucose metabolisms, such as myo-inositol-1-monophosphatase and 1,6 bisphosphatase. Also, it has shown therapeutic benefit in Alzheimer&#x27;s and other neurodegenerative diseases such as epileptic neurodegeneration.

===Naproxen and Cromolyn===
Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug while cromolyn is an anti-allergic agent which acts as a mast cell stabilizer. Both drugs have demonstrated the anticancer effect in addition to hypoglycemic effect due to inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β).

To validate the anti-GSK-3β hypothesis of naproxen and cromolyn, docking of the two structures against GSK-3β binding pocket and comparing their fitting with known GSK-3β inhibitor ARA014418 was performed, in addition to measuring the serum glucose, serum insulin, serum C-peptide, weight variation and hepatic glycogen levels for normal and diabetic fasting animal&#x27;s models to assess their in vitro hypoglycemic effects.

Naproxen and cromolyn were successfully docked into the binding site of GSK-3β (both were fitted into its binding pocket). They exhibited electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen-bonding interactions with key amino acids within the binding pocket with binding interaction profiles similar to AR-A014418 (the known inhibitor). The negative charges of the carboxylic acid groups in both drugs interact electrostatically with the positively charged guanidine group of Arg141. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding interactions between carboxylic acid moieties of cromolyn and the ammonium groups of Lys183 and Lys60, in addition to π-stacking of the naphthalene ring system of naproxen with the phenolic ring of Tyr134.

Antidiabetic effects of naproxen and cromolyn: In normal animal models, both drugs have shown dose-dependent reduction in blood glucose levels and rise in glycogen levels. In chronic type II diabetic model, glucose levels were also reduced, and glycogen level and insulin levels were elevated in a dose-dependent manner with a reduction in plasma glucose.

Anti-obesity effects of naproxen and cromolyn: Both drugs showed significant anti-obesity effects as they reduce body weight, resistin, and glucose levels in a dose-dependent manner. They were also found to elevate adiponectin, insulin, and C-peptide levels in a dose-dependent manner.

===Famotidine===
Famotidine is a specific, long-acting H2 antagonist that decreases gastric acid secretion. It is used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, GERD, and pathological hypersecretory conditions, like Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. (14,15) H2-receptor antagonists affect hormone metabolism, but their effect on glucose metabolism is not well established. (16) A study has revealed a glucose-lowering effect for famotidine.

The study of famotidine binding to the enzyme has showed that famotidine can be docked within the binding pocket of GSK-3β making significant interactions with key points within the GSK-3β binding pocket. Strong hydrogen bond interactions with the key amino acids PRO-136 and VAL -135 and potential hydrophobic interaction with LEU-188 were similar to those found in the ligand binding to the enzyme (AR-A014418).

Furthermore, famotidine showed high GSK-3β binding affinity and inhibitory activity due to interactions that stabilize the complex, namely hydrogen bonding of guanidine group in famotidine with the sulfahydryl moiety in CYS-199; and electrostatic interactions between the same guanidine group with the carboxyl group in ASP-200, the hydrogen bond between the terminal NH2 group, the OH of the TYR-143, and the hydrophobic interaction of the sulfur atom in the thioether with ILE-62. In vitro studies showed that famotidine inhibits GSK-3β activity and increases liver glycogen reserves in a dose dependent manner. A fourfold increase in the liver glycogen level with the use of the highest dose of famotidine (4.4 mg/kg) was observed. Also, famotidine has been shown to decrease serum glucose levels 30, and 60 minutes after oral glucose load in healthy individuals.

===Curcumin===
Curcumin, which Is a constituent of turmeric spice, has flavoring and coloring properties. It has two symmetrical forms: enol (the most abundant forms) and ketone.

Curcumin has wide pharmacological activities: anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, hypoglycemic, anti-oxidant, and wound healing effects. In animal models with Alzheimer disease, it has anti-destructive effect of beta amyloid in the brain, and recently it shows anti-malarial activity.

Curcumin also has chemo preventative and anti-cancer effects, and it has been shown to attenuate oxidative stress and renal dysfunction in diabetic animals with chronic use.

Curcumin&#x27;s mechanism of action is anti-inflammatory; it inhibits the nuclear transcriptional activator kappa B (NF-KB) that is activated whenever there is inflammatory response.

NF-kB has two regulatory factors, IkB and GSK-3, which suggests curcumin directly binds and inhibits GSK-3B. An in vitro study confirmed GSK-3B inhibition by simulating molecular docking using a silico docking technique. The concentration at which 50% of GK-3B would be inhibited by curcumin is 66.3 nM.

Among its two forms, experimental and theoretical studies show that the enol form is the favored form due to its intra-molecular hydrogen bonding, and an NMR experiment show that enol form exist in a variety of solvents.

===Olanzapine===
Antipsychotic medications are increasingly used for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions Atypical antipsychotics are more commonly used than first generation antipsychotics because they decrease the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, such as tardive dyskinesia, and have better efficacy.

Olanzapine and atypical antipsychotics induce weight gain through increasing body fat. It also affects glucose metabolism, and several studies shows that it may worsen diabetes.

A recent study shows that olanzapine inhibits GSK3 activity, suggesting olanzapine permits glycogen synthesis. A study of the effect of olanzapine on mouse blood glucose and glycogen levels showed a significant decrease in blood glucose level and elevation of glycogen level in mice, and the IC50% of olanzapine were 91.0 nm, which is considered a potent inhibitor. The study also illustrates that sub-chronic use of olanzapine results in potent inhibition of GSK3.

===Pyrimidine derivatives===
Pyrimidine analogues are antimetabolites that interfere with nucleic acid synthesis. Some of them have been shown to fit the ATP-binding pocket of GSK-3β to lower blood glucose levels and improve some neuronal diseases.

<text>Patrick John Noonan (born August 2, 1980) is an American soccer coach and former player. He is the head coach of FC Cincinnati in Major League Soccer.

==Playing career==

===College and amateur===
Noonan attended De Smet Jesuit High School, and played college soccer for the Indiana University Hoosiers from 1999 to 2002. He was named an NSCAA first-team All-American his senior and junior seasons, and second-team All-American his sophomore year. His senior year, he also finished as runner-up to Alecko Eskandarian for the Hermann Trophy. He finished his career at Indiana with 48 goals and 31 assists. During his college years, Noonan also played with the Mid-Michigan Bucks in the USL Premier Development League

===Club===
====New England Revolution====
Upon graduation, Noonan was selected in the first round (9th overall) of the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by New England Revolution. He made his MLS debut in the 2003 season opener on April 13, coming on as a 92nd minute substitute for Daniel Hernandez in a 1-1 draw against the Chicago Fire. He recorded his first assist on April 19 in a 2-1 loss to the Columbus Crew. Noonan made his first start on May 31, in a 2-2 draw with the Kansas City Wizards, and scored his first Revolution goal in a 3-3 draw against the MetroStars on July 12. Although he started slowly, Noonan soon resumed his scoring ways, finishing his first season with the Revs with ten goals and seven assists in 28 appearances, and runner-up to Damani Ralph for Rookie of the Year. He was additionally named MLS Player of the Week twice, in weeks 24 and 30, and named MLS Player of the Month for the month of October.

Noonan did even better his sophomore year, the 2004 season, scoring eleven goals and registering eight assists, tying with Amado Guevara for the MLS Scoring Champion Award. He was additionally named MLS Player of the Week for matchweek 10. Alongside three other Revolution players, Noonan was named a 2004 MLS All-Star.

Injuries and a late-season slump saw Noonan end 2005 with eight goals and seven assists, being named MLS Player of the Week for matchweek 13, and representing the Revolution in the 2005 MLS All-Star Game.

Noonan&#x27;s 2006 campaign was marred by injury and he appeared in only 14 games, netting just one goal. He began in 2007 injured once again and then became a substitute as he regained his fitness. However, he rounded into form and finished the season with 7 goals. Noonan also helped the Revolution win the 2007 U.S. Open Cup, the first piece of silverware in club history, scoring a goal and providing two assists in the final.

Noonan&#x27;s option for the 2008 season was not picked up by New England and on January 23, 2008, he signed with Norwegian club Aalesunds FK.

====Columbus Crew====
On August 6, 2008, Noonan re-signed with MLS and was traded from New England, who still retained his rights, to Columbus Crew in exchange for the Crew&#x27;s natural first-round selection in the 2009 MLS SuperDraft and allocation money. Additionally, the teams traded spots in the current 2008 allocation standings – with Columbus moving into the 10th spot and New England moving to third – and agreed to considerations regarding 2009 allocation rankings. For Columbus Crew, Noonan won the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield, MLS Cup and Trillium Cup, all of them in 2008.

====Colorado Rapids====
Noonan was traded to Colorado Rapids in June 2009. After making seventeen league appearances, Noonan was waived by Colorado on March 23, 2010.

====Seattle Sounders FC====
After a short trial with Seattle Sounders FC, Noonan signed with the club on March 30, 2010. He remained with Seattle through the 2011 season. At season&#x27;s end, the club declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft.

====LA Galaxy====
Noonan was selected by Los Angeles Galaxy in stage two of the draft on December 12, 2011. Eleven days later he signed with Los Angeles.

Noonan remained with Los Angeles through the 2012 season. After the conclusion of the 2012 season, LA declined the 2013 option on Noonan&#x27;s contract and he entered the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft. Noonan became a free agent after he went undrafted in both rounds of the draft. On January 11, 2013, LA announced that Noonan had retired as a player and had joined the club as an assistant coach.

===International===

Noonan earned his first cap for the United States national team on March 13, 2004, against Haiti. While he has accumulated 15 caps, injuries and inconsistency prevented him from claiming a major role with the national team. He was named an alternate for the 2006 U.S. World Cup squad on May 2, 2006. However, in early 2008 he started with the U.S. National Team against Sweden and registered an assist in a 2–0 victory. He did not play for the national team after 2008.

====International goals====
==Coaching career==
===United States national team===
After Noonan&#x27;s retirement as a player, he joined the Galaxy&#x27;s technical staff as an assistant coach to Bruce Arena. When Arena was announced as returning to be the head coach of the United States national team, he brought his supporting staff from the Galaxy, including Noonan, to work as assistants.

===Philadelphia Union===
In January 2018, Noonan was hired as an assistant coach alongside Jim Curtin at the Philadelphia Union.

===FC Cincinnati===
Noonan was named head coach of FC Cincinnati on December 14, 2021. The team had previously finished last in the regular season standings in their prior MLS seasons. Noonan, along with new general manager Chris Albright, oversaw 24 player changes and the hiring of assistants Kenny Arena and Dominic Kinnear.

He led Cincinnati to fifth place in the Eastern Conference as they clinched their first-ever MLS Cup Playoff berth, Noonan&#x27;s Orange and Blue beat New York Red Bulls on the road 2–1 before falling to the Philadelphia Union, 1–0, in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. 

In the 2023 season, Noonan guided Cincinnati to their first trophy in MLS, finishing top of the league standings, clinching the Supporters&#x27; Shield and their second consecutive playoff berth. In the playoffs, Cincinnati made it to the Eastern Conference Finals, falling to the Columbus Crew 3–2. Noonan was named the MLS Coach of the Year on November 21, 2023.

<doc id="1113580" wikidata="Q719599" url="?curid=1113580" title="Option contract">
<text>An option contract, or simply option, is defined as &quot;a promise which meets the requirements for the formation of a contract and limits the promisor&#x27;s power to revoke an offer&quot;. Option contracts are common in relation to property (see below) and in professional sports.

An option contract is a type of contract that protects an offeree from an offeror&#x27;s ability to revoke their offer to engage in a contract.

Under the common law, consideration for the option contract is required as it is still a form of contract, cf. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 87(1). Typically, an offeree can provide consideration for the option contract by paying money for the contract or by providing value in some other form such as by rendering other performance or forbearance. Courts will generally try to find consideration if there are any grounds for doing so. See consideration for more information. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) has eliminated a need for consideration for firm offers between merchants in some limited circumstances.

==Introduction==
An option is the right to convey a piece of property. The person granting the option is called the &quot;optionor&quot; (or more usually, the &quot;grantor&quot;) and the person who has the benefit of the option is called the &quot;optionee&quot; (or more usually, the &quot;beneficiary&quot;).

Because options amount to dispositions of future property, in common law countries they are normally subject to the rule against perpetuities and must be exercised within the time limits prescribed by law.

In relation to certain types of asset (principally land), in many countries an option must be registered in order to be binding on a third party.

==Application of option contract in unilateral contracts==

The option contract provides an important role in unilateral contracts. In unilateral contracts, the promisor seeks acceptance by performance from the promisee. In this scenario, the classical contract view was that a contract was not formed until the performance that the promisor seeks was &quot;completely&quot; performed. This was because the consideration for the contract was the performance of the promisee. Once the promisee performed completely, consideration was satisfied and a contract was formed and only the promisor was bound to his promise.

A problem arose with unilateral contracts because of the late formation of the contract. With classical unilateral contracts, a promisor can revoke his offer for the contract at any point prior to the promisee&#x27;s complete performance. So, if a promisee provides 99% of the performance sought, the promisor could then revoke without any remedy for the promisee. The promisor had maximum protection and the promisee had maximum risk in this scenario.

The modern view of how option contracts apply now provides some security to the promisee in the above scenario. Essentially, once a promisee begins performance, an option contract is implicitly created between the promisor and the promisee. The promisor impliedly promises &quot;not&quot; to revoke the offer and the promisee impliedly promises to furnish complete performance, but as the name suggests, the promisee still retains the &quot;option&quot; of not completing performance. The consideration for this option contract is discussed in comment d of the above cited section. Basically, the consideration is provided by the promisee&#x27;s beginning of performance.

Case law differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but an option contract can either be implicitly created instantaneously at the beginning of performance (the Restatement view) or after some &quot;substantial performance&quot;. &quot;Cook v. Coldwell Banker/Frank Laiben Realty Co.&quot;, 967 S.W.2d 654 (Mo. App. 1998). Case law in England and Wales has established that in exercising an option, a grantee &quot;must comply strictly with the conditions for its exercise&quot;.

It has been hypothesized that option contracts could help allow free market roads to be constructed without resorting to eminent domain, as the road company could make option contracts with many landowners, and eventually consummate the purchase of parcels comprising the contiguous route needed to build the road.

==Assignability==
It is a general principle of contract law that an offer cannot be assigned by the recipient of the offer to another party. However, an option contract can be sold (unless it provides otherwise), allowing the buyer of the option to step into the shoes of the original offeree and accept the offer to which the option pertains.

== Contract theory ==
In economics, option contracts play an important role in the field of contract theory. In particular, Oliver Hart (1995, p. 90) has shown that option contracts can mitigate the hold-up problem (an underinvestment problem that occurs when the exact level of investment cannot be contractually specified). However, there is a debate in contract theory whether option contracts are still useful when the contractual parties cannot rule out future renegotiations. As has been pointed out by Tirole (1999), this debate is at the center of the discussions about the foundations of the incomplete contracts theory. In a laboratory experiment, Hoppe and Schmitz (2011) have confirmed that non-renegotiable option contracts can indeed solve the hold-up problem. Moreover, it turns out that option contracts are still useful even when renegotiation cannot be ruled out. The latter observation can be explained by Hart and Moore’s (2008) idea that an important role of contracts is to serve as reference points.

<text>The United States maintained its Constitutional Republic government structure throughout World War II. Certain expediencies were taken within the existing structure of the Federal government, such as conscription and other violations of civil liberties, including the internment and later dispersal of Japanese-Americans. Still, elections were held as scheduled in 1944.

==Overview==
The United States entered World War II with the Administration that had been at the helm of the nation since 1932, that of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This administration had been preparing for war for a while by the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.

==President of the United States==
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace won the election of 1940, and were at the helm of the nation as it prepared for and entered World War II. Roosevelt sought and won an unprecedented fourth term in office in 1944, but this time with Harry S. Truman as his Vice President. Roosevelt, who had been a victim of Guillain-Barré Syndrome early in life, died in April 1945, and Truman assumed the Presidency through the end of the war.

<doc id="1113588" wikidata="Q5105702" url="?curid=1113588" title="Chris Albertson">
<text>Christiern Gunnar Albertson (October 18, 1931 – April 24, 2019) was a New York City-based jazz journalist, writer and record producer.

==Early life==

Albertson was born in Reykjavík, Iceland, on October 18, 1931, but his father left the family before he was a year old. Yvonne, his mother, married three more times. He was educated in Iceland, Denmark and England before studying commercial art in Copenhagen.

In 1947, while living in Copenhagen, Albertson listened by chance to a Bessie Smith recording on radio; it led to an abiding interest in jazz and blues music. &quot;We found magic in such names as Kid Ory, King Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey,&quot; he wrote on his &quot;Stomp Off&quot; blog in 2010.

On his home tape machine, Albertson recorded visiting British New Orleans revivalists Ken Colyer, Chris Barber and Lonnie Donegan in 1953. These recordings were subsequently released on the Danish Storyville Records and British Tempo Records labels.

==Career==

In 1957, after two years as a disc jockey for Armed Forces Radio at Keflavík Air Base, in Iceland, Albertson migrated to the United States, initially working for radio stations in Philadelphia. At WCAU (a CBS affiliate) and WHAT-FM, a 24-hour jazz station, he conducted interviews, including one with Lester Young, one of only two extant with the tenor saxophonist. He was naturalised as an American citizen in 1963.

In 1960–61, Albertson was employed by Riverside Records&#x27; Bill Grauer as a producer. In this capacity, he arranged and recorded the last sessions of blues singer Ida Cox (whom he brought out of retirement) and boogie-woogie pianist Meade Lux Lewis, and supervised the label&#x27;s &#x27;Living Legends&#x27; series of location recordings. The initial albums in this series were made in New Orleans and featured such early jazz musicians as pianist Sweet Emma Barrett, clarinetist Louis Cottrell, Jr., trumpeters Percy Humphrey and Kid Thomas, blues duo Billie and De de Pierce, and trombonist Jim Robinson. He continued the series in Chicago, with performances by Lil Armstrong, Alberta Hunter, Little Brother Montgomery, and Earl Hines.

Albertson subsequently worked as producer for Prestige Records, supervising sessions by, among others, guitarist/singer Lonnie Johnson, whom he had pulled from obscurity while working in Philadelphia. He also founded his own production company, supervising sessions with Howard McGhee, Roy Eldridge, Bud Freeman, Ray Bryant, and Elmer Snowden.

In the mid-1960s, Albertson worked at NYC radio station WNEW, leaving there for Pacifica Radio&#x27;s NY station WBAI, where he eventually became General Manager. In 1967, he worked for the BBC in London, advising them on how to adapt their radio programs for sale in North America.

In 1971, Albertson co-produced and hosted &quot;The Jazz Set&quot;, a weekly television program that was aired from coast to coast by Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Public television and featured such guests as Charles Mingus, Bill Evans, Randy Weston, Jimmy Heath, and Ray Bryant.

At this time, he was also producing reissues for Columbia Records, including the complete Bessie Smith LP sets. His work on these albums won Albertson 1971 two Grammy awards (one in the Best Album Notes category for &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Blues Singer&quot; and a Grammy Trustees Award), a Billboard Trendsetter Award and the Montreux Jazz Festival&#x27;s Grand Prix du Disque.

His standard work, &quot;Bessie&quot;, a biography of Bessie Smith, first appeared in 1972, with a revised and expanded version published by Yale University Press in 2003. The revised biography was inducted into the Blues Foundation&#x27;s Blues Hall of Fame in the &quot;Classic of Blues Literature Hall of Fame&quot; category in May 2012. In 2015, HBO premiered a biopic, &quot;Bessie&quot;, starring Queen Latifah in the title role, but Albertson&#x27;s book was not credited as its basis. 

Albertson wrote television documentaries, including &quot;The Story of Jazz&quot; and &quot;My Castle&#x27;s Rocking&quot; (a bio-documentary on Alberta Hunter), as well as articles and reviews for various publications, including &quot;Saturday Review&quot; and &quot;Down Beat&quot;. He was a contributing editor for &quot;Stereo Review&quot; magazine for 28 years.

Albertson was found dead in his Manhattan apartment on April 24, 2019.

<text>Macquarie Fields is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Macquarie Fields is located 38 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Campbelltown and is part of the Macarthur region.

Macquarie Fields is surrounded by bushland. Nearby Macquarie Links, is a high-security housing estate beside an international standard golf course. The suburb has multiple high schools including Macquarie Fields High School and James Meehan High School.

==History==
The original inhabitants of the Macquarie Fields area were the Darug people of western Sydney. The rich soil of the area was home to an abundance of plants which in turn attracted animals such as kangaroos and emus, both of which along with this part with yams and other native vegetables and fruit were part of the diet of the Darug. They lived in small huts called gunyahs, made spears, tomahawks and boomerangs for hunting and had an elaborate system of tribal law and rituals with its origins in the Dreamtime. However, following the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, they were pushed off their land by the British settlers.

Macquarie Fields was named by early landholder James Meehan in honour of the Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie. The area was surveyed by Meehan in the early 19th century. Although transported to Australia as a convict for his role in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, Meehan had trained as a surveyor in Ireland and in 1803 was appointed an assistant to NSW Surveyor-General Charles Grimes. In 1806 he was granted a full pardon and in 1810 became Surveyor-General. For his work, he was granted a number of parcels of land including in what is now Macquarie Fields and neighbouring suburbs. He used the rich soil to grow cereal crops, fruit trees and to graze livestock.

The property changed hands a couple of times after Meehan&#x27;s death and in the 1840s, Samuel Terry built a Regency mansion, Macquarie Fields House, which still stands to this day. It is now listed on the Register of the National Estate. In 1883, then owner William Phillips subdivided the land to create a new town he called Glenwood Estate with grand boulevards and fine buildings. A railway station was added to the line in 1888 but the depression of the 1890s meant the grand town failed to materialize with only a few small houses built on the lots. In the next Great Depression of the 1930s, the area became popular with the homeless who made makeshift huts, not unlike those of the earlier Darug people.

After World War II, the village grew steadily. A public school was opened in 1958 and by 1971, the population reached 3700. In the mid-1970s, a large Housing Commission development was built on the east side of town and given the suburb names of Bunbury (later Guise) and Curran after the local creek. Residents of the privately owned areas of Macquarie Fields were strongly opposed to the new developments being included in their suburb and this continued well into the 1980s. Since that time, local authorities have tried to blend the area into a single suburb. Private housing developments sprung up further around and the weight of population contributed to a larger town centre.

===21st century===
In 2005, riots were sparked by a high-speed police pursuit on 25 February through the Glenquarie housing estate in Macquarie Fields. The chase resulted in the driver, 20-year-old Jesse Kelly, crashing the stolen vehicle into a tree and killing his two passengers, 17-year-old Dylan Raywood and 19-year-old Matthew Robertson.

<doc id="1113592" wikidata="Q5095471" url="?curid=1113592" title="Chicago 18">
<text>Chicago 18 is the fifteenth studio album by the American rock band Chicago, released on September 29, 1986. This album is the first without original vocalist Peter Cetera, and the first to feature Jason Scheff on bass and vocals.

With Cetera having left the band in 1985 for a solo career, Chicago eventually hired Scheff to fill Cetera&#x27;s position as vocalist and bassist. With Scheff and Bill Champlin, who had joined the band in 1981, the most prominent voices in Chicago now belonged to its two newest recruits.

Chicago again hired producer David Foster to create a followup to &quot;Chicago 17&quot;.

The band recorded an updated, high-tech remake of their classic &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; (#48). Scheff recalled when he asked Foster on the way he should sing the song, the latter responded: &quot;Just like Cetera.&quot; The following singles, &quot;Will You Still Love Me?&quot; (#3) and &quot;If She Would Have Been Faithful...&quot; (#17) became hits. Scheff was lead vocalist on all three releases. The album also features a brief instrumental horn riff, Pankow&#x27;s &quot;Free Flight.&quot; 

Despite the success of its predecessor, &quot;Chicago 18&quot; ultimately only went gold, peaking at #35 on the Billboard Top 200 charts.

==Reception==

&quot;Chicago 18&quot; (Full Moon/Warner Bros. 25509) reached gold status and #35 in the US during a chart stay of 45 weeks. It did not chart in the UK.

<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp is an American air-cooled radial aircraft engine. It displaces and its bore and stroke are both . The design traces its history to 1929 experiments at Pratt &amp; Whitney on twin-row designs. Production began in 1932 and it was widely used during the 1930s.

It was selected as the power plant for both the four-engined Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber and the twin-engined Douglas DC-3 transport, two of the most-produced aircraft. The production run of 173,618 R-1830 examples makes it the most-produced aviation engine in history.

A further developed version, the R-2000, was produced starting in 1942. The R-2000 was &quot;bored-out&quot; to and had a number of other minor changes to improve fuel economy and allow it to run at higher power ratings on lower-octane fuel. The primary user of the R-2000 was the Douglas DC-4.

Mostly retired today, the R-1830 is still used on Douglas DC-3 and various museum aircraft and warbirds seen at airshows. It is not manufactured anymore, but spares are still available and there is still a market for second-hand engines and parts.

<doc id="1113607" wikidata="Q7497306" url="?curid=1113607" title="Shindig!">
<text>Shindig! was an American musical variety series which aired on ABC from September 16, 1964 to January 8, 1966. The show was hosted by Jimmy O&#x27;Neill, a disc jockey in Los Angeles, who created the show along with his wife Sharon Sheeley, British producer Jack Good, and production executive Art Stolnitz. The original pilot was rejected by ABC and David Sontag, then executive producer of ABC, redeveloped and completely redesigned the show. A new pilot with a new cast of artists was shot starring Sam Cooke. That pilot aired as the premiere episode.

==Synopsis==

&quot;Shindig!&quot; was conceived as a short-notice replacement for &quot;Hootenanny,&quot; a series which specialized in folk revival music. The folk revival had fizzled in 1964 as the result of the British Invasion, which damaged the ratings for &quot;Hootenanny&quot; and prompted that show&#x27;s cancellation.

&quot;Shindig!&quot; focused on a broader variety of popular music than its predecessor and first aired for a half-hour every Wednesday evening, but was expanded to an hour in January 1965. In the fall of 1965, the show split into two half-hour telecasts, on Thursday and Saturday nights.

&quot;Shindig!&quot;&#x27;s premiere episode was actually the second pilot, and featured Sam Cooke, The Everly Brothers, and The Righteous Brothers. Later shows featured performances taped in Britain - A set was used at Twickenham Film Studios, where British acts performed live for the cameras, with the resultant footage flown back to be shown on the program. The first UK episode had The Beatles as the guests. The series later featured other &quot;British invasion&quot; bands and performers including The Who, The Rolling Stones, and Cilla Black. &quot;Shindig!&quot; continued to broadcast episodes with footage shot in London throughout its run. This meant many acts were seen on U.S television before they actually went to America (The Who in particular, who performed a unique early version of &quot;My Generation&quot; live, two months before the single version was recorded).

Many other popular performers of the day played on &quot;Shindig!&quot; including Tina Turner, Lesley Gore, Bo Diddley, Sonny and Cher, The Beach Boys, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, The Supremes, and The Ronettes.

&quot;Shindig!&quot;&#x27;s success prompted NBC to air the similar series &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; starting in January 1965 and other producers to launch syndicated rock music shows like &quot;Shivaree&quot; and &quot;Hollywood a Go-Go.&quot;

In March 1965, Little Eva performed a live but short version of her hit song &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;. This is the only known video clip of her singing it.

Toward the end of the program&#x27;s run, The Mamas and the Papas appeared in an episode featuring Barry McGuire. Although serving as his backup singers, the group introduced &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;&quot; on that program, which launched its career.

&quot;Shindig!&quot; is one of the few rock music shows of the era to still have all episodes available to watch.

==Final season==
In September 1965, the show was moved out of its Wednesday-night time slot (where it gave &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; its first serious competition in its time period among younger viewers), and split into two half-hours on new days and times (Thursdays and Saturdays at 7:30 P.M. Eastern time). The show faced tough competition from &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; and &quot;The Munsters&quot; on Thursdays along with &quot;Flipper&quot; and &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; on Saturdays. Additionally, the Saturday edition aired in a time period when many of its potential viewers were going out and, thus, not at home to watch television. By October 1965, the show was having ratings problems (&quot;Time&quot; magazine said &quot;early-season tide [was] running against the teen scene&quot;), and in January 1966, &quot;Shindig!&quot; was cancelled and replaced in its Thursday time slots by &quot;Batman.&quot;

==Series regulars==
&quot;Shindig!&quot; also featured a dance troupe choreographed by David Winters and André Tayir, who accompanied the music acts of the week (Winters later worked on the competing NBC show &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;). One of the regular dancers was Teri Garr, who went on to find success as an actress. Others included Anita Mann, Maria Gahva, Lorene Yarnell (later of the mime team Shields and Yarnell), Diane Stuart, Pam Freeman, Gina Trikinis, Marianna Picora, Virginia Justus, Rini Jarmon and Carol Shelyne, who always wore glasses while she danced. Occasionally, a small group of dancers who sang would get a featured spot; this rotating group was billed as The Shindig Girls. The assistant choreographer was Antonia Basilotta, better known as Toni Basil, who later gained fame with her 1980s hit song &quot;Mickey&quot;. Both Garr and Basil were dance students of David Winters at the time and worked with him on most of his choreography projects.

The series house band was supposedly known as &quot;The Shin-diggers&quot;, but that was actually the name host Jimmy O&#x27;Neill used to refer to fans of the show. At first, TV credits identified the musicians simply as the Shindig Band. By early 1965, they&#x27;d been renamed Sir Rufus Marion Banks and his Band of Men, but the generic name had returned by the time &quot;Shindig&quot; went off the air. The rhythm section was spun off into a featured group and named the &quot;Shindogs&quot;. It included Joey Cooper on bass, Chuck Blackwell on drums, James Burton on lead guitar, Delaney Bramlett on rhythm guitar and Glen D. Hardin on keyboards. Cooper and Bramlett traded off lead vocal duties. The larger band featured Jerry Cole on lead guitar, Russ Titelman on rhythm guitar, Larry Knechtel on bass, Leon Russell on piano, Julius Wechter on percussion and Ritchie Frost on drums. Later, Billy Preston took over keyboards and performed as a singing regular. Glen Campbell was not a regular member of this band but a frequent guest performer. Ray Pohlman was the musical director, and he was also one - as was Campbell, Knechtel, Wechter and Russell - of the collection of first-call pop studio musicians that would later be known as &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;. In some instances when one of the guitarists was unable to work, Pohlman would bring in Bill Aken to fill in.

The Righteous Brothers, Dick and Dee Dee, Jackie and Gayle, Donna Loren, Willy Nelson (not the famous Country singer Willie Nelson) and Bobby Sherman were regular vocalists on the series. Up until July 1965, when he quit the show, producer Jack Good was also a regular, wearing a bowler hat and improvising comedy routines with Jimmy O&#x27;Neill at the close of each episode.

The Blossoms, an all-female vocal group featuring Darlene Love, backed up many of the performers and were occasionally featured in spotlight performances. The Wellingtons were a trio of male singers who performed on their own, and as backup singers. Another male group, The Eligibles, sometimes alternated with The Wellingtons on backup.

*&quot;Shindig!&quot; made an appearance on a December 1965 episode of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; as &quot;Shinrock!&quot; with host &quot;Jimmy O&#x27;Neillstone&quot; (O&#x27;Neill provided his own voice). The episode featured musical guests The Beau Brummels, appearing as &quot;The Beau Brummelstones&quot;, who performed their hit song &quot;Laugh, Laugh&quot;. Fred turns off the show, saying &quot;Let me take care of Jimmy O&#x27;Neillstone,&quot; whereupon O&#x27;Neillstone&#x27;s hand reaches out from the set and turns it back on. &quot;Well,&quot; Barney quips, &quot;that&#x27;s one way of keeping up their ratings.&quot;

*&quot;The Shindogs&quot; were a rock group parody on an episode of &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot; (&quot;Partying Is Such Sweet Sorrow&quot;, Sept. 29, 1965), when Patty sang, &quot;Funny Little Butterflies.&quot;

<text>Giovanni Giuseppe Goria (30 July 1943 – 21 May 1994) was an Italian politician. He served as the 46th prime minister of Italy from 1987 until 1988.

==Biography==

===Background and early life===
Goria was born in Asti (Piedmont).

Goria was an accountant by profession. He joined the Christian Democracy in 1960 and entered local politics. He was elected to the chamber of deputies in 1976. He was undersecretary of the budget from 1981 until 1983 and then became treasury minister. He became known for his easygoing style and his adeptness at television appearances.

===Prime Minister of Italy===
Following the elections of 1987, in which his party did well, Goria became prime minister (the youngest his country had seen since World War II), as a protégé of party chairman (and prime ministerial successor) Ciriaco De Mita. He was forced to resign in 1988 after the Parliament refused to pass his budget.

===Later political roles===

Goria was elected to the European Parliament in 1989. He resigned in 1991 to become Italian minister of agriculture. He remained in that position until 1992 when he became finance minister.

He resigned in 1993 during a corruption scandal which ruined his party. Goria himself was charged with corruption. His trial began in early 1994. He was acquitted of one charge, but his trial was still in progress when he died suddenly of lung cancer in his native Asti on 21 May 1994.

<text>University of Wollongong Malaysia (Formerly known as KDU University College) is a private university in Malaysia, with its campus in Utropolis Glenmarie, Shah Alam. Established in 1983, and a pioneer in Malaysian private education, UOW Malaysia was one of the first private colleges in Malaysia to have its own purpose-built campus. UOW Malaysia offers education programs at the Certificate, Diploma, Degree and Masters levels.

UOW Malaysia is part of the University of Wollongong Australia’s global network, but has a history of providing tertiary education to Malaysia, and the surrounding regions, as it was previously known as KDU college and university colleges. UOW Global Enterprises, a wholly-owned subsidiary of University of Wollongong Australia, in September 2019 acquired the KDU institutions and following a process of transformation integrated them into the University of Wollongong Australia global network of campuses located in Australia, Dubai, Hong Kong, and now here in Malaysia.

==History==

Established in 1983, and a pioneer in Malaysian private education, KDU was one of the first private colleges in Malaysia to have its own purpose-built campus in Damansara Jaya. Kolej Damansara Utama (as it was first known) opened for enrolment, offering programs such as the GCE A-Level and the American Credit Transfer program, and welcomed its first batch of students. In 1984, KDU introduced the first overseas twinning program in partnership with Middlesex Polytechnic (Middlesex University).

In 1991, a second branch (KDU Penang University College) was established in Penang to cater to the higher education needs of aspiring youths in the northern region.

In November 2010, KDU College was upgraded to University College status by the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, and began offering specialised homegrown degree programs. The ceremony was officiated by the Minister of Higher Education, Mohamed Khaled Nordin.

In 2016, KDU Penang University College had a groundbreaking ceremony to unveil construction plans for a 10-acre campus in Batu Kawan, Penang. The ceremony was officiated by then Chief Minister of Penang Lim Guan Eng and was accompanied by representatives from Penang Development Corporations (PDC).

Subsequently, in November 2019, the name of the college and university colleges were changed to reflect the stewardship of the University of Wollongong and they are now known as UOW Malaysia. UOW plans to develop the UOW Malaysia campuses at Glenmarie, George Town Penang, and Batu Kawan Penang into universities within the next five to seven years. Both university colleges offer programs from Foundation through to Bachelor’s Degrees and Postgraduate programs. These include programs in Business, Communication, Creative Arts, Computing, Game Development, Engineering, Hospitality, Tourism, Culinary Arts, and Nursing.

In 2023, UOW Malaysia received university status from the Ministry of Higher Education.

==Academic structure==
UOW Malaysia employs academic staff that meets the requirement of both its partner institutions as well as the Malaysian Qualification Agency&#x27;s requirement, with PhD and master&#x27;s degree holders teaching in degree programs and a minimum of a degree to teach in the certificate and diploma programs.

<doc id="1113636" wikidata="Q349148" url="?curid=1113636" title="Ricardo Clark">
<text>Ricardo Anthony Clark (born February 10, 1983) is an American former soccer player who played as a midfielder. He appeared for MetroStars, San Jose Earthquakes, Houston Dynamo and Columbus Crew SC in the United States, Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany, and Stabæk in Norway. Clark also appeared for the United States national team.

A native of Atlanta, Clark played two years in college at Furman before being drafted second overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by MetroStars. After two seasons and nearly 100 appearances, he was traded to San Jose Earthquakes. The franchise moved from San Jose to Houston for the 2006 season, becoming the Houston Dynamo, and Clark followed along. He spent four seasons with the Dynamo, helping the club win two MLS Cups, before departing for Europe. Clark spent three years in Europe, playing for Eintracht Frankfurt and Stabæk, before returning to the United States and the Dynamo midway through the 2012 Major League Soccer season. He spent the next six years in Houston, departing at the end of 2017 with 304 appearances for the Dynamo across his two spells. Clark signed as a free agent with Columbus Crew SC, spending his final two professional seasons with the Crew before retiring following the 2019 season.

At international level, Clark appeared for the United States at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship. He earned his first senior cap in October 2005 against Panama, and went on to score three goals in 34 caps for his country. Clark represented the United States at two CONCACAF Gold Cups, helped the U.S. to the final of the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, and played at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He earned his final senior cap in January 2012.

==Youth and college==
Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Clark attended St. Pius X Catholic High School. He is of Trinidadian descent through his father. He was a two-time state champion and state player of the year with the Golden Lions, winning GHSA titles as a sophomore and senior and State Player of the Year nods as a junior and senior. His senior season, St. Pius X went 22–1 while Clark was named as a Parade All-American. At club level, he won two state titles with AFC Lightning and was named as the MVP of the 2000 Adidas ESP Camp. Clark committed to play college soccer at Furman University, part of a recruiting class ranked fourth in the nation.

Clark played only two collegiate seasons at Furman, making 37 appearances and notching three goals for the Paladins. In just his second collegiate game, he provided an assist to John Barry Nusum as part of a 3–2 victory over Notre Dame. Clark suffered through a foot injury during the second half of his freshman season, finishing the year with 15 appearances. His first goal for Furman had to wait until his sophomore season, during a 4–3 victory in overtime against UNC Greensboro. That goal came on September 21, 2002; Clark also scored on September 27 against Fairfield and October 27 against South Carolina. He finished the season with three goals in 22 appearances, and was named as an NSCAA first team all-American. Clark was also named to the NSCAA all-South Region first team, the College Soccer News all-America first team, and as a Soccer America MVP to conclude the season.

==Club career==
===MetroStars===
Following his sophomore year at Furman, Clark signed a Project-40 contract with Major League Soccer and entered the 2003 MLS SuperDraft, where he was selected second overall by MetroStars. He stepped immediately into the starting lineup for the Metros, making his professional debut on April 12, 2003, against Columbus Crew. Clark would go on to set a club rookie record, starting the first 27 games of the season, and making 28 total appearances in MLS play. In the midst of that stretch, he had a run of three goals in four games: against Chicago Fire on June 28, D.C. United on July 5, and New England Revolution on July 12. Clark also played a large role for the club in their run to the 2003 U.S. Open Cup Final, where they were defeated 1–0 by Chicago. After appearing 35 times in all competitions with three goals, Clark was named a finalist for the MLS Rookie of the Year Award; he lost out to Damani Ralph of Chicago.

Clark started his second professional season slowly after suffering a preseason injury; he came off the bench in the season opener against Columbus, but had to wait until the end of April against New England to get his first turn in the starting lineup. He scored his only goal of the season in the regular season finale against D.C. United, a 50th minute rocket as part of a 3–2 defeat. For the second straight season, Clark started both playoff matches for the Metros as they were knocked out in the quarterfinals. He scored once in 28 total appearances on the year, bringing his total with the club to four goals in 63 games.

===San Jose/Houston===

Clark was traded to San Jose Earthquakes on January 14, 2005, in exchange for allocation money and a youth international roster slot. The trade occurred on the same day as the 2005 MLS SuperDraft, meaning that Clark became one of eight players that joined the Earthquakes on the day.

He jumped immediately into the starting lineup in 2005, making his club debut with a start in the season opener against New England Revolution on April 2. Playing out of a defensive midfield role, Clark found the back of the net three times on the season: July 2 away to FC Dallas, August 13 against Colorado Rapids, and September 10 against Chivas USA. He was named as the MLS Player of the Month for July, also earning a nod as the club&#x27;s player of the month that month. Clark scored his first career playoff goal on October 23, in the first leg of the conference semifinals against LA Galaxy; the Galaxy would win the match, 3–1, and took the series by a 4–2 aggregate scoreline. Clark finished the season with 32 appearances and four goals across all competitions.

Due to San Jose&#x27;s failure to reach a stadium agreement with AEG, Clark, along with the rest of his Earthquakes teammates, moved to Houston for the 2006 season. He started in the inaugural match for Houston Dynamo, a 5–2 victory over Colorado on April 2. Clark went on to start 31 times during the regular season, scoring twice: the first goal in Texas Derby history on May 6 and the tying goal on June 10 against New York Red Bulls. However, the second half of his season was marred by a couple of bookings. On August 26, Clark received the first red card of his career, coming in a 3–2 defeat against Chivas USA. He then picked up a pair of yellow cards in the playoffs, meaning that he would be suspended for MLS Cup 2006. With Adrian Serioux starting in his place, Houston defeated New England Revolution on penalties to win the first trophy in club history. Clark made 36 appearances on the season, scoring twice, and was named to the MLS Best XI.

Clark began 2007 by making his continental debut in the 2007 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, appearing in three of Houston&#x27;s four games against Puntarenas and Pachuca. He then missed more than a month of the 2007 season on national team duty, appearing in the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup and 2007 Copa América. His play through the first half of the season, including a goal against FC Dallas on June 3, earned him a spot in the 2007 MLS All-Star Game, the second consecutive season that Clark had been selected as an all-star. Following his return from the United States squad, he scored for the second time on the season on September 16, in a 3–1 victory over LA Galaxy. However, Clark&#x27;s season ended at the end of September. He missed the final two regular season and all playoff matches due to a suspension resulting from a deliberate kick aimed at a prone Carlos Ruiz in a match with FC Dallas on September 30. Clark was sent off, received a nine-game suspension, and was fined $10,000, the most severe punishment in MLS history. In his absence, Houston went on to win MLS Cup 2007, repeating as MLS Cup champions. Clark finished the season with 23 appearances and two goals across all competitions.

Clark&#x27;s suspension carried over for the first two games of the 2008 season, but he jumped immediately back into the Houston lineup afterwards. He notched two goals in 25 appearances in MLS play, scoring against Chicago Fire on May 17 and Real Salt Lake on August 16. Clark also played a large role in Houston&#x27;s continental competitions, playing 16 times and scoring once across the three competitions. He played every minute of the Dynamo&#x27;s four matches in the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, repeated the feat across five games in the North American SuperLiga, and played in seven games of Houston&#x27;s 2008–09 CONCACAF Champions League campaign. In the group stage of the SuperLiga, Clark scored his first career goal in a continental competition, coming in a 3–1 victory over D.C. United. He also converted during the penalty shootout in the final of that competition against New England, although the Revolution took the title by a 6–5 mark. Clark made a career-high 43 appearances in all competitions in 2008, scoring three times.
Clark missed time during the summer of 2009, earning a call up to the United States for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup. He scored his only goal of the season following his return to from South Africa, a strike on August 9 in a 3–2 victory over Chicago. Thanks in part to his international duties, Clark only made 22 appearances in league play. He also saw his playing time in the CONCACAF Champions League decrease, appearing in two of the Dynamo&#x27;s six games in the competition. Clark did play every minute in the MLS Cup Playoffs, including going 120 minutes against LA Galaxy in the conference finals on November 13. Houston was defeated 2–0 after extra time, and with Clark&#x27;s contract expiring at the end of the season it would mark his final match of his first stint with the club. He announced following the season that he would pursue opportunities abroad, departing Houston with eight goals in 129 appearances across four seasons with the Dynamo.

During the summer of 2009, following his performance at the Confederations Cup, Clark had received interest from multiple European clubs. Stade Rennais of Ligue 1 and newly promoted Serie A club Livorno both reported interest in the player, either to sign him during the summer window or once his contract with MLS expired in January. Both moves fell through, leaving Clark with Houston through the end of the season.

===Eintracht Frankfurt===
Clark, whose contract with MLS expired at the end of the 2009 season, signed a deal with Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt for the remainder of the 2009–10 season with an option to extend the contract at the end of the season. He made his club debut on April 24, 2010, against Mainz 05, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3–3 draw. Clark started each of the last three matches on the season for Eintracht as the club finished 10th in the league. Prior to the season finale against VfL Wolfsburg, and despite the injury he had suffered after arriving in Germany, Clark inked a three-year contract with Frankfurt.

As Eintracht struggled towards relegation in 2010–11, Clark also struggled to become a mainstay in the starting lineup for the club. He made his season debut in a 4–0 victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach in early September, replacing Pirmin Schwegler in the 89th minute. Clark appeared in four of Eintracht&#x27;s nine victories on the season, and six of their 16 total results, but could not prevent the club from slumping to 17th place and just the fourth relegation in club history. He did make his DFB-Pokal debut in late December, playing the full 120 minutes in a 5–3 penalty kick defeat against Alemannia Aachen that eliminated Eintracht from the competition. Clark finished the season having made just 12 appearances in all competitions for the club.

Clark made his debut appearance in the 2. Bundesliga on July 25, 2011, against FC St. Pauli, going the full 90 minutes and picking up a yellow card in a 1–1 draw. However, he was unable to build on that start and only managed to make the bench three more times through the first half of the season, never again appearing for the club. Clark would be sent on loan to Norwegian club Stabæk in February, on a deal running through the end of July. On July 18, 2012, before that loan had even expired, Eintracht confirmed that Clark&#x27;s contract had been terminated by mutual consent, effective at the end of his loan spell in Norway. Clark officially departed Eintracht Frankfurt having appeared 16 times in all competitions for the club, and just once during his final season in Germany.

====Loan to Stabæk====
On February 22, 2012, after struggling for playing time with Eintracht, Clark was sent on loan to Stabæk of the Tippeligaen. The Norwegian club confirmed that the loan ran through the end of July. He made his club debut a little more than a month later, playing the full 90 minutes in a scoreless draw against Aalesund on March 25. Clark was a fixture in the Stabæk lineup during his time at the club, finishing his time in Norway by appearing in both legs of a Europa League first qualifying round tie against JJK as Stabæk were defeated 4–3 on aggregate by the Finnish club. He went 79 minutes in the opening leg defeat, but had to be replaced by Adnan Haidar before halftime in the second leg in what would mark his final match for the club. Clark concluded the loan spell having made 15 appearances across all competitions for Stabæk.

===Return to Houston===

Following his release from Eintracht, Clark returned to the United States and signed again with Houston Dynamo, who had retained his Major League Soccer rights when he moved to Germany, on August 2, 2012. He was officially added to the roster on August 8, after Geoff Cameron finalized a move to Premier League side Stoke City. Clark made his second debut for the Dynamo two days later, coming on as a second-half substitute in a defeat against New York Red Bulls. His first goal since his return was scored on September 29, a 77th-minute strike to hand Houston a 2–0 victory over New England Revolution. Clark started in MLS Cup 2012 against LA Galaxy, but conceded the game-winning penalty as Houston were defeated 3–1. He finished the campaign with one goal in 18 appearances in all competitions.

Clark jumped straight into the 2013 season, scoring in the season opener against D.C. United and earning a nod to the MLS Team of the Week for week one. He notched his second goal on July 6 against Philadelphia Union, providing the winner in a 1–0 game, but then missed almost a month across July and August due to an unspecified illness. Following his return to action, Clark jumped back onto the scoresheet: he snapped a four-match winless run for Houston with the winning goal against Philadelphia on September 14, then tallied the only goal of a victory over Montreal Impact on October 4. In the playoffs, Clark again played a starring role for the Dynamo, scoring his first playoff goal for the club and adding an assist although the Dynamo were denied a third-straight trip to MLS Cup. Clark finished the season with final stats of 36 appearances and five goals; for his efforts, he was named as the Dynamo Player&#x27;s Player of the Year.

The 2014 season was a disappointing one for Houston, who failed to qualify for the playoffs for only the second time in club history, as well as for Clark, who appeared in only 25 games because of injury. He suffered a concussion on April 23 against New York Red Bulls, and wound up missing eleven matches before returning against Montreal on June 29. After scoring twice prior to his injury, Clark added two more goals following his return. He tallied strikes in back-to-back games against Sporting Kansas City and Montreal, sparking the Dynamo to a six-match unbeaten run. The late effort wasn&#x27;t enough, however, for the Dynamo to qualify for the playoffs, as they missed out for the first time since 2010. Clark made 25 appearances on the season, scoring four times.

2015 would prove to be the most productive season of Clark&#x27;s career, as he appeared in 33 matches and scored a career-high nine goals. Four of those goals came through the first half of the season, including a pair in back-to-back games against Montreal and D.C. United in mid-April. He also scored his first career U.S. Open Cup goal, coming two minutes into stoppage time of a fourth round victory over Austin Aztex. Clark continued his tear through the second half of the season, tallying match-winning goals against San Jose on July 10 and Vancouver Whitecaps FC on August 29. Although Houston won points in seven out of the eight games he scored in, the Dynamo fell nine points short of qualifying for the playoffs, missing out for the second straight season. Following the season, Clark was named as the club&#x27;s Most Valuable Player, Player&#x27;s Player of the Year, and Humanitarian of the Year. He also earned recognition from the fans as Midfielder of the Year. Clark became a free agent at the end of the season, but re-signed with Houston on December 8.

In his ninth season in Houston, Clark appeared in a career-high 32 league matches; that included his 275th regular season start (against Columbus in April) and his 300th career MLS appearance (against San Jose in August). Clark scored four times on the season, twice against San Jose and twice in the Texas Derby against FC Dallas. The goals against Dallas, in March and June, were his fifth and sixth in the Derby, tying Brian Ching for the most in the history of the series. Clark appeared 33 times in all competitions, augmenting his four goals with a career-high four assists.

Ahead of the 2017 season, Clark was named as the sixth club captain in Dynamo history, taking over from DaMarcus Beasley when Wilmer Cabrera was named as the head coach. Clark did not score a goal in any competition in 2017, the first time in his MLS career that he did not tally a league goal. He missed time early in the season because of tightness in his left adductor, sitting out two matches in late April due to the injury. On May 20, Clark made his professional debut in his hometown of Atlanta, entering the 4–1 defeat against Atlanta United as a substitute. The Dynamo returned to the playoffs for the first time in four seasons, with Clark appearing twice as part of the club&#x27;s run to the Western Conference finals. He finished the season having appeared 30 times in all competitions. On December 5, Houston declined the option on Clark&#x27;s contract, making him a free agent and ending his eleven-year affiliation with the organization. He departed the Dynamo after 175 appearances and 23 goals through his second stint with the club, bringing his all-time mark in Houston to 304 appearances and 31 goals.

===Columbus Crew SC===
On February 2, 2018, Clark joined his fourth MLS club, signing as a free agent with Columbus Crew SC. At 34 years old at the time of his signing, he became the oldest player on the Columbus roster.

Prior to the season, Clark was named as part of the leadership council for Crew SC, joining Federico Higuaín, Hector Jiménez, Jonathan Mensah, Zack Steffen, and Josh Williams. The six collectively served as vice-captains behind captain Wil Trapp. Clark made his Columbus debut as a late substitute on March 10, replacing Lalas Abubakar six minutes into stoppage time of a 3–2 victory against Montreal Impact. He was on the field for less than a minute before the final whistle. On his second appearance, and first start, Clark scored his first goal for the club. From a Higuaín corner kick, he powered home the winning goal in a 3–1 victory over D.C. United. Clark played sparingly across the remainder of the season, finishing the season with one goal in 13 appearances. The club declined his contract option on November 26, but stated that they would &quot;remain in contract dialogue&quot; with Clark. On January 17, 2019, the two sides agreed to terms and he re-signed with Crew SC for the 2019 season.

Clark officially retired from playing professional soccer on February 12, 2020. He signed a ceremonial one day contract with Houston Dynamo for the announcement.

==International career==
Clark received his first taste of international soccer with the United States U18 national team, earning six caps and scoring three goals during his two eligible years at that level. He was a key member of the squad that won the 2001 International Tournament of Lisbon, where he started all three matches.

Clark was bumped up to the United States U20 national team at the start of 2002, earning his first cap at that level on January 10 as part of a 1–0 victory over Canada. He was named in the squad for the 2002 C.O.T.I.F. XIX Torneig Internacional, helping the Americans to their best-ever finish; they were defeated by Brazil in the final. Clark closed out 2002 at the CONCACAF U20 qualifying tournament, helping the United States qualify for the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship. After appearing 28 times for the U20s in 2002, Clark went on to play 19 more games in 2003, including another appearance in L&#x27;Alcúdia. His final caps at U20 level came in the United Arab Emirates at the World Youth Championship, where Clark played all five games for the Americans. His 47th and final appearance for the U20s came in a quarterfinal defeat against Argentina on December 12.

While also playing for the U20s, Clark earned his first cap for the United States U23 national team in May 2003; he played the full 90 minutes against Mexico as part of a 3–1 American victory. He only appeared one other time for the U23s, in an Olympic qualifier against St. Kitts and Nevis on November 15.

===Early international career and 2007 tournaments===
Clark received his first senior cap for the United States on October 12, 2005, in a World Cup qualifier against Panama. He replaced Kyle Martino in the 68th minute of a 2–0 American victory. Clark was not named to the squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and thus did not earn another cap for more than a year. He returned to the team after Bob Bradley was named as the new head coach, making his first start for the U.S. in a friendly victory over Denmark on January 20, 2007. That summer, Clark was named to two American squads: the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup in the United States and the 2007 Copa América in Venezuela. He appeared four times in the Gold Cup, coming off the bench in all three knockout stage matches; in the final against Mexico, he replaced Pablo Mastroeni at halftime as part of the American comeback victory. At the Copa América, Clark appeared in all three matches as the United States was knocked out of the competition in the group stage. Against Paraguay on July 2, he scored his first international goal, a 40th-minute strike that would turn out to be the only goal from open play scored by the United States on the tournament.

===2009 Confederations Cup and World Cup qualifying===
More than three years after earning his first World Cup qualifying cap, Clark earned his second; he started against Trinidad and Tobago on September 10, 2008, in a qualifier for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He played in just two of the six Third Round qualifiers for the United States, but found a larger role in the Hexagonal, appearing in four of the ten American matches in the final round. On September 10, 2009, Clark scored his first World Cup qualifying goal, and just his second for the United States. Away to Trinidad and Tobago, Clark&#x27;s 62nd-minute strike was the only score of a 1–0 victory, and guaranteed that the United States could finish no worse than fourth in the Hexagonal. He then went the distance against Honduras on October 10, as the U.S. clinched a spot in the World Cup with a 3–2 victory.

In the midst of that World Cup qualifying campaign, Clark was selected to the American squad for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup. He appeared in two group stage matches for the U.S., missing only the 3–0 defeat against Brazil. Clark went the distance in the semifinal victory over Spain, helping the United States to their first-ever Confederations Cup final. Against Brazil in the final, he played 88 minutes before being replaced by Conor Casey as the Americans chased the game; they finished as runners-up after a 3–2 defeat to the Seleção.

===2010 World Cup and later career===

Clark was named as part of the 30-man preliminary squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Coach Bob Bradley named Clark as part of the 23-man squad that would take part in South Africa. He was one of nine midfielders selected to the team. After appearing in two tune-up matches prior to the tournament, Clark made his World Cup debut on June 12 with a start against England in the group stage. He also started in the Round of 16, a match that saw the United States defeated by Ghana after an extra time goal by Asamoah Gyan. Clark came in for criticism following the match, as he had committed the turnover that led to Ghana&#x27;s opening goal in the fifth minute, picked up a yellow card in the seventh minute, and was substituted in the 31st minute.

Clark only appeared three more times for the United States following the World Cup. In Jürgen Klinsmann&#x27;s debut as head coach, Clark was an 84th-minute substitute against Mexico, replacing José Francisco Torres. He scored his third and final international goal on January 22, 2012, a header seven minutes into second-half stoppage time to beat Venezuela. Four days later, Clark made what would turn out to be his final appearance for the United States, playing 67 minutes in a 1–0 victory over Panama. Clark earned 34 caps for the United States, scoring three goals across his eight years with the national team.

== Managerial career ==
On March 11, 2021, the Vancouver Whitecaps FC announced that they hired Clark as an assistant coach for the first team.

<text>In mathematics, Hurwitz&#x27;s automorphisms theorem bounds the order of the group of automorphisms, via orientation-preserving conformal mappings, of a compact Riemann surface of genus &quot;g&quot; &gt; 1, stating that the number of such automorphisms cannot exceed 84(&quot;g&quot; − 1). A group for which the maximum is achieved is called a Hurwitz group, and the corresponding Riemann surface a [[Hurwitz surface]]. Because compact Riemann surfaces are synonymous with non-singular complex projective algebraic curves, a Hurwitz surface can also be called a Hurwitz curve. The theorem is named after Adolf Hurwitz, who proved it in .

Hurwitz&#x27;s bound also holds for algebraic curves over a field of characteristic 0, and over fields of positive characteristic &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0 for groups whose order is coprime to &quot;p&quot;, but can fail over fields of positive characteristic &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0 when &quot;p&quot; divides the group order. For example, the double cover of the projective line &quot;y&quot;2 = &quot;xp&quot; − &quot;x&quot; branched at all points defined over the prime field has genus &quot;g&quot; = (&quot;p&quot; − 1)/2 but is acted on by the group PGL2(&quot;p&quot;) of order &quot;p&quot;3 − &quot;p&quot;.

== Interpretation in terms of hyperbolicity ==

One of the fundamental themes in differential geometry is a trichotomy between the Riemannian manifolds of positive, zero, and negative curvature &quot;K&quot;. It manifests itself in many diverse situations and on several levels. In the context of compact Riemann surfaces &quot;X&quot;, via the Riemann uniformization theorem, this can be seen as a distinction between the surfaces of different topologies:
* &quot;X&quot; a sphere, a compact Riemann surface of genus zero with &quot;K&quot; &gt; 0;
* &quot;X&quot; a flat torus, or an elliptic curve, a Riemann surface of genus one with &quot;K&quot; = 0;
* and &quot;X&quot; a hyperbolic surface, which has genus greater than one and &quot;K&quot; &lt; 0.

While in the first two cases the surface &quot;X&quot; admits infinitely many conformal automorphisms (in fact, the conformal automorphism group is a complex Lie group of dimension three for a sphere and of dimension one for a torus), a hyperbolic Riemann surface only admits a discrete set of automorphisms. Hurwitz&#x27;s theorem claims that in fact more is true: it provides a uniform bound on the order of the automorphism group as a function of the genus and characterizes those Riemann surfaces for which the bound is sharp.

== Statement and proof ==

Theorem: Let formula_1 be a smooth connected Riemann surface of genus formula_2. Then its automorphism group formula_3 has size at most formula_4.

&quot;Proof:&quot; Assume for now that formula_5 is finite (this will be proved at the end).
* Consider the quotient map formula_6. Since formula_7 acts by holomorphic functions, the quotient is locally of the form formula_8 and the quotient formula_9 is a smooth Riemann surface. The quotient map formula_6 is a branched cover, and we will see below that the ramification points correspond to the orbits that have a non-trivial stabiliser. Let formula_11 be the genus of formula_9.
* By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, formula_13 where the sum is over the formula_14 ramification points formula_15 for the quotient map formula_16. The ramification index formula_17 at formula_18 is just the order of the stabiliser group, since formula_19 where formula_20 the number of pre-images of formula_18 (the number of points in the orbit), and formula_22. By definition of ramification points, formula_23 for all formula_14 ramification indices. 

Now call the righthand side formula_25 and since formula_26 we must have formula_27. Rearranging the equation we find:
* If formula_28 then formula_29, and formula_30
* If formula_31, then formula_32 and formula_33 so that formula_34, 
* If formula_35, then formula_36 and
** if formula_37 then formula_38, so that formula_39
** if formula_40 then formula_41, so that formula_42,
** if formula_43 then write formula_44. We may assume formula_45. 
*** if formula_46 then formula_47 so that formula_48,
*** if formula_49 then 
**** if formula_50 then formula_51 so that formula_52,
**** if formula_53 then formula_54 so that formula_55.
In conclusion, formula_55.

To show that formula_7 is finite, note that formula_7 acts on the cohomology formula_59 preserving the Hodge decomposition and the lattice formula_60.
*In particular, its action on formula_61 gives a homomorphism formula_62 with discrete image formula_63.
*In addition, the image formula_63 preserves the natural non-degenerate Hermitian inner product formula_65 on formula_66. In particular the image formula_63 is contained in the unitary group formula_68 which is compact. Thus the image formula_63 is not just discrete, but finite. 
* It remains to prove that formula_62 has finite kernel. In fact, we will prove formula_71 is injective. Assume formula_72 acts as the identity on formula_66. If formula_74 is finite, then by the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, formula_75
This is a contradiction, and so formula_74 is infinite. Since formula_74 is a closed complex sub variety of positive dimension and formula_1 is a smooth connected curve (i.e. formula_79), we must have formula_80. Thus formula_81 is the identity, and we conclude that formula_71 is injective and formula_83 is finite.
Q.E.D.

Corollary of the proof: A Riemann surface formula_1 of genus formula_2 has formula_4 automorphisms if and only if formula_1 is a branched cover formula_88 with three ramification points, of indices &quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot; and &quot;7&quot;.

== The idea of another proof and construction of the Hurwitz surfaces ==

By the uniformization theorem, any hyperbolic surface &quot;X&quot; – i.e., the Gaussian curvature of &quot;X&quot; is equal to negative one at every point – is covered by the hyperbolic plane. The conformal mappings of the surface correspond to orientation-preserving automorphisms of the hyperbolic plane. By the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, the area of the surface is

: A(&quot;X&quot;) = − 2π χ(&quot;X&quot;) = 4π(&quot;g&quot; − 1).

In order to make the automorphism group &quot;G&quot; of &quot;X&quot; as large as possible, we want the area of its fundamental domain &quot;D&quot; for this action to be as small as possible. If the fundamental domain is a triangle with the vertex angles π/p, π/q and π/r, defining a tiling of the hyperbolic plane, then &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, and &quot;r&quot; are integers greater than one, and the area is 

: A(&quot;D&quot;) = π(1 − 1/&quot;p&quot; − 1/&quot;q&quot; − 1/&quot;r&quot;).

Thus we are asking for integers which make the expression

:1 − 1/&quot;p&quot; − 1/&quot;q&quot; − 1/&quot;r&quot;

strictly positive and as small as possible. This minimal value is 1/42, and

:1 − 1/2 − 1/3 − 1/7 = 1/42

gives a unique triple of such integers. This would indicate that the order |&quot;G&quot;| of the automorphism group is bounded by

: A(&quot;X&quot;)/A(&quot;D&quot;) ≤ 168(&quot;g&quot; − 1).

However, a more delicate reasoning shows that this is an overestimate by the factor of two, because the group &quot;G&quot; can contain orientation-reversing transformations. For the orientation-preserving conformal automorphisms the bound is 84(&quot;g&quot; − 1).

=== Construction ===

To obtain an example of a Hurwitz group, let us start with a (2,3,7)-tiling of the hyperbolic plane. Its full symmetry group is the full (2,3,7) triangle group generated by the reflections across the sides of a single fundamental triangle with the angles π/2, π/3 and π/7. Since a reflection flips the triangle and changes the orientation, we can join the triangles in pairs and obtain an orientation-preserving tiling polygon.
A Hurwitz surface is obtained by &#x27;closing up&#x27; a part of this infinite tiling of the hyperbolic plane to a compact Riemann surface of genus &quot;g&quot;. This will necessarily involve exactly 84(&quot;g&quot; − 1) double triangle tiles.

The following two regular tilings have the desired symmetry group; the rotational group corresponds to rotation about an edge, a vertex, and a face, while the full symmetry group would also include a reflection. The polygons in the tiling are not fundamental domains – the tiling by (2,3,7) triangles refines both of these and is not regular.

Wythoff constructions yields further uniform tilings, yielding eight uniform tilings, including the two regular ones given here. These all descend to Hurwitz surfaces, yielding tilings of the surfaces (triangulation, tiling by heptagons, etc.).

From the arguments above it can be inferred that a Hurwitz group &quot;G&quot; is characterized by the property that it is a finite quotient of the group with two generators &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and three relations

:formula_89

thus &quot;G&quot; is a finite group generated by two elements of orders two and three, whose product is of order seven. More precisely, any Hurwitz surface, that is, a hyperbolic surface that realizes the maximum order of the automorphism group for the surfaces of a given genus, can be obtained by the construction given. 
This is the last part of the theorem of Hurwitz.

== Examples of Hurwitz groups and surfaces ==
The smallest Hurwitz group is the projective special linear group PSL(2,7), of order 168, and the corresponding curve is the Klein quartic curve. This group is also isomorphic to PSL(3,2).

Next is the Macbeath curve, with automorphism group PSL(2,8) of order 504. Many more finite simple groups are Hurwitz groups; for instance all but 64 of the alternating groups are Hurwitz groups, the largest non-Hurwitz example being of degree 167. The smallest alternating group that is a Hurwitz group is A15.

Most projective special linear groups of large rank are Hurwitz groups, . For lower ranks, fewer such groups are Hurwitz. For &quot;n&quot;&quot;p&quot; the order of &quot;p&quot; modulo 7, one has that PSL(2,&quot;q&quot;) is Hurwitz if and only if either &quot;q&quot;=7 or &quot;q&quot; = &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;p&quot;. Indeed, PSL(3,&quot;q&quot;) is Hurwitz if and only if &quot;q&quot; = 2, PSL(4,&quot;q&quot;) is never Hurwitz, and PSL(5,&quot;q&quot;) is Hurwitz if and only if &quot;q&quot; = 74 or &quot;q&quot; = &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;p&quot;, .

Similarly, many groups of Lie type are Hurwitz. The finite classical groups of large rank are Hurwitz, . The exceptional Lie groups of type G2 and the Ree groups of type 2G2 are nearly always Hurwitz, . Other families of exceptional and twisted Lie groups of low rank are shown to be Hurwitz in .

There are 12 sporadic groups that can be generated as Hurwitz groups: the Janko groups J1, J2 and J4, the Fischer groups Fi22 and Fi&#x27;24, the Rudvalis group, the Held group, the Thompson group, the Harada–Norton group, the third Conway group Co3, the Lyons group, and the Monster, .

==Automorphism groups in low genus==

The largest |Aut(&quot;X&quot;)| can get for a Riemann surface &quot;X&quot; of genus &quot;g&quot; is shown below, for 2 ≤ &quot;g&quot; ≤ 10, along with a surface &quot;X&quot;0 with |Aut(&quot;X&quot;0)| maximal. 

In this range, there only exists a Hurwitz curve in genus &quot;g&quot; = 3 and &quot;g&quot; = 7 .

==Generalizations==
The concept of a Hurwitz surface can be generalized in several ways to a definition that has examples in all but a few genera. Perhaps the most natural is a &quot;maximally symmetric&quot; surface: One that cannot be continuously modified through equally symmetric surfaces to a surface whose symmetry properly contains that of the original surface. This is possible for all orientable compact genera (see above section &quot;Automorphism groups in low genus&quot;).

<text>Sankey tank is an artificial lake or tank situated in the western part of Bangalore in the middle of the neighbourhoods of Malleshwaram, Vyalikaval and Sadashivanagar. The lake covers an area of about . At its widest, the tank has a width of .

Sankey tank was constructed by Col. Richard Hieram Sankey (RE) of the Madras Sappers Regiment, in 1882, to meet the water supply demands of Bangalore. The tank was also known as &quot;Gandhadhakotikere&quot;, as the Government Sandalwood Depot used to be located near the lake.

==History==
Sankey reservoir was constructed in 1882. It was linked to the Miller&#x27;s tank and Dharmambudhi tank and was built as a safeguard against water shortages, as experienced in the Great Famine of 1876–78. The quality of water was not very good and when the Governor of Madras visited Bangalore in July 1888, a local wit commented, &quot;The men who are thrown off their horses and killed on the spot at Bangalore are the only ones that are allowed by doctors not to have died from drinking bad water&quot;.

==Threats==
The threats posed to the survival of the lake, which were also identified by the local people using the lake, scientific experts and bureaucrats, include:
* Contamination of water with sewage flowing in from seven points, which are connected to storm water drains
* Choked drains with garbage and sewage
* Leaking sewage pipes connected to a public toilet at a park
These threats have resulted in:
* Increased biological oxygen demand due to sewage dumping/leakage
* Variance in physio-chemical parameters. During the tests conducted in 2001 also the DO was reported to vary from 3.7 to 8.1, BOD between 2 and 8 and the pH varied from 7.1 to 7.5.
* A reduction in fauna diversity (mainly fish and aquatic birds) due to pollution, sewage leaks and littering

==Restoration actions==

The tank was converted into a park by the Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewage Board (BWSSB) and the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) with funds provided by the Government of Karnataka. In addition, the following were also implemented.
* Removing encroachments
* Alum purification treatment to absorb toxic elements and germs
* Nursery towards the north
* Paved walkways
* Landscaped parks
* Special tank for idol immersion during Ganesh Chaturthi festival
* Restoration of swimming pool

==Legal land encroachment tangle==

In 2004, local builders’ proposal to construct a multistory building in the Sankey tank bed was challenged by petitioners in the Karnataka Lok Adalat (Peoples Court, an adjunct of the High Court). But the Court was informed by the Bangalore Mahanagar Palike (BMP) that it had not sanctioned any plan for the proposed building and that it would take immediate action to prevent any such steps by the developer taken without a no-objection certificate from the Ministry of Environment and Forests.

The Lok Adalat ordered the Forest Department to repossess of land belonging to it from the real estate developers who had set out to build an apartment block there. The Lake Development Authority also recommended that no construction or development activity should be allowed within a distance of from lakes in order to ensure that the water bodies in the city are not encroached and their conservation and protection are not stalled. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) informed the court that the proposal of Abhishek Builders and Mantri Developers to build an 18–floor luxury apartment block near the Sankey Tank has been turned down as gross violations were noted under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act.

<text>Chicago 19 is the sixteenth studio album by American rock band Chicago, released on June 20, 1988. After recording &quot;Chicago 18&quot; with David Foster, the band worked primarily with producers Ron Nevison and Chas Sandford for this album. Their Full Moon Records imprint moved to Reprise Records. This is the final album to feature the band&#x27;s original drummer Danny Seraphine, who was dismissed from the group in 1990.

==Background==
With a reception similar to its predecessor, &quot;Chicago 19&quot; became a success on the album chart, going platinum and yielding several hit singles. The album includes &quot;Look Away&quot; (No. 1), &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Live Without Your Love&quot; (No. 3), and &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot; (No. 10). A remixed version of Jason Scheff&#x27;s &quot;What Kind of Man Would I Be?&quot; (No. 5) would also be successful in late 1989 as part of the follow-up &quot;Greatest Hits 1982-1989&quot; release. The album relied heavily on outside writers with five of its ten compositions. The first two singles were either written or co-written by Diane Warren, and the third by British-born songwriter Jimmy Scott.

After the tour for &quot;Chicago 19&quot;, original drummer Danny Seraphine was fired from the band for undisclosed reasons. Session drummer Tris Imboden then joined the band, in time to record &quot;Explain It to My Heart&quot; (the last song recorded for the album) on &quot;Twenty 1&quot;.

<text>Within the administration of the Soviet Union, the Special Council of the USSR NKVD () was created by the same decree of Sovnarkom of July 10, 1934 that introduced the NKVD itself. The decree endowed the Special Council with the right to apply punishments &quot;by administrative means&quot;, i.e., without trial. In other words, the term &quot;by administrative means&quot; actually refers to extrajudicial punishment.

The following types of punishment were put at the disposal of the Special Council by this decree: banishment (высылка) (from the place of residence), exile (ссылка) (to remote regions), sentencing to corrective labor camp (исправительно-трудовой лагерь) for up to five years, and deportation (высылка) from the USSR.

In 1937, during the Great Purge, the Special Council was allowed to sentence to imprisonment for up to eight years. The abolition of many NKVD troikas in November 1938 saw the Special Council take over some of their functions.
In November 1941, after the beginning of the war against Germany, the Special Council was allowed to sentence to imprisonment for up to 25 years or to death. After the 1945 end of the war the Special Council lost the right to pass death-sentences; the maximum available punishment was 25 years of imprisonment.

When the NKVD was renamed in 1946, the Special Council remained within the corresponding organization, e.g., as Special Council of the [[MGB (USSR)|MGB]], etc.

After the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union abolished the Special Council in September 1953.

<text>The Indian independence movement consisted of efforts by individuals and organizations from a wide spectrum of society to obtain political independence from the British, French and Portuguese rule through the use of many methods. This is a list of individuals who notably campaigned against or are considered to have campaigned against colonial rule on the Indian sub-continent.

Post-independence, the term &quot;freedom fighter&quot; was officially recognized by the Indian government for those who took part in the movement; people in this category (which can also include dependent family members) receive pensions and other benefits such as Special Railway Counters.

<text>.ga is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Gabon.

==History==

Between 1998 and 2004 it was administered by the &quot;Office des Postes et Télécommunications de la République Gabonaise&quot; and then transferred to &quot;Gabon Telecom&quot;. &quot;Gabon Telecom&quot; in 2013 formed a partnership with international domain registrar Freenom to offer registrations of this domain for free.

Since 2013, the &quot;Agence Nationale des Infrastructures Numériques et des Fréquences&quot; (ANINF) of Gabon is responsible for the .ga domain.

In 2023, ANINF terminated their contract with Freenom because it found Freenom&#x27;s service unsatisfactory. ANINF stated that upwards of seven million .ga domains would be deleted, as &quot;the previous operator has not provided the data that concern them.&quot; 

The migration was carried out from 4 June to 7 June 2023. With this migration, free domain registration was removed.

The technical operation is handled by AFNIC and domains are sold through accredited registrars.

== Denial of Registration to Kim Dotcom ==
Kim Dotcom attempted to use me.ga as an alternative domain for the Megaupload service. It was suspended by Communications Minister Blaise Louembe who stated &quot;Gabon cannot serve as a platform or screen for committing acts aimed at violating copyrights, nor be used by unscrupulous people.&quot;
