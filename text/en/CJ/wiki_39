<text>Willem Jacob &#x27;s Gravesande (26 September 1688 – 28 February 1742) was a Dutch mathematician and natural philosopher, chiefly remembered for developing experimental demonstrations of the laws of classical mechanics and the first experimental measurement of kinetic energy. As professor of mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy at Leiden University, he helped to propagate Isaac Newton&#x27;s ideas in Continental Europe.

== Life ==
Born in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, &#x27;s Gravesande studied law at Leiden University, where he defended a thesis on suicide and earned a doctorate in 1707. He then practised law in The Hague while also participating in intellectual discussions and cultivating his interest in the mathematical sciences. His &quot;Essai de perspective&quot; (&quot;Essay on Perspective&quot;), published in 1711, was praised by the influential Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli. In The Hague, &#x27;s Gravesande also helped to establish the &quot;Journal littéraire&quot; (&quot;Literary journal&quot;), a learned periodical first published in 1713.

In 1715, &#x27;s Gravesande visited London as part of a Dutch delegation sent to welcome the Hanoverian succession in Great Britain. In London, &#x27;s Gravesande met both King George I and Isaac Newton, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1717 he became professor of mathematics and astronomy in Leiden. From that position, he was instrumental in introducing Newton&#x27;s work to the Netherlands. He also obtained the chairs of civil and military architecture in 1730 and philosophy in 1734. As a philosopher, he opposed fatalists like Hobbes and Spinoza.

&#x27;s Gravesande was married to Anna Sacrelaire in 1720. They had two sons, both of whom died in adolescence. In 1724, Peter the Great offered &#x27;s Gravesande a position in the new Imperial Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. In 1737 he received an offer from Frederick the Great to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. He declined both offers, opting to remain in Leiden.

== Mechanics ==

Gravesande&#x27;s main scientific work is &quot;Physices elementa mathematica, experimentis confirmata, sive introductio ad philosophiam Newtonianam&quot; (&quot;Mathematical Elements of Natural Philosophy, Confirmed by Experiments; or, an Introduction to Newtonian Philosophy&quot;), published in Leiden in 1720. In that book, he laid the foundations for the teaching of Newtonian mechanics through experimental demonstrations. He presented his work before audiences that included Voltaire, Albrecht von Haller, and Émilie du Châtelet (the translator of Newton&#x27;s Principia whose later commentary incorporated &#x27;s Gravesande&#x27;s 1722 experimental discovery of kinetic energy). &#x27;s Gravesande&#x27;s book was soon translated into English by John Theophilus Desaguliers, curator of experiments for the Royal Society.

In 1721, &#x27;s Gravesande became involved in a public controversy over whether the German inventor Johann Bessler, known as Councillor Orffyreus, had created a genuine perpetual motion machine. &#x27;s Gravesande at first argued for the feasibility of perpetual motion based on the conservation of the scalar quantity &quot;mv&quot; (mass multiplied by speed), which he erroneously believed was implied by Newtonian mechanics. However, in 1722 he published the results of a series of experiments in which brass balls were dropped from varying heights onto a soft clay surface. He found that two balls of the same size and different masses would make identical indentations when the heights they were dropped from were inversely proportional to their masses, from which he concluded that the correct expression for the &quot;live force&quot; of a body in motion (currently called &quot;kinetic energy&quot;) is proportional to &quot;mv&quot;2.

Even though those results invalidated his original argument for the feasibility of perpetual motion, &#x27;s Gravesande continued to defend Bessler&#x27;s work, claiming that Bessler might have discovered some new &quot;active principle&quot; of nature that allowed his wheels to keep turning. Similar views were defended at the time by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Johann Bernoulli, and others, but the modern consensus is that Bessler was perpetrating a deliberate hoax. Russian Tsar Peter the Great was interested in Bessler&#x27;s wheel and sought &#x27;s Gravesande&#x27;s advice on the subject.

&#x27;s Gravesande communicated his results on the impact of falling weights to Émilie du Châtelet. Similar observations were published in 1718 by Giovanni Poleni. The interpretation of &#x27;s Gravesande&#x27;s and Poleni&#x27;s results led to a controversy with Samuel Clarke and other Newtonians that became a part of the so-called &quot;&quot;vis viva&quot; dispute&quot; in the history of classical mechanics.

==&#x27;s Gravesande&#x27;s ring==
&#x27;s Gravesande is also remembered for his invention of a simple experiment demonstrating thermal expansion, which has been used in physics education since. This is known today as &quot;&#x27;s Gravesande&#x27;s experiment&quot; or &quot;&#x27;s Gravesande&#x27;s ring&quot;. The apparatus consists of a small metal ball on a chain or handle, and a metal ring on a stand. The ring is just big enough so that when the ring and ball are at the same temperature, the ball fits through the ring. However, if the ball is heated by dipping it into boiling water or playing the flame of a spirit lamp over it, the metal will expand, and the ball will no longer fit through the ring. When the ball has cooled down, it will fit through the ring again. This is &#x27;s Gravesande&#x27;s own description of his experiment, under the heading &quot;Of the Dilatation arising from Heat&quot;:

<text>Coldbackie () is a crofting township in Sutherland and is in the Scottish council area of Highland Scotland.

==Geography==
Coldbackie lies at the mouth of the Kyle of Tongue, north east of Tongue. It sits under Cnoc an Fhreiceadain (the Watch Hill), looking north across Tongue Bay to the Rabbit Islands. It is one of a series of townships, running from Tongue along the A836 to Blandy. The township of Scullomie is to the north.

==Etymology==
The name Coldbackie could have old Norse or Gaelic roots. The place name Coldbackie is not unique to the Kyle of Tongue, with there being two Coldbacks in Shetland (in Unst and Delting) and one in north west Iceland, both areas where Norse roots would be more likely. Omand, in &quot;The Sutherland book&quot;, translates Coldbackie as kula-bakki, bank with the bump, whilst Stewart, in &quot;Place names of Shetland&quot; says that Coldbacks is Cold Hill.

<text>William Owen Chadwick (20 May 1916 – 17 July 2015) was a British Anglican priest, academic, rugby international, writer and prominent historian of Christianity. As a leading academic, Chadwick became Dixie Professor of Ecclesiastical History in 1958, serving until 1968, and from 1968 to 1983 was Regius Professor of History. Chadwick was elected master of Selwyn College, Cambridge, and served from 1956 to 1983.

In his obituaries, Chadwick was described as &quot;one of the great religious historians of our time&quot; by &quot;The Independent&quot;, and as &quot;one of the most remarkable men of letters of the 20th century&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Chadwick was born in Bromley, Kent, in 1916, the third of six children of John Chadwick, a barrister, and his wife Edith (née Horrocks). His father died in 1925. He was an elder brother of the Very Reverend Henry Chadwick, also a distinguished professor and historian of the early Church, and a younger brother of Sir John Chadwick KCMG, a diplomat whose senior posting was as British Ambassador to Romania.

His eldest brother was sent to Eton College, but Chadwick was educated at Tonbridge School from 1929 to 1935. He was school captain and captain of the rugby team. He then studied classics at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He received three Blues in rugby playing as hooker for Cambridge University R.U.F.C. in the annual Varsity Match against Oxford University in 1936, 1937 and 1938 (as captain). In 1936, during his first year at Cambridge, he was selected to tour with a British Lions team in their third trip to Argentina. Although no caps were awarded on this tour, Chadwick did play in the one match against the full Argentina side, playing in his favoured position of hooker in a 23–0 victory. The British team won all ten of its matches. During the 1937/38 season, Chadwick played for invitational touring side, the Barbarians.

Chadwick graduated with a First in History in 1938. Having been influenced by Martin Charlesworth and Martin Niemöller in 1938, he took a First in theology at Cambridge in 1939. He then attended Cuddesdon Theological College and was ordained to the diaconate and priesthood of the Church of England in 1940 and 1941, respectively.

He served as a curate at St John&#x27;s Church in Huddersfield for two years and was then chaplain of Wellington College in Berkshire until the end of the Second World War.

He also played rugby during the war, for Blackheath, and for an England team that played against New Zealand.

==Cambridge career==
After the war, he was made chaplain and Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1947, and then Dean of Chapel. He became a university theology lecturer in 1949 and published his first book on the 5th-century monk John Cassian in 1950.

In 1958 he was named Dixie Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Cambridge University. He then became an honorary fellow at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1964. A few years later, in 1968, he was elected to the position of Regius Professor of Modern History, an ancient chair, which he held until 1982, and was President of the British Academy during the early 1980s. As vice-chancellor from 1969 to 1971, he guided Cambridge through turbulent times in the late 1960s, including the Garden House riot in 1970. He was also elected president of Cambridge University RFC in 1973.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he was suggested as a potential Archbishop of Canterbury, but is thought to have declined the offer of a bishop&#x27;s mitre more than once. He chaired the Archbishops&#x27; Commission on Church and State (1966–1970), known as the Chadwick Commission, which recommended that Parliament should pass the regulation of the church to a General Synod rather than disestablishment.

He was Hensley Henson Lecturer in Theology at Oxford University in 1975–76, and Ford Lecturer in English History at Oxford in 1980–81. He retired as Regius Professor and master of Selwyn College, Cambridge, in 1983. He had become a fellow of the British Academy in 1962, and was its president from 1981 to 1985. He was also a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery from 1978 to 1994, and was chancellor of the University of East Anglia from 1984 to 1994.

Owen Chadwick served as a member of the Historical Manuscripts Commission for a period prior to 1992.

==Selwyn College, Cambridge==

Chadwick was elected master of Selwyn College, Cambridge, in 1955. Installed in 1956, Chadwick was the longest-serving Master of Selwyn by the time he retired after 27 years, in 1983. During his time as master, Selwyn became a full college of Cambridge University, in 1958 (though it had been founded back in 1882), and it ceased to require its students to be communicant members of the Church of England. As Master of Selwyn, Chadwick completed several major building projects, including the new Cripps Court (not to be confused with the similarly named Cripps at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge). Selwyn College was not the first Oxbridge college to admit women students alongside men, but it adopted the practice relatively early on in 1976. Under Chadwick&#x27;s years as master, the numbers of fellows and postgraduates at Selwyn were doubled, greatly increasing the research output of the college. Chadwick took a keen interest in college sports and was elected to membership of the Hermes Club.

==Books==
Chadwick wrote about such issues as the formation of the papacy in the modern world; about Lord Acton; about the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century; about the Church of England in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, and about the secularisation of Europe in thought and culture. He participated in the debate about the role of Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust during World War II.

With his brother, Henry, Chadwick edited the &quot;Oxford History of the Christian Church&quot; (1981–2010), to which he contributed three of its twelve volumes: &quot;The Popes and European Revolution&quot; (1980); &quot;A History of the Popes 1830–1914&quot; (1998); and &quot;The Early Reformation on the Continent&quot; (2003). Chadwick was awarded the Wolfson History Prize in 1981.

Owen Chadwick was also General Editor of the Penguin (formerly Pelican) &quot;History of the Church&quot;, to which he contributed the third volume (&quot;The Reformation&quot;), the seventh (&quot;The Christian Church in the Cold War&quot;, 1992) and the last two chapters of the sixth (&quot;A History of Christian Missions&quot;, second edition 1986). His brother Henry wrote the first volume in the series (&quot;The Early Church&quot;, 1967).

Among Chadwick&#x27;s other books are:
* &quot;John Cassian: A Study in Primitive Monasticism&quot; (1950)
* &quot;The Founding of Cuddesdon&quot; (1954)
* &quot;From Bossuet to Newman&quot; (1957)
* &quot;The Sayings of the Fathers&quot; (1958)
* &quot;Mackenzie’s Grave&quot; (1959) (on a bishop sent to the Zambesi in the 19th century)
* &quot;Victorian Miniature&quot; (1960) (based on parallel diaries of the squire and parson at Ketteringham in Norfolk covering several decades of the early 19th century) 
* &quot;The Victorian Church&quot; (in two volumes, 1966 and 1970)
* &quot;The Secularization of the European Mind in the 19th Century&quot; (1975) (based on his Gifford Lectures in 1973–74)
* &quot;Newman&quot; (in the OUP&#x27;s &quot;Past Masters&quot; series; 1983) 
* &quot;Hensley Henson: A study in the Friction between Church and State&quot; (1983)
* &quot;A History of Christianity&quot; (1995)
* &quot;The Early Reformation on the Continent&quot; (2001)

==Honours==
Chadwick was appointed Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1982 New Year Honours. As a priest he did not receive the accolade and so remained styled as &quot;The Revd Owen Chadwick&quot; rather than &quot;Sir Owen Chadwick&quot;. He was appointed to the Order of Merit (OM) on 11 November 1983. A memorial to him and his brother was unveiled at Westminster Abbey on 2 February 2018.

==Personal life==
Chadwick married Ruth Hallward in 1949; she died before him, in January 2015. He was survived by two sons and two daughters. Chadwick died at the age of 99 on 17 July 2015.

After retiring, Chadwick lived with his wife in Newnham, in Cambridge, but also spent time in Cley next the Sea in Norfolk, where he was priest in charge.

<doc id="1092960" wikidata="Q1013015" url="?curid=1092960" title="Redcliff, Alberta">
<text>Redcliff is a town in southern Alberta, Canada. Adjacent to the City of Medicine Hat to the east and Cypress County to the west and north, the town is bisected by Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) and is located on the north bank of the South Saskatchewan River.

Situated at a high elevation relative to the surrounding landscape, the Town of Redcliff offers views of the South Saskatchewan River valley, the City of Medicine Hat, and Cypress Hills. The cliffs that overlook the river valley resemble badland formations.

== History ==

Redcliff&#x27;s history began in the 1880s with the discovery of abundant coal and natural gas reserves. Access to this inexpensive resource led to Redcliff being promoted as the &quot;Smokeless manufacturing centre of the West&quot;. This drew industries that manufactured diverse products such as shoes, gloves, cigars, trucks, bricks, glass, and flour among others. On June 25, 1915, a violent F4 tornado (at the time called a cyclone) ravaged several of these businesses, thus starting a decline in Redcliff&#x27;s economy. World War I and a flu epidemic ended the economic prosperity. The community experienced a resurgence in growth following World War II.

===Name===

The name of the town originated from the elevated red shale banks of the South Saskatchewan River. Currently, &quot;Redcliff&quot; is spelled as one word without an &#x27;E&#x27;, however historically it has been spelled &quot;Redcliffe&quot;, &quot;Red Cliff&quot;, and &quot;Red-Cliff&quot;.

Originally, the town was slated to be named &quot;Stonerville&quot;, after the town&#x27;s doctor.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Redcliff had a population of 5,581 living in 2,186 of its 2,276 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 5,600. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Redcliff recorded a population of 5,600 living in 2,159 of its 2,232 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 5,588. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

In 2022 Redcliff had a total population of 6,104 a year over year increase of 3.83%.

== Economy ==
The primary industries that support the local economy relate to oil and gas and the climate of southern Alberta. Numerous businesses in Redcliff and area provide drilling and pipeline services to support the oil and gas industry. The area&#x27;s sunny climate and abundance of affordable natural gas reserves has contributed to the establishment of a sizable greenhouse industry. Greenhouse products include vegetables (sweet bell peppers, beefsteak tomatoes, tomatoes on the vine, and long English cucumbers), a variety of flowering plants, and some trees.

In the past, Redcliff was known for the production of glass, brick and pottery products. Some of these factories have since moved to Medicine Hat, such as the IXL brick plant, while others are no longer in existence.

Redcliff is a member of the Economic Development Alliance of Southeast Alberta.

<doc id="1092962" wikidata="Q1296446" url="?curid=1092962" title="Hiawatha (Milwaukee Road trains)">
<text>The Hiawathas were a fleet of named passenger trains operated by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (also known as the Milwaukee Road) between Chicago and various destinations in the Midwest and Western United States. The most notable of these trains was the original &quot;Twin Cities Hiawatha&quot;, which served the Twin Cities in Minnesota. The train was named for the epic poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The current Amtrak &quot;Hiawatha&quot; train is directly descended from the Milwaukee Road trains.

==History==

The first &quot;Hiawatha&quot; trains ran in 1935. By 1948, five routes carried the &quot;Hiawatha&quot; name:

*The &quot;Twin Cities Hiawatha&quot; — the main line route from Chicago through Milwaukee to St. Paul and Minneapolis, in &quot;Morning&quot; and &quot;Afternoon&quot; editions
*The &quot;North Woods Hiawatha&quot; — a spur route off the Chicago-Minnesota main line leading from New Lisbon to Minocqua, Wisconsin
*The &quot;Chippewa-Hiawatha&quot; — connected Chicago to Ontonagon in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula via Milwaukee and Green Bay, Wisconsin
*The &quot;Midwest Hiawatha&quot; — used the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s mainline across Illinois and Iowa to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Omaha, Nebraska (the train split into two parts in Manilla, Iowa)
*The &quot;Olympian Hiawatha&quot; — which traversed the Milwaukee mainline from Chicago-Twin Cities-Seattle/Tacoma.

===Twin Cities Hiawatha===

The &quot;Twin Cities Hiawatha&quot; was the original &quot;Hiawatha&quot;, beginning service between Chicago and the Twin Cities on May 29, 1935. The &quot;Hiawatha&quot; used styled streamlined Class A 4-4-2 steam locomotives built by the American Locomotive Company and was intended to compete directly with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad&#x27;s (Burlington Route) &quot;Twin Cities Zephyrs&quot; and Chicago and North Western Railway&#x27;s &quot;Twin Cities 400&quot;.

The Milwaukee Road added a second train to the route on January 21, 1939, and the two trains were known as the &quot;Morning Hiawatha&quot; and &quot;Afternoon Hiawatha&quot;, although the brand &quot;Twin Cities Hiawatha&quot; was often employed. In 1947–1948, the Milwaukee Road again re-equipped its major passenger routes with new lightweight equipment. The &quot;Morning Hiawatha&quot; (trains 5 and 6) and &quot;Afternoon Hiawatha&quot; (trains 3 and 2) continued to operate between Chicago and Minneapolis until the latter train was discontinued on January 23, 1970. The last runs of the &quot;Morning Hiawatha&quot; were on April 30, 1971, immediately prior to the introduction of Amtrak.

===Midwest Hiawatha===

With the delivery of the 1938 trainsets, the original 1935 &quot;Hiawatha&quot; equipment was reassigned to the Chicago to Omaha/Sioux City route where it ran as the &quot;Midwest Hiawatha&quot;. The service began on December 11, 1940. The final trip for the &quot;Midwest Hiawatha&quot; from all terminals occurred on October 29, 1955. On the next day, October 30, 1955, the Milwaukee Road assumed operation of Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;City of Los Angeles&quot;, &quot;City of Denver&quot;, &quot;City of Portland&quot; and &quot;Challenger&quot; trains. The &quot;Midwest Hiawatha&quot; became two Sioux Falls-Chicago coaches that combined with the &quot;Challenger&quot; in Manilla. The Milwaukee Road dropped the name altogether in April 1956.

===North Woods Hiawatha===

The &quot;North Woods Hiawatha&quot; began in June 1936, branching off from the main &quot;Hiawatha&quot; route in New Lisbon, Wisconsin, to serve Minocqua, Wisconsin. The Milwaukee Road dropped the &quot;Hiawatha&quot; moniker in 1956 and discontinued the service altogether in 1970.

===Olympian Hiawatha===

A new long-distance &quot;Hiawatha,&quot; the &quot;Olympian Hiawatha&quot; from Chicago to the Pacific Northwest, was inaugurated in 1947. The sleeper cars and Skytop sleepers were not delivered until late 1948 and early 1949, so the train ran with Pullman heavyweights on the rear end, until delivery of the new cars. The train was designed by the famous designer Brooks Stevens of Milwaukee. Six &quot;Creek&quot;-series 8-bedroom Skytop lounge-sleepers were created, which had more windows and a more bulbous rear end than their &quot;Rapids&quot;-series parlor Skytop counterparts on the &quot;Morning Hiawatha&quot; and &quot;Afternoon Hiawatha&quot;. This train ceased operations on May 22, 1961, and the surplus equipment was sold to Canadian National Railways. One car, #15 &quot;Coffee Creek&quot; from the &quot;Olympian Hiawatha&quot;, is undergoing restoration.

===Chippewa-Hiawatha===

The &quot;Chippewa&quot; began in May 1937, running north through Milwaukee and Green Bay to Channing, Michigan (later extended to Ontonagon). It carried the &quot;Hiawatha&quot; moniker between 1948-1957 and was discontinued in 1960.

===Amtrak===
Under Amtrak, which assumed control of most intercity passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, the &quot;Hiawatha&quot; name survived in two forms. The first was a Chicago–Milwaukee–Minneapolis service, known simply as the &quot;Hiawatha&quot;. This would be renamed the &quot;Twin Cities Hiawatha&quot;, then extended to Seattle and renamed the &quot;North Coast Hiawatha&quot;. This service ended in 1979. In 2024, Amtrak reinstated Chicago–Milwaukee–St. Paul service with the &quot;Borealis&quot;. 

The second was a Chicago–Milwaukee corridor known as the &quot;Hiawatha Service&quot; (as opposed to &quot;Hiawatha&quot;). Although Amtrak had retained Chicago–Milwaukee service during the transition, it did not name these trains until October 29, 1972. At this time both &quot;Hiawatha&quot; and &quot;Hiawatha Service&quot; could be found on the same timetable. Amtrak used a variety of names for this service between 1976–1989 before returning to the &quot;Hiawatha Service&quot; brand, which remains somewhat in use today and continues to use the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s (now Canadian Pacific and in-name-only subsidiary Soo Line Railroad) route between Chicago and Milwaukee.

==Legacy==
The &quot;All Aboard! 20th Century American Trains&quot; series of postage stamps from the United States Postal Service commemorated a &quot;Hiawatha&quot; train pulled by an F7-class 4-6-4 locomotive.

<text>East Dane is an Anglo-Saxon ethnonym which was used in the epic &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

It was also used in an Anglo-Saxon runic poem describing the first appearance of the god Frey (called &quot;Ing&quot;, see Yngvi):

<doc id="1092967" wikidata="Q4849461" url="?curid=1092967" title="Bakka-Phoenix">
<text>Bakka-Phoenix Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Bookstore is an independent bookstore in Toronto, Ontario, which specializes in science fiction and fantasy literature.

== History ==
Bakka was started on Toronto&#x27;s Queen Street West in May 1972 as a combined science-fiction and comic book store called Bakka, a name taken by founding owner Charles McKee from a Fremen legend in Frank Herbert&#x27;s novel &quot;Dune&quot;. The comic book business split off early on, becoming The Silver Snail, originally located on the opposite side of Queen Street West.

Bakka published &quot;Bakka Magazine&quot; from 1975-77.

The store moved in March 1998 to 598 Yonge Street in Toronto, the same building as the Glad Day Bookshop, and relocated in March 2005 to 697 Queen Street West in Toronto. 

In November 2010, the store moved again, this time to larger quarters at 84 Harbord Street, adjacent to the main campus of the University of Toronto, in the Harbord Village neighbourhood. The new building has a ground floor devoted to new books; a downstairs devoted to media tie-ins, related nonfiction, and used books; and an upstairs function room available for book club meetings and similar events. Although the previous locations were rental sites, the store owns the Harbord Street building.

Bakka originally had a substantial stock of used books, but when the store moved to its 1998 location, the reduced space meant that emphasis shifted almost entirely to new books; with the November 2010 move, it went back to having a significant used-book section. Unlike many other science-fiction specialty stores, Bakka has remained almost exclusively a bookstore; it does not sell toys, games, comics, memorabilia, or collectibles.

At the original location, the store styled its name as &quot;Bakka: A Science Fiction Book Shoppe&quot;. The signage out front in later years there was a space mural by Toronto artist Kevin Davies. At the 697 Queen Street location, the store styled itself as &quot;BakkaPhoenix Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Bookstore&quot;, with signage graphics by John Rose, owner of the store at the time. The signage at the 84 Harbord location, also with graphics by Rose, adds a hyphen, styling it as &quot;Bakka-Phoenix Books: Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Bookstore&quot;.

Its third owner, Ben Freiman, bought the store in 2003 from Rose; he appended &quot;Phoenix&quot; to the store&#x27;s name to mark the new ownership, although the clientele still mostly refer to the store as just &quot;Bakka&quot;. Freiman made no changes to the staff; Christine Szego was manager until 2018. After retiring, she was replaced with Scott Dagostino, who left in 2020. The current manager is Becca Lovatt.

Several noted Canadian science fiction and fantasy authors, including Robert J. Sawyer, Tanya Huff, Cory Doctorow, and Nalo Hopkinson, have been employed by the store. In honor of the store&#x27;s 30th anniversary, &quot;The Bakka Anthology&quot;, containing new stories by all of these writers with an introduction by Spider Robinson, was published in 2002. The anthology was edited by Kristen Pederson Chew, and was the final volume released under the Bakka Books imprint, established by then-owner John Rose.

<text>The Internationale is a 1990 album by Billy Bragg. Originally released on Bragg&#x27;s short-lived record label, Utility Records, it is a deliberately political album, consisting mainly of cover versions and rewrites of left-wing protest songs. Although Bragg is known for his association with left-wing causes, this release is unusual; most of Bragg&#x27;s recordings balance overtly political songs with social observation and love songs.

The album peaked at number 34 on the UK Albums Chart in May 1990.

==Versions==
The album was originally released as a seven-track EP in 1990.

In 2006, as part of a planned series of reissues of albums in his back catalogue, &quot;The Internationale&quot; was remastered and reissued along with the seven tracks from 1988&#x27;s &quot;Live &amp; Dubious&quot; EP and five bonus tracks. Also included is a bonus DVD titled &quot;Here and There&quot; containing live concerts from East Berlin, Nicaragua and the Soviet Union.

<text>Goa Rajiv Congress Party (GRCP), was a splinter group of Indian National Congress in Goa. It was founded in 1998 by Wilfred de Souza. It formed a coalition state government with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, with de Souza as Chief Minister. In the split from INC de Souza took with him several local branches of the Congress party and the entire Youth Congress and National Students Union of India (Congress student wing) branches in the state.

Ahead of the Goa assembly elections 1999 GRCP launched 14 candidates, out of whom two were elected (Wilfred de Souza and Francis D&#x27;Souza). In total the party received 36 570 votes. Shortly after the elections GRCP merged with Nationalist Congress Party. 

Francis de Souza left NCP to rejoin the INC 5 November same year. He later joined BJP.

<doc id="1092981" wikidata="Q612137" url="?curid=1092981" title="Mayak">
<text>The Mayak Production Association (, , from &#x27;lighthouse&#x27;) is one of the largest nuclear facilities in the Russian Federation, housing a reprocessing plant. The closest settlements are Ozyorsk to the northwest and Novogornyi to the south.

Lavrentiy Beria led the Soviet atomic bomb project. He directed the construction of the Mayak Plutonium plant in the Southern Urals between 1945 and 1948, in a great hurry and secrecy as part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s atomic bomb project. Over 40,000 Gulag prisoners and POWs built the factory and the closed nuclear city of Ozyorsk, called at the time by its classified postal code &quot;Forty&quot;. Five (today closed) nuclear reactors were built to produce plutonium which was refined and machined for weapons. Later the plant came to specialise in reprocessing spent nuclear fuel from nuclear reactors and plutonium from decommissioned weapons.

Once production began, engineers quickly ran out of underground space to store high-level radioactive waste. Rather than cease production of plutonium until new underground waste storage tanks could be built, between 1949 and 1951, Soviet managers dumped of toxic chemicals, including 3.2 million curies of high-level radioactive waste into the Techa River, a slow-moving hydraulic system that bogs down in swamps and lakes.

As many as 40 villages, with a combined population of about 28,000, lined the river at the time. For 24 of them, the Techa was a major source of water; 23 of them were eventually evacuated. In the 45 years afterwards, about half a million people in the region have been irradiated in one or more of the incidents, exposing them to up to 20 times the radiation suffered by the Chernobyl disaster victims outside of the plant itself.

Investigators in 1951 found communities along the river highly contaminated. On discovery, soldiers immediately evacuated the first downriver village of Metlino, population 1,200, where radiation levels measured 3.5–5 rads/hr (35–50 mGy/hr or 10–14 μGy/s). At that rate, people would get the equivalent of a lifetime exposure to radiation in less than a week. During the following decade, ten additional communities were resettled from the river, but the largest community, Muslumovo, remained. Researchers investigated residents of Muslumovo annually in what has become a four-generation living experiment of people living among chronic, low doses of radioactivity. Blood samples showed its villagers took in caesium-137, ruthenium-106, strontium-90, and iodine-131, internally and externally. These isotopes had deposited in organs, flesh and bone marrow. Villagers complained of various illnesses and symptoms—chronic fatigue, sleep and fertility problems, weight loss, and increased hypertension. The frequency of congenital disabilities and complications at birth was three times greater than normal. In 1953, doctors examined 587 of 28,000 exposed people and found that 200 had clear cases of radiation poisoning.

In 1957 Mayak was the site of the Kyshtym disaster, which at the time was the worst nuclear accident in history. During this catastrophe, a poorly maintained storage tank exploded, releasing 20 million curies (740 PBq) in the form of 50–100 tons of high-level radioactive waste. The resulting radioactive cloud contaminated an expansive territory of more than (a nine-mile radius) in the eastern Urals, causing sickness and death from radiation poisoning.

The Soviet government kept this accident secret for about 30 years. It is rated at 6 on the seven-level INES scale. It is third in severity, surpassed only by Chernobyl in Ukraine and Fukushima in Japan.

Mayak is still active , and it serves as a reprocessing site for spent nuclear fuel. Today the plant makes tritium and radioisotopes, not plutonium. In recent years, proposals that the plant reprocess waste from foreign nuclear reactors have given rise to controversy.

An incompletely reported accident appears to have occurred in September 2017; see Airborne radioactivity increase in Europe in autumn 2017.

==Location==
The nuclear complex is 150 km south of Ekaterinburg, between the towns of Kasli and Tatysh, and 100 km northwest of Chelyabinsk. The closest city, Ozyorsk, is the central administrative territorial district. As part of the Russian (formerly Soviet) nuclear weapons program, Mayak was formerly known as Chelyabinsk-40 and later as Chelyabinsk-65, referring to the postal codes of the site.

==Design and structure==
Mayak&#x27;s nuclear facility plant covers about . The site borders Ozyorsk, in which a majority of the staff of Mayak live. Mayak itself was not shown on Soviet public maps. The location of the site together with the plant city was chosen to minimise the effects that harmful emissions could potentially have on populated areas. Mayak is surrounded by a ~ exclusion zone. Nearby is the site of the South Urals nuclear power plant.

=== Notes ===
==History==
Built in total secrecy between 1945 and 1948, the Mayak plant was the first reactor used to create plutonium for the Soviet atomic bomb project. In accordance with Stalinist procedure and supervised by NKVD Chief Lavrentiy Beria, it was the utmost priority to produce enough weapons-grade material to match the U.S. nuclear superiority following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Little to no consideration was paid to worker safety or responsible disposal of waste materials, and the reactors were all optimised for plutonium production, producing many tons of contaminated materials and utilising primitive open-cycle cooling systems which directly contaminated the thousands of gallons of cooling water the reactors used every day.

Lake Kyzyltash was the largest natural lake capable of providing cooling water to the reactors; it was rapidly contaminated via the open-cycle system. The closer Lake Karachay, too small to provide sufficient cooling water, was used as a dumping ground for large quantities of high-level radioactive waste too &quot;hot&quot; to store in the facility&#x27;s underground storage vats. The original plan was to use the lake to store highly radioactive material until it could be returned to the Mayak facility&#x27;s underground concrete storage vats, but this proved impossible due to the lethal levels of radioactivity (see Pollution of Lake Karachay). The lake was used for this purpose until the Kyshtym Disaster in 1957, in which the underground vats exploded due to a faulty cooling system. This incident caused widespread contamination of the entire Mayak area (as well as a large swath of territory to the northeast). This led to greater caution among the administration, fearing international attention, and caused the dumping grounds to be spread out over a variety of areas (including several lakes and the Techa River, along which many villages lay).

===Kyshtym disaster===
Working conditions at Mayak resulted in severe health hazards and many accidents. The most notable accident occurred on 29 September 1957, when the failure of the cooling system for a tank storing tens of thousands of tons of dissolved nuclear waste resulted in a chemical (non-nuclear) explosion having an energy estimated at 75 tons of TNT (310 gigajoules). This released 740 PBq (20 MCi) of fission products, of which 74 PBq (2 MCi) drifted off the site, creating a contaminated region of called the East Urals Radioactive trace. Subsequently, an estimated 49 to 55 people died of radiation-induced cancer, 66 were diagnosed with chronic radiation syndrome, 10,000 people were evacuated from their homes, and 470,000 people were exposed to radiation.

The Soviet Union did not release news of the accident and denied it happened for nearly 30 years. Residents of Chelyabinsk district in the Southern Urals reported observing &quot;polar-lights&quot; in the sky near the plant, and American aerial spy photos had documented the destruction caused by the disaster by 1960. This nuclear accident, the Soviet Union&#x27;s worst before the Chernobyl disaster, is categorised as a Level 6 &quot;Serious Accident&quot; on the 0–7 International Nuclear Events Scale.

When Zhores Medvedev exposed the disaster in a 1976 article in &quot;New Scientist&quot;, some exaggerated claims circulated in the absence of any verifiable information from the Soviet Union. People &quot;grew hysterical with fear with the incidence of unknown &#x27;mysterious&#x27; diseases breaking out. Victims were seen with skin &#x27;sloughing off&#x27; their faces, hands and other exposed parts of their bodies.&quot; As Zhores wrote, &quot;Hundreds of square miles were left barren and unusable for decades and maybe centuries. Hundreds of people died, thousands were injured and surrounding areas were evacuated.&quot; Professor Leo Tumerman, former head of the Biophysics Laboratory at the Institute of Molecular Biology in Moscow, disclosed what he knew of the accident around the same time. Russian documents gradually declassified from 1989 onward show the true events were less severe than rumoured.

According to Gyorgy, who invoked the Freedom of Information Act to open up the relevant Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) files, the CIA knew of the 1957 Mayak accident, but kept it secret to prevent adverse consequences for the fledgling US nuclear industry. &quot;Ralph Nader surmised that the information had not been released because of the reluctance of the CIA to highlight a nuclear accident in the USSR, that could cause concern among people living near nuclear facilities in the USA.&quot; Only in 1992, shortly after the fall of the USSR, did the Russians officially acknowledge the accident.

===1968 Criticality Incident===

In December 1968, the facility was experimenting with plutonium purification techniques. Two operators were using an &quot;unfavourable geometry vessel in an improvised and unapproved operation as a temporary vessel for storing plutonium organic solution.&quot; &quot;Unfavourable geometry&quot; means that the vessel was too compact, reducing the amount of plutonium needed to achieve a critical mass to less than the amount present. After most of the solution had been poured out, there was a flash of light and heat. After the complex had been evacuated, the shift supervisor and radiation control supervisor re-entered the building. The shift supervisor then entered the room of the incident, caused another, larger nuclear reaction and irradiated himself with a deadly dose of radiation.

===2017 radiation release===

Abnormally high levels of radiation were reported in the area of the facility in November 2017. Simultaneously, traces of radioactive manmade isotope Ruthenium-106 spread across Europe in September and October. Such a release had not been seen on a continental scale since the Chernobyl accident. In January 2018, the French Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Security (IRSN) reported that the source of the contamination is located in the Volga – Southern Ural region between 25 and 28 September for a duration of less than 24 hours. The report excludes the possibility of an accidental release from a nuclear reactor, stating that it seems related with irradiated fuels processing or the production of sources from fission products solution. It may point to Mayak&#x27;s aborted attempt to manufacture a capsule of highly radioactive component cerium-144, for the SOX project in Italy. Both the Russian government and Rosatom denied at the time that another accidental leak took place at Mayak. The release of a cloud of ruthenium-106 is similar to the B205 reprocessing accident in Britain in 1973.

In the early years of its operation, the Mayak plant directly discharged high-level nuclear waste into several small lakes near the plant, and into the Techa River, whose waters ultimately flow into the Ob River. According to the data of the Department of Natural Resources in the Ural Region, in the year 2000, more than of water containing thousands of curies of tritium, strontium, and cesium-137 were discharged into the Techa River. The tritium concentration alone in the river near the village of Muslyumovo exceeds the permissible limit by 30 times.

Rosatom, a state-owned nuclear operations corporation, began to resettle residents of Muslyumovo in 2006. However, only half of the residents of the village were moved.  People continue to live in the immediate area of the plant, including Ozyorsk and other downstream areas. Residents report no problems with their health and the health of Mayak plant workers. However, these claims lack verification, and many who worked at the plant in 1950s and 1960s subsequently died from the effects of radiation. The administration of the Mayak plant has been repeatedly criticized in recent years by Greenpeace and other environmental advocates for environmentally unsound practices.

==List of accidents==
The Mayak plant is associated with two other major nuclear accidents. The first occurred as a result of heavy rains causing Lake Karachay, a dried-up radioactively polluted lake (used as a dumping basin for Mayak&#x27;s radioactive waste since 1951), to release radioactive material into surrounding waters. The second occurred in 1967 when wind spread dust from the bottom of Lake Karachay over parts of Ozyorsk; over 400,000 people were irradiated..

===Major accidents at Mayak, 1953–1998===
&quot;Source&quot;:
* 15 March 1953 – Criticality accident. Contamination of plant personnel occurred.
* 13 October 1955 – Rupture of process equipment and the destruction of a process building.
* 21 April 1957 – Criticality accident. One operator died from receiving over 3000 rad. Five others received doses of 300 to 1,000 rem and temporarily became sick with radiation poisoning.
* 29 September 1957 – Kyshtym disaster.
* 2 January 1958 – Criticality accident in SCR plant. Plant workers conducted experiments to determine the critical mass of enriched uranium in a cylindrical container with different concentrations of uranium in solution. Personnel received doses from 7600 to 13,000 rem, resulting in three deaths and one case of blindness caused by radiation sickness. 
* 12 May 1960 – Criticality accident. Five people were contaminated.
* 26 February 1962 – Destruction of equipment. An explosion occurred in the absorption column.
* 9 July 1962 – Criticality accident.
* 16 December 1965 – Criticality accident. Seventeen individuals received exposure to small amounts of radiation over a period of 14 hours.
* 10 December 1968 – Criticality accident. Plutonium solution was poured into a cylindrical container with dangerous geometry. One person died, another took a high dose of radiation and radiation sickness, after which he had both legs and his right arm amputated.
* 11 February 1976 – Unsafe actions of staff development at the radiochemical plant caused an autocatalytic reaction of concentrated nitric acid and organic liquid complex composition. The device exploded, contaminating the repair zone and areas around the plant. The incident merited an International Nuclear Event Scale rating of 3.
* 10 February 1984 – Explosion. 
* 16 November 1990 – Explosion. Two people received burns and one was killed.
* 17 July 1993 – Accident at radioisotope plant, resulting in the destruction of the absorption column and release into the environment of a small amount of α-aerosols. Radiation emission was localised at the manufacturing facility of the shop.
* 8 February 1993 – Depressurisation of a pipeline caused of radioactive slurry (about of contaminated surface) to leak to the surface of the pulp radioactive activity of about 0.3 Ci. Radioactive trace was localised, contaminated soil removed.
* 27 December 1993 – Incident at radioisotope plant where the replacement of a filter resulted in the release into the atmosphere of radioactive aerosols. Emissions were on the α-activity of 0.033 Ci, and β-activity of 0.36 mCi.
* 4 February 1994 – Recorded increased release of radioactive aerosols: the β-activity of 2-day levels of Cs-137 subsistence levels, the total activity of 7.15 mCi.
* 30 March 1994 – Recorded excess daily release of Cs-137 in 3, β-activity – 1,7, α-activity – by 1.9 times. In May 1994 the ventilation system of the building of the plant spewed activity 10.4 mCi β-aerosols. Emission of Cs-137 was 83% of the control level.
* 7 July 1994 – The control plant detected a radioactive spot area of several square decimetres. Exposure dose was 500 millirems per second. The spot was formed by leaking sewage.
* 31 August 1994 – Registered an increased release of radionuclides to the atmospheric pipe building reprocessing plant (238.8 mCi, with the share of Cs-137 was 4.36% of the annual emission limit of this radionuclide). The reason for the release of radionuclides was depressurisation of VVER-440 fuel elements during the operation segments idle all SFA (spent fuel assemblies) as a result of an uncontrollable arc.
* 24 March 1995 – Recorded excess of 19% of normal loading apparatus plutonium, which can be regarded as a dangerous nuclear incident.
* 15 September 1995 – High-level liquid radioactive waste (LRW) was found in flow of cooling water. Operation of a furnace into the regulatory regime has been discontinued.
* 21 December 1995 – Cutting of a thermometric channel exposed four workers (1.69, 0.59, 0.45, 0.34 rem) when operators violated process procedures.
* 24 July 1995 – Cs-137 aerosols released, the value of which amounted to 0.27% of the annual value of MPE for the enterprise. 
* 14 September 1995 – Replacement covers and lubrication step manipulators registered a sharp increase in airborne α-nuclides.
* 22 October 1996 – Depressurisation occurred in a coil while channeling cooling water from one storage tanks of high-level waste. The result was contaminated pipe cooling system repositories. As a result of this incident, 10 people were exposed to radiation dose of 2.23 to 48 milli-Sieverts.
* 20 November 1996 – A chemical-metallurgical plant in the works on the electrical exhaust fan caused aerosol release of radionuclides into the atmosphere, which made up 10% of the allowed annual emissions of the plant.
* 27 August 1997 – In building RT-1 in one of the rooms was found to be contaminated floor area of 1 to 2 m2, the dose rate of gamma radiation from the spot was between 40 and 200 mR / s.
* 6 October 1997 – Recorded increasing radioactivity in the assembly building, the RT-1. Measurement of the exposure dose indicated up to 300 mR / s.
* 23 September 1998 – While increasing power output of reactor P-2 (&quot;Lyudmila&quot;) after engaging automatic protection allowable power level was exceeded by 10%. As a result, the three channels of the fuel rod seal failed, resulting in the contamination of equipment and pipelines of the first circuit.

====Notes====
===More recent major accidents===
* In 2003, the plant&#x27;s operating licence was revoked temporarily due to liquid radioactive waste handling procedures resulting in waste being disposed into open water.
* In June 2007, an accident involving a radioactive pulp occurred over a two-day period.
* In October 2007, a valve failure during transport of a radioactive liquid resulted in spilling of a radioactive material.
* In 2008, a repair worker was injured during a &quot;pneumatic&quot; incident, involving a quantity of alpha emitter release. The worker&#x27;s hand was injured and the wound contaminated. The worker&#x27;s finger was amputated in an attempt to minimize spread of alpha-particle emitters throughout his body and subsequent radiological consequences.
*In September 2017, possible association with the airborne radioactivity increase in Europe in autumn 2017. Russia confirms &#x27;extremely high&#x27; readings of radioactive pollution in Argayash, a village in the Chelyabinsk region of the southern Urals. Argayash is located 10 miles south of the Mayak plant. In January 2018, the French Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Security (IRSN) reported that Mayak could be the cause of the contamination. The radioactivity was due to Ru-106 indicating release from a late stage in the reprocessing (i.e. after the Ru-106 had been separated from other isotopes).

<doc id="1092982" wikidata="Q57279" url="?curid=1092982" title="Traian Băsescu">
<text>Traian Băsescu (; born 4 November 1951) is a Romanian conservative politician who served as the fifth president of Romania from 2004 to 2014. Prior to his presidency, Băsescu served as Romanian Minister of Transport on multiple occasions between 1991 and 2000, and as Mayor of Bucharest from 2000 to 2004. Additionally, he was elected as leader of the Democratic Party (PD) in 2001.

During his term as leader of the PD, the party formed the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA) with the National Liberal Party (PNL). Following Theodor Stolojan&#x27;s withdrawal from the presidential elections in 2004, Băsescu entered the presidential race on behalf of the alliance. After being elected president, he suspended his PD membership; Romanian law does not permit the incumbent president to be a member of a political party. He was subsequently re-elected in 2009.

In 2007, during his presidency, Romania acceded to the European Union (EU). He is the only president of Romania to have been suspended by the parliament twice, in 2007 and 2012. A former member of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), he has promoted social conservative, neoliberal and populist policies during his administration.

After ending his presidential term, in 2015, Băsescu joined the People&#x27;s Movement Party (PMP), of which he became president in 2016, subsequently resigning in 2018. He then served as Member of the European Parliament for Romania between 2019 and 2024.

==Early life==
Traian Băsescu was born in Basarabi (renamed Murfatlar in 2007), near the port city of Constanța, the largest Romanian port on the coast of the Black Sea. Băsescu&#x27;s father, Dumitru (1924–2002), was a retired army officer, whilst his mother, Elena (1929–2010) was an ordinary peasant or homemaker who died of breast cancer. His brother, Mircea (born 1953) was charged with influence peddling (in exchange for €250,000, he promised freedom to his godson Florin Anghel, an underworld member); Mircea was sentenced to four years in prison only after his brother&#x27;s mandate ended. Băsescu and his wife Maria have two daughters: Ioana (born 1977), a notary, and Elena (born 1980), a Romanian former MEP.

==Professional career==
Băsescu graduated from the Naval Institute of Constanța in 1976 and became a merchant marine deck officer at Navrom, the Romanian state-owned shipping company. Between 1981 and 1987, he served as captain on Romanian commercial ships. Throughout his career, questions have been raised about Băsescu&#x27;s links to the Securitate, the security services of the communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu. However, Băsescu has claimed that his links with the former Securitate were minimal, though some contact was obligatory at the time for somebody working abroad in a senior position. In 1984, he was promoted to Captain of the oil tanker &quot;Biruința&quot;, the largest ship of the then Romanian commercial fleet. In 1989, Băsescu moved to Belgium to head the Navrom Agency in Antwerp.

The most controversial episode of his professional career began on 10 September 1981 in the French port Rouen, when a fire started around the Romanian tanker &quot;Argeș&quot;, then under the command of Traian Băsescu, affecting a large portion of the Seine River. The fire destroyed two tugs and six barges, and major disaster was avoided when 70 French firemen from Rouen, Grand-Couronne, Grand-Quevilly, Canteleu, and Moulineaux prevented the fire from reaching the nearby Shell refinery. According to an interview given by Băsescu to the Romanian TV channel Prima TV on 23 June 1998 (and quoted by &quot;Magazin Nautic&quot;, the official publication of the Romanian Nautical Club), Băsescu admitted to having made alterations to the ship&#x27;s installation before the French investigators were allowed to come on board, a thing that — in Băsescu&#x27;s own words — made it impossible for the investigators to link the cause of the disaster to the Romanian ship.

==Earlier political career==
Băsescu was a member of the Communist Party before 1989. After the downfall of Communism, he claimed that he joined the PCR to promote his career in the merchant marines. In a letter published in Romanian newspapers, former president Emil Constantinescu alleged that Băsescu was in the second tier of the Communist Party leadership during the regime of former communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu, but had managed to portray himself as anti-communist. During an interview, Băsescu admitted that before 1989 he smuggled jeans and other goods. A former communist official, a director of a firm that was receiving the goods transported by Băsescu by ship, said on Antena 3 TV that without payment of a bribe, Băsescu refused to bring the goods in the country.

Băsescu entered politics after the 1989 Romanian Revolution, as a member of the large National Salvation Front (FSN) party.

== Political career ==

=== Minister of Transport ===
In April 1991, he became Minister of Transport in Petre Roman&#x27;s Cabinet, and continued to hold this position during Theodor Stolojan&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet of technocrats&quot; between September 1991 and November 1992. In 1992, after the FSN split into two factions—the Social Democratic Party of Romania (PDSR, later PSD), led by Ion Iliescu, and the Democratic Party (PD), led by Petre Roman, Băsescu joined the PD faction. In 1992, he was elected to the lower house of the Romanian Parliament, the Chamber of Deputies, then re-elected for the 1996–2000 term.

Concurrently with his second term in Parliament, from November 1996 to June 2000, Băsescu also served as Minister of Transport in the center-right governments of Victor Ciorbea, Radu Vasile, and Mugur Isărescu.

In December 1997, he gave an interview to Claudiu Săftoiu of the newspaper &quot;Evenimentul Zilei&quot;, in which he accused Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea of not implementing enough reforms, although Ciorbea was accused by the Socialist opposition of being excessively reformist. This became the first episode in an open dispute within the ruling center-right coalition, a dispute that eventually led to Democratic Party ministers, including Băsescu, resigning from the cabinet, which, in turn, led to Ciorbea&#x27;s resignation. Subsequently, in 1998, Băsescu resumed his previous ministerial position in the new cabinet headed by Radu Vasile.

During his tenure as Minister of Transportation, Băsescu oversaw the privatization of Romania&#x27;s merchant fleet. While some argued that the aging ships at the time were of minimal value, many Romanians believed the compensation received for the ships was artificially low. The &quot;scandal&quot; of the fleet sale became known in Romania as The Fleet File (&quot;Dosarul Flota&quot;) Affair. Prosecutors brought charges against Băsescu, but it was not proven that he was involved in any malfeasance. In 1996, Băsescu was the first Romanian parliamentarian to renounce his parliamentary immunity, in order to allow judicial procedures related to the Fleet File Affair to continue against him. (Romanian MPs were, by default, granted immunity from prosecution of any kind.) Although the case against him was closed at the time for lack of evidence, it was reopened in early 2004, in what some considered a political maneuver against him sponsored by the then PSD government. In 2004, the case was brought before the High Court of Cassation and Justice, however, the judges decided to send it back to the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office citing procedural errors (the signature of a prosecutor was missing). In December 2007, the Romanian National Anti-corruption Directorate (&quot;Direcția Națională Anticorupție&quot;), a subdivision of the General Prosecutor Office, decided to end the investigation, based on the opinion of financial expertise that there was no prejudicial dealing by the Romanian association NM Petromin SA Constanța with the Norwegian Torvald Klaveness Group between April 1991 and August 2000. However, the case is still open as this is only the latest published opinion, and the only one that serves as evidence in favor of Băsescu. Some have seen this as a political maneuver destined to prove his innocence. In total 136 people were investigated. 80, including Băsescu, were retained for the investigation of this case, while the facts pertaining to 51 others were separated for independent investigations.

=== Mayor of Bucharest ===
In 2000, Băsescu was elected mayor of Bucharest, winning the run-off against Social Democratic Party (PDSR) candidate Sorin Oprescu by a slim margin (50.69% to 49.31%), despite trailing him by 24% in the first round.

As mayor, he was credited with a reduction in the number of stray dogs roaming freely through the streets of the city, from approximately 300,000 in 2000 to 25,000 in 2004, and thus reducing the number of dog bite injuries from 1,500 a month to under 200 a month. This campaign was controversial, as many opposed large-scale dog euthanasia. On the other hand, there were also numerous cases of people asking the authorities to take the stray dogs away, but after this was done, neighbors, who had been feeding the dogs, would show up at the shelter to take them back to their neighborhoods. The campaign resulted in nearly 48,000 dogs being put down in 2001, with reduced numbers in the following years. In 2004, Băsescu called the campaign a success. Băsescu also claimed success in improvements to the city&#x27;s water and lighting systems, which were in a very bad state, as well as modernizing the city&#x27;s public transportation system.

However, his tenure was marked by constant conflicts with the governing Social Democratic Party (PSD)-controlled institutions. Citing the need for decentralization, the central government led by Adrian Năstase passed several ordinances transferring powers from the city mayor to mayors of the city&#x27;s six sectors, and to the city council. Băsescu accused council members of corruption and obstruction; he also successfully challenged several council resolutions in Administrative Courts. As a consequence, on 10 January 2002, the central government decided to dissolve the council, yet it later annulled that decision. These conflicts led to the blocking or delay of several infrastructure loans, financed by the European Investment Bank (BEI) for municipal heating and road networks, and to the blocking the city&#x27;s ability to borrow and finance reconstruction.

In February 2003, Băsescu bought a apartment from the state in a nationalized house downtown Bucharest for the equivalent of US$19,000. A scandal followed, as the request to buy the house was approved by the Mayor&#x27;s Office, at a time when Băsescu was mayor. He explained that he had filed an application in October 2002 with the specialized state agency (not to the Mayor&#x27;s office, which was not the owner of the building) for the apartment to be sold to him on the basis of the Romanian Law 10 of 2001, which he claimed &quot;gives priority to existing tenants to buy previously nationalized houses, no matter whether they already owned other houses,&quot; and that the price was calculated based on a 1995 law. However, the press noted that, according to the contract, the sale was based on Law 112 of 1995, and that Law 10/2001 had no provisions about selling anything. The 1995 law prevents, with the provisions of Art. 9, sale to tenants who already owned or sold a house after 1 January 1990. Băsescu already bought a villa near Bucharest in October 2002, which he donated to his daughter shortly after. Furthermore, the same law only gave the right to buy the nationalized houses to those who were tenants at the time of it came into force (i.e. the second half of 1996), while Băsescu had only lived in that house since August 2002. According to the press, these facts made it impossible for Băsescu to legally buy the apartment. When the scandal broke again in early 2005, Băsescu first stated that he would give up the apartment, but later changed his mind announcing that he would give it up only if the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office decided he had broken the law. The prosecutors investigating the matter concluded that, according to the provisions of the law, Băsescu did not breach it when he bought the apartment.

=== Leader of Justice and Truth Alliance (D.A.) ===
In 2001, Băsescu was elected chairman of the Democratic Party (PD), defeating Petre Roman, who had previously led the party for nine years, after Roman only managed to get 3% of the vote at the 2000 presidential elections. At the time, the PD had a social-democrat ideology. That same year, Băsescu&#x27;s party and Iliescu&#x27;s PDSR both attempted to join the Socialist International. Băsescu tried to present his party as more democratically oriented, stating that the &quot;PDSR is far from modern social-democracy&quot;. He also negotiated a merger with Virgil Măgureanu&#x27;s PNR, a party that had many former Securitate employees.

In 2003, Băsescu negotiated an electoral alliance for the PD with the PNL in order to create a cohesive opposition against the then-ruling PSD. The new pact, called the Justice and Truth Alliance (), ran common candidates in local and national elections, and agreed to vote as a bloc in Parliament. As chairman of PD, he became a co-chairman of the Justice and Truth Alliance alongside the then PNL chairman Theodor Stolojan. In 2003, Stolojan, who was the Justice and Truth candidate for president of Romania in 2004, stepped down as PNL chairman and Justice and Truth co-chairman, and was replaced in these positions by Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu. Although it was announced that Stolojan had withdrawn because of health concerns, Băsescu claimed to the press that the reason behind this decision was blackmail by political opponents (Stolojan did not confirm this). This sudden change in leadership of the DA alliance transformed the 2004 presidential election to a race between two leaders of parties affiliated with the Socialist International. Editorialist Dan Pavel decried the development as a &quot;marginalization of the right,&quot; and the presidential race as a choice between two former &quot;FSN cadres&quot;. Nevertheless, there were significant differences in the economic programs of the DA alliance and the PSD in 2004. The DA alliance leaned towards economic liberalism, with the introduction of a 16% flat tax that replaced the progressive personal income tax of up to 40%, and the 25% corporate tax. In January 2005, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; described the DA alliance as &quot;centrist&quot;.

Băsescu&#x27;s party would not officially abandon social-democrat ideals until 2005, after PD&#x27;s leadership was unhappy with the support given by the Socialist International to the PDSR during the 2004 elections, and by the fact that the Socialist International admitted the PDSR&#x27;s successor, PSD, with full membership rights, while the PD remained only an associate member. In a 2006 interview, Băsescu stated that his party&#x27;s exit from the Socialist International was a &quot;huge concession&quot; he made to PNL after discussions of a merger of PD and PNL began in 2004. A change in the leadership of PNL prevented the merger; according to Băsescu, most of the PNL leaders who negotiated the joint governance with Băsescu in 2004 had been marginalized by 2006, making collaboration difficult. In December 2006, those members of the PNL who favored closer ties with Băsescu formed their own party, the Liberal Democratic Party (PLD), which eventually merged with the PD in January 2008. After December 2006, the remainder of the PNL became hostile to Băsescu and formed a minority government supported by the PSD, effectively marking the end of the DA alliance. (See Conflict with Prime Minister Tăriceanu below for further details.)

==Presidential campaign==

=== 2004 Presidential campaign ===
Following Theodor Stolojan&#x27;s surprise withdrawal from the 2004 presidential elections, Băsescu entered the presidential race on behalf of the Justice and Truth Alliance. His main opponent was then Prime Minister and PSD president Adrian Năstase. Like Băsescu, Năstase was a former Communist Party member. Although Năstase came out ahead in the first round by 7%, Băsescu achieved a surprise comeback, and won the 12 December run-off election by a 2.46% margin, receiving 51.23% of the vote. Băsescu won the presidential election by using anti-communist and anti-corruption rhetoric. In the live TV debate with Adrian Năstase before the 2004 run-off presidential election, Băsescu caught his opponent off-guard with a rhetorical remark: &quot;You know what Romania&#x27;s greatest curse is right now? It&#x27;s that Romanians have to choose between two former Communist Party members.&quot;

During the 2004 presidential campaign, before a TV interview with Adrian Năstase, Băsescu gave him a paper and told him: &quot;Put it in your pocket and read it when you are away!&quot; Similarly, in June 2006, at the oath-taking ceremony of Radu Stroe as the new secretary general of the Government, Băsescu gave him a sheet of paper as a &quot;gift&quot;. After seeing it, Stroe went pale and refused to make its contents public. When asked, Băsescu said its contents were not classified. Both Adrian Năstase and Radu Stroe were previously involved in corruption scandals.

=== 2009 Presidential campaign ===
Băsescu ran for a second term in the 2009 presidential elections. Incumbent Băsescu and his Social-Democrat opponent Mircea Geoană offered different ways to tackle the economic crisis. Băsescu pledged to cut public spending and promised &quot;more equity&quot; to people living in the countryside.

Băsescu tried to portray himself as the champion of the people against what he called the &quot;corrupt political elite&quot;. A widely used election poster carried the text: &quot;They cannot avoid what they are afraid of.&quot; Băsescu&#x27;s opponents countered that he is part of that elite, simply with different backers. In a Cluj-Napoca meeting with his supporters he claimed that he &quot;was the one to stop doubtful privatisations,&quot; implicitly accusing rival Social-Democrats of underhand practices while in power. He vowed to fight against the Parliament, which blocked his bid to install the Croitoru cabinet, and the &quot;media moguls&quot;. In the campaign for the first round, his favourite campaign theme was reducing the number of lawmakers. This theme proved popular, with the majority of the electorate voting for the reduction of the number of lawmakers from a current 471 to a maximum of 300, and in favour of a transition from the current bicameral Parliament to a unicameral one in a referendum held simultaneously with the first round of elections.

In the first round, held on 22 November, Băsescu came first with 32.44% of the votes, and Geoană second with 31.15%. Although Băsescu claimed the results of the first round as &quot;a significant vote for the right&quot; because he and Crin Antonescu together received over 50% of the vote, the next day Antonescu refused to back Băsescu in the runoff, and shortly thereafter announced an alliance with Geoană. Subsequently, Băsescu reproached Antonescu for having &quot;thrown himself in the arms of the Social-Democrat party, a party opposed to reforms,&quot; and added &quot;This alliance will bring us back to 20 years ago when the PSD was controlling all state institutions.&quot; Antonescu in turn called Băsescu &quot;a demagogue and a populist,&quot; and vowed to support Geoană as &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot;.

On 26 November 2009, footage from the 2004 election campaign showing Băsescu apparently hitting or pushing a 10-year-old boy at a campaign rally was broadcast. The press, unfavorable to Băsescu, interpreted the footage as &quot;hitting with his fist,&quot; whereas the press favorable to him either interpreted it as a push, or called the footage fake. Asked in a talk show about the incident, the president stated that he did not recall it, but did not outright deny it either, saying that perhaps the child uttered profanity. Later, he made a public declaration that &quot;never in his life has he hit a child,&quot; but he refused to comment on whether the footage was manipulated video or not. PDL member Roberta Anastase, who had accompanied Băsescu during the rally, declared the child uttered profanity, and that Băsescu pushed the child aside. The footage was released within 24 hours of a declaration by Dinu Patriciu, also present at the rally, who claimed that he saw Băsescu hitting a child in 2004. The boy has been identified, and was interviewed later that night. He acknowledged that Băsescu had hit him after he chanted a slogan favourable to Ion Iliescu and Adrian Năstase, but said he was not physically hurt. He also said that for the moment he was happy that Băsescu had paid attention to him, and they smiled at each other, but later he felt disappointed. He added &quot;it was a hit as if he wanted to say: go away!&quot; On 27 November Băsescu told a Mediafax journalist that he saw the footage &quot;de-mounted on computer,&quot; suggesting it was manipulated. Cecilia Gheorghe, the boy&#x27;s aunt, declared that the child now refuses to give further details because he is now &quot;afraid for his life and that of his mother&quot;.

In the second round of the presidential election Băsescu won against Geoana by 50.3% to 49.7%. The opposition&#x27;s legal objection to their narrow defeat was dismissed.

== Presidency (2004–2014) ==
Running on a strong reform and anti-corruption platform, Băsescu&#x27;s victory was characterized in the media as Romania&#x27;s &quot;Orange Revolution&quot;, in reference to the reformists&#x27; perceived victory in neighbouring Ukraine during the same period, and in reference to the orange colour used by the winning Justice and Truth Alliance (DA). Upon taking office, he suspended his PD membership; the Constitution does not allow the president to be a formal member of a political party during his tenure.

In line with an agreement between the PD and PNL, he appointed PNL leader Popescu-Tăriceanu as prime minister. In order to form a majority, PNL and PD formed a coalition with the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania and the Humanist Party, which later changed its name to the Conservative Party (PC). While the platform of the former has been generally in line with that of the Justice and Truth Alliance, the latter (PC) was needed in the coalition in order to obtain more than 50% of the seats in Parliament, because, apart from the opposition Social-Democrat Party, many seats were held by the ultra-nationalist Greater Romania Party (PRM).

In late 2006, the PC withdrew from the cabinet, a move at least partially related to conflicts between Băsescu and PC leader Dan Voiculescu. The withdrawal of the PC left the coalition without a majority in the Parliament.

===Domestic policy===
In domestic politics, Băsescu has often claimed he fights against high-level corruption. In spring 2005, Romania resolved a hostage crisis in Iraq involving three Romanian journalists and their guide.

In 2005, he also focused on pressing the government to provide relief to thousands of Romanians left homeless by widespread flooding throughout the spring and summer.
On 18 December 2006, Băsescu delivered a speech to Parliament (broadcast live on TV) in which he condemned Romania&#x27;s pre-1989 communist regime. Some members of the opposition, mainly of the ultra-nationalist PRM, and some members of the mainstream Social Democratic Party, tried to disturb the speech. Particularly vocal was the ultra-nationalist PRM leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor, who walked with posters on the floor of Parliament, whistled and interrupted Băsescu&#x27;s speech several times.

===Foreign policy===
Băsescu repeatedly stated that Romania&#x27;s accession to the European Union remained a top priority, and he was president when the country acceded on 1 January 2007. Both the president and the government of Prime Minister Popescu-Tăriceanu focused on Romania&#x27;s planned accession to the EU, which remained a central component in Romania&#x27;s foreign policy.

In addition, Băsescu has focused on a strong strategic partnership with the United States, a relationship which, during the 2004 presidential campaign, he called the &quot;Bucharest-London-Washington axis&quot;. In real terms, this meant a continued commitment to maintain Romanian troops in Afghanistan and a smaller contingent in Iraq, and an agreement signed in December 2005 between Romania and the U.S. to allow U.S. troops to use a Romanian military facility. Băsescu is singled out in a report by Dick Marty, an investigator of the Council of Europe, on illegal activities of the US CIA in Europe, as one of the persons who authorized, or at least knew about, and must stand accountable for the black site at the Mihail Kogălniceanu military base from 2003 to 2005. Băsescu made strong ties with the President of the United States, who in return called him a friend: &quot;The President and I are friends. Romania and the United States are friends, and we&#x27;re allies.&quot; 

In June 2006, Băsescu came into open conflict with Popescu-Tăriceanu after the prime minister and the defence minister announced that they and the PNL sought to withdraw Romania&#x27;s troops from Iraq. However, the troops remained in Iraq after Băsescu called a meeting of the Supreme Defense Council, which voted for the troops to stay.

In July 2006, Băsescu voiced concern over the 2006 Lebanon War. Băsescu said in a press conference that: &quot;We recognize Israel’s right to security but it has generated a humanitarian crisis&quot;.
 
Băsescu has been vocal in calling for a regional approach to security in the Black Sea basin, which he noted remained susceptible to trans-border security threats such as drug and human trafficking. Băsescu alleged &quot;that Russia might have been involved in his suspension,&quot; citing his pro-Western foreign policy as a reason.

Băsescu has tried to improve Romania&#x27;s relations with Moldova. Furthermore, he has expressed his belief several times in the future unification of the two countries, either politically or in the framework of the European Union. His attitude has brought some practical success, but also led to an increase in anti-Romanian rhetoric from the Communist government of Moldova, under Vladimir Voronin. A divisive issue that remains to this day is the opening of two Romanian consulates outside the capital of Moldova, as well as 900,000 Moldovans applying for Romanian citizenship. In both cases, Băsescu strongly supported moves to strengthen relations with Moldova, while the Moldovan Communist leadership sought to cool Băsescu&#x27;s enthusiasm.

In June 2016, Moldovan President Nicolae Timofti signed a decree granting Băsescu and his wife Maria citizenship. The following January, Timofti&#x27;s successor Igor Dodon signed a decree that withdrawed Băsescu&#x27;s citizenship.

Băsescu stated that Romania regards Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia, as an outcome of the Kosovo status process, and that Romania will not recognize any unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo.

Romania formally terminated its mission in Iraq on 4 June 2009, and pulled out its troops. On 23 July the last Romanian soldiers left Iraq. Three Romanian soldiers had been killed during the mission, and at least eight were wounded.

===Conflict with Prime Minister Tăriceanu===
Băsescu continued to be rather popular due to his open style and hands-on approach. In his electoral campaign, he promised to be a &quot;președinte jucător&quot; , &quot;player-president&quot;, in contrast to a more withdrawn president who would be just a mediator among political forces (thus creating in the eyes of some a juridical conflict of a constitutional nature). After he became president, as legally required, he resigned from the Democratic Party (PD). However, he remained very involved in day-to-day politics of Romania, often being accused by other political leaders of overstepping constitutional boundaries on the role of the president. During the course of his presidency, his relations with Popescu-Tăriceanu gradually soured, particularly following the Prime Minister&#x27;s reversal of course in July 2005 after Tăriceanu initially announced he would resign causing early parliamentary elections, which some hoped would have resulted in the Justice and Truth Alliance governing alone. The ensuing poor relations between the President and the Prime Minister have become one of the primary themes of Romanian post-2004 politics, with many unrelated disputes converging towards this dichotomy. Under the Romanian Constitution, the president appoints the prime minister, but does not have the authority to dismiss him.

On 11 January 2007, Băsescu presided over the first half of the meeting of the Consiliul Suprem al Magistraturii (CSM; Superior Council of the Magistracy) at which the election of its new president took place. Before the candidacies were announced, Băsescu publicly said to judge Anton Pandrea: &quot;I heard you have announced your candidacy, Mr. Pandrea. I wish you great success.&quot; His former counselor Renate Weber later claimed that if Băsescu had not said those words, Pandrea might not have been elected: &quot;If the President hadn’t said that, it would have been another candidacy, if not another President.&quot; When asked by the press, Băsescu responded to this criticism with: &quot;I made a mistake, I made a mistake.&quot;

A public scandal broke out when Elena Udrea, a presidential adviser, revealed to the press that then-Prime Minister Tăriceanu passed to Băsescu a &quot;scandalous&quot; written note. When the matter became public debate, Băsescu stated about the note: &quot;The Prime Minister proposed to me a partnership, one, unfortunately, with our oligarchies.&quot; The note, written by the hand of the Prime Minister, was attached on top of a report from the Petromidia company, then under investigation by Prosecutors, and asked the President to &quot;talk about it&quot; during a scheduled visit at the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office. Băsescu stated: &quot;Such type of partnership was unacceptable to me ... it would have meant that nothing had changed in Romania after the elections.&quot; On the subsequent reaction of the Prime Minister, Băsescu said: &quot;The Prime Minister was consequent. and absolutely not naïve.&quot; According to Băsescu, Tăriceanu phoned the Prosecutor General of Romania, then tried to put further pressure through a specially dedicated speech to the Parliament on 8 November 2006, and tried &quot;the same thing&quot; with Justice Minister Monica Macovei, arranging a meeting with a businessman at the Government Palace.

In response, the Prime Minister declared that the matter was just an attempt to hide &quot;what is going on at Cotroceni and around it,&quot; and publicly accused Băsescu of facilitating contracts to companies &quot;close to him&quot;. According to the Prime Minister, the newly appointed PD Transportation Minister told a businessman: &quot;The President sent me to take care of you.&quot; He also stated that Băsescu wanted to put the Department for Administration of State Heritage and Protocol under the control of the family of Elena Udrea. Băsescu immediately asked Tăriceanu to produce evidence to support his claims, to send it to the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, and to remove the ministers allegedly involved. &quot;If the Prime Minister does not produce such proof, the President considers that these statements are without substance and are of such a nature as to distract the public attention from his own deed,&quot; a presidential communiqué stated.

Dinu Patriciu, an influential businessman and PNL member, stated on a public TV station that, in his opinion, Tăriceanu&#x27;s note was a &quot;friendly gesture, a sign of normality&quot;. Patriciu also said that in a discussion with Băsescu in October 2005, he was advised to invest in any country in the Black Sea basin except Russia. According to Patriciu, Băsescu said &quot; ... because we must do so that Russians invest in Romania, in order to have them hostages, because we certainly will have a conflict with Russia&quot;.

Furthermore, Dan Voiculescu, a member of the opposition, accused the president of influence peddling, producing a note by Băsescu to a minister, which, as Voiculescu claimed, was a request to support selling cheap energy to the ALRO company, in which PDL leader Theodor Stolojan was a stockholder. The note said: &quot;Minister Seres, I ask you to analyze this letter and take measures according to Government’s interests and, if possible, with the interest of national economy in mind.&quot;

The daily newspaper &quot;Adevărul&quot; published another note, in which the President requested the PD Transport Minister to analyze and find a &quot;legal solution&quot; to a petition from a company close to Băsescu. The newspaper claimed that this was outside the legal prerogatives of the president, and accused Băsescu of sending the note directly to the Minister instead of following the usual administrative procedures, and furthermore noted that the matter was a commercial dispute that neither the President nor the Transport Minister had the legal means to solve.

In the spring of 2007, when Foreign Minister Mihai-Răzvan Ungureanu resigned, Băsescu refused to accept Prime-Minister Tăriceanu&#x27;s nomination of Adrian Cioroianu as the country&#x27;s new Minister of Foreign Affairs, claiming that Cioroianu did not have enough experience. On 5 April 2007, the Constitutional Court decided that &quot;The Romanian President doesn&#x27;t have veto power, but, if he observes that the proposed person does not correspond to the legal conditions required to be a member of Government, he can ask the Prime Minister to renounce his proposal.&quot; On the same day (two months after Ungureanu announced his resignation and 17 days after Ungureanu&#x27;s resignation was accepted by the President), Băsescu accepted Cioroianu and the latter assumed office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

===Impeachment vote by the Parliament===
In early 2007, Băsescu was proposed for impeachment by the members of the opposition parties for alleged unconstitutional conduct. Allegedly, one of the major issues in the confrontation was the activity of Justice Minister Monica Macovei, who supported prosecutor&#x27;s efforts to follow up on cases of corruption, especially those involving politically connected individuals. Among the main reasons given in the proposal to suspend Băsescu were:
* infringing upon and &quot;substituting the authority&quot; of the Government, the judicial system and the Parliament.
* committing acts of &quot;political partisanship&quot; with direct reference to the Democratic Party, abuse of power and acting more like a &quot;judge of the other public authorities&quot; than a &quot;collaborator&quot;, thus &quot;abandoning his role of impartial mediator required by the Romanian Constitution&quot;.
* manipulating and &quot;instigating public opinion against other state institutions&quot; such as the Parliament and the Government.

Băsescu and his supporters denied the accusations, stating that his actions and statements were ways of fighting against corruption in the political and judicial systems, and against &quot;circles of business interests&quot; with unlawful purposes.

The Constitutional Court of Romania found no clear evidence of his breach of the Constitution in the sense required by the fundamental law. However, the court ruling was only consultative, and the two chambers of the Romanian Parliament voted in favor of Băsescu&#x27;s impeachment on 19 April 2007, with 322 votes for the impeachment proposal, 108 against, and 8 abstentions (the minimum number of votes needed was 233). Băsescu contested the decision, but the Constitutional Court rejected his appeal as inadmissible, and upheld the vote.

In the meantime, the independent Macovei and the PD ministers had been dismissed by Prime Minister Popescu-Tăriceanu, while the European election had been postponed to the fall of 2007. Pro-Băsescu politicians have characterized the anti-Băsescu coalition that formed as &quot;the black alliance,&quot; as it contained a broad spectrum of political parties and interests: Social-Democrats favoring heavy state involvement in the economy, National-Liberals and Conservatives favoring business interests, Hungarian minority MPs, and anti-Hungarian ultra-nationalists.

In 2007, when Traian Băsescu was temporarily suspended from the Presidency, he said in a meeting: &quot;It seems [former] President Ion Iliescu turned to more modern means [of removing political opponents], this time without calling the miners to &#x27;defend the country&#x27;, but used 322 Members of Parliament for my impeachment.&quot;

===2007 Impeachment referendum===

As a result of the impeachment vote by the Parliament, Băsescu was suspended from his function as president on 19 April 2007, and a national referendum was held on 19 May 2007 to decide by popular vote whether to dismiss him. According to the electoral law (article 5(2) of the Referendum Law), an absolute majority of all Romanians with the right to vote is required for a positive result in a dismissal referendum, which means that almost 9 million people would have had to vote against Băsescu. After the impeachment vote, several public rallies to support Băsescu in the referendum, and protest against his suspension, were organized by PD and PLD both in Romania (Bucharest, Iaşi, etc.), as well as abroad (e.g. in Madrid).

On 17 April Băsescu stated that if Parliament voted for his impeachment, he would resign &quot;five minutes&quot; after the vote, avoiding a referendum for dismissal and triggering early presidential elections. However, on 20 April he decided not to resign, claiming he wished to limit the period of political instability.

Băsescu and his supporters in the Democratic Party also suggested that his political opponents would try to modify the electoral law in order to prohibit a previously suspended president from running in the elections again, following a Rolandas Paksas scenario.

On 25 April the Constitutional Court approved the modifications brought by parliament to the Referendum Law. The new article 10 (regarding the presidential impeachment process) considers that the impeachment process &quot;will be approved through the majority of votes for the participants at the referendum, and article 5(2) does not apply to this type of referendum&quot;. Therefore, the 19 May referendum remained valid, despite the participation of less than 40% of eligible Romanians. However, since only a 25% minority of voters voted in the affirmative, and a 75% majority in the negative, Băsescu regained full prerogatives on 24 May after the referendum results were confirmed.

===PDL-PSD coalition government===
In December 2008, in the aftermath of legislative elections which gave PDL and PSD similar scores, the two joined forces to form a coalition, under a PDL Prime Minister. After one of its ministers was expelled from the government by the prime minister against the will of the party, the PSD decided to leave the government in early October. Soon afterwards, the government fell following the adoption of a motion of no confidence in Parliament. Băsescu nominated Lucian Croitoru as the new prime minister, against the will of the parliamentary majority, which supported Klaus Iohannis. After Croitoru was voted down, Băsescu nominated PDL member Liviu Negoiță as prime minister, again ignoring the proposal of the parliamentary majority. A caretaker government remained in office. The ongoing political crisis prevented Romania from getting two instalments of a 20-billion-euro loan from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union.

=== 2012 Impeachment referendum ===

Băsescu was suspended by the Parliament a second time on 6 July 2012, with a referendum on his impeachment being held on 29 July 2012. After initially calling on the population to vote, PDL called for a boycott, accusing the majority party USL of attempted fraud. Băsescu, however, declared that he would still vote, albeit not voting after all. An overwhelming 88.7% of people who went to vote rejected his leadership. However, the turnout at the referendum was estimated at 46%, which was less than the 50% + 1 required for it to be validated.

The Romanian Constitutional Court subsequently invalidated the referendum by a vote of 6–3, which reinstated Băsescu as president of Romania. In June 2015 The Attorney General of Romania started investigating illegalities committed by certain members of the Constitutional Court in order to save the embattled president. The US envoy Philip Gordon visited Romania supporting Băsescu, accused the president opposition of massive fraud, angering the 8.4 million voters, per Romania TV. Of the thousands of people investigated of election fraud only one received the guilty verdict in Court, a saving face verdict for the errors committed by the US envoy, as per DC News. Băsescu said that now is the time to leave old conflicts aside in order to solve Romania&#x27;s problems, and to &quot;restore a functioning democratic Romania, and restore our credibility.&quot; On the other hand, Crin Antonescu, who has served as acting president during this entire process, claims Băsescu is an &quot;illegitimate&quot; leader as he was suspended by Parliament and dismissed by the people.

Following his return to Cotroceni, Băsescu maintained a low profile until the regular parliamentary elections. On 9 December 2012, the elections produced a new parliamentary configuration, with an overwhelming USL majority dominating the other parties by a 70% margin. The &quot;presidential party&quot;, PDL, only attained 16% of the total votes, failing to win all but one electoral circumscription while former presidential adviser Eugen Tomac won the second external circumscription, including the Republic of Moldova. The landslide victory of the former opposition coalition marginalized Băsescu and drastically reduced his possibilities to negotiate a new PDL-based coalition, thus being left with no other viable alternative than to nominate PSD president Victor Ponta to form the new government.

Băsescu and Ponta signed a framework treaty, intended to smoothen the future institutional collaboration between the Presidency and the Government. But soon afterwards, first tensions started to creep in, as Ponta depicted the EU-Budget negotiations outcome for Romania as a political defeat for Băsescu.

== Post-presidency (2014–present) ==
On 9 October 2015, Băsescu joined the People&#x27;s Movement Party (PMP). PMP&#x27;s fourth congress was held on 24 October, with Băsescu being elected president of the party.

In the light of the local elections of 2016, Băsescu expressed his intentions to run for a new term as mayor of Bucharest. However, following an accusation of money laundering, Băsescu retired and PMP subsequently nominated journalist Robert Turcescu as their official candidate.

In the 2016 legislative elections, Băsescu won a seat as senator of Bucharest on PMP&#x27;s list, as the party placed sixth in the elections, with 5.35% of the vote. He resigned from PMP leadership in 2018, and was elected honorary president of the party at the congress in June 2018.

===Involvement in Moldovan politics===
Along with the granting of Moldovan citizenship in June 2016 which was subsequently withdrawn on 25 June 2017, Băsescu was elected honorary president of the National Unity Party (PUN). Anatol Șalaru, the party founder, stated that the party leader&#x27;s seat will remain vacant until Băsescu gets back his Moldovan citizenship.

===2020 local elections===

Băsescu ran for a new term as mayor of Bucharest at the 2020 local elections. Partial results have confirmed that he has secured third place with approximately 11% of the total cast votes.

==Relationship with the press==
Băsescu is a major target of criticism by the press, and in turn he used controversial language to describe some of the journalists who have been critical of him.

In October 2006, he referred to journalist Ovidiu Zara, of the &quot;Curentul&quot; newspaper, using the Romanian word &quot;&quot; (roughly &quot;faggot&quot;). In 2009, the president&#x27;s brother, Mircea Băsescu, also used the word &quot;găozar&quot; to refer to the &quot;Gândul&quot; newspaper journalist Robert Veress. In protest leading Romanian journalist Cristian Tudor Popescu, the editor in chief &quot;Gândul&quot;, appeared on his TV show &quot;Cap și Pajură&quot; holding a sign saying &quot;gazetar găozar&quot; (roughly &quot;faggot journalist&quot;).

On 19 May 2007, the day of the suspension referendum, Băsescu took the mobile phone of Antena 1 journalist Andreea Pană, who was filming him while he was shopping with his wife, despite being asked to leave him alone. Forgetting to turn it off, he was recorded referring to Pană as a &quot;stinking gypsy&quot; during a conversation with his wife in his car. The recording was made public by the Antena 1 TV station after the phone was returned to Pană the next day. After public outcry, Băsescu&#x27;s spokesman expressed regret over the fact that &quot;an inappropriate expression in a private discussion became public&quot;. The president of the Commission for Human Rights, Cults and Minorities in the Chamber of Deputies, Nicolae Păun, who is himself part of the Roma community, stated that President Băsescu is not a racist, and cannot be condemned for a statement made in private. Romani CRISS, on the other hand, issued a letter of protest, saying &quot;Romani Criss consider unacceptable for the Romanian President to use such language, sexist and racist alike.&quot; Other criticism came from the International Federation of Journalists, &quot;Agenţia de Monitorizare a Presei&quot;, and &quot;Clubul Român de Presă&quot;. Romania&#x27;s National Council for Combating Discrimination decided that the expression &quot;stinking gypsy&quot; was discriminatory and sanctioned Traian Băsescu with a warning.
In 2008, Băsescu referred to journalist Victor Ciutacu, the editor in chief of &quot;Jurnalul Național&quot;, which was highly critical of him, as &quot;jukebox on euros&quot; (Romanian: &quot;tonomat cu euro&quot;), a meme that Ciutacu later used repeatedly on his TV show &quot;Vorbe grele&quot;, even in the show&#x27;s logo.
During the 2009 presidential election, Băsescu released two video clips starring himself and actors who were parodying his Antena 3 critics: Mircea Badea, a TV host, well known for his critical stance on Băsescu, as well as Mihai Gâdea, the host, and Valentin Stan, a frequent guest on the TV political talk show &quot;Sinteza Zilei&quot;.
Băsescu had a good relationship with journalists who praised him, in particular TV host Radu Moraru, of the B1 TV show &quot;Nașul&quot;, who described Băsescu as &quot;the greatest president of Romania in the last 20 years&quot; in the opening of an interview with him.

==Criticism and controversies==

===Corruption scandals===
In the summer of 2009, Băsescu was criticized in an editorial in the &quot;Gândul&quot; newspaper for remaining silent for a long time regarding the corruption scandal surrounding Monica Iacob Ridzi, the PD-L Youth Minister, in contrast to the harsh criticism he had expressed against ministers from other parties when they were accused of corruption (Tudor Chiuariu, Codruț Șereș). Similarly, Tom Gallagher, a Romania specialist at Bradford University, wrote that Băsescu&#x27;s public image suffered after his daughter, Elena Băsescu, became an MEP through &quot;purely byzantine maneuvers&quot; with the help of Ridzi, and after Băsescu &quot;appeared to express solidarity&quot; with Ridzi against the media that was reporting on the scandal. At Monica Ridzi&#x27;s trial it was said that the beneficiary of the illegal financial activities was Traian Băsescu&#x27;s daughter. In 2015 Mircea Băsescu, the ex-president&#x27;s brother was accused and jailed for receiving money with the promise to save an imprisoned criminal. Other family members, his son-in-law and a nephew, have been accused of selling justice and producing false documents. There was evidence presented at Antena 3, Romania TV and Realitatea TV that Mircea Băsescu said that his brother knew of the illegal dealings.

On 20 April 2016 the General Prosecutor&#x27;s Office announced that they decided to prosecute Traian Băsescu for money laundering in a criminal case concerning the sale of land in Bucharest&#x27;s northern neighbourhood of Băneasa to the businessman Costel Cășuneanu. This prompted Băsescu to drop his bid for Bucharest&#x27;s mayoral office in the upcoming local elections.

=== Controversy with Azerbaijan ===
According to Civic Solidarity platform&#x27;s report “European values bought and sold” Traian Băsescu is one of the most prominent lobbyists for the Azerbaijani regime in Romania. For years he has been a valuable asset for the Azerbaijani ruling party in their efforts to buying influence in the country. During his Precedency the ties between the countries became unprecedently close. It is reported to be connected to Romania&#x27;s interest in the Azerbaijani gas, which was agreed to be transported to Romania according to the AGRI deal. The International consortium of investigative journalists, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) has discovered criminal connections behind the real estate where the Heydar Aliyev foundation was located in Bucharest. The foundation, named after the father of the current President Aliyev was inaugurated in 2007, during the presidency of Traian Băsescu. In Bucharest, President Băsescu personally opened a memorial park for Heydar Aliyev. The current President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev was twice decorated by the Romanian Presidents. Despite his close ties with Azerbaijani government, Traian Băsescu became one of co-authors of the controversial statement on Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, issued by European Parliament on 10 June 2020.

===Comments regarding King Michael===
In June 2011, during a televised talk-show, president Băsescu made a disputed remark about former King Michael of Romania saying that &quot;he was a slave to the Russians&quot; and calling his 1947 abdication &quot;an act of treason&quot;. The president noted that King Michael was the official head of state at the time of the events in question—both during the alliance with Nazi Germany, and during the Soviet occupation. This triggered a wave of criticism, and some letters demanding he resign, from the opposition parties and their sympathizers, who expressed their disapproval of such an interpretation of Romanian history, and the perceived lack of respect towards the former king. On 23 July, he told the public he &quot;deeply regrets&quot; his comments about King Michael, calling it a sensitive issue.

President Băsescu added that if he had been in Marshal Antonescu&#x27;s place, he too would have ordered the Romanian troops to cross the Prut River and attack the USSR, with the purpose of regaining Bessarabia, lost in 1940. In response to this, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a press statement asking for the immediate response of &quot;civilized Europe to this justification of Nazi aggression against USSR and dishonor to the memory of millions lost during World War II,&quot; and called Băsescu&#x27;s declarations &quot;shameless bravado&quot;.

===Collaboration with the Securitate===

In June 2019, the National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) published documents provided by the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) and General Directorate for Defense Intelligence (DGIA), by which Traian Băsescu had been recruited by the Securitate as informant in 1972, under the code name &quot;Petrov&quot;, and started to provide reports on his colleagues since his freshman year. According to the law 187/1999, the status of Securitate collaborator has to be confirmed by a Court of Appeal.

On 5 September 2019, in the first hearing before the Court of Appeal, Băsescu admitted writing the memos published by CNSAS, using the name &quot;Petrov&quot; at the request of Colonel Tudor from the military counterintelligence. However he denied having been an official collaborator of the Securitate (with a signed agreement), mentioning that he also filed other reports to his employer (the former Romanian shipping company &quot;Navrom&quot;) under his real name.

On 20 September 2019 the Court of Appeal Bucharest ruled that Traian Băsescu officially collaborated with the Securitate. Băsescu stated he would appeal against the ruling. The appeal at the High Court of Cassation and Justice will start on 5 November 2021.

On 23 March 2022 the High Court of Cassation and Justice rejected Băsescu&#x27;s appeal, thus confirming the Court of Appeal&#x27;s ruling that 
he officially collaborated with the Securitate. Băsescu announced that he would take legal action with the European Court of Human Rights.

=== Comments regarding Romani people ===
Băsescu has been noted for his controversial remarks about Romani people, who are a small and disadvantaged community in Romania. During a television interview in 2010, he stated that Roma &quot;avoid work and make a living by stealing&quot;, which led to a fine by the official anti-discrimination agency. He advocates using the exonym &quot;gypsie&quot;, which is considered a racial slur by most Roma. In 2007, he insulted a journalist who was filming him as a &quot;stinking gypsy&quot;.

<text>Michelle Michiko Sagara (born May 5, 1963) is a Canadian author of fantasy literature, active since the early 1990s. She has published as Michelle Sagara, as Michelle West (using her husband&#x27;s surname) and as Michelle Sagara West. Sagara has received two nominations for the John W. Campbell Award.

She lives in Toronto and is employed part-time at Bakka-Phoenix, a local bookstore.

== Biography ==
Sagara is the eldest child of Japanese immigrants. As a child, Sagara loved reading Nancy Drew mysteries as well as the works of Enid Blyton and J. R. R. Tolkien. She studied physics, then English, at the University of Toronto before dropping out to pursue writing. After she married in 1990, she began publishing under Michelle West. Her debut book, &quot;Into the Dark Lands&quot; was published in 1991. She has said, in a 2008 interview: &quot;I submitted the first novel to Del Rey books in 1987. It was rejected, but with a phone call, and in the end I revised the manuscript and sent it back. The revision was passed on to Lester del Rey, who was alive at the time. He rejected it with a four-page single space letter [that] had all the trademark curmudgeonliness for which he was famed. But buried in that four-page letter was a very definite &#x27;This flashback of 94 pages needs to be its own damn book, and it should be book one.&#x27; So... I wrote that novel, and I submitted that novel, and that&#x27;s the novel they bought.&quot;

=== Novels ===
====Books of the Sundered====
(as Michelle Sagara, Ballantine Books/Michelle Sagara West, BenBella Books)

Originally published as a Michelle Sagara work, &quot;Books of the Sundered&quot; is a Tolkienesque tale of love, betrayal, and redemption. Previously out of print, the series was reissued by BenBella Books under the name Michelle Sagara West.

#&quot;Into the Dark Lands&quot;, 1991
#&quot;Children of the Blood&quot;, 1992

====The Sacred Hunt====
(as Michelle West, DAW Books)

The Kingdom of Breodanir is facing a threat unlike any seen for centuries. An orphan boy and his adopted brother struggle against the ties that bind them together (and to their land) as they complete an impossible journey to save the world—at the risk of their own destruction. These are the first books set in the Essalieyan universe to be published.

#&quot;Hunter&#x27;s Oath&quot; (October 1995)
#&quot;Hunter&#x27;s Death&quot; (June 1996)

====The Sun Sword====
(as Michelle West, DAW Books)

Sixteen years after the events of &quot;The Sacred Hunt&quot;, the Empire of Essalieyan and the Dominion of Annagar are at war due to machinations of the Kialli. The resulting struggle for power will define the lives of those who would bring an end to the Kialli threat. Events laid out in &quot;The Sacred Hunt&quot; are referenced, but are not necessary to follow the story.

&quot;The House War&quot; series intersects &quot;The Sun Sword&quot; series in the Essalieyan universe. Michelle Sagara published a synopsis of &quot;The Sun Sword&quot; series to give necessary background to readers of &quot;The House War&quot;.

(as Michelle West, DAW Books)

Set in the Essalieyan universe, &quot;The House War&quot; chronicles the story of Jewel and her rise in House Terafin. The first three novels return to the origin of Jewel and the discovery of her den. They also revisit some of the narrative from &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Death&quot;, though told from different (and complementary) character perspectives.

<text>The General Electric GAU-13/A is a 30 mm electric Gatling-type rotary cannon derived from the GAU-8 Avenger cannon.

==Description==
The GAU-13 was developed in the late 1970s for use in gun pod applications for fighter aircraft and attack aircraft use, primarily for air-to-ground and anti-tank attacks.

The GAU-13/A is a four-barreled rotary cannon based on the mechanism of the larger GAU-8, sharing the same massive 30 mm ammunition. Like the Avenger, it has a double-ended feed system with reverse clearing to remove unfired rounds. Unlike the GAU-8, however, it is pneumatically driven, giving it a rate of fire of 2,400 rounds per minute. Minimum time between stoppages is estimated at 32,000 rounds, making it a very reliable weapon.

The GAU-13/A uses the same range of &quot;PGU-13&quot; High Explosive Incendiary (HEI) and &quot;PGU-14&quot; Armor-Piercing Incendiary (API) rounds (which contain a depleted uranium penetrator) as the Avenger. Despite its somewhat lower rate of fire compared to the seven-barreled Avenger, it is an immensely powerful weapon.

The principal application for the GAU-13/A was the GPU-5/A gun pod (originally marketed as the &quot;GEPOD 30&quot;). The pod is long and can be mounted on any standard NATO suspension lugs. It holds 353 rounds of ammunition, enough for approximately nine seconds of continuous fire. The GPU-5/A weight is empty and fully loaded. The pod is completely self-contained.

The GPU-5/A was intended for carriage on a wide range of U.S. tactical aircraft, including the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. In the mid-1980s the USAF considered a specialized variant of the F-16 for the close air support (CAS) mission, using the GPU-5, as a substitute to or adjunct for the A-10 Thunderbolt II.

The GPU-5 pod, however, proved unsatisfactory in service. It was briefly tried on some Air National Guard F-16 Fighting Falcons during the 1991 Gulf War, but was removed from service after barely a day of combat use because of its very poor accuracy. Despite the cannon&#x27;s impressive ballistic characteristics, the pylon mounting was not sufficiently rigid to prevent deflection, and the weapon&#x27;s heavy recoil exacerbated the problem by causing pylon misalignment. Further, the GPU-5 was not integrated into the F-16&#x27;s sighting system. The GPU-5 is no longer in U.S. service, although some Thai F-5E Tiger II aircraft still carry the weapon; it was also tested on the F-20 Tigershark.

In mid/late 1995, the U.S. Marine Corps conducted a trial of the GPU-5 on the LCAC-66, as a potential weapon to provide suppressive fire for landing forces. The pod was mounted on a standard MAU-12 bomb rack, itself mounted in a standard cargo container. It was believed that four such containers could then be carried on the LCAC. The resulting combination was referenced as the Gun Platform Air Cushion (GPAC). By 1997, the Marines had reportedly acquired the USAF&#x27;s entire stock of GAU-13/A cannons and GPU-5 pods as surplus. Besides the GPAC, the GAU-13/A was also touted as possible armament on ships and ground vehicles such as the LAV-25.

<text>Howard Henry Baker Sr. (January 12, 1902 – January 7, 1964) was an American lawyer and politician who was elected to seven consecutive terms as a United States Representative from Tennessee from 1951 to 1964.

He was the father of future U.S. Senate majority leader and White House chief of staff Howard Baker, Jr.

== Biography ==
Baker was born in Somerset, Kentucky, in 1902 to James F. Baker, an attorney and newspaper publisher in Huntsville, Tennessee, and Kentucky native Helen Keen Baker. The family moved to Huntsville, Tennessee, in 1909, and Baker spent most of his childhood in Scott County. The family moved to Knoxville in 1918, the same year that Baker entered the university there. He graduated from the University of Tennessee in 1922 and its law school in 1924; he was admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1923. Baker is an alumnus of the Epsilon Eta chapter of Sigma Nu Fraternity. After law school, Baker married Dora Ladd and returned to Huntsville to become a partner in his father&#x27;s practice. Their son, Howard Baker Jr., was born in Huntsville in 1925. Dora died when Howard Jr. was a child. On September 15, 1935, he married Edith Irene Bailey.

== Career ==
For a period, Baker served as publisher of a weekly newspaper in Huntsville, Tennessee, the county seat of Scott County. In 1928, he was elected to a term in the Tennessee House of Representatives, and served on the Scott County Board of Education from 1931 to 1932. In 1934, he became district attorney general of the former 19th Judicial Circuit, serving until 1938 in that capacity.

In 1938, Baker made an unsuccessful bid for governor of Tennessee, losing in the general election to Democrat Prentice Cooper. In 1940, he ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate, losing to Democrat Kenneth McKellar. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1940, 1948, 1952, and 1956. He was vice president and general counsel to the former Oneida and Western Railroad in 1945, and was also on the board of directors of the First National Bank of Oneida.

Baker was elected to the 82nd and to the six succeeding Congresses and served from January 3, 1951, until his death from a heart attack in Knoxville, Tennessee on January 7, 1964. He was succeeded in office by his widow Irene, who completed his final term as a caretaker and sought no further election.

Baker was one of the few Southern Congressmen not to sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1960 and the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but did not vote on the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

== Death ==
Baker died, following a heart attack, at Fort Sanders Presbyterian Hospital, Knoxville, Knox County, Tennessee, January 7, 1964, five days before his 62nd birthday. He is interred at Sherwood Memorial Gardens, Alcoa, Tennessee. Tennessee State Route 63 is named Congressman Howard H. Baker Highway in his honor.

Baker is probably best remembered as the father of Howard H. Baker Jr., a three-term U.S. senator from Tennessee and United States Senate Majority Leader who later served as White House Chief of Staff under Ronald Reagan and was the former United States Ambassador to Japan.

<text>Goa Su-Raj Party is a political party in the Indian state of Goa. In the state elections 2002 GSRP launched eight candidates, who together mustered 1500 votes. As of 2006, the party has representation in the Goa legislative assembly as of 2016. The party is known to be active in taking a number of stands on issues affecting the state. It is also active through making its voice heard in cyberspace, and is known to campaign for votes on the grounds that as a &quot;regional&quot; (as contrasted to the national-level parties that dominate Goa&#x27;s politics, such as the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party) it would be better able to serve the needs of the electorate. It has not been successful in getting its candidates elected though, till August 2006.

Party leaders have explained its name, &quot;Su-Raj&quot;, to mean &quot;good governance&quot;. It has taken stands against corruption in the region. Its leaders include the Moira-based radio officer-turned-politician Floriano Lobo, Dr Dumo and others.

In early 2012, GSRP formed its youth wing with Jocelyn Pereira appointed as its youth president. Jocelyn Pereira, an active social worker from the island of Divar has been at the fore of many youth activities in the state and actively campaigns for youth of Goa.

On 31 December 2016, former Goa Vikas Party MLA Francisco Xavier Pacheco joined the GSRP.

<text>Capital Airlines was a United States trunk carrier, a scheduled airline serving the eastern, southern, southeastern, and midwestern United States. Capital&#x27;s headquarters were located at Washington National Airport (now Reagan Washington National Airport) across the Potomac river from Washington, D.C., where crew training and aircraft overhauls were also accomplished. In the 1950s Capital was the fifth largest United States domestic carrier by passenger count (and sometimes by passenger-miles) after the Big Four air carriers (American, United, TWA, and Eastern).

Capital merged with United Airlines in 1961.

==History==

===Clifford Ball Airline===
Clifford A. Ball, a McKeesport, Pennsylvania, automobile dealer and owner of a controlling interest in Bettis Field near Pittsburgh, won airmail contract route No. 11 on March 27, 1926. In April of the following year, The Clifford Ball Airline began operating between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Cleveland, Ohio. Clifford Ball Airlines operated from Pittsburgh&#x27;s first commercial airport, Bettis Field, a former farm field which farmer Barr Peat had allowed to be used for barnstorming. The airplane which flew the first flight from Pittsburgh to Cleveland, a Waco 9 named &quot;Miss Pittsburgh&quot;, is currently displayed at the Pittsburgh International Airport. Famed humorist and performer Will Rogers was known to be an early and regular passenger, but scheduled passenger service did not begin until April 28, 1928. The following August, Ball Airline became the first airline to serve Washington, D.C., from the west, offering its flagship &quot;Path of the Eagle&quot; service from Cleveland to Hoover Field across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. A &quot;Path of the Eagle&quot; brochure and schedule are displayed at the Pitcairn Field Web site.

===Pennsylvania Air Lines===
Ball sold his interests in November 1930 to Pittsburgh Aviation Industries Corp., and the airline became Pennsylvania Air Lines (PAL). PAL was reorganized as Pennsylvania Airlines after the Air Mail scandal of the early 1930s. In 1934 Pennsylvania Airlines acquired Kohler Aviation.

===Central Airlines===

Central Airlines was founded in 1934 by the men who had formed Pittsburgh Airlines in 1929. Central was notable for hiring Helen Richey, the first female commercial pilot in the U.S. Central Airlines became PAL&#x27;s main competitor and they engaged in ruinous rate wars with prices well below those charged for railroad seats.

The two companies merged to form Pennsylvania Central Airlines, or PCA, on November 1, 1936.

===Pennsylvania Central Airlines===

The merged airlines flew Stinson A and Boeing 247 aircraft. Early in its existence, PCA faced a minor crisis in January 1937 when the Bureau of Air Commerce temporarily grounded the airline&#x27;s Boeing 247s. The six B-247s were all sold off in 1937. The airline&#x27;s 15 B-247Ds were all gone by the end of 1942. Two remain in museums today—one at the National Aviation Museum at Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and another, the &quot;City of Renton&quot;, in flying condition at the Museum of Flight, Boeing Field, Seattle, Washington.

PCA, based at the new Allegheny County Airport near Pittsburgh, continued to add routes, notably to Chicago in 1938, and aircraft, notably the Douglas DC-3, in 1940. In 1941 PCA moved its headquarters to the new Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, becoming one of its three original tenants; PCA had been consulted during the airport&#x27;s design. The row of office buildings next to its hangars became &quot;mahogany row&quot; and the airline adopted the slogan &quot;The Capital Airline&quot;, with its aircraft dubbed &quot;Capitaliners&quot;. In September 1943 Pennsylvania Central requested the CAB authorize new routes affecting 23 states indicating plans for a major expansion after the war. PCA even had big trans-Atlantic ambitions. PCA did see expansion as the war wound down. The company signed contracts with Douglas Aircraft for DC-4s, on September 28, 1944, worth $10 million.

In 1946 PCA began flying the Douglas DC-4 but found the airplane was unprofitable on some of its low volume short segment routes. One of PCA&#x27;s DC-4s had been used to transport President Roosevelt to the Casablanca Conference during World War II Ten DC-4s still served Capital at the time of the UAL merger. All were immediately disposed of by United.

By 1946, the combination of expansion and post-war inflation were financially pressing United States airlines. PCA was facing stronger competition on the essential New York to Chicago route. By the end of the first quarter of 1947 Pennsylvania-Central was in such a bad situation that the company president had to seek S.E.C. approval for a refinancing agreement with PCA&#x27;s bankers.

The crisis led PCA to the election of J.H. &quot;Slim&quot; Charmichael as president, and drastic cuts from 4,800 employees to 3,000. By October 1, 1947, PCA had 25 DC-3s (two cargo only) and three DC-4s. &quot;We had a sick airline on our hands, and we had to get it out of bed, but quickly. We figured our best chance lay in leading not just following the others&quot;, Charmichael told the New York Times. The cuts were followed by the acquisition of used, but newer, equipment and the situation was saved.

By 1947 PCA&#x27;s route network no longer reflected its name. On April 21, 1948, the airline adopted a new insignia, colors and the name Capital Airlines.

===Capital Airlines===
In 1948 Capital introduced the &quot;Nighthawk&quot;, one of the first coach class services, to compete with the railroads between Chicago and New York City, as well as the dominant airlines on the route, United, TWA and American. Each flight left at 1 AM and stopped for ten minutes at Pittsburgh (Allegheny County). Chicago-NY fare was $29.60 plus 15% federal tax; seats on all other flights cost $44.10 plus tax.

Also in 1948 the first airborne television was installed on a Capital airplane.

In 1950 Capital Airlines received its first Lockheed Constellations. In 1955 Capital became the first U.S. operator of the British manufactured, four engine Vickers Viscount, the first passenger turboprop airliner. The Viscount propjets were deployed on the flagship Washington-Chicago route and the airline had planned to fly them on expanded service; however, Capital was mostly stymied by the federal Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The CAB also refused Capital a requested subsidy. Still, Capital&#x27;s passenger-miles in 1957 were 88% more than 1955.

On November 14, 1956, a Capital pilot reported seeing a blue-white ball in the sky. The pilot, Captain William J. Hull, was a senior captain who was hired by Pennsylvania-Central in April 1941. He was the captain of Capital Flight 67 which crashed turning final to Tri-City Airport, Freeland, Michigan on April 6, 1958. At the time he had a total flight time of 16,050 hours, of which 1,702 were in the Viscount.

In 1958, Capital was operating shuttle service with its Viscount propjets between New York and Chicago, New York and Detroit, and Chicago and Washington D.C. The cover of its April 27, 1958, system timetable proclaimed: &quot;Now! Viscounts every sixty minutes all day long! Chicago-New York, New York-Detroit, Chicago-Washington&quot;. The next year, the airline introduced high frequency Viscount service between Chicago and Minneapolis–St. Paul with this message appearing on the cover of its August 3, 1959, system timetable: &quot;First Jet-Powered Service Between Minneapolis–St. Paul and Chicago - 7 Jet-Prop Viscounts Each Direction Daily&quot;.

The airline encountered labor difficulties when the International Association of Machinists went on strike in fall 1958. The strike crippled operations for 38 days. On April 1, 1960, the New York State Commission Against Discrimination faulted Capital Airlines for failing to hire Patricia Banks, an African-American woman who had been denied employment as a flight attendant despite meeting all job requirements. She became one of only two Black flight attendants in the country.

By 1961 Capital had begun operating its first and only jet aircraft type: new Boeing 720 jetliners leased from United Airlines. The cover of the airline&#x27;s June 1, 1961, timetable proclaimed: &quot;New Boeing 720 Jets New York - Atlanta - New Orleans: 2 Round Trips Daily&quot;. This same timetable stated that Capital was operating &quot;596 daily flights&quot; and was also flying: &quot;The Only Jets to Miami from Pittsburgh and Cleveland&quot;. However, this was not the airline&#x27;s first attempt to operate jets as Capital had previously placed orders for the De Havilland Comet 4 and 4C jet aircraft models. The airline then canceled these orders after taking into consideration its declining financial standing.

===Acquisition by and merger with United===
In the late 1950s, Capital began to struggle financially. In May 1960, Vickers foreclosed on Capital&#x27;s entire fleet of Viscounts, and bankruptcy for the airline seemed certain. However, on July 28, 1960, a merger with Chicago-based rival United Airlines was announced. The federal Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) had to approve airline mergers. United wanted Capital Airlines&#x27; CAB-awarded routes to Florida. At the time of its acquisition by United, Capital was flying nonstop between Miami and Buffalo, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh; nonstop between Tampa and Atlanta, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh; and nonstop between Jacksonville and Atlanta. When completed on June 1, 1961, the merger of the second and fifth-largest airlines in the U.S. was the largest airline merger in history at that time. Despite a year of planning, all did not go smoothly on merger day. United continued to operate forty-one of Capital&#x27;s Viscount propjets as well as three of Capital&#x27;s Douglas DC-3s. United soon purchased six Viscounts which Capital had returned to Vickers. United operated three ex-PCA/Capital DC-3s for one year after the merger. United had retired its last DC-3s in the 1950s. Because of the need to operate CAB route award AM-34, it suddenly became the last major United States airline to operate the DC-3.

===The New Capital Airlines===
In 1981, former employees formed the Capital Airlines Association to preserve their memories of the old carrier. A retired United Airlines pilot, Milt Marshall, bought the Capital trademark and operated a charter business under the Capital name out of Waterbury-Oxford Airport in Connecticut.

In a bizarre final chapter to the brand&#x27;s story, in July 2004 Capt. Marshall was transporting a passenger in a Capital Airways Piper PA-31 Navajo from Waterbury to upstate New York. The plane crashed as it made an approach in clear weather near Lake George. Both pilot and passenger were killed. Their bodies were mangled and burned in the wreckage. A pistol magazine with two missing rounds was found at the crash scene, but no gun was ever found. Many people believe that the passenger, a businessman who was facing both bankruptcy and indictment for fraud, and who had attempted to buy a large life insurance policy just prior to the flight, killed the pilot and himself, causing the crash. The bodies were so mutilated that no official cause of death was determined and the case was closed. This marked the last chapter of Capital Airlines.

==Destinations: 1937–1960==

In 1937, PCA&#x27;s main route was from Milwaukee to Washington, D.C., with stops in Muskegon, Grand Rapids, Lansing, Detroit, Cleveland, Akron, and Pittsburgh. Spurs ran from Detroit to Pontiac and Flint, and from Pittsburgh to Parkersburg and Charleston.

By 1941, new spurs were added from Grand Rapids to Chicago, Sault Ste. Marie and Traverse City; from Pittsburgh to Erie and Buffalo; and from Charleston to Tri-Cities, Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Birmingham. New routes ran north from Washington to Baltimore, Harrisburg and Williamsport, and south to Norfolk, then across North Carolina serving Rocky Mount, Raleigh, Greensboro, Hickory, and Asheville. Pittsburgh-New York City service was added by 1946.

By 1950 the network extended south to Atlanta, Mobile, and New Orleans, and west to Minneapolis. Memphis and Huntsville were added by 1953, along with interchange service on National Airlines to Florida.

By 1960, the year before its merger with United, Capital served Florida with its own aircraft on flights to Jacksonville, Miami, St. Petersburg, Tampa, and West Palm Beach.

Capital operated Lockheed Constellations until 1960. It also ordered Bristol Britannia turboprops in 1956, de Havilland Comet jets in 1956, Convair 880 jets in 1958, and Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprops in 1959. However, none of these aircraft were delivered to or operated by the airline.

==Accidents and incidents==
;November 16, 1935: A Central Airlines Stinson Model A (NO-15107), forced to land after taking off from Allegheny County Airport when all three engines failed at an altitude of about 50 feet. The pilot made a wheels up landing straight ahead on an unfinished portion of the runway. There were no injuries but the airplane suffered major damage. The cause was fuel contamination.

;August 31, 1940: PCA Trip 19, a Douglas DC-3-313 (NC21789), departed Washington, D.C., into an intense thunderstorm. Probable cause was the disabling of the pilots by a severe lightning discharge close to the plane, which caused a sudden dive from , killing all 25 aboard. The crash was the worst American airline accident to that date.

;April 16, 1941: Pennsylvania Central Airlines Trip 143, a Boeing 247D (NC13359), en route from Charleston, West Virginia (Wertz Field), to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, crashed into the hills near St. Albans, West Virginia, after the right engine failed just after takeoff. One member of the crew and two passengers suffered serious injuries. One member of the crew and the other four passengers suffered minor injuries. There were no fatalities.

;October 2, 1941: Pennsylvania Central Airlines Trip 142, a Douglas DC-3 (NC25691), was involved in an accident at the Municipal Airport, Morgantown, West Virginia. After touchdown the Captain allowed the airplane to roll for approximately 1,500 feet and was within 700 feet of the runway end before applying the brakes. At that time the Captain found that the brakes were not working, or had no braking action. Then the captain unlocked the tail wheel and attempted a groundloop. The groundloop did not salvage the situation and the airplane slid sideways over a 25-foot embankment. The landing gear was sheared off and the airplane came to rest on its belly. Subsequent testing showed no problems with the brakes. The probable cause &quot;was the failure of the captain to apply the brakes in time to permit a successful take-off when they were found to be ineffective&quot;.

;March 2, 16, 1942: Pennsylvania Central Airlines Trip 17, a Douglas DC-3 (NC21788), was involved in an accident while landing at Detroit City Airport, Detroit, Michigan. The airplane, approaching fast and high, landed long on a snow-covered runway and bounced repeatedly. The Captain attempted to turn so as not to hit the boundary fence. The airplane went through the fence causing major damage to the airplane. There were no injuries.

;April 14, 1945: Pennsylvania Central Airlines Flight 142, a Douglas DC-3-313A (NC25692), crashed against the west slope of Cheat Mountain near Morgantown, West Virginia, due to pilot error, killing all 20 on board.

;January 6, 1946: Pennsylvania Central Airlines Flight 105, a Douglas DC-3 (NC21786), originating in New York City with stops in Pittsburgh and Knoxville crashed while on an instrument approach to Runway 18 at Birmingham Municipal Airport in Birmingham, Alabama. The pilot, first officer, and a check airman who occupied the cockpit jump seat perished; several passengers were injured, none fatally.

;September 12, 1946: A Pennsylvania Central Airlines Douglas DC-4 (NX91068), landed safely at Washington, D.C., following an engine fire. The crew received minor injuries and the aircraft suffered major damage.

;May 8, 1947: A Capital Airlines Douglas DC-3 (NC11917), on a ferry flight from Norfolk, Virginia, to Washington, D.C., suffered a failure of the left engine. The propeller could not be feathered and there was severe vibration. Leaking oil and sparks were coming from the engine. The crew elected to make a forced landing, wheels up and flaps down. Major damage resulted.

;June 13, 1947: Pennsylvania Central Airlines Flight 410, a Douglas C-54 Skymaster (NC88842), crashed into Lookout Rock, West Virginia, about eight miles southeast of Charles Town, West Virginia, while en route from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Washington, D.C., killing all 50 on board.

;April 27, 1949: Capital Airlines Trip 40, a Douglas DC-3 (NC25689), made a forced landing near Frankfort Springs, Pennsylvania. There was only minor damage to the airplane and there were no injuries

;August 7, 1949: Capital Airlines Flight 19, a Douglas DC-3 (NC25689), collided with a Cessna 140 near General Mitchell Field, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Cessna was destroyed and the occupants killed. The DC-3 lost six feet off the right wing, and a portion of the right aileron. No one aboard the airliner were injured and the airplane landed at the airport. The probable cause of the accident was the failure of the pilots in the DC-3 to observe and avoid the Cessna aircraft.

;December 12, 1949: Capital Airlines Flight 500 a Douglas DC-3-313A (NC45379), stalled and crashed in the Potomac River off Washington, D.C., killing six of 23 on board.

;February 20, 1956: Capital Airlines Flight 141, a Vickers Viscount 744 (N7404, Fin #327), was badly damaged at Chicago Midway International Airport after a hard landing due to a malfunction of the propeller control switches; all 42 on board survived. Despite this, the aircraft was remanufactured as c/n 301 and entered service with Trans-Canada Air Lines in May 1957.

;June 22, 1957: A Capital Airlines Douglas C-47 (N88835), which was on a training flight, crashed near Clarksburg, Maryland. The aircraft was destroyed and the crew were all killed. The probable cause was loss of airspeed while executing maneuvers, resulting in a stall followed by a spin.

;April 6, 1958: Capital Airlines Flight 67, a Vickers Viscount 745D (N7437, Fin #356), lost control and crashed on approach to Saginaw, Michigan, resulting in 47 fatalities. The crash was attributed to ice on the horizontal stabilizer.

;May 20, 1958: Capital Airlines Flight 300, a Vickers Viscount 745D (N7410, Fin #329), collided with Air National Guard Lockheed T-33 &quot;53-5966&quot;, killing all eleven on board when the Viscount crashed at Brunswick, Maryland, as was one of the two crew members of the T-33.

;June 4, 1958: Capital Airlines Flight 3, a Douglas C-53B (N49553, Fin #233), crashed at Martinsburg Airport, Martinsburg, West Virginia. A trainee stalled the aircraft on takeoff, the instructor failed to monitor the situation and airplane crashed off the end of the runway.

;May 12, 1959: Capital Airlines Flight 983, a Lockheed L-049E Constellation (N2735A), was intentionally ground looped by the pilot, after a landing on a short, wet runway at Charleston, West Virginia. It caught fire as it skidded and slid down a steep embankment, killing two of 44 on board.

;May 12, 1959: Capital Airlines Flight 75, a Vickers Viscount 745D (N7463), broke up in mid-air after encountering thunderstorms. The aircraft crashed at Chase, Maryland, killing all 31 people on board.

;August 26, 1959: A Capital Airlines Douglas DC-3 (N44993), crashed on landing at Charleston, West Virginia. The pilot lost control and the airplane swerved off the runway and plunged down an embankment. The probable cause of the accident was loss of control following a poorly executed landing.

;January 18, 1960: Capital Airlines Flight 20, a Vickers Viscount 745D (N7462, Fin #380), crashed at Holdcroft, Virginia, after losing power from at first two, then all four engines (although one engine was restarted). All 50 people on board were killed.

<text>Sir John Audley Frederick Aspinall (25 August 1851 – 19 January 1937) was an English mechanical engineer who served as Locomotive Superintendent of the Great Southern and Western Railway (GS&amp;WR) of Ireland and Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) of England. He introduced vacuum brakes to his locomotives in Ireland, a trend which was followed in Britain, and designed several locomotives. He was also president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and of the Institution of Civil Engineers.

==Biography==
Aspinall was born on 25 August 1851 in Liverpool to a Roman Catholic judge. He attended the Roman Catholic boarding school of Beaumont College, Berkshire before being apprenticed to engineers John Ramsbottom and Francis Webb of the London and North Western Railway in 1868. He was sent by Webb to the United States of America in 1872 where he was greatly impressed by the larger loading gauge in use there.

In 1875, he moved to the Great Southern and Western Railway of Ireland and became their works manager at Inchicore, Dublin. Aspinall was promoted to Locomotive Superintendent in 1883 and introduced a form of vacuum braking to his locomotives which was soon adopted by several other lines, including the London and North Western and Great Northern Railways. He was succeeded at Inchicore by Henry Ivatt and was to keep links with both Inchicore and Ivatt.

He became the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1886. Continuing the work of his predecessor, William Barton Wright, he modernised the locomotive stock and continued Barton Wright&#x27;s philosophy of standardisation, bringing in several of his own design. He was promoted to L&amp;YR general manager in 1899, a position he was to hold until 1919. In this capacity he introduced electrification and greatly expanded the transport of coal. 

Aspinall served as president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers between 1909 and 1910 and was interned in Germany at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Aspinall received a knighthood on 13 June 1917 for his contributions to the war effort and national transport system. He served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers between November 1918 and November 1919. Aspinall also conducted the inquiry into the Sevenoaks railway accident. He was the first recipient of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers&#x27; James Watt International Medal, receiving it in 1937. 

He died on 19 January 1937. His son, John, was a barrister and first-class cricketer.

He wrote seven academic papers and was the holder of fourteen patents.

<doc id="1093004" wikidata="Q7350852" url="?curid=1093004" title="Robert Warburton">
<text>Colonel Sir Robert Warburton (11 July 1842 – 22 April 1899) was a British soldier and administrator. Half-Afghan and proficient in both Farsi and Pashto, he served for many years as British political officer in charge of the Khyber Pass, a region of strategic importance to British India. He helped maintain peace with the Afridis, who rose in revolt eighteen years after his retirement.

==Early life and education==
Robert Warburton was born in a Ghilzai fort between Jagdallak and Mak on 11 July 1842, the only son of Lt. Col. Robert Warburton (1812–1863), of the Royal Artillery, by Shah Jahan Begum, niece of the Amir Dost Mohammed of Afghanistan through a marriage of forced abduction at gunpoint during the British occupation of Kabul. His father was a younger son of Richard Warburton, of Garryhinch, Queen&#x27;s County, Ireland. The latter&#x27;s father, John Warburton, MP for Queen&#x27;s County, had served under General Wolfe at Quebec in 1759.

At the time of Robert&#x27;s birth his mother was fleeing from the troopers of Sardar Muhammad Akbar Khan, who pursued her for months after the massacre of English at Kabul on 1 November 1841. She was sheltered by her relatives and finally rejoined her husband on 20 September 1842.

At the close of the Afghan war, Robert and his mother accompanied his father&#x27;s battery to Sipri, whence they removed to Morar in Gwalior. In 1850, Robert was placed at school at Mussoorie under Robert North Maddock, where he remained until 1 December 1856. He was then sent to England, and educated at Kensington Grammar School under G. Frost. Thence he obtained a cadetship, and after one term at the Royal India Military College, Addiscombe, and two at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, he obtained his commission in the Royal Regiment of Artillery on 18 December 1861.

==Career==
In 1862, Warburton was sent to India and stationed with the 1st battery of the 24th brigade at Fort Govindghar, the fortress of Amritsar. In August 1864, he transferred to F battery of the 18th brigade and was stationed at Mian Mir.

In 1866, the failure of the Agra and Masterman&#x27;s Bank left him with only his pay to support himself and his mother. To increase his resources he transferred to the 21st Punjab Infantry. This regiment was then under orders for the Abyssinian campaign, and disembarked at Zoula on 1 February 1868. While serving with the transport train Warburton showed great tact in conciliating native feeling, and received the thanks of Sir Robert Napier for his services. When he was invalided to England, Napier interested himself in his behalf, and wrote to the lieutenant-governor of the Punjab recommending him for employment on the frontier. 

On his return to India in April 1869, Warburton was attached as a probationer to the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs, and in July 1870 was appointed to the Punjab commission as an assistant commissioner to the Peshawar division. At the end of September 1872, he was removed temporarily to the sub-district of Yusafzai and stationed at Hoti-mardan, and in February 1876 he was permanently appointed. Under Sir Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari, he took part in several enterprises against the hill tribes who persisted in raiding British territory, particularly against the Utman Khel in 1878, and was five times complimented by the government of the Punjab and thrice by the secretary of state for India. In 1879, during the Afghan campaign, Cavagnari made repeated applications for his services, but the Punjab government refused to spare him. In July, however, he was appointed political officer of the Khyber, a post that he held for eighteen years.

On the news of the murder of Cavagnari at the Siege of the British Residency in Kabul, Warburton was nominated chief political officer with General Sir Robert Onesiphorus Bright, commanding the Jalalabad field force. He joined the force on 10 October, and proceeded to Jalalabad to ascertain the revenues of the district. In April 1880, he was invalided to England, and he did not return to the Khyber Pass until 16 February 1882. From that time he remained on the frontier almost continuously until his retirement.

He held a remarkable influence over the hill tribes, perhaps in part owing to his Afghan blood. He raised the Khyber Rifles from among these tribes, a force which for many years kept the pass tranquil. His camp became the rendezvous of mutually hostile tribesmen, who refrained from hostilities so long as they remained within its precincts. He was accustomed to travel with no weapon but a walking-stick, and everywhere met with demonstrations of attachment. Able to converse fluently with the learned in Persian and with the common folk in the vernacular Pashto, he succeeded, by his acquaintance with tribal life and character, in gaining an exceptional influence over the border Afghans. In 1881, he attained the rank of major, and in 1887 that of lieutenant-colonel.

On 1 January 1890, in recognition of his services, he was created C.S.I. In 1893, he was nominated to the brevet rank of colonel. He resigned his post on 11 July 1897, and received the thanks of the Punjab government. He had frequently requested government to give him an English assistant who might continue his policy and succeed to his influence after his retirement. This request was never granted, and the advent of a successor without local experience was at once followed by disquiet. On the outbreak of unrest among the Afridis in August, he was asked by the Indian government on 13 August whether he was willing to resume his service in connection with the Khyber Pass and the Afridis. He declared himself willing, but on 23 August, before definite orders had been given, hostilities broke out. He served with the Tirah expedition, and in 1898 he was created Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire. The hardships of the Tirah campaign exhausted him, and the loss of the Khyber port broke his heart.

==Death==
Warburton returned to England with broken health, and died at 3 Russell Road, Kensington, on 22 April 1899. He was buried at Brompton Cemetery on 27 April.

==Personal life==
In 1868, Warburton married Mary, eldest daughter of William Cecil of Dyftrin, Monmouthshire. After her husband&#x27;s death she edited his memoir &quot;Eighteen Years in the Khyber&quot;, published in 1900.

*Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE), 1898

<doc id="1093010" wikidata="Q3126414" url="?curid=1093010" title="Lottery scam">
<text>A lottery scam is a type of advance-fee fraud which begins with an unexpected email notification, phone call, or mailing (sometimes including a large check) explaining that &quot;You have won!&quot; a large sum of money in a lottery. The recipient of the message—the target of the scam—is usually told to keep the notice secret, &quot;due to a mix-up in some of the names and numbers,&quot; and to contact a &quot;claims agent.&quot; After contacting the agent, the target of the scam will be asked to pay &quot;processing fees&quot; or &quot;transfer charges&quot; so that the winnings can be distributed, but will never receive any lottery payment. Many email lottery scams use the &quot;names&quot; of legitimate lottery organizations or other legitimate corporations/companies, but this does not mean the legitimate organizations are in any way involved with the scams.

==Identification==
There are several ways of identifying a fake lottery email:
* Unless someone has bought a ticket, one cannot have won a prize. There are no such things as &quot;email&quot; draws or any other lottery where &quot;no tickets were sold&quot;. This is simply another invention by the scammer to make the victims believe that they have won.
* The scammer will ask the victims to pay a fee in advance to receive their prize. All genuine lotteries simply subtract any fees and tax from the prize. Regardless of what the scammer claims this fee is for (such as courier charges, bank charges, or various imaginary certificates), these are all fabricated by the scammer to obtain money from victims.
* Scam lottery emails will often come from free email accounts such as Outlook, Yahoo!, Hotmail, Live, MSN, Gmail etc.
* Scam emails will often insist that the recipient keep their win confidential; this is done to avoid others advising them that the email is a scam.
* There may be inconsistencies between currencies and countries, such as for example the message being sent to an individual who lives in the &quot;UK&quot; and claiming the amount won to be in &quot;US&quot; dollars and the lottery itself to be based in &quot;South Africa&quot;.
* As with many scam email messages in general, lottery scam messages may contain spelling and/or grammatical issues.

Most email lottery scams are a type of advance fee fraud.

==Mis-selling by lottery &quot;win&quot;==
Another type of lottery scam is a scam email or web page where the recipient had won a sum of money in the lottery. The recipient is instructed to contact an agent very quickly but the scammers are just using a third party company, person, email or names to hide their true identity, in some cases offering extra prizes (such as a &quot;7 Day/6 Night Bahamas Cruise Vacation,&quot; if the user rings within 4 minutes). After contacting the &quot;agent&quot;, the recipient will be asked to come to an office, where during one hour or more, the conditions of receiving the offer are revealed. For example, the prize recipient is encouraged to spend as much as 30 times the prize money in order to receive the prize itself. In other words, although the offer is in fact genuine, it is really only a discount of a few percent on an extremely expensive purchase. This type of scam is legal in many jurisdictions.

Sometimes lottery scam messages are sent by ordinary postal mail; their content and style is similar to the e-mail versions. For example, some scams by letter misuse the names of the legal Spanish lotteries, such as El Gordo de la Primitiva.

In the UK a number of legitimate lottery sites have dedicated pages on the subject of scams.

==Blackmail variation==
This variation relies on the target agreeing to accept a sum of money that they know that they are not entitled to and then, when they refuse to pay the advance fee, the scammers then threaten to report them unless blackmail is paid.

A typical scenario is when the emails are sent to staff of a multinational corporation with offices/branches throughout the world using their work email address. The fraudsters will represent themselves as the agents of a scheme that the multinational has won. An example being the &quot;winners&quot; of a prize as a result of placing an advertisement with the supposed promoter of the scheme in an obscure (and sometimes fictional) trade magazine published in an equally obscure country. The scammers will allege that they have written to the corporation&#x27;s headquarters and made every attempt to pass on the &quot;prize&quot; but without success, but as they (the scammers) don&#x27;t want to lose face with the promoters they are anxious to discharge their responsibilities to pass on the prize money, they will ask for the target&#x27;s personal banking details to allow the &quot;prize&quot; to be sent and trust the target to pass it on to their employers. This immediately makes the target vulnerable to a phishing attack but, more significantly, to blackmail attempts. When they refuse to pay any advance fee the fraudsters threaten to report the matter to their employers and/or the police.

<doc id="1093011" wikidata="Q882985" url="?curid=1093011" title="Garba (dance)">
<text>Garba is a form of Gujarati dance which originates from the state of Gujarat, India. The name is derived from the Sanskrit term &quot;Garbha&quot; . Many traditional garbas are performed around a centrally lit lamp or a picture or statue of the Hindu goddess Durga. Traditionally, it is performed during the nine-day Hindu festival Navaratri). Either the lamp (the &quot;Garba Deep&quot;) or an image of the Goddess, Durga (also called &quot;Amba&quot;) is placed in the middle of concentric rings as an object of veneration.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;garba&quot; comes from the Sanskrit word for womb and so implies gestation or pregnancy — life. Traditionally, the dance is performed around a clay lantern with a light inside, called a &quot;Garbha Deep&quot; (&quot;womb lamp&quot;). This lantern represents life, and the fetus in the womb in particular. The dancers thus honor Durga, the feminine form of divinity.

Garba is performed in a circle as a symbol of the Hindu view of time. The rings of dancers revolve in cycles, as time in Hindu is cyclical. As the cycle of time revolve, from birth, to life, to death and again to rebirth, the only thing that is constant is the Goddess, that one unmoving symbol in the midst of all of this unending and infinite movement. The dance symbolizes that God, represented in feminine form in this case, is the only thing that remains unchanging in a constantly changing universe (&quot;jagat&quot;).

The &quot;Garbha Deep&quot; has another symbolic interpretation. The vessel itself is a symbol of the body, within whom Divinity (in the form of the Goddess) resides. Garba is danced around this symbol to honour the fact that all humans have the Divine energy of Devi within them.

==Dance==

Modern Garba is also heavily influenced by &quot;Dandiya Raas&quot; (Gujarātī: ડાંડીયા રાસ), a dance traditionally performed by men. The merger of these two dances has formed the high-energy dance that is seen today.

Both men and women usually wear colorful clothes while performing garba and dandiya. The girls and the women wear Chaniya choli, a three-piece dress with a choli, which is an embroidered and colorful blouse, teamed with chaniya, which is the flared, skirt-like bottom, with intricate work and dupatta, which is usually worn in the traditional Gujarati manner. Chaniya Cholis are decorated with beads, shells, mirrors, stars, embroidery work, mati, etc. Traditionally, women adorn themselves with jhumkas (large earrings), necklaces, bindi, bajubandh, chudas and kangans, kamarbandh, payal, and mojiris. Boys and men wear kafni pyjamas with a &quot;Ghagra&quot; - a short round kurta - above the knees and pagadi on the head with bandhini dupatta, kada, and mojiris. In Gujarati, these clothes worn by men is called &quot;&#x27;Kediyu&#x27;.&quot; Over the years, the interest in Garba has only increased. There is a huge interest in Garba among the youth of India and in particular, the Gujarati diaspora. Traditionally, this dance is performed in concentric circles and the entire group performs once step in sync, with the beat starting slow and slowly catching on speed.

Garba and Dandiya Raas are also popular in the United States where more than 20 universities have Raas/Garba competitions on a huge scale every year with professional choreography. The Canadian city of Toronto now hosts North America&#x27;s largest annual garba by number of attendees. Garba is also very popular in the United Kingdom where there are a number of Gujarati communities who hold their own Garba nights and widely popular among the Gujarati community worldwide.
==Tradition==
Garba is a Gujarati folk dance celebrated in Navratri, a celebration lasting nine nights. Garba songs typically revolve around the subjects of the nine goddesses. Garba styles vary from place to place in Gujarat.

The traditional clothing of the Garba dancer is red, pink, yellow, orange, and brightly colored chanya, choli or ghagra choli; dupatta with bandhani (tie-dye), abhla (big mirrors) or with thick Gujarati borders. They also wear heavy jewellery, such as 2–3 necklaces, sparkling bangles, waist belts, and long oxidized earrings. Traditionally men wear an ethnic &quot;kedia&quot; and a pajama or a dhoti with an oxidized bracelet and necklace. Normally, the dandiya sticks are Wooden.

==Recognitions==
In December 2023, UNESCO recognised &quot;Garba&quot; with the Intangible cultural heritage tag.

<doc id="1093014" wikidata="Q2639699" url="?curid=1093014" title="Dargah">
<text>A dargah ( &quot;dargâh&quot; or &quot;dargah&quot;, Turkish: &quot;dergâh&quot;, Hindustani: &quot;dargāh&quot; दरगाह درگاہ, &quot;dôrgah&quot;) is a shrine or tomb built over the grave of a revered religious figure, often a Sufi saint or dervish. Sufis often visit the shrine for &quot;ziyarat&quot;, a term associated with religious visitation and pilgrimages. Dargahs are often associated with Sufi eating and meeting rooms and hostels, called &quot;khanqah&quot; or hospices. They usually include a mosque, meeting rooms, Islamic religious schools (madrassas), residences for a teacher or caretaker, hospitals, and other buildings for community purposes.

The same structure, carrying the same social meanings and sites of the same kinds of ritual practices, is called &quot;maqam&quot; in the Arabic-speaking world.

Dargah today is considered to be a place where saints prayed and mediated (their spiritual residence). The shrine is modern day building which encompasses of actual dargah as well but not always.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Dargah&quot; is derived from a Persian word which literally means &quot;portal&quot; or &quot;threshold.&quot; The Persian word is a composite of &quot;&quot;dar&quot; (در)&quot; meaning &quot;door, gate&quot; and &quot;&quot;gah&quot; (گاه)&quot; meaning &quot;place&quot;. It may have a connection or connotation with the Arabic word &quot;&quot;darajah&quot; (دَرَجَة)&quot; meaning &quot;stature, prestige, dignity, order, place&quot; or may also mean &quot;status, position, rank, echelon, class&quot;. Some Sufi and other Muslims believe that dargahs are portals by which they can invoke the deceased saint&#x27;s intercession and blessing (as per &quot;tawassul&quot;, also known as &quot;dawat-e qaboor&quot;Persian: &quot;da‘wat-i qabũr&quot;دعوتِ قبور, &quot;invocations of the graves or tombs&quot;] or &quot;‘ilm-e dawat&quot; Persian: &quot;‘ilm-i da‘wat&quot; عِلمِ دعوت, &quot;knowledge of invocations&quot;]). Still others hold a less important view of dargahs, and simply visit as a means of paying their respects to deceased pious individuals or to pray at the sites for perceived spiritual benefits.

However, dargah is originally a core concept in Islamic Sufism and holds great importance for the followers of Sufi saints. Many Muslims believe their wishes are fulfilled after they offer prayer or service at a dargah of the saint they follow. Devotees tie threads of &quot;mannat&quot; (Persian: منّت, &quot;grace, favour, praise&quot;) at dargahs and contribute to langar and pray at dargahs.

Over time, musical offerings of dervishes and sheikhs in the presence of the devout at these shrines, usually impromptu or on the occasion of Urs, gave rise to musical genres like Qawwali and Kafi, wherein Sufi poetry is accompanied by music and sung as an offering to a &quot;murshid&quot;, a type of Sufi spiritual instructor. Today they have become a popular form of music and entertainment throughout South Asia, with exponents like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Abida Parveen taking their music to various parts of the world.

== Throughout the non-Arab Muslim world ==
Sufi shrines are found in many Muslim communities throughout the world and are called by many names. The term &quot;dargah&quot; is common in the Persian-influenced Islamic world, notably in Iran, Turkey and South Asia.

In South Africa, the term is used to describe shrines in the Durban area where there is a strong Indian presence, while the term &quot;keramat&quot; is more commonly used in Cape Town, where there is a strong Cape Malay culture.

In South Asia, dargahs are often the site of festivals (&quot;milad&quot;) held in honor of the deceased saint on the anniversary of his death (&quot;urs&quot;). The shrine is illuminated with candles or strings of electric lights at this time. Dargahs in South Asia, have historically been a place for all faiths since the medieval times; for example, the Ajmer Sharif Dargah was a meeting place for Hindus and Muslims to pay respect and even to the revered Saint Mu&#x27;in al-Din Chishti.

In China, the term &quot;gongbei&quot; is usually used for shrine complexes centered around a Sufi saint&#x27;s tomb.

==Worldwide==
There are many active dargahs open to the public worldwide where aspirants may go for a retreat. The following is a list of dargahs open to the public.

==Opposition by other Sunni groups==
The Ahl-i Hadith, Deobandi, Salafi and Wahhabi religious scholars argue against the practice of constructing shrines over graves, and consider it as associating partners with God, which it is unanimously considered to be from the authentic scholars, which is called &quot;shirk&quot;. They believe Islamic prophet Muhammad strongly condemned the practice of turning graves into places of worship and even cursed those who did so. although visiting graves is encouraged for the sake of visiting not to worship in the manner that many Sufi if not the majority go to do ziyarat and make dua with the intercessions of saints which is not rooted within Islam to remember death and the Day of Judgment.

== Sufi defence on permissibility of Dargah ==
Sufis, refute such claims on the basis of misquotation of hadith. The hadith &quot;Let there be curse of Allah upon the Jews and the Christians for they have taken the graves of their apostles as places of worship.(Sahih Muslim)&quot;&quot;, is directed towards the disbelievers not the Muslims who took graves as place of worship i.e. they prayed facing towards the graves, this is not the practice of Sufis as they do not take graves as their &quot;Qibla&quot; (direction). As for constructing structure over grave, it is refuted on the basis that the grave of Prophet Muhammad and the first two Khalifa, Abu Bakr and Umar, itself have a structure over it.

To construct a building, shelter or edifice around the graves of the &quot;Auliya Allah&quot; (Friends of Allah) and &quot;Scholars&quot; of Islam or nearby is proven to be permissible from the Quran and practice and rulings of the &quot;Sahaba&quot;.

Narrating the incident of the People of the Cave [Ashaab-e-Kahf), the Holy Quran states, “The person who was dominant in this matter said, “We shall build a Masjid over the People of the Cave.”– [Surah Kahf. Verse 21] 

Imam Fakhr al-Din al-Razi explains the above Quran verse in his famous &quot;Tafsir al Kabeer&quot;, &quot;And when Allah said &#x27;Those who prevailed over their affair&#x27; this refers to the Muslim ruler or the friends of Ashaab al Kahf (i.e. believers) or the leaders of town. &#x27;We will surely build a Mosque over them&#x27; so that we can worship Allah in it and preserve the relics of companions of the cave due to this mosque&quot; [Tafsir al-Kabeer, 5/475].

Imam Abu al-Walid al-Baji, quotes in his book &quot;Al-Muntaqa Sharh al-Muwatta&quot; (commentary of Muwatta Imam Malik), &quot;Hadrat Umar built a dome over the grave of Hadrat Zainab bint Jahsh, and Sayyidah Aisha on the grave of her brother Hadrat Abdur-Rahman and Hadrat Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya on the grave of Hadrat Ibn Abbas. So Whoever has classified building domes to be disliked (Makrooh) has said so if they are built in order to show off.&quot; (Imam Badr al-Din al-Ayni, also writes the same in his book &quot;Umdat al-Qari -&quot; commentary of &quot;Sahih Bukhari&quot;)

<doc id="1093015" wikidata="Q1126347" url="?curid=1093015" title="Connie Hawkins">
<text>Cornelius Lance &quot;Connie&quot; Hawkins (July 17, 1942 – October 6, 2017) was an American professional basketball player. A New York City playground legend, &quot;the Hawk&quot;
was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992.

==Early years==
Hawkins was born on July 17, 1942, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. He was one of six children, whose father left the family when he was 10; supported by a mother who worked as a cook while suffering from glaucoma. He attended Boys High School, and played for coach Mickey Fisher. Hawkins soon became a fixture at Rucker Park, a legendary outdoor court where he battled against some of the best players in the world, such as Wilt Chamberlain.

Hawkins did not play much until his junior year at Boys High. Hawkins was All-City first team as a junior as Boys went undefeated and won New York&#x27;s Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) title in 1959. During his senior year he averaged 25.5 points per game, including one game in which he scored 60, and Boys again went undefeated and won the 1960 PSAL title. In 1960, he was named a &quot;Parade&quot; magazine high school All American. Hawkins then signed a scholarship offer to play at the University of Iowa.

In 2003, the 1959 and 1960 Boys High basketball teams were inducted into the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame.

==College and investigation into point-shaving==
During Hawkins&#x27; freshman year at Iowa, he was a victim of the hysteria surrounding a point-shaving scandal that had started in New York City. Hawkins&#x27; name surfaced in an interview conducted with an individual who was involved in the scandal. While some of the conspirators and characters involved were known to or knew Hawkins, none – including the New York attorney at the center of the scandal, Jack Molinas – had ever sought to involve Hawkins in the conspiracy. Hawkins had borrowed $200 ($ in current dollar terms) from Molinas for school expenses, which his brother Fred repaid before the scandal broke in 1961. The scandal became known as the 1961 college basketball gambling scandal.

Despite the fact that Hawkins could not have been involved in point-shaving (as a freshman, due to NCAA rules of the time, he was ineligible to participate in varsity-level athletics), he was kept from seeking legal counsel while being questioned by New York City detectives who were investigating the scandal.

===Expulsion from Iowa===
As a result of the investigation, during which Hawkins maintained that he had no involvement in the scheme, and despite never being arrested or indicted, Hawkins was expelled from Iowa. He was effectively blackballed from the college ranks as no NCAA or NAIA school would offer him a scholarship. NBA commissioner J. Walter Kennedy let it be known that he would not approve any contract for Hawkins to play in the league. At the time, the NBA had a policy barring players who were even remotely involved with point-shaving scandals. As a result, when his class was eligible for the draft in 1964, no team selected him. He was formally banned from the league in 1966.

== Professional career ==

=== Pittsburgh Rens (1961–1962) ===
With the biggest professional basketball league having blackballed him, Hawkins signed an undrafted deal with the Pittsburgh Rens of the American Basketball League (ABL), an aspiring rival to the NBA. He played with them for only one season and one partial season before the league unceremoniously shut down on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1962. On January 15, 1962, to kick off the second half of the ABL&#x27;s inaugural season, he scored a league-record 54 points in a 110-108 loss to the Cleveland Pipers. By the end of the season, he would be both named a member of the All-ABL First-Team and become the league&#x27;s most valuable player, putting up averages of 27.5 points (the league&#x27;s leader that season), 13.3 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game in 78 total games played for the Rens. His second season would have him dealing with injury problems, but before that season prematurely ended, he would still average 27.9 points (second behind Bill Bridges that year), 12.8 rebounds, and 2.6 assists in only 16 games played for that year.

=== Harlem Globetrotters (1963–1967) ===
After that league folded in the middle of the 1962–63 season, Hawkins spent four years performing with the Harlem Globetrotters. He learned how to control the basketball while barnstorming with the Globetrotters, influencing his later playing style 

During the time Hawkins was traveling with the Globetrotters, he filed a $6 million lawsuit against the NBA, claiming the league had unfairly banned him from participation and that there was no substantial evidence linking him to gambling activities. Hawkins&#x27;s lawyers suggested that he participate in the new American Basketball Association (ABA) as a way to establish his talent level as adequate to participate in the NBA, as well as an immediate source of income. Before playing in the ABA, Hawkins also played semi-professionally in a local industrial league called the Young Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Hebrew Association for a team called the Porky Chedwicks up until the summer of 1967. Also by this time, Hawkins was facing financial troubles from looking after his wife&#x27;s brother, who was mentally challenged, as well as his own children.
=== Pittsburgh/Minnesota Pipers (1967–1969) ===
Hawkins joined the Pittsburgh Pipers in the inaugural 1967–68 season of the ABA, leading the team to a 54–24 regular season record and the 1968 ABA championship. Hawkins led the ABA in scoring that year and won both the ABA&#x27;s regular season and playoff MVP awards. He was noted for his highly skillful passing ability (especially for a big man), leaping ability, and his awareness of what his teammates were doing on the court. The Pipers played against the New Orleans Buccaneers in the ABA finals that year, whose roster included point guard Larry Brown (who had played against Hawkins on Brooklyn&#x27;s public courts) and backup forward Doug Moe, who would both go on to long coaching careers, and Brown to the Hall of Fame. Hawkins averaged 30.2 points per game and 11.2 rebounds in the series.

The Pipers moved to Minnesota for the 1968–69 season, but injuries and a knee surgery limited Hawkins to 47 games, though he still averaged 30.2 points per game, was named to the All-Star team, and was second in MVP voting. The Pipers made the playoffs despite injuries to their top four players, but were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs in seven games, where Hawkins averaged 24.9 points and 12.3 rebounds per game. Following the playoffs, the Pipers franchise moved back to Pittsburgh.

Hawkins&#x27; lawyer, Roslyn Litman, and her husband, fellow lawyer S. David Litman, who was the brother of the Rens owner, filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA in 1966, arguing that the league and its owners blacklisted Hawkins. The NBA had refused to allow any team to hire Hawkins, who at the time the Litmans started working with him, was still playing for the Harlem Globetrotters.
In the light of several major media pieces, most notably a &quot;Life&quot; magazine article written by David Wolf, establishing the dubious nature of the evidence connecting Hawkins to gambling, the NBA concluded it was unlikely to successfully defend the lawsuit. Seeking to avoid a defeat in court which might jeopardize its ability to bar players who had actually participated in gambling, the NBA elected to settle after the 1968–69 season and admit Hawkins to the league.

The league paid Hawkins a cash settlement of nearly $1.3 million (approximately $ in 2025) in 1969, and assigned his rights to the expansion Phoenix Suns (who had won a league sponsored coin toss over the Seattle SuperSonics). Although the Pipers made a cursory effort to re-sign him, playing in the NBA had been a longtime ambition for Hawkins and he quickly signed with the Suns. After the 1970 season, the then Pittsburgh Condors unsuccessfully attempted to woo Hawkins back to Pittsburgh.

=== Phoenix Suns (1969–1973) ===
In 1969, still recovering from knee surgery in his final ABA season, Hawkins hit the ground running with the Phoenix Suns, when he played 81 games and averaged 24.6 points, 10.4 rebounds and 4.8 assists per game. In the final game of his rookie season against Elvin Hayes and the San Diego Rockets, Hawkins had 44 points, 20 rebounds, 8 assists, 5 blocks and 5 steals. The Suns finished third in the Western Conference. In the 1970 NBA playoffs they were knocked out by the Los Angeles Lakers in a seven-game Western Conference Semifinals series in which Hawkins carried the Suns against a team that had future Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor and Jerry West. In Game 2 of the series, on March 29, 1970, Hawkins led the Suns to a 114–101 victory while scoring 34 points, grabbing 20 rebounds, and recording 7 assists. For the series, Hawkins averaged 25.4 points per game, 13.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 46.9 minutes per game (despite his knee problems).

Hawkins was named First Team All-NBA that season. He was also a Western Conference starter in the All-Star game. He was tied for fifth in MVP voting that year.

He missed 11 games due to injury during the 1970–71 season, averaging 21 points per game. He matched those stats the next year, and was the top scorer on a per-game basis for the Suns in the 1971–72 season. He averaged a comparatively low 16 points per game for the Suns in the 1972–73 season.

=== Los Angeles Lakers (1973–1975) ===
Averaging 11.3 points nine games into the 1973–74 season and having been replaced in the starting lineup by Mike Bantom, Hawkins was traded from the Suns to the Lakers for Keith Erickson and a 1974 second-round selection (31st overall–Fred Saunders) on October 30.

=== Atlanta Hawks (1975–1976) ===
Injuries limited Hawkins&#x27; production in the 1974–75 season, and he finished his career after the 1975–76 season, playing for the Atlanta Hawks, still playing 24 and 26 minutes a game those last two seasons, but averaging less than ten points a game.

==Milestones==
In 1997, Connie Hawkins was named to the ABA&#x27;s All-Time Team.

Due to knee problems, Hawkins played in the NBA for only seven seasons. He was an All-Star from 1970 to 1973 and was named to the All-NBA First Team in the 1969–70 season. His No. 42 jersey was retired by the Suns.

Despite being unable to play in the NBA when he was in his prime, Hawkins&#x27; performances throughout the ABL, ABA and NBA helped get him inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992. He was the first Sun inducted into the Hall of Fame.

Longtime ABA, NBA and college head coach Larry Brown, a contemporary of Hawkins from Brooklyn who witnessed Hawkins play, and played against him, during Hawkins&#x27; teen and ABA years, said of Hawkins, &quot;&#x27;He was Julius [Erving] before Julius, he was Elgin [Baylor] before Elgin, he was Michael [Jordan] before Michael. ... He was simply the greatest individual player I have ever seen.&#x27;” Hawkins himself called Baylor his model. Doug Moe said of Hawkins, &quot;&#x27;He was the first guy on that Dr. J-Michael Jordan level... Nobody could match him.&#x27;&quot;

==Personal life==
The Hawkins&#x27; story up to 1971 is documented in the biography, &quot;Foul&quot; by David Wolf, 

In a skit for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1975, Hawkins played against singer Paul Simon in a one-on-one game accompanied by Simon&#x27;s song &quot;Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard.&quot; The skit was presented as a schoolyard challenge between the two and had Simon winning, despite the disparity in height between the two men (Simon at 5 ft 3 in, Hawkins at 6 ft 8 in).

One of Hawkins&#x27; nephews is Jim McCoy Jr., who scored a school-record 2,374 career points for the UMass Minutemen basketball team from 1988 to 1992.

He was the grandfather of Shawn Hawkins, who played professional basketball internationally and was a two-time scoring champion in Taiwan&#x27;s Super Basketball League (SBL).

Hawkins moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and worked in community relations for the Suns until his death from cancer on October 6, 2017, at the age of 75.

==In popular culture==

Hawkins’ story is the topic of a song titled &quot;The Legend of Connie Hawkins&quot; by Dispatch on their 2021 album &quot;Break Our Fall&quot;.

The Pittsburgh Pisces basketball team and the character Moses Guthrie, played by Julius Erving, in the movie The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh drew inspiration from Hawkins and the Pittsburgh Pipers of the ABA. Hawkins was in the movie.

<text>Ladislav Slovák (10 September 1919, Veľké Leváre – 22 July 1999, Bratislava) was a Slovak conductor.

He was a long-time director of the Slovak Philharmonic, taking over the job from his teacher and mentor Václav Talich. Amongst his most important recordings is the entire collection of Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s fifteen symphonies with Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra, published by Naxos Records. He studied in Leningrad under the Russian conductor Yevgeny Mravinsky, and met Shostakovich while participating in rehearsals of his music. From 1990 until 1995, Slovák recorded all twelve symphonies by Alexander Moyzes for the Marco Polo label of Naxos Records. These recordings were re-released between 2018 and 2019 on the Naxos label.

Slovák&#x27;s daughter, Kamila Magálová, is one of Slovakia&#x27;s best-known theatre actresses and a member of the Slovak National Theatre. His son Marián Slovák is also an actor.

<text>Indian National Congress (Sheikh Hassan) was a group of politicians from Goa which broke away from the Opposition Indian National Congress on 17 August 2002. 

This group was led by the former Speaker of the Goa assembly, Haji Sheikh Hassan Haroon. Five members of the legislative assembly joined the split. The new party declared its support to the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Goa People&#x27;s Congress government. However, four of the MLAs quickly deserted Sheikh Hassan and joined the BJP, the dominant partner of the then ruling coalition, which came to power in Goa mainly by splitting up the Congress and other political parties.

In October 2002 INC(SH) was included in the Government of Goa. Sheikh Hassan was appointed Minister of Industry and Handicraft and his party colleague Prakash Velip was appointed minister of cooperation, official languages, among other portfolios.

In the state elections 2002 Sheikh Hassan Haroon stood as a BJP candidate, and lost. Later, following the anti-Muslim communal riots in Curchorem, Sheikh Hassan moved away from the BJP which was out of power by this time, in early 2006 and cited the Curchorem violence as the reason for doing so. The current status of INC(SH) is unclear.

He was died in 7 May 2021 in Goa.

<text>Advance to Boardwalk is a 1985 spin-off of the Parker Brothers board game Monopoly.

==Setting==
Like its progenitor, its setting is the real-estate world in Atlantic City, New Jersey, but focuses only on the boardwalk. It involves the building of hotels, which are constructed by the various players who place markers to indicate the growing floors of the hotels.

More than one player can have floors in a given hotel, but much like Monopoly, advantages can be gained by owning a majority of floors in a given hotel.

==Game mechanics==
The board begins with a series of empty lots along the boardwalk, arranged in color groups, and laid out with property value cards. Trespassing dice are thrown: two standard numeric six-sided dice, and a special color die. The total number tells the player how much they are allowed to spend; the color die tells the player within which color group they can spend. The color die could also tell the player that they can build in any color group (when the die comes up as a &quot;W&quot;, for &quot;Wild&quot;), or that they have to draw a card (when the die comes up as an &quot;F&quot;, for &quot;Fortune Card&quot;).

When building, players can place as many hotel floors as desired on as many properties as able, up to the total numeric amount shown on the dice, and within the color group indicated. For example, if a 2 and 5 and &quot;blue&quot; are rolled, the player can place as many floors as he or she can on lots in the blue color group, up to $7 million. If the lots are empty, the player takes the property cards for those lots after &quot;building floors.&quot; At the end of the turn, the player moves their token up the boardwalk to the space that matches their new total in property values.

Opponents can &quot;take over&quot; a hotel, and take the property value cards for the hotel, by building more floors on an existing lot. In the event of ties, the color closest to &quot;ground level&quot; keeps the property value card. In the event of a &quot;takeover&quot;, the player who gains control of the lot can move his or her token up the boardwalk in the amount equal to the property, and his or her opponent&#x27;s token down the boardwalk in the amount equal to the property.

&quot;Fortune Cards&quot;, collected regularly, allow players to take advantage of construction bonuses, natural disasters, and other events to add and remove floors. Cards are picked up when an &quot;F&quot; is rolled (which usually overrides construction in that player&#x27;s turn), or when certain spaces on the boardwalk are reached, marked with an &quot;F&quot;. The first player to pass $35 million in hotel property value wins the game.

==Marketing==
The game is currently being marketed by Winning Moves as Monopoly Advance To Boardwalk.

<text>Bartholomew Eliot George Warburton (1810–1852), usually known as Eliot Warburton, was an Irish traveller and novelist, born near Tullamore, Ireland.

==Biography==
His father was Major George Warburton, Inspector General of the Royal Irish Constabulary for Aughrim, County Galway. His mother was Anne Maria Acton of Kilmacurragh, County Wicklow. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was called to the Irish Bar in 1837. He contracted lasting friendships with Monckton Milnes (Lord Houghton) and AW Kinglake, author of &quot;Eothen&quot;, which he admired. He decided to give up his practice as a barrister for travel and literature.

His first travel articles were published in the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot;, where the editor, Charles Lever persuaded him to make them into a book. This became his first book, &quot;The Crescent and the Cross&quot;, an account of his travels in 1843 in Greece, Turkey, Syria, Palestine and Egypt, and which fairly divided public attention with Kinglake&#x27;s &quot;Eothen&quot;, which appeared in the same year, 1844. Interest in England was centred in the East at the time, and Warburton had popular sympathy with Kinglake in his advocacy of the annexation of Egypt. But, apart from this consideration, the spirited narrative of Warburton&#x27;s adventures and the picturesque sketches of Eastern life and character were more than sufficient to justify the success of the book. It was a huge success and went into 18 editions.

In 1847 Warburton wrote &quot;Zoë: an episode of the Greek War&quot;, derived from a story he had heard while visiting the Greek islands. He donated the proceeds of the book to Irish famine relief. His most substantial work was a &quot;Memoir of Prince Rupert and the Cavaliers&quot; (1849), enriched with original documents, and written with eloquent partiality for the subject. This was followed in 1850 by &quot;Reginald Hastings&quot;, a novel, the scenes of which were laid in the same period of civil war, and, in 1851, by another historical novel, &quot;Darien, or The Merchant Prince&quot;. He was also for a time the editor of The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine.

He was planning to write a history of the poor, and on his last visit to Dublin visited slums and poor areas of the city. However, in 1852 he was sent by the Atlantic and Pacific Junction Company to explore the isthmus of Darién and to negotiate friendly relations between the company and the local Indian tribes. He sailed on this mission aboard the steamship , and died along with about 110 other passengers and crew when the &quot;Amazon&quot; caught fire and sank on 4 January 1852 in the Bay of Biscay.

==Family==
On 11 January 1848, he married Matilda Jane, second daughter of Edward Grove, of Shenstone Park, Staffordshire. They had two sons, George and Piers.

His brother, Major George Drought Warburton (1816–1857, named after his uncle George Drought of Glencarrig, County Wicklow), collaborated with him on &quot;Hochelaga, or England in the New World&quot; (1847), and &quot;The Conquest of Canada&quot; (1849). Another brother, Thomas, studied law at Trinity College, Dublin, while a sister, Sidney, was also a writer.

<text>Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party ( MGP) is a political party in India. It was Goa&#x27;s first ruling party after the end of Portuguese rule in Goa in 1961.

The party has its base amongst non-Brahmin Hindu migrants from Maharashtra and their descendants, a group that made up a large section of the poorer residents in Goa during Portuguese rule in Goa and whose numbers increased after 1961 by mass immigration from Maharashtra at the invitation of MGP politicians. However, the MGP proposal to merge Goa with Maharashtra was met with stiff opposition from the native Goans. Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India, then offered two options:
#To retain Goa&#x27;s current status as a Union Territory
#To merge Goa into the neighboring state of Maharashtra and the other erstwhile Portuguese enclaves of Daman and Diu into the neighbouring state of Gujarat

A law to conduct opinion poll to decide the issue of merger or otherwise of Goa, Daman and Diu with Maharashtra/Gujarat was passed by both the houses of the Indian Parliament, the Lok Sabha (on 1 December 1966), and the Rajya Sabha (on 7 December 1966) and the same received the assent of the President of India, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan on 16 December 1966. An opinion poll was subsequently held on 16 January 1967 to decide the fate of the union territory which voted to retain its status as separate from Maharashtra by 34,021 votes.

The continued mass immigration of Marathi people from Maharashtra to Goa helped the MGP to hold on to power for much of the first two decades of post-Portuguese Goa, despite being affected by some defections, by defeating the other contenders for power — primarily the United Goans Party (not to be confused with the United Goans Democratic Party founded in the 1990s) and the Indian National Congress.

During the first 18 years after the end of Portuguese rule, the MGP led the state government. However, the MGP today is marginalized when compared to its former status. The Bharatiya Janata Party, particularly during its reign between 1999 and 2005, took over most of the Hindu voters and also a large chunk of the MGP workers. Deepak Dhavalikar is the current president of the party and Pratap Fadte is the general secretary.

== History ==

MGP&#x27;s first chief minister was the mine owner Dayanand Bandodkar, followed by his daughter, Shashikala Kakodkar, who ascended to power after her father died in office, approximately a decade after taking over power, in 1973.
After Shashikala Kakodkar left MGP and joined Congress, Ramakant Khalap became leader of MGP in Goa Assembly and from just two seats under his charismatic leadership MGP won 18 seats in the subsequent elections. As recorded by the Supreme Court of India in the cases Dr. Kashinath Jalmi vs State of Goa and Ravi Naik V/s State of Goa at one time MGP had clear majority of 25 MLAs in the 40-member Assembly of Goa, however by blatant misuse of his powers under the Anti Defection Law and Constitution of India, the then Governor of Goa did not make Khalap Chief Minister of Goa.

MGP&#x27;s plank was largely based on populism, and promising a better deal to the Hindu economically deprived and socially oppressed sections in Goa. It was initially associated with a plank of merging Goa with the neighboring state of Maharashtra, a policy it subsequently backed away from when the 1967 Opinion Poll held in the region voted against the merger. It has also supported the use of the Marathi language; though some interpret its stand on language and merger as being partly a means of fighting caste issues and countering the domination of Goa by the traditional Hindu and Catholic elites.

The BJP allied with the MGP in the elections of 1994, and made inroads into that party&#x27;s vote-base, even though it won only four seats in that election, and the MGP got 10. Over the years, the MGP, which is symbolized by a lion and has a saffron flag, has been further eroded by the ascendent BJP.

Following an election in the early 2000s, the MGP were reduced to just one seat (out of a total of 40 seats) in the Goa legislative assembly, while the BJP made large gains.

In the Lok Sabha parliamentary elections of 2004, the party had launched candidates in both constituencies in Goa. They got 5377 and 2207 votes.

== 1994–1999 ==

In the early 1990s, the BJP was steadily gaining strength in national politics and was emerging as an alternative to the Indian National Congress (INC) at the center. Hoping to end years of Congress rule in the state, the MGP entered into a pre-poll alliance with the BJP in Goa.

Considering that the MGP drew its support from the Bahujan Samaj and the BJP&#x27;s demands for the demolition of the Babri Masjid, many believed that the electoral alliance would prove to be a tough competition to the ruling Congress as it would help consolidate the majority Hindu votes in its favor.

The MGP contested 25 seats whereas the BJP fielded its candidates from 12 constituencies. However, in the state elections, the Congress emerged as the single largest party, yet again, winning 18 seats. The MGP received 12 seats, whereas four BJP legislators were also elected. The candidates who won the elections on MGP ticket in 1994 were:

Following the results, the Congress formed a coalition government under the leadership of Pratapsinh Rane. However, in 1998, internal differences between the party leaders led to a split in the Congress.

Former CM Dr. Wilfred de Souza broke away with another nine MLAs to form a new political party – the Goa Rajiv Congress which grabbed power, thanks to support extended by both, the MGP as well as the BJP. The government lasted for just 120 days and the INC seized power in November 1998, just a few months before the 1999 assembly polls.
The 1994 coalition with the BJP proved to be a strategic blunder for the MGP, affecting the prospects of the party in the future. The national party soon started eating into the MGP&#x27;s traditional vote bank. As the BJP improved its tally over the next few elections, the MGP&#x27;s strength has declined exponentially. Many of its top leaders and ordinary cadres have either shifted to other parties or retired from active politics. Since the 1994 assembly polls, the MGP&#x27;s tally has never crossed the two digit mark.

== 1999–2002 ==

In the 1999 elections to the state legislature, the MGP was reduced to a mere 4 seats. On the other hand, its former partner, the BJP increased its tally to 10. The INC won a simple majority by winning 21 seats and Luizinho Faleiro was sworn in as the Chief Minister. 

Fearing internal rebellion, the Congress invited other parties to merge with it or join the government.

A few days later, the United Goans Democratic Party merged into the ruling party increasing its strength to 23. Soon, even the MGP joined the government. The MGP legislators who won the 1999 polls are specified below:

== Assembly Elections 2007 ==

The party improved its strength during the June 2007 state elections, in which it allied with the Indian National Congress party. The MGP got 9% of the vote and won two seats in the state assembly, a gain of one. The party entered a coalition government led by the Congress Party and also including the Nationalist Congress Party.

On 26 July 2007, its two MLAs and two Independent MLAs withdraw their support to Digambar Kamat Ministry leading to the reduction of his government into minority. However, they were later wooed back and the regime subsequently completed its full term.

== Assembly Elections 2012 ==

Prior to the elections to the state assembly in February 2012, the MGP withdrew its support to the Congress led coalition government citing the medium of instruction as one of the issues. It then entered into a pre-poll agreement with the BJP. Under this agreement, the party contested eight seats (Benaulim, Dabolim, Marcaim, Nuvem, Ponda, Priol, Quepem and Thivim) while its partner fielded its candidates in another 31 seats.

The allies supported independent candidate Nirmala Sawant from Cumbharjua. The elections were important for the party as it had to win either three seats or over 95,000 votes to retain its electoral symbol.

The party won three seats, all in and around the city of Ponda in central Goa. The Dhavalikar brothers retained their seats – Deepak Dhavalikar from Priol and Sudin Dhavalikar from Marcaim. Meanwhile, the MGP candidate Lavoo Mamledar beat Congress heavyweight and incumbent Home Minister Ravi Naik. The BJP won another 21 seats.

The BJP-MGP alliance came to power with the support of 26 MLAs, including two independent candidates, in the 40 member house. Sudin was the minister for PWD, Transport and River Navigation in the new cabinet. Deepak holds the portfolios of Co-operation, Factories &amp; Boilers.

The crisis had even reached the point where dissolution of the party was discussed. Although the MGP has been part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, the MGP and the BJP have been experiencing a rift to where Dhavalikar demanded that Laxmikant Parsekar (BJP) should resign as chief minister of Goa as a precondition for alliance talks for the 2017 polls. Parsekar responded by saying that the MGP&#x27;s MLAs should resign if they were not satisfied with the CM.

== Assembly Elections 2017 ==

Before the 2017 Goa Legislative Assembly election, MGP broke the alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party. Later, they joined hands with Goa Suraksha Manch of RSS leader Subhash Velingkar and Shiv Sena and contested of 27 seat in the state.

After the results were tallied, no party gained a clear majority; however, MGP won three seats. It decided to support the BJP-led coalition on the precondition that former CM Manohar Parrikar who was serving as the Minister of Defense in the central ministry be brought back to lead the government in Goa. The BJP agreed and MGP became a part of Manohar Parrikar led NDA government in Goa, Sudin Dhavalikar and Manohar Ajgaonkar of the MGP were given ministerial berths.

In March 2019, Sudin was appointed Deputy Chief Minister of Goa along with Goa Forward Party&#x27;s Vijai Sardesai in the newly formed Government of Promod Sawant. However, nine days later, he was dropped form the ministry. This was when two MGP MLAs (Manohar Ajgaonkar and Dipak Pawaskar) joined the Bharatiya Janata Party; their resignations reduced the tally of MGP to one. Soon thereafter, Ajgaonkar was appointed Deputy Chief Minister of Goa.

== Assembly Elections 2022 ==
in December 2021, MGP agree a prepoll alliance with All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) for Goa election. MGP will contest 13 constituencies in the 40-seat Goa Assembly. After the election results were tallied, MGP won two seats and the party gave the support latter to the BJP to Form the government in Goa again.

<text>Centenary College of Louisiana is a private liberal arts college in Shreveport, Louisiana. The college is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. Founded in 1825, it is the oldest chartered liberal arts college west of the Mississippi River and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).

==History==

Centenary College of Louisiana is the oldest college in Louisiana and is the nation&#x27;s oldest chartered liberal arts college west of the Mississippi River. Centenary traces its origins to two earlier institutions. In 1825, the Louisiana state legislature issued a charter for the College of Louisiana at Jackson. Its curriculum included courses in English, French, Greek, Latin, logic, rhetoric, ancient and modern history, mathematics, and natural, moral, and political philosophy. In 1839, the Mississippi Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, established Centenary College, first located in Clinton, Mississippi, then relocated to Brandon Springs. When the College of Louisiana lost the financial support from the state legislature in 1845, Centenary College purchased the facility and moved to Jackson.
In 1846, the college&#x27;s trustees changed the institution&#x27;s name to Centenary College of Louisiana and adopted the alumni of the two predecessor colleges. During the 1850s, enrollment reached 260, and the college constructed a large central building, which included classrooms, laboratories, literary society rooms, a library, a chapel, offices, and an auditorium with seating for over 2,000 people. This prosperity halted with the American Civil War. Following a meeting on October 7, 1861, the faculty minute book states, &quot;Students have all gone to war. College suspended; and God help the right!&quot; During the war, both Confederate and Union troops occupied the campus’ buildings. Centenary reopened in the fall of 1865, though it struggled financially through the remainder of the nineteenth century. In 1906 the Louisiana Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, accepted an offer from the Shreveport Progressive League to relocate the college. The Jackson campus now serves as the Centenary State Historic Site operated by the Louisiana Office of State Parks; it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Centenary opened in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1908. Enrollment and course offerings increased during the 1920s, and Centenary received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1925. During the 1920s and 1930s, the college&#x27;s football program earned fame for defeating such teams as Baylor, LSU, Rice, SMU, and Texas A &amp; M. The Centenary College Choir, formed in 1941, began performing throughout the region and eventually expanded to making national as well as international tours. In 1942, Centenary acquired a satellite campus, the former Dodd College, which served as a pre-flight training facility for air force cadets. Following the Second World War, the college undertook many new construction projects – dormitories, a cafeteria, a science building, a religious education center, a chapel, an expanded student center, a library, a theater, and a music building.

Centenary College&#x27;s campus spans sixty-five acres and is located two miles south of downtown Shreveport. The Dr. Ed Leuck Academic Arboretum, located in the heart of campus, is home to more than 300 species of plant life.
===Major buildings===
*The Anderson Choral Building, named in memory of G. M. &quot;Jake&quot; and Dr. Gertie Anderson, longtime trustees and benefactors of the college, the building houses the Nancy Mikell Carruth Choir Room, the Dr. Alberta E. Broyles Choral Room, and the Harvey and Alberta Broyles Choral Lounge. The Anderson building also contains a soundproof practice room and atrium.
*The Brown Memorial Chapel was erected in 1955, after a gift was made by the late Paul M. Brown, Jr., Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees, and his brother, Colonel S. Perry Brown, a life member of the Board, in honor of their parents. The chapel was renovated and rededicated in January 2003 and hosts religious services and special events.

*Bynum Memorial Commons, the cafeteria, built in 1956, was named in 1974 to honor Robert Jesse Bynum, New Orleans businessman and benefactor of the college. A generous grant from the Frost Foundation funded a 2006 renovation of the entire building, including the Edwin Frost Whited Room and the Centenary Alumni Hall of Fame.


*The Gold Dome, completed in 1971, is a physical education facility. The geodesic dome has a capacity of 3,000 and serves as the home basketball and volleyball court and gymnastics arena. After a recent renovation in 2011, the Gold Dome features a new hardwood painted floor, updated sub-floor electronics, premium seating, and a new Hi-Fi public address system.
*Hamilton Hall, the administration building completed in 1971, was largely the result of gifts by the late Mr. and Mrs. David Philip Hamilton. Mrs. Hamilton was a trustee of the college and a member of the first Centenary class to graduate in Shreveport.
*The Hargrove Memorial Amphitheatre was a gift of Mrs. R. H. Hargrove and her children and was built in memory of her husband, Mr. Reginald H. Hargrove. It is used for convocations, plays, and concerts.
*The Meadows Museum of Art, established in 1975, was created from the gift of Centenary alumnus Algur H. Meadows. After donating 360 works by the French artist Jean Despujols, Meadows also provided funding to renovate the former administrative building into a museum. The museum&#x27;s permanent collection now includes around 1500 works by various artists and regularly hosts exhibits that aim to educate students and the public on the importance of art.
*The John F. Magale Memorial Library, commonly shortened to Magale Library, was built in 1963 with the donation from the Magale Foundation. It provides students with access to many academic and student resources, free printing, study areas, tutoring, and more. The library building also contains the Centenary Archives and the Learning Commons. The emblem for Centenary College of Louisiana contains the signature bell tower that sits atop the Magale Library.

==Athletics==


Centenary is currently a member of the NCAA Division III&#x27;s Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC), having moved from the American Southwest Conference (ASC) after the 2011–12 academic year. Prior to July 2011, the college was a member of The Summit League in NCAA Division I.

The first official records of athletic teams at Centenary College are to be found in the 1908–1909 college catalog and 
the November 1909 issue of the Maroon and White, a monthly publication edited by the students.

Centenary fields 20 intercollegiate athletic teams including football, baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, and swimming for men; and basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, and volleyball for women.

U.S. Olympics Women&#x27;s Gymnastics Coach (Tokyo, 1964) Vannie Edwards coached the Centenary women&#x27;s gymnastics team from 1964 to 1968 and again from 1977 to 1985. Coach Edwards was also the team manager for the U.S. Olympics Women&#x27;s Gymnastics teams in 1968 (Mexico City) and 1972 (Munich). He was inducted into the U.S. Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1986.

Centenary previously fielded a college football team. From 1927 through 1936, the team compiled a record of 73–22–11, including two undefeated seasons (1927 &amp; 1932). The 1927 team featured wins over four powers in the Southwest Conference: Southern Methodist, Baylor, Rice, and Texas Christian. The 1932 team featured wins over Louisiana State, Texas, Texas A&amp;M, and Mississippi. Head Coach Homer Norton left Centenary after the 1933 season, and success and fan interest dwindled. After an 0–8–2 season in 1941, the team was discontinued for the duration of World War II due to budget deficits. Football resumed in 1947, but after winning only one game during the season, the football program was halted for good in December 1947.

In 2023, Centenary reinstated their football team for the first time in seven decades.

<text>A pedalboard (also called a pedal keyboard, pedal clavier, or, with electronic instruments, a bass pedalboard) is a keyboard played with the feet that is usually used to produce the low-pitched bass line of a piece of music. A pedalboard has long, narrow lever-style keys laid out in the same semitone scalar pattern as a manual keyboard, with longer keys for C, D, E, F, G, A, and B, and shorter, raised keys for C, D, F, G and A. Training in pedal technique is part of standard organ pedagogy in church music and art music.

Pedalboards are found at the base of the console of most pipe organs, pedal pianos, theatre organs, and electronic organs. Standalone pedalboards such as the 1970s-era Moog Taurus bass pedals are occasionally used in progressive rock and fusion music. In the 21st century, MIDI pedalboard controllers are used with synthesizers, electronic Hammond-style organs, and with digital pipe organs. Pedalboards are also used with pedal pianos and with some harpsichords, clavichords, and carillons (church bells).

==History==

===13th century to 16th century===

The first use of pedals on a pipe organ grew out of the need to hold bass drone notes, to support the polyphonic musical styles that predominated in the Renaissance. Indeed, the term pedal point, which refers to a prolonged bass tone under changing upper harmonies, derives from the use of the organ pedalboard to hold sustained bass notes. These earliest pedals were wooden stubs nicknamed &quot;mushrooms&quot;, which were placed at the height of the feet. These pedals, which used simple pull-downs connected directly to the manual keys, are found in organs dating to the 13th century. The pedals on French organs were composed of short stubs of wood projecting out of the floor, which were mounted in pedalboards that could be either flat or tilted. Organists were unable to play anything but simple bass lines or slow-moving plainsong melodies on these short stub-type pedals. Organist E. Power Biggs, in the liner notes for his album &quot;Organs of Spain&quot; noted that &quot;One can learn to play them, but fluent pedal work is impossible&quot;.

There were two approaches used for the accidental notes (colloquially referred to as the &quot;black&quot; notes). The first approach can be seen in the 1361 Halberstadt organ, which uses shorter black keys placed above the white keys. Other organs positioned the black keys on the same level and depth as the white keys. The first pedal keyboards only had three or four notes. Eventually, organ designers augmented this range by using eight notes, an approach now called a &quot;short octave&quot; keyboard, because it does not include accidental notes such as C, D, F, G, and A. The 17th-century north German organ builder Arp Schnitger used an F and G in the lowest octave of the manuals and pedal keyboards, but not a C and D. From the 16th to 18th centuries, short octave keyboards were also used in the lowest octave of upper manual keyboards.

By the 14th century, organ designers were building separate windchests for the pedal division, to supply the pipes with the large amount of wind that bass notes need to speak. These windchests were often built into tall structures called &quot;organ towers&quot;. Until the 15th century, most pedal keyboards only triggered the existing Hauptwerk pipes already used by the upper manual keyboards. Beginning in the 15th century, some organ designers began giving pedal keyboards their own set of pipes and stops. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the pedal division usually consisted of a few 8′ ranks and a single 16′ rank. By the early 17th century, pedal divisions became more complex, with a richer variety of pipes and tones. Nevertheless, the pedal division was usually inconsistent from one country to another.

===17th century to 18th century===

By the beginning of the 17th century, organ designers began to give pedalboards on large organs a larger range, encompassing twenty-eight to thirty notes. As well, German organ designers began to use longer, narrower pedals, with a wider space between the pedals. By this point, most pedals were given a smoother lever-action by including a fulcrum at the back of each pedal. These design changes allowed performers to play more complex, fast-moving pedal lines. This gave rise to the dramatic pedal solos found in German organ works from composers from the North German organ school, such as Dieterich Buxtehude, Johann Adam Reincken and J.S. Bach. In Bach&#x27;s organ music the cantus firmus melody, which is usually a hymn tune, is often performed in the pedal, using a reed stop to make it stand out.

Several sources, including an encyclopedia on the organ, claim that the pedalboard design improvements of the 17th century allowed the organist to actuate the pedals either with the toe of the foot or with the heel. However, organist Ton Koopman argues that
&quot;Bach&#x27;s complete oeuvre [can be played] with the pedal technique of his time, in other words without the use of the heel.&quot; Koopman claims that in &quot;Bach&#x27;s day toe and heel pedalling was not yet known, as is evident from his organ works, in which all the pedal parts can be played with the toe.&quot; What evolved as the &quot;German&quot; pedal technique in the late 18th and early 19th century promoted heel-and-toe pedaling, while the &quot;French&quot; style was predicated on the &quot;toe only&quot; pedal technique.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, pedalboards were rare in England. A critic for the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1895 argued that this may explain why Handel&#x27;s published organ works are generally lighter-sounding than those of J.S. Bach. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the pedal part of organ music was rarely given its own staff. Instead, the organ part would be put into two staves, which were mostly used for the upper and lower manual parts. When the composer wanted a part played with the pedal keyboard, they marked &quot;Pedal&quot;, &quot;Ped.&quot;, or simply &quot;P&quot;. Often, composers omitted these signs, and player had to decide if the range of all the parts or the lowest part was appropriate for the pedal keyboard. This lack of specification is in keeping with many other aspects of Baroque musical performance practice, such as the use of improvised chords by organists and harpsichord players in the figured bass tradition and the use of improvised ornaments by solo singers and instrumentalists.

===19th century to 20th century===

In the late 1820s, the pedalboard was still fairly unfamiliar in the UK. In the organ at the Church of St James at Bermondsey in 1829, &quot;a finger [manual] keyboard was added for those unable to play with their feet.&quot; If an organist was performing a piece with a pedal part, &quot;an assistant was needed to play the bottom line of the finger keyboard, offset on the bass side of the console.&quot; In 1855 in England, Henry Willis patented a concave design for the pedalboard that also radiated the ends keyboard outward and used longer keys, bringing the end keys closer to the performer. This design became common in the UK and in the US in the late 19th century, and by 1903, the American Guild of Organists (AGO) adopted it as their standard.

In the 19th century and early 20th century, the pedal division also underwent changes. The pedal divisions of the Baroque era often included a small number of higher-pitched stops, which allowed performers to perform higher melodies on the pedalboard. In the 19th century and early 20th century, organ designers omitted most of these higher-pitched stops, and used pedal divisions which were dominated by 8′ and 16′ stops. This design change, which coincided with the musical trend for music with a deep, rich bass part, meant that players used the pedalboard mainly for bass parts.

By the mid-19th century, the pedal part of organ music was increasingly given its own staff, which meant that composers and transcribers began writing organ music in three-stave systems (right hand, left hand, and pedal keyboard). Whereas early organ composers left the way that pedal keyboard lines were played to the player&#x27;s discretion, in the later 19th century, composers began to indicate specific foot actions.

In addition to telling the organist whether to use the left or right foot, symbols indicate whether they should use the toe or heel. A &quot;^&quot; symbol indicates the toe, and a &quot;u&quot; or &quot;o&quot; indicates the heel. Symbols below notes indicate the left foot, and above notes indicates the right foot.

Swedish organist L. Nilson published a method for the pedal keyboard, the English translation of which was titled &quot;A System of Technical Studies in Pedal Playing for the Organ&quot; (Schirmer, 1904). Nilson lamented that it &quot;...is a melancholy fact that only very few eminent organists since Bach&#x27;s time have made it their business to lift pedal-playing out of its primitive confusion...&quot; (page 1 of Preface). He argued that the great organ pedagogues such as Kittel and Abbe Vogler did not make any efforts to improve the &quot;...system of playing on the pedals&quot;. Nilson makes one exception from this critique: the organ method of J. Lemmens, who he praises as having reformed pedal playing by introducing &quot;...sound principles of execution&quot; (page 2 of Preface). Nilson&#x27;s pedal method includes scale and arpeggio studies, polyphonic studies with both feet playing in contrary motion, studies written in parallel octaves, and studies written in thirds.

===1990s–2000s===

In the 1990s, standalone electronic MIDI controller pedalboards became widely available on the market. MIDI pedalboards do not produce any tones by themselves, and so they must be connected to a MIDI-compatible electronic keyboard or MIDI sound module and an amplified loudspeaker to produce musical tones. In the 1990s and 21st century, some churches began using electronic-trigger equipped pedalboards for the 16′ and 32′ stops. The MIDI information from the electronic pedalboard sensors triggers pipe organ sounds from digital sound modules (e.g., Wicks CM-100, Ahlborn Archive Modules, or Walker Technical sound generation), which are then amplified through loudspeakers.

These MIDI systems can be much less expensive than metal or wooden bass pipes, which are very costly to purchase and install, due to their heavy weight (up to one ton per pipe), large size, and need for large amounts of wind. Another rationale for using MIDI systems is that it may be easier to get a focused sound with a MIDI system, because all of the bass tone emanates from a single speaker or set of speakers. With traditional pipes, it can be difficult to give the pedal division a focused sound, because the large pipes tend to be spread out over the entire organ pipe chest.

This cost-saving measure has been the subject of controversy in the organ scene. Advocates of MIDI pedal divisions argue that a good quality MIDI system produces a better tone than an inexpensive set of bass pipes with money-saving &quot;shortcuts&quot; such as using stopped pipes and resultant tones to reduce the number of required pipes. However, critics dislike the way that the use of MIDI pedal divisions blends electronically amplified lower voices with the natural, wind-driven upper ranks. Willi Apel and Peter Williams argue that by definition, an organ must make its sound by air flowing through pipes. Some critics argue that the bass tone from a MIDI pedal division, which comes from an amplified 12-inch subwoofer, is not as &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;open-sounding&quot; as the vibrations from a massive, wind-driven 32-foot pipe.

==Design==

===Keyboards===

Pedalboards range in size from 13 notes on small spinet organs designed for in-home use (an octave, conventionally C2–C3) to 42 notes (three and a half octaves, G1–C5) on church or concert organs. Modern pipe organs typically have 30- or 32-note pedalboards, while some electronic organs and many older pipe organs have 25-note pedalboards.

Besides the number of pedals, the two main identifying aspects of a pedalboard are:
#whether all the pedals are at the same height relative to the floor (&quot;flat&quot;), or whether the pedals in the middle are lower than those on the outer edges, forming a curved-in shape (&quot;concave&quot;), and
#whether all the pedals are completely parallel to each other (&quot;parallel&quot;), or whether the pedals are closer together at the far end than at the end closest to the organ console (&quot;radiating&quot;). Specifications vary by country, organ builder, era, and individual tastes.

Exact design specifications for pedalboards are published in Great Britain by the RCO, in the United States by the AGO (which requires a design similar to the RCO&#x27;s), and in Germany by the BDO (which allows both 30- and 32-note pedalboards, of both concave/radiating and concave/parallel varieties).

===Pedal division===

In an organ with more than one keyboard, the stops and the ranks that the stops control are separated into different divisions, in which the ranks of pipes are grouped together so that they make a &quot;focused&quot; or coherent sound. The pedal division, which is played from the pedal keyboard, usually includes more stops of 16′ pitch. The sound of the pedal division is generally voiced so that the pedal division complements the sound of the great division. Common 16′ stops found in the pedal division include the 16′ Bourdon, the 16′ Principal, and the 16′ Trombone. Eight foot stops include the 8′ Open Diapason. Pedal divisions may also include higher-register stops, such as the 4′ Choral Bass or various mixtures. When pedal parts are performed, a 16′ stop is usually paired with an 8′ one to provide more definition. For pedal parts that need accentuation, such as the Cantus Firmus melody in a 17th-century organ piece, many organs have a nasal-sounding reed stop in the pedal division, or a 4′ Principal designated on the stop knob as &quot;Choralbass&quot;.

A few pedalboards have a pedal divide system that lets the organist split the pedalboard at its midpoint. With this system, an organist can play a melody with the right foot and a bass part with the left. The divided pedal is a type of coupler. It allows the sounds played on the pedals to be split, so the lower octave (principally that of the left foot) plays stops from the pedal division while the upper half (played by the right foot), plays stops from one of the manual divisions. The choice of manual is at the discretion of the performer, as is the &#x27;split point&#x27; of the system.

The system can be found on the organs of Gloucester Cathedral, having been added by Nicholson &amp; Co (Worcester) Ltd/David Briggs and Truro Cathedral, having been added by Mander Organs/David Briggs, as well as on the new nave console of Ripon Cathedral.

===Controls===

In some organs, a wooden panel called a &quot;kickboard&quot; or &quot;kneeboard&quot; is installed above the pedalboard, between the pedals and the lowest manual keyboard. Expression pedals, coupler controls and toe studs (to activate stops or stop combinations) may be located on or set into the kickboard. Expression pedals are used to open and close shades or shutters that enclose the pipes of a given division. Combination pistons are used to make rapid stop changes from the console on organs with electric stop action. Toe studs are pistons that can be operated by the feet, which change either the pedal stops or the entire organ.

In some organs, a &quot;pedalboard check&quot; mechanism serves as a safety catch, to shut off the pedalboard keys. The mechanism prevents accidental foot contact with the pedalboard from sounding notes in a section written only for the upper manuals.
===Repertoire===

The works of Dutch composer, organist, and pedagogue Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck (1562–1621) contain the earliest example of an independent part for the pedal, rather than a sustained bass drone. His work straddled the end of the Renaissance and beginning of the Baroque eras, and he helped establish the north German organ tradition.

Dieterich Buxtehude (1637–1707), who was the most renowned composer of his time, was famous for his &quot;...virtuosity and innovation at the pedal board.&quot; The young Johann Sebastian Bach was influenced by Buxtehude, who used the pedal board &quot;as a full-fledged keyboard and devot[ed] virtuoso passages to it.&quot; J.S. Bach used the pedal to perform the melody in works such as his setting of the Christmas hymn, In Dulci Jubilo, in which the main theme in the tenor voice is played in the pedal on a higher-pitched stop. Bach also wrote compositions that use the pedal for dramatic virtuoso displays of scales and figurated passage-work in preludes, toccatas, fantasias and fugues.

There are a small number of organ compositions that are written solely for the pedal keyboard. English organist and composer George Thalben-Ball (1896–1987) wrote a piece entitled “Variations on a Theme by Paganini” for pedal keyboard. Based on Paganini&#x27;s “Caprice No. 24”, a virtuoso work for solo violin, it includes pedal glissandi, leaps from one end of the pedalboard to the other, and four-note chords.

Firmin Swinnen (1885–1972) was a Belgian organist who became famous in the US in the 1920s for his theater organ improvisations during silent films. Swinnen wrote a pedal cadenza for an arrangement of Widor&#x27;s &quot;Fifth Symphony&quot;. The cadenza was published separately by &quot;The American Organist&quot;. The publisher promoted the cadenza it as the &quot;most daring, the most musical Pedal Cadenza obtainable&quot;; this praise is corroborated by reviewers who were at the performance, who remarked at the complex footwork required by the work. The symphony was performed 29 times during the week of its premiere, to &quot;...literally screaming audiences...who had never seen such a sight as an organist up on a lift [platform] in the spotlight playing with his feet alone&quot;.

After injuring his left arm in 2008, the principal organist for the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square (Richard Elliott) prepared an arrangement of “Go Tell It On the Mountain” which begins with an entire verse played solely on the pedalboard to accommodate his then-injured arm. As his arm healed he added additional verses with the most demanding notes played with his right hand. The video of his unusual performance has garnered millions of views on YouTube.

Although the pedalboard is most frequently used for the bass part, composers from the 17th century to the present have often used it for higher parts as well. In his serene &quot;Le Banquet Céleste&quot; Olivier Messiaen places the tune, registered for 4′ flute (and higher mutation ranks), in the pedals.

From the early 20th century, composers have increasingly demanded an advanced pedal technique at the organ. Performers display their virtuosity in such works as Wilhelm Middelschulte&#x27;s &quot;Perpetuum mobile&quot;, Leo Sowerby&#x27;s &quot;Pageant&quot; (1931), and Jeanne Demessieux&#x27;s &quot;Six études&quot;, Op. 5 (1944), which recall the dramatic organ pedal solos of the Baroque era.

===Use on instruments other than organs===

====Pedal harpsichord and clavichord====

Pedal keyboards were developed for the clavichord and harpsichords during the Baroque era so that organists could practise the pedal parts of their organ repertoire when they had no-one available to work the bellows for a church organ or, in the wintertime, to avoid having to practice on a church organ in an unheated church. Johann Sebastian Bach owned a pedal harpsichord and his organ trio sonatas BWV 525–530, Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor BWV 582, Toccata and Fugue in D minor BWV 565, and other works sound well when played on the instrument.

====Pedal piano====

The pedal piano (or pedalier piano) is a kind of piano that includes a pedalboard

There are two types of pedal piano:
* A pedal board integrated with a manual piano instrument, using the same strings and mechanism as the manual keyboard
* An independent, pedal played piano with its own mechanics and strings, placed below a regular piano
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart owned a fortepiano with independent pedals, built for him in 1785. Robert Schumann had an upright pedal piano with 29 notes. In the 21st century, pedal pianos, the Doppio Borgato are made in the Borgato workshop in Italy. The bass pedalboard has 37 notes, A0 to A3 (rather than the standard 30 or 32 on an organ).

====Carillon====
Some large carillon systems for playing church bells include a pedalboard for the lowest-pitched bells. Carillon pedal keys activate a pull-down coupler that visibly moves the keys of the manual clavier and heavy clappers for the largest bells. These keys resemble the &quot;button keys&quot; of early organs, and are played by the player&#x27;s toes. Because this non-legato technique involves no sliding, shoes with leather soles are not required.
==In non-classical music==

===Jazz organ===

After jazz organist Jimmy Smith popularized the Hammond organ in jazz in the 1950s, many jazz pianists &quot;... who thought that getting organ-ized would be a snap ...&quot; realized that the Hammond &quot;... B-3 required not only a strong left hand, but studied coordination on the pedals to create the strong and solid &quot;jazz bass&quot; feel.&quot; Barbara Dennerlein combines advanced pedalboard techniques with agile playing on the manuals. Organists who play the bassline on the lower manual may do short taps on the bass pedals – often on the tonic of a tune&#x27;s key and in the lowest register of the pedalboard – to simulate the low, resonant sound of a plucked upright bass string.

In popular music, pedaling style may be more varied and idiosyncratic, in part because jazz or pop organists may be self-taught. Also, pedaling styles may differ due to the design of electromechanical organs and spinet organs, many of which have shorter pedalboards designed to play primarily with the left foot, so that the right foot can control a volume (swell) pedal.
===Rock and fusion===

In the 1970s, some progressive rock groups such as Yes, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Atomic Rooster and Rush used standalone Moog Taurus bass pedalboard synths, which were nicknamed &quot;bass pedals&quot; (despite the fact that the Taurus could play in a wide range, from bass to treble range). The Taurus generated an analog synth bass tone for amplification by a bass amp. Other groups, such as Led Zeppelin and Van Der Graaf Generator used the bass pedals of the Hammond organ in place of a bass guitar for several of their recordings and for live performances.

Other users included metal and hard rock bands such as Yngwie Malmsteen, Styx, and Francis Buchholz of the Scorpions, and Justin Harris of Menomena. Ex-Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett had a set mounted waist high, which his brother, John Hackett, played with his hands for the intro of &quot;Clocks – The Angel Of Mons&quot; from the album Spectral Mornings. Adam Jones of Tool uses the Moog Taurus along with an Access Virus B synth to trigger live effects. The keyboardist for the rock group Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer took this idea to its logical conclusion by performing all of the first movement, and part of the second of &quot;The Three Fates&quot; on the organ of Royal Festival Hall in London.

As well, some pop groups (e.g., The Police, Muse, U2) and fusion bands have used bass pedalboards to produce sounds in the bass range. They are most commonly used by keyboard players as an adjunct to keyboards, but can be played in combination with other instruments (e.g., by the bass guitar or electric guitar player), or by themselves.

Standalone pedalboards usually have a 13-note range and short pedals, which limits the types of basslines to fairly simple passages. A group&#x27;s bass guitarist or electric guitarist playing the pedalboard from a standing position can only use one foot at a time, which further limits what they can play. The BASYN analog bass synthesizer is a two-VCO analog synthesizer with a 13-note &quot;button board&quot;—with momentary push-button switches in place of pedals. Another variant used in rock bands is a bass pedalboard laid out as a tablature representation of part of the four strings of an electric bass guitar.

===MIDI and synthesizer pedalboards===
In the 1990s, standalone electronic MIDI controller pedalboards became widely available. Unlike the Moog Taurus pedalboards, MIDI pedalboards do not produce tones by themselves, but control a MIDI-compatible electronic keyboard or MIDI sequencer. In jazz organ trios, a keyboardist using this type of pedalboard usually connects it to a MIDI-compatible electronic Hammond organ-style keyboard. On modern electronic synthesizers such as the Yamaha Electone, the pedals are not limited to traditional bass notes but may instead produce many different sounds, including high-register tones. While MIDI pedalboards are typically used for musical sounds, since they use MIDI, technically the footpedals could be used to trigger lights or other electronic elements of a show.

MIDI pedalboards offer a range of features. Some MIDI pedalboards contain velocity-sensitive triggers, which produce MIDI velocity information for musical dynamics. MIDI pedalboards such as the 13-note Roland PK-5 include a row of MIDI toe switches above the pedal keyboard, so the performer can select preset tones or MIDI channels or change the octave. Larger 25-note Roland pedalboards also include an expression pedal for controlling the volume or other parameters. 

In the 2000s, controller designer Keith McMillen developed a 13-note velocity-sensitive pedalboard, the 12 Step foot controller, a MIDI controller with a USB output that can be connected to a MIDI-equipped synthesizer or sound module. McMillen&#x27;s pedalboard differs from other pedalboards in that it senses a variety of types of velocity and pressure, which the user can program to cause different effects on the synthesizer patch. McMillen&#x27;s pedalboard can be programmed so that pressing an individual pedal triggers chords (up to five simultaneous notes), which a one person band could use to provide accompaniment for live shows.

The Roland PK-9 and the Hammond XPK-200 are 20-note pedalboards that sound from low C to a high G. The Nord PedalKeys is a 27-note pedalboard, going from a low C to a high D. As compared with a 25-note pedalboard, the PedalKeys adds a high C# and a high D.

Some MIDI pedalboards are designed for the church pipe organ market, which means that they use AGO specifications such as a 32-note range. Most pipe organ-style MIDI pedalboards are too unwieldy for transportation, so they are typically installed under the upper manuals. However, a German company makes a MIDI pedalboard with a hinge in the middle and wheels on the underside for easy transport. Since AGO-specification MIDI pedalboards are often priced in between US$1000 and US$3000, some amateur home organists make DIY MIDI pedalboards by retrofitting an old pedalboard with MIDI. Due to the popularity of theater organs and Hammond organs during the 1950s and 1960s, many organ parts are on the market—including pedalboards (often with less than 32 notes, such as 20 or 25 notes) that cost under US$300. After the pedalboard is cleaned up and glass reed switches are repaired or replaced, the pedal contacts are soldered into a keyboard matrix circuit-equipped MIDI encoder, which then connects to any MIDI device to produce the sound of an organ or other instrument.

<doc id="1093059" wikidata="Q441182" url="?curid=1093059" title="Boris II of Bulgaria">
<text>Boris II (; ; c. 931 – 977) was the emperor (tsar) of Bulgaria from 969 to 977 (in Byzantine captivity from 971).

Boris II was the eldest surviving son of Emperor Peter I of Bulgaria and Maria (renamed Eirene) Lekapena, a granddaughter of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos of Byzantium. Boris had been born by 931, when he had visited Constantinople together with his mother.

Nothing else is known of Boris II&#x27;s life until 968, when he went to Constantinople again to negotiate a peace settlement with Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas, and apparently to serve as an honorary hostage. This arrangement was intended to put an end to the conflict between Bulgaria and Byzantium, who would now join forces against Prince Sviatoslav I of Kiev, whom the Byzantine emperor had pitted against the Bulgarians. In 969 a new Kievan invasion defeated the Bulgarians again and Peter I abdicated to become a monk. In circumstances that are not entirely clear, Boris II was allowed to return to Bulgaria and sit on his father&#x27;s throne. (&quot;The later Byzantine chronicle of John Skylitzes confounds this with a later event, in which Boris and his brother escaped Constantinople after the so-called rebellion of the Kometopouloi in Macedonia.&quot;)

Boris II was unable to stem the Kievan advance, and found himself forced to accept Sviatoslav of Kiev as his ally and puppet-master, turning against the Byzantines. A Kievan campaign into Byzantine Thrace was defeated at the Battle of Arkadioupolis in 970, and the new Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimiskes advanced northwards. Failing to secure the defense of the Balkan passes, Sviatoslav allowed the Byzantines to penetrate into Moesia and lay siege to the Bulgarian capital Preslav. Although Bulgarians and Ruses joined in defending the city, the Byzantines managed to set afire the wooden structures and roofs by missiles, and took the fortress. Boris II now became a captive of John I Tzimiskes, who continued to pursue the Kievan Army, besieging Sviatoslav in Drăstăr (Silistra), while claiming to act as Boris&#x27;s ally and protector, and treating the Bulgarian monarch with due respect. After Sviatoslav had come to terms and set out for Kiev, the Byzantine emperor returned to Constantinople in triumph. Far from liberating Bulgaria as he had claimed, John brought along Boris II and his family, together with the contents of the Bulgarian imperial treasury in 971. In a public ceremony in Constantinople, Boris II was ritually divested of his imperial insignia and was given the Byzantine court title of &quot;magistros&quot; as compensation. The Bulgarian lands in Thrace and lower Moesia now became part of the Byzantine Empire and were placed under Byzantine governors.

Although the ceremony in 971 had been intended as a symbolic termination of the Bulgarian empire, the Byzantines were unable to assert their control over the western provinces of Bulgaria. These remained under the rule of their own governors, and especially of a noble family led by four brothers called the &quot;Kometopouloi&quot; (i.e., &quot;the sons of the Count&quot;), named David, Moses, Aron, and Samuel. The movement was regarded as a &quot;revolt&quot; by the Byzantine emperor, but it apparently saw itself as a sort of regency for the captive Boris II. As they began to raid neighboring territories under Byzantine rule, the Byzantine government resorted to a stratagem intended to compromise the leadership of this &quot;revolt&quot;. This involved allowing Boris II and his brother Roman to escape from their honorary captivity at the Byzantine court, in the hope that their arrival in Bulgaria would cause a division between the Kometopouloi and other Bulgarian leaders. As Boris II and Roman entered the region under Bulgarian control in 977, Boris II dismounted and went ahead of his brother. Mistaken for a Byzantine notable due to his attire, Boris was shot in the chest by a deaf and mute border patrol. Roman managed to identify himself to the other guards and was duly accepted as emperor.

==Family==
By his marriage to an unknown woman, Boris II had several children, as the Byzantine historian Kedrenus refers to Emperor John I Tzimisces finding &quot;cum coniuge et liberis Borises Bulgarorum rex&quot; among the Russian prisoners when he invaded Bulgaria. His children may include:
* (possibly) Maria, wife of Tsar Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria; this descent has been proposed by Christian Settipani based on prosopographical and onomastic elements which appear to link Maria to the Krum dynasty.
* An unnamed daughter, engaged to the Byzantine Emperor Basil II in 968
* An unnamed daughter, engaged to the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VIII in 968

<doc id="1093060" wikidata="Q3576021" url="?curid=1093060" title="Howletts Wild Animal Park">
<text>Howletts Wild Animal Park (formerly known as Howletts Zoo) in the parish of Bekesbourne, near Canterbury in Kent, was established as a private zoo in 1957 by John Aspinall. In 1962, the House known as Howletts was being restored. A small cottage was inhabited by an employee. The animal collection was opened to the public in 1975. To give more room for the animals another estate at Port Lympne near Hythe in Kent was purchased in 1973, and opened to the public as Port Lympne Zoo in 1976.

The collection is known for being unorthodox, for the encouragement of close personal relationships between staff and animals, and for the breeding of rare and endangered species. Steve Irwin visited the park in 2004 and described the zoo&#x27;s gorillas as &quot;the finest in the world&quot;.

Since 1984, both parks have been owned by the John Aspinall Foundation, a charity. Following his death, John Aspinall was buried in front of the Howletts House and a memorial was built next to the grave near the bison.
A later extension to Howletts was an open-topped enclosure for black and white colobus, just behind the entrance.

== Animal collection ==

The park has some of the largest family groups of western lowland gorillas in the world. It is also home to the largest breeding herd of African elephants in the United Kingdom and has one of the largest breeding groups of lion-tailed macaques in the world.

==Charity events==
The charity that runs Howletts and Port Lympne Wild Animal Park, the John Aspinall Foundation, also runs animal conservation programmes. It has had recent success in releasing a black rhino into the wild and has previously released other black rhinos and gorillas.

==Television==
Howletts and Port Lympne have featured on the CBBC television programme &quot;Roar&quot;. This shows the two parks, the life of the animals and how the keepers look after them. The first series was filmed in 2006 and, as of March 2009, there have been four series in total.

==Howletts House==
Originally called Owletts, in the parish of Bekesbourne, the present house containing 30 rooms was built for Isaac Baugh in 1787 and replaced a previous house which had been the seat of the Isaac family until the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, later of the Hales family for several generations. It passed into the ownership of the Gipps family in 1816. It has been a Grade II* listed building and on the National Heritage List for England since January 1967. The house is presently let by the Aspinall Foundation to Damian Aspinall

<doc id="1093065" wikidata="Q736873" url="?curid=1093065" title="Port Lympne Wild Animal Park">
<text>Port Lympne Hotel &amp; Reserve near the town of Hythe in Kent, England is set in and incorporates the historic Port Lympne Mansion, and landscaped gardens designed by architect Sir Herbert Baker, for Sir Philip Sassoon.

The estate with an Edwardian mansion near Lympne was purchased in 1973 by John Aspinall; the intent was to solve lack of space at the nearby Howletts Wild Animal Park. It was opened to the public in 1976. Since 1984 the animal parks have been owned by a charity (The John Aspinall Foundation, currently led by Damian Aspinall). The collection is known for being unorthodox, for the encouragement of close personal relationships between staff and animals, and for their breeding of rare and endangered species. The park now includes tigers, lions, leopards, gorillas, bears, giraffes and the UK&#x27;s largest herd of black rhinos. The facility also plans to release some of the animals into the wild.

Royalty and many other famous people have stayed at the mansion at the centre of the park. The rooms are lavishly decorated and the landscaped gardens have views of Romney Marsh. Other accommodations are also provided in the Park, some in Lion Lodge, Tiger Lodge, Bear Lodge (glamping), Rhino Lodge, Treehouse Hotel, The Bubble, Hogdeer Creek, Giraffe Cottage, Giraffe Lodge (glamping), Pinewood (glamping), Wolf Lodge and Forest Hideaway. The latest accommodation options are 
Lion Lodge and the 20-bedroom Giraffe Hall.

==The Dinosaur Forest==
Opened in 2016 to coincide with the park&#x27;s 40th birthday, the Dinosaur Forest spans three acres of ancient woodland, and features over 100 life sized and anatomically correct models. Rangers discuss the animal kingdom of millions of years ago. Visitors are invited to dig for fossils and try the &quot;create your own dinosaur&quot; activity.

==Animal collection==

Port Lympne houses many rare and endangered species and the largest breeding herd of black rhinos in the UK. There are small cats, monkeys, tapirs, lions, painted dogs and many more, some of which are on the circular walk. The zoo has an &#x27;African Experience&#x27; safari trail where visitors are transported on specially modified vehicles around the park to view giraffe, zebra, antelope and wildebeest.

In 2000, a 27-year-old keeper was killed whilst working in the stall of a female Indian elephant called La Petite.

In 2015, the Park moved its herd of Asian elephants following numerous deaths amongst them related to a persistent outbreak of a strain of herpes virus found in captive elephant populations. In 2005, after many years of stillbirths, two infant mortalities, and several premature adult fatalities, the first surviving mother-reared calf, Sittang, succumbed to the virus. This incident occurred one month after an adult female produced a stillborn calf and also perished. Port Lympne&#x27;s remaining calf, May Tagu, who was born in April 2005, was transferred to Antwerp Zoo following the spate of deaths, along with her mother and one other cow. The remaining adults were moved to Terra Natura in Benidorm, Spain, where many other former Port Lympne elephants reside. This move has allowed the park to focus on its breeding African elephants. Three cows have been moved from Howletts Wild Animal Park, followed soon after by a bull named Kruger from Knowsley Safari Park. Howletts is home to the UK&#x27;s largest herd of African elephants. In 2022 Port Lympne became the only zoo in Europe to house 3 species of rhino including the Black Rhino, White Rhino and Indian Rhino.

== Introducing captive animals into the wild ==
According to a U.S. report, Damian Aspinall had purchased about a million acres in Africa and turned the area into a park in an attempt to protect gorillas whose numbers have been declining due to the loss of habitat and poaching. The Foundation&#x27;s website however, clarifies this: &quot;The Aspinall Foundation is working with the governments of the Congo-Brazzaville and the neighbouring state of Gabon to protect around one million acres within the unique savannah ecosystem of the Batéké Plateau. ... We have reintroduced over 60 gorillas back into the wild, including 22 who travelled from our Parks in Kent&quot;. In a 2016 interview, Aspinall added that &quot;we&#x27;ve reintroduced eight black rhinos into the wild&quot; presumably, all born in Kent.

A BBC report in 2014 stated that the Foundation managed two gorilla rescue and rehabilitation projects in Gabon and Congo, respectively. A subsequent report stated that five of ten of the gorillas released in 2014 had been found dead soon after, possibly due to attacks by other gorillas.

Tara Stoinski of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund made this comment on the television program 60 Minutes (aired 15 March 2015): &quot;I think that humans have a very romantic notion of what the wild is like, and the wild is not a place where it is safe, and animals get to roam free and make choices&quot;. She wonders about the value of sending zoo-born animals to Africa and believes that it would be wiser for Aspinall to use his funds to save gorillas already in the wild.

In a 2016 interview, Aspinall blamed one gorilla that the Foundation had released for killing the five others. He also complained about the negative publicity about the event. &quot;What about the 60 we released that survived? There&#x27;s no glory if you get it right. We get no press, no publicity – but boy, if anything goes wrong, they jump on you.&quot; 
The Park has also introduced other animals into the wild. However, a black rhino (called Zambezi), that was born and raised at the Park, died while being flown to Tanzania in June 2019. The rhino was part of a plan to repopulate the Serengeti.

In 2022, the Aspinall Foundation announced that 13 elephants, born in captivity, would be returned to Africa, for release in the wilds of Kenya. Some experts questioned the wisdom of this strategy, citing issues such as the stress caused by &quot;a hazardous journey&quot;, low temperatures at night in Africa, as well as &quot;unfamiliar surroundings, foraging for food, predators and illness&quot;. Some concern was also expressed about water quality and the risk of conflict with the human population. The Foundation replied with a statement that it &quot;has a 30-year history of successful rewilding projects around the globe&quot;.

== Animal enclosures ==
The park is split into two sections; one allows visitors to walk around (or use golf buggies) to view animals in enclosures, such as primates and carnivores like big cats. The other is a safari park toured in open-sided trucks, divided into South American, Asian and African safari sections. Nearly 90 different species of animals are kept at the 600 acre Park.

=== Palace of the Apes ===

Palace of the Apes is the world&#x27;s largest gorillarium, housing a large breeding troop. In late 2018, the Park announced the death of Britain&#x27;s oldest gorilla, Babydoll, who died at age 57. At the time, a news report stated that Damian Aspinall, &quot;whose father John created the Aspinall&#x27;s casino empire, has dedicated his life to gorilla conservation&quot;.

<text>A dip bar is a piece of fitness equipment that consists of a U-shaped bar, usually about in diameter, which surrounds the user&#x27;s body at the waist. It is designed for the performance of, and named after, the dip exercise.

In addition to this exercise, much like the trap bar can be used for deadlifts, a dip bar has other potential uses. It can, for example, be used to do handstand pushups, or the forearms can lie on it to be used as a (probably less comfortable) captain&#x27;s chair for doing things such as knee raises. When dip bars have clearance under the handles, they also allow the exerciser to do things like hip abduction leg raises, to work muscles like the gluteus medius.

Dip bars that are high enough can also be used via having the hands below the bar instead of on top of them, using the finger flexors to hang on. They can be used to hold the very top motion of a pull-up (generally they are not high enough to allow significant range of motion in this movement, even if the knees are bent or pulled to the chest) as well as to perform supine rows.

<doc id="1093068" wikidata="Q1329239" url="?curid=1093068" title="Horseshoe crab">
<text>Horseshoe crabs are arthropods of the family Limulidae and the only surviving xiphosurans. Despite their name, they are not true crabs or even crustaceans; they are chelicerates, more closely related to arachnids like spiders, ticks, and scorpions. The body of a horseshoe crab is divided into three main parts: the cephalothorax, abdomen, and telson. The largest of these, the cephalothorax, houses most of the animal&#x27;s eyes, limbs, and internal organs. It is also where the animal gets its name, as its shape somewhat resembles that of a horseshoe. Horseshoe crabs have been described as &quot;living fossils&quot;, having changed little since they first appeared in the Triassic.

Only four species of horseshoe crab are extant today. Most are marine, though the mangrove horseshoe crab is often found in brackish water. Additionally, certain extinct species transitioned to living in freshwater. Horseshoe crabs primarily live at the water&#x27;s bottom but they can swim if needed. In the modern day, their distribution is limited, only found along the east coasts of North America and South Asia.

Horseshoe crabs are often caught for their blood, which contains Limulus amebocyte lysate, a chemical used to detect bacterial endotoxins. Additionally, the animals are used as fishing bait in the United States and eaten as a delicacy in some parts of Asia. In recent years, horseshoe crabs have experienced a population decline. This is mainly due to coastal habitat destruction and overharvesting. To ensure their continued existence, many areas have enacted regulations on harvesting and established captive breeding programs.

== Phylogeny and evolution ==
The fossil record of xiphosurans extends back to the Late Ordovician, or around 445 million years ago. For modern horseshoe crabs, their earliest appearance was approximately 250 million years ago during the Early Triassic. Because they have seen little morphological change since then, extant (surviving) forms have been described as &quot;living fossils&quot;.

Horseshoe crabs resemble crustaceans but belong to a separate subphylum of the arthropods, Chelicerata. Horseshoe crabs are closely related to the extinct eurypterids (sea scorpions), which include some of the largest arthropods to have ever existed, and the two may be sister groups. The difficult-to-classify chasmataspidids are also thought to be closely related to horseshoe crabs.

The radiation of horseshoe crabs resulted in 22 known species, of which only 4 remain. The Atlantic species is sister to the three Asian species, the latter of which are likely the result of two divergences relatively close in time. The last common ancestor of the four extant species is estimated to have lived about 135 million years ago in the Cretaceous.

Limulidae is the only extant family of the order Xiphosura, and contains all four living species of horseshoe crabs:
* &quot;Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda&quot;, the mangrove horseshoe crab, found in South and Southeast Asia
* &quot;Limulus polyphemus&quot;, the Atlantic or American horseshoe crab, found along the Atlantic coast of the United States and the Southeast Gulf of Mexico
* &quot;Tachypleus gigas&quot;, the Indo-Pacific, Indonesian, Indian, or southern horseshoe crab, found in South and Southeast Asia
* &quot;Tachypleus tridentatus&quot;, the Chinese, Japanese, or tri-spine horseshoe crab, found in Southeast and East Asia

=== Phylogeny ===
The horseshoe crab&#x27;s position within Chelicerata is complicated. However, most morphological analyses have placed them outside the Arachnida. This assumption was challenged when a genetics-based phylogeny found horseshoe crabs to be the sister group to the ricinuleids, thereby making them an arachnid. In response, a more recent paper has again placed horseshoe crabs as separate from the arachnids. This new study utilized both new and more complete sequencing data while also sampling a larger number of taxa.

Below is a cladogram showing the internal relationships of Limulidae (modern horseshoe crabs) based on morphology. It contains both extant and extinct members.

=== Whole genome duplication ===
The common ancestor of arachnids and xiphosurans (the group that includes horseshoe crabs) underwent a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event. This was followed by at least two, possibly three, WGDs in a common ancestor of the living horseshoe crabs. This gives them unusually large genomes for invertebrates (the genomes of &quot;C. rotundicauda&quot; and &quot;T. tridentatus&quot; being approximately 1.72 Gb each). Evidence for the duplication events includes similarity in structure between chromosomes (synteny), and clustering of homeobox genes. Over time, many of the duplicated genes have changed through processes of neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization, meaning their functions are different from what they originally were.

=== Evolution of sexual size dimorphism ===
Several hypotheses have been given as possible reasons why a size difference exists between male and female horseshoe crabs This phenomenon is known as sexual size dimorphism and results in the females having a larger average size than males. The existence of this trend is likely due to a combination of two things:

# First, females take a year longer to mature and undergo an additional molt, giving them a larger average body size.
# Second, larger female horseshoe crabs can house more eggs within their bodies. This lets them pass on more genetic material than smaller females during each mating cycle, making larger females more prevalent.

== Anatomy and physiology ==

=== General body plan ===

Like all arthropods, horseshoe crabs have segmented bodies with jointed limbs, which are covered by a protective cuticle made of chitin. They have heads composed of several segments, which eventually fuse as an embryo.

Horseshoe crabs are chelicerates, meaning their bodies are composed of two main parts (tagma): the cephalothorax and the opisthosoma. The first tagma, the cephalothorax or prosoma, is a fusion of the head and thorax. This tagma is also covered by a large, semicircular, carapace that acts like a shield around the animal&#x27;s body. It is shaped like the hoof of a horse, giving this animal its common name. In addition to the two main tagmata, the horseshoe crab also possesses a long tail-like section known as the telson.

In total, horseshoe crabs have 6 pairs of appendages on their cephalothorax. The first of these are the chelicerae, which give chelicerates their name. In horseshoe crabs, these look like tiny pincers in front of the mouth. Behind the chelicerae are the pedipalps, which are primarily used as legs. In the final molt of males, the ends of the pedipalps are modified into specialized, grasping claws used in mating. Following the pedipalps are three pairs of walking legs and a set of pusher legs for moving through soft sediment. Each of these pusher legs is biramous or divided into two separate branches. The branch closest to the front bears a flat end that looks like a leaf. This end is called the flabellum. The branch towards the back is far longer and looks similar to a walking leg. However, rather than ending in just a claw, the back branch has four leaf-like ends that are arranged like a petal. The final segment of the cephalothorax was originally part of the abdomen but fused in the embryo. On it are two flap-like appendages known as chilaria. If severed from the body, lost legs or the telson may slowly regenerate, and cracks in the body shell can heal.

The opisthosoma or abdomen of a horseshoe crab is composed of several fused segments. Similar to a trilobite, the abdomen is made up of three lobes: a medial lobe in the middle, and a pleural lobe on either side. Attached to the perimeter of each pleural lobe is a flat, serrated structure known as the flange. The flange on either side is connected by the telson embayment, which itself is attached to the medial lobe. Along the line where these lobes meet are six sets of indentations known as apodeme. Each of these serves as a muscle attachment point for the animal&#x27;s twelve movable spines.

On the underside of the abdomen are several biramous limbs. The branches closest to the outside are flat and broad, while the ones on the inside are more narrow. Closest to the front is a plate-like structure made of two fused appendages. This is the genital operculum and is where horseshoe crabs keep their reproductive organs. Following the operculum are five pairs of book gills. While mainly used for breathing, horseshoe crabs can also use their book gills to swim. At the end of a horseshoe crab&#x27;s abdomen is a long, tail-like spine known as a telson. It is highly mobile and serves a variety of functions.

=== Nervous system ===

==== Eyes ====

Horseshoe crabs have a variety of eyes that provide them with useful visual information. The most obvious of these are two large compound eyes found on top of the carapace. This feature is unusual, as all other living chelicerates have lost them in their evolution. In adult horseshoe crabs, the compound eyes comprise around 1,000 individual units known as ommatidia. Each ommatidium is made up of a ring of retinal and pigment cells that surround something known as the eccentric cell. This secondary visual cell gets its name from the way it behaves. The eccentric cell is coupled with the dendrites of normal retinal cells so that when a normal cell depolarizes in the presence of light, the eccentric cell does too.

A horseshoe crab&#x27;s compound eyes are less complex and organized than those of most other arthropods. Ommatidia are arranged messily in what&#x27;s been deemed an &quot;imperfect hexagonal array&quot; and have a highly variable number of photoreceptors (between 4 and 20) in their retina. Although each ommatidium typically has one eccentric cell, there are sometimes two, and occasionally more. All the eye&#x27;s photoreceptors, both rods and cones, have a single visual pigment with a peak absorption of around 525 nanometers. This differs from insects or decapod crustaceans, as their photoreceptors are sensitive to different spectrums of light. Horseshoe crabs have relatively poor vision, and to compensate for that, have the largest rods and cones of any known animal, about 100 times the size of humans&#x27;. Furthermore, their eyes are a million times more sensitive to light at night than during the day.

At the front of the animal along the cardiac ridge are a pair of eyes known as median ocelli. Their retina is even less organized than those of the compound eyes having between 5 and 11 photoreceptors paired with one or two secondary visual cells called arhabdomeric cells. Arhabdomeric cells are equivalent to eccentric cells as they function identically. The median ocelli are unique due to having two distinct visual pigments. While the first functions similarly to the pigment in the compound eyes, the second has a peak absorption of around 360 nanometers, allowing the animal to see ultraviolet light.

Other, more rudimentary eyes in horseshoe crabs include the endoparietal ocelli, the two lateral ocelli, two ventral ocelli, and a cluster of photoreceptors on the abdomen and telson. The endoparietal, lateral, and ventral ocelli are very similar to the median ocelli, except like the compound eyes, they only see in visual light with a peak absorbance of around 525 nanometers. The endoparietal eye further differs due to being a fusion of two separate ocelli. This eye is found not far behind the median eyes and sits directly on the cardiac ridge. The two ventral ocelli are located on the underside of the cephalothorax near the mouth and likely help to orient the animal when walking around or swimming. The lateral eyes can be found directly behind the compound eyes and become functional just before a horseshoe crab larvae hatch. The telson&#x27;s photoreceptors are unique as they&#x27;re spaced throughout the structure rather than located in a fixed spot. Together with UV-seeing median ocelli, these photoreceptors have been found to influence the animal&#x27;s circadian rhythm.

=== Circulation and respiration ===

Like all arthropods, horseshoe crabs have an open circulatory system. This means that instead of using a system of closed-off veins and arteries, gasses are transported through a cavity called the hemocoel. The hemocoel contains hemolymph, a fluid that fills all parts of the cavity and serves as the animal&#x27;s blood. Rather than using iron-based hemoglobin, horseshoe crabs transport oxygen with a copper-based protein called hemocyanin, giving its blood a bright blue color. The blood also contains two types of cells: amebocytes that are utilized in clotting, and cyanocytes that create hemocyanin.

Horseshoe crabs pump blood with a long, tubular heart located in the middle of their body. Like the hearts of vertebrates, the hearts of these animals have two separate states: a state of contraction known as systole, and a state of relaxation known as diastole. At the beginning of systole, blood leaves the heart through a large artery known as the aorta and numerous arteries parallel to the heart. Next, the arteries dump blood into large cavities of the hemocoel surrounding the animal&#x27;s tissues. Larger cavities lead to smaller cavities, allowing the hemocoel to oxygenate all the animal&#x27;s tissues. During diastole, blood flows from the hemocoel to a cavity known as the pericardial sinus. From there, blood re-enters the heart and the cycle begins again.

Horseshoe crabs breathe through modified swimming appendages beneath their abdomen known as book gills. While they appear smooth on the outside, the insides of these book gills are lined with several thin &quot;pages&quot; called lamellae. Each lamella is hollow and contains an extension of hemocoel, allowing gasses to diffuse between a Horseshoe crab&#x27;s blood and external environment. There are roughly 80–200 lamellae are present in each gill, with all ten of them giving the animal with a total breathing surface area of about two square meters. When underwater, the lamellae are routinely aerated by rhythmic movement of the book gills. These movements create a current that enters through two gaps between the cephalothorax and abdomen and exits on either side of the telson.

=== Feeding, digestion, and excretion ===

Horseshoe crabs first break up their food using bristles known as gnathobases located at the coxa or base of their walking limbs. Gnathobases on the right and left legs form a cavity known as the food groove that begins near the pusher legs and extends to the animal&#x27;s mouth. The end of the groove is closed off by the animal&#x27;s chilaria. To break up any food, each pair of coxa moves in the opposite direction parallel to the ones in front of and behind it. This motion happens while feeding and walking, pushing food towards the mouth. Horseshoe crabs catch soft prey with claws on their second to fifth legs and place them in the food groove to be ground up. For harder prey, Horseshoe crabs use a pair of stout, cuspid gnathobases (informally known as &quot;nutcrackers&quot;) on the back of their sixth legs. After the food is sufficiently torn up, it is moved by the chelicerae into the mouth for further digestion.

Horseshoe crabs are some of the only living chelicerates with guts that can process solid food. Its digestive system is J-shaped, lined with a cuticle, and can be divided into three main sections: the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. The foregut is contained in the animal&#x27;s cephalothorax and comprises the esophagus, crop, and gizzard. The esophagus moves food from the mouth to the crop where it is stored before entering the gizzard. The gizzard is a muscular, toothed organ that serves to pulverize the food from the crop and regurgitate any indigestible particles. The foregut terminates in the pyloric valve and sphincter, a muscular door of sorts that separates it from the midgut.

The midgut is composed of a short stomach a long intestinal tube. Connected to the stomach are a pair of large, sack-like digestive ceca known as hepatopancreases. These ceca fill most of the cephalothoracic and abdominal hemocoel and are where most digestion and nutrient absorption takes place. Before and following digestion, the midgut lining (epithelium) secretes a peritrophic membrane made of chitin and mucoproteins that surrounds the food and later the feces.

Horseshoe crabs excrete waste through both their book gills and hindgut. Similar to many aquatic animals, horseshoe crabs have an ammonotelic metabolism and eliminate ammonia and other small toxins through diffusion with their gills. After being processed in the midgut, waste is passed into a muscular tube known as the hindgut or rectum and then excreted from a sphincter known as the anus. Externally, this opening is located on the bottom side of the animal right below its telson.

== Distribution and habitat ==

In the modern day, horseshoe crabs have a relatively limited distribution. The three Asian species mainly occur in South and Southeast Asia along the Bay of Bengal and the coasts of Indonesia. A notable exception is the tri-spine horseshoe crab, whose range extends northward to the coasts of China, Taiwan, and Southern Japan. The American species lives from the coast of Nova Scotia to the northern Gulf of Mexico, with another population residing around the Yucatán Peninsula. Extant horseshoe crabs generally live in salt water, though one species, the mangrove horseshoe crab (&quot;Carcinoscorpius&quot;) is often found in more brackish environments.

=== Past adaptation to freshwater ===
According to a phylogeny from 2015, now-extinct xiphosurans traveled to freshwater at least five times throughout history. This same transition happened twice in the horseshoe crabs &quot;Victalimulus&quot; and &quot;Limulitella&quot;, with both inhabiting environments such as swamps and rivers.

== Behavior and life history ==

=== Diet ===
Horseshoe crabs primarily eat worms and mollusks living on the ocean floor. They may also feed on crustaceans and even small fish. Foraging usually takes place at night.

=== Locomotion ===

Horseshoe crabs live a primarily benthic lifestyle, preferring to stay at the water&#x27;s bottom. However, they&#x27;re also known to swim. This behavior is widespread in young individuals or those traveling to the shore to breed. Horseshoe crabs swim upside-down with their bodies pointed downwards at an angle. They use their telson as a rudder, changing direction towards where it moved. To swim, the animal&#x27;s retracted legs move to the front of its cephalothorax, extend, and stroke towards the back. This motion happens in unison with the genital operculum and the first three pairs of book gills. While the front appendages reset, the back two book gills perform a smaller stroke.

Horseshoe crabs have a variety of ways to right or flip themselves over. The most common method involves the animal arching its opisthosoma towards the carapace and balancing its telson on the substrate. The animal then moves the telson while beating its legs and gills. This causes the animal to tilt and eventually flip over. Furthermore, horseshoe crabs can right themselves while swimming. This method involves the animal swimming to the bottom, rolling on its side, and touching the bottom with its pusher legs while still in the water column. It has been found that harvesting blood from horshoecrabs drastically impacts their percent daily activity, decreasing their overall movement.

=== Growth and development ===

Baby horseshoe crabs begin their lives as a &quot;trilobite larva&quot;, a name given due to their resemblance to a trilobite. Upon hatching, larva typically measure around long. Their telson is small, and they lack three pairs of book gills. In all other respects, the larvae appear like minuscule adults. Baby horseshoe crabs can swim and burrow in sediment after emerging from their egg.

As the larvae molt into juveniles, their telson gets longer and they gain their missing book gills. Juveniles can attain a carapace width of around in their first year. For each molt, the juvenile will grow about 33% larger. This process continues until the animal reaches its adult size.

When mature, female horseshoe crabs are typically 20–30% larger than males. The smallest species is the mangrove horseshoe crab (&quot;C. rotundicauda&quot;) and the largest is the tri-spine horseshoe crab (&quot;T. tridentatus&quot;).

On average, males of &quot;C. rotundicauda&quot; are about long, including a telson that is about , and a carapace about wide. Some southern populations (in the Yucatán Peninsula) of &quot;L. polyphemus&quot; are somewhat smaller, but otherwise, this species is larger. In the largest species, &quot;T. tridentatus&quot;, females can reach as much as long, including their telson, and up to in weight. This is only about longer than the largest females of &quot;L. polyphemus&quot; and &quot;T. gigas&quot;, but roughly twice the weight.

=== Reproduction ===

During the breeding season (spring and summer in the Northeast US, year-round in warmer locations) horseshoe crabs migrate to shallow coastal waters. Nesting typically happens at high tides around full or new moons. When nesting, they spawn on beaches and salt marshes.

When mating, the smaller male clings to the back or opisthosoma of the larger female using specialized pedipalps. This typically leaves scars, allowing younger females to be easily identified. In the meantime, the female digs a hole in the sediment and lays between 2,000 and 30,000 large eggs. Unusual for arthropods, fertilization is done externally. In most species, procreation is done by both the main and additional &quot;satellite males&quot;. Satellite males surround the main pair and may have some success fertilizing eggs. In &quot;L. polyphemus&quot;, the eggs take about two weeks to hatch with shore birds eating many of them in the process.

Natural breeding of horseshoe crabs in captivity has proven to be difficult. Some evidence indicates that mating takes place only in the presence of the sand or mud in where horseshoe crab eggs have previously hatched. However, it is not known with certainty what the animals sense in the sand, how they sense it, or why they only mate in its presence. In contrast, artificial insemination and induced spawning have been done since the 1980s. Additionally, eggs and juveniles collected from the wild can easily be raised to adulthood in a captive environment.

== Relationship with humans ==

=== Consumption ===

Though they have little meat, horseshoe crabs are valued as a delicacy in some parts of East and Southeast Asia. The meat is white, has a rubbery texture similar to lobster, and possesses a slightly salty aftertaste. Horseshoe crab can be eaten both raw and cooked, but must be properly prepared to prevent food poisoning. Furthermore, only certain species can be eaten. There have been numerous reports of poisonings after consuming mangrove horseshoe crabs (&quot;Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda&quot;) as its meat contains tetrodotoxin.

While horseshoe crab meat is commonly prepared by grilling or stewing, it can also be pickled in vinegar or stir-fried with vegetables. Many recipes involve the use of various spices, herbs, and chilies to give the dish more flavor.

In addition to their meat, horseshoe crabs are valued for their eggs. Much like the meat, only the eggs of specific species can be eaten. The eggs of mangrove horseshoe crabs contain tetrodotoxin and will result in food poisoning if consumed.

=== Use in fisheries ===
In the United States, horseshoe crabs are used as bait to fish for eels, whelk, or conch. Nearly 1 million crabs are harvested yearly for bait in the United States, dwarfing the biomedical mortality. However, fishing with horseshoe crab was banned indefinitely in New Jersey in 2008 with a moratorium on harvesting to protect the red knot, a shorebird that eats the crabs&#x27; eggs. A ban on catching female crabs was put in place in Delaware, and a permanent moratorium is in effect in South Carolina.

=== Use in medicine ===
The blood of a horseshoe crab contains cells known as amebocytes. These play a similar role to the white blood cells of vertebrates in defending the organism against pathogens. Amebocytes from the blood of &quot;Limulus polyphemus&quot; are used to make Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL), which is used for the detection of bacterial endotoxins in medical applications. There is a high demand for blood, the harvest of which involves collecting the animals, bleeding them, and then releasing them back into the sea. Most of the animals survive the process; mortality is correlated with both the amount of blood extracted from an individual animal and the stress experienced during handling and transportation. Estimates of mortality rates following blood harvesting vary from 3–15% to 10–30%. Approximately 500,000 &quot;Limulus&quot; are harvested annually for this purpose.
Bleeding may prevent female horseshoe crabs from being able to spawn or decrease the number of eggs they can lay. According to the biomedical industry, up to 30% of an individual&#x27;s blood is removed. NPR disagrees with this claim, reporting that it &quot;can deplete them of more than half their volume of blue blood&quot;. The horseshoe crabs spend between one and three days away from the ocean before being returned. As long as the gills stay moist, they can survive on land for four days. Some scientists are skeptical that certain companies return their horseshoe crabs to the ocean at all, instead suspecting them of selling the horseshoe crabs as fishing bait.

The harvesting of horseshoe crab blood in the pharmaceutical industry is in decline. In 1986, Kyushu University researchers discovered that the same test could be achieved by using isolated Limulus clotting factor C (rFC), an enzyme found in LAL, as by using LAL itself. Jeak Ling Ding, a National University of Singapore researcher, patented a process for manufacturing rFC; on 8 May 2003, synthetic isolated rFC made via her patented process became available for the first time. Industry at first took little interest in the new product, however, as it was patent-encumbered, not yet approved by regulators, and sold by a single manufacturer, Lonza Group. In 2013, however, Hyglos GmbH also began manufacturing its own rFC product. This, combined with the acceptance of rFC by European regulators, the comparable cost between LAL and rFC, and support from Eli Lilly and Company, which committed to using rFC in lieu of LAL, is projected to all but end the practice of blood harvesting from horseshoe crabs.

Vaccine research and development during the COVID-19 pandemic has added an additional &quot;strain on the American horseshoe crab.&quot; In December 2019, a report of the US Senate which encouraged the Food and Drug Administration to &quot;establish processes for evaluating alternative pyrogenicity tests and report back [to the Senate] on steps taken to increase their use&quot; was released; PETA backed the report.

In June 2020, it was reported that U.S. Pharmacopeia had declined to give rFC equal standing with horseshoe crab blood. Without the approval for the classification as an industry standard testing material, U.S. companies will have to overcome the scrutiny of showing that rFC is safe and effective for their desired uses, which may serve as a deterrent for usage of the horseshoe crab blood substitute.

== Conservation status ==
Development along shorelines is dangerous to horseshoe crab spawning, limiting available space and degrading habitat. Bulkheads can block access to intertidal spawning regions as well.

The population of Indo-Pacific horseshoe crabs (&quot;Tachypleus gigas&quot;) in Malaysia and Indonesia has decreased dramatically since 2010. This is primarily due to overharvesting, as horseshoe crabs are considered a delicacy in countries like Thailand. The individuals most likely to be targeted are gravid females, as they can be sold for both their meat and eggs. This method of harvesting has led to an unbalanced sex ratio in the wild, something that also contributes to the area&#x27;s declining population.

Because of habitat destruction for shoreline development, use in fishing, plastic pollution, status as a culinary delicacy, and use in research and medicine, the horseshoe crab faces both endangered and extinct statuses. One species, the tri-spine horseshoe crab (&quot;Tachypleus tridentatus&quot;), has already been declared locally extinct in Taiwan. Facing a greater than 90% decrease in &quot;T. tridentatus&quot; juveniles, it is suspected that Hong Kong will be the next to declare tri-spine horseshoe crabs as extinct from the area. This species is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List, specifically because of the overexploitation and loss of critical habitat.

To preserve and ensure the continuous supply of horseshoe crabs, a breeding center was built in Johor, Malaysia where animals are bred and released back into the ocean in the thousands once every two years. It is estimated to take around 12 years before they are suitable for consumption.

A low horseshoe crab population in Delaware Bay is hypothesized to endanger the future of the red knot. Red knots, long-distance migratory shorebirds, feed on the protein-rich eggs during their stopovers on the beaches of New Jersey and Delaware. An effort is ongoing to develop adaptive-management plans to regulate horseshoe crab harvests in the bay in a way that protects migrating shorebirds. In 2023, the US Fish and Wildlife Service halted the harvesting of horseshoe crabs in the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, South Carolina, from March 15 to July 15 to aid their reproduction. This decision was influenced by the importance of horseshoe crab eggs as a food source for migratory birds, the ongoing use of horseshoe crabs for bait, and the use of their blood in medical products. The ban supports the conservation goals of the refuge, spanning 66,000 acres (26,700 hectares) of marshes, beaches, and islands near Charleston.

<text>Edith Irene Bailey Baker (November 17, 1901 – April 2, 1994) was an American politician and a United States Representative from Tennessee. She was the widow of Howard Baker Sr. and the stepmother of Howard Baker Jr.

==Biography==
Baker was born in Sevierville, Tennessee, on November 17, 1901, and attended public schools in Sevierville and Maryville.

==Career==
Baker served as Deputy County Court Clerk of Sevier County from 1918 to 1922 and as Deputy Clerk and Master of Chancery Court from 1922 to 1924.

After her first husband&#x27;s death, Baker went to work for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). On September 15, 1935, she married Howard Baker Sr., who was a widower with two children. The couple raised Baker&#x27;s two children from his first marriage, Howard H. Baker Jr. and Mary Elizabeth Baker, as well as a daughter of their own, Beverly Irene Baker. She served on the Republican National Committee from 1960 to 1964.

When her husband died suddenly in office on January 7, 1964, Baker ran as a Republican in the special election to fill the remainder of his term, defeating Democrat Willard Yarbrough, a Knoxville journalist. As a candidate for the seat, she promised to serve only as a caretaker who would not seek further election; and she fulfilled that promise, and served from March 10, 1964, to January 3, 1965. While in Congress, she served on the House Committee on Government Operations and advocated for a balanced federal budget. She also championed coal mining interests, the TVA, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission programs in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and cost of living increases in Social Security pensions. As one of ten Republicans from the South, she voted against the Civil Rights Act.

After leaving Congress in 1965, Baker became Director of Public Welfare in Knoxville, Tennessee, a position she held until 1971.

==Death==
Baker died in Loudon, Tennessee on April 2, 1994 (age 92 years, 136 days). She is interred at Sherwood Memorial Gardens, in Loudon, Tennessee.

<doc id="1093071" wikidata="Q30326666" url="?curid=1093071" title="Milanesa">
<text>The milanesa is a variation of the Lombard veal Milanese, or the Austrian Wiener schnitzel, where generic types of breaded cutlet preparations are known as a &quot;milanesa&quot;.

The &quot;milanesa&quot; was brought to the Southern Cone by Italian immigrants between 1860 and the 1920s. Its name probably reflects an original Milanese preparation, &quot;cotoletta alla milanese,&quot; which is similar to the Austrian Wiener schnitzel.

A milanesa is a thin slice of beef, chicken, fish, veal, or sometimes pork dipped in egg and bread crumbs (or occasionally flour) with seasonings and fried.

==Variations==


Milanesa a la napolitana: Argentina

A milanesa with added tomato paste, mozzarella cheese, and sometimes ham. In the 1940s, in Buenos Aires, &quot;Milanesa a la napolitana&quot; ( and named for José Napoli&#x27;s restaurant&lt;ref name=&quot;Cedrón/Milanesa-Napolitana&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) was first made at a restaurant called Napoli, located near Estadio Luna Park, when a chef covered up a burned milanesa with cheese, ham and tomato.&lt;ref name=&quot;tBA/mN&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The dish is sometimes made out of chicken breast, &quot;suprema napolitana&quot;.

&quot;Milanesa&quot; is a popular dish in Argentina as in Uruguay and has been described as &quot;one of the quintessential Río de la Plata dishes&quot;. They are the legacy of Italian immigrants, who introduced &quot;cotoletta alla milanese&quot; in the late 19th century and early 20th century. During that time, Argentina experienced a huge European immigration wave, with most immigrants coming from Italy. Argentines with Italian lineage is around 60 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;e/argentina-italy-immigrants-food-B-A&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

They are frequently served hot with fried or mashed potatoes; this dish is known as &quot;milanesa con papas fritas&quot; or &quot;milanesa con puré&quot;. In Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay it is often topped with a fried egg, known as &quot;milanesa a caballo&quot; (), but omits the tomato sauce. They are often eaten cold as a sandwich filling, with salad. Mustard and mayonnaise are often used as seasoning. Other common condiments include lemon juice and &quot;salsa golf&quot;.

Chile

&quot;Milanesa Kaiser&quot;, or &quot;escalopa&quot; as it is known in Chile, is a variant (where normal &quot;milanese&quot; are also eaten) reminiscent of cordon bleu or &quot;valdostana&quot;, with a layer of melted cheese between the beef and a layer of ham. A classic Chilean version is called &quot;escalopa a lo pobre&quot;, topped with french fries, sautéed onions and fried eggs, akin to &quot;lomo a lo pobre&quot;.

Mexico—USA

In Mexico and the Southern United States, &quot;milanese&quot; are eaten in some regions, often in a torta (a sandwich made with a &quot;bolillo&quot; or a sandwich roll). In northern Baja California, Sonora, Sinaloa, and Chihuahua (due to U.S. influence), it features lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise like a traditional sandwich, but the &quot;milanesa&quot; is also common in these regions as the main course of a meal. The &quot;milanesa&quot; &quot;memela napolitana&quot; is made with a thick fried tortilla with a &quot;milanesa&quot; on top, with ham, tomato sauce, and grated cheese. In Mexico, &quot;milanesa&quot; usually refers to the preparation method; any type of meat that is pounded thin, breaded, and fried might be referred to as a &quot;milanesa&quot;. In the northern state of Nuevo León, perhaps due to the influence of German and Czech immigrants, the dish known as &quot;milanesa&quot; is extremely popular and stands on its own as a main dish in most restaurants. It is usually served with French fries, refried beans, rice, and a lettuce salad.

Panama

In Panama, they are most commonly made of thinly sliced beef (usually sirloin steak), but also thin chicken fillet. Lime juice is squeezed over them before serving or eating them, and often they are also seasoned with hot sauce. They are eaten with white rice and other side dishes such as salad, lentils, or beans. The latter two are poured over the rice, as they are usually served in Panama while the salad is served off to the side where space is still left on the plate. When served as sandwiches, they are known as &quot;emparedado de milanesa&quot; or &quot;sandwich de milanesa&quot; when tomatoes, onions, lettuce, ketchup, or American cheese (&quot;queso amarillo&quot; i.e. yellow cheese) are added. &quot;Pan de molde&quot; (sandwich bread) and &quot;pan flauta&quot; (a Panamanian type of baguette that is thicker and softer) are the types of bread used to make these sandwiches.

Philippines

In the Philippines, &quot;milanesa&quot; is known as &quot;carne frita&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;bistek&quot;, which is also called &quot;carne frita&quot; in the Philippines), and is cooked in much the same way as described above (meat pounded until thin, flour, egg, breadcrumbs, fried). Admittedly, it is not as popular in the country as it is in South America, and it is served mainly in people&#x27;s homes, not in restaurants. The families who do eat it usually serve &quot;milanesa/carne frita&quot; with white rice, a bean stew of some sort (for instance, white beans with a dark leafy green; also &quot;fabada&quot;), sometimes an American-style potato salad with cut green beans added, and often, chili ketchup or a mayo-ketchup mixed sauce not unlike the Argentine &quot;salsa golf&quot;. It is almost never served as a sandwich.

Poland

The Polish variety of &quot;milanesa&quot; is commonly known as &quot;kotlet schabowy&quot;, which is pork loin pounded with a mallet until it becomes thinner and soft, then coated with flour, beaten egg and breadcrumbs and pan-fried. Also, &quot;kotlet drobiowy&quot; is made of chicken or turkey and prepared in a similar way, and &quot;kotlet wolowy&quot; is made of beef steak, pounded, soaked in milk for a few hours to tenderize the meat and then coated in flour, beaten egg, and bread crumbs. Polish &quot;kotlet&quot; is traditionally served with cooked or mashed potatoes, fries, Silesian dumplings, &quot;sszałot&quot;, or rice. Typically, side dishes are traditional Polish salads such as &quot;mizeria&quot;, thinly grated carrot salad, &quot;Ćwikła&quot;, or a traditional Polish &quot;surówka&quot;. The history of the Polish &quot;kotlet&quot; dates back to the 19th century.

<doc id="1093073" wikidata="Q19430" url="?curid=1093073" title="Xiphosura">
<text>Xiphosura (; , in reference to its sword-like telson) is an order of arthropods related to arachnids. They are more commonly known as horseshoe crabs (a name applied more specifically to the only extant family, Limulidae). They first appeared in the Hirnantian (Late Ordovician). Currently, there are only four living species. Xiphosura contains one suborder, Xiphosurida, and several stem-genera.

The group has hardly changed in appearance in hundreds of millions of years; the modern horseshoe crabs look almost identical to prehistoric genera and are considered to be living fossils. The most notable difference between ancient and modern forms is that the abdominal segments in present species are fused into a single unit in adults.

Xiphosura were historically placed in the class Merostomata, although this term was intended to encompass also the eurypterids, whence it denoted what is now thought to be an unnatural (paraphyletic) group (although this is a grouping recovered in some recent cladistic analyses). Although the name Merostomata is still seen in textbooks, without reference to the Eurypterida, some have urged that this usage should be discouraged. The Merostomata label originally did &quot;not&quot; include Eurypterida, although they were added in as a better understanding of the extinct group evolved. Now Eurypterida is classified within Sclerophorata together with the arachnids, and therefore, Merostomata is now a synonym of Xiphosura. Several recent phylogenomic studies place Xiphosura within Arachnida, often as the sister group of Ricinulei; included among them are taxonomically comprehensive analyses of both morphology and genomes, which have recovered Merostomata as a derived clade of arachnids.

==Description==
Modern xiphosurans reach up to in adult length, but the Paleozoic species were often far smaller, some as small as long.

Their bodies are divided into an anterior prosoma and a posterior opisthosoma, or abdomen. The upper surface of the prosoma is covered by a semicircular carapace, while the underside bears five pairs of walking legs and a pair of pincer-like chelicerae. The mouth is located on underside of the center of the prosoma, between the bases of the walking legs, and lies behind a lip-like structure called the labrum. The exoskeleton consist of a tough cuticle, but do not contain any crystalline biominerals. Like scorpions, xiphosurans have an exocuticular layer of hyaline which exhibits UV fluorescence.

Xiphosurans have up to four eyes, located in the carapace. Two compound eyes are on the side of the prosoma, with one or two median ocelli towards the front. The compound eyes are simpler in structure than those of other arthropods, with the individual ommatidia not being arranged in a compact pattern. They can probably detect movement, but are unlikely to be able to form a true image. In front of the ocelli is an additional organ that probably functions as a chemoreceptor.

The first four pairs of legs end in pincers, and have a series of spines, called the gnathobase, on the inner surface. The spines are used to masticate the food, tearing it up before passing it to the mouth. The fifth and final pair of legs, however, has no pincers or spines, instead having structures for cleaning the gills and pushing mud out of the way while burrowing. Behind the walking legs is a sixth set of appendages, the chilaria, which are greatly reduced in size and covered in hairs and spines. These are thought to be vestiges of the limbs of an absorbed first opisthosomal segment.

The opisthosoma is divided into a forward mesosoma, with flattened appendages, and a metasoma at the rear, which has no appendages. In modern forms, the whole of the opisthosoma is fused into a single unsegmented structure. The underside of the opisthosoma carries the genital openings and five pairs of flap-like gills.

The opisthosoma terminates in a long caudal spine, commonly referred to as a telson (though this same term is also used for a different structure in crustaceans). The spine is highly mobile, and is used to push the animal upright if it is accidentally turned over.

===Internal anatomy===
The mouth opens into a sclerotised oesophagus, which leads to a crop and gizzard. After grinding up its food in the gizzard, the animal regurgitates any inedible portions, and passes the remainder to the true stomach. The stomach secretes digestive enzymes, and is attached to an intestine and two large caeca that extend through much of the body, and absorb the nutrients from the food. The intestine terminates in a sclerotised rectum, which opens just in front of the base of the caudal spine.

Xiphosurans have well-developed circulatory systems, with numerous arteries that send blood from the long tubular heart to the body tissues, and then to two longitudinal sinuses next to the gills. After being oxygenated, the blood flows into the body cavity, and back to the heart. The blood contains haemocyanin, a blue copper-based pigment performing the same function as haemoglobin in vertebrates, and also has blood cells that aid in clotting.

The excretory system consists of two pairs of coxal glands connected to a bladder that opens near the base of the last pair of walking legs. The brain is relatively large, and, as in many arthropods, surrounds the oesophagus. In both sexes, the single gonad lies next to the intestine and opens on the underside of the opisthosoma.

==Reproduction==
Xiphosurans move to shallow water to mate. The male climbs onto the back of the female, gripping her with his first pair of walking legs. The female digs out a depression in the sand, and lays from 200 to 300 eggs, which the male covers with sperm. The pair then separates, and the female buries the eggs.

The egg is about across. Inside the egg, the embryo goes through four molts before it hatches into a larva, often called a &#x27;trilobite larva&#x27; due to its superficial resemblance to a trilobite. At this stage it has no telson yet, and the larva is lecithotrophic (non-feeding) and planktonic, subsisting on the maternal yolk before settling to the bottom to molt, after which the telson first appears. Through a series of successive moults, the larva develops additional gills, increases the length of its caudal spine, and gradually assumes the adult form. Modern xiphosurans reach sexual maturity after about three years of growth.

== Evolutionary history ==

The oldest known stem-Xiphosuran, &quot;Lunataspis,&quot; is known from the late Ordovician of Canada, around 445 million years ago. No xiphosurans are known from the following Silurian. Xiphosurida first appears during the late Devonian. A major radiation of freshwater xiphosurids, the Belinuridae is known from the Carboniferous, with the oldest representatives of the modern family Limulidae also possibly appearing during this time, though they only appear in abundance during the Triassic. Another major radiation of freshwater xiphosurans, the Austrolimulidae, is known from the Permian and Triassic. As a group they have never showed much diversity in regard of species. Less than 50 fossil species are known from the Carboniferous period, when they were at their most diverse. The last common ancestor of modern limulids has been suggested to date to the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary based on molecular clock dating though depending on phylogeny the fossil record may suggest a split as old as the Triassic.

<text>Fort Gilkicker is a historic Palmerston fort built at the eastern end of Stokes Bay, Gosport, Hampshire England to dominate the key anchorage of Spithead. It was erected between 1863 and 1871 as a semi-circular arc with 22 casemates, to be armed with five twelve-inch guns, seventeen ten-inch guns and five nine-inch guns. The actual installed armament rather differed from this. In 1902 the RML guns were replaced by two 9.2-inch and two six-inch BL guns, and before the First World War the walls were further strengthened with substantial earthwork embankments. The fort was disarmed in 1956 and used for storage until 1999. On 28th July 2022, the fort was sold at auction for just under £1.4M and planning has been granted for 26 homes. Since then a massive restoration project has been underway.

==Layout==

Each of the twenty two gun casemates on the main gun floor consists of a brick vaulted chamber behind a granite face fourteen feet thick. Each gun fired though an armoured embrasure with a shield hung on a massive shield frame. To the rear of each gun casemate is the barrack room for the gun crew with space for folding barrack room beds and a fireplace. The barrack rooms open on to a verandah, or walkway, that connects all of the barrack rooms. Beneath the gun casemates are a series of magazines appropriated for shells and cartridges. Vertical lifts from the shell and cartridge passages open onto each gun casemate allowing efficient supply of ammunition for the guns. The magazine floor was lit by oil lamps placed on lamp trolleys running on rails through lamp tunnels from the parade. Steps lead up from the verandah and parade to the upper battery that consisted of five large open gun emplacements with expense magazines between. The rear, or gorge, of the fort is closed by a two-storey barrack block that was originally occupied by the officers. It included Officer&#x27;s bedrooms, the officers’ mess with kitchen and pantry, a field officer&#x27;s quarters, and officer&#x27;s servant&#x27;s quarters. At each end was an artillery store. At the western end was the laboratory for filling shells and cartridges. The entrance to the fort through the centre of the barrack block opens onto the central parade. Outside the fort is an artillery store and a smith and fitters shop.

==History==
===Original battery (1853-1863)===
The first fortifications on Gilkicker Point were constructed as an auxiliary battery to Fort Monckton and consisted of an earthen rampart for eleven guns firing through embrasures cut through the parapets. The battery was a distorted quadrilateral in shape with a long gorge (or rear) a short sea facing rampart with two flanking faces. The front faces were protected by a ditch which was flanked by musketry caponiers at the angles. The rear was closed off by a brick wall with a barrack for officers at its centre. The battery was heavily criticised by James Fergusson, who eventually became the Treasury representative on the Royal Commission in to the defences of the United Kingdom, set up in 1859. In his paper ‘The Peril of Portsmouth’ he stated that the battery was in danger of collapse under the weight of its own guns and could easily be captured by a small force landing in the bay as it could offer little resistance. As a result, the Defence Committee proposed a new work to replace it.

===Construction (1863-1871)===
The current Fort Gilkicker was constructed between the years 1863 and 1869 at Stokes Bay, Gosport. Its purpose was to defend the deep water anchorage at Spithead and to protect the western approach to Portsmouth harbour. The fort was begun by a contractor who failed in November 1863 early in the stages of the construction and a renowned civil engineer, John Towlerton Leather who was already involved in the construction of the great sea forts at nearby Spithead, was asked to complete the Fort at Gilkicker. His yard was nearby at Stokes Bay, the site of which eventually became the Stokes Bay Submarine Mining Establishment. 
The new Fort Gilkicker was conceived as a curvilinier fort for twenty six guns on one level firing through armoured embrasures with a barrack closing the rear. It faced in a more easterly direction that its predecessor and its principal role was to direct fire on Sturbridge Shoal and to the flanks were to bear upon Spithead and Stokes Bay. The design for the fort was altered slightly and it was completed in 1871 for twenty two guns in casemates with five heavier guns in open positions on the roof. The estimated cost of Fort Gilkicker in 1869 was £61,395, the actual cost on completion being £58,766.

===First version (1871-1906)===
The approved armament was:- seventeen 10-inch R.M.L. 18 tons Lower tier casemates; five 9-inch R.M.L. 12 tons Lower tier casemates. Five gun positions were constructed in the upper battery, three for 11-inch guns of 25 tons on ‘C’ pivots in positions 2, 3 and 4 and two for 12-inch guns of 25 tons on ‘A’ pivots in positions 1 and 5. The site was used for milita training in 1871, and submarine mining experiments in 1879. Additional guns were added through the 1880s. In 1891 two of the positions for 11-inch guns on the roof were altered as lookout and the guns removed.

===Second version (1906-1956)===

In 1898 Colonel Montgomery recommended that Gilkicker be modified to take the latest Breech Loading guns in place of the 10-inch and 9-inch RMLs on the lower gun floor. The upper battery was to be completely remodelled to take two of the latest 9.2-inch BL Mark X guns on barbette V mountings with two 6-inch BL Mark VII guns on CPII mountings for closer range support. The 9.2-inch BL was to counter Armoured ships up to a range of 6,000 yards whilst the 6-inch BL was for use against unarmoured ships, ships attempting to block channels by sinking in them and against ships trying to break through booms (blockers and boom smashers). The authority for the alteration was given in 1902. The work was completed in October 1906 at an estimated cost of £16,000 and an actual cost of £19,671. The contractor was William Hill of Gosport. The work included the rebuilding of the magazines, gun emplacements and barrack block. The magazines were altered to accommodate 1000 6-inch B.L. shells and cartridges and 500 9.2-inch BL shells and 1,000 cartridges. As part of this work the whole of the exterior granite wall of the fort was covered with earth and the front ditch filed to protect the shell and cartridge stores. Position finding cells were built into this bank at each end of the fort. each worked in conjunction with a transmitting station exterior to the fort, that for the 6-inch guns at Fort Monckton and that for the 9.2inch guns at No.4 battery of the Stokes Bay Lines.

The Owen Committee decided in 1905 that the heavy armament of Gilkicker, Stokes Bay and Browndown were only of use against ships that had forced the outer defences and such ships would be deterred by the inevitable damage they would incur. The 9.2-inch guns at Gilkicker and Browndown were therefore superfluous. The 6-inch guns at Gilkicker and at No.2 battery of the Stokes Bay Lines were also superfluous and ineffective. These guns were to be removed. A 1906 armament return shows that the 9.2 inch and 6-inch guns were still mounted but to be reduced. Corrections to August 1907 show them as dismounted. The barrack block was altered 1908-1910 by converting it to married quarters for Royal Engineers at nearby Fort Monckton. In 1916 the fort was armed with an early type of Anti-Aircraft gun, a 3-inch Quick Fire gun on a high angle mounting. This was placed in the eastern 9.2inch B.L. position on top of the fort. Trinity House had a small observation post on Fort Gilkicker after 1939.

During World War II the fort was briefly armed with a 40mm Bofors gun and Gun Laying Radar was fitted outside the fort to direct the guns of the nearby Gilkicker Anti-Aircraft gun site. In the build-up to D-day a signals unit occupied the fort and during the Normandy landings on 9 June over 1,000 signals were recorded for the day needing routing to over 1300 addresses. Later an average of 800 signals to almost 1,000 addresses were routed via Gilkicker. The fort was the site of artillery exercises in 1953.

===Later use (1956-1999)===
In 1956 Coast Defence was abolished and the fort was then used by the Ministry of Public Building and Works as a plumbers workshop. Later a substantial wooden signalling station was built on top of the fort, which was continuously manned by former RN Signalmen, and used to monitor movements of vessels and assist in RN signalling training. Vessels transiting The Solent in the vicinity could also check their compass errors using the nearby navigational transit towers of Gilkicker and Kickergil. The fort was used by &quot;HMS Dolphin&quot;, based at Fort Blockhouse as storage for Submarine spares from 1959, with Fort Brockhurst staff maintaining it. The adjacent beach was closed to the public during this period.

In November 1986 Hampshire County Council bought the fort, but not its surrounding earth bank. The fort was used as a building materials store from 1987 until 1999.

===Disuse (1999-present)===

The Phoenix Trust proposed to convert the fort to apartments in 1999, but pulled out in 2001. A similar redevelopment scheme was posited by Try Homes from 2003 to 2006, and Assett Hawk from 2007 to 2012. The latter did engage in some work on the site clearing overgrowth in 2012, but none of the schemes came to fruition. In 2016, the fort was earmarked for restoration and conversion to modern apartments by Fort Gilkicker Developments Ltd, and work began on site with the erection of a fence, however these plans were again dropped in 2018 due to financial issues, and the fort was put on sale again in November 2019 with a guide price of 5 to 5.5 million pounds.

On 28 July 2022, it was sold to developers for £1.38 million, with plans to turn it into 26 homes - 22 in the former gun emplacements and 4 larger ones in the barrack block.

It is a Grade II* Listed Building and on the Buildings at Risk Register, but is currently in extremely poor condition due to a lack of maintenance and numerous break-ins. An urban explorer took a series of photographs of the interior in 2016, demonstrating the scale of the damage. The site suffered a major fire in March 2019.

<text>Jerry Holland (February 23, 1955 – July 16, 2009) was a musician and fiddler who lived on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, Canada.

He was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, United States to Canadian parents – his father was from New Brunswick and his mother was from Quebec. During his childhood, Holland was exposed to the music of the large Cape Breton expatriate community in Boston. He began to play the fiddle and step-dance at the age of five, and played at his first square dance at the age of six. He made his television debut in 1962 on the Canadian program &quot;Don Messer&#x27;s Jubilee&quot;. By the time he was ten years old, he was playing regularly at dances in the Boston area. Holland&#x27;s family made annual summer trips to Cape Breton, and he moved there permanently in 1975.

In his early 20s, Holland performed with the Cape Breton Symphony, a group of fiddlers that included Winston &quot;Scotty&quot; Fitzgerald, Angus Chisholm, Joe Cormier, Wilfred Gillis and John Donald Cameron. The group appeared regularly on CBC television on &quot;The John Allan Cameron Show&quot; and other programs. From playing with these much older and more experienced musicians, Holland gained an appreciation for the traditional style of Cape Breton fiddle music, as well as a repertoire of over a thousand fiddle tunes.

Holland released his first, self-titled album in 1976. It was his second album, &quot;Master Cape Breton Fiddler&quot; (1982, re-released on CD in 2001), that made his reputation as a ground-breaking musician. Accompanied by Dave MacIsaac on guitar and Hilda Chiasson on piano, Holland pioneered a new, more modern sound for Cape Breton music on this album, while still remaining firmly within the Cape Breton tradition. &quot;Master Cape Breton Fiddler&quot; was a major influence on younger Cape Breton fiddlers such as Howie MacDonald.

Holland released thirteen albums and appeared as a guest musician on over 25 more. He published two collections of fiddle tunes: &quot;Jerry Holland&#x27;s Collection of Fiddle Tunes&quot; and &quot;Jerry Holland&#x27;s Second Collection of Fiddle Tunes&quot;, both edited by Paul Cranford. He was also noted as a composer of fiddle tunes, most famously &quot;Brenda Stubbert&#x27;s Reel&quot; (named for his friend and fellow Cape Breton fiddler Brenda Stubbert) and &quot;My Cape Breton Home&quot;.

Holland died on July 16, 2009, from cancer.

<doc id="1093081" wikidata="Q7838189" url="?curid=1093081" title="Penryn Campus">
<text>Penryn Campus (formerly Tremough Campus, Cornwall Campus and similar names) is a university campus in Penryn, Cornwall, England, UK. The campus is occupied by two university institutions: Falmouth University and the University of Exeter, with the shared buildings, facilities and services provided by Falmouth Exeter Plus.

Located on a site bought in 1998, the campus was developed via the Combined Universities in Cornwall (CUC) scheme with finance from the EU and the UK Government and was opened in 2004.

==History==
The site was a convent school for the local community which was bought in 1998 by Falmouth College of Arts, as it was then known. Tremough Convent School educated girls aged 3–18 and closed 31 July 1998. The Universities of Exeter and Plymouth both expressed an interest in the project. The University of Plymouth later withdrew, leaving University of Exeter in partnership with Falmouth University: the site is held on a 125-year lease. The campus was developed as part of the Combined Universities in Cornwall (CUC) initiative and was officially opened in 2004. The bulk of the investment in the campus derived from European Union Objective One funding, matched by UK Government funding provided through the South West Regional Development Agency (SWRDA).
In 2011 as part of Phase II of developments on Tremough Campus, the name of the campus was changed to &quot;University Campus Tremough&quot;. In 2012 Tremough Campus Services, the charity formed by Falmouth University and the University of Exeter to manage university activities in the Falmouth and Penryn area, changed its name to Falmouth Exeter Plus. The shared campus was officially opened for the 2004/5 academic year as &quot;CUC Tremough Campus.&quot;

In 2013, with the continued growth of the University of Exeter and the recent inauguration of Falmouth University, further discussions were undertaken in how the now three university campuses in Cornwall (Treliske in Truro, Tremough in Penryn and Woodlane in Falmouth) would be represented. On 18 July 2013, University Campus Tremough changed its name to &quot;Penryn Campus&quot; in line with the already adopted Truro and Falmouth campuses.

The student population on the campus is around 6,000.

==Academic facilities==

===Major departments===
The campus is the home of Camborne School of Mines and the Institute of Cornish Studies, both of which are departments of the University of Exeter.

The Environment and Sustainability Institute (ESI) is a £30 million research centre with a remit to find solutions to problems of environmental change. It has three research themes: clean technologies, natural environment, and social science and sustainability. It was officially opened in April 2013, and houses over 140 researchers, professors, lecturers and PhD students. Professor Juliet Osborne (Chair of Applied Ecology at the ESI) succeeded Kevin Gaston as Director of the ESI in May 2017.

===Buildings===
The four-storey Daphne du Maurier building houses teaching facilities that include science and engineering laboratories, IT facilities, library and lecture and seminar rooms. Falmouth University&#x27;s Design Centre occupies much of the south of the building, while most of the top floor is used by University of Exeter&#x27;s Centre for Ecology and Conservation and Camborne School of Mines.

An extension of the building&#x27;s library, lecture facilities and relocation of the career offices, collectively known as The Exchange was completed on the north-east side of the current building for the 2012/13 academic year. The endeavour is to support expected growth from 3,500 to 5,000 students on the campus. In 2016 a new sports centre, gym and nursery was opened.

The Peter Lanyon building, located between the Daphne du Maurier building and Block I of Glasney Parc is a zig-zag-shaped building housing further lecture, seminar and study facilities (particularly for University of Exeter&#x27;s humanities subjects taught at the campus), and containing University College Falmouth&#x27;s Photography Centre and having a link corridor to the older Media Centre.

The Performance Centre, now known as The Academy of Music and Theatre Arts, was completed in Summer 2010 at the south of the campus and is predominantly a facility for the subjects formerly taught at the Dartington College of Arts, following the move of Dartington College of Arts to Falmouth from Totnes, Devon, in 2004. Two further buildings were completed for the 2012/13 academic year: The Environmental and Sustainability Institute at the very top of the campus, and the Academy for Innovation and Research towards the northern entrance. Both of these are predominantly research buildings for Exeter and Falmouth respectively.
The original Tremough House which had been owned by the Foxe family, is used as administrative offices and further seminar space in addition to being the offices of the English department, whilst the old chapel has been converted into a lecture theatre. The walled Italianate gardens and orchard between Tremough House and the Performance Centre are still intact and well maintained, with the annual FXU end of year Garden party held in these gardens.

The Tremough Innovation Centre is a three-storey building on land acquired by Cornwall Council adjacent to the Campus. It provides resources for new and existing businesses. The building opened in January 2012 and it is managed by University of Plymouth, which also manages a similar innovation centre in Pool.

==Services==
With differing academic emphasis, but with an obvious need to provide student accommodation and non-academic staff for the smooth running of the campus facilities, the two universities collectively established the charity Tremough Campus Services. It is responsible for the overall maintenance of the site including the gymnasium, catering services, bars, shops and the student accommodation with profits going back to the two institutions. The charity also manages services on University College Falmouth&#x27;s Woodlane Campus and further accommodation at Tuke House in Falmouth which was opened in 2006. From 2012/13 the organisation was renamed to &quot;Falmouth Exeter Plus&quot; with a new logo and website.

==Accommodation==
Campus accommodation is at the student village made up of Glasney Parc, where there are 800 en-suite study bedrooms with shared kitchens in twelve 2–3 storey buildings (A Block to O Block), and Glasney View, where there are 600 further rooms of similar facility in 14 3 storey buildings (VA Block to VN Block). Most general accommodation related services such as collection of postal packages and report of accommodation faults are dealt with in &#x27;Glasney Lodge&#x27; (Formerly the Porter&#x27;s Lodge) located towards the top of the student village opposite Glasney Parc&#x27;s K-O blocks.

An accommodation strategy was compiled in November 2010 with the aim to expand university accommodation outside the campus to accommodate a forecast growth of 800 new students between September 2011 and September 2015. Construction commenced in August 2011 of new student accommodation suitable for up to 233 new students adjacent to Penryn Railway Station, around 10 minutes walk from Tremough Campus, and another five blocks of on-campus accommodation were under construction providing an extra 224 rooms. Both developments were expected to be completed in time for the 2012/13 academic year. For the first time in 2012/13 a limited amount of accommodation, both on campus and at Penryn Station, was made available to returning students further into their degrees than first year.

==Student activities==
The students&#x27; union on site, referred to as the SU (Falmouth and Exeter Students&#x27; Union), provides student representation across all aspects of the campus. They are represented at the highest levels of decision making on the campus. In addition to its representative role, the SU is also responsible for putting on the annual Freshers&#x27; Fortnight program of events for new students, as well as many other events throughout the academic year.

Social life on campus centres around a building known as the Stannary. The Lower Stannary is used as a restaurant during the day and is the venue for any larger events on campus; the Upper Stannary is a mezzanine recreational area. The entire Stannary plays host to many Freshers&#x27; Fortnight events, as well as various nights throughout the year. &quot;Koofi,&quot; a new cafe situated on the back of the Porter&#x27;s Lodge building in Glasney Parc, opened to students in October 2010.

There is a wide range of sports and recreation activities available to students, ranging from Hockey and Football to Musical Theatre and Bee Keeping. SU activities are open to all University College Falmouth and University of Exeter in Cornwall students whether they are based at the Tremough or Falmouth University&#x27;s Woodlane Campus away. Some of the sports teams are run under the Camborne School of Mines name despite players not being exclusively CSM or University of Exeter students.

<text>The Martinique national football team () represents the French overseas department and region of Martinique in international football. The team is controlled by the Ligue de Football de la Martinique (), a local branch of French Football Federation (). The association is not a member of the world governing body FIFA. On 7 August 2010, the team adopted the nickname &quot;Les Matinino&quot;, which pays tribute to the history of the island.

==Overview==
As an overseas department of the French Republic, Martinique is not a member of FIFA and is therefore not eligible to enter the FIFA World Cup or any competition organised first-hand by the organisation. Martiniquais, being French citizens, are eligible to play for the France national football team. Martinique is, however, a member of CONCACAF and CFU and is eligible for all competitions organised by either organisation. Indeed, according to the status of the FFF (article 34, paragraph 6): &quot;[...]Under the control of related continental confederations, and with the agreement of the FFF, those leagues can organize international sport events at a regional level or set up teams in order to participate to them.&quot;

Martinique&#x27;s highest honour to date was winning the Caribbean Cup in 1993. Martinique also was a two-time winner of the CFU Championship, a precursor to the Caribbean Cup. A more recent success was winning the 2010 Coupe de l&#x27;Outre-Mer. The team defeated Réunion 5–3 on penalties to claim the title. The Martinique team has participated in three CONCACAF Gold Cups and its best finish in the competition was in 2002 when the team reached the quarterfinals where they lost to Canada 6–5 on penalties.

<doc id="1093090" wikidata="Q2010136" url="?curid=1093090" title="New Sabah Times">
<text>The New Sabah Times is a newspaper in Sabah, Malaysia. The Sabah Times commenced publication on 21 January 1953, published by Donald Stephens (later Tun Fuad Stephens) and had a daily circulation of approximately 1000. It was the only English-language daily newspaper. The North Borneo News, first published in 1948 in Sandakan was a fortnightly, then weekly periodical with a circulation of approximately 750. It mainly reported Advisory Council news, excerpts from other newspapers and some local and overseas news. Donald Stephens was a reporter for the publication. It began publishing daily in April 1954 but soon amalgamated with the Sabah Times later in 1954 under joint editorship. It included a page of romanised Malay and Dusun to give it wider appeal and increased its circulation.

In March 1995, the newspaper shut down. In March 1998, the newspaper was acquired by Inna Kinabalu Sdn Bhd. and revived as the &quot;New Sabah Times&quot;. In late December, the newspaper&#x27;s management announced that the &quot;New Sabah Times&quot; was shutting down due to declining circulation and advertising revenue.

== History ==
The Sabah Times commenced publication on 21 January 1953, published by Donald Stephens (later Tun Fuad Stephens), and made possible with $1000 given to him by his brother Ben, and had a daily circulation of approximately 1000. It was the first English-language daily newspaper in British North Borneo. Donald Stephens later became the first Chief Minister when Sabah gained its independence from British and joined Malaysia on 16 September, 1963.

The &quot;Sabah Times&quot; first shut down on 24 March 1995. The newspaper was revived as the &quot;New Sabah Times&quot; on 8 March 1998 after being bought by the publishing company Inna Kinabalu Sdn. Bhd. For a time, the newspaper was regarded as one of the fastest growing newspapers in Sabah. While the newspaper was primarily an English-language publication, it also had Malay and Kadazandusun language editions. The newspaper relied on print subscriptions but also had an electronic paper edition.

On 8 December 2020, the newspaper announced that it would be closing down on 20 December, which was later moved to 31 December 2020. With the closure of the &quot;New Sabah Times&quot;, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and the Sarawak–based &quot;The Borneo Post&quot; remain the only English-language newspapers in Sabah.

<doc id="1093094" wikidata="Q4954533" url="?curid=1093094" title="Bradfield Scheme">
<text>The Bradfield Scheme, a proposed Australian water diversion scheme, is an inland irrigation project that was designed to irrigate and drought-proof much of the western Queensland interior, as well as large areas of South Australia. It was devised by Dr John Bradfield (1867–1943), a Queensland born civil engineer, who also designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Brisbane&#x27;s Story Bridge.

The scheme that Bradfield proposed in 1938 required large pipes, tunnels, pumps and dams. It involved diverting water from the upper reaches of the Tully, Herbert and Burdekin rivers. These Queensland rivers are fed by the monsoon, and flow east to the Coral Sea. It was proposed that the water would enter the Thomson River on the western side of the Great Dividing Range and eventually flow south west to Lake Eyre. An alternative plan was to divert water into the Flinders River.

G. W. Leeper of the school of agricultural science at the University of Melbourne considered the plan to be lacking in scientific justification.

In 1981, a Queensland NPA subcommittee proposed a variation of the scheme.

==Possible benefits==

The water was expected to provide irrigation for more than of agricultural land in Queensland. The scheme would reduce the massive natural erosion problems in areas of Central Queensland. The scheme had the ability to generate of power and the potential to double that amount.

It is claimed that extra water and vegetation in the interior may then produce changes to the climate of Australia, however various studies have concluded that this is unlikely. This may increase the rainfall in areas of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Extra rainfall may drought-proof Eastern Queensland, and thereby improve river inflows to the Murray-Darling River system. It is claimed that a full Lake Eyre would moderate the air temperature in the region by the absorption of sunlight by the water instead of heat radiation from dry land into the air. No evidence to support the theory that an inland sea would increase rainfall has ever been produced, nor have any of the other claims been supported. 

It would provide large areas suitable for the production of algae fuel, a type of biofuel. The catchment area of the Herbert River holds a population of approximately 18,000, 75% of whom dwell in the lower flood plain area. Diverting some water from this river would reduce the risk of flood.

==Objections==
Bradfield&#x27;s scheme and others have been criticised because they are not practical. This scheme has been criticised because of the high capital and ongoing running costs which would make the project uneconomical. Former Minister for Agriculture and Drought David Littleproud opposed the scheme saying it was outdated and discredited.

Elevation measurements were taken with a barometer, leading to inaccuracies in land heights and mistakes in the proposal. In most cases no flow record of the rivers were available to Bradfield. He used an empirical formula which assumed 33% of the water flow would be lost to evaporation and seepage. The estimated water available for the scheme was .

The extreme evaporation rate in the interior is another negative determinant. No clear evidence has been provided that the amount of water supplied would exceed the evaporation rate. The reduction in river discharge to the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon may diminish coastal fisheries by reducing the supply of terrestrial organic matter to the coastal and estuarine environment.

In 1947, W.H.R. Nimmo conducted a critical review of the scheme. He proved that Bradfield&#x27;s estimates of the amount of water available from the easterly flowing rivers were about two and half times greater than it actually was. The error was attributed to the methodology used to calculate flow estimates which was based on German rivers where the average temperature was much less than in northern Australia.

A 2022 CSIRO investigation found the scheme to be completely unviable due to a lack of reliable water.

==Support==

The Bradfield Scheme has not received broad political support from any of the major Australian parties in recent times, but it has been pushed by individual politicians such as Bob Katter, who advocated the plan whilst he was a member of the Nationals for the state seat of Flinders during the 1980s, and continues to support it as an independent, representing the federal seat of Kennedy. In February 2007, the then Queensland Premier Peter Beattie urged the Federal Government to look at a modern version, saying it is better to find more water than to cut back on current supplies. However, Beattie preferred desalination.

In May 2019, former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce and Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation party expressed support for the scheme. 

In November 2019, the Liberal National Party of Queensland, through the opposition leader Deb Frecklington, provided support of the project as a long term investment.

<doc id="1093105" wikidata="Q290524" url="?curid=1093105" title="Cicely Saunders">
<text>Dame Cicely Mary Strode Saunders (22 June 1918 – 14 July 2005) was an English nurse, social worker, physician and writer. She is noted for her work in terminal care research and her role in the birth of the hospice movement, emphasising the importance of palliative care in modern medicine, and opposing the legalisation of voluntary euthanasia.

==Early life and education==
Saunders was born in Barnet, Hertfordshire, to Philip Gordon Saunders, a chartered surveyor and landowner, and to Mary Christian Knight. She had two younger brothers, John Frederick Stacey Saunders and Christopher Gordon Strode Saunders.

After attending Roedean School (1932–37), Saunders began studying politics, philosophy, and economics at St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1938. During the war, she decided to become a nurse and trained at Nightingale School of Nursing based at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital from 1940 to 1944. Returning to St Anne&#x27;s College after a back injury in 1944, she took a BA in 1945, qualifying as a medical social worker in 1947 and eventually trained as a doctor at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital Medical School (now merged to form King&#x27;s College London GKT School of Medical Education) and qualified MBBS in 1957.

==Relationships==
In 1948, Saunders fell in love with a patient, Ela Majer &quot;David&quot; Tasma, a Polish-Jewish refugee who, having escaped from the Warsaw Ghetto, worked as a waiter; he was dying of cancer. He bequeathed her £500 () to be &quot;a window in your home&quot;. This donation, which helped germinate the idea that would become St Christopher&#x27;s Hospice, Sydenham, London, is memorialized with a plain sheet of glass at the hospice&#x27;s entrance.

While training for social work, she holidayed with some Christians and was converted to Christianity. In the late 1940s, Saunders began working part-time at St Luke&#x27;s Home for the Dying Poor in Bayswater, and it was partly this which, in 1951, led her to begin studying to become a physician.

==Hospice==
A year later, she began working at St Joseph&#x27;s Hospice, a Catholic establishment in Hackney, East London, where she would remain for seven years, researching pain control. There she met a second Pole, Antoni Michniewicz, a patient with whom she fell in love. His death, in 1960, coincided with the death of Saunders&#x27;s father in 1961, and another friend, and put her into what she later called a state of &quot;pathological grieving&quot;. But she had already decided to set up her own hospice, serving cancer patients, and said that Michniewicz&#x27;s death had shown her that &quot;as the body becomes weaker, so the spirit becomes stronger&quot;.

Saunders said that after 11 years of thinking about the project, she had drawn up a comprehensive plan and sought finance after reading Psalm 37: &quot;Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.&quot; She succeeded in engaging the support of Albertine Winner, the deputy chief medical officer at the Ministry of Health at the time. Later, as Dame Albertine Winner, she served as chair of St Christopher&#x27;s. In 1965, Saunders was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

In 1967, St Christopher&#x27;s Hospice, the world&#x27;s first purpose-built hospice, was established. The hospice was founded on the principles of combining teaching and clinical research, expert pain and symptom relief with holistic care to meet the physical, social, psychological and spiritual needs of its patients and those of their family and friends. St Christopher&#x27;s Hospice was developed based on a care philosophy that &quot;you matter because you are you, you matter to the last moment of your life&quot;, an approach requiring specialist care which led to a new medical specialty – palliative care – that could be adapted to different situations. Research shows that St Christopher&#x27;s was quite different from hospitals in the 1960s, designed and managed as a &quot;home from home&quot; where the physical environment was important. It was a place where patients could garden, write, talk – and get their hair done. There was always, Saunders would emphasize, so much more to be done, and she worked in this spirit as its medical director from 1967, and then, from 1985, as its chairperson, a post she occupied until 2000 when she became president.

She was, however, reluctant for St Christopher&#x27;s to admit patients with AIDS in the years after the syndrome first emerged. In a letter to the Secretary of State for Social Services, she stated, &quot;we have strong reservations about the use of our existing inpatient facilities for AIDS patients&quot;, explaining in a memorandum to the Select Committee on Social Services: &quot;A hospice ward is a very personal place, welcoming families, with their children, to be with the dying family member. Among them, I believe, there would be many who would extremely fearful of doing this if they knew AIDS patients were being admitted. However irrational, this fear is a very real matter, and would be an added burden on those facing the loss of loved ones.&quot;

Saunders was an Anglican. In 1977, she was awarded an honorary Lambeth doctorate by the Archbishop of Canterbury. She later was made a Dame of the Order of St Gregory the Great (awarded by the Pope)

In 1979, she was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE). In 1981 she was awarded the Templeton Prize, the world&#x27;s highest-value annual prize awarded to an individual. In 1989, she was appointed to the Order of Merit. In 2001, she received the world&#x27;s largest humanitarian award, the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize, on behalf of St Christopher&#x27;s.

On 25 April 2005, another portrait of Saunders was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery. Saunders was one of the subjects of Prime Minister Gordon Brown&#x27;s book: &quot;&quot;. She was a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, a Fellow of the Royal College of Nursing and a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons.

St Christopher&#x27;s includes an arts team that provides art therapy, music therapy, drama therapy and community arts. The work of the arts team is reflected in two publications: &quot;End of Life Care: A Guide for Therapists, Artists and Arts Therapists&quot; and &quot;The Creative Arts in Palliative Care&quot;.

==Marriage==
In 1963, three years after the death of Michniewicz, Saunders became familiar with the paintings of Marian Bohusz-Szyszko, a Polish émigré and professor with a degree in fine art. They met and became friends, and she became a patron of his art. A substantial amount of his work is hung at St Christopher&#x27;s Hospice.

Bohusz-Szyszko had a long-estranged wife in Poland, whom he supported, and was a devout Roman Catholic. In 1980, five years after the death of his wife, he married Saunders. She was 61 and he was 79. Bohusz-Szyszko died in 1995, at the age of 94, spending his last days at St Christopher&#x27;s Hospice.

==Charitable organisation==

In 2002, Saunders co-founded a new charitable organisation, Cicely Saunders International, of which she was the founding trustee and president. The charity&#x27;s mission is to promote research to improve the care and treatment of all patients with progressive illness and to make high-quality palliative care available to everyone who needs it – hospice, hospital or home. The charity has co-created the world&#x27;s first purpose built institute of palliative care – the Cicely Saunders Institute, and supported research to improve the management of symptoms such as breathlessness, action to meet more closely patient and family choice in palliative care and better support for older people. Cicely Saunder&#x27;s obituary in the Royal College of Physicians of London&#x27;s Munk&#x27;s Roll collection contains further information about her work with this organisation.

==Medical ethics==
Saunders was instrumental in the history of UK medical ethics. She was an advisor to Andrew Mephem whose report led the Rev. Edward Shotter to set up the London Medical Group (LMG), a forerunner of the Society for the Study of Medical Ethics, later the Institute of Medical Ethics. She gave one of the first LMG lectures on the subject of pain, developing the talk into &quot;The Nature and Management of Terminal pain&quot; by 1972.

This went on to be one of the most often repeated and requested lectures of the LMG and other such Medical Groups that sprung up around Great Britain, where it was often given as their inaugural lecture. Her talk on the care of the dying patient was printed by the LMG in its series &#x27;Documentation in Medical Ethics, a forerunner of the Journal of Medical Ethics.

She strongly opposed voluntary euthanasia. This was partly because of her Christian faith, but she also argued that it is never needed, because effective pain control is always possible. She did, however, accept that both sides in the euthanasia debate were against unnecessary pain and the loss of personal dignity.

==Total pain==
Saunders introduced the idea of &quot;total pain&quot;, which included physical, emotional, social, and spiritual distress.

==Death==
Saunders developed breast cancer but still continued to work. She died aged 87 in 2005 at St Christopher&#x27;s Hospice.

==Biographies==
She is the subject of a biography, &quot;Cicely Saunders: A Life and Legacy&quot;, published in 2018 to mark the 100th anniversary of her birth, and of the biographical novel &quot;Di cosa è fatta la speranza. Il romanzo di Cicely Saunders&quot; by Emmanuel Exitu, published in Italy by Bompiani editore.

<doc id="1093116" wikidata="Q4802179" url="?curid=1093116" title="Arunachal Congress">
<text>Arunachal Congress (AC) was a regional political party in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.

It was founded in 1996 as a splinter group of the Indian National Congress, when the local party leader and Chief Minister Gegong Apang revolted against the then Congress leader P.V. Narasimha Rao.

== History ==

Apang took with him 54 members of the legislative assembly of a total of 60 of Arunachal Pradesh to his new party. In the Lok Sabha elections in 1998 AC won both seats of Arunachal Pradesh.

The party received 172 496 votes (52,47% of the votes in the state). AC allied itself with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and was a founding member of the National Democratic Alliance. Omak Apang the son of Gegong Apang, who had been elected from the constituency Arunachal West was appointed a minister in the Centre government.

== Split ==

The successes of AC didn&#x27;t last long. Directly after the 1998 elections there was a revolt within the party. Wangcha Rajkumar, who had been elected to the Lok Sabha from the constituency Arunachal East in both 1996 and 1998, accused Apang of resorting to nepotism when his son was appointed minister. Five state ministers that had sided with Rajkumar were fired by Apang.

One of the ex-ministers, Mukut Mithi, split and formed the Arunachal Congress (Mithi). AC(M) was able to gather 40 members of the legislative assembly and Mithi formed a government. Initially both AC and AC(M) supported the Vajpayee government, but since Rajkumar wasn&#x27;t allotted a ministerial post AC(M) merged with the Indian National Congress ahead of the 1999 elections.

Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections of 1999 AC ran in alliance with BJP. Omak Apang stood in Arunachal West (came second with 70 760 votes, 30,07% in that constituency). In Arunachal East Rajkumar now back in INC defeated the BJP candidate.

One reason, it claimed, that the AC-BJP combine fared so badly was that several armed factions especially the powerful National Socialist Council of Nagaland in the area worked against them.

The legislative assembly elections the same year gave even worse results. AC launched 38 candidates, but only one (Gegong Apang) was elected. In total the party got 68 645 votes (16,68% of the votes in the state).

Ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections the political map of Arunachal Pradesh had been redrawn yet again. 25 July 2003 there was a new split in the INC, and a new party Congress (Dolo) was formed.

Apang formed a front called the United Democratic Front consisting of himself, Congress (D), an expelled Congress MLA and two independents. In total Apang was able to gather 41 MLAs around gum, and on 3 August Apang was again sworn in as Chief Minister of the state.

On 30 August Apang joined BJP] and took with his 41 MLAs. Thus BJP controlled a state government in the North-East for the first time.

Arunachal Congress did however continue to exist as a party even after that the founder Apang had joined BJP.

Ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections AC talked about calling for a boycott, as a protest against that Chakma and Hajong refugees had been given the right to vote in the state. In the end the party did however decide to contest, this time allied with Indian National Congress. AC launched its new party president, Kamen Ringu, in Arunachal West. Ringu came second and got 76 527 votes (34,54% in that constituency). In Arunachal East INC had launched a candidate, who also came second.

In the legislative assembly elections in 2004 AC had put up 11 candidates, out of whom two were elected.

The leadership of the party is called Arunachal Congress Working Committee (ACWC).

The organization Arunachal Congress Volunteer Force is probably related to the party.

Just before the 2009 Assembly election, Arunachal Congress merged with Indian National Congress.

<text>San Vicente de Oviedo is a church and monastery in Oviedo, Spain. Its foundation in 761 is recorded in a charter known as the &quot;Pacto monástico de Oviedo&quot; (&quot;Monastic Pact of Oviedo&quot;). A copy made in the 12th century of the original that is dated 25 November 781 is considered the earliest document on the monarchy of the Kingdom of Asturias, although doubts exist as to the veracity of this document since the monastery, also called Antealtares in the Middle Ages, is not mentioned again until 969.
==Background==
According to the charter of 781, twenty years before, in 761, the monks, Máximo, with his serfs, and Fromestano, founded a church in &quot;locum quod dicunt Oveto&quot; (the place called Oveto), which was to become the city of Oviedo. Fromestano and Maximo are considered the founders of the city and church. Fromestano, in the charter of 781, describes its founding:

I, Frómista (Fromestano), abbot for the past twenty years, together with my nephew Máximo the monk, settled in this place, abandoned and uninhabited, founding a basilica in honor of Saint Vincent, a martyr of Christ and a deacon.

Transformed into a monastery, the first abbot was Oveco, documented between 969 and 978. The first reference mentioning that the monastery followed the Benedictine Rule is dated 1042.

The style of the building is Romanesque, although reworked in the 11th and 12th centuries. Its cloister is an official National Historic and Artistic Monument and, since 1952, has housed the Archaeological Museum of Asturias.

<text>Oil of guaiac is a fragrance ingredient used in soap and perfumery. Despite its name it does not come from the &quot;Guaiacum&quot; tree, but from the palo santo tree (&quot;Bulnesia sarmientoi&quot;).

Oil of guaiac is produced through steam distillation of a mixture of wood and sawdust from palo santo. It is sometimes incorrectly called guaiac wood concrete. It is a yellow to greenish yellow semi-solid mass which melts around 40–50 °C. Once melted, it can be cooled back to room temperature yet remain liquid for a long time. Oil of guaiac has a soft roselike odour, similar to the odour of hybrid tea roses or violets. Because of this similarity, it has sometimes been used as an adulterant for rose oil.

Oil of guaiac is primarily composed of 42–72% guaiol, bulnesol, δ-bulnesene, β-bulnesene, α-guaiene, guaioxide and β-patchoulene. It is considered non-irritating, non-sensitizing, and non-phototoxic to human skin.

Oil of guaiac was also a pre-Renaissance remedy to syphilis.

<doc id="1093129" wikidata="Q3723724" url="?curid=1093129" title="Elvera Sanchez">
<text>Elvera &quot;Baby&quot; Sanchez Davis (September 1, 1905 – September 3, 2000) was an American dancer and the mother of Sammy Davis Jr.

Davis Jr. stated that his mother was Puerto Rican and born in San Juan; however, in the 2003 biography &quot;In Black and White&quot;, author Wil Haygood wrote that Davis&#x27; mother was born in New York City, of Afro-Cuban descent, and that Davis claimed she was Puerto Rican because he feared anti-Cuban backlash would hurt his record sales.

==Life and career==
Elvera Sanchez was born in New York City to Cuban immigrants Luisa Valentina (née Aguiar) (14 February 1884–5 October 1996), who was a living centenarian at the time of Sammy Jr.&#x27;s death and Marco Sánchez (1852–1908), a cigar maker. She began her career as a chorus-line dancer at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem, in 1921. She became known as &quot;Baby Sanchez&quot;, and married Sammy Davis Sr., also a dancer, in 1923. In 1925, their son and only child, Sammy Davis Jr., was born. He would often accompany his mother and father to the theater. When Sammy Jr. was three, his parents split up and his father obtained sole custody of him, taking him on the road. Sanchez was a chorus-line dancer at Apollo Theater for six years and appeared in Oscar Micheaux’s 1938 film &quot;Swing&quot;. She continued to dance until the 1940s.

After retiring from her show business career at the age of 35, she began working as a barmaid for Grace&#x27;s Little Belmont in Atlantic City, New Jersey. She enjoyed telling jokes to customers and was known for sporting a gold napkin. Her connections with entertainers Count Basie, Billy Eckstine, and Sarah Vaughan drew these and other celebrities to her station, and her son Sammy would come to visit after performing across town at the 500 Club &quot;and delighted everyone, pouring drinks and singing&quot;. Frank Sinatra&#x27;s valet George Jacobs recalled in his memoirs that Sinatra also liked to drop by Grace&#x27;s Little Belmont in the early morning hours after his shows at the 500 Club to say hello to Davis&#x27; mother behind the bar.

From 1989, until her death in 2000, she was an adviser to the New York Committee to Celebrate National Tap Dance Day. She was also survived by a daughter, Ramona.

== Personal life ==
Sanchez was Catholic and raised Sammy Jr. as such.

<text>Army Public Schools (APS) are chain of educational institutions under regional commands of Indian Army established for the purpose of providing education to the children of Indian armed forces personnel. With a nationwide presence spanning 137 schools, it is one of the largest chains of schools in India. The Army Welfare Education Society (AWES), which was founded in 1983, oversees the management of the APS system, and has established over 137 Army Public schools and 249 Army pre-primary schools across the country, as well as several institutions of higher education.

Since their inception, APSs have witnessed significant growth, with a student population of around 20,000 in 1987 expanding to a mammoth system with a current student strength of approximately 2.3 lakh and 8,500 teaching staff. On average, 5,000 students are added to the APS system every year.

==Overview==
In general, the management of schools is overseen by the regional commands of the army, and the educational pattern followed is that of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). Admission priority is given to children of army personnel. Additionally, each Army school is led by a chairman, who is a senior Indian Army officer holding the rank of brigadier, and a patron, who holds the rank of major general.

== Historical Background ==
The concept of Army Public Schools was initiated on January 15, 1980, when the Chief of Army Staff recognized the need for dedicated schools for army children. Initially, a few schools were established under various regional commands, but the system expanded rapidly. On April 29, 1983, the Army Welfare Education Society (AWES) was formally registered under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860 to oversee the administration and development of these institutions.

== Administration and Oversight ==
Each Army Public School operates under the guidance of local formation commanders through School Administration and Management Committees (SAMC). The overall governance falls under AWES, with the Chief of Army Staff serving as the Patron-in-Chief, while Army Commanders act as regional Patrons. This hierarchical structure ensures strict discipline, efficiency, and high academic standards in APS institutions.

<text>Santa Monica Bay is a bight of the Pacific Ocean in Southern California, United States. Its boundaries are slightly ambiguous, but it is generally considered to be the part of the Pacific within an imaginary line drawn between Point Dume, in Malibu, and the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Its eastern shore forms the western boundary of the Los Angeles Westside and South Bay regions. Although it was fed by the Los Angeles River until the river&#x27;s catastrophic change of course in 1825, the only stream of any size now flowing into it is Ballona Creek. Smaller waterways draining into the bay include Malibu Creek, Topanga Creek, and Santa Monica Creek.

The Santa Monica Bay is home to some of the most famous beaches in the world, including Malibu Lagoon State Beach (Surfrider), Will Rogers State Beach, Santa Monica State Beach, and Dockweiler State Beach.

Several piers extend into the bay, including Malibu Pier, Santa Monica Pier, Venice Pier, Manhattan Beach Pier, Hermosa Beach Pier, and the Redondo Beach pier. Marina Del Rey is a dredged marina. The bay is a very popular fishing destination year-round.

==History==
In the 1930s, gambling ships anchored beyond the regulated three-mile limit, then kept measured from the beach. The ships were popular, and a fleet of ever-larger ships and barges appeared until the State Attorney General recalculated the limit to exclude the bay. The largest ship held the state police off for nine days with submachine guns in what the newspapers called &quot;The Battle of Santa Monica Bay&quot;.

Once a major commercial fishery, Santa Monica Bay&#x27;s water quality declined drastically in the 20th century as development of Los Angeles County resulted in large amounts of sewage and trash-rich storm runoff being dumped into its waters. Through restoration projects mandated by the Clean Water Act and advocated by groups such as Heal the Bay and the Surfrider Foundation, the bay&#x27;s water quality has improved fairly dramatically from its early-1980s nadir. Hyperion sewage treatment plant&#x27;s output is now far cleaner than before. However, during the region&#x27;s rainy winters, the bay suffers from algal bloom and other water pollution-related maladies, periodically forcing most of the famous beaches along its shore to close.

On January 13, 1969, Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 933 crashed into the bay while on approach to Los Angeles International Airport, killing 15 of the 45 people on board. Five days later on January 18, United Airlines Flight 266 crashed into the bay after takeoff from the same airport, killing all 38 people on board.

In 1990, actor Wallace Reid Jr. was killed when his homebuilt plane crashed in the bay amid heavy fog.

In 2006, game show host Peter Tomarken and his wife Kathleen were killed in a plane crash into the bay. They were heading to San Diego to pick up a cancer patient who needed transportation to UCLA Medical Center for treatment when their airplane crashed.

Since 2022, The Ocean Cleanup has been operating a cleanup system in Ballona Creek to prevent plastic and other solid waste from leaking into the bay.

<doc id="1093167" wikidata="Q322272" url="?curid=1093167" title="Sammy Davis Sr.">
<text>Samuel George Davis Sr. (December 12, 1900 – May 21, 1988) was an American dancer and the father of entertainer Sammy Davis Jr.

==Early life==
Davis was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, to Rosa B. Taylor (1870–1956) and Robert Davis (1868–1948). He and his former wife Elvera Sanchez were both dancers in a vaudeville troupe. The couple split up when their son Sammy Jr. was three. Davis took custody of his son, who then went into show business with his father. He and Will Mastin, the leader of the dance troupe, taught Sammy Jr. how to dance and they performed together as the Will Mastin Trio.

Sammy Jr. once stated, &quot;When I was nine I told my father, &#x27;I can outdance you&#x27;. &#x27;Oh yeah? What makes you think that?&#x27; he asked. &#x27;Cause you taught me everything I know&#x27;. &#x27;Yeah, but I didn&#x27;t teach you everything &quot;I&quot; know.&#x27;&quot;

==Career==

Davis began dancing early in life, and as a young man joined Will Mastin to form a dancing troupe. Soon Sammy Jr. joined the act and they became known as the Will Mastin Trio. The three appeared in the 1956 Broadway musical &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;.

Davis also appeared in two movies, &quot;Sweet and Low&quot; (1947) with the Will Mastin Trio, and &quot;The Benny Goodman Story&quot; (1956), in which he played the bandleader and arranger Fletcher Henderson.

==Death==
Davis died May 21, 1988, in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 87, of natural causes, just two years before the death of his son, Sammy Davis Jr.

He was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) in Glendale, California.

<doc id="1093175" wikidata="Q63500" url="?curid=1093175" title="Johann Franz Buddeus">
<text>Johann Franz Buddeus or Budde (sometimes Johannes Franciscus Buddeus; 25 June 1667, Anklam – 19 November 1729, Gotha) was a German Lutheran theologian and philosopher.

==Early life and education==
Buddeus was a descendant of the French scholar Guillaume Budé, also known by the Latinized name Budaeus; the Huguenots family fled France after the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre, and those who emigrated to Pomerania Germanized their name as Budde, the Latin equivalent of which was Buddeus.

He was born at Anklam, Swedish Pomerania, where his father was pastor. He early received a thorough education in classical and Oriental languages, and had read the Bible through in the original before he went to the University of Wittenberg in 1685. He was appointed adjunct professor of philosophy there soon after taking his master&#x27;s degree in 1687, and in 1689 exchanged this for a similar position at Jena, where he also paid much attention to the study of history.

==Career==
In 1692, he went to Coburg as professor of Greek and Latin in a Gymnasium, and the next year to the new University of Halle as professor of moral philosophy. Here he remained until 1705, when he went to Jena as second professor of theology. His lectures embraced all branches of this science, and frequently touched on philosophy, history, and politics.

He remained at Jena for the rest of his life, several times acting as rector of the university temporarily and being head of his department and an ecclesiastical councilor from 1715.

He was considered the most universally accomplished German theologian of his time. In philosophy he professed an eclecticism which rested on a broad historical foundation; but he recognized in Descartes the originator of a new period, and in attacking the &quot;atheist&quot; Spinoza followed especially the upholders of the law of nature, such as Hugo Grotius, Puffendorf, and Thomasius. His theological position was determined by the tradition of Johannes Musäus at Jena, partly through his close relations with Baier; but on another side he was inclined toward Pietism.

==Works==

His works number over a hundred. Those published during the Halle period include &quot;Elementa philosophiæ practicæ&quot; (1697) and &quot;Elementa philosophiæ eclecticæ&quot; (1703).

To the second Jena period belong among others the &quot;Institutiones theologiæ moralis&quot; (1711; German transl., 1719), a work strictly in accordance with his philosophical ethics; the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica veteris testamenti&quot; (1715–18); &quot;Theses theologicæ de atheismo et superstitione&quot; (1716), which, directed especially against Spinoza, attracted much attention; &quot;Institutiones theologiæ dogmaticæ&quot; (1723), a work once very influential, obviously founded on Baier&#x27;s Compendium; &quot;Historische und theologische Einleitung in die vornehmsten Religionsstreitigkeiten&quot; (1724, 1728), edited by Walch; &quot;Isagoge historico-theologica ad theologiam universam&quot; (1727), dealing with the problems methods, and history of theology in a way remarkable for that time; and &quot;Ecclesia apostolica&quot; (1729), intended as an introduction to the study of the New Testament.

<text>Chorleywood is a village and civil parish in the Three Rivers District, Hertfordshire, on the border with Buckinghamshire, approximately northwest of Charing Cross. The village is adjacent to the Chiltern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is part of the London commuter belt included in the government-defined Greater London Urban Area. Chorleywood was historically part of the parish of Rickmansworth, becoming a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1845 and a separate civil parish in 1898. The population of the parish was 11,286 at the 2011 census.

In 2004, a study by The Social Disadvantage Research Centre at the University of Oxford named Chorleywood as the “happiest place” to live in the UK. Of the 32,482 communities surveyed, Chorleywood came out top. More recently, Chorleywood has been ranked as the “least deprived” area in the country by the Department of Communities and Local Government.

== History ==
Settlement at Chorleywood dates to the Paleolithic era when the plentiful flint supply led to swift development of tools by man. The Romans built a village on the ancient site complete with a mill and brewery.

Though variants have been proposed, the name has been derived from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;leah&quot;, meaning a clearing or a wood, of the &quot;ceorla&quot; or peasants. A line runs through Chorleywood that once divided the Kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex and now divides the counties of Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Edward the Confessor gave Chorleywood to the Monastery of St Albans.

By 1278, it was known, perhaps duplicating the &quot;woodland&quot; element, as &#x27;Bosco de Cherle&#x27; or &#x27;Churl&#x27;s Wood&#x27;, Norman for &#x27;Peasant&#x27;s Wood&#x27;. Upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries, it passed to the Bishopric of London, being renamed &#x27;Charleywoode&#x27;. It became Crown property during the reign of Elizabeth I. The Turnpike Act (1663) gave Chorleywood a chance to exploit its strategic position, allowing locals the opportunity to charge civilians to use the road from Hatfield to Reading.

Chorleywood is most famous for its Quakers. Non-conformists flocked to Chorleywood, promised sanctuary by the locals. William Penn founded the Pennsylvania Colony with settlers from Chorleywood, Rickmansworth and nearby towns in southern Buckinghamshire, having lived and married in Chorleywood.

Chorleywood House, a Regency mansion, was built in 1822 by John Barnes, replacing an earlier house. John Saunders Gilliat, the Governor of the Bank of England in 1883–1885, lived in it. In 1892, the house was bought by Lady Ela Sackville Russell, eldest daughter of the 9th Duke of Bedford. She modified and enlarged the house turning the grounds into a model estate with market gardens.

The Metropolitan Railway opened Chorleywood station on 8 July 1889.

In the early 1960s, researchers at the British Baking Industries Research Association in Chorleywood improved upon an earlier American bread-making process. This resulted in the Chorleywood bread process which is now used in over 80% of commercial bread production throughout the UK.

In the 1973 BBC Television documentary, &quot;Metro-land&quot;, Sir John Betjeman described Chorleywood as &quot;essential Metro-land&quot;.

Chorleywood has frequently been used as a filming location. The Royal Masonic School is featured in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, while the Black Horse pub is featured in &quot;Peep Show&quot;. &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;, &quot;Lewis&quot; and &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; have also been filmed in Chorleywood.

== Chorleywood Common ==

Chorleywood Common is of wooded common land. The Common is a County Heritage Site, a Conservation Area and a Local Nature Reserve with significant biodiversity and rich in fauna and flora, fungi, birds and wildlife. Since cattle grazing ended soon after the First World War, the land has been used for recreational purposes. Chorleywood Golf Club maintains a nine-hole golf course on the Common; the golf club was founded in 1890 and is the oldest in Hertfordshire.

&quot;Christchurch, the parish church and a local landmark, stands facing the Common on the A404. The original church was built in 1845. When this building became dilapidated it was demolished, with the exception of the tower and was rebuilt and consecrated in 1870. It has a cedar wood tower of unusual design on the flint built west tower.&quot;

In the 19th century, the MCC established a cricket pitch on the Common, which is used by Chorleywood Cricket Club&#x27;s senior and junior teams to this day.

==Governance==
Chorleywood has three tiers of local government at parish, district, and county level: Chorleywood Parish Council, Three Rivers District Council, and Hertfordshire County Council.

Chorleywood was historically part of the parish of Rickmansworth. A separate ecclesiastical parish of Chorleywood was created in 1845, following the construction of Christ Church, but Chorleywood remained part of the civil parish of Rickmansworth until 1898. When the Local Government Act 1894 created parish and district councils in December 1894, a parish council was established for Rickmansworth, which was in turn part of the Watford Rural District. Shortly afterwards inquiries were held into creating an urban district of Rickmansworth. It was eventually decided that it would not be appropriate to apply urban powers to the whole civil parish of Rickmansworth, and therefore that it would be split into three new parishes: Rickmansworth Urban, Rickmansworth Rural, and Chorleywood. These changes took effect on 15 April 1898, with the Chorleywood and Rickmansworth Rural parishes remaining in the Watford Rural District. The first meeting of Chorleywood Parish Council was held on 16 April 1898 at the village school, with Charles Barnes being appointed the first chairman.

Chorleywood became an urban district itself on 1 April 1913, making it independent of Watford Rural District. The first meeting of Chorleywood Urban District Council was held on 15 April 1913 at the clubhouse of Chorleywood Golf Club on Common Road. Arthur Capell was elected as first chairman of the council. The council generally met at the Golf Club until the Second World War. A council chamber and surveyor&#x27;s office was incorporated into the Chorleywood Memorial Hall on Common Road, built in 1922, and the council did meet there during 1923 and 1924, but then decided that the meeting room at the Golf Club was preferable and reverted to holding meetings there in 1925.

In 1939 Chorleywood Urban District Council bought Chorleywood House for £5,000. The house became the council&#x27;s offices and meeting place until the council&#x27;s abolition in 1974.

Chorleywood Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, merging with Rickmansworth Urban District and most of Watford Rural District to form the Three Rivers non-metropolitan district with effect from 1 April 1974. A new Chorleywood Parish Council was created as a successor parish to the former urban district.

== Transport ==

Chorleywood has grown in the past century following the extension of the Metropolitan Railway (also known as the Met). Chorleywood station is in Zone 7 of the London Underground Metropolitan line, and is situated between Rickmansworth and Chalfont and Latimer. The majority of trains stopping at Chorleywood are operated by London Underground. The station is also on the Chiltern Railways line running between Marylebone and Aylesbury.

Junctions 17 and 18 of the M25 are at Chorleywood, as well as the A404.

The 336 bus route runs via Chorleywood between High Wycombe and Watford.

<text>Will Mastin (June 20, 1878 – March 14, 1979), also credited as Will Maston, was a dancer and singer.

==Career on the dance floor==

Mastin was the leader of the Will Mastin Trio, which included Sammy Davis Sr. and his son Sammy Davis Jr. Will Mastin was also the &quot;uncle&quot; of Sammy Davis Jr. Sammy&#x27;s father Sammy Davis Sr. and Will were good friends.

The Will Mastin Trio original members were Sammy Davis Sr., Howard M. Colbert Jr., and Will Mastin, although Sammy Davis Jr. would join them on stage when he was a little boy (starting at age 3). Sammy performed &quot;unbilled&quot; in 1929 at the Veterans Memorial in Columbus, Ohio.

Sammy also knew how to act, sing and play many instruments.

Howard M. Colbert Jr. was the tap-dance teacher of Sammy Davis Jr., who treated him much as an uncle. Colbert left the Trio in December 1941 to join the United States Army when the United States declared war on Germany during World War II. Sammy Davis Jr. was 16 years old at this time and became part of the main vaudeville act, replacing Colbert. The three appeared in the 1947 musical short film &quot;Sweet and Low&quot; and the 1956 Broadway musical &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mastin was born in Madison, Alabama on June 20, 1878, to a single mother named Sally Mastin, according to the 1880 Federal Census of Enumeration and the California Death Index.

==Death==
Will Mastin died on March 14, 1979, at age 100, according to the California Death Index. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, near Sammy Davis Sr. and Sammy Davis Jr. The epitaph on his tomb says only: &quot;He Was A Vaudevillian&quot;, it does not provide birth and death dates.

<text>The Four Level Interchange (officially the Bill Keene Memorial Interchange) is the first stack interchange in the world. Completed in 1949 and fully opened in 1953 at the northern edge of Downtown Los Angeles, California, United States, it connects U.S. Route 101 (Hollywood Freeway and Santa Ana Freeway) to State Route 110 (Harbor Freeway and Arroyo Seco Parkway). In 2006, the interchange was officially renamed in the memory of Los Angeles traffic and weather reporter Bill Keene.

==Description==
The highway is a stack interchange that connects U.S. Route 101 to State Route 110. All movements are possible in this interchange between US 101, which crosses over SR 110, but not necessarily with surrounding roads, like Sunset Boulevard, which crosses SR 110 just northeast of the interchange. The interchange is located at Exit 3 of US 101 and Exit 24A of SR 110.

The four freeway segments (&quot;paths&quot; of travel) from the Four Level Interchange are:

==History==
While the highway oriented east–west at this intersection has consistently been numbered US 101, the numerical designation of road oriented north–south at this interchange has changed over the years. Originally designated U.S. Route 66 and U.S. Route 6 and later signed as State Route 11, all of these designations were eventually removed from the intersection and replaced with the current designation of Route 110.

The four-level reinforced concrete structure was designed by a team of engineers and built by the James I. Barnes Construction Company. Although it was finished in 1949, it was not put into full use until the freeways it served were completed and opened on 22 September 1953.

In July 2006, the freeway interchange was officially named in honor of Bill Keene, former KNX and KNXT traffic and weather reporter, although the new name is rarely used. Keene referred to the interchange as &quot;The Stacks&quot; and the &quot;4-H Interchange&quot;. During the 1960s, Dick Whittinghill on radio station KMPC sometimes called it the Four Letter Interchange.

The interchange was constructed as a stack interchange because surrounding buildings and terrain made construction of a cloverleaf interchange impractical. The construction of the interchange displaced over 4,000 people from their homes and cost $5.5 million ($ in ) - making it the most expensive half-mile of highway ever built at the time.

The mainline traffic of US 101 is at the top of the interchange, above the ramps, a rarity in stack interchanges. Other examples of similar configurations would later be constructed, including on the M25 interchange with M23 passing above the ramps (south of London), the junction of I-695 and I-70 in Baltimore, and the Interstate 805–Interstate 8 interchange in San Diego.

Its distinctive architecture has long made it a symbol of Los Angeles&#x27; post–World War II development, and it appears on numerous postcards from the 1950s and 1960s.

<text>The Will Mastin Trio (also Will Maston Trio on some bills) was a troupe of dancers and singers formed by Will Mastin, Sammy Davis Sr., and Sammy Davis Jr. The original members were Sammy Davis Sr., Howard M. Colbert Jr., and Will Mastin, although Sammy Davis Jr. would join them on stage when he was a little boy. Howard M. Colbert Jr. was the tap-dance teacher of Sammy Davis Jr., who treated him much as an uncle. Colbert left the Trio in December 1941 to join the United States Army when the United States declared war on Germany during World War II. Sammy Davis Jr. was 16 years old at this time and became part of the main vaudeville act, replacing Colbert.

They performed from the 1920s through the 1960s.

The trio stopped performing when Sammy Davis Jr. was called to serve in the Army in 1943, but resumed their activity after the end of the war in Portland, Oregon. Even when Sammy Davis Jr.&#x27;s solo career was successful, during the 1950s and 1960s, he still performed occasionally with his father and uncle as the Will Mastin Trio, typically giving them billing on his shows and singles.

In 1953, Sammy Davis Jr. was offered his own television show on ABC. He was still under contract with Will Mastin, so the show was intended to be called &quot;Three for the Road — with the Will Mastin Trio&quot;. The network spent $20,000 filming the pilot which presented African Americans as struggling musicians, not the usual slapstick comedy or stereotypical mammy roles of the time. The cast included Frances Davis who was the first black ballerina to perform for the Paris Opera, actresses Ruth Attaway and Jane White, and Frederick O&#x27;Neal who founded the American Negro Theater. The network couldn&#x27;t get a sponsor, so the show was dropped.

Among their credited appearances are the movie &quot;Sweet and Low&quot; of 1947 and the musical &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;, staged on Broadway from 1956 to 1957.

Bonds of deep affection tied the three men together. They are buried in the same cemetery, next to one another, in the Davis family tomb.

<text>Fort Southwick is one of the forts found on Portsdown Hill, which overlooks the naval base of Portsmouth in the county of Hampshire, England.

==History==

Fort Southwick was built to defend the landward approaches to the naval base on the recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom which reported in 1860.

It is the highest fort on the hill, and holds the water storage tanks for the other forts, supplying them via a brick lined aqueduct. Construction was started in 1861 and completed by 1870. It was designed to house a large complement of men (about 220) in a crescent-shaped barrack block. Its north projection has one full caponier to defend the dry ditch, and has two smaller demi-caponiers at the corners. A small musketry gallery crosses the ditch at the south-west angle to cover a minor branch of the ditch. Mortar batteries of five mortars each can be found set into the rampart behind the demi-caponiers.

In 1893 the fort was armed with a total of 23 guns:
*Nine 64 pounder rifled muzzle-loading guns
*Eight 7-inch rifled breech-loading (RBL) guns
*Six rifled muzzle loaded howitzers (three were on ground platforms; the other three on travelling carriages)

A central spiral staircase from the surface gives access to four main tunnels running radially outward from it at uneven angles. These tunnels lead to the barrack block and caponiers, and past the magazine.

During the Second World War, Underground Headquarters of UGHQ, the communications &quot;nerve centre&quot; for Operation Overlord, was in a secret network of tunnels excavated between February and December 1942 by 172 Tunnelling Company of the Royal Engineers 100 ft (30 m) underneath Fort Southwick, well out of reach of any bombs of the era. The call sign of this base was &#x27;MIN&#x27;.

Although disarmed in 1906, the fort was retained by the military as a barracks, and also used to train soldiers how to capture and hold a fort. It became a demobilisation centre for three years after the First World War. The fort was part of the Admiralty Research Establishment until 2002, when all operational use of the fort ceased. It was sold by the Ministry of Defence in July 2003 to the &quot;Fort Southwick Company Limited&quot;, who intend to convert the barrack block into luxury apartments. The site is currently occupied by the NHS and includes a staff park and ride service to Queen Alexandra Hospital.
It has been a Grade I Listed Building since 1987.

<text>Fort Widley is one of the forts built on top of Portsdown Hill between 1860 and 1868 on the recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom. It was designed, along with the other Palmerston Forts atop Portsdown, to protect Portsmouth from attack from the rear.

==Design and construction==
Fort Widley was a polygonal Fort designed by William Crossman, an officer of the Royal Engineers, who was part of the staff of the Inspector General of Fortifications at the War Office. The fort was built up from chalk, with red brick and local flint being used for buildings and revetment to the large dry ditch which was also dug at the same time.

Armament was fitted into three different categories - the main armament which was mounted on a semi-circular rampart, high angle armament provided by 13-inch mortars, mounted in two protected mortar batteries and close range armament, mounted in one full and two demi-caponiers.

Barracks accommodation was also provided for both officers and other ranks.

==Armament==
Even before they were completed questions arose over the effectiveness of the forts in the face of improving weapons technology and the forts were not fitted with guns until some years after they had been completed. This delay resulted in changes to the fort&#x27;s planned armament. The originally specified 68-pounder smooth-bore guns were never fitted and instead RBL 7 inch Armstrong guns may have been the fort&#x27;s first armament. In 1885 the fort was reported to have been fitted with some ordnance while the other Portsdown forts were still awaiting their guns. By the 1890s the fort was fitted with five RML 6.6-inch howitzers, ten RBL 7 inch Armstrong guns, two RML 8 inch howitzers and nine RBL 40 pounder Armstrong guns on carriages that could be moved to wherever they were needed. Fort Widley had its guns removed in 1902.

==History and use==
During the Victorian period Fort Widley and the other Portsdown Forts were used to accommodate various infantry units in the barracks. For example, in 1875 the 30th Regiment of foot were quartered there. By 1886 the South Lancashire Regiment was stationed there.

In First World War it was used as a transit depot. During the Second World War it was modified to provide more accommodation. It was then used by a number of units before housing members of the Royal Corps of Signals and Auxiliary Territorial Service supporting the navy command at Fort Southwick. In 1952 the fort became home to a bomb disposal squadron and a year later an emergency civil control centre for Portsmouth was constructed in the fort&#x27;s magazine.

The fort was leased to Portsmouth City Council (then the Portsmouth Corporation) in 1961 and was sold outright to the council in 1972. In 1990 the Fort was taken into use as an activity centre for the Peter Ashley charity, providing a number of activities, including an equestrian centre.

In September 2010 the fort was used to host a search and rescue exercise based around a simulated earthquake. Titled Exercise Orion, the event involved teams from seven countries dealing with 35 scenarios over 2 days.

Both the Fort and a gun in front of it have been designated Listed Buildings, at Grades II* and II respectively.

In 2018, the fort was used as a setting for the Hollywood film The Last Vermeer.

Today the Fort is home to an equestrian centre run by Peter Ashley Activity Centres.

<doc id="1093207" wikidata="Q5471140" url="?curid=1093207" title="Fort Fareham">
<text>Fort Fareham is one of the Palmerston Forts, in Fareham, England. After the Gosport Advanced Line of Fort Brockhurst, Fort Elson, Fort Rowner, Fort Grange and Fort Gomer had been approved by the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom a decision was made to build an outer line of three more forts two miles in advance of the Gosport Advanced Line. Of these three projected forts only Fort Fareham was built due to the need to cut costs. It acted as a hinge between the forts on Portsdown Hill and those of the Gosport Advanced Line, filling the gap at Fareham. It has been a Grade II Listed Building since 1976.

==Design==

Fort Fareham is located on land immediately to the west of Salterns Creek, adjacent to the railway line (which it also protected) from Fareham to Gosport which passed its northeast corner. It is 3,500 yards in advance of Fort Elson, the most northerly fort of the Gosport Advanced Lines. Fort Fareham acted as the link between the Portsdown Hill line of forts and was visible from Fort Wallington which is 2,500 yards to the North and East. The strategically important town of Fareham along with Fareham creek lie in between the two. Fort Fareham was also to provide protection for the road linking Gosport to the Portsdown Forts. Due to the need to protect the ground in front of the Gosport Advanced Line and because of its isolated position Fort Fareham was constructed as a polygonal work with a strong ability to defend itself from being overrun. Its position made an attack on the Gosport Lines very hazardous without it first being captured or disabled.

In trace Fort Fareham is a pentagon with a west facing rampart for the main armament and a north flanking rampart with armament to command the Fareham gap towards Fort Wallington. The ramparts to the south were subject to enfilade fire and were therefore given a greater measure of protection by hiding the guns in a complex range of Haxo casemates. This fort is the only one of the Palmerston Forts to receive such a concentration of Haxo casemates. The fort is surrounded by a ditch that was intended to be wet but problems with obtaining and holding water in this meant that for much of its life the northern portion remained dry. The ditch is ably protected by a grand caponier to the west with smaller demi-caponiers at the north, southwest and south salient angles. A decision was made in the later stages of construction that resulted in the choice of a redan at the rear, closing the gorge of the fort, rather than a self-contained keep, like those of the inner three forts of the Gosport Advanced Line.

==History==
===Construction (1861-1868)===
The construction lasted from 1861 to 1868, with a total cost of £104,557. The report of the 1869 Defence Committee concluded that Fort Fareham was &#x27;...skilfully constructed as regards stability and permanency and when completed according to the approved plans will be suited to the requirements of modern armaments, and when its ditch was filled with water would afford a fair amount of resistance to any attack to which it may be exposed.&#x27;

===Active fort (1868-1902)===
The original design of the fort called for forty-nine 7-inch R.B.L. guns with five 64pr R.M.L. guns (changed to 7-inch R.B.L. guns) on Moncrieff counterweight carriages for the main west rampart, with three rifled howitzers and fifteen smooth bore guns for flank defence of the ditches
By the time that the fort was complete the armament had been changed to sixty-four 7-inch R.B.L., five 40 pdr. R.B.L., five 64 pdr. R.M.L. guns with fifteen 32 pdr. S.B.B.L. guns in the caponiers and three Rifled Howitzers. In 1886 the mounted armament was one 7-inch R.B.L. gun and two 6.3-inch Rifled Muzzle Loading howitzers. In 1891 most of the intended armament was in place: fifteen 7-inch RBL consisting of ten guns in the emplacements on the main and south rampart with five guns in the Moncrieff Gun Pit, ten movable guns to cover the Fareham Gap consisting of four 4-inch B.L. on siege carriages and six 40 pdr. R.B.L on traveling carriages.

===Later use (1902-1965)===
By 1902 most of the land front forts were stood down as defensive structures and their armament, including that at Fort Fareham, was withdrawn. Fort Fareham then continued to serve as a barrack until the conclusion of the second world war. In 1905 the Portsmouth Fortress Defence Scheme called for the occupation of Fort Fareham, during the precautionary period, by forty four men of No. 23 Company Royal Garrison Artillery, and members of the 3rd. Battalion Oxfordshire Light Infantry Militia. They were to use the fort as a base to meet an attack from the west assuming that the enemy had captured or marched around Southampton. They were to be supplemented after mobilisation by three officers and sixty-six men from the 2nd Hampshire Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers). The 1st. Volunteer Brigade Hampshire Regiment were to provide men for administrative purposes only. Movable armament for use in the Fareham gap was stored at Fort Fareham. This consisted of four 15 pdr. B.L.s, and four 4-inch B.L.s and 40pdr. Rifled Muzzle Loading guns. In April 1907 the 108th (Heavy) Battery Royal Garrison Artillery was stationed at Fort Fareham. The 1st. Heavy Brigade was stationed at Fort Fareham by 1908. Sometime after 1900 stables, a harness room and vehicle shed were added to the parade adjacent to the west gun ramp.

In 1914 35th (Heavy) Battery of the 1st Heavy Brigade Royal Garrison Artillery was stationed at the fort. It deployed as part of the British Expeditionary Force, attached to the 2nd Division. VI and VII Siege Brigades Royal Garrison Artillery were raised there in December 1914.

During the Second World War, in 1941 Fort Fareham was used as Brigade headquarters for 124 Heavy Anti Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery and as headquarters for 410 battery, 45 Anti-Aircraft Brigade, 412 battery 65 Anti-Aircraft Brigade and 415 Battery 27th Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery. From 1928 to 1945 the Officers’ Mess served as the HQ for 35th Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Artillery and Gun Operation Room.

From 1947/48 to 1957 it was reallocated for use as part of an Anti Aircraft Operations Room.

===Disuse (1965-present)===
The fort became surplus to requirements in 1965 when it was sold by the Ministry of Defence to Fareham Urban District Council. Shortly afterwards, in 1974, a contractor acting for a Property Company, who had leased the fort from Fareham Council, cleared the ramparts of vegetation by bulldozing it flat. All of the earth was stripped from the Haxo casemates, together with the earth forming the parapets and merlons, leaving the gun emplacements and expense magazines devoid of cover. One Haxo casemate was completely removed. The guard room and gateway were demolished together with the stables, sling wagon shed, movable armament shed, vehicle shed and portions of the parados before an injunction prevented further damage. The parade of the fort is entirely covered with Fort Fareham Business Park. The casemates are intact but have been converted to modern industrial units.

During the Cold War the main magazine and the adjacent south west caponier served for a brief period as Fareham Borough Emergency Centre to be used by the Council’s chosen few in the event of a nuclear attack. It was also to serve as part of 2 Group 10 Brigade Anti Aircraft Operations Room for the Portsmouth and Southampton Gun Defended Area. Today (in 2012) the ramparts are overgrown and inaccessible, the parapets and gun positions have been removed. The five Moncrieff pits are still extant. The range of Haxo casemates on the southwest and south ramparts are intact but bricked-up. The mortar battery and the caponiers are mostly derelict and overgrown with extensive damage to the brickwork. The main west caponier has suffered years of neglect resulting in extensive damage to its outer brickwork. A serious fire in 1989 caused considerable spalling to the interior roof arches. The gun embrasures, loopholes and sally ports have been blocked up to prevent access by vandals. The iron railings of the access bridge to the fort are still in place although the access road has been widened to two lanes by filling in the ditch parallel to the bridge. The ditch was partially cleared in the late 1980s by Fareham Council with volunteer help from people of the adjoining housing estate (Fort Fareham Conservationists, now disbanded). The surrounding wooded scarp, covered way and glacis now forms an area of wildground which seems to be managed by Fareham Council. A series of paths with seats at intervals provides a continuous walkway around the outer perimeter of the ditch.

<text>May Britt (born May Britt Wilkens; 22 March 1934) is a Swedish actress who had a brief career in the 1950s in Italy and later in the United States. She was married to American entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. from 1960 to 1968.

==Career==
Britt was discovered as a teenager by Italian filmmakers Carlo Ponti and Mario Soldati in 1951. She was then an assistant to a Stockholm photographer. The two filmmakers were in Sweden to cast a young blonde for the title role in &quot;Jolanda, the Daughter of the Black Corsair&quot;. They came to the studio where she worked to view photographs of models. After meeting her, they offered her the part. May Britt, as she was renamed professionally, moved to Rome. As expected, she made her film debut as the leading actress in &quot;Jolanda, the Daughter of the Black Corsair&quot; (1952). (Gary Fishgall, in &quot;Gonna Do Great Things: The Life of Sammy Davis Jr.&quot;, wrote of Britt, &quot;... she made her film debut in &quot;Le Infideli&quot; in 1952.&quot;)

In the following years she worked in some ten Cinecittà productions. She also featured in the epic film &quot;War and Peace&quot; of 1956.

In the late 1950s, Britt relocated to Hollywood after signing with 20th Century Fox. She starred in a few movies, including &quot;The Young Lions&quot; (1958) with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift, &quot;The Hunters&quot; (1958) with Robert Mitchum and Robert Wagner and &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot; (1960) with Peter Falk, as well as a much-criticised remake of &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; (1959) in the role first created by Marlene Dietrich in 1930.

==Marriage and retirement==
Britt married Edwin Gregson, a college student, in 1958. In 1959 she filed for divorce.

She met Sammy Davis Jr. in 1959. They began dating, and, after a brief engagement, were married on 13 November 1960. Their wedding caused controversy. A rumour or myth was that John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy told Frank Sinatra to tell Davis not to marry May until after the 1960 Presidential Election. At that time interracial marriage was forbidden by law in 31 U.S. states, and only in 1967 were those laws (by then down to 17 states) ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. Prior to the wedding, Britt converted to Judaism. The couple were married by Reform Rabbi William M. Kramer. It has been confirmed, however, by Sammy and Britt&#x27;s daughter Tracey, Nancy Sinatra, and documentarian Sam Pollard that this marriage resulted in Kennedy rejecting an invitation for Davis to perform at his Inauguration. Yet, Harry Belafonte, who was married to a white woman at the time, was invited to perform.

Once married, Britt left the movies. 

Britt and Davis had a daughter, Tracey Davis (July 5, 1961 – November 2, 2020).&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/tracey-davis-dead&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Britt and Davis adopted two sons: Mark Sidney Davis (born 1960, adopted 4 June 1963) and Jeff (born 1963). 

Britt and Davis divorced in 1968 after Davis reportedly had an affair with dancer Lola Falana.

After the divorce, Britt resumed working with sporadic television guest appearances, the last in 1988. Since then she has been retired and mainly involved in painting. She currently resides in California. Her third husband, Lennart Ringquist, died in 2017.

==In popular culture==
May Britt was portrayed by Megan Dodds in the 1998 television film &quot;The Rat Pack&quot; which depicted her marriage to Sammy Davis Jr., who was played by Don Cheadle.

<text>Poiana Brașov (, ; ) is a neighborhood of Brașov and a Romanian ski resort. 

After the 2010s modernization, the ski area has expanded from to and the slope’s length increased from to . Most slopes now have snow cannons installed. In 2013, Poiana Brașov hosted figure skating, alpine skiing, and short track in the European Youth Olympic Winter Festival.

The resort is located at about above sea level near the city of Brașov in Romania and is easily accessible by road. Regular buses operated by Brașov Transit (RATBV) serve the route between Brașov and Poiana Brașov (lines 20 and 100). The resort also runs minibuses that take visitors from hotels to the base of the ski, these cover areas where people can hike or take a cable car to the Cristianu Mare or Postăvaru summits.

<text>Nilgiri tea is a drink made by infusing leaves of &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; that is grown and processed in the Nilgiris district in Tamil Nadu, India. The leaves are processed as black tea, though some estates have expanded their product offerings to include leaves suitable for making green, white and oolong teas. It is generally described as being a brisk, fragrant and full-bodied tea. The region produces both rolled and crush, tear, curl tea and it is predominantly used for blending. Nilgiri tea is also used for making iced tea and instant tea.

&quot;Camellia sinensis var. sinensis&quot; was introduced to Nilgiri Mountains by the British in 1835 from seeds shipped from China. Commercial production commenced in the 1860s, where the industry would evolve to include a mixture of many small growers with a few large corporate estates and the government-owned Tamil Nadu Tea Plantation established for the purpose of assisting in repatriating Indian Tamils from Sri Lanka. Its fertile soils located on well-drained slopes with geography that brings two monsoons per year with periods of fog and humid, cold weather, allow the sinensis variety to thrive. The tea is of sufficient quality and uniqueness to warrant being a registered geographical indication.

==History==

&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; was first planted in the Nilgiri area in 1835. The British had been using the area as a hill station and, as they had been seeking to create a source of tea outside of China, shipped seeds there, as well as various locations across southern India, for experimental plantings. Botanist George Samuel Perrottet planted the seeds in the governor&#x27;s garden in Ketti. Though they were not well-cared for, they did survive to be later propagated. The Thiashola estate, established in 1859, was one of the first tea estates in the region though commercial tea production began in 1862, and by 1904 there was over of tea under cultivation (second only to coffee which had three times as much land under cultivation). However, the plantations were largely operated by retired European military and civil servants, with labour from the native tribal people, all with little knowledge of tea production. Many early plantations failed but with the assistance of Chinese tea-makers brought in by the British, the industry was able to develop. European planters (of both coffee and tea) formed the Nilgiri Planters&#x27; Association which joined the United Planters Association of South India (UPASI) in 1894 to advocate for foreign interests in land and financing. In what would become one of the largest holdings in Nilgiri tea, Robert Stanes founded the United Nilgiri Tea Estates Company in 1922 from the Allada Valley estate, with the Chamraj and Rockland estates added in 1923, Devabetta in 1926, and Kodery in 1928.

Following Indian independence in 1947, the British began to sell their interests in tea gardens to Indian owners and the 1953 &quot;Tea Act&quot; put the tea industry under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Tea Board of India. While a tea auction was established in Coonoor in 1963, the Soviet bloc countries became the primary customers of tea from the region, taking about 80% of Nilgiri tea from the 1970s to 1990s. To accommodate Soviet preferences for mass-produced lower-cost teas, processing methods shifted to production of Crush, Tear, Curl and instant tea. More processing factories were built and cooperative agreements, such as Indcoserve, were made to accommodate small holders.
There was an increase in production during the 1970s as the Sirima–Shastri Pact brought in many repatriated Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka to the region and the Tamil Nadu Tea Plantation Corporation was established as a government-operated tea garden to provide for their transition. Of the small farm growers, the majority belong to the Badagas community. A crop diversification program initiated in the 1980s by the UPASI and the Tea Board saw many small holders move into the tea industry, resulting in nearly doubling the amount of land under tea cultivation by 2000. As the economies of the Soviet countries began to waver later in the 1980s, the Nilgiri Planters&#x27; Association led efforts to encourage estates and small growers to reform cultivation and processing practices to accommodate the preferences of the Western market. They tested new clonal varieties, moved to produce orthodox-rolled teas and white teas, began marketing single-origin estate teas, and encouraged maintaining certification of social and environmental practices. The Tea Board of India created a trademark for use on tea that is produced solely in Nilgiri and attained geographical indication status in 2008.

==Geography, cultivation and processing==
While &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; is cultivated in areas across the southern tip of India in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, Nilgiri tea, and is defined as that which is cultivated and processed in District of Nilgiris, constitutes about half this area&#x27;s total production. The Nilgiri Mountains form the border between the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, but are predominantly within the District of Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu. Located within the Western Ghats mountain range and the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the Nilgiri tea growing areas range between 1,000 and 2,500 metres in elevation and are exposed to the Southwest Monsoon weather from the Malabar Coast from June to September, followed by the Northeast Monsoon in October to November. The resulting alternating periods of fog and direct sunlight, as well as the South Western Ghats montane rain forests soils, described as lateritic loam, on the hillsides provides the high elevation drainage and conditions needed for &quot;Camellia sinensis var. sinensis&quot; to thrive.
Cultivation of tea in the Nilgiri region is conducted on few large corporate holdings, many small farms and the government-owned Tamil Nadu Tea Plantation Corporation. The small holders, typically under 1 hectare, vary widely in their practices, such as soil management, use of shade trees, ground cover, fertilizers and pesticides, plant age, etc. However, common to the region, plucking can occur approximately every 10 days almost all year round, typically 32 annual pluckings per plant. As opposed to the &quot;assamica&quot; variety, the &quot;sinensis&quot; variety requires a period of dormancy; in Nilgiris there is a short dormancy period during the cold temperatures of December–January. The first leaves after the dormancy are some of the plant&#x27;s most flavourful as they contain a higher concentration of defensive compounds secreted during the cold weather. This first harvest, plucked from January to March, is referred to as &quot;frost tea&quot; since it is collected in relatively cold but humid weather.

The larger estates own and operate their own processing facilities for drying, rolling, oxidizing and sorting the leaves. There are numerous independent or cooperatively-owned processing facilities (&quot;bought leaf factories&quot;) that buy green leaves from the small farms, with price and quality levels prescribed by the Tea Board of India. The processed leaves (&quot;made tea&quot;), that are not otherwise purchased on a contract basis, are sold at tea auctions in Coonoor, Coimbatore and Kochi. These factories predominantly produce black tea, but some also produce limited quantities of specialty white, green and oolong teas. Of the black tea produced, most use the crush, tear, curl (CTC) method though since the 2000s, as Argentina and Vietnam took more CTC market share, orthodox (e.g. rolled) teas have also been produced.

==Flavour and blends==
Nilgiri tea is known for its briskness, referring to lively fragrant flavours, a quality attributed to its climatic growing conditions. Nilgiri tea is variously described as being light but full-bodied or well-rounded in flavour, with fruit, like citrus, and floral notes. Its orthodox tea is compared to Ceylon teas which grow under similar conditions, such as two monsoons. Its light but fragrant liquor makes it useful for blending and it can be found in brands of bagged tea and blended with Assam tea in masala chai. Chemically, Nilgiri tea has been shown to be higher in Quinic acid and lower in tannins than other black teas.
Nilgiri tea is particularly useful for making iced tea since it retains its clarity as it cools, whereas other black teas will often become cloudy. Global commercial brands, such as Nestea, utilize Nilgiri tea in their iced tea products that use real tea.

<text>Aretas Blood (October 8, 1816 – November 24, 1897) was an American businessman from Vermont. He played an important role in the manufacture of early American railroad steam locomotives.

==Biography==
Blood was born in Weathersfield, Vermont, the son of Nathaniel Blood and Roxellana (Proctor) Blood. As a child he moved with his parents to Windsor, Vermont, where he attended the common schools. At the age of 17, as railroads began to be built in the United States, he was apprenticed as a blacksmith. After a few years learning the trade, he moved to Lowell, Massachusetts, where he was hired by the Locks and Canals Machine Shop. 1849 brought a new title to Blood at a different foundry, when he took the position of &quot;job hand&quot; at the Essex Machine Shop.

At the Essex Machine Shop Blood manufactured locomotive parts and he built up enough of a cash reserve that he was able to purchase a share of the Manchester Locomotive Works when it opened in 1853. Blood took over the shop superintendent position at Manchester in 1857 when the original superintendent, O. W. Bayley, left the company.

It was Blood&#x27;s opinion that the locomotives that Manchester produced were too light for the future needs of the railroads. When he took over in 1857, he quickly instigated more substantial locomotive construction at the shop. Through succeeding years, Blood acquired greater principal in the company until he was the majority owner.

Under Blood&#x27;s tenure, Manchester purchased the locomotive manufacturing business of Amoskeag Locomotive Works in 1859, and the fire engine manufacturing business from the same company in 1876. Blood died in 1897 in Manchester, New Hampshire, but Manchester Locomotive Works continued in his absence, building as many as 1,800 locomotives by 1901.

==Family life==
Blood married Lavinia Kendall on September 4, 1845. They had two daughters, Nora Blood and Elenora Blood. His wife Lavina founded the Manchester Women&#x27;s Aid and Relief Society in 1875. Blood and his wife are both interred at Valley Cemetery in Manchester, New Hampshire, in one of the cemetery&#x27;s 13 private mausoleums.

Blood&#x27;s daughter Elenora married Amoskeag Manufacturing Company president Frank Pierce Carpenter. Upon her death in 1910, Carpenter donated funds for an elaborate new building for the city&#x27;s public library.

<doc id="1093278" wikidata="Q3442540" url="?curid=1093278" title="Rosenberg Trio">
<text>The Rosenberg Trio is a Dutch jazz band consisting of lead guitarist Stochelo Rosenberg, rhythm guitarist Nous&#x27;che Rosenberg and bassist Nonnie Rosenberg. The band is influenced by Django Reinhardt, the gypsy jazz guitarist of the 1930s.

The group&#x27;s first album was &quot;Seresta&quot; in 1989. Notable events include the release in 2010 of &quot;Djangologists&quot; a DVD featuring a recording tribute to Django Reinhardt, and the 1992 live album &quot;The Rosenberg Trio: Live at the North Sea Jazz Festival,&quot; which captured the trio at an eclectic, youthful high point.

There is no exact date before 1989 when the Rosenberg Trio began playing under that name. Two of the Rosenbergs, Nous&#x27;che and Nonnie, are sons of Sani Rosenberg, a musician in the Dutch Gypsy community. Having been raised in a very musical family, they all were influenced by the music of Django Reinhardt.

Nous&#x27;che started playing with his cousin and buddy, Stochelo Rosenberg, when Stochelo was about 10 years old.

Nous&#x27;che and Stochelo both own Selmer guitars: Nous&#x27;che a &quot;D-hole&quot; and Stochelo an &quot;oval-hole&quot; (which was the model Django Reinhardt favoured).

Despite being surrounded by guitarists at a young age, Nonnie was encouraged to play the double bass in part of his family band. This compelled Nonnie to heavily practice, leading to his mastery of the instrument.

They have played with other influential musicians such as Angelo Debarre, Romane, Bireli Lagrene, and Peter Beets.

<text>State Route 144 (SR 144) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that runs through the Sycamore Canyon in Santa Barbara. It travels along Sycamore Canyon Road from its intersection with Alameda Padre Serra at the Five Points Roundabout to Stanwood Drive (State Route 192).

==Route description==
Route 144 begins at a roundabout called the Five Points Roundabout. From the roundabout, Route 144 continues north onto Sycamore Canyon Road, a winding two-lane road between steep hillsides to its terminus with State Route 192/Stanwood Drive.

The highway used to begin at U.S. Route 101&#x27;s interchange with Milpas Street. From there, SR 144 headed northwest on Milpas, a conventional 4-lane thoroughfare. In less than four blocks, however, the route then turned northeast on Mason Street, a two-lane residential street, passing by an elementary school and through a narrow bridge crossing the Sycamore Creek. Mason Street ends at Salinas Street; at this intersection, the route turned northwest onto Salinas Street, another two-lane street, until it reached the Five Points Roundabout. This portion of SR 144 between US 101 and the roundabout has since been relinquished (see below).

SR 144 is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

==History==
The State of California highway system&#x27;s first modern roundabout was constructed in 1992 at the intersections of Alameda Padre Serra, Montecito Street, Salinas Street, and Sycamore Canyon Road which carried Route 144. It was called Five Points Roundabout. The roundabout cost $250,000 to construct and was designed by consulting firm, Ourston &amp; Doctors. In 1999, the state law was changed to permit the relinquishment of Route 144 to the City of Santa Barbara. This was because the City of Santa Barbara wished to do several improvements on Milpas Street. One of these improvements includes the installation of a roundabout at the off-ramp from northbound Route 101, which Caltrans did not approve of. The roundabout controls traffic coming from Milpas Street, Carpinteria Street, and two ramps from and to Route 101. It is a significantly larger and bolder version of the Salinas Street roundabout, though the latter channels five streets. Currently, the portion from Route 101 to the Salinas traffic circle has been relinquished to the city but the portion on Sycamore Canyon remains as a state highway.

The final portion of Route 144 from Ranchito Vista Road to its junction with Route 192 had been closed off and on between 2005 and 2012 due to repetitive mudslides. In April 2012, crews completed repairs to the surrounding hillsides and reopened this segment of the highway.

<text>Bhuj () is a city and the headquarters of Kutch district in the Indian state of Gujarat.

==Etymology==
According to legend, Kutch (Kachchh) was ruled by the Nāga chieftains in the past. Sagai, a queen of Sheshapattana, who was married to King Bheria Kumar, rose up against Bhujanga, the last chieftain of Naga. After the battle, Bheria was defeated and Queen Sagai committed sati. The hill where they lived later came to be known as Bhujia Hill and the town at the foothill as Bhuj. Bhujang was later worshiped by the people as snake god, &quot;Bhujanga&quot;, and a temple was constructed to revere him.

==History==

Bhuj was founded by Rao Hamir in 1510 and was made the capital of Kutch (kachchh) by Rao Khengarji I in 1549. Its foundation stone as state capital was formally laid on Vikram Samvat 1604 Maagha 5th (approx. 25 January 1548). From 1590 onwards, when Rao was forced to acknowledge the Mughal supremacy, Bhuj came to be known as Suleiman Nagar amongst Muslims. The city&#x27;s walls were built by Rao Godji I in 1723, and the Bhujia Fort by Devkaran Seth in Rao Deshalji I&#x27;s time (1718 - 1741).

Bhuj has been attacked six times. In two instances, the defense was successful and in four other instances, the defense failed. In 1728, an attack by Sarbuland Khan, Mughal Viceroy of Gujarat, was repulsed by Rao Deshalji I, and, in 1765 Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro was, by a timely display of the strength of the fortifications, induced to withdraw. During the civil troubles of the reign of the Rao Rayadhan III, Bhuj was thrice taken, by Meghji Seth in 1786, by Hansraj in 1801, and by Fateh Muhammad in 1808. On 26 March 1819, the hill fort of Bhujia was captured by a British detachment under Sir William Keir.

In 1818, Bhuj had a population of 20,000 people. The earthquake on 16 June 1819 destroyed nearly 7000 houses with a loss of an estimated 1140 human lives. About one-third of the buildings that escaped ruin were heavily damaged, and the north face of the town wall was leveled with the ground.

The British garrison at Bhuj peaked in 1826 with nearly 1400 British troops (685 infantry, 543 dragoons, 90 foot artillery and 74 horse artillery) supported by over 5000 Indian soldiers. Amongst the highest profile British figures during this time was Alexander Burnes who was based here between 1826 and 1829.

In 1837, Bhuj is said to have had a population of 30,000, including 6,000 Muslims.

After independence of India in 1947, Kutch State acceded unto the dominion of India and was constituted an independent commissionaire, Kutch State. In 1956, Kutch State was merged with Bombay state, which in 1960 was divided into the new linguistic states of Gujarat and Maharashtra, with Kutch becoming part of Gujarat state as Kutch district. Bhuj is the district headquarters of Kutch District, the largest district in India.

On 21 July 1956 as well as on 26 January 2001, the city suffered great losses of life and property due to earthquakes. Many parts of Bhuj were demolished due to the extensive damage, whilst others were repaired. There has been great progress in rebuilding the City since the 2001 earthquake, with considerable improvements to roads, transportation, and infrastructure.

Bhuj is home to one of the first Swaminarayan Sampraday temples, built in 1822. Bhuj temple is one of the six original temples built during the earthly presence of the Lord Swaminarayan. The devotees living in Bhuj including Gangaram Mull, Sundarji Suthar and Hirji Suthar requested Lord to construct a temple at Bhuj. Lord instructed Vaishnavanand Swami to construct the temple, and Lord himself installed the murti of Lord NarNarayan Dev in Bhuj on VS 1879 on the 5th day of the bright half of the month of Vaishakh (Friday 15 May 1823 AD).

==Geography==
Bhuj has an average elevation of 110 metres (360 feet). On the eastern side of the city is a hill known as Bhujia Hill, on which there is a Bhujia Fort, that separates Bhuj city and Madhapar town ( considered one of the richest villages in Asia ). It has two lakes namely Hamirsar Lake and Deshadsar (દેેેશળસર).

==Climate==
Bhuj has a hot semi-desert climate (&quot;BSh&quot;). Although annual rainfall &quot;averages&quot; around the variability is among the highest in the world with coefficient of variation of around sixty per cent – among the few comparably variable climates in the world being the Line Islands of Kiribati, the Pilbara coast of Western Australia, the sertão of Northeastern Brazil, and the Cape Verde islands. Recorded annual rainfall has been as low as in 1899 – yet in 1926 a total of fell and in the incomplete year of 1959 rainfall exceeded , of which fell during Bhuj&#x27;s wettest-ever month of July 1959.

Apart from the cool mornings of the &quot;winter&quot; season from December to February, temperatures are very warm to sweltering throughout the year, which further reduces the effectiveness of the erratic monsoonal rainfall. During the &quot;hot&quot; season from mid-March to mid-June, temperatures of are frequent, whilst during the monsoon season they exceed with high humidity except during rainy spells accompanied by cooler temperatures but oppressive humidity.

*The Fort: The old city was surrounded by a fort wall with five major gates (Mahadev, Patvadi, Sarpat, Bhid and Vaniya Vad) and one small gate known as &quot;Chhathi Bari&quot; (sixth window). The fort wall is 35 feet high and four feet thick, and during its use was armed with fifty-one guns. Much of the fort wall has either fallen down or been demolished, due to the damage sustained in the 2001 earthquake and the city&#x27;s redevelopment.

<text>Barbara Dare (born February 27, 1963) is an American former pornographic actress. She was one of the industry&#x27;s initial contract performers with Essex Video and Vivid Entertainment and is an AVN and XRCO Hall of Fame inductee.

==Personal life==
Dare was born in Wichita Falls, Texas. After her father, a dentist, left the Air Force, the family moved to Wayne, New Jersey. She was raised in the Jewish faith. Early in her professional career, Dare self-identified as a lesbian, having personal relationships with women.

Dare spent several years addicted to drugs, including heroin. She got sober and became a Certified Addiction and Substance Abuse Counselor.

==Career==
Dare began appearing in adult films in the mid-1980s after meeting people who were involved in the adult film industry at Plato&#x27;s Retreat and also made appearances in magazines such as &quot;Hustler&quot;, &quot;Swank&quot;, and &quot;High Society&quot;. In 1989, she joined fellow adult film actress Stephanie Rage as authors of a monthly article for &quot;Swank&quot;.

Dare was one of the top adult film stars of the 1980s. She appeared in scenes with several (at the time) top adult films stars, including Tracey Adams and Ginger Lynn. She became one of the first women in the industry to sign an exclusivity contract with Essex Video for 10 movies a year and an annual salary of $150,000 and would later leave that studio to sign with Vivid Entertainment and become one of the earliest Vivid Girls. Dare&#x27;s final film was &quot;Bratgirl&quot; (1992); she retired in 1994.

Jerry Butler stated in his autobiography that Dare had a &quot;commanding screen presence&quot; while on set, in spite of her smaller physical stature.

Dare also worked as a stripper, commanding a $10,000 weekly salary.

===Appearances===
Dare was interviewed in 1987 for the episode of the television news series &quot;Frontline&quot; regarding the death of Shauna Grant.

She also had minor roles in mainstream productions such as the Roy Scheider and Ann-Margret film &quot;52 Pick-Up&quot; in 1986 and the live-action/animated comedy-horror B-movie &quot;Evil Toons&quot; (where she was credited as &quot;Stacey Nix&quot;) in 1992.

In the August 1992 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot;, Dare was profiled in their annual feature &quot;Women We Love&quot;.

<text>Nottingham Girls&#x27; High School is a private day school for girls aged 3–19, situated just north of Nottingham city centre. The school was founded in 1875 and forms part of the Girls&#x27; Day School Trust.

==History==
Nottingham Girls&#x27; High School was founded on 14 September 1875 by the Girls&#x27; Public Day School Company (now the Girls&#x27; Day School Trust). It was among the first such schools opened outside London.

Before the 1870s, education for girls in Nottingham was fixed by social class, with limited opportunities for working-class girls to receive any post-primary schooling. Much of the development in girls&#x27; education was due to the work of feminist reformers. Nottingham Girls&#x27; High School was originally in Nottingham&#x27;s Oxford Street, with Mrs Bolton as Headmistress, before relocating to its current location in Arboretum Street, in a building that had been a lace manufacturer&#x27;s house. When it first opened, it had 34 pupils, but by the time of its relocation that had increased to 146.

The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 caused the school to move to two separate locations: Ramsdale Park and Daybrook. The Arboretum Street buildings were used to accommodate the South Notts Hussars until 1944–1945, when the school was able to move back. Ten years later, as the school celebrated its 80th anniversary, the number of pupils reached 800.

The 1970s saw significant building expansion at the school and in 1975 the school marked its centenary. On 18 May 1973, the Milford Building was officially opened by the Duchess of Gloucester and in 1978, the Duke of Edinburgh opened the Edinburgh Library.

In 1995, a house system was introduced and named after the first four headmistresses of the school: Bolton, Hastings, Luxton and Skeel. The Bowering Sports Hall was opened by Richard Bacon in 1998 and eleven years later, in May 2009, the new Sixth Form Centre opened. In 2016 the old dining hall building was demolished and replaced by a performing arts centre, The Squire Performing Arts Centre, after an alumna, Dame Rosemary Squire.

In 2020, a nursery was opened by the education innovator Shonette Bason-Wood.

In 2023, the newly expanded and refurbished 1875 Sports Centre was opened by Lydia Greenway OBE. 

Over its history, the school has been headed by 13 headmistresses and one acting headmistress. Julie Keller is the current Head.

==Facilities==
Originally placed in a group of Victorian houses, the school has since expanded considerably. Its professional-grade performing arts centre, The Squire Performing Arts Centre is regularly used for music and drama productions at the school and can be hired for non-school conferences, meetings and performances. It provides a source of education for girls interested in all aspects of the performing arts and theatre production work, from music to lighting, sound and costume. 
There is a Sixth Form Centre adjoining The Squire PAC, with modern classrooms, a kitchen area and tuck shop, and an outside garden and decking area. There are two libraries – one in the Senior School and one in the Junior School – along with a lecture theatre, drama studio, music building, dining hall, and common rooms for the lower and upper schools. The Infant and Junior schools are on the same site, based in the buildings on Balmoral Road.

In recent years, the school has invested in IT provision and training. Girls from Year 4 upwards are issued with a personal iPad; younger girls share iPad facilities. Classrooms have interactive whiteboards with Google Classroom, and there is digital equipment for use across the curriculum, such as cameras and microscopes. DT and food rooms have been refurbished to include a 3D printer, among other high-tech equipment.

The school grounds include all-weather courts, grass pitches, a gymnasium, and the recently refurbished and expanded 1875 Sports Centre which includes the sports hall, fitness studio and state-of the art fitness suite. The outdoor learning area comprises a climbing wall. Upnah Wood has plentiful outdoor learning equipment, such as low ropes, a fire pit and a pizza oven.

==Houses==
The four school houses are named after the four first headmistresses of the school; Bolton, Hastings, Luxton and Skeel. In recent years, the Junior School has also adopted the House system, so that girls can be in the same House as siblings further up the school. The House system includes inter-house competitions and sports events.

==Academic structure==
There were 738 students in the 2019–2020 academic year, of whom 151 were in the sixth form studying for A Level. The sixth form is overseen by a Head of Sixth Form. There are usually around 280 girls in the Junior School, which has its own Head. Nottingham Girls&#x27; High School is among the largest of the 23 schools and 2 academies run through the Girls&#x27; Day School Trust, which has promoted education of girls since its foundation in 1872.

==Student Leadership ==
A team of committed Sixth Formers are appointed to a range of positions each year. This includes a Head Girl and two Deputy Head Girls, who work closely with the Senior Leadership Team on a range of projects and strategies. Included in this group is a series of Prefect House Captains who oversee all House events.

<doc id="1093310" wikidata="Q901218" url="?curid=1093310" title="Fischer indole synthesis">
<text>The Fischer indole synthesis is a chemical reaction that produces the aromatic heterocycle indole from a (substituted) phenylhydrazine and an aldehyde or ketone under acidic conditions. The reaction was discovered in 1883 by Emil Fischer. Today antimigraine drugs of the triptan class are often synthesized by this method.

This reaction can be catalyzed by Brønsted acids such as HCl, H2SO4, polyphosphoric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid or Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride, zinc chloride, and aluminium chloride.

Several reviews have been published.

==Reaction mechanism==
The reaction of a (substituted) phenylhydrazine with a carbonyl (aldehyde or ketone) initially forms a phenylhydrazone which isomerizes to the respective enamine (or &#x27;ene-hydrazine&#x27;). After protonation, a cyclic [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement occurs producing a diimine. The resulting diimine forms a cyclic aminoacetal (or &quot;aminal&quot;), which under acid catalysis eliminates NH3, resulting in the energetically favorable aromatic indole.

Isotopic labelling studies show that the aryl nitrogen (N1) of the starting phenylhydrazine is incorporated into the resulting indole.

==Buchwald modification==
Via a palladium-catalyzed reaction, the Fischer indole synthesis can be effected by cross-coupling aryl bromides and hydrazones. This result supports the previously proposed intermediacy as hydrazone intermediates in the classical Fischer indole synthesis. These &quot;N&quot;-arylhydrazones undergo exchange with other ketones, expanding the scope of this method.

==Application==
*A variant of the Fischer indolization reaction, termed the interrupted Fischer indolization by Garg and coworkers, has been used in the total synthesis of akuammiline natural products. The method has also been used in medicinal chemistry.
*Indometacin preparation.
*Triptan synthesis
*Iprindole synthesis (phenylhydrazine + suberone → 2,3-Cycloheptenoindole).

<doc id="1093324" wikidata="Q7327241" url="?curid=1093324" title="Richard Landwehr">
<text>Richard Landwehr is the author of numerous books about the Waffen-SS, particularly the foreign volunteers, providing accounts of these men, their formations, and their battles. He has been producing the magazine &quot;Siegrunen&quot; on the same topic for over 30 years.

In his 1997 book &#x27;Revolutionary Armies in the Modern Era: A Revisionist Approach&#x27; (described as &quot;too flawed to be recommended as an undergraduate text&quot;), historian S.P. MacKenzie describes Landwehr as an &quot;extreme admirer [from] the fringes of the far-right.&quot; MacKenzie connects Landwehr with the contemporary Waffen-SS historical revisionism. Commenting on this trend, Mackenzie writes that &quot;as older generation of Waffen-SS scribes has died off, a new, post-war cadre of writers has done much to perpetuate the image of the force as a revolutionary European army&quot; and includes Landwehr in this group.

<text>In combinatorial mathematics, Stanley&#x27;s reciprocity theorem, named after MIT mathematician Richard P. Stanley, states that a certain functional equation is satisfied by the generating function of any rational cone (defined below) and the generating function of the cone&#x27;s interior.

== Definitions ==
A rational cone is the set of all &quot;d&quot;-tuples

:(&quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;d&quot;) 

of nonnegative integers satisfying a system of inequalities

:formula_1

where &quot;M&quot; is a matrix of integers. A &quot;d&quot;-tuple satisfying the corresponding &quot;strict&quot; inequalities, i.e., with &quot;&gt;&quot; rather than &quot;≥&quot;, is in the &quot;interior&quot; of the cone.

The generating function of such a cone is

:formula_2

The generating function &quot;F&quot;int(&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;d&quot;) of the interior of the cone is defined in the same way, but one sums over &quot;d&quot;-tuples in the interior rather than in the whole cone.

It can be shown that these are rational functions.

== Formulation ==
Stanley&#x27;s reciprocity theorem states that for a rational cone as above, we have

:formula_3

Matthias Beck and Mike Develin have shown how to prove this by using the calculus of residues.

Stanley&#x27;s reciprocity theorem generalizes Ehrhart-Macdonald reciprocity for Ehrhart polynomials of rational convex polytopes.

<text>Örvar-Oddr ( , &quot;Arrow-Odd&quot; or &quot;Arrow&#x27;s Point&quot;) is a legendary hero about whom an anonymous Icelander wrote a &quot;fornaldarsaga&quot; in the latter part of the 13th century. &quot;Örvar-Odds saga&quot;, the Saga of Örvar-Odd, became very popular and contains old legends and songs. He also appears in &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; and, concerning the battle on Samsø, in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;.

==Plot summary==

=== Prophecy ===
Oddr was the son of Grímr Loðinkinni and the grandson of Ketill Hængr (both of whom have their own sagas) of Hålogaland. When he was an infant, a völva predicted that he would be killed by his own horse, Faxi, at the place where he was born, at the age of three hundred (which may signify 360, as the unit in question is probably the &quot;long hundred&quot; commonly used in medieval Germanic languages, denoting 120 rather than 100).

In order to thwart the prediction, he killed his horse, buried it deep in the ground and left his home intending never to return again. As he was leaving, his father gave him some magic arrows (&quot;Gusisnautar&quot;) which soon earned him the cognomen &quot;arrow&quot;. After a voyage to Finnmark, Bjarmaland, Holmgård, Constantinople and Jotunheim, he fought successfully against several Vikings.

=== Hjalmar and Angantyr ===

However, when he encountered the Swedish champion Hjalmar, he met his match. The fight was even and the two warriors not only became friends, but entered sworn brotherhood.

The two heroes fought many battles together (for more see Hjalmar), until after the famous battle of Samsø against the sons of Arngrim, Örvar-Oddr had to bring the dead Hjalmar (killed by Angantyr) to Uppsala and his betrothed Ingeborg, the daughter of the Swedish king.

Örvar-Oddr travelled in the South fighting against the corsairs of the Mediterranean, he was baptised in Sicily, was shipwrecked and arrived alone in the Holy Land.

=== Ögmundr Flóki ===
Oddr sought vengeance against Ögmundr Flóki (&quot;Ogmund Tussock&quot; or Ögmundr &#x27;tuft&#x27;; aka Ögmundr Eyþjófsbani or &quot;Eythjof&#x27;s-killer&quot;) for the murder of his blood-brother Þórðr stafnglamr (Thord Prow-Gleam). He and his crew headed toward a fjord in Helluland (&quot;Slabland&quot;), where Ögmundr was to be found, according to Oddr&#x27;s half-giant son, Vignir. During their voyage, they encounter two huge sea-creatures that resembled islands:

There had been five men sent to disembark on what they thought was an island, but the Heather-Back (&quot;lyngbakr&quot;) plunged into sea, and those men perished. However, the group had safely sailed through the jaws of the Sea-Reek (&quot;hafgufa&quot;), the other monster that Ögmundr had sent by magic to intercept the party.

=== Barkman ===
Oddr becomes Barkman (&quot;naefrmaðr&quot;, &#x27;birch bark man&#x27;), a sort of wildman dressed in bark. He arrived in Hunaland and meets King Herrauðr, where his true identity was soon revealed due to his heroic actions. After defeating the king of Bjalkaland (&quot;pelt country&quot;), who used to pay tribute to the king of Hunaland, he married the Herrauðr&#x27; daughter Silkisif and became the next king.

=== Death ===
After all this, Oddr became homesick and went back home. Walking over the grave of Faxi, he mocked the old prophecy, but tripped over the skull of a horse from which a snake appeared. The snake bit him and he died.

==Analysis==
The saga includes several stories, such as the voyage of Ottar from Hålogaland to Bjarmaland, the legend of Hjalmar&#x27;s foster-brother (originally named &quot;Söte&quot;), Starkaðr, Ketil Höing, Odysseus and Polyphemus, Sigurd Jorsalfare and the Rus&#x27; ruler Oleg of Novgorod (the attack on Bjalkaland).

The motif of Örvar-Oddr&#x27;s mocking the prophecy and death has parallels in the Primary Chronicle, which describes the manner of the death of Oleg (also of Varangian origin) in similar terms. Oleg&#x27;s legendary death from &quot;the skull of a horse&quot; became the subject of one of the best known ballads in the Russian language, published by Alexander Pushkin in 1826. Another variant on the same theme is found in the legend of Sir Robert de Shurland on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, England, recorded in the 17th century, and which in 1837 inspired one of the popular &quot;Ingoldsby Legends&quot; of Richard Barham.

Ögmundr Flóki owned a cloak made from the beards of kings he collected, as did the giant of Mont Saint-Michel, enemy of King Arthur in Brittany.

== Örvar-Oddr and Norwegian Rugii ==
Örvar-Oddr spent his childhood and youth in Berurjóðr near Eikund (Eigersund). In the saga, Örvar-Oddr responds to the question of the priestess about who raised him in such folly that he refuses to worship the highest god and leader of the Aesir, Odin:

&quot;I was raised by Ingjaldr in my childhood, who ruled Eikund and inhabited Jadar.&quot;

* Eikundasund, Eykundasund. In: Johann Samuel Ersch, Johann Gottfried Gruber (Eds.): General Encyclopedia of Sciences and Arts. Section 1: A–G. Part 32: Ei–Eisen. F. A. Brockhaus, Leipzig 1839, p. 209 (resolver.sub.uni-goettingen.de gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de).

At the beginning of the 19th century, historians, literary scholars, and geographers believed that Oddr&#x27;s fate was connected to the Norwegian Rogaland. In the General Encyclopedia of Sciences and Arts, it is pointed out that in the Örvar-Odds saga, it concerns the island of Eigerøy.

The settlement of Berurjóðr (Berglud), the island of Eikund (Eigerøy), and the historical region of Jadar (Jæren) are located in the Norwegian province of Rogaland, which was inhabited by Rugii in the Middle Ages. Egersund is the bay between the island of Eigerøy and the mainland, which was called &quot;Eikundarsund&quot; in the Middle Ages. The island of Eigerøy was called &quot;Eikund&quot; in the Middle Ages. The name of this island indicates rich deposits of high-quality oak wood used for shipbuilding, as the word &quot;eik&quot; is the Norwegian word for &quot;oak.&quot; Eikund and Eikundarsund were some of the oldest geographical names in Norway and are already found in the Óláfs saga helga, written in the 13th century by the Icelandic author Snorri Sturluson.

<text>Robert John Gaudio (born November 17, 1942) is an American songwriter, singer, musician, and record producer, and the keyboardist and backing vocalist of the pop/rock band the Four Seasons. Gaudio wrote or co-wrote the vast majority of the band&#x27;s music, including hits like &quot;Sherry&quot; and &quot;December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)&quot;, as well as &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; for Valli. Though he no longer performs with the group, Gaudio and lead singer Frankie Valli remain co-owners of the Four Seasons brand.

== Early career ==
Born in the Bronx, New York, Gaudio was raised in Bergenfield, New Jersey, where he attended Bergenfield High School. His mother worked for the publishing house Prentice Hall and his father in a paper factory. He showed an interest in music and studied piano with Sal Mosca.

He grew up in more comfortable middle-class surroundings than the other members of the Four Seasons, which caused some tension and differences early on. He was a cerebral person, interested in reading and learning. He stayed out of trouble and had a mild manner, which proved useful during negotiations throughout his career.

He rose to musical fame at the age of 15 as a member of The Royal Teens, for whom he co-wrote the hit &quot;Short Shorts&quot;. In 1958, while he and the group were promoting the single, they met Frankie Valli and his group the Four Lovers as they prepared to perform on a local television program. Wearying of touring, Gaudio left the Royal Teens soon afterward.

One year after he ceased touring, Gaudio joined the Four Lovers. While commercial success was elusive, the group was kept busy with session work (with Bob Crewe as the producer), and a string of performances at night clubs and lounges.

== The Four Seasons Era ==

In 1960, after a failed audition at a bowling establishment in Union Township, called the &quot;4 Seasons&quot;, songwriter/pianist Gaudio shook hands with lead singer Valli and formed the Four Seasons Partnership, and Gaudio, Valli, Tommy DeVito, and Nick Massi became The Four Seasons.

Gaudio wrote the Seasons&#x27; first No. 1 hit, &quot;Sherry&quot;, 15 minutes before a group rehearsal in 1962. With producer Bob Crewe often assisting with lyrics, Gaudio wrote a string of subsequent hits for the Seasons, including &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, &quot;Walk Like a Man&quot;, &quot;Dawn (Go Away)&quot;, &quot;Ronnie&quot;, &quot;Rag Doll&quot;, &quot;Save It for Me&quot;, &quot;Big Man in Town&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot;, &quot;Girl Come Running&quot;, &quot;Beggin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; (the first big success under Valli&#x27;s name as a solo performer). Crewe/Gaudio compositions also became major hits for other artists, including the Tremeloes (&quot;Silence Is Golden&quot;, originally the B-side of the Four Seasons&#x27; &quot;Rag Doll&quot;), The Osmonds (&quot;The Proud One&quot;, originally recorded as a Valli solo single) and the Walker Brothers (&quot;The Sun Ain&#x27;t Gonna Shine Anymore&quot;, another Valli single).

After the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album was released in June 1967, Gaudio saw the pop music market changing, and sought to position the Four Seasons into the trend of socially conscious music. One evening he went to the Bitter End in Greenwich Village and saw Jake Holmes performing. Gaudio was taken with Holmes&#x27; song &quot;Genuine Imitation Life&quot; and decided to base a Four Seasons album upon it. With Holmes as his new lyricist, &quot;The Genuine Imitation Life Gazette&quot; album was released in January 1969. The album was a commercial failure and symbolized the end of the Four Seasons&#x27; first period of success. The appreciation of &quot;The Genuine Imitation Life Gazette&quot; has grown over the years, and it was re-released on CD (minus the newspaper cover) in the 1990s by Rhino in the U.S. and Ace in the UK. Gaudio and Holmes also wrote and produced Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Watertown&quot;.

Gaudio withdrew from touring in the early 1970s, a decision that fellow band member Joe Long indicated was due to stage fright and introversion. Lee Shapiro, who had idolized Gaudio as a child, would be hired as Gaudio&#x27;s replacement, while Gaudio continued to produce and write songs for the Four Seasons and continued to be credited as a full member.

In 1975 Gaudio wrote &quot;Who Loves You&quot; and &quot;December 1963 (Oh, What a Night)&quot; with his future wife Judy Parker. The Bob and Judy songs became big hits for a reconstituted Four Seasons group (only Valli was left of the original lineup; Gaudio stopped touring with them in 1971 to concentrate on writing and producing).

Gaudio, Tommy DeVito, Frankie Valli and Nick Massi the original members of The Four Seasons were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999. and the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2017 (which also inducted Long).

== Other activity ==
In addition to his work for the Seasons and Sinatra, he wrote and/or produced for Michael Jackson, Barry Manilow, Diana Ross, Eric Carmen, Nancy Sinatra, Peabo Bryson, and Roberta Flack. In particular, he produced six complete albums for Neil Diamond, and the movie soundtrack albums for Diamond&#x27;s &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;. Gaudio also produced the hit &quot;You Don&#x27;t Bring Me Flowers&quot; for Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond, a duet that reached the top of &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 1978, for which he received a Grammy Award nomination.

In the 1990s Gaudio moved to Nashville and produced recordings for Canadian country artist George Fox, among others. He lured Neil Diamond to Nashville to record the album &quot;Tennessee Moon&quot;. In recent years Gaudio has focused on musical theater, writing the music for the 2001 London West End production of &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;.

Gaudio was instrumental in mounting &quot;Jersey Boys&quot;, a musical play based on the lives of the Four Seasons, which ran at the La Jolla Playhouse through January 2, 2005, and then opened on Broadway on November 6, 2005, to mostly positive reviews. In 2006, the play won four Tony Awards, including Best Musical. In 2007, it won a Grammy in the Best Musical Show Album category.

Gaudio was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1995.

On February 3, 2009, Gaudio received his high school diploma, 50 years after dropping out of Bergenfield High School.

On May 12, 2012, Gaudio received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor for his commitment to many humanitarian causes.

On June 20, 2014, Warner Bros. released the film version of &quot;Jersey Boys&quot;, directed by Clint Eastwood, in which Gaudio was portrayed by Erich Bergen. &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; credits a then-teenaged Joe Pesci with introducing Gaudio to Tommy DeVito.

On July 1, 2014, Rhino Entertainment released &quot;Audio with a G&quot;, the first compilation of the music composed by Bob Gaudio as performed by the Four Seasons, Frank Sinatra, Diana Ross, The Temptations, Cher, Roberta Flack, Nina Simone, Jerry Butler, Chuck Jackson and others.

Gaudio remains active in managing the Four Seasons catalog and consults with Primary Wave, a company Gaudio partnered with to manage the catalog in 2020, on each licensing request, with a spokesman for Primary Wave noting that Gaudio was more hands-on than most musicians in how he wanted the Four Seasons&#x27; music to be used, especially in advertising.

In 2022, Gaudio and Peggy Farina received credits as a co-songwriter for the song &quot;Burning&quot; by Yeah Yeah Yeahs, which is 
driven by a piano loop inspired by their Four Seasons song &quot;Beggin&#x27;.&quot; The lyric, &quot;Lay your red hand on me, baby,&quot; is an allusion to the opening line in &quot;Beggin&#x27;,&quot; &quot;put your lovin&#x27; hand out, baby.&quot; The song gained attention after it was used for the film &quot;Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gaudio was married to Brit Irene Olsen until the early 1970s. They had two daughters, Lisa Gaudio and Danielle Lahlezar, and a son, Shannon Gaudio. Near the end of their marriage, the two wrote three songs together, all of which have titles pertaining to a disconnected couple. Brit Olsen died in 1989, age 47. Gaudio acknowledged: &quot;I am hardly a model father, or grandfather for that matter.&quot; Lahlezar conceived the 2008 album &quot;Jersey Babys&quot;, a Four Seasons album featuring the band&#x27;s hits rearranged as instrumentals for young children&#x27;s listening.

By 1975, Gaudio was in a relationship with Judy Parker, who would become his wife and regular songwriting collaborator. &quot;December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)&quot; is, according to Gaudio, based upon an early encounter between the two. The two married in 1981 and remained so until Parker died September 14, 2017.

<text>John Cooke (1824–1882) was one of the principals of Cooke Locomotive Works, one of the constituent companies that made up American Locomotive Company in the merger of 1901.

Cooke was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, but sought his fortune in the United States. While a teenager, he was apprenticed to Thomas Rogers (who founded the Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works). His apprenticeship worked out so well for the two of them that he was promoted to shop superintendent by 1843, a position he held until 1852.

When he left Rogers&#x27; employ, Cooke formed a partnership with Charles Danforth. The two founded the new locomotive manufacturing company of Danforth, Cooke and Company in Paterson, New Jersey. Cooke&#x27;s company became a serious competitor in the locomotive building business. After Cooke&#x27;s death in 1882, his company, by that time renamed to Cooke Locomotive Works, became one of the constituent companies that made up the American Locomotive Company in the merger of 1901.

<text>Ace the Bat-Hound is a superhero dog appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He is commonly featured as the canine crime-fighting partner of Batman and as an ally of other animal superheroes, such as Krypto, Streaky, and the Legion of Super-Pets.

The character made his cinematic debut in the animated film &quot;DC League of Super-Pets&quot;, which was released in the United States on July 29, 2022.

==Publication history==

Ace debuted in &quot;Batman&quot; #92 (June 1955) and was created by writer Bill Finger and artist Sheldon Moldoff. Ace&#x27;s introduction followed on Krypto the Superdog&#x27;s debut in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #210 (March 1955), and by German Shepherd Dogs from detective films and serials, such as Rin Tin Tin and Ace the Wonder Dog.

Ace, along with Batwoman, Bat-Girl, and Bat-Mite, was retired from the comic in 1964, when editor Julius Schwartz instituted a &quot;New Look&quot; Batman that shed some of the sillier elements in the series.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
Ace was a German Shepherd Dog originally owned by an engraver named John Wilker. He was found by Batman and Robin after his master was kidnapped by a gang of counterfeiters. Batman used Ace to try to locate Wilker. Because he had already placed a large number of &quot;lost dog&quot; announcements for Ace in his civilian identity of Bruce Wayne, he was concerned that anyone recognizing Ace might make the connection between Bruce Wayne and Batman. To forestall that problem, he improvised a hood-like mask for the dog that incorporated the bat-emblem as a dog tag. Ace was subsequently christened the Bat-Hound by a criminal that the dog helped Batman to apprehend.

Wilker later took a new job that made it difficult for him to take care of Ace, so he left the dog to Bruce Wayne. Wilker was never aware that Bruce Wayne was Batman.

An early case involved Ace tracking down a mentally unhinged ancient weapons expert. At one point, Ace acquired superpowers thanks to Bat-Mite, but this was short-lived. He did have his own training. For example; his specialized radio collar, when activated, told him to don his own mask (via a hands-free device) and track down Batman and Robin. Ace was used less and less over time, and for various reasons. When Bruce was overcome with night terrors, Robin suggested that Ace sleep beside him.

Ace disappeared from the &quot;Batman&quot; comics after Julius Schwartz took over as editor in 1964. His last appearance was a cameo in a story where Batman had lost his fighting spirit.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;===
The original Ace appears as a resident of Limbo in &quot;Animal Man&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, while a new dog character based on him is introduced. He is a former guide dog who Batman adopts following the death of his owner Black Wolf.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In The New 52 continuity reboot, Damian Wayne adopts a Great Dane named Titus. Writer Peter Tomasi considered naming the character Ace, but decided against it.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
A new version of Ace is introduced following &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, where it is depicted as a former guard dog of the Joker.

<text>The [[Chief minister (India)|chief minister]] of [[Karnataka]] is the chief executive officer of the government of the Indian state of Karnataka. As per the Constitution of India, the governor of Karnataka is the state&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; head, but &quot;de facto&quot; executive authority rests with the chief minister, a template applicable to all other Indian states. Following elections to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, the governor usually invites the political party (or a coalition of political parties) with a majority of assembly seats to form the government in the state. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the assembly. Given that he/she has the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister&#x27;s term is for five years, renewable, and is subject to no term limits.

Historically, this office replaced that of the dewan of Mysore of the erstwhile Kingdom of Mysore with India&#x27;s constitution into a republic. Since 1947, there have been a total of twenty-three chief ministers of Mysore (as the state was known before 1 November 1973) and Karnataka. A majority of them belonged to the Indian National Congress (INC) party, including the inaugural officeholder K. C. Reddy. The longest-serving chief minister, D. Devaraj Urs, held the office for over seven years in the 1970s. INC&#x27;s Veerendra Patil had the largest gap between two terms (over eighteen years). One chief minister, H. D. Deve Gowda, went on to become the eleventh prime minister of India, whereas another, B. D. Jatti, served as the country&#x27;s fifth vice president. B. S. Yediyurappa who was the first chief minister from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), served as the chief minister of the state for four terms in 2007, 2008, 2018 and 2019, the only one to do so. S. R. Bommai served as the chief minister representing the Janata Parivar, whose son Basavaraj Bommai became chief minister representing the BJP in 2021 becoming the second father-son duo to serve office after HD Deve Gowda and HD Kumaraswamy. There have been six instances of president&#x27;s rule in Karnataka, most recently from 2007 to 2008.

<text>Peoples Party of Arunachal is a regional political party in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. It was founded in September 1977 by Bakin Pertin, Oken Lego and L. Wanglat as president, Vice President and General Secretary of the party. Tomo Riba resigned from PK Thungon government of Congress Party and joined PPA as Vice President of the Party. Currently, Kamen Ringu is the chairman of the party. They were in power in Arunachal until all of their MLAs defected back to Indian National Congress.

On 16 September 2016, 43 MLAs from the ruling party, under the CM Pema Khandu, left Indian National Congress to join People&#x27;s Party of Arunachal party, in alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party.

== History ==

Following the election of Pertin as Member of Parliament, a meeting was organized in Pasighat in April 1977. In this meeting, the PPA constitution was drafted under the Chairmanship of L.Wanglat who joined Bakin Pertin and Oken Lego. He was Congress General Secretary of Tirap District and also Pradesh Organiser of Seva Dal in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. The People Party of Arunachal for formed. Pertin became the president of the new party. Whilst being the leader of PPA, Pertin was continued to be linked to the Janata Party then in government in Delhi. Pertin had the status of being an &#x27;associated&#x27; member of the Janata Party. He later broke his links with the Janata Party after Congress Party led by CM P.K Thungon merged en-blocked with the Janata Party. Bakin Partin joined INC as an associate member in Parliament while still keeping PPA in Arunachal Pradesh. He was close to Indira Gandhi. Bakin Partin was the first MP to demand the dissolution of the House and called for fresh election 

In 1979, PPA MLA and former Congress Minister Tomo Riba became the first PPA Chief Minister. It was a short-lived government spanning from September 1979 to November 1979 with a total of 47 days. A general election was announced in 1980, Arunachal Pradesh State election was included with the general election to elect the Union Territory MLAs. PPA of Tomo Riba and INC of PK Thungon won 13 each in a house of 30 seats. The rest 6 seats were PPA supported independent members. With Indira Gandhi coming back to Power PPA the first associate of INC became the first victim with its President Bakin Partin losing his MP seat from 2 East MP Constituency with most of its members and independent joining INC Party in Arunachal Pradesh. After this party had little success in Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly.

In 1996, Tomo Riba left the party and joined Gegong Apang camp. Both the leaders had months of deliberation before Tomo Riba and Gegong Apang patched up their political differences. Tomo Riba contested the West Parliamentary election as independent candidate 1996 and became member of the 11th Lok Sabha with the support of Gegong Apang although Apang was Congress Chief Minister in the state of Arunachal Pradesh.

Currently, it is a part of North-East Regional Political Front consisting of political parties of the northeast which has supported the National Democratic Alliance (India).

In December 2015, 30 dissident Indian National Congress MLAs including chief minister, Kalikho Pul joined Peoples Party of Arunachal and formed the government along with Bharatiya Janata Party.

In May 2016, after the Bharatiya Janata Party led National Democratic Alliance formed its first government in Assam, a new alliance called the North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) was formed with Himanta Biswa Sarma as its convener. The Chief Ministers of the north eastern states of Sikkim, Assam and Nagaland too belong to this alliance. Thus, the People&#x27;s Party of Arunachal joined the BJP led NEDA.

All of the 30 MLAs returned to Indian National Congress on 16 July 2016 and Pema Khandu was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh.

On 16 September 2016, 43 MLAs from the ruling party, under the CM Pema Khandu, left Indian National Congress to join People&#x27;s Party of Arunachal party, in alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party. Though Pema Khandu is still the Chief minister, it is soon expected that either a coalition government will be formed with BJP as the speaker of assembly has also changed sides with the CM, or that the Indian Government will dissolve the state assembly for a fresh general elections.

In October 2016, Pema Khandu, Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh formally joined hands with Bharatiya Janata Party, making Arunachal Pradesh 14th state to have BJP in power, and with this new coalition, Tamiyo Taga sworn in as Cabinet minister of Arunachal Pradesh.

On 21 December 2016 Pema Khandu was suspended from the party by the party president Kahfa Bengia and Takam Pario was named as the next likely Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh replacing Khandu after People&#x27;s Party of Arunachal suspended Khandu along with 6 other MLAs.

In December 2016, Pema Khandu proved majority on the floor with 33 of the People&#x27;s Party of Arunachal&#x27;s 43 legislators joining the Bharatiya Janata Party as the BJP party increased its strength to 45 and it has the support of two independents. He became second Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh of Bharatiya Janata Party in Arunachal Pradesh after 44 days lead Gegong Apang government in 2003.

<text>I Confess is a 1953 American film noir directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Montgomery Clift as Catholic priest Father Michael William Logan, Anne Baxter as Ruth Grandfort, and Karl Malden as Inspector Larrue.

The film is based on a 1902 French play by Paul Anthelme titled &quot;Nos deux consciences&quot; (&quot;Our Two Consciences&quot;), which Hitchcock saw in the 1930s. The screenplay was written by George Tabori.

Filming took place largely on location in Quebec City with numerous shots of the city landscape and interiors of its churches, especially St. Zéphirin&#x27;s and other emblematic buildings, such as the Château Frontenac.

==Plot==

Father Logan is a devout Catholic priest in Ste. Marie&#x27;s Church in Quebec City. He employs German immigrant married couple Otto and Alma Keller as caretaker and housekeeper, respectively. Otto Keller also works part-time as a gardener for a shady lawyer, Villette.

The film begins late one evening as a man wearing a cassock walks away from Villette&#x27;s home with the lawyer dead on the floor inside. Shortly afterward, in the church confessional, Otto confesses to Logan that he accidentally killed Villette while trying to rob him. Otto tells his wife about his deed and assures her that the priest will not say anything because he is required to keep anything revealed during confession inviolate.

The next morning, Otto goes to Villette&#x27;s house at his regularly scheduled gardening time and reports the death to the police. Logan also goes to the crime scene after hearing Alma mention that her husband is there and finds the police there. Logan is interviewed by Inspector Larrue, who witnesses Logan talking to a woman after he leaves.

At the police station, two young girls tell Larrue they saw a priest leaving Villette&#x27;s house. This prompts Larrue to call Logan in for more questioning, but Logan refuses to provide any information about the murder. Prematurely suspecting Logan, Larrue orders a detective to follow Logan and contacts Crown Prosecutor Robertson, who is attending a party hosted by Ruth Grandfort, the woman Logan talked to outside of Villette&#x27;s house, and her husband Pierre, a member of the Quebec legislature. Ruth overhears Robertson discussing Logan, and Larrue&#x27;s detective discovers her identity by following her home the next day after she meets with Logan to warn him that he is a suspect.

Considering everyone Logan speaks to a suspect, Larrue calls Ruth and Logan in for questioning, and Ruth blurts out the truth, narrating a series of flashbacks: she and Logan fell in love when they were childhood friends, but he went to fight in World War II with the Regina Rifle Regiment and eventually stopped writing to her.

She eventually married Pierre, for whom she had been working as secretary. The day after Logan returned from the war, he and Ruth spent the day on a nearby island. A storm forced them to shelter for the night in a gazebo, and Villette found them there in the morning, recognizing Ruth. The next time Ruth saw Logan was several years later when he was ordained as a priest.

Villette had recently asked Ruth to persuade her husband to help him escape a tax scandal, with the condition that if she refused, he would publicize the night she spent with Logan. She met with Logan on the night of the murder, and Logan agreed to intercede with Villette.

Ruth&#x27;s meeting with Logan occurred between 9 and 11 pm on the night of the murder, but Larrue shows Robinson Villette&#x27;s autopsy report that indicates that Villette couldn&#x27;t have died before 11:30 pm. The fact that Ruth and Logan concluded their meeting at 11 pm leaves Logan without an alibi.

Knowing he will be arrested, Logan turns himself in the next day at Larrue&#x27;s office. Keller has planted the bloody cassock among Logan&#x27;s belongings, and when Logan is tried in court, Keller testifies that he saw Logan enter the church after the murder, acting suspiciously.

The jury finds Logan not guilty, due to insufficient evidence, but the crowd outside the courthouse mobs Logan as he leaves the court. This upsets Alma to such an extent that she starts to shout that Logan was innocent. Otto, realizing that he&#x27;s about to be revealed as the murderer, shoots Alma, killing her. While being pursued by police officers, he flees into the Château Frontenac, killing a chef de cuisine in the process.

Larrue finally realizes that Otto is the murderer, corners him in the grand ballroom of the Château Frontenac, and tricks him into confessing the murder. Otto, suspecting that Logan had betrayed him to the police, threatens to shoot him. However, Logan prefers peace over violence, and advances into the ballroom to talk with Otto.

Immediately followed by police officers, Logan talks with Otto, his main intention being to prevent a ballroom gunfight, but Otto shoots at him; a police sharpshooter then shoots Otto, saving Logan&#x27;s life. Mortally wounded, Otto calls to Logan &quot;&quot; and dies immediately after asking him for forgiveness.

==Production==
&quot;I Confess&quot; had one of the longest pre-productions of any Hitchcock film, with almost 12 writers working on the script for Hitchcock over a period of eight years (Hitchcock had taken time off for the wedding of his daughter Patricia Hitchcock in 1951, and he was in the midst of dissolving his partnership in Transatlantic Pictures with Sidney Bernstein). In the original screenplay, following the source play, the priest and his lover had an illegitimate baby, and the priest was executed at the end of the film. These elements were removed at the insistence of executives at Warner Brothers, who feared a negative reaction. Hitchcock took inspiration for the jury&#x27;s verdict from the Pimlico Mystery.

Hitchcock first hired Anita Björk as the female lead after seeing her in &quot;Miss Julie&quot; (1951). However, when she arrived in Hollywood with her lover, Stig Dagerman, and their baby, Warner Bros. insisted that Hitchcock find another actress for the role.

Shooting took place in Hollywood and Quebec from August 21 to October 22, 1952. Hitchcock had planned on using Quebec churches at no cost. When the local diocese read the original script by George Tabori, it objected to the priest&#x27;s execution and rescinded its permission. When Tabori refused to change the script, Hitchcock brought in William Archibald to rewrite it.

Hitchcock, as was his custom, created detailed storyboards for each scene. He could not understand Clift&#x27;s Method acting technique and quickly became frustrated with Clift when he blew take after take for failing to follow Hitchcock&#x27;s instructions.

Cognizant of the difficulty non-Catholics would have in understanding the priest&#x27;s reluctance to expose Keller, Hitchcock said:

Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo appearance occurs during the second minute—right after the opening credits—as he walks across the top of a stairway.

==Reception==
The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; faulted an &quot;obviously padded&quot; and &quot;a suspenseless script,&quot; explaining that &quot;only the most credulous patron will be worried for very long that the hero will not be delivered from his dilemma by some saving grace. And this realization well unburdens the situation of any real suspense.&quot; Crowther&#x27;s review concluded that &quot;Mr. Hitchcock does manage to inject little glints of imagery and invent little twists of construction that give the film the smooth, neat glitter of his style. Shot on location in Quebec, it has a certain atmospheric flavor, too. But it never gets up and goes places. It just ambles and drones along.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;short of the suspense one would expect and overlong on talk,&quot; although it did note &quot;a number of top-flight performances.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in a negative review that the film &quot;asks for more than the usual suspension of disbelief&quot; because &quot;the priest is not helpless, a fact which the writers and director attempt to forget at the cost of the film&#x27;s credibility from the earliest reel. It would certainly seem that so young a priest&#x27;s superiors would have had more to do with his problem, if not at first, surely before the matter came to public trial ... So promising an idea as is the use of the confessional in framing a murder case and respectful as the picture appears to be of matters ecclesiastic, the basic conception is false. The result is a tricked-up picture unworthy of the suave master of movie thrillers.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was also negative, writing: &quot;Presumably, this is meant to be a kind of mystery drama. What it actually amounts to, though, is an exposition of the difficulties a priest can get into by keeping the secrets of the confessional inviolate. The theme is prinked up with murder and romance, but neither, as represented here, makes for suspense or entertainment ... it is possible that Montgomery Clift, who plays the part, was ill-advised to portray the priest as a sort of bemused juvenile, plainly too abstracted to lead one lamb, let alone a flock.&quot;

A mixed review in &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; declared the film &quot;rather less successful than &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; and a good deal more so than anything else Hitchcock has done since the ill-fated &quot;Rope&quot; ... The final chase through the huge Chateau Frontenac seems a touch that Hitchcock could not resist: out of keeping with the generally somber tone of the film, it provides a showily melodramatic climax. The unresolved split between the straightforward thriller technique and the more penetrating psychological study of character, indeed, makes itself felt as a weakness at intervals throughout the film.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also was mixed, declaring that &quot;While it has scenery and carefully allotted bits of tension, the film is crowded and devious plot-wise and doesn&#x27;t rank with Director Hitchcock&#x27;s previous bests. The finale is slightly overdone, even if it does manage to bring in a famed hotel.&quot;

Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote one of the positive reviews, and declared that Hitchcock &quot;has fashioned an absorbing screen drama, one of the solidest and most expertly made of recent weeks. In his careful treatment Hitchcock has gone deeper into human relationships than is usual with him, relying less on the physical chase or on theatrical props like trains and merry-go-rounds than on the interplay of faith and doubt to create his famous brand of suspense.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote: &quot;Living up to his reputation as a master of the suspense film, Alfred Hitchcock has fashioned a powerful dramatic entertainment in &quot;I Confess&quot;. ... It is not a cheerful picture, but it holds one tense throughout.&quot;

The film was banned in Ireland because it showed a priest having a relationship with a woman (even though, in the film, the relationship takes place before the character becomes a priest).

The film was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival.

&quot;I Confess&quot; was a favorite among French New Wave filmmakers, according to filmmaker/historian Peter Bogdanovich.

Film critic Sarah Ortiz has described &quot;I Confess&quot; as &quot;the most Catholic film of Hitchcock&#x27;s films.&quot; In 2012, &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the film &quot;A forgotten albeit flawed masterpiece&quot;. On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;I Confess&quot; holds a rating of 81% from 31 reviews.

==Adaptations==
&quot;I Confess&quot; was adapted to the radio program &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on September 21, 1953, with Cary Grant in Montgomery Clift&#x27;s role.
