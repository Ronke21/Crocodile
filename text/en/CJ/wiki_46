<text>The eighth edition of the South American Championship was held in Montevideo, Uruguay from 12 October to 2 November 1924.

==Overview==

CONMEBOL asked the Paraguayan Football Association to organize it, but it refused because they lacked the infrastructure for such an event. However, the association did organize it, but by way of honouring the recent Paris 1924 gold-medallists, Uruguay, it was held there.

The participating countries were Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. Brazil withdrew from the tournament.

<text>Philipp van Limborch (19 June 1633 – 30 April 1712) was a Dutch Remonstrant theologian.

==Biography==
Limborch was born on 19 June 1633 in Amsterdam, where his father was a lawyer. He received his education at Utrecht, at Leiden, in his native city, and finally at Utrecht University, which he entered in 1652. In 1657 he became a Remonstrant pastor at Gouda, and in 1667 he was transferred to Amsterdam, where, in the following year, the office of professor of theology in the Remonstrant seminary was added to his pastoral charge. He was a friend of John Locke, whose A Letter Concerning Toleration was likely addressed to, and first published by, Philipp van Limborch. He died in Amsterdam on 30 April 1712.

==Theology==
In theology, Limborch diverged radically from Jacobus Arminius and Arminianism. He embraced Rationalism and Semi-Pelagianism. Practically he did not believe in total depravity, and assimilated prevenient grace to common grace.

==Works==
His most important work, &quot;Institutiones theologiae christianae, ad praxin pietatis et promotionem pacis, christianae unice directae&quot; (Amsterdam, 1686, 5th ed., 1735), is a full and clear exposition of the system of Simon Episcopius and Stephan Curcellaeus. The fourth edition (1715) included a posthumous &quot;Relatio historica de origine et progressu controversiarum in foederato Belgio de praedestinatione&quot;.

Limborch also wrote:
*&quot;De veritate religionis Christianae amica collatio cum erudito Judaeo&quot; (Gouda, 1687) (the &quot;erudite Jew&quot; in question was Isaac Orobio de Castro)
*&quot;Historia Inquisitionis&quot; (1692), in four books prefixed to the &quot;Liber Sententiarum Inquisitionis Tolosanae&quot; (1308–1323)
*&quot;Commentarius in Acta Apostolorum et in Epistolas ad Romanos et ad Hebraeos&quot; (Rotterdam, 1711)

An English translation of the &quot;Theologia&quot; was published in 1702 by William Jones (&quot;A Complete System or Body of Divinity, both Speculative and Practical, founded on Scripture and Reason&quot;, London, 1702); and a translation of the &quot;Historia Inquisitionis&quot;, by Samuel Chandler, with a large introduction concerning the rise and progress of persecution and the real and pretended causes of it prefixed, appeared in 1731. See Herzog-Hauck, &quot;Realencyklopädie&quot;.

==Editorial work==
In 1689 Limborch edited the compilation of Socinian Samuel Przypkowski&#x27;s works in the last volume of the &quot;Bibliotheca antitrinitariorum&quot; or &quot;Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum&quot; of the Polish Brethren. Previous volumes had been edited after the death of Christopher Sandius by Benedykt Wiszowaty in 1684.

His editorial labors included the publication of various works of his predecessors, and of &quot;Epistolae ecclesiasticae praestantum ad eruditorum virorum&quot; (Amsterdam, 1684), chiefly, by Jacobus Arminius, Joannes Uytenbogardus, Konrad Vorstius, Gerhard Vossius, Hugo Grotius, Simon Episcopius (his grand-uncle) and Caspar Barlaeus; they are of great value for the history of Arminianism.

His edition of the &quot;Liber Sententiarum Inquisitionis Tolosanae&quot; is still considered important nowadays for its meticulous transcription of a manuscript by the Dominican inquisitor Bernard Gui long regarded as lost forever, but rediscovered in London (British Library, ms. Add. 4697). Recently a new edition has appeared (&quot;Le Livre des sentences de l&#x27;inquisiteur Bernard Gui (1308-1323)&quot; edited by Annette Palès-Gobillard (2 volumes, Paris 2003).

<text>Corporate Airlines Flight 5966 (marketed as AmericanConnection Flight 5966 by American Airlines) was a scheduled passenger flight from St. Louis, Missouri to Kirksville, Missouri. On October 19, 2004, the Jetstream 32 aircraft operating the flight crashed on approach to Kirksville Regional Airport as a result of pilot error, killing 13 of the 15 people aboard.

==Flight information==
Flight 5966 was a flight route from St. Louis Lambert International Airport in St. Louis, Missouri, United States to Kirksville Regional Airport in unincorporated Adair County, Missouri, near the city of Kirksville. Corporate Airlines (later RegionsAir, now defunct) flew the route as part of the AmericanConnection network, an affiliate of American Airlines.

The captain was 48-year-old Kim William Sasse, a former flight instructor who had been with Corporate Airlines since 2001. He had logged 4,234 flight hours, including 2,510 hours on the Jetstream 32. The first officer was 29-year-old Jonathan Palmer, also a former flight instructor. Palmer had been hired by Corporate Airlines only three months before the accident and had 2,856 flight hours, only 107 of which were on the Jetstream 32.

==Accident==
On October 19, 2004, the Jetstream 32 twin-engine turboprop flying the route crashed on the approach to Kirksville Airport. The crash killed both pilots and 11 of the 13 passengers aboard. The two surviving passengers were seriously injured.

Some of the 13 passengers were doctors from other states who had been due to attend a seminar at the A. T. Still University. These included Steven Z. Miller, who was killed in the crash. Dr. Miller was director of pediatric emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, a prominent figure in the &quot;humanism in medicine&quot; movement. The two passengers who survived were John Krogh (68) and his assistant Wendy Bonham (44).

==Investigation==
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of the accident was: 
[T]he pilots&#x27; failure to follow established procedures and properly conduct a non-precision instrument approach at night in instrument meteorological conditions, including their descent below the minimum descent altitude before required visual cues were available (which continued un-moderated until the airplane struck the trees) and their failure to adhere to the established division of duties between the flying and non-flying (monitoring) pilot.

The NTSB analysis of the cockpit voice recorder suggested that both pilots were looking outside the cockpit for visual cues to the location of the airport and failed to realize how low they had descended below the minimum descent altitude. The report further states:

Contributing to the accident were the pilots&#x27; failure to make standard callouts and the current Federal Aviation Regulations that allow pilots to descend below the minimum descent altitude into a region in which safe obstacle clearance is not assured based upon seeing only the airport approach lights. The pilots&#x27; failure to establish and maintain a professional demeanor during the flight and their fatigue likely contributed to their degraded performance.

==In popular culture==
The television series &quot;Aircrash Confidential&quot; featured the incident in the third episode of Season 2, titled &quot;Pilot Fatigue&quot;.

The crash was also featured in Season 23, Episode 1 of the Canadian documentary series &quot;Mayday&quot;, titled &quot;Deadly Exchange&quot;.

<text>A side stitch (or &quot;stitch in one&#x27;s side&quot;) is an intense stabbing abdominal pain under the lower edge of the ribcage that occurs during exercise. It is also called a side ache, side cramp, muscle stitch, or simply stitch, and the medical term is exercise-related transient abdominal pain (ETAP). It sometimes extends to shoulder tip pain, and commonly occurs during running, swimming, and horseback riding. Approximately two-thirds of runners will experience at least one episode of a stitch each year. The precise cause is unclear, although it most likely involves irritation of the abdominal lining, and the condition is more likely after consuming a meal or a sugary beverage. If the pain is present only when exercising and is completely absent at rest, in an otherwise healthy person, it does not require investigation. Typical treatment strategies involve deep breathing and/or manual pressure on the affected area.

== Causes ==
The precise cause of ETAP is unclear. Proposed mechanisms include diaphragmatic ischemia (insufficient oxygen); stress on the supportive visceral ligaments that attach the abdominal organs to the diaphragm; gastrointestinal ischemia or distension; cramping of the abdominal musculature; ischemic pain resulting from compression of the celiac artery by the median arcuate ligament under the diaphragm; aggravation of the spinal nerves; or, most likely, irritation of the parietal peritoneum (abdominal lining).

Although the diaphragm is mostly innervated by the phrenic nerve, and thus could explain referred pain to the shoulder tip region, the main evidence against diaphragmatic ischemia is that ETAP can be induced by activities of low respiratory demand, such as horse, camel, and motorbike riding, where ischemia of the diaphragm is unlikely. In a study using a fluoroscopic technique, diaphragmatic movements during an ETAP episode have been shown to be full and unrestricted. In another study, researchers analyzed flow-volume loops from subjects who were experiencing ETAP and found no compromise in any measures of breathing, suggesting that the diaphragm is not implicated directly in the causation of ETAP.

Some have proposed that this abdominal pain may be caused by internal organs (like the liver and stomach) pulling downwards on the diaphragm, but this hypothesis is inconsistent with its frequent occurrence during swimming, which involves almost no downward force on these organs.

Frictional irritation of the parietal peritoneum has been suggested as a cause of ETAP. The parietal peritoneum is the outer layer of the peritoneum that adheres to the abdominal wall and underside of the diaphragm. Because the portion of the peritoneum that underlies the diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve, it could explain the shoulder tip pain. The parietal peritoneum traverses the entire abdominal wall, which could account for the widespread distribution of ETAP; the tension in the parietal peritoneum is increased with torso extension; children have a proportionally larger peritoneal surface compared to adults, which could explain the increased prevalence of ETAP in younger individuals; and pain arising from the parietal peritoneum relieves quickly on removal of the stimulus, similar to what is observed for ETAP when activity is ceased. After a meal, distention of the stomach could increase friction between the visceral and parietal layers of peritoneum, and sugary beverages could provoke ETAP due to slower emptying of the stomach. In fact, the fluid in the peritoneal cavity is highly responsive to osmotic gradients between it and its vascular supply.

In the absence of a clear cause, any treatment techniques are uncertain. Typical strategies involve deep breathing and/or manual pressure on the affected area.

==Occurrence==
Side stitches occur in every level of athletes from school-aged children, weekend exercisers, or elite athletes, although they are more common in younger people. Activities that use upper body twists, like running, swimming, and horseback riding, report this affliction more often. Approximately two-thirds of runners will experience at least one episode of a stitch each year.

<text>The Sudan national football team () represents Sudan in international football and is controlled by the Sudan Football Association, the governing body for football in Sudan. Its home ground is Khartoum Stadium in the capital Khartoum. In 1957, it was one of the three teams to participate in the inaugural Africa Cup of Nations, the other two being Egypt and Ethiopia.

Sudan is one of the oldest teams in Africa and won the 1970 Africa Cup of Nations as hosts.

==History==
===Beginning and an African giant (1946–1970)===
The Sudan Football Association was founded in 1936 and thus it became one of the oldest football associations to exist in Africa. However, before the foundation of the Football Association, Sudan had started experiencing football brought to the country by the British colonizers since early 20th century via Egypt. Other Sudanese clubs founded at that time include Al-Hilal Omdurman, Al-Merrikh, which led to popularization of football in the country. The Khartoum League became the first national league to be played in Sudan, laying ground for the future development of Sudanese football.

Being experienced early with football, Sudan was quick to affiliate itself with FIFA in 1948, and soon after, Sudanese officials were instrumental, along with Ethiopian, South African and Egyptian counterparts, forming the Confederation of African Football in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum in 1957. Following the establishment of CAF, Sudan participated in the 1957 African Cup of Nations, the first historic Africa Cup of Nations which Sudan was host. The national team finished third, as South Africa was banned over apartheid.

During that early era, Sudan produced some of the finest players, most notably Mustafa Azhari, the captain of Sudan during this period; Nasr El-Din Abbas, who became Sudan&#x27;s top scorer in the country&#x27;s football team; Siddiq Manzul, who was an instrumental leader in Sudan&#x27;s forward; Ali Gagarin with his meteoric ability. Sudan then won the 1970 African Cup of Nations, their only African trophy up to date.

===Decline (1970–2008)===
With the retirement of a significant number of Sudanese football star at the time, the national team of Sudan deteriorated. Sudan participated in 1972 and 1976 editions, but Sudan wasn&#x27;t able to get out of the group stage. At the time, Sudan was plagued by the first and second civil wars that led to football in the country being largely unable to retain its status. Likewise, Sudan also suffered from series of political upheavals that drained the country&#x27;s football resources. As such, Sudan struggled to qualify for another AFCON, and the country has yet to qualify for a single FIFA World Cup. Only Libya being the other major Arab country in Africa to have never achieved the feat. Often Sudan participated in AFCON qualification and majority finished in bottom or near bottom of their qualification. This was totally contrasted to their successes in club competition, as Sudanese clubs were omnipresent in CAF Champions League.

===Small resurgence (2008–2012)===
On 9 September 2007, Sudan beat World Cup participant Tunisia 3–2 at home, making Sudan the top finisher in the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations qualification Group 4. This meant Sudan had finally returned to the AFCON after 32 years. In the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, their first in 32 years, Sudan was grouped in group C, which they shared with Egypt, Cameroon and Zambia. Sudan lost all three competitive games finishing at the bottom of their group.

Sudan reached the final round of the 2010 World Cup qualifiers but finished last with only a point, failing to reach AFCON and World Cup.

Sudan (as hosts) automatically qualified for the 2011 African Nations Championship. They finished top of their group which consisted of Algeria, Uganda and Gabon to then advance to the knockout stages. After defeating Niger on penalties in the quarterfinals, they lost against Angola in the semifinals (also on penalties) to then win 1–0 against former groupmates Algeria (who also lost on penalties in the semifinals) and finish third in the Championship, their first top 4 finish in a major African tournament since 1970.

In the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, Sudan was once again in the same group with Ghana, alongside Swaziland and Congo. Sudan lost only one game and reached the tournament In the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, in group B, Sudan finished second behind Ivory Coast, and overcame Angola by goal difference to reach the knockout stage for the first time since 1970. Sudan played Zambia in the last eight, and lost 0–3. Zambia would go on to win the tournament for the first time.

===Downfall (2012–2018)===
In 2013 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, Sudan suffered a huge blow when they lost to neighbor Ethiopia by away goal, losing 0–2 in Addis Ababa after a very eventful 5–3 win at home, thus missed out the competition. Since then, Sudan continued to struggle qualifying for the African Cup of Nations for the next 7 years. They also had no success qualifying for the African Nations Championship after their 3rd-place finish in 2011 for a while until 2018.

===Fluctuation (2018–present)===
In 2018 they qualified for the 2018 African Nations Championship after failing to do so in two previous competitions and finished 3rd place, and it was seen as a signal heralding a new era of Sudanese football. Shortly after, with an almost identical crop of players, Sudan succeeded in qualifying for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, finishing ahead of powerhouse South Africa, including two famous wins at home against Ghana and South Africa and eliminated the South Africans in process, successfully returned to the AFCON after nine years. The optimism increased when Sudan beat Libya 1–0 in the qualification for the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup, under the same management of French coach Hubert Velud, making impressions that Sudan would soon recover its glorious place among Arab and African football nations.

However, Sudan had a disastrous opening during the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification. Being drawn with the likes of a fellow Arab state and powerhouse Morocco, as well as Guinea-Bissau and Guinea which have never taken part in a World Cup like Sudan, the Sudanese were still being regarded as somewhat better than the two Guineas and could be a potential competitor against Morocco. Sudan started its quest with a 0–2 away to the Moroccans in Rabat, which was seen as acceptable. Yet in the home fixture against Guinea-Bissau, Sudan was completely trashed by the Bissau-Guineans 2–4, to leave the team in the bottom place and reducing hopes to qualify for a maiden World Cup. Sudan&#x27;s hope was completely dashed after winning only two points after two consecutive draws over Guinea, effectively making Sudan the first team to be eliminated in the group.

Since the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, the Sudan national football team, also known as the &quot;Falcons of Jediane,&quot; has experienced notable developments in international competitions.

In the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification. Sudan began their campaign strongly in June 2024, defeating South Sudan 3-0 in a Group B match. Key players like Yasir Mozamil Mohamed and Mohamed Abdel Raman contributed significantly to the victory. This result placed Sudan at the top of their group early in the qualifiers, with future games set against stronger teams like Senegal. 2025 Africa Cup of Nations Despite ongoing civil conflict forcing them to play matches abroad, Sudan secured a spot in the 2025 AFCON. They finished second in their group behind Angola, with crucial performances in October and November 2024. A notable achievement was their draw against Angola, which cemented their qualification. This success highlighted their resilience and ability to compete under challenging circumstances.

<text>Jonathan LaPaglia (, ; born 31 August 1969) is an Australian actor and television personality. He has hosted Network 10&#x27;s revival of &quot;Australian Survivor&quot; since 2016. As an actor, LaPaglia is known for his roles as Frank B. Parker in the television series &quot;Seven Days&quot;, Kevin Debreno in &quot;The District&quot; and Detective Tommy McNamara in &quot;New York Undercover&quot;.

==Early and personal life==
LaPaglia was born in Adelaide, South Australia, the youngest of three sons of Maria Johannes (née Brendel), a secretary, originally from the Netherlands and Gedio &quot;Eddie&quot; LaPaglia, an auto mechanic and car dealer from Bovalino, Calabria, Italy. Actor Anthony LaPaglia is one of his elder brothers. LaPaglia lives in Santa Monica, California, with his wife Ursula Brooks and daughter.

==Career==
LaPaglia graduated from Rostrevor College, and then from the University of Adelaide with a MBBS medical degree in 1991. He worked three years as an emergency ward physician in Adelaide, Sydney and London. Feeling restricted, he decided to follow his brother into acting. In 1994, he moved to New York City where he joined the Circle in the Square Theatre School. He got his first break in 1996 when he joined the cast of the television series &quot;New York Undercover&quot;.

From 1998 until 2001, he played the role of Cmdr. Frank B. Parker on the science fiction series &quot;Seven Days&quot;. Afterwards, he played Detective Kevin Debreno, on &quot;The District&quot; from 2001–2004. LaPaglia has also guest-starred in numerous series including &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;NCIS&quot;, &quot;Cold Case&quot; and &quot;Castle&quot;. He appeared in the May 2008 issue of &quot;Car Craft&quot; magazine with his custom 6.1L Hemi &#x27;73 Dodge Challenger.

In 2011, he starred as the protagonist, Hector, in the TV adaptation of Christos Tsiolkas&#x27; novel &quot;The Slap&quot; produced for ABC TV. Although he is Australian, this was LaPaglia&#x27;s first appearance in an Australian production. Having lived abroad for many years, LaPaglia found it necessary to hire a dialect coach to recover his Australian accent.
His second role in an Australian production was the title character of real-life crime boss Anthony &quot;Rooster&quot; Perish in Channel Nine&#x27;s &quot;Underbelly: Badness&quot;, which was the fifth series of the true crime drama franchise. He starred in the 2014 movie &quot;The Reckoning&quot; alongside Luke Hemsworth.

Since 2016, he has been the host of Network 10&#x27;s revival of &quot;Australian Survivor&quot;. In 2020, he was &#x27;inducted&#x27; by the &quot;Australian Survivor Archive&quot; fansite into the &quot;Inaugural &quot;Australian Survivor&quot; Hall of Fame&quot;. LaPaglia is also a sports enthusiast and model.

In October 2023, it was confirmed that he would be one of three hosts, alongside Beau Ryan and Blair Joscelyne, on a reboot of Top Gear Australia for Paramount Plus.

<text>Cosmo Nelson Innes FRSE (9 September 1798 – 31 July 1874) was a Scottish advocate, judge, historian and antiquary. He served as Advocate-Depute, Sheriff of Elginshire, and Principal Clerk of Session.

He was a skilled decipherer of ancient Scottish records and helped to compile, edit and index &quot;Acts of the Scottish Parliament 1124–1707&quot;. He was said to be tall, handsome but shy. He was accused of being a Catholic sympathiser whilst it remained illegal, and joined the Scottish Episcopal Church, closer in some practices to the Catholic Church. Dean Ramsay, head of the Episcopal Church, was one of his friends.

==Life==
Born in Durris House to Euphemia Russell and John Innes of Leuchars WS. His middle name, Nelson, is almost certainly to mark Horatio Nelson&#x27;s then recent victory at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798. Thirteen of his 14 siblings died, only he and his sister Elizabeth survived. His friends included Alexander Forbes Irvine (1818–1892), whose career closely paralleled his own.

He was educated at Edinburgh High School, then at the University of Edinburgh under Professor James Pillans. He then undertook further studies at the universities of Aberdeen and Glasgow, and at Balliol College, Oxford (1817–1820) graduating with a BA 1820. He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1822, and was appointed Professor of Constitutional Law and History at the University of Edinburgh in 1846.

In the 1830s he lived in Allan Ramsay&#x27;s former house, Ramsay Lodge, at the top of the Royal Mile (later absorbed into Ramsay Gardens). He had offices with his brother, Thomas Innes, at 51 North Castle Street in the New Town.

From 1840 to 1852 he was Sheriff of Moray during which time he had to deal with protesters angry at the continued export of grain from their district after the potato crop on which they relied heavily was lost to blight. On Wednesday 27 January 1847, Innes and his special constables were repulsed by a mob after they attempted to arrest the leaders of the protesters who had unloaded oatmeal from the cargo vessel &quot;James and Bessie&quot; in Burghead harbour and returned it to the grain-merchant&#x27;s granary. The Sheriff and his party were obliged to retreat to Elgin and call for military assistance. Innes resigned from his post as Sheriff in 1852 to succeed Thomas Thomson in the role of Principal Clerk of Session in the Scottish Court of Session.

In 1843 he became a member of the Edinburgh Calotype Club one of the world&#x27;s first photographic societies. He was also a member of the Spalding Club, Maitland Club and Bannatyne Club.

In 1858 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Scotland. His proposer was James Thomson Gibson-Craig. He served as the Society&#x27;s Vice-President 1862–69.

In later life Innes lived in Inverleith House in northern Edinburgh. The house still exists and is in the grounds of Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Botanic Garden. The Garden was formed from Innes&#x27; former garden grounds.

He died unexpectedly on 31 July 1874 at Killin while on a &quot;Highland Tour&quot;. He was buried on 5 August at Warriston Cemetery in Edinburgh. The grave lies on the east side of the main west path, just beyond the large Celtic cross to Horatio McCulloch. Given that Innes was one of the richest persons in Edinburgh, the gravestone is exceptionally modest.

==Works==

He was the author of &quot;Memoir of Thomas Thomson, Advocate&quot; (1854), &quot;Scotland in the Middle Ages&quot; (1860), &quot;Sketches of Early Scottish History&quot; (1861), &quot;Lectures on Scotch Legal Antiquities&quot; (1872) and &quot;Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character&quot; (1875, co-written with Dean Ramsay)). He also edited many historical manuscripts for the Bannatyne Club and other antiquarian clubs. He also frequently wrote for the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; and &quot;North British Review&quot;.

Photographic works include &quot;A Tour: The Coast of Spain&quot; (an album of 1857); Midcalder Church (1856); Dunrobin Castle (1856); and Elgin Cathedral (1856).

==Family==
In 1826 Innes married Isabella Rose, daughter of Hugh Rose of Kilravock. They had nine children: four daughters and five sons.

* Katherine Innes (1824-1898) married historian John Hill Burton in 1855. Her children included engineer W. K. Burton, the artist Mary Rose Hill Burton and the chemist Professor Cosmo Innes Burton FCS FRSE. 
* Euphemia Innes died of scarlet fever.
* John Innes (1829-1853) died in India whilst serving in the army.
* Hugh Rose Innes (1832-1868) served in China. He died of rheumatism in his parents&#x27; arms.
* Francis Jeffrey Innes, Lieutenant of the Bombay Staff Corps and Adjutant of the 4th Cavalry, Hyderabad, died in India in 1867.
* James Innes (1834-), colonial administrator. He married the author Emily Innes.
* Cosmo Innes (1842-1887) engineer who was involved in the construction of the railways in India.
* Margaret Isabella Innes (1843-1929) married Captain Forbes Mackay.
* Mary Innes (1846-1911) married Robert Finlay, 1st Viscount Finlay, Lord Chancellor of Great Britain.

From 1836 he and his wife were appointed the formal guardian of their niece, Isabella Grant, whose parents had died in India. In 1844, her uncle Captain Alexander Grant, brother of her father Patrick, challenged the guardianship, however the court found the challenge inappropriate as her home was wholly appropriate and was the will of her father.

<doc id="1095594" wikidata="Q455716" url="?curid=1095594" title="Toivo Mikael Kivimäki">
<text>Toivo Mikael Kivimäki (5 June 1886 – 6 May 1968), (J.D.), was a Finnish politician of the National Progressive Party who served as the head of the department of civil law at Helsinki University 1931–1956, Prime Minister of Finland 1932–1936, and Finland&#x27;s Envoy to Berlin 1940–1944.

== Early career ==
He was elected as member of the Parliament for terms 1922, 1924-1927 and 1929–1940. 
Before prime ministership, Kivimäki served as Minister of the Interior 1928-1929 and Minister of Justice 1931–1932.

== After WWII ==
In 1946, Kivimäki together with half-a-dozen other leading politicians were put on &quot;war-responsibility trials&quot; executed under pressure from the Allied victors in World War II. Kivimäki was sentenced to five years in prison after being found responsible for the Continuation War. After Finland signed the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947, and the Finno–Soviet Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, 1948, the international situation was deemed somewhat stabilized, and Kivimäki was pardoned. He returned to his career in academia.

== Legacy ==
As with all politicians connected with the Continuation War, Kivimäki was for decades seen in a somewhat critical light. During the era of finlandization, many prominent Finns expressed themselves cautiously on such subjects in order not to disturb sensitive Allied victors of the war; a cautiousness that without doubt influenced Finland&#x27;s post-war generation&#x27;s understanding and views.

* As Prime Minister, Kivimäki headed Finland&#x27;s (until 1987) most long-lived cabinet, aiming at stabilizing the turbulent politics in Finland after the semi-fascist Mäntsälä Rebellion had been put down.
* He achieved the reversal of Finland&#x27;s foreign policy into a neutralist pro-Scandinavian stance, and a Swedish rapprochement, that may well have been prepared for in the most initiated circles, but that in the contemporary tense phase of the language strife in Finland was not at all easy to explain to the public opinion.
* As an Envoy to the Third Reich, Kivimäki was in a position to observe the anti-Semitic nature of the Nazi regime and the disappearance of German Jews to concentration camps. Kivimäki succeeded in reversing Nazi Germany&#x27;s anti-Finnish stance, obtaining support and favours but at the price of Finland having to form an alliance with Hitler. Finland avoided formal treaties with Nazi Germany up until the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement, which was signed after the fall of Viipuri in June 1944.

Several individuals and factors were critical for the Winter War and the Continuation War. Kivimäki without any doubt occupies a prominent position among pro-Axis Finnish leaders.

<doc id="1095597" wikidata="Q731466" url="?curid=1095597" title="OXO (video game)">
<text>OXO is a video game developed by A S Douglas in 1952 which simulates a game of noughts and crosses (tic-tac-toe). It was one of the first games developed in the early history of video games. Douglas programmed the game as part of a thesis on human-computer interaction at the University of Cambridge.

The program was written for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC). EDSAC was one of the first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and had three small cathode-ray tube screens to display the state of the memory; Douglas re-purposed one screen to demonstrate portraying other information to the user, such as the state of a noughts and crosses game. After the game served its purpose, it was discarded on the original hardware but later successfully reconstructed.

&quot;OXO&quot;, along with a draughts game by Christopher Strachey completed around the same time, is one of the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen. Under some definitions, it thus may qualify as the first video game, though other definitions exclude it due to its lack of moving or real-time updating graphics.

==History==

The Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) mainframe computer was built in the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Mathematical Laboratory between 1946 and 6 May 1949, when it ran its first program, and remained in use until 11 July 1958. The EDSAC was one of the first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) to graphically display the state of the computer&#x27;s memory. As a part of a thesis on human-computer interaction, Sandy Douglas, a doctoral candidate in mathematics at the university, used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game.

Douglas used the EDSAC to simulate a game of noughts and crosses, and display the state of the game on the screen. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas&#x27;s purpose, the game was discarded. Douglas did not give the game a name beyond &quot;noughts and crosses&quot;; the name &quot;OXO&quot; first appeared as the name of the simulation file created by computer historian Martin Campbell-Kelly while creating a simulation of the EDSAC several decades later. Around the same time that &quot;OXO&quot; was completed, Christopher Strachey expanded a draughts program he had originally written in 1951 and ported it to the Ferranti Mark 1, which showed the state of the game on a CRT display. &quot;OXO&quot; and Strachey&#x27;s draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen, though it is unclear which of the two games was displayed first. As it ran on a computing device and used a graphical display, &quot;OXO&quot; is considered under some definitions to be a contender for the first video game, though under others it does not due to its lack of moving graphics or graphics which update continuously.

==Interaction==
Each game was played by one user against an artificially intelligent opponent, which could play a &quot;perfect&quot; game. The player entered their input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer&#x27;s move would follow; the game display only updated when the game state changed. &quot;OXO&quot; was not available to the general public and could only be played in the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Mathematical Laboratory by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved, and both the computer and the game were only intended for academic research purposes.

<text>William Jones (30 July 17266 January 1800), known as William Jones of Nayland, was a British clergyman and author.
==Life==
He was born at Lowick, Northamptonshire, but was descended from an old Welsh family. One of his ancestors was Colonel John Jones, brother-in-law of Oliver Cromwell. He was educated at Charterhouse School and University College, Oxford. There a taste for music, as well as a similarity of character, led to his close intimacy with George Horne, later bishop of Norwich, whom he induced to study Hutchinsonian doctrines.

After obtaining his bachelor&#x27;s degree at University College, Oxford in 1749, Jones held various preferments (Vicar of Bethersden, Kent (1764); Rector of Pluckley, Kent (1765)). In 1777 he obtained the perpetual curacy of Nayland, Suffolk, and on Horne&#x27;s appointment to Norwich became his chaplain, afterwards writing his life. His vicarage became the centre of a High Church &quot;coterie&quot;, and Jones himself was a link between the non-jurors and the Oxford Movement. He could write intelligibly on abstruse topics.

==Works==
In 1756 Jones published his tract &quot;The Catholic Doctrine of a Trinity&quot;, a statement of the doctrine from the Hutchinsonian point of view, with a summary of biblical proofs. This was followed in 1762 by an &quot;Essay on the First Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;, in which he maintained the theories of Hutchinson in opposition to those of Isaac Newton, and in 1781 he dealt with the same subject in &quot;Physiological Disquisitions&quot;. Jones was also the originator of the &quot;British Critic&quot; (May 1793).
Eighteenth century high churchmen were more concerned with ecclesiology than with the sacraments. The status of Anglican ministry was crucial to high church ecclesiology. The ground of the Anglican ministry was trinitarian orthodoxy and this doctrine was reasserted by high churchmen against Arians, Deists and Socinians. Jones&#x27;s &quot;A Full Answer to the Essay on Spirit&quot; (London 1753), co-authored with George Horne, responded to Robert Clayton&#x27;s Arian work of three years earlier and sharpened the trinitarian controversy according to Jones himself.

In the 1790s he and William Stevens launched the Society for the Reformation of Principles. Jones wrote loyalist tracts and argued that the French Revolution was a manifestation of the Antichrist. His ideas were perpetuated after his death by successive reprints of his works and helped influence the 19th century conservative tradition in both Church and State.

His collected works, with a life by William Stevens, appeared in 1801, in 12 vols., and were condensed into 6 vols in 1810. A life of Jones, forming pt. 5 of the &quot;Biography of English Divines&quot;, was published in 1849. He published a hymn to the words of John Milton, the seventeenth century puritanical republican, &#x27;The Lord will come and not be slow.&#x27;

<doc id="1095609" wikidata="Q3849540" url="?curid=1095609" title="Far West, Missouri">
<text>Far West was a settlement of the Latter Day Saint movement in Caldwell County, Missouri, United States, during the late 1830s. It is recognized as a historic site by the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, added to the register in 1970. It is owned and maintained by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

==Foundation and early history==
The town was founded by Missouri leaders of the church, W. W. Phelps and John Whitmer in August 1836 shortly before the county&#x27;s creation. The town was platted originally as a square area, centered on a public square which was to house a temple. The design of the town resembled the plan of Joseph Smith Jr. (the first prophet of the Latter Day Saint Movement) for the City of Zion, which had been planned to be built in the town of Independence, Missouri. As the town of Far West grew, the plat was extended to .

Early Latter-day Saints began to settle in northwestern Missouri soon after the church was organized in 1830. According to a revelation given by Joseph Smith Jr., Independence would be the &quot;centerplace&quot; of the City of Zion when Jesus returned. However, disputes between early members of the church and Missourian settlers in Independence led to the expulsion of the early members of the church from Jackson County in 1833. Most temporarily settled in Clay County, Missouri. Towards the end of 1836, Caldwell County was created specifically for a settlement of members of the church to compensate property losses in Jackson County. Shortly after the creation of Caldwell County, Far West was made the county seat.

Far West became the headquarters of the church in early 1838 when Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon relocated to the town from the previous church headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio. Joseph Smith taught that the Garden of Eden had been in Jackson County and when Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden, they moved to the area now comprising Caldwell and Daviess Counties, Missouri. While headquartered in Far West, the official name of the church was changed to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, after previously being known as the Church of Christ from 1830 to 1834 and as the Church of the Latter Day Saints, and variations of that name, since 1834.

==Missourian conflict of 1838==

New problems erupted when members of the church began to settle in the counties surrounding Caldwell, including De Witt in Carroll County and Adam-ondi-Ahman in Daviess County. Fear that the growing number of Saints would outnumber the local citizens, and misunderstandings regarding the doctrine, purposes, and practices of the church, created a series of escalating conflicts, and the Governor of Missouri eventually called out 2,500 state militiamen to put down what he alleged to be a &quot;Mormon rebellion.&quot; He also issued an extermination order to rid the state of the church. Terrified, members of the church poured into Far West for protection and found themselves under siege. Joseph Smith Jr., Sidney Rigdon, and others surrendered at the end of October 1838, hoping to alleviate the persecution on the main church body of members, but were put on trial by the state for treason on trumped up false charges. The main body of the church was then forced illegally to sign over their property in Far West and Caldwell County to pay for the militia muster and then leave the state. The main body later settled in Nauvoo, Illinois.

==Aftermath and Far West today==
Far West became a ghost town soon after the departure of most of the church population. The county seat was moved to Kingston, Missouri and many of the log houses in Far West were relocated. John Whitmer continued to live in the nearly empty town, where he owned a large farm.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints purchased the temple site and some of the surrounding area in 1909. Since then, Far West has been maintained as a historic site. It is located south of U.S. Route 36 on Missouri Route D. The site includes the cornerstones of the planned temple, each encased in glass, and a monument to the early settlers that was dedicated in 1968. The church also honors the Far West legacy in the name of a ward located in Cameron and, since 2015, a stake centered in Gallatin.

Community of Christ, formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, has a congregation that meets in Far West, across the street from the historic site.

In 2004 construction began on a historic village adjacent to the temple site. It is operated by the Far West Historical Society to accommodate and increase tourism. The Country Store has been in operation since 2006.

In May 2012, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints confirmed that it purchased of Missouri farmland and three historical sites from Community of Christ, including land around Far West.

<doc id="1095616" wikidata="Q5540735" url="?curid=1095616" title="George Horne (bishop)">
<text>George Horne (1 November 1730 – 17 January 1792) was an English churchman, academic, writer, and university administrator.

==Early years==
Horne was born at Otham near Maidstone, in Kent, the eldest surviving son of the Reverend Samuel Horne (1693-1768), rector of the parish, and his wife Anne (1697-1787), youngest daughter of Bowyer Hendley. He attended Maidstone Grammar School alongside his cousin and lifelong friend William Stevens, son of his father&#x27;s sister Margaret, and from there went in 1746 to University College, Oxford (BA 1749; MA 1752; DD 1764). Three contemporaries at the college were also friends for life: Charles Jenkinson later first Earl of Liverpool, William Jones of Nayland. and John Moore, later Archbishop of Canterbury. His two younger brothers were also Oxford graduates and clergymen, Samuel Horne (1733 – about 1772) becoming an Oxford academic while William Horne (1740 – 1821) succeeded their father as rector of Otham.

==Academic career==
In 1749 Horne became a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, of which college he was elected President on 27 January 1768. As an influential college head, he served as vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1776 until 1780. At the university, he fought against any relaxation of the law that required entrants to subscribe to the beliefs of the Church of England.

==Ecclesiastical career==
Ordained priest in 1753, from 1760 to 1764 he was curate of the Oxfordshire village of Horspath. Thereafter his religious duties were performed at Magdalen until 1771, when the prime minister Lord North appointed him to the Royal Household as chaplain in ordinary to King George III, a position he held until 1781. In that year, he was appointed Dean of Canterbury, combining the post with the presidency of Magdalen. An energetic dean, he promoted Sunday schools to inform the young and delivered influential sermons against Unitarianism. He was also an active supporter of the Naval and Military Bible Society, now the Naval Military &amp; Air Force Bible Society, founded in 1779 to supply Christian literature to the armed services and seafarers.

In 1790, by then in ill health from which he never recovered, with some reluctance he accepted the bishopric of Norwich, resigning from Canterbury and, the next year, from Magdalen. Unable to accomplish much in his diocese or in the House of Lords, one achievement was to support the bishops of the Episcopalian Church of Scotland who in 1789 came to London to petition Parliament for relief from their legal disadvantages. In what became his final circular to his diocesan clergy, as the French Revolution challenged most of the values for which he stood, he remained adamant that &#x27;true religion and true learning were never yet at variance&#x27;.

==Intellectual influences==
Through his preaching, journalism, correspondence and authorship of numerous works (some at the time anonymous), Horne actively defended the high church tendency in Anglicanism against Calvinism, the Church of England against other denominations, and Trinitarian Christianity against other beliefs. He had a reputation as a preacher, and his sermons were frequently reprinted. In his polemical pieces, some appearing in newspapers under the name of Nathaniel Freebody (a cousin who had died), he was influenced by the work of Charles Leslie
Having early adopted some of the views of John Hutchinson, he wrote in his defence, though disagreeing with Hutchinson&#x27;s fanciful interpretations of Hebrew etymology.
He also fell under the imputation of Methodism, but protested from the university pulpit against those who took their theology from George Whitefield and John Wesley rather than major Anglican divines. Nevertheless, he disapproved of the expulsion of six Methodist students from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, a high-profile event of 1768 in Oxford; and later, when bishop, thought Wesley should not be forbidden to preach in his diocese.

Though impressed by the earlier writings of William Law, he later complained that he saw him &#x27;falling from the heaven of Christianity into the sink and complication of Paganism, Quakerism, and Socinianism, mixed up with chemistry and astrology by a possessed cobbler.&#x27; In this &#x27;sink&#x27;, he included the views of Emanuel Swedenborg and Jacob Boehme.
Despite criticising the plan of Benjamin Kennicott and some of his colleagues to collate a new text of the Hebrew Bible from manuscripts, in order to prepare for a new translation into English, the two became friends.
He was also friendly with Samuel Johnson who with James Boswell came to tea at Magdalen, where they discussed producing a new edition of the &quot;Lives&quot; by Izaak Walton, and Boswell later wrote warmly of Horne&#x27;s character and abilities.
Though he enjoyed reading Edward Gibbon and admired his scholarship, he recorded his distaste for Gibbon&#x27;s continual belittling of the Jewish and Christian tradition.

His lifelong emphasis on revealed religion rather than natural religion and his acceptance of what would become high church beliefs formed an important link between the nonjurors of the seventeenth century and the Oxford Movement of the nineteenth.

==Writings==
Among his publications were:
*&quot;The Theology and Philosophy of Cicero&#x27;s Somnium Scipionis&quot; 1751, a satirical pamphlet.
*(With William Jones) &quot;A full answer to the Essay on Spirit by Bishop R. Clayton, with a particular explanation of the Hermetic, Pythagorean, and Platonic Trinities&quot;, 1752. Against the views of Robert Clayton. 
*&quot;A Fair, Candid, and Impartial Statement of the Case between Sir Isaac Newton and Mr. Hutchinson&quot; (anon.) 1753.
* &quot;An Apology for certain Gentlemen in the University of Oxford, aspersed in a late anonymous pamphlet&quot; 1756. The anonymous pamphlet was called &#x27;A Word to the Hutchinsonians&#x27;.
*&quot;Cautions to the Readers of Mr. Law, and, with very few varieties, to the Readers of Baron Swedenborg&quot; 1758, to which was added &quot;A Letter to a Lady on the subject of Jacob Behmen&#x27;s Writings&quot;. 
*&quot;A View of Mr. Kennicott&#x27;s Method of Correcting the Hebrew Text&quot; 1760. 
*&quot;Considerations on the Life and Death of St. John the Baptist&quot; 1769, an expansion of a sermon preached by him on St. John the Baptist&#x27;s day 1755, from the open-air pulpit in the quadrangle of Magdalen College.
*&quot;Commentary on the Psalms&quot;, 1771. His best known work, the &#x27;Commentary&#x27; is partly exegetical and partly devotional, proceeding on the principle that most of the Psalms are more or less Messianic, and cannot be properly understood except in those terms. Richard Mant transferred Horne&#x27;s preface almost verbatim to his annotated &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. Hannah More, another of Horne&#x27;s friends, admired it. 
* &quot;A Letter to Dr. Adam Smith&quot; (anon), 1777. An attack on Adam Smith&#x27;s life of David Hume, attempting to refute Hume&#x27;s contempt for Christian belief.
* &quot;Letters on Infidelity&quot; 1784, addressed to his cousin William Stevens. In addition to his bête noire David Hume, these attacked other Enlightenment rationalists such as Voltaire and d&#x27;Alembert.
* &quot;A Key to the Book of Psalms&quot; (1785)

He intended writing a ‘&#x27;Defence of the Divinity of Christ&#x27;’ against Joseph Priestley, but did not live to do that. 
Horne&#x27;s collected &quot;Works&quot; were published with a &quot;Memoir&quot; by William Jones in 1799.

==Family==
On 22 June 1768, he married Felicia Elizabetha (1741–1821), only child of lawyer and legal author Philip Burton and his wife Felicia, daughter of Ralph Whitfield. They had three daughters: Felicia Elizabetha (1770–1829) who in 1791 married the Reverend Robert Hele Selby Hele; Maria (1773–1852) unmarried; and Sarah (1775–1853), a pupil of Hannah More, who in 1796 married the Reverend Humphrey Aram Hole.

Aged 62, he died at Bath, Somerset on 17 January 1792 and was interred in his father-in-law&#x27;s vault at Eltham.

<text>Thomas Innes (1662 – 28 January 1744) was a Scottish Roman Catholic priest and historian. He studied at the Scots College, (Paris), of which he became vice-principal. He was the author of two learned works, &quot;Critical Essay on the Ancient Inhabitants of the Northern Parts of Britain&quot; (1729), and &quot;Civil and Ecclesiastical History of Scotland, 80 to 818&quot; (published 1853).
==Life==
The second son of James Innes, and younger brother of Lewis Innes, he was born at Drumgask in the parish of Aboyne, Aberdeenshire. In 1677 he was sent to Paris, and studied at the College of Navarre. He entered the Scots College on 12 January 1681, but still attended the College of Navarre.

On 26 May 1684 he received the clerical tonsure; on 10 March 1691 was promoted to the priesthood, and afterwards spent a few months at Notre Dame des Vertus, a seminary of the Oratorians near Paris. Returning to the Scots College in 1692, he assisted the principal, his elder brother Lewis, in arranging the records of the church of Glasgow, which had been deposited partly in that college and partly in the Carthusian monastery at Paris by Archbishop James Beaton. In 1694 he graduated M.A. at Paris, and in 1695 matriculated in the German nation. After officiating as a priest for two years in the parish of Magnay in the diocese of Paris, he went again to the Scots College in 1697.

In the spring of 1698 he returned to Scotland, and officiated for three years at Inveravon, Banffshire, as a priest of the Scottish mission. In October 1701 he returned to Paris, and became prefect of studies in the Scots College, and also mission agent. There he spent twenty more years. His friendship with Charles Rollin, Jacques-Joseph Duguet, and Jean Santeul led to his being suspected of Jansenism. In 1720 his brother Lewis, in what may be a formal letter to the vicar-general of the Bishop of Apt, contradicted a report that Thomas had concurred in an appeal to a general council against the condemnation of Pasquier Quesnel&#x27;s &#x27;Moral Reflections&#x27; by Pope Clement XI.

After a long absence he again visited Scotland to collect materials for his &#x27;Essay&#x27; and his &#x27;History.&#x27; In the winter of 1724 he was at Edinburgh, pursuing his researches in the Advocates&#x27; Library. In December 1727 he was appointed vice-principal of the Scots College at Paris, where he died on 28 January 1744.

==Works==
The results of Innes&#x27;s researches in Scottish history and antiquities were communicated to scholars who sought his assistance. Francis Atterbury and Thomas Ruddiman were among them, and Robert Keith was given materials for his &quot;Catalogue of Scottish Bishops&quot;. George Grub wrote that Innes was opposed to ultramontanism, but was not Jansenist as historian.

His works are:
* ‘A Critical Essay on the Ancient Inhabitants of the Northern Parts of Britain or Scotland. Containing an Account of the Romans, of the Britains betwixt the Walls, of the Caledonians or Picts, and particularly of the Scots. With an Appendix of ancient manuscript pieces,’ 2 vols., London, 1729; reprinted, with a Memoir by George Grub, LL.D., in vol. viii. of ‘The Historians of Scotland,’ Edinburgh, 1879. This work elicited an anonymous volume of ‘Remarks’, by George Waddel, Edinburgh, 1733, and &#x27;The Roman Account of Britain and Ireland,&#x27; by Alexander Taitt, 1741. Both these replies are reprinted in &#x27;Scotia Rediviva,&#x27; 1826, vol. i., and in &#x27;Tracts illustrative of the Antiquities of Scotland,&#x27; 1836, vol. i. Innes&#x27;s reputation mainly rests on this &#x27;Critical Essay.’
* &#x27;Epistola de veteri apud Scotos habendi Synodos modo,&#x27; dated Paris, 23 November 1735. In vol. i. of David Wilkins&#x27;s &#x27;Concilia Magnæ Britanniæ;&#x27; reprinted with Innes&#x27;s &#x27;Civil and Ecclesiastical History.’
* &#x27;,&#x27; edited by George Grub, and printed at Aberdeen for the Spalding Club, 1853, from a manuscript in the possession of James Kyle, bishop of Germanica, and vicar-apostolic of the northern district of Scotland.
* Papers by Innes, and documents connected with his family. In &#x27;Miscellany of the Spalding Club,&#x27; ii. 351–80. They include (a) &#x27;Letter to the Chevalier de St. George,&#x27; dated 17 October 1729; (b) &#x27;Remarks on a Charter of Prince Henry, son of David I;&#x27; (c) &#x27;Of the Salisbury Liturgy used in Scotland.&#x27;

Five volumes, mostly in his handwriting, of his manuscript collections in Scottish history, went to the Laing manuscripts in the library of Edinburgh University. A thick quarto volume of collections and dissertations was at Preshome under the charge of Bishop Kyle in 1853. His &#x27;Original Letters,&#x27; 1729–33 are the University Library, Edinburgh (&#x27;Laing Collections,&#x27; No. 346). Several of his letters to the Hon. Harry Maule of Kelly, author of the &#x27;Registrum de Panmure,&#x27; are printed in the appendix to John Stuart&#x27;s edition of that work, 2 vols. Edinburgh, 1874.

The &#x27;Life of King James II&#x27; has been attributed to him, but was more probably compiled by his brother, Lewis Innes.

==Legacy==
The academic journal &quot;The Innes Review&quot;, published since 1950 by the Scottish Catholic Historical Association, is named after Thomas Innes.

<text>George Payne Rainsford James (9 August 1799 – 9 June 1860), was an English novelist and historical writer, the son of a physician in London. He was for many years British Consul at various places in the United States and on the Continent. He held the honorary office of British Historiographer Royal during the last years of William IV&#x27;s reign.

==Early life==
George Payne Rainsford James was born in St George Street, Hanover Square, London in 1799. His father was a physician who had served in the navy and was in America during the Revolutionary War, serving with Benedict Arnold in the Battle of Groton Heights.

James attended the school of the Reverend William Carmalt in Putney. He developed a love of languages, including Greek, Latin, Persian and Arabic. He also studied medicine as a young man, but his inclinations led him in a different direction. He wanted to go into the navy, but his father was against it, due to his own naval experiences, finally allowing him to join the army. James served for a short time in the army as a lieutenant during the Hundred Days, and was wounded in a small action following The Battle of Waterloo. He travelled extensively, visiting France and Spain soon after the abdication of Napoleon. These early travels gave him the idea for his novel &quot;Morley Ernstein&quot;.

==Career==

In 1825 he wrote his first, and probably his best known novel &quot;Richelieu: A Tale of France&quot;, which was not published until 1829. After reading &quot;Richelieu&quot;, which had been given to him by a friend, and after receiving a letter from James, Walter Scott advised him to take up literature as a profession. He was also given encouragement by Washington Irving.

In 1828 he married Frances Thomas, the daughter of Honoratus Leigh Thomas, an important physician. After their marriage they lived in France, Italy, and Scotland. They had two children, including C. L. James. His wife survived him by 31 years, dying in Wisconsin in 1891.

He was appointed &quot;Historiographer Royal&quot; during the last years of William IV&#x27;s reign, and published several official pamphlets. During this period he lived with his wife at Oxford Cottage in Marlow. 

In 1842 he lived at Walmer and was frequently a guest of the Duke of Wellington at Walmer Castle. In 1845 he went to Germany, partly for recreation and partly to gather material for his writings. On his return to England he lived for some time in Farnham, Surrey.

In July 1850 he left England and travelled to New York, where he rented Charles Astor Bristed&#x27;s house at Hell Gate. In 1851 he took a house at Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where he later bought property and made some efforts at farming. In 1852 he was appointed British Consul at Norfolk, Virginia. In 1856 the Consulate was moved to Richmond. His novels &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and &quot;The Old Dominion&quot;, written at this time, were set in the United States. In 1858 he was transferred to Venice, Italy, partly due to failing health, where he was appointed Consul General. In April 1860, he became seriously ill. He died in June 1860 from a stroke. He was buried in the cemetery at Isola di San Michele. The epitaph on his grave stone was written by his friend Walter Savage Landor. The epitaph reads:&quot;George Payne Rainsford James.&lt;br&gt;British Consul General in the Adriatic.&lt;br&gt;Died in Venice on the 9th day of June, 1860.&lt;br&gt;His merits as a writer are known wherever the English language is, and as a man they rest on the hearts of many.&lt;br&gt;A few friends have erected this humble and perishable monument.&quot;

==Works==

At an early age he began to write romances, and continued his production with such industry that his works reach to 100 volumes. For 30 years hardly a year went by that he failed to turn out at least one novel, and usually two or more, most of them &quot;three-deckers&quot; (three-volume). Describing himself as a follower of Sir Walter Scott, he may have produced more sheer verbiage than his mentor, chiefly historical fiction (61 titles in 158 volumes). This excessive production was fatal to his permanent reputation; but his books had considerable immediate popularity. Their titles are:

<text>Joseph de Tonquédec, [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]] (December 27, 1868 – November 21, 1962) was a widely known Jesuit Roman Catholic priest and author.

Father Tonquédec was born in Morlaix, France on December 27, 1868. He received his doctorate in philosophy in 1899 and his doctorate in theology in 1905. He was the professor of philosophy at Collège St. Grégoire, Tours, from 1899 to 1901. He was the official exorcist of Paris from 1924 to 1962. Father Gabriele Amorth, in his 1994 memoir &quot;An Exorcist Tells His Story,&quot; cites Father de Tonquédec, referring to him as a &quot;famous French exorcist.&quot; 

Father de Tonquédec was an intellectual adversary of the French philosopher Maurice Blondel. His writings on theology, philosophy, and literature have been translated into languages including Italian, Spanish, Latin, and English; see, for example, his &quot;Some Aspects of Satan&#x27;s Activity in this World.&quot;

Tonquédec died on November 21, 1962, in France.

<text>The Remonstrants (or the Remonstrant Brotherhood) is a Protestant movement that split from the Dutch Reformed Church in the early 17th century. The early Remonstrants supported Jacobus Arminius, and after his death, continued to maintain his original views called Arminianism against the proponents of Calvinism. Condemned by the synod of Dort (1618–1619), the Remonstrants remained a small minority in the Netherlands. In the middle of the 19th century, the Remonstrant Brotherhood was influenced by the liberal Dutch theological movement.

==History==

===Foundation===
In formulating Arminianism, Jacobus Arminius disagreed with Calvin, especially on predestination. He defended free examination as superior to the doctrines of established churches.

In 1610, Arminius followers presented to the States of Holland and Friesland the &quot;Five Articles of Remonstrance&quot; formulating their points of disagreement with Calvinism as adopted by the Dutch Reformed Church. Supporters of Arminius were called &quot;Remonstrants&quot;, but they were also called &quot;Arminians&quot;.

Their adversaries, inspired by Franciscus Gomarus, became known as Gomarists or Counter-Remonstrants. Although the States-General issued an edict tolerating both parties and forbidding further dispute, the conflict continued and became linked to political conflicts in the Dutch Republic. The Remonstrants were assailed both by personal enemies and by the political weapons of Maurice of Orange. Their foremost ally, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, was executed, and other leaders were imprisoned. In Amsterdam, as in various other cities, the city government was purged of Oldenbarnevelt supporters; Jacob Dircksz de Graeff and Cornelis Hooft fell victim to this action.

In 1618–1619 the Synod of Dordrecht, after expelling the thirteen Arminian pastors headed by Simon Episcopius, established the victory of the Calvinist school. It drew up ninety-three canonical rules, and confirmed the authority of the Belgic Confession and the Heidelberg Catechism. The judgement of the synod was enforced through the deposition and in some cases banishment of Remonstrant ministers. In this context, owing to the lack of preachers, there originated in Warmond a movement in favor of the lay sermon, the adherents of which founded the Society of Collegiants. An exile community of Remonstrants was founded in Antwerp in 1619. In 1621 they were allowed to settle in Schleswig, where they built the town of Friedrichstadt.

=== Institutionalization ===

The doctrine of the Remonstrants was embodied in 1621 in a &quot;Confession&quot; written by Episcopius, their major theologian. This &quot;Confession&quot; serves as a base for the Remonstrant church since his return to the Netherlands in 1626. It confirms the opinion of the remonstrants already expressed in 1618.

Jan Uytenbogaert gave to the Remonstrants a catechism and regulated their church order. Their seminary in Amsterdam had distinguished pupils, including Curcellaeus, Limborch, Wetstein, and Le Clerc. Their school of theology, which grew more liberal and even rationalistic, forcefully debated the official Dutch Reformed state church and other Christian denominations.

After the death of Maurice of Orange in 1625, some exiles returned. The government became convinced that they posed no danger to the state, and in 1630 they were formally allowed to reside again in all parts of the Republic. They were not, however, officially allowed to build churches until the establishment of the Batavian Republic in 1795. Until then they held their services in so-called Schuilkerken (house churches).

=== Liberalism ===
In the mid-19th century, the Remonstrant Brotherhood was influenced by liberalism, which in Holland was embodied by Petrus Hofstede de Groot (1802–1886). His theology had a wide audience in Europe, which is characteristic of the romantic phase of Christian humanism; in the Netherlands, this line of thought has been represented by the &quot;theologians of Groningen&quot; since 1830.

===Early Remonstrants’ theological legacy===

Most of the early Remonstrants followed classical Arminianism. However, they are not the only Protestants who can be considered Arminian or who are called Arminians. Arminianism is a minority within the Reformed confession, but it really belongs to the larger, cross-denominational current of synergism, that is to say, historic, majority Christianity. As Arminianism, it made inroads into the Church of England. As a broader synergism, it appears in Methodism, the General Baptists, the Adventist Church, the Holiness movement, Pentecostalism, the Charismatic movement, and a number of other Protestant denominations.

==Modern Remonstrant Brotherhood==
=== The church ===
The Remonstrant Brotherhood continues as a church in the Netherlands. The Remonstrants first received official recognition in 1795. Their chief congregation has been in Rotterdam.

In 2016, the Remonstrant Brotherhood has about 5,000 members and &quot;friends&quot;, in more than 40 congregations in the Netherlands, and one congregation in Friedrichstadt, in northern Germany (2008).

The Remonstrant Brotherhood of The Netherlands keeps fellowship with the European Liberal Protestant Network, and is a full, charter member of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. It is also a member of the Communion of Protestant Churches in Europe. 

In line with the progressive views on religion, Remonstrants have been blessing same-sex partnerships on an equal footing as different sex weddings from 1986 onwards (church weddings have no legal status in the Netherlands, where the legally acknowledged civil same-sex marriages became possible in 2001). In this the Remonstrants were the first Christian church in the world to bless same-sex relationships similar to other relations.

Remonstrants place big emphasis on personal faith and are not in agreement with one another on questions of faith and social issues. They consider that the message of the Gospel can not be separated from true choices in the struggle to live together, on the road to a world with peace and justice. What binds them is the Statement of Principle:

&quot;The Remonstrant Church is a community of faith which, rooted in the gospel of Jesus Christ, and true to its principle of freedom and tolerance, seeks to worship and serve God.&quot;
===Confessions of faith===

In addition to the Statement of Principle, most contemporary Remonstrants write their own declaration or profession of faith when they become a member of the community. The brotherhood did express at three times in their history the faith they share in a confessional statement, in 1621, 1940 and 2006. Remonstrants however, being a non-creedal denomination, consider no confession to have indisputable authority.

<doc id="1095655" wikidata="Q7411864" url="?curid=1095655" title="Samuel Johnson (pamphleteer)">
<text>Samuel Johnson (1649–1703) was an English clergyman and political writer, sometimes called &quot;the Whig Johnson&quot; to distinguish him from the author and lexicographer of the same name, who was a Tory in politics and lived after him. He is one of the best known pamphlet writers who developed Whig resistance theory.

==Life==
From a humble background, Samuel Johnson was educated at St. Paul&#x27;s School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and took orders. He attacked James, Duke of York in &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; (1682).

Johnson was illegally deprived of his orders, flogged, and imprisoned. He continued, however, his attacks on the Government by pamphlets, and did much to influence the public mind in favour of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Dryden gave him a place in &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot; as &quot;Benjochanan&quot;. After the Revolution he was restored to his orders and received a pension, but considered himself insufficiently rewarded by a deanery, which he declined. He was married for many years and suffered from many illnesses.

==The &quot;Julian&quot; tracts==
Johnson&#x27;s 1682 pamphlet &quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; was a reply to a sermon &quot;A Discourse of the Sovereign Power&quot; earlier the same year by George Hickes; it was printed by John Darby. With its sequels, it employed a technique of vilification by the use of parallels in classical literature. In 1683 he followed it with &quot;Julian&#x27;s Arts&quot;, but the timing turned out badly, with the revelations of the Rye House Plot, and the pamphlet was held back.

&quot;Julian the Apostate&quot; met with seven published replies, as well as becoming the target of Oxford sermons. These included pamphlets from Hickes (&quot;Jovian&quot;), John Bennet (&quot;Constantius the Apostate&quot;), Edward Meredith, and Thomas Long. He was defended by William Atwood in &quot;A Letter of Remarks upon Jovian&quot;. William Sherlock backed up &quot;Jovian&quot; and passive obedience in &quot;Case of Resistance&quot; (1684).

==Whig partisan==
Johnson was chaplain to Lord William Russell, a Whig leader, from 1679. Russell directed Johnson&#x27;s attention to constitutional theory. The result of Johnson&#x27;s researches was posthumously published in 1769 as &quot;A History and Defence of Magna Charta&quot;; a second edition appeared in 1772. Russell was later caught up in the Rye House trials. Russell&#x27;s final speech before his execution was printed, and Johnson, Darby, and Gilbert Burnet were questioned about their involvement in its publication.

<text>Mount Ritter is the highest mountain in Madera County, California, in the Western United States, at an elevation of . It is also the highest and most prominent peak of its namesake, the Ritter Range, a subrange of the Sierra Nevada in the Ansel Adams Wilderness of the Inyo and Sierra National Forests. Mount Ritter is the 15th highest mountain peak in California with at least 500 meters of topographic prominence.

==Geography==

Mount Ritter is made of strikingly dark rock and is quite prominent due to its height and isolation. It is in the middle of the Ritter Range, which includes neighboring Banner Peak and the Minarets. The prominent and memorable shape of the Ritter–Banner pair is visible from high elevations far to the north and south in the Sierra Nevada.

Mount Ritter was named by Josiah Whitney, chief of the California Geological Survey, for Carl Ritter, who had been a teacher of his when he was a student in Berlin during the 1840s.

<text>Charles Johnstone (–1800) was an Irish novelist. Prevented by deafness from practising at the Irish Bar, he went to India, where he was proprietor of a newspaper. He wrote one successful book, &quot;Chrysal, or the Adventures of a Guinea&quot;, a somewhat sombre satire.

==Life==
Born at Carrigogunnell, County Limerick about 1719, he was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, but is not known to have taken a degree. He was called to the bar, but extreme deafness prevented his practice except as a chamber lawyer, where he did not succeed. He began to write as a living.

In May 1782, Johnstone sailed for India, with a dangerous shipwreck on the voyage. He found employment in writing for the Bengal newspaper press, under the signature of &quot;Oneiropolos&quot;. He became in time joint proprietor of a journal, and prospered. He died at Calcutta about 1800.

==Works==
Johnstone&#x27;s major work, entitled &quot;Chrysal, or the Adventures of a Guinea&quot;, and frequently reprinted, appeared in 4 vols., London, 1760–65. The first and second volumes had been written during a visit to George Edgcumbe, 3rd Baron Edgcumbe in Devon. The book, a &quot;succès de scandale&quot;, claimed to reveal political secrets, and to expose the profligacy of well-known public characters.

Johnstone was also the author of:
* &quot;The Reverie, or a Flight to the Paradise of Fools&quot;, 2 vols. London, 1762.
* &quot;The History of Arsaces, Prince of Betlis&quot;, 2 vols. 1774. 
* &quot;The Pilgrim, or a Picture of Life&quot;, 2 vols. 1775. 
* &quot;History of John Juniper, Esq., alias Juniper Jack&quot;, 3 vols. 1781.

<text>Ebenezer Jones (20 January 1820 – 1860) wrote a good deal of poetry of very unequal merit, but at his best shows a true poetic vein. He was befriended by Browning and Rossetti.

==Life==
He was born in Canonbury Square, Islington on 20 January 1820. His father was of Welsh background; his mother, Hannah Sumner, was of an Essex family. They were strict Calvinists. His father died, and at 17 he was a clerk in a city firm connected with the tea-trade.

Jones was for a short time a follower of Robert Owen. He assisted his friend W. J. Linton with political journalism, and worked for the radical publishers John Cleave and Henry Hetherington. He went down with consumption, and died on 14 September 1860.

==Works==
Jones as a poet was influenced by Percy Shelley and Thomas Carlyle, and wrote in an exaggerated style. &quot;Studies of Sensation and Event&quot; (1843) was a critical failure, though not with Bryan Waller Procter and Richard Hengist Horne. Three late poems, &quot;To the Snow,&quot; &quot;To Death,&quot; and &quot;When the World is Burning&quot;, attracted attention.

Jones also wrote a short book entitled &quot;The Land Monopoly: The Suffering and Demoralization Caused by It; and the Justice and Expediency of its Abolition&quot;, published in 1849.

===Posthumous reputation===
For a while Jones was forgotten. In 1870, however, Dante Rossetti wrote in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; commented that he would some day be disinterred. William Bell Scott agreed, and in 1878 Richard Herne Shepherd wrote a brief account of Ebenezer Jones. There were biographical papers in the &quot;Athenæum&quot; of September and October 1878, by Theodore Watts; and in 1879 Shepherd published a nearly complete edition of &quot;Studies of Sensation and Event&quot; (with author&#x27;s corrections), additional pieces, a memoir by Ebenezer&#x27;s brother Sumner, and reminiscences by Linton. A proposed second volume, containing prose writings and additional poems, preserved by his friend Horace Harral (1817–1905), never appeared.

==Family==
Jones married Caroline Atherstone, niece of Edwin Atherstone, but they separated.

<text>Ernest Charles Jones (25 January 181926 January 1869) was an English poet, novelist and Chartist. Dorothy Thompson points out that Jones was born into the landed gentry, became a barrister, and left a large documentary record. &quot;He is the best-remembered of the Chartist leaders, among the pioneers of the modern Labour movement, and a friend of both Marx and Engels.&quot;

== Early life ==
Jones was born on 25 January 1819 in Berlin (Seedorf), while his parents were visiting the Prussian court. He was the son of a British Army Major named Charles Gustavus Jones, equerry to the Duke of Cumberland, afterwards King of Hanover. In 1838 Jones came to England, and in 1841 published anonymously &quot;The Wood-Spirit&quot;, a romantic novel. This was followed by some songs and poems. He entered the Middle Temple in 1841 and on 20 April 1844 he was called to the bar.

== Chartism ==
In 1845, he joined the Chartist agitation, quickly becoming its most prominent figure, and vigorously carrying on the party&#x27;s campaign on the platform and in the press. His speeches, in which he openly advocated physical force, led to his prosecution, and he was sentenced in 1848 to two years&#x27; imprisonment for seditious speeches. While in prison he wrote, it is said in his own blood on leaves torn from a prayer-book, &quot;The Revolt of Hindostan&quot;, an epic poem.

Upon his release from prison, he conducted a Chartist newspaper: the &quot;Notes to The People&quot; (1850–1852). He became a leading figure in the &quot;National Charter Association&quot; in the phase of its decline, together with his friend George Julian Harney, and helped to give the Chartist movement a clearer socialist direction. Following the closing of &quot;Notes to The People&quot;, Jones launched another Chartist publication, the &quot;People&#x27;s Paper&quot; in May 1852.

Jones knew Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels personally. Marx and Engels at the same time commented on the Chartist movement and Jones&#x27; work in their letters and articles: Marx described Jones as &quot;the most talented, consistent and energetic representative of Chartism&quot;. Marx also contributed to &quot;Notes to The People&quot;: two articles on the French Revolution of 1848 were credited to him, he co-authored six more with Jones, and according to Marx, he also made contributions to all articles on economics published in the paper from 1851 to 1852, which constituted two-thirds of articles appearing in the publication. He also contributed 25 articles to the &quot;People&#x27;s Paper&quot;. Jones, a strident anti-imperialist, has been credited as an influence on Marx&#x27;s views regarding colonialism, which shifted during the 1850s from seeing imperialism as a progressive, modernising force to regarding it as having a destructive effect on colonised societies: Jones&#x27; imprisonment had come about after he had given a speech in east London advocating for the end of British rule in Ireland, and wrote a series of articles in the &quot;People&#x27;s Paper&quot; in 1853 expressing the hope that the sepoys of the presidency armies would revolt against Company rule in India, prefiguring the Indian Rebellion of 1857 by four years.

However, Jones was almost the National Charter Association&#x27;s only public speaker; he was out of sympathy with the other leading Chartists, and soon joined the advanced Radical party. Jones was a member of the Manchester section of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association.

== Return to Convention ==
Afterwards, when the political and social agitation had died down, he returned to his practice as a barrister, which he had deserted, and also wrote largely. He produced a number of novels, including &quot;The Maid of Warsaw&quot; and &quot;Woman&#x27;s Wrongs&quot;, also some poems, &quot;The Painter of Florence&quot;, &quot;The Battle Day&quot; (1855), &quot;The Revolt of Hindostan&quot; (1857), and &quot;Corayda&quot; (1859). Some of his lyrics, such as &quot;The Song of the Poor&quot;, &quot;The Song of the Day Labourers&quot;, and &quot;The Factory Slave&quot;, were well known.

== Death ==
He made several unsuccessful attempts to enter parliament and was about to contest Manchester, with the certainty of being returned, when he died in Ardwick, Manchester in 1869. He is buried in Ardwick Cemetery. He is believed to have sacrificed a considerable fortune rather than abandon his Chartist principles. His wife was Jane Atherley; and his son, Llewellyn Atherley-Jones, K.C. (1851–1929), was a barrister and Liberal Member of Parliament.

<text>John Jortin (23 October 1698 – 5 September 1770) was an English church historian.

==Life==

Jortin was the son of Renatus Jordain, a Breton Huguenot refugee and government official, and Martha Rogers, daughter of Daniel Rogers. He was educated at Charterhouse School, and in 1715 became a pensioner of Jesus College, Cambridge, where he became a Fellow in 1721. He was Rede lecturer at Cambridge in 1724, and Boyle lecturer in 1749. A churchman, he held various benefices, becoming in 1764 Archdeacon of London.

==Works==

Jortin briefly (1731–2) established a magazine, &quot;Miscellaneous Observations upon Authors, Ancient and Modern&quot;, in which he wrote on Spenser and Milton. In 1722 he published a small volume of Latin verse entitled &quot;Lusus poetici&quot;. &quot;Discourses Concerning the Truth of the Christian Religion&quot; (1746) was a work of Christian apologetics. His &quot;Remarks on Ecclesiastical History&quot; (5 vols, 1751‑73), has been labelled &quot;the most significant Anglican ecclesiastical history of the eighteenth century&quot;; written &quot;from a markedly latitudinarian perspective&quot;, it was respected by Gibbon.

Jortin mostly avoided controversy, though a dissertation on Virgil&#x27;s treatment of the dead, by conflicting with Warburton&#x27;s treatment, drew attack from Warburton&#x27;s disciple Richard Hurd. A two-volume &quot;Life of Erasmus&quot; (1758, 1760) drew upon Jean Le Clerc: &quot;Jortin was in many ways a late representative of Christian humanism, as well as an active citizen in the protestant republic of letters&quot;. Jortin published other miscellaneous pamphlets and tracts, and seven volumes of sermons appeared after his death. All his works showed learning, and were written in a lively style.

A collection of three volumes of his works was printed in 1805 and can be found at Internet Archive:
* &quot;Discourses Concerning the Truth of the Christian Religion and Remarks on Ecclesiastical History&quot;, Volume 1
* &quot;Discourses Concerning the Truth of the Christian Religion and Remarks on Ecclesiastical History&quot;, Volume 2
* &quot;Discourses Concerning the Truth of the Christian Religion and Remarks on Ecclesiastical History&quot;, Volume 3

<text>Sylvester Judd (July 23, 1813 – January 26, 1853) was a Unitarian minister and an American novelist.

==Biography==
Sylvester Judd III was born on July 23, 1813, in Westhampton, Massachusetts to Sylvester Judd II and Apphia Hall, a daughter of Aaron Hall of Norwich, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, a one-year attendee at Harvard, and later modest justice of the peace. His great-grandfather was Rev. Jonathan Judd (1719-1803), a clergyman of Southampton, while his grandfather ran the family store. His father, after working in the store in his boyhood, went to Boston for several years, where, according to Judd&#x27;s sister&#x27;s biography, he became a voracious reader, returning to the family business, but then becoming editor of the &quot;Hampshire Gazette&quot;. Sylvester Judd III studied at Hopkins Academy in Hadley, Massachusetts, where he was president of the Literary Society and delivered the valedictorian address. He graduated from Yale College in 1836, and from Harvard Divinity School in 1840. His dissertation was entitled &quot;The Uses of Intellectual Philosophy to the Preacher&quot;. While a student, on April 4, 1838, Judd traveled to Concord, Massachusetts to meet Ralph Waldo Emerson after reading his essay &quot;Epic Poetry&quot;. Emerson was pleased by Judd&#x27;s interest in seeking a mystical identification with Christ. Judd may have been in the audience on August 31, 1837, and heard Emerson&#x27;s commencement speech to the Phi Beta Kappa Society known as &quot;The American Scholar&quot;.

Judd was ordained a Unitarian minister on October 1, 1840, becoming pastor of a church in Augusta, Maine. He was a member of the Maine Peace Society which was anti-war and sought justice through a World Court. Early in 1841, Judd met Jane Elizabeth Williams, the daughter of United States Senator Reuel Williams. The couple married on August 31, 1841; they had three daughters: Jane Elizabeth (September 26, 1844), Frances Hall (June 28, 1847), and Apphia Williams (March 16, 1853). Judd&#x27;s third daughter was born two months after his death. His second daughter, Frances, married the Unitarian minister Seth Curtis Beach on November 17, 1869. Their son, Reuel W. Beach (Harvard graduate, married Ruth Walcott Stetson in 1909), and grandson, Curtis Beach, were both Unitarian ministers. Frances and Seth Beach&#x27;s second son, Dr. Sylvester Judd Beach, lived from 1879-1953, residing in Portland, ME. Dr. Beach served as President of the Wayflete School in Portland, bringing progressive education to the school. Sylvester Judd&#x27;s sister, Apphia Putnam Judd (born Oct 27, 1820 in Westhampton; died 1901 in Augusta), married his wife&#x27;s brother, Joseph Hartwell Williams (1814-1896), who was the 27th governor of Maine (1857-1858).

==Influences==
According to Philip Brockway, Judd&#x27;s early influences were Calvinist puritanism. After a spiritual conversion to Unitarianism as a young man, his readings took on wide spheres, particularly while at Yale College and then Harvard Divinity School. His readings included the poetry of Jones Very, the writings of Thomas Carlyle, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Robert Owen, Goethe&#x27;s Wilhelm Meister&#x27;s Apprenticeship, &quot;Goethe&#x27;s Conversations with a Child&quot; by Bettina von Arnim, and the writings of the foremost Unitarian ministers of their day, William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Brockway cites Emerson&#x27;s journal entry from 1852, the year before Judd&#x27;s death at 40: &quot;I saw Judd in Augusta [Maine], in February, and asked him who his companions were. He said, &#x27;Sunsets.&#x27; I told him I thought they needed men. He said, &#x27;I&#x27;m a priest and converse with the sick and dying.&#x27;&quot;

==Criticism==
American critic and poet James Russell Lowell called Judd&#x27;s novel &quot;Margaret&quot; &quot;the most emphatically American book ever written&quot;. He mentioned the novel in his long satire &quot;A Fable for Critics&quot; (1848) as &quot;the first Yankee book / With the &quot;soul&quot; of Down East in &#x27;t, and things farther East&quot;. In a 39-page review, however, critic William Bourne Oliver Peabody called the work unfinished and its characters and style inconsistent. After publishing his novel &quot;Philo&quot;, Judd sent a copy to Edward Everett Hale, who responded, &quot;I think &quot;Philo&quot; glorious.&quot;

The critic and poet Richard J. Powers finds the child characterization of Margaret in the novel the prototype for Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s character of Pearl, Hester Prynne&#x27;s daughter, in the 1850 novel &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Crooked River was a skirmish that occurred on October 25, 1838, and was a major escalator of the 1838 Mormon War. A Mormon rescue party, led by David W. Patten, formed to free three Mormon captives taken from Caldwell County the day prior, clashed with a Ray County militia company commanded by Samuel Bogart southeast of Elmira, Missouri. Exaggerated reports of the battle led Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs to issue Missouri executive order 44, resulting in the forced expulsion of the Mormons from the state. 

==Background==

Ray County was located immediately south of the Mormon-dominated Caldwell County. The two counties were separated by a no-man&#x27;s land 24 miles long and 6 miles wide, known as &quot;Bunkham&#x27;s Strip&quot; or &quot;Buncombe Strip&quot;. This unincorporated strip was attached to Ray County for administrative and military purposes.

In early 1838, a group of prominent leaders from the Latter Day Saint church, including David Whitmer, William W. Phelps, John Whitmer and Oliver Cowdery, were excommunicated on accounts of wrongdoing. They fled Caldwell County and relocated their families to Richmond and Liberty, the county seats of Ray and Clay, respectively. The expulsion of the dissenters alarmed and created mistrust among the Missourians. 

Meanwhile, relations between the Missourians and the Mormons living in the recently colonized Carroll and Daviess counties deteriorated. In August, a brawl erupted in Gallatin when a group of Missourians attempted to block the Mormons from voting. In early October, a mob besieged the Mormon settlement of DeWitt, Missouri, demanding that the Mormons leave Carroll County. The citizens of DeWitt appealed for assistance to other Mormon settlements. In response, the Danites, a Mormon vigilante group, marched to Daviess County, Missouri, where they believed the attackers where located, and sacked the county seat of Gallatin. The following day, apostles Thomas B. Marsh and Orson Hyde left their association with the Church, and swore out affidavits reporting on the Daviess County expedition, the existence of the Danites, and rumors that the Danites were planning to attack Richmond and Liberty. Though no such attack was ever contemplated, dispatches of militia forces were authorized to prevent such an invasion.

==Prelude to the battle==
General David R. Atchison of Clay County, commander of the state militia in northwestern Missouri, ordered a company led by Captain Samuel Bogart of Ray County to patrol Bunkham&#x27;s Strip to &quot;prevent, if possible, any invasion of Ray county by persons in arms whatever&quot;. According to Peter Burnett, a resident of Liberty, &quot;Captain Bogart was not a very discreet man, and his men were of much the same character&quot;. Bogart had previously been dispatched to help disperse the siege of DeWitt; however his militia went rogue and joined the vigilantes that harried the Mormons in Carroll County.

Bogart and his party began visiting the homes of Latter Day Saints living in Bunkham&#x27;s Strip, forcibly disarming them and ordering them to leave Ray County. Bogart penetrated into Caldwell County and began to similarly harass Mormons there, advising them to remove to Far West, Missouri, the county seat. Returning to Ray County, his men captured three Mormons — Nathan Pinkham, Jr., William Seely, and Addison Green.

Reports quickly made it to Far West to the effect that a &quot;mob&quot; had captured and intended to execute a group of Mormon prisoners. About midnight, an armed rescue party formed. David W. Patten led the contingent of Caldwell county militia. Patten had come to be known as &quot;Captain Fear-not,&quot; for his bravery during the attacks in Daviess County. On the night of October 24, 1838 the Mormon force quickly moved south along the main road connecting Far West and Richmond, approaching Captain Bogart&#x27;s unit, which was camped along the banks of Crooked River, from the north along the main road. They travelled five hours starting on midnight. 

==The battle==

The Mormons encountered one of the militia&#x27;s sentries, John Lockart, with whom the Mormons briefly exchanged words. After Lockhart reportedly heard a gun snap, he shot at the crowd, hitting Patrick O&#x27;Bannion, the Mormons&#x27; scout. O&#x27;Bannion later died from this wound. Lockhart fled down the hill to the militia camp, while the Mormon company formed a line in three columns, led by David W. Patten, Charles C. Rich, and Patrick Durfee. 

Rich later recalled that soon after the Mormons had formed their lines, the militia &quot;fired upon us with all their guns&quot;. A general firefight commenced, but the militia were situated behind the riverbank and held the tactically superior position. Patten decided to charge the militia position, shouting the Mormon battle cry of &quot;God and Liberty!&quot; The Missourians were without swords and so broke their lines and fled across the river in all directions.

During his charge, Patten was shot and mortally wounded. Ebenezer Robinson recalled that Patten had been &quot;brave to a fault, so much so that he was styled and called &#x27;Captain Fearnought&#x27;&quot;. Although it was not immediately realized, Gideon Carter had also been killed, making a total of three Mormon fatalities and one militiaman fatality. The Mormons collected their wounded as well as the baggage which Bogart&#x27;s unit had left in the camp and made their way back to Far West.

During the conflict, one of the militia men named Samuel Tarwater was injured by Parley P. Pratt. After Tarwater fell unconscious from the injury, D. Michael Quinn states the company of Danites &quot;mutilated the unconscious Tarwater &#x27;with their swords&#x27; striking him lengthwise in the mouth, cutting off his under teeth, and breaking his lower jaw; cutting off his cheeks ... and leaving him [for] dead.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The battle served as a catalyst for a massive escalation of the Mormon War. Exaggerated reports of the Mormon incursion into Daviess County and of the battle (some claiming that half of Bogart&#x27;s men had been lost) made their way to Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs. He responded by issuing an executive order calling out 2,500 state militiamen to put down what he perceived to be open rebellion by the Mormons. Two days later, Governor Boggs issued an order that &quot;the Mormons must be treated as enemies and must be exterminated or driven from the state&quot; and directed the militia to carry this into effect. 

On October 30, a mob of approximately 200 men killed 17 men and boys at Haun&#x27;s Mill. Two days later, Joseph Smith and approximately 50 other church leaders were arrested. Most of these leaders were released within three weeks. In November, the rest were marched first to Independence, then to Richmond, and then to Liberty, where they were incarcerated in Liberty Jail. Joseph and Hyrum Smith were indicted by a grand jury on the charge of treason. They escaped while being transferred to Boone County.

The ship was commissioned on 27 February 1919, Commander Arthur L. Bristol in command.

&quot;Breckinridge&quot; joined the Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet operating off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

After the Lok Sabha elections 2004 Dalal merged his HRP with Congress.

<text>Rolland Keith Richey (February 10, 1898December 22, 1966), known professionally as Robert Keith, was an American stage and film actor who appeared in several dozen films, mostly in the 1950s as a character actor.

==Early life==

Keith was born in Fowler, Indiana, the son of Mary Della (née Snyder) and James Haughey Richey.

==Career==
He portrayed characters such as the father in &quot;Fourteen Hours&quot; (1951) and a psychopathic gangster in &quot;The Lineup&quot; (1958).

He also played the police chief and father of biker Marlon Brando&#x27;s love interest in the 1953 film &quot;The Wild One&quot;, and as another cop, this time Brando&#x27;s antagonist, in the film musical, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;.

Keith had a large supporting role in Douglas Sirk&#x27;s &quot;Written on the Wind&quot;. He had roles on television, including a role as Richard Kimble&#x27;s father in &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and lead roles on episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (&quot;Ten O&#x27;Clock Tiger&quot; and &quot;Final Escape&quot;) and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;The Masks&quot;), which was his last screen effort, in the role of Jason Foster, the rich New Orleans patriarch to a family waiting for their benefactor to die. He appeared as scientist Garson Lee in a 1954 episode of &quot;The Motorola Television Hour&quot; &quot;Atomic Attack&quot;.

==Personal life==
Keith&#x27;s second wife was stage actress Helena Shipman, with whom he had a son, actor Brian Keith. 

On April 18, 1927, Keith married Peg Entwistle, an actress who was a decade his junior. They were divorced in 1929, with Entwistle citing abuse and domestic cruelty in her divorce filing. Entwistle also stated that Keith had deceived her into believing that he had never been married before. Keith married his fourth wife, Dorothy Tierney, in a secret wedding ceremony on an undisclosed date in 1930. They met in late 1929 while both were acting at different theatres in the San Francisco Bay Area. The couple remained together until Keith&#x27;s death on December 22, 1966. Among the honorary pallbearers at his funeral were Ronald Reagan, Edward G. Robinson, and James Cagney.

<doc id="1095679" wikidata="Q5327335" url="?curid=1095679" title="Earthworks (novel)">
<text>Earthworks is a 1965 dystopian science fiction novel by British science fiction author Brian Aldiss. The novel draws its premise from prevalent fears about population growth and overcrowding of the Earth.
== Plot introduction ==
The novel is set in a world of environmental catastrophe and extreme socio-economic inequality. Outside crowded cities controlled by a police state, a class of wealthy and powerful &quot;Farmers&quot; exploit a rural prison labour population and hunt down subversive &quot;Travellers&quot; who have broken free of social controls.

== Cultural impact ==
In 1967, the artist Robert Smithson took a copy of &quot;Earthworks&quot; with him on a trip to the Passaic River in New Jersey (where he created &quot;The Monuments of Passaic, 1967&quot;). He reused the title to describe some of his works, based on natural materials like earth and rocks, and infused with his ideas about entropy and environmental catastrophe.

<doc id="1095684" wikidata="Q490824" url="?curid=1095684" title="Thomas Killigrew">
<text>Thomas Killigrew (7 February 1612 – 19 March 1683) was an English dramatist and theatre manager. He was a witty, dissolute figure at the court of King Charles II of England.

==Life==

Killigrew was one of twelve children of Sir Robert Killigrew of Hanworth, a courtier to James I, and his wife Mary née Woodhouse; he became a page to King Charles I at about the age of thirteen. According to Samuel Pepys, the boy Killigrew used to volunteer as an extra, or &quot;devil,&quot; at the Red Bull Theatre, so that he could see the plays for free. The young Killigrew had limited formal education; the Court and the playhouse were his schoolroom.

Killigrew was present at the exorcism of the possessed nuns of Loudun. In 1635 he left a sceptical account of the proceedings.

Before the English Civil War, Killigrew wrote several plays—tragicomedies like &quot;Claracilla&quot; and &quot;The Prisoners&quot;, as well as his most popular play, &quot;The Parson&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1637). The latter play has been criticized for its coarse humour; but it also contains prose readings of John Donne&#x27;s poetry to pique a literate audience.

A Royalist and Roman Catholic, Killigrew followed Prince Charles (the future Charles II) into exile in 1647. In the years 1649–51, he was in Paris, Geneva, and Rome, and in the later year was appointed Charles&#x27; representative in Venice. (It has been said that Killigrew wrote each of his plays in a different city; &quot;Thomaso, or the Wanderer&quot; was written in Madrid)

At the Restoration in 1660, Killigrew returned to England along with many other Royalist exiles. Charles rewarded his loyalty by making him Groom of the Bedchamber and Chamberlain to Queen Catherine. He had a reputation as a wit; in his famous Diary, Samuel Pepys wrote that Killigrew had the office of the King&#x27;s fool and jester, with privilege to mock and revile even the most prominent without penalty 

Along with Sir William Davenant, he was given a royal warrant to form a theatre company in 1660—which gave Killigrew a key role in the revival of English drama. Killigrew beat Davenant to a debut, at Gibbon&#x27;s Tennis Court in Clare Market, with the new King&#x27;s Company. Its original members were Michael Mohun, William Wintershall, Robert Shatterell, William Cartwright, Walter Clun, Charles Hart and Nicholas Burt. They played for a time at the old Red Bull Theatre, but in 1663 the company moved to the new Theatre Royal in Drury Lane. (Unfortunately, Killigrew gained a reputation as an incompetent manager; he was constantly in disputes with his actors and had to bribe his stars to keep working for him.) Killigrew staged plays by Aphra Behn, John Dryden, William Wycherley...and Thomas Killigrew, as well as revivals of Beaumont and Fletcher. Having inherited the rights and repertory of the old King&#x27;s Men, the King&#x27;s Company performed many of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, in the rewritten forms that were so popular at the time and so disparaged later. Two Killigrew productions of his own &quot;Parson&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, in 1664 and 1672-3, were cast entirely with women.

In 1673, Killigrew was appointed Master of the Revels. He lost control of his theatre in a conflict with his son Charles in 1677. (Charles, in turn, went bust a year later.) Thomas Killigrew died at Whitehall on 19 March 1683.

==Works==

Thomas Killigrew&#x27;s dramas are:

*&quot;The Prisoners&quot; (written c. 1632-5 in London; printed 1641)
*&quot;Claricilla&quot; (c. 1636, Rome; printed 1641)
*&quot;The Princess, or Love at First Sight&quot; (c. 1636; Naples)
*&quot;The Parson&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (c. 1637; Basel, Switzerland)
*&quot;The Pilgrim&quot; (Paris)
*&quot;Bellamira Her Dream, or Love of Shadows&quot; (two-part play; Venice)
*&quot;Cicilia and Clorinda, or Love in Arms&quot; (two-part play; &quot;Cicilia&quot;, c. 1650, Turin; &quot;Clorinda&quot;, 1651, Florence)
*&quot;Thomaso, or the Wanderer&quot; (two-part play; Madrid).

In 1664, Henry Herringman published a collected edition of Killigrew&#x27;s dramas, titled &quot;Comedies and Tragedies&quot; (rather inaccurately, since the majority of the plays are tragicomedies). Only his two earliest plays had been printed previously. The collected edition identifies the city in which Killigrew supposedly wrote each play.

&quot;The Parson&#x27;s Wedding&quot; and &quot;Claricilla&quot; were successful stage plays. Of his last three works, &quot;Thomaso&quot; is a broad comedy based on Killigrew&#x27;s experiences in European exile, while &quot;Bellamira&quot; and &quot;Cicillia&quot; are heroic romances—but all three are closet dramas, ten-act double plays never intended for the stage. Yet oddly enough, Aphra Behn adapted &quot;Thomaso&quot; for her successful &quot;The Rover&quot; (1677). The tragedy &quot;The Pilgrim,&quot; apparently never performed, borrows its plot from James Shirley&#x27;s &quot;The Politician&quot; and reveals many allusions to Shakespeare.

Some critics have considered &quot;The Parson&#x27;s Wedding&quot; to be a Restoration play written before the Restoration, an anticipation of what was to come—and Killigrew himself as a central figure in the transition from English Renaissance theatre to Restoration drama.

==Family==

He married twice.

1 Cecilia Crofts (16?? –1638) in 1636, a maid of honour to Queen Henrietta Maria with a son:
* Henry Killigrew (bapt 16 April 1637 St Martin&#x27;s-in-the-Fields)
2 Charlotte de Hesse (1629 –1716) in 1655; with children:
* Charles Killigrew (29 December 1655 – 1725)
* Thomas Killigrew (the younger) (1657 –1719), who had one successful play, called &quot;Chit-Chat&quot; (1719)
* Robert (Roger) Killigrew (born 17 September 1663)
* Elizabeth Killigrew (born 3 July 1666)

His second wife and their 3 sons were naturalised in an Act of Parliament in 1683.

==The other Killigrews==
Among his 8 siblings known to have survived to adulthood, Thomas had two brothers who also wrote plays:
*Sir William Killigrew (1606–1695), was a Court official (vice chamberlain to the Queen) who wrote four plays: &quot;Selindra&quot;; &quot;Pandora&quot;; and &quot;Ormasdes, or Love and Friendship&quot;—all printed in 1664; and &quot;The Siege of Urbin&quot; (1666), generally considered his best work.
*Henry Killigrew (1613–1700), a clergyman, wrote only one play ... but he wrote it twice. His &quot;The Conspiracy&quot; was published in 1638, apparently pirated; he revised it into &quot;Pallantus and Eudora&quot; (1653). Henry was the father of the poet Anne Killigrew.

<text>Henry King (1592 – 30 September 1669) was an English poet who served as Bishop of Chichester.

==Life==
The elder son of John King, Bishop of London, and his wife Joan Freeman, he was baptised at Worminghall, Buckinghamshire, 16 January 1592. He was educated at Lord Williams&#x27;s School, Westminster School and in 1608 became a student of Christ Church, Oxford. With his brother John King he matriculated 20 January 1609, and was admitted (19 June 1611 and 7 July 1614) to the degrees of bachelor and master of arts. On 24 January 1616 he was collated to the prebend of St. Pancras in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, receiving at the same time the office of penitentiary or confessor in the cathedral, together with the rectory and patronage of Chigwell, Essex. He was made archdeacon of Colchester on 10 April 1617, and soon afterwards received the sinecure rectory of Fulham, in addition to being appointed one of the royal chaplains. All these preferments he held until he was advanced to the episcopal bench.

Late in 1617 he preached a sermon at Paul&#x27;s Cross. About this time King married Anne, eldest daughter of Robert Berkeley, esq., and granddaughter of Sir Maurice Berkeley. There were four or five children of the marriage, but only two survived. His wife died about 1624 at age 24, and was buried in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Her death is the subject of his poem &quot;The Exequy&quot;.

He was a close friend of John Donne, who made him one of his executors, and presented him with his sermons in manuscript, and notes from his reading on over 1400 authors. Other friends were Ben Jonson, George Sandys, Sir Henry Blount, and James Howell. His friendship with Izaak Walton began about 1634, and was lifelong.

After his father&#x27;s death, on Good Friday 1621, a rumour circulated that he had died in communion with the church of Rome. This was the subject of a two pamphlets attributed to Richard Broughton and George Musket. King preached a sermon refuting this claim on 25 November 1621. He was made canon of Christ Church 3 March 1624, and his brother John was made canon in the following August. On 19 May 1625 they were admitted to the degrees of B.D. and D.D.

On 6 February 1639 he was made Dean of Rochester, and on 6 February 1642, the day after the House of Lords had passed the bill to deprive the bishops of their votes, he became Bishop of Chichester; he was also presented to the rectory of Petworth in Sussex. He was residing at his episcopal palace when Chichester surrendered to the parliament in 1643, and his library was seized. He was deprived of the rectory of Petworth, which was given by parliament to Francis Cheynell, and by a resolution of the House of Commons, 27 June 1643, his estates were ordered to be sequestrated. From 1643 to 1651 he lived in the house of his brother-in-law, Sir Richard Hobart of Langley, Buckinghamshire. He was deprived of his See by Parliament on 9 October 1646, as episcopacy was abolished for the duration of the Commonwealth and the Protectorate.

Shortly afterwards King retired to Ritchings, near Langley, the residence of Lady Anne Salter (supposed to be the sister of Brian Duppa), where other members of the King family and John Hales of Eton found refuge. In 1659 King was engaged in negotiations for supplying the vacant bishoprics, and was reinstated at the Restoration (by 20 June 1660), returning to Chichester. On 20 May 1661 he preached at Whitehall, and on 24 April 1662 he delivered an impressive funeral sermon on Bishop Duppa at Westminster Abbey. King died at Chichester 30 September 1669, and was buried in Chichester Cathedral, where the widow of his son John erected a monument to his memory and that of her husband. His second son, Henry, died 21 February 1669; his eldest son, John, died 10 March 1671.

==Works==
King wrote many elegies on royal persons and on his private friends, who included John Donne and Ben Jonson. A selection from his &quot;Poems and Psalms&quot; was published in 1843.

===The &quot;Blackmoor&quot; poems===
A poem by Henry Rainolds and a response by Henry King were included in several manuscript miscellanies of verse. In Rainold&#x27;s poem, an African woman, described as a &quot;Blackmoor&quot;, asks for the love of a white boy. King had the conventional views of the time and in his response, which exists in alternative versions, the boy explains that racial differences keep them apart. In King&#x27;s opinion the interbreeding of races can only produce unwelcome results:

:Prodigious might that union prove,
:Where Night and Day together move,
:And the conjunction of our lips
:Not kisses make but an eclipse;
:In which the mixed black and white
:Portends more terrour than delight.

<text>The Aleutian Islands campaign () was a military campaign fought between 3 June 1942 and 15 August 1943 on and around the Aleutian Islands in the American Theater of World War II during the Pacific War. It was the only military campaign of World War II fought on North American soil. At the time of World War II, Alaska was a territory of the United States.

The islands&#x27; strategic value was their ability to control Pacific transportation routes as US General Billy Mitchell stated to the U.S. Congress in 1935, &quot;I believe that in the future, whoever holds Alaska will hold the world. I think it is the most important strategic place in the world.&quot; The Japanese reasoned that their control of the Aleutians would prevent a possible joining of forces by the Americans and the Soviets and future attack on Japan proper via the Kuril Islands. Similarly, the US feared that the islands could be used as bases from which to launch air raids on West Coast cities such as Anchorage, Seattle, San Francisco, or Los Angeles.

Following two aircraft carrier-based attacks on the American naval base at Dutch Harbor, the Imperial Japanese Navy occupied the islands of Attu and Kiska, where the remoteness of the islands and the challenges of weather and terrain delayed a larger American-Canadian force sent to eject them for nearly a year. 
A battle to reclaim Attu was launched on 11 May 1943 and completed after a final Japanese banzai charge on 29 May. On 15 August 1943 an invasion force landed on Kiska in the wake of a sustained three-week barrage, only to discover that the Japanese had withdrawn from the island on 29 July. The campaign is known as the &quot;Forgotten Battle&quot; because it has been overshadowed by other events in the war.

Many military historians believe that the Japanese invasion of the Aleutians was a diversionary or feint attack during the Battle of Midway that was meant to draw out the US Pacific Fleet from Midway Atoll, as it was launched simultaneously under the same commander, Isoroku Yamamoto. Some historians have argued against that interpretation and believe that the Japanese invaded the Aleutians to protect their northern flank and did not intend it as a diversion.

==Japanese attack==
Before the Empire of Japan entered World War II, the Imperial Japanese Navy had gathered extensive information about the Aleutians but had no up-to-date information regarding military developments on the islands. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto provided the Japanese Northern Area Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Boshirō Hosogaya, with a force of two non-fleet aircraft carriers, five cruisers, twelve destroyers, six submarines, and four troop transports, along with supporting auxiliary ships. With that force, Hosogaya was to launch an air attack against Dutch Harbor then follow with an amphibious attack upon Adak Island, to the west. Hosogaya was instructed to destroy whatever American forces and facilities were found on Adak, but the Japanese did not know the island was undefended. Hosogaya&#x27;s troops were to return to their ships and become a reserve for two additional landings: the first on Kiska, west of Adak, the other on the Aleutians&#x27; westernmost island, Attu, west from Kiska.

Because the Office of Naval Intelligence had broken the Japanese naval codes, Admiral Chester Nimitz learned by May 1942 of Yamamoto&#x27;s plans, including the Aleutian invasion, the strength of both Yamamoto&#x27;s and Hosogaya&#x27;s fleets, and Hosogaya&#x27;s plan attack the Aleutians on 1 June or shortly thereafter.

As of 1 June, the US military strength in Alaska stood at 45,000 men, with about 13,000 at Cold Bay (Fort Randall) on the tip of the Alaska Peninsula and at two Aleutian bases: Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island, west of Cold Bay, and the recently built Fort Glenn Army Air Base on the island of Umnak west of Dutch Harbor. Army strength, less air force personnel, at those three bases totaled no more than 2,300, composed mainly of infantry, field and anti-aircraft artillery troops, and a large construction engineer contingent, which was used in the construction of bases. The Army Air Force&#x27;s Eleventh Air Force consisted of 10 B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers and 34 B-18 Bolo medium bombers at Elmendorf Airfield, and 95 P-40 Warhawk fighters divided between Fort Randall and Fort Glenn. The forward headquarters was set up at Fort Geely, while the rear units were stationed at Fort Richardson. The naval commander was Rear Admiral Robert A. Theobald, commanding Task Force 8 afloat, who as Commander North Pacific Force (ComNorPac) reported to Nimitz in Hawaii. Task Force 8 consisted of five cruisers, thirteen destroyers, three tankers, six submarines, as well as naval aviation elements of Fleet Air Wing Four.

When the first signs of a possible Japanese attack on the Aleutians were known, the Eleventh Air Force was ordered to send out reconnaissance aircraft to locate the Japanese fleet reported heading toward Dutch Harbor and attack it with bombers, concentrating on sinking Hosogaya&#x27;s two aircraft carriers. Once the enemy planes were removed, Naval Task Force 8 would engage the enemy fleet and destroy it. On the afternoon of 2 June, a naval patrol plane spotted the approaching Japanese fleet, reporting its location as southwest of Dutch Harbor. Eleventh Air Force was placed on full alert. Shortly thereafter bad weather set in, and no further sightings of the fleet were made that day.

Before the attack on Dutch Harbor, the Army&#x27;s 4th Infantry Regiment, under command of Colonel Percy E. LeStourgeon, was established at Fort Richardson. LeStourgeon had previously designed a layout of base facilities—such as isolation of weapons and munitions depots—to protect against enemy attack.

===Attack on Dutch Harbor===

According to Japanese intelligence, the nearest field for land-based American aircraft was at Fort Morrow Army Airfield on Kodiak, more than away, and Dutch Harbor was a sitting duck for the strong Japanese fleet, carrying out a coordinated operation with a fleet that was to capture Midway Island.

Making use of weather cover, the Japanese made a two-day aerial bombing of continental North America for the first time in history. The striking force was composed of Nakajima B5N2 &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers from the carriers and . However, only half of the striking force reached their objective. The rest either became lost in the fog and darkness and crashed into the sea or returned to their carriers. Seventeen Japanese planes found the naval base, the first arriving at 05:45. As the Japanese pilots looked for targets to engage, they came under intense anti-aircraft fire and soon found themselves confronted by Eleventh Air Force fighters sent from Fort Glenn. Startled by the American response, the Japanese quickly released their bombs, made a cursory strafing run, and left to return to their carriers. As a result, they did little damage to the base.

On 4 June the Japanese returned to Dutch Harbor. This time, the Japanese pilots were better organized and prepared. When the attack ended that afternoon, Dutch Harbor oil storage tanks were burning, the hospital was partly demolished, and a beached barracks ship was damaged. Although American pilots eventually located the Japanese carriers, attempts to sink the ships failed because bad weather set in that caused the US pilots to lose all contact with the Japanese fleet. However, the weather caused the Japanese to cancel plans to invade Adak with 1,200 men.

===Invasion of Kiska and Attu===
The Japanese invasions and occupations of Kiska on 6 June and Attu on 7 June shocked the American public, as the continental United States was invaded for the first time in 130 years since 1815 (during the War of 1812). The invading forces initially met little resistance from the local Unangax, also known as Aleuts. Though the U.S. Navy had offered to evacuate Attu in May 1942, the Attuan Unangax chief declined. Little changed for the Unangax under Japanese occupation until September 1942 when Japan&#x27;s Aleutian strategy shifted. It was at this point that the Unangax were taken to Hokkaido, Japan, and placed in an internment camp.

The invasion of Attu and imprisonment of the local Unangax became the justification for the United States&#x27; policy of forcible evacuation of the Unangax in the Aleutian Islands. Unangan civilians were placed in internment camps in the Alaska Panhandle.

Through the rest of the summer of 1942, aerial raids by either side could be flown only when the weather permitted. Japan installed a radar warning system on the islands and continued to resupply them, despite heavy disruptions against its shipping by US bombers and submarines. The establishment of American air bases in Umnak and Cold Bay would add to the threat faced by the Japanese.

==Allied response==
Many Americans feared that the Japanese would use the islands as bases to strike within range along the rest of the West Coast. Although the West Coast was subject to attack several times in 1942 (including unrestricted submarine warfare in coastal waters; the bombardment of Ellwood in California; and the bombardment of Fort Stevens in Oregon), the Aleutian Islands campaign of June 1942 was the first major operation by a foreign enemy in the American Theater. Lieutenant Paul Bishop of the 28th Bombardment Group recalled:

Lieutenant Bob Brocklehurst of the 18th Fighter Squadron stated:

On 31 August 1942 American forces attacked Adak Island after scouting it two days earlier. To keep the Japanese on Kiska occupied, missions were flown there by bombers from the Eleventh Air Force. They were escorted by fighter aircraft, including P-38s from Umnak over 600 miles away. Runway construction began immediately following the American landing. After 10 September, fighters and bombers were moved into the new Adak airbase and used to launch more bombing raids against Japanese positions on Kiska.

From September to November, American air raids were able to keep the total number of enemy aircraft low, usually under 14 frames, despite persistent attempts to reinforce their number by the Japanese. Without supporting carriers in the area, the Japanese were unable to dislodge the American forces on Adak. Even when they had a few air assets to spare, the Japanese generally avoided direct combat. Other supplies were also beginning to run low. After evacuating Attu, the Japanese contemplated occupying and setting up a new base on either the Semichis or Amchitka but were not able to carry out those plans.

In February 1943, the Americans successfully occupied Amchitka and built an airstrip there. Their main losses were a result of bad weather. Ground attack missions were flown from the new island base, starting with P-38s and P-40s before bombers also joined in. Their targets included radar installations, parked aircraft, anti-aircraft artillery positions, railway, submarine base, and moored vessels. The bombings further reduced Japan&#x27;s ability to supply its bases, hampered its construction of landing strips on Attu and Kiska, and facilitated the recapture of those two islands later that year. In April 1943 Japanese surface convoys made their final attempt to break through American naval blockade and resupply troops on Attu and Kiska but were forced to abort after being defeated in battle. Future Japanese resupply missions would be conducted exclusively by submarines and limited by how much materiel they could bring.

Navy submarines and surface ships had also been patrolling the area. Kiska Harbor was the main base for Japanese ships in the campaign and several were sunk there, some by warships but mostly in air raids. On 5 July 1942 the submarine , under command of Lieutenant Commander Howard Gilmore, attacked three Japanese destroyers off Kiska. She sank one and heavily damaged the others, killing or wounding 200 Japanese sailors. Ten days later, was attacked by three Japanese submarine chasers in Kiska Harbor, with two of the patrol craft sunk and one other damaged. On 12 May 1943 the Japanese submarine was sunk in a surface action with the destroyer northeast of Chichagof Harbor.

At least three Japanese submarines were sunk near Kiska in June 1943, reportedly on the 11th, 13th, and 22nd.

===Komandorski Islands===
A cruiser and destroyer force under Rear Admiral Charles &quot;Soc&quot; McMorris was assigned to eliminate the Japanese supply convoys. They met the Japanese fleet in March 1943. One American cruiser and two destroyers were damaged, and seven US sailors were killed. Two Japanese cruisers were damaged, with 14 men killed and 26 wounded. Japan thereafter abandoned all attempts to resupply the Aleutian garrisons by surface vessels, and only submarines would be used.

===Attu Island===

On 11 May 1943 American forces commenced Operation Landcrab to recapture Attu. The invasion force included the 17th and 32nd Infantry regiments of the 7th Infantry Division and a platoon of scouts recruited from Alaska, nicknamed Castner&#x27;s Cutthroats. The army air force flew more than 500 sorties in a 20-day period to support the invasion. A shortage of landing craft, unsuitable beaches, and equipment that failed to operate in the appalling weather made it difficult however for the Americans to exert force against the Japanese. Soldiers suffered from frostbite because essential cold-weather supplies could not be landed, and soldiers could not be relocated to where they were needed because vehicles could not operate on the tundra. Rather than engage the Americans where they landed, Colonel Yasuyo Yamasaki had his forces dig into the high ground far from the shore. That resulted in fierce combat, with a total of 3,829 US casualties, with 549 killed, 1,148 wounded, and another 1,200 suffering severe injuries from the cold weather. Also, 614 Americans died from disease and 318 from miscellaneous causes, mainly Japanese booby traps or friendly fire.

On 29 May 1943 without warning the remainder of Japanese forces attacked near Massacre Bay. Recorded as one of the largest banzai charges of the Pacific campaign, Yamasaki penetrated so deep into US lines that Japanese soldiers encountered rear-echelon units of the Americans. After furious, brutal, often hand-to-hand combat, the Japanese force was virtually exterminated. Only 28 Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner, none of them were officers. American burial teams counted 2,351 Japanese dead, but it was thought that hundreds more had been buried by bombardment during the battle.

With its loss of Attu to U.S. forces, Japan was deprived of its only remaining airstrip in the Aleutians, a disadvantage that it could not compensate for because Japanese aviation units were entirely ground-based.

===Kiska Island===

On 15 August 1943 an invasion force of 34,426 Canadian and American troops landed on Kiska. Castner&#x27;s Cutthroats were part of the force, but the invasion consisted mainly of units from the 7th Infantry Division. The force also included about 5,300 Canadians, mostly from the 13th Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 6th Canadian Infantry Division, and the 1st Special Service Force, a 2,000-strong Canadian-American commando unit formed in 1942 in Montana and trained in winter warfare techniques. The force included three 600-man regiments: the 1st was to go ashore in the first wave at Kiska Harbor, the 2nd was to be held in reserve to parachute where needed, and the 3rd was to land on the north side of Kiska on the second day of the assault. The 87th Regiment of the 10th Mountain Division, the only major U.S. force specifically trained for mountain warfare, was also part of the operation.

Royal Canadian Air Force No. 111 and No. 14 Squadrons saw active service in the Aleutian skies and scored at least one aerial kill on a Japanese aircraft. Additionally, three Canadian armed merchant cruisers and two corvettes served in the Aleutian campaign but did not encounter enemy forces.

It is likely that the main Japanese forces left Kiska on the night of 28 July when its radio became silent. During the subsequent two weeks, the Army Air Force and the navy bombed and shelled the abandoned positions. The day before the withdrawal, the US Navy fought an inconclusive and possibly meaningless Battle of the Pips to the west.

The allied invasion forces encountered no opposition on 15 August, but their total casualties would in the end number 313 due to friendly fire, vehicle accidents, Japanese booby traps and explosives, disease and frostbite. Like Attu, Kiska offered an extremely hostile environment.

==Aftermath==


Although plans were drawn up for attacking northern Japan, they were not executed. Over 1,500 sorties were flown against the Kuriles before the end of the war, including the Japanese base of Paramushir, which diverted 500 Japanese planes and 41,000 ground troops.

The battle also marked the first time that Canadian conscripts were sent to a combat zone in World War II. The government had pledged not to send draftees &quot;overseas&quot;, which it defined as being outside North America. The Aleutians were considered to be North American soil, which enabled the Canadian government to deploy conscripts without breaking its pledge. There were cases of desertion before the brigade sailed for the Aleutians. In late 1944, the government changed its policy on draftees and sent 16,000 conscripts to Europe to take part in the fighting. The battle also marked the first combat deployment of the 1st Special Service Force, but it did not see any action.

In the summer of 1942, the Americans recovered the Akutan Zero, an almost-intact Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero fighter, which enabled the Americans to test-fly the Zero and contributed to improved fighter tactics later in the war.

===Killed in action===
During the campaign, two cemeteries were established on Attu to bury those killed in action: Little Falls Cemetery, at the foot of Gilbert Ridge, and Holtz Bay Cemetery, which held the graves of Northern Landing Forces. After the war, the tundra began to take back the cemeteries and so in 1946, all American remains were relocated as directed by the soldier&#x27;s family or to Fort Richardson near Anchorage, Alaska. On 30 May 1946 a Memorial Day address was given by Captain Adair with a 21-gun salute and the sounding of &quot;Taps&quot;. The Decoration of Graves was performed by Chaplains Meaney and Insko.

==Legacy==
Many of the United States locations involved in the campaign, either directly or indirectly, have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and several have been designated National Historic Landmarks. The battlefield on Attu and the Japanese occupation site on Kiska are both National Historic Landmarks and are included in the Aleutian Islands World War II National Monument. Surviving elements of the military bases at Adak, Umnak, and Dutch Harbor are National Historic Landmarks. The shipwrecked , badly damaged during the attack on Dutch Harbor, is listed on the National Register, as is a crash-landed B-24D Liberator on Atka Island.

The 2006 documentary film &quot;Red White Black &amp; Blue&quot; features two veterans of the Attu Island campaign, Bill Jones and Andy Petrus. It is directed by Tom Putnam and debuted at the 2006 Locarno International Film Festival in Locarno, Switzerland, on 4 August 2006.

Dashiell Hammett spent most of World War II as an Army sergeant in the Aleutian Islands, where he edited an Army newspaper. He came out of the war suffering from emphysema. As a corporal in 1943, he co-authored &quot;The Battle of the Aleutians&quot; with Corporal Robert Garland Colodny under the direction of Infantry Intelligence Officer Major Henry W. Hall.

<doc id="1095691" wikidata="Q2579604" url="?curid=1095691" title="William Kingsford">
<text>William Kingsford (23 December 1819 – 29 September 1898) was an English-born Canadian historian and civil engineer. He is best known for his &quot;History of Canada&quot; in 10 volumes (1887–1898), which was widely read by both the upper middle class and Anglophone teachers.

Born in London, England, Kingsford traveled to Canada, where he served in the army before engaging in surveying work. He was a self-taught historian, and one of the first to use the archives being gathered in Ottawa. He was also a civil engineer, working across North America to install railways such as the Hudson River Railroad. His work led him to Panama, where he assisted in construction of the Panama Canal Railway. Kingsford served a brief term as the chief engineer of Toronto, Canada.

Kingsford believed that the Conquest of New France guaranteed victory for British constitutional liberty and that it ensured material progress. He assumed the assimilation of French Canadians into a superior British culture was inevitable and desirable, for he envisioned Canada as one nation with one anglophone population.

==Early life==
Born on 23 December 1819 in the parish of St. Lawrence Jewry, London, he was the son of William and Elizabeth Kingsford of Lad Lane. Educated at Nicholas Wanostrocht&#x27;s school in Camberwell, he was articled at an early age to an architect. He then enlisted in the 1st Dragoon Guards, aged 16. He went with his regiment to Canada in 1837, became sergeant, and in 1840, through the influence of his friends at home, obtained his discharge, despite an offer by Sir George Cathcart, colonel of the regiment, to procure a commission for him.

==Civil engineer==
Entering the office of the city surveyor of Montreal in 1841, Kingford qualified in due course as civil engineer, and obtained the position of deputy city surveyor, a post which he held for three years. He resigned to begin the publication of the &quot;Montreal Times&quot;, in company with Murdo McIver. Two years later he entered the public works department, and among other undertakings made a new survey of the Lachine Canal.

In 1849 Kingsford was engaged in the construction of the Hudson River Railroad in the state of New York. In he 1851 went to Panama as assistant engineer to J. J. Campbell, who was then building the Panama Canal Railway. Returning to Canada in 1853, he surveyed for the Grand Trunk Railway railroad tracks running from Montreal to Vaudreuil, from Montreal to Cornwall, Ontario, from Brockville to Rideau, and, under A. M. Ross, laid down the lines of the Victoria Bridge.

Kingsford was chief engineer of the city of Toronto for a few months during 1855, but resigned to re-enter the service of the Grand Trunk, in whose employment he remained till 1864. He acted at first as superintendent of the line east from Toronto, and afterwards as contractor to maintain the section that runs from that city westward to Stratford. He came to England in 1865, where he made one or two general surveys on the continent for English firms. He reported to Thomas Brassey on the railway possibilities of the island of Sardinia.

In 1867, the building of the Intercolonial Railway took Kingsford to Canada once more to Canada, where he remained for the rest of his life. He worked on the enlargement of the Grenville Canal and the draining of Russell, Ontario, moving to Ottawa. When the Mackenzie government came into power in 1872 Kingsford was appointed dominion engineer in charge of the harbours of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. He continued in this post till 31 December 1879, when he was dismissed by Sir Hector Langevin, minister of public works.

==Later life==
At the age of 60, Kingsford then turned to Canadian history. Queen&#x27;s University and Dalhousie University recognised Kingsford&#x27;s historical works by conferring on him the degree of LL.D.; and McGill University gave his name to a recently endowed chair of history. He survived the completion of his &quot;History&quot; by a few months only, and died on 28 September 1898.

==Works==
Kingsford began writing for the press, and published some pamphlets:

* &quot;The History, Structure, and Statistics of Plank-roads&quot;, 1852
* &quot;Impressions of the West and South&quot;, 1858
* &quot;The Canadian Canals: their History and Cost&quot;, 1865

and a monograph on Canadian history entitled &quot;A Political Coin&quot;.

Kingsford studied of the archives of Canada, collected at Ottawa, from 1880. He published &quot;Canadian Archæology&quot; in 1886, soon followed by the &quot;Early Bibliography of Ontario&quot;. He published the first volume of the &quot;History of Canada&quot; in 1887. The tenth and last volume went up to the union of Upper and Lower Canada (1841), and was printed in 1898, with a preface dated 24 May.

Kingsford was a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, to which he contributed several papers, and a member of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers. He published correspondence and proceedings related to his sacking in a pamphlet &quot;Mr. Kingsford and Sir Hector Langevin&quot; (1882).

==Family==
In 1848 Kingsford married Maria Margaret, daughter of William Burns Lindsay, clerk of the legislative assembly of the province of Canada. Queen Victoria gave her his widow&#x27;s civil list pension after his death.

<doc id="1095692" wikidata="Q7411087" url="?curid=1095692" title="Samuel Chandler">
<text>Samuel Chandler (1693 – 8 May 1766) was an English Nonconformist minister and pamphleteer. He has been called the &quot;uncrowned patriarch of Dissent&quot; in the latter part of George II&#x27;s reign.

==Early life==
Samuel Chandler was born at Hungerford in Berkshire, the son of Henry Chandler (d.1719), a Dissenting minister, and his wife Mary Bridgeman. His father was the first settled Presbyterian minister at Hungerford since the Toleration Act 1688. In or around 1700 the family moved to Bath, where for the remainder of his life Henry ministered to the congregation that met at Frog Lane.

He was the younger brother of the Bath poet Mary Chandler, whose biography he wrote for inclusion in Theophilus Cibber&#x27;s &quot;The Lives of the Poets&quot; (1753).

As a child he displayed an &#x27;early genius for learning&#x27;, and this was encouraged by his family. He excelled in the classics and is said to have already mastered Greek by the time he entered the dissenting academy at Bridgwater, where he was a student of the Rev John Moore (d.1747). He later attended Samuel Jones&#x27; academy at Gloucester. Here he was a contemporary of Bishop Butler and Archbishop Secker, who in spite of their later churchmanship and high preferment remained life-long friends.

== Career ==
In 1714, Chandler began a preaching ministry in London. During this time he shared a house with Secker, who had returned to England after studying in Leiden. In 1716, he was chosen as minister of the Presbyterian Hanover Chapel in Peckham and ordained in December of that year.

Through the South Sea Bubble crash of 1720, Chandler lost the fortune which his wife had brought to their marriage. This left him in straitened circumstances, and from about 1723 he supplemented his income by working as a bookseller at the Cross Keys in the Poultry, London. In 1725, having read his recently published &quot;A Vindication of the Christian Religion&quot;, Archbishop Wake wrote to him expressing surprise that &#x27;so much good learning and just reasoning in a person of your profession, and do think it pity you should not rather spend your time in writing books than in selling them&#x27;.

It was partly due to the success of &quot;A Vindication,&quot; which brought together sermons he had delivered at the Old Jewry Meeting-house in defence of Christian revelation, that Chandler was invited to be the assistant minister under Thomas Leavesley at the Old Jewry in 1726. During this time he continued to preach at Peckham. In 1728 he was appointed pastor at the Old Jewry, the congregation offering him an extra £100 a year on the condition that he give up bookselling. He held this position for the rest of his life.

Over time he came to play a leading role in the affairs of London Dissenters. From 1730 he was a member of the Presbyterian Board, and from 1744 of Dr Williams&#x27;s Trust. It was largely as a result of his influence, particularly among wealthy dissenters, that a relief society for widows and orphaned children of Protestant dissenting ministers was established in 1733. In a similar way he co-ordinated the formation of The Society for the Propagation of the Knowledge of God among the Germans, formed in 1753 to assist German dissenters in the British Colony of Pennsylvania.

=== Beliefs and writings ===
Chandler was an extensive writer, and through his pamphlets, sermons and letters he engaged energetically with the religious disputes of the day. He was an impassioned proponent of civil and religious liberty, advocating freedom of conscience and the appeal to reason in matters of belief.

&#x27;Tis with great pleasure, that I observe that the principles of liberty are every day gaining ground, and that a censorious persecuting bigot is now generally looked on with contempt, and treated as a common enemy to mankind. Grave looks, and magisterial dictates must now no longer pass for arguments&#x27; (Samuel Chandler, &quot;Reflections on the Conduct of Modern Deists,&quot; 1727)His work appears to owe a particular debt to the Christian philosopher Samuel Clarke, and stands broadly in the Lockean tradition.

==== Subscription, penal laws and comprehension ====
Theologically Chandler belonged to the liberal wing of Dissent. He believed in the sufficiency of a reasoned approach to Scripture, and was hostile to the claims of human tradition and authority. As such, he was among those who argued against the imposition of creeds or articles of faith as tests of orthodoxy. In the Salters&#x27; Hall meetings of 1719, which concerned themselves with subscription to the doctrine of the Trinity, he was among the non-subscribing majority. Chandler&#x27;s Trinitarian theology is said to have derived from Samuel Clarke&#x27;s &quot;The Scripture-Doctrine of the Trinity&quot; (1712), and he is often described as an Arian, or having Arian leanings.

In the introduction to his translation of Philipp van Limborch&#x27;s &quot;Historia Inquistionis&quot; (1731) he discusses subscription at some length, where he describes the practice as having &#x27;ever been a Grievance in the Church of God&#x27;. He took up the subject again in anonymous contributions to the &quot;Old Whig&quot; periodical in 1737. Subsequent debates led to the publication of &quot;The Case of Subscription to Explanatory Articles of Faith&quot; (1748).

In a number of works published in the 1730s Chandler challenged the penal laws governing Dissenters, which through various tests and subscriptions barred them from full participation in civic life. In 1732 he supported those petitioning parliament for their repeal with a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Dispute Better Adjusted,&quot; and in his 1735 sermons against Roman Catholicism earned the censure of several Anglicans for his &#x27;unseasonal&#x27; demands for the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts. This was followed by &quot;The Case of the Protestant Dissenters&quot; (1736) and an open letter to the Lord Mayor of London in 1738.

By the time he published &quot;The Case of Subscription&quot; Chandler was expressing his disinclination to engage in any further &#x27;publick Debates concerning Party Affairs&#x27;. Time had &#x27;softened&#x27; his mind on such issues, and establishing a common front against the &#x27;impieties of the present generation&#x27; was of more importance. Besides ties of friendship, he shared a common outlook with the Latitudinarian leaders of the Anglican Church, and spoke warmly of his relations with them. In the same year he was engaged in informal discussions with Thomas Herring, Thomas Gooch and Thomas Sherlock about the possibility of an act of comprehension, which would enable Dissenters to enter the Established fold in good conscience. To overcome doctrinal objections he suggested that the church&#x27;s articles by re-written in scriptural language, and that the Athanasian Creed ought to be discarded. These overly ambitious proposals came to nothing, and Chandler came under fire from fellow Dissenters for acting with presumption.

==== Deism ====
In &quot;A Vindication of the Christian Religion&quot; (1725) and &quot;Reflections on the Conduct of Modern Deists&quot; (1727) he defended the scriptural, revealed basis of Christianity against attacks by deists, particularly Anthony Collins. This focused on the argument from miracles and prophecy. At the same time he upheld his opponents&#x27; right of conscience and expression against those calling for their censorship.

In 1741 he entered once again into the deist controversy with &quot;A Vindication of the History of the Old Testament.&quot; This was a response to Thomas Morgan&#x27;s &quot;The Moral Philosopher&quot; (1738-1740), whose third volume included a character assassination of Joseph. Chandler followed &quot;A Vindication&quot; with his &quot;Defence of the Prime Ministry and Character of Joseph&quot; (1743).

The debate also promoted a contribution from the deist Peter Annet, who in the same year published his &quot;The Resurrection of Jesus Considered&quot; (1744). Continuing on from the work of Thomas Woolston in the 1720s, it questioned the reliability of the gospel accounts of the Resurrection. Chandler&#x27;s answer was contained in &quot;The Witnesses of the Resurrection of Jesus re-examined, and their testimony proved entirely consistent&quot; (London, 1744). John Leland, in his overview of deist writers, called it a &#x27;very valuable treatise&#x27; that showed &#x27;great clearness and judgement&#x27;.

His apologetic, &quot;Plain Reasons for Being a Christian&quot; (London, 1730), was a more indirect reply to freethinking critiques of Christianity. It was advanced on the same grounds, however, making its appeal to &#x27;the Truth and Reason of Things&#x27; arrived at by a &#x27;free and rational Choice&#x27;. Like Clarke, he argued that human reason, which is capable of arriving at natural religion, needed to be supplemented by revelation. But the test of this revelation would be its consistency with reason.

==== Roman Catholicism ====
Chandler was vehement in his opposition to Roman Catholicism, and this was sharpened by events which seem to threaten the Protestant Revolution of 1688.

In 1735 he took part in a series of controversial lectures organised by Dissenters at Salters&#x27; Hall in London, aimed at what they perceived to be the growing threat of &quot;popery&quot;, particularly from missionaries. His contributions were published in &quot;Seventeen Sermons against Popery preached at Salter&#x27;s Hall&quot; (London, 1735), as well as separately. These advanced a Protestant ecclesiology over and against claims of Roman supremacy, embodied in Bellarmine&#x27;s fifteen Marks of the Church. As well as being accused by Richard Challoner of wilfully misrepresenting Roman Catholicism, Chandler&#x27;s sermons were among those that drew criticism from Anglicans. While supportive of his purposes, they took issue with his remarks on the episcopacy (&#x27;The Mission of Bishops and Prelates is in itself a trifling Circumstance, of little or not importance...&#x27;) and apostolic succession.

Shortly afterwards Chandler joined John Eames and Jeremiah Hunt in talks with two Roman priests at the Bell tavern in Nicholas Lane, London. The debate ranged over issues such as the authority of the Pope, transubstantiation, and praying to saints and angels. An account of the second conference was written by Chandler and published by John Gray, his successor at the Cross Keys.

== Recognition ==
In his &quot;Biographia Britannica&quot; (1778-1793) the minister Andrew Kippis, who worked on some of his literary remains, described Chandler as: &#x27;...a man of very extensive learning, and eminent abilities; his apprehension was quick, and his judgement penetrating; he had a warm and vigorous imagination; he was a very instructive and animated preacher; and his talents in the pulpit, and as a writer, procured him very great and general esteem, not only among the Dissenters, but among large numbers of the established Church&#x27;In a letter of 1747 Archbishop Herring wrote of Chandler that &#x27;I really affect and honour the man, and wish with all my soul that the Church of England had him; for his spirit and learning are certainly of the first class&#x27;. He had been offered high and lucrative preferment in the Church of England, but chose to remain a Presbyterian to the end of his life on the grounds of conscience.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in December 1754. The only known portrait of Chandler, executed by Mason Chamberlin, was bequeathed to the Royal Society by his brother, the apothecary John Chandler FRS. He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquarians. In common with other respected Dissenters he was made a Doctor of Divinity by both Edinburgh University (1755) and King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen (1756). In the past Chandler had turned down honorary degrees because, as he put it, &quot;so many blockheads had been made Doctors&quot;.

== Death ==
Chandler died on 8 May 1766. During the last year of his life he had suffered from re-occurrences of a &#x27;very painful disorder&#x27;.

He was buried in what became the family vault at Bunhill Fields in London on 16 May. His funeral sermon was preached at the Old Jewry by his friend, Thomas Amory. Amory later wrote a short memoir of Chandler to preface his posthumously published sermons, and together with Nathaniel White replaced him as a co-pastor at the Old Jewry.

== Family ==
On 17 September 1719, Chandler married Elizabeth Rutter at St Giles&#x27; Church, Camberwell. Elizabeth was the daughter of Benjamin Rutter, leather dresser of Bermondsey, and his wife Elizabeth. They had six children: Elizabeth (d. before 1772), wife of Thomas Mitchell, tailor of Bucklersbury, London; Sarah (d.1791), wife of the classical scholar Edward Harwood (1729-1794); Catherine (&quot;Kitty&quot;), wife of William Ward, packer of Sise-lane, London, and Mary (&quot;Polly&quot;), who remained unmarried. His two sons pre-deceased him.

Chandler&#x27;s widow died in 1773. In her will she left £1860 in individual bequests. The residue of her estate went to her daughter Mary.

==Works ==
*&quot;The History of the Inquisition&quot; (1731); English translation of Philippus van Limborch&#x27;s &quot;Historia Inquisitionis&quot; (1692). Chandler wrote a substantial introduction to Van Limborch&#x27;s original four volume Latin preface to the &quot;Liber Sententiarum Inquisitionis Tolosanae (1308–1323),&quot; and published his translation in two Volumes.

<doc id="1095693" wikidata="Q165593" url="?curid=1095693" title="Robert de Ros (died 1285)">
<text>Sir Robert de Ros (before 1237 – 13 May 1285) was an English nobleman.

==Family==
Robert de Ros of Helmsley, Yorkshire, born c. 1225, was the son of Sir William de Ros (died c. 1264/5) and Lucy FitzPeter, the daughter of Peter FitzHerbert and Alice FitzRoger. He had five brothers, Sir Peter, Sir William, Sir Alexander, Sir Herbert, and John, and two sisters, Lucy and Alice.

He was the grandson of Sir Robert de Ros, one of the twenty-five barons who guaranteed the observance of Magna Carta, and Isabel of Scotland, an illegitimate daughter of William the Lion, King of the Scots, by Isabel, a daughter of Robert Avenel.

==Career==
On 24 December 1264 he was summoned to Simon de Montfort&#x27;s Parliament in London as &quot;Robert de Ros&quot;, and for some time it was considered that the barony was created by writ in that year, and that Robert de Ros was the 1st Baron Ros. According to &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot;:

In 1616 the barony of De Ros was allowed precedence from this writ [of 24 December 1264], a decision adopted by the Lords in 1806 (Round, &quot;Peerage and Pedigree&quot;, vol. i, pp. 249-50); but these writs, issued by Simon in the King&#x27;s name, are no longer regarded as valid for the creation of peerages.

Accordingly, the barony is now considered to have been created when Robert&#x27;s eldest son, William de Ros was summoned to Parliament from 6 February 1299 to 16 October 1315 by writs directed &quot;Willelmo de Ros de Hamelak&quot;.

On 3 July 1257, Ros obtained from Henry III a grant of the free warren, in the lordship of Belvoir, by which the boundary was determined. In 1258, he was actively employed in Scotland, in delivering King Alexander III of Scotland out of the hands of his rebellious subjects; and at Chester, in resisting the hostile invasions of Llewelyn the Last. In the same year, he and his lady Isabel had a controversy with the Prior and Convent of Belvoir, relative to the right of presentation to the Church of Redmile (near Bottesford), which was amicably compromised by their relinquishing the patronage to the convent, for a certain compensation. In 1261 he obtained from the king the grant of a weekly market, to be held at Belvoir, on Tuesday; and of an annual fair on the feast of St John the Baptist, to continue for three days. In 1264, he was one of the insurgent barons who defeated Henry III at the battle of Lewes, and took him and the prince prisoner, confining them in Farleigh Hungerford Castle. In 1264, de Ros was summoned to the parliament, which was called by the barons in the king&#x27;s name. He died in 1285, and was buried at Kirkham Priory.

==Marriage and issue==
Robert de Ros married, Bef. 17 May 1246, Isabel d&#x27;Aubigny (c.1233 – 15 June 1301), granddaughter (her father, William, died in 1247) and heiress of William d&#x27;Aubigny (died 1236) of Belvoir, Leicestershire, by his second wife, Isabel, by whom he had five sons and three daughters:

*William de Ros, 1st Baron de Ros.
*Sir Robert de Ros of Gedney, Lincolnshire, who married a wife named Erneburge.
*John de Ros.
*Nicholas de Ros, a cleric.
*Peter de Ros, a cleric.
*Isabel de Ros, who married Walter de Fauconberg, 2nd Baron Fauconberg.
*Joan de Ros, who married John Lovell, 1st Baron Lovell.
*Mary de Ros, who married William de Braose, 1st Baron Braose.

<doc id="1095694" wikidata="Q224144" url="?curid=1095694" title="Greccio">
<text>Greccio () is an old hilltown and &quot;comune&quot; of the province of Rieti in the Italian region of Lazio, overhanging the Rieti Valley on a spur of the Monti Sabini, a sub-range of the Apennines, about by road northwest of Rieti, the nearest large town.

It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;). The town hall of the comune is in the &quot;frazione&quot; of Limiti di Greccio.

Greccio was the place where, in December 1223, Saint Francis of Assisi devised the first living Nativity scene (in Italian: &quot;presepe&quot;). The Nativity scene tradition continues there to this day, and a memorial of Saint Francis, the Sanctuary of Greccio, may be visited.

==Etymology==
The first hypothesis on the tymology of the town&#x27;s name is linked to the settlement of ancient Greek colonists in the same place where Greccio now stands. Hence the name, according to this hypothesis, &quot;Grecia&quot;, &quot;Grece&quot;, &quot;Grecce&quot; and finally Greccio.

According to other hypotheses, the name of Greccio used during the Middle Ages, &quot;curtis de Greze&quot;, derives from &quot;curtis&quot;, i.e. from a self-sufficient medieval economic organization managed by a lord, and from &quot;&quot;greze&quot; or &quot;grezze&quot;&quot; i.e. crushed stone (in Italian, &quot;pietre grezze&quot;), which recalls the presence of a stone quarry used at the time. According to this hypothesis, the name Greccio does not therefore derive from the ancient presence of Greek colonists.

==History==

Modern Greccio, which is of medieval origin, was founded on lands of ancient Greek colonization, in a place where there was, in ancient times, a colony founded by colonists from Magna Graecia. They had fled or were exiled from their homeland as a result of war.

The earliest records of Greccio date back to the 10th and 11th centuries with the name of &quot;curtis de Greze&quot;. The Benedictine Monk, Gregory of Catino (1062–1133) refers to the town of &quot;&quot;Grecciae&quot; in his work &quot;Summary Farfense&quot;&quot;. From the remains of the ancient buildings, it shows that Greccio became a fortified medieval castle surrounded by walls and protected by a six towers fortress.

In documents from the 11th century, the toponym of Greccio is cited with many variations, until 1091, when the name &quot;Grecciae&quot;, from which the current name derives, seems to spread; the community also experiences a fair amount of development, favored by the abundance of flat arable land and good pastures.

During the struggle with neighboring cities, the castle was destroyed in 1242 by the troops of Frederick II. They had a difficult history until 1799 when the town was destroyed and looted by the Napoleonic army. The town was called for the first time with its current name &quot;Greccio&quot; around 1720.
Greccio was the place where, in December 1223, Saint Francis of Assisi devised the first living Nativity scene (in Italian: &quot;presepe&quot;). Francis&#x27; 1223 living nativity scene is commemorated on the calendars of the Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican liturgical calendars, and its creation is described by Saint Bonaventure in his &quot;Life of Saint Francis of Assisi&quot; c. 1260.

Saint Francis&#x27; manger scene is said to have been enacted at Christmas 1223 in a cave near the Sanctuary of Greccio. The very small chapel where it is said to have taken place survives. The painting over its altar, and others before 1400, by Giotto at the Assisi Lower Church, and by Antonio Vite in Pistoia, depict Saint Francis kneeling and placing a small baby into a chest-like manger. Giotto adds a miniature ox and ass. The Nativity scene tradition continues there to this day, and a memorial of Saint Francis, the Sanctuary of Greccio, may be visited.

==Main sights==

===Sanctuary of Greccio===


The Hermitage of Greccio Sanctuary () is one of the four shrines erected by Saint Francis of Assisi in the Sacred Valley, along with the Sanctuary of Fonte Colombo, the Sanctuary of the Forest, and the convent of Poggio Bustone. Francis presented the first living Nativity scene in a nearby cave in December 1223.

Inside there are frescoes modern and original chapel of the saint carved in the rock. Francis, recalling a visit he had made years before to Bethlehem, resolved to create the manger he had seen there. The ideal spot was a cave in nearby Greccio. He would find a baby, hay upon which to lay him, an ox, and an ass to stand beside the manger. Word went out to the people of the town.

At the appointed time, the townspeople arrived carrying torches and candles. One of the friars began celebrating Mass while Francis himself gave the sermon. His biographer, Thomas of Celano, recalls that Francis stood before the manger, overwhelmed with love and filled with a wonderful happiness. For Francis, the simple celebration was meant to recall the hardships Jesus suffered even as an infant, a savior who chose to become poor for our sake, a truly human Jesus. The Sanctuary of Greccio may be visited.

===Other architectures===
The medieval town that preserves part of the pavement of the old castle (11th century) and three of the six towers. The parish church of San Michele Archangel is located next to the bell tower on top of a flight of steps and dates back to the 11th century. The church was built over a part of the castle. The church was destroyed and rebuilt several times. The church as a Nave and side chapels. Two of the side chapels, dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua and Our Lady Immaculate have paintings and frescoes of the 15th and 16th century, and stucco decorations created in 1636. Remarkable from an artistic point of view are the baptismal font, the main altar, a gilded silver chalice and a monstrance, all dating back to the 16th century. In the square, there is the Church of Santa Maria del Giglio from the 14th century. This church also is a single aisle or Nave. It has a central altar and two side altars, stucco Roman school with influences of Carlo Fontana, and tempera paintings dated to the early 15th century. The high altar preserves, a fresco, which represents the Virgin and Child with Angels.

Inside the International Museum of the Crib there are nativity scenes from all the cultures of the world on display; outside it there is a statue of Saint Francis high.

===Natural areas===
Greccio is surrounded by oak and elm forests, on which Mount Lacerone () stands out and gives a view of the entire Rieti Valley. Here, St. Francis of Assisi, would retire in prayer and meditation in a hut protected by two hornbeam plants. In this same place, in 1712, by popular demand, it was built a memorial chapel dedicated to him, &quot;the chapel&quot;. Here Saint Francis of Assisi used to retreat in prayer and meditation, in a hut protected by two hornbeam trees. On the top stands &quot;la Cappelletta&quot;, a small chapel built in 1792 in his memory.

==Geography==
The town of Greccio is located in Sabina, in Upper Lazio, on the border with Umbria. The medieval town of Greccio stands on a ridge of the Monti Sabini, on the western edge of the Rieti Valley, at above sea level (about higher than the valley floor).

The flat part of the town territory extends into the underlying Rieti Valley and includes the &quot;frazioni&quot; of Spinacceto, Limiti di Greccio (where the town hall is located) and Sellecchia.

On this occasion, nativity scenes are present throughout the town, and the main piazza of Greccio hosts a nativity scene art market. The living nativity scene recited by the local population, dressed in period clothing, is staged in front of the Sanctuary of Greccio, in memory of the historic event of 1223.

===Roads===

Greccio has a junction on the Rieti-Terni dual carriageway (SS 79), which runs at the foot of the mountains where the town stands.

The Reopasto provincial road (SP1) also runs through the valley floor, the main road connecting with Rieti and Terni before the construction of the dual carriageway. Along the SP1 there are its &quot;frazioni&quot; of Spinacceto, Limiti di Greccio (where the town hall are located) and Sellecchia.

The comune of Greccio and the Franciscan sanctuary are located along the provincial road SP1, a branch of the SP1 which originates in Sellecchia and reconnects to the SP1 near Spinacceto.

<text>Unione Sportiva Catanzaro 1929, or simply Catanzaro, is a professional football club based in Catanzaro, Calabria, Italy, that competes in Serie B, the second tier of the Italian football, following a 17-year absence.

The club was initially formed with the merger of two local clubs in 1927 before being officially founded in 1929. Since then, the club has primarily competed in the lower divisions of the national competitions and has been re-founded twice, once in 2006 and again in 2011, both for financial reasons.

Since its foundation, the official colours of the club have been red and yellow. The team has used these colours predominantly in their kits, frequently playing in either all-red kits with yellow trims or in red and yellow stripes. The club&#x27;s official emblem is the golden eagle, in honour of the city&#x27;s coat of arms. The team plays its home matches at the Stadio Nicola Ceravolo, which was built in 1919 and is the oldest sports facility in Calabria.

In its history, Catanzaro has played seven seasons in Serie A, five of which were consecutive. The best performance in Serie A was a seventh place finish in 1981–82 and an eighth-place finish in 1980–81.

The club has won seven championships since its foundation. Six of these were in the third tier (one in Prima Divisione, two in Serie C, and three in Serie C1). The final championship was won in IV Serie in 1953. This year, the club was also national title holders after winning the Scudetto IV Serie. At youth level, the club won the Dante Berretti Trophy of Serie C in 1991–1992.

In the Coppa Italia, Catanzaro&#x27;s best results were runners-up in 1965–66, and semi-finalists in 1978–79 and 1981–82.

On 30 May 2018, the club, which had already used the historic logo since 2011, announced the return of the old name &quot;Unione Sportiva Catanzaro&quot;, with the final addition of &quot;1929&quot;.

==History==

=== Origins to pre-World War II ===
The club was initially founded by the merger of two local teams (la Braccini and la Scalfaro) as Unione Sportiva Catanzarese in 1927, and competed in the Terza Divisione interregional group of Calabria &amp; Basilicata, which was the fourth tier of Italian football at the time. Following a visit to the city from fascist leader Benito Mussolini, the club was officially founded with the name change of Unione Sportiva Fascista Catanzarese in 1929. The club continued to compete in the Terza Divisione for the 1929–30 season where it gained promotion for a second place finish directly into the third tier, the Prima Divisione, for the 1930–31 season. After spending three seasons in this division, Catanzarese gained promotion into Serie B for the first time in the 1933–34 season. They would spend the next three out of four years in Serie B, culminating with a fifteenth place finish in 1936–37. This meant the club would be regulated to Serie C for the following season, however financial troubles struck the club, so they returned to regional leagues instead. There, they would win a couple of regional titles before the second world war would prevent any further competition.

=== Post World War II and first national title ===
When competition resumed post World War II, the club dropped the fascist moniker, simply becoming Unione Sportiva Catanzaro for the Serie C season. They would remain in Serie C for thirteen of the following fifteen seasons, participating in only the Serie B once in 1946–47 and IV Serie once following relegation from the 1951–52 Serie C season. Catanzaro would bounce quickly back to Serie C after the 1952–53 season, which saw them not only win their interregional group, but also become national scudetto winners following the play-offs between interregional winners. The club would go on to become Serie C group winners in 1958–59 to achieve promotion back to Serie B for the first time in thirteen years.

=== Serie B consistency to Serie A promotion ===
With promotion into Serie B for the 1959–60 season, the club would enter a period of stable success, competing for twelve consecutive years there, with generally mid-table placings. This period saw the club reach the Coppa Italia final in 1966, before finally winning promotion to Serie A for the first time in 1971, after they defeated Bari in the deciding fixture of a three-way play-off which also featured Atalanta.

Catanzaro&#x27;s inaugural Serie A season saw them struggle and succumb to relegation on the final day with only 3 wins and 15 draws for 21 points. However, their first-ever Serie A win came in Round 16 with a 1–0 win over Juventus. After narrowly missing out on a return to Serie A in 1975, they bounced back in 1976 but once again lasted just one year.

A third promotion in 1978 ushered in the club&#x27;s golden era with a five-year stay in Serie A. With a team including Claudio Ranieri, Gianni Improta and the iconic Massimo Palanca, Catanzaro managed a highly credible 9th place in 1979. Though they finished 14th and would have been relegated for the following season, they won a reprieve thanks to forced relegations of AC Milan and Lazio. They managed 8th place in 1981 and 7th the following year before a dismal relegation in 1983. Much of the next four years was spent bouncing between Serie B and C1.

=== Return to Serie C and bankruptcy ===
Catanzaro initially emerged as promotion contenders once more in 1988, finishing 5th with the ageless Palanca having returned to the club after a fruitless spell at Napoli. However, they ultimately succumbed to successive relegations in 1990 and 1991, staying in Serie C2 for twelve seasons until 2003.

In 2005, after two consecutive promotions, Catanzaro returned to Serie B after a 15-year absence. However, after a poor season they ended their Serie B campaign in last place, meaning relegation to Serie C1. Catanzaro would immediately get another chance, the team being reinstated to Serie B due to vacancies related to the exclusion of other teams from Serie B. In its 2005–06 Serie B campaign, Catanzaro came last again and was relegated to Serie C1. The relegation was followed by financial troubles which led to the federation cancelling the club&#x27;s registration.

===F.C. Catanzaro (2006–2011) ===
In the summer 2006 the club was re-founded for the first time with the new name of F.C. Catanzaro and was registered to Serie C2 for the 2006–07 season, with the hope to return to the upper divisions.

In season 2010–11, they were initially relegated from Lega Pro Seconda Divisione group C to Serie D, but due to the relegation of Pomezia to last place, the club was saved from relegation.

On 18 July 2011 the club was excluded by the Federal Council from Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, but on 27 July 2011 the club won its appeal to Tnas and be permitted to play in the 2011–12 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione.

===Catanzaro Calcio 2011 / U.S. Catanzaro 1929 (2011–present) ===
On 30 June 2011 the company &quot;Catanzaro Calcio 2011&quot; acquired permanently the company branch of the bankrupt &quot;F.C. Catanzaro&quot;, following the cancellation of the previous club&#x27;s registration because of financial troubles.
On 6 August 2011, the company purchased the historical brand and logo of &quot;U.S. Catanzaro&quot;.

In the 2011–12 season, Catanzaro obtained a respectable second place in the Lega Pro Seconda Divisione and was promoted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione after playoffs. The following two seasons saw Catanzaro ending in tenth and fourth place respectively, and also a participation in the promotion play-offs (then lost to Benevento) in the latter case.

Finally in 2018, the club officially transitioned to the name Unione Sportiva Catanzaro 1929, after years of using the historical logo. The logo was also updated with the year &#x27;1929&#x27; added to highlight this change. The club would make promotion play-offs for three consecutive years, after finishing 3rd, 7th and 2nd but ultimately remain in Serie C.

In the 2021–22 season, Catanzaro again performed strongly in the league and also in the Coppa Italia Serie C. The start of the season began slowly with a number of draws interspersed with some wins. Ultimately, by 29 November 2021 Calabro was fired following a 1–1 draw with Monterosi and was replaced by Vivarini. The team had an immediate response with two wins and drew 1–1 away to Padova in the Coppa Italia Serie C semi-final. On the return leg at home, Catanzaro lost 0–1 and Padova went on to become eventual winners of the cup. Catanzaro continued to pick up points and finished the season strongly in second for a consecutive season, gaining direct entry into the quarter-final promotion playoffs. There they defeated Monopoli 3–1 on aggregate to once again find themselves matched up again Padova in the semi-finals. Unfortunately, they were unable to progress through to final as they lost 2–1 on aggregate.

In the 2022–23, Catanzaro return to Serie B for next season after defeat Gelbison 0-2 on Matchweek 33 and Champions of Serie C Group A.

==Stadium, Colours and badge==
Stadium

Catanzaro plays out of Stadio Nicola Ceravolo, which was built in 1919 and is the oldest sports facility in Calabria.

Colours

The team&#x27;s colours, since foundation, are red and yellow, just as the whole city

The most used uniform in the eighty years of history of the &quot;Aquile&quot; is the solid red one, with the yellow V collar with red shorts and socks with yellow edges.

Those pairings have accompanied the Calabrians in the golden years of the Serie A and therefore are the most dear to the Catanzaro environment. Equally used was the vertical striped yellow and red shirt with red shorts and socks with yellow edges, especially in the post-failure years of 2006.

Most rarely &quot;Catanzaro&quot; has used a shirt with yellow and red horizontal stripes. However, this uniform was used by the Calabrians in the historic match in Turin, won against Juventus, in the 1965-66 Coppa Italia, which was to launch the Catanzaro in the final, then lost against the lilies of Florence.

For the away shirt, the most used is completely blue with references to the &quot;Giallorossi&quot;, but also completely white or yellow seals were worn.

Occasionally &quot;le Aquile,&quot; have also used a third uniform which, depending on the color of the home squad, could be either blue or white or yellow. Same for the fourth currency

Badges

The corporate coat of arms consists of a shield in which stands the historic symbol of Catanzaro, the Golden eagle, faithfully taken from the city&#x27;s coat of arms, which holds a blue ribbon on its beak bearing the motto &quot;Sanguinis effusione&quot;, motivated by the losses reported in various battles by the Catanzaro fighters.

On the belly of the eagle takes place a shield that reproduces the three hills on which the city stands. A vertical line splits the emblem in two, so as to allow the insertion of the team&#x27;s social colors, which is completed by the name of the company, placed at the top on a blue background.

== Derbies and rivalries ==
Catanzaro has competed against other regional Calabrian teams throughout the professional competitions of Italian football. These derbies include:
* Cosenza – &quot;Calabria Derby (Derby della Calabria)&quot; – this is the most historic of all derbies in Calabria, with the first meeting in Serie B taking place in 1946. The history of these two sides dates all the way back to 1912 when Cosenza met one of the forerunner club&#x27;s of Catanzaro. Their first official match was in 1930 in Serie C (or the Prima Divisione as it was then known). Overall, the sides have met 54 times, with 21 Catanzaro wins, 24 draws, and 9 Cosenza wins.
* Reggina – &quot;The Classic (U-classicu)&quot; – with Catanzaro as Calabria&#x27;s capital and Reggio Calabria the region&#x27;s largest city, this match has had a special meaning to the area. The first meeting was also in the 1930–31 Prima Divisione. This contest has had the most Serie B meetings of all Calabrian derbies with 20 matches, the first of which was in 1965. It is also the only derby involving Catanzaro in which the Coppa Italia was contested (on one occasion). Out of the 62 matches, Catanzaro has won 20 times, there have been 20 draws, and Reggina has won 24 times.
* Crotone – &quot;The former Province of Catanzaro Derby (Derby dell&#x27;ex provincia di Catanzaro)&quot; – Prior to 1992, the Province of Crotone was a part of the Province of Catanzaro, which is where the name of this derby comes from. The teams however, only met for the first time in Serie B in 2004–05 season and then again in the 2005–06 season. They have spent seven seasons together in Serie C and one season in Serie C2. They have also met four times in Coppa Italia Serie C but never in the Coppa Italia. Whilst both teams have participated in Serie A, it has never been in the same season. The overall head-to-head for this meeting is Catanzaro 8 wins, 11 draws, and 9 Crotone wins from 28 games.

<text>A mill is a device, often a structure, machine or kitchen appliance, that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding, crushing, or cutting. Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes. There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them. Historically, mills were powered by hand or by animals (e.g., via a hand crank), working animal (e.g., horse mill), wind (windmill) or water (watermill). In the modern era, they are usually powered by electricity.

The grinding of solid materials occurs through mechanical forces that break up the structure by overcoming the interior bonding forces. After the grinding the state of the solid is changed: the grain size, the grain size disposition and the grain shape.

Milling also refers to the process of breaking down, separating, sizing, or classifying aggregate material (e.g. mining ore). For instance rock crushing or grinding to produce uniform aggregate size for construction purposes, or separation of rock, soil or aggregate material for the purposes of structural fill or land reclamation activities. Aggregate milling processes are also used to remove or separate contamination or moisture from aggregate or soil and to produce &quot;dry fills&quot; prior to transport or structural filling.

Grinding may serve the following purposes in engineering:
*increase of the surface area of a solid
*manufacturing of a solid with a desired grain size
*pulping of resources

==Grinding laws==
In spite of a great number of studies in the field of fracture schemes there is no formula known which connects the technical grinding work with grinding results. Mining engineers, Peter von Rittinger, Friedrich Kick and Fred Chester Bond independently produced equations to relate the needed grinding work to the grain size produced and a fourth engineer, R.T.Hukki suggested that these three equations might each describe a narrow range of grain sizes and proposed uniting them along a single curve describing what has come to be known as the &quot;Hukki relationship&quot;.

In stirred mills, the Hukki relationship does not apply and instead, experimentation has to be performed to determine any relationship.

To evaluate the grinding results the grain size disposition of the source material (1) and of the ground material (2) is needed. Grinding degree is the ratio of the sizes from the grain disposition. There are several definitions for this characteristic value:

*Grinding degree referring to grain size &quot;d&quot;80
:formula_1
:Instead of the value of &quot;d&quot;80 also &quot;d&quot;50 or other grain diameter can be used.

*Grinding degree referring to specific surface
:formula_2

:The specific surface area referring to volume &quot;S&quot;v and the specific surface area referring to mass &quot;S&quot;m can be found out through experiments.

*Pretended grinding degree
:formula_3
:The discharge die gap a of the grinding machine is used for the ground solid matter in this formula.

==Grinding machines==
In materials processing a grinder is a machine for producing fine particle size reduction through attrition and compressive forces at the grain size level. See also crusher for mechanisms producing larger particles. In general, grinding processes require a relatively large amount of energy; for this reason, an experimental method to measure the energy used locally during milling with different machines was recently proposed.

===Autogenous mill===
Autogenous or autogenic mills are so-called due to the self-grinding of the ore: a rotating drum throws larger rocks of ore in a cascading motion which causes impact breakage of larger rocks and compressive grinding of finer particles. It is similar in operation to a SAG mill as described below but does not use steel balls in the mill. Also known as ROM or &quot;Run Of Mine&quot; grinding.
===Ball mill===
A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill. A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls, usually stone or metal, which grind material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls. Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%. Ball mills are characterized by their smaller (comparatively) diameter and longer length, and often have a length 1.5 to 2.5 times the diameter. The feed is at one end of the cylinder and the discharge is at the other. Ball mills are commonly used in the manufacture of Portland cement and finer grinding stages of mineral processing. Industrial ball mills can be as large as 8.5 m (28 ft) in diameter with a 22 MW motor, drawing approximately 0.0011% of the total world&#x27;s power (see List of countries by electricity consumption). However, small versions of ball mills can be found in laboratories where they are used for grinding sample material for quality assurance.

The power predictions for ball mills typically use the following form of the Bond equation:
:formula_4
where
* &quot;E&quot; is the energy (kilowatt-hours per metric or short ton)
* &quot;W&quot; is the work index measured in a laboratory ball mill (kilowatt-hours per metric or short ton)
* &quot;P80&quot; is the mill circuit product size in micrometers
* &quot;F80&quot; is the mill circuit feed size in micrometers.

===Buhrstone mill===
Another type of fine grinder commonly used is the French buhrstone mill, which is similar to old-fashioned flour mills.

===High pressure grinding rolls===
A high pressure grinding roll, often referred to as HPGRs or roller press, consists out of two rollers with the same dimensions, which are rotating against each other with the same circumferential speed. The special feeding of bulk material through a hopper leads to a material bed between the two rollers. The bearing units of one roller can move linearly and are pressed against the material bed by springs or hydraulic cylinders. The pressures in the material bed are greater than 50 MPa (7,000 PSI). In general they achieve 100 to 300 MPa. By this the material bed is compacted to a solid volume portion of more than 80%.

The roller press has a certain similarity to roller crushers and roller presses for the compacting of powders, but purpose, construction and operation mode are different.

Extreme pressure causes the particles inside of the compacted material bed to fracture into finer particles and also causes microfracturing at the grain size level. Compared to ball mills HPGRs achieve a 30 to 50% lower specific energy consumption, although they are not as common as ball mills since they are a newer technology.

A similar type of intermediate crusher is the edge runner, which consists of a circular pan with two or more heavy wheels known as mullers rotating within it; material to be crushed is shoved underneath the wheels using attached plow blades.

===Pebble mill===
A rotating drum causes friction and attrition between rock pebbles and ore particles. May be used where product contamination by iron from steel balls must be avoided. Quartz or silica is commonly used because it is inexpensive to obtain.

===Rod mill===
A rotating drum causes friction and attrition between steel rods and ore particles. But the term &#x27;rod mill&#x27; is also used as a synonym for a slitting mill, which makes rods of iron or other metal. Rod mills are less common than ball mills for grinding minerals.

The rods used in the mill, usually a high-carbon steel, can vary in both the length and the diameter. However, the smaller the rods, the larger is the total surface area and hence, the greater the grinding efficiency.
===SAG mill===
SAG is an acronym for semi-autogenous grinding. SAG mills are autogenous mills that also use grinding balls like a ball mill. A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder. SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%. The largest SAG mill is 42&#x27; (12.8m) in diameter, powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor. A SAG mill with a 44&#x27; (13.4m) diameter and a power of 35 MW (47,000 HP) has been designed.

Attrition between grinding balls and ore particles causes grinding of finer particles. SAG mills are characterized by their large diameter and short length as compared to ball mills. The inside of the mill is lined with lifting plates to lift the material inside the mill, where it then falls off the plates onto the rest of the ore charge. SAG mills are primarily used at gold, copper and platinum mines with applications also in the lead, zinc, silver, alumina and nickel industries.

===Tower mill===

Tower mills, often called vertical mills, stirred mills or regrind mills, are a more efficient means of grinding material at smaller particle sizes, and can be used after ball mills in a grinding process. Like ball mills, grinding (steel) balls or pebbles are often added to stirred mills to help grind ore, however these mills contain a large screw mounted vertically to lift and grind material. In tower mills, there is no cascading action as in standard grinding mills. Stirred mills are also common for mixing quicklime (CaO) into a lime slurry. There are several advantages to the tower mill: low noise, efficient energy usage, and low operating costs.
===Vertical shaft impactor mill (VSI mill)===

A VSI mill throws rock or ore particles against a wear plate by slinging them from a spinning center that rotates on a vertical shaft. This type of mill uses the same principle as a VSI crusher.

==Types of grinding mills==
* Windmill, wind powered
* Watermill, water powered
* Horse mill, animal powered
* Treadwheel, human powered (archaic: &quot;treadmill&quot;)
* Ship mill, floats near a river bank or bridge
*Arrastra, simple mill for grinding and pulverizing (typically) gold or silver ore.
* Roller mill, an equipment for the grinding or pulverizing of grain and other raw materials using cylinders
* Stamp mill, a specialized machine for reducing ore to powder for further processing or for fracturing other materials
* A place of business for making articles of manufacture. The term mill was once in common use for a factory because many factories in the early stages of the Industrial Revolution were powered by a watermill, but nowadays it is only used in a few specific contexts; e.g.,
** Bark mill produces tanbark for tanneries
** Cider mill crushes apples to give cider

<text>William Henry Giles Kingston (28 February 1814 – 5 August 1880), often credited as W. H. G. Kingston, was an English writer of boys&#x27; adventure novels.

==Life==
William Henry Giles Kingston was born in Harley Street, London on 28 February 1814. He was the eldest son of Lucy Henry Kingston (d.1852) and his wife Frances Sophia Rooke (b.1789), daughter of Sir Giles Rooke, Judge of the Court of Common Pleas. Kingston&#x27;s paternal grandfather John Kingston (1736–1820) was a Member of Parliament who staunchly supported the Abolition of the Slave Trade, despite having a plantation in Demerara. His father Lucy entered into the wine business in Oporto, and Kingston lived there for many years, making frequent voyages to England and developing a lifelong affection for the sea.

He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge and afterwards entered his father&#x27;s wine business, but soon indulged in his natural bent for writing. His newspaper articles on Portugal were translated into Portuguese, and assisted the conclusion of the commercial treaty with Portugal in 1842, when he received from Donna Maria da Gloria an order of Portuguese knighthood and a pension.

His first book was &quot;The Circassian Chief&quot;, a story published in 1844. While still living in Oporto, he wrote &quot;The Prime Minister&quot;, a historical novel based loosely on the life of Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, and &quot;Lusitanian Sketches&quot;, descriptions of travels in Portugal. Settling in England, he interested himself in the emigration movement, edited &quot;The Colonist&quot; and &quot;The Colonial Magazine and East India Review&quot; in 1844, was honorary secretary of a colonisation society, wrote &quot;Some Suggestions for a System of General Emigration&quot; in 1848, lectured on colonisation in 1849, published a manual for colonists entitled &quot;How to Emigrate&quot; in 1850, and visited the western highlands on behalf of the emigration commissioners. He was afterwards a zealous volunteer and worked actively for the improvement of the condition of seamen. But from 1850, his chief occupation was writing books for boys, or editing boys&#x27; annuals and weekly periodicals. He started the &quot;Union Jack&quot;, a paper for boys, only a few months before his death. His stories number more than a hundred; the best known are:

* &quot;Peter the Whaler&quot;, 1851
* &quot;Blue Jackets&quot;, 1854
* &quot;Digby Heathcote&quot;, 1860
* &quot;The Cruise of the Frolic&quot;, 1860
* &quot;The Fireships&quot;, 1862
* &quot;The Midshipman Marmaduke Merry&quot;, 1863
* &quot;Foxholme Hall&quot;, 1867
* &quot;Ben Burton&quot;, 1872
* &quot;The Three Midshipmen&quot;, 1873
* &quot;The Three Lieutenants&quot;, 1876
* &quot;The Three Commanders&quot;, 1876
* &quot;The Three Admirals&quot;, 1878
* &quot;Kidnapping in the Pacific&quot;, 1879
* &quot;Hendriks the Hunter&quot;, 1884

He travelled widely on the ordinary routes of travel, and described his experience for the young in:

* &quot;Western Wanderings. Or, a pleasure tour in the Canadas&quot;, 1856
* &quot;My Travels in Many Lands&quot;, 1862 (France, Italy and Portugal)
* &quot;In The Eastern Seas&quot;, 1871
* &quot;The Western World&quot;, 1874
* &quot;A Yacht Voyage Round England&quot;, 1879

His popular records of adventure and of discovery included:

* &quot;Captain Cook: His Life, Voyages, and Discoveries&quot;, 1871
* &quot;Great African Travellers&quot;, 1874
* &quot;Popular History of the Navy&quot;, 1876
* &quot;Notable Voyages from Columbus to Parry&quot;, 1880
* &quot;Adventures in the Far West&quot;, 1881
* &quot;Adventures in Africa&quot;, 1883
* &quot;Adventures in India&quot;, 1884
* &quot;Adventures in Australia&quot;, 1885
* &quot;Travels of Dr. Livingstone&quot; (also known as &quot;Livingstone&#x27;s Travels&quot;), 1886
* &quot;Travels of Mungo Park, Denham and Clapperton&quot;, 1886

He published translations of several of Jules Verne&#x27;s stories from the French (see below on the actual translator), and wrote many historical tales dealing with almost all periods and countries, from &quot;Eldol the Druid&quot; (1874) and &quot;Jovinian, a tale of Early Papal Rome&quot; (1877) downwards, and undertook some popular historical compilations such as &quot;Half-Hours with the Kings and Queens of England&quot; (1876).

He rewrote Richard Johnson&#x27;s 1596 book &quot;The Seven Champions of Christendom&quot; to bring the language into more contemporary English.

His writings occupy nine pages and a half of the British Museum Catalogue. They were very popular; his tales were quite innocuous, but most of them proved ephemeral. Feeling his health failing, he wrote a farewell letter on 2 August 1880 in touching terms to the boys for whom he had written so much and so long, and died three days later at Stormont Lodge, Willesden, near London.

===Family life===

On 4 August 1853, Kingston married Agnes Kinloch, daughter of Captain Charles Kinloch of the 52nd Light Infantry who had served in the Peninsular War as aide-de-camp to General Sir John Hope. Their honeymoon was spent in Canada, where Kingston acquired the background for many of his later novels, and they spent their first Christmas at Quebec City with the family of William Collis Meredith, Chief Justice of Quebec. Agnes Kinloch was privately educated, as was the custom of the time. She sang well, was an accomplished musician, studied art and languages in Europe, and spoke both French and German fluently, a skill which was to be of benefit during her husband&#x27;s later financial troubles. She bore her husband eight children but all died early, and this branch of the family is now extinct.

Kingston&#x27;s brother George Kingston (1816–1886) was a Canadian professor, meteorologist, author, and public servant. He has been called the father of Canadian Meteorology for successfully promoting and organising one of Canada&#x27;s first national scientific services.

===Financial troubles and translations of Jules Verne===

Beginning in 1860, Kingston suffered a number of financial reverses resulting from his publishing activities and, by 1868, he was very nearly bankrupt. In fact, he was forced to accept a grant of £50 from the Royal Literary Fund and, a few months later, £100 from the Queen&#x27;s Civil List. The financial troubles continued and resulted in Kingston living as a recluse during the last ten years of his life.

Beginning in the 1870s, Kingston entered into a contract with publishers Sampson Low and Marston to translate some works of French author Jules Verne. These are the works for which Kingston is most remembered today. They were all published under his name, but the translations were actually done by his wife Agnes Kinloch Kingston. This fact was generally known in literary circles, and actually mentioned in Mrs. Kingston&#x27;s obituary in 1913, but it was apparently forgotten until it was revived in the 20th Century edition of the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; in 2004. The Verne books which Mrs. Kingston translated are:

* &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;, Sampson Low et al., 3 volumes: 1875, reprinted by Scribner, Armstrong, &amp; Co., New York, 1 volume: 1876
* &quot;Michael Strogoff&quot;, Sampson Low et al.: 1876, reprinted by Scribner, Armstrong, &amp; Co., &quot;revised by Julius Chambers&quot;: 1877
* &quot;The Child of the Cavern; or Strange Doings Underground&quot;, Sampson Low et al.: 1877
* &quot;The Begum&#x27;s Fortune; with an account of The Mutineers of the Bounty&quot;, Sampson Low et al.: 1879, reprinted by J. B. Lippincott: 1879

Kingston died at his family home at 3 Brondesbury Villas, Willesden, Middlesex on 5 August 1880, and his death was registered four days later by H. C. Kingston, &quot;present at the death&quot;. The cause of death was cited on his death certificate as &quot;Cancer of Kidney, Time not known, Certified by J. F. Anderson MD.&quot;

==Popularity==
His first book &quot;The Circassian Chief&quot; appeared in 1844. His first book for boys &quot;Peter the Whaler&quot; was published in 1851 and had such success that he retired from business and devoted himself entirely to the production of this kind of literature and, during 30 years, he wrote upwards of 130 tales, including:

*&quot;The Three Midshipmen&quot; (1862),
*&quot;The Three Lieutenants&quot; (1874),
*&quot;The Three Commanders&quot; (1875),
*&quot;The Three Admirals&quot; (1877),
*&quot;Digby Heathcote&quot;, etc.

He also wrote a tale about the notorious outlaw Ninco Nanco called &quot;Ninco Nanco, The Neapolitan Brigand&quot;, from &quot;Foxholme Hall&quot;.

He also conducted various papers, including &quot;The Colonist&quot; and &quot;Colonial Magazine and East India Review&quot;. He was also interested in emigration, volunteering, and various philanthropic schemes. He received a Portuguese knighthood for services in negotiating a commercial treaty with Portugal, and a Government pension for his literary labours.

He is mentioned by Robert Louis Stevenson in the poem prefacing &quot;Treasure Island&quot;:

::::::If studious youth no longer crave,
::::::His ancient appetites forgot,
::::::Kingston, or Ballantyne the brave,
::::::Or Cooper of the wood and wave ...

<text>Jesus (AD 30 or 33), also referred to as Jesus Christ, Jesus of Nazareth, and many other names and titles, was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader. He is the central figure of Christianity, the world&#x27;s largest religion. Most Christian denominations believe Jesus to be the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited messiah, or Christ, a descendant from the Davidic line that is prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically. Accounts of Jesus&#x27;s life are contained in the Gospels, especially the four canonical Gospels in the New Testament. Academic research has yielded various views on the historical reliability of the Gospels and how closely they reflect the historical Jesus.

Jesus was circumcised at eight days old, was baptized by John the Baptist as a young adult, and after 40 days and nights of fasting in the wilderness, began his own ministry. He was an itinerant teacher who interpreted the law of God with divine authority and was often referred to as &quot;rabbi&quot;. Jesus often debated with his fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables, and gathered followers, among whom twelve were appointed as his chosen apostles. He was arrested in Jerusalem and tried by the Jewish authorities, turned over to the Roman government, and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Judaea. After his death, his followers became convinced that he rose from the dead, and following his ascension, the community they formed eventually became the early Christian Church that expanded as a worldwide movement. It is hypothesized that accounts of his teachings and life were initially conserved by oral transmission, which was the source of the written Gospels.

Christian theology includes the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Christian Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven from where he will return. Commonly, Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead, either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of the Trinity. The birth of Jesus is celebrated annually, generally on 25 December, as Christmas. His crucifixion is honoured on Good Friday and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. The world&#x27;s most widely used calendar era—in which the current year is AD 2025 (or 2025 CE)—is based on the approximate birthdate of Jesus.

In Islam, Jesus is considered the messiah and a prophet of God, who was sent to the Israelites and will return to Earth before the Day of Judgement. Muslims believe Jesus was born of the virgin Mary but was neither God nor a son of God. Most Muslims do not believe that he was killed or crucified but that God raised him into Heaven while he was still alive. Jesus is also revered in the Baháʼí Faith, Druze and Rastafari. In contrast, Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited Messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill messianic prophecies, was not lawfully anointed and was neither divine nor resurrected.
== Name ==

A typical Jew in Jesus&#x27;s time had only one name, sometimes followed by a patronymic phrase of the form &quot;son of [father&#x27;s name]&quot;, or the individual&#x27;s hometown. Thus, in the New Testament, Jesus is commonly referred to as &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;. Jesus&#x27;s neighbours in Nazareth referred to him as &quot;the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon&quot;, &quot;the carpenter&#x27;s son&quot;, or &quot;Joseph&#x27;s son&quot;; in the Gospel of John, the disciple Philip refers to him as &quot;Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth&quot;.

The English name &quot;Jesus&quot;, from Greek , is a rendering of &quot;Joshua&quot; (Hebrew , later ), and was not uncommon in Judea at the time of the birth of Jesus. Folk etymology linked the names and to the verb meaning &#x27;save&#x27; and the noun &#x27;salvation&#x27;. The Gospel of Matthew tells of an angel that appeared to Joseph instructing him &quot;to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins&quot;.

=== Jesus Christ ===
Since the early period of Christianity, Christians have commonly referred to Jesus as &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;. The word &quot;Christ&quot; was a title or office (&quot;the Christ&quot;), not a given name. It derives from the Greek (), a translation of the Hebrew () meaning &#x27;anointed&#x27;, and is usually transliterated into English as &quot;messiah&quot;. In biblical Judaism, sacred oil was used to anoint certain exceptionally holy people and objects as part of their religious investiture.

Christians of the time designated Jesus as &quot;the Christ&quot; because they believed him to be the messiah, whose arrival is prophesied in the Hebrew Bible and Old Testament. In postbiblical usage, &quot;Christ&quot; became viewed as a name—one part of &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;. The term &quot;Christian&quot; (meaning a follower of Christ) has been in use since the 1st century.

== Life and teachings in the New Testament ==


=== Canonical gospels ===

The four canonical gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) are the foremost sources for the life and message of Jesus. But other parts of the New Testament also include references to key episodes in his life, such as the Last Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23–26. Acts of the Apostles refers to Jesus&#x27;s early ministry and its anticipation by John the Baptist. Acts 1:1–11 says more about the Ascension of Jesus than the canonical gospels do. In the undisputed Pauline letters, which were written earlier than the Gospels, Jesus&#x27;s words or instructions are cited several times.

Some early Christian groups had separate descriptions of Jesus&#x27;s life and teachings that are not in the New Testament. These include the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter, and Gospel of Judas, the Apocryphon of James, and many other apocryphal writings. Most scholars conclude that these were written much later and are less reliable accounts than the canonical gospels.

==== Authorship, date, and reliability ====
The canonical gospels are four accounts, each by a different author. The authors of the Gospels are pseudonymous, attributed by tradition to the four evangelists, each with close ties to Jesus: Mark by John Mark, an associate of Peter; Matthew by one of Jesus&#x27;s disciples; Luke by a companion of Paul mentioned in a few epistles; and John by another of Jesus&#x27;s disciples, the &quot;beloved disciple&quot;.

According to the Marcan priority, the first to be written was the Gospel of Mark (written AD 60–75), followed by the Gospel of Matthew (AD 65–85), the Gospel of Luke (AD 65–95), and the Gospel of John (AD 75–100). Most scholars agree that the authors of Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source for their gospels. Since Matthew and Luke also share some content not found in Mark, many scholars assume that they used another source (commonly called the &quot;Q source&quot;) in addition to Mark.

One important aspect of the study of the Gospels is the literary genre under which they fall. Genre &quot;is a key convention guiding both the composition and the interpretation of writings&quot;. Whether the gospel authors set out to write novels, myths, histories, or biographies has a tremendous impact on how they ought to be interpreted. Some recent studies suggest that the genre of the Gospels ought to be situated within the realm of ancient biography. Although not without critics, the position that the Gospels are a type of ancient biography is the consensus among scholars today.

Concerning the accuracy of the accounts, viewpoints run the gamut from considering them inerrant descriptions of Jesus&#x27;s life, to doubting whether they are historically reliable on a number of points, to considering them to provide very little historical information about his life beyond the basics. According to a broad scholarly consensus, the Synoptic Gospels (the first three—Matthew, Mark, and Luke) are the most reliable sources of information about Jesus.

==== Comparative structure and content ====

Matthew, Mark, and Luke are known as the Synoptic Gospels, from the Greek (, &#x27;together&#x27;) and (, &#x27;view&#x27;), because they are similar in content, narrative arrangement, language and paragraph structure, and one can easily set them next to each other and synoptically compare what is in them. Scholars generally agree that it is impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John. While the flow of many events (e.g., Jesus&#x27;s baptism, transfiguration, crucifixion and interactions with his apostles) are shared among the Synoptic Gospels, incidents such as the transfiguration and Jesus&#x27;s exorcising demons do not appear in John, which also differs on other matters, such as the Cleansing of the Temple.

The Synoptics emphasize different aspects of Jesus. In Mark, Jesus is the Son of God whose mighty works demonstrate the presence of God&#x27;s Kingdom. He is a tireless wonder worker, the servant of both God and man. This short gospel records a few of Jesus&#x27;s words or teachings. The Gospel of Matthew emphasizes that Jesus is the fulfilment of God&#x27;s will as revealed in the Old Testament, and the Lord of the Church. He is the &quot;Son of David&quot;, a &quot;king&quot;, and the Messiah. Luke presents Jesus as the divine-human saviour who shows compassion to the needy. He is the friend of sinners and outcasts, who came to seek and save the lost. This gospel includes well-known parables, such as the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son.

The prologue to the Gospel of John identifies Jesus as an incarnation of the divine Word (Logos). As the Word, Jesus was eternally present with God, active in all creation, and the source of humanity&#x27;s moral and spiritual nature. Jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God&#x27;s Word; he is God&#x27;s Word. In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine, and more.

The authors of the New Testament generally showed little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in , the Gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in Jesus&#x27;s life. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of Jesus&#x27;s life in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. The Gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, but it is possible to draw from them a general picture of Jesus&#x27;s life story.

=== Genealogy and nativity ===

Jesus was Jewish, born to Mary, wife of Joseph. The Gospels of Matthew and Luke offer two accounts of his genealogy. Matthew traces Jesus&#x27;s ancestry to Abraham through David. Luke traces Jesus&#x27;s ancestry through Adam to God. The lists are identical between Abraham and David but differ radically from that point. Matthew has 27 generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has 42, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists. Various theories have been put forward to explain why the two genealogies are so different.
Both Matthew and Luke describe Jesus&#x27;s birth, especially that Jesus was born to a virgin named Mary in Bethlehem in fulfilment of prophecy. Luke&#x27;s account emphasizes events before the birth of Jesus and centers on Mary, while Matthew&#x27;s mostly covers those after the birth and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state that Mary, was engaged to a man named Joseph, who was descended from King David and was not his biological father, and both support the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus, according to which Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary&#x27;s womb when she was still a virgin. At the same time, there is evidence, at least in the Lukan Acts of the Apostles, that Jesus was thought to have had, like many figures in antiquity, a dual paternity, since there it is stated he descended from the seed or loins of David. By taking him as his own, Joseph will give him the necessary Davidic descent. Some scholars suggest that Jesus had Levite heritage from Mary, based on her blood relationship with Elizabeth.
In Matthew, Joseph is troubled because Mary, his betrothed, is pregnant, but in the first of Joseph&#x27;s four dreams an angel assures him not to be afraid to take Mary as his wife because her child was conceived by the Holy Spirit. In Matthew 2:1–12, wise men or Magi from the East bring gifts to the young Jesus as the King of the Jews. They find him in a house in Bethlehem. Herod the Great hears of Jesus&#x27;s birth and, wanting him killed, orders the murders of male infants in Bethlehem and its surroundings. But an angel warns Joseph in his second dream, and the family flees to Egypt—later to return and settle in Nazareth.

In Luke 1:31–38, Mary learns from the angel Gabriel that she will conceive and bear a child called Jesus through the action of the Holy Spirit. When Mary is due to give birth, she and Joseph travel from Nazareth to Joseph&#x27;s ancestral home in Bethlehem to register in the census ordered by Caesar Augustus. While there Mary gives birth to Jesus, and as they have found no room in the inn, she places the newborn in a manger. An angel announces the birth to a group of shepherds, who go to Bethlehem to see Jesus, and subsequently spread the news abroad. Luke 2:21 tells how Joseph and Mary have their baby circumcised on the eighth day after birth, and name him Jesus, as Gabriel had commanded Mary. After the presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Joseph, Mary and Jesus return to Nazareth.

=== Early life, family, and profession ===


Jesus&#x27;s childhood home is identified in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew as Nazareth, a town in Galilee in present-day Israel, where he lived with his family. Although Joseph appears in descriptions of Jesus&#x27;s childhood, no mention is made of him thereafter. His other family members, including his mother, Mary, his four brothers James, Joses (or Joseph), Judas, and Simon, and his unnamed sisters, are mentioned in the Gospels and other sources. Jesus&#x27;s maternal grandparents are named Joachim and Anne in the Gospel of James. The Gospel of Luke records that Mary was a relative of Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist. Extra-biblical contemporary sources consider Jesus and John the Baptist to be second cousins through the belief that Elizabeth was the daughter of Sobe, the sister of Anne.

The Gospel of Mark reports that at the beginning of his ministry, Jesus comes into conflict with his neighbours and family. Jesus&#x27;s mother and brothers come to get him because people are saying that he is mentally ill. Jesus responds that his followers are his true family. In the Gospel of John, Jesus and his mother attend a wedding at Cana, where he performs his first miracle at her request. Later, she follows him to his crucifixion, and he expresses concern over her well-being.

Jesus is called a () in , a term traditionally understood as carpenter but could also refer to makers of objects in various materials, including builders. The Gospels indicate that Jesus could read, paraphrase, and debate scripture, but this does not necessarily mean that he received formal scribal training.

The Gospel of Luke reports two journeys of Jesus and his parents in Jerusalem during his childhood. They come to the Temple in Jerusalem for the presentation of Jesus as a baby in accordance with Jewish Law, where a man named Simeon prophesies about Jesus and Mary. When Jesus, at the age of twelve, goes missing on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem for Passover, his parents find him in the temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking questions, and the people are amazed at his understanding and answers. Mary scolds Jesus for going missing, to which Jesus replies that he must &quot;be in his father&#x27;s house&quot;.

The synoptic gospels describe Jesus&#x27;s baptism in the Jordan River and the temptations he suffered while spending forty days in the Judaean Desert, as a preparation for his public ministry. The accounts of Jesus&#x27;s baptism are all preceded by information about John the Baptist. They show John preaching penance and repentance for the remission of sins and encouraging the giving of alms to the poor as he baptizes people in the area of the Jordan River around Perea and foretells the arrival of someone &quot;more powerful&quot; than he.
In the Gospel of Mark, John the Baptist baptizes Jesus, and as he comes out of the water he sees the Holy Spirit descending to him like a dove and a voice comes from heaven declaring him to be God&#x27;s Son. This is one of two events described in the Gospels where a voice from Heaven calls Jesus &quot;Son&quot;, the other being the Transfiguration. The spirit then drives him into the wilderness where he is tempted by Satan. Jesus then begins his ministry in Galilee after John&#x27;s arrest.

In the Gospel of Matthew, as Jesus comes to him to be baptized, John protests, saying, &quot;I need to be baptized by you.&quot; Jesus instructs him to carry on with the baptism &quot;to fulfill all righteousness&quot;. Matthew details three temptations that Satan offers Jesus in the wilderness.

In the Gospel of Luke, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove after everyone has been baptized and Jesus is praying. Later John implicitly recognizes Jesus after sending his followers to ask about him. Luke also describes three temptations received by Jesus in the wilderness, before starting his ministry in Galilee.

The Gospel of John leaves out Jesus&#x27;s baptism and temptation. Here, John the Baptist testifies that he saw the Spirit descend on Jesus. John publicly proclaims Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb of God, and some of John&#x27;s followers become disciples of Jesus. Before John is imprisoned, Jesus leads his followers to baptize disciples as well, and they baptize more people than John.

=== Public ministry ===


The Synoptics depict two distinct geographical settings in Jesus&#x27;s ministry. The first takes place north of Judea, in Galilee, where Jesus conducts a successful ministry, and the second shows Jesus rejected and killed when he travels to Jerusalem. Often referred to as &quot;rabbi&quot;, Jesus preaches his message orally. Notably, Jesus forbids those who recognize him as the messiah to speak of it, including people he heals and demons he exorcises (see Messianic Secret).

John depicts Jesus&#x27;s ministry as largely taking place in and around Jerusalem, rather than in Galilee; and Jesus&#x27;s divine identity is openly proclaimed and immediately recognized.

Scholars divide the ministry of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of Satan. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in , his first disciples, who will eventually form the core of the early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him. This period includes the Sermon on the Mount, one of Jesus&#x27;s major discourses, as well as the calming of the storm, the feeding of the 5,000, walking on water and a number of other miracles and parables. It ends with the Confession of Peter and the Transfiguration.

As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem, in the Perean ministry, he returns to the area where he was baptized, about a third of the way down from the Sea of Galilee along the Jordan River. The final ministry in Jerusalem begins with Jesus&#x27;s triumphal entry into the city on Palm Sunday. In the Synoptic Gospels, during that week Jesus drives the money changers from the Second Temple and Judas bargains to betray him. This period culminates in the Last Supper and the Farewell Discourse.

==== Disciples and followers ====

Near the beginning of his ministry, Jesus appoints twelve apostles. In Matthew and Mark, despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, Jesus&#x27;s first four apostles, who were fishermen, are described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets and boats to do so. In John, Jesus&#x27;s first two apostles were disciples of John the Baptist. The Baptist sees Jesus and calls him the Lamb of God; the two hear this and follow Jesus. In addition to the Twelve Apostles, the opening of the passage of the Sermon on the Plain identifies a much larger group of people as disciples. Also, in Jesus sends 70 or 72 of his followers in pairs to prepare towns for his prospective visit. They are instructed to accept hospitality, heal the sick, and spread the word that the Kingdom of God is coming.

In Mark, the disciples are notably obtuse. They fail to understand Jesus&#x27;s miracles, his parables, or what &quot;rising from the dead&quot; means. When Jesus is later arrested, they desert him.

==== Teachings and miracles ====


In the Synoptics, Jesus teaches extensively, often in parables, about the Kingdom of God (or, in Matthew, the Kingdom of Heaven). The Kingdom is described as both imminent and already present in the ministry of Jesus. Jesus promises inclusion in the Kingdom for those who accept his message. He talks of the &quot;Son of man&quot;, an apocalyptic figure who will come to gather the chosen.

Jesus calls people to repent their sins and to devote themselves completely to God. He tells his followers to adhere to Jewish law, although he is perceived by some to have broken the law himself, for example regarding the Sabbath. When asked what the greatest commandment is, Jesus replies: &quot;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind ... And a second is like it: &#x27;You shall love your neighbor as yourself. Other ethical teachings of Jesus include loving your enemies, refraining from hatred and lust, turning the other cheek, and forgiving people who have sinned against you.

John&#x27;s Gospel presents the teachings of Jesus not merely as his own preaching, but as divine revelation. John the Baptist, for example, states in : &quot;He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure.&quot; In Jesus says, &quot;My teaching is not mine but his who sent me.&quot; He asserts the same thing in : &quot;Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.&quot;
Approximately 30 parables form about one-third of Jesus&#x27;s recorded teachings. The parables appear within longer sermons and at other places in the narrative. They often contain symbolism, and usually relate the physical world to the spiritual. Common themes in these tales include the kindness and generosity of God and the perils of transgression. Some of his parables, such as the Prodigal Son, are relatively simple, while others, such as the Growing Seed, are sophisticated, profound and abstruse. When asked by his disciples why he speaks in parables to the people, Jesus replies that the chosen disciples have been given to &quot;know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven&quot;, unlike the rest of their people, &quot;For the one who has will be given more and he will have in abundance. But the one who does not have will be deprived even more&quot;, going on to say that the majority of their generation have grown &quot;dull hearts&quot; and thus are unable to understand.
In the gospel accounts, Jesus devotes a large portion of his ministry to performing miracles, especially healings. The miracles can be classified into two main categories: healing miracles and nature miracles. The healing miracles include cures for physical ailments, exorcisms, and resurrections of the dead. The nature miracles show Jesus&#x27;s power over nature, and include turning water into wine, walking on water, and calming a storm, among others. Jesus states that his miracles are from a divine source. When his opponents suddenly accuse him of performing exorcisms by the power of Beelzebub, the prince of demons, Jesus counters that he performs them by the &quot;Spirit of God&quot; () or &quot;finger of God&quot;, arguing that all logic suggests that Satan would not let his demons assist the Children of God because it would divide Satan&#x27;s house and bring his kingdom to desolation; furthermore, he asks his opponents that if he exorcises by Beelzebub, &quot;by whom do your sons cast them out?&quot;. In , he goes on to say that while all manner of sin, &quot;even insults against God&quot; or &quot;insults against the son of man&quot;, shall be forgiven, whoever insults goodness (or &quot;The Holy Spirit&quot;) shall never be forgiven; they carry the guilt of their sin forever.

In John, Jesus&#x27;s miracles are described as &quot;signs&quot;, performed to prove his mission and divinity. In the Synoptics, when asked by some teachers of the Law and some Pharisees to give miraculous signs to prove his authority, Jesus refuses, saying that no sign shall come to corrupt and evil people except the sign of the prophet Jonah. Also, in the Synoptic Gospels, the crowds regularly respond to Jesus&#x27;s miracles with awe and press on him to heal their sick. In John&#x27;s Gospel, Jesus is presented as unpressured by the crowds, who often respond to his miracles with trust and faith. One characteristic shared among all miracles of Jesus in the gospel accounts is that he performed them freely and never requested or accepted any form of payment. The gospel episodes that include descriptions of the miracles of Jesus also often include teachings, and the miracles themselves involve an element of teaching. Many of the miracles teach the importance of faith. In the cleansing of ten lepers and the raising of Jairus&#x27;s daughter, for instance, the beneficiaries are told that their healing was due to their faith.

==== Proclamation as Christ and Transfiguration ====

At about the middle of each of the three Synoptic Gospels are two significant events: the Confession of Peter and the Transfiguration of Jesus. These two events are not mentioned in the Gospel of John.

In his Confession, Peter tells Jesus, &quot;You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.&quot; Jesus affirms that Peter&#x27;s confession is divinely revealed truth. After the confession, Jesus tells his disciples about his upcoming death and resurrection.

In the Transfiguration, Jesus takes Peter and two other apostles up an unnamed mountain, where &quot;he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white&quot;. A bright cloud appears around them, and a voice from the cloud says, &quot;This is my Son, the Beloved; with him I am well pleased; listen to him.&quot;

=== Passion Week ===
The description of the last week of the life of Jesus (often called Passion Week) occupies about one-third of the narrative in the canonical gospels, starting with Jesus&#x27;s triumphal entry into Jerusalem and ending with his Crucifixion.

==== Activities in Jerusalem ====

In the Synoptics, the last week in Jerusalem is the conclusion of the journey through Perea and Judea that Jesus began in Galilee. Jesus rides a young donkey into Jerusalem, reflecting the tale of the Messiah&#x27;s Donkey, an oracle from the Book of Zechariah in which the Jews&#x27; humble king enters Jerusalem this way. People along the way lay cloaks and small branches of trees (known as palm fronds) in front of him and sing part of Psalms 118:25–26.

Jesus next expels the money changers from the Second Temple, accusing them of turning it into a den of thieves through their commercial activities. He then prophesies about the coming destruction, including false prophets, wars, earthquakes, celestial disorders, persecution of the faithful, the appearance of an &quot;abomination of desolation&quot;, and unendurable tribulations. The mysterious &quot;Son of Man&quot;, he says, will dispatch angels to gather the faithful from all parts of the earth. Jesus warns that these wonders will occur in the lifetimes of the hearers. In John, the Cleansing of the Temple occurs at the beginning of Jesus&#x27;s ministry instead of at the end.

Jesus comes into conflict with the Jewish elders, such as when they question his authority and when he criticizes them and calls them hypocrites. Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve apostles, secretly strikes a bargain with the Jewish elders, agreeing to betray Jesus to them for 30 silver coins.

The Gospel of John recounts two other feasts in which Jesus taught in Jerusalem before the Passion Week. In Bethany, a village near Jerusalem, Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. This potent sign increases the tension with authorities, who conspire to kill him. Mary of Bethany anoints Jesus&#x27;s feet, foreshadowing his entombment. Jesus then makes his messianic entry into Jerusalem. The cheering crowds greeting Jesus as he enters Jerusalem add to the animosity between him and the establishment. In John, Jesus has already cleansed the Second Temple during an earlier Passover visit to Jerusalem. John next recounts Jesus&#x27;s Last Supper with his disciples.

==== Last Supper ====


The Last Supper is the final meal that Jesus shared with his twelve apostles in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. The Last Supper is mentioned in all four canonical gospels; Paul&#x27;s First Epistle to the Corinthians also refers to it. During the meal, Jesus predicts that one of his apostles will betray him. Despite each Apostle&#x27;s assertion that he would not betray him, Jesus reiterates that the betrayer would be one of those present. Matthew 26:23–25 and John 13:26–27 specifically identify Judas as the traitor.

In the Synoptics, Jesus takes bread, breaks it, and gives it to the disciples, saying, &quot;This is my body, which is given for you.&quot; He then has them all drink from a cup, saying, &quot;This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.&quot; The Christian sacrament or ordinance of the Eucharist is based on these events. Although the Gospel of John does not include a description of the bread-and-wine ritual during the Last Supper, most scholars agree that John 6:22–59 (the Bread of Life Discourse) has a eucharistic character and resonates with the institution narratives in the Synoptic Gospels and in the Pauline writings on the Last Supper.

In all four gospels, Jesus predicts that Peter will deny knowledge of him three times before the rooster crows the next morning. In Luke and John, the prediction is made during the Supper. In Matthew and Mark, the prediction is made after the Supper; Jesus also predicts that all his disciples will desert him. The Gospel of John provides the only account of Jesus washing his disciples&#x27; feet after the meal. John also includes a long sermon by Jesus, preparing his disciples (now without Judas) for his departure. Chapters 14–17 of the Gospel of John are known as the Farewell Discourse and are a significant source of Christological content.

==== Agony in the Garden, betrayal, and arrest ====

In the Synoptics, Jesus and his disciples go to the garden Gethsemane, where Jesus prays to be spared his coming ordeal. Then Judas comes with an armed mob, sent by the chief priests, scribes and elders. He kisses Jesus to identify him to the crowd, which then arrests Jesus. In an attempt to stop them, an unnamed disciple of Jesus uses a sword to cut off the ear of a man in the crowd. After Jesus&#x27;s arrest, his disciples go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice denies knowing Jesus. After the third denial, Peter hears the rooster crow and recalls Jesus&#x27;s prediction about his denial. Peter then weeps bitterly.

In John 18:1–11, Jesus does not pray to be spared his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as scarcely touched by such human weakness. The people who arrest him are Roman soldiers and Temple guards. Instead of being betrayed by a kiss, Jesus proclaims his identity, and when he does, the soldiers and officers fall to the ground. The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, and Jesus rebukes him for it.

==== Trials by the Sanhedrin, Herod, and Pilate ====
After his arrest, Jesus is taken late at night to the private residence of the high priest, Caiaphas, who had been installed by Pilate&#x27;s predecessor, the Roman procurator Valerius Gratus. The Sanhedrin was a Jewish judicial body. The gospel accounts differ on the details of the trials. In Matthew 26:57, Mark 14:53, and Luke 22:54, Jesus is taken to the house of the high priest, Caiaphas, where he is mocked and beaten that night. Early the next morning, the chief priests and scribes lead Jesus away into their council. John 18:12–14 states that Jesus is first taken to Annas, Caiaphas&#x27;s father-in-law, and then to the high priest.
During the trials Jesus speaks very little, mounts no defence, and gives very infrequent and indirect answers to the priests&#x27; questions, prompting an officer to slap him. In Matthew 26:62, Jesus&#x27;s unresponsiveness leads Caiaphas to ask him, &quot;Have you no answer?&quot;. In Mark 14:61, the high priest then asks Jesus, &quot;Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?&quot;. Jesus replies, &quot;I am&quot;, and then predicts the coming of the Son of Man. This provokes Caiaphas to tear his own robe in anger and to accuse Jesus of blasphemy. In Matthew and Luke, Jesus&#x27;s answer is more ambiguous: in Matthew 26:64, he responds, &quot;You have said so&quot;, and in Luke 22:70 he says, &quot;You say that I am.&quot;

The Jewish elders take Jesus to Pilate&#x27;s Court and ask the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, to judge and condemn Jesus for various allegations: subverting the nation, opposing the payment of tribute, claiming to be Christ, a king, and claiming to be the son of God. The use of the word &quot;king&quot; is central to the discussion between Jesus and Pilate. In John 18:36, Jesus states, &quot;My kingdom is not from this world&quot;, but he does not unequivocally deny being the King of the Jews. In Luke 23:7–15, Pilate realizes that Jesus is a Galilean, and thus comes under the jurisdiction of Herod Antipas, the Tetrarch of Galilee and Perea. Pilate sends Jesus to Herod to be tried, but Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod&#x27;s questions. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put an expensive robe on him to make him look like a king, and return him to Pilate, who then calls together the Jewish elders and announces that he has &quot;not found this man guilty&quot;.

Observing a Passover custom of the time, Pilate allows one prisoner chosen by the crowd to be released. He gives the people a choice between Jesus and a murderer called Barabbas ( or &quot;Bar-abbâ&quot;, &quot;son of the father&quot;, from the common given name &quot;Abba&quot;: &#x27;father&#x27;). Persuaded by the elders, the mob chooses to release Barabbas and crucify Jesus. Pilate writes a sign in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek that reads &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews&quot; (abbreviated as INRI in depictions) to be affixed to Jesus&#x27;s cross, then scourges Jesus and sends him to be crucified. The soldiers place a crown of thorns on Jesus&#x27;s head and ridicule him as the King of the Jews. They beat and taunt him before taking him to Calvary, also called Golgotha, for crucifixion.

==== Crucifixion and entombment ====


Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels. After the trials, Jesus is led to Calvary carrying his cross; the route traditionally thought to have been taken is known as the Via Dolorosa. The three Synoptic Gospels indicate that Simon of Cyrene assists him, having been compelled by the Romans to do so. In Luke 23:27–28, Jesus tells the women in the multitude of people following him not to weep for him but for themselves and their children. At Calvary, Jesus is offered a sponge soaked in a concoction usually offered as a painkiller. According to Matthew and Mark, he refuses it.

The soldiers then crucify Jesus and cast lots for his clothes. Above Jesus&#x27;s head on the cross is Pilate&#x27;s inscription, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.&quot; Soldiers and passersby mock him about it. Two convicted thieves are crucified along with Jesus. In Matthew and Mark, both thieves mock Jesus. In Luke, one of them rebukes Jesus, while the other defends him. Jesus tells the latter: &quot;today you will be with me in Paradise.&quot; The four gospels mention the presence of a group of female disciples of Jesus at the crucifixion. In John, Jesus sees his mother Mary and the beloved disciple and tells him to take care of her.

In John 19:33–34, Roman soldiers break the two thieves&#x27; legs to hasten their death, but not those of Jesus, as he is already dead. Instead, one soldier pierces Jesus&#x27;s side with a lance, and blood and water flow out. The Synoptics report a period of darkness, and the heavy curtain in the Temple is torn when Jesus dies. In Matthew 27:51–54, an earthquake breaks open tombs. In Matthew and Mark, terrified by the events, a Roman centurion states that Jesus was the Son of God.

On the same day, Joseph of Arimathea, with Pilate&#x27;s permission and with Nicodemus&#x27;s help, removes Jesus&#x27;s body from the cross, wraps him in a clean cloth, and buries him in his new rock-hewn tomb. In Matthew 27:62–66, on the following day the chief Jewish priests ask Pilate for the tomb to be secured, and with Pilate&#x27;s permission the priests place seals on the large stone covering the entrance.

=== Resurrection and ascension ===

The Gospels do not describe the moment of the resurrection of Jesus. They describe the discovery of his empty tomb and several appearances of Jesus, with distinct differences in each narrative.

In the four Gospels, Mary Magdalene goes to the tomb on Sunday morning, alone or with one or several other women. The tomb is empty, with the stone rolled away, and there are one or two angels, depending on the accounts. In the Synoptics, the women are told that Jesus is not here and that he is risen. In Mark and Matthew, the angel also instructs them to tell the disciples to meet Jesus in Galilee. In Luke, Peter visits the tomb after he is told it is empty. In John, he goes there with the beloved disciple. Matthew mentions Roman guards at the tomb, who report to the priests of Jerusalem what happened. The priests bribe them to say that the disciples stole Jesus&#x27;s body during the night.

The four Gospels then describe various appearances of Jesus in his resurrected body. Jesus first reveals himself to Mary Magdalene in Mark 16:9 and John 20:14–17, along with &quot;the other Mary&quot; in Matthew 28:9, while in Luke the first reported appearance is to two disciples heading to Emmaus. Jesus then reveals himself to the eleven disciples, in Jerusalem or in Galilee. In Luke 24:36–43, he eats and shows them his tangible wounds to prove that he is not a spirit. He also shows them to Thomas to end his doubts, in John 20:24–29. In the Synoptics, Jesus commissions the disciples to spread the gospel message to all nations, while in John 21, he tells Peter to take care of his sheep.

Jesus&#x27;s ascension into Heaven is described in Luke 24:50–53, Acts 1:1–11, and mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:16. In the Acts of the Apostles, forty days after the Resurrection, as the disciples look on, &quot;he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight&quot;. 1 Peter 3:22 states that Jesus has &quot;gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God&quot;.

The Acts of the Apostles describes several appearances of Jesus after his Ascension. In Acts 7:55, Stephen gazes into heaven and sees &quot;Jesus standing at the right hand of God&quot; just before his death. On the road to Damascus, the Apostle Paul is converted to Christianity after seeing a blinding light and hearing a voice saying, &quot;I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.&quot; In Acts 9:10–18, Jesus instructs Ananias of Damascus in a vision to heal Paul. The Book of Revelation includes a revelation from Jesus concerning the last days of Earth.
== Early Christianity ==

After Jesus&#x27;s life, his followers, as described in the first chapters of the Acts of the Apostles, were all Jews either by birth or conversion, for which the biblical term &quot;proselyte&quot; is used, and referred to by historians as Jewish Christians. The early Gospel message was spread orally, probably in Aramaic, but almost immediately also in Greek. The New Testament&#x27;s Acts of the Apostles and Epistle to the Galatians record that the first Christian community was centered in Jerusalem and its leaders included Peter, James, the brother of Jesus, and John the Apostle.

After his conversion, Paul the Apostle spread the teachings of Jesus to various non-Jewish communities throughout the eastern Mediterranean region. Paul&#x27;s influence on Christian thinking is said to be more significant than that of any other New Testament author. By the end of the 1st century, Christianity began to be recognized internally and externally as a separate religion from Judaism which itself was refined and developed further in the centuries after the destruction of the Second Temple.

Numerous quotations in the New Testament and other Christian writings of the first centuries indicate that early Christians generally used and revered the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) as religious text, mostly in the Greek (Septuagint) or Aramaic (Targum) translations.

Early Christians wrote many religious works, including the ones included in the canon of the New Testament. The canonical texts, which have become the main sources used by historians to try to understand the historical Jesus and sacred texts within Christianity, were probably written between 50 and 120 AD.

== Historical views ==
Prior to the Enlightenment, the Gospels were usually regarded as accurate historical accounts, but since then scholars have emerged who question the reliability of the Gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the Gospels and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus, and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of Jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.

Approaches to the historical reconstruction of the life of Jesus have varied from the &quot;maximalist&quot; approaches of the 19th century, in which the gospel accounts were accepted as reliable evidence wherever it is possible, to the &quot;minimalist&quot; approaches of the early 20th century, where hardly anything about Jesus was accepted as historical. In the 1950s, as the second quest for the historical Jesus gathered pace, the minimalist approaches faded away, and in the 21st century, minimalists such as Price are a small minority. Although a belief in the inerrancy of the Gospels cannot be supported historically, many scholars since the 1980s have held that, beyond the few facts considered to be historically certain, certain other elements of Jesus&#x27;s life are &quot;historically probable&quot;. Modern scholarly research on the historical Jesus thus focuses on identifying the most probable elements.

=== Judea and Galilee in the 1st century ===

In AD 6, Judea, Idumea, and Samaria were transformed from a Herodian client state of the Roman Empire into an imperial province, also called Judea. A Roman prefect, rather than a client ruler, governed the land. The prefect governed from Caesarea Maritima, leaving Jerusalem to be run by the High Priest of Israel. As an exception, the prefect came to Jerusalem during religious festivals, when religious and patriotic enthusiasm sometimes inspired unrest or uprisings. Galilee with Perea was a Herodian client state under the rule of Herod Antipas since 4 BC. Galilee was evidently prosperous, and poverty was limited enough that it did not threaten the social order.
Philip (d. 34 AD), half-brother of Herod Antipas, ruled as Tetrarch yet another Herodian client state to the north and east of the sea of Galilee that included Gaulanitis, Batanea, and Iturea though this was mostly non-Jewish. South of this on the east bank of the Jordan was the Decapolis; a collection of Hellenistic city-states that were at this time clients of the Roman empire. North of Galilee were the cities of Tyre and Sidon which were in the Roman province of Syria. Though non-Jewish lands surrounded the mostly Jewish territories of Judea and Galilee, Roman law and practice allowed Jews to remain separate legally and culturally.

This was the era of Hellenistic Judaism, which combined Jewish religious tradition with elements of Hellenistic culture. Until the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Muslim conquests of the Eastern Mediterranean, the main centers of Hellenistic Judaism were Alexandria (Egypt) and Antioch (now Southern Turkey), the two main Greek colonies of the Middle East and North Africa area, both founded at the end of the 4th century BC in the wake of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Hellenistic Judaism also existed in Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period, where there was conflict between Hellenizers and traditionalists (sometimes called Judaizers). The Hebrew Bible was translated from Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic into Jewish Koine Greek; the Targum translations into Aramaic were also generated during this era, both due to the decline of knowledge of Hebrew.

Jews based their faith and religious practice on the Torah, five books said to have been given by God to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented only a small fraction of the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time when God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.

=== Sources ===


New Testament scholars face a formidable challenge when they analyse the canonical Gospels. The Gospels are not biographies in the modern sense, and the authors explain Jesus&#x27;s theological significance and recount his public ministry while omitting many details of his life.

The reports of supernatural events associated with Jesus&#x27;s death and resurrection make the challenge even more difficult. Scholars regard the Gospels as compromised sources of information because the writers were trying to glorify Jesus. Ed Sanders states that the sources for Jesus&#x27;s life are better than sources scholars have for the life of Alexander the Great.

Scholars use a number of criteria, such as the criterion of independent attestation, the criterion of coherence, and the criterion of discontinuity to judge the historicity of events. The historicity of an event also depends on the reliability of the source; indeed, the Gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus&#x27;s life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.

Some scholars (most notably the Jesus Seminar) believe that the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas might be an independent witness to many of Jesus&#x27;s parables and aphorisms. For example, Thomas confirms that Jesus blessed the poor and that this saying circulated independently before being combined with similar sayings in the Q source. However, the majority of scholars are sceptical about this text and believe it should be dated to the 2nd century AD.

Other select non-canonical Christian texts may also have value for historical Jesus research.

Early non-Christian sources that attest to the historical existence of Jesus include the works of the historians Josephus and Tacitus. Josephus scholar Louis Feldman has stated that &quot;few have doubted the genuineness&quot; of Josephus&#x27;s reference to Jesus in of the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, and it is disputed only by a small number of scholars. Tacitus referred to Christ and his execution by Pilate in of his work &quot;Annals&quot;. Scholars generally consider Tacitus&#x27;s reference to the execution of Jesus to be both authentic and of historical value as an independent Roman source.

Non-Christian sources are valuable in two ways. First, they show that even neutral or hostile parties never show any doubt that Jesus actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: that Jesus was a teacher, had a reputation as a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.

Archaeology helps scholars better understand Jesus&#x27;s social world. Recent archaeological work, for example, indicates that Capernaum, a city important in Jesus&#x27;s ministry, was poor and small, without even a forum or an agora. This archaeological discovery resonates well with the scholarly view that Jesus advocated reciprocal sharing among the destitute in that area of Galilee.

=== Chronology ===

Jesus was a Galilean Jew, born around the beginning of the 1st century, who died in AD 30 or 33 in Judea. The general scholarly consensus is that Jesus was a contemporary of John the Baptist and was crucified as ordered by the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, who held office from AD 26 to 36.

The Gospels offer several indications concerning the year of Jesus&#x27;s birth. Matthew 2:1 associates the birth of Jesus with the reign of Herod the Great, who died around 4 BC, and Luke 1:5 mentions that Herod was on the throne shortly before the birth of Jesus, although this gospel also associates the birth with the Census of Quirinius which took place ten years later. Luke 3:23 states that Jesus was &quot;about thirty years old&quot; at the start of his ministry, which according to Acts 10:37–38 was preceded by John the Baptist&#x27;s ministry, which was recorded in Luke 3:1–2 to have begun in the 15th year of Tiberius&#x27;s reign (AD 28 or 29). By collating the gospel accounts with historical data and using various other methods, most scholars arrive at a date of birth for Jesus between 6 and 4 BC, but some propose estimates that include a wider range.

The date range for Jesus&#x27;s ministry has been estimated using several different approaches. One of these applies the reference in Luke 3:1–2, Acts 10:37–38, and the dates of Tiberius&#x27;s reign, which are well known, to give a date of around 28–29 AD for the start of Jesus&#x27;s ministry. Another approach estimates a date around 27–29 AD by using the statement about the temple in John 2:13–20, which asserts that the temple in Jerusalem was in its 46th year of construction at the start of Jesus&#x27;s ministry, together with Josephus&#x27;s statement that the temple&#x27;s reconstruction was started by Herod the Great in the 18th year of his reign. A further method uses the date of the death of John the Baptist and the marriage of Herod Antipas to Herodias, based on the writings of Josephus, and correlates it with Matthew 14:4 and Mark 6:18. Given that most scholars date the marriage of Herod and Herodias as AD 28–35, this yields a date about AD 28–29.

A number of approaches have been used to estimate the year of the crucifixion of Jesus. Most scholars agree that he died in AD 30 or 33. The Gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from AD 26 to 36. The date for the conversion of Paul (estimated to be AD 33–36) acts as an upper bound for the date of Crucifixion. The dates for Paul&#x27;s conversion and ministry can be determined by analysing the Pauline epistles and the Acts of the Apostles. Astronomers have tried to estimate the precise date of the Crucifixion by analysing lunar motion and calculating historic dates of Passover, a festival based on the lunisolar Hebrew calendar. The most widely accepted dates derived from this method are 7 April AD 30, and 3 April AD 33 (both Julian).

=== Historicity of events ===


Nearly all historians (both modern and historical) agree that Jesus was a real person who historically existed. Scholars have reached a limited consensus on the basics of Jesus&#x27;s life.

==== Family ====

Many scholars agree that Joseph, Jesus&#x27;s father, died before Jesus began his ministry. Joseph is not mentioned in the Gospels during Jesus&#x27;s ministry. Joseph&#x27;s death would explain why in Mark 6:3, Jesus&#x27;s neighbours refer to Jesus as the &quot;son of Mary&quot; (sons were usually identified by their fathers).

According to Theissen and Merz, it is common for extraordinary charismatic leaders, such as Jesus, to come into conflict with their ordinary families. In Mark, Jesus&#x27;s family comes to get him, fearing that he is mad (Mark 3:20–34), and this account is thought to be historical because early Christians would probably not have invented it. After Jesus&#x27;s death, many members of his family joined the Christian movement. Jesus&#x27;s brother James became a leader of the Jerusalem Church.

Géza Vermes says that the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus arose from theological development rather than from historical events.
Despite the widely held view that the authors of the Synoptic Gospels drew upon each other (the so-called synoptic problem), other scholars take it as significant that the virgin birth is attested by two separate gospels, Matthew and Luke.

According to E. P. Sanders, the birth narratives in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke are the clearest cases of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus&#x27;s life. Marcus Borg concurs, explaining that, &quot;I (and most mainline scholars) do not see these stories as historically factual.&quot; Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, in accordance with Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points out that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke&#x27;s account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew&#x27;s account is more plausible, but the story reads as though it was invented to identify Jesus as a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great&#x27;s brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys. The contradictions between the two Gospels were probably apparent to the early Christians already, since attempts to harmonize the two narratives are already present in the earlier apocryphal infancy gospels (the Infancy Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of James), which are dated to the 2nd century AD.

Conservative scholars argue that despite the uncertainty of the details, the gospel birth narratives trace back to historical, or at least much earlier pre-gospel traditions. For instance, according to Ben Witherington:
Sanders says that the genealogies of Jesus are based not on historical information but on the author&#x27;s desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish saviour. In any event, once the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph. The Gospel of Luke reports that Jesus was a blood relative of John the Baptist, but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.

==== Baptism ====

Most modern scholars consider Jesus&#x27;s baptism to be a definite historical fact, along with his crucifixion. The theologian James D. G. Dunn states that they &quot;command almost universal assent&quot; and &quot;rank so high on the &#x27;almost impossible to doubt or deny&#x27; scale of historical facts&quot; that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus. Scholars adduce the criterion of embarrassment, saying that early Christians would not have invented a baptism that might imply that Jesus committed sins and wanted to repent. According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus was inspired by John the Baptist and took over from him many elements of his teaching.

==== Ministry in Galilee ====
Most scholars hold that Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea and did not preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities on the subject of God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus&#x27;s Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.

According to Ehrman, Jesus taught that a coming kingdom was everyone&#x27;s proper focus, not anything in this life. He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, sometimes in opposition to traditions. Jesus put love at the center of the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well.

The Gospels portray Jesus teaching in well-defined sessions, such as the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew or the parallel Sermon on the Plain in Luke. According to Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz, these teaching sessions include authentic teachings of Jesus, but the scenes were invented by the respective evangelists to frame these teachings, which had originally been recorded without context. While Jesus&#x27;s miracles fit within the social context of antiquity, he defined them differently. First, he attributed them to the faith of those healed. Second, he connected them to end times prophecy.

Jesus chose twelve disciples (the &quot;Twelve&quot;), evidently as an apocalyptic message. All three Synoptics mention the Twelve, although the names on Luke&#x27;s list vary from those in Mark and Matthew, suggesting that Christians were not certain who all the disciples were. The twelve disciples might have represented the twelve original tribes of Israel, which would be restored once God&#x27;s rule was instituted. The disciples were reportedly meant to be the rulers of the tribes in the coming Kingdom. According to Bart Ehrman, Jesus&#x27;s promise that the Twelve would rule is historical, because the Twelve included Judas Iscariot. In Ehrman&#x27;s view, no Christians would have invented a line from Jesus, promising rulership to the disciple who betrayed him.

In Mark, the disciples play hardly any role other than a negative one. While others sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, his disciples are puzzled and doubtful. They serve as a foil to Jesus and to other characters. The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.

Sanders says that Jesus&#x27;s mission was not about repentance, although he acknowledges that this opinion is unpopular. He argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was John the Baptist&#x27;s message, and that Jesus&#x27;s ministry would not have been scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been repentant. According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus taught that God was generously giving people an opportunity to repent.

==== Role ====
Jesus taught that an apocalyptic figure, the &quot;Son of Man&quot;, would soon come on clouds of glory to gather the elect or chosen ones. He referred to himself as a &quot;son of man&quot; in the colloquial sense of &quot;a person&quot;, but scholars do not know whether he also meant himself when he referred to the heavenly &quot;Son of Man&quot;. Paul the Apostle and other early Christians interpreted the &quot;Son of Man&quot; as the risen Jesus.

The Gospels refer to Jesus not only as a messiah but in the absolute form as &quot;the Messiah&quot; or, equivalently, &quot;the Christ&quot;. In early Judaism, this absolute form of the title is not found, but only phrases such as &quot;his messiah&quot;. The tradition is ambiguous enough to leave room for debate as to whether Jesus defined his eschatological role as that of the Messiah. The Jewish messianic tradition included many different forms, some of them focused on a messiah figure and others not. Based on the Christian tradition, Gerd Theissen advances the hypothesis that Jesus saw himself in messianic terms but did not claim the title &quot;Messiah&quot;. Bart Ehrman argues that Jesus did consider himself to be the Messiah, albeit in the sense that he would be the king of the new political order that God would usher in, not in the sense that most people today think of the term.

==== Passover and crucifixion in Jerusalem ====
Around AD 30, Jesus and his followers travelled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which was the center of Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus&#x27;s prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus held a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist. His words as recorded in the Synoptic gospels and Paul&#x27;s First Letter to the Corinthians do not entirely agree, but this meal appears to have pointed to Jesus&#x27;s place in the coming Kingdom of God when very probably Jesus knew he was about to be killed, although he may have still hoped that God might yet intervene.

The Gospels say that Jesus was betrayed to the authorities by a disciple, and many scholars consider this report to be highly reliable. He was executed on the orders of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Judaea. Pilate most likely saw Jesus&#x27;s reference to the Kingdom of God as a threat to Roman authority and worked with the Temple elites to have Jesus executed. The Sadducean high-priestly leaders of the Temple more plausibly had Jesus executed for political reasons than for his teaching. They may have regarded him as a threat to stability, especially after he caused a disturbance at the Second Temple. Other factors, such as Jesus&#x27;s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, may have contributed to this decision. Most scholars consider Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion to be factual because early Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.

==== After crucifixion ====

After Jesus&#x27;s death, his followers said he was restored to life, although the exact details of their experiences are unclear. The gospel reports contradict each other, possibly suggesting competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.

=== Portraits of Jesus ===

Modern research on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, partly because of the variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the basic elements of his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the Gospels.

Jesus is seen as the founder of, in the words of Sanders, a &quot;renewal movement within Judaism&quot;. One of the criteria used to discern historical details in the &quot;third quest&quot; is the criterion of plausibility, relative to Jesus&#x27;s Jewish context and to his influence on Christianity. A disagreement in contemporary research is whether Jesus was apocalyptic. Most scholars conclude that he was an apocalyptic preacher, such as John the Baptist and Paul the Apostle. In contrast, certain prominent North American scholars, such as Burton Mack and John Dominic Crossan, advocate for a non-eschatological Jesus, one who is more of a Cynic sage than an apocalyptic preacher. In addition to portraying Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet, a charismatic healer or a cynic philosopher, some scholars portray him as the true messiah or an egalitarian prophet of social change. However, the attributes described in the portraits sometimes overlap, and scholars who differ on some attributes sometimes agree on others.

Since the 18th century, scholars have occasionally put forth that Jesus was a political national messiah, but the evidence for this portrait is negligible. Likewise, the proposal that Jesus was a Zealot does not fit with the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.

=== Language, ethnicity, and appearance ===

Jesus grew up in Galilee and much of his ministry took place there. The languages spoken in Galilee and Judea during the 1st century AD include Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek, with Aramaic being predominant. There is substantial consensus that Jesus gave most of his teachings in Aramaic in the Galilean dialect. Other than Aramaic and Hebrew, it is likely that he was also able to speak in Greek.

Modern scholars agree that Jesus was a Jew of 1st-century Judea. in New Testament Greek is a term which in the contemporary context may refer to religion (Second Temple Judaism), ethnicity (of Judea), or both. In a review of the state of modern scholarship, Amy-Jill Levine writes that the entire question of ethnicity is &quot;fraught with difficulty&quot;, and that &quot;beyond recognizing that &#x27;Jesus was Jewish&#x27;, rarely does the scholarship address what being &#x27;Jewish&#x27; means&quot;.

The New Testament gives no description of the physical appearance of Jesus before his death—it is generally indifferent to racial appearances and does not refer to the features of the people it mentions. Jesus probably looked like a typical Jewish man of his time and place; standing around tall with a thin but fit build, olive-brown skin, brown eyes and short, dark hair. He also probably had a beard that was not particularly long or heavy.

=== Christ myth theory ===

The Christ myth theory is the hypothesis that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels. Stories of Jesus&#x27;s birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was a myth.

Bruno Bauer (1809–1882) taught that the first Gospel was a work of literature that produced history rather than described it. According to Albert Kalthoff (1850–1906), a social movement produced Jesus when it encountered Jewish messianic expectations. Arthur Drews (1865–1935) saw Jesus as the concrete form of a myth that predated Christianity.

Despite arguments put forward by authors who have questioned the existence of a historical Jesus, virtually all scholars of antiquity accept that Jesus was a historical figure and consider Christ&#x27;s myth theory fringe.

== Religious perspectives ==

Jesus&#x27;s teachings and the retelling of his life story have significantly influenced the course of human history, and have directly or indirectly affected the lives of billions of people, even non-Christians, worldwide. He is considered by many people to be the most influential figure to have ever lived, finding a significant place in numerous cultural contexts.

Apart from his own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus&#x27;s day generally rejected him as the messiah, as does Judaism today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and others have written extensively about Jesus over the centuries. Christian denominations have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Druzes, the Baháʼís, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their religions.

=== Christianity ===


Jesus is the central figure of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is possible to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from the texts of the New Testament, including the canonical gospels and letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.

The New Testament states that the resurrection of Jesus is the foundation of the Christian faith. Christians believe that through his sacrificial death and resurrection, humans can be reconciled with God and are thereby offered salvation and the promise of eternal life. Recalling the words of John the Baptist in the gospel of John, these doctrines sometimes refer to Jesus as the Lamb of God, who was crucified to fulfill his role as the servant of God. Jesus is thus seen as the new and last Adam, whose obedience contrasts with Adam&#x27;s disobedience. Christians view Jesus as a role model, whose God-focused life believers are encouraged to imitate.

At present, most Christians believe that Jesus is both human and the Son of God. While there has been theological debate over his nature, Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is the Logos, God&#x27;s incarnation and God the Son, both fully divine and fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus&#x27;s two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

Christians revere not only Jesus himself but also his name. Devotions to the Holy Name of Jesus go back to the earliest days of Christianity. These devotions and feasts exist in both Eastern and Western Christianity.

=== Judaism&#x27;s view ===
Judaism rejects the idea of Jesus (or any future Jewish messiah) being God, or a mediator to God, or part of a Trinity. It holds that Jesus is not the messiah, arguing that he neither fulfilled the messianic prophecies in the Tanakh nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. Jews argue that Jesus did not fulfill prophecies to build the Third Temple, gather Jews back to Israel, bring world peace, and unite humanity under the God of Israel. Furthermore, according to Jewish tradition, there were no prophets after Malachi, who delivered his prophecies in the 5th century BC.

Judaic criticism of Jesus is long-standing, and includes a range of stories in the Talmud, written and compiled from the 3rd to the 5th century AD. In one such story, &quot;Yeshu HaNozri&quot; (&#x27;Jesus the Nazarene&#x27;), a lewd apostate, is executed by the Jewish high court for spreading idolatry and practising magic. According to some, the form Yeshu is an acronym which in Hebrew reads &quot;may his name and memory be blotted out&quot;. The majority of contemporary scholars consider that this material provides no information on the historical Jesus. The &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, a late 12th-century work of Jewish law written by Moses Maimonides, states that Jesus is a &quot;stumbling block&quot; who makes &quot;the majority of the world to err and serve a god other than the Lord&quot;.

Medieval Hebrew literature contains the anecdotal &quot;Episode of Jesus&quot; (known also as &quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot;), in which Jesus is described as being the son of Joseph, the son of Pandera (see: ). The account portrays Jesus as an impostor.

=== Manichaeism ===

Manichaeism, an ancient religious movement, became one of the earliest organized religions outside of Christianity to honor Jesus as a significant figure. Within the Manichaean belief system, Jesus is revered alongside other prominent prophets such as Zoroaster, Gautama Buddha, and Mani himself.

=== Islam ===

A major figure in Islam, Jesus (often referred to by his Quranic name ) is considered to be a messenger of God and the messiah () who was sent to guide the Children of Israel () with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as ). Muslims regard the gospels&#x27; accounts in the New Testament as partially authentic, and believe that Jesus&#x27;s original message was altered () and that Muhammad came later to revive it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God&#x27;s message. While the Quran affirms the Virgin birth of Jesus, he is considered to be neither an incarnation nor a son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism () and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. 

The Quran describes the annunciation to Mary () by the Holy Spirit that she is to give birth to Jesus while remaining a virgin. It calls the virgin birth a miracle that occurred by the will of God. The Quran ( and ) states that God breathed his spirit into Mary while she was chaste. Jesus is called a &quot;spirit from God&quot; because he was born through the action of the Spirit, but that belief does not imply his pre-existence.

To aid in his ministry to the Jewish people, Jesus was given the ability to perform miracles, by permission of God rather than by his own power. Through his ministry, Jesus is seen as a precursor to Muhammad. In the Quran () it is said that Jesus was not killed but was merely made to appear that way to unbelievers, and that he was raised into the heavens while still alive by God. According to most classic Sunni and Twelver Shi&#x27;ite interpretations of these verses, the likeness of Jesus was cast upon a substitute (most often one of the apostles), who was crucified in Jesus&#x27;s stead. However, some medieval Muslims (among others, the  writing under the name of al-Mufaddal ibn Umar al-Ju&#x27;fi, the Brethren of Purity, various Isma&#x27;ili philosophers, and the Sunni mystic al-Ghazali) affirmed the historicity of Jesus&#x27;s crucifixion. These thinkers held the docetic view that, although Jesus&#x27;s human form (his body) had died on the cross, his true divine nature (his spirit) had survived and ascended into heaven, so that his death was only an appearance. Nevertheless, to Muslims it is the &quot;ascension&quot; rather than the &quot;crucifixion&quot; that constitutes a major event in the life of Jesus. There is no mention of his resurrection on the third day, and his death plays no special role in Islamic theories of salvation. However, Jesus is a central figure in Islamic eschatology: Muslims believe that he will return to Earth at the end of time and defeat the Antichrist (&quot;ad-Dajjal&quot;) by killing him.

According to the Quran, the coming of Muhammad (also called &quot;Ahmad&quot;) was predicted by Jesus:

Through this verse, early Arab Muslims claimed legitimacy for their new faith in the existing religious traditions and the alleged predictions of Jesus.

==== Ahmadiyya ====
The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has several distinct teachings about Jesus. Ahmadis believe that he was a mortal man who survived his crucifixion and died a natural death at the age of 120 in Kashmir, India, and is buried at Roza Bal.

=== Druze ===

In the Druze faith, Jesus is considered and revered as one of the seven spokesmen or prophets (), defined as messengers or intermediaries between God and mankind, along with figures including Moses, Muhammad and Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il, each of them sent at a different period of history to preach the message of God. In Druze tradition, Jesus is known under three titles: the True Messiah (), the Messiah of all Nations (), and the Messiah of Sinners. This is due, respectively, to the belief that Jesus delivered the true Gospel message, the belief that he was the Saviour of all nations, and the belief that he offers forgiveness.

=== Baháʼí Faith ===
In the Baháʼí Faith, Jesus is considered one of the Manifestations of God, defined as divine messengers or prophets sent by God to guide humanity, along with other religious figures such as Moses, Krishna, Zoroaster, Buddha, Muhammad, and Baháʼu&#x27;lláh. Baháʼís believe that these religious founders or leaders have contributed to the progressive revelation by bringing spiritual and moral values to humanity in their own time and place. As a Manifestation of God, Jesus is believed to reflect God&#x27;s qualities and attributes, but is not considered the only saviour of humanity nor the incarnation of God. Baháʼís believe in the virgin birth, but see the resurrection and the miracles of Jesus as symbolic.

=== Other ===


In Christian Gnosticism (now a largely extinct religious movement), Jesus was sent from the divine realm and provided the secret knowledge (gnosis) necessary for salvation. Most Gnostics believed that Jesus was a human who became possessed by the spirit of &quot;the Christ&quot; at his baptism. This spirit left Jesus&#x27;s body during the crucifixion but was rejoined to him when he was raised from the dead. Some Gnostics, however, were docetics, believing that Jesus did not have a physical body, but only appeared to possess one.

Some Hindus consider Jesus to be an avatar or a sadhu. Paramahansa Yogananda, an Indian guru, taught that Jesus was the reincarnation of Elisha and a student of John the Baptist, the reincarnation of Elijah. Some Buddhists, including Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, regard Jesus as a bodhisattva who dedicated his life to the welfare of people. The New Age movement entertains a wide variety of views on Jesus. Theosophists, from whom many New Age teachings originated, refer to Jesus as the Master Jesus, a spiritual reformer, and they believe that Christ, after various incarnations, occupied the body of Jesus. &quot;The Urantia Book&quot; teaches Jesus is one of more than 700,000 heavenly sons of God. Antony Theodore in the book &quot;Jesus Christ in Love&quot; writes that there is an underlying oneness of Jesus&#x27;s teachings with the messages contained in Quran, Vedas, Upanishads, Talmud and Avesta. Atheists reject Jesus&#x27;s divinity, but have different views about him—from challenging his mental health to emphasizing his &quot;moral superiority&quot; (Richard Dawkins).

== Artistic depictions ==


Some of the earliest depictions of Jesus at the Dura-Europos church are firmly dated to before 256. Thereafter, despite the lack of biblical references or historical records, a wide range of depictions of Jesus appeared during the last two millennia, often influenced by cultural settings, political circumstances and theological contexts. As in other Early Christian art, the earliest depictions date to the late 2nd or early 3rd century, and surviving images are found especially in the Catacombs of Rome.

The depiction of Christ in pictorial form was highly controversial in the early Church. From the 5th century onward, flat painted icons became popular in the Eastern Church. The Byzantine Iconoclasm acted as a barrier to developments in the East, but by the 9th century, art was permitted again. The Protestant Reformation brought renewed resistance to imagery, but total prohibition was atypical, and Protestant objections to images have tended to reduce since the 16th century. Although large images are generally avoided, few Protestants now object to book illustrations depicting Jesus. The use of depictions of Jesus is advocated by the leaders of denominations such as Anglicans and Catholics and is a key element of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.

In Eastern Christian art, the Transfiguration was a major theme, and every Eastern Orthodox monk who had trained in icon painting had to prove his craft by painting an icon depicting it. Icons receive the external marks of veneration, such as kisses and prostration, and they are thought to be powerful channels of divine grace.

In Western Europe, the Renaissance brought forth a number of artists who focused on depictions of Jesus; Fra Angelico and others followed Giotto in the systematic development of uncluttered images. Before the Protestant Reformation, the crucifix was common in Western Christianity. It is a model of the cross with Jesus crucified on it. The crucifix became the central ornament of the altar in the 13th century, a use that has been nearly universal in Roman Catholic churches since then.

== Associated relics ==

The total destruction that ensued with the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans in AD 70 made the survival of items from 1st-century Judea very rare and almost no direct records survive about the history of Judaism from the last part of the 1st century through the 2nd century. Margaret M. Mitchell writes that although Eusebius reports (&quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; III 5.3) that the early Christians left Jerusalem for Pella just before Jerusalem was subjected to the final lockdown, we must accept that no first-hand Christian items from the early Jerusalem Church have reached us. Joe Nickell writes, &quot;as investigation after investigation has shown, not a single, reliably authenticated relic of Jesus exists.&quot;

However, throughout the history of Christianity, a number of relics attributed to Jesus have been claimed, although doubt has been cast on them. The 16th-century Catholic theologian Erasmus wrote sarcastically about the proliferation of relics and the number of buildings that could have been constructed from the wood claimed to be from the cross used in the Crucifixion. Similarly, while experts debate whether Jesus was crucified with three nails or with four, at least thirty holy nails continue to be venerated as relics across Europe.

Some relics, such as purported remnants of the crown of thorns placed on the head of Jesus, receive only a modest number of pilgrims, while the Shroud of Turin (which is associated with an approved Catholic devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus), has received millions, including the popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI.

<text>John Kitto (4 December 1804 – 25 November 1854) was an English biblical scholar of Cornish descent.

==Biography==
Born in Plymouth, John Kitto was a sickly child, son of a Cornish stonemason. The drunkenness of his father and the poverty of his family meant that much of his childhood was spent in the workhouse. He had no more than three years of erratic and interrupted education. At the age of twelve John Kitto fell on his head from a rooftop, and became totally and permanently deaf. As a young man he suffered further tragedies, disappointments and much loneliness. His height was 4 ft 8 in, and his accident left him with an impaired sense of balance. He found consolation in browsing at bookstalls and reading any books that came his way.

From these hardships he was rescued by friends who became aware of his mental abilities and encouraged him to write topical articles for local newspapers, arranging eventually for him to work as an assistant in a local library. Here he continued to educate himself.

One of his benefactors was the Exeter dentist Anthony Norris Groves, who in 1824 offered him employment as a dental assistant. Living with the Groves family, Kitto was profoundly influenced by the practical Christian faith of his employer. In 1829 he accompanied Groves on his pioneering mission to Baghdad and served as tutor to Groves&#x27;s two sons. In 1833 Kitto returned to England via Constantinople, accompanied by another member of the Groves mission, Francis William Newman. Shortly afterwards he married, and in due course had several children.

A London publisher asked Kitto to write up his travel journals for a series of articles in the &quot;Penny Magazine&quot;, a publication read at that time by a million people in Britain, reprinted in America and translated into French, German and Dutch. Other writing projects followed as readers enquired about his experiences in the East amidst people living in circumstances closely resembling those of Bible times.

==Scholarship==
Kitto had been a careful observer of physical detail – the topography, the animals, architecture, agricultural methods, the manner of interaction between people. His retelling of Bible stories in the light of what he had seen brought the narratives to life and confirmed the accuracy of the ancient texts. He showed how the activities described by the prophets and apostles accorded with the realities of Eastern culture. He supplemented his own observations with details from the journals of other travellers, and helped the Bible reader to understand many things previously obscure or contradictory to the Western mind. His careful research into the geography, biology and archaeology of Bible lands served to support and encourage confidence in the accuracy of the Bible.

In his generation Dr Kitto was a most significant contributor to Christian scholarship, and he provided much help for Evangelicals defending the Bible against the attack of liberal critics. He eventually wrote a total of twenty-three books, of which Charles Spurgeon considered the &quot;Daily Bible Illustrations&quot; to be &quot;more interesting than any novel that was ever written, and as instructive as the heaviest theology.&quot;

Inevitably, Kitto&#x27;s encyclopedic works have been superseded by the researches of later generations of scholars. Yet his &quot;Pictorial Bible&quot; and &quot;Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature&quot; held, for almost a century, a unique and valued place on the academic library shelf, and his &quot;Daily Bible Illustrations&quot; encouraged the faith of readers of all ages and backgrounds, and stimulated the imagination of many a Sunday school teacher.

The sensible style that made Kitto so popular can be seen in this brief passage, written at a time when attempts to reconstruct the design of the Temple of Solomon on paper, in scale models, and in the architecture of churches, synagogues and Masonic Halls was a serious scholarly pursuit:
:&quot;These descriptions (found in Kings and Chronicles) enable us to realize a tolerably clear idea of many important details of this glorious structure; but they do not suffice to afford us a distinct notion of the architectural elevation of the principal buildings. If any proof of this fact were wanting, it would be found in the circumstance that almost every scholar or architect who has attempted to make a design of the fabric, from the description which exist in the Scripture and in Josephus, has furnished something very different from what has been produced by others making the same attempt.&quot;

John Kitto summed up his life in the following words: 
:&quot;I perhaps have as much right as any man that lives, to bear witness that there is no one so low but that he may rise, no condition so cast down as to be really hopeless, and no privation which need, of itself, shut out any man from the paths of honourable exertion or from the hope of usefulness in life. I have sometimes thought that it was possibly my mission to affirm and establish these great truths.&quot;

==Tributes==

In 1844 the University of Giessen conferred upon him the degree of D.D. In 1850 he received a pension for life from the British government. He died on 25 November 1854 at Cannstatt in Germany.

Kitto Road in New Cross (South London), built in the late 19th century by the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers, is believed to have been named after John Kitto.

In 1989 the Burrington Secondary Modern School in Plymouth was renamed the John Kitto Comprehensive School in his honour, and later, the John Kitto Community College. In September 2010 it became the All Saints Church of England Academy, Plymouth.

== Family ==
John Kitto&#x27;s son, John Fenwick Kitto, was an Anglican priest who served as Rector of Whitechapel, Rector of Stepney, and Vicar of St Martin-in-the-Fields.

:THE HISTORY OF PALESTINE, FROM THE PATRIARCHAL AGE TO THE PRESENT TIME; With Introductory Chapters on the Geography and Natural History of the Country And on the Customs and Institutions of the Hebrews. By JOHN KITTO, D.D., F.S.A., Editor of the &quot;Pictorial Bible&quot;, &amp;c., &amp;c. With Questions for Examination. By ALEX REID, A.M., Rector of Circus Place School. This work has been undertaken with the view of supplying what has long been felt as a desideratum in Schools, —a History of Palestine, with Accounts of the Geography of the country, and of the Customs and Institutions of its ancient inhabitants, such as have been introduced with much advantage in recent school histories of other nations. The History has been written expressly for its present use, and is in no respect an abridgment of the author&#x27;s larger work, &quot;the Pictorial History of Palestine.&quot; In its preparation simplicity and precision of style qualifications so essential to the usefulness of a School-book have been steadily kept in view; and the descriptive portion of the work is liberally embellished with Wood Engravings, representing Landscapes, Buildings, Plants, Illustrations of Manners and Customs, and whatever can be more clearly displayed by pictorial than by written description, or by which the written text may be in any degree elucidated. Although primarily intended for the use of Schools, the book will be found well suited for general purposes, being a complete Manual of Jewish History and Antiquities, and as such, proper to accompany the Sacred Volume as a popular digest of, and commentary on, all its material facts.

<doc id="1095712" wikidata="Q746426" url="?curid=1095712" title="Muscle dysmorphia">
<text>Muscle dysmorphia is a subtype of the obsessive mental disorder body dysmorphic disorder, but is often also grouped with eating disorders. In muscle dysmorphia, which is sometimes called &quot;bigorexia&quot;, &quot;megarexia&quot;, or &quot;reverse anorexia&quot;, the delusional or exaggerated belief is that one&#x27;s own body is too small, too skinny, insufficiently muscular, or insufficiently lean, although in most cases, the individual&#x27;s build is normal or even exceptionally large and muscular already.

Muscle dysmorphia affects mostly men, particularly those involved in sports where body size or weight are competitive factors, becoming rationales to gain muscle or become leaner. The quest to seemingly fix one&#x27;s body consumes inordinate time, attention, and resources, as on exercise routines, dietary regimens, and nutritional supplementation, while use of anabolic steroids is also common. Other body-dysmorphic preoccupations that are not muscle-dysmorphic are usually present as well.

Although likened to anorexia nervosa, muscle dysmorphia is especially difficult to recognize, since awareness of it is scarce and persons experiencing muscle dysmorphia typically remain healthy looking. The distress and distraction of muscle dysmorphia may provoke absences from school, work, and social settings. Compared to other body dysmorphic disorders, rates of suicide attempts are especially high with muscle dysmorphia. Researchers believe that muscle dysmorphia&#x27;s incidence is rising, partly due to the recent cultural emphasis on muscular male bodies.

==Signs and symptoms==

Although body dissatisfaction has been found in boys as young as age six, muscle dysmorphia&#x27;s onset is estimated at usually between ages 18 and 20. According to &quot;DSM-5&quot;, muscle dysmorphia is indicated by the diagnostic criteria for body dysmorphic disorder via &quot;the idea that his or her body is too small or insufficiently muscular&quot;, and this specifier holds even if the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, too, as is often the case.

Further clinical features identified include excessive conduct of efforts to increase muscularity, activities such as dietary restriction, overtraining, and injection of growth-enhancing drugs. Persons experiencing muscle dysmorphia generally spend over three hours daily pondering increased muscularity, and may feel unable to limit weightlifting. As in anorexia nervosa, the reverse quest in muscle dysmorphia can be insatiable. Those suffering from the disorder closely monitor their body and may wear multiple clothing layers to make it appear larger.

Muscle dysmorphia involves severe distress at having one&#x27;s body viewed by others. Occupational and social functioning are impaired, and dietary regimes may interfere with these. Patients often avoid activities, people, and places that threaten to reveal their perceived deficiency of size or muscularity. Roughly half of patients have poor or no insight that these perceptions are unrealistic. Patient histories reveal elevated rates of diagnoses of other mental disorders, including eating disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorder, as well as elevated rates of suicide attempts.

==Risk factors==

Although muscle dysmorphia&#x27;s development is unclear, several risk factors have been identified.

===Trauma and bullying===
Versus the general population, persons manifesting muscle dysmorphia are more likely to have experienced or observed traumatic events like sexual assault or domestic violence, or to have sustained adolescent bullying and ridicule for actual or perceived deficiencies such as smallness, weakness, poor athleticism, or intellectual inferiority. Increased body mass may seem to reduce the threat of further mistreatment.

===Sociopsychological traits===
Low self-esteem is associated with higher levels of body dissatisfaction and of muscle dysmorphia. Vulnerable narcissism has also been linked to heightened muscle dysmorphia risk. Increased body size or muscularity may seem to enhance the masculine identity.

===Media exposure===
As Western media emphasize physical attractiveness, some marketing campaigns now exploit male body-image insecurities. Since the 1980s, the number of fitness magazines and of partially undressed, muscular men in advertisements have increased. Such media provoke bodily comparisons and pressure individuals to conform, yet increase the gap between men&#x27;s perceptions of their own muscularity versus their desired muscularity. In college-aged men, a strong predictor of a muscularity quest is internalization of the idealized male bodies depicted in media.

===Athletic participation===
Athletes tend to share some psychological factors that may predispose to muscle dysmorphia, factors including high levels of competitiveness, need for control, and perfectionism, and athletes tend to be more critical of their own bodies and body weight. Athletes who also fail to their sports performance goals may escalate efforts to modify their builds, efforts that overlap those of muscle dysmorphia. Involvement in sports where size, strength, or weight, whether higher or lower, imply competitive advantage associates with muscle dysmorphia. Athletic ideals reinforce the social ideal of muscularity. Conversely, those already disposed to muscle dysmorphia may be more likely to participate in such sports.

===Sexual orientation===
It has been observed that men who have sex with men (MSM) have a unique relationship with the development of muscle dysmorphia symptoms. MSM are at increased risk for experiencing internalized heterosexism, which can lead to dissatisfaction with one&#x27;s body and the internalizing of standards for attractiveness. Men who conform to conventional ideals of masculinity often report increased stress from not meeting the imposed standard of a masculine and muscular body. In a sample of 2,733 MSM who reported body dissatisfaction, only one in every 10 reported feeling no dissatisfaction with their muscularity. Dissatisfaction with muscularity had a stronger relationship with quality of life impairment when compared to dissatisfaction with body fat, height, and penis size. 

Those who identify as a sexual minority are at increased risk for victimization due to their identity. Having been a victim of homophobic bullying is associated with more symptoms of muscle dysmorphia. A possible cause for this relationship can be the increased feelings of paranoid ideation that a MSM individual can experience following homophobic bullying.

==Diagnosis==

==Treatment==

Treatment of muscle dysmorphia can be stymied by a patient&#x27;s unawareness that the preoccupation is disordered or by avoidance of treatment. Scientific research on treatment of muscle dysmorphia is limited, the evidence largely in case reports and anecdotes, and no specific protocols have been validated. Still, evidence supports the efficacy of family-based therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, and pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Also limited is research on prognosis of the untreated.

==Prevalence==

Prevalence estimates for muscle dysmorphia have greatly varied, ranging from 1% to 54% of men in the studied samples. Samples of gym members, weightlifters, and bodybuilders show higher prevalence than do samples from the general population. Rates even higher have been found among users of anabolic steroids. The disorder is rare in women but does occur, and has been noted especially in female bodybuilders who have experienced sexual assault.

Muscle dysmorphia has been identified in China, South Africa, and Latin America. Nonwestern populations less exposed to western media show lower rates of muscle dysmorphia.

==History==

Muscle dysmorphia was first conceptualized by healthcare professionals in the late 1990s. In 2016, 50% of peer-reviewed articles on it had been published in the prior five years.

Although muscle dysmorphia was initially viewed as anorexia nervosa&#x27;s inverse—questing to be large and muscular instead of small and thin—later researchers fit the subjective experience to body dysmorphic disorder.

The American Psychiatric Association recognized muscle dysmorphia with the fifth edition of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;, which classifies it under body dysmorphic disorder. Muscle dysmorphia is absent from the &quot;International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems present edition, the tenth, published in 1992.

==Reclassifications==

Muscle dysmorphia&#x27;s classification has been widely debated, and alternative &quot;DSM&quot; classifications have been proposed.

*Eating disorder: Many of muscle dysmorphia&#x27;s traits overlap with those of eating disorders, including focus on body weight, shape, and modification, whereas body dysmorphic disorder otherwise usually lacks such dietary and exercise components. Also, persons experiencing muscle dysmorphia tend to score high on the Eating Attitudes Test and Eating Disorder Inventory, while muscle dysmorphia and anorexia nervosa share diagnostic crossover. Muscle dysmorphia and disordered eating correlate more to each other than either correlates to body dysmorphic disorder. Treatment for eating disorders may also be effective for muscle dysmorphia.
* Behavioral addiction: Some researchers seek muscle dysmorphia&#x27;s reclassification as a behavioral addiction. Muscle dysmorphia&#x27;s effort to maintain body image is enacted through activities such as exercise, diet, and related shopping, which may cause conflicts with others. Moreover, compulsive muscle building and dietary restriction can escalate these conflicts. Further, abstinence from these activities can provoke withdrawal symptoms, returning the individual to compulsive behavior.

<text>Henry Gally Knight, F.R.S. (2 December 1786 – 9 February 1846) was a British politician, traveller and writer.

==Biography==
Knight was the only son of Henry Gally (afterwards Gally Knight), barrister, of Langold, and was educated at Eton and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He succeeded in 1808 to estates at Firbeck and Langold Park which his father had inherited in 1804 from his brother John Gally Knight.

Knight was appointed High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire for 1814–1815. He also held the office of deputy-lieutenant of Nottinghamshire. He was a Member of Parliament for the constituencies Aldborough (12 August 1814 - April 1815), Malton (1831–1832; 31 March 1835 - 9 February 1846), North Nottinghamshire (1835 and in 1837). In parliament he was a fluent but infrequent speaker. He was also a member of the commission for the advancement of the fine arts.
Knight was the subject of the 1818 satirical poem &quot;Ballad to the Tune of Salley in our Alley&quot; by Lord Byron, in which Byron facetiously accuses him of being not only a poetaster, but a dandy as well.

Knight owned Firbeck Hall in Rotherham. Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; is set nearby, and Knight may have been Scott&#x27;s source of local information when he was writing the book. He was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society on 20 May 1841.

==Family==
Knight was the nephew of the novelist Frances Jacson. He married Henrietta, the daughter of Anthony Hardolph Eyre of Grove Park, Nottinghamshire and the widow of John Hardolph Eyre. They had no children.

==Works==

Knight was the author of several Oriental tales, &quot;Ilderim, a Syrian Tale&quot; (1816), &quot;Phrosyne, a Grecian Tale&quot;, and &quot;Alashtar, an Arabian Tale&quot; (1817). 

He was also an authority on architecture, and wrote various works on the subject, including &quot;Hannibal in Bithynia&quot;, &quot;An architectural tour in Normandy&quot; (1836), &quot;The Normans in Sicily&quot; (1838), and &quot;The Ecclesiastical Architecture of Italy&quot; (1842-4), described by Pevsner as a &quot;sumptiously illustrated sequel to &quot;The Normans in Sicily&quot;&quot;. These books brought him more reputation than his fictions.

<text>Sega Net Link (also called Sega Saturn Net Link) is an attachment for the Sega Saturn game console to provide Saturn users with internet access and access to email through their console. The unit was released in October 1996. The Sega Net Link fit into the Sega Saturn cartridge port and consisted of a 28.8 kbit/s modem, a custom chip to allow it to interface with the Saturn, and a browser developed by Planetweb, Inc. The unit sold for US$199, or US$400 bundled with a Sega Saturn. In 1997 Sega began selling the NetLink Bundle, which included the standard NetLink plus the compatible games &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; and &quot;Virtual On: Cyber Troopers NetLink Edition&quot;, for $99.

The Net Link connected to the internet through standard dial-up services. Unlike other online gaming services in the US, one does not connect to a central service, but instead tells the dial-up modem connected to the Saturn&#x27;s cartridge slot to call to the person with whom one wishes to play. Since it requires no servers to operate, the service can operate as long as at least two users have the necessary hardware and software, as well as a phone line.

In Japan, however, gamers did connect through a centralized service known as SegaNet, which would later be taken offline and converted for Dreamcast usage.

==History==
According to Yutaka Yamamoto, Sega of America&#x27;s director of new technology, the Saturn&#x27;s design allowed it to access the internet purely through software: &quot;Sega engineers always felt the Saturn would be good for multimedia applications as well as game playing. So they developed a kernel in the operating system to support communications tasks.&quot;

While the Net Link was not the first accessory which allowed console gamers in North America to play video games online (see online console gaming), it was the first to allow players to use their own Internet Service Provider (ISP) to connect. While Sega recommended that players use Concentric, the Sega Net Link enabled players to choose any ISP that was within its technical specifications. The device was capable of connecting at a 28.8 kilobit/s connection in America and 14.4 kbit/s in Japan. However, it suffered from memory limitations; the modem&#x27;s static RAM could store only account information and bookmarks, leaving only the Saturn&#x27;s limited internal RAM for any downloaded data. This makes it impossible to download audio or video clips, save e-mail messages, or put previously loaded web pages into cache.

In Japan, the Net Link required the use of smartcards with prepaid credits. The Saturn had a floppy drive and printer cable converter (both Japan only) which could be used with the Net Link. A web browser from Planetweb was included, and a mouse and keyboard adapter were available to simplify navigation. Sega also released a dedicated Saturn mouse and Saturn keyboard. In addition, to allow users to browse with just the Saturn joypad, Sega produced a series of CDs containing hundreds of website addresses. The browser included a space magnifying function.

The Planetweb browser was written in C, and runs on just 570 KB, whereas a typical PC browser of the time used up about 6 MB. At the time most television screens ran at a lower resolution than computer monitors, so the browser used anti-aliasing to smooth out the edges of onscreen text characters. The browser could not properly display web sites which use frames.

Five games were released that supported the NetLink. All five were released in late 1997, nearly a year after the NetLink itself. Players could search for other players either on the Internet or using the XBAND matchmaking system, then connect peer-to-peer via modem, or alternatively, use two NetLinks to connect two Saturns and two televisions set up in the same room (thus eliminating the need for a phone line and essentially using the NetLink to emulate the Saturn Link Cable).

Launching at 15,000 yen in Japan and $199 in the USA, it was considered very inexpensive compared to competing online services. It was a runner-up for &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s Best Peripheral of 1996 (behind the Saturn analog controller). Despite the media excitement over the device and its prominent appearance in Sega&#x27;s marketing campaign, less than 1% of Saturn owners purchased the NetLink in 1996. Over its lifetime, an estimated 50,000 NetLink units were sold in North America, half of Sega&#x27;s original goal. Another 1,100 units were donated by Sega of America to schools, in partnership with the nonprofit group Projectneat.

In 2017, fans were able to make the NetLink work a modern highspeed connection with VoIP.

==Net Link Zone==
The Net Link Zone connected to an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server irc.sega.com which was changed to the server irc0.dreamcast.com on the release of Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast. These servers were originally run by Sega employees but were given over to be run by Net Link chat users Leo Daniels and Mark Leatherman.

==Successor==
SegaNet was launched in 2000 for the Dreamcast, carrying the same name in Japan. The European counterpart was called Dreamarena.

==Games compatible with Net Link==
The following games are compatible with the Net Link:

*&quot;Daytona USA CCE NetLink Edition&quot;
*&quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;
*&quot;Saturn Bomberman&quot;
*&quot;Sega Rally Championship Plus&quot;

<text>The Pondicherry Makkal Congress, or Puducherry Makkal Congress (Puducherry Popular Congress), was a political party in the Indian union territory Puducherry (formerly known as Pondicherry). The PMC was formed as a splinter group of the Tamil Maanila Congress. The leader of the PMC was Abar Elumalai. In the assembly elections of Puducherry in 2001, the PMC won four seat (out of 30). Until 2001, the PMC supported the National Democratic Alliance, but then it started to support Indian National Congress. In August 2002 the PMC merged with the INC.

However, P. Kannan left Congress after that Democratic Progressive Alliance had allotted the Puducherry seat to Pattali Makkal Katchi ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.

As of 2005, P.Kannan had formed a new party, the Puducherry Munnetra Congress.

<doc id="1095725" wikidata="Q7925253" url="?curid=1095725" title="Vicesimus Knox">
<text>Vicesimus Knox (1752–1821) was an English essayist, headmaster and Anglican priest.

==Life==
Knox was born 8 December 1752, at Newington Green, Middlesex, the son of Vicesimus Knox (1729–1780), a cleric and schoolmaster, and his wife Ann Wall, daughter of Devereux Wall. He was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, matriculating in 1771 graduating in 1775. Meanwhile, his father became headmaster of Tonbridge School in 1772. Knox became a Fellow of his college, and was ordained by Robert Lowth, becoming deacon in 1775 and priest in 1776.

Knox replaced his father, who was in poor health, as headmaster of Tonbridge School in 1778. He was successful in raising the number of pupils, from around 20 to around 80. Among Knox&#x27;s students were Charles Girdlestone and John Mitford.

During the 1790s Knox was critical of British foreign policy, towards France and Poland, in articles written for the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;. The pupil numbers at the school fell back again, after his unpopular views became known.

Knox accumulated some livings: Shipborne (1800, a chapelry, as bequest from William Holles Vane, 2nd Viscount Vane), Ramsden Crays (1801), and Runwell (1807). But he did not become vicar of Tonbridge when the incumbent Henry Harpur died in 1790, the advowson passing out of the Vane family (to David Papillon), and John Rawstorn Papillon being appointed. Theophilus Lindsey had an account from Henry Austen of West Wickham of Knox acting as stand-in after Harpur&#x27;s death, as a showy preacher who made pointed remarks about Unitarians that Austen took personally.

==Views==
As an essayist Knox wrote extensively on morals and literature, and as a minister he preached often on behalf of philanthropic causes and against war.

===War and peace===
Knox argued that

&quot;If the Christian religion in all its purity, and in its full force, were suffered to prevail universally, the sword of offensive war must be sheathed for ever, and the din of arms would at last be silenced in perpetual peace&quot;.

and that

&quot;The total abolition of war, and the establishment of perpetual and universal peace, appear to me to be of more consequence than any thing ever achieved, or even attempted, by mere mortal man, since the creation&quot;.

===Novels===
Knox&#x27;s &quot;Essays Moral and Literary&quot;, Volume II, contains Essay XVIII &quot;On Novel Reading&quot;, which begins &quot;If it is true, that the present age is more corrupt than the preceding, the great multiplication of Novels probably contributes to its degeneracy.&quot; He considered that contact with &quot;Gil Blas&quot; or &quot;Devil Upon Two Sticks&quot;, picaresque novels by Alain-René Lesage, could cause a schoolboy to lose the taste for Latin classics.

The sentimental novel was explicitly linked by Knox to solitary vice. An early critic of Laurence Sterne, he took issue with the morality of &quot;A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy&quot;. He complained that Sterne and Elizabeth Draper, of &quot;Journal to Eliza&quot;, had too many imitators. &quot;Winter Evenings&quot; has a story of Belinda who was too fond of &quot;pathetic&quot; novels. Knox approved of travel writing.

<text>Königsberger Klopse (), also known as Soßklopse, are a German specialty of meatballs in a creamy white sauce with capers.

==Name==
The dish is named for the former German city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), and is one of the highlights of historical East Prussian cuisine. In the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the dish was officially called &quot;Kochklopse&quot; (&quot;boiled meatballs&quot;) to avoid any reference to its namesake city, which in the aftermath of World War II had been annexed by the Soviet Union. The city&#x27;s German inhabitants had been expelled, and the city had been repopulated with Russians and other Soviet citizens and renamed after Mikhail Kalinin, a close ally of Joseph Stalin in the Soviet leadership. &quot;Königsberger Klopse&quot; were jokingly referred to as &quot;Revanchistenklopse&quot;.
Königsberger Klopse are still a popular dish in present-day Germany.
In 2022, it was featured on CNN as one of the best German dishes. 

==Preparation==
The meatballs are made from very finely minced veal, though less expensive beef or pork is often substituted, along with onions, eggs, a few (white) bread crumbs, and spices, chiefly white pepper. The traditional recipe uses anchovy. If herring is substituted, the dish is called &quot;Rostocker Klopse&quot;. If both anchovy and herring are omitted, it may be generically called &quot;Soßklopse&quot; (sauced meatballs).

The meatballs are carefully simmered in salt water, and the resulting broth is mixed with roux, cream, and egg yolk to which capers are added. A simpler version of the recipe thickens the sauce with flour or starch only, omitting the egg yolk. A refined version uses only egg yolk as a thickener. Capers are an essential ingredient in all these versions.

The dish is traditionally served with beetroot and boiled potatoes or, less often, with rice.

<text>William Knox (17 August 1789 – 12 November 1825) was a Scottish poet. He is known for writing Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s favourite poem, &quot;Mortality&quot; (&quot;O, Why Should The Spirit Of Mortal Be Proud?&quot;), which Lincoln often recited by memory.

==Life==
===Early life and agricultural career===
William Knox was born on 17 August 1789 in the small estate of Firth, in the parish of Lilliesleaf, in the county of Roxburghshire, in southern Scotland. He was the eldest child (of three sons and three daughters) of Thomas Knox, an agricultural and pastoral farmer in Roxburghshire and the neighbouring Selkirkshire, and Barbara Turnbull, the eldest daughter of Walter Turnbull, Esquire of Firth. He was educated first in the parish school of Lilliesleaf (to age 14), then in Musselburgh Grammar School. The Knox family lived in a farm (Todrig) which his mother had inherited when her first husband, also a farmer, died.

From an early age William was considered to have powers of acute observation and steady attention, and a mind keen, active and susceptible of deep impressions. He also had a peculiarly retentive memory. By age 14, he was a good English scholar with a considerable knowledge of Latin. He was also passionately fond of music and liked to draw. At an early age William started writing songs and other poetical pieces, humorous and satirical, chiefly in the Scottish dialect. After his return from Musselburgh to Firth to assist his father, poetry became more than just an amusement for him.

In 1812 he leased the farm of Wrae, near Langholm, Dumfriesshire, and farmed unsuccessfully - mainly due to the lack of a capital needed to render the farm sufficiently productive - from 1812 to 1817; then he turned to writing poems, encouraged by both Christopher North and Sir Walter Scott.

Despite having farmed for only five years, he earned the approbation of the intelligent agriculturists in Dumfriesshire, who considered Knox as a man well fitted to excel as a farmer. He was greatly esteemed and highly praised by all of his neighbours: for his generosity as a man and for his worth as a friend. During his farming years, Knox never lost his interest in poetry and literature. By 1817 - when he ceased farming - William was deeply read in the British poets, both ancient and contemporary. In 1817 he composed the greater number of the pieces contained in his first work, &quot;The Lonely Hearth and other Poems&quot;. By that time he also had become a good literary critic, not only of poetry but also of other English literature, and had exercised his talents in different styles of composition. At about that time, he wrote unpublished poems entitled &quot;The Influence of Love over the other Passions&quot; and &quot;The Father&#x27;s Cottage&quot;.

===Later life===
He wrote several books of poetry: &quot;The Lonely Hearth&quot; (1818); &quot;The Songs of Israel&quot; (1824), which contains &quot;Mortality&quot; (&quot;O, Why Should The Spirit Of Mortal Be Proud?&quot;); &quot;The Harp of Zion&quot; (1825); and latterly was a journalist in Edinburgh.

Both Sir Walter Scott and Professor John Wilson (Christopher North) of Edinburgh, had a high opinion of Knox as a man and as a poet with &quot;fascinating conversational powers and general literary information&quot;. In the year 1820 Knox moved to Edinburgh. From then until shortly before his death many of his small works of prose and verse appeared in various periodicals. He was a frequent contributor to the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot;. He wrote a Christmas tale entitled &quot;Marianne or the Widower&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and also &quot;A Visit to Dublin&quot;.

At the beginning of 1823 he visited his brother Walter in Ireland, and remained there for about twelve months. During that visit he composed &quot;The Songs of Israel&quot;, published soon after his return to Edinburgh in 1824. His next and last publication was &quot;The Harp of Zion&quot;, published in April 1825 and written only a few months before its publication.

The memory of William Knox was so powerful that once, when a bookseller mislaid the manuscript of &quot;The Harp of Zion&quot;, he is said to have sat down and in two or three days re-written the whole poem from his recollection (the only trouble it cost him being the manual labour). He scarcely ever altered the first draft of his compositions, as he believed that the first draft was generally the best.

Robert Southey, a Romantic English poet and Poet Laureate from 1813 until 1843, wrote to Knox on 19 August 1824: 

&quot;“Your little volume has been safely delivered to me by your friend Mr G. Macdonald, and I thank you for it. It has given me great pleasure. To paraphrase sacred poetry is the most difficult of all tasks, and it appears to me that you have been more successful in the attempt than any of your predecessors. You may probably have heard that the Bishop of Calcutta ... was engaged in forming a collection of hymns and sacred pieces, with the hope of having them introduced into our English churches. Some of yours are so well adapted to that object that I will send out a copy of your book to him. … I cannot but wish that talents and feelings such as yours were employed in the ministry of the gospel, where you would find your happiness in the performance of your duty – you are young enough to think of this.”&quot;
William Knox suffered a stroke, and died three or four days later in Edinburgh on 12 November 1825. He is buried in the New Calton Cemetery in its upper east section.

==&quot;O, Why Should The Spirit Of Mortal Be Proud?&quot;==

The poem &quot;“O, Why Should The Spirit Of Mortal Be Proud?”&quot; was a particular favorite of Abraham Lincoln. American painter F. B. Carpenter wrote that while he was engaged in painting his large picture at the White House, he was alone one evening with the president in his room when President Lincoln said:

&quot;&quot;There is a poem, which has been a great favorite with me for years, which was first shown to me when a young man, by a friend, and which I afterwards saw and cut from a newspaper, and learned by heart. I would,” he continued, “give a great deal to know who wrote it, but I have never been able to ascertain.”&quot;

<text>William Laidlaw (1780–1845) was a Scottish poet. The son of a border farmer, he became steward and amanuensis to Walter Scott, and was the author of a well-known ballad, &quot;Lucy&#x27;s Flittin&quot;.

==Life==
He was born 19 November 1780, at Blackhouse, Selkirkshire, where his father was a sheep-farmer. After receiving an elementary education at Peebles he assisted his father for a time. James Hogg, whose mother was his distant cousin, was employed at Blackhouse for ten years, and formed a lasting friendship with Laidlaw.

In 1801, Hogg and Laidlaw helped Scott with materials for the &quot;Border Minstrelsy&quot;. After two unsuccessful attempts at farming, in Peeblesshire and Midlothian, Laidlaw in 1817 became steward to Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford. In 1819, when Scott was recovering from an illness, Laidlaw and Ballantyne wrote to his dictation most of &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot;, and subsequently &quot;A Legend of Montrose&quot;, and nearly all &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;. &quot;St. Ronan&#x27;s Well&quot; may have been due to Laidlaw&#x27;s suggestion that Scott should devote a novel to &quot;Melrose in July 1823&quot;, according to John Gibson Lockhart.

Scott suffered financial ruin; but after an interval, Laidlaw again became his amanuensis, retaining the post till Scott&#x27;s death in 1832. Subsequently he was factor to Sir Charles Lockhart-Ross, 8th Baronet, at Balnagowan, Ross. Retiring in poor health, he died in the house of his brother at Contin, near Dingwall, 18 May 1845.

==Works==
Laidlaw is remembered only for his tender song, &quot;Lucy&#x27;s Flittin&quot;, published in Hogg&#x27;s &quot;Forest Minstrel&quot;, 1810. After 1817 he compiled, under Scott&#x27;s management and direction, part of the &quot;Edinburgh Annual Register&quot;, and contributed articles to the &quot;Edinburgh Monthly Magazine&quot;. He is also said to have written on the geology of Selkirkshire.
The University of Glasgow has posted the poem in its entirety.

<text>Hodan Nalayeh Secondary School, formerly Vaughan Secondary School, is a public secondary school in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. It opened in 1989 by the York Region Board of Education and is currently overseen by the York Region District School Board.

The school was originally named after the City of Vaughan, which was named after Benjamin Vaughan. After complaints that Benjamin Vaughan had associations with slavery, the York Region District School Board renamed this school in honour of Hodan Nalayeh, a Somali-Canadian journalist. 
The school services a very diverse and multicultural community. Its motto is &quot;Ficta Fiunt Res Gestae&quot; (Turning dreams into action).

==History==
Vaughan Secondary School was officially opened in 1989 by the York Region Board of Education and consists of three floors of classrooms and portables. 

With district reorganization in 2006, a number of regions previously associated with Vaughan Secondary School were reassigned to Stephen Lewis Secondary School (Block 10). Students entering Grade 9 and 10 in 2006 residing in Block 10 were transferred from Vaughan Secondary School to Stephen Lewis Secondary School. This reorganization reduced Hodan Nalayeh Secondary School&#x27;s student body from about 2,000 students to about 1,100 students.

In September 2020, the York Region District School Board voted to have the name Vaughan removed from its name for historical links to slavery. The school renaming comes after the murder of George Floyd months prior and had been named after the city in which it is located, which in turn was named after Benjamin Vaughan, a British Parliamentarian who owned Jamaican slaves and was once an opponent of abolitionism. As a result, the school was temporarily named &quot;Secondary School&quot;.

In March 2021, the school was officially renamed to Hodan Nalayeh Secondary School after Somali-Canadian media executive Hodan Nalayeh, who was murdered in Somalia in 2019 in the Asasey Hotel attack.

<doc id="1095738" wikidata="Q3281696" url="?curid=1095738" title="Malcolm Laing">
<text>Malcolm Laing (1762 – 6 November 1818) was a Scottish historian, advocate and politician.

==Life==
He was born to Robert Laing and Barbara Blaw at the paternal estate of Strynzia or Strenzie, on Stronsay, Orkney; Samuel Laing and Gilbert Laing Meason were his brothers. He attended the grammar school in Kirkwall, and was a student at Edinburgh University. He joined the Speculative Society in 1782.

In 1785 Laing was admitted advocate, and from 1789 for five years was advocate for poor litigants. During 1790 he was working on the electoral roll in Orkney, in the Whig interest. In 1794, with Adam Gillies, he defended Joseph Gerrald in his sedition case. Sir James Mackintosh, a friend, regarded Laing&#x27;s delivery as far too fast, and an impediment to his legal career; Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn commented quite positively on his &quot;hard, peremptory, Celtic manner and accent&quot;.

Laing signed the declaration of the Society of Friends of the People in 1794, and joined the Whig Club. A personal friend of Charles James Fox, he was one of a group of advisers of Fox during the first years of the 19th century on his work of British history, with William Belsham, Samuel Heywood and James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale. He was Member of Parliament for Orkney and Shetland from 1807 to 1812, brought in by the Ministry of All the Talents.

In 1808 Laing suffered a breakdown, and withdrew from public life. He introduced merino sheep on the islands of Eday and Sanday, purchasing a flock from Tweeddale that had belonged to Sir James Montgomery, 1st Baronet. At the end of his life he tried to introduce the brown hare.

==Works==

===History===
Laing finished Robert Henry&#x27;s &quot;History of Great Britain&quot; with a final volume in 1793, and wrote a &quot;History of Scotland from the Union of the Crowns to the Union of the Kingdoms&quot; (1800). In a second edition of the &quot;History&quot; in 1804 half the work was devoted to a &quot;Dissertation on the participation of Mary Queen of Scots in the Murder of Darnley&quot; and the Casket Letters, hostile to Mary, Queen of Scots. Like George Brodie and Ebenezer Marshal, Laing dwelled on negative feudal and other features of early modern Scottish history. In 1804 also Laing edited &quot;The Historie and Life of King James the Sext&quot;.

By modern standards, Laing erred by endorsing a &quot;Scottish Gothic&quot; theory of the Picts: that this founding group of the Kingdom of Scotland were not Celts, but had a Teutonic origin. He endorsed the views of John Pinkerton on the matter, as did John Jamieson and James Sibbald.

===Ossian critic===
In 1805 Laing published in two volumes &quot;Poems of Ossian, containing the Poetical Works of James MacPherson in Prose and Verse, with Notes and Illustrations&quot;. It contained juvenilia by James Macpherson, collector of the Ossian poems, who had died in 1796. It also described how they might be dependent on modern sources that had been borrowed. Laing&#x27;s flawed criticism was seminal for a far fetched theory that Macpherson had used Robert Lowth&#x27;s study of Hebrew verse to construction his own alleged translations.

For Charles James Fox, as explained in a letter to Laing, Macpherson was in the ranks of politically mischievous historians, led by David Hume and his &quot;A History of England&quot;. Others they attacked were Sir John Dalrymple, 4th Baronet and Thomas Somerville. The underlying issue was Tory and Jacobite revisionism of the fabricated Whig historical narrative.

The &quot;Ossian debate&quot;, on the poems&#x27; authenticity to supposed ancient sources, was coming to a head that year. Via Robert Anderson, Laing claimed he was in possession of a confession by Macpherson of the complete fabrication to another party, Sir John Elliott, who had mentioned it to Thomas Percy. On the other hand, the &quot;Report of the Highland Society&quot; (1805) upheld the authenticity claims. Percy took the eirenic view that the blame game, at least, should cease.

==Family==
On 10 September 1805 Laing married Margaret Dempster Carnegy, daughter of Thomas Carnegy of Craigo and Mary Gardyne. Margaret&#x27;s sister was married to Adam Gillies, Lord Gillies.

<text>William Ros or Roos, 1st Baron Ros of Helmsley (c. 1255 – 6 or 8 August 1316), was one of the claimants of the crown of Scotland in 1292 during the reign of Edward I.

==Family==
William Ros was the eldest son of Robert de Ros (d. 17 May 1285) of Helmsley, Yorkshire, and Isabel d&#x27;Aubigny (c. 1233 – 15 June 1301), daughter and heiress of William d&#x27;Aubigny of Belvoir, Leicestershire, and granddaughter of William d&#x27;Aubigny. He had four brothers and three sisters:

*Sir Robert Ros of Gedney, Lincolnshire.
*John Ros.
*Nicholas Ros, a cleric.
*Peter Ros, a cleric.
*Isabel Ros, who married Walter Fauconberg, 2nd Baron Fauconberg.
*Joan Ros, who married John Lovel, 1st Baron Lovel, as his second wife.
*Mary Ros, who married William de Braose, 1st Baron Braose.

==Career==
On 24 December 1264, William&#x27;s father, Robert de Ros (d. 1285), was summoned to Simon de Montfort&#x27;s Parliament in London as &quot;Robert de Ros&quot;, and for some time it was considered that the barony was created by writ in that year, and that Robert de Ros was the 1st Baron Ros. According to &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot;:

In 1616, the barony of Ros was allowed precedence from this writ [of 24 December 1264], a decision adopted by the Lords in 1806 (Round, &quot;Peerage and Pedigree&quot;, vol. i, pp. 249-50); but these writs, issued by Simon in the King&#x27;s name, are no longer regarded as valid for the creation of peerages.

Accordingly, the barony is now considered to have been created when William Ros was summoned to Parliament from 6 February 1299 to 16 October 1315 by writs directed &quot;Willelmo de Ros de Hamelak&quot;.

William Ros succeeded to the family honours and estates on the death of his mother. He was an unsuccessful competitor for the crown of Scotland, founding his claim on his descent from his great-grandmother, Isabel, a bastard daughter of William I of Scotland. He was buried at Kirkham Priory. He was involved in the wars of Gascony and Scotland. He discovered that his kinsman Robert de Ros, Lord of Werke, intended to give up his castle to the Scots. William notified the king of this, who sent him with a thousand men to defend that place. The place was then forfeited because of the treason of Robert de Ros. William Ros then took possession of it. William was appointed warden of the west Marches of Scotland.

Through his marriage to Maud de Vaux, the patronage of Penteney and Blakeney Priories in Norfolk and of Frestun in Lincolnshire came into the Ros family.

==Marriage and issue==
William Ros married before 1287 Maud de Vaux (born c. 1261), younger daughter and coheiress of John de Vaux, by his 2nd wife, Sibyl, by whom he had four sons and four daughters.

*William Ros, 2nd Baron Ros.
*Sir John Ros (d. before 16 November 1338), who married Margaret de Goushill (d. 29 July 1349).
*Thomas Ros.
*George Ros.
*Agnes Ros, who married firstly Sir Pain de Tibetot, and secondly Sir Thomas de Vere.
*Alice Ros, who married Sir Nicholas de Meinill. Their daughter, Elizabeth de Meinill, married Sir John Darcy, 2nd Lord Darcy of Knayth.
*Margaret Ros.
*Lucy Ros.

<text>Abdagases I (Greek: Ἀβδαγάσης, epigraphically ΑΒΔΑΓΑΣΟΥ; Kharosthi: 𐨀𐨬𐨡𐨒𐨮 &#x27;,&#x27;) was an Indo-Parthian king, who ruled Gandhara and possibly over most of the Indus region from c. 46 to 60 AD. He was a nephew and successor of Gondophares, who had laid foundations for the Indo-Parthian kingdom after revolting against his Arsacid overlords in c. 19 AD. Abdagases was succeeded by Orthaghnes or Pacores.

== Life ==
Abdagases&#x27; origins are unknown. It has been argued that he belonged to the House of Suren, a prominent and influential family within the Arsacid Empire. Because the title Gondophernes has been attributed to that dynasty without sufficient proof. But no other proof related to this argument has been found. He succeeded his uncle Gondophares as the ruler of Gandhara in c. 46 AD, whilst Orthagnes succeeded him at Drangiana and Arachosia. The figure of Abdagases is obscure; according to Gazerani, it is likely that Abdagases may have been the same person as another Abdagases, an influential and powerful Suren noble in the Arsacid Empire, who belonged to a faction of Parthian magnates that were dissatisfied with the Parthian king Artabanus II. The Parthian magnates had at first favoured a grandson of Phraates IV, also named Phraates as a better choice for king. However, he met an abrupt death in Syria. The Parthian magnates then turned to another prince, Tiridates III, who was crowned by Abdagases.

Some of the Parthian magnates, however, were supporters of Artabanus II, due to their concern that Abdagases would become the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the Arsacid Empire, with Tiridates as a figurehead. As a result, Abdagases and his son Sinnacus withdrew their support from Tiridates as well. This event seems to have coincided with the declaration of independence in Sakastan by the Suren family under Gondophares. The identification of the two Abdagases figures, although supported by some scholars, nevertheless still remains indecisive, due to the lack of numismatic evidence. Abdagases ruled as king till c. 60 AD, and was succeeded by Orthagnes or Pacores.

<text>Suwarrow (also called Suvorov, Suvarou, or Suvarov) is an island in the northern group of the Cook Islands in the south Pacific Ocean. It is about south of the equator and north-northwest of the capital island of Rarotonga.

==Geography==

Suwarrow is a roughly quadrilateral-shaped coral atoll, in circumference, with over 20 small islets (motu) surrounding a central lagoon . Cyclones often create storm surges which sweep over the atoll since its small component of land is extremely low-lying.

===Table of Islets===
== History ==
Although Suwarrow was inhabited by Polynesians during prehistory it was uninhabited when discovered by the Russian-American Company ship &quot;Suvorov&quot;, which reportedly followed clouds of birds to the atoll on 17 September 1814. (The ship was named after Russian general Alexander Suvorov, who appears as &quot;Suwarrow&quot; in Lord Byron&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Don Juan&quot; and also in Alaric Alexander Watts&#x27; alliterative poem &quot;The Siege of Belgrade&quot;.) It has been only intermittently inhabited since. The atoll″s name has also been spelled variously as Souvorow, Souwaroff, and Souworoff. &quot;Suwarrow&quot; is the official spelling adopted by New Zealand.

In the mid-19th century (records dispute whether it was in 1848 or 1855), a ship from Tahiti was carrying out salvage work when a box containing NZ$15,000 worth of coins was dug up. Some years later, New Zealander Henry Mair found pieces of eight in a turtle nest. Mair became involved in a dispute, the find was covered up, and it has never been rediscovered.

John Lavington Evans was the first lessee of Suwarrow, who passes his lease to the Pacific Islands Trading Company Limited. Evans remained as the superintendent of the company&#x27;s operations in the Pacific. In 1867, Captain Handley B. Sterndale was engaged by the company and sailed with Evans from Melbourne, Australia to the Cook Islands (then known as the Harvey Group). While one ship was lost off the reef of Rarotonga, on 16 October 1867, Sterndale, Evans and 18 men, 2 women and 3 children (who had been engaged in Rarotonga), arrived at Suwarrow where they intended to stay and gather pearl shell, beche-de-mer and copra. Sterndale and the islanders were landed along with approximately 4 months supply of food and a water condensing apparatus to produce fresh water. Evans departed on the ship, with the expectation of returning within 4 months with food supplies. By the middle of March 1868, the provisions were exhausted and Evans had not returned. On 17 April Captain Bully Hayes (the notorious blackbirder) arrived on the brig &quot;Rona&quot;, with 109 islanders from Niue (then known as Savage Island) who were being transported to Tahiti. Hayes agreed to rescue Sterndale and the islanders, notwithstanding the &quot;Rona&quot; was already crowded, with Sterndale and the Islanders being delivered to Rakahanga (Reirson island), from where they eventually were able to travel to Tahiti. Sterndale sold the pearl shell, beche-de-mer, copra and equipment to Hayes. Sterndale later discovered that Evans had travelled to Samoa and sold the ship and departed to Sydney, and concealed that Sterndale and the islanders were on Suwarrow with a limited supply of provisions and no boats capable of leaving the island.

In 1876 the atoll was leased to Henderson and Macfarlane of Auckland, which built a wharf, installed a light on a wooden pyramid, and commenced to gather mother of pearl. The firm&#x27;s agent, Handley B. Sterndale, in 1877 enacted a dubious transfer to his colleague William J. Hunt, who in turn offered in 1886 to sell the island to Russia. British sovereignty was proclaimed 22 April 1889. In 1903 the atoll was leased to Lever Brothers, &quot;for the purpose of removing guano or other fertilising substances therefrom, and of planting the land with coconuts, and for collecting pearl-shells, and for other purposes of a like nature.&quot; They maintained about thirty persons on the island until a cyclone in 1914 so severely damaged operations that the island was abandoned.

In April 1890 Robert Louis Stevenson, his wife Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson, and her son Lloyd Osbourne were passengers on the trading steamer &quot;Janet Nicoll&quot;, which called at Suwarrow during a trading cruise around the central Pacific. The journal of Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson was published under the title &quot;The Cruise of the&quot; Janet Nichol. Jack Buckland was also a passenger on &quot;Janet Nicoll&quot;; he later returned to Suwarrow to be the island trader.

During World War II, Robert Dean Frisbie and several Coastwatchers lived on the largest islet, Anchorage. Frisbie wrote about his experiences in &quot;The Island of Desire&quot;. In 1942, a cyclone washed away 16 of the 22 islets in the atoll. The coastwatchers left a hut with water tanks behind, and left wild pigs and chickens on the islet. Later, cats were allowed to run wild on Anchorage Island, to control Polynesian rats which were documented to occur there since the island was discovered by Europeans (Jones 2001) but conceivably were introduced by Polynesian seafarers a longer time ago.

New Zealander Tom Neale lived alone on Suwarrow for a total of 16 years in three periods between 1952 and 1977. He described his experience in the first two of those periods in &quot;An Island to Oneself&quot; (1966 ). In 1964, while Neale was in Rarotonga, June von Donop, a former accountant from Honolulu, Hawaii, lived alone in his house on Suwarrow for a week, while her crewmates on the schooner &quot;Europe&quot; stayed on board their vessel. Michael Swift lived alone on Suwarrow in 1965–66, but he was not familiar with survival techniques and had a hard time finding sufficient food.

In 1978, the island was declared a National Park of the Cook Islands due to the plentiful marine and bird wild life it supports. The island and surrounding water is Crown land. A proposal to establish an aquaculture operation to farm Tahitian pearls was successfully opposed by Cook Islands environmental NGO, the Taporoporo&#x27;anga Ipukarea Society.

In October 2011, Russian politician Anton Bakov claimed to have purchased the atoll and declared it the capital of a new Russian Empire. The claim was denied by Prime Minister Henry Puna.

== Flora and fauna==
Most of the small islets have only herbs and shrubs, with &quot;Pemphis acidula&quot; and beach heliotrope (&quot;Tournefortia argentea&quot;) growing in abundance. The larger islands have a dense interior vegetation of &quot;Cordia subcordata&quot; (tou); indeed, the westernmost island, Motu Tou is named after this woodland (Jones 2001).

At the end of the 20th century, 3% of all red-tailed tropicbirds in the world (some 400) bred there, as well as 9% of the global population of the lesser frigatebird (about 8500, though only a part of these seem to be present at any one time) (Jones 2001). The atoll has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports, as well as the tropicbirds and frigatebirds, a large breeding colony of sooty terns, with over 40,000 chicks counted in 2008. It is also a non-breeding site for bristle-thighed curlews.

Suwarrow has a rich marine biodiversity, which supports megafauna such as sea turtles, sharks, mantas, and cetaceans including humpback, sperm, and false killer whales.

==Demographics==
Every five years, the Cook Islands government advertises for the Suwarrow island nature reserve caretaker position. The position is staffed between April and October by two persons. The caretakers monitor the atoll&#x27;s birdlife. As of 2023, the rangers are no longer customs officials, and check in must occur on one of the main Cook Islands. Previous caretakers have brought their families with them, so the population was significantly higher, but that is not the case today. The barge that brings them also brings six months of supplies such as canned food, and several more rangers that clean the island on the first day and leave the caretakers behind.

The only way to visit the island is with a private yacht or by chartered expedition from Rarotonga, and visitors require permits from the park authorities before being permitted to land.

<text>William Ros, 2nd Baron Ros of Helmsley, sometime spelled William Roos (c. 1285 – 3 February 1343) was the son of William Ros, 1st Baron Ros and Maud de Vaux.

==Biography==
As 2nd Baron Ros of Helmsley, Werke, Trusbut &amp; Belvoir, he was summoned to Parliament during the reigns of Edward II and Edward III of England. In 1321 he completed the religious foundation which his father had begun at Blakeney. He was created Lord Ross of Werke. He was appointed Lord High Admiral and was one of the commissioners with the Archbishop of York, and others, to negotiate peace between the king and Robert de Bruce, who had assumed the title of king of Scotland.

William Ros was buried at Kirkham Priory, near the great altar.

==Family==
William Ros married, before 25 November 1316, Margery Badlesmere (c.1306 – 18 October 1363), eldest daughter of Bartholomew Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, with Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas de Clare, with whom he had two sons and three daughters:

*William, who succeeded his father as Baron.
*Thomas, who succeeded his brother as Baron.
*Margaret, who married Sir Edward de Bohun.
*Maud, who married John de Welles, 4th Baron Welles.
*Elizabeth, who married William la Zouche, 2nd Baron Haryngworth.

Maud survived her husband by many years and was one of the very few English people present at the Jubilee, at Rome, in 1350; the king had tried to prevent the attendance of his subjects at this ceremony on account of the large sums of money usually taken out of the kingdom on such occasions.

<doc id="1095771" wikidata="Q980488" url="?curid=1095771" title="Teddy Atlas">
<text>Theodore A. Atlas Jr. (born July 29, 1956) is an American boxing trainer and fight commentator.

==Early life==
The son of a doctor, Atlas grew up in a wealthy area of Staten Island, New York City, New York. His mother, Mary Riley Atlas, was a former contestant in the Miss America pageant system, as well as a model. His father was of Hungarian Jewish ancestry and his mother of Irish descent. Atlas was raised in his mother&#x27;s Catholic faith and spent summers in Spring Lake, New Jersey, with his family&#x27;s friends.

By his own admission, Atlas had a somewhat troubled, rebellious youth. He dropped out of school and was arrested several times. He participated in an armed robbery and served time on Rikers Island. Atlas was involved in a street fight in Stapleton, Staten Island, in which his face was severely slashed with a &quot;007&quot; pocketknife. The wound took 400 stitches in total to close, with 200 on the outside of his face and 200 on the inside. The attack left him with a distinctive scar.

==Career==
===Boxing trainer===
Atlas trained as an amateur boxer with Hall of Fame trainer Cus D&#x27;Amato. He had some amateur fights and won a 135-pound Golden Gloves title but had to turn to work as a trainer due to a back injury. Atlas was an assistant to D&#x27;Amato, although his role in the Catskill Boxing Club was short-lived. In 1980 he trained Sweden Olympic Boxing Team for 1980 Summer Olympics. His duties included assisting in the training of D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s teenage protégé Mike Tyson. However, Atlas left the camp in 1982 following an altercation with the 15-year-old Tyson after Tyson had been sexually inappropriate with an 11-year-old female relative of Atlas&#x27; (Tyson said he had grabbed the girl&#x27;s buttocks). Atlas put a .38 caliber handgun to Tyson&#x27;s ear and told him to never touch his family again, or he would kill him if he did. This altercation between Atlas and a young Mike Tyson led to Atlas&#x27; dismissal from the Catskill Boxing Club, and he was told he was no longer welcome in D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s home or around any of his adopted children (his fighters whom he had legally adopted, Tyson included).

Atlas enjoyed his biggest success as head trainer to Michael Moorer, whom he guided to the world heavyweight title in 1994. He drew criticism for what some considered to be overly dramatic speeches in the ring corner, particularly during Moorer&#x27;s heavyweight title fight with Evander Holyfield, and some felt he did this to draw attention to himself rather than help his fighter. During one such speech, Atlas blocked Moorer from sitting on his stool and asked, &quot;Do you want me to take over?&quot; Atlas has denied this, stating that he did what he believed the fighter needed based on his understanding of the fighter. Moorer went on to defeat Holyfield by a majority decision, with Moorer&#x27;s manager John Davimos crediting Atlas&#x27; motivation, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t know if Michael could have done this without Teddy Atlas.&quot;

Atlas also worked the corners of featherweight world champion Barry McGuigan in one fight and light heavyweight Donny Lalonde. Lalonde was a top-ranked boxer and went 8–0 with Atlas as his trainer, but they clashed in temperament and style. &quot;He ran things like an army camp,&quot; Lalonde said, &quot;I&#x27;m more of a free spirit.&quot; Lalonde also said it was a waste of time in his career. He and Atlas parted ways, and Lalonde hired Tommy Gallagher as his new trainer. In his autobiography, Atlas claimed he was so angry at having been fired by Lalonde that he went to Lalonde&#x27;s house with a gun intending to kill him. However, Lalonde refuted Atlas&#x27; story, claiming he did not even live at the apartment Atlas described at the time. Lalonde also called Atlas &quot;the least significant of all my trainers throughout my career.&quot;

In 2009, Atlas began training Russian heavyweight Alexander Povetkin as Povetkin prepared for an eventual title match against Wladimir Klitschko. Povetkin was a former world amateur champ and was the number one contender. Atlas said that Povetkin &quot;wasn&#x27;t ready&quot; for Klitschko

In 2015, Atlas returned to training to prepare Timothy Bradley for his welterweight title defense against Brandon Rios. With Atlas in his corner, Bradley knocked out Rios in the ninth round of their fight, which took place on November 7, 2015, in Las Vegas.

In September 2018 Atlas agreed to train Oleksandr Gvozdyk for upcoming fight with Adonis Stevenson on December 1, 2018 in Montreal for WBC and lineal light heavyweight titles.

In 2019, when asked who, in his opinion, was the best overall of the boxers he had trained, he said Wilfred Benítez.

===Sportscasting===

Atlas served as a commentator for ESPN, formerly for ESPN2&#x27;s &quot;Friday Night Fights&quot; and &quot;Wednesday Night Fights&quot; and later for ESPN&#x27;s Premier Boxing Champions fights. On January 25, 2008, Atlas was suspended by ESPN twice, once for threatening a crew member and once (for one week) after confronting the network&#x27;s boxing program director, Doug Loughrey. Atlas accused Loughrey of showing favoritism to certain promoters and matchmakers, who were abusing their ESPN connections by taking fighters from other promoters with promises of potential ESPN dates. In December 2017, Atlas was removed from ESPN&#x27;s live fight coverage after 21 years of ringside commentating following his criticism of the judging in the Manny Pacquiao–Jeff Horn fight. He is in contract until 2020, and continues to provide boxing analysis for ESPN.

In 2001, Atlas won the Sam Taub Award for excellence in boxing broadcasting journalism. Atlas worked as a boxing commentator for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Olympic Games in Sydney (2000), Athens (2004), Beijing (2008), London (2012) and Rio de Janeiro (2016).

Atlas was a contributor on fight doctor Ferdie Pacheco&#x27;s &quot;The 12 Greatest Rounds of Boxing&quot; DVD. In it, he stated that in the first Ali-Liston fight, during the famous &quot;blind round&quot; in which Ali could not see after being hit by Liston&#x27;s gloves which had been smeared in a substance that temporarily blinded Ali, he would have refused to have cut Ali&#x27;s gloves off and would have simply sent him out with the advice to just &quot;run&quot;.

Atlas is also featured as a member of the in-game commentary team on &quot;Fight Night Round 4&quot; and &quot;Fight Night Champion&quot;, alongside Joe Tessitore.

===Other===
In 1989 he was part of the cast and the crew in the film &quot;Triumph of the Spirit&quot; which portrays the story of Salamo Arouch, a Jewish Greek boxer who survived the Holocaust by boxing (over 200 bouts) for the entertainment of German Nazi officers in Auschwitz Concentration Camp. Atlas played the role of Klaus Silber, main antagonist in the movie. He was also a boxing consultant for Willem Dafoe.

==Personal life==

Atlas is married to Elaine, with whom he has two children: Teddy III and Nicole. Teddy III is a scout for the NFLPA Collegiate Bowl.

In 1997, he founded the Dr. Theodore Atlas Foundation to honor the memory of his father. The foundation awards scholarships and grants to individuals and organizations. Atlas published his autobiography, &quot;Atlas: From the Streets to the Ring: A Son&#x27;s Struggle to Become a Man&quot;, in 2006. The book covers many different periods of Atlas&#x27;s life and compares his position as trainer to a role as a father.

==Honors==
Atlas has been inducted into the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Staten Island Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.

<text>Yenko Chevrolet was a Chevrolet dealership located at 575 West Pike Street in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Operating from 1949 to 1982, the dealership is best known for selling customized sports cars during the late 1960s. Referred to presently as &quot;Yenkos,&quot; they are among the most collectible 1960s vehicles.

==History==
Yenko Chevrolet&#x27;s history dates back to 1929, the year Frank Yenko opened a dealership for selling Durant cars. After the Durant company ended in 1932, Yenko opened a Chevrolet dealership in Pennsylvania in Bentleyville in 1934. In 1949, Yenko opened a second Chevrolet dealership in Canonsburg, nearby in the same state.

In 1957, Frank&#x27;s son Don Yenko assumed ownership of the dealership. Known for his modified Chevrolets, Don managed the dealership until 1982, at which time he sold the business.

==Custom Cars==
In 1966, Don Yenko was impressed with the late model Chevrolet Corvair&#x27;s handling, and decided to apply for SCCA approval of the Corsa model for racing. The sanctioning body approved the cars with back seat removed and upgrades to the Corsa engine increasing horsepower and torque. The 100 1966 Corsas that received certification were all painted white and most had blue striping, and were named &quot;Yenko Stingers&quot;.

Yenko continued to modify Corvair coupes as Stingers for the rest of the car&#x27;s production run. The last Stinger was a 1969 coupe, after which Corvair production ceased at Willow Run, Michigan. Charlie Doerge wrote a book on the Yenko Stinger and some of Don&#x27;s escapades in 2011. The book lists many original and subsequent owners, as well as known racing history with much information on all of the cars that were produced. Jay Leno in a video has declared it &quot;the bible for Yenko Stinger owners&quot;.

When Camaros, classifiable as a &quot;pony car&quot;, became available in 1967, Yenko transferred Chevrolet&#x27;s 427 cubic inch (7 L), 425hp (317 kW) L-72 engine (along with other high-performance parts) into some Camaros, creating the Yenko Camaro. The 1967 &amp; 1968 427 Camaros were so popular that, in 1969, Yenko used Chevrolet&#x27;s Central Office Production Order (COPO) system to have L-72 engines installed into Chevrolet Camaros and Chevelles.

During 1971 and 1972, Yenko sold Yenko Stinger Vegas. Based on the Chevrolet Vega GT Hatchback, Stinger Vegas included front and rear spoilers and Yenko Stinger side striping and a special COPO engine with alloy-plated forged aluminum pistons. The modified Vega aluminum-block 2.3 inline 4 with a turbocharger and 155 hp required a 50,000 mile test for EPA certification and Don Yenko eventually decided against using the turbochargers. Chevrolet was not interested in the marketing potential of a Turbo version as neither the Yenko-requested higher-compression engine blocks nor factory equipped turbo engines were ever built. The Stinger Vega was offered from Yenko Chevrolet through 1972 without turbochargers installed, but Yenko did offer the turbochargers as an aftermarket kit.&lt;br&gt; 
The high performance and limited production of all Yenko-modified cars makes them valuable and prized to collectors.

<text>Capital University (Capital, Cap, or CU) is a private university in Bexley, Ohio, United States. Capital was founded as the Theological Seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Ohio in 1830 and later was associated with that synod&#x27;s successor, the American Lutheran Church. The university has undergraduate and graduate programs, as well as a law school. Capital University is the oldest university in Central Ohio and is one of the oldest and largest Lutheran-affiliated universities in North America.

==History==
Capital University was founded on June 3, 1830, as the German Theological Seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Ohio in Canton, Ohio, 40 years before the founding of Ohio State University, making it the oldest university in Central Ohio. It moved to downtown Columbus in 1832. On March 2, 1850, Capital University was chartered. At that time, the denomination was renamed to the Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio and Other States and grew into a nationwide church body. The first president of the university was William Morton Reynolds.

In 1930, the Joint Synod was merged with two other smaller German language groups, the Iowa Synod (formed 1854) and the Buffalo Synod (founded 1845) to create the American Lutheran Church (ALC), headquartered in Columbus. The ALC existed for only three decades, until 1960, when it, in turn, participated in a more extensive merger with the Evangelical Lutheran Church and the United Evangelical Lutheran Church Danish to form The American Lutheran Church. The second ALC lasted until the formation of the current Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) in 1988, with offices in Chicago, Illinois.

The university eventually moved its main campus to the rural periphery of the state capital in the community of Bexley. This rural area has since developed into an upscale suburb. Capital University&#x27;s educational mission is based on Lutheran values of free inquiry, critical thinking, and leadership. A current motto used at the school is &quot;Ask. Think. Lead&quot;, a continuing reminder of its educational mission.

In recognition of several buildings&#x27; historic architectural merit, a portion of the campus was entered on the National Register of Historic Places as the &quot;Capital University Historic District&quot; in 1982. The district comprises Mees Hall, Bexley Hall, the Kerns Religious Life Center (formerly Rudolph Hall), and Leonard Hall. The district initially included Lehmann Hall and Loy Hall, but those two buildings have since been demolished.

In May 2004, the university received approval to close Mound Street between College Avenue and Pleasant Ridge Avenue from the city of Bexley. In 2006, the university constructed a pedestrian mall on the closed portion of Mound Street, including parking, improved lighting, benches, and landscaping. The $2.5 million project unified the northern and southern parts of campus.

Denvy A. Bowman, the university&#x27;s 15th president retired on July 1, 2016, ending his ten-year tenure as president. On February 9, 2016, Elizabeth L. Paul was named as the 16th president of Capital and was the first woman to hold the position at the university; she resigned in 2020 after a no-confidence vote was held amongst faculty and staff. David Kaufman became interim president in June 2020 and was named the 17th president on July 25, 2021.

The seminary, which had been renamed to the Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary, became independent of the university in 1959. It merged with Hamma Divinity School, the theological department of nearby Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio, in 1978 and reopened on the Bexley campus as Trinity Lutheran Seminary, where it continues today as a theological seminary of the ELCA. In the fall of 2016, Capital University and Trinity Lutheran Seminary announced that the two would reunite after 58 years of operating separately. The goal was to complete the reunion plan by the summer of 2017, with implementation to follow over the next two years. The merger was actually completed January 1, 2018.

On July 13, 2020, the university Board of Trustees announced plans to retire the Crusader nickname and the &quot;Cappy&quot; mascot following a 15-month-long study. The university formally adopted &quot;Capital Comets&quot; as the new mascot name on September 30, 2021.

Recently, the university appointed its first female Assistant Dean of the Conservatory of Music.

===WXCU Radio===

The campus radio station, WXCU Radio, is entirely student-run and managed. In 2007, the radio station began streaming online only with an alternative and indie rock format. Students can host their radio show and interview nationally touring acts. Additionally, the station hosts several concerts and also supports the efforts of other groups campus-wide. Participation can be either extra-curricular or for credits. The station takes music submissions and frequently features music produced by students.

===Harry C. Moores Student Union===
During the summer of 2013, the Harry C. Moores Campus Center underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation. Capital University&#x27;s Student Government rededicated the building as the &#x27;Harry C.

The third floor contains many articles and much of the university&#x27;s historical data. The fourth floor is the home to the Schumacher Gallery, which houses a large art collection on campus. The second floor has an extensive music collection, including a vinyl section. Constructed in 1969 and dedicated in March 1971, the library now contains more than 300,000 media articles. The library was named in 1998 for Josiah Blackmore, a well-known legal scholar, and former university president. The first and second floors of Blackmore Library were renovated in Summer 2012.

===Schumacher Gallery===
Schumacher Gallery houses the 502-piece Schreiber-Fox Collection of African Art. Schreiber and Fox donated their collection of African art to Capital University. The Schumacher Gallery&#x27;s permanent collections consist of a diverse selection of more than 2500 works of art for education and enjoyment.

A piece of the Berlin Wall is a popular attraction for visitors and incoming students. Obtained in 1992, the wall was given on a long-term loan from Hansa Consulting, a German-based corporation. On one side is colorful graffiti written during the separation of East and West Berlin, while on the other is blank concrete revealing a few bullet holes, evidence of the confinement of East Berliners. Once housed in the university&#x27;s library, the structure stands outside Huber-Spielman Hall. The concrete wall weighs 2.8 tons.

Bernlohr Stadium is home to the football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, track, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse teams. In 2011, Field turf was reinstalled on the field. The stadium does have a three-lane track. The capacity is around 3,000, with seating and standing room. In the fall of 2012, a new HD LCD scoreboard was revealed. In October 2014, Capital was granted permission to install stadium lights and a new sound system at the stadium by the Bexley Planning Commission. This decision was upheld in January 2015 by the Bexley City Council after residents living near the stadium appealed the planning commission&#x27;s decision.

In the fall of 2016, alumnus Wells Purmort (class of 1958) donated to the university&#x27;s athletic department. Purmort gave a gift of $1 million, which will be used to maintain the turf at the stadium and be used for the eventual replacement of the field. To show its appreciation, the university named the playing surface after him. The stadium is now known as Purmort Field at Bernlohr Stadium.

===Capital Center===
The Capital Center is a 126,000-square-foot recreational and athletic complex that opened in 2001. Located inside is a weight room and cardio workout area open to students.

<text>The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway was a Class I railroad formed in 1869 in Virginia from several smaller Virginia railroads begun in the 19th century. Led by industrialist Collis P. Huntington, it reached from Virginia&#x27;s capital city of Richmond to the Ohio River by 1873, where the railroad town (and later city) of Huntington, West Virginia, was named for him.

== History ==

The C&amp;O traces its origins to the Louisa Railroad of Louisa County, Virginia, begun in 1836. By 1850 the Louisa had been built east to Richmond and west to Charlottesville, and in keeping with its new and larger vision, was renamed the Virginia Central Railroad. The Commonwealth of Virginia owned a portion of Virginia Central stock and financed the Blue Ridge Railroad to accomplish the task of crossing the first mountain barrier to the west. 

During the Civil War the Virginia Central played a key role in several battles but was a target for Federal armies. By 1865 it only had five miles of track still in operation and almost no cash to rebuild. Officials realized that they would have to get capital to rebuild from outside the economically devastated South and succeeded in getting Collis Huntington interested. He supplied the Virginians with the money needed to complete the line through what is now West Virginia. The old Covington and Ohio Railroad properties were conveyed to the C&amp;O in keeping with its new mission of linking the Atlantic Ocean with the “Western Waters” of the Ohio River.

Huntington intended to connect the C&amp;O with his Western and Midwestern holdings, but ended up stopping construction at the Ohio River. Thus the only connection to the West was by packet boats operating on the river. Because the mineral resources of West Virginia and Kentucky hadn’t been fully realized yet, the C&amp;O suffered through the bad times brought on by the financial panic Depression of 1873, and went into receivership in 1878. When reorganized it was renamed The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company. 

Conditions improved in the 1880s when coal resources began to be developed and shipped eastward. In 1881 the Peninsula Extension was completed from Richmond to the new city of Newport News located on Hampton Roads, the East’s largest ice-free port. Transportation of coal to Newport News where it was loaded on coastwise shipping and transported to the Northeast became a staple of the C&amp;O’s business at this time. In 1888 the C&amp;O built the Cincinnati Division from Huntington down the South bank of the Ohio River and across the river at Cincinnati, connecting with the “Big Four” and other Midwestern Railroads. From 1900 to 1920 most of the C&amp;O’s line tapping the rich bituminous coal fields of West Virginia and Kentucky were completed, and the C&amp;O as it was known throughout the rest of the 20th Century was essentially in place. In 1910, the C&amp;O absorbed the Chicago, Cincinnati and Louisville Railroad, which had been built diagonally across the state of Indiana from Cincinnati to Hammond in the preceding decade. This gave the C&amp;O a direct line from Cincinnati to the great railroad hub of Chicago.

The first small terminal and repair shops were located at Richmond beginning in 1860. After expanding to Huntington in 1872, the primary back shops were established on 100 acres of land along Fifth Avenue. These facilities were expanded and modernized over a five year period in three phases beginning in 1916. Another large shop site was established at Clifton Forge, Virginia in 1890 on 1,200 acres of land, including the classification yard. In 1929 the system&#x27;s primary freight car repair and erecting facility was built at the west end of the mammoth yard at Russell, Kentucky, called the Raceland Car Shops. 

By the early 1960s the C&amp;O was headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1972, under the leadership of Cyrus Eaton, it became part of the Chessie System, along with the Baltimore and Ohio and Western Maryland Railway. The Chessie System was later combined with the Seaboard Coast Line and Louisville and Nashville, both the primary components of the Family Lines System, to become a key portion of CSX Transportation (CSXT) in the 1980s.

C&amp;O&#x27;s passenger services ended in 1971 with the formation of Amtrak. Today Amtrak&#x27;s tri-weekly &quot;Cardinal&quot; passenger train follows the historic and scenic route of the C&amp;O through the New River Gorge in one of the more rugged sections of West Virginia. The rails of the former C&amp;O also continue to transport intermodal and freight traffic, as well as West Virginia bituminous coal east to Hampton Roads and west to the Great Lakes as part of CSXT, a Fortune 500 company which was one of seven Class I railroads operating in North America at the beginning of the 21st century.

At the end of 1970 C&amp;O operated of road on of track, not including WM or B&amp;O and its subsidiaries.

==Passenger Operations and the &quot;Chessie&quot; Cat mascot==
The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway never spent lavishly on streamlined passenger trains, or passenger service in general, opting to put most of its resources into moving coal and freight. However, it did have a number of well known passenger trains including the &quot;George Washington&quot;, &quot;Fast Flying Virginian&quot;, &quot;Sportsman&quot;, &quot;Pere Marquette&quot;, and &quot;Resort Special&quot;. While the &quot;George Washington&quot; was the railroad&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Sportsman&quot; (which connected Detroit with Washington, D.C., and Newport News) and the &quot;Resort Special&quot; were also well-traveled trains on the system. Much of the reason for the popularity of C&amp;O&#x27;s passenger trains was because of Chessie, the sleeping kitten, one of the most successful and fondly remembered marketing campaigns ever developed. Chessie was so popular when she debuted in 1933 that the C&amp;O could not keep enough merchandise in stock. 

The C&amp;O mostly focused on passenger trains in the eastern half of its system. Despite connecting to Chicago, the largest rail hub and third largest city in the country, passenger service to it was discontinued in 1933. Trains continued to run as west as Hammond, Indiana, a Chicago suburb, until 1949. It had accessed the city’s Central Station (and previously, Dearborn Station) via the former Chicago, Cincinnati and Louisville Line.

Chessie sported two kittens, Nip and Tuck. During World War II, Chessie&#x27;s &quot;husband&quot; — Peake — (creating the name &quot;Chessie Peak&quot;, as in Chesapeake) was shown with a bandage on his paw as a war veteran returning from military service.

While the kitten was created by the Austrian artist Guido Grünewald, the success of Chessie as a marketing tool is often credited to Lionel Probert, at the time an assistant to the C&amp;O president.

===Chessie System, CSX===

C&amp;O continued to be one of the more profitable and financially sound railways in the United States, and in 1963, under the guidance of Cyrus S. Eaton, helped start the modern merger era by &quot;affiliating&quot; with the Baltimore &amp; Ohio. The two lines&#x27; services, personnel, motive power and rolling stock, and facilities were gradually integrated. Under the leadership of Hays T. Watkins, in 1973 Chessie System was created as a holding company for the C&amp;O, B&amp;O and Western Maryland Railway. In effect, C&amp;O formally adopted a nickname that had been used colloquially for the railroad for several years, after the mascot kitten used in ads since 1933.

Under Watkins&#x27; leadership, Chessie System then merged with Seaboard Coast Line Industries, holding company for Seaboard Coast Line Railroad and several other great railroads of the Southeast (including Louisville and Nashville Railroad, Clinchfield Railroad and others) to form CSX Corporation, with Chessie and SCL as its leading subsidiaries. Watkins became CEO of the merged company.

Over the next five years, the CSX railroads began consolidating into one mega-railroad. The process began when SCL merged its railroads into the Seaboard System Railroad in 1982.

Western Maryland was merged into B&amp;O on May 1, 1983. B&amp;O was merged into C&amp;O on April 30, 1987. Seaboard changed its name to CSX Transportation on July 1, 1986. Finally, C&amp;O merged into CSX Transportation on Aug. 31, 1987. After acquiring 42% of Conrail in 1999, CSX became one of four major railroad systems left in the country.

<text>Frederick Joseph Ricketts (21 February 1881 – 15 May 1945) was an English composer of marches for band. Under the pen name Kenneth J. Alford, he composed marches which are considered to be great examples of the art. He was a Bandmaster in the British Army, and Royal Marines Director of Music. Conductor Sir Vivian Dunn called Ricketts &quot;The British March King&quot;. Ricketts&#x27; frequent use of the saxophone contributed to its permanent inclusion in military bands. His best known work is the &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Ricketts was born on 21 February 1881, the 4th child of Robert and Louisa (née Alford) Ricketts in the Thameside hamlet of Ratcliff, within the parish of Shadwell in London&#x27;s East End. Born within the sound of Bow Bells (the Church of St. Mary-le-Bow in Cheapside), Ricketts had Cockney birthright. His London ancestry can be traced back to the early 18th century: his father was a coal merchant in Ratcliff on the north side of the Thames near Limehouse. On 9 December 1884, a 5th child, Randolph Robjent, was born to the Ricketts family, who, like his elder brother, was to become well known in military musical circles, under the pseudonym Leo Stanley. Ricketts&#x27; father died when he was seven and his mother when he was fourteen.

His early musical training had been on playing the piano and organ and working as a church chorister in the parish church of St. Paul&#x27;s, which still stands today. As a boy living in London&#x27;s East End he would often hear street musicians and bands, including German bands and early Salvation Army bands. Fascinated by the sound of instruments, the orphaned Ricketts determined that the best course for his future would be to join an army band. 

==Enlistment==

Ricketts joined the Royal Irish Regiment in 1895. He was enlisted as a Band Boy. It is generally believed that he lied about his age in order to be accepted, giving 5 March 1880 as the date of his birth. In 1895, Ricketts&#x27; true age would have been 14, certainly from 21 February. After the 1876 investigation into the status of Boy Soldiers, the Army&#x27;s regulations had become more clearly defined. Boys were enlisted from the age of fourteen as musicians, drummers, tailors, shoemakers, artificers, or clerks. It would hardly seem necessary for Ricketts to have added a year to his age but throughout his military service, the adopted date was listed as his birth date. Well-liked, ambitious, and a good student with natural ability, he was proficient enough on cornet within very few months and taken into the regimental band. The band went on postings with the regiment, first to Limerick in Ireland, then to India.

Ricketts used every spare moment to learn to play all the instruments in the band. He was very popular with the regular soldiers because of his piano-playing ability in the various messes, as he was promoted. His first composition at the age of 15 was &quot;For Service Overseas&quot;, which has never been published. As he concluded seven years of man-service, in 1903, the Colonel Commanding the Royal Irish Regiment, and his bandmaster, Mr. J. Phillips, recommended Ricketts for entry into the Student Bandmaster Course at the Royal Military School of Music, (Kneller Hall) in Twickenham, Middlesex. As it was then unusual for a 23-year-old musician to be nominated for Kneller Hall, it is believed that this is proof of his skill.

==Royal Military School of Music==

Ricketts&#x27; two-year course at Kneller Hall began in the summer of 1904. Studies there were rigorous: the first year consisted of a firm grounding in harmony, counterpoint, instrumentation, aural training, composition and arranging, carried out by a graduated senior student. Along with these studies, Student Bandmasters were required to learn the basics and pass playing tests on the five woodwind and five brass instruments normally found in the military band. Moreover, there were various band practices, public summer concerts, plus strict military discipline. The teachers in year two were highly qualified professors in each field, often from the Royal College of Music, or working professionals. This year culminated by sitting competitions in arranging, composition (concert band and brass band), conducting, and church service (conducting and composing organ preludes and psalms). All graduate Student Bandmasters then waited for their &quot;tips&quot; –- their appointments as Warrant Officer Class 1 Bandmasters to one of the line bands. Normally, those who placed highest in the examinations were the first to be appointed, but if there was a top line band which would lose its present bandmaster in several months&#x27; time or even a year, then the Director of Music might hold back the graduate who he felt should have that band. Ricketts excelled at Kneller Hall, but did not win the March Competition. The student who did was W.V. Richards with a March titled &quot;Namur&quot;, the name of a battle honour of the Royal Irish Regiment (Richards was from the Royal Irish Regiment), published in 1908.

Graduating in 1906, so highly was he regarded that Ricketts stayed on at Kneller Hall as chapel organist and assistant to the Director of Music, Lieutenant (later Lieutenant Colonel) Arthur Stretton, for two years. Though the post of School Bandmaster was not initiated until 1949, Ricketts may well have acted in a similar capacity during those two years. In 1929, Kneller Hall introduced an advanced certificate for already qualified bandmasters (though they had to sit another stringent set of exams to obtain it), but it was retroactively awarded to those who were deemed to have previously demonstrated achievement of the higher standard, or had been commissioned prior to 1929. Ricketts was one of those to receive the award, allowing him to use the letters &quot;psm&quot; (pass, school of music) after his name as a military qualification. (It was widely felt among British Bandmasters that the psm exam was also a screen by which those who did not fit the mould for becoming commissioned Directors of Music could be discretely failed on a subject, making them ineligible.)

Ricketts&#x27; younger brother, Randolph, attended the one-year pupil&#x27;s course at Kneller Hall, for advanced training on his instrument, and entered the Student Bandmaster course in 1900. He graduated in 1913 and became bandmaster of the 2nd Battalion, Essex Regiment, where he served until 1925. In 1926, he moved to the Band of the Royal Corps of Signals, remaining with this group until his retirement in 1938. He composed marches and other band music under the pen name Leo R. Stanley.

==Bandmaster==

In 1908, Ricketts was finally given his own band. He was posted as Bandmaster to the Band of the 2nd Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, joining them in the Orange River Colony (formerly the Orange Free State) in what is now the Republic of South Africa. The colonel asked him to write a new regimental march for the Argylls, and he responded with &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, based on two bars of the regiment&#x27;s bugle call. The title and term originated in a journalist&#x27;s description (a &quot;thin red streak tipped with a line of steel&quot;) of the appearance of the red-coated Argylls (under their alternate name of the 93rd Highland Regiment) as they stood before—and repelled- a vastly superior force of Russian cavalry at the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War. This march was not published for general use until 1925.

Ricketts had a desire to compose music. The problem was that it was frowned upon for commissioned officers and warrant officers class 1 to be engaged in commercial activities in the civilian world. The answer for Ricketts was to compose and publish under a pen name. The pseudonym Kenneth J. Alford was constructed from his eldest son&#x27;s name (Kenneth), his own middle name (Joseph) and his mother&#x27;s maiden name (Alford). The first march written under the new pen name was &quot;Holyrood&quot;. In July 1911, the 2nd Battalion and Band of the Argylls were in Edinburgh, performing guard duties at the Palace of Holyroodhouse (the Edinburgh residence of the Monarch) during the coronation-year visit to the Scottish capital of King George V and Queen Mary. Moved to commemorate the occasion, Ricketts sketched the march on the back of an envelope during one of the interminable waits these duties entail. It was published in 1912 by Hawkes and Son of London, the first to bear the Alford sobriquet.

==First World War==

A few weeks before the start of World War I, the 2nd Battalion of the Argylls and the Band were stationed at Fort George in north-east Scotland, nine miles from Inverness. It was here that Ricketts composed his most famous march, &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot;. While there are several speculations of how the march was begun, the most accepted is probably from a note written by Ricketts&#x27; widow to the publishers in 1958.
&quot;While playing golf on the Fort George course, one of the members whistled the first two notes (B flat and G) instead of calling &#x27;Fore!&#x27;, and with impish spontaneity was answered by my husband with the next few notes. There was little sauntering—Moray Firth&#x27;s stiff breezes encouraged a good crisp stride. These little scraps of whistling appeared to &#x27;catch on&#x27; with the golfers, and from that beginning the Quick March was built up&quot;. Was the original whistler the colonel? We&#x27;ll probably never know for certain, but the title Colonel Bogey gives us a clue.

Shortly after hostilities began in August, the adult musicians of most line bands were pressed into service as stretcher bearers and medical orderlies. Ricketts and the Band Boys of the Argylls were posted to the 3rd Battalion (Reserve) in Edinburgh for the duration. During the war Ricketts wrote several marches dedicated to the fighting forces: &quot;The Great Little Army&quot; (1916), &quot;On The Quarter Deck&quot;, &quot;The Middy&quot;, and &quot;The Voice of the Guns&quot; (1917), and &quot;The Vanished Army&quot; (1919) which was subtitled &quot;They Never Die&quot;. By the end of the war the Band Boys had matured into a group considered by many to be the finest regimental band in the British Army. Ricketts was given the unusual honour of being Mentioned in Despatches for Commendable Service.

The 1920s were perhaps the high point for the 2nd Battalion Band. Under Ricketts, they had become a popular fixture in London parks, seaside holiday resorts and everywhere else they performed. In 1925 the Band undertook a six-month tour to New Zealand, where it was the resident band for the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition. It was there that Ricketts wrote &quot;Dunedin&quot; (published 1928), and returning to the United Kingdom aboard the New Zealand Shipping Company&#x27;s S.S. Remuera via the Panama Canal, Ricketts was moved to compose the march &quot;Old Panama&quot; (published 1929). Such was his popularity with the public that when in 1927 Bandmaster Ricketts handed the baton over to his successor, Charles Smart Beat, 15,000 people turned up to wish him well. (Charles Beat was the father of Lieutenant Colonel Duncan Beat, Director of Music of the Scots Guards Band, 1974–1982, and later Director of Music at Kneller Hall, 1982–1988.)

==From Army to Navy==

In 1921, Ricketts&#x27; mentor at Kneller Hall, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Stretton, announced his retirement from the army and as Director of Music at KH. Since Ricketts had sufficient years of service that he could have retired, he was also free to accept any musical appointments, either civilian or military, that were offered. Both Colonel Stretton and senior army officials, impressed by Ricketts&#x27; service record and compositions, felt that he was the best candidate to succeed Stretton, and he was invited to apply for the position. For reasons best known to himself, Ricketts declined.

A possibly contributing factor has emerged: it would seem that Ricketts had held a desire for some time to conduct a band in the Royal Marines, though he held this in confidence. Consequently, in the same year, 1921, when the Royal Marines announced a vacancy for bandmastership of the Band of the Plymouth Division, Ricketts applied, turning down the Kneller Hall application. He was interviewed, and later informed that he was the successful candidateut there but there was a complication: the sitting bandmaster of the RM Plymouth Division Band, P.S.G. O&#x27;Donnell, had applied to become the director of the Grenadier Guards&#x27; Band, vacant because of retirement. O&#x27;Donnell had the support of the Prince of Wales, for whom he had acted as band director on two royal tours. Assuming O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s appointment to the Grenadiers was a mere formality, the Marines had advertised the presumed upcoming vacancy for the Plymouth Division Band, for which Ricketts was approved.

Then an objection was raised by a senior army bandmaster, quoting a piece of military legislation which stated that a member of the Senior Service (Royal Navy and Royal Marines) could not be commissioned into the Army. The objection was upheld, O&#x27;Donnell was blocked from the Grenadier Guards, and Ricketts&#x27; appointment was cancelled. The Kneller Hall vacancy had been filled by Captain Hector Adkins, so Ricketts remained with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders for another six years. To make the conductors of the Royal Marines Bands more satisfied in their positions, in June 1921 King George V decreed that all Royal Marine conductors would be commissioned as directors of music. This was a further incentive for Ricketts to bide his time.

But this 1921 incident reveals much about the character of Ricketts. If he had accepted the army&#x27;s invitation to apply for Kneller Hall, he would have been assured of an immediate commission in the rank of lieutenant, and eventual promotions upward to lieutenant colonel. Such was his dedication to staying with a band that he was willing to forgo the position and prestige that would have come with the appointment to Kneller Hall, instead preferring to accept a position with the Royal Marines as a bandmaster in the rank of Warrant Officer Class 1, exactly the same rank he had held through his 19 years with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. It would appear that for Ricketts service with a band meant more than promotion or position.

In 1927, a Royal Marine vacancy occurred, and Ricketts again applied, was approved, and commissioned a lieutenant in the Royal Marines Band Service on 4 July 1927. He was posted to the Royal Marine Depot, Deal. When the headquarters of the Band Service was transferred to Deal in 1930, Ricketts was posted to the Band of the Plymouth Division, Royal Marines, the principal band of the Royal Marines. Under Ricketts&#x27; direction, this band became world-famous, traveling to Paris and Canada. Before and during World War II they made a series of 78 RPM recordings of Alford marches, which EMI reissued on an LP in 1970, and now available on CD. It was titled &quot;The British March King - Alford conducts Alford&quot;. 

From 1935 to 1939, Ricketts conducted the Plymouth Band on a one-hour biweekly BBC Radio programme, and the band was in constant demand to visit military camps and war production factories throughout the Second World War. The workload at that time put a temporary hiatus to his composing, but he resumed in 1941 with &quot;By Land and Sea&quot; and &quot;Army of the Nile&quot;, and in 1942 with &quot;Eagle Squadron&quot; dedicated to the Americans who were flying with the Royal Air Force. It was to be his final march.

Ricketts was promoted to Brevet Major on 31 December 1938 (an acting rank without the pay grade), and confirmed as a full Major on 4 July 1942.

==Personal life==

While on staff at the Royal Military School of Music, Kneller Hall (1906–1908), Ricketts married Annie Louisa Holmes at the Parish Church of All Saints, Tooting Graveney, south London, on 5 September 1907. Annie (Nan) Holmes came from a musical background, her brother being a partner in the London music publishing house of Walsh, Holmes and Company. Ricketts met his bride-to-be over the counter of the firm&#x27;s shop in Charing Cross Road while buying sheet music. Nan was his greatest fan, often stopping what she was doing (including sleeping) to play an idea on the piano for him or give an opinion on two options for a musical theme. They had six children, Kenneth (born March 1909), Leo (April 1911), Sheila (May 1913), Paula (October 1916), Gordon (October 1918), and José (October 1922).

==Death==
From 1907 until 1930 Ricketts had never spent more than two years in one place, and this made his 14-year stay in Plymouth all the more pleasant. He became well known and well liked as leader of the Band of the Royal Marines. Ricketts retired from the Royal Marines on 1 June 1944 because of ill health and died at his home in Reigate, Surrey, on 15 May 1945, after an operation for cancer. He had given almost 50 years of distinguished service to the Crown.

==Legacy==
Alford&#x27;s marches have been favourably compared to those of John Philip Sousa, both having a thorough grounding in classical music. Although he is best known for his marches, he wrote many other pieces –- hymns, fantasias, humoresques, xylophone solos, and duets. He often combined well-known tunes with new compositions or juxtaposed one with another. His championing of the saxophone played its part in getting the instrument accepted in military bands, and he is also credited with the first arrangements for bagpipes with military band. Like Sousa, he had a remarkable memory and tended to conduct without scores. He had the ear of &#x27;top brass&#x27; and could use it to protect the band, something which was much appreciated. 

A memorial book was presented by a colleague to the Regimental Museum of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders called &quot;A Collection of the Works of F.J. Ricketts&quot;. The Royal Marines Commando Training Centre at Lympstone, Devon, is named &quot;Ricketts Hall&quot;, and the centenary of his birth in 1981 was marked by a series of concerts at the Albert Hall and in Plymouth—the latter triggering a three-column article in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. 

Ricketts was not honoured by the British Establishment, either by being admitted to the Order of the British Empire or the Royal Victorian Order, the personal order of the Monarch, yet he alone established British military music, causing it to be recognized throughout the world.

==List of marches==
* &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (1908) – named after his regiment&#x27;s nickname, acquired in the Crimean War, when &quot;the thin red streak tipped with a line of steel&quot; of the 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot held back the Russian advance. Not published and available to the public until 1925.
* &quot;Holyrood&quot; (1912) – named after the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, commemorating the coronation year visit of King George V and Queen Mary. This march is now the quick march of the RAF Regiment.
* &quot;The Vedette&quot; (1912) – A vedette is a mounted sentry placed in advance of the outposts, a term probably familiar to Ricketts from his time in India but unfamiliar today.
* &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot; (1914) – Whistled notes on a golf course, possibly by the colonel, developed into his most famous march.
* &quot;The Great Little Army&quot; (1916) – commemorating the World War I British soldiers who bore the brunt of everything that was thrown at them, called by the enemy &quot;The Contemptible Little Army&quot;. Recording courtesy of the John Horn High School Wind Symphony.
* &quot;On the Quarter Deck&quot; (1917)
* &quot;The Middy&quot; (1917) – Both this and the previous march were written to commemorate the naval Battle of Jutland in 1916.
* &quot;The Voice of the Guns&quot; (1917) – meant initially to honour British artillery in World War I (hence the name), later it became widely adopted by the British army as a whole. Not to be confused with the poem of the same name by Gilbert Frankau (1916). Featured prominently in the film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962).
* &quot;The Vanished Army&quot; (1918) – dedicated to the memory of the first 100,000 soldiers who perished in World War I. Subtitled &quot;They Never Die&quot;.
* &quot;The Mad Major&quot; (1921) – Major Graham Seton Hutchinson was the Mad Major, whose war exploits had won him the Military Cross and a DSO.
* &quot;Cavalry of the Clouds&quot; (1923) - A salute to the fledgling Royal Air Force.
* &quot;Dunedin&quot; (1928) – named for the Dunedin Exhibition of 1925/26 in New Zealand.
* &quot;Old Panama&quot; (1929) – Ricketts returned from Dunedin by way of the Panama Canal
* &quot;HM Jollies&quot; (1929) – &quot;HM Jollies&quot; is a nickname for the Royal Marines. The march contains snippets of &quot;The Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot;, &quot;A Life on the Ocean Wave&quot;, and &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;.
* &quot;The Standard of St George&quot; (1930) – Inspired by watching Trooping the Colour at Horse Guards Parade. This march was actually featured in the concert programs of the Band of the Royal Marines Depot, Deal, before it was published. The writing of this march is unique in that it does not start with an introduction; the strong first section bursts forth with a telling fanfare figure, below which is a tremendous bass foundation of sustained power for the whole of 32 bars.
* &quot;By Land and Sea&quot; (1941) – This march was modeled on Alford&#x27;s entry into a competition in 1934 for an official slow march for the Royal Marines. The title is the anglicized version of the Royal Marines motto &quot;Per Mare Per Terram&quot; and was written for the Plymouth Division, R.M. which includes a portion of the regimental quick march &quot;A Life on the Ocean Wave&quot; and the Royal Marines Bugle Calls. &quot;By Land and Sea&quot; is a magnificent example of the art of military ceremonial music.
* &quot;Army of the Nile&quot; (1941) – dedicated to General Wavell for halting the advance of the Axis Powers in Egypt Recording courtesy John Horn High School Wind Symphony
* &quot;Eagle Squadron&quot; (1942) – The Eagle Squadron was composed of American pilots in the RAF before America joined in the war. It then transferred to the USAAF. The march quotes &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, &quot;Dixie&quot;, and The &quot;Royal Air Force March Past&quot;.

==Other published works==
* &quot;Valse Riviera&quot; (1912)
* &quot;Thoughts&quot; – waltz (1917)
* &quot;A Musical Switch&quot; – humoresque (1921) 
* &quot;The Two Imps&quot; – xylophone duet (1923)
* &quot;The Lightning Switch&quot; – fantasy (1924)
* &quot;Mac and Mac&quot; – xylophone duet (1928)
* &quot;Wedded Whimsies&quot; – humorous fantasy for piano solo (1932)
* &quot;The Smithy&quot; – pastoral fantasy 1933
* &quot;The Two Dons&quot; – xylophone duet (1933)
* &quot;Colonel Bogey on Parade&quot; – march fantasy (1939)
* &quot;The Hunt&quot; – rhapsody (1940)
* &quot;Lillibullero&quot; (1942) – A march attributed to Henry Purcell, though he probably &quot;borrowed&quot; it. Lillibullero is the official Regimental March of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME). This Corps was established during the Second World War and so the BBC&#x27;s official wartime use of Lillibullero may well have played a part in its selection by REME. It was also the unofficial marching song of the wartime Royal Marine Commandos. Ricketts&#x27; arrangement was used as a signature tune of the BBC radio program about the Commandos, &quot;Into Battle&quot;.
* &quot;A Life on the Ocean Wave&quot; (1944) – In 1882, the Deputy Adjutant General Royal Marines requested that the Bandmaster of each Royal Marine Division (Portsmouth, Plymouth, Chatham) submit an arrangement for a new regimental march for the corps, if possible based on a naval song. Jacob Kappey, the Bandmaster of the Chatham Division, submitted an arrangement of &quot;A Life on the Ocean Wave&quot;, a ballad by Henry Russell, with an eight bar trio from &quot;The Sea&quot; by Sigismund Neukomm. It was authorised for use as the regimental quick march of the Corps of Royal Marines in 1882. It was re-arranged by Major Ricketts in 1944.

<text>Edward William Lane (17 September 1801 – 10 August 1876) was a British orientalist, translator and lexicographer. He is known for his &quot;Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians&quot; and the &quot;Arabic-English Lexicon,&quot; as well as his translations of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; and &quot;Selections from the Kur-án&quot;.

During his lifetime, Lane also wrote a detailed account of Egypt and the country&#x27;s ancient sites, but the book, titled &quot;Description of Egypt,&quot; was published posthumously. It was first published by the American University in Cairo Press in 2000 and has been republished several times since then.

==Early years==
Lane was born at Hereford, England, the third son of the Rev. Dr Theophilus Lane, and grand-nephew of Thomas Gainsborough on his mother&#x27;s side. After his father died in 1814, Lane was sent to grammar school at Bath and then Hereford, where he showed a talent for mathematics. He visited Cambridge but did not enrol in any of its colleges.

Instead, Lane joined his brother Richard in London, studying engraving with him. At the same time, Lane began his study of Arabic on his own. However, his health soon deteriorated. For the sake of his health and of a new career, he set sail to Egypt.

== Work ==
=== Travels in Egypt ===
Lane had a few reasons for travelling to Egypt. He had been studying Arabic for a long period. There had been an explosion of egyptomania in England due to Belzoni&#x27;s exhibition at the Egyptian Hall and the release of Vivant Denon&#x27;s &quot;Travels in Upper and Lower Egypt during the campaigns of General Bonaparte in that country&quot; (1803). Lane&#x27;s health was also deteriorating while living in London and he felt that he needed to migrate to a warmer climate during the harsh winter months. During the 1800s, those who spoke Arabic and were familiar with the Near East could easily apply for jobs serving the British government. Lane set sail for Egypt on 18 July 1825.

Lane arrived in Alexandria in September 1825 and soon left for Cairo. He remained in Egypt for two and a half years, mingling with the locals, dressed as a Turk (the ethnicity of the then-dominant Ottoman Empire), and taking notes of his experiences and observations. In Old Cairo, he lived near Bab al-Hadid, and studied Arabic with Sheikh Muhammad &#x27;Ayyad al-Tantawi (1810–1861), who was later invited to teach at Saint Petersburg, Russia.

In Egypt, Lane visited coffee shops and the houses of locals, attended a mosque, and familiarized himself with Islam. He also befriended other British travelers in Egypt at that time, including John Gardner Wilkinson, who had been residing in Cairo. Lane also went on a trip down the Nile to Nubia, visiting numerous sites and taking observational notes. On this trip he visited Abydos, Dendera, Luxor, Kom Ombo, Philae, Abu Simbel and a number of other ancient sites. Lane left Egypt on 7 April 1828.

==== &quot;Description of Egypt&quot; ====
Lane&#x27;s interest in ancient Egypt may have been first aroused by seeing a presentation by Giovanni Battista Belzoni. His original ambition was to publish an account of what had remained of Ancient Egypt. The London publisher John Murray showed early interest in publishing the project (known as &quot;Description of Egypt&quot; as an homage to the early 1800s publication, &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot;), but then backed out. This rejection was probably due to the fact that the book had detailed accounts of Egypt, numerous illustrations, and texts in Arabic, Ancient Egyptian (hieroglyphics) and Ancient Greek which would significantly raise the cost of printing. Large publications were also going out of fashion and Lane was not himself an established author. Due to financial shortcomings, Lane could not publish the book himself, so it remained unpublished until 2000.

In &quot;Description of Egypt&quot;, Lane provided descriptions and histories of locations within Egypt that he had visited. He was a devout urban geographer, best illustrated by the fact that he devoted five chapters of the book writing about everything in Cairo: the way the city looks when you approach it, a detailed account of Old Cairo, monuments in the city, the nature around it, etc. He also wrote about rural areas.

Lane also discussed the landscape and geography of Egypt, including its deserts, the Nile and how it was formed, Egyptian agriculture, and the climate. An entire chapter of the book was devoted to a political history of Egypt, with specific attention to the history of Muhammad Ali of Egypt.

Lane&#x27;s &quot;Description of Egypt&quot; focuses mainly on Ancient Egypt. Though Lane was not credited as such during his lifetime, his text follows the form of Egyptology. The book included a supplement titled &quot;On the Ancient Egyptians&quot; in which Lane discusses the origin and physical characteristics of Egyptians, the origin of their civilization, hieroglyphics, Ancient Egyptian religion and law, Egyptian priesthood, Egyptian royalty, the caste system, general manners and customs, sacred architecture and sculpture, agriculture, and commerce. In a letter he wrote to his friend Harriet Martineau, Lane stated that he felt the need to put a lot of effort into staying away from Ancient Egypt; he added that in the previous eight years he could not read a book on the subject as it fascinated him so much that it drew his attention away from his work.

Lane spent 32 days at the Giza pyramid complex, drawing, making sketches, and taking notes for his work. At the complex Lane noted that he saw labourers pulling down some of the stone from the Great Sphinx of Giza to use it for modern buildings. He stayed at the Valley of the Kings for 15 days, sleeping in the tomb of Ramses X, and left detailed accounts of each tomb, concluding that there may be further hidden tombs within the Valley.

160 illustrations accompanied Lane&#x27;s accounts.

=== &quot;Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians&quot; ===

Since Lane had trouble publishing his &quot;Description of Egypt&quot;, at the suggestion of John Murray he expanded a chapter of the original project into a separate book. The result was his &quot;Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians&quot; (1836), published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. The work was partly modelled on Alexander Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Natural History of Aleppo&quot; (1756). Lane visited Egypt again in 1833 in order to collect materials to expand and revise the work, after the Society had accepted the publication. The book became a bestseller (still in print), and Lane earned his reputation in the field of Orientalism.

Lane left detailed accounts of everyday life in Egypt in the 19th century, which would prove useful to later researchers. Arthur John Arberry visited Egypt a century after Lane and said that it was like visiting another planet - none of the things Lane had written about were present.

Lane was conscious that his research was handicapped by the fact that gender segregation prevented him from getting a close-up view of Egyptian women - an aspect of Egyptian life that was of particular interest to his readers. He was forced to rely on information passed on by Egyptian men, as he explains:Many husbands of the middle classes, and some of the higher orders, freely talk of the affairs of the ḥareem with one who professes to agree with them in their general moral sentiments, if they have not to converse through the medium of an interpreter. However, in order to gain further information, he would later send for his sister, Sophia Lane Poole, so that she could gain access to women-only areas such as hareems and bathhouses and report on what she found. The result was &quot;The Englishwoman in Egypt: Letters from Cairo, written during a residence there in 1842, 3 &amp; 4, with E.W. Lane Esq., Author of &quot;The Modern Egyptians&quot; By His Sister.&quot; (Poole&#x27;s own name does not appear within the publication.) &quot;The Englishwoman in Egypt&quot; contains large sections of Lane&#x27;s own unpublished work, altered so that it appears to be from Poole&#x27;s perspective (for example &quot;my brother&quot; being substituted for &quot;I&quot;). However, it also relates Poole&#x27;s own experiences in visiting the hareems that were closed to male visitors.

=== &quot;The One Thousand and One Nights&quot; ===
Lane&#x27;s next major project was a translation of the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. His version first saw light as a monthly serial from 1838 to 1840, and was published in three volumes in 1840. A revised edition was released in 1859. The encyclopedic annotations from the first edition were published posthumously and separately in 1883 by his great-nephew Stanley Lane-Poole, as &quot;Arabian Society in the Middle Ages&quot;. Lane&#x27;s version is bowdlerized, and illustrated by William Harvey.

Opinions vary on the quality of Lane&#x27;s translation. Stanley Lane-Poole commented that &quot;Lane&#x27;s version is markedly superior to any other that has appeared in English, if superiority is allowed to be measured by accuracy and an honest and unambitious desire to reproduce the authentic spirit as well as the letter of the original.&quot; Nights researcher and author Robert Irwin writes that Lane&#x27;s &quot;style tends towards the grandiose and mock-biblical... Word order is frequently and pointlessly inverted. Where the style is not pompously high-flown, it is often painfully and uninspiringly literal... It is also peppered with Latinisms.&quot;

Lane himself saw the &quot;Nights&quot; as an edifying work, as he had expressed earlier in a note in his preface to the &quot;Manners and Customs&quot;, There is one work, however, which represents most admirable pictures of the manners and customs of the Arabs, and particularly of those of the Egyptians; it is &#x27;The Thousand and One Nights; or, Arabian Nights&#x27; Entertainments:&#x27; if the English reader had possessed a close translation of it with sufficient illustrative notes, I might almost have spared myself the labour of the present undertaking.

=== Dictionary and other works ===

From 1842 onwards, Lane devoted himself to the monumental &quot;Arabic-English Lexicon&quot;, although he found time to contribute several articles to the journal of Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft. He went to Egypt in 1842 with his wife, two children, and his sister Sophia Lane Poole who was working on her book &quot;The Englishwoman in Egypt&quot;. On this occasion Lane stayed in Egypt for 7 years, working six days a week on his Lexicon. A local scholar, Ibrahim al-Disqui, helped him with this work. Al-Disqui assisted in locating manuscripts and proofreading these manuscripts for Lane. The two became close during this period and continued to stay friends after they finished the Lexicon.

Lane&#x27;s &quot;Selections from the Qur&#x27;an&quot; appeared in 1843. It was neither a critical nor a commercial success. Moreover, it was misprint-ridden as Lane was for the third time in Egypt with his family collecting materials for the &quot;Arabic-English Lexicon&quot; when it was being printed.

Lane was unable to complete his dictionary. He had arrived at the letter Qāf, the 21st letter of the Arabic alphabet, but in 1876 he died at Worthing, Sussex. Lane&#x27;s great-nephew Stanley Lane-Poole finished the work based on his incomplete notes and published it in the twenty years following his death.

In 1854, an anonymous work entitled &quot;The Genesis of the Earth and of Man&quot; was published, edited by Lane&#x27;s nephew Reginald Stuart Poole. The work is attributed by some to Lane.

The part concerning Cairo&#x27;s early history and topography in &quot;Description of Egypt&quot;, based on Al-Maqrizi&#x27;s work and Lane&#x27;s own observations, was revised by Reginald Stuart Poole in 1847 and published in 1896 as &quot;Cairo Fifty Years Ago&quot;.

== Criticism ==

Lane has been criticized for his particularly unsympathetic description of Egypt&#x27;s Coptic Christian minority, drawn in part from the words of an Egyptian man who presented himself to Lane as a Copt, although other scholars have reported that the interlocutor was, in fact, a Muslim. In his writings, he describes Copts as &quot;of a sullen temper, extremely avaricious, and abominable dissemblers; cringing or domineering according to circumstances. Scholars such as S.H. Leeder have described &quot;a great deal of the morbid prejudice against the Copts&quot; as being inspired by the writings of Lane.

== Personal life ==
Lane was from a notable Orientalist family. His sister, Sophia Lane Poole, was an Oriental scholar, as was his nephew Reginald Stuart Poole. His brother, Richard James Lane, was a notable Victorian-era engraver and lithographer known for his portraits. In 1840, Lane married Nafeesah, a Greek-Egyptian woman who had originally been either presented to him or purchased by him as a slave when she was around eight years old, and whom he had undertaken to educate. In 1867, after the death of his sister&#x27;s son Edward Stanley Poole, she and Lane raised his three orphaned children, a daughter and two sons, Stanley Lane-Poole (also an orientalist and archaeologist) and Reginald Lane Poole (a historian and archivist).

Lane died on 10 August 1876 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. His manuscripts and drawings are in the archive of the Griffith Institute, University of Oxford.

<text>John Langhorne was an English clergyman, poet, translator, editor and author. He was born in March 1735 in Winton, a village in the former Westmorland, now the Eden District of Cumbria:
::In Eden&#x27;s vale where early fancy wrought
::Her wild embroidery on the ground of thought. 
He died on 1 April 1779, in Blagdon, Somerset.

==Life==
John Langhorne&#x27;s father was also a clergyman and died when his son was four. His mother made sure he had a school education, first in Winton village and then in Appleby, but there were not sufficient funds to send him to university. From the age of 18, he supported himself by teaching at various places in Yorkshire and finally was appointed tutor to the nine sons of Robert Cracroft at Hackthorn Hall in Lincolnshire. Having taken deacon&#x27;s orders, he left in 1761 and, after a curate&#x27;s appointment in Dagenham, became curate and lecturer at St. John&#x27;s, Clerkenwell in 1764, and was appointed assistant preacher at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn at the end of the following year.
Langhorne now began to put his literary talents to use, particularly as a reviewer for the &quot;Monthly Review&quot;, where his sarcastic style earned him many enemies. He was more generous in the case of William Collins, whose poetry at that period was largely disregarded. Langhorne brought out a first edition of his collected poems in 1765, subsequent re-editions of which eventually helped establish Collins&#x27; reputation. Then in 1766 Langhorne brought out his own &quot;Poetical Works&quot; and that same year became rector of Blagdon. Now at last he was in a position to marry Ann Cracroft, with whom he had been corresponding since his employment at Hackthorn Hall, but she died giving birth to a son - John Theodosius Langhorne - on 4 May 1768.
Following his wife&#x27;s death, Langhorne left Blagdon to stay for a while with his elder brother William at Folkestone. There they made their joint translation of Plutarch&#x27;s Lives (published in 1770) with such success that it was frequently reprinted. In 1772 Langhorne was married for the second time to Isabella Thomson, the daughter of a Westmorland magistrate, but she too was to die on the birth of her first child (a daughter, Isabella Maria Constantia) in 1776. But in other ways his fortunes were rising. He was made a justice of the peace and at the suggestion of a fellow magistrate began work on his most substantial poem, &quot;The Country Justice&quot;, published in three parts between 1774-7. Then in 1777 he was installed as a prebendary of Wells Cathedral but died at the age of 45 two years later.

==Writing==
John Langhorne wrote with great diligence and produced a large number of works in both prose and verse which were much read at the time but very quickly went out of fashion again. His poetry was summed up by a later writer as characterised by &quot;a delicious sweetness, an harmonious flow of diction, tender and lovely sentiment, and a pathos, mild, delicate, graceful and elegant.&quot;. But even friendly writers had to admit that &quot;his chief faults are redundant decoration and an affectation of false and unnecessary ornament&quot;. On account of this, his literary and political enemies made of him a new candidate for inclusion in Alexander Pope&#x27;s satire &quot;The Dunciad&quot;. In Charles Churchill&#x27;s &quot;The Candidate&quot;, Langhorne is characterised as &quot;simple in his lay&quot; and a sleeping partner &quot;with Dullness on her throne&quot;. Hugh Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Thespis&quot; condemns his &quot;recreant name/ to drive with Flecknoe down the sink of fame&quot;. His heavy drinking was also frequently mentioned.

Two of Langhorne&#x27;s works in particular were singled out later for praise. The &quot;Fables of Flora&quot; (1771) have the novel approach of using interactions between plants to deliver moral lessons, although there are rare precedents in Aesop&#x27;s Fables, of which the best-known example is &quot;The Oak and the Reed&quot;. Langhorne&#x27;s floral debates, however, are related at greater length with overwrought and often ludicrous imagery:
::Where prostrate vales, and blushing meads,
::And bending mountains own his sway,
::While Persia&#x27;s lord his empire leads
::And bids the trembling world obey,
::While blood bedews the straining bow,
::And conquest rends the scatter&#x27;d air.

Turning to &quot;The Country Justice&quot;, Robert Chambers accounts it to be &quot;the only poem of Langhorne&#x27;s which has a cast of originality…He seems to have anticipated George Crabbe in painting the rural life of England in true colours.&quot; William Wordsworth also praised the poem enthusiastically for the way it &quot;brought the Muse into the company of common life&quot;.

Wordsworth might well be impressed, since that agenda was his own. Another critic, however, sees Langhorne as anticipating something of Wordsworth&#x27;s nature mysticism too, as it is foreshadowed in his &quot;Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey&quot;. In the same spirit, Langhorne&#x27;s &quot;Inscription on the door of a study&quot; exhorts the reader to go out of doors instead and seek what can be learned &quot;in yonder grove&quot;:
::If Religion claims thy care,
::Religion, fled from books, is there.
::For first from Nature&#x27;s works we drew
::Our knowledge and our virtue too. 
It is in performances like these that we find the value of the transitional poets of the second half of the 18th century as they abandon Augustan models for their own resources.

<doc id="1095809" wikidata="Q3525056" url="?curid=1095809" title="Thomas Dick Lauder">
<text>Sir Thomas Dick Lauder of Fountainhall, 7th Baronet, FRSE FSA (Scot) LLD (13 August 178429 May 1848) was a Scottish author. He served as Secretary to the Board of Manufactures (1839–), on the Herring Fisheries Board, at the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts, and as Deputy Lieutenant of both counties of Moray and Haddington.

He was the only son of Sir Andrew Dick-Lauder, 6th Baronet, whom he succeeded in 1820.

==Early life==
Lauder was born in Edinburgh on13 August 1784, the son of Elizabeth (née Brown) and Sir Andrew Lauder, 6th Baronet of Fountainhall. He was baptised 8 days later at Pencaitland, near the family&#x27;s East Lothian seat, Fountainhall. In early life he entered the army – 79th (The Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders) Regiment of Foot, and although possessing Fountainhall he afterwards took up his residence at his wife&#x27;s home, &#x27;Relugas&#x27; in Morayshire, where he remained till 1832 (selling it in 1836), when he removed to the Grange House, in the Grange, Edinburgh until his death.

In 1839 Sir Thomas was appointed Secretary to the Board of Manufactures and Fisheries in Scotland, and also, immediately afterwards, Secretary to the Board of British White Herring Fishery.The duties of these Secretaryships he continued sedulously to discharge till interrupted by his last illness. He was for some time Secretary to the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts, an office which he relinquished about two years before his death. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, where he presented his paper on &quot;Parallel Roads of Glen Roy&quot; on 2 March 1818.

==Family==

On 8 February 1808 he married, on the banks of the Findhorn at Edinkillie, Morayshire, Charlotte Anne (1785–1864), the only child and heiress of George Cumin of Relugas. They had eight daughters and two sons.

==Politics==

With his close friend Henry Thomas Cockburn, Lord Cockburn, Sir Thomas was an active Liberal, and took a keen interest in politics. In 1832 he presided over a huge meeting of some 30,000 people rallying in favour of the Reform Bill at St. Anne&#x27;s Yards, the field immediately to the east of Holyroodhouse – said to be the largest ever political rally ever held in Scotland.

==Works==
Sir Thomas and his family were close friends of Sir Walter Scott. His first contribution to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1817, entitled &quot;Simon Roy, Gardener at Dunphail&quot;, was ascribed by some at first to Sir Walter Scott. His paper (1818) on &quot;The Parallel Roads of Glenroy&quot;, printed in vol. ix. of the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, first drew attention to the phenomenon in question.

In 1825 and 1827 he published two romances, &quot;Lochandhu&quot; and &quot;The Wolf of Badenoch&quot;. He became a frequent contributor to both &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Tait&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and in 1830 he published &quot;An Account of the Great Floods in Morayshire in 1829 in the Province of Moray and adjoining Districts&quot; which he illustrated with engravings of his beloved but greatly damaged Highland retreat, Relugas house.

About this time he was befriended by (and in 1829 took pains to promote) the Sobieski Stuart brothers, eventual publishers, in 1842, of the disputed &quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot;. Lauder agreed to transcribe the famous &quot;Cromarty MS&quot; which remained in the possession of his family until 1936, when it was presented to Queen Mary. It is now in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle. With it is a letter in which the donor states that the book was &#x27;given&#x27; to Sir Thomas &quot;by the Sobieski-Stuart brothers, Ian and Charles Edward&quot;. Sir Thomas and Sir Walter Scott corresponded on this &quot;MS&quot; at length. A full transcript of the &quot;Cromarty MS&quot; can be found in Stewart &amp; Thompson&#x27;s book, &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Forged Tartans&quot;, which deals mainly with the &quot;Vestiarium&quot; and their opinions on it.

According to the authoritative &quot;Complete Baronetage&quot;, vol.14, page 360, note a (on the authority of the late E.R. Stodart, Lyon Clerk Depute [1863-86]) &#x27;he claimed to be descended from the family of Lauder of Bass, but utterly failed to prove such descent. Thereupon he set up a monument to the Lauder family in the Greyfriars Churchyard, Edinburgh, stating thereon the pedigree as he wished it to be&#x27;.

Some subsequent works of Sir Thomas were &quot;Highland Rambles&quot;, with &quot;Long Tales to Shorten the Way&quot; (2 vols. 8 vo, 1837), &quot;Legendary Tales of the Highlands&quot; (3 vols. 12mo, 1841), &quot;Tour round the Coasts of Scotland&quot; (1842), and was asked by Queen Victoria to write the official history of her visit, entitled &quot;Memorial of the Royal Progress in Scotland&quot; (1843). Volume One of a &quot;Miscellany of Natural History&quot;, published in 1833, was also partly prepared by Lauder. An unfinished series of papers, written for Tait&#x27;s Magazine shortly before his death, was published under the title &quot;Scottish Rivers&quot;, with a preface by John Brown, MD., in 1874.

==Death==
He died on Monday 29 May 1848, at Grange House, and was buried in a newly created family plot in the then new cemetery at Grange, Edinburgh. The plot lies exactly half way along the eastern path and forms the focal point of the high path over the central vaults. Its small scale however is not dominant in the view.

He was succeeded by his eldest son and heir, Sir John Dick-Lauder, 8th Baronet.

==Lauder tartan==

The Lauder tartan first appears, it would seem, about this time, in the &quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot; amongst the &quot;bordour clanns&quot;. It can be found in &quot;The Tartans of the Clans and Septs of Scotland&quot; by W. &amp; A.K.Johnston, Edinburgh, 1906.

<text>George Alfred Lawrence (25 March 1827 – 23 September 1876) was a British novelist and barrister.

==Biography==
George Alfred Lawrence was born at Buxted, Sussex, the eldest child of Rev. Alfred Charnley Lawrence, Curate of Uxfield Chapel, Buxted, and Lady Emily Finch-Hatton (1797-1868), daughter of George Finch-Hatton and Lady Elizabeth Murray. She was also the sister of George William Finch-Hatton, 5th Earl of Nottingham and 10th Earl of Winchilsea. His father had been educated at Christ College, Cambridge, B.A. in 1813, and M.A. in 1818, and later became rector of Sandhurst, Kent from 1831-1857, he died in 1867.

George was educated at Rugby and at Balliol College, Oxford, and in 1851 married Mary Ann Georgiana Kirwan, daughter of Patrick Kirwan of Cregg Castle and Louisa Browne of Castlemacgarrett, whose siblings were Dominick Browne, 1st Baron Browne and Henrietta Browne, Viscountess Dillon. Her father Patrick Kirwan of Cregg was from the ancient Kirwan family and the nephew and heir of Richard Kirwan.

George and Mary had at least two sons:

# George Patrick Charles Lawrence (b.1859-1908) barrister at law married Hon. Hildegarde Davey, daughter of Baron Davey, had issue.
# Francis Richard Hatton Lawrence (b.1860)

He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1852, but soon abandoned the law for literature.

In 1857 he published anonymously a first novel, &quot;Guy Livingstone&quot;, &quot;portraying a more violent picture of Rugby School than Thomas Hughes.&quot; This gained great popularity. He went on to write several more tales in what has been called the &quot;muscular school&quot; of novel-writing, introducing into English fiction a &quot;beau sabreur&quot; type of hero, great in sport and love and war. &quot;Sword and Gown&quot; (1859), for example, &quot;is a bigamy story, climaxing in the Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;. The gentleman protagonist of &quot;Barren Honour&quot; (1862) dies in a shipwreck. It has been called &quot;a study of magnificently chivalrous self-destruction&quot;.

On the outbreak of the American Civil War Lawrence went to America with the intention of joining the Confederate Army. He was taken prisoner and only released on promising to return to England. He travelled much in later years and died, at 134 George Street, Edinburgh, on 23 Sept. 1876.

<doc id="1095831" wikidata="Q1064562" url="?curid=1095831" title="Charles Godfrey Leland">
<text>Charles Godfrey Leland (August 15, 1824 – March 20, 1903) was an American humorist and folklorist, born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was educated at Princeton University and in Europe.

Leland worked in journalism, travelled extensively, and became interested in folklore and folk linguistics. He published books and articles on American and European languages and folk traditions. He worked in a wide variety of trades, achieved recognition as the author of the comic &quot;Hans Breitmann’s Ballads&quot;, and fought in two conflicts. He wrote &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;, which became a primary source text for Neopaganism half a century later.

==Early life==
Leland was born to Charles Leland, a commission merchant, and Charlotte Godfrey on 15 August 1824 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His mother was a protegee of Hannah Adams, the first American woman to write professionally. Leland believed he was descended from John Leland, among other illustrious antiquaries.

Leland claimed to have been influenced as a child by intellectual figures such as Lafayette and Nicolas Gouïn Dufief. Leland recounted that shortly after his birth, his Dutch nurse took him to the family attic and performed a ritual involving a Bible, a key, a knife, lighted candles, money, and salt to ensure him a long life as &quot;a scholar and a wizard.&quot; His biographers refer to this account as foreshadowing his interest in folk traditions and magic. The poet George Henry Boker was his neighbour in youth, and the two maintained a friendship through adulthood. George B. McClellan was a classmate.

Leland&#x27;s early education was in the United States, and he attended college at Princeton University. During his schooling, he studied languages, wrote poetry, and pursued a variety of other interests, including Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, and the writings of Rabelais and Villon.

After college, Leland went to Europe to continue his studies, first in Germany, at Heidelberg and Munich, and in 1848 at the Sorbonne in Paris, where he became involved with the Revolutions of 1848 in France, fighting at constructed barricades against the King&#x27;s soldiers as a captain in the revolution.

==Career==
===Journalism===
Leland returned to the U.S. after the money given to him by his father for travel had run out and passed the bar in Pennsylvania. Instead of practicing law, he instead began a career in journalism. As a journalist, Leland wrote for &quot;The Illustrated News&quot; in New York, the &quot;Evening Bulletin&quot; in Philadelphia and eventually took on editorial duties for &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and the &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot;. In 1856 Leland married Eliza Bella &quot;Isabel&quot; Fisher.

Leland was also an editor for the &quot;Continental Monthly&quot;, a pro-Union Army publication. He enlisted in the Union Army in 1863, and fought at the Battle of Gettysburg. 

===Folklore research===
Leland returned to Europe in 1869, and travelled widely, eventually settling in London. His fame during his lifetime rested chiefly on his comic &quot;Hans Breitmann’s Ballads&quot; (1871), written in a combination of broken English and German (not to be confused, as it often has been, with Pennsylvania German). In recent times his writings on pagan and Aryan traditions have eclipsed the now largely forgotten Breitmann ballads, influencing the development of Wicca and modern paganism.

In his travels, he made a study of the Romani, on whom he wrote more than one book. Leland began to publish a number of books on ethnography, folklore and language. His writings on Algonquian and Romani culture were part of the contemporary interest in pagan and Aryan traditions. Scholars have found Leland had taken significant liberties with his research. In his book &quot;The Algonquin Legends of New England&quot; Leland attempts to link Wabanki culture and history to the Norse. It has also come to light that Leland altered some of those folk tales in order to lend credence to his theory. He erroneously claimed to have discovered &quot;the fifth Celtic tongue&quot;: the form of Cant, spoken among Irish Travellers, which he named Shelta. Leland became president of the English Gypsy Lore Society in 1888. In 1890, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

Eleven years later Godfrey produced &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;, reportedly containing the traditional beliefs of Italian witchcraft as conveyed him in a manuscript provided by a woman named Maddalena, whom he refers to as his &quot;witch informant.&quot; This remains his most influential book. &quot;Aradia&quot;&#x27;s accuracy has been disputed, and used by others as a study of witch lore in 19th century Italy. 

===Art education===
Leland was also a pioneer of art and design education, becoming an important influence on the Arts and Crafts movement. In his memoirs he wrote, &quot;The story of what is to me by far the most interesting period of my life remains to be written. This embraces an account of my labour for many years in introducing Industrial Art as a branch of education in schools.&quot;

He was involved in a series of books on industrial arts and crafts, including &quot;Pyrography or burnt-wood etching&quot; (1876), co-authored with Thomas Bolas (revised by Frank H Ball and G J Fowler in 1900). He was, more significantly, the founder and first director of the Public School of Industrial Art in Philadelphia (not to be confused with the contemporaneous Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art). This originated as a school to teach crafts to disadvantaged children and became widely known when it was praised by Oscar Wilde, who predicted his friend would be &quot;recognised and honoured as one of the great pioneers and leaders of the art of the future.&quot; The Home Arts and Industries Association was founded in imitation of this initiative.

==Translations ==
Leland translated the collective works of the German Romanticist Heinrich Heine, and poems by Joseph Victor von Scheffel into English. He translated Eichendorff&#x27;s novella &quot;Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts&quot; to English as &quot;Memoirs of a Good-for-Nothing&quot;, published in New York in 1866 by Leypohlt &amp; Holt.

==Legacy==
His biography was written by his niece Elizabeth Robins Pennell, an American who also settled in London and made her living in part by writing about travels in Europe. Leland had encouraged her as a young woman to consider writing as a career, which she did with some success.

<text>The ninth South American Championship was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 29 November to 25 December 1925.

In 1925, the participating countries were Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. Chile and Uruguay withdrew from the tournament, making this event the one with the fewest participating teams. The tournament was rescheduled to be held in two rounds.

Argentina won its second continental title.

==Squads==

==Venues==
==Final round==
Each team played two matches against each of the other teams. Two points were awarded for a win, one point for a draw, and zero points for a defeat.







==Result==
==Goal scorers==

6 goals
* Manuel Seoane

4 goals

* Lagarto
* Nilo
2 goals

* Arthur Friedenreich
* Gerardo Rivas
1 goal

* Antonio Cerrotti
* Alfredo Garasini
* Juan C. Irurieta
* Martín Sánchez
* Domingo Tarasconi
* Filo 
* Manuel Fleitas Solich
* Luis Fretes
==Aftermath==
Despite having won the tournament unbeaten, part of the Argentine media considered the team&#x27;s performance as &quot;poor&quot;, highlighting that Argentina was the winner only because of being stronger than the other two participants. Argentine magazine &quot;El Gráfico&quot; stated Argentina&#x27;s virtues were decreasing as the competition went by, with such notable failures.

Centre forward Juan Carlos Irurieta was injured in the first match, being replaced by Manuel Seoane, who did not play as good as he used to be because of his change of position (from left insider to centre forward). The media criticised hardly the performances of Garasini, Alejandro de los Santos, Antonio Cerrotti and Juan Bianchi. On the other hand, Domingo Tarasconi, Seoane and Martín Sánchez were mentioned as the most remarkable players. In the case of Tarasconi, his efficient dribbling, passing style and accurate corner kicks were widely praised. Seoane&#x27;s goalscoring prowess was also mentioned as one of the high points of Argentina, setting a record with six goals in four matches. Nevertheless, Seoane was also criticised for being out of shape due to his overweight.

Another Argentine player harshly criticised was goalkeeper Américo Tesoriere:

<doc id="1095840" wikidata="Q4963097" url="?curid=1095840" title="Eliza Lynn Linton">
<text>Eliza Lynn Linton (10 February 1822 – 14 July 1898) was the first female salaried journalist in Britain and the author of over 20 novels. Despite her path-breaking role as an independent woman, many of her essays took a strong anti-feminist slant.

==Life==
Linton was born in Keswick, Cumbria, England, the youngest of the twelve children of the Rev. James Lynn, vicar of Crosthwaite, and his wife Charlotte, who was the daughter of a bishop of Carlisle. The death of her mother when Eliza was five months old meant a chaotic upbringing, in which she was largely self-educated, but in 1845 she left home to earn her living as a writer in London.

After moving to Paris, she married W. J. Linton in 1858, an eminent wood-engraver, who was also a poet of note, a writer on his craft, and a Chartist agitator. She moved into his ramshackle house, Brantwood, in the Lake District, with his seven children from an earlier marriage, and wrote there a novel set locally: &quot;Lizzie Lorton of Greyrigg&quot;. The couple also lived at Gang Moor on the edge of Hampstead Heath for several years. In 1867 they separated amicably, her husband going to America and Eliza going back to life as a London writer.

Linton returned briefly to her childhood home in Cumbria in 1889, to feel &quot;half in a dream here. It is Keswick and yet not Keswick, as I am Eliza Lynn and yet not Eliza Lynn.&quot; She usually lived in London until about three years before her death, when she retired to Brougham House, Malvern. She died at Queen Anne&#x27;s Mansions, London, on 14 July 1898. Her ashes were scattered in Crosthwaite churchyard.

==Career==
Linton arrived in London in 1845 as a protégée of the novelist William Harrison Ainsworth and the poet Walter Savage Landor. At one time she was promoted by Theodosia Monson, who was a champion of women&#x27;s rights. In 1846 she produced her first novel, &quot;Azeth, the Egyptian&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Amymone&quot; (1848) and &quot;Realities&quot; (1851). Neither had great success. Meanwhile she began working as a journalist and became acquainted with George Eliot. Linton joined the staff of the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; in 1849, a position said to have made her the first woman to be paid a salary as a journalist. She left the paper in 1851 over a disagreement.

During her time in Paris, Linton was a correspondent for &quot;The Leader&quot;, which her husband had helped found. She was a regular contributor to Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Household Words&quot; and to &quot;St James&#x27;s Gazette&quot;, the &quot;Daily News, Ainsworth&#x27;s Magazine, The Cornhill Magazine&quot; and other leading newspapers. The prolific Linton became one of the best-known women periodical contributors of her time. Her 1864 guide to &quot;The Lake Country&quot; still bears reading for tart comments on the tourist rituals of the Victorians.

In 1881 and 1883 she travelled to Palermo, where she met Tina Whitaker and encouraged her to write.

After separating from her husband, Linton returned to writing novels, in which she finally attained wide popularity. Her most successful works were &quot;The True History of Joshua Davidson&quot; (1872), &quot;Patricia Kemball&quot; (1874), and &quot;The Autobiography of Christopher Kirkland&quot; (1885), the latter being in fact a thinly disguised autobiography. In 1896, she became one of the first women to be elected to the Society of Authors and was the first woman to serve on the society&#x27;s committee.

==Views==
Linton was a severe critic of early feminism. Her prominent essay on the subject, &quot;The Girl of the Period,&quot; appeared in the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; in 1868 as a vehement attack. In 1891, she wrote &quot;Wild Women as Politicians&quot;, explaining her view that politics were naturally the sphere of men, as was fame of any sort. &quot;Amongst our most renowned women,&quot; she wrote, &quot;are some who say with their whole heart, I would rather have been the wife of a great man, or the mother of a hero, than what I am, famous in my own person.&quot; Linton exemplifies how the fight against votes for women was not organised only by men (see Anti-suffragism).

Her obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; noted her &quot;animosity towards all, or rather, some of those facets which may be conveniently called the &#x27;New Woman&#x27;,&quot; but added that &quot;it would perhaps be difficult to reduce Mrs. Lynn Linton&#x27;s views on what was and what was not desirable for her own sex to a logical and connected form.&quot; Revisionist critics have noted an unconscious sympathy for the dashing &quot;modern women&quot; in her fiction, and to her support for the right of married women to own property and so gain greater independence. (See Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1870 and Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1882.)

Linton&#x27;s contribution to a symposium on English fiction in 1890 took a less aggressive stance towards Grundyism than her fellow-contributor Thomas Hardy.

<text>Thomas Henry Lister (1800 – 5 June 1842) was an English novelist and biographer, and served as Registrar General in the British civil service. He was an early exponent of the silver fork novel as a genre and also presaged &quot;futuristic&quot; writing in one of his stories.

==Life and writings==
Lister was the son of Thomas Lister of Armitage Park, Staffordshire, and his first wife Harriet Anne Seale. His maternal grandfather was John Seale. His paternal half-sister Adelaide Lister was first married to their second cousin, Thomas Lister, 2nd Baron Ribblesdale, and then to John Russell, 1st Earl Russell. Lister was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was the brother of novelist Harriet Cradock.

His several novels include &quot;Granby&quot; (1826), &quot;Herbert Lacy&quot; (1828), and &quot;Arlington&quot; (1832). &quot;Granby&quot;, an early example of the silver fork novel, was favourably reviewed by Sydney Smith in the Edinburgh Review. He also wrote a &quot;Life of Clarendon&quot;. His 1830 story entitled &quot;A Dialogue for the Year 2130&quot; might be described as an early example of science fiction or &quot;futuristic&quot; writing, of the kind later popularized by Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. Published in &quot;The Keepsake&quot;, a literary annual, it looks forward to a world in which gentlemen go hunting on machines and shoot horses, while a certain Lady D. owns a troublesome automatic letter-writer and is served by a &quot;steam-porter&quot;, which opens doors.

In 1836 he was appointed the first Registrar General for England and Wales heading a new General Register Office. He set up the system of civil registration of births, deaths and marriages and organized the 1841 UK Census.

==Personal matters==
On 6 November 1830, Lister married Lady Maria Theresa Villiers, daughter of George Villiers and Theresa Parker, both of noble families. They had three children:
*Sir Thomas Villiers Lister (1832–1902), diplomat, married first Fanny Harriet Coryton and secondly Florence Selina Hamilton, daughter of the geologist William Hamilton by his second wife, Margaret Frances Florence Dillon.
*Maria Theresa Villiers Lister (died 1 February 1863), married the politician William Vernon Harcourt, by whom she had a son, Lewis Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt.
*Alice Beatrice Lister (died 28 March 1898), married Algernon Borthwick, 1st Baron Glenesk, owner of the London newspaper &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, by whom she had a daughter, Lilias Margaret Frances Borthwick, who married Seymour Bathurst, 7th Earl Bathurst.

Thomas Henry Lister died of tuberculosis in 1842, while living at Adelphi Terrace, London.

<text>Eros Bolivar &quot;Cy&quot; Barger (May 18, 1885 – September 23, 1964) was an American right-handed starting pitcher and left-handed batter who played in the American League for the New York Highlanders (1906–07); in the National League with the Brooklyn teams Superbas (1910) and Dodgers (1911–12), and for the Pittsburgh Rebels (1914–15) in the Federal League. 
A native of Jamestown, Kentucky, Barger was a dead-ball era pitcher who also played first base and shortstop as well as the outfield. He went to college at Transylvania University and debuted in the majors on August 30, 1906. With the Highlanders, he had a 0–0 record in 11 innings pitched over parts of two seasons.

In 1909, Barger led Rochester to the Eastern League title with 23 wins and minuscule 1.00 earned run average. Again in the majors with the 1910 Superbas, Barger enjoyed a career year with 15 victories and a 2.88 ERA, winning 11 games the following season. With the Rebels, he won 19 games from 1914 to 1915.

<text>William Lithgow (c. 1582 – c. 1645) was a Scottish traveller, writer, poet and alleged spy. He claimed at the end of his various peregrinations to have travelled on foot.

== Life and adventures ==
William Lithgow was born at Lanark, the oldest son of the merchant James Lithgow and Alison Grahame, his wife. A family tradition had it that William was discovered in the company of a certain Miss Lockhart, and her four brothers cut off his ears, earning him the nickname &quot;lugless Willie&quot;.

Prior to 1610 he had visited Shetland, Switzerland, and Bohemia. In that year he set out from Paris for Rome but on his way had allegedly been apprehended by a band of robbers but instead they took pity on him and gave him money instead.he arrived in Rome on the 7th of March, where he remained for four weeks before moving on to other parts of Italy: Naples, Ancona, before moving on to Athens, Constantinople, it was on a voyage to Constantinople from Italy he claims to have been in a shipwreck and narrowly escaped with his life. Upon reaching Constantinople he is supposedly the first European to sample coffee. After a three-month stay in Constantinople, he sailed to other Greek localities and then on to Palestine, arriving in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday 1612, and later on to Egypt. His next journey, 1614–1616, was in Tunis and Fez; but his last, 1619–1621, to Spain, ended in his apprehension at Malaga and torture under the Inquisition as a spy. He also visited Crete.

<doc id="1095851" wikidata="Q49945" url="?curid=1095851" title="Three Investigators">
<text>The Three Investigators is an American juvenile detective book series first published as &quot;Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators&quot;. It was created by Robert Arthur Jr., who believed involving a famous person such as movie director Alfred Hitchcock would attract attention. Random House is the U.S. publisher and still has some of the rights to the books. Other rights are possessed by the heirs of Robert Arthur, Jr. and the German publisher Kosmos. The characters known as the &quot;Three Investigators&quot; are three boys named Jupiter Jones, Peter Crenshaw and Bob Andrews. As the series has become very popular in Germany, several stories have been produced directly for the German market.

Most of the novels cover some sort of mysterious events that seem to be supernatural at first (e.g. an ancient Egyptian mummy that appears to be whispering) but are ultimately explained scientifically.

==Original editions==
The original series was published from 1964 to 1987 and comprised 43 finished books, one unfinished story (&quot;The Mystery of the Ghost Train&quot;) and four &quot;Find Your Fate&quot; books. Between 1989 and 1990 Random House published the Three Investigators Crimebusters series.

Books number 1 to 9 and 11 were written by the creator, Robert Arthur, who also specified ideas for a few of the other stories. Arthur had been an editor for several book collections attributed to Alfred Hitchcock. The other authors were William Arden (Dennis Lynds), Nick West (Kin Platt), Mary Virginia Carey and Marc Brandel (born Marcus Beresford). All of the authors wrote their own introductions and epilogues, which were dictated purportedly by Hitchcock and later in the series a fictional writer, Hector Sebastian, who supposedly recorded the adventures of the Three Investigators from their words. The illustrators in the series began with Harry Kane and Ed Vebell and include Jack Hearne, Herb Mott, Stephen Marchesi, Robert Adragna and William A. (&quot;Bill&quot;) Dodge.

For the original series, the specific ages of the investigators were never revealed, but contextual information indicates that they were likely 13 or 14 years old. They were not old enough to drive a car legally, but were said to be just a few years younger than their nemesis Skinny Norris, who had a driver&#x27;s license from a state where the required age for a license was younger. On one occasion it was mentioned that Pete was part of the high-school wrestling team. In the later Crimebusters series, it was stated once that the Three Investigators team was initiated when the boys were 13.

The investigators were typically introduced to a mystery by a client or by finding something unusual accidentally in the junkyard of Jupiter&#x27;s Uncle Titus Jones and Aunt Mathilda, who had a salvage business. The boys encountered baffling, sometimes misleading clues and danger before finally solving the mystery. The series had one major theme: however strange, mystical, or even supernatural a particular phenomenon may seem at first, it is capable of being traced to human agency with the determined application of reason and logic. This theme was compromised on four occasions by Carey: in &quot;The Mystery of Monster Mountain&quot;, the boys encounter Bigfoot; in &quot;The Invisible Dog&quot;, she canonizes astral projection and dangles the possibility of a &quot;phantom priest&quot;; in &quot;The Mystery of the Scar-Faced Beggar&quot;, a woman has genuine prophetic dreams; and in the final book of the original run, &quot;The Mystery of the Cranky Collector&quot;, a young woman&#x27;s ghost returns to haunt her former employer&#x27;s mansion.

Most mysteries were solved by Jupiter Jones, a supreme logician who implicitly used the Occam&#x27;s Razor principle: that the simplest and most rational explanation should be preferred to an explanation which requires additional assumptions. The boys were able to solve their mysteries with relatively few resources: they generally had little more than a telephone, bicycles, access to a library and—with reference to the Hollywood setting of the series—a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce (which Jupiter wins the use of in the first book).

In the first book, &quot;The Secret of Terror Castle&quot;, Jupiter bluffs his way into the office of director Alfred Hitchcock and makes a deal with him that if the Investigators can find him a haunted house to use as a location for his next movie, Hitchcock will introduce the story of their adventures. Hitchcock agrees, not expecting them to succeed; but at the end of the book is impressed with the boys&#x27; investigation and not only introduces the book but also refers several other future clients to them in subsequent novels. The last chapter of each book was usually an epilogue in which the investigators sat with Alfred Hitchcock (and later, Hector Sebastian), reviewing the mystery and revealing the deductions through the clues discussed earlier in the book.

In 1989, Random House revamped the series, naming it &quot;The 3 Investigators—Crimebusters Series&quot;. The investigators were now 17 years old, could drive cars and be much more independent. The stories continued to include an abundance of detective work, but with the addition of more action. The series was well-received but was halted during 1990, when legal disagreements between Random House and the heirs of the Arthur estate could not be resolved. By 2005, the disagreements were still not settled.

Eleven novels were published in the &quot;CrimeBusters&quot; series, which was initiated by one of the series&#x27; authors, William Arden, pseudonym of Dennis Lynds, who wrote the Dan Fortune mystery series for adults by the pseudonym Michael Collins. The other authors were: H. William Stine and wife Megan Stine, G.H. Stone (Gayle Lynds), William MacCay, Marc Brandel and Peter Lerangis. Random House has reprinted several of the original books as two paperback reprint series, partly to assure their legal rights.

Between 1964 and 1990, Random House published a total of 56 books. After the discontinuation of the series in 1990, a German author team began writing new books under the commission of the Franckh Kosmos publishing house in 1993. In 2011, three previously unpublished novels by the US authors Peter Lerangis, Megan and H. William Stine and G. H. Stone were published in Germany.

==Premise==
The Three Investigators are a junior detective team that initially came together because of a mental exercise club. They live in Rocky Beach, a fictional coastal town between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. In some of their cases, the boys are supported by Alfred Hitchcock, the chauffeur Worthington, and the police inspectors Reynolds and Cotta.
“We Investigate Anything” is The Three Investigators&#x27; trademark slogan on their business card. Most often, Jupiter is the one to hand over the card in a fitting moment to see the clients’ reactions to the three question marks. Often, that reaction is a joke, with the clients asking whether the question marks mean the investigators doubt their own abilities. Jupiter usually retorts something like: “That&#x27;s our symbol. [...] The question marks stand for mysteries unsolved, riddles unanswered, puzzles of any kind. So we use it as our trademark. We investigate any kind of mystery.”

To prove themselves, The Three Investigators usually have a lot of persuading to do in the beginning, as the clients often mistrust their abilities because the investigators are so young.

In their first cases, The Three Investigators also provide, apart from their business card, a letter of recommendation from the Police Department of Rocky Beach signed by Chief Inspector Samuel Reynolds. It says: &quot;The holder of this badge is a junior volunteer assistant to the Police Department of Rocky Beach. The authority advocates any support from third parties.&quot;

===Jupiter===
Jupiter &quot;Jupe&quot; Jones, First Investigator—A former child actor named &quot;Baby Fatso&quot;, although he hates it when people mention this. Jupiter is intelligent and stocky, and has a remarkable memory and deductive skills. Jupiter&#x27;s parents (professional ballroom dancers) died in an accident when he was four years old. Although “An Ear for Danger” mentions a car accident as their cause of death, in the episode “... das leere Grab” (German only), they are said to have disappeared following a plane crash. Jupiter lives with his uncle and aunt, Titus and Mathilda Jones, who manage a scrapyard.

Jupiter&#x27;s past acting ability benefits him frequently in mysteries because he can act older than he is, perform imitations of people when necessary and act less intelligent to extract information from potential suspects.

Jupiter is a prolific reader and inventor and frequently invents a device that simplifies solving a mystery. Jupiter has a knack for interpreting clues to solve otherwise unsolvable mysteries. He also likes to play pranks on the other two investigators. Because of his intellectual side, Jupe is adept at using big words and frequently uses them to his advantage, particularly to seem older, annoy Pete, and startle adults. Jupe hates to dismiss an unsolved mystery, which frequently means that he drags Bob and Pete along for the ride.

===Peter===
Peter &quot;Pete&quot; Crenshaw, Second Investigator—Pete is an athletic youth who dislikes dangerous situations, but is nonetheless reliable as the &quot;action member&quot; of the team. Pete loves and cares for animals, and is fond of uttering the exclamation &quot;Gleeps!&quot;. His father works as a film technician for special effects in Hollywood.

Pete is a frequent companion of Jupiter on stake-outs and other field trips, particularly in the earlier mysteries, when Bob is unavailable. While he may not have the intellectual ability of Jupiter, Pete is nonetheless considered as an equal in the stories and is able to point out Jupiter&#x27;s own shortcomings (usually in a comical fashion). He is also capable of making deductions and sometimes serves as the clue-bearer instead of Bob. He has an excellent sense of direction, as in &quot;The Mystery of the Stuttering Parrot&quot;.

===Bob===
Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Andrews, Records and Research—Bob is studious and meticulous, and wears glasses. Depending on the case, Bob&#x27;s father is a sports writer, business journalist, or political journalist, and occasionally helps The Three Investigators in some of their cases.

Early in the series, Bob is hampered physically by a leg brace he wore, due to multiple fractures suffered when he rolled down a hill. This handicap relegated him to a more studious and less physical involvement. Bob works part-time in the local library, suiting his role as data collector. Bob also serves as the clue-bearer for many of the adventures, because of his research at the library. Bob&#x27;s leg brace is removed between the end of &quot;Whispering Mummy&quot; and the beginning of &quot;Green Ghost&quot;.

===Headquarters===
Part workshop, hideaway, and detective office, the Three Investigators maintain their headquarters in an old house trailer hidden among piles of junk at the edge of the Jones&#x27; scrapyard. The house trailer is outfitted with multiple secret exits, a small lab, darkroom, telephone, typewriter, and reference works. Jupiter often used spare parts salvaged from the scrapyard to build equipment for the team, including a tape recorder and periscope.

==Copyright dispute==
===Initial position===
The series was invented by American writer Robert Arthur in the US in 1964. Arthur sold the international exploitation rights to the publisher Random House, however he retained the copyright. The contract included the rights to publish books, films, comics and mechanical sound reproduction. Since there was no significant audio book market at that time, it is legally not clearly determinable and therefore doubtful whether this &quot;mechanical sound reproduction&quot; describes the medium of audio books or radio plays as they exist now. The Franckh-Kosmos publisher of Random House acquired the German-speaking exploitation rights in 1968. The label EUROPA received the rights to the audio version of the series as part of the sublicense partners of the Kosmos Verlag.

After Robert Arthur&#x27;s death in 1969, the copyrights were given to the University of Michigan. In his will, Arthur declared that &quot;all rights, legal titles and stakes, [he] owned by the time of [his] death, concerning all published books, short stories, plays or unpublished manuscripts, including all issued copyright claims, just as all rights for license fees and subsidiary rights, as it is specified in [his] contracts with publishers&quot; were to be given to the University of Michigan. 

Since then Random House had been paying royalties to the university, but they stopped doing so as of 1992, because it was not clear whether the University of Michigan still had a legal entitlement. The American copyright law said that literature that received a copyright before 1977 had a safeguard clause that made sure that all licenses automatically returned to the author or his heirs after 28 years. As a result of that, Random House and Arthur&#x27;s heirs, his children Elizabeth Ann Arthur and Robert Andrew Arthur, signed a contract for the rights of use of the volumes of Arthur and the further usage of the characters, under the condition that the 10 books were to be brought back onto the American market.

After the series was discontinued in the US in 1991, Kosmos Verlag sought the rights to continue the series in Germany with German authors, and in 1994 signed a corresponding contract with Random House without the consent of Arthur&#x27;s heirs.

In 2002, Random House returned the rights of the ten volumes to Robert Arthur&#x27;s heirs after the publisher failed to comply with the agreed republications of the works. In 1999, however, Kosmos-Verlag had already registered the word mark throughout Germany and by 2003 throughout Europe as well as a European trademark for audio carriers and printed products.

Negotiations between Kosmos Verlag and the heirs on a new usage rights agreement failed because Kosmos relied on its trademark registration and ongoing agreements with Random House. Furthermore, Kosmos doubted that Arthur&#x27;s heirs were the right holders since according to Arthur&#x27;s will, all rights were to be transferred to the University of Michigan. At the end of 2004, Random House and Kosmos signed an extensive agreement to transfer all rights to the other American novels not written by Arthur to Kosmos Verlag.

===Lawsuit===

Due to the unclear legal situation, EUROPA decided at the beginning of 2005 not to publish any further episodes based on the book templates of Kosmos Verlag and discontinued the license payments to Kosmos. At that time the books “Spur ins Nichts” and “...und der Geisterzug” (both German only) had already been recorded as a radio play.

In 2006, the parent company of the European label Sony Music Entertainment (formerly Sony BMG) finally gained all the German rights on Arthur&#x27;s creations and the use of the original characters and showplaces independently from Kosmos publishing house of Robert Arthur&#x27;s successors. The contract contained the right to order new books in German, as well as the right to evaluate the sound storage medium. Moreover, all were transferred: from &quot;[...] interests [of Arthur&#x27;s children] in all German audio recordings, bound books, pocketbooks, theatrical performances and electronic film recordings of theatrical performances to all existing derived products in Sony BMG&quot;. EUROPA developed a new audio book named &quot;&quot; based on it. Indeed, EUROPA avoided the use of the name &quot;Die Drei ???&quot; and also the name created by Kosmos because of the protection of the brand. Instead of that only characters and names which were based on Arthur&#x27;s ideas were used (characters’ original names).

The Kosmos publishing house continued its series of books under well-known titles and with famous character&#x27;s names. The society filed a lawsuit against the Kosmos publishing house because Sony BMG itself saw its exploitation rights violated. A provisional disposal was obtained against the sale of two novels “Spuk im Netz” and “Der Fluch des Drachen” (both German only).

Because of this, the two books had to be taken off the market retroactively. This verdict was overturned by the Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf on May 13, 2007. The judges were unable to identify Robert Arthur&#x27;s children as the rightful owners of the copyright law. They found that the University of Michigan rightfully inherited the works of Robert Arthur and his characters, meaning that his heirs could not have transferred the rights to Sony BMG. A due date was set for the complainant of Sony BMG to submit the new chain-of-title as well as the new contracts as they were available to her. Eventually, Kosmos and Sony BMG negotiated again to come to an extrajudicial agreement, causing the delivery of Episode 7 of &quot;DiE DR3i&quot; to be delayed. The final release date of Episodes 7 and 8 was 30 November 2007.

===Outcome===

In February 2008, Sony BMG and Kosmos came to an agreement. The rights to the books as well as the brand name, which were the foundation for the audio dramas remained with Kosmos as well as all other publishing products, including calendars, non-fiction literature, mobile and computer games, science kits and board games.

The rights to use audio material with the inclusion of the entire catalog as well as stage shows, plays and the commercialization of merchandise remain with the record label Europa.

Since 4 April 2008, new German editions under the name “Die Drei ???” have been published, based on the books published by Kosmos. The rights to continue the hugely successful audio plays “” were transferred to Europa as well. The already published audio play episodes were sold by the previous license holder USM until late 2008. Furthermore, a withdrawal of the series &quot;DiE DR3i&quot; from sale until 1 January 2009 was agreed upon.

Since 1999, the spin-off series “Die Drei ??? Kids”, issued by publisher Kosmos, has been supposed to target a much younger audience. The contents of the stories were thus tailored to be more suitable for children and to be less complex. Besides, with an age of only ten years, the young detectives are considerably younger than in the current episodes of the original series.

==International and foreign-language editions==

===Bangladesh===
The Three Investigators have also been published in Bangladesh by Sheba Prokashoni as &quot;Tin Goyenda&quot; (translated by Rakib Hasan) since 1985 and appealed to many young Bangladeshi readers till this day. In the Bengali editions, Jupiter Jones is known as Kishor Pasha (কিশোর পাশা, a Bangladeshi American). The other two are named as Musa Aman (মুসা আমান, African American) and Robin Milford (রবিন মিলফোর্ড, Irish American). Other characters include Rashed Chacha (রাশেদচাচা, corresponding to Uncle Titus), Mary Chachi (মেরিচাচী, corresponding to Aunt Mathilda), Georgina &#x27;Gina&#x27; Parker and her pet dog Ruffian, the chauffeur Hanson, Bavarian brothers Boris and Rover, and movie director Davis Christopher (in place of Alfred Hitchcock). The character Skinny Norris appears as Shutki Terry (শুঁটকি টেরি) and the famous French art thief appears as Chaupain (শোঁপা). The character Victor Simon in the Bangladeshi edition appears in the place of &quot;Hector Sebastian&quot;. The stories are generally set in Rocky Beach, California, although the investigators travel to exotic places like Africa and Bangladesh on occasions. The stories featuring Gina and her pet dog Ruffian were actually a Bangla adaptation from &quot;The Famous Five&quot; by Enid Blyton. The name Gina is a short form of &#x27;Georgina&#x27; which was the same name used in &quot;The Famous Five&quot;. She also owns a pet dog in &quot;The Famous Five&quot; series, named Timmy. A total of 152 books have been published till the National Book Fair of 2020 in Bangladesh.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, 13 books were published from 1966–70 by &quot;Hasselbalch&quot; under the title &quot;&quot;Alfred Hitchcock og De tre Detektiver&quot;. Most of the rest were also released in the following years by Lademann.

===Finland===
46 books were published in Finland by Gummerus between 1975 and 1990 under the title &quot;Alfred Hitchcock 3 Etsivää&quot;. Translations include all the 43 books from the original series, but in slightly different order than in US, 2 from the Find Your Fate series (#44 The Case of the Weeping Coffin and #45 The Case of the Dancing Dinosaur) and 1 from the Crimebusters series (#46 Hot Wheels).

===France===
In France, the original nine books were published during the 1970s by the &quot;Bibliothèque verte&quot; collection of books for young readers under the title &quot;Les Trois Jeunes Détectives&quot;&quot; (&quot;The Three young detectives&quot;).. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the series continued. As a whole, 37 volumes (including four of the Crimebusters series) has been published.

===Germany===
The Three Investigators books have always been very popular in Germany. In 1968 the Kosmos publishing company started to publish translations of the 43 original books which they retitled &quot;Die drei ???&quot; (&quot;Die drei Fragezeichen&quot;, meaning &quot;The Three Question Marks&quot;). Kosmos also renamed Jupiter Jones as &quot;Justus Jonas&quot; and shortened Peter Crenshaw&#x27;s name to &quot;Peter Shaw&quot;. Bob Andrews retained his original name. In 1993 Kosmos started to publish new written books by German authors. 

In 1979 the German publisher Europa started a radio drama based on the books, as published by Kosmos. All in all, as of September 2024, this resulted in 234 books (usually 6 books per year, 3 during spring and 3 during autumn) and 229 radio dramas published. In 2005, a litigation between Kosmos and Europa disallowed the latter to use the German names introduced by Kosmos. Subsequently, Europa published a nine episode radio drama named &quot;DiE DR3i&quot; between 2005 and 2007. &quot;DiE DR3i&quot; were mostly identical to &quot;Die drei ???&quot; and they also used the same German voice-actors, but changed the disallowed names to their English originals. &quot;DiE Dr3i&quot; were stopped when Europa and Kosmos reached an agreement and &quot;Die drei ???&quot; resumed again.

Taped radio dramas (&quot;Hörspiele&quot;) of the novels have been especially popular in Germany with most of them having been certified Gold or Platinum by the German Federal Association of Music Industry. In total, the radio dramas have sold more than 45 million copies and the books about 16 million copies in Germany (2013). A study conducted in 2009 by the series&#x27; publisher &quot;Europa&quot; suggests that nowadays, most fans are between 20 and 45 years of age.

The radio actors, who have been narrating the plays since 1979, toured the country multiple times to perform plays in front of a live-audience. They broke their own Guinness World Record when performing &quot;Phonophobia – Symphony of Fear&quot; in front of 20,000 people at Berlin Waldbühne during 2014.

In the booklet of the German audio play &quot;The Mystery of the Invisible Dog&quot;, the episode upon which it was based is credited erroneously to Nick West. Moreover, in Germany there are different revised editions of &quot;The Mystery of the Scar-faced Beggar&quot;: one using Alfred Hitchcock as their patron, one using Alfred Hitchcock and Hector Sebastian, and another one using only Hector Sebastian (in Germany renamed as &quot;Albert Hitfield&quot;).

New English-language Three Investigators titles were released during 2005 for the first time since 1990. The German &#x27;American-English&#x27; series included the release of &quot;Poisoned E-Mail&quot; and &quot;The Curse of the Cell Phone&quot;. As of May 2008, a total of seven German stories had been translated and published in this format, and an eighth title was planned for publication during October 2008.

In 2006, following the example of “Die drei ???”/&quot;The Three Investigators&quot;, a detective series specifically for girls titled “” was launched by publisher Franckh-Kosmos. In a similar way as the original, the book series contains stories about a teenage detective trio, only this time consisting of three girls; the stories take place in a big German city.

The band Jupiter Jones, formed in 2002, named themselves after the original name of the first detective Jupiter Jones (Justus Jonas in German). The rock band (&quot;Carpathian Dog&quot;) from Cologne named themselves after a title of one episode (&quot;Mystery of the Invisible Dog&quot;). On the album “Bordsteinkantengeschichten” by the band , a long scream from the episode “Der seltsame Wecker” (&quot;Mystery of the Screaming Clock&quot;) can be heard. The intro and outro of the album “Alles auf Schwarz” by the rock band from Hamburg are narrated by Oliver Rohrbeck in the role of Justus Jonas, but without mentioning Justus’ name. Techno musician and sound artist Phillip Sollmann adapted his pseudonym &quot;Efdemin&quot; from the character &quot;Mihai Eftimin&quot; in the episode &quot;Die flammende Spur&quot; (&quot;The flaming trace&quot;).

===Greece===

The cover author for the Three Investigators books was always Alfred Hitchcock, whereas the inner copyright notice correctly reported the real author (although saying &quot;Text by ...&quot;).

===Japan===
In Japan, the series was published three times.

From 1969 to 1971, 4 books were published by Nihon Publishing.

In 1976, 6 books were published by Kaiseisha (Originally, 10 books were planned to be published). They were illustrated by Ken Ishikawa and Dynamic Productions.

From 1987 to 1988, 10 books were published by Kaiseisha, yet again. They were not exactly the same as the publication planned for 1976, and 2 from the Find Your Fate series.

=== Latin ===
The German demand for the adventures of The Three Investigators produced another offshoot in 2011. Ulrich Krauße translated &quot;The Curse of the Dragon&quot; into Latin with three German Latin teachers working as proofreaders. Krauße&#x27;s translation, titled &quot;De Tribus Investigatoribus et Fato Draconis&quot;, was popular in Germany among students of Latin.

Similarly, all British Armada paperback editions of the title &quot;The Mystery of the Moaning Cave&quot; are credited erroneously to Robert Arthur. Moreover, the British series reversed the order of #42 and #43, meaning that the Armada original series ends with &quot;Wreckers&#x27; Rock&quot;.

<text>:
Robert Lloyd (1733–1764) was an English poet and satirist.

Lloyd was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1755 and M.A. in 1758. He was author of the popular poem &quot;The Actor&quot; (1760) and the comic opera &quot;The Capricious Lovers&quot; (1764), first performed at Drury Lane just a few weeks before his death. He was co-author, with George Colman, of &quot;Ode to Obscurity&quot; and &quot;Ode to Oblivion&quot;, both published in the early 1760s, and both satires on the works of the poets William Mason and Thomas Gray. He was also co-editor of &quot;St James&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (1762–1763), and member of the infamous Nonsense Club of Old Westminster men with Bonnell Thornton, George Colman, William Cowper and others.

Lloyd was often in debt, and apparently died in Fleet Prison on 15 December 1764, shortly after the death of his lifelong friend Charles Churchill, to whose sister, Patty, he was engaged. Churchill&#x27;s sister died shortly after. The &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; says that Lloyd joined Charles Churchill in a &quot;reckless career of dissipation&quot;, and Vulliamy, in his biography of James Boswell, wrote that &quot;Lloyd died when he was thirty-one, ruined by his friendship with Churchill&quot;.

<doc id="1095859" wikidata="Q6887829" url="?curid=1095859" title="Mockingbird Foundation">
<text>The Mockingbird Foundation is a charitable organization founded by fans of the jam band Phish in 1996 (legally incorporated the following year) to support music education for children. Unconventional in structure, it exists almost entirely online, allowing a higher percentage of income to be distributed directly to deserving organizations. Projects include the publication of &quot;The Phish Companion&quot; and the production of the Phish tribute album &quot;Sharin&#x27; in the Groove&quot;. As of May 22, 2024, the foundation had provided over 675 disbursements (through grants and other awards) totalling over $2,396,000; sold over 70,000 copies of &quot;The Phish Companion&quot;; and sold over 25,000 copies of &quot;Sharin&#x27; in the Groove&quot;. The organization was recognized officially by Phish when, in 2004, the band donated all proceeds from their Livephish download service to the Mockingbird Foundation.

==&quot;The Phish Companion&quot;==
The Mockingbird Foundation is a leading provider of historical information about the band Phish and its music. The Foundation&#x27;s book project, &quot;The Phish Companion&quot;, is a comprehensive and authoritative reference chronicling Phish and their music, including years preceding and following the band&#x27;s own history. It was researched with the help of all official Phish sources, including band archivist Kevin Shapiro, bassist Mike Gordon, lyricist Tom Marshall, and others. Over 1,500 named fans contributed to the First Edition, with several hundred more augmenting the second.

The third edition of The Phish Companion: A Guide to the Band &amp; Their Music is a hard-bound, 898-page, full-color reference guide, with setlists, song histories, charts, show reviews, fan stories, and 128 pages of Phish photography – most of which has never been published.

==&quot;Sharin&#x27; in the Groove&quot;==
A Phish tribute album, &quot;Sharin&#x27; in the Groove&quot;, features nearly two hours of music from 23 individual acts including The Wailers, Dave Matthews, Jimmy Buffett, John Scofield, Arlo Guthrie, the Stanford Marching Band, The Vermont Youth Orchestra, Tom Marshall, as well as members of the Trey Anastasio&#x27;s band, Jefferson Airplane, Talking Heads, and Los Lobos. It was produced independently on an all-volunteer basis: none of the artists, managers, studios, or others involved received compensation for their contribution. The tracks are arranged like a live show, including two sets and an encore.

==&quot;Phish.net&quot;==
The Foundation formally adopted the fan website Phish.net as a project January 17, 2005. The site had begun in 1991 and served Phish fans for nearly two decades as static HTML pages. It was re-launched as an integrated database of setlists, song histories, reviews, and more in fall 2009.

==&quot;Runaway Open&quot;==
The Foundation has held a series of events (poker, poster, and golf), including an annual charity golf tournament for Phish fans starting in 2016, typically the second day of the band&#x27;s multi-night run at Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Arena in Denver, CO. The event name makes reference to several Phish songs, including &quot;Runaway Jim&quot; and &quot;Kung&quot;, the latter of which includes the line, &quot;Yes, we can stage a runaway golf cart marathon.&quot; The Ninth Annual Runaway Open will August 31, 2024, at Willis Case, with a shotgun start at 8:30 a.m. for 120 players.

==DeLucia Awards==
In 2004, the Foundation announced plans to acknowledge innovative work in music education through the institution of the DeLucia Awards, named for Mockingbird founder and originator of &quot;The Phish Companion&quot;, Craig DeLucia. The first DeLucia Awards were announced in May 2006.

There may be &quot;up to&quot; five DeLucia Award recipients in a given year; and each year, one recipient will also be awarded the DeLucia Prize, a monetary complement of $1,000. The recipient(s) should have accomplished something which effectively developed musical abilities, made efficient use of available resources, could be replicated in other settings, and might inspire others to seek, provide, and/or support music education. The recipient(s) will have demonstrated a passion for music education such as by teaching in an exceptional, innovative, or unique manner; impacting their communities in a substantial way; or using unconventional techniques, discourse, or concepts in their roles as music educators.
