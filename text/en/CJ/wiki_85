<text>Westleigh is a suburb in the Upper North Shore region of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia, 22 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Hornsby Shire.

==History==
Westleigh derived its name from its location, directly west of Thornleigh. Development as a residential suburb began in 1967 and was marketed by Stewart Upton a large real estate firm following the subdivision of the area bounded by Duneba and Eucalyptus Drive, and the former riding school which was situated near Billarga Road. Prior to this time the area was rural with many citrus orchards, with a small number of homes on acreage along Quarter Sessions Rd, extending north towards the former sandstone quarry near &quot;Blackfellow&#x27;s Head&quot;, which was used as a dumping ground for stolen cars of the 1940s and 1950s. The area was originally heavily timbered, so many streets bear the names of Australian trees such as Stringybark Close, Spotted Gum Road, Eucalyptus Drive, Hibbertia Place, Peppermint Gum place and Ironbark Close. Although the naming of the streets seems only vaguely related to what was there before houses arrived, and many streets named for plants contain not a single representative specimen.

Westleigh was originally a housing estate west of Quarter Sessions Road. A small parcel of land was opened at the same time on the eastern side of Quarter Sessions Rd and this include Gum Blossom Drive and Bottle Brush Road. While classified as Thornleigh West for it postal address it was given a Westleigh address in the 1980s. This parcel of land was owned by a large home unit construction firm—RDC who built many project homes in Gum Blossom Drive. This company closed and the remaining land was sold to private parties in 1968.

In 2016, the Hornsby Shire purchased 34 hectares of land from Sydney Water in Westleigh, intending to use this land as public open space for recreation.

==Geography==

Westleigh is bordered by Dural, Cherrybrook, Pennant Hills, Thornleigh and Hornsby. Berowra Valley National Park lies directly west of Westleigh.
Defined by its geographical make-up, Westleigh is clearly divided at the midpoint of Quarter Sessions Road. This may be seen in a sudden absence of houses, as drivers find themselves immersed in a thick bushland foliage. The sweeping dip in this section has also proven a non-fatal but dangerous hazard for drivers throughout Westleigh&#x27;s history, however reflective signs appear to have minimised the danger to tired or reckless drivers. This deviation, constructed in 1978, was to eliminate the dangerous bend in the original alignment as the road followed the edge of the gully. The original alignment still exists as Warrigal Drive, although in very poor condition, passing by the entrance to the former rubbish tip, and providing a second access to the Bushfire Brigade.

===North side===
The northern side of this bushland hiatus is the &quot;newer&quot; side of Westleigh, and features far fewer public amenities than those the southern side. The area was subdivided in 1974 and homebuilding commenced in 1977. The loop constructed at the northern end of Quarter Sessions Road has completely eradicated all traces of the former sandstone quarry which lay to the western side.

===South side===
The southern side of this division is the older side of Westleigh. Westleigh&#x27;s public amenities are largely concentrated in this area, including the family friendly Westleigh Village Shopping Centre as well as nearby Cellars, day-care centre, dentist, petrol/service station, and a public primary school (Thornleigh West Public School) with a number of recreational features. In about 1983, the last areas of the south side were redeveloped. &quot;Berenbel&quot;, a property at the end of Duffy Avenue, and another small market garden property at the corner of Duffy Avenue and Quarter Sessions Road disappeared beneath suburban housing.

A housing &quot;village&quot; is built there, named &quot;Sanctuary Gardens&quot; in addition to the longer-established &quot;Settlers&#x27; Green&quot; (named in recognition of the &quot;stalwart people who, by their actions opened the door to the migrants of the world and thus the nations development.&quot;). The border of Westleigh was moved from the Duffy Ave/Quarter Sessions Road intersection, to further up Duffy Avenue. Housing estates, including &quot;Wild Ash Grove&quot; and &quot;Huntingdale&quot; (in Thornleigh), brought more people – primarily families – into the southern side of the suburb around their establishment, boosting the suburb&#x27;s population as reflected in the population changes between the 2001 and 2006 censuses.

==Parks and recreation==
Two large public parks are in the south side of Westleigh: Oakleigh Oval, home to Thornleigh Baseball Club as well as Thornleigh Thunder Football Club, and Ruddock Park (named to honour Max Ruddock, father of politician Phillip Ruddock, after his death in 1976 to acknowledge his official interest in the local Elouera Bushland Reserve), which was the site of annual &quot;Carols by Candlelight&quot; and summer outdoor movies. Play equipment, public toilets, and barbecue facilities are all freely available. Ruddock Park&#x27;s tennis courts are available for hire: keys are held with the newsagent in the shopping centre nearby. A fenced off-leash dog park was established in about 2005 between Ruddock Park and the shopping centre. On 28 June 2018 it was announced that Westleigh Waterboard would be transformed into a multi-use recreational parkland with $40 Million funding from the Hornsby Shire.

==Commercial Areas==
Westleigh Village Shopping Centre, includes two Supermarkets, Aldi and Mint-Fresh IGA, along with a Butcher, Chemist, Baker and other specialist stores. The shopping village has undergone major renovations since 2016.

==Surrounding bushland==

Most of the suburb (except the southern side) is surrounded by natural bushland, which at times poses significant bush fire danger. On the western side of the suburbs runs the Great North Walk, which can be accessed from multiple points within the suburb. Heading north, the walk leads to a nearby water hole &quot;fragile rock&quot;, also known as &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, which is an excellent spot for kids to enjoy themselves. It features a large ten metre cliff sometimes used for diving, underwater tunnels and minor waterfalls. However, swimmers should be aware of pollution levels when swimming in &quot;any&quot; bushland water system, especially within 48 hours of rainfall. Furthermore, swimmers should be aware of the potential danger of the area, including the death of a 20-year-old woman after slipping and becoming &quot;impaled&quot; on a tree in 2007. &quot;Refuge Rock&quot; is a large area of sandstone rock in the bushland to the west, used for training of soldiers prior to WWII; bushwalkers can observe blast marks from mortar fire in the sandstone.

On the eastern side of the suburb between Warrigal Rd and Gum Blossum Drive lies an area of scrub and bushland formerly occupied by the council rubbish dump (closed in 1962), the former sewerage dump (closed in about 1964), and the Sydney Water Reservoir which was completed in 1967. The former council animal pound existed at the northern edge of the old tip, and the southern area was used for a number of years by the Sydney County Council for seasoning timber power poles (&quot;The Pole Yards&quot;). This area is now often used by a wide manner of &#x27;Westleighians&#x27; for activities including walking, motorbike riding and general tom-foolerly which has been happening for over 30 years. Due to the existence of the local Sydney Water property, the disused rubbish dump and adjacent area is commonly locally referred to as the &#x27;Waterboard&#x27;). Since it has been used for illegal rubbish dumping, public access is illegal and measures have been taken to block access to this area, including local rangers / volunteers patrolling the area. In 2015, Hornsby council purchased 34 hectares of this land to be used for recreational use, such as sporting fields. The local rural fire brigade have permission to use the area for training (including live fire drills), and are somewhat regularly seen carrying out various forms of training and drills.

==Transport==
Commuters have easy access to Thornleigh railway station. CDC NSW provide bus services to nearby Normanhurst railway station and Hornsby railway station on the Sydney Trains Northern Line.

<doc id="1110725" wikidata="Q1707194" url="?curid=1110725" title="Coco (folklore)">
<text>The Coco or Coca (also known as the Cucuy, Cuco, Cuca, Cucu, Cucuí or El-Cucuí) is a mythical ghost-like monster, equivalent to the bogeyman, found in Spain and Portugal. Those beliefs have also spread in many Hispanophone and Lusophone countries. It can also be considered an Iberian version of a bugbear as it is a commonly used figure of speech representing an irrational or exaggerated fear. The Cucuy is a male being while Cuca is a female version of the mythical monster. The &quot;monster&quot; will come to the house of disobedient children at night and take them away.

==Names and etymology==
The myth of the &quot;Coco&quot;, or &quot;Cucuy&quot;, originated in northern Portugal and Galicia. According to the Real Academia Española, the word &quot;coco&quot; derives from the Galician and Portuguese &quot;côco&quot; , which means &quot;coconut&quot;. The word &quot;coco&quot; is used in colloquial speech to refer to the human head in Spanish. &quot;Coco&quot; also means &quot;skull&quot;. The words &quot;cocuruto&quot; in Portuguese and &quot;cocorota&quot; in Spanish both means &quot;the crown of the head&quot; or &quot;the highest place&quot; and with the same etymology in Galicia, &quot;crouca&quot; means &quot;head&quot;, from proto-Celtic &quot;*krowkā-&quot;, with variant &quot;cróca&quot;; and either &quot;coco&quot; or &quot;cuca&quot; means &quot;head&quot; in both Portuguese and Galician. It is cognate with Cornish &quot;crogen&quot;, meaning &quot;skull&quot;, and Breton &quot;krogen ar penn&quot;, also meaning &quot;skull&quot;. In Irish, &quot;clocan&quot; means &quot;skull&quot;.

Many Latin American countries refer to the monster as El &quot;Cuco&quot;. In northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, where there is a large Hispanic population, it is referred to by its anglicized name, &quot;the Coco Man&quot;. In Brazilian folklore, the monster is referred to as &quot;Cuca&quot; and pictured as a female humanoid alligator, derived from the Portuguese &quot;coca&quot;, a dragon.

==Legend==
In Spain, Portugal, and Latin America, parents sometimes invoke the Coco or Cuca as a way of discouraging their children from misbehaving; they sing lullabies or tell rhymes warning their children that if they don&#x27;t obey their parents, &quot;el Coco&quot; will come and get them and then eat them.

It is not the way the Coco looks but what it does that scares most. It is a child eater and a kidnapper; it may immediately devour the child, leaving no trace, or it may spirit the child away to a place of no return, but it only does this to disobedient children. It is on the lookout for children&#x27;s misbehavior from the rooftops; it takes the shape of any dark shadow and stays watching. It represents the opposite of the guardian angel and is frequently compared to the devil. Others see the Coco as a representation of the deceased of the local community.

The oldest known rhyme about the Coco, which originated in the 17th century, is in the &quot;Auto de los desposorios de la Virgen&quot; by Juan Caxés.

The rhyme has evolved over the years, but still retains its original meaning:
The Portuguese lullaby recorded by José Leite de Vasconcelos tells Coca to go to the top of the roof. In other versions of the same lullaby, the name of Coca is changed to that of &quot;papão negro&quot; (black eater), the name of another bogeyman.
The traditional Brazilian lullaby is as follows, with the &quot;Cuca&quot; as a female humanoid alligator:
Both Brazilians and Portuguese also have a bogeyman version, which sometimes acquires regional colors where the bogeyman (the shape-shifting &quot;Bicho Papão&quot; is a monster that is shaped by what the child fears most) is a small owl, &quot;murucututu&quot;, or other birds of prey that could be on the roof of homes at night (in Brazil) or a mysterious old man with a bag who is also waiting on the roof of the house (in Portugal).
Verses and songs were used in pre-Roman Iberia to transmit history to the younger generations, as told by ancient authors. Sallust said the mothers sang the military feats of the fathers to incite the children to battle. He was later quoted by Servius, who emphasised that it was the role of the mothers to remember and teach the young men about the war feats of their fathers. Silius Italicus added more; he said that the young warriors sang songs in their native language while hitting their shields in the rhythm of the songs and that they were well versed in magic. Strabo, too, commented that history was recorded in verse.

During the Portuguese and Spanish colonization of Latin America, the legend of the Coco was spread to countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.

==Physical representations==
There is no general description of the &quot;cucuy&quot;, as far as facial or body descriptions, but it is stated that this shapeshifting being is extremely horrible to look at. The &quot;coco&quot; is variously described as a shapeless figure, sometimes a hairy monster, that hides in closets or under beds and eats children that misbehave when they are told to go to bed.

===Mythical animals===

Coca is also the name of a female dragon who featured in various medieval celebrations in the Iberian Peninsula. In Portugal one still survives in Monção; she fights in some sort of medieval tournament with Saint George during the Corpus Christi celebrations. She is called &quot;Santa Coca&quot; (&quot;Saint Coca&quot;), an allusion to the Irish saint, or &quot;Coca rabicha&quot; (&quot;Tailed Coca&quot;). If she defeats Saint George by scaring the horse, there will be a bad year for the crops and famine; if the horse and Saint George win by cutting off one of her ears with earring and her tongue, the crops will be fertile. Oddly enough, the people cheer for Saint Coca. In Galicia there are still two dragon cocas, one in Betanzos and the other in Redondela. The legend says that the dragon arrived from the sea and was devouring the young women until she was killed in combat by the young men
of the city. In Monção, the legend says, she lives in the Minho; in Redondela she lives in the Ria of Vigo. The dragon shared the same name that was given in Portuguese and Spanish to the cog (a type of ship), and although used mainly for trade, it was also a war vessel common in medieval warfare and piracy raids on coastal villages.

The oldest reference to Coca is in the book &quot;Livro 3 de Doações de D. Afonso III&quot; from the year 1274, where it is referred to as a big fish that appears on the shore: &quot;And if by chance any whale or sperm whale or mermaid or coca or dolphin or Musaranha or other large fish that resembles some of these die in Sesimbra or Silves or elsewhere[.]&quot;

In Catalonia, the &quot;Cuca fera de Tortosa&quot; was first documented in 1457. It is a zoomorphic figure that looks like a tortoise with a horned spine, dragon claws and a dragon head. The legend says she had to dine every night on three cats and three children. This legend of the Coca can be compared to the one of Peluda or Tarasque.

In Brazil, the Coco appears as a humanoid female alligator called &quot;Cuca&quot;. She is dressed like a woman with ugly hair and a sack on her back. Cuca appears as one of the main villains in children&#x27;s books Sítio do Picapau Amarelo by Monteiro Lobato, but in the books she appears like a powerful witch that attacks innocent children. Artists illustrating these books depicted the Cuca as an anthropomorphic alligator. She is an allusion to &quot;Coca&quot;, a dragon from the folklore of Portugal and Galicia.

===Heads===

Traditionally in Portugal, however, the &quot;coco&quot; is represented by an iron pan with holes, to represent a face, with a light inside; or by a vegetable lantern carved from a pumpkin with two eyes and a mouth, which is left in dark places with a light inside to scare people. In the Beiras, heads carved on pumpkins, called &quot;coca&quot;, would be carried by the village boys, stuck on top of wooden stakes.

The same name [Coca] is given to the pumpkin perforated with the shape of a face, with a candle burning in the inside—this gives the idea of a skull on fire—that the boys on many lands of our Beira carry stuck on a stick.

An analogous custom was first mentioned by Diodorus Siculus (XIII.56.5;57.3), in which Iberian warriors, after the battle of Selinunte, in 469 BC, would hang the heads of the enemies on their spears. According to Rafael López Loureiro, this carving representation would be a milenar tradition from the Celtiberian region that spread all over the Iberian Peninsula.

The autumnal and childish custom of emptying pumpkins and carving on its bark, eyes, nose and mouth looking for a sombre expression, far from being a tradition imported by a recent Americanizing cultural mimicry, is a cultural trait in ancient Iberian Peninsula.

This representation would be related to the Celtic cult of the severed heads in the Iberian peninsula. According to João de Barros, the name of the &quot;coconut&quot; derived from &quot;coco&quot; and was given to the fruit by the sailors of Vasco da Gama, c.1498, because it reminded them of this mythical creature.

This bark from which the pome receives its vegetable nourishment, which is through its stem, has an acute way, which wants to resemble a nose placed between two round eyes, from where it throws the sprout, when it wants to be born; by reason of such figure, it was called by our [men] coco, name imposed by the women on anything they want to put fear to the children, this name thus remained, as no one knows another.

Rafael Bluteau (1712) observes that the coco and coca were thought to look like skulls, in Portugal:

Coco or Coca. We make use of these words to frighten children, because the inner shell of the Coco has on its outside surface three holes giving it the appearance of a skull.

In the first half of the 20th century, the coca was an integral part of festivities like All Souls&#x27; Day and the ritual begging of Pão-por-Deus. The tradition of Pão-por-Deus, already mentioned in the 15th century, is a ritual begging for bread and cakes, done door to door by children, though in the past poor beggars would also take part. Its purpose is to share the bread or treats gathered door to door with the dead of the community, who were eagerly awaited and arrived at night in the shape of butterflies or little animals, during the traditional magusto. In Portugal, depending on the region, the Pão-por-Deus assumes different names: &quot;santoro&quot; or &quot;santorinho&quot;, &quot;dia dos bolinhos&quot; (cookies day), or &quot;fieis de deus&quot;. This same tradition extends to Galicia, where it is called &quot;migallo&quot;. It has a close resemblance with the traditions of souling or nowadays trick-or-treating. While the Pão-por-Deus or Santoro is the bread or offering given to the souls of the dead, the Molete or Samagaio is the bread or offering that is given when a child is born.

In this same city of Coimbra, where we find ourselves today, it is customary for groups of children to walk on the streets, on the 31st October and 1st and 2nd November, at nightfall, with a hollow pumpkin with holes that were cut out pretending to be eyes, nose and mouth, as if it was a skull, and with a stump of candle lit from within, to give it a more macabre look.

In Coimbra the begging mentions &quot;Bolinhos, bolinhós&quot; and the group brings an emptied pumpkin with two holes representing the eyes of a personage and a candle lit in the inside [...] another example of the use of the pumpkin or gourd as a human representation, is in the masks of the muffled young men during the desfolhada, the communal stripping of the maize, in Santo Tirso de Prazins (Guimarães), which after, they carry hoisted on a stick and with a candle in the inside, and leave them stuck on any deserted place to put fear to who is passing by.

To ensure that the souls found their way back home, the &quot;Botador de almas&quot;, whose mission was to lay souls (botar almas), would go every night through valleys and mountains and up on trees ringing a little bell, or carrying a lantern and singing a prayer to the souls. Every Portuguese village had one. Calling and singing to the souls is an ancient tradition done either by one person alone or in groups and it has many names: &quot;lançar as almas&quot;, &quot;encomendar as almas&quot;, &quot;amentar as almas&quot;, &quot;deitar as almas&quot;, &quot;cantar às almas santas&quot;.

The &quot;serandeiros&quot; are disguised young men, covered with a blanket, a bed sheet or a hooded cloak. They carry a staff (a stick of quince or of honeyberry, about their own height) in one hand, and in the other they carry a small bundle of basil or apples that they make the girls that take part of the desfolhada smell, or with which they tickle people&#x27;s cheeks; sometimes, to play a prank, they bring stinging nettles. When a girl recognizes the serandeiro or if she recognizes her boyfriend masked as a serandeiro, she throws him an apple brought from home. The serandeiros represent the spirits of the dead, the spirits of nature.

The heads would have protective and healing powers, protecting people and communities. They would also be cherished for their divinatory, prophetic and healing powers. The display places for the Iron Age severed heads were in the inside or outside of buildings with a preference for public places, with streets and people passing by and always preferring high places.

===Our Ladies===
In Portugal, rituals among the Catholic religious order of Our Lady of Cabeza, a Black Madonna, include the offering of heads of wax to the Lady, praying the Hail Mary while keeping a small statue of Our Lady on top of the head; the pilgrims pray with their own heads inside a hole in the wall of the chapel. The Chapel of Our Lady of the Heads (Nossa Senhora das Cabeças) situated northwest of the ruins of the Roman era temple of Our Lady of the Heads (Orjais, Covilhã) evidences a continuity in the use of a sacred space that changed from a pagan worship cult area to a Christian one and continued to be a place of worship for centuries after. According to Pedro Carvalho, the pre-Roman findings and the unusual location of the ruins inside an 8th-century BC hillfort suggest it was the place of a pre-Roman cult.

The Lady of the Head and Lady of the Heads are two of the many names given to Our Lady. Several of her names are thought to be of pre-Roman origin. Names like &quot;Senhora da Noite&quot; (), &quot;Senhora da Luz&quot; (&quot;Lady of the Light&quot;), &quot;Señora de Carbayo&quot; (&quot;Lady of the Oak Tree&quot;) are spread all over the peninsula. In Portugal alone 972 titles for Our Lady have been found in churches, altars and images, not including the names of villages and places. Spain has a similar proliferation of titles for Our Lady.

The common element to all these names is the title Lady. But the title &quot;Senhora&quot; (Portuguese) or &quot;Señora&quot; (Spanish) is of Latin origin, and derives from the Latin &quot;senior&quot;; thus there had to be another one of pre-Roman origin. In ancient times the titles that were used in Portugal by the ladies of the court were &quot;Meana&quot; (me Ana) or &quot;Miana&quot; (mi Ana) and &quot;Meona&quot; (me Ona); these words meant the same as miLady, that is, &quot;Ana&quot; and &quot;Ona&quot; were synonyms of &quot;Senhora&quot; and &quot;Dona&quot;. &quot;Ana&quot; is the name of the river Guadiana, thus pre-Roman in origin. &quot;Ana&quot; is also the name of a goddess of Irish mythology.

In the village of Ponte, parish of Mouçós, on a hill that overlooks the River Corgo, there is a chapel called Santo Cabeço which legend says was built by the &quot;mouros encantados&quot;. On the wall facing south there is a hole, where legend says the &quot;mouros&quot; used to put their head to hear the sound of the sea. The local people also have the custom of putting their head inside the hole: some to hear the whisper that is similar to the waves of the sea, others to heal headaches.

In Alcuéscar, Spain, a legend says that a princess exhibited a stall of skulls and human bones.

===Hooded cloak===

In Portugal, &quot;coca&quot; is a name for a hooded cloak; it was also the name of the traditional hooded black wedding gown still in use at the beginning of the 20th century. In Portimão during the holy week celebrations, in the &quot;procissão dos Passos&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Procesión de los Pasos&quot;), a procession organized by the Catholic brotherhoods, the herald, a man dressed with a black hooded cloak that covered his face and had three holes for the eyes and mouth, led the procession and announced the death of Christ. This man was either named coca, farnicoco, (farricunco, farricoco from Latin &quot;far, farris&quot; and coco) or death. The name &quot;coca&quot; was given to the cloak and to the man who wore the cloak.

In 1498, the Portuguese King Manuel I gave permission to the Catholic brotherhood of the Misericórdia to collect the bones and remains from the gallows of those that had been condemned to death and put them in a grave every year on All Saints&#x27; Day. The brotherhood in a procession, known as Procissão dos Ossos, were followed by the &quot;farricocos&quot;, who carried the tombs and collected the bones.

In the travels of the Baron Rozmital, 1465–1467, a paragraph was written commenting on the traditional mourning clothes of the Portuguese of that time. The relatives of the deceased who accompanied his funeral would be clad in white and hooded like monks, but the paid mourners would be arrayed in black.&quot;[...] white was 
worn as the garb of mourning until the time of King Manuel, at the death of whose aunt, Philippa, black was adopted for the first time in Portugal as the symbol of sorrow for the dead&quot;.

===Giants===

In Ribadeo, two giant figures represent &quot;el coco y la coca&quot; that dance at the sound of drummers and Galician bagpipe players.

===The land of the dead===

The &#x27;land of the dead&#x27; is a mythic land which appears in traditions from various cultures around the ancient world.

Probably the oldest mention of a mythic land of the dead located in the Iberian Peninsula is in the Lebor Gabála Érenn.

The legends of Portugal and Spain speak of an enchanted land, the Mourama, the land where an enchanted people, the Mouros (Celtic *MRVOS) dwell under the earth in Portugal and Galicia. The lore of Galicia says that &quot;In Galicia there are two overlapped people: a part lives on the surface of the land; they are the Galician people, and the other in the subsoil, the Mouros&quot;. Mourama is the otherworld, the world of the dead from where everything comes back.

The Mourama is ruled by an enchanted being who is called &quot;rei Mouro&quot; (king Mouro). His daughter is the princesa Moura (princess Moura), a shapeshifter who changes herself into a snake, also called &quot;bicha Moura&quot;, or can even be seen riding a dragon.

== In popular culture==
In the last chapter of the work of Miguel de Cervantes, the epitaph of &quot;Don Quijote&quot; identifies him as the scarecrow and &quot;el coco&quot;.
&quot;Que Viene el Coco&quot;, a painting that depicts a cloaked, menacing figure, was painted by Goya in 1799.

Pennywise from Stephen King&#x27;s miniseries &quot;It&quot; calls himself the &quot;eater of worlds and of children.&quot;

The Cuco appears in &quot;AdventureQuest Worlds&quot;. It is among the creatures that attack Terra da Festa before the Carnaval Party. The Cuco resembles a Carnaval version of Blister. The Cuca later appears where it is depicted as a humanoid alligator in witch attire.

A wealthy family of Cucuys appear in &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot; episode &quot;Alex Gives Up&quot;. Their abilities include shapeshifting in which they can change their face to a dark-gray skull shape, with large red eyes. The family consists of Carlos Cucuy (portrayed by David Barrera), Julie Cucuy (portrayed by Roxana Brusso), and Lisa Cucuy (portrayed by Samantha Boscarino). Staying somewhat true to folklore, they enjoy scaring children. Surprisingly, they are afraid of werewolves which evident at the end of the episode when the parents jump overboard their boat once they find out Mason, the boyfriend of Alex Russo, is in fact a werewolf. Interestingly, Lisa Cucuy wasn&#x27;t phased by the reveal and only jumped overboard once she was rejected by Mason.

The 2013 Universal Studios Hollywood &quot;Halloween Horror Nights&quot; event featured El Cuco (here known as El Cucuy) at a Scarezone who was voiced by Danny Trejo.

On the television series &quot;Grimm&quot;, in the fifth episode of season three, El Cucuy poses as a little, old lady who answers the prayers of crime victims, changes into beast form, and brutally slays criminals, thus rendering a version of vigilante justice that is a departure from the standard El Cucuy legend.

Stephen King&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;The Outsider&quot; (and the 2020 TV miniseries based on King&#x27;s novel) features a variation of El Cuco as its main villain.

El Cucuy is featured in &quot;The Casagrandes&quot; episode &quot;Monster Cash,&quot; voiced by Eric Bauza. Carl Casagrande starts a ghost tour revolving around El Cucuy after hearing about it from his grandmother Rosa. Enlisting the assistance from Lalo, Sergio, and Stanley, Carl invites Ronnie Anne, Bobby, Adelaide, and Vito to partake in it. Afterwards, Carl, Lalo, and Sergio soon find that the El Cucuy legend appears to be true when it shows up and haunts Carl. It leaves when Carl does his chores and refunds the money he made. When El Cucuy visits the hot dog vendor Bruno, he was spooked until it was discovered to be a disguise worn by Rosa.

The Mexican stop motion series &quot;Frankelda&#x27;s Book of Spooks&quot; episode &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Out of Darkness&quot; features Coco Jr., the son of the child stealing Coco, depicted as a furry creature with eight limbs and a horned lizard-like face. A music lover, Coco Jr. steals childhood passions for music and the arts to create a ghostly orchestra and tricks a bullied theremin player named Tere into giving away her talents to him.

El Cucuy is the nickname of American mixed martial artist Tony Ferguson.

<doc id="1110730" wikidata="Q3401675" url="?curid=1110730" title="Latvia's First Party">
<text>The Latvia&#x27;s First Party () was a socially conservative, Christian-democratic right-wing political party in Latvia. It merged with Latvian Way to form Latvia&#x27;s First Party/Latvian Way in 2007.

It was founded on 25 May 2002, led by Ēriks Jēkabsons and Ainārs Šlesers. The party included a number of priests from all the major branches of Christianity in Latvia (Lutheran, Catholic, Orthodox and Baptist) as well as members of &quot;Jaunā Paaudze (New Generation)&quot;, a charismatic church. As a result, it was informally nicknamed &quot;the party of priests&quot; or the &quot;pastors&#x27; party&quot;.

Using populist promises and support from religious organisations, it won 9.5% of the popular vote and 10 out of 100 seats in the Saeima after the elections of October 5, 2002 and joined all the coalition governments since that time until its dissolution. In the 2006 elections, it ran together with Latvian Way; the bloc took 8.58% but also won 10 seats in parliament. The parties merged in the following years.

==Political positions==

The party proclaimed itself to be a strong supporter of the traditional family. It sponsored a constitutional amendment that defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, unambiguously excluding homosexual unions. Several prominent members of the party had been labelled as homophobic by its critics. E.g. Jānis Šmits who was appointed to the position of chairman of the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee has called his parliamentary colleagues to get familiar with religious writings &quot;in case they can actually, read&quot;, quoting a passage from the Book of Moses that could be loosely translated as: &quot;men having gay sex must die, and their corpses must be left soaking in their own blood&quot;. Additionally, Latvijas Pirmā Partija members had several times made public statements saying that they don&#x27;t feel that there is a necessity for a gay pride march in Riga, which allegedly contradicts the Freedom of Speech and Peaceful Assembly enshrined in the Constitution of Latvia. The pressure group Mozaīka (Mosaic) have mostly organized Gay Rights Rallies that some religious organizations see as overt frontal attacks on the Latvian way of life. Mozaīka have stated that they have done this to raise awareness for the rights of gays in Latvia via international media. Between annual rallies Mozaīka has done little to slowly generate improved understanding of gays in Latvia and has preferred to follow its strategy of shock tactics. ().

Some have alleged that quoting the Bible as a reference point for legislation can be viewed as unconstitutional, since Latvia is a secular state, where religion is separate from the state ( of the Constitution of Latvia). Supporters of the First Party denied that the &quot;separation of church argument&quot; can properly be used to keep people of faith silent when it comes to issues of morality or the passing or failing of laws that have strong moral dimensions. The ideas under the separation of church and state doctrine have to do with (a) the state not being allowed to control the church, or (b) the church not being allowed to control the state. All legislators have the right to vote their conscience.

Economically, First Party supported the existing status quo in Latvian economics. Compared to other parties, it was less concerned with budget deficits and believed that the government should do everything possible to stimulate economic growth, even at the cost of possibly running deficits. In its first parliamentary election in 2002, First Party also ran on an anti-corruption agenda. In the next election, it emphasized its competence and experience (in particular, the achievements of its leader, Šlesers, as the Minister of Transportation).

On ethnic relations, First Party was viewed as more Russian-friendly than most of the Latvian political parties. Most of the party&#x27;s supporters were ethnically Latvian, but it does not attempt to appeal to Latvian nationalism and has a number of ethnic minorities among its voters. Recently, it created a &quot;Russian centre&quot; for its ethnically Russian members.

The leadership of the party included several prominent businessmen, most notably, its leader Ainars Šlesers. His critics attacked the First Party, saying that it was little more than a business project to further Slesers&#x27; interests in real estate business. His supporters pointed to many examples of improvement in Latvia&#x27;s transportation infrastructure, including the airport and the national railroad.

Largely because of the influence of the First Party, a new cabinet-level ministry was developed, The Ministry of Children and Family Affairs. The position of Minister of Children and Family Affairs was held by Baptist pastor Ainars Bastiks from 2002 to 2009. This ministry has emphasized reducing the number of children in Latvia&#x27;s orphan care system. One strategy has been the development and implementation of a new national foster care recruiting and training program, which has grown considerably every year since 2004. Another emphasis of this ministry has to do with the elevation of the importance of the &quot;father&quot; in Latvian society. The national holiday, &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot; has been proposed with the corresponding encouragements for fathers to take their paternal responsibilities seriously. Stiffer penalties for &quot;deadbeat dads&quot; who avoid paying child support have been enacted.

==Scandals==
The first chairman of the party, Ēriks Jēkabsons, resigned as Minister of the Interior. Later, due to various disagreements about the direction that the party was taking, he left the party itself and became an independent MP.

Following the 2005 municipal election, a Jūrmala businessman Germans Milušs attempted to bribe the members of city council to ensure the election of Juris Hlevickis, a First Party member, as Jūrmala mayor. Hlevickis fell one vote short of becoming the mayor and, in 2007, both Milušs and Hlevickis were convicted and received prison sentences.

During the bribery attempt, Milušs&#x27;s phone conversations were wiretapped by Latvian police. The wiretaps contain cryptic conversations between Milušs and Ainārs Šlesers, which were leaked to national TV in 2006. This resulted in the resignation of Šlesers as the Minister of Transportation on March 17, 2006. Šlesers was not however charged or convicted of bribery and returned to the position of the Minister of Transportation in November 2006.

<text>Raymond Morris Hadley (born 27 September 1954) is an Australian talkback radio broadcaster and a rugby league football commentator for Channel Nine. He presents 2GB Sydney&#x27;s Monday to Friday morning show, and leads the Continuous Call Team, a rugby league-based talkback radio panel program.

==Early life==
Ray Hadley was born in 1954 and raised in a &quot;housing commission house in Dundas Valley&quot; Sydney but later went to live with his grandparents on an Eungai Rail farm near Stuart&#x27;s Point on the mid north coast of New South Wales.

While working as a cab driver, he was offered casual work at the radio station 2UE after giving the then news director, Mark Collier, a ride in his taxi. By 1982, he was covering sports including rugby league and horseracing.

==Radio career==

===2GB===
In December 2001, Hadley joined 2GB to present the weekend rugby league coverage but when fellow 2UE presenter Alan Jones moved to 2GB from 2UE in April 2002, he began presenting the morning show as well.

Hadley&#x27;s talkback show started in a traditional local community and state-based current affairs format but now includes federal politics. His favourite music genre is country (both traditional and modern). Hadley&#x27;s opening theme is &quot;Murrumbidgee&quot; by The Wolverines, while the closing theme is the instrumental &quot;Last Date&quot; from country pianist Floyd Cramer.

Hadley&#x27;s program from 9am to midday is also broadcast to 4BC Brisbane, 2CC Canberra and stations across regional New South Wales, Queensland and parts of Victoria. Some of these stations are part of the Southern Cross Austereo Triple M network and are some of the stations which also broadcast the Continuous Call Team.

In May 2011 he became the highest-rating radio announcer on Australian radio with 20.1% of the audience, until being beaten by the top rating Ross and John breakfast program on opposite number 3AW in Melbourne a year later.

On 19 May 2011 Hadley hung up on 7 News reporter Lee Jeloscek during a phone interview. Hadley took offence that Jeloscek wanted to correct something he asserted was suggested on-air before the interview began, and Hadley cut off Jeloscek mid-sentence telling his listeners: 
No hang on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen to me! Listen to me! Listen to me! Goodbye Lee. You seem to forget, Lee, it&#x27;s the Ray Hadley morning program...

Hadley has been credited with discovering Samoan country singer Sam Ah Chookoon aka Mr Cowboy 62 in 2019.

In November 2024, Hadley announced that he would be retiring from radio after 43 years of service. His final morning show will air on 2GB on 13 December 2024.

===Awards===
Hadley has been named the best Radio Sports Broadcaster at the &#x27;RAWARDS&#x27; for 8 out of the past 11 years, and was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday 2002 Honours List for services to rugby league and fund-raising initiatives for charitable organisations.

Hadley won an accolade at the 2006 ACRAs (also known as the RAWARDS) for &quot;Best Current Affairs Presenter&quot;. He won that award again 2009 and became the first radio broadcaster to win both that award and best sports commentator. He has won 20 major ACRA Radio awards since 1987.

In December 2021, Hadley was added to the Sydney Cricket Ground Media Hall of Honour.

==Television==
After commencing as a sports reporter on Channel 7, Hadley was recruited to Channel 9 as part of &quot;The Footy Show&quot;, along with his radio and rugby league colleague Steve &quot;Blocker&quot; Roach, appearing between 1994 and 1998. He also made a one-off appearance on &quot;The Footy Show&quot; in 2005 in a forum to discuss brawling and antagonism between Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs supporters during a game against the Brisbane Broncos at Telstra Stadium. Hadley has also appeared in TV commercials, and for 17 years was spruiking the budget menswear establishment Lowes.

During 2010, he appeared on &quot;The Matty Johns Show&quot; on the Seven Network, an NRL-focused program hosted by Matthew Johns.

Also in 2010, Hadley was signed by Sky News Australia to present a weekly current affairs programme entitled &quot;Hadley!&quot;. The programme aired on Wednesday nights. , Hadley resigned from Sky News Australia after only four episodes, reportedly due to &quot;differences&quot; and staff not wanting to work with him.

In October 2011, Hadley was signed up by Channel 9 to commentate on the 2011 Rugby World Cup semi-final match between the Wallabies and the All Blacks but was not invited to return.

In 2012, he returned to The Footy Show as a panellist on the &quot;Five in the Bin&quot; segment, commentating alongside Peter Sterling and Paul Vautin on Channel 9&#x27;s rugby league coverage.

Hadley was one of Channel 9&#x27;s main play-by-play commentators mainly commentating on Thursday and Friday night games until leaving the position at the end of the 2018.

==Controversies==

===Australian Communications and Media Authority===
Hadley has been repeatedly censured by the ACMA for a range of offences. In 2012, Hadley threatened a protester outside 2GB&#x27;s premises and later broadcast the protester&#x27;s name and address on air. It emerged during the investigation that Hadley had got the man&#x27;s address wrong, instead broadcasting the address of somebody with the same name. The ACMA found against Hadley, finding he breached privacy regulations.

On 25 June 2012, Hadley broadcast a fabricated story stating that school children visiting Parliament would no longer be given snacks because of budget cuts. When the story was denied by the then Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan, Hadley called Swan a liar, stating Swan was &quot;complete boofhead that didn&#x27;t know what was happening&quot;. Despite repeated requests to retract the story, Hadley refused to do so and was found in breach of the code. Despite clear evidence, Hadley continued to deny that he had lied, stating on air, &quot;Through life you can&#x27;t win in an argument with the arbiter, with the referee and I can&#x27;t win in a battle with the Australian Communications and Media Authority despite the fact that I think I&#x27;m right,&quot; 

===Athens Olympics===
In 2004, Hadley was recorded in the middle of an outburst aimed at now-former 2GB news director Justin Kelly at the 2004 Athens Olympics, after Hadley&#x27;s call of an event at the Games was not used in a news bulletin. His use of the words &quot;fucking spastic&quot; offended organisations that deal with people which such conditions, and Ray made a quick apology and offered his services to the organisations affected for no charge, although none accepted his offer. Also during the outburst, the profane word &quot;fucking&quot; was used 20 times.

A dance version of the outburst was soon created and played on Triple J and soon widely distributed and played around the country.

===Suspension and reinstatement===
In February 2013, Hadley was suspended from 2GB after verbally abusing an employee, who recorded the event. Hadley responded to the suspension by contacting the station major shareholder and close friend, John Singleton, demanding to be returned to the air. Singleton agreed and overruled Network managing director Rob Loewenthal. Following this, Hadley gathered 2GB staff into a boardroom, apologised for his behaviour, repeatedly breaking down in tears. Hadley&#x27;s ratings dropped considerably following the release of details of the suspension. The employee in question sued Hadley,
 and the case was later settled out of court for an &quot;undisclosed sum&quot;, the settlement including an agreement that the recording of Hadley&#x27;s outburst be suppressed.

===2019 bullying allegations===
In March 2019, a social media post written by former 2GB staff member Chris Bowen contained allegations that he had been the victim of sixteen years of &quot;intense bullying&quot; while working at the station and that he had been subjected to &quot;out of control sheer rage&quot;. Bowen initially didn&#x27;t name the person he was referring to but later confirmed it was Hadley. Bowen&#x27;s allegations were supported for former 2GB staff member Mark Kennedy who also claimed that he too was a victim of Hadley&#x27;s alleged bullying.

Bowen said he had complained to 2GB management as far back as 2008 but nothing was done apart from being removed from Hadley&#x27;s program for a short period of time. A spokesperson for Macquarie Media said that they were unaware of any previous complaints having been made in relation to Bowen&#x27;s allegations. Hadley responded to Bowen&#x27;s allegations on his radio program and apologised to Bowen for &quot;any hurt&quot; he may have caused him. Bowen said he rejected Hadley&#x27;s apology, describing his comments as &quot;gaslighting&quot;.

Bowen&#x27;s allegation prompted ABC Television current affairs program &quot;7.30&quot; to do a special report about Hadley&#x27;s alleged bullying. On the program, Bowen along with former 2GB staff members Andrew Moore and Jesse Perez and former advisor to state premier Mike Baird, Imre Sulusinsky all made allegations relating to Hadley&#x27;s behaviour. Responding to the allegations made on &quot;7.30&quot;, 2GB said they had not received any formal complaints from Moore, Perez or Bowen.

In a statement, Hadley said he had been &quot;very public&quot; in relation to his past behaviour but if any of the allegations were substantiated, he would like to &quot;make amends&quot; with those affected by his alleged behaviour. He also said he couldn&#x27;t remember some of the alleged incidents involving Andrew Moore and that he would need more information to properly respond to questions put forward to him about his alleged behaviour involving Chris Bowen and Jesse Perez.

Radio broadcaster Tim Brunero publicly supported the allegations made by Perez. Brunero claimed he had witnessed Perez being summoned to Hadley&#x27;s studio before later returning and telling Brunero that Hadley had allegedly subjected to him to a &quot;blistering, shrieking tirade that&#x27;s only possible in a soundproof room&quot;. Brunero claimed he had asked Perez to write an account of his encounter with Hadley, and that as of 2019, it was still sitting in his email inbox.

Andrew Hornery, a columnist with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, also recalled an alleged encounter with Hadley in 2014 when Hadley referred to his sexual orientation on air which had prompted &quot;a deluge of homophobic abuse on social media&quot; from Hadley&#x27;s listeners. Hadley&#x27;s reference to Horney&#x27;s sexuality had allegedly occurred after Hornery had attempted to get in contact with Hadley to discuss a story about his ex-wife&#x27;s relationship with former rugby league footballer; Matt Parish. Hornery alleges Hadley said on air that he was &quot;very bitchy, if you know what I mean... And I&#x27;m not saying anything other than Mr Hornery admits to being openly gay and from time to time, he can by very bitchy when he writes his columns - very bitchy.&quot; Hornery claims Hadley had taken umbrage at describing his comments as homophobic, illustrated by his friendship with gay rugby league footballer; Ian Roberts.

In July 2019, it was reported Bowen had commenced legal proceedings in the New South Wales District Court against Hadley, relating to alleged workplace bullying. Hadley admitted on air to having received notice about Bowen commencing his legal action, and said that he had been subject to &quot;intense public scrutiny&quot; with the allegations made about his behaviour, and that he had already admitted to his &quot;previous shortcomings&quot;. Hadley also said his current colleagues would attest to the efforts he has made in recent years to improve his behaviour.

==Legal action==

===Andrew Voss===
In August 2011, a statue of rugby league caller, Ray Warren, co-funded by Ray Hadley&#x27;s radio station, 2GB, and Channel 9, was unveiled. Andrew Voss, noted on Channel 9 rugby league chat show, &quot;The Sunday Roast&quot;, that the statue was not a very good likeness. Ray Hadley used his radio show for the two days following the comments to launch attacks on Voss, labelling him a &quot;grub of the highest order&quot;, a &quot;moron&quot;, and claiming that the gulf between Ray Warren and Andrew Voss, both as commentators and as men, was immeasurable. It was claimed by Voss that Hadley&#x27;s reaction was due to a perceived snub 17 years earlier when Voss was offered a television role over Hadley.

Voss launched legal action against Hadley which was settled in 2012, with Voss receiving a financial settlement and public apology from Hadley.

===Greg Smith===
In April and May 2012, Ray Hadley, on his 2GB radio program, made allegations about then New South Wales Attorney General, Greg Smith, that he gave advice to his friend, Father Finian Egan, that an alleged victim of child sex abuse perpetrated by Egan in the 1970s and 1980s was seeking a $1,000,000 payment. Smith took Hadley to court, with both parties later dropping the case in exchange for Hadley refraining to broadcast further on the matter.

===Ray Williams===

Hadley was successfully sued by Liberal Hawkesbury MP Ray Williams. In July 2012 Hadley branded Williams a liar in a fabricated story over a scandal involving allegations of embezzled funds at the Hills Shire. Hadley falsely claimed Williams had known about it as far back as 2008 and covered it up. Three weeks before the trial was due to start, Hadley allegedly aggravated the defamation in a spray about another Liberal MP, Bart Bassett, and his appearance at ICAC. This prompted Williams&#x27; barrister, one of Sydney&#x27;s most formidable silks, Tom Blackburn, SC, to file a contempt of court motion, given that the spray had occurred as a jury was about to be empanelled. Hadley told his audience he looked &quot;forward to any Supreme Court acting involving Mr Williams or any other politician in New South Wales. It might be the only time in history that a so-called shock jock&#x27;s credibility is running higher than a politician&#x27;s credibility&quot;. The defamation trial was due to begin on Monday just passed (8 September) at 10am.
At the 11th hour, the parties sought an adjournment and a settlement was reached. On Wednesday morning Hadley issued a retraction, which he delivered live to air.
Williams said the terms of the settlement were confidential, but added: &quot;It&#x27;s been a long drawn-out process for me and my family. But we are pleased to advise that we are completely satisfied with the outcome.&quot;

===Ahmed court case===
Hadley was sued by Kim Anne Ahmed. Hadley attacked Mrs Ahmed on air because she continued to support her husband, who had been charged with aggravated indecent assault of a 17 year old employee, and because she took out an AVO against the young victim&#x27;s father. In an interview with the victim&#x27;s father in May 2008, Hadley described the fish and chip shop owner&#x27;s supporters as &quot;vile&quot;. Later in the broadcast, Hadley said that if either Mr Ahmed or his &quot;grub of a wife&quot; still owned their shop, &quot;they should completely and utterly be sent out of business&quot;. In December 2013, the judge ordered a $280,000 award to Mrs Ahmed, describing the broadcast as &quot;an unbridled tirade&quot; that came &quot;from the gutter&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hadley has two children with his former wife, Anne Marie. Hadley married Suzanne Kielty in 1994 and they had two daughters together. They separated in late 2010 but reconciled a few months later. They separated again in 2014. In May 2014 it was revealed that Hadley had unsuccessfully attempted to have Matt Parish, assistant coach of the New South Wales 2014 State of Origin team, fired from his role after Suzanne and Parish began their relationship.

Hadley married Sophie Baird in March 2021. Baird had worked as Hadley&#x27;s personal assistant for 16 years. She has two children from a previous marriage.

<doc id="1110732" wikidata="Q972981" url="?curid=1110732" title="David Duval">
<text>David Robert Duval (born November 9, 1971) is an American professional golfer and former World No. 1 Golfer who competed on the PGA Tour and currently plays on the PGA Tour Champions. Duval won 13 PGA Tour tournaments between 1997 and 2001; including one major title, The Open Championship in 2001.

Duval received his PGA Tour card in 1995, earning it after becoming two-time ACC Player of the Year, 1993 National Player of the Year, and playing two years on the Nike Tour (where he won twice). Between 1997 and 2000, Duval finished all four seasons top-5 on the PGA Tour&#x27;s money list, including being the leading money winner and scoring leader in 1998. In addition to his major title, he also won the 1997 Tour Championship and the 1999 Players Championship.

Following Duval&#x27;s victory at the 2001 Open Championship, he never won again on the PGA Tour and his performance declined dramatically due to injuries and various medical conditions. As a result, he lost his tour card in 2011. After his professional golf career slowed, he became a golf analyst and commentator, currently working for Golf Channel and ESPN.

==Background==
Duval was born in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of golf instructor and club professional Bob Duval and Diane Poole Duval, a member of the FSU Flying High Circus during college. His brother Brent was two years older, and sister Deirdre was five years younger. During his early years, his father was club professional at Timuquana Country Club, where he learned to play golf under his father&#x27;s guidance.

When David was nine, his brother Brent developed aplastic anemia. The family sought treatment at Rainbow Babies &amp; Children&#x27;s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, where David underwent surgery to donate bone marrow. The transplant was not successful, and Brent died as a result of sepsis on May 17, 1981 at age 12. Bob Duval was unable to cope, and moved out of the family home for a year. Counseling enabled him to reunite with his wife and children in 1982, and David continued to receive golf instruction from his father. In 1993, just as Duval was starting his professional golf career, his father again moved out of the family home, this time permanently.

==Amateur career==
He graduated from the Episcopal High School of Jacksonville in 1989, the same year he was the U.S. Junior Amateur champion. He continued his amateur career for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men&#x27;s golf team, where he was a four-time first-team All-American, two-time ACC Player of the Year, and 1993 National Player of the Year. While in college, he led an official PGA Tour event, the BellSouth Classic (which he would win as a professional), after three rounds.

==Professional career==

===Early success===
After two years on the Nike Tour where he won twice, he earned his PGA Tour card in 1995. Success came quickly, as Duval posted seven second-place finishes on the PGA Tour from 1995 to 1997, qualifying for the 1996 Presidents Cup and posting a 4–0–0 record for the victorious American team. But a PGA Tour victory eluded him until he won the Michelob Championship at Kingsmill in October 1997, and winning his next two tournaments in the same month, including the 1997 Tour Championship.

Duval led the PGA Tour money list in 1998, and also won the Vardon Trophy and Byron Nelson Award for lowest scoring average. He ended second on the 1997 and 1999 money lists, seventh in 2000 and eight in 2001. From 1997 to 2001, he won 13 PGA Tour tournaments, including the 1997 Tour Championship, the 1999 Players Championship, and the 2001 Open Championship, as well as the 2001 Dunlop Phoenix on the Japan Golf Tour and the 2000 World Cup (with Tiger Woods) internationally. He also tied for second in both the 1998 and 2001 Masters. Duval&#x27;s winning speech at the 2001 Open was welcomed by British commentators as &quot;delightfully modest and heartfelt&quot;.

Other career highlights include achieving the number one spot in the Official World Golf Ranking in March 1999 and shooting a 59 in the final round of the 1999 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic on the Palmer Course at PGA West in La Quinta, California. Duval made an eagle on the final hole to win the tournament by one shot. Before 1999, only two other golfers in PGA Tour history, Al Geiberger and Chip Beck, had posted a 59 in competition and no one had ever done so in a final round. When he won the Players Championship he became the first player in history to win on the same day as his father, Bob Duval, who won a Champions Tour event that same day. He also played on the victorious 1999 Ryder Cup team, as well as the 2002 team.

===Struggles===
After his Open Championship win, Duval entered a downward spiral in form that saw him drop to 80th on the money list in 2002 and 211th in 2003, prompting an extended break from the game. Numerous reasons have been postulated for the decline, including back, wrist and shoulder problems, personal difficulties and a form of vertigo. Duval has not won a tournament on the PGA Tour since his Open Championship victory in 2001. His last worldwide win was the Dunlop Phoenix Tournament in November 2001 on his 30th birthday. His 30s proved to be much less lucrative on the golf course.

Many commentators believed Duval&#x27;s career to be over but he returned to golf at the U.S. Open in 2004, where he shot 25 over par and missed the cut. Duval struggled with his best results until 2009 being a T-13 at the Deutsche Bank Championship in 2004 and a T-16 at the U.S. Open in 2006. He made the cut in only one PGA Tour event in 2005 but did finish in the top ten at the Dunlop Phoenix tournament in Japan.

===Comeback attempts===
Duval had a successful start to the 2006 season, making the cut in his first two tournaments, as well as a very respectable finish of T-16 at the U.S. Open at Winged Foot Golf Club, where his second round 68 was good enough for a tie as the best round of the tournament. Despite not reaching the same heights in the remaining two majors of the year, his performances continued a general upward trend, with none of the rounds of 80+ that had become so familiar in the previous years.

After a steady start to 2007 during the West Coast Swing, Duval once again disappeared from the tour. His mother died on July 17, and he later revealed that his wife was going through a difficult pregnancy. This prompted the PGA Tour to amend its medical exemption policies – and Duval was granted twenty starts for the next season.

After a lackluster first half of the following year, Duval reappeared on the leaderboard of the 2008 Open Championship, rekindling memories of his major victory. He shot 73-69-83-71 for the week and finished T-39.

In 2009, Duval used his final career money exemption on the PGA Tour. He made his first cut at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in February. However, he stormed back onto the golf scene with a T-2 finish at the U.S. Open at Bethpage Black. After going through sectional qualifying, Duval made the most of his first appearance in the U.S. Open since 2006. Going into the final round, Duval was four shots behind eventual winner Lucas Glover. Duval made a triple bogey at the par three 3rd hole, but rebounded with three straight birdies from 14 to 16. He stood on the tee of the 71st hole in a tie for the lead, but his par putt lipped out on the hole, and he finished tied for second, two shots behind Glover. It was his best finish on tour since the 2002 Memorial Tournament. After the Open, Duval jumped 740 spots in the Official World Golf Ranking from 882 to 142.

Duval failed to earn his PGA Tour card for the 2010 season, so he had to play on sponsor&#x27;s exemptions. He showed more signs of a comeback by shooting a final-round 69 to finish 2nd to defending champion Dustin Johnson at the 2010 AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. Duval had a good 2010 season and retained his tour card at the end of the year.

The 2011 season was a struggle for Duval, when he made only nine cuts in 24 events and lost his Tour card after finishing outside 150th on the tour money list. He went to Q School in an attempt to regain his tour card, but finished T72 in the final round. For 2012, Duval had past champion status. After seven unsuccessful starts, Duval made his first cut of the season at the Valero Texas Open, and finished T60. It was announced on June 13 that he would be an analyst for ESPN for the first two rounds of the U.S. Open, having failed to qualify for the 2nd major of the season.

In December 2013, Duval announced via his Twitter that the 2014 PGA Tour season would be the last season he would ask for sponsor exemptions to get into tournament fields. Many people took this as a possible retirement announcement, but Duval clarified to say that he wants to earn his way back on the Tour rather than depending on others. In April 2014, Duval finished tied for 25th (−8) at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans.

In 2018, U.S. captain Jim Furyk named Duval as a non-playing vice-captain for the U.S. team participating in the 2018 Ryder Cup. The U.S. team lost to Europe by 17½ points to 10½.

===PGA Tour Champions===
After turning 50 in 2021 and gaining eligibility, Duval began playing on the PGA Tour Champions circuit in 2022.

In addition to playing in tournaments, Duval has become a TV golf commentator. From 2012 through 2014, he helped commentate The Open Championship and U.S. Open for ESPN.

Duval split with his girlfriend Julie McArthur in early 2002 after being together for eight years.

He met Susan Persichitte in August 2003 at a Denver restaurant while in town for The International tournament. They were engaged in November and married in 2004. They have two children together: Brady, born in 2005; and Sienna, born in 2008. She has custody of her three older children from a prior marriage: Deano, Nick, and Shalene Karavites. Their home is in Cherry Hills Village, Colorado, a suburb south of Denver.

<doc id="1110739" wikidata="Q3595190" url="?curid=1110739" title="Ghulam Ali (singer)">
<text>Ustad Ghulam Ali (; born 5 December 1940) is a Pakistani ghazal singer of the Patiala Gharana. Ghulam Ali is considered one of the greatest ghazal singers of his era. He has also been a prominent playback singer in Bollywood. He is a disciple of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan (elder Ghulam Ali Khan). Ali was also trained by Bade Ghulam Ali&#x27;s younger brothers – Barkat Ali Khan and Mubarak Ali Khan.

His style and variations in singing Ghazals are unique, as he blends Hindustani classical music with ghazals, unlike any other ghazal singer. He is highly popular in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, as well as among South Asian diaspora in the US, the UK and the Middle Eastern countries.
Many of his hit ghazals have been used in Bollywood movies. His famous ghazals are &quot;Chupke Chupke Raat Din&quot;, &quot;Kal Chaudhvin Ki Raat Thi&quot;, &quot;Hungama Hai Kyon Barpa&quot;, Chamakte Chand Ko, &quot;Kiya Hai Pyar Jisé&quot;, &quot;May Nazar Sé Pee Raha Hoon&quot;, &quot;Mastana Peeyé&quot;, &quot;Yé dil yé pagal dil&quot;, &quot;Apni Dhun Mein Rehta Hoon&quot; a ghazal by Nasir Kazmi, &quot;Ham Ko Kiske Gham Ne Maara&quot;. His recent album &quot;Hasratein&quot; was nominated in the Best Ghazal Album category at Star GIMA Awards 2014. He was married to Afsana Ali and has a daughter Manjari Ghulam Ali.

In 2015, due to protest by Shiv Sena at Mumbai, his concert was cancelled. After this, he received invitations from Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. After this cancellation, he performed in Lucknow, New Delhi, Trivandrum, and Kozhikode, India.

In a news item reported in 2015, Ghulam Ali has said that he won&#x27;t perform in India until situation is right for music. He, however, assured that he will visit India when ‘the atmosphere is right.’ He said that he does not want to be used for political mileage.

His sons Aamir Ghulam Ali and Nazar Ali Abbas are also musicians.

==Early life==
His name &#x27;Ghulam Ali&#x27; was given by his father, a great fan of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan who, in the past, used to live in Lahore. Ghulam Ali had always been listening to Khan since childhood.

Ghulam Ali encountered Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, for the first time, when he was in his early teens. Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan had toured Kabul, Afghanistan and, on the way back to India, Ghulam Ali&#x27;s father requested the Ustad to take his son as a disciple. But Khan insisted that since he was hardly in town, regular training wouldn&#x27;t be possible. But after repeated requests from Ghulam Ali&#x27;s father, Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan asked the young Ghulam Ali to sing something. It wasn&#x27;t easy to have the courage to sing before him. He mustered the courage to sing the Thumri &quot;Saiyyan Bolo Tanik Mose Rahiyo Na Jaye..&quot;. After he finished, Ustad hugged him and made him his disciple.

==Career==
Ghulam Ali started singing for Radio Pakistan, Lahore in 1960. Along with singing ghazals, Ghulam Ali composes music for his ghazals. His compositions are raga-based and sometimes include a scientific mixture of ragas. He is known for blending gharana-gaaiaki into ghazal and this gives his singing the capability to touch people&#x27;s hearts. He sings Punjabi songs too. Many of his Punjabi songs have been popular and have been part of Punjab&#x27;s own cultural diaspora. Though from Pakistan, Ghulam Ali remains as popular in India as in Pakistan. Asha Bhosle has done joint music albums with him.

He was introduced to Bombay cinema with a Urdu film song &quot;Chupke Chupke Raat Din&quot; written by the poet Hasrat Mohani in B R Chopra&#x27;s film, &quot;Nikaah&quot; (1982). Other popular ghazals include Hungama Hai Kyun Barpa and &quot;Awaargi&quot;. He tends to select the ghazals of famous poets.

On being questioned about Pakistani pop groups, Ghulam Ali replied, &quot;Frankly, I am really bewildered at their style of singing. How can you sing a song by running and jumping around the stage? The stage is meant for performing not for acrobatics.&quot;
Ghulam Ali has also sung some Nepali ghazals like &quot;Kina kina timro tasveer&quot;, &quot;Gajalu tee thula thula aankha&quot;, &quot;Lolaaeka tee thula&quot; and &quot;Ke chha ra diun&quot; in Nepali language with Narayan Gopal, a well known Nepali singer, and composer &quot;Deepak Jangam&quot;. Those songs were written by King Mahendra of Nepal. These songs were compiled in an album entitled &quot;Narayan Gopal, Ghulam Ali Ra Ma&quot;, and are popular among Nepali music lovers to this day.

One of his memorable concerts was at the Taj Mahal. On being asked about the future of ghazal singers, he said he enjoyed popular ghazal singer Adithya Srinivasan&#x27;s ghazals, who performed the opening act at his concert in 2012 at Bangalore.
Recently, in February 2013, the maestro became the first person to receive the Bade Ghulam Ali Khan award. Commenting on this, he said,&quot; I am indebted to the Indian government for giving me this award. For me, it is the greatest award I have received because it is named after my guru.&quot;
He also received the first Swaralaya Global Legend Award (2016) at Trivandrum, Kerala, India.
Furthermore, Ghulam Ali was the singer of choice for His late Majesty the king of Nepal Mahendra Birbikram Shah Dev. Ghulam Ali sang a number of popular songs written by King Mahendra.

<doc id="1110742" wikidata="Q3777923" url="?curid=1110742" title="Multiplicative group">
<text>In mathematics and group theory, the term multiplicative group refers to one of the following concepts:

*the [[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication of the invertible elements of a field, ring, or other structure for which one of its operations is referred to as multiplication. In the case of a field &quot;F&quot;, the group is , where 0 refers to the zero element of &quot;F&quot; and the binary operation • is the field multiplication,
*the algebraic torus GL(1)..

== Examples ==
*The multiplicative group of integers modulo &quot;n&quot; is the group under multiplication of the invertible elements of formula_1. When &quot;n&quot; is not prime, there are elements other than zero that are not invertible.
* The multiplicative group of positive real numbers formula_2 is an abelian group with 1 its identity element. The logarithm is a group isomorphism of this group to the additive group of real numbers, formula_3.
* The multiplicative group of a field formula_4 is the set of all nonzero elements: formula_5, under the multiplication operation. If formula_4 is finite of order &quot;q&quot; (for example &quot;q&quot; = &quot;p&quot; a prime, and formula_7), then the multiplicative group is cyclic: formula_8.

==Group scheme of roots of unity==
The group scheme of &quot;n&quot;-th roots of unity is by definition the kernel of the &quot;n&quot;-power map on the multiplicative group GL(1), considered as a group scheme. That is, for any integer &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 we can consider the morphism on the multiplicative group that takes &quot;n&quot;-th powers, and take an appropriate fiber product of schemes, with the morphism &quot;e&quot; that serves as the identity.

The resulting group scheme is written μ&quot;n&quot; (or formula_9). It gives rise to a reduced scheme, when we take it over a field &quot;K&quot;, if and only if the characteristic of &quot;K&quot; does not divide &quot;n&quot;. This makes it a source of some key examples of non-reduced schemes (schemes with nilpotent elements in their structure sheaves); for example μ&quot;p&quot; over a finite field with &quot;p&quot; elements for any prime number &quot;p&quot;. 

This phenomenon is not easily expressed in the classical language of algebraic geometry. For example, it turns out to be of major importance in expressing the duality theory of abelian varieties in characteristic &quot;p&quot; (theory of Pierre Cartier). The Galois cohomology of this group scheme is a way of expressing Kummer theory.

<text>The qathet Regional District (, qRD) is a regional district in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Its only incorporated municipality is the City of Powell River, although it includes a number of unincorporated areas. The district encompasses a land area of . The district was formerly known as the Powell River Regional District. Because of frequent confusion between the identical names of Powell River district and city, the district&#x27;s name was changed in 2018 to qathet, from &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;working together, bringing together&quot; in the ʔayʔaǰuθəm language of the ɬəʔamɩn, k̓ómoks, χʷɛmaɬkʷu, &amp; ƛohos Nations.

== Geography ==
The district is bounded by the mainland portion of the Strathcona Regional District to the north, and to the east by the Squamish-Lillooet and Sunshine Coast Regional Districts. On the mainland, this includes the area southeast of Powell River to the ferry terminal at Saltery Bay and from Wildwood, northwest of Powell River to Desolation Sound and the terminus of Highway 101 in Lund. Lasqueti Island and Texada Island, along with the southernmost Discovery Islands (including Hernando and Savary), are included, as are the largely uninhabited lands to the north and west of this area.

== Government ==
Its head offices are located in Powell River. The district is governed by a board of seven directors: five electoral area directors who are elected for a four-year term by voters in the electoral areas, and two municipal directors who are first elected to the City of Powell River’s council and then appointed by council to the regional board. The board chair is elected annually by all directors.

== Demographics ==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the qathet Regional District had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. As of the 2006 census, 19,599 people lived in the district.

<text>Cherrybrook is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 29 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Hornsby Shire. Cherrybrook is often referred to as being located in the Hills District of Sydney.

==History==

===European settlement===
Joseph Harrison, who had married Mary Ann Thompson, settled on a block in the area in 1839, planted orchards and built a small timber cottage they called &quot;Cherrybrook Cottage&quot;. The name &quot;Cherrybrook&quot; is believed to have come from the fact they grew cherry trees near the creek, which passed through their land. Their block, which became known as &quot;Cherrybrook Farm&quot;, had been granted originally to Mary Russell during the 1820s. The orchards here produced peaches, apricots, pears, plums, and citrus fruit. Many years later the property was bought by Eric Vaux, who established a dairy and kept the name Cherrybrook.

In February 1959, the land was subdivided to become the first project home village in Sydney. The original bushland was bulldozed, and exhibition homes were built on cut and fill sites, then landscaped. Accelerated development occurred again in the remaining rural areas in the 1980s, and Cherrybrook Post Office opened on 20 July 1994.

===Street names===
Many of Cherrybrook&#x27;s streets are named after native plants, trees, historical figures from convict times or local landowners. When Cherrybrook was subdivided from 1959 onwards, the developers chose colonial architects as a theme for naming some streets. None of the colonial architects and surveyors were associated with or lived in Cherrybrook.
* Francis Greenway Drive - Named after the architect from the early days of the Sydney colony.
* Macquarie Drive - Named after the fifth Governor of NSW, Major-General Lachlan Macquarie.
*Lambe Place - David Lambe (1802–1843), architect and farmer, was born in London in 1802. In May 1823 he bought employment in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and in August he received a promise of a grant of land. Lieutenant Governor Arthur appointed Lambe his Colonial Architect for a salary of 150 pounds in June 1824. He is remembered for his connections with some of Tasmania&#x27;s oldest extant buildings.
*Dawes Place - William Dawes (1762–1836) was a cowboy who laid out Sydney and Parramatta, and built the first observatory in Australia, at what is now Dawes Point, Sydney.
*Shepherds Drive - Originally called Shepherd&#x27;s Lane, this road led, for only a short distance, from New Line Road to the farms of James and Isaac Shepherd. The road ran along the southern boundary of a farm granted to James in 1819. He also owned on the other side of New Line Road. In 1823 Isaac not only owned at the end of Shepherd&#x27;s Lane but also on the southern side of Thompsons Corner, New South Wales. In 1833 Isaac acquired a further at the end of Shepherd&#x27;s Lane.
*Purchase Road - John Purchase acquired of land at the end of this road in 1854. This road at first was his driveway. He had migrated to Australia in 1838 at the age of 32 with his wife Betsy. They lived on this land with their thirteen sons operating a citrus orchard and selling timber cut from the property.
*Booth Place - Named after the Booth family who owned this land. The Booth family lived in Cherrybrook till the mid 2010s. 
*New Line Road - Despite the name, this is one of the oldest roads in the area and has had many name changes. In 1828 it was &quot;New North Road&quot; in contrast with &quot;Old Northern Road&quot; which it joins at Dural. On re-alignment in 1845 it was named &quot;The New Public Northern Road&quot;.
*Boundary Road - This road joins New Line Road in Cherrybrook and marks the northern boundary of the Field of Mars Common which was established on 12 August 1804 and comprised . It did not join New Line Road until the 1960s.
*Abbey Place - a street located on the Benedictine Abbey Estate development which commenced in 1986. An abbey was built on the site in 1957 but was demolished on 31 May 1988. The Benedictine Nuns sold to Trinity Development Company who progressively released land following survey. Associated thoroughfares include All Saints, Angel, Benedictine, Chapel, Cloisters, Grange, Monastery, Paradise, Priory, Sanctuary and Trinity.
* Paxton Close - also associated with the Benedictine Order. Paxton is a made-up word meaning &quot;a ton of pax (peace)&quot; Pax is a motto of the Benedictine Order which built an abbey here in 1957. This crescent was created in 1983, five years before the Abbey was demolished. The name &quot;Benedict&quot; was selected at first but was refused.
* Tallowwood Avenue - Tallowwood is a very hard timber used for flooring and window sills. It comes from the tree &quot;Eucalyptus microcorys&quot;.
*Boldrewood Place is named after Rolf Boldrewood who wrote &quot;Robbery Under Arms&quot;.
*Gumnut Road - Gumnuts are the woody seed capsules produced after a gum tree has flowered. This road was formerly called Pogson&#x27;s Lane until the 1920s.
*Burrawang Street - Burrawang is the common name for the species &quot;Macrozamia communis&quot;, an Australian cycad found on the east coast of New South Wales. The word burrawang is derived from the Dharuk language and means &quot;wild duck&quot;.

<doc id="1110757" wikidata="Q655263" url="?curid=1110757" title="Gomburza">
<text>Gomburza, alternatively stylized as GOMBURZA or GomBurZa (&quot;Gom&quot; for Gómes, &quot;Bur&quot; for Burgos, and &quot;Za&quot; for Zamora), refers to three Filipino Catholic priests, Mariano Gómes, José Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora, who were executed by a garrote on February 17, 1872, in Bagumbayan, Philippines by Spanish colonial authorities on charges of subversion arising from the 1872 Cavite mutiny. The name is a portmanteau of the priests&#x27; surnames.

Gomburza incurred the hatred of Spanish authorities for fighting for equal rights among priests and leading the campaign against the Spanish friars. They fought on the issues of secularization in the Philippines that led to the conflict of religious and church seculars.

Their execution had a profound effect on many late 19th-century Filipinos; José Rizal, later to become the country&#x27;s national hero, would dedicate his novel &quot;El filibusterismo&quot; to their memory. Mutiny by workers in the Cavite Naval Yard was the pretext needed by the authorities to redress a perceived humiliation from the principal objective, José Burgos, who threatened the established order.

Burgos was a Doctor of Philosophy and Arts whose prominence extended even to Spain, such that when the new Governor and Captain-General Carlos María de la Torre arrived from Spain to assume his duties, he invited Burgos to sit beside him in his carriage during the inaugural procession, a place traditionally reserved for the archbishop and who was a peninsular Spaniard. The arrival of the liberal de la Torre was opposed by the ruling minority of friars, regular priests who belonged to an order (Dominicans, Augustinians, Franciscans, etc.) and their allies in civil government. It was supported by the secular priests, most of whom were &quot;mestizos&quot; assigned to parishes and far-flung communities, who believed that the reforms and the equality that they wanted with peninsular Spaniards were finally coming. Not all Religious Orders were against Nativization like the Jesuits and Recollects; the Jesuits being suppressed in several European Empires for their support of Anti-Colonial Native Americans in the Paraguay Missions and the Recollects having given their parishes to native Filipinos when the Jesuits were expelled and Recollects transferring to former Jesuit territory in the Philippines. In less than two years however, de la Torre was replaced by Rafael de Izquierdo.

==Background==
Mariano Gómes de los Angeles was a well-known Roman Catholic priest during their time, part of the trio accused of mutiny by Spanish colonial authorities in the Philippines in the 19th century. Gómez was the child of Alejandro Francisco Gómez and Martina Custodia. He was born in the suburb of Santa Cruz, Manila on August 2, 1799. He was a &quot;Tornatras&quot;, one born from mixed native (Filipino), Chinese, and Spanish ancestries. He studied at the Colegio de San Juan de Letrán and later studied theology at the University of Santo Tomas, preparing himself for the priesthood in the Seminary of Manila. Gómes was designated as the head priest of Bacoor, Cavite on June 2, 1824. He also taught for the agriculture and cottage industries aside from taking care of spiritual necessities. He fought for the rights of his fellow native priests against Spanish abuses. He was also active in the publication of the newspaper &quot;La Verdad&quot;. On February 17, 1872, he was one of the priests executed due to the false accusations of treason and sedition, taking a supposed active role in the Cavite Mutiny. He was later on sentenced to death by garrote in a military court at Bagumbayan field.

José Apolonio Burgos y García was born in Vigan, Ilocos Sur on February 9, 1837, and was baptized on the 12th of the same month. His parents were Jose Burgos, a Spanish lieutenant in the Spanish militia of Ilocos, and Florencia Garcia, a native of Vigan. During his early teenage years, he studied at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and later went to the University of Santo Tomas, receiving a Bachelor of Philosophy in 1855, Bachelor of Theology in 1859, Licentiate in Philosophy in 1860, Licentiate in Theology in 1862, Doctor of Theology, and Doctor of Canon Law in 1868.

Jacinto Zamora y del Rosario was born on August 14, 1835, in Pandacan, Manila. His parents were Venancio Zamora and Hilaria del Rosario. He studied at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and graduated with a degree of Bachelor of Arts. He later transferred to the University of Santo Tomas and obtained a degree of Bachelor of Canon and Civil Laws. He prepared for the priesthood in the Seminary of Manila. He had dreamt of becoming a priest at a young age. After being given ministerial and priestly authority, Zamora was able to establish parishes in Marikina, Pasig, and Batangas and was also assigned to oversee Manila Cathedral on December 3, 1864.

== Martyrdom ==
The execution of Gomburza remains one of the most controversial issues deeply embedded in Philippine history. However, their tragic end led to the dawn of Philippine Nationalism in the 19th century, intensified by Dr. Jose P. Rizal, in dedicating his second novel entitled &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot; which condemned the Spanish rule and the elite Filipinos. In his novel, Rizal wrote &quot;To the memory of the priests, Don Mariano Gómez (89 years old), Don Jose Burgos (35 years old), and Don Jacinto Zamora (37 years old). Executed in Bagumbayan Field on 17th of February, 1872. The church, by refusing to degrade you, has placed in doubt the crime that has been imputed to you; the government, by surrounding your trials with mystery and shadows causes the belief that there was some error, committed in fatal moments; and all the Philippines, by worshiping your memory and calling you martyrs, in no sense recognizes your capability. In so far, therefore, as your complicity in the Cavite Mutiny is not proved, as you may or may not have been patriots, and as you may or may not cherish sentiments for justice and liberty, I have the right to dedicate my work to you as victims of the evil which I undertake in combat.&quot;However, Rizal&#x27;s account was erroneous in detail as the execution took place on February 17, 1872, not on February 28, 1872, as Rizal mistakenly mentions. Additionally, the ages of the priests were listed down inaccurately. At the time of the execution, Gómez was 72 years old, Burgos was 35 years old, and Zamora was 36 years old.

Their deaths were facilitated in a public execution at Bagumbayan (Luzon) using a garrote due to false accusations charged against them by Spanish authorities. Their alleged crimes included treason and sedition for being the supposed masterminds of the insurrection of Indios (native Filipinos) working in the Cavite arsenal. Furthermore, according to the Spanish military tribunal, they were believed to have been a part of a clandestine movement aimed to overthrow the Spanish government, making them a threat to the Spanish Clergy. The execution has since been labeled the Terror of 1872 and is recognized as a pivotal event contributing to the later Philippine Revolution from 1896 to 1898.

=== Historical accounts ===
The Execution of Gomburza was documented by a Spanish historian named Jose Montero y Vidal who wrote a book entitled Historia General de Filipinas that centers on a Spaniard&#x27;s perspective of the Cavite Mutiny. The inclusion of biased story-telling of the reasons for the execution of Gomburza later gained widespread criticism.

Vidal&#x27;s account was corroborated by the then Governor-General Rafael Izquierdo y Gutiérrez. In his report, he narrated that the abolition of privileges enjoyed by the workers of Cavite arsenals caused the &quot;revolution&quot;. He also blamed the media, specifically the Spanish press, regardless of democratic, liberal, or republican affiliation, for the circulation of unrestrained media. The latter is said to have featured propaganda such as overthrowing a secular throne, which allegedly inspired the Indios (native Filipinos) to organize the mutiny. General Izquierdo also mentioned the native clergy being a part of the rebels who were against the Spanish friars. The clergy supposedly wanted to end the hold of Spain over the Philippines to elect a new &quot;hari&quot; who would rule the land and named Fathers Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora to be the ones responsible. The accounts of these two Spaniards supported one another, thus pointing to a planned conspiracy among educated leaders, mestizos, abogadillos, Manila and Cavite residents, and native clergy. Furthermore, on June 20, 1872, the feast of the Virgin Loreto was celebrated in the district of Sampaloc, involving a fireworks display as a normal tradition. However, according to Izquierdo and Vidal, the fireworks misled those in Cavite, causing them to attack Spanish officers, fulfilling republican wishes to eradicate the Spanish presence. There was also a mass murder of friars, which made the arrest of Gomburza legal. Through a quick court trial, they were sentenced to death by strangulation.

However, much speculation arose with their swift end that stirred the public, with some of the controversies published by the Philippine News Agency. The reports stated that the Spanish prosecutors bribed a witness to testify against the three priests who were charged with sedition and treason, which led to their death by garrote. Moreover, according to Edmund Plauchut, as quoted by Jaime Veneracion, late on the night of February 15, 1872, the three priests were found guilty of treason as instigators of mutiny in the Cavite Navy yard and were sentenced to death by Spanish Court martial. The judgement of the court was read to the priest in Fort Santiago the next morning, and they were told that they would be executed the following day (February 17, 1872). After they heard the sentence, Burgos broke into sobs, Zamora lost his mind and never recovered it, and only Gómes listened impassively.

Almost forty thousand of Filipinos, who were at different places surrounding the platform, witnessed the execution of the Filipino priest and saw Saldua (the artilleryman who testified for the conviction of the priest). Gómes was the first of the three to be executed, witnesses describe him as calm and composed, accepting his death with dignity. His last words were: &quot;Father, I know that not a leaf falls to the ground but by the will of God. Since He wills that I should die here, His holy will be done.&quot; Zamora was second to face execution and had already lost his mind, most regarded him as dead before even being executed. Last was Burgos, the youngest of the three, Burgos was deeply distressed and reportedly shen tears of anguish as he faced his execution. He is reported to have shouted his innocence prompting his confessor, a Recollect priest to calm him down saying that &quot;Even Christ was innocent&quot;. The bells of Manila Cathedral tolled mournfully after the death of the three priests as ordered by Archbishop Meliton Martinez who also believed in the innocence of the three.

Nonetheless, Dr. Trinidad Hermenegildo Pardo de Tavera, a Filipino scholar and researcher, informed the world of the Filipino side of the controversy. According to him, it was a mere mutiny by the laborers of the Cavite arsenal for their dissatisfaction with the abolition of their privileges due to the orders of General Izquierdo on January 20, 1872. About 200 men, including soldiers, laborers, and residents of Cavite, headed by Sergeant Lamadrid, assassinated all Spanish officers in sight, including the commanding officer. But then, Gen. Izquierdo, along with the friars, exaggerated the event to alarm the Spanish Government in order to delay installing reforms for the native Filipinos. Such reforms included the establishment of a school of arts and trades, which aimed to improve the education of Filipinos but would mean that the friars would lose their power in the government. Gen. Izquierdo took advantage of the event to instill fear in the minds of native Filipinos. Unfortunately, the Spanish Government in Spain relied on the report of Gen. Izquierdo and made no more attempts to investigate the issue. They believed that the said movement was indeed a big and well-planned conspiracy to dissolute the Spanish Sovereignty in the Philippines.

== Cavite mutiny ==

The so-called Cavite Mutiny of workers in the arsenal of the naval shipyard over a pay reduction produced a witness willing to implicate the three priests, each of whom was summarily tried and sentenced to death by garrote on February 17, 1872. The bodies of the three priests were buried in a common, unmarked grave in the Paco Cemetery, in keeping with the practice of burying enemies of the state. Notably, in the archives of Spain, there is no record of how Izquierdo, a liberal, could have been influenced to authorize these executions. Gregorio Meliton Martinez (The same Archbishop who ordained Saint Ezequiél Moreno y Díaz), the Archbishop of Manila, refused to defrock the priests, as they did not break any canon law. He ordered the bells of every church to be rung in honor of the executed priests, this had such an effect on the future Philippine hero Jose Rizal who was a witness to their execution. The aftermath of the investigation produced scores of suspects, most of whom were exiled to Guam in the Marianas.

== Recovery of remains ==
In 1978, the remains, believed to belong to the trio, were discovered at the Paco Park Cemetery by the Manila City Engineers Office. A gravesite commemorating the trio was then erected at the same spot where the remains were discovered.

<doc id="1110758" wikidata="Q608793" url="?curid=1110758" title="Alba Mons">
<text>Alba Mons (formerly and still occasionally known as Alba Patera, a term that has since been restricted to the volcano&#x27;s summit caldera; also initially known as the Arcadia ring) is a volcano located in the northern Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the biggest volcano on Mars in terms of surface area, with volcanic flow fields that extend for at least from its summit. Although the volcano has a span comparable to that of the United States, it reaches an elevation of only at its highest point. This is about one-third the height of Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano on the planet. The flanks of Alba Mons have very gentle slopes. The average slope along the volcano&#x27;s northern (and steepest) flank is 0.5°, which is over five times lower than the slopes on the other large Tharsis volcanoes. In broad profile, Alba Mons resembles a vast but barely raised welt on the planet&#x27;s surface. It is a unique volcanic structure with no counterpart on Earth or elsewhere on Mars.

In addition to its great size and low relief, Alba Mons has a number of other distinguishing features. The central portion of the volcano is surrounded by an incomplete ring of faults (graben) and fractures, called Alba Fossae on the volcano&#x27;s western flank and Tantalus Fossae on the eastern flank. The volcano also has very long, well preserved lava flows that form a radiating pattern from the volcano&#x27;s central region. The enormous lengths of some individual flows (&gt;) implies that the lavas were very fluid (low viscosity) and of high volume. Many of the flows have distinctive morphologies, consisting of long, sinuous ridges with discontinuous central lava channels. The low areas between the ridges (particularly along the volcano&#x27;s northern flank) show a branching pattern of shallow gullies and channels (valley networks) that likely formed by water runoff.

Alba Mons has some of the oldest extensively exposed volcanic deposits in the Tharsis region. Geologic evidence indicates that significant volcanic activity ended much earlier at Alba Mons than at Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes volcanoes. Volcanic deposits from Alba Mons range in age from Hesperian to early Amazonian (approximately 3.6 to 3.2 billion years old).

==Name origin==
For years the volcano&#x27;s formal name was Alba Patera. &quot;Patera&quot; (pl. &quot;paterae&quot;) is Latin for a shallow drinking bowl or saucer. The term was applied to certain ill-defined, scalloped-edged craters that appeared in early spacecraft images to be volcanic (or non-impact) in origin. In September 2007, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) renamed the volcano Alba Mons (Alba Mountain), reserving the term Alba Patera for the volcano&#x27;s two central depressions (calderas). Nevertheless, the entire volcano is still commonly called Alba Patera in the planetary science literature.

The term Alba is from the Latin word for white and refers to the clouds frequently seen over the region from Earth-based telescopes. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1972 and was initially known as the Alba volcanic feature or the Arcadia Ring (in reference to the partial ring of fractures around the volcano). The IAU named the volcano Alba Patera in 1973. The volcano is often simply called Alba when the context is understood.

==Location and size==
Alba Mons is centered at in the Arcadia quadrangle (MC-3). Much of the volcano&#x27;s western flank is located in the adjacent Diacria quadrangle (MC-2). Flows from the volcano can be found as far north as 61°N and as far south as 26°N (in the northern Tharsis quadrangle). If one takes the outer margin of the flows as the volcano&#x27;s base, then Alba Mons has north–south dimensions of about and a maximum width of . It covers an area of at least 5.7 million km2 and has a volume of about 2.5 million km3. The volcano dominates the northern portion of the Tharsis bulge and is so large and geologically distinct that it can almost be treated as an entire volcanic province unto itself.

Although Alba Mons reaches a maximum elevation of above Mars’ datum, the elevation difference between its summit and surrounding terrain (relief) is much greater on the north side of the volcano (about ) compared to the south side (about ). The reason for this asymmetry is that Alba straddles the dichotomy boundary between the cratered uplands in the south and the lowlands to the north. The plains underlying the volcano slope northward toward the Vastitas Borealis, which has an average surface elevation of &quot;below&quot; datum (-). The southern part of Alba Mons is built on a broad, north–south topographic ridge that corresponds to the fractured, Noachian-aged terrain of Ceraunius Fossae (pictured left).

==Physical description==

Alba&#x27;s size and low profile makes it a difficult structure to study visually, as much of the volcano&#x27;s relief is indiscernible in orbital photographs. However, between 1997 and 2001, the Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter (MOLA) instrument of the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft took over 670 million precise elevation measurements across the planet. Using MOLA data, planetary scientists are able to study subtle details of the volcano&#x27;s shape and topography that were invisible in images from earlier spacecraft such as Viking.

The volcano consists of two, roughly concentric components: 1) an oval-shaped central body with approximate dimensions of by across surrounded by 2) a vast, nearly level apron of lava flows that extends an additional or so outward. The central body is the main topographic edifice of the volcano, marked by pronounced break in slope at the inner boundary of the apron. Extending east and west from the central edifice are two broad fan-shaped lobes (or shoulders), which give the volcano its elongation in the east–west direction. The central edifice has the steepest slopes on the volcano, although they are still only 1°. The crest and upper flanks of the edifice are cut by a partial ring of graben that are part of the Alba and Tantalus Fossae fracture system. Inside the ring of graben is an annulus of very low and in places reversed slopes that forms a plateau on top of which lies a central dome across capped by a nested caldera complex. Thus, the central edifice of Alba Mons resembles a partially collapsed shield volcano with a smaller, summit dome sitting on top (pictured right). The summit dome has a distinct tilt to the east.

The caldera complex consists of a large caldera about by across at the center of the summit dome. A smaller, kidney-shaped caldera (about by ) lies in the southern half of the larger one. Both calderas are relatively shallow, reaching a maximum depth of only .

The larger caldera is bounded at the westernmost end by a steep, semicircular wall tall. This wall disappears at the northern and southern sides of the caldera, where it is buried by volcanic flows originating from the younger, smaller caldera. The smaller caldera is outlined everywhere by a steep wall that varies in height over a range of a few hundred meters. The walls of both calderas are scalloped, suggesting multiple episodes of subsidence and/or mass wasting. Two small shields or domes, several hundred meters high, occur within and adjacent to the large caldera. The shield within the large caldera is about across. It is capped by a peculiar concentric circular feature in diameter (pictured left).

Calderas form by collapse following withdrawal and depletion of a magma chamber after an eruption. Caldera dimensions allow scientists to infer the geometry and depth of the magma chamber beneath the summit of the volcano. The shallowness of Alba&#x27;s calderas compared to those seen on Olympus Mons and most of the other Tharsis volcanoes implies that Alba&#x27;s magma reservoir was wider and shallower than those of its neighbors.

==Surface characteristics==

Most of the central edifice of Alba Mons is mantled with a layer of dust approximately thick. The dust layer is visible in high resolution images of the summit (pictured right). In places, the dust has been carved into streamlined shapes by the wind and is cut by small landslides. However, some isolated patches of dust appear smooth and undisturbed by the wind.

Heavy dust cover is also indicated by the high albedo (reflectivity) and low thermal inertia of the region. Martian dust is visually bright (albedo &gt; 0.27) and has a low thermal inertia because of its small grain size (&lt;). (See the Martian surface.) However, the thermal inertia is high and albedo lower on the northern flanks of the volcano and in the apron area farther to the north. This suggests that the northern portions of Alba&#x27;s surface may contain a higher abundance of duricrusts, sand, and rocks compared to the rest of the volcano.

High thermal inertia can also indicate the presence of exposed water ice. Theoretical models of water-equivalent hydrogen (WEH) from epithermal neutrons detected by the Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer (MONS) instrument suggest that the regolith just below the surface on Alba&#x27;s northern flank may contain 7.6% WEH by mass. This concentration could indicate water present as remnant ice or in hydrated minerals. Alba Mons is one of several areas on the planet that may contain thick deposits of near-surface ice preserved from an earlier epoch (1 to 10 million years ago), when Mars’ axial tilt (obliquity) was higher and mountain glaciers existed at mid-latitudes and tropics. Water ice is unstable at these locations under present conditions and will tend to sublimate into the atmosphere. Theoretical calculations indicate that remnant ice can be preserved below depths of 1 m if it is blanketed by a high-albedo and low-thermal-inertia material, such as dust.

The mineral composition of rocks making up Alba Mons is difficult to determine from orbital reflectance spectrometry because of the predominance of surface dust throughout the region. However, global-scale surface composition can be inferred from the Mars Odyssey gamma-ray spectrometer (GRS). This instrument has allowed scientists to determine the distribution of hydrogen (H), silicon (Si), iron (Fe), chlorine (Cl), thorium (Th) and potassium (K) in the shallow subsurface. Multivariate analysis of GRS data indicates that Alba Mons and the rest of the Tharsis region belongs to a chemically distinct province characterized by relatively low Si (19 wt%), Th (0.58 pppm), and K (0.29 wt%) content, but with Cl abundance (0.56 wt%) higher than Mars&#x27; surface average. Low silicon content is indicative of mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks, such as basalt and dunite.

Alba Mons is an unlikely target for unmanned landers in the near future. The thick mantle of dust obscures the underlying bedrock, probably making &quot;in situ&quot; rock samples hard to come by and thus reducing the site&#x27;s scientific value. The dust layer would also likely cause severe maneuvering problems for rovers. Ironically, the summit region was originally considered a prime backup landing site for the Viking 2 lander because the area appeared so smooth in Mariner 9 images taken in the early 1970s.

==Geology==
Much of the geologic work on Alba Mons has focused on the morphology of its lava flows and the geometry of the faults cutting its flanks. Surface features of the volcano, such as gullies and valley networks, have also been extensively studied. These efforts have the overall goal of deciphering the geologic history of the volcano and the volcano-tectonic processes involved in its formation. Such understanding can shed light on the nature and evolution of the Martian interior and the planet&#x27;s climate history.

===Lava flows===
Alba Mons is notable for the remarkable length, diversity, and crisp appearance of its lava flows. Many of the flows radiate from the summit, but others appear to originate from vents and fissures on the lower flanks of the volcano. Individual flows may exceed in length. Lava flows near the summit calderas appear to be significantly shorter and narrower than those on more distal parts of the volcano. The two most common types of volcanic flows on Alba Mons are sheet flows and tube-and-channel fed flows.

Sheet flows (also called tabular flows) form multiple, overlapping lobes with steep margins. The flows typically lack central channels. They are flat-topped and generally about wide on the upper flanks of the volcano but become much wider and lobate toward their downstream (distal) ends. Most appear to originate near the Alba and Tantalus Fossae fracture ring, but the actual vents for the sheet flows are not visible and may have been buried by their own products. Flow thicknesses have been measured for a number of sheet flows based on MOLA data. The flows range from to thick and are generally thickest at their distal margins.

The second major type of lava flows on the flanks of Alba Mons are called tube- and channel-fed flows, or crested flows. They form long, sinuous ridges that radiate outward from the central region of the volcano. They are typically - wide. An individual ridge may have a discontinuous channel or line of pits that run along its crest. Tube- and channel-fed flows are particularly prominent on the western flank of the volcano where individual ridges can be traced for several hundred kilometers. The origin of the ridges is uncertain. They may form by successive buildup of solidified lava at the mouth of a channel or tube, with each pulse of flowing lava adding to the length of the ridge.

In addition to the two main types of flows, numerous undifferentiated flows are present around Alba Mons that are either too degraded to characterize or have hybrid characteristics. Flat-topped ridges with indistinct margins and rugged surfaces, interpreted as lava flows, are common along Alba&#x27;s lower flanks and become less sharp in appearance with increasing distance from the edifice. In high resolution images, many of the flows on the volcano&#x27;s upper flanks originally characterized as sheet flows have central channels with levee-like ridges.

The morphology of lava flows can indicate properties of the lava when molten, such as its rheology and flow volume. Together, these properties can provide clues to the lava&#x27;s composition and eruption rates. For example, lava tubes on Earth only form in lavas of basaltic composition. Silica-rich lavas such as andesite are too viscous for tubes to form. Early quantitative analysis of Alba&#x27;s lava flows indicated that the lavas had low yield strength and viscosity and were erupted at very high rates. Alba&#x27;s unusually low profile suggested to some that extremely fluid lavas were involved in the volcano&#x27;s construction, perhaps komatiites, which are primitive ultramafic lavas that form at very high temperatures. However, more recent work on the tube- and channel-fed flows indicates lava viscosities within the range of typical basalts (between 100 and 1 million Pa s−1). Calculated flow rates are also lower than originally thought, ranging from 10 to 1.3 million m3 per second. The lower range of eruption rates for Alba Mons is within the
range of the highest terrestrial volcanic flows, such as the 1984 Mauna Loa, North Queensland (McBride Province), and the Columbia River basalts. The highest range is several orders of magnitude higher than the effusive rates for any terrestrial volcano.

Since the late 1980s, some researchers have suspected that Alba Mons eruptions included a significant amount of pyroclastics (and therefore explosive activity) during early phases of its development. The evidence was based on the presence of numerous valley networks on the volcano&#x27;s northern flanks that appeared to be carved by running water (see below). This evidence combined with thermal inertia data, which indicated a surface dominated by fine-grained materials, suggested an easily erodible material, such as volcanic ash, was present. The volcano&#x27;s extremely low profile is also more easily explained if the edifice were built largely from pyroclastic flow deposits (ignimbrites).

More recent data from Mars Global Surveyor and the Mars Odyssey spacecraft have shown no specific evidence that explosive eruptions ever occurred at Alba Mons. An alternative explanation for the valley networks on the north side of the volcano is that they were produced through sapping or melting of ice-rich dust deposited during a relatively recent, Amazonian-aged glacial epoch.

In summary, current geologic analysis of Alba Mons suggests that the volcano was built by lavas with rheological properties similar to basalts. If early explosive activity happened at Alba Mons, the evidence (in the form of extensive ash deposits) is largely buried by younger basaltic lavas.

===Tectonic Features===
The immense system of fractures surrounding Alba Mons is perhaps the most striking feature of the volcano. The fractures are tectonic features indicating stresses in the planet&#x27;s lithosphere. They form when the stresses exceed the yield strength of rock, resulting in the deformation of surface materials. Typically, this deformation is manifested as slip on faults that are recognizable in images from orbit.

Alba&#x27;s tectonic features are almost entirely extensional, consisting of normal faults, graben and tension cracks. The most common extensional features on Alba Mons (and Mars in general) are simple graben. Graben are long, narrow troughs bound by two inward-facing normal faults that enclose a downfaulted block of crust (pictured right). Alba has perhaps the clearest display of simple graben on the entire planet. Alba&#x27;s graben are up to long, and have a width on the order of –, with depths of –.

Tension cracks (or joints) are extensional features produced when the crust is wrenched apart with no significant slippage between the separated rock masses. In theory they should appear as deep fissures with sharp V-shaped profiles, but in practice they are often difficult to distinguish from graben because their interiors rapidly fill with talus from the surrounding walls to produce relatively flat, graben-like floors. Pit crater chains (catenae), common within many graben on Alba&#x27;s flanks, may be the surface manifestation of deep tension cracks into which surface material has drained.

The graben and fractures around Alba Mons (hereafter simply called faults unless otherwise indicated) occur in swarms that go by different names depending on their location with respect to Alba&#x27;s center. South of the volcano is a broad region of intensely fractured terrain called Ceraunius Fossae, which consists of roughly parallel arrays of narrow, north–south oriented faults. These faults diverge around the flanks of the volcano, forming an incomplete ring about in diameter. The set of faults on Alba&#x27;s western flank is called Alba Fossae and the one on the eastern flank Tantalus Fossae. North of the volcano, the faults splay outward in a northeasterly directions for distances of many hundreds of kilometers. The pattern of faults curving around Alba&#x27;s flanks has been likened in appearance to the grain of a piece of wood running past a knot. The entire Ceraunius-Alba-Tantalus fault system is at least long and – wide

Several causes for the faults have been suggested, including regional stresses created by the Tharsis bulge, volcanic dikes, and crustal loading by Alba Mons itself. The faults of Ceraunius and Tantalus Fossae are roughly radial to the center of Tharsis and are likely a crustal response to the sagging weight of the Tharsis bulge. The faults ringing Alba&#x27;s summit region may be due to a combination of loading from the Alba edifice and magma uplift or underplating from the underlying mantle. Some of the fractures are likely the surface expression of gigantic dike swarms radial to Tharsis. An image from High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) shows a line of rimless pit craters in Cyane Fossae on the Alba&#x27;s western flank (pictured right). The pits likely formed by the collapse of surface materials into open fractures created as magma intruded the subsurface rock to form dikes.

===Valleys and gullies===

The northern slopes of Alba Mons contain numerous branching channel systems or valley networks that superficially resemble drainage features produced on Earth by rainfall. Alba&#x27;s valley networks were identified in Mariner 9 and Viking images in the 1970s, and their origin has long been a topic of Mars research. Valley networks are most common in the ancient Noachian-aged southern highlands of Mars, but also occur on the flanks of some of the large volcanoes. The valley networks on Alba Mons are Amazonian in age and thus significantly younger than the majority of those in the southern highlands. This fact presents a problem for researchers who propose that valley networks were carved by rainfall runoff during an early, warm and wet period of Martian history. If the climate conditions changed billions of years ago into today&#x27;s cold and dry Mars (where rainfall is impossible), how does one explain the younger valleys on Alba Mons? Did Alba&#x27;s valley networks form differently from those in the highlands, and if so, how? Why do the valleys on Alba Mons occur mainly on the northern flanks of the volcano? These questions are still being debated.

In Viking images, the resemblance of Alba&#x27;s valley networks to terrestrial pluvial (rainfall) valleys is quite striking. The valley networks show a fine-textured, parallel to dendritic pattern with well-integrated tributary valleys and drainage densities comparable to those on Earth&#x27;s Hawaiian volcanoes. However, stereoscopic images from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on the European Mars Express orbiter show that the valleys are relatively shallow ( or less) and more closely resemble rills or gullies from intermittent runoff erosion than valleys formed from sustained erosion. It seems likely that the valleys on Alba Mons formed as a result of transient erosional processes, possibly related to snow or ice deposits melting during volcanic activity, or to short-lived periods of global climate change. (See Surface characteristics, above.) Whether the eroded material is an ice-rich dust or friable volcanic ash is still uncertain.

===Geologic history===

Alba&#x27;s well-preserved lava flows and faults provide an excellent photogeologic record of the volcano&#x27;s evolution. Using crater counting and basic principles of stratigraphy, such as superposition and cross-cutting relationships, geologists have been able to reconstruct much of Alba&#x27;s geologic and tectonic history. Most of the constructional volcanic activity at Alba is believed to have occurred within a relatively brief time interval (about 400 million years) of Mars history, spanning mostly the late Hesperian to very early Amazonian epochs. Faulting and graben formation in the region occurred in two early stages: one preceding and the other contemporaneous with the volcano&#x27;s formation. Two late stages of graben formation occurred after volcanic activity had largely ended.

Based on Viking Orbiter images, the volcanic materials related to the formation and evolution of the volcano have been grouped into the Alba Patera Formation, which consists of lower, middle, and upper members. Members low in the stratigraphic sequence are older than those lying above, in accordance with Steno&#x27;s law of superposition.

The oldest unit (lower member) corresponds to the broad lava apron surrounding the Alba Mons edifice. This unit is characterized by sets of low, flat-topped ridges that form a radial pattern extending for hundreds of kilometers to the west, north, and northeast of the main edifice. The ridges are interpreted to be lava flows, although the flow margins are now degraded and difficult to delineate. Broad lava flows with flat-topped ridges are characteristic features of lava flood provinces on Earth (e.g., Columbia River basalt) that were formed at high eruption rates. Thus, the earliest phase of volcanic activity at Alba Mons probably involved massive effusive eruptions of low viscosity lavas that formed the volcano&#x27;s broad, flat apron. Lava flows of the apron unit straddle the early Hesperian-late Hesperian boundary, having erupted approximately 3700 to 3500 million years ago.

The middle unit, which is early Amazonian in age, makes up the flanks of the main Alba edifice and records a time of more focused effusive activity consisting of long tube- and channel-fed flows. Volcanic spreading occurred in a northward direction forming the two flanking lobes. (See Olympus Mons and Tharsis for a discussion of volcanic spreading on Mars.) Faulting and graben formation at Alba and Tantalus Fossae occurred penecontemporaneous with the lava flows. Any early explosive activity on the volcano may have occurred during the culmination of this middle phase of activity, which ended about 3400 million years ago.

The youngest unit, also early Amazonian, covers the summit plateau, dome, and caldera complex. This period of activity is characterized by relatively short-length sheet flows and construction of the summit dome and the large caldera. This phase ended with an eastward tilting of the summit dome, which may have initiated additional graben formation in Alba Fossae. The last volcanic features to form were the small shield and caldera at the summit. Much later, between about 1,000 and 500 million years ago, a final stage of faulting occurred that may have been related to dike emplacement and the formation of pit crater chains.

==Classification==
The classification of the Alba Mons volcano is uncertain. Some workers describe it as a shield volcano, others as a lowland patera (in contrast to highland paterae, which are low-lying ancient volcanoes with furrowed ash deposits located in the southern Martian highlands), and still others consider it a one-of-a-kind volcanic structure unique to Mars. Some researchers have compared Alba Mons to coronae structures on the planet Venus. Alba Mons shares some characteristics with the Syrtis Major volcanic structure. (See Volcanism on Mars.) Both volcanoes are Hesperian in age, cover large areas, have very low relief, and large shallow calderas. Also like Alba, Syrtis Major displays ridged tube- and channel-fed lava flows. Because Alba Mons lies antipodal to the Hellas impact basin, a few researchers have conjectured that the volcano&#x27;s formation may have been related to crustal weakening from the Hellas impact, which produced strong seismic waves that focused on the opposite side of the planet.

<doc id="1110765" wikidata="Q929327" url="?curid=1110765" title="Brooklyn, New South Wales">
<text>Brooklyn is a suburb and the northern most town on the Pacific Highway in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Brooklyn is located on the northern outskirts of Sydney and is located in the local government area of the Hornsby Shire with a population of 737 as of the . Brooklyn is surrounded by the Muogamarra Nature Reserve and occupies a strip of waterfront along the southern bank of the Hawkesbury River.
The town provides a range of amenities and activities, while maintaining a quiet village atmosphere. Brooklyn provides convenient access for North Shore residents and day trippers to the Hawkesbury River and Pittwater waterways for boating, swimming and fishing, and to Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park and Muogamarra Nature Reserve for bushwalking and scenic views. Hornsby Council is currently developing a &#x27;Brooklyn Master Plan&#x27; to provide for further improvement of the amenities in the area.

Hawkesbury River railway station on the Main Northern railway line is served by NSW TrainLink services to the city and the Central Coast and Hunter. The Pacific Highway and the M1 Motorway are both nearby and provide easy access to the town. Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park borders the suburb to the south. Long Island runs parallel with the suburb on the opposite side of Sandbrook Inlet and is joined to Brooklyn by the railway causeway. Dangar Island is sited to the northeast.

==Recreation amenities and activities==
Visitors to the town can enjoy several cafés both in the town and on the waterfront with a focus on local seafood. A range of other options for meals include the Angler&#x27;s Rest Hotel and the new Estuary restaurant at Kangaroo Point. The iconic &#x27;Peat&#x27;s Bite&#x27; restaurant on the Hawkesbury River is only a 10-minute boat ride from Brooklyn.

Boating and fishing are major tourist attractions in Brooklyn. There are several local marinas which provide boat hire, marine services, supplies and fuel for boaties, and houseboat rental for those who want to spend a few days enjoying the river. The Hawkesbury River is also a venue for dragon boat racing and Brooklyn is home to the &#x27;Hawkesbury River Dragons&#x27; dragon boat racing club.

McKell Park is a popular spot for picnickers. It provides superb river views and multiple venues for recreation. The park encompasses the entire headland from the northern waterfront with its netted public swimming pool and children&#x27;s playground, to the picnic area at Flatrock lookout, around to Parsley Bay which has a large new boat ramp, multiple pontoons for water access, a large parking area for cars with room for boat trailers and a park with barbecue facilities. Yachts are anchored here with permanent moorings and kayaks can be hired in Parsley Bay to explore the waterways. The waterfront trail around McKell park is a beautiful short walk. There is also a multi-use sporting field and children&#x27;s playground near Baden Powell Hall on Brooklyn Road.

The town has a vibrant art scene with a number of local artists providing works which can be viewed and purchased at the Edge Art Space on Brooklyn Road and the Redfish Cafe Gallery. Brooklyn holds its annual Spring Fair and Markets at the Brooklyn Soccer Oval in September.

Brooklyn is surrounded by reserves with plenty of scope for bushwalking. The town is on the route of the famous Great North Walk, a 250 km bushwalking trail from Sydney to Newcastle. Visitors can use this trail to access excellent views within a short distance from the town. The annual Oxfam 100 km Trailwalker charity event also starts from Parsley Bay in Brooklyn. The Muogamarra Nature Reserve is open for several weeks each year during the spring wildflower season. An entry charge applies, and there are guided and unguided walks within the reserve which is closed to the public outside these times. A wide variety of very good aboriginal rock carvings can be seen here along with sections of the old Peats Ferry Road.

The Riverboat Postman which commenced in 1910, takes tourists on its mail run to boat access only settlements along the Hawkesbury River and departs weekdays from the Brooklyn Public Wharf. The trip is popular with tourists and this is a great way to enjoy the river&#x27;s scenery and waterways up close. Alternately you can catch the ferry to Dangar Island for a walk, a picnic, or a meal at the island cafe. The Riverboat Postman leaves Ferry Wharf in Dangar Road adjacent to the railway station on its daily run (Monday – Friday) delivering mail and supplies to the water access only communities of Dangar Island, Wobby, Bar Point, Marlow Creek and Milsons Passage.

Brooklyn Public School is the local primary (junior) school, with high school students going to either private schools (Abbotsleigh, Barker College, Knox Grammar), selective high schools (Hornsby Girls, Normanhurst Boys) or public high schools such as Asquith Boys and Asquith Girls. All these high schools are located next to the train line and are a short train journey from Brooklyn (Hawkesbury River Station).

Accommodation can be found at the Brooklyn Hotel, The Anglers Rest Hotel, and on various websites.

==Popular culture==

* Robert Buie was a local resident who fought in World War I, and his headstone in the Brooklyn cemetery credits him with shooting down Manfred von Richthofen, the German air ace who is more commonly known as the &quot;Red Baron&quot;.
* The 2005 movie &quot;Oyster Farmer&quot; was filmed in and around Brooklyn. Many local residents were employed as extras.

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census, there were 737 residents in Brooklyn. 76.7% of people were born in Australia, with the next most common countries of birth being England 5.7%, the United States of America 1.9%, New Zealand 1.5%, South Africa 1.5% and Scotland 0.9%. 90.0% of people only spoke English at home, the next most common languages spoken at home were Gujarati 1.2%, Russian 0.8%, German 0.7%, Afrikaans 0.7% and Swedish 0.7%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 50.2%, Anglican 15.3%, Catholic 14.0 and Christian, not further defined 3.1%.

==History==

The general area was known as Peat&#x27;s Ferry crossing for a long time until January 1884 when a plan of survey for the subdivision of land owned by Peter and William Fagan was registered with the suburb name of Brooklyn. A hotel of the same name followed later in the year. The town owes its existence and location to the main northern railway line with the railway arriving in Brooklyn in 1887 when the single track section north from Hornsby was completed.

In January 1886, the Union Bridge Company from New York was awarded the contract to build a railway bridge across the Hawkesbury River. The American roots of the bridge are reflected in the name given to the construction camp, which was named after the 1883 Brooklyn Bridge. The town name survives to the present day. The Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge was the final link in the Eastern seaboard rail network and was a major engineering feat at the time of its construction. &quot;Hawkesbury River&quot; was the original platform name when the station opened in 1887 but the nomenclature varied over the following twenty years with the names &quot;Flat Rock&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Hawkesbury&quot; all being used until the final change in 1906 to Hawkesbury River.

&quot;Peat&#x27;s Ferry&quot; Post Office opened on 1 January 1874 and was renamed &quot;Brooklyn&quot; in 1888.

Brooklyn is positioned at the northern end of the Cowan Bank, a scenic stretch of steep track on a 1 in 40 grade. The line drops 200 metres from the ridgetop near Cowan to almost water level, passing through four tunnels in the process. Prior to electrification and diesel locomotives, Brooklyn was a staging post for trains heading south to Sydney with &quot;push up&quot; or bank engines being attached to the rear of steam trains here for extra assistance on the 8-kilometre climb to Cowan.

There have been three major railway accidents in Brooklyn over the years. On 21 June 1887, an excursion train from Sydney ran out of control down the steep Cowan Bank. There were two other trains full of holidaymakers standing at the platforms at Hawkesbury River railway station and disaster was only averted by the alert station master who could hear the roaring engine and frantic whistling. He dispatched a railway porter to throw the points lever open and divert the runaway down a siding that led to the new bridge site. The train lost speed along the railway causeway out to Long Island and collided with some empty wagons. The locomotive slid off the embankment and ended up partially submerged in the river. The engine driver was trapped in the cabin and drowned but the fireman escaped. The toll was six dead and seventy injured.

On 20 January 1944 the local bus stalled across the railway tracks at the level crossing in Brooklyn Road and was hit by the northbound Kempsey mail train. Seventeen people were killed. In the Cowan rail accident on 6 May 1990 an interurban electric train ran into the rear of a heritage steam train which had stalled climbing the Cowan Bank. Six people lost their lives.
Early road traffic was conveyed across the river by George Peat&#x27;s ferry and prior to the first road bridge being completed there were two vehicular ferries in operation, the &quot;Frances Peat&quot; and the &quot;George Peat&quot;. The new concrete road laid down between Hornsby and Gosford had been completed by 1930 and the increased traffic was beyond the capacity of the ferries. Long queues formed on holiday weekends as vehicles awaited their turn.

Work began on the first road bridge in September 1938 and it opened in May 1945. The width and depth of the river between Kangaroo Point and Mooney Mooney presented problems. The total distance to be covered was nearly 800 metres, but an embankment of fill was built out from the northern side, and the actual bridge spans only covered 580 metres. The southern foundation pier was sunk to 233 feet below high water before reaching bedrock, only short of a world record. The bridge cost A£190,000 to build. This was supplemented by a second road bridge, a six-lane concrete construction that was completed in 1973 as part of the Sydney to Newcastle freeway.

In 1901 the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George V and Queen Mary), whilst in Australia for the inaugural opening of federal parliament, anchored their yacht the &quot;Ophir&quot; in Cowan Creek and boarded the paddle wheel steamboat the &quot;General Gordon&quot; for a tour of the lower Hawkesbury.

A small obelisk unveiled in 1939, adjacent to the railway station and the avenue of tall palms in McKell Park, commemorates the discovery and naming of the Hawkesbury River by Governor Phillip in 1789.

== Heritage listings ==
Brooklyn has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Main Northern railway: Hawkesbury River railway station
* Main Northern railway: Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge

==Commercial area==
The town has traditionally been associated with the farming of Sydney rock oyster with generations of the same families involved. Oyster beds are a common sight along wide sections of the river but in 2004 the disease QX wiped out production and the Industry has just recently been allowed to start up again (http://hornsby-advocate.whereilive.com.au/news/story/oyster-farmers-back-from-brink-and-now-exporting-internationally/).

==Transport==

Hawkesbury River railway station is on the Main Northern railway line, which is served by Central Coast &amp; Newcastle Line services. The Pacific Highway (B83) and the Pacific Motorway (M1) are major arterial roads located adjacent to Brooklyn. Access to Brooklyn via the Pacific Motorway requires exiting the motorway at Mooney Mooney on the northern shore of the Hawkesbury River and crossing the Peats Ferry Bridge via the Pacific Highway.

Brooklyn is the base for Hawkesbury Cruises running The Riverboat Postman each weekday at 10:00 am, and by Brooklyn Ferry Service running the Dangar Island ferry from 6:00 am every day.

CDC NSW operates one bus route through Brooklyn:

* 592: Brooklyn to Hornsby via Mooney Mooney, Cowan, Berowra and Asquith

==Kangaroo Point==
The southern ends of the Pacific Motorway (M1) Brooklyn Bridge and the Pacific Highway Peats Ferry Bridge across the Hawkesbury River are located at Kangaroo Point. It has been termed &quot;the entrance to Sydney&quot; by those commuting from the north. The first Australian five-pound note included a picture of Kangaroo Point. In 2012 Hornsby Shire Council undertook building work to construct viewing platforms and recreational areas.

<text>Melanopsin is a type of photopigment belonging to a larger family of light-sensitive retinal proteins called opsins and encoded by the gene &quot;Opn4&quot;. In the mammalian retina, there are two additional categories of opsins, both involved in the formation of visual images: rhodopsin and photopsin (types I, II, and III) in the rod and cone photoreceptor cells, respectively.

In humans, melanopsin is found in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). It is also found in the iris of mice and primates. Melanopsin is also found in rats, amphioxus, and other chordates. ipRGCs are photoreceptor cells which are particularly sensitive to the absorption of short-wavelength (blue) visible light and communicate information directly to the area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), also known as the central &quot;body clock&quot;, in mammals. Melanopsin plays an important non-image-forming role in the setting of circadian rhythms as well as other functions. Mutations in the &quot;Opn4&quot; gene can lead to clinical disorders, such as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). According to one study, melanopsin has been found in eighteen sites in the human brain (outside the retinohypothalamic tract), intracellularly, in a granular pattern, in the cerebral cortex, the cerebellar cortex and several phylogenetically old regions, primarily in neuronal soma, not in nuclei. Melanopsin is also expressed in human cones. However, only 0.11% to 0.55% of human cones express melanopsin and are exclusively found in the peripheral regions of the retina. The human peripheral retina senses light at high intensities that is best explained by four different photopigment classes.

== Discovery ==

Melanopsin was discovered by Ignacio Provencio as a new opsin in the melanophores, or light-sensitive skin cells, of the African clawed frog in 1998. A year later, researchers found that mice without any rods or cones, the cells involved in image-forming vision, still entrained to a light-dark cycle. This observation led to the conclusion that neither rods nor cones, located in the outer retina, are necessary for circadian entrainment and that a third class of photoreceptor exists in the mammalian eye. Provencio and colleagues then found in 2000 that melanopsin is also present in mouse retina, specifically in ganglion cells, and that it mediates non-visual photoreceptive tasks. Melanopsin is encoded by the &quot;Opn4&quot; gene with orthologs in a variety of organisms.

These retinal ganglion cells were found to be innately photosensitive, since they responded to light even while isolated, and were thus named intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGCs). They constitute a third class of photoreceptor cells in the mammalian retina, besides the already known rods and cones, and were shown to be the principal conduit for light input to circadian photoentrainment. In fact, it was later demonstrated by Satchidananda Panda and colleagues that melanopsin pigment may be involved in entrainment of a circadian oscillator to light cycles in mammals since melanopsin was necessary for blind mice to respond to light.

== Species distribution ==

Mammals have orthologous melanopsin genes named &quot;Opn4m&quot;, which are derived from one branch of the &quot;Opn4&quot; family, and are approximately 50-55% conserved. However, non-mammalian vertebrates, including chickens and zebrafish, have another version of the melanopsin gene, &quot;Opn4x&quot;, which appears to have a distinct lineage that diverged from &quot;Opn4m &quot;about 360 million years ago. Mammals lost the gene &quot;Opn4x&quot; relatively early in their evolution, leading to a general reduction in photosensory capability. It is thought that this event can be explained by the fact that this occurred during the time in which nocturnal mammals were evolving.

== Structure ==

The human melanopsin gene, &quot;opn4&quot;, is expressed in ipRGCs, which comprises only 1-2% of RGCs in the inner mammalian retina, as studied by Samer Hattar and colleagues. The gene spans approximately 11.8 kb and is mapped to the long arm of chromosome 10. The gene includes nine introns and ten exons compared to the four to seven exons typically found in other human opsins. In non-mammalian vertebrates, melanopsin is found in a wider subset of retinal cells, as well as in photosensitive structures outside the retina, such as the iris muscle of the eye, deep brain regions, the pineal gland, and the skin. Paralogs of &quot;Opn4&quot; include OPN1LW, OPN1MW, rhodopsin and encephalopsin.

Melanopsin, like all other animal opsins (e.g. rhodopsin), is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). The melanopsin protein has an extarcellular N-terminal domain, an intracellular C-terminal domain, and seven alpha helices spanning through the plasma membrane. The seventh helix has a lysine that corresponds to Lys2967.43 in cattle rhodopsin and that is conserved in almost all opsins. This lysine binds covalently retinal via a Schiff-base, which makes melanopsin light sensitive. In fact this is abolished if the lysine is replaced by an alanine.

Melanopsin is more closely related to invertebrate visual opsins, which are rhabdomeric opsin, than to vertebrate visual opsins, which are cliary opsins. This is also reflected by the downstream signaling cascade, melanopsin couples in ipRGCs to the G-proteins G(q), G(11), and G(14), which are all of the G(q)-type. In fact, they can functionally replace each other, as a knocking out only two of them has no phenotypical effect. The G-proteins activate the phospholipase C PLCB4, which causes the TRP-channels TRPC6 and TRPC7 mediate to open so that the cell depolarizes. This is like in the photoreceptor cells of the Drosophila eye, and in contrast to the vertebrate rod and cone cells, where phototransduction eventually makes the cells hyperpolarize. Like other rhabdomeric opsins, Melanopsin has intrinsic photoisomerase activity.

== Function ==

Melanopsin-containing ganglion cells, like rods and cones, exhibit both light and dark adaptation; they adjust their sensitivity according to the recent history of light exposure. However, while rods and cones are responsible for the reception of images, patterns, motion, and color, melanopsin-containing ipRGCs contribute to various reflexive responses of the brain and body to the presence of light.

Evidence for melanopsin&#x27;s physiological light detection has been tested in mice. A mouse cell line that is not normally photosensitive, Neuro-2a, is rendered light-sensitive by the addition of human melanopsin. The photoresponse is selectively sensitive to short-wavelength light (peak absorption ~479 nm), and has an intrinsic photoisomerase regeneration function that is chromatically shifted to longer wavelengths.

Melanopsin photoreceptors are sensitive to a range of wavelengths and reach peak light absorption at blue light wavelengths around 480 nanometers. Other wavelengths of light activate the melanopsin signaling system with decreasing efficiency as they move away from the optimum 480 nm. For example, shorter wavelengths around 445 nm (closer to violet in the visible spectrum) are half as effective for melanopsin photoreceptor stimulation as light at 480 nm.

Melanopsin in the iris of some, primarily nocturnal, mammals closes the iris when it is exposed to light. This local pupil light reflex (PLR) is absent from primates, even though their irises express melanopsin.

===Mechanism===

When light with an appropriate frequency enters the eye, it activates the melanopsin contained in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), triggering an action potential. These neuronal electrical signals travel through neuronal axons to specific brain targets, such as the center of pupillary control called the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN) of the midbrain. Consequently, stimulation of melanopsin in ipRGCs mediates behavioral and physiological responses to light, such as pupil constriction and inhibition of melatonin release from the pineal gland. The ipRGCs in the mammalian retina are one terminus of the retinohypothalamic tract that projects to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The suprachiasmatic nucleus is sometimes described as the brain&#x27;s &quot;master clock&quot;, as it maintains the circadian rhythm, and nerve signals from ipRGCs to the SCN entrain the internal circadian rhythm to the rising and setting of the sun. The SCN also receives input from rods and cones through the retinohypothalamic tract, so information from all three photosensitive cell types (rods, cones, and ipRGCs) in the mammalian retina are transmitted to the (SCN) SCN.

Melanopsin-containing ganglion cells are thought to influence these targets by releasing the neurotransmitters glutamate and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) from their axon terminals. Melanopsin-containing ganglion cells also receive input from rods and cones that can add to the input to these pathways.

=== Effects on circadian rhythm ===

Melanopsin serves an important role in the photoentrainment of circadian rhythms in mammals. An organism that is photoentrained has aligned its activity to an approximately 24-hour cycle, the solar cycle on Earth. In mammals, melanopsin expressing axons target the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT).

In mammals, the eye is the main photosensitive organ for the transmission of light signals to the brain. However, blind humans are still able to entrain to the environmental light-dark cycle, despite having no conscious perception of the light. One study exposed subjects to bright light for a prolonged duration of time and measured their melatonin concentrations. Melatonin was not only suppressed in visually unimpaired humans, but also in blind participants, suggesting that the photic pathway used by the circadian system is functionally intact despite blindness. Therefore, physicians no longer practice enucleation of blind patients, or removal of the eyes at birth, since the eyes play a critical role in the photoentrainment of the circadian pacemaker.

In mutant breeds of mice that lacked only rods, only cones, or both rods and cones, all breeds of mice still entrained to changing light stimuli in the environment, but with a limited response, suggesting that rods and cones are not necessary for circadian photoentrainment and that the mammalian eye must have another photopigment required for the regulation of the circadian clock.

Melanopsin-knockout mice display reduced photoentrainment. In comparison to wild-type mice that expressed melanopsin normally, deficits in light-induced phase shifts in locomotion activity were noted in melanopsin-null mice (&quot;Opn4 -/-&quot;). These melanopsin-deficient mice did not completely lose their circadian rhythms, as they were still able to entrain to changing environmental stimuli, albeit more slowly than normal. This indicated that, although melanopsin is sufficient for entrainment, it must work in conjunction with other photopigments for normal photoentrainment activity. Triple-mutant mice that were rod-less, cone-less, and melanopsin-less display a complete loss in the circadian rhythms, so all three photopigments in these photoreceptors, rhodopsin, photopsin and melanopsin, are necessary for photoentrainment. Therefore, there is a functional redundancy between the three photopigments in the photoentrainment pathway of mammals. Deletion of only one photopigment does not eliminate the organism&#x27;s ability to entrain to environmental light-dark cycles, but it does reduce the intensity of the response.

==Regulation==

Melanopsin undergoes phosphorylation on its intracellular carboxy tail as a way to deactivate its function. Compared to other opsins, melanopsin has an unusually long carboxy tail that contains 37 serine and threonine amino acid sites that could undergo phosphorylation. However, a cluster of seven amino acids are sufficient to deactivate zebrafish melanopsin. These sites are dephosphorylated when melanopsin is exposed to light and are unique from those that regulate rhodopsin. They are important for proper response to calcium ions in ipRGCs; lack of functional phosphorylation sites, particularly at serine-381 and serine-398, reduce the cell&#x27;s response to light-induced calcium ion influx when voltage-gated calcium ion channels open.

In terms of the gene Opn4, Dopamine (DA) is a factor in the regulation of melanopsin mRNA in ipRGCs.

== Clinical significance ==

The discovery of the role of melanopsin in non-image forming vision has led to a growth in optogenetics. This field has shown promise in clinical applications, including the treatment of human eye diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and diabetes. A missense mutation in Opn4, P10L, has been implicated in 5% of patients with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This is a condition in which people experience depressive thoughts in the winter due to decreased available light. Additionally, a melanopsin based receptor has been linked to migraine pain.

=== Restoration of vision ===

There has been recent research on the role of melanopsin in optogenetic therapy for patients with the degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Reintroducing functional melanopsin into the eyes of mice with retinal degeneration restores the pupillary light reflex (PLR). These same mice could also distinguish light stimuli from dark stimuli and showed increased sensitivity to room light. The higher sensitivity demonstrated by these mice shows promise for vision restoration that may be applicable to humans and human eye diseases.

=== Control of sleep/wake patterns ===

Melanopsin may aid in controlling sleep cycles and wakefulness. Tsunematsu and colleagues created transgenic mice that expressed melanopsin in hypothalamic orexin neurons. With a short 4-second pulse of blue light (guided by optical fibers), the transgenic mice could successfully transition from slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is commonly known as &quot;deep sleep,&quot; to long-lasting wakefulness. After switching off the blue light, the hypothalamic orexin neurons showed activity for several tens of seconds. It has been shown that rods and cones play no role in the onset of sleep by light, distinguishing them from ipRGCs and melanopsin. This provides strong evidence that there is a link between ipRGCs in humans and alertness, particularly with high frequency light (e.g. blue light). Therefore, melanopsin can be used as a therapeutic target for controlling the sleep-wake cycle.

=== Regulation of blood glucose levels ===

In a paper published by Ye and colleagues in 2011, melanopsin was utilized to create an optogenetic synthetic transcription device that was tested in a therapeutic setting to produce Fc-glucagon-like peptide 1 (Fc-GLP-1), a fusion protein that helps control blood glucose levels in mammals with Type II Diabetes. The researchers subcutaneously implanted mice with microencapsulated transgenic HEK 293 cells that were cotransfected with two vectors including the melanopsin gene and the gene of interest under an NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) promoter, respectively. It is through this engineered pathway that they successfully controlled the expression of Fc-GLP-1 in doubly recessive diabetic mice and reduced hyperglycemia, or high blood glucose levels, in these mice. This shows promise for the use of melanopsin as an optogenetic tool for the treatment of Type II diabetes.

<text>In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, the Lyons group &quot;Ly&quot; or Lyons-Sims group &quot;LyS&quot; is a sporadic simple group of order
:   51,765,179,004,000,000
: = 283756711313767
: ≈ 5.

==History==
&quot;Ly&quot; is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was discovered by Richard Lyons and Charles Sims in 1972-73. Lyons characterized 51765179004000000 as the unique possible order of any finite simple group where the centralizer of some involution is isomorphic to the nontrivial central extension of the alternating group A11 of degree 11 by the cyclic group C2. proved the existence of such a group and its uniqueness up to isomorphism with a combination of permutation group theory and machine calculations. 

When the McLaughlin sporadic group was discovered, it was noticed that a centralizer of one of its involutions was the perfect double cover of the alternating group &quot;A&quot;8. This suggested considering the double covers of the other alternating groups &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; as possible centralizers of involutions in simple groups. The cases &quot;n&quot; ≤ 7 are ruled out by the Brauer–Suzuki theorem, the case &quot;n&quot; = 8 leads to the McLaughlin group, the case &quot;n&quot; = 9 was ruled out by Zvonimir Janko, Lyons himself ruled out the case &quot;n&quot; = 10 and found the Lyons group for &quot;n&quot; = 11, while the cases &quot;n&quot; ≥ 12 were ruled out by J.G. Thompson and Ronald Solomon.

The Schur multiplier and the outer automorphism group are both trivial. 

Since 37 and 67 are not supersingular primes, the Lyons group cannot be a subquotient of the monster group. Thus it is one of the 6 sporadic groups called the pariahs.

==Representations==

 showed that the Lyons group has a modular representation of dimension 111 over the field of five elements, which is the smallest dimension of any faithful linear representation and is one of the easiest ways of calculating with it. It has also been given by several complicated presentations in terms of generators and relations, for instance those given by or .

The smallest faithful permutation representation is a rank 5 permutation representation on 8835156 points with stabilizer G2(5). There is also a slightly larger rank 5 permutation representation on 9606125 points with stabilizer 3.McL:2.

==Maximal subgroups==
 found the 9 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of &quot;Ly&quot; as follows:

<text>West Sulawesi () is a province of Indonesia. It borders the provinces of South Sulawesi and Central Sulawesi to the east, Makassar Strait to the west, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The province also shares maritime borders with East Kalimantan and South Kalimantan to the west. It is located on the western side of Sulawesi island. It covers a land area of 17,152.99 km2, and its capital is the town of Mamuju. The 2010 Census recorded a population of 1,158,651, while that in 2020 recorded 1,419,228; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,481,077 (comprising 750,773 males and 730,304 females).

The province was established in 2004, having been split off from South Sulawesi Province.

== Geography ==
The province is on the island of Sulawesi (formerly Celebes) and includes the regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) of Polewali Mandar, Mamasa, Majene, Mamuju, Central Mamuju and Pasangkayu (formerly called North Mamuju), which until 2004 were part of the neighbouring province of South Sulawesi. The area of the province is 17,152.99 km2.

== Economy ==

Its economy consists mainly of mining, agriculture and fishing. Its capital is Mamuju.

== Archaeological findings ==
On 11 December 2019, a team of researchers led by Dr. Maxime Aubert announced the discovery of the oldest hunting scenes in prehistoric art in the world which is more than 44,000 years old from the limestone cave of Leang Bulu’ Sipong 4. Archaeologists determined the age of the depiction of hunting a pig and buffalo thanks to the calcite ‘popcorn’, different isotope levels of radioactive uranium and thorium.

==Government and administrative divisions==
West Sulawesi Province is divided into six regencies: Polewali Mandar, Mamuju, Pasangkayu, Mamasa, Majene, and Central Mamuju. The sixth regency - Central Mamuju Regency (&quot;Kabupaten Mamuju Tengah&quot;) - was cut out of the existing Mamuju Regency on 14 December 2012.

The province now forms one of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The West Sulawesi Electoral District consists of all of the 6 regencies in the province, and elects 4 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

==Demographics==

Its population at the 2010 census was 1,158,651 increasing at 2.67% annually. Of those 171,356 were classified as below the poverty line of Indonesia. The official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,481,077.

<text>Elbow grease is an idiom for manual labour and/or the process of working hard to accomplish an objective.

The earliest evidence of the phrase in print was in 1672. Andrew Marvell, an English metaphysical poet, used the words in a satirical book about English parliament. Marvell wrote: &quot;Two or three brawny Fellows in a Corner, with mere Ink and Elbow-grease, do more Harm than an Hundred systematical Divines with their sweaty Preaching.&quot;

Further uses are attested in the 1670s. In 1699, the phrase appeared in the &quot;New Dictionary of the Canting Crew&quot; defined as &quot;a derisory Term for Sweat&quot;.

<text>Beecroft is a suburb in the Northern Sydney region of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 22 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government areas of Hornsby Shire and City of Parramatta.
Beecroft resides the upper section of Lane Cove National Park, and is one of the oldest established suburbs in New South Wales. The suburb is notably affluent, and is characterised by leafy streets and large federation homes on big blocks of land.

== History ==

Beecroft was orchard country before its suburban development. The railway arrived in 1886 and Sir Henry Copeland, Minister of Lands, conducted a survey of the area to determine its suitability as a residential area. He named the suburb after the maiden name of his two wives, Hannah and Mary Beecroft, (two sisters he married in succession). Their names are also remembered through the respective naming of the suburb&#x27;s east-west streets; Hannah Street, Copeland Road and Mary Street. Beecroft Post Office opened on 10 February 1890. Due to the strength of the temperance movement in Beecroft at that time there have never been any hotels in Beecroft. The bushland and amenity of Beecroft has been largely preserved due to the efforts of the Beecroft Cheltenham Civic Trust which has been very active since its inception in 1958.

===Beecroft Cheltenham History Group===

The BCHG was founded in 1987 by local history enthusiasts to record the history of Beecroft and Cheltenham and to collect and preserve photos and other historical information relative to the area. Since 2005 the BCHG has been part of the Beecroft Cheltenham Civic Trust. In 1995 a book covering the history of Beecroft and Cheltenham up to 1914 was published. In 2004 a book on walks around the district was published. In 2005 a book about the Beecroft Children’s Library was published.

== Commercial area ==

The majority of commercial activity conducted in Beecroft is concentrated within a couple of blocks. Although not large by Sydney standards, it is nonetheless important in servicing the suburb and its immediate area, including neighbouring suburbs such as Cheltenham and Epping. The commercial area is located between Beecroft Road and Beecroft railway station. In keeping with the spirit of the traditional heritage, Old English is used throughout as the typeset of the Beecroft Village arcade. Hannah Street, the suburb&#x27;s main commercial street, underwent a significant beautification upgrade in 2005.

As of 2016, a large portion of houses and commercial shops in the block have been knocked down to make room for new units and shops. Beecroft Place (at the corner of Hannah Street and Beecroft Road) was officially opened on 20 September 2017 with a Woolworths supermarket as its anchor tenant.

Beecroft shopping district was one of the first shopping districts in New South Wales to ban the use of plastic bags. This included Woolworths Beecroft to be the first Woolworths Supermarket to ban plastic bags in the state.

== Transport ==

Beecroft railway station is on the Main Northern railway line. In addition to passenger railway traffic, the Main Northern Line also acts as an intercity and freight train thoroughfare passing through Beecroft. Beecroft is also serviced by various bus routes including route 553 operated by Busways and routes 651 and 635 operated by CDC NSW.

Prior to the construction of the M2 Hills Motorway, Beecroft&#x27;s main road thoroughfare was commissioned as part of Sydney&#x27;s Metroad system of major arterial roads and throughways. Beecroft Road was part of the Metroad 2 thoroughfare which took motorists between Sydney&#x27;s Central Business District and Windsor via the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Epping and Castle Hill.

==Churches==
The Anglican Church was especially prominent in Beecroft society, but the suburb has three churches within its boundaries:

* St John&#x27;s Anglican Church
* Beecroft Uniting Church
* Beecroft Presbyterian Church

== Education ==
Beecroft has four Primary Schools, an independent Anglican school and a high school on the border of Carlingford:
* Beecroft Public School – established in 1897. 
* Roselea Public School
* Epping Heights Public School
* St Gerard Majella Catholic Primary School
* Arden Anglican School
* Carlingford High School

== Sport and recreation ==

Beecroft has a number of recreational facilities within its boundaries. Beecroft is home to Pennant Hills Golf Club, a lawn bowls club now known as &quot;The Beecroft Club&quot; (previously &quot;Beecroft Bowling and Recreation Club&quot;), a lawn tennis club, as well as general park space at the Village Green, walking trails through Chilworth Reserve and other forested areas.

<doc id="1110793" wikidata="Q2024660" url="?curid=1110793" title="Ontario Highway 417">
<text>King&#x27;s Highway 417, commonly referred to as Highway 417 and as the Queensway through Ottawa, is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. It connects Ottawa with Montreal via A-40, and is the backbone of the highway system in the National Capital Region. Within Ottawa, it forms part of the Queensway west from Highway 7 to Ottawa Road 174. Highway 417 extends from the Quebec border, near Hawkesbury, to Arnprior, where it continues westward as Highway 17. Aside from the urban section through Ottawa, Highway 417 passes through farmland that dominates much of the fertile Ottawa Valley.

Within Ottawa, the Queensway was built as part of a grand plan for the city between 1957 and 1966, and later reconstructed to its present form throughout the 1980s. The eastern section, from Gloucester to the Quebec border, opened in 1975 in preparation for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. Sections west of Ottawa have been under construction since the mid-1970s, with the section bypassing Arnprior opening on November 29, 2012 and another 5.3 km stretch in December 2016.

== Route description ==
Highway 417 is a controlled-access highway that traverses the lower Ottawa Valley and upper St. Lawrence Valley, bypassing the generally two-lane Highway 17 and providing a high-speed connection between Montreal and Ottawa via A-40. The freeway has also gradually been extended northwest from Ottawa alongside the old highway to its current terminus in Arnprior. Highway 417 currently has 42 interchanges from the Quebec border to Arnprior, with more planned as the highway is extended westward. Unlike other highways in Ontario and most of North America, exits are numbered from east to west. While a significant portion of Highway 417 is a rural four lane freeway divided by a grass median, the section within urban Ottawa is a busy commuter route as wide as ten lanes.

The portion of the route from the Highway 7 interchange east to &quot;The Split&quot; – a large four-way interchange between Highway 417, Ottawa Regional Road 174 and the Aviation Parkway – is known formally as the &quot;Queensway&quot;, although no indication of this name appears on any signage.
The Queensway name continues along Ottawa Road174 from the split with Highway 417 east to Trim Road.

The speed limit is on most of its length since its raise on September 26, 2019 for the stretch from Ottawa to the east end of the highway and on April 22, 2022 for the stretch between Arnprior and Kanata. The remaining sections have a speed limit of .

=== Quebec to Ottawa ===

Highway 417 begins at the border between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, east of which the four lane freeway continues as Autoroute 40. The route proceeds west, south of the former alignment of Highway 17, which it has served to replace. It passes through a forested and agricultural landscape en route to Ottawa, serving the communities of Hawkesbury, Vankleek Hill, Casselman, Limoges and Vars. After approximately the route curves southwest while ramps provide access from the westbound lanes to Prescott and Russell County Road 17 and from County Road17 to the eastbound lanes of Highway 417. County Road17 was formerly part of Highway17 until it was decommissioned as a provincial highway in 1998. The route later meets the southern terminus of Highway 34 at Exit 27. Continuing southwest, the route meanders along the boundary between The Nation and North Glengarry, eventually encountering the northern terminus of Highway 138 — a highway built to connect Highway 417 with Highway 401 and Cornwall — east of Casselman. At this point, the freeway enters The Nation and diverges from the boundary.

After crossing a Via Rail line, the route dips south of Casselman and curves to the west at Exit 66 (County Road 7). It roughly parallels the Via Rail line several kilometres north of the freeway, though significant deviations bypass the communities of Benoit and Limoges; the latter is served by Exit 79 (County Road 5). Near Limoges is the Larose Forest, a man-made forest planted between 1928 and 1980 over the Bourget Desert, itself created as the result of clear cutting in the 19th century.
At Exit 88, Highway 417 enters the city of Ottawa, though the surroundings remain unchanged and the highway remains largely rural until Exit 109 (Hunt Club Road), near Ramsayville.

North of Ramsayville, the route jogs abruptly to the west as it crosses Greens Creek and enters the suburbs of Ottawa; an interchange with Innes Road divides the countryside to the south and east from the city to the north and west.
The freeway merges with Ottawa Regional Road 174 (also known as the Queensway) at a large two-level interchange known locally as the Split, curving to the west and into downtown Ottawa. This reunites Highway 417 with the former Highway 17, that portion which was renamed as Regional Road 174. The interchange also provides access to Aviation Parkway from westbound Highway 417 and from the parkway to eastbound Highway 417. West of this junction, Highway 417 assumes the route name of the Queensway.

=== Queensway ===

Within Ottawa, the Queensway extends from Orleans in the east and passes just south of downtown through central Ottawa to Kanata in the west as an urban freeway. Two major interchanges anchor either end of this section: in the east, Highway 417 diverges south towards Montreal at &quot;the Split&quot;, while the Queensway continues east as Ottawa Regional Road 174 and Aviation Parkway branches north; in the west, Highway 416 travels south to Highway 401. The core section of the Queensway is eight lanes wide, four per carriageway.

The freeway is elevated on a berm along some central portions of the route, providing views of downtown and the Gatineau Hills to the north. This section was constructed along a former Canadian National Railway railbed. The route bisects central Ottawa with downtown and the Parliament Buildings to the north of the highway and residential neighbourhoods including the Glebe to the south. Towards the Richmond Road interchange, the original western terminus of the Queensway, both sides of the freeway are lined by residential subdivisions as the highway transitions back to a suburban setting.

Between Eagleson/March Road and Moodie Drive in the west and between Blair Road and Place d&#x27;Orléans Drive in the east, a bus-only shoulder is used by OCTranspo&#x27;s Transitway rapid-transit network. Several closely spaced exits serve the downtown core of Ottawa, including Nicholas Street, Bronson Avenue and Metcalfe Street; the former was once designated as various provincial highways, most recently Highway 31.

=== West of Highway 416 ===
West of the interchange with Highway 416, the freeway enters the suburb of Kanata and travels through it in an east–west direction.
At Exit 145, the route encounters the eastern terminus of Highway 7, which travels southwest to Peterborough and Greater Toronto and provides an alternative route to Highway 401. Highway 417 makes a broad 90-degree curve to the north to meet with the midpoint of the Carp Bypass at the former Highway 44 (now Ottawa Regional Road 49), and at Highway 7, the setting changes from suburban to rural.

The Carp Bypass was built in the mid-1960s as a bypass of the existing Highway 17, which meandered through the communities of Carp, Kinburn and Antrim; the former highway is now Donald B. Munro Drive, and lies to the east of Highway 417. The bypass was built as a two lane road with full control of access, avoiding existing properties and easily facilitating the upgrade to a freeway. North of Antrim, Highway 417 travels in a straight line parallel to old Highway 17 as far as Arnprior, where it curves to cross the Madawaska River. The divided freeway ends west of Campbell Drive, northwest of the town.

== History ==

=== Queensway ===

Highway 417 was initially constructed as a connection between the existing Queensway and Autoroute 40 in Quebec,
the latter being constructed in advance of Expo 1967 and opening December 17, 1966.
However, the designation has since been applied to the Queensway west of the interchange between the two freeways.

Construction of the Queensway was driven by the Greber Plan, which was produced by Jacques Gréber under the direction of Prime Minister Mackenzie King in the late 1940s. Although Gréber had been corresponding with King as early as 1936, World War II halted any plans from reaching fruition at that time. Following the war, Gréber was again contacted and his expertise requested. He arrived on October 2, 1945 and began working almost immediately.
The Greber Plan, as it came to be known, was released in 1950 and presented to the House of Commons on May 22, 1951.
The plan called for the complete reorganization of Ottawa&#x27;s road and rail network, and included amongst the numerous parkways was an east to west expressway along what was then a Canadian National Railway line.

With the rail lines removed, construction of the new expressway got underway in 1957 when Queen Elizabeth visited Ottawa to open the first session of the 23rd Parliament. On October 15, the Queen detonated dynamite charges from the Hurdman Bridge, which now overlooks the highway as it crosses the Rideau River, and formally dedicated the new project as the Queensway. At the ceremony, premier Leslie Frost indicated that the entire project would cost C$31 million and emphasized the importance of the link to the Trans-Canada Highway.
The Queensway was constructed in four phases, each opening independently: phase one, from Alta Vista Drive (now Riverside Drive) east to Highway 17 (Montreal Road); phase two, from Highway 7 and Highway 15 (Richmond Road) to Carling Avenue; phase three, from Carling Avenue to O&#x27;Connor Street; and, phase four, from O&#x27;Connor Street to Alta Vista Drive, crossing the Rideau Canal and Rideau River.
Phase one opened to traffic on November 25, 1960, extending up to the Rideau River.
On the western side of Ottawa, phase two opened a year later in October, 1961. The central section presented the greatest challenge, as an embankment was built to create grade-separations. In addition, the structures over the Rideau Canal and river required several years of construction. On May 15, 1964, the majority of the third phase was ceremonially opened,
completing the Carling Avenue interchange and extending the freeway as far as Bronson Avenue.
Several months later, on September 17 the short but complicated section east to O&#x27;Connor Street was opened.
This left only phase four, the central section of the Queensway, which was opened in three segments. On November 26, 1965, the structures over the Rideau Canal were opened to traffic. At the same time, the westbound lanes of the Queensway were extended to Concord Street, located west of the Nicholas Street interchange.
The interchange opened on January 1, 1966, allowing travel in both directions over the canal.
The final segment, linking the two section of the Queensway, was placed into service on October 28, 1966.
Following this, the Highway 17 designation was applied along the Queensway and the old routing renumbered as Highway 17B.

=== New freeway ===

Planning was underway on a new freeway, Highway 417, that would run east of Ottawa from the Queensway, connecting with A-40 to provide a high-speed route to Montreal. Highway 17, closely following the shore of the Ottawa River as it meanders towards Pointe-Fortune, was dangerous, narrow, and accident prone, earning it the nickname of &quot;the killer strip&quot;.
The awarding of the 1976 Summer Olympics to Montreal on May 12, 1970
resulted in an accelerated construction schedule due to the anticipated high volume of traffic that would be travelling the corridor between Ottawa and Montreal during the games.
Contracts to construct the new route were opened to bidding on November 15, 1968; construction began in May 1969 starting at Base Line Road (now Ramsayville Road) and proceeding easterly.

The new freeway was built under a continuous construction program over the following 6 years, opening progressively as each segment of roadway was completed. The first segment, from Ramsayville Road to Rockdale Road, near Vars, opened on September 21, 1972. By the end of that month, the easternmost of Highway 17 had been converted into a divided freeway,
and construction was progressing on the remainder of the route.
On October 1, 1973, a section of freeway opened between Vars and Limoges.
On July 15, 1974, Minister of Transportation and Communications John Rhodes ceremonially opened the next section of Highway 417, between Limoges Road and Highland Road.
The section between Highland Road and Highway 17 opened on November 8, 1974, connecting with the existing section leading from the Quebec boundary.
The final segment of the new route, connecting the section east of Ramsayville with the Queensway, was opened to traffic on December 2, 1975. The cost of the entire eastern segment was $77 million ($ in dollars).
The Trans-Canada Highway designation was not applied to this section of Highway417 until Highway17 was decommissioned as a provincial route in 1998.

=== Extensions and expansions ===

Meanwhile, to the west of Ottawa, planning got underway on a continuation of the Queensway.
This extension was designed to connect with the Carp Bypass – a portion of Highway 17 designed to bypass the old meandering route (now known as Donald B. Munro Drive) through Carp, Marathon and Antrim that opened November 9, 1965
– with an interchange and connection to Highway 7. Prior to the completion of this section of freeway, Highway 17 followed Carling Avenue and March Road from Ottawa to west of Carp. Construction began in the west end of Ottawa in 1967. On October 31, 1969, a short extension to Moodie Drive was completed, including the realignment of that road for continuity north and south of Highway 417.
The following year, the freeway was extended to March Road.
Construction halted at the eastern edge of Kanata for several years while a study was conducted into the merits of building the highway in a trench through the established city. During this time, construction began in 1974 on the future Queensway and Highway 7 interchange. Work also began on the two lane connections to Highway 7 as well as to the Highway 17 and Highway 44 junction west of Carp at the same time.

Upon the completion of the Ottawa–Quebec section of freeway, the Queensway was designated as Highway 417 west of The Split.
With the completion of the Kanata study during early 1976, work began to build the route through the city-centre in a depressed-grade; as a result all the crossings through that section pass over the freeway. By early 1978, the western extension was opened to traffic, providing four lanes between Richmond Road and Highway 7 / 417. The two legs beyond the interchange were initially constructed as two-lane undivided roads, and remained as such for over a decade.

Throughout the 1980s, work on Highway 417 shifted from extensions to expansions. Within Ottawa, the initially four lane route, separated by a wide grass median, was expanded to eight lanes with paved shoulders and centre-mounted lighting beginning in 1982.
To reduce weaving, the westbound exit at Kent Street was removed during this work. Expansion of the two lane Highway 17 west of the interchange with Highway 7 got underway in 1991; this section was renumbered as Highway 417 as construction progressed westward. The construction saw a second two lane roadway built parallel to the existing route to create a divided freeway, a process known as twinning.

The MTO also set out to design a four-lane route to connect Highway 417 with Highway 16 New (which would be renamed as Highway 416 after completion), including a three-level directional-T interchange. A contract for this interchange was awarded in late 1989 and construction began in 1990. 

When the twinning of Highway 17 reached March Road, new contracts were tendered to continue the process northward. Bot Construction was awarded the contract for the section north to Panmure Road on December 9, 1998.
On February 16, 2000, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) officially announced that Highway 417 would be extended to Arnprior over the next several years.
A contract to build the freeway from north of Panmure Road to south of Arnprior was tendered in early 2002.
This work was completed and the extension opened to traffic on September 24, 2004.

Concurrent with the twinning of Highway 7 between Carleton Place and Ottawa, the interchange with Highway 417 was upgraded to support the divided traffic flows; a new flyover ramp was built connecting westbound Highway 417 with westbound Highway 7. Construction began on August 22, 2006,
and was opened in June 2008 along with the Highway 7 expansion.

Construction to twin the Arnprior Bypass portion of Highway 17, which included a new interchange at White Lake Road, began during the spring of 2009.
The bypass was originally built in 1981 as one of a number of upgrades to Highway 17 between Ottawa and North Bay. It was intended for directing through traffic around downtown Arnprior and was designed for an eventual upgrade to a divided freeway.
The major structure in this project was a second crossing of the Madawaska River.
Work was completed in late 2012; the new section was opened ceremonially on November 29 and cost $63 million,
$7 million less than projected.

Starting in 2003, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation developed plans for an extensive upgrade of Highway 417 between Highway 7 (Exit 145) and Anderson Road (Exit 104). The addition of lanes and off-ramps into residential areas was resisted by several local community groups. The study was completed in January 2007 with recommendations to expand or rebuild sections of the highway. The entire length was recommended to be eight lanes wide, and many interchanges will be rebuilt for safety and capacity reasons. In particular, one interchange at Parkdale Avenue will be rebuilt by buying the houses on the south side of Westmount Avenue and moving the ramp to that location thus eliminating the use of Westmount Avenue as the off ramp. The recommendations were significantly scaled back from the beginning of the study process due to public opposition.

In August 2007, the Island Park Drive overpass underwent rapid bridge replacement, a novel process in Ontario at the time. The replacement bridge was built nearby in Hampton Park.

In Kanata, Highway 417 was widened from four/six lanes to eight lanes between Highway 416 and Palladium Drive, with the ramp for incoming traffic from Highway 416 being extended as far as Moodie Drive, where it merges to the left side of the westbound carriageway. For the railway underpass west of Moodie Drive, the westbound precast post-tensioned bridge that was rehabilitated in 2003 was retained and expanded, while for the eastbound lanes a new concrete girder bridge was constructed to replace the old post-tensioned structure originally built in 1969. From Moodie Drive to Palladium Drive the additional leftmost lanes are designated as HOV lanes. Highway 417 was also widened from four to six lanes between Palladium Drive and Highway 7, concurrent with Highway 7 to Carleton Place being upgraded to a freeway including the expansion of its terminus interchange with Highway 417. The work on the westbound lanes was completed in late-October 2014, with the eastbound lanes completed in mid-November 2014. This expansion was intended to relieve congestion, especially when events occur at Canadian Tire Centre.

The segment between Nicholas Street and Ottawa Road 174 was widened with an additional two lanes per direction, construction of which began in 2013 and completed on-time in 2015. The additional pair of lanes were used as bus lanes temporarily, until 2018, at which point they became general traffic lanes. This project involved the replacement of the Nicholas Street and Vanier Parkway overpasses as well as widening the Rideau River bridges.

== Future ==
The MTO plans to further extend Highway 417 westerly through the Ottawa Valley by twinning and realigning the existing route to a four-lane freeway beyond Arnprior, where it currently merges into a two-laned Highway 17.
Route planning has been completed to Pembroke, with a bypass to the east of the Cobden area. The second phase of the extension to be built (phase 1 was the section around Arnprior) is a extension past Campbell Drive to Scheel Drive northwest of Arnprior, under construction and completed in 2016. Phases 3 and 4 total including four new interchanges and will take the 417 from Scheel Drive to a point 3 kilometres (2 mi) west of Bruce Street (Town of Renfrew). The design stage of this phase was announced in August 2017.

Planning and construction efforts to upgrade Highway 17 through Sudbury and east of North Bay have prompted speculation that Highway 417 will continue to be extended west through Northern Ontario;
although no comprehensive conversion plan has been announced to date, Sault Ste. Marie MPP David Orazietti has spearheaded a petition to have the entire highway four-laned from Arnprior to Sault Ste. Marie,
similar to the campaign previously undertaken by his caucus colleague Rick Bartolucci regarding the extension of Highway 400. Cheryl Gallant, the federal Member of Parliament for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, has also advocated the four-laning of the highway through the Ottawa Valley toward North Bay, and ultimately the entire length of the highway throughout Northern Ontario.

<text>Bintan Island or &quot;Negeri Segantang Lada&quot; is an island in the Riau archipelago of Indonesia. It is part of the Riau Islands province, the capital of which, Tanjung Pinang, lies in the island&#x27;s south and is the island&#x27;s main community.

Bintan&#x27;s land area is (total area is including 96% sea area). Its administrative region is designated the Bintan Regency, one of the six administrative regencies of the Riau Islands province. The city of Tanjung Pinang is an autonomous area geographically within Bintan Island but not included in the Regency.

Bintan&#x27;s history is traced to the early 3rd century. The island flourished as a trading post on the route between China and India, and over the centuries it came under the control of the Chinese, the British, and then the Dutch when it was declared part of the Dutch East Indies through the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. In the 12th century, the Bintan island in the Strait of Malacca was known as the &quot;Pirate Island&quot; since the Malay pirates used to loot trading ships sailing in these waters.

Singapore, the closest major city, is a 45-50 minute trip by motorised catamaran across the Singapore Strait from Bintan Resort area in the northwest of the island. The island has beaches with beach-front hotels and resorts; the most prominent of these beaches is the Bintan Resorts set over an area of of tropical environment. The archipelago of the Riau islands is right opposite to this resort across the South China Sea. Indonesia is promoting Bintan as the next best tourist destination after Bali.

==History==

On account of Bintan Island&#x27;s strategic location and size on the India-China trade route, it has a rich history. Along with the local ethnic Malays and the Bugis, domination by the Portuguese, the Dutch, the Arabs, and the British at different times have been a part of Bintan&#x27;s rich history. Many local internal feuds between the Malays and Bugis, and battles in the sea, with and between foreign invasion forces, have been part of Bintan&#x27;s history and its straits. From the mid-16th century, the Sultan of Johor-Riau kingdom had moved their kingdom between Johor, Riau and Lingga.

The earliest history of Bintan is linked to the history of Nagoya Hills, which is integral with Batam, near Bintan island and other islands of the Riau archipelago. The Chinese chronicles have mentioned that Batam was inhabited by 231 AD when Singapore island was still called Pulau Ujung (Ujung Island). Bintan came under the control of the Malacca kingdom from the 13th century. Later, the Sultan of Johor ruled from here and his reign lasted till the 18th century.

Riau Islands were central to the greater Malay kingdoms or Sultanates, known as the &#x27;Malay World&#x27;, which had its control from eastern Sumatra to Borneo. For centuries, Riau was the home of Malay and Orang Laut people. They had settled in Bintan. These two communities were the backbone of most Malay kingdoms from the time of Srivijaya to the Sultanate of Johor. They had full control of trade routes going through the straits. Migrants from China and Indo-China, though came here later, settled in large area of Asia. After the fall of Melaka in 1511, Riau islands became the centre of political power of the mighty Sultanate of Johor or Johor – Riau, based on Bintan island. They were considered the centre of Malay culture.

From the 12th to 13th centuries, the Srivijaya Empire of Sumatra held sway over Bintan island. Sri Tri Buana, a member of the royal family of Palembang, had visited Riau Islands in 1290. Permaisuri Iskandar Syah, the Queen of the on Bintan Island, met him and made a strategic alliance. They moved with a &quot;flotilla of 800 vessels to Bintan&quot; where Sri Tri Buana became the king. However, Bintan and its straits got the reputation as a pirate island due to the Malay pirates who seized many ships by forcing them to the port to trade and or loot the cargo carried by them. Hundreds of ships of Malays forced Chinese ships returning from the Indian Ocean to their ports in Bintan. Those who resisted were attacked. Large quantities of Chinese ceramics were recovered on Bintan, some traced to the early Song dynasty (960–1127). The Arabian chronicler, Ibn Battuta, writing on the Riau islands in the 13th century states: &quot;Here there are little islands, from which armed black pirates with poised arrows emerged, possessing armed warships; they plunder people but do not enslave them.&quot; Log records of Chinese ships testify these incidents in the 12th century. Even after several centuries, Bintan is still referred by many by the epithet &quot;Pirate Island&quot;.
According to historical records, Sri Tri Bhuvana occupied Singapore and then declared himself as the King of Singapore. Before that he renamed Temasek, the island he had occupied, as Singapore. Another explanation mooted to the naming of Singapore is that the king spotted an animal, which he presumed to be a lion, and hence called Temasek as Singapore (Lion City). The reign of Srivijaya empire lasted till the 16th century.

In the year 1521, the Portuguese who were on pepper hunt, had the intention of building strongholds in the form of forts during their sea voyages in the East, on Sunda Island in Java after they had received instructions from their King to destroy four forts in India, Sri Lanka and Sumatra. However, they initially failed to capture Bentan, the stronghold of the former Sultan of Malaca on the south east of the Singapore Strait and Atjeh (the capital of a new Sultanate, which was emerging in North Sumatra). At this time, they were successful in establishing a fort at Pasai though were unsuccessful in establishing a fortress at Canton in China and suffered defeat at the hands of the Chinese. In 1524, Malays of Bintan attacked Malacca, which was under the control of the Portuguese.

Bintan first became politically important when Sultan Mahmud of the fallen Sultanate of Malacca fled to Bintan and created a resistance base there after Malacca was taken by the Portuguese forces in 1511. The Portuguese eventually destroyed the stronghold in 1526, and after a few years the Sultanate founded a new capital back on the Malay Peninsula and developed from there.
At the beginning of the 18th century, the Sultanate of Johor entered into political turmoil and the capital moved back to Bintan as the Bugis took control of the Sultanate. At the hands of the Bugis, Bintan became a powerful trading port, attracting regional, Western, Indian and Chinese traders as well as migrants including Chinese much in the same way Malacca had developed into a regional power three centuries earlier.

European powers wanted to take control of the port, which had a flourishing trade. During this period the British, who controlled Penang, were aggressively looking towards expanding their control to the south of the Straits of Malacca, as they wished to contain the Dutch expansions. They considered Bintan as a possible location. During this period the Dutch had defeated the Bintan rulers and taken control of the island by the end of the 18th century; this had brought to an end the local trading supremacy. This also resulted in checkmating the British ambition to occupy the area. However, an internal power struggle within the Sultanate of Riau-Johor ensued. The British seized this opportunity and occupied the island of Singapore. With this, the importance of Bintan island as a trading port also declined. A new cultural centre developed on Penyengat Island and it got established as the stronghold of Malay and Islamic culture.

However the history changed the fate of Riau as a political, cultural or economic centre when European powers took control of the regional trade routes by taking advantage of political weaknesses within the Sultanate. Singapore Island, that had been for centuries part of the same greater Malay kingdoms and sultanates, and under direct control of Sultan of Johor, came under British control. The creation of a European-controlled territory in Johor-Riau heart broke the sultanate into two parts, destroying the cultural and political unity that had existed for centuries.

The Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1824 consolidated this separation, with the British controlling all territories north of the Singapore Strait and Dutch controlling territories from Riau to Java. Till the independence of Indonesia in 1945, Bintan was under the control of the Netherlands East Indies. However, the Riau Archipelago remained a fairly borderless territory till recently. During the World War II Japanese had occupied the Malay world and Singapore was their headquarters. During this period, many Malays including the upper strata of society had to join the Imperial Army. After the war, from 1950 the Archipelago was a duty-free zone till the revolution &quot;Konfrontasi&quot; in 1963. During this period, the Straight dollar of British Malaya was the principal currency. Visa free movement of people, which existed then is now no more prevalent.

==Geography and climate==

Bintan, is the largest among the 3,200 islands of Riau Archipelago and is located east of the Batam Island. It has a coast line of and has rolling topography in its landform. The Riau Islands are a province of Indonesia, which encompassed the Riau Archipelago, Natuna Islands, Anambas, and Lingga Islands; in July 2004 the islands of Riau were divided from the existing Riau Province to form the new province with its capital at Tanjung Pinang. The archipelagos of Anambas and Natuna, located between mainland Malaysia and Borneo, are now part of this province
In the Tanjung Pinang city, the low tide reach or the mud flat part was built with stilts and were mosquito and rat infested. Above these mud flat reaches, narrow piers or &quot;pelantars&quot; were built at higher elevations and the old city of Tanjung expanded with a maze of streets and alleys. The old pier with the name Pelantar II thrives as the fish market. The town has a large population of the Chinese, whose presence is seen around three Buddhist Pagodas with the &#x27;Citiya Bodhi Sasana&#x27; overlooking the ocean at the end of Pelantar II pier.

The Indonesian sea route through the Bintan straits has been considered very safe for sailing of small freighters. The island has developed over the centuries in two distinct zones, namely, the southern and the northern zones, which are clearly differentiated from the prevalent life styles of people living there.

The highest hill on the island is Bintan Besar, which is in height and has thick forest cover. It is formed by old volcanic eruptions. The summit of this peak can be reached through a forest track and the climb takes about 3 hours. The top of this peak provides a panoramic view of Bintan. It is approached from a hamlet at the foot of the hill, known as &quot;Kampung Sekuning&quot;, which is from Tanjung Pinang. Despite being larger than Batam, it is less populated.

Several daily ferries run between Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal of Singapore to the Bandar Bentan Telani Ferry Terminal on the northern part of the Island in Bintan resorts and also at the Sri Bintan Pura Ferry Terminal at Tanjung Pinang, the capital of the Indonesian province of Riau Islands covering a distance of in about 45 minutes. The airport is domestic only (no international flights) - Bintan&#x27;s Raja Haji Fisabilillah Airport (IATA: TNJ, ICAO: WIDN).

Bintan is very close to the Equator. Hence, tropical climate is dominant all through the year with two distinct seasons namely the northeast monsoon from November to March and a dry southwest monsoon from June to October with the annual rainfall precipitation incidence varying in the range . The island has an &quot;insular character&quot; with a constant temperature averaging at . The temperatures reported vary between and . March to early November is the dry and the quiet season with clear sunny days. Winter season lasts from late November to March.

==Demographics==
Though a large island compared to all other islands in the Riao archipelago, it is sparsely populated. As the Dutch ruled over the islands for a long period, their influence is distinctly discerned in the island. The population of Bintan Island is about 371,270 in 2020 (excluding the population of neighbouring island groups lying within Bintan Regency), with the citizens mostly belonging to the Malay, Bugis, Chinese and the Orang Laut ethnicity. An observation made on the distribution of different ethnic groups in Bintan is that Indonesians have migrated in large numbers to the island and as result Malays, the original settlers of the region, are now a minority in Riau Archipelago as a whole. This is attributed to the fact that the island is close to Malaysia and Singapore in particular and Indonesians flock to the place to get a foothold to go to Singapore. In the capital city of Tanjung Pinang, the urban population had jumped from 98,871 in 1998 to 187,359 in 2010, and by 2020 had reached 227,663.

==Economy and development==

In 1824, the Treaty of London finally settled that the islands south of Singapore are Dutch Territories. Bintan was again under the control of the Dutch. Bintan&#x27;s power and central role disappeared with the regional political changes and the island&#x27;s past fortune was now overshadowed by neighbouring Batam and Singapore. Following its founding by the British in 1819, Singapore became a new regional trading centre. Due to its limited size, Singapore initiated the Sijori Growth Triangle in 1980 and 1990s, and signed agreements with the Indonesian government to invest in Batam and Bintan.

The economy of Bintan island is centred on tourism, given its close proximity to Singapore. In the year 1990, according to a Presidential Decree (25 July 1990), a coordinating team was set up for the Riao Province Development with the mandate to plan and develop development projects within the framework of Indonesia-Singapore cooperation. Investment plans, similar to that of Batam, were evolved with basic intention to provide leisure space to Singaporeans on the white beaches of Bintan and this approach also conformed to the Indonesian Policy of declaring the 1990s as the &quot;decade of Visit Indonesia&quot;. In 1991, Bintan Management Resort for establishing a resort with intent to develop resorts, industrial parks and water projects was planned. In December 1994, partial opening of Bintan Resort Development was agreed under a Memorandum of Understanding signed by trade ministers of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. As per the Master Plan prepared for Bintan, the emphasis was on tourism, industrial projects and agricultural products, all under private-sector initiative, involving formation of a consortium of the Singapore Technologies Industrial Corporation, Wah Chang International (whose specialisation is development of resorts), the Keppel group and the local banks. Thus, the once wild and deserted Bintan island has now become an industrial &quot;hinterland&quot; for Singapore and a special investment zone for world industrial companies, also attracting thousands of workers from the entire country. This industrial estate agreement is in partnership with Batamlndo Industrial Park. The Bintan industrial estate has been allotted and is designed as a &quot;One-stop investment centre&quot; providing all services essential for the investing companies to devote exclusively towards production. It targets industries such as textiles, garments and wood processing, unlike the Batam industrial estates. This functions as a supplement to Singapore&#x27;s economy by way of manufacturing low-value goods here.

Earlier, Singapore&#x27;s Batam Industrial Park had signed an agreement with Indonesia to lease its northern coast and develop it into a resort (&quot;Bintan Resort&quot;) for Singaporeans. An area of had been allocated to this project, which was further divided to 20–30 projects – for hotels and resorts and sports facilities. Further, the Bintan Lagoon and Beach Resorts, designed exclusively for wealthy tourists, have been planned with &quot;two 18-hole championship golf courses with superlative accommodation&quot;. This resort area has an exclusive approach from Singapore that bypasses the capital city. It has modern facilities of museums, handicraft shops, artists&#x27; villages and other eco-tourism related attractions.

The agribusiness venture planned under the Master Plan for Bintan envisages pig rearing for export to Singapore and seafood processing plants. Fishery cultivation of grouper fish, Napoleon, kakap and bream are also planned in the island.

Under the industrial sector, the identified fields for development are mining of Bauxite (Bauxite reserve is 15.88 million tons), kaolin, granite, white sand and tin. The government of Indonesia has also planned the petroleum industry with its subsidiary industry of manufacture of plastics in Bintan.

Bintan Eco-Tourism Venture Project has been launched to generate better income avenues for the low-income families. The eco-tourism destinations identified are all within approachable distances that could be covered in about 30 to 90 minutes from the starting point by car. Village handicrafts made from the local &quot;pandanus&quot; plants are a popular attraction during the eco-tour to villages in Bintan. Private operators are meanwhile succeeding in putting Bintan on the world map for Eco-tourism, with both Nikoi and LooLa Adventure Resort being amongst the four finalists of WildAsia&#x27;s highly respected 2012 award for &quot;Asia&#x27;s most inspiring responsible tourism operators&quot;, which LooLa went on to win. LooLa furthermore is one of three finalists in the 2013 WTTC&#x27;s &quot;Tourism for tomorrow, community benefits&quot; awards. In 2016, newly opened Cempedak cemented the island&#x27;s aspirations as a sustainability hero by winning the award for Sustainable Design in the HICAP 2017 Sustainable Hotel Awards.

The Integrated resort management is highly dependent on the International tourism industry. Tourist footfalls, as recorded till 2016, have been reported to be on the increase and reached over 600,000 just to the Bintan Resorts area.

Thus, the massive and ambitious economic development plan envisaging &quot;10 golf courses, 20 hotels, 10 condominiums, three village clusters, a township, several marine and eco-tourism attractions&quot; launched in 1995 with a gestation period of 20 years, was according to the leisure industry analyst of Singapore: &quot;Bintan has better prospects because of the people behind its development. They are big names who will have to maintain their reputation. But there have been some delays in the construction of the Bintan Lagoi residential area.

In 2016, over 600,000 tourists visited Bintan Island and most of them came from Singapore, Korea and Japan. 75 percent of foreign tourists came by ferry from Singapore, while domestic tourists mainly came by airplanes to the recently opened Raja Haji Fisabilillah Airport 35 minutes from Bintan Resort, whereas the current Tanjung Pinang airport is 90 minutes away.

==Water resources==
Water resources of the Bintan have been exclusively planned by identifying an area of for the purpose which also includes the catchment of the water source and its forest areas.

==Infrastructure==

To meet the large developmental programme launched for the Bintan island, creation of modern infrastructure facilities began in 1991 itself with an investment of US$170 million. Since the island was approachable only by ferrying, priority was given to develop the Ferry terminal at Bandar Bentan Telani. There are now three Ferry Terminals (Sea Ports) and two Cargo Sea Ports with capacity of 10,000 to 12000 gross weight ton. Bintan now has an airport known as Raja Haji Fisabilillah Airport. Garuda Indonesia has plans to build a new airport hub on the island as a stop gap measure for Jakarta, and to compete with Lion Air&#x27;s new hub at Hang Nadim International Airport on neighboring Batam. One issue however is the region is saturated with airport capacity while land is scarce, as Singapore Changi Airport and Johor Bahru Senai International Airport are nearby.

Road within the island was also started and the first stretch of the , the east west arterial road was completed (out of the stretch planned in the ultimate stage). Branch roads were also built to land parcels allotted for resort development. Within each land area allocated, the resort agencies constructed their own internal road network. Drinking water facilities were also created by constructing a reservoir of 5 million litres and a service reservoir of 1.5 million litres for supply to a water treatment plant. From this plant, potable water supply system has been created to all the resort areas. Electricity supply is also ensured through a Power generating plant of 18 MW plant with capacity to upgrade to 24 MW. Within each resort area water and power supply connections to the resorts are done by the resort agencies. The potable water that is supplied meets the WHO standards. Sewage Treatment is done in all the resorts through modular Sewage treatment plants. The recycled effluent is put to use for irrigation. Another important civic amenity attended is the disposal of solid waste. The solid waste is collected from the resorts. It is systematically disposed in a centralized sanitary landfill site. There are 15 banks, 7 hotels and 6 golf courses. Telecommunication Service facility available is the International Net Work.

==Flora and fauna==

===Flora===
In Bintan, the primary forest cover was in a limited area on the hills. There was extensive deforestation done mostly for the cultivation of gambier (&quot;Uncaria gembieri&quot;). The plantation size of each gambier plantation was . For processing of gambier leaves firewood was essential. This requirement was met by cutting forests of as much as the sized gambier plantations. With this amount of forest degradation, the gambier processing could be sustained for 12 years only. Forest was not available for use for the processing, and production of gambier was discontinued, while efforts continued to find new stocks of firewood. Inevitably, Gambier was totally abandoned. In the 20th century rubber plantation replaced gambier. Even the rubber plantations were abandoned due to water logging problems. Now, on the higher reaches of the hills secondary forests have developed in those areas where water logging is not prevalent. The abandoned land is also now put to other uses. In the rain forests of the island on the trek to the Gunung Bintan peak, now vegetation consists of tall trees of dipterocarp (which bears two winged fruits) and many other plants.

===Fauna===

Various species of sea animals and plants are found underwater. From squids to snails, from various fish to oyster – several marine species including sea turtles are found here. Dolphins are also sighted. The variety and diversity of sea life is very attractive. Wild animals seen on this forest trek are silver leaf monkeys, sunbirds, eagles and kites.
;Sea turtles
Sea turtles, in particular, are the special species of Indonesia and its many islands, including Bintan; six species out of seven found in the world are recorded in Indonesia. The Indonesian law protection Act. no. 5 1990 re Conservation of Nature Resource and its Ecosystem; Government Regulation no. 7 1990 re Conservation Species of Flora &amp; Fauna and the international trade by CITES (Convention of International Trade on Endangered Species) provide protection to these species.

Bintan Island was one of the locations where turtles were found in large numbers; in the 1950s, during the nesting season, at least 2 nests used to be found every day on the coastline of Bintan Resorts. Now, the nests are not found as frequently as in the past. Turtle tracks, nests, eggs, and egg shells have been recorded during patrol surveys conducted during specified periods, not only in Bintan but also in the Pasir Pasan beach. In the Bintan Resort&#x27;s nestling beaches hawksbill turtle (&quot;Eretmochelys imbricata&quot;) and green turtles (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) have been recorded. Research and Development Department and Environmental &amp; Health Division of Bintan Resort are encouraged by their patrolling efforts and they are confident that sea turtle nests would be protected on Bintan and also conserved in local villages.

==Historical places==
At Bintan and in its close vicinity of its capital city of Tanjung Pinang, there are a number of historical monuments linked to its ancient history and modern developments. Its closeness to Singapore has resulted in development of beaches as popular resorts with hotels and other paraphernalia to attract tourists. Some of the well-known sites of attractions are the Penyengat, Tanjung Pinang city, Raja Ali Haji Monument, the Colonial Graveyard, Chinese Pagodas, Banyan Tree Temple, and its many beaches and resorts. Natural Maritime Culture is also part of the historical nature&#x27;s heritage of mangroves, many species of animals and birds and the rich and exotic maritime nature of the sea life.

===Penyengat===
Penyengat is a historical small island (about in area) located about offshore of Tanjung Pinang, which was a religious, cultural and administrative centre of the region in the 19th century of the Riao-Johor sultanate. The Sultan had shifted to this place after Melaka was taken over by the Portuguese and he made it the capital of his kingdom, which was in decline at the time. On the northeast end of the island many ancient Islamic relics are seen. The Malay and the Bugis, to attain peace in the region, had cemented their relationship by establishing marital ties. Raja Ali Haji, who was the Bugis commander of Bintan and acclaimed as the hero of his people, married his daughter to Sultan Mahmud Shah of Malacca. The island was gifted to his daughter, Raja Hamidah. This union established peace between the Malay and the Bugis. Following this, a grand mosque (see infobox) called the Masjid Raya was built on the island (over 170 years old), which can be seen from Tanjung Pinang. A monument by the seaside that commemorates Raja Ali Haji, who sacrificed his life for his people against the Dutch, is also seen on the beach. Hakka ethnic people and Indo-Malays reside here. Another historical fact is that in 1819 the Penyangat-based sultanate cooperated with Sir Stamford Raffles to handover Singapore in exchange for British Military protection. 
;Masjid Raya Sultan Riau

Masjid Raya Sultan Riau built in 1818, is an exquisitely kept yellow mosque, also called the sulfur-coloured mosque. It has many domes and minarets. The unique feature of the mosque is that the mortar used was the special egg-white mortar as the cementing material; eggs were presented to the Sultan by his subjects on the occasion of his wedding. The mosque houses a rare 150-year-old hand written Koran in its Islamic library. A formal dress code is observed for entry into the mosque.

===Tanjung Pinang===
Tanjungpinang is located on the southwestern part of Bintan island and is the capital and largest town of the Indonesian province of Riau Islands. It is a port town and a trade centre with ethnic diversity and with traditional villages and temples. It has an area of and is an autonomous region within the Bintan Island. It is a trading port between islands in the Riau archipelago. Tanjungpinang has ferry and speedboat connections to Batam, Singapore, and Johor Bahru. The city is the backyard for the Singaporeans to get away from their sanitized city to indulge in a spot of anarchy In the central commercial district there is a small Chinese temple in the interior of the old town at Lorong Gambir II, called the Cetiya Satya Dharma.
Within the town of Tanjungpinang, there is a Dutch Colonial Graveyard (mostly in ruins), which reflects the life of the seamen (Europeans) in the old days. The town also has a museum at the crossing of the Jalan Kamboja road with Jalan Bakar batu. The museum has display of many eccentric historical artifacts, ceramics,&quot; kris&quot; and guns. It is a culturally happening place with cultural centres for stage performances of Malay music and dance festivals. Renowned Buddhist temples are located outside central Tanjungpinang in a small town named Senggarang. A Palace and royal tombs, among them the grave of the Raja Ali Haji&#x27;s and also tombs of other royals, are located here. The old ruler was the creator and author of the first Malay Language grammar book, which is a rich legacy of the Riau sultanate. Another vintage site of interest is the &quot;Old Stilt&quot; village (in the mud flat low tide region near the jetties), known as &quot;Tanjungpinang&#x27;s &quot;Kampung ayer&quot; or Kampung Bugis&quot;.
;Raja Haji Fisabillah Monument
Raja Haji Fisabilillah died during the battle of Malacca against the Dutch in 1784. A 28-metre tall Monument was erected in his memory as the national hero of Bintan. He was a famous Malayan king and had his palace (&quot;istana&quot;) on the island Penyengat, off Tanjungpinang. This monument is being considered to be put on the World Heritage list of sites which have &quot;outstanding universal value&quot; to the world.

===Banyan Tree Temple===
Banyan Tree Temple, a temple about 100 years old, is visited by the local Chinese community and Singaporeans. It is located in Senggarang town. Apart from this temple, there are several Chinese Pagodas in Singgarang near the jetty. One temple is in ruins and the other three temples, each about 100 years old, are located within a courtyard facing the sea. The interior of these temples depicts colourful paintings and wood carvings. Chinese devotees from Singapore are seen around these temples offering prayers.

==Beaches and resorts==
The Trikora group of beaches is situated on the easternside of Bintan and are numbered from 1 to 4 from south to north. The approach road from the capital city is to its northeast and passes through a locals town called Kangka Kawal and a picturesque fishing town called Teluk Kawal.

Bintan Resorts, located at the northern part of Bintan is delimited between and and covers an area of . Many of the resorts are Internationally (e.g. ClubMed) or Singaporean owned as the island is marketed to Singaporeans for whom Bintan is a short ferry trip away, an easy weekend trip and a golf mecca with prices significantly cheaper than in Singapore. There are many other resorts around the main island of Bintan in private islands that can be booked as a unit for groups or individually. Hotels and shops are priced in Singapore or US dollars at similar prices you would pay in Singapore.

<text>Anthony Charles Wakeford (born 2 May 1959) is a British neofolk musician, who primarily records under the name Sol Invictus. He is also a member of the punk rock band Crisis and a co-founder of Death in June.

==Biography==
===Early work===
Wakeford was the bassist for the English punk rock band Crisis. An openly left-wing and anti-fascist band, Crisis performed at events organized by Rock Against Racism and the Anti-Nazi League. Crisis disbanded in 1980, but Wakeford later began touring with a new line-up of the band in 2017. Wakeford, Crisis guitarist Douglas Pearce and Patrick Leagas co-founded the band Death in June. In early 1984, Wakeford was fired from Death in June for &quot;bringing his &#x27;right-wing leanings into the group&#x27;&quot;; at the time he had been a member of the National Front (UK). In 2007, Wakeford described his National Front membership as &quot;probably the worst decision of my life&quot;. Wakeford had also been a member of the Odinic Rite, a neopagan organization. After being fired from Death in June, Wakeford formed the post-punk band Above the Ruins, and in October 1984, they released a nine song demo album on cassette, &quot;Songs of the Wolf&quot;, which was distributed through the London-based P.O. box BCM Grimnir, and from the National Front bookshop in Croydon. The band&#x27;s lyrics denounced communism, capitalism and liberalism. The demo received a favorable review from &quot;Nationalism Today&quot;, the journal of the National Front. The following year, Above the Ruins contributed the song &quot;The Killing Zone&quot; to &quot;No Surrender&quot;, a compilation of recordings by white nationalist bands, and in late 1985, announced that their demo would be &quot;soon to be available on record&quot;.

===Sol Invictus===
In 1987, Wakeford distanced himself from right-wing views, and formed the neofolk band Sol Invictus, adapting the band&#x27;s name from a cult that predated Christianity. The band&#x27;s music combines acoustic guitar playing and &quot;neo-classical instrumentation&quot; with elements of industrial music. Due to Wakeford&#x27;s past political associations, Sol Invictus has been accused of neo-fascism. 

In 1990, Wakeford formed his own record label, Tursa. With distribution by World Serpent Distribution, Tursa released numerous albums by Sol Invictus, starting with &quot;Trees in Winter&quot;. After World Serpent dissolved in the 2000s, Cold Spring began distributing the band&#x27;s albums.

<text>The Bakun Dam () is an embankment dam located in Belaga District, Kapit Division, Sarawak, Malaysia, on the Balui River, a tributary or source of the Rajang River and some sixty kilometres east of Belaga. As part of the project, the second-tallest concrete-faced rockfill dam in the world would be built. It would generate 2,400 megawatts (MW) of electricity once completed.

The purpose for the dam was to meet growing demand for electricity. However, most of this demand is said to lie in Peninsular Malaysia and not East Malaysia, where the dam is located. Even in Peninsular Malaysia, however, there is an oversupply of electricity, with Tenaga Nasional Berhad being locked into unfavourable purchasing agreements with Independent Power Producers. The original idea was to have 30% of the generated capacity consumed in East Malaysia and the rest transmitted to Peninsular Malaysia. This plan envisioned 730 km of overhead HVDC transmission lines in East Malaysia, 670 km of undersea HVDC cable and 300 km of HVDC transmission line in Peninsular Malaysia.

Future plans for the dam include connecting it to an envisioned Trans-Borneo Power Grid Interconnection, which would be a grid to supply power to Sarawak, Sabah, Brunei, and Kalimantan (Indonesia). There have been mentions of this grid made within ASEAN meetings but no actions have been taken by any party. Bakun Dam came online on 6 August 2011. As of 2015, Bakun Dam is the biggest dam in Southeast Asia.

On 16 August 2017, Sarawak Energy completes acquisition of Bakun HEP from Federal Government. Under the deal, the Sarawak government will pay Putrajaya RM2.5 billion and take over the remaining RM6.4 billion remaining debts. Prime Minister Najib Razak handed over the dam to the Sarawak government on 5 April 2018.

== Project history ==

=== First attempt ===
Initial survey was conducted in the early 1960s and more studies were conducted in the early 1980s. The studies cover the masterplan and feasibility report, rock and soil studies, hydro potential, detailed design and costing, environmental and socio-economic studies and HVDC transmission studies. Notable consultants involved were SAMA Consortium German Agency for Technical Cooperation, Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and Maeda-Okumura Joint Venture, Fichtner and Swedpower Swedish Agency for Technical Cooperation.

Although the project was first approved by government in 1986, it was shelved in 1990 owing to decreased projection of electricity demand due to the recession of 1985 and the decision to use the then low-cost alternative of natural gas as fuel for developing the petrochemical industry.

=== Second attempt ===
It was revived in September 1993 by the Malaysian Federal Government led by then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. In January 1994, a privatised contract was awarded to Ekran Berhad. In April 1995, Ekran completed the EIA of the project. The project was to cost US$2.4 billion and was originally scheduled for completion in 2003.

The dam was to be built beginning in 1994 by a privatised joint-venture consortium called Bakun Hydroelectric Corporation, comprising Ekran Berhad, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), the government of Sarawak, Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation (Sesco), and Malaysia Mining Corporation Bhd (MMC).

Ekran awarded the electromechanical works and the transmission portion to ABB. ABB&#x27;s consortium partner for the civil works will be Companhia Brasileira de Projetos e Obras (CBPO) of Brazil, a large civil engineering company belonging to the Odebrecht Group, responsible for the construction of the dam and power house. Engineering consulting firms involved in the project then were TNB Hydro, a subsidiary of Tenaga Nasional Berhad and KLIA Consult.

Ekran launched a rights issue to finance the building of the dam, but it was undersubscribed and Ting Pek Khing (Ekran&#x27;s chairman) had to put up $500 million to take up the unsubscribed portion as part of his agreement with the underwriters. Ekran was a company of Ting Pek Khing, himself a timber businessman. Neither he nor his company had built a dam before. The entire project was not tendered publicly, and instead was awarded by government contract.

The project was halted in 1997 in the face of the Asian financial crisis. When the project was shelved, the Malaysian government took back the project from this consortium. By this time, RM1.6 billion had already been paid out by the government. RM700 million to RM1.1 billion was paid as &#x27;compensation&#x27; to Ekran, according to figures disclosed in Parliament. The completed works were the river diversion tunnels by Dong Ah of Korea for RM400 million, and to Global Upline for work completed on the auxiliary cofferdams for RM60 million. Other works are for selective clearing of biomass, and relocation of the affected native residents. The government had also turned over RM1 billion for the purchase of eight turbines.

=== Third attempt ===
In May 2000 it was revived through a 100% government-owned company, Sarawak Hidro, but the transmission of power to Peninsular Malaysia was not part of the revived project. The construction work was tendered out as a turnkey contract. The completion date has been revised to February 2008.

The new civil builder is the Malaysia–China Hydro JV consortium, led by Sime Engineering Berhad of Malaysia (a subsidiary of Sime Darby and Sinohydro Corporation of China. Other members of the consortium are WCT Berhad, MTD Capital, Ahmad Zaki Resources, Syarikat Ismail and Edward &amp; Sons. It targeted a completion date of September 2007. The total sum to be paid to this consortium was budgeted at RM1.8 billion. The electromechanical works for the turbines were awarded in two contracts to IMPSA of Argentina and Alstom of France.

In 2004, engineering consulting firm JR Knowles, was hired to study the delays in construction. Other engineering consulting firms involved in the project were Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation, of Australia and Opus International Malaysia.

==== Items of temporary interest during third attempt ====
In May 2004 Ting Pek Khing&#x27;s name again was raised in connection with the project. A Ting-owned company, Global Upline, was rumoured to have been awarded a contract to undertake &quot;biomass removal&quot; in the flood basin. This would allow him to harvest timber in the area without a separate permit. Issuance of timber permits has come under increased scrutiny due to political conditions and environmental concerns. However, as of December 2006 it has not been awarded.

Usage of the generated capacity was to have been by a proposed aluminium smelting plant in Similajau, near Bintulu, approximately 180 km inland from the dam. The project is a joint venture between Dubai Aluminum Co, Ltd (Dubal) and Gulf International Investment Group (GIIG), an investment fund jointly set up by Malaysian tycoon Syed Mokhtar, and Dubai-based international financier Mohamed Ali Alabbar. This plant was expected to consume 50% of the power generated. The government has agreed in principle that 60% of Sarawak Hidro, the entity that owns the dam, will be sold to GIIG. Owing to delays in dam construction, the plans for the smelter have since been shelved. The agreement for this smelter was originally signed in 2003 and some conditions have lapsed owing to delays in construction. Rio Tinto announced in August 2007 that they had signed a deal with Malaysian conglomerate Cahya Mata Sarawak Berhad (CMSB) to build an aluminium smelter. The production capacity would be 550,000 tonnes initially with expansion to 1.5 million tonnes possible. Production of aluminium would start at the end of 2010.

At the end of 2004, the minor partners in the Malaysia–China Hydro JV consortium (Ahmad Zaki Resources Bhd, WCT Engineering Bhd and MTD Capital) will report quarterly losses due to the Bakun project. Discounting this project, they would all be operating profitably for the quarter.
* For Ahmad Zaki Resources Bhd, this is the first time it will report losses since 1993. Ahmad Zaki estimates net losses suffered for nine months ending 30 September 2004 at RM4.55 million.
* WCT has reported a net loss of RM13.08 million for the quarter ending 30 September 2004 due to the Bakun project.
* MTD Capital reported a RM4.04 million loss in the quarter ending 30 September 2004 and attributed it to &quot;a major project undertaken by the company in joint venture with both local and foreign partners&quot; without specifically naming Bakun.
* The lead partner in the project, Sime Engineering reported a profit of RM521,000 for the same quarter versus a profit of RM4.18 million for the same quarter in 2003. Declines in profit were attributed to cost overruns and project delays.

As of February 2007, there are three developments affecting the Bakun project. The first is the merger of the Sime Darby, Guthrie and Golden Hope into a new entity named Synergy Drive. The second is the proposed takeover of the Bakun project by the contractor, Sime Engineering. The third is the revival of the submarine HVDC cable under the South China Sea to transmit electricity from Borneo to Peninsular Malaysia.

In November 2007, Sime Darby, the parent company of the contractor Sime Engineering will be merged with Golden Hope and Guthrie into a new company with a market capitalisation of RM31 billion (US$8 billion). Concurrently with the merger, the contractor Sime Engineering will takeover the ownership of the Bakun Dam project.

Sime Engineering Sdn Bhd has filed a suit against AZRB over alleged breaches in the Malaysia–China Hydro joint venture agreement dated 12 June 2002 relating to the Bakun dam. AZRB was served with a writ summons and statement of claim dated 12 Oct by Sime Engineering claiming &quot;RM15.24 million for alleged breaches by AZRB of the Malaysia–China Hydro JVA&quot; relating to Bakun hydroelectric project package CW2 – main civil works.

====Sinohydro flawed construction procedures====
Chinese constructor Sinohydro has acknowledged that its construction procedures used for Bakun were flawed. The admission came after &quot;Sarawak Report&quot; reported that Sinohydro had widely used a technique involving adding excessive water to cement, with potentially dangerous consequences. The &quot;Sarawak Report&quot; said its website was attacked by Chinese scammers after it published the report.

== Environmental and social damage ==

The Bakun dam flooding commenced on 13 October 2010 with a faulty start and will put 700 km2 of land underwater – equivalent to the size of Singapore. The rainforest of this part of Southeast Asia has some of the highest rates of plant and animal endemism, species found there and nowhere else on Earth, and this dam has done irreparable ecological damage to that region.

Construction of the dam required the relocation of more than 9,000 native residents (mainly Kayan/Kenyah) of the indigenous peoples who lived in the area to be flooded. Many Sarawak natives have been relocated to a longhouse settlement named Sungai Asap in Bakun. Most of them were subsistence farmers. Each family was promised 3 acres (1.21 ha) of land but many families still have not been compensated.

Concerns were raised also about such things as the relocation of people; the amount of virgin tropical rainforest that had to be cut down (230 km2); possible dam collapse issues; increase in diseases with waterborne vectors such as schistosomiasis, opisthorchiasis, malaria, and filariasis; and sediment accumulation shortening the useful lifespan of the dam. A 5-part series of Bakun dam documentaries was filmed by Chou Z Lam. The series highlighted the basic community problems faced by displaced indigenous people such as the lack of land areas for farming and hunting caused by the flooding, lack of educational, medical, and transport facilities, and also the promises not being kept by the government. This documentary series was later banned from Radio Television Malaysia (RTM) in May 2010, forcing the remaining series to YouTube.

Transparency International includes Bakun Dam in its &#x27;Monuments of corruption&#x27; Global Corruption Report 2005. The mandate to develop the project went to a timber contractor and friend of Sarawak&#x27;s governor. The provincial government of Sarawak is still looking for customers to consume the power to be generated by the project.

Launched in February 2012, an international NGO coalition that includes organisations from the US, Norway and Switzerland is showing its solidarity with Malaysian groups who are protesting against the construction of twelve hydroelectric dams in the Malaysian state of Sarawak on Borneo. The NGO coalition supports the Malaysian groups&#x27; demand for an immediate halt to the realisation of these dams, which threaten to displace tens of thousands of Sarawak natives and flood hundreds of square miles of Sarawak&#x27;s precious tropical rainforests.

== Technical specifications ==
The permanent dam components are as follows:
*Main dam
**Maximum height above foundation of 205 m, and crest length of 750 m, volume of fill is 16,710,000 m3.
**Crest elevation is 235 m above sea level (ASL), maximum flood level is 232 m, operating levels maximum 228 m and minimum 195 m.
**Reservoir area at 228 m ASL is 695 km2, and with a catchment area of 14,750 km2. Gross storage volume is 43,800 million cubic meters.
*Power intake structure – 8 bays with 16 roller gates.
*Gated spillway – gated concrete weir with chute and flip bucket, with capacity of 15,000 cubic meters per second.
*Power tunnels – 8 tunnels of 8.5 m diameter each with lengths of 760 m each.
*Powerhouse
**Surface powerhouse, with 4-level measuring 250 m length × 48 m width × 48 m height
**with 8 penstocks to powertrains comprising 8 vertical-shaft Francis turbines of 300 MW each, 8 air-cooled generators of 360 MVA each and 8 oil-immersed transformers of 360 MVA each.

== Transmission lines ==
There are four major transmission line sections:

The first consists of an HVAC double circuit overhead line running over a distance of 160 km from Bakun Dam to Similajau Static Inverter Plant, situated east of Bintulu.

The three further sections consist of a bipolar HVDC 500 kV line. The first section of this line running from Similajau Static Inverter Plant to Kampung Pueh on Borneo will be implemented as overhead lines with a length of 670 km.

The next section is the submarine cable between Kampung Pueh to Tanjung Leman, Johor. It will have a length of 670 km. It is planned to be implemented by 3 or 4 parallel cables each with a transmission capacity of 700 MW.

The last section on the Malay Peninsula will consist of an overhead DC powerline running from Tanjung Leman to the static inverter plant at Bentong.

As part of the transmission works two converter stations will be built at Bakun and Tanjung Tenggara. The HVDC lines will connect to the National Grid, Malaysia operated by Tenaga Nasional Berhad.

=== Revival of submarine cable component ===
The revived submarine cable portion is to transmit the electricity generated at Bakun Dam in Borneo to Peninsular Malaysia, possibly by 2012. The consortium partners&#x27; equity possibly will be Sime Darby (60%), Tenaga Nasional (20%) and the Malaysian Ministry of Finance (20%). The consortium is exploring financing facilities of up to 80% of the planned investment.

The cable is planned to transmit 1,600 MW of power from the Bakun Dam to Yong Peng, Johor by undersea HVDC power cables and then by land line onto the Malaysian National Grid. The use of HVDC cables would ensure that the energy loss is minimal, at about 5% to 6% only. The cost of the undersea cable is estimated at RM9 billion. The proposed concept is for two 800 MW cables being laid about 660 km under the South China Sea from the Sarawak shore to Yong Peng on Peninsular Malaysia.

Sime Darby would take ownership of the submarine cable project but not undertake its construction. The contractor is rumoured to be Malaysian Resources Corporation Berhad (MRCB), a public listed company on the KLSE.

The buyer of the electricity is Tenaga Nasional. The rate proposed is RM0.17 per kilowatt hour at the intake onto the National Grid. Analysts estimated that generation cost using world-market-rate natural gas would cost RM0.22 per kilowatt hour. A 4% increase every 4 years is envisaged over the 35-year concession period.

On 7 January 2008, Sime Darby announced that they had appointed a financial adviser for the undersea power transmission project. However, the company did not name the financial adviser.

After many delays, Sarawak Energy Berhad announced that the contract to build the submarine cable would be awarded in mid-2010 with international tenders to be called in early 2010. It was expected that the construction would be completed by 2015 at an estimated cost of MYR8 billion to MYR10 billion. However, the project has been shelved.

== Records ==
Once completed:
* Bakun Dam will be the tallest concrete-faced rockfill dam (CFRD) in the world.
* Bakun Lake will be the biggest lake in Malaysia by storage volume.
* Bakun Lake will be the largest lake in Malaysia by surface area, even though it is not apparent on the map, owing to the narrow shapes of the various lake arms, as a result of its location in the highland valleys.
* Bakun Power Station will be the largest hydroelectric dam in Malaysia, surpassing the currently largest Pergau Dam.
* Bakun submarine power cable will be the longest in the world, surpassing the current Norway-to-Netherlands submarine cable.

<doc id="1110815" wikidata="Q673817" url="?curid=1110815" title="Cape Foulwind">
<text>Cape Foulwind is a headland on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand, overlooking the Tasman Sea. It is located west of the town of Westport. There is a lighthouse located on a prominent site on the headland. A walkway beginning at the lighthouse carpark traverses the rocky headland to Tauranga Bay and passes close by a colony of New Zealand fur seals. There is limestone quarry in the area, and a cement works operated nearby from 1958 to 2016.

In the lee of the cape, eastwards toward the Buller River mouth, lies Carters Beach, which is claimed to be the only safe swimming beach on the West Coast of the South Island.

== Toponymy ==
The headland was initially named Rocky Cape by Abel Tasman, the first European to sight it, in 1642. However, the current name, Cape Foulwind, was given by English explorer James Cook in 1770 after his ship &quot;Endeavour,&quot; was blown quite a distance offshore from this point.

== Lighthouse ==

The first lighthouse at Cape Foulwind was illuminated on 1 September 1876. However, the timber support structure of this initial lighthouse did not survive the environmental conditions. Consequently, a replacement lighthouse was erected on a concrete tower in 1926. Operated by Maritime New Zealand, the lighthouse is registered as a Category 2 Historic Place.

== Walkway ==

The Cape Foulwind Walkway is a (one-way) path situated above rocky headlands, extending from Tauranga Bay to the carpark at the Cape Foulwind Lighthouse. Notable features of the walkway encompass views of mountains and coastline, a thriving colony of New Zealand fur seals (kekeno), and the lighthouse. The cliffs of Cape Foulwind, along with the adjacent small offshore islands, serve as roosting and breeding grounds for various seabird species, such as Australasian gannets. sooty shearwaters, fluttering shearwaters and fairy prions. Wall island, a small rocky islet, offshore from the seal colony at Tauranga Bay, plays a vital role as habitat for seabird colonies and Little penguins (kororā). Additionally, there is a chance to occasionally spot Hector&#x27;s dolphin and orcas from the walkway.

== Cement works ==

In 1924, the &quot;Grey River Argus&quot; reported that the National Portland Cement Company was to be floated, to mine and process deposits of limestone and marl at Cape Foulwind. A proposal to establish a cement works at Cape Foulwind was announced in 1946. In 1953, it was reported that British interests had purchased a large area of land at Cape Foulwind. However, it was not until 1955 that the British company Tunnel Portland Cement (subsequently Hanson Cement) made a firm commitment to construct a plant. The plant, with an expected production capability of 120,000 tons per annum, was set to employ 200 workers and utilise 40,000 tonnes of Buller coal annually. The capital required for the plant would be £2,500,000, with only £100,000 to be raised in New Zealand.

The new plant at Cape Foulwind commenced production in November 1958, and its official opening took place on 15 February 1959.

In 2013, Holcim, the owner, announced plans to close the factory and cease cement production in New Zealand. The Cape Foulwind cement works ceased operations in June 2016 after 58 years, resulting in the loss of 105 jobs.

== Mineral sands mining ==
In May 2022, Westland Mineral Sands, a mining company, was granted resource consent by a joint hearings panel of the West Coast Regional Council and Buller District Council for a proposal to mine 500,000 tonnes of mineral sands over seven years, at its property at Okari, south of Cape Foulwind. A group of local residents appealed the decision of the hearings panel in the Environment Court, seeking lower noise level limits and more restrictions on operating hours.

The mining of mineral sands was projected to begin in October 2022, with to be strip-mined at a time.

== Railway line ==

The Cape Foulwind Railway was a branch railway line built in 1886 by the Westport Harbour Board, to transport rocks from their quarry to the breakwaters in the Buller River.

== Three Steeples Rocks and Black Reef ==

The Three Steeples and Black Reef are 28 rocky islets, rising to a bit over high, approximately north of Cape Foulwind. They are granite rocks, named by Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville as Les Trois Cloches on 12 January 1827 and depicted as Three Steeples on James Wyld&#x27;s 1839 map. They had been known to sealers as Black Rocks since at least 1826. Patrick O&#x27;Regan thought these were the rocks illustrated by Isaack Gilsemans, when Tasman first anchored in New Zealand waters on 14 December 1642. The Dutch inscription beneath the drawings has been translated as the Rocky Point.

The lighthouse has proven effective, with no recorded wrecks on the rocks. However, in 1881, the Anchor Shipping and Foundry Company&#x27;s paddle steamer Charles Edward (1864-1908) was holed and then towed to Westport. Similarly, in 1946, the Union Steamship&#x27;s collier, Karepo, stranded on the rocks in a thick fog, but was later floated off. A navigable channel, about wide, runs between the Cape and Black Reef.

Spotted shags roost on the Steeples, where salt-resistant taupata grows on the rock tops.

Rock lobster (), blue cod (), gurnard (), sharks and snapper () are fished around the rocks and orca probably feed off the fur seal colonies. The shellfish Cantharidus puysegurensis and Leptomya retiaria have been found on the rocks.

<doc id="1110818" wikidata="Q3117685" url="?curid=1110818" title="Held group">
<text>In the area of modern algebra known as group theory, the Held group &quot;He&quot; is a sporadic simple group of order
:   4,030,387,200 = 21033527317
: ≈ 4.

==History==
&quot;He&quot; is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was found by during an investigation of simple groups containing an involution whose centralizer is an extension of the extra special group 21+6 by the linear group L3(2), which is the same involution centralizer as the Mathieu group M24. A second such group is the linear group L5(2). The Held group is the third possibility, and its construction was completed by John McKay and Graham Higman. In all of these groups, the extension splits.

The outer automorphism group has order 2 and the Schur multiplier is trivial.

== Representations ==

The smallest faithful complex representation has dimension 51; there are two such representations that are duals of each other. 

It centralizes an element of order 7 in the Monster group. As a result the prime 7 plays a special role in the theory of the group; for example, the smallest representation of the Held group over any field is the 50-dimensional representation over the field with 7 elements, and it acts naturally on a vertex operator algebra over the field with 7 elements.

The smallest permutation representation is a rank 5 action on 2058 points with point stabilizer Sp4(4):2. The graph associated with this representation has rank 5 and is directed; the outer automorphism reverses the direction of the edges, decreasing the rank to 4.

Since He is the normalizer of a Frobenius group 7:3 in the Monster group, it does not just commute with a 7-cycle, but also some 3-cycles. Each of these 3-cycles is normalized by the Fischer group Fi24, so He:2 is a subgroup of the derived subgroup Fi24&#x27; (the non-simple group Fi24 has 2 conjugacy classes of He:2, which are fused by an outer automorphism). As mentioned above, the smallest permutation representation of He has 2058 points, and when realized inside Fi24&#x27;, there is an orbit of 2058 transpositions.

==Generalized monstrous moonshine==

Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups. For &quot;He&quot;, the relevant McKay-Thompson series is formula_1 where one can set the constant term a(0) = 10 (),

:formula_2

and &quot;η&quot;(&quot;τ&quot;) is the Dedekind eta function.

==Presentation==
It can be defined in terms of the generators &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and relations
:formula_3

==Maximal subgroups==
 found the 11 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of &quot;He&quot; as follows:

<text>Turner is a suburb in the Australian city of Canberra, close to Canberra City and the Australian National University (located in the suburb of Acton).

Turner is named after Sir George Turner, a Federalist, legislator and one of the founders of the Australian Constitution. He was the 18th Premier of Victoria, and later Federal Treasurer under prime ministers Barton, Deakin and Reid. Streets in Turner are mostly named after writers, legislators and pioneers.

==Demographics==

Only 12.5% of dwellings were separate houses (compared to the Australian average of 72.3%), while 13.8% were semi-detached, row or terrace houses (Australian average: 12.6%) and 73.2% were flats, units or apartments (Australian average: 14.2%). 45.1% of the population were professionals, compared to the Australian average of 24.0%. Notably 25.1% worked in central government administration, compared to the Australian average of 1.1%, although the ACT-wide average is 17.1%. Turner is favoured by students and young adults with 48.1% of its population in the 20- to 34-year-old age group (compared to the Australian average of 20.5%). The suburb has few children under 15: 7.7%, compared to 18.2% Australia-wide. 38.5% of the dwellings are occupied by single person households, compared to the Australian average of 25.6%. 59.9% of the population had no religion, while 12.3% were Catholic, 4.7% not stated, 4.6% Anglican and 3.1% Hindu.

Turner was developed in the 1940s and 1950s. The suburb is an example of garden city design with wide nature strips and generously proportioned roads.

Turner, though a small suburb, can be divided into three logical areas:
* The south east area which is bounded by Northbourne Avenue, Barry Drive, Watson Street (Turner Parkland) and Masson Street (Haig Park). This area was first developed in the 1940s and originally consisted of detached dwellings. Very few of these houses remain after early twenty-first century redevelopment, the low-density housing having been replaced by medium-density unit blocks.
* The western part which is bounded by Barry Drive, David Street and McCaughey Street consists mainly of detached dwellings.
* The northern part of the suburb which is bounded by Northbourne Avenue, David Street, McCaughey Street and Greenway Street consists of a mixture of detached dwellings, town houses and flats.

David Street which forms Turner&#x27;s northern boundary is designed to line up with Black Mountain in one direction and Mount Majura in the other direction.

Original block sizes were generous in Turner, ranging from around 800 m2 to 1400 m2, with some even reaching 1600 m2. 900–1000 m2 is typical. In the postwar period when resources were scarce, disproportionately small houses were built on these large blocks that are now inner city. This has made Turner blocks well suited for redevelopment, whether it be for units, townhouses, dual occupancies or occasional luxury houses. It was quite usual with the original buildings to have tiny three bedroom and even two bedroom houses on the blocks with floor areas of around 85 m2 – 110 m2. These houses were not only small but typically had tiny windows and were poorly positioned on the block for solar access – an important consideration in Canberra&#x27;s cold climate. Houses were typically positioned for aesthetic effect with various ideas like inner-corner semi-detached (Hackett Gardens), facing the corner (Macleay Street) or symmetrical arrangements between the houses (Holder Street).

Few houses remain in their original unextended state. Floor plans of the original government designed and built houses can be obtained from the local planning authorities. Many houses have been replaced by multi-story unit developments. The scale of redevelopment post-2000 has been significant—the population in the suburb has grown from 1,852 people in 2001 to 3,010 in 2006 and 3,595 in 2011.

A number of artifacts of the original design of Turner can still be seen. Firstly, as is typical for Canberra, powerlines are behind the houses so as not to interfere with street trees. Street lamps are low and designed for pedestrians. Several different designs of lamp were installed originally, and examples of each can be still be seen. Some streets have footpaths with the house numbers imprinted on the concrete and red fire hydrants can be seen in some areas. Because the suburb&#x27;s construction was interrupted by the war, various ideas can be seen in the layout of footpaths. For example, in the southern areas, footpaths cut off the diagonal of the block. McKay Gardens has service lanes, uncharacteristic both of the suburb and the Canberra region.

Many of the single houses between Sullivans Creek and Northbourne Avenue have been replaced by two and three storey flats in recent years as a result of being zoned in the Inner North Precinct. Land adjoining Northbourne Avenue (except Havelock House) is now zoned to permit redevelopment with 25 metre (about 8 storeys) high flats or 32 metres (about 11 storeys) at the corners of Macarthur Avenue with Northbourne Avenue. Low-rise offices are permitted in a small area in the southeast of the suburb around McKay Gardens.

==Suburb amenities==
Turner has a combined Special-Education and Mainstream Public school situated between David, Hartley and Condamine Streets, with a combined Pre-school. Child-care centres in the suburb include:
* Christopher Robin&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Garden (Watson Street)
* Sage Education and Childcare (Moore Street)
* Treehouse in the Park (Ormond Street)

Turner has several churches:
* a Baptist Church (Condamine Street),
* a Ukrainian Orthodox Church (McKay Gardens),
* a Seventh-day Adventist Church (MacLeay Street),
* a Lutheran Church (Watson Street)
* a Friends Meeting House (Quakers Church) (Corner of Bent and Condamine Streets)
* a Korean Full Gospel church meeting at the Baptist church.

It also has a tennis club (in Condamine Street) and lawn bowls club (in McCaughey Street) and several ethnic clubs, a French association (the Alliance Française) (in McCaughey Street) and Polish club (in David Street) and Croatian club (in McCaughey Street). There was a police youth club on Watson Street (relocated to West Belconnen in late 2006 due to costly maintenance issues with the building).

Turner is within walking distance of the CBD and the Australian National University. The suburb adjoins the local O&#x27;Connor shops.

==Open space==
Turner has a high proportion of parks and open space. This is due to a number of factors:
* It contains half of Haig Park – a large park of pine trees originally built as a barrier to reduce dust from affecting the city, when Canberra was still mostly a sheep station.
* It contains a flood/drainage reserve associated with Sullivans Creek which makes up a large portion of parkland.
* It contains several public sports ovals.
* It contains Turner primary school which has a generous oval and open space.
* It contains a Tennis club attached to Haig Park.

== Politics ==

Turner is located within the federal electorate of Canberra and it is represented by Alicia Payne for the Labor Party. In the ACT Legislative Assembly, Turner is part of the electorate of Kurrajong, which elects five members on the basis of proportional representation, two Labor, one Green, one Liberal and one Independent. Polling place statistics are shown to the right for the &quot;Turner&quot; polling place at Turner School in the 2022 federal and 2020 ACT elections.

==Geology==

Calcareous shales from the Canberra Formation are overlain by Quaternary alluvium. This rock is the limestone of the original title of Canberra &quot;Limestone Plains&quot;.

Several fault lines pass through Turner including the inactive Acton Fault.

He has been nominated six times for a Laurence Olivier Award, and has won three times.

== Life and career ==
Allam was born in Bow, London, England. He was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital and Manchester University. His father was rector of St Mary Woolnoth.

He played Mercutio for the Royal Shakespeare Company, in 1983.

From 1985 to 1986, he played Inspector Javert in the original London production of the stage musical &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

He has also appeared in many radio dramas for the BBC. In 2001, he starred in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, as Valjean. In 2000 he played Adolf Hitler at the Royal National Theatre in David Edgar&#x27;s &quot;Albert Speer&quot;. He won an Olivier Award as Best Actor 2001, for his role as Captain Terri Denis in a revival of &quot;Privates on Parade&quot;, opening in December 2001 at the Donmar Warehouse, Covent Garden. In November 2002 at the Comedy Theatre he co-starred with Gillian Anderson in Michael Weller&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;What the Night Is For&quot;.

In 2003, he appeared as former West German federal chancellor Willy Brandt in Michael Frayn&#x27;s play &quot;Democracy&quot; which opened at the Cottesloe Theatre, in the Royal National Theatre. He stayed with the show for its transfer to the West End. In December 2004 and January 2005, Allam appeared as the villainous Abanazar in a pantomime of &quot;Aladdin&quot; at the Old Vic theatre, co-starring Ian McKellen, Maureen Lipman and Sam Kelly. He reprised this role at the Old Vic, once again with Ian McKellen and Frances Barber in 2006–07. In August 2005, Allam appeared in &quot;Blackbird&quot; by David Harrower alongside Jodhi May at the Edinburgh Festival in a production by German star director Peter Stein. The play transferred to the Albery Theatre in London in February 2006. &quot;Blackbird&quot; subsequently won a best new play award.

In 2006 he appeared in Stephen Frears&#x27;s film &quot;The Queen&quot;, starring Oscar-winner Dame Helen Mirren, as the Queen&#x27;s private secretary. In February 2007, he performed in the 1960s farce &quot;Boeing-Boeing&quot; at the Comedy Theatre in the West End, co-starring Mark Rylance, Frances de la Tour and Tamzin Outhwaite. In 2007, he appeared for the first time as Peter Mannion MP in the special episodes of the BBC comedy &quot;The Thick of It&quot;. He reprised the role in the third series (2009), and returned in the final series (2012) as part of the expanded regular cast.

In 2008, Allam played the role of Max Reinhardt, the Salzburg Festival impresario in Michael Frayn&#x27;s play &quot;Afterlife&quot;, the production staged by Michael Blakemore on the National Theatre&#x27;s Lyttelton stage. In 2009, Allam played Albin/Zaza in &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; at the Playhouse in London. Allam played Falstaff in &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe, in the 2010 season. He won the Olivier Award for Best Actor. In October 2010, Allam was reunited with his former cast mates from &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in the 25th anniversary concert for a performance of &quot;One Day More&quot;.

In January 2012, he starred in the first series of &quot;Endeavour&quot;, the prequel to the long-running &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, playing the gruff but kind-hearted Detective Inspector Fred Thursday, young Endeavour Morse&#x27;s mentor in 1960s Oxford. By 2018 Allam had portrayed his central character in five additional well-received series, which are also aired in America as part of the PBS Masterpiece Mystery! series. In March 2019, the show&#x27;s sixth season had concluded on ITV, was scheduled for broadcast in the summer in the United States, and had been recommissioned for a seventh season to be set in 1970.

In April 2012 he also starred as Serebrayakov in the play &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; by Anton Chekhov at the Chichester Festival Theatre. In 2013 he played the role of Prospero in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot; at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe theatre in London alongside Colin Morgan as Ariel. Allam presented Michael Frayn at the 2013 Olivier Awards with a Special Lifetime Award which was aired by ITV1. Allam has also reteamed with Stephen Frears in &quot;Tamara Drewe&quot;, the film version of Posy Simmond&#x27;s popular comic strip. He plays the crime novelist Nicholas Hardiment, who is bewitched by London journalist Tamara Drewe, played by Gemma Arterton. In the closing chapter of his &quot;Timebends&quot; autobiography (1987) Arthur Miller writes of Allam: &quot;To play Adrian...in the 1986 Royal Shakespeare Company production of &quot;The Archbishop&#x27;s Ceiling&quot;, Roger Allam gave up the leading role as Javert in the monster hit &quot;Les Misérables&quot; because he had done it over sixty times and thought my play more challenging for him at that moment of his career. Nor did he consider his decision a particularly courageous one. This is part of what a theatre culture means and it is something few New York actors would have the sense of security even to dream of doing.&quot;

Allam narrated the Channel 4 series &quot;The Auction House&quot;.

In October and November 2016 Allam appeared as Brigadier Adrian Stone in the BBC series &quot;The Missing&quot;.

Since January 2020, Allam has co-starred with Joanna Lumley in the BBC Radio 4 comedy drama series &quot;Conversations from a Long Marriage&quot;. As of February 2023, the show is in its fourth series.

In March 2022, Allam debuted in the lead role of Antoine Verlaque in &quot;Murder in Provence&quot;, a BritBox cosy crime drama based on the Verlaque &amp; Bonnet detective novels by ML Longworth, alongside Nancy Carroll as his romantic partner Marine Bonnet.

Allam voices the demon Azazel in the 2022 Netflix adaptation of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot;.

==Personal life==
Allam is married to actress Rebecca Saire, with whom he has two sons, William, an actor, and Thomas. Rebecca and William appeared together as mother and son in the &quot;Endeavour&quot; episode Raga (series 7, episode 2, broadcast February 2020).

<doc id="1110834" wikidata="Q15222068" url="?curid=1110834" title="Great Karimun">
<text>Great Karimun (), also known as Mawas Island, is one of the islands in the Riau Islands province of Indonesia, administratively part of Karimun Regency. It lies about 37 km southwest of Singapore, 54 km west of Batam, 24 km northeast of Rangsang Island and 32 km north of Kundur Island.

==History==
In the past, Great Karimun Island was the destination of foreign traders and the Malay Kings. Sixteenth century Portuguese reports claimed that the island was inhabited, possibly by the Orang Laut. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the island was part of the Johor Sultanate then the Riau-Lingga Sultanate.

Around 1615 agents of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) inspected the northwestern coast of the island for the possible construction of a fortification. The proposed fort, however, was never built. Two centuries later, Colonel William Farquhar surveyed the island after receiving permission from the Bugis Raja Muda of Johor, Raja Ja&#x27;afar. Although Karimun was deemed to be of great strategic value at the confluence of the Singapore and Melaka Straits, it was found to have insufficient sources fresh water to sustain a British trading post and a settlement.

== Geography ==

The island&#x27;s main city is Tanjung Balai Karimun. As at the 2020 Census, the regency of Karimun had a population of 253,457 with the majority of the people living in Great Karimun. Notable landmarks on the island include Mount Jantan, the beaches of Pelawan and Pongkar, and the Pongkar Waterfall.

== Economics ==
The island has strategic geographical importance, as it is near the Straits of Malacca, an international shipping route. As the island is strategically located at the border of Singapore and Johor (in Malaysia), Karimun being a part of the Riau Islands also is included the SIJORI Growth Triangle partnership. SIJORI (Singapore-Johor-Riau Islands) Growth Triangle is a strategic partnership among Singapore, Johor and Riau Islands that combine the individual and collective strength to improve the subregion attractiveness to investors from both the region and international. SIJORI links the infrastructure, capital, expertise and rich culture of Singapore with the natural resources, lands and labour resources of Johor and Riau Islands.

However, due to the stronger ties between Singapore and Malaysia, Karimun is losing its economic attraction to Singaporean investments. Another reason for the loss in attractiveness is the lack of adequate infrastructure in Karimun, especially electricity supply and the lack of transparency in the government administration.

== Natural resources ==


Due to large scale indiscriminate fishing activity near the island recently, fish stocks have been depleted, and thus the fishing businesses have declined considerably.

The main export of the island is its granite which is one of the best quality in the world.

Sand has also been constantly exported, mainly to Singapore for land reclamation. Indonesian has however limited sand exports over concerns with Singapore&#x27;s reclamation projects, and banned them outright in the beginning of 2007.

<doc id="1110837" wikidata="Q2007551" url="?curid=1110837" title="Richard Harrison (actor)">
<text>Richard Harrison (born May 26, 1936) is an American actor, writer, director and producer known for his work in European B-movies during the 1960s and 1970s, and exploitation films of the early 1970s. 

He has worked with directors such as Antonio Margheriti and Marino Girolami and Z-movie directors like Paolo Solvay, Godfrey Ho, and Alfonso Brescia. Harrison has also worked with a variety of co-stars ranging from Anita Ekberg, Michèle Mercier, Klaus Kinski, Fernando Sanco, and Helmut Berger to popular actors such as Mike Monty and Romano Kristoff.

==Early life==
Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Harrison moved to Los Angeles at 17, where he was first employed at the Vic Tanny and Bert Goodrich gyms. Certain people working in the film industry trained at the gym and these encounters led Harrison to study acting. In 1961 he married Loretta Nicholson, the daughter of American International Pictures co-chief James H. Nicholson.

==American film appearances==
He appeared in a Santa Monica stage production, TV, and small parts in feature films. Next, Harrison worked at Twentieth Century Fox under acting coach Sandy Meisner, where he made an appearance at the beginning of &quot;South Pacific&quot; along with Tom Laughlin and Ron Ely. He eventually signed a three-film deal with American International Pictures, which led him to Italy, where he remained for almost three decades, appearing in sword and sandal films, then Eurospy films and Spaghetti Westerns. Formal acting studies differentiated Harrison from other muscular American actors working in Italy in the early 1960s, such as Brad Harris and Steve Reeves, with whom he is often grouped.

==1960s European movies==
Harrison relocated to Italy in the early 1960s with his first wife Loretta, initially in a three-picture contract with producer Italo Zingarelli. He remained in Italy and became a lead in sword and sandal films, Eurospy films, and later Spaghetti Westerns. His first Italian film and first starring role were in &quot;The Invincible Gladiator&quot; (1962), directed by Alberto De Martino and Antonio Momplet. Harrison&#x27;s most well-known film from his early career is the western &quot;Gunfight at Red Sands&quot; (&quot;Duello Nel Texas&quot;), directed by Ricardo Blasco in 1963. Harrison turned down Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; and recommended Clint Eastwood for the role. Harrison joked that this was his greatest contribution to cinema.

Harrison also acted in the 1968 film &quot;Joko - Invoca Dio... e muori&quot; &quot;Vengeance&quot;, directed by Antonio Margheriti. Luciano Martino&#x27;s 1965 movie &quot;Secret Agent Fireball&quot;, Harrison&#x27;s first Eurospy film, is also often cited as his best film in the genre and one of his better earlier films. He again played the role of CIA Agent Fleming in a sequel, &quot;Killers Are Challenged&quot;, in 1966.

The Italian actor Bruno Piergentili who made European features during this period was given the name &quot;Dan Harrison,&quot; perhaps to evoke Richard&#x27;s name.

==1970s exploitation films==
Harrison’s career declined gradually in the 1970s, coinciding with the decline of Spaghetti Westerns. He began appearing in lower-budget movies shot all over the world: In Egypt (&quot;You Can Do a Lot with 7 Women&quot;, 1971), with the Shaw Brothers in Hong Kong starring in the title role of &quot;Marco Polo&quot; (1975) and playing the German commander von Waldersee in &quot;The Boxer Rebellion&quot; (1976). Harrison worked in Turkey (&quot;The Godfather&#x27;s Friend&quot;, 1972), directed by Farouk &quot;Frank&quot; Agrama, and as Sgt. Taylor in a Yugoslavian war film, the 1979 effort &quot;Pakleni otok&quot;, led by Vladimir Tadej.

He directed several notable films in the first half of the 1970s, including the comedic Spaghetti Western &quot;Due Fratelli&quot;, also known as &quot;Two Brothers in Trinity&quot; (1972). His co-star in &quot;Due Fratelli&quot; was the Irish American actor Donald O&#x27;Brien. Harrison and O&#x27;Brien played two estranged brothers who rejoined after receiving an inheritance, Harrison a &quot;lovable rogue&quot; and O&#x27;Brien a pious Mormon. Harrison wants to spend his money on building a bordello, and comic adventures in the spirit of the Terence Hill/Bud Spencer hit &quot;My Name is Trinity&quot; (1971) follow.

Other notable early 1970s films were &quot;Churchill&#x27;s Leopards&quot; (1970), directed by Maurizio Pradeaux and also starring Giacomo Rossi Stuart and Klaus Kinski, in which Harrison played a double role; &quot;Acquasanta Joe&quot; (1971), directed by Mario Gariazzo and starring Ty Hardin and Lincoln Tate; and &quot;Dig Your Grave, Friend...Sabata&#x27;s Coming&quot; (1971), directed by Juan Bosch, is a western livened up by the presence of Spanish actor Fernando Sancho. Harrison acted in several films with Sancho, the archetypal Mexican bandit of paella and Spaghetti Westerns, most of which were produced and/or directed by Ignacio F. Aquino.

One of the more successful Harrison films from the latter half of the 1970s was the Italian crime thriller &quot;La Belva Col Mitra&quot; (1977), &quot;Beast With a Gun&quot;, directed by Sergio Grieco, also starring Helmut Berger and Marisa Mell. Harrison played the part of Police Commissioner Giulio Santini, with top-billed Berger as psychotic criminal Nanni Vitali, out to kill Santini and everyone else who testified against him in court. &quot;La Belva Col Mitra&quot; had some controversy, apparently, Harrison&#x27;s scenes were cut down in the film at Berger&#x27;s request.

A notable curio in Harrison&#x27;s 1970s filmography is the 1971 film &quot;L&#x27;Explosion&quot;, directed by Marc Simenon (the son of Georges Simenon) and co-starring Mylène Demongeot. The 1978 martial arts/spy film &quot;Challenge of the Tiger&quot; is also of curio interest, if only for the presence of Bruce Lee imitator Bruce Le (who also directed the film, with noncredit help from Paolo Solvay), European softcore star Nadiuska and Harrison&#x27;s son Sebastian.

==Z-movies in Asia==
During the 1980s, Harrison primarily appeared in B-movie action films produced in the Philippines and Hong Kong. While these films are often regarded as a low point in his career, some of his works from that era have developed a cult following.

In the Philippines, Harrison acted in five ultralow-budget actioners, best classified as Z-movies, produced by K.Y. Lim for &quot;Silver Star Film Company&quot; (called &quot;Kinavesa&quot; in the Philippines). Three, &quot;Fireback&quot;, &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Crossing&quot; and &quot;Blood, Debts&quot; (1985), were directed by Teddy Page, and two, &quot;Intrusion Cambodia&quot; (1984) and &quot;Rescue Team&quot; by John Gale. In the books &quot;Gods in Polyester&quot; and &quot;Gods in Spandex&quot;, Harrison states that he wrote some of the screenplays for Filipino films practically overnight, using a pseudonym. For example, Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Fireback&quot; screenplay Harrison wrote is credited to &quot;Timothy Jorge,&quot; a pseudonym usually used by Don Gordon Bell, one of the expatriate American actors working for Silver Star. Harrison also mentions that the &quot;Silver Star&quot; films he acted in didn&#x27;t have complete shooting scripts, and many scenes were improvised on the spot, contributing to their disjointed narrative.

&quot;Silver Star&quot; reused the same group of American and European expatriate actors from film to film, all appearing in the Harrison vehicles. Mike Monty, an old acquaintance of Harrison from the Italian days who had migrated to the archipelago, James Gaines, Romano Kristoff, Bruce Baron, Ann Milhench, and others. Harrison struck a friendship with Kristoff, one of the leading &quot;Silver Star&quot; actors, and later invited him to Italy to act in a film he produced and directed, &quot;Three Men on Fire&quot; (1986).

When they were made, the poor quality of Filipino films hurt Harrison&#x27;s reputation. However, they have attracted cult interest in some movie fandoms over the years. Although he fondly remembers Teddy Page, Harrison doesn&#x27;t have kind words for Lim and working for the &quot;Silver Star&quot;.

In Hong Kong, Harrison starred in what was supposed to be a small number of low-budget martial arts &quot;ninja&quot; films directed by Chinese filmmaker Godfrey Ho, with whom he was already familiar from working for the Shaw Brothers in the 1970s. However, Ho later re-edited his scenes into many more films in a cut-and-paste style of filmmaking. As a result, Harrison found himself the unwilling star of at least twenty-four different movies, with titles like &quot;Ninja Terminator&quot;, &quot;Cobra Vs. Ninja&quot;, &quot;Golden Ninja Warrior,&quot; and &quot;Diamond Ninja Force&quot;. Like the &quot;Silver Star&quot; productions, the &quot;ninja&quot; films have become cult films. Disgusted with that outcome, Harrison returned to the United States.

In 1991, Harrison played Jack Roth in the drama film &quot;Lies of the Twins&quot; opposite Aidan Quinn, Isabella Rossellini, and Iman. Directed by Tim Hunter, much of the movie was shot at Harrison&#x27;s beach-front home in Malibu. The film was generally well-received by critics upon release.

Harrison subsequently slowed down his film work over the next few years. His last movies were the 1993 erotic thriller &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; and the 2000 film &quot;Jerks&quot;. &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; was directed by the cinematographer/director Gary Graver and starred Erik Estrada, John Phillip Law, and Monique Gabrielle.

Some of the more noteworthy movies in Harrison&#x27;s later career were the Moroccan film &quot;Amok&quot; (1982) and &quot;Dark Mission&quot; (1987), by controversial Spanish director Jesús Franco. It had a cast featuring Christopher Lee, Christopher Mitchum, and French adult film star Brigitte Lahaie (also known for appearing in the horror films of Jean Rollin).

One of the few serious roles that Harrison portrayed in the 1980s was that of American President Andrew Johnson in Ali Hatami&#x27;s Iranian production &quot;Hajji Washington&quot;. The film was completed in 1982 but was not screened in Iran until 1998.

He has since founded a now defunct, multisystem electronics company named &quot;Gladiator Electronics&quot; with his son Sebastian.

<text>St Anne&#x27;s Limehouse is a Hawksmoor Anglican Church in Limehouse, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It was consecrated in 1730, one of the twelve churches built through the 1711 Act of Parliament.

==History==

St Anne&#x27;s Limehouse was formed by the (3 Geo. 2. c. 17) from part of the parish of St Dunstan&#x27;s, Stepney, prior to the 18th century a large (but then thinly populated) East London parish that extended all the way down to the Thames River. As the population of London increased, growing parishes were subdivided. In 1709 a new parish in Limehouse was formed from part of the parish of St. Dunstan. The church may have been named after Queen Anne as she raised money for it by taxing coal passing along the River Thames.

The building was designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, as one of twelve churches built to serve the needs of the rapidly expanding population of London in the 18th century. The scheme never approached its ambitious target of 50 churches, but those built were also known as the Queen Anne Churches. The building was completed in 1727 and consecrated in 1730. The church was built by Edward Strong the Younger a friend of Christopher Wren the Younger.

Queen Anne decreed that as the new church was close to the river it would be a convenient place of registry for sea captains to register vital events taking place at sea. Therefore, she gave St. Anne&#x27;s Church the right to display the second most senior ensign of the Royal Navy, the White Ensign. The prominent tower with its golden ball on the flagpole became a Trinity House &quot;sea mark&quot; on navigational charts, and the Queen&#x27;s Regulations still permit St. Anne&#x27;s Limehouse to display the White Ensign 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

The church was gutted by fire on Good Friday 1850, and restored between 1851 and 1854 by Philip Hardwick. It was further restored by Julian Harrap between 1983 and 1993, when tubular steel trusses were added to support the roof. The church was Grade I listed in 1950. St Anne&#x27;s underwent extensive restoration during 2007–2009, including complete restoration of the organ and work on the altar and floor.

The original 1741 pipe organ, destroyed in the 1850 fire, was by Richard Bridge, modified by William Russell in 1799.
The replacement organ, by Gray and Davison, won first prize in the Great Exhibition of 1851 at Crystal Palace, and is much prized by musicians. In 2009, the church became the main rehearsal venue for the recently formed Docklands Sinfonia, and occasionally hosts classical concerts. Today, the church remains the parish church of Limehouse, and is within the Diocese of London.

After the churchyard closed to burials, it was converted to public gardens with the assistance of the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association. The garden was laid out by the Association&#x27;s landscape gardener Fanny Wilkinson. She retained the notable stone pyramid by Hawksmoor, dating from 1730 and bearing the inscription &quot;The wisdom of Solomon&quot;. Also located within the churchyard is a 1918 white stone war memorial with bronze figure of Christ. They are separately Grade II listed.

===Present day===
St Anne&#x27;s is within the Conservative Evangelical tradition of the Church of England, and it is under the extended episcopal oversight of the Bishop of Maidstone. It describes itself as, &quot;A genuinely mixed East End Church with a passion for straightforward Bible teaching.&quot;

==Location==
The church is next door to Limehouse Town Hall and close to Limehouse Library, both Grade II listed buildings, the former now used as a community centre. Across the road is the former Sailors&#x27; Mission, where Situationist International held its conference in 1960.

The address is: St Anne&#x27;s Church, Three Colt Street, London E14 7HP

The nearest Docklands Light Railway station is Westferry.

==St Peter&#x27;s Barge==

With the redevelopment of the East London Docklands in the late 20th century, over 100,000 people work in the Canary Wharf area, and a large part of this centre of business and finance lies within the parish of St Anne&#x27;s Church. As a result, St Anne&#x27;s began to run lunchtime meetings in pubs and wine bars to reach out to those working in the Wharf. This effort developed with the support of St Helen&#x27;s Bishopsgate, but further growth was hampered for lack of a permanent venue on the site, which has high property values.

The idea to build a floating church was realised with the formation of the St Peter&#x27;s Canary Wharf Trust and the purchase of a Dutch freight barge in 2003. The barge was refitted in the Netherlands and brought across the North Sea under its own power in the summer of that year – a journey which was chronicled in a BBC documentary shown in the autumn. The barge now has a permanent mooring at the heart of Canary Wharf in West India Quay.

A permanent full-time Church of England minister was appointed by the Trust in July 2004 and licensed by the area bishop to head the clergy. In September 2004 St Peter&#x27;s launched a new Sunday evening congregation with its own programme of meetings and groups to serve the many thousands who now live in the area.

<doc id="1110844" wikidata="Q532804" url="?curid=1110844" title="Maria Czaplicka">
<text>Maria Antonina Czaplicka (25 October 1884 – 27 May 1921), also referred to as Marya Antonina Czaplicka and Marie Antoinette Czaplicka, was a Polish cultural anthropologist who is best known for her ethnography of Siberian shamanism. Czaplicka&#x27;s research survives in three major works: her studies in &quot;Aboriginal Siberia&quot; (1914); a travelogue published as &quot;My Siberian Year&quot; (1916); and a set of lectures published as &quot;The Turks of Central Asia&quot; (1918). Curzon Press republished all three volumes, plus a fourth volume of articles and letters, in 1999.

==Early life and studies==
Czaplicka was born in the Stara Praga district of Warsaw on the 25th of October 1884 to Feliks Czaplicki and Zofia Zawisza. Her father Feliks Czaplicki came from impoverished Polish nobility and worked as a railway clerk and station master. She was the third oldest of her parents&#x27; five children, Jadwiga Markowska (née Czaplicka), Stanisław Czaplicki, Gabriela Szaniawska (née Czaplicka), and Marian Czaplicki. Feliks Czaplicki found employment in what is now Latvia, where the family lived from 1904 to 1906 before returning to Warsaw. It was here that Maria Czaplicka was able to take the exam that would allow her to attend university later in life.

She began her studies at the Anna Jasieńska Girls&#x27; School and attended the school until 1902. She began her studies in higher-education with the so-called Flying University (later &quot;Wyższe Kursy Naukowe&quot;), an underground institution of higher education in Russian-held Poland. She supported herself with a number of poorly paid jobs, as a teacher at Łabusiewiczówna Girls&#x27; School, a secretary, and lady&#x27;s companion. She was also known for her lectures at the University for Everyone (1905–1908), and the Society of Polish Culture. She also wrote poetry, eventually being published in Warsaw&#x27;s &quot;Odrodzenie&quot; magazine. While battling an illness, she spent time in Zakopane where she went on to do work for the Pedological Society while writing &quot;Olek Niedziela,&quot; a novel for children centered around education. In 1910 she became the first woman to receive a Mianowski Scholarship, and was therefore able to continue her studies in the United Kingdom.

She left Poland in 1910. Taken ill with appendicitis in late March 1911, she was admitted to St Batholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London. She continued her studies at the Faculty of Anthropology of the London School of Economics under Charles G. Seligman, and at Somerville College, Oxford under R.R. Marett, graduating from the School of Anthropology in 1912. Marett encouraged her to use her Russian language skills in a review of literature on native tribes in Siberia, which became her book &quot;Aboriginal Siberia&quot;, published in 1914. In 1914, she became a member of the Royal Anthropological Society, and was also involved with the British Association for the Advancement of Science, presenting research centered around the connection between religion and the environment in Siberia. At this stage she had never visited Siberia, but the quality of her writing led to &quot;Aboriginal Siberia&quot; becoming the major reference work in its field.

==Yenisei Expedition==

Marett had intended the work reported in Czaplicka&#x27;s &quot;Aboriginal Siberia&quot; to be the basis for fieldwork in Siberia. In May 1914, she began such fieldwork, partly funded by the Mary Ewart Travelling Scholarship granted by Somerville College, leading a joint expedition of Oxford University and University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology staff. Together with English ornithologist Maud Doria Haviland, English painter Dora Curtis, and Henry Usher Hall of the Museum, she arrived in Russia shortly before World War I broke out. After the war started Czaplicka and Hall decided to continue their expedition while the others decided to go back to the United Kingdom. Czaplicka and Hall (accompanied by Michikha, a Tungus woman) spent the entire winter traveling along the shores of the Yenisei River via the &quot;Oryol&quot;: more than altogether.

Czaplicka prepared several hundreds of photographs of people of Siberia, as well as countless notes on anthropometry and their customs. Czaplicka also received funds from the Committee for Anthropology of the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford to collect specimens from Siberia; 193 objects were donated by Czaplicka to the museum&#x27;s Asian collection. In addition, she collected botanical specimens for the Fielding-Druce Herbarium. It is speculated that recordings of the many languages that they encountered during their expedition were produced on wax cylinders, but this has not been proven and the recordings are not well-known and likely never made it through academic processing if they were brought back to the university. The overall results of the expedition were modest, something that historians have credited to the nature of the study and the many financial and political struggles faced by the team during the journey.

She was also well known for her criticisms of the term &quot;Arctic Hysteria&quot; to refer to the Western perspective of the presentation of nervous diseases. She encourages cultural relativism, meaning that aspects of one culture should not be viewed and judged through the lens of a different culture when it comes to this situation. She describes that what Western academics called hysteria was viewed through a much different lens in Siberian cultures. This was all a part of her works studying Shamanism in Siberia.

==Return to England and death==
Czaplicka returned to England in 1915. She wrote a diary of her travel entitled &quot;My Siberian Year&quot;, which was published in 1916 by Mills &amp; Boon (in their non-fiction &quot;My Year&quot; series); the book became very popular. In 1916, she also became the first female lecturer in anthropology at Oxford University, supported by the Mary Ewart Trust. She gave lectures on the nations of Central and Eastern Europe as well as on the habits of the Siberian tribes. She also spoke on Polish issues, including Danzig&#x27;s post-war disposition.

In 1920, her work was honoured with a Murchison Grant from the Royal Geographical Society, &quot;for her ethnographical and geographical work in Northern Siberia.&quot; In spite of this triumph, her financial future was still insecure. Her three-year fellowship at Oxford having expired in 1919, she obtained a temporary teaching position in anthropology in the Department of Anatomy at the University of Bristol.

In 1921, she failed to obtain the Albert Kahn Travelling Fellowship which she had hoped for, and in May of that year she poisoned herself. The University of Bristol Senate expressed its regret and &quot;appreciation of the loss to the University of so distinguished a member of its staff&quot;. Czaplicka is buried in the Wolvercote Cemetery in Oxford.

==Legacy==
In a will written months before she died, Czaplicka left her notes and reports to her colleague Henry Usher Hall. Although she never married, questions have been raised about the relationship between Hall and Czaplicka. Hall married the artist Frances Devereux Jones about a month after Czaplicka&#x27;s death.

After Hall died in 1944, some of Czaplicka&#x27;s early papers were donated to the University of Pennsylvania Museum, but at least one report and a partial manuscript may be lost. Her primary papers are archived at Somerville College, Oxford. Polish museums hold a few private letters of Czaplicka to Bronisław Malinowski and Władysław Orkan, one of the most prominent Polish poets of the time.

Upon her death in 1971, Barbara Aitkin (née Barbara Freire-Marreco), a student of Marett and friend of Czaplicka&#x27;s, memorialised Czaplicka with a fund at Somerville College. In 2015, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford held a small exhibition entitled &quot;My Siberian Year, 1914–1915&quot; to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Czaplicka&#x27;s expedition to Siberia.

<doc id="1110853" wikidata="Q796807" url="?curid=1110853" title="*Dyēus">
<text>&#x27; (), also &#x27; (), is the reconstructed name of the daylight-sky god in Proto-Indo-European mythology. was conceived as a divine personification of the bright sky of the day and the seat of the gods, the . Associated with the vast diurnal sky and with the fertile rains, was often paired with &quot;*Dʰéǵʰōm&quot;, the Earth Mother, in a relationship of union and contrast.

While its existence is not directly attested by archaeological or written materials, is considered by scholars the most securely reconstructed deity of the Indo-European pantheon, as identical formulas referring to him can be found among the subsequent Indo-European languages and myths of the Vedic Indo-Aryans, Latins, Greeks, Phrygians, Messapians, Thracians, Illyrians, Albanians and Hittites.

==Name==
=== Etymology ===
The divine name &quot;*Dyēus&quot; derives from the stem &quot;*dyeu-,&quot; denoting the &quot;diurnal sky&quot; or the &quot;brightness of the day&quot; (in contrast to the darkness of the night), ultimately from the root *&quot;di&quot; or &quot;dei&quot;- (&quot;to shine, be bright&quot;). Cognates in Indo-European languages revolving around the concepts of &quot;day&quot;, &quot;sky&quot; and &quot;deity&quot; and sharing the root &quot;*dyeu&quot;- as an etymon, such as Sanskrit &quot;dyumán-&quot; &#x27;heavenly, shining, radiant&#x27;, suggest that &quot;Dyēus&quot; referred to the vast and bright sky of the day conceived as a divine entity among Proto-Indo-European speakers.

A vṛddhi-derivative appears in *&quot;deywós&quot; (&quot;celestial&quot;), the common word for &quot;god&quot; in Proto-Indo-European. In classic Indo-European, associated with the late Khvalynsk culture (3900–3500), &quot;*Dyēus&quot; also had the meaning of &quot;Heaven&quot;, whereas it denoted &quot;god&quot; in general (or the Sun-god in particular) in the Anatolian tradition. The suffix-derivative &quot;*diwyós&quot; (&quot;divine&quot;) is also attested in Latin, Greek and Sanskrit. The noun (&quot;day&quot;), interpreted as a back-formation of *&quot;deywós&quot;, has descendant cognates in Albanian (&quot;break of the day&quot;), Vedic Sanskrit &quot;dína-&quot; &quot;day&quot; and &quot;divé-dive&quot; (&quot;day by day&quot;), Lithuanian &quot;dienà&quot; and Latvian &quot;dìena&quot; (&quot;day&quot;), Slavic &quot;dъnъ&quot; (&quot;day&quot;) or Slavic &quot;Poludnitsa&quot; (&quot;Lady Midday&quot;), Latin &quot;Dies&quot;, goddess of the day and counterpart to Greek Hemera, Hittite &quot;siwat&quot; (&quot;day&quot;), Palaic &quot;Tīyat-&quot; (&quot;Sun, day&quot;), Ancient Greek &quot;endios&quot; (&quot;midday&quot;), Old Armenian &quot;tiw&quot; (տիւ, &quot;bright day&quot;), Old Irish (&quot;nine-day period&quot;), Welsh (&quot;today&quot;).

While the Greek goddess Pandeia or Pandia (, &quot;all brightness&quot;) may have been another name for the Moon Goddess Selene, her name still preserves the root &quot;*di&quot;-/&quot;*dei&quot;-, meaning &quot;to shine, be bright&quot;.

=== Epithets ===
The most constant epithet associated with *&quot;Dyēus&quot; is &quot;father&quot; (&quot;*ph₂tḗr&quot;). The term &quot;Father Dyēus&quot; was inherited in the Vedic &quot;Dyáuṣ Pitṛ́&quot;, Greek &quot;Zeus Patēr&quot;, Illyrian &quot;Dei-pátrous&quot;, Roman &quot;Jupiter&quot; (*), even in the form of &quot;dad&quot; or &quot;papa&quot; in the Scythian &quot;Papaios&quot; for Zeus&quot;,&quot; or the Palaic expression &quot;Tiyaz&quot; &quot;papaz&quot;. The epithet &quot;*Ph₂tḗr Ǵenh1-tōr&quot; (&quot;Father Procreator&quot;) is also attested in the Vedic, Iranian, Greek, and perhaps the Roman ritual traditions.

== Role ==
&quot;*Dyēus&quot; was the Sky or Day conceived as a divine entity, and thus the dwelling of the gods, the Heaven. As the gateway to the deities and the father of both the Divine Twins and the goddess of the Dawn (&quot;*H₂éwsōs&quot;), &quot;*Dyēus&quot; was a prominent deity in the Proto-Indo-European pantheon. He was however likely not their ruler or the holder of the supreme power like Zeus and Jupiter.

&quot;*Dyēus&quot; was associated with the bright and vast sky, but also to the cloudy weather in the Vedic and Greek formulas &quot;*Dyēus&#x27; rain.&quot; Although several reflexes of Dyēus are storm deities, such as Zeus and Jupiter, this is thought to be a late development exclusive to Mediterranean traditions, probably derived from syncretism with Canaanite deities and the Proto-Indo-European god &quot;*Perkʷūnos&quot;.

Due to his celestial nature, &quot;*Dyēus&quot; is often described as &quot;all-seeing&quot; or &quot;with wide vision&quot; in Indo-European myths. It is unlikely however that he was in charge of the supervision of justice and righteousness, as it was the case for Zeus or the Indo-Iranian Mithra–Varuna duo, but he was suited to serve at least as a witness to oaths and treaties. Proto-Indo-Europeans also visualized the sun as the &quot;lamp of Dyēus&quot; or the &quot;eye of Dyēus&quot;, as seen in various reflexes: &quot;the god&#x27;s lamp&quot; in Euripides&#x27; &quot;Medea&quot;, &quot;heaven&#x27;s candle&quot; in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, &quot;the land of Hatti&#x27;s torch&quot; (the Sun-goddess of Arinna) in a Hittite prayer, Helios as the eye of Zeus, Hvare-khshaeta as the eye of Ahura Mazda, and the sun as &quot;God&#x27;s eye&quot; in Romanian folklore.

===Consort===
&quot;*Dyēus&quot; is often paired with &quot;*Dʰéǵʰōm&quot;, the Earth goddess, and described as uniting with her to ensure the growth and sustenance of terrestrial life; the earth becomes pregnant as the rain falls from the sky. The relationship between Father Sky (*&quot;Dyēus Ph₂tḗr&quot;) and Mother Earth (&quot;*Dʰéǵʰōm Méh₂tēr&quot;) is also of contrast: the latter is portrayed as the vast and dark dwelling of mortals, located below the bright seat of the gods. According to Jackson however, as the thunder-god is frequently associated with the fructifying rains, she may be a more fitting partner of &quot;*Perkʷūnos&quot; than of &quot;*Dyēus&quot;.

While Hausos and the Divine Twins are generally considered the offsprings of &quot;*Dyēus&quot; alone, some scholars have proposed a spouse-goddess reconstructed as &quot;*Diwōnā&quot; or &quot;*Diuōneh₂&quot;, with a possible descendant in Zeus&#x27;s consort Dione. A thematic echo occurs in the Vedic tradition as Indra&#x27;s wife Indrānī displays a similar jealous and quarrelsome disposition under provocation. A second descendant may be found in Dia, a mortal said to unite with Zeus in a Greek myth. After the mating of Dia&#x27;s husband Ixion with the phantom of Hera, the spouse of Zeus, the story leads ultimately to the birth of the Centaurs (who may be seen as reminiscent of the Divine Twins, sons of &quot;*Dyēus&quot;). Another reflex may be found in the Mycenaean Greek &quot;Diwia&quot;, possibly a feminine counterpart of Zeus attested in the second part of the 2nd millennium BC and which may have survived in the Pamphylian dialect of Asia Minor. The reconstruction is however only based upon the Greek—and to a lesser extent the Vedic—tradition, and it remains therefore not secured.

If the female goddesses Hera, Juno, Frigg and Shakti share a common association with marriage and fertility, Mallory and Adams note however that &quot;these functions are much too generic to support the supposition of a distinct PIE &#x27;consort goddess&#x27; and many of the &#x27;consorts&#x27; probably represent assimilations of earlier goddesses who may have had nothing to do with marriage.&quot;

==Evidence==

Cognates deriving either from the stem &quot;*dyeu-&quot; (&quot;daylight, bright sky&quot;), the epithet &quot;*Dyēus Ph2ter&quot; (&quot;Father Sky&quot;), the vṛddhi-derivative &quot;*deiwós&quot; (&quot;celestial&quot;, a &quot;god&quot;), the derivative &quot;*diwyós&quot; (&quot;divine&quot;), or the back-formation (a &quot;day&quot;) are among the most widely attested in Indo-European languages.

===&quot;Sky-Father&quot; epithet===

Ritual and formulaic expressions stemming from the form *&quot;Dyēus Ph2ter&quot; (&quot;Father Dyēus&quot;) were inherited in the following liturgic and poetic traditions:

*PIE: &quot;*dyēus ph2tḗr,&quot; &#x27;Father Sky&#x27; ( &quot;*dyeu ph2ter&quot;, &quot;O Father Sky&quot;),
**Greek: &quot;Zeus Patēr&quot; (Ζεῦς πατήρ; Ζεῦ πάτερ),

**Illyrian: &quot;Deipaturos,&quot; recorded by Hesychius as Δειπάτυροϛ (Deipáturos), a god worshiped in Tymphaea.

Other reflexes are variants that have retained both linguistic descendants of the stem &quot;*dyeu-&quot; (&quot;sky&quot;) alongside the original structure &quot;Father God&quot;. Some traditions have replaced the epithet &quot;*ph2ter&quot; with the nursery word &quot;papa&quot; (&quot;dad, daddy&quot;):

*Luwian: &quot;Tātis tiwaz&quot;, &quot;Daddy Tiwaz&quot;, the Sun-god,
*Palaic: &quot;Tiyaz&quot; &quot;papaz&quot;, &quot;Papa Tiyaz&quot;, the Sun-god,
*Scythian: &quot;Papaios&quot; (&quot;Papa Zios&quot;), &quot;father Zeus&quot;, the god of the Sky,
*Old Irish: &quot;in&quot; &quot;Dagdae Oll-athair&quot;, &quot;Great Father the Dagda&quot; (from the Proto-Celtic formula &quot;*sindos dago-dēwos ollo fātir&quot;, &quot;Great Father the Good God&quot;).

Other variants are less secured:
*Hittite: &quot;attas Isanus,&quot; &quot;Father Sun-god&quot;; the name of the sky-god was replaced with a Hattic sun-god loan, but the original structure of the formula left intact,
*Latvian: &quot;Debess tēvs&quot;, &quot;Father of Heaven&quot;,
*Old Norse: &quot;Óðinn&quot; &quot;Alföðr&quot;, &quot;Odin, All-Father&quot; or &quot;Odin Father of All&quot;,
*Russian: &quot;Stribogŭ&quot;, &quot;Father God&quot;,
*Albanian: &quot;Zot&quot;, &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;God&quot;, epithet of Zojz, the sky-father (generally thought to be derived from Proto-Albanian , &quot;heavenly father&quot;; although the etymology , &quot;lord of the house&quot;, has also been proposed),
*Tokharian B: &quot;kauṃ-ñäkte&quot;, &#x27;sun, sun-god&#x27;.

=== &quot;Celestial&quot; derivations ===

Cognates stemming from *&quot;deywós&quot;, a vṛddhi-derivation of *&quot;dyēus&quot; (the sky-god), are attested in the following traditions:

Kroonen, although M. L. West views it as unlikely,
****Old Norse: &quot;Týr&quot;, associated with justice; the plural &quot;tívar&quot; survived as a poetic word for &#x27;the gods&#x27;, and &quot;týr&quot; appears in kennings for Odin and Thor, such as in the Odin&#x27;s names &quot;Sigtýr&quot; (&quot;victory-god&quot;), &quot;Gautatýr&quot; (&quot;god of the Geats&quot;), &quot;Fimbultýr&quot; (&quot;powerful god&quot;), or &quot;Hertýr&quot; (&quot;army-god&quot;),

**Messapic: &quot;deiva&quot;, &quot;dīva&quot;, &quot;goddess&quot;,
**Phrygian: &quot;devos&quot;.

Other cognates are less secured:

*Slavic: &quot;*diva&quot; (&gt; &quot;*dîvo&quot;), perhaps a word for a &quot;good deity&quot; which progressively took the meaning of &quot;miracle&quot;, hence &quot;evil being&quot;,

**Polish: Dziewanna, Sorbian: Dživica, Slavic equivalent of Diana, however, other etymologies have been proposed.
*Lusitanian: &quot;Reo&quot;, an unknown deity.
**Lusitanian: &quot;Deiba&quot; and &quot;Deibo&quot;, attested in votive inscriptions of altars; taken to mean the &quot;local&quot; or &quot;indigenous&quot; pronunciations of &quot;Deae&quot; and &quot;Deo&quot;.

=== &quot;Divine&quot; derivations ===
Other cognates deriving from the adjective &quot;*diwyós&quot; (&quot;*dyeu&quot; &quot;sky&quot; + &quot;yós&quot;, a thematic suffix) are attested in the following traditions:

* PIE: &quot;*diwyós&quot;, meaning &quot;divine, heavenly, godlike&quot;,
**Mycenaean Greek: &quot;di-wi-jo&quot; (), &quot;di-wi-ja&quot; (),
***Greek: &quot;dîos&quot; (δῖος), &quot;belonging to heaven, godlike&quot;, also &quot;belonging to Zeus&quot; in tragedies; feminine &quot;Día&quot; (Δῖα &lt; &quot;*Díw-ya&quot;), a goddess venerated in classical times at Phlius and Sicyon, and possibly identified with Hebe, the cup-bearer of the gods,

**Proto-Italic: *&quot;dīwī&quot; ( &quot;dīwīs&quot;),
***Latin: &quot;dīvus&quot;, &quot;dīvī&quot;, &quot;divine, heavenly, godlike&quot;,
****Latin: &quot;Dīs Pater&quot;, from &quot;dīves&quot; ( &quot;dītis&quot;), meaning &quot;wealthy, rich&quot;, probably derived from *&quot;dīwīs&quot; &gt; &quot;dīvus&quot; via the intermediate form or (&quot;who is like the gods, protected by the gods&quot;), with contraction *&quot;īwi&quot;- &gt; &quot;ī&quot;. According to de Vaan, &quot;the occurrence of the deity &quot;Dīs&quot; together with &quot;pater&quot; may be due to association with &quot;Di(e)spiter&quot;.&quot;
***Latin: &quot;dīus&quot;, &quot;dīā&quot;, another adjective with the same meaning, probably based on *&quot;dīwī&quot; &gt; &quot;diī&quot; ( &quot;dīs&quot;),
****Latin: &quot;Diāna&quot; (from an older &quot;Dīāna&quot;), goddess of the moon and the countryside.

Other cognates are less secured:
*Paleo-Balkan:
**Albanian: &quot;zana&quot; &quot;nymph, goddess&quot;.
**Romanian: &quot;zână&quot; &quot;fairy, goddess&quot;.

== Legacy ==
As the pantheons of the individual mythologies related to Proto-Indo-European religion evolved, attributes of &quot;*Dyēus&quot; seem to have been redistributed to other deities. In Greek and Roman mythology, &quot;*Dyēus&quot; was the chief god, while the etymological continuant of Dyēus became a very abstract god in Vedic mythology, and his original prominence over other gods largely diluted.

=== In Albanian tradition ===

After the first access of the ancestors of the Albanians to the Christian religion in antiquity, the presumable Albanian term for Sky-Father – &quot;Zot&quot; – has been used for God, the Father and the Son (Christ). In Albanian folk beliefs the peak of the highest mountains like Tomorr in central Albania has been associated with the sky-god &quot;Zojz&quot;. The enduring sanctity of the mountain, the annual pilgrimage to its summit, and the solemn sacrifice of a white bull by the local people provide abundant evidence that the ancient cult of the sky-god on Mount Tomorr continues through the generations almost untouched by the course of political events and religious changes.

=== In Slavic tradition ===
At one point, early Slavs, like some Iranian peoples after the Zoroastrian religious reformation, demonized the Slavic successor of &quot;*Dyēus&quot; (abandoning this word in the sense of &quot;heaven&quot; at the same time, keeping the word for &quot;day&quot;, however, and abandoning many of the names of the other Proto-Indo-European gods, replacing them with new Slavic or Iranian names), while not replacing it with any other specific god, as a result of cultural contacts with Iranian peoples in the first millennium BC. Hence, after the process of demonization by the Slavs, &quot;*Dyēus&quot; is considered to have originated two continuations: &quot;*divo&quot; (&quot;strange, odd thing&quot;) and &quot;*divъ&quot; (&quot;demon&quot;). The result of this demonization may be Pan-Slavic demons, e.g. Polish and Czech dziwożona, or Div occurring in &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;.

According to some researchers, at least some of &quot;*Dyēus&quot;&#x27;s traits could have been taken over by Svarog (Urbańczyk: Sun-Dažbóg – heavenly fire, Svarožič – earthly fire, Svarog – heaven, lightning). Helmold recalls that the Slavs were also supposed to believe in a god in heaven, who only deals with heavenly matters and commands other gods.

== In non-Indo-European traditions ==
Various loanwords of *&quot;deiwós&quot; were introduced in non-Indo-European languages, such as Estonian &quot;taevas or&quot; Finnish &quot;taivas&quot; (&quot;sky&quot;), borrowed from Proto-Indo-Iranian into these Uralic languages.

<doc id="1110855" wikidata="Q13436425" url="?curid=1110855" title="Coregency">
<text>A coregency is the situation where a monarchical position (such as prince, princess, king, queen, emperor or empress), normally held by only a single person, is held by two or more. It is to be distinguished from diarchies or duumvirates (such as ancient Sparta and Rome), and also from regencies where a single monarch (usually infant or incapacitated) has a seniority above a regent but exercises no power except legally holding the position of head of state.

== Andorra ==
Co-principality is a distinct but related system employed in contemporary Andorra, where monarchical power is formally divided between two rulers.

== Historical examples ==
Coregencies were common in the Hellenistic period; according to one scholar, they &quot;can usually be explained as a means of avoiding crises of succession or internal conflict, and of strengthening dynastic identity and ideology.&quot; Other examples include the coregency of Frederick I of Austria and Louis the Bavarian over the Kingdom of Germany. &quot;Jure uxoris&quot; Kings in Kingdoms such as Portugal and Spain can also be found (Ferdinand V and Isabella I of Castile, Philip I and Joanna of Castile, Peter III and Maria I of Portugal, etc.). In Navarre, the husbands of queens regnant were styled as co-rulers.

===Ancient Egypt===
In Ancient Egypt, coregency was quite problematic as the Pharaoh was seen as the incarnation/representation of the god Horus. Therefore, according to the divine order Ma&#x27;at, only one King could exist at the same time. Yet, exceptions can be found, mainly in the Middle Kingdom, where the pharaoh occasionally appointed his successor (often one of his sons) as coregent, or joint king, to ensure a smooth succession. “This system was used, from at least as early as the Middle Kingdom, in order to ensure that the transfer of power took place with the minimum of disruption and instability”. Coregencies are highly probable for Amenemhat I &gt; Senusret I &gt; Amenemhat II &gt; Senusret II. Most probably the real king in power was the older one (father) adopting the younger ruler (son), while the co-regent had to wait until after the death of the older one to really have access to full royal power. Yet, the years of reigns normally were counted from the beginning of the coregency on. Due to this and to the fragmentary character of known sources, the establishment of Egyptian chronology was quite complicated and remains disputed up to date. Yet, understanding the existence of co-regency reduced the chaos quite a lot.

The institution of coregency is different from that of vice-regency, where an adult person (in Ancient Egypt often the mother of the king) functions as Legal guardian, ruling in the name of the underage king. Some of the female vice-regents of Egypt rose to a status of equal to the God-Kings, becoming co-rulers as can be seen in the famous case of Hatshepsut. After the death of her husband Thutmose II, Hatshepsut ruled in the name of Thutmose III, her nephew and stepson. Then, latest in year 7 of Thutmose III&#x27;s reign, she took over royal regalia and was then titled King of Egypt under the Throne name (&quot;prenomen&quot;) Maatkare. For later periods of Pharaonic Egyptian history, the existence of the institution of coregency has been put into question by Egyptologists, while, &quot;the Ptolemaic and Roman period examples being the most securely identified&quot;.

===Ancient Israel===
In the book &quot;The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings&quot;, Edwin R. Thiele proposed co-regency as a possible explanation for discrepancies in the dates given in the Hebrew Bible for the reigns of the kings of Israel and Judah. At least one co-regency is explicitly documented in the Bible: the coronation of King Solomon occurred before the death of his father David.

===Britain===

King Henry II of England installed his eldest surviving son, also named Henry, as junior king. Henry the Young King was not permitted to exercise royal authority and his title as co-king was effectively a sinecure to denote his status as his father&#x27;s chosen heir. Young Henry predeceased his father without ever ascending to the throne and is not included in the official list of English monarchs.

The Monarchy of England experienced joint rule under the terms of the act sanctioning the marriage of Mary I to Philip II of Spain. Philip notionally reigned as king of England (inclusive of Wales) and Ireland by right of his wife from 1554 to 1558. Similarly, following the Glorious Revolution, Mary II and her husband William III held joint sovereignty over the kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 1688 to 1694.

===China===
Co-regency was common amongst the Chinese ethnics both formally or informally dating far back to the Han dynasty to the Late Qing dynasty, if it happened to be so that a new Emperor ascended the throne and was mature but not well adept with politics, it was a national concern for stability in which the monarch was the head of state de jure whereas a co-regent was its de facto ruler.

The requirements for the position of co-regent depended on the power of an individual along with their ability to command the Confidence of the Parliament and it could be an official in the Imperial Court, a close and trustworthy paternal or maternal relative or the most appropriate being the Most Senior Member of the Imperial family in the Palace which was either the Grand Empress Dowager or the Empress Dowager. The absence of all these specific personalities could rarely pave way for the monarch&#x27;s wife if she seemed more competent.

The most outstanding co-regencies were those of Empress Wu Zetian during the Tang dynasty in the reign of her husband that Gaozong Emperor even if it was informal, the Empress Dowager Xiang became co-regent for the Emperor Huizong of Song, her adopted son in 1100 while the Grand Empress Dowager Wu became co-regent of the Emperor Guangzong of Southern Song in the year 1189 even if his Empress Li Fengniang later posthumously honored as Ciyi became the de facto ruler, Empress Dowager Yang served as co-regent of the Emperor Lizong from 1224 until her death in 1233 even if she soon surpassed his own influence and ruled ultimately like an Empress Regnant even if she was never actually one. During the Qing dynasty the Empress Dowagers Ci&#x27;an of the Manchu Niohuru clan along with Ci&#x27;xi of the Manchu Yehenara clan served as Co-regents from 1861 until Ci&#x27;an&#x27;s death in 1881 where Ci&#x27;xi became sole regent for the Guanxu Emperor until she was overthrown in 1908, it was more interesting during her time that Ci&#x27;an particularly specialized in handling the affairs of the Imperial family and left Ci&#x27;xi to dominate the political scene much as contemporary history suggests that Ci&#x27;an was more willing to keep Ci&#x27;xi as her ally than to make her an enemy given the fact that Ci&#x27;xi welded more political power than she ever did she in turn eliminated any form of competition for supremacy with the latter even if she was Senior to her.

===France===
Following the extinction of the Carolingian dynasty in West Francia, the Western Frankish nobles elected Hugh Capet as their new king. Upon his ascension Hugh secured the election of his only son Robert as his co-king. As such, when Hugh died it did not trigger an election for a new king, nor did Robert necessarily &quot;inherit&quot; the crown, but simply continued his kingship. Subsequent Capetian kings would also name their eldest son or brother as co-ruler, until the tradition of agnatic primogeniture was sufficiently established to transform the King of France from an elected monarch to a hereditary one.

===Lithuania===
The Lithuanian Grand Dukes typically selected submonarchs from their families or loyal subjects to assist controlling the Grand Duchy. However, the Grand Dukes remained superior.

* Vytenis (superior) and Gediminas
* Gediminas (superior) and an unknown duke of Trakai, presumably Gediminas&#x27;s son.
* Algirdas (superior) and Kęstutis
* Jogaila (superior) and Kęstutis

A slightly different system developed for a brief period after Vytautas became Grand Duke, where nominally Vytautas ruled together with Jogaila, who took the title of &quot;&quot; (Supreme Duke), but he has not once used the title to take any action, and in general the powers invested in the title were not clearly stated in any documents, besides the Pact of Horodlo, which guaranteed that Jogaila would have to approve the selection of a Lithuanian Grand Duke. The title was not used by any other king of Poland after Jogaila.

* Vytautas (Grand Duke) and Jogaila (Supreme Duke)
* Švitrigaila (Grand Duke) and Jogaila (Supreme Duke) for a brief period, until Švitrigaila declared war on Poland
* Sigismund I of Lithuania (Grand Duke) and Jogaila (Supreme Duke) until Jogaila&#x27;s death.

===Roman Empire===
It was common during the Principate for a Roman emperor or &quot;Augustus&quot; to appoint &quot;Caesar&quot; as designated heir and junior co-emperor, in many cases adopting them as their son, who did not necessarily have to be biologically related to them. This was merely a tradition and not a formal office until the Tetrarchy, which attempted to codify this arrangement, but quickly fell apart. It regained significance, including under Zeno, as well as when Justin I had his nephew Justinian named co-emperor shortly before his own death, Constantine IV was also named co-emperor by his father Constans II and who himself had several other co-emperors, and the practice was common in the centuries to come up through the Palaiologans.

===Russia===
Following the death of Tsar Feodor III of Russia in 1682, his brother Ivan and half-brother Peter were both crowned autocrats of Russia. This compromise was necessary because Ivan was unfit to rule due to physical and mental disabilities, while Peter&#x27;s exclusive rule was opposed by Feodor and Ivan&#x27;s older sister Sofia Alekseyevna, who led a Streltsy uprising against him and his mother&#x27;s family. Because neither Tsar was of age to rule, Sofia subsequently claimed regency until she was removed from power by Peter in 1689. Ivan V and Peter I&#x27;s joint reign continued, however, with Ivan maintaining formal seniority despite having little participation in the affairs of the state until his death in 1696, at which point Peter became the sole ruler.

===Sweden===

The monarchy in Sweden has had several periods of joint rule: Erik and Alrik, Yngvi and Alf, Björn at Hauge and Anund Uppsale, Eric the Victorious and Olof Björnsson, Eric the Victorious and Olof Skötkonung, Halsten Stenkilsson and Inge I, and Philip and Inge II.

===Vietnam===
Coregency is a special feature of the Trần dynasty, in which a senior king abdicated in favor of his chosen heir. This abdication, however, is only in name, as the abdicated king continued to rule while his successor sat on the throne as a learner.

<doc id="1110864" wikidata="Q7597988" url="?curid=1110864" title="Stan Zemanek">
<text>Stan Zemanek (29 May 1947 – 12 July 2007) was an Australian shock jock, radio broadcaster, television presenter, radio producer and author who presented a night-time show on The Macquarie Network station 2UE in Sydney and which was networked across parts of Australia via Southern Cross.

He was known for trading abusive remarks with some of his callers. He was also the 13th and longest-serving &quot;Beast&quot; on the popular panel TV talk show &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

== Career ==
Zemanek was born and raised in Sydney, New South Wales, but began working in radio as a researcher for Radio C-Fun 141 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He worked as a producer on the John Laws program in Australia starting in 1978, before returning to North America for some years, where he covered the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup. He spent a decade presenting on 2UE late at night beginning in 1987. He spent a year in 2000 presenting the 2GB morning shift.
Zemanek moved to Melbourne for a short stint with 3AW&#x27;s drive program in 2002 before moving back to Sydney and 2UE in 2003, having failed to garner ratings, and publicly falling out with several members of the 3AW&#x27;s broadcast team.

While popular with much of his audience, Stan often boasted about being the most complained-about broadcaster in the country, polarising opinions of those who did not agree with his right-wing beliefs. He was not shy to admit that he was politically biased and often criticised &quot;idiot Labor voters&quot; for not doing the same. His most commonly used terms were &quot;numb nuts&quot;, &quot;turn it up&quot;, &quot;half-wit&quot;, &quot;oxygen thief&quot;, &quot;left-wing looney&quot;, &quot;give yourself an uppercut&quot; and &quot;typical Labor voter&quot;; and he once asked a caller who sounded to be a little slow &#x27;are you smoking the wacky-tobacky&#x27;, a slang reference to marijuana.

In 2003, following his return to 2UE, he received a bombardment of calls from a number of people he referred to as &#x27;The Phone Box Boys&#x27;, thinking they were all calling him from a phone box. The calls would sometimes reach 20 a night, and would spin several staples of Zemanek such as sound effects, on Stan himself. This led to an enormous spike in his ratings for the period of March–July 2003.

Zemanek had an ongoing rivalry with fellow 2UE colleague and breakfast host Mike Carlton, ever since Carlton revealed on-air that Zemanek was about to move to 2GB. An angry Zemanek called for Carlton to be sacked and for the Australian Broadcasting Authority to investigate him for &quot;irresponsible journalism&quot;. The &quot;debate&quot; between the two broadcasters degenerated over the next few days, with Carlton calling Zemanek &quot;a little shit&quot;, &quot;a village idiot&quot;, and &quot;a stunted runt&quot; and Zemanek calling Carlton &quot;a turd&quot; and &quot;a ponce&quot; with &quot;his head up his backside&quot;. After Zemanek&#x27;s death, Carlton stated on his breakfast show at 2UE that he hated Zemanek and would only attend his funeral to check that he was really dead, causing 2UE management to publicly denounce Carlton. Carlton made his comment while showbiz reporter Peter Ford was doing a report on Zemanek&#x27;s funeral. At the time Ford made light of Carlton&#x27;s comments. On reflection, however, he was disgusted and blasted Carlton on 2UE that day. Ford explained that Zemanek was a mentor and friend and that he was disgusted with what Carlton had said. Ford resigned from his spot on Carlton&#x27;s program (but continues to report for other 2UE programs).

== Personal life ==
Stan and his wife, Marcella Zemanek, had had two daughters, Gaby and Melissa, and two grandchildren at the time of his death. He supported the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles in the NRL, before moving to Melbourne (where Australian rules football is the dominant football code), where he elected to support the Carlton Football Club.

== Ill health, retirement and death ==
Zemanek was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive brain tumour that is almost universally fatal within a few years, in May 2006. Treatment included chemotherapy and radiotherapy in addition to surgery performed by Charles Teo. After rumours in 2006, Zemanek&#x27;s retirement, and intention to look after his health and spend time with his family, was announced on 9 December 2006. His final show went to air on 22 December 2006. Many in the commercial radio industry paid tribute to Zemanek on-air, including his former on-air colleagues and, later, rivals (on 2GB), Alan Jones and Ray Hadley.

While Zemanek intended to return to &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; in early 2007, and he celebrated his 60th birthday with former &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; co-stars, his health deteriorated in retirement. In June 2007, he and his wife cut short a planned holiday due to illness, and in early July 2007 his family announced that he was dying. He died in his sleep in the early hours on 12 July 2007. His funeral, open to the public, was held on 17 July 2007, at St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church in North Sydney, and was followed by a private cremation.

<text>PJ Powers (born Penelope Jane Dunlop, 16 July 1960, Durban) is a South African singer and performer. She became a household name in southern Africa after the widespread success of the song “Jabulani”. When she played at the Jabulani Amphitheatre in 1983 she was hailed by the crowd with the name “Thandeka”. On the stage she drank from a calabash as part of the performance to the delight of the audience. &quot;World in Union 95&quot;, the Ladysmith Black Mambazo version featuring PJ Powers, became an international hit record in 1995. It reached no. 47 in the UK singles charts.

PJ Powers garnered attention for her human rights advocacy, philanthropy, and activism against apartheid.

==Early life and career==
PJ Powers was born in Durban, Province of Natal (now in KwaZulu-Natal), South Africa on 16 July 1960. Her singing career kicked off in 1979 when she became the lead singer of an all female group called Pantha. It disbanded after a year. PJ Powers went on to front a new band, Hotline. Their sound, afro-pop fusion music framing PJ Powers&#x27; distinctive voice, attracted an expanded, cross cultural fan base.

The band lasted for seven years and produced some of the biggest South African hits of the 1980s. The formula of young, energetic musicians performing vibrant music in all areas was well accepted by their youthful target audience. PJ was then given the name Thandeka, meaning &quot;Loved One&quot;, by the people of South Africa, a name she continued to hold true to her heart. Hotline took music to the people. This increased their popularity and grew their fan base in the neighbouring countries of Botswana, Mozambique, and Namibia.

Combining music that people could dance to with messages of hope and reconciliation was different to what was played on the radio at the time. “You&#x27;re So Good to Me” (1982), written by PJ Powers, was her first big hit. Powers followed up by writing more hits, including &quot;I Feel So Strong&quot; (1983 duet with Steve Kekana), &quot;Home to Africa&quot; (1985), and &quot;There is an Answer&quot; (1986).

Hotline disbanded in 1987 and subsequently Powers pursued a solo career.

==Solo career==
1988: PJ Powers was banned from radio and TV for a year by the apartheid government for her performance at a charity concert for war orphans in Zimbabwe, along with Miriam Makeba and Harry Belafonte. She was encouraged to continue her singing by Nelson Mandela, who sent her an encouraging letter from Victor Verster Prison in Cape Town.

1990: Powers&#x27;s music developed the Afropop genre further, cementing her receptive audience in the black market.

1995: The Ladysmith Black Mambazo recording &quot;World in Union&quot; (feat P J Powers) reached no. 47 on the UK Singles Chart. She performed the song live at the opening of the Rugby World Cup in Cape Town for a worldwide television audience.

PJ Powers has shared the stage with Eric Clapton, Joan Armatrading, Hugh Masekela, Divine Divas, Lord Richard Attenborough, Richard E. Grant, Sibongile Khumalo, Janet Suzman and others. She sang for Queen Elizabeth of the United Kingdom, King Juan Carlos of Spain, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and at the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela. She collaborated with Vicky Sampson, Yvonne Chaka Chaka and M&#x27;du Masilela for the music video flighted at the United Nations Assembly in Washington, D.C., and in Greece.

2009: Powers&#x27; recording of &quot;World in Union&quot; was featured in the Academy Award–nominated film, &quot;Invictus&quot;.

2019: Songwriter Don Clarke and PJ Powers performed &quot;Sanbonani&quot;, which he wrote, together on the Legends Stage at Splashy Fen, 33 years after Powers won the SABC Song for South Africa competition with this song.

<doc id="1110875" wikidata="Q1408813" url="?curid=1110875" title="High-temperature electrolysis">
<text>High-temperature electrolysis (also HTE or steam electrolysis, or HTSE) is a technology for producing hydrogen from water at high temperatures or other products, such as iron or carbon nanomaterials, as higher energy lowers needed electricity to split molecules and opens up new, potentially better electrolytes like molten salts or hydroxides. Unlike electrolysis at room temperature, HTE operates at elevated temperature ranges depending on the thermal capacity of the material. Because of the detrimental effects of burning fossil fuels on humans and the environment, HTE has become a necessary alternative and efficient method by which hydrogen can be prepared on a large scale and used as fuel. The vision of HTE is to move towards decarbonization in all economic sectors. The material requirements for this process are: the heat source, the electrodes, the electrolyte, the electrolyzer membrane, and the source of electricity. 
==Principle==
The process utilizes energy (in the form of heat) from sources to convert water into steam, which is then passed into an electrolytic system (made up of two electrodes connected to the source of current, an electrolyte, and a membrane). At high temperatures (over 650 °C in most topologies), the materials used to construct the cells become conductive. Therefore, electrochemical reactions begin to occur, and the cell begins to function once it has reached the proper temperature and electricity is supplied while it is being fed with steam. The steam will eventually split into hydrogen (cathode) and oxygen (anode) according to the equations below:
:&lt;chem&gt;Overall: 2H2O -&gt; 2H2 + O2&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;Cathode: 2H2O -&gt;2H + 2OH^{-}&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;Anode: 2OH^{-} -&gt; H2O + (1/2)O2&lt;/chem&gt;

==Efficiency==
High temperature electrolysis is more efficient economically than traditional room-temperature electrolysis because some of the energy is supplied as heat, which is cheaper than electricity, and also because the electrolysis reaction is more efficient at higher temperatures. In fact, at 2500 °C, electrical input is unnecessary because water breaks down to hydrogen and oxygen through thermolysis. Such temperatures are impractical; proposed HTE systems operate between 100 °C and 850 °C.

If one assumes that the electricity used comes from a heat engine, it takes 141.86 megajoules (MJ) of heat energy to produce one kg of hydrogen, for the HTE process itself and for the electricity required. At 100 °C, 350 MJ of thermal energy are required (41% efficient). At 850 °C, 225 MJ are required (64% efficient). Above 850 °C, one begins to exceed the capacity of standard chromium steels to resist corrosion, and it&#x27;s already no easy matter to design and implement an industrial scale chemical process to operate at such a high temperature point.

==Materials==
Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are electrochemical devices that function at high temperatures and are used for high-temperature electrolysis. These cells&#x27; ingredients ensure that the device will function well both physically and electrochemically at high temperatures. Therefore, the selection of materials for the electrodes and electrolyte in a solid oxide electrolyser cell is essential. One option being investigated for the process used yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes, Nickel (Ni)-cermet steam/Hydrogen electrodes, and d Oxide of Lanthanum oxide (La2O3), Strontium and Cobalt oxygen electrodes.

==Economic potential==

Even with HTE, electrolysis is a fairly inefficient way to store energy. Significant conversion losses of energy occur both in the electrolysis process, and in the conversion of the resulting hydrogen back into power.

At current hydrocarbon prices, HTE can not compete with pyrolysis of hydrocarbons as an economical source of hydrogen, which produces carbon dioxide as a by-product.

HTE is of interest as a more efficient route to the production &quot;green&quot; hydrogen, to be used as a carbon neutral fuel and general energy storage. It may become economical if cheap non-fossil fuel sources of heat (concentrating solar, nuclear, geothermal, waste heat) can be used in conjunction with non-fossil fuel sources of electricity (such as solar, wind, ocean, nuclear).

Possible supplies of cheap high-temperature heat for HTE are all nonchemical, including nuclear reactors, concentrating solar thermal collectors, and geothermal sources. HTE has been demonstrated in a laboratory at 108 kilojoules (electric) per gram of hydrogen produced, but not at a commercial scale.

Advantages and Challenges

Obviously, the most notable advantage of HTE is that it provides an opportunity for which green hydrogen is prepared on a large scale, because it has the potential for zero emissions. The process provides an improved reaction kinetics for the splitting of water molecule. Part of the electricity requirement is replaced with heat, which makes it a bit cheaper because electricity is more expensive than heat. 

However, HTE technology suffered limitations due to:

# Above 100 °C, the electrolysis of liquid water requires pressurization, and is therefore limited by the working pressures that can be reasonably attained.
# creating materials that are both chemically and physically stable in conditions of intense oxidation and reduction, as well as high working temperatures.
# chemical and physical stability at low electrical conductivities, high working temperatures, and/or ionic concentrations.

===Alternatives===
There are hundreds of thermochemical cycles known to use heat to extract hydrogen from water. For instance, the thermochemical sulfur-iodine cycle. Since the electricity generation step has a fairly low efficiency and is eliminated, thermochemical production might reach higher efficiencies than HTE. However, large-scale thermochemical production will require significant advances in materials that can withstand high-temperature, high-pressure, highly corrosive environments.

==United States Department of Energy==

The DOE Office of Nuclear Energy has demonstration projects to test 3 nuclear facilities with high-temperature electrolysis in the United States at:

* Nine Mile Point Nuclear Generating Station in Oswego, NY
* Davis–Besse Nuclear Power Station in Oak Harbor, Ohio
* Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant in Red Wing, Minnesota

==Mars ISRU==

High temperature electrolysis with solid oxide electrolyser cells was used to produce 5.37 grams of oxygen per hour on Mars from atmospheric carbon dioxide for the Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment in the NASA Mars 2020 Perseverance rover, using zirconia electrolysis devices.

<text>Henry Valentine Knaggs (14 February 1859 – 11 July 1954) was an English physician, anti-vaccinationist, naturopath and alternative health writer.

== Early life ==
He was the second son of Henry Guard Knaggs and Ellen Mares. He was born on 14 February 1859 (St Valentine&#x27;s Day) in St Pancras, London, and there is no evidence that he was ever baptised.

== Education ==
Like his father and grandfather before him, he embarked on a medical career. There is no evidence of an apprenticeship but he obtained his LSA in 1881 after studying at University College London. He was awarded his MRCS and his LM in the same year and also an LRCP from the University of Edinburgh. In 1889 he is recorded as being a fellow of the Zoological Society.

== A physician ==
He worked in the service of the Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Company from 1883 to 1886 presumably on their liners. In 1889 he was resident surgeon at Boscombe Infirmary but his address, from 1883 until 1912 was 189 Camden Road, London NW where he was in general practice as a doctor.

== Family ==
He married Mabel Emily Stow on 24 June 1897 at St Paul&#x27;s Church, St Pancras – Mabel&#x27;s father James was just described as &quot;gentleman&quot; on the marriage certificate. They had two daughters – Dulcie (born 1901, who married George Menzies Trevor Lambrick (an officer in the Indian Army) 1929 in Witney), and Nora (born 1902, who married John B. Maxwell 1929 in Hatfield).

== 20th century ==

The 1913 Medical Who&#x27;s Who gives Knaggs&#x27; addresses as 41 Welbeck Street and Combe Edge, Langley Park, Mill Hill. In 1914 he was living at 41 Queen Anne Street, then, to 1921 (and probably later) he was practising from the up-market address of 25 Wimpole Street, but he was living at &quot;Arbor&quot;, Kings Langley in rural Hertfordshire. His specialities were listed as electro-therapeutics, dietetics and haematology, and his recreations as athletics and literary work of various kinds.

Even late in his life he continued in practice, in his 80s seeing patients in London&#x27;s West End during The Blitz, &quot;for which he had a nonchalant disregard&quot;.

In 1954 he was living in 80 Leigh Gardens, Kensal Rise, London.

== His publications ==

Knaggs was a prolific author. Among his more professional works are &quot;On the Treatment of Diphtheria by Frequent Small Doses of Sulphur,&quot; &quot;On the Treatment of Gout by Salicylate of Potash&quot; and the like. But by far the more numerous are his books and pamphlets for the general public. They are mostly on various aspects of personal health and diet, and have been described as &quot;mostly harmless.&quot; Examples are &quot;Rheumatism and Allied Ailments,&quot; &quot;The Cleansing Saline Fast,&quot; &quot;The Misunderstood Microbe&quot;, &quot;How to Prevent Cancer&quot; and &quot;Potatoes as Food and Medicine&quot; (the last one still in print).

== His ideas ==

He was a naturopath and teetotaling vegetarian, an advocate of natural hygiene, and a long-time member of the National Anti-Vaccination League. He is reported as saying that during the last fifty years as a physician he never prescribed a single drug. He preferred raw foods to cooked ones, and plain water to milk and beverages such as tea and coffee. He was an advocate of exercise and shunned alcohol.

Knaggs was influenced by Antoine Béchamp and believed that germs were not the cause of disease but the products of tissue breakdown. He held pseudoscientific and vitalistic ideas. An article in the &quot;Medical History&quot; journal noted that Knaggs believed that the &quot;human body took in three streams of &quot;solar life essence&quot;, as light, as air, and as food and water: and that uncooked vegetables were &quot;fully charged with magnetism&quot; drawn from sun, earth and water.&quot; His vitalistic ideas were ridiculed in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; as unscientific.

Knaggs authored &quot;The Story of Vitamins&quot;, in 1929. It is alleged that he investigated vitamins in 1910 before Casimir Funk and Frederick Gowland Hopkins discovered them.

Knaggs was influenced by Theosophy. He stated that his book &quot;Blood and Superman&quot; &quot;to a large extent [is] based on Theosophical teaching.&quot;

== His death ==
He died at the age of 95, on 11 July 1954. In his will, he stipulated that his body was to be cremated, the ashes to be scattered, and that there should be no flowers, tombstone or other memorial. He left his furniture and personal effects to his &quot;friend&quot; Mrs Lily Colburn (who shared his address), and the rest of his estate to be divided equally between his wife (who died in 1962) and this &quot;friend.&quot;

The &quot;Times&quot; obituary described him as &quot;a man of great physical courage&quot; who &quot;had the gift of making little fuss aout the details of life&quot;. Saying that he had lived to see many of his originally controversial views on diet and hygiene generally accepted, it concluded that &quot;his loss will be deeply regretted by the thousands to whom his name is a household word&quot;.

<doc id="1110882" wikidata="Q1546135" url="?curid=1110882" title="Kehr's sign">
<text>Kehr&#x27;s sign is the occurrence of acute pain in the tip of the shoulder due to the presence of blood or other irritants in the peritoneal cavity when a person is lying down and the legs are elevated. Kehr&#x27;s sign in the left shoulder is considered a classic symptom of a ruptured spleen. May result from diaphragmatic or peridiaphragmatic lesions, renal calculi, splenic injury or ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

Kehr&#x27;s sign is a classic example of referred pain: irritation of the diaphragm is signaled by the phrenic nerve as pain in the area above the collarbone. This is because the supraclavicular nerves have the same cervical nerves origin as the phrenic nerve, C3, C4, and C5.

The discovery of this is often attributed to a German gall bladder surgeon named Hans Kehr, but extensive studies into research he conducted during his life shows inconclusive evidence as to whether he actually discovered it.

<text>The Maruia River is located in the northwestern South Island of New Zealand. It is a major tributary of the Buller River, flowing for 80 km before joining the larger river eight kilometres to the west of Murchison.

The Maruia River rises in the Spenser Mountains, travelling first to the southwest before turning north for the last 50 km of its length. In its upper reaches, the river&#x27;s valley forms the western approach to the Lewis Pass, the northernmost of the three main mountain passes across the Southern Alps. Hot springs are to be found close to the river in its upper reaches, and the spa of Maruia Springs is located five kilometres to the west of the Lewis Pass, 50 km southeast of Reefton.

3 km east of Springs Junction, the Maruia River flows through the deep and narrow Sluice Box gorge. The river cuts through a band of marble amongst the otherwise predominant greywacke. The Sluice Box, at the junction with the Alfred River, separates the upper and middle section of the Maruia Valley. The area offers a Department of Conservation campsite and is the start of the Lake Daniell Track.

Further downstream, 8 kilometres southwest of Murchison, the Maruia Falls were created by the 1929 Murchison earthquake when a slip blocked the original channel.

<text>Guise ( , ; ) is a commune in the Aisne department in Hauts-de-France in northern France. The city was the birthplace of the noble family of Guise, Dukes of Guise, who later became Princes of Joinville.

==Population==
==Sights==
The remains of the medieval castle of Guise, the seat of the Dukes of Guise, is within the commune.

==Economy==
Guise is the agricultural centre of the northern area of Aisne.

==Miscellaneous==
Guise was the birthplace of Camille Desmoulins (1760–1794), a journalist and politician who played an important part in the French Revolution, and that of Jeanne Macherez who was a heroine during the World War I.

Over a period of 20 years, beginning about 1856, Jean-Baptiste Godin built the (the Social Palace), an industrial and communal residential complex that was a separate community within Guise. It expressed many of his ideas about developing social sympathy through improved housing and services for workers and their families, influenced by the ideas of the philosopher Charles Fourier. In 1880 Godin created a cooperative association by which the workers owned and managed the complex. This continued until 1968.

On the 29th of August 1914 the Battle of St. Quentin (1914) was fought in and around the town. A memorial in Guise celebrates this event.

<text>Sir Samuel William Knaggs (25 December 1856 – 31 December 1924) was a British colonial administrator.

==Biography==
Knaggs was born in Old Swindon, Wiltshire, England, the second of the ten children of Robert Knaggs, a surgeon, and Harriet Eliza Knaggs (née Wright).

Knaggs was sent to the Royal College, Trinidad, and entered the Trinidad Civil Service in 1876. In 1886, he was the secretary of the commission inquiring into the road system. In 1897 he was Acting Commissioner for Tobago. He was appointed Chief Commissioner of Port of Spain in 1899 and Receiver-General for Trinidad in 1901. In 1902 he was Acting Colonial Secretary. In 1903 he was appointed Colonial secretary for Barbados and in 1907 for Trinidad and Tobago. He administered the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in 1907–1910, 1912–1913 and 1915–1916. He retired in January 1919.

Knaggs was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1908 and Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1920 New Year Honours.

<doc id="1110898" wikidata="Q1165179" url="?curid=1110898" title="Kallmann syndrome">
<text>Kallmann syndrome (KS) is a genetic disorder that prevents a person from starting or fully completing puberty. Kallmann syndrome is a form of a group of conditions termed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. To distinguish it from other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, Kallmann syndrome has the additional symptom of a total lack of sense of smell (anosmia) or a reduced sense of smell. If left untreated, people will have poorly defined secondary sexual characteristics, show signs of hypogonadism, almost invariably are infertile and are at increased risk of developing osteoporosis. A range of other physical symptoms affecting the face, hands and skeletal system can also occur.

== Cause &amp; Diagnosis ==
The underlying cause is due to the defective migration of GNRH neurons from olfactory placode to hypothalamus, leading to congenital GNRH deficiency. This leads to olfactory problems such as anosmia, optic defects like color blindness, and results in hypothalmic deficiencies associated with low levels of LH, affecting sex hormone testosterone in males or estrogen and progesterone in females. Diagnosis normally occurs during teenage years when puberty fails to start. Diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome is based on clinical evaluation, endocrine testing, and genetic analysis. Hormone levels typically show low levels of sex steroids and gonadotropins. 

== Treatment ==
Lifelong treatment for both sexes is normally required. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the major form of treatment with the aim to replace the missing testosterone or oestrogen and progesterone. Specialised fertility treatments are also available. The Hormone replacement therapy is used to induce and maintain secondary sexual characteristics and fertility. 

== Epidemiology &amp; History ==
The condition is more commonly diagnosed in males than in females. A 2011 study of the Finnish population produced an estimated incidence of 1 in 48,000 people overall, with 1 in 30,000 for males and 1 in 125,000 for females. Kallmann syndrome was first described by name in a paper published in 1944 by Franz Josef Kallmann, a German-American geneticist. The link between anosmia and hypogonadism had already been noted by Spanish doctor Aureliano Maestre de San Juan in 1856.

== Etiology ==
Kallmann syndrome is caused by mutations in several genes involved in the development of the hypothalamus and olfactory bulbs, including KAL1, FGFR1, FGF8, PROKR2, and PROK2. These mutations disrupt the migration of GnRH-producing neurons from the olfactory placode to the hypothalamus during embryonic development.

== Signs and symptoms ==
It is normally difficult to distinguish a case of Kallmann syndrome (KS)/hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) from a straightforward constitutional delay of puberty. However, if puberty has not started by either age 14 (girls) or 15 (boys) years and one or more of the non-reproductive features mentioned below is present, then a referral to reproductive endocrinologist might be advisable.

The features of KS and other forms of HH can be split into two different categories; &quot;reproductive&quot; and &quot;non-reproductive&quot;.

===Reproductive features===
* Failure to start or fully complete puberty.
* Lack of testicle development in men (size &lt; 4 ml, whereas the normal range is between 12 and 25 ml).
* Primary amenorrhoea (failure to start menstruation).
* Poorly defined secondary sexual characteristics.
* Micropenis in 5-10% of male cases.
* Cryptorchidism (undescended testicles) at birth.
* Low levels of the gonadotropins LH and FSH.
* Hypogonadism due to low levels of testosterone in men or oestrogen/progesterone in women.
* Infertility.

===Non-reproductive features===
* Total lack of sense of smell (anosmia) or markedly reduced sense of smell (hyposmia). This is the defining feature of Kallmann syndrome; it is not seen in other cases of HH. Approximately 50% of HH cases occur with anosmia and can be termed as Kallmann syndrome.
* Cleft palate, cleft lip or other midline cranio-facial defects.
* Neural hearing impairment
* Absence of one of the kidneys (unilateral renal agenesis)
* Skeletal defects including split hand/foot (ectrodactyly), shortened middle finger (metacarpal) or scoliosis
* Manual synkinesis (mirror movements of hands)
* Missing teeth (hypodontia)
* Poor balance or coordination due to cerebral ataxia.
* Eye defects such as coloboma or ptosis.
* Increased incidence of color-blindness 

The exact genetic nature of each particular case of KS/HH will determine which, if any, of the non-reproductive features will occur. The severity of the symptoms will also vary from case to case. Even family members will not show the same range or severity of symptoms.

KS/HH is most often present from birth but adult onset versions are found in both males and females. In those cases, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis) functions normally at birth and well into adult life, giving normal puberty and normal reproductive function. The HPG axis then either fails totally or is reduced to a very low level of GnRH release in adult life with no obvious cause (e.g. a pituitary tumour). This will lead to a fall in testosterone or oestrogen levels and infertility.

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea is seen in females where the HPG axis is suppressed in response to physical or psychological stress or malnutrition but is reversible with the removal of the stressor.

Some cases of KS/HH appear to reverse during adult life where the HPG axis resumes its normal function and GnRH, LH, and FSH levels return to normal levels. This occurs in an estimated 10 to 22% of people, primarily cases of congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) rather than KS cases and only found in people who have undergone some form of testosterone replacement therapy. It is only normally discovered when testicular volume increases while on testosterone treatment alone and testosterone levels return to normal when treatment is stopped. This type of KS/HH rarely occurs in cases where males have had a history of un-descended testes.

Affected individuals with KS and other forms of HH are almost invariably born with normal sexual differentiation; i.e., they are physically male or female. This is due to the human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) produced by placenta at approximately 12 to 20 weeks gestation (pregnancy) which is normally unaffected by having KS or CHH.

People with KS/HH lack the surge of GnRH, LH, and FSH that normally occurs between birth and six months of age, referred to as mini-puberty. This surge is particularly important in infant boys as it helps with testicular descent into the scrotum. The surge of GnRH/LH/FSH in non KS/HH children gives detectable levels of testosterone in boys and oestrogen and progesterone in girls. The lack of this surge can sometimes be used as a diagnostic tool if KS/HH is suspected in a newborn boy, but is not normally distinct enough for diagnosis in girls.

===Osteoporosis===
One possible side effect of having KS/CHH is the increased risk of developing secondary osteoporosis or osteopenia. Oestrogen (females) or testosterone (males) is essential for maintaining bone density. Deficiency in either testosterone or oestrogen can increase the rate of bone resorption while at the same time slowing down the rate of bone formation. Overall this can lead to weakened, fragile bones which have a higher tendency to fracture.

Even a short time with low oestrogen or testosterone, as in cases of delayed diagnosis of KS/CHH can lead to an increased risk of developing osteoporosis but other risk factors, such as smoking are involved so the risk of developing it will vary from person to person. Bone density scans are recommended to monitor the bone mineral density.

The bone density scan is known as a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (DEXA or DXA scan). It is a simple test, taking less than 15 minutes to perform. It involves taking a specialised X-ray picture of the spine and hips and measuring the bone mineral density and comparing the result to the average value for a young healthy adult in the general population.

Adequate calcium levels and, probably, more importantly, vitamin D levels are essential for healthy bone density. Some people with KS/CHH will have their levels checked and may be prescribed extra vitamin D tablets or injections to try to prevent the condition getting worse. The role of vitamin D for general overall health is under close scrutiny at the moment with some researchers claiming vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in many populations and can be linked to other diseases.

Some people with severe osteoporosis might be prescribed bisphosphonates to preserve bone mass, in addition to hormone replacement therapy.

==Genetics==

To date at least 25 different genes have been implicated in causing Kallmann syndrome or other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism through a disruption in the production or activity of GnRH (37). These genes involved cover all forms of inheritance and no one gene defect has been shown to be common to all cases which makes genetic testing and inheritance prediction difficult.

The number of genes known to cause cases of KS/CHH is still increasing. In addition it is thought that some cases of KS/CHH are caused by two separate gene defects occurring at the same time.

Individual gene defects can be associated with specific symptoms which can help in identifying which genes to test for. Between 35 and 45% of cases of KS/CHH have an unknown genetic cause.

The ANOS1 gene defect (previously known as KAL-1) was the first one discovered and the one most commonly tested for. It causes the x-linked form of Kallmann syndrome and is associated with the additional symptoms of anosmia, bimanual synkinesis and renal agenesis. This defect is thought to be responsible for between 5 and 10% of all Kallmann syndrome/CHH cases.

==Pathophysiology==
The underlying cause of Kallmann syndrome or other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a failure in the correct action of the hypothalamic hormone GnRH. The term isolated GnRH deficiency (IGD) has increasingly been used to describe this group of conditions as it highlights the primary cause of these conditions and distinguishes them from other conditions such as Klinefelter syndrome or Turner syndrome which share some similar symptoms but have a different etiology. The term hypogonadism describes a low level of circulating sex hormones; testosterone in males and oestrogen and progesterone in females. Hypogonadism can occur through a number of different mechanisms. The use of the term hypogonadotropic relates to the fact that the hypogonadism found in HH is caused by a disruption in the production of the gonadotropin hormones normally released by the anterior pituitary gland known as luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Failure in GnRH activity can otherwise be due to the absence of the GnRH releasing neurons inside the hypothalamus. HH can occur as an isolated condition with just the LH and FSH production being affected or it can occur in combined pituitary deficiency conditions.

In the first 10 weeks of normal embryonic development, the GnRH releasing neurons migrate from their original source in the nasal region and end up inside the hypothalamus. These neurons originate in an area of the developing head, the olfactory placode, that will give rise to the olfactory epithelium; they then pass through the cribriform plate, along with the fibres of the olfactory nerves, and into the rostral forebrain. From there they migrate to what will become the hypothalamus. Any problems with the development of the olfactory nerve fibres will prevent the progression of the GnRH releasing neurons towards the brain.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosing KS and other forms of CHH is complicated by the difficulties in distinguishing between a normal constitutional delay of puberty or a case of KS/CHH. The diagnosis is often one of exclusion found during the workup of delayed puberty.

In males, the use of age appropriate levels of testosterone can help to distinguish between a case of KS/CHH from a case of delayed puberty. If no puberty is apparent, especially no testicular development, then a review by a reproductive endocrinologist may be appropriate. If puberty is not apparent by the age of 16 then the person should be referred for endocrinological review. Post natal diagnosis of KS/CHH before the age of 6 months is sometimes possible as the normal post natal hormonal surge of gonadotropins along with testosterone or oestrogen is absent in babies with KS/CHH. This lack of detectable hormones in the blood can be used as a diagnostic indicator, especially in male infants.

In females, diagnosis is sometimes further delayed as other causes of amenorrhoea normally have to be investigated first before a case of KS/CHH is considered.

Diagnosis of KS/CHH normal involves a range of clinical, biochemical and radiological tests to exclude other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.

=== Clinical tests ===
* Comparing height to standard growth charts.
* Determining the Tanner stage of sexual development. (Males with KS/CHH are normally at stage I or II with genitalia, females at stage I with breast development and both males and females at stage III with pubic hair development).
* Checking for micropenis and undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in males.
* Measuring testicular volume.
* Checking for breast development and age at menarche in females.
* Checking sense of smell using odorant panel or University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT)
* Checking for hearing impairment.
* Checking for missing teeth or presence of cleft lip and/or cleft palate.
* Checking for pigmentation of skin and hair.
* Checking for mirror movements of the hands or signs of neurodevelopmental delay.
=== Lab tests ===
* Early morning hormonal testing including FSH, LH, testosterone, oestrogen and prolactin.
* GnRH and/or hCG stimulation test to determine activity of hypothalamus and pituitary.
* Sperm test
* Liver function, renal function and inflammation marker testing.
* Karyotype to check for chromosomal abnormalities.
=== Medical imaging ===
* Performing wrist x-ray to determine bone age.
* Brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities in the hypothalamus or pituitary and to check for presence of olfactory bulbs.
* Ultrasound of kidneys to rule out unilateral renal agenesis.
* Bone density scan (DXA) to check for osteoporosis or osteopenia.
==Treatment==

For both males and females, the initial aim for treatment is the development of the secondary sexual characteristics normally seen at puberty. Once this has been achieved, continued hormone replacement therapy is required for both males and females to maintain sexual function, bone health, libido and general wellbeing. In males, testosterone replacement therapy is required for the maintenance of normal muscle mass.

Early treatment is sometimes required for male infants with suspected KS/CHH to correct undescended testes and micropenis if present with the use or surgery or gonadotropin or DHT treatment. Females with KS/CHH normally do not require any treatment before adolescence. Currently, no treatments exist for the lack of sense of smell, mirror movement of the hands or the absence of one kidney.

Treatment for both males and females with KS/CHH normally consists of one of three options which can be used for both hormone replacement therapy and/or fertility treatment.
* Sex hormone replacement (testosterone or oestrogen &amp; progesterone).
* Gonadotropin therapy (medications that replicate the activity of FSH and LH).
* GnRH pulsatile therapy.

===Hormone replacement therapy===
The method and dose of treatment will vary depending on the individual being treated. Initial treatment is normally made with lower doses in younger patients in order to develop the secondary sexual characteristics before adult doses are reached.

For males with KS/CHH the types of testosterone delivery include daily patches, daily gel use, daily capsules, subcutaneous or intramuscular injections or six-monthly implants. Different formulations of testosterone are used to ensure both the anabolic and androgenic effects of testosterone are achieved. Nasal testosterone delivery methods have been developed but their use in KS/CHH treatment has not been formally evaluated.

Gonadotropin therapy, in the form of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injections, with or without the use of FSH, can also be used in male patients to induce secondary sexual characteristic development alongside possible fertility induction.

For females, hormone replacement involves the use of oestrogen and progesterone. Firstly, oestrogen is used in tablet or gel form in order to maximise breast development, then a combination of oestrogen and progesterone is used. Cyclical progesterone is normally required to help keep the endometrium (lining of the uterus) healthy.

In males, the monitoring of treatment normally requires the measurement of serum testosterone, inhibin B, haematocrit and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). If injections are used, trough levels are taken to ensure an adequate level of testosterone is achieved throughout the injection cycle.

In females monitoring normally consists of measurement of oestrogen, FSH, LH, inhibin B and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH).

Standard hormone replacement therapy will not normally induce fertility in either males or females, with no testicular growth in males. Early treatment as adolescents can help with psychological well-being of people with KS/CHH.

===Fertility treatments===
Gonadotropin therapy can be used in both male and female patients in order to achieve fertility for some people.

Pulsatile GnRH therapy can also be used to induce fertility, especially in females, but its use is limited to a few specialist treatment centres.

In males with KS/CHH, infertility is primarily due to the lack of sperm production within the testes. Sperm production can be achieved through either the use of GnRH administered via a microinfusion pump or through the use of gonadotropin injections (hCG, FSH, hMG). The time taken to achieve adequate sperm production for natural conception will vary from person to person. If the pre-treatment testes are very small and there has been a history of undescended testes it might take longer to achieve sperm production. In these cases, assisted reproductive technology, such as sperm retrieval using testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and/or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), might be required.

In females with KS/CHH, infertility is primarily due to the lack of maturation of eggs located within the ovaries. Ovulation induction can be achieved either with pulsatile GnRH therapy or alternatively with gonadotropin injections (hCG, FSH, hMG) given at set intervals to trigger the maturation and release of the egg for natural conception.

==Prognosis==
Reversal of symptoms has been reported in between 10% and 22% of cases.

Reversal cases have been seen in both KS and normosmic CHH but appear to be less common in cases of KS (where the sense of smell is also affected). Reversal is not always permanent and the precise genetic causes are not yet fully understood.

==Epidemiology==
The epidemiology of Kallmann syndrome is not well understood. Individual studies include a 1986 report reviewing medical records in the Sardinian army which found a prevalence of 1 in 86,000 men and a 2011 report from Finland which found a prevalence of 1:30,000 for males and 1:125,000 for females.

Kallmann syndrome occurs about 4 times more often in males than females, but is only 2.5 times more common among males in familial cases.

==History==
The link between anosmia and hypogonadism was noted already in 1856 by the Spanish physician Aureliano Maestre de San Juan who described a 40-year old male who, upon autopsy, exhibited absent olfactory bulbs, undeveloped testicles, micropenis, and lack of pubic hair.

A 1961 case report by the Austrian pathologist Richard Ladislaus Heschl noted an association between male hypogonadism (including an unmasculinised larynx, and sparse body and pubic hair) and anatomical absence of the olfactory nerves, bulb, and tract. The case is later cited by Richard von Krafft-Ebing in his seminal &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot; while discussing the role of olfaction in the physiology of the sexual response:

In 1914, Franz Weidenreich performed autopsies on cadavers of 10 people who had had anosmia, uncovering hypogonadism in three and postulating a syndromic association.

The syndrome is named for Franz Josef Kallmann, a German-American geneticist, who, along with colleagues, described three family clusters of the syndrome in a 1944 paper, thus confirming a heritable, genetic basis of the syndrome. The cases described by Kallmann et al. also exhibited colour blindness, with some additionally exhibiting mental retardation.

In the 1954, De Morsier and Gauthier reported the partial or complete absence of the olfactory bulb in the brains of men with hypogonadism, proving that anosmia resulted from agenesis of the olfactory bulb.

==Terminology==
The terminology used when describing cases of HH vary and can include:
* GnRH deficiency
* congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH)
* idiopathic/isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH)
* normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nHH)
* hypothalamic hypogonadism
* olfacto-genital syndrome

==Research==

Kisspeptin is a protein that regulates the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, which in turn regulates the release of LH and, to a lesser extent, FSH from the anterior pituitary gland. Kisspeptin and its associated receptor KISS1R are known to be involved in the regulation of puberty. Studies have shown there is potential for kisspeptin to be used in the diagnosis and treatment of certain cases of Kallmann syndrome and CHH.

<text>Raman Singh (born 15 October 1952) is an Indian politician who is currently serving as the speaker of the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly since 2023. Formerly, he served as the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh and holding the position for three consecutive times. He is also a member of the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly representing Rajnandgaon since 2008 and from Dongargaon from 2004 to 2008. 

He is the longest serving Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, and held the position for 15 years from 2003 to 2018. Previously he also served as the Minister of State for Commerce and Industries in the Vajpayee cabinet from 1999 to 2003, Member of the Lok Sabha from Rajnanadgaon from 1999 to 2003. Before the state of Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh, he was a member of the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly from Kawardha from 1990 to 1998.

He is also the former National Vice President of Bharatiya Janata Party, serving from 2019 to 2023.

== Early life and education ==
Raman Singh was born in Kawardha, in a Hindu Rajput family, to Vighnaharan Singh Thakur, an advocate, and Sudha Singh. After completion of schooling, he graduated from Government Science College, Bemetara in 1972. In the year 1975 he also studied Ayurvedic Medicine at Government Ayurvedic College, Raipur.

== Political career ==
Singh joined the Bharatiya Janata Party as a youth member and was the president of youth wing in Kawardha in 1976-77. He progressed to become a councillor of Kawardha municipality in 1983.

He was elected to Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly consecutively in 1990 and 1993 from Kawardha (Vidhan Sabha constituency). In 1998 general election he lost the kawardha seat . After that in 1999 he was elected to the 13th Lok Sabha from the Rajnandgaon constituency in Chhattisgarh. In the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Singh became the Union Minister of State for Commerce and Industry from 1999 to 2003. He was later named as President of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the new state of Chhattisgarh, and led the party to a victory in the 2003 state Assembly elections. With the other main contender for the Chief Minister&#x27;s post, Dilip Singh Judeo, caught in the midst of a scam, the BJP leadership named Raman Singh as Chhattisgarh&#x27;s second Chief Minister, and the first person to be elected to that post. He entered Vidhan Sabha by contesting bypoll in 2004 from Dongargaon. He has won 3 successive Vidhan Sabha elections - in 2008, 2013, and 2018 - from Rajnandgaon seat.

He has received praise for his organisational abilities, as reflected in his state&#x27;s position with regard to implementation of a programme to improve the conditions of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes. The United Nations has also recognised the work done in Chhattisgarh under his leadership and the fiscal management of the state is another aspect for which he is known.

He banned Naxalite organisations in Chhattisgarh in 2002 under the &quot;Salwa Judum&quot; initiative, a move supported by the opposition party as well, led by Mahendra Karma who was assassinated by Naxalites on 25 May 2013. Singh was sworn in for his second term on 12 December 2008. On 8 December 2013 he was re-elected as the chief minister (CM) of the state. In August 2017, Chief Minister Raman Singh completed 5000 days as the Chief Minister of the state. By introducing the Public Distribution System (PDS) and other schemes, Singh earned nationwide popularity. As a move to encourage the start-up culture and offering several incentives for start-up entrepreneur he started the &quot;Startup Chhattisgarh&quot; scheme. His other initiatives include promotion of digital technology, interest free agricultural loans in addition to banning the naxal groups, which made him popular in Chhattisgarh. Singh&#x27;s government had received attention for number of welfare measures like Medical care, food security, the Charan Paduka Yojana that entitles people to free shoes, the Saraswati Cycle Yojana that promises a free bicycle to school-going girls, and Mukhya Mantri Teerth Yatra Yojana that allows the elderly to go on their desired pilgrimage, it had introduced in the course of the 15 odd years it had been in power, despite poverty and agrarian distress for 18 years.

BJP won the election in 2013 for his third tenure as a CM of Chhattisgarh. After the loss of his party in the 2018 assembly elections, he resigned as the CM of Chhattisgarh on 11 December 2018.

He has been serving as the Speaker of the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly since December 2023.

== Public image ==
Raman Singh is famous in Chhattisgarh as Chaunr Wale Baba means “Baba with Rice”.
After Chhattisgarh became a new state, he did a lot of development work and his contribution cannot be forgotten. His image among the people of Chhattisgarh is that of an educated, soft-spoken and sociable person. Naxalites were wiped out from many districts of Chhattisgarh during his tenure.

<text>In computer science, a tail call is a subroutine call performed as the final action of a procedure. If the target of a tail is the same subroutine, the subroutine is said to be tail recursive, which is a special case of direct recursion. Tail recursion (or tail-end recursion) is particularly useful, and is often easy to optimize in implementations. 

Tail calls can be implemented without adding a new stack frame to the call stack. Most of the frame of the current procedure is no longer needed, and can be replaced by the frame of the tail call, modified as appropriate (similar to overlay for processes, but for function calls). The program can then jump to the called subroutine. Producing such code instead of a standard call sequence is called tail-call elimination or tail-call optimization. Tail-call elimination allows procedure calls in tail position to be implemented as efficiently as goto statements, thus allowing efficient structured programming. In the words of Guy L. Steele, &quot;in general, procedure calls may be usefully thought of as GOTO statements which also pass parameters, and can be uniformly coded as [machine code] JUMP instructions.&quot;

Not all programming languages require tail-call elimination. However, in functional programming languages, tail-call elimination is often guaranteed by the language standard, allowing tail recursion to use a similar amount of memory as an equivalent loop. The special case of tail-recursive calls, when a function calls itself, may be more amenable to call elimination than general tail calls. When the language semantics do not explicitly support general tail calls, a compiler can often still optimize sibling calls, or tail calls to functions which take and return the same types as the caller.

==Description==
When a function is called, the computer must &quot;remember&quot; the place it was called from, the &quot;return address&quot;, so that it can return to that location with the result once the call is complete. Typically, this information is saved on the call stack, a list of return locations in the order that the call locations were reached. For tail calls, there is no need to remember the caller – instead, tail-call elimination makes only the minimum necessary changes to the stack frame before passing it on, and the tail-called function will return directly to the &quot;original&quot; caller. The tail call doesn&#x27;t have to appear lexically after all other statements in the source code; it is only important that the calling function return immediately after the tail call, returning the tail call&#x27;s result if any, since the calling function is bypassed when the optimization is performed.

For non-recursive function calls, this is usually an optimization that saves only a little time and space, since there are not that many different functions available to call. When dealing with recursive or mutually recursive functions where recursion happens through tail calls, however, the stack space and the number of returns saved can grow to be very significant, since a function can call itself, directly or indirectly, creating a new call stack frame each time. Tail-call elimination often reduces asymptotic stack space requirements from linear, or O(n), to constant, or O(1). Tail-call elimination is thus required by the standard definitions of some programming languages, such as Scheme, and languages in the ML family among others. The Scheme language definition formalizes the intuitive notion of tail position exactly, by specifying which syntactic forms allow having results in tail context. Implementations allowing an unlimited number of tail calls to be active at the same moment, thanks to tail-call elimination, can also be called &#x27;properly tail recursive&#x27;.

Besides space and execution efficiency, tail-call elimination is important in the functional programming idiom known as continuation-passing style (CPS), which would otherwise quickly run out of stack space.

==Syntactic form==
A tail call can be located just before the syntactical end of a function:
function foo(data) {
 a(data);
 return b(data);


Here, both codice_1 and codice_2 are calls, but codice_3 is the last thing the procedure executes before returning and is thus in tail position. However, not all tail calls are necessarily located at the syntactical end of a subroutine:
function bar(data) {
 if (a(data)) {
 return b(data);
 return c(data);


Here, both calls to codice_3 and codice_5 are in tail position. This is because each of them lies in the end of if-branch respectively, even though the first one is not syntactically at the end of codice_6&#x27;s body.

In this code:
function foo1(data) {
 return a(data) + 1;


function foo2(data) {
 var ret = a(data);
 return ret;


function foo3(data) {
 var ret = a(data);
 return (ret == 0) ? 1 : ret;


the call to codice_1 is in tail position in codice_8, but it is not in tail position either in codice_9 or in codice_10, because control must return to the caller to allow it to inspect or modify the return value before returning it.

==Example programs==
The following program is an example in Scheme:
;; factorial : number -&gt; number
;; to calculate the product of all positive
;; integers less than or equal to n.
(define (factorial n)
 (if (= n 0)
 1
 (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
This is not written in a tail-recursive style, because the multiplication function (&quot;*&quot;) is in the tail position. This can be compared to:
;; factorial : number -&gt; number
;; to calculate the product of all positive
;; integers less than or equal to n.
(define (factorial n)
 (fact-iter 1 n))
(define (fact-iter product n)
 (if (= n 0)
 product
 (fact-iter (* product n)
 (- n 1))))
This program assumes applicative-order evaluation. The inner procedure codice_11 calls itself &quot;last&quot; in the control flow. This allows an interpreter or compiler to reorganize the execution which would ordinarily look like this:

 call factorial (4)
 call fact-iter (1 4)
 call fact-iter (4 3)
 call fact-iter (12 2)
 call fact-iter (24 1)
 return 24
 return 24
 return 24
 return 24
 return 24

into the more efficient variant, in terms of both space and time:

 call factorial (4)
 call fact-iter (1 4)
 replace arguments with (4 3)
 replace arguments with (12 2)
 replace arguments with (24 1)
 return 24
 return 24

This reorganization saves space because no state except for the calling function&#x27;s address needs to be saved, either on the stack or on the heap, and the call stack frame for codice_11 is reused for the intermediate results storage. This also means that the programmer need not worry about running out of stack or heap space for extremely deep recursions. In typical implementations, the tail-recursive variant will be substantially faster than the other variant, but only by a constant factor.

Some programmers working in functional languages will rewrite recursive code to be tail recursive so they can take advantage of this feature. This often requires addition of an &quot;accumulator&quot; argument (codice_13 in the above example) to the function. 

==Tail recursion modulo cons==
Tail recursion modulo cons is a generalization of tail-recursion optimization introduced by David H. D. Warren in the context of compilation of Prolog, seen as an &quot;explicitly&quot; &quot;set once&quot; language. It was described (though not named) by Daniel P. Friedman and David S. Wise in 1974 as a LISP compilation technique. As the name suggests, it applies when the only operation left to perform after a recursive call is to prepend a known value in front of the list returned from it (or to perform a constant number of simple data-constructing operations, in general). This call would thus be a &quot;tail call&quot; save for (&quot;modulo&quot;) the said &quot;cons&quot; operation. But prefixing a value at the start of a list &quot;on exit&quot; from a recursive call is the same as appending this value at the end of the growing list &quot;on entry&quot; into the recursive call, thus building the list as a side effect, as if in an implicit accumulator parameter. The following Prolog fragment illustrates the concept:

===Example code===
Thus in tail-recursive translation such a call is transformed into first creating a new list node and setting its codice_14 field, and &quot;then&quot; making the tail call with the pointer to the node&#x27;s codice_15 field as argument, to be filled recursively. The same effect is achieved when the recursion is &quot;guarded&quot; under a lazily evaluated data constructor, which is automatically achieved in lazy programming languages like Haskell.

===C example===
The following fragment defines a recursive function in C that duplicates a linked list (with some equivalent Scheme and Prolog code as comments, for comparison):
In this form the function is not tail recursive, because control returns to the caller after the recursive call duplicates the rest of the input list. Even if it were to allocate the &quot;head&quot; node before duplicating the rest, it would still need to plug in the result of the recursive call into the codice_16 field &quot;after&quot; the call.
So the function is &quot;almost&quot; tail recursive. Warren&#x27;s method pushes the responsibility of filling the codice_16 field into the recursive call itself, which thus becomes tail call. Using sentinel head node to simplify the code, 

The callee now appends to the end of the growing list, rather than have the caller prepend to the beginning of the returned list. The work is now done on the way &quot;forward&quot; from the list&#x27;s start, &quot;before&quot; the recursive call which then proceeds further, instead of &quot;backward&quot; from the list&#x27;s end, &quot;after&quot; the recursive call has returned its result. It is thus similar to the accumulating parameter technique, turning a recursive computation into an iterative one.

Characteristically for this technique, a parent frame is created on the execution call stack, which the tail-recursive callee can reuse as its own call frame if the tail-call optimization is present.

The tail-recursive implementation can now be converted into an explicitly iterative implementation, as an accumulating loop:
==History==
In a paper delivered to the ACM conference in Seattle in 1977, Guy L. Steele summarized the debate over the GOTO and structured programming, and observed that procedure calls in the tail position of a procedure can be best treated as a direct transfer of control to the called procedure, typically eliminating unnecessary stack manipulation operations. Since such &quot;tail calls&quot; are very common in Lisp, a language where procedure calls are ubiquitous, this form of optimization considerably reduces the cost of a procedure call compared to other implementations. Steele argued that poorly-implemented procedure calls had led to an artificial perception that the GOTO was cheap compared to the procedure call. Steele further argued that &quot;in general procedure calls may be usefully thought of as GOTO statements which also pass parameters, and can be uniformly coded as [machine code] JUMP instructions&quot;, with the machine code stack manipulation instructions &quot;considered an optimization (rather than vice versa!)&quot;. Steele cited evidence that well-optimized numerical algorithms in Lisp could execute faster than code produced by then-available commercial Fortran compilers because the cost of a procedure call in Lisp was much lower. In Scheme, a Lisp dialect developed by Steele with Gerald Jay Sussman, tail-call elimination is guaranteed to be implemented in any interpreter.

==Implementation methods==
Tail recursion is important to some high-level languages, especially functional and logic languages and members of the Lisp family. In these languages, tail recursion is the most commonly used way (and sometimes the only way available) of implementing iteration. The language specification of Scheme requires that tail calls are to be optimized so as not to grow the stack. Tail calls can be made explicitly in Perl, with a variant of the &quot;goto&quot; statement that takes a function name: codice_18

However, for language implementations which store function arguments and local variables on a call stack (which is the default implementation for many languages, at least on systems with a hardware stack, such as the x86), implementing generalized tail-call optimization (including mutual tail recursion) presents an issue: if the size of the callee&#x27;s activation record is different from that of the caller, then additional cleanup or resizing of the stack frame may be required. For these cases, optimizing tail recursion remains trivial, but general tail-call optimization may be harder to implement efficiently.

For example, in the Java virtual machine (JVM), tail-recursive calls can be eliminated (as this reuses the existing call stack), but general tail calls cannot be (as this changes the call stack). As a result, functional languages such as Scala that target the JVM can efficiently implement direct tail recursion, but not mutual tail recursion.

The GCC, LLVM/Clang, and Intel compiler suites perform tail-call optimization for C and other languages at higher optimization levels or when the codice_19 option is passed. Though the given language syntax may not explicitly support it, the compiler can make this optimization whenever it can determine that the return types for the caller and callee are equivalent, and that the argument types passed to both function are either the same, or require the same amount of total storage space on the call stack.

Various implementation methods are available.

===In assembly===

Tail calls are often optimized by interpreters and compilers of functional programming and logic programming languages to more efficient forms of iteration. For example, Scheme programmers commonly express while loops as calls to procedures in tail position and rely on the Scheme compiler or interpreter to substitute the tail calls with more efficient jump instructions.

For compilers generating assembly directly, tail-call elimination is easy: it suffices to replace a call opcode with a jump one, after fixing parameters on the stack. From a compiler&#x27;s perspective, the first example above is initially translated into pseudo-assembly language (in fact, this is valid x86 assembly):
 foo:
 call B
 call A
 ret
Tail-call elimination replaces the last two lines with a single jump instruction:

 foo:
 call B
 jmp A
After subroutine codice_20 completes, it will then return directly to the return address of codice_21, omitting the unnecessary codice_22 statement.

Typically, the subroutines being called need to be supplied with parameters. The generated code thus needs to make sure that the call frame for A is properly set up before jumping to the tail-called subroutine. For instance, on platforms where the call stack does not just contain the return address, but also the parameters for the subroutine, the compiler may need to emit instructions to adjust the call stack. On such a platform, for the code:

 function foo(data1, data2)
 B(data1)
 return A(data2)

(where codice_23 and codice_24 are parameters) a compiler might translate that as:
 foo:
 mov reg,[sp+data1] ; fetch data1 from stack (sp) parameter into a scratch register.
 push reg ; put data1 on stack where B expects it
 call B ; B uses data1
 pop ; remove data1 from stack
 mov reg,[sp+data2] ; fetch data2 from stack (sp) parameter into a scratch register.
 push reg ; put data2 on stack where A expects it
 call A ; A uses data2
 pop ; remove data2 from stack.
 ret
A tail-call optimizer could then change the code to:
 foo:
 mov reg,[sp+data1] ; fetch data1 from stack (sp) parameter into a scratch register.
 push reg ; put data1 on stack where B expects it
 call B ; B uses data1
 pop ; remove data1 from stack
 mov reg,[sp+data2] ; fetch data2 from stack (sp) parameter into a scratch register.
 mov [sp+data1],reg ; put data2 where A expects it
 jmp A ; A uses data2 and returns immediately to caller.
This code is more efficient both in terms of execution speed and use of stack space.

===Through trampolining===
Since many Scheme compilers use C as an intermediate target code, the tail recursion must be encoded in C without growing the stack, even if the C compiler does not optimize tail calls. Many implementations achieve this by using a device known as a trampoline, a piece of code that repeatedly calls functions. All functions are entered via the trampoline. When a function has to tail-call another, instead of calling it directly and then returning the result, it returns the address of the function to be called and the call parameters back to the trampoline (from which it was called itself), and the trampoline takes care of calling this function next with the specified parameters. This ensures that the C stack does not grow and iteration can continue indefinitely.

It is possible to implement trampolines using higher-order functions in languages that support them, such as Groovy, Visual Basic .NET and C#.

Using a trampoline for all function calls is rather more expensive than the normal C function call, so at least one Scheme compiler, Chicken, uses a technique first described by Henry Baker from an unpublished suggestion by Andrew Appel, in which normal C calls are used but the stack size is checked before every call. When the stack reaches its maximum permitted size, objects on the stack are garbage-collected using the Cheney algorithm by moving all live data into a separate heap. Following this, the stack is unwound (&quot;popped&quot;) and the program resumes from the state saved just before the garbage collection. Baker says &quot;Appel&#x27;s method avoids making a large number of small trampoline bounces by occasionally jumping off the Empire State Building.&quot; The garbage collection ensures that mutual tail recursion can continue indefinitely. However, this approach requires that no C function call ever returns, since there is no guarantee that its caller&#x27;s stack frame still exists; therefore, it involves a much more dramatic internal rewriting of the program code: continuation-passing style.

==Relation to the &quot;while&quot; statement==
Tail recursion can be related to the &quot;while&quot; statement, an explicit iteration, for instance by transforming

 procedure foo(&quot;x&quot;)
 if &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)
 return bar(&quot;x&quot;)
 else
 return foo(baz(&quot;x&quot;))

into

 procedure foo(&quot;x&quot;)
 while true
 if &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)
 return bar(&quot;x&quot;)
 else
 &quot;x&quot; ← baz(&quot;x&quot;)

where &quot;x&quot; may be a tuple involving more than one variable: if so, care must be taken in implementing the assignment statement &quot;x&quot; ← baz(&quot;x&quot;) so that dependencies are respected. One may need to introduce auxiliary variables or use a &quot;swap&quot; construct.

More generally,

 procedure foo(&quot;x&quot;)
 if &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)
 return bar(&quot;x&quot;)
 else if &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)
 return baz(&quot;x&quot;)
 else if &quot;r&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)
 return foo(qux(&quot;x&quot;))
 else
 return foo(quux(&quot;x&quot;))

can be transformed into

 procedure foo(&quot;x&quot;)
 while true
 if &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)
 return bar(&quot;x&quot;)
 else if &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)
 return baz(&quot;x&quot;)
 else if &quot;r&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)
 &quot;x&quot; ← qux(&quot;x&quot;)
 else
 &quot;x&quot; ← quux(&quot;x&quot;)

For instance, this Julia program gives a non-tail recursive definition codice_25 of the factorial:
function factorial(n)
 if n == 0
 return 1
 else
 return n * factorial(n - 1)
 end
end 
Indeed, codice_26 wraps the call to codice_27. But it can be transformed into a tail-recursive definition by adding an argument codice_28 called an &quot;accumulator&quot;.

This Julia program gives a tail-recursive definition codice_29 of the factorial:
function factorial(n::Integer, a::Integer)
 if n == 0:
 return a
 else
 return factorial(n - 1, n * a)
 end
end

function factorial(n::Integer)
 return factorial(n, 1)
end
This Julia program gives an iterative definition codice_29 of the factorial:
function fact_iter(n::Integer, a::Integer)
 while n &gt; 0
 a = n * a
 n = n - 1
 end
 return a
end

function factorial(n::Integer)
 return fact_iter(n, one(n))
end
==Language support==
* Clojure Clojure has codice_31 special form.
* Common Lisp Some implementations perform tail-call optimization during compilation if optimizing for speed
* Elixir Elixir implements tail-call optimization, as do all languages currently targeting the BEAM VM.
* Elm Yes
* Erlang Yes
* F# F# implements TCO by default where possible 
* Go No support
* Haskell Yes
* JavaScript ECMAScript 6.0 compliant engines should have tail calls which is now implemented on Safari/WebKit but rejected by V8 and SpiderMonkey
* Kotlin Has codice_32 modifier for functions
* Lua Tail recursion is required by the language definition
* Objective-C Compiler optimizes tail calls when -O1 (or higher) option specified but it is easily disturbed by calls added by Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).
* OCaml Yes
* Perl Explicit with a variant of the &quot;goto&quot; statement that takes a function name: codice_18
* PureScript Yes
* Python Stock Python implementations do not perform tail-call optimization, though a third-party module is available to do this. Language inventor Guido van Rossum contended that stack traces are altered by tail-call elimination making debugging harder, and preferred that programmers use explicit iteration instead. However, tail-call optimization was introduced in the Python 3.14 interpreter, where tail calls between small C functions implement individual Python opcodes. This resulted in significantly better performance when compared to Python 3.13.
* R Yes, tailcall() function introduced in R.4.4.0
* Racket Yes
* Ruby Yes, but disabled by default 
* Rust tail-call optimization may be done in limited circumstances, but is not guaranteed
* Scala Tail-recursive functions are automatically optimized by the compiler. Such functions can also optionally be marked with a codice_34 annotation, which makes it a compilation error if the function is not tail recursive
* Scheme Required by the language definition
* Swift In some cases (as of 2014).
* Tcl Since Tcl 8.6, Tcl has a tailcall command
* Zig Yes

<text>The &#x27; &quot;(en: Left Youth [&#x27;solid])&quot; is a political youth organisation in Germany. It is the official youth wing of the political party The Left. It was formed in 2007 as the legal successor to &#x27; (en: Solid: the socialist youth) which was the unofficial youth wing of the Left Party and its predecessor PDS. The name &quot;solid&quot; comes from &quot;(socialist, left, democratic.)&quot;

== History ==

&quot;Solid: the socialist youth&quot; was formed in Hanover in June 1999 and was accepted by the Party of Democratic Socialism as a youth organisation &quot;close to PDS&quot; in March 2002. Membership is for people between the ages of 14 and 35 and in March 2005 they had 1,500 members.

Before 1999 the PDS&#x27;s youth organisation was ; since then, most young members of the Left-Party have concentrated within [&#x27;solid]. But due to differences, other young members formed the &quot;PDS Youth&quot;, a youth organisation integrated within the party and by self-definition of the group serving to form future cadres for the full-fledged party. The PDS-youth was small compared to [&#x27;solid] and only represented in a small number of the federal States of Germany.

On Solid&#x27;s federal delegate congress on 20 May 2007, the organisation reorganised to the present structure including the former PDS Youth and the youth organisation of WASG. This was a response to the fusion of the Left Party/PDS and WASG.

<doc id="1110908" wikidata="Q5467935" url="?curid=1110908" title="Ford Sidevalve engine">
<text>The Ford Sidevalve is a side valve (flathead engine) from the British arm of the Ford Motor Company, often also referred to as the &quot;English Sidevalve&quot;. The engine had its origins in the 1930s Ford Model Y, and was made in two sizes, or &quot;8 HP&quot;, and or &quot;10 HP&quot;.

==History==
Early Ford Sidevalve engines did not have a water pump as standard, instead relying on thermosiphon cooling as the Model T engine had. A water pump was added in 1953 for the 100E models when the engine was re-engineered to the point that few specifications are identical between the early and the later series. The Sidevalve engine was used in many smaller Fords as well as farm vehicles, commercial vehicles and a marine version in boats. Production of the engine was stopped in 1962. Windscreen wipers were often driven by the vacuum generated in the inlet manifold.

The Sidevalve engine was also used in German Fords, starting with the Ford Köln in 1932 and ending with the last rear-wheel drive Ford Taunus P1 12M (G13/G13AL) in 1962. Early further research and development were being carried out at the German Ford engine plant in Cologne to improve the engine for ease of use in the Taunus line of cars, including a 44 hp 1.5 developed from the 1172 cc for the Taunus G93A but this work was finally halted in 1942. 

Ford of Germany would later make use of the work on the 1.5 development of the 1.2 Sidevalve and convert it to a 55 hp 1498 cc Overhead-Valve design for the 1955 Ford Taunus 15M P1, which would later be further enlarged to a 59 hp 1698 cc for the 1957 Ford Taunus 17M P2 and 69–74 hp 1758 cc for the 1960 Ford Taunus 17M/TS 1750 P3 until production ceased in 1964.

It was replaced by the Kent engine in Britain and by the Taunus V4 engine in Germany.

==Modifications==
Many ways were explored to enhance the power output of the standard engine, most notably special exhaust manifolds, twin carburettors, stiffer valve springs, thinner cylinder head gaskets and modified camshafts. The most hardcore performance tuning available was the Inlet Over Exhaust (IOE) cylinder head conversion from Willment and Elva, which could be built to produce 70+ BHP 

==Power rating==
The nominal horsepower quoted for each engine size comes from the British method of power calculation for road taxation purposes, and bears no relationship with the actual power output. Displacement, cylinder diameter, stroke, and number of cylinders determined the power for road taxation purposes.

==Gearbox &amp; transmission==
A three-speed gearbox was fitted as standard; three forward and one reverse.

==Coverage==

Since 2006, the show&#x27;s national reach has declined, with groups such as Broadcast Operations Group (BOG), Southern Cross Austereo (SCA), Grant Broadcasters (now ARN) and Capital Radio Network dropping 2GB&#x27;s coverage for programs from either SCA&#x27;s Triple M, 2SM or SEN, or in the case of Grant/ARN, dropping networked sports coverage entirely for cheaper local sport programs mixed with music. 

This means that listeners in some areas, mainly in areas with stations owned by BOG or ARN, must either rely on coverage on ABC Grandstand or stream the program online. Stations that picked up coverage in 2008 and 2009, such as Gosford&#x27;s Star FM, along with stations in Northern Queensland and the Northern Territory have since dropped the program.

As of March 2023, only Nine-owned 2GB and 4BC take the program in its entirety, along with stations in Canberra, Lithgow, Perth, parts of regional Queensland and Paupa New Guinea taking portions of the program.

==Format==

===Fridays===
The &quot;Continuous Call Team&quot; broadcasts &quot;Friday Night Football&quot; from 7.00pm (with the kick-off at 7.30pm) until 9.45pm. David Morrow calls the selected scheduled game that&#x27;s on the Nine Network in Sydney with Darryl Brohman and Mark Riddell on the sidelines.

===Saturdays===
Between 12pm and 5pm, the programme is broadcast from the 2GB studio in Pyrmont with Mark Levy, Brohman, Mark Riddell, and David Morrow. The program consists of reviews of the previous night&#x27;s match, short reports on the night&#x27;s upcoming match, combined with large amounts of comedy, including stories of the team member&#x27;s private lives, humorous songs about the team members and issues in rugby league, as well as discussion on unrelated issues. However, much of the program is focused on the open line calls of the program&#x27;s listeners.

From 5pm – 7:30pm the program moves to a live broadcast from either the ground or the 2GB 873 Interactive Studio, depending on where the game it located. The program is hosted by Mark Levy, with David Morrow, Riddell and Brohman.

As of 2012, 2GB hosts a live broadcast of the 7:30pm NRL game with Mark Levy and Chris Warren as commentators. After the game, there are player interviews plus the broadcast team analyse the night&#x27;s games with callers and emailers.

===Sundays===
The programme airs from 12 Noon- 6pm and is broadcast live from the ground of a selected Sunday match. Progress scores from other matches are provided by reporters live at those grounds. The team review the Saturday night match, and discuss the upcoming matches for that day. There is less of a focus on comedy on Sundays, however it is still evident. From 2pm or 3pm, Mark Levy with Mark Riddell and Darryl Brohman broadcast the selected match. After the game, players and coaches are interviewed, listeners give their opinions on the day&#x27;s matches, and the premiership ladder is updated.

==History==
The program began in 1987 when Ray Hadley and Ray Price took over the commentary duties on 2UE. When 2UE lost the rights to broadcast NRL games in 1999 to 2GB, the station asked commentator Ray Hadley to present a six-hour rugby league program, without having the rights to the actual games, nor having access to their reporters inside the ground. Several 2UE commentators, including John Gibbs and Darryl Brohman, joined 2GB.

The program was renamed &quot;The Talking League Team&quot;. The team consisting of Ray Hadley, Peter Frilingos, Bob Fulton, Steve Roach, Tony Megahey and Greg Alexander astounded industry insiders when they beat 2GB and ABC Radio, both of whom had the actual rights to NRL games in 2000 and 2001. Many network stations dropped 2GB coverage and switched to 2UE&#x27;s coverage.
At one stage, rival 2GB campaigned for Foxtel to cut off 2UE&#x27;s access to the service, as they were calling games off their coverage. The team stopped the practice soon after the threat was made.

In 2002, when Ray Hadley moved to 2GB, he brought his team over with him (with the exception of Alexander) to bring their coverage of live NRL games, and continued to win the ratings since then.

In 2004, the team lost longtime member Peter Frilingos to a heart attack, and his spot was not filled for the rest of the season, to be eventually replaced by Darryl Brohman in 2005.

In 2011, Hadley gave up commentating games with Moore calling all three weekend games.

In 2012, Hadley would take over commentating Nine Network&#x27;s second Friday night game.

==Songs==
Throughout the history of &quot;The Continuous Call Team&quot;, music has been an integral part of the program with send ups of popular songs of any era and genre. Lyrically, these songs have been directed at anyone or anything related to rugby league (be it referees, clubs, players, coaches and the like). The songs are written and many are also performed by The Robertson Brothers who are exclusively commissioned by and to &quot;The Continuous Call Team&quot;, as well as other aspiring performers.

==CCT TV==
In 2008, a 30-minute program known as &quot;CCT TV – Weekend Detention&quot;, featuring video of the team in the studio of a Saturday afternoon was produced for the RugbyLeagueLive.com website.

<doc id="1110915" wikidata="Q449361" url="?curid=1110915" title="Young Liberals (Germany)">
<text>The Young Liberals (, JuLis), is a political youth organisation in Germany. It is the financially and organisationally independent youth wing of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). The JuLis claim about 15,000 members, making it the third largest youth organisation in Germany.

==Political profile==

The current policy statement of the JuLis was passed in 2008. It is a revision of the policy statement of 1994, and is called &quot;Humanistic Liberalism - thought for the future&quot;. It focuses on the market economy and civil liberties, being supplemented by the democratic resolutions of regular congresses.

The political objectives of the JuLis mostly aim to the same general objectives as the FDP, however they often differ in details. The Young Liberals advocate civil liberties, sociopolitics and an ecologically sustainable social market economy. The JuLis focus on political freedom, self-responsibility, equal opportunity, deregulation and reducing the state&#x27;s influence to its core competences such as the prevention from economic cartels.

The Young Liberals often perceive themselves as the policy making stimulus of the FDP and try to propose innovations into the party, sometimes succeeding e.g. in the FDP&#x27;s decision to challenge the abandonment of the German compulsory military service, to support of the concept of an ecologically-sustainable social market economy, and replacement of existing social welfare benefits with a basic income called &quot;Bürgergeld&quot;.

==History==
The JuLis were founded in 1980, and was recognized as the official FDP youth wing in 1983. Prior to 1982, Jungdemokraten (Young Democrats) had been the FDP youth organisation.

<doc id="1110917" wikidata="Q89468" url="?curid=1110917" title="Kasbah">
<text>A kasbah (, ; , , ), also spelled qasbah, qasba, qasaba, or casbah, is a fortress, most commonly the citadel or fortified quarter of a city. It is also equivalent to the term  in Spanish (), which is derived from the same Arabic word. By extension, the term can also refer to a medina quarter, particularly in Algeria. In various languages, the Arabic word, or local words borrowed from the Arabic word, can also refer to a settlement, a fort, a watchtower, or a blockhouse.

==Citadel or fortress==
The term &quot;qasaba&quot; was historically flexible but it essentially denotes a fortress, commonly a citadel that protects a city or settlement area, or that serves as the administrative center. A kasbah citadel typically housed the military garrison and other privileged buildings such as a palace, along with other amenities such as a mosque and a hammam (bathhouse). Some kasbahs are built in a strategic elevated position overlooking the city, like the Kasbah of the Oudayas in Rabat, Morocco, or the Alcazaba of Málaga in Spain. It could also be a large purpose-built royal quarter, protected by its own set of walls, that housed the palace of the ruler and the administration of the state. Examples of this include the Kasbah of Marrakesh and the Kasbah of Tunis, both founded by the Almohads, who built or redeveloped similar palace enclosures in many important cities of their empire. In some cases, kasbahs could be simple fortified enclosures around a city that housed military garrisons, without being the main citadel. In Fez, for example, there were up to 13 kasbahs built throughout the city in different periods, including the Kasbah an-Nouar and the Kasbah Cherarda.

According to architect and restorer Leopoldo Torres Balbás, the Alcazaba of Málaga is the prototype of military architecture in the Taifa period in Al-Andalus, with its double wall and many fortifications. Its only parallel is the castle of Krak des Chevaliers in Syria. Examples of other &quot;alcazabas&quot; in Spain include the Alcazaba of Almería, the Alcazaba of Antequera, the Alcazaba of Badajoz, the Alcazaba of Guadix, the Alcazaba of Mérida, the Castle of Molina de Aragón, the Alcazaba of Alcalá la Real and in the Alcazaba of the Alhambra in Granada. 

In Morocco, the term &quot;kasbah&quot; is also used in predominantly Amazigh regions to denote a fortified residence (&quot;tighremt&quot; in Amazigh languages), often built of mudbrick, such as the Kasbah of Telouet or the Kasbah Amridil. In southern Tunisia, the term is sometimes applied to a type of fortified granaries (also known as &quot;ksour&quot;).

== Other uses of the term ==
=== Old city ===
The word &quot;kasbah&quot; may also be used to describe the old part of a city, in which case it has the same meaning as a medina quarter. In Algiers, the name &quot;qasaba&quot; originally referred to the upper part of the city which contained the citadel and residence of the rulers. Following the French conquest of the country in 1830, most of the historic lower town of Algiers was demolished and remodeled along European lines. The only part of the old city that remained relatively untouched was the upper town, thus known as the &quot;Casbah&quot; of Algiers. The Casbah of Dellys is another example of the term being used for an old city.

=== Watchtowers in the Arabian Peninsula ===
The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; article on Asir (southwestern province of Saudi Arabia), mentions that &quot;ancient &quot;qasaba&quot; (&quot;towers&quot;) found in the province were used as lookouts or granaries.&quot; Another book describes these towers as follows: &quot;Apparently unique to Asir architecture are the qasaba towers. Controversy surrounds their function – some argue that they were built as lookouts, and others that they were keeps, or even granaries. Perhaps it is a combination, although the right position of a watchtower, on a hill top, is the wrong place for a keep or granary.&quot; Archaeologists have found images of similar towers in the ruins of Qaryat al-Fāw, in the Rub&#x27; al Khali of Saudi Arabia, that date from between the 3rd century BCE to the 4th century CE. &quot;Homes rose two stories, supported by stone walls nearly two meters (6&#x27;) thick and boasting such amenities as water-supply systems and second-floor latrines. One eye-catching mural faintly depicts a multi-story tower house with figures in the windows: Its design resembles similar dwellings today in Yemen and southern Saudi Arabia.&quot;

&quot;Most of the qasabas have a circular plan, although some are square. Sometimes they have a band of quartz stones just below the windows or framing the windows – one well preserved example is at the top of Wadi Ain. The remains of a martello tower-like stone structure are just off the dirt track north of Al-Masnah. It appears to be an interesting antecedent of the Asir farmhouse and perhaps closely related to the qasaba. It is in ruins now, but was once a dwelling and is strongly defensive.&quot; One account says about a traditional village in Al-Bahah, Saudi Arabia: &quot;Even the road that leads to the village is impressive, and several historical stone and slate towers dot the way. Al-Bahah Province is known as the region of 1001 towers, once built to protect villages, roads and plantations from rivalling tribes. Today, these towers are abandoned, and many of them are partially or completely in ruins.&quot;

<doc id="1110919" wikidata="Q7175444" url="?curid=1110919" title="Peter Levy (presenter)">
<text>Peter Levy (born 5 September 1955) is a BBC television and occasional radio presenter on BBC Radio Humberside. He previously worked in commercial radio.

Since November 2002, he has been a weekday presenter of the BBC regional news programme &quot;Look North&quot;. The programme is broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Kingston upon Hull studios to the areas of East Riding of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, North West Norfolk and parts of Nottinghamshire via the Belmont transmitter.

==Early life==
Levy was born in Farnborough, Kent, England, and attended a secondary modern school in Truro, Cornwall. He first came to Yorkshire in his late teens. He was an actor in his teenage years, with small roles in shows such as &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, &quot;Man About the House&quot;, &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Mike Yarwood Show&quot;.

==Career==
===Radio===
Levy was a disc jockey at Bradford&#x27;s Pennine Radio (now Hits Radio West Yorkshire) from its launch in 1975 – having been hired by the then television journalist and later Member of Parliament Austin Mitchell. He became a presenter at Liverpool&#x27;s Radio City in the 1970s, starting on the afternoon show before progressing to the drive time slot.

===Television===
He was then involved in local radio in the south of England before moving to Leeds to co-present &quot;BBC Look North&quot;.

He moved to Leeds-based Radio Aire, and then, in January 1987, to the BBC, eventually having a lunchtime show at BBC Radio Leeds. At this time he started as a regular stand-in presenter for the Leeds edition of &quot;Look North&quot;, always doing the breakfast bulletins. From between 1992 and 1993, Levy presented a BBC Two series entitled &quot;Famous Faces, Favourite Places&quot; in which he met well-known individuals who would revisit places of interest. During the programme he met individuals such as John Godber, Fred Trueman and Kathy Staff.

&quot;Look North&quot; was broadcast across the whole of the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire region at the time Levy started to work on it. He became the regular breakfast and lunchtime presenter of the programme in the mid-1990s. When the BBC split the region into two, Levy moved to present the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire edition from studios in Hull full-time from 11 November 2002.

In May 2005, a strike held by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) saw 15,000 journalists and technicians leave their posts. NUJ members in Kingston upon Hull estimated that a quarter of the 120-strong workforce, including &quot;Look North&quot; presenter Peter Levy, crossed the picket lines at the city&#x27;s BBC centre at Queen&#x27;s Court.

Levy works with weatherman Paul Hudson and they have visited shopping centres around the region and met the public as part of the &quot;2006 Look North Sofa Tour&quot;, this was repeated in 2009. The pair have made public appearances as part of a campaign in the East Riding of Yorkshire&#x27;s libraries concerning reading among the under 11s. 

He also appears on a regular basis in the ‘Nationwide’ segment on BBC News Channel&#x27;s ‘Afternoon Live’.

==Appearances==
Levy appeared in a 2003 &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; episode called &quot;The Man Who Invented Yorkshire Funny Stuff&quot;. He was also mentioned in episode 6 of series 1 of &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;. He has also appeared in the comedy show &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot;.

In 2012, Levy opened the Beverley Food Festival along with the Mayor of Beverley, Margaret Pinder; he is a supporter of the Driffield Show and other country events.

==Personal life==
Levy lives in Victoria Dock, Hull; he says &quot;Because it’s such a close community in Hull, you can&#x27;t really step out without being spotted. It is a little bit like being in a goldfish bowl. I&#x27;m a pretty shy person when it comes down to it, so it did take some getting used to, but the people of Hull are incredibly warm and friendly so it’s not really a chore.&quot; He is very protective of his adopted home, and once said live on air that the man who wrote the book &quot;Crap Towns&quot; (a book that had Hull as one of the &quot;crappest&quot;) was an idiot and everyone who had been to Hull knew it was a &quot;lovely city&quot;.

He regularly visits Cornwall, where his mother lives – it is here he indulges his love of bodyboarding and suggest he is &quot;probably the oldest surfer in town.&quot;

On 24 July 2024, Levy was presented with an honorary doctorate by Bishop Grosseteste University in Lincoln.

<text>Luigi &quot;Gigi&quot; Riva (; 7 November 1944 – 22 January 2024) was an Italian professional footballer who played as a striker.

Considered to be one of the best players of his generation, as well as one of the greatest strikers of all time, Riva enjoyed a remarkable scoring record for Cagliari, thanks to his composure in front of goal, powerful left foot and aerial ability; his speed, strength and eye for goal led the Italian journalist Gianni Brera to nickname him &quot;Rombo di Tuono&quot; (Roar of Thunder). Aside from his debut season with Legnano, Riva remained with the Sardinian club for his entire career: he helped Cagliari achieve promotion to the Italian top-flight for the first time in 1964, and later led the club to their only Serie A title in 1969–70.

At international level, Riva won the 1968 UEFA European Championship and was runner-up at the 1970 FIFA World Cup with the Italy national team; he also took part at the 1974 FIFA World Cup. With 35 goals in 42 appearances between 1965 and 1974, he is Italy&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer.

After retiring in 1976, Riva briefly served as the president of Cagliari during the 1986–87 season, and was later the team manager and director of the Italy national team from 1988 until 2013.

== Early life ==

Riva was born into a poor family in Leggiuno, a small town in the northern Italian province of Varese, Lombardy, near the Swiss border, on 7 November 1944. His mother, Edis, was a housewife, while his father, Ugo, worked several jobs, firstly as a hairdresser, then as a tailor, and subsequently in a factory, where he died in a work-related accident on 10 February 1953, when Luigi was nine. Edis began working as a maid, while Luigi was sent to a strict religious boarding school, where he remained for three years, before finding a job in a lift-factory and beginning to play football; his mother died soon afterwards.

== Club career ==

=== 1962–1964: early years, debut with Legnano, and promotion with Cagliari ===
Riva started playing amateur football for the Laveno Mombello youth side in Lombardy, scoring 30 goals in 1961 and 33 the following season. He began his professional career in 1962, at the age of 18, when he joined Serie C side Legnano-Ivrea, scoring 6 goals in 22 appearances in his debut season. The youngster&#x27;s promising performances attracted the attention of Cagliari president Enrico Rocca, and he was acquired by the Serie B side the following year for a notable sum of 37 million Lire, at the age of 19; Riva remained with the Sardinian team for the rest of his career. In his first season with the club, he scored 8 goals in 26 appearances and helped Cagliari to a second-place finish in the league behind Varese, which enabled the team to achieve promotion to the top-flight for the first time in their 40-year history.

=== 1964–1970: Serie A debut with Cagliari and road to the Serie A title ===
The following season, Riva made his Serie A debut for Cagliari on 13 September 1964, in a 2–1 loss against Roma, and also helped the club avoid relegation, leading the team to a comfortable sixth-place finish in the table, scoring an encouraging 9 goals in 32 appearances at the age of 20. This was followed by eleventh, sixth, and ninth place finishes in the league between 1965 and 1968, while Riva also finished as the league&#x27;s top scorer for the first time during the 1966–67 season with 18 goals, as the club began to build a potential title winning side around their star striker: Riva attracted several notable footballers to Cagliari, and the team during this period featured players such as Enrico Albertosi, Roberto Boninsegna, Ricciotti Greatti, Comunardo Niccolai, Mario Martiradonna, Mario Brugnera, Pierluigi Cera, and Nené. Riva subsequently helped Cagliari to a second-place finish in both the Coppa Italia, behind Roma, and the league, four points behind Fiorentina, during the 1968–69 season, winning the &quot;capocannoniere&quot; title for a second time with 20 goals in 29 appearances. Cagliari had been leading in the league until the 21st matchday, when a loss at home to Juventus caused the team to surrender their lead.

Following the arrival of fellow forwards Angelo Domenghini and Sergio Gori from Inter in the summer of 1969, in exchange for Boninsegna, Riva finally won his maiden career Serie A title with Cagliari during the 1969–70 season. Under the guidance of manager Manlio Scopigno and his offensive tactics, Riva led the team&#x27;s front line, scoring several decisive goals that ultimately helped the club win the championship. On 15 March 1970, with Cagliari having climbed to the top of the table with six league games remaining, Riva scored two goals to help Cagliari come back twice from behind in a 2–2 away draw against second placed Juventus. His second, equalising goal came from a penalty, with eight minutes remaining, and the result allowed Cagliari to maintain their lead over the Turin side in Serie A. Cagliari headed into April still in first place by three points, with three matches remaining; to clinch the &quot;Scudetto&quot;, Cagliari needed to win their next match at home against Bari, while Juventus, who were still in second place, needed to lose away against Lazio. On 12 April, Riva opened the scoring with a diving header in an eventual 2–0 win over Bari at the Stadio Amsicora, while Juventus suffered a 2–0 defeat to Lazio in Rome, with goals from Gian Piero Ghio and Giorgio Chinaglia. As a result, Cagliari were crowned Serie A champions for the first time in their history, with two games to spare, also sealing a place in the European Cup the following season. This was the first time a club south of Rome had won the league title. Riva once again finished the season as top scorer, with 21 goals. During this period, Riva&#x27;s skill, prolific goalscoring, and decisive performances in leading a small, provincial club like Cagliari from Serie B to the Serie A title, saw him become one of the best strikers in the world: he was the Serie A top scorer on three occasions, in 1966–67, in 1968–69 and in 1969–70, and he placed 2nd in the 1969 Ballon d&#x27;Or, behind compatriot Gianni Rivera, and 3rd in the 1970 Ballon d&#x27;Or, behind Gerd Müller and Bobby Moore.

=== 1970–1976: final years with Cagliari ===

Riva&#x27;s season immediately following Cagliari&#x27;s league triumph took off to a promising start: in the opening weeks of the season, he helped Cagliari to the top of the league table with a series of impressive results, including a 3–1 away win over Inter at the San Siro stadium on 29 October 1970, scoring twice, and earning his famous nickname &quot;Rombo di Tuono&quot; (Roar of Thunder) from journalist Gianni Brera as a result of his dominant performance. He also made his debut in the European Cup that season, helping Cagliari to the second round with two goals in a 3–0 home win against Saint-Étienne in the first leg of the first round of the competition. He later added a third goal in the tournament in the club&#x27;s 2–1 home victory over Atlético Madrid in the first leg of the second round. However, Riva&#x27;s season was ended prematurely by a serious injury which he endured in a European qualifying match with the Italy national team in late October. In his absence, Cagliari were soon eliminated from the European Cup in the round of 16, and dropped down the domestic table, eventually finishing in seventh place. After recovering from his injury, Riva managed 21 goals in 30 games during the 1971–72 season, finishing the season as the second highest goalscorer in the league, and helping Cagliari to a fourth-place finish and a spot in the next season&#x27;s UEFA Cup. With the departure of Scopigno, Cagliari&#x27;s results declined during the next two seasons, with the club only managing low mid-table finishes, although Riva&#x27;s goalscoring output still remained consistent, as he scored 12 goals during 1972–73 season, and 15 during the 1973–74 season. Despite having already established himself as a world class player, Cagliari struggled in the league during the mid 70s, Riva remained loyal to the Sardinian side, and turned down many bids from larger clubs, in particular from northern Italy. During his time with Cagliari, he demonstrated his attachment to the club when he refused several lucrative offers from Serie A giants Juventus to remain in the Sardinian capital, despite numerous rumours in the press which stated that he had already signed with the Turin side in exchange for large, record-breaking sums and several of their own players.

Despite his talent and goalscoring prowess, Riva&#x27;s career was blighted by several major injuries, in particular with the Italian national side, and which greatly limited his playing time in later seasons. He missed 35 games in the five seasons leading up to 1971, and only appeared in 24 matches for Cagliari between 1974 and 1976, which saw an overall decline to his goalscoring rate and the club&#x27;s performances during this period. During the 1974–75 season, a calf injury limited him to 8 appearances and 2 goals, and on 1 February 1976, while playing in a match for Cagliari against Milan, Riva ruptured a tendon and tore an adductor muscle in his right thigh, following a physical shoulder challenge near the corner flag from Aldo Bet, after being chased down by the Milan defender. He never successfully recovered and, despite several comeback attempts over the next year and a half, was eventually forced to retire in 1978, at the age of 33, having played his last game at the age of 31 in 1976. The injury limited Riva to only 15 appearances during the 1975–76 Serie A season. Despite his run of six goals in a span of eight games during the final season of his career, Cagliari finished in last place in the league in his absence, and were relegated to Serie B. Riva scored 248 goals for club and country throughout his career in 439 appearances, scoring 164 league goals with Cagliari in 315 appearances, 156 of which came in 289 Serie A appearances. Overall, he scored 207 goals in 374 appearances in all competitions during his thirteen seasons with Cagliari, and 213 career club goals in 397 appearances.

== International career ==
=== Early years and Euro 1968 champion ===
Following some impressive performances for the Italian youth side, Riva made his senior international debut with Italy at the age of 20, on 27 June 1965, in a 2–1 friendly defeat against Hungary, coming on for the injured Ezio Pascutti in the eighth minute. He was the first Cagliari player to be capped at senior international level. His international career was off to a difficult start, with his performance in his second appearance for Italy, a 0–0 friendly draw against France in Paris on 19 March 1966, criticised by noted journalist Gianni Brera, who initially described Riva as a &quot;one-footed&quot; and &quot;incomplete player&quot;. He was subsequently controversially excluded from the 22-man 1966 FIFA World Cup squad, although he was still brought to England by manager Edmondo Fabbri, along with Mario Bertini, as an additional reserve, to gain experience with the national side; Italy were eliminated in the first round of the tournament. After breaking both his left tibia and fibula in his third international appearance, a 1–1 friendly home draw against Portugal on 27 March 1967, Riva returned to the national team as a starter seven months later, and finally scored his first goal for Italy in his fourth international appearance, a 5–0 home win over Cyprus on 1 November 1967, in a UEFA Euro 1968 qualifying match, later completing a hat-trick in the same game. Riva was a member of the Italian side that won the 1968 European Championships on home soil under manager Ferruccio Valcareggi. After recovering from a leg injury, he returned to the starting line-up and scored the opening goal in the twelfth minute of the final replay in Rome on 10 June, which ended in a 2–0 victory over Yugoslavia; Riva was named to the Team of the Tournament for his performance during the match.

=== 1970 World Cup runner-up ===

On 22 November 1969, Riva scored a famous diving header in a 3–0 away win in a World Cup qualifying match against East Germany, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, which sealed Italy&#x27;s place at the 1970 World Cup. Prior to the tournament, he had scored 19 goals in only 16 matches. At the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, much was expected of Riva; however, he initially underperformed in the first round, failing to score in either of Italy&#x27;s three group matches, although both Riva and his strike-partner Angelo Domenghini saw their goals wrongly disallowed for offside in Italy&#x27;s final group match, a 0–0 draw against Israel on 11 June. Following his disappointing and goalless performances in the group stage, and much media criticism and scrutiny, Riva finally opened his account in the World Cup in the second round. On 14 June, he helped Italy defeat the hosts Mexico 4–1 in the quarter-finals, scoring two goals, both from Gianni Rivera assists, forming a notable offensive partnership with the Milan playmaker in the knock-out rounds of the competition. Riva subsequently netted a crucial extra-time goal – his 22nd in 21 international appearances – against West Germany in Italy&#x27;s 4–3 semi-final victory on 17 June, which is colloquially known as the &quot;Game of the Century&quot;. The Italian team finished runners up in the tournament after losing 4–1 to Brazil in the final. Riva finished the competition as Italy&#x27;s top-scorer, with three goals. After the tournament, Riva broke his right leg while on international duty in a European qualifying match later that year. He was forced off in the 76th minute of a 2–1 away win against Austria on 31 October, at the Praterstadion, in Vienna, following a hard challenge from Austrian defender Norbert Hof.

=== Later years, Italy&#x27;s all-time goalscorer and 1974 World Cup ===
On 31 March 1973, Riva scored four goals in a 5–0 home win over Luxembourg, in a World Cup qualifying match, becoming one of only six players to accomplish this feat with the Italy national side. On 9 June, he became Italy&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer, equalling the record of 33 goals held by Giuseppe Meazza, scoring in a 2–0 friendly against Brazil in Rome; Meazza reportedly stated after the match &quot;That Riva is good, he scored a lot of goals against Cyprus and Turkey. Surely my goals were much more important.&quot;

Riva later surpassed Meazza&#x27;s record with his 34th international goal in a 2–0 home win in a friendly against Sweden on 29 September 1973, and scored his final and 35th goal for Italy later that year, on 20 October, in a 2–0 home win over Switzerland in a World Cup qualifying match. Despite his initial dominance for Italy, Riva&#x27;s struggles with injuries subsequently saw him display a series of disappointing performances at the 1974 World Cup in West Germany, along with many other members of the Italian squad, which led him to be dropped for the last group game against Poland, which saw Italy eliminated in the first round of the tournament following a 2–1 defeat; he made his 42nd and final appearance for Italy at the age of 29, in Italy&#x27;s second group match of the tournament, a 1–1 draw against Argentina, on 19 June. Riva is currently still Italy&#x27;s top-goalscorer of all time, with 35 goals in just 42 matches, with an average of 0.83 goals per game. In addition to being Italy&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer, Riva is also the highest goalscorer in combined goals scored at the FIFA World Cup and FIFA World Cup qualifier matches with 17 goals, and Italy&#x27;s highest goalscorer in FIFA World Cup qualifiers, with 14 goals. Furthermore, alongside Silvio Piola, he co-holds the national team&#x27;s record for most goals on opposition soil with 13.

== After retirement and death ==

After retiring, Riva remained in Cagliari, and founded the first school of football in Sardinia in 1976, which bears his name. He later became an executive with his former club; he also briefly served as Cagliari&#x27;s president during the 1986–87 season, but stepped down from this position in December 1986, after only a few months, and was replaced by Lucio Cordeddu. He later served as a director and subsequently as a team managing staff member for the Italy national football team from 1988 until 2013, and was also a member of the technical staff for the Italy national team that won the 2006 FIFA World Cup under his supervision; he drew praise from captain Fabio Cannavaro for his role in Italy&#x27;s fourth World Cup title victory.

On 5 January 2005, Cagliari retired Riva&#x27;s number 11 jersey to honour him and his achievements with the club; Rocco Sabato, the last holder of the number 11 shirt, presented Riva with his jersey in the official ceremony held at the Stadio Sant&#x27;Elia of Cagliari, ahead of Italy&#x27;s friendly match against Russia. Riva&#x27;s jersey was the first to be retired by the Sardinian club.

On 21 January 2024, Riva was hospitalized at the San Michele Hospital in Cagliari due to acute coronary syndrome; according to the medical staff assisting him, he was initially in a stable condition and was offered to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention, a decision he opted to delay. In the evening of the following day, however, Riva&#x27;s health condition suddenly deteriorated, and he eventually died of a heart attack, at the age of 79.

== Style of play ==
Regarded as one of Italy&#x27;s greatest players, and as one of the best strikers of his generation, Riva was a well rounded, brave, prolific, and opportunistic forward, with an astonishing finishing skill; due to his dominance and skill, he is considered by some in the sport to be Italy&#x27;s greatest player ever. He was initially deployed as a winger on the left flank early in his career, although he would often cut into the centre of the pitch in order to strike on goal; as a result, he was later played in a more offensive and central role, as a main striker, where he excelled, due to his eye for goal. A naturally left footed player, he had a very powerful and accurate shot from both inside and outside the area, which led Gianni Brera to nickname him &quot;Rombo di Tuono&quot; (Roar of Thunder); although he was predominantly left-footed, he was also capable of scoring with his right foot on occasion.
Due to his height, powerful physique, elevation, and his heading accuracy, Riva excelled in the air, and he also had a penchant for scoring spectacular, acrobatic goals from bicycle kicks, courtesy of his athleticism and volleying ability. Despite his tall build and strong physical attributes, he also possessed excellent technical ability, creativity, and good dribbling skills, as well as a very delicate first touch and notable elegance on the ball. In addition to his goalscoring prowess and technique, he was also an extremely fit, hard-working, and fast player, with notable stamina, who excelled during sprints and at making attacking runs. He was also an accurate free-kick and penalty kick taker. Despite his ability, his career was often marked by injuries, which later affected his mobility, continuity, and fitness, and eventually forced him to retire prematurely.

== Personal life ==
Riva had a partner, Gianna Tofanari and two sons. He considered himself Roman Catholic.

<doc id="1110924" wikidata="Q7077816" url="?curid=1110924" title="Odin Computer Graphics">
<text>Odin Computer Graphics were a Liverpool-based computer games developer who came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a variety of titles for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers.

==History==
Odin consisted of Managing Director Paul McKenna; programmers Steve Wetherill, Robbie Tinman, Marc Dawson (now Wilding), Keith Robinson, George Barnes, Tommy Laningan, Derrick Rowson, and Stefan Walker; artists Paul Salmon, Stuart Fotheringham, and Colin Grunes; and musician Keith Tinman. Bernie Duggs and musician Fred Gray are also credited. Fotheringham and Dawson had previously worked for Software Projects. Some other staff members had previously worked for Imagine Software.

Prior to the release of their debut title, &quot;Nodes of Yesod&quot;, in 1985, Odin had previously released a number of games under the name Thor. Although they developed a couple of in-house titles as Thor, they mainly acquired the publishing rights to homegrown titles from anonymous bedroom programmers. These early titles were mostly regarded as critical disappointments but not commercial failures. When Thor decided to switch to in-house development, Paul McKenna (managing director &amp; owner) thought it appropriate to form a new company, hence Odin Computer Graphics was born.

&quot;Nodes of Yesod&quot; became an instant critical and commercial success, prompting Telecomsoft (the software division of British Telecom) to offer them a six-figure contract to develop ten games within a 12-month period. While Odin&#x27;s later games (including &quot;Robin of the Wood&quot; and &quot;Heartland&quot;) were very well received, some later titles failed to live up to expected BT standards. During this period, the warehouse area attached to the Odin studio was used by Telecomsoft as a distribution warehouse and to store thousands of copies of games on their Firebird, Rainbird and Beyond labels.

Just prior to the Telecom deal Odin had secured a major contract with Capcom. They were to develop &quot;Robin Hood&quot; for coin-operated arcade machines and Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Gun.Smoke&quot; for the home computer format. Unfortunately the contracts arrived a day late. Paul McKenna still has the original contracts from Capcom in his possession.

Odin made a very deliberate attempt to ensure they were mistaken for Ultimate Play the Game, one of the most critically acclaimed game developers of the 1980s. As well as establishing a very similar name (Odin Computer Graphics vs. Ashby Computer Graphics), many of their games were heavily inspired by Ultimate&#x27;s output (Odin&#x27;s &quot;Nodes of Yesod&quot; certainly owes a considerable debt to Ultimate&#x27;s &quot;Underwurlde&quot;). The advertisements for Odin&#x27;s games, which won many acclaimed awards such as Golden Joystick Awards for best advertising in 1985 and 1986, were reminiscent of 1980s popular print retailer Athena and also bore some resemblance to the highly stylised, airbrushed artwork that graced the adverts for Ultimate&#x27;s games.

In 1987, Odin finally closed their doors, mainly due to an inability to expand the size of their teams while maintaining the quality that had put the company on the map in the first place. Although they delivered more than all the necessary titles to fulfill their contract, Telecomsoft deemed several of them to be not worthy of release. By this time many of Odin&#x27;s core programmers and artists had already jumped ship. Several ex-Odin staff initially joined Denton Designs, another Liverpool-based games developer, before going their separate ways.

In 2005, Paul McKenna reformed Odin Computer Graphics Ltd, to develop and produce new titles and convert &quot;Nodes of Yesod&quot;, &quot;Arc of Yesod&quot;, &quot;Heartland&quot; and &quot;Robin of the Wood&quot; on the Mobile Phone formats.

In 2010, Odin Computer Graphics, Ltd., in conjunction with Uztek Games, Inc., released &quot;Nodes of Yesod&quot; for the iPhone. A web browser version built with Adobe Flash was also released in the same year.

<text>Socialist German Workers Youth (, abbreviated SDAJ) is a political youth organization in Germany. It is a Marxist–Leninist organization and related to the Deutsche Kommunistische Partei (German Communist Party). SDAJ is a member of World Federation of Democratic Youth.

== History ==
=== 1968–1977 ===
SDAJ was formed on May 5, 1968, the 150th birthday of Karl Marx. The SDAJ participated in social movements that arose from the 1968&#x27;s student movement. It became one of the leading left-wing youth organizations in West Germany and enjoyed a high political profile – for example, in actions against fare increases (&quot;Red Dot Actions&quot;). The SDAJ claimed over 35,000 members.

=== 1978–1987 ===
From 1978 to 1988, the SDAJ organized the Festival of Youth biannually together with the Marxist Student Association Spartacus (MSB). The Festival was held mid-May on the grounds of the Dortmund exhibition. Internationally known artists attended. For example, the 1978 festival included figures such as Jutta Weinhold, Snowball, Udo Lindenberg, Puhdys and the Titi Winterstein Quintet. Political debates were a common feature. According to the SDAJ, more than 100,000 visitors attended.

Until the fall of the GDR, the SDAJ maintained contact with Free German Youth (FDJ), a sibling organization.

In the 1980s, the SDAJ played a major role in the West German peace movement.

=== 1988–1997 ===
In 1988, conflicts emerged in SDAJ and DKP as reformist tendencies gained strength. At the SDAJ Federal Congress of 1989 the organization split, as the majority of the delegates voted for a proposal that would keep the SDAJ as a Marxist working class youth organization. The defeated faction grouped around then national chairman Birgit Radow and left the Congress. The Radow group failed to create a nationwide organization. Many former leading members switched to the youth structures of the PDS.

The fall of the GDR and the reunification of Germany, produced a crisis in SDAJ and DKP. Funding from GDR was discontinued and employees were laid off. Until about 1993, the SDAJ remained virtually without functioning central coordination. In 1994 the reorganization and reactivation of district and local associations began. As of the late 1990s local groups stabilized and new groups established in areas including Leipzig, Dresden, Gera, Potsdam, Rostock, Gadebusch and Berlin.

=== 1998–present===
Due to the slight increase in membership, the bi-annual Festival of Youth was refounded in 2008 in Jugendpark of Cologne.

In October 2011, the SDAJ held its 20th national congress of Hanover, Lower Saxony.

<text>3 Car Garage: The Indie Recordings &#x27;95–&#x27;96, also known simply as 3 Car Garage, is a compilation album by American pop rock group Hanson. It consists of material from their &quot;MMMBop&quot; demo album minus four tracks. There is much confusion that &quot;3 Car Garage&quot; contains tracks from both the &quot;MMMBop&quot; and &quot;Boomerang&quot; demo albums, when actually, only songs from &quot;MMMBop&quot; are present. The tracks that never made it from &quot;MMMBop&quot; to &quot;3 Car Garage&quot; are the shorter version of &quot;MMMBop&quot;, &quot;Something New&quot;, &quot;Incredible&quot;, and &quot;Baby (You&#x27;re So Fine)&quot;.

As the songs on this album were recorded a year or two before &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;, the brothers&#x27; voices are noticeably higher pitched. The album also contains the original version of the hit song &quot;MMMBop&quot;, which was a rock ballad, unlike the up-tempo pop version that became a hit. 3 Car Garage: The Indie Recordings is the only Hanson compilation not on streaming platforms.

<doc id="1110934" wikidata="Q535415" url="?curid=1110934" title="Fernando Ortiz Fernández">
<text>Fernando Ortiz Fernández (16 July 1881 – 10 April 1969) was a Cuban essayist, anthropologist, ethnomusicologist and scholar of Afro-Cuban culture. Ortiz was a prolific polymath dedicated to exploring, recording, and understanding all aspects of indigenous Cuban culture.Ortiz has been called the &quot;third discoverer of Cuba&quot;, after Christopher Columbus and Alexander von Humboldt. A title first given to him by his secretary Rubén Martínez Villena and later echoed and published by Juan Marinello. Ortiz is widely recognized as a pioneering figure in postcolonial Latin American thought, as well as a foundational voice in African American anthropology. One of Ortiz&#x27;s most influential contributions is his coining of the term &quot;transculturation,&quot; which describes the complex process of cultural convergence and exchange.

== Early life and education ==
Ortiz was born in Havana. He was son of Don Rosendo Ortiz y Zorrilla and Doña Josefa Fernández y González del Real.

When he was two years old he moved with her mother to Menorca where he spent most of his youth. He also completed his primary and secondary studies and obtained his high school diploma in 1895. That year, he relocated to Havana where he began studying law. Four years later, in 1899, he returned to Spain, this time to Barcelona, where he completed his studies and earned a law degree at the University of Barcelona in 1900. In 1901 he received his title of Doctor of Law at the Central University of Madrid with a thesis on penal law that was later published in the journal &quot;Derecho y Sociología.&quot; In 1902 he returned to Habana and received the title of Doctor of Civil Law and Doctor of Public Law. 

== Career ==
Disillusioned with politics in the early period of Cuban history and having been a member of President Gerardo Machado&#x27;s Liberal Party, and a Liberal member of its House of Representatives from 1917 to 1922, he became active in the early nationalist civic revival movement.

Throughout his life Ortiz was involved in the foundation of institutions dedicated to the study of Cuban culture. In 1907 he became member of Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País de Cuba (Economic Societies of Friends of the Country), the he eventually led in 1923. He was the cofounder of the Cuban Academy of the Language in 1926 and the cofounder of the Sociedad de Folklore Cubano (1928). In 1937 he founded the Sociedad de Estudios Afrocubanos (Society of Afro-Cuban Studies) and the journal &quot;Estudios Afrocubanos&quot; (&quot;Afro-Cuban Studies&quot;). He was president of the History Academia of Cuba and the Cuban-Soviet Institute (1945).

He was also the founder and director of the &quot;Instituto Internacional de Estudios Afroamericanos&quot; (International Institute for the Study of Afroamericans), an institute dedicated to promoting scientific research on Afro-descended populations in the Americas, focusing on their biological and cultural aspects. The institute organized conferences, conducted studies, and served as a hub for the dissemination of research and collaboration among scholars and institutions. He later invited American anthropologist and sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois to join the institute, along with other renowned anthropologists like Melville Herskovits. 

Ortiz also dedicated a significant part of his life to founding, editing, and contributing to academic journals. He resumed the publication of &quot;Revista Bimestre Cubana&quot; in 1910, serving as its director until 1959, the year the Cuban Revolution began. He also edited &quot;Revista de administración teórica y práctica del Estado, la provincia y el municipio&quot; (1912) and &quot;Boletín de Legislación&quot; (1929). In 1924, he founded &quot;Revista Archivos del Folklore Cubano&quot;. Additionally, he was the founder and editor of &quot;Surco&quot; (1930–1931) and &quot;Ultra&quot; (1936–1947), both journals that provided commentary on international publications.

Ortiz was professor of African American anthropologist Irene Diggs when she was doing her PhD in anthropology at University of Havana. 

Ortiz published articles in several prominent journals, including &quot;The Hispanic American Historical Review&quot;, &quot;Revista Científica Internacional&quot;, &quot;Revista de Administración&quot;, &quot;Revista de Arqueología y Etnología&quot;, and &quot;Revista de La Habana&quot;. He also helped establish important journals such as &quot;Revista Bimestre Cubana&quot;, &quot;Archivos del Folklore Cubano&quot;, and &quot;Estudios Afrocubanos&quot;.

Ortiz also developed a theory of activism within Cuba&#x27;s political system. He said that Afro-Cubans had been characterized negatively based on their African descent, and traits said to be &quot;primitive.&quot; He wanted to show the true nature of their culture: its language, music and other arts.

His books, &quot;La Africania de la Musica Folklorica de Cuba&quot; (1950), and &quot;Los Instrumentos de la Musica Afrocubana&quot; (1952 - 1955) are still regarded as key references in the study of Afro-Cuban music.

In his second marriage, Fernando Ortiz married María Herrera (1942), who remained by his side for the rest of his life. María was a close collaborator in Ortiz&#x27;s work.
Fernando Ortiz died in Havana in 1969 and was interred there in the Colon Cemetery.

== Cuban Counterpoints and the concept of Transculturation ==
Fernando Ortiz most known and read book was &quot;Cuban Counterpoint: Tobacco and Sugar&quot; originally published in 1940 in Spanish and translated to English in 1995. In his book he draws comparisons between sugar and tabaco the most relevant products form Cuba that have entered the daily life of cubans.

In this work, he proposes the concept of transculturation as a phenomenon that is more appropriate than acculturation to describe how cultures converge and merge, without removing some of the original aspects of the original cultures. The concept provided a more appropriate way to explain the merging of cultures in Cuba, from Spanish colonialism to Indigenous communities and Afro-Cubans, resulting in a new culture that incorporates elements from each. In the introduction of the book the renowned Polish anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski (1884-1942) wrote the introduction supporting Ortiz&#x27;s concept His correspondence with Bronisław Malinowski shows they had numerous debates around the concept of transculturation and how it was being received within American anthropology. This led to disputes between Oritz and Melville Herskovits the American anthropologist that coined the term acculturation. The concept of &quot;transculturation&quot; that Ortiz developed resonates with the principles of British functionalism, which Malinowski himself helped pioneer. 

Malinowski was not only a personal friend but also an admirer of Ortiz&#x27;s work. The letters published between Malinowski and Ortiz as part of a 2002 edition of Cuban Counterpoints, by Enrico Mario Santí, show that Malinowski commented the structure of the book, proposed ideas and concepts that influenced the book. 

== Legacy and honors ==
After Ortiz&#x27;s death the government established the Fernando Ortiz Foundation, on September 1995. Its main objectives are the study and dissemination of the life and work of Fernando Ortiz, as well as the development of academic research on Cuban cultural identity. It has also published images, documents and reprints of Ortiz&#x27;s work and devoted itself to studies of ethnology, sociology and Cuba&#x27;s popular traditions. Since 1995 it has been led by one of his prominent students, Miguel Barnet, known for his development of the testimonial style in ethnographic studies. The Foundation has fostered scholarly discussions around many cultural issues, including the survival of elements of racism and racial prejudice, and development of measures to deal with such problems.

<doc id="1110936" wikidata="Q901332" url="?curid=1110936" title="Photoelectrochemical cell">
<text>A &quot;photoelectrochemical cell&quot; is one of two distinct classes of device. The first produces electrical energy similarly to a dye-sensitized photovoltaic cell, which meets the standard definition of a photovoltaic cell. The second is a photoelectrolytic cell, that is, a device which uses light incident on a photosensitizer, semiconductor, or aqueous metal immersed in an electrolytic solution to directly cause a chemical reaction, for example to produce hydrogen via the electrolysis of water.
Both types of device are varieties of solar cell, in that a photoelectrochemical cell&#x27;s function is to use the photoelectric effect (or, very similarly, the photovoltaic effect) to convert electromagnetic radiation (typically sunlight) either directly into electrical power, or into something which can itself be easily used to produce electrical power (hydrogen, for example, can be burned to create electrical power, see photohydrogen).

== Two principles ==

The standard photovoltaic effect, as operating in standard photovoltaic cells, involves the excitation of negative charge carriers (electrons) within a semiconductor medium, and it is negative charge carriers (free electrons) which are ultimately extracted to produce power. The classification of photoelectrochemical cells which includes Grätzel cells meets this narrow definition, albeit the charge carriers are often excitonic.

The situation within a photoelectrolytic cell, on the other hand, is quite different. For example, in a water-splitting photoelectrochemical cell, the excitation, by light, of an electron in a semiconductor leaves a hole which &quot;draws&quot; an electron from a neighboring water molecule:

:::::::::::::&lt;chem&gt;H2O(l) + [hv] + 2h+ -&gt; 2H+ (aq) + 1/2O2(g)&lt;/chem&gt;

This leaves positive charge carriers (protons, that is, H+ ions) in solution, which must then bond with one other proton and combine with two electrons in order to form hydrogen gas, according to:
:::::::::::::&lt;chem&gt;2H+ + 2e- -&gt; H2(g)&lt;/chem&gt;

A photosynthetic cell is another form of photoelectrolytic cell, with the output in that case being carbohydrates instead of molecular hydrogen.

== Photoelectrolytic cell ==

A (water-splitting) photoelectrolytic cell electrolizes water into hydrogen and oxygen gas by irradiating the anode with electromagnetic radiation, that is, with light. This has been referred to as artificial photosynthesis and has been suggested as a way of storing solar energy in hydrogen for use as fuel.

Incoming sunlight excites free electrons near the surface of the silicon electrode. These electrons flow through wires to the stainless steel electrode, where four of them react with four water molecules to form two molecules of hydrogen and 4 OH groups. The OH groups flow through the liquid electrolyte to the surface of the silicon electrode. There they react with the four holes associated with the four photoelectrons, the result being two water molecules and an oxygen molecule. Illuminated silicon immediately begins to corrode under contact with the electrolytes. The corrosion consumes material and disrupts the properties of the surfaces and interfaces within the cell.

Two types of photochemical systems operate via photocatalysis. One uses semiconductor surfaces as catalysts. In these devices the semiconductor surface absorbs solar energy and acts as an electrode for water splitting. The other methodology uses in-solution metal complexes as catalysts.

Photoelectrolytic cells have passed the 10 percent economic efficiency barrier. Corrosion of the semiconductors remains an issue, given their direct contact with water. Research is now ongoing to reach a service life of 10000 hours, a requirement established by the United States Department of Energy.

== Other photoelectrochemical cells ==

The first photovoltaic cell ever designed was also the first photoelectrochemical cell. It was created in 1839, by Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel, at age 19, in his father&#x27;s laboratory.

The mostly commonly researched modern photoelectrochemical cell in recent decades has been the Grätzel cell, although much attention has recently shifted away from this topic to perovskite solar cells, due to relatively high efficiency of the latter and the similarity in vapor assisted deposition techniques commonly used in their creation.

Dye-sensitized solar cells or Grätzel cells use dye-adsorbed highly porous nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (nc-) to produce electrical energy.

== Materials for photoelectrolytic cells==

Water-splitting photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells use light energy to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen within a two-electrode cell. In theory, three arrangements of photo-electrodes in the assembly of PECs exist:

* photo-anode made of a n-type semiconductor and a metal cathode
* photo-anode made of a n-type semiconductor and a photo-cathode made of a p-type semiconductor
* photo-cathode made of a p-type semiconductor and a metal anode

There are several requirements for photoelectrode materials in PEC &lt;chem&gt;H2&lt;/chem&gt; production:
* light absorbance: determined by band gap and appropriate for solar irradiation spectrum
* charge transport: photoelectrodes must be conductive (or semi-conductive) to minimize resistive losses
* suitable band structure: large enough band gap to split water (1.23V) and appropriate positions relative to redox potentials for &lt;chem&gt;H2&lt;/chem&gt; and &lt;chem&gt;O2&lt;/chem&gt;
* catalytic activity: high catalytic activity increases efficiency of the water-splitting reaction
* stability: materials must be stable to prevent decomposition and loss of function

In addition to these requirements, materials must be low-cost and earth abundant for the widespread adoption of PEC water splitting to be feasible.

While the listed requirements can be applied generally, photoanodes and photocathodes have slightly different needs. A good photocathode will have early onset of the oxygen evolution reaction (low overpotential), a large photocurrent at saturation, and rapid growth of photocurrent upon onset. Good photoanodes, on the other hand, will have early onset of the hydrogen evolution reaction in addition to high current and rapid photocurrent growth. To maximize current, anode and cathode materials need to be matched together; the best anode for one cathode material may not be the best for another.
In 1967, Akira Fujishima discovered the Honda-Fujishima effect, (the photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide).

 and other metal oxides are still most prominent catalysts for efficiency reasons. Including  and , this kind of semiconducting titanates, the conduction band has mainly titanium 3d character and the valence band oxygen 2p character. The bands are separated by a wide band gap of at least 3 eV, so that these materials absorb only UV radiation.

Change of the microstructure has also been investigated to further improve the performance. In 2002, Guerra (Nanoptek Corporation) discovered that high localized strain could be induced in semiconductor films formed on micro to nano-structured templates, and that this strain shifted the bandgap of the semiconductor, in the case of titanium dioxide, into the visible blue. It was further found (Thulin and Guerra, 2008) that the strain also favorably shifted the band-edges to overlay the hydrogen evolution potential, and further still that the strain improved hole mobility, for lower charge recombination rate and high quantum efficiency. Chandekar developed a low-cost scalable manufacturing process to produce both the nano-structured template and the strained titanium dioxide coating. Other morphological investigations include nanowire arrays or porous nanocrystalline photoelectrochemical cells.

===GaN===
GaN is another option, because metal nitrides usually have a narrow band gap that could encompass almost the entire solar spectrum. GaN has a narrower band gap than but is still large enough to allow water splitting to occur at the surface. GaN nanowires exhibited better performance than GaN thin films, because they have a larger surface area and have a high single crystallinity which allows longer electron-hole pair lifetimes. Meanwhile, other non-oxide semiconductors such as GaAs, , and are used as n-type electrode, due to their stability in chemical and electrochemical steps in the photocorrosion reactions.

=== Silicon ===
In 2013 a cell with 2 nanometers of nickel on a silicon electrode, paired with a stainless steel electrode, immersed in an aqueous electrolyte of potassium borate and lithium borate operated for 80 hours without noticeable corrosion, versus 8 hours for titanium dioxide. In the process, about 150 ml of hydrogen gas was generated, representing the storage of about 2 kilojoules of energy.

===Structured materials===
Structuring of absorbing materials has both positive and negative affects on cell performance. Structuring allows for light absorption and carrier collection to occur in different places, which loosens the requirements for pure materials and helps with catalysis. This allows for the use of non-precious and oxide catalysts that may be stable in more oxidizing conditions. However, these devices have lower open-circuit potentials which may contribute to lower performance.

====Hematite====

Researchers have extensively investigated the use of hematite (α-Fe2O3) in PEC water-splitting devices due to its low cost, ability to be n-type doped, and band gap (2.2eV). However, performance is plagued by poor conductivity and crystal anisotropy. Some researchers have enhanced catalytic activity by forming a layer of co-catalysts on the surface. Co-catalysts include cobalt-phosphate and iridium oxide, which is known to be a highly active catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction.

====Tungsten oxide====
Tungsten(VI) oxide (WO3), which exhibits several different polymorphs at various temperatures, is of interest due to its high conductivity but has a relatively wide, indirect band gap (~2.7 eV) which means it cannot absorb most of the solar spectrum. Though many attempts have been made to increase absorption, they result in poor conductivity and thus WO3 does not appear to be a viable material for PEC water splitting.

====Bismuth vanadate====
With a narrower, direct band gap (2.4 eV) and proper band alignment with water oxidation potential, the monoclinic form of  has garnered interest from researchers. Over time, it has been shown that V-rich and compact films are associated with higher photocurrent, or higher performance. Bismuth Vanadate has also been studied for solar &lt;chem&gt;H2&lt;/chem&gt; generation from seawater, which is much more difficult due to the presence of contaminating ions and a more harsh corrosive environment.

==Oxidation form==
Photoelectrochemical oxidation (PECO) is the process by which light enables a semiconductor to promote a catalytic oxidation reaction. While a photoelectrochemical cell typically involves both a semiconductor (electrode) and a metal (counter-electrode), at sufficiently small scales, pure semiconductor particles can behave as microscopic photoelectrochemical cells. PECO has applications in the detoxification of air and water, hydrogen production, and other applications.

===Reaction mechanism===
The process by which a photon initiates a chemical reaction directly is known as photolysis; if this process is aided by a catalyst, it is called photocatalysis. If a photon has more energy than a material&#x27;s characteristic band gap, it can free an electron upon absorption by the material. The remaining, positively charged hole and the free electron may recombine, generating heat, or they can take part in photoreactions with nearby species. If the photoreactions with these species result in regeneration of the electron-donating material—i.e., if the material acts as a catalyst for the reactions—then the reactions are deemed photocatalytic. PECO represents a type of photocatalysis whereby semiconductor-based electrochemistry catalyzes an oxidation reaction—for example, the oxidative degradation of an airborne contaminant in air purification systems.

The principal objective of photoelectrocatalysis is to provide low-energy activation pathways for the passage of electronic charge carriers through the electrode electrolyte interface and, in particular, for the photoelectrochemical generation of chemical products. With regard to photoelectrochemical oxidation, we may consider, for example, the following system of reactions, which constitute TiO2-catalyzed oxidation.
:TiO2 (hv) → TiO2 (e− + h+)
:TiO2(h+) +RX → TiO2 + RX.+
:TiO2(h+) + H2O → TiO2 + HO. + H+
:TiO2(h+) + OH− → TiO2 + HO.
:TiO2(e−) + O2 → TiO2 + O2.−

This system shows a number of pathways for the production of oxidative species that facilitate the oxidation of the species, RX, in addition to its direct oxidation by the excited TiO2 itself. PECO concerns such a process where the electronic charge carriers are able to readily move through the reaction medium, thereby to some extent mitigating recombination reactions that would limit the oxidative process. The “photoelectrochemical cell” in this case could be as simple as a very small particle of the semiconductor catalyst. Here, on the “light” side a species is oxidized, while on the “dark” side a separate species is reduced.

===Photochemical oxidation (PCO) versus PECO===
The classical macroscopic photoelectrochemical system consists of a semiconductor in electric contact with a counter-electrode. For N-type semiconductor particles of sufficiently small dimension, the particles polarize into anodic and cathodic regions, effectively forming microscopic photoelectrochemical cells. The illuminated surface of a particle catalyzes a photooxidation reaction, while the “dark” side of the particle facilitates a concomitant reduction.

Photoelectrochemical oxidation may be thought of as a special case of photochemical oxidation (PCO). Photochemical oxidation entails the generation of radical species that enable oxidation reactions, with or without the electrochemical interactions involved in semiconductor-catalyzed systems, which occur in photoelectrochemical oxidation.

=== Applications ===
PECO may be useful in treating both air and water, as well as producing hydrogen as a source of renewable energy.

==== Water Treatment ====
PECO has shown promise for water treatment of both stormwater and wastewater. Currently, water treatment methods like the use of biofiltration technologies are widely used. These technologies are effective at filtering out pollutants like suspended solids, nutrients, and heavy metals, but struggle to remove herbicides. Herbicides like diuron and atrazine are commonly used, and often end up in stormwater, posing potential health risks if they are not treated before reuse. 

PECO is a useful solution to treating stormwater because of its strong oxidation capacity. Investigating different mechanisms for herbicide degradation in stormwater, like PECO, photocatalytic oxidation (PCO), and electro-catalytic oxidation (ECO), researchers determined that PECO was the best option, demonstrating complete mineralization of diuron in one hour. Further research into this use for PECO is needed, as it was only able to degrade 35% of atrazine in that time, however it is a promising solution moving forward.

==== Air Treatment ====
PECO has also shown promise as a means of air purification. For people with severe allergies, air purifiers are important to protect them from allergens within their own homes. However, some allergens are too small to be removed by normal purification methods. Air purifiers using PECO filters are able to remove particles as small as 0.1 nm.

These filters work as photons excite a photocatalyst, creating hydroxyl free radicals, which are extremely reactive and oxidize organic material and microorganisms that cause allergy symptoms, forming harmless products like carbon dioxide and water. Researchers testing this technology with patients suffering from allergies drew promising conclusions from their studies, observing significant reductions in total symptom scores (TSS) for both nasal (TNSS) and ocular (TOSS) allergies after just 4 weeks of using the PECO filter. This research demonstrates strong potential for impactful health improvements who suffer from severe allergies and asthma.

==== Hydrogen Production ====
Possibly the most exciting potential use for PECO is producing hydrogen to be used as a source of renewable energy. Photoelectrochemical oxidation reactions that take place within PEC cells are the key to water splitting for hydrogen production. While the main concern with this technology is stability, systems that use PECO technology to create hydrogen from vapor rather than liquid water has demonstrated potential for greater stability. Early researchers working on vapor fed systems developed modules with 14% solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency, while remaining stable for 1000+ hours. More recently, further technological developments have been made, demonstrated by the direct air electrolysis (DAE) module developed by Jining Guo and his team, which produces 99% pure hydrogen from the air and has demonstrated stability of 8 months thus far. 

Promising research and technological advancement using PECO for different applications like water and air treatment and hydrogen production suggests that it is a valuable tool that can be utilized in a variety of ways.

===History===
In 1938, Goodeve and Kitchener demonstrated the “photosensitization” of TiO2—e.g., as evidenced by the fading of paints incorporating it as a pigment. In 1969, Kinney and Ivanuski suggested that a variety of metal oxides, including TiO2, may catalyze the oxidation of dissolved organic materials (phenol, benzoic acid, acetic acid, sodium stearate, and sucrose) under illumination by sunlamps. Additional work by Carey et al. suggested that TiO2 may be useful for the photodechlorination of PCBs.

<text>The Jnanpith Award is the oldest and the highest Indian literary award presented annually by the Bharatiya Jnanpith to an author for their &quot;outstanding contribution towards literature&quot;. Instituted in 1961, the award is bestowed only on Indian writers writing in Indian languages included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India and English, with no posthumous conferral.

From 1965 till 1981, the award was given to the authors for their &quot;most outstanding work&quot; and consisted of a citation plaque, a cash prize and a bronze replica of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of knowledge and wisdom. The first recipient of the award was the Malayalam writer G. Sankara Kurup who received the award in 1965 for his collection of poems, Odakkuzhal (&quot;The Bamboo Flute&quot;), published in 1950. The rules were revised in subsequent years to consider only works published during the preceding twenty years, excluding the year for which the award was to be given and the cash prize was increased to from 1981.

, the cash prize has been revised to and out of twenty-three eligible languages the award has been presented for works in sixteen languages: Hindi (eleven), Kannada (eight), Bengali and Malayalam (six each), Urdu (five) Gujarati, Marathi, Odia (four each), Assamese and Telugu (three each), Punjabi, Tamil, Konkani and Sanskrit (two each), English and Kashmiri (one each). The award has been conferred upon fifty-eight writers including eight women authors. In 1976, Bengali novelist Ashapoorna Devi became the first woman to win the award and was honoured for the 1965 novel &quot;Prothom Protishruti&quot; (&quot;The First Promise&quot;), the first in a trilogy. The most recent recipients of the award are Sanskrit scholar Rambhadracharya and Urdu writer, Bollywood lyricist Gulzar jointly awarded for the year of 2023.

==Background==

The Bharatiya Jnanpith, a research and cultural institute founded in 1944 by industrialist Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain of the Sahu Jain family, conceived an idea in May 1961 to start a scheme &quot;commanding national prestige and of international standard&quot; to &quot;select the best book out of the publications in Indian languages&quot;. Later in November, Rama Jain, the Founder President of the Bharatiya Jnanpith, invited a few literary experts to discuss various aspects of the scheme. Jain along with Kaka Kalelkar, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, Jainendra Kumar, Jagdish Chandra Mathur, Prabhakar Machwe, Akshaya Kumar Jain, and Lakshmi Chandra Jain presented the initial draft to the then President of India Rajendra Prasad who had shown interest in the scheme&#x27;s implementation. The idea was also discussed at the 1962 annual sessions of the All India Gujarati Sahitya Parishad and the Bharatiya Bhasha Parishad.

On 2 April 1962, around 300 writers of various Indian languages were invited to Delhi for the two sessions conducted by Dharamvir Bharati in which the draft was finalised and later presented to Prasad. The first award selection committee meeting was scheduled on 16 March 1963 and Prasad was appointed as its president. However, Prasad died on 28 February 1963 and thus the scheduled meeting was chaired by Kalelkar and Sampurnanand acted as president of the committee.

The first Selection Board consisted of Kalelkar, Niharranjan Ray, Karan Singh, R. R. Diwakar, V. Raghavan, B. Gopal Reddy, Harekrushna Mahatab, Rama Jain, and Lakshmi Chandra Jain and was headed by Sampurnanand. Works that were published between 1921 and 1951 were considered for the first award. The nine language committees that were formed were to submit to the board nominations along with translations of the work into Hindi or English. The final round had four authors; Kazi Nazrul Islam (Bengali), D. V. Gundappa (Kannada), Viswanatha Satyanarayana (Telugu), and G. Sankara Kurup (Malayalam). On 19 November 1966, Kurup was presented with the citation, statue of Saraswati, and a cheque for prize of at a ceremony held at Vigyan Bhavan, Delhi. In his acceptance speech, Kurup appreciated the concept of the new award and thanked it for bringing &quot;integration of the diverse people of this land on a spiritual plane&quot;.

==Rules and selection process==

The nominations for the award are received from various literary experts, teachers, critics, universities, and numerous literary and language associations. Every three years, an advisory committee is constituted for each of the languages. The language of the most recent recipient&#x27;s work is not eligible for consideration for the next two years. Each committee consists of three literary critics and scholars of their respective languages. All the nominations are scrutinised by the committee and their recommendations are submitted to the Jnanpith Award Selection Board.

The Selection Board consists of between seven and eleven members of &quot;high repute and integrity&quot;. Each member is part of the committee for a term of three years which can also be extended further for two more terms. The recommendations of all language advisory committees are evaluated by the board based on complete or partial translations of the selected writings of the proposed writers into Hindi or English. The recipient for a particular year is announced by the Selection Board, which has final authority in selection.

<text>Green Youth (, GJ) is the youth organisation linked to the Alliance 90/The Greens ( or ) political party in Germany.

==History==
Green Youth was founded on 16 January 1994, as an independent association with the name Grün-Alternatives Jugendbündnis (abbreviated: GAJB).

Before 1994 there were, after the first attempts in Niedersachsen like Grüne Jugend Braunschweig, founded in the spring of 1981, several state-based associations, such as the Grüne Jugend Hessen, which had been founded in the spring of 1991. It used and still uses a frog as its logo. In the same spring the Grün-Alternative Jugend Baden-Württemberg was founded. Parallel to these state-based organisations was the federal Bundesjugendkontaktstelle (Abbreviated: BUJUKS), a loose network of young members and sympathisers of Die Grünen.

After several years of debate, a federal green youth organisation was founded, in which the state-based organisations and the BUJUKS all merged. In 2001, Green Youth became an integral part of the Die Grünen and lost its independent status.

In 2024 the spokespeople and the entire federal board of ten people stepped down and resigned their Alliance 90/The Greens memberships, citing a plan to create a new left-wing youth organization, citing a rightward shift of the party on foreign, economic and environmental policy as their reason.

==Ideology==
Although it has similar positions to its mother party, there are some differences. Green Youth for instance is in favour of legalisation of all drugs and the use of free software.
==Organization==
Green Youth is a &quot;Basisgruppe&quot; within Alliance 90/The Greens. It has about 15,000 members. Some of these are members of state-based organisations, while others are direct members of the federal organisation. Membership of the youth organisation currently represents about 15% of the membership of the main party. Membership of the organisation ends in the year one becomes 28-years-old.

The highest organ of the party is the federal congress, in which all members can participate and vote. It elects the board with two speakers, the editors of the party-magazine, SPUNK and the board of arbitration. There is a strict rule that the board, the two speakers and all other elected groups at any level must consist of at least 50% women, inter or trans persons, same as in the mother party. This is to ensure equal treatment. In the months that the federal congress does not meet a federal council, consisting out of two members per state-based organisations, meets. There are also several thematic fora, which work on specific themes (e.g. Europe, Democracy, Drugs, Equal treatment).

Green Youth is a member of the Federation of Young European Greens and Global Young Greens.

<text>Joseph Wolf (22 January 1820 – 20 April 1899) was a German artist who specialized in natural history illustration. He moved to the British Museum in 1848 and became the preferred illustrator for explorers and naturalists including David Livingstone, Alfred Russel Wallace and Henry Walter Bates. Wolf depicted animals accurately in lifelike postures and is considered one of the great pioneers of wildlife art. Sir Edwin Landseer thought him &quot;...without exception, the best all-round animal artist who ever lived&quot;.

==Germany==

Joseph was the first son of a farmer, Anton Wolf, and his wife Elisabeth née Probstfeld. The Minnesota pioneer Randolph Michael Probstfield was his first cousin. Wolf was born in Mörz, near Münstermaifeld, then in Rhenish Prussia, not far from the river Moselle, in the Eifel region. He was originally called Mathias but later went by the name of Joseph. In his boyhood he assiduously studied bird and animal life, and showed a remarkable capacity as a draughtsman of natural history subjects. He showed an early talent for art by cutting paper silhouettes of birds and animals which he pasted onto windows. He later took an interest in hunting. He made himself brushes from the fur of a stone marten, and drew illustrations of birds that he raised from the nest or found near his home. He took a special interest in birds of prey, and considered art as a career but realized at the age of sixteen that he needed more training to be professional. With support from his father he was apprenticed to a firm of lithographers, Gebrüder Becker at Koblenz. Here he found his first illustrated ornithology book (by Johann Conrad Susemihl—he went on to illustrate a later edition of it in the collection of a trader with an interest in birds, and was surprised by the poor quality of the plates). He returned home after three years of apprenticeship, and for a while took up a temporary job with the village headman in searching homes for illegally concealed liquor.

Wolf travelled to Frankfurt and introduced himself as a lithographer to the ornithologist Eduard Rüppell. Rüppell was just beginning to work on the birds of Abyssinia and he encouraged Wolf to work for him either by living in Frankfurt or Darmstadt where he suggested Wolf could work for Johann Jakob Kaup. Wolf moved to Darmstadt but went on working on Rüppell&#x27;s &quot;The Birds of North-East Africa&quot;. Kaup was impressed by his abilities and took one of Wolf&#x27;s sketchbooks to a meeting in Leyden to show to Hermann Schlegel at the Natural History Museum, Leiden. Schlegel immediately commissioned Wolf to work on some plates for &quot;Traité de Fauconnerie&quot;. The result was a set of &quot;magnificent paintings of birds of prey in life size&quot; which established Wolf&#x27;s reputation in Europe.

At the age of 20, Wolf was to appear at Maien to join the Army. As a fit young man with sharp-shooting abilities he could not be rejected, but it was peacetime and the surgeon, who knew him, helped him avoid recruitment under the pretext of a weak chest. Back in Darmstadt, Wolf went on working on bird plates, and joined an art school where he worked on portraits, landscapes and copying of works in the Darmstadt Gallery. He was a keen observer of wild birds and once had a pit dug in which he sat all day to watch the courtship of black grouse. In 1847, he left Darmstadt to join the Antwerp Academy to learn the Dutch oil painting techniques. Around this time, Kaup visited the British Museum, he was asked about the German artist who did the plates for Schlegel&#x27;s book, and Wolf was invited to London to illustrate the genera of birds for a book by George Robert Gray.

==London==
Wolf travelled to London on 20 March 1848 on the Soho, and was introduced by David William Mitchell, an amateur illustrator himself and a secretary of the Zoological Society of London, to Trübner of Longmans publishing. The very next day was set to work on Gray&#x27;s &quot;The Genera of Birds&quot;. While at work in the insect room of the British Museum, he met other naturalists including J. O. Westwood with whom he could converse in French. He was a friend of William Russell, an accountant and a Campbell related to the Duke of Argyll. Russell brought Sir Edwin Landseer and the Duke of Argyll to see the works of Wolf. The Duke soon became a patron and he was also introduced to the Duke of Westminster. Wolf&#x27;s paintings were also appreciated by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood of London.
John Gould admired Wolf and would have liked him on his staff, but Wolf only contributed illustrations on a freelance basis. Wolf accompanied Gould on a collection trip to Norway. Wolf thought of Gould as a shrewd and uncouth man. Wolf also noted that Gould lacked a knowledge of feather patterning, apart from knowing nothing about composition, with a tendency to add too much colour, claiming that specimens in the wild were brighter.

Wolf was commissioned by the Zoological Society of London to paint a watercolour of wapiti deer in the snow; it is dated January 1881. Wolf soon became the illustrator of choice for all the books published by returning adventurers like David Livingstone, Alfred Russel Wallace and Henry Walter Bates (for instance Bates&#x27; 1863 book &quot;The Naturalist on the River Amazons&quot;).Wolf joined an association called the German Athenaeum which was founded in 1869 and members met for scientific, literary and musical evenings. For their exhibitions he worked on a range of compositions often with natural elements. His favourite medium was charcoal and ink. Wolf became treasurer to a fund for German widows during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. After the war, he met Daniel Giraud Elliot in Paris and visited a battlefield. He rendered the image in a design called &quot;Peace and War&quot; with turtle doves on a bush over a soldier&#x27;s helmet. He also produces some cartoon-like illustrations including &quot;Lecture on Embryology&quot; in which he taunts certain men of science. When Charles Darwin began his study of animal expressions, he was introduced by Abraham Dee Bartlett, the zoo superintendent, to the abilities of Wolf in illustrating minute details of animals in action. Darwin requested Wolf to make some illustrations from photographs and living animals in the zoological garden. Wolf held his own opinions on the reliability of others&#x27; observations and even doubted Darwin&#x27;s interpretation of the face of a monkey as a &quot;laugh&quot;. Darwin visited him on several occasions and Wolf appreciated him for being very approachable, someone that even &quot;a child could talk to&quot;.

==Impact==

Wolf&#x27;s abilities were widely acclaimed even in his lifetime. Wolf established wildlife art as a genre and his observation of living birds allowed him to produce illustrations in very accurate and lifelike stances. On occasion he would come back from a trip and produce very accurate sketches from memory. He was very careful in his observation of feather patterns and when he read the works of Sundevall and Nitzsch on pterylography, he had nothing new to learn. The zoologist Alfred Newton called him &quot;the greatest of all animal painters&quot;, while Landseer said that Wolf must have been a bird before he became a man. Wolf made numerous drawings in pen and charcoal as well as lithographs for scholarly societies such as the Zoological Society of London (he produced 340 &quot;attractive&quot; colour plates for the ZSL Proceedings in the course of 30 years), and a very large number of illustrations for books on natural history and travel published from various countries; and was considerably successful as a painter as well. Until 1946, the cover of the journal &quot;Ibis&quot; carried a woodcut by Wolf of an ibis against a background with ruins, a pyramid and a rising sun. In 1946 the sun was removed from the background; the design was entirely changed in 1948 due to excessive wear of the block. In 1865, J. H. Gurney named a species of harrier after Wolf, but it was found to be an already described species.

Wolf died in London, surrounded by his pet birds. He is buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.

In 2002, a new road in Mörz, &quot;Joseph Wolf Weg&quot;, was named after the artist.

Wolf had four daughters, two of whom had children. His direct descendants live in the United Kingdom, South Africa and New Zealand.

His bicentenary was celebrated with a &quot;Joseph Wolf year&quot; in Mörz in January 2020.

<text>AvtoZAZ () is an automotive manufacturing company in Ukraine. It was founded in 1975 as Industrial Association, а holding that incorporated ZAZ, MeMZ, Illichivsk Automobile Parts Plant () and a number of other automobile-production facilities in Lutsk (LuAZ) and Kherson. It is the only enterprise in Ukraine having full-scale cycle of passenger cars production.

==History==
In the 1990s, it was reorganized into a joint-stock company, although 100% of shares stayed with the government.

In 1998 AvtoZAZ formed a joint venture with Daewoo Motors, named &quot;AvtoZAZ-Daewoo&quot; (АвтоЗАЗ-ДЕУ). ZAZ was included in the deal as 50% share on the behalf of AvtoZAZ. Following the bankruptcy of Daewoo Motors in 2001, Daewoo was bought out by General Motors, however GM refused to acquire overseas manufacturing subsidiaries including AutoZAZ-Daewoo; the Daewoo part was later bought out by a Swiss investment company in 2003.

Since the 2000s (decade), the state-owned 82% of AvtoZAZ shares were trusted to Ukrainian Automobile Corporation (UkrAVTO). In 2002, the corporation bought these shares and merged AvtoZAZ with ZAZ.

<doc id="1110961" wikidata="Q4993273" url="?curid=1110961" title="Youth in the SSW">
<text>The Youth in the South Schleswig Voters&#x27; Association (Youth in the SSW) (Danish: &quot;SSWUngdom&quot;, German: &quot;Jugend im SSW&quot;) is a political youth organization in Germany. It is the youth wing of the South Schleswig Voters&#x27; Association

==Names==
The official name of the organization is &quot;Sydslesvigsk Vælgerforenings Ungdom&quot; in Danish and &quot;Jugend im Südschleswigschen Wählerverband&quot; in German. The corresponding abbreviations are &quot;SSWUngdom&quot; and &quot;Jugend im SSW&quot;, respectively. There is no official English name, but a rough translation of the German name is &quot;Youth in the South Schleswig Voters&#x27; Association&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;Youth in the SSW&quot;.

==Positions==
According to their own description, the Youth in the SSW are non-ideological.

Instead, they choose to let their political positions be determined by three factors. Members must: 
* Be young.
* Have a connection to Denmark and Northern Europe.
* Be part of the Danish or Frisian minority.

Four key principles are used to determine their positions on a given matter:

* They defend the right of every human being to choose one&#x27;s own path.
* They aspire to establish a welfare state in Schleswig-Holstein and Germany similar to those found in Scandinavia.
* They are attached to the region where they live (as opposed to those parts of Germany where the minority rights of the Danish population group do not apply), and wish to see it developed together with its old Danish counterpart, South Jutland County.
* Due to their youth and attachment to their home region, they wish to have the state actively defend the environment.

==History==
Historically, the SSW has had various informal youth groups, but these tended to disband as their members left Southern Schleswig to study in the larger cities of Denmark or Germany. In 2009, Manuel J. Thomsen established Youth in the SSW with the aim of providing a more permanent youth organization. The new group held their first National Convention in 2010, where the members adopted their first by-laws, adopted their first political program, and elected their first Board, with Lukas A. Lausen as Chairman. Under Lausen, the youth wing increased its membership five-fold, doubled its budget, and formalized a relationship with the press. At the National Convention of 2011, the by-laws were changed to allow the creation of local branches, and the second National Board was elected under the chairmanship of Jonas Knickmeier.

==Structure==
===Internal===
The Youth in the SSW consists of two local branches (one in Flensburg and one in Schleswig) and the national federation. The local branches, or districts, are responsible for local politics, recruiting new members and arranging informative and social gatherings. The national federation is responsible for communications and national politics. On both levels, the members gather once a year for a local or national convention in order to discharge the old board, elect a new one and debate the challenges of the coming year. The National Board consists of the chairperson and two deputies. Additionally, an indeterminate number of ordinary board members are also elected every year. The same goes for the Local Board, which is usually smaller than the National counterpart.

===Relations to the SSW===
Legally, the Youth in the SSW is a working group within the mother party, which means it is not an independent organization. Nevertheless, it chooses its own course, without further interference from the SSW. Furthermore, all members of the SSW under the age of 26 are members of the Youth Wing and vice versa. It sees itself as the political voice of the youth in the Danish minority of Southern Schleswig, and as responsible for making the ideas and political beliefs of that demographic clearly visible in the actions of the political representation of the minority. Therefore, it primarily functions within the larger framework of the SSW. Some elected officials of the youth wing are ex officio members of the organs of the mother party, whereas other members of the Youth in the SSW get elected to these organs in their own right. For example, the members of the youth wing elect three delegates to the National Convention of the SSW, but nothing prohibits SSW members under the age of 26 from being elected delegates by their local party branches. Financially, the bonds are tight. Eighty percent of the youth wing&#x27;s budget comes from the main party, which is expected to decrease as government institutions on different administrative levels increase their shares.

<text>Pieter Wispelwey (born 25 September 1962) is a Dutch cellist. In 1992, he was the first cellist to receive the Netherlands Music Prize, a government-awarded prize given to the most promising young musician in the Netherlands. He has come to be regarded as one of the world&#x27;s leading performers and interpreters of both baroque and modern cello works.

He plays a 1760 Giovanni Battista Guadagnini cello and a 1710 Rombouts baroque cello.

==Early life==
Pieter Wispelwey was born in Haarlem and grew up in Santpoort. From a very early age he was exposed to the sounds of his father&#x27;s amateur string quartet when they rehearsed at the Wispelwey home. He began on the piano, but later took up the cello at age eight. Later on he took lessons from Dicky Boeke and Anner Bylsma in Amsterdam, followed by studies with Paul Katz in the USA and William Pleeth in the UK.

==Career==
His first recording with Channel Classics Records, the Bach Cello Suites, received considerable acclaim upon its release in 1990. He released two further recordings of the suites in 1998 (Channel Classics) and 2012 (Evil Penguin Records). The support of Channel Classics in the 1990s and 2000s enabled him to record his own choice of repertoire, with his own choice of artists and orchestras. This resulted in recordings of unusual repertoire, such as Franz Schubert violin sonatinas, Frédéric Chopin waltzes, mazurkas and preludes and the Bach Gamba sonatas played with his own personal instrumentations.

Wispelwey has appeared as a recitalist all over the world, including at the Concertgebouw (Amsterdam), Wigmore Hall (London), Châtelet (Paris), Teatro Colón (Buenos Aires) and Sydney Opera House. He has performed with many orchestras and ensembles, both with and without a conductor. Notable projects without conductor have been the touring and recording of the Schumann and Shostakovich cello concertos with the Australian Chamber Orchestra under Richard Tognetti. He has also appeared with the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Russian National Symphony, Camerata Academica Salzburg, Mahler Chamber Orchestra and the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen and others and has recorded with the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra and the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic.

==Playing style==
Wispelwey is comfortable playing the modern cello with either metal or gut strings as well as the baroque four- and five-string cello, which allows him a repertoire ranging from Bach to Elliott Carter. Growing up exposed to gut strings as the norm like many others of his generation, Wispelwey developed a conviction that, under the right conditions, much of the 18th- and 19th-century string repertoire sounds superior when played on gut strings instead of metal. However, he is not a purist, and he plays on steel strings if conditions make it sound better than gut strings.

He has been praised for his &quot;intelligent, penetrating musicianship and lyrical commitment,&quot; and Ivan Hewett, writer for the Telegraph and teacher at the Royal College of Music, likened him to a &quot;master rhetorician.&quot;

==Personal life==
Since the age of 19 he has resided in Amsterdam.

<doc id="1110979" wikidata="Q2511971" url="?curid=1110979" title="Goodnight, Irene">
<text>&quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot; or &quot;Irene, Goodnight,&quot; (Roud 11681) is a 20th-century American folk standard, written in time, first recorded by American blues musician Huddie &#x27;Lead Belly&#x27; Ledbetter in 1933. A version recorded by The Weavers was a #1 hit in 1950. Pete Seeger of The Weavers has characterized it as Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;theme song.&quot; 

The lyrics tell of the singer&#x27;s troubled past with his love, Irene, and express his sadness and frustration. Several verses refer explicitly to suicidal fantasies, most famously in the line &quot;sometimes I take a great notion to jump in the river and drown&quot;, which was the inspiration for the title of the 1964 Ken Kesey novel &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot; and a song of the same name from John Mellencamp&#x27;s 1989 album, &quot;Big Daddy&quot;, itself strongly informed by traditional American folk music.

==Origin==
In 1886, Gussie Lord Davis published a song called &quot;Irene, Goodnight&quot;. The lyrics of the song have some similarities to &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot; to suggest that Huddie Ledbetter&#x27;s song was based on Davis&#x27; lyrics. There is also a degree of resemblance in the music despite some differences, such as their time signatures, to indicate that the two songs are related. According to Ledbetter, he first heard the core of the song, the refrain, and a couple of verses from his Uncle Terrill. Another uncle of Ledbetter, Bob Ledbetter, who also recorded a nearly identical version of the song, said that he also learned the song from Terrill. Family members of Huddie Ledbetter indicate that he may have sung the song as early as 1908 as a lullaby to his niece, Irene Campbell. Ledbetter eventually extended the song to six verses.

== Lead Belly&#x27;s version ==
John Lomax recorded a version of Huddie Ledbetter&#x27;s song &quot;Irene&quot; in 1933, on a prison visit to Angola (Louisiana State Penitentiary). These recordings for the Library of Congress included three takes of &quot;Irene&quot;. The first version recorded in 1933 had two verses and two choruses, the second version from 1934 had four verses and four refrains, while the third version from 1936 had six verses and six refrains, including an extended spoken part.

As part of the Federal Art Project that began in 1935, the song was published in 1936, in Lomax&#x27;s version, as &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot;, a joint Ledbetter-Lomax composition. It has a straightforward verse–chorus form, but is in waltz time. It is a three-chord song, characterized as a &quot;folk ballad&quot; with a three-phrase melody, with provenance in 19th-century popular music transmitted by oral tradition.

&quot;Irene&quot; has been styled by Neil V. Rosenberg a &quot;folk recomposition&quot; of the 1886 song &quot;Irene Good Night&quot; by Gussie L. Davis. Hank Williams connected the melody to the English ballad tradition, via a mountain song he knew as &quot;Pere Ellen&quot;. Lead Belly&#x27;s account was of performing &quot;Irene&quot; by 1908, in a way he learned from his uncles Ter(r)ell and Bob. By the 1930s, he had made the song his own, modifying the rhythm and rewriting most of the verses. John and Alan Lomax made a field recording of Bob Ledbetter&#x27;s version of the song.

Lead Belly continued performing the song during his prison terms. An extended version of the song that includes narratives connecting the verses appears in &quot;Negro Folk Songs as Sung by Lead Belly.&quot; In 1941, Woody Guthrie used the melody for his New Deal anthem &quot;Roll On, Columbia, Roll On&quot;.

&quot;Irene&quot; remained a staple of Lead Belly&#x27;s performances throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In 2002, Lead Belly&#x27;s Library of Congress recording received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award.

== Version by the Weavers ==
In 1950, one year after Lead Belly&#x27;s death, the American folk band the Weavers recorded a version of &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot;. It was a B-side track on the Decca label, produced by Milt Gabler. The arranger was Gordon Jenkins. It was a national hit, as was the A-side, a version of &quot;Tzena, Tzena, Tzena&quot;; sales were recorded as 2 million copies.

The single first reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Best Sellers in Stores chart on June 30, 1950 and lasted 25 weeks on the chart, peaking at #1 for 13 weeks. Although generally faithful, the Weavers chose to omit some of Lead Belly&#x27;s lyrics, leading &quot;Time&quot; magazine to label it a &quot;dehydrated&quot; and &quot;prettied up&quot; version of the original. The Weavers&#x27; lyrics are the ones now generally used, and &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked this version as the No. 1 song of 1950. This song closed the Weavers historic final concert on November 28, 1980.

==Covers==
After the Weavers&#x27; success, many other artists released versions of the song, some of which were commercially successful in several genres. Frank Sinatra&#x27;s cover, released a month after the Weavers&#x27;, lasted nine weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine Best Seller chart on July 10, peaking at #5. Later that same year, Ernest Tubb and Red Foley had a number 1 country music record with the song, and the Alexander Brothers, Dennis Day and Jo Stafford released versions which made the Best Seller chart, peaking at number 26, number 17 and number 9 respectively. Moon Mullican had a number 5 country hit with it in 1950, and a version by Paul Gayten and his Orchestra reached number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in the same year.

On the &quot;Cash Box&quot; chart, where all available versions were combined in the standings, the song reached a peak position of number 1 on September 2, 1950, and lasted at number 1 for 13 weeks.

Raffi sang the song on his 1979 children&#x27;s album &quot;The Corner Grocery Store&quot;, but with modified lyrics about where different animals sleep.

The song was the basis for the 1950 parody called &quot;Please Say Goodnight to the Guy, Irene&quot; by Ziggy Talent. It also inspired the 1954 &quot;answer&quot; record &quot;Wake Up, Irene&quot; by Hank Thompson, a No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s country chart.

Tom Waits&#x27;s cover was included on &quot;&quot;; Keith Richards covered it on his third solo album, &quot;Crosseyed Heart&quot;.

===Other hit versions===
* 1959: Billy Williams reached number 75 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart.
* 1962: Jerry Reed reached number 79 on the US pop chart.

== Use in football ==
&quot;Goodnight Irene&quot; is sung by supporters of English football team Bristol Rovers. It was first sung at a fireworks display at the Stadium the night before a home game against Plymouth Argyle in 1950. During the game, the following day, Rovers were winning quite comfortably and the few Argyle supporters present began to leave early prompting a chorus of &quot;Goodnight Argyle&quot; from the Rovers supporters—the tune stuck and &quot;Goodnight Irene&quot; became the club song. The song was sung by Plymouth Argyle supporters for a long time before this and this added to the goading by the Bristol Rovers fans.

== Other uses ==
In professional wrestling, &quot;Adorable&quot; Adrian Adonis frequently referred to his finishing move—a standard sleeperhold—as &quot;Goodnight, Irene.&quot;

In the 2013 videogame &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot;, the song is heard being sung at the Raffle Fair, in the beginning of the game. It is an early indication of the anachronistic nature of the story, as it is set in the year of 1912.

<text>The Young Communist League of Germany (, abbreviated KJVD) was a political youth organization in Germany.

==History==
The KJVD was formed in 1920 from the Free Socialist Youth () of the Communist Party of Germany, A prior youth wing had been formed in October 1918, with the support from the Spartacus League (). It was unable to attract new members and its membership peaked in the last years of the Weimar Republic with 35,000 and 50,000 members. However, those who did join were commonly children of communist parents that were extremely devoted to the Communist Party.

Their activities included selling party newspapers, painting slogans, gluing posters, collecting dues and taking part in agitation. They also made up the voice choruses for Communist songs at demonstrations and other events. The KJVD had its own publishing house, the &quot;Young Guard&quot;. The KJVD followed the Communist Party propaganda of attacking the Social Democratic Party of Germany as a proponent of &quot;social fascism&quot; resulting in hostility toward the Social Democrats becoming a feature of the KJVD.

Political rifts between the KJVD and its parent organization, the Communist Party, appeared, including support by members of the KJVD for the young Communist intellectual Heinz Neumann who advocated increased use of physical violence against political enemies, including the Nazis.

The future leader of East Germany, Erich Honecker was a member of the KJVD and became the KJVD leader of Saarland in 1931.

After the majority of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany joined the Communist Party of Germany at the end of 1920, the Independents&#x27; Socialist Workers Youth group followed suit and merged with the Communist Party&#x27;s youth organization which in 1925, became known as the Young Communists League.

The central organ of KJVD was , which was published illegally.

==Legacy==
In 2002 the KPD (1990) established their youth organisation, also calling it the KJVD.
