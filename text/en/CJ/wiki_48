<text>A court of equity, also known as an equity court or chancery court, is a court authorized to apply principles of equity rather than principles of law to cases brought before it. These courts originated from petitions to the Lord Chancellor of England and primarily heard claims for relief other than damages, such as specific performance and extraordinary writs. Over time, most equity courts merged with courts of law, and the adoption of various Acts granted courts combined jurisdiction to administer common law and equity concurrently. Courts of equity are now recognized for complementing the common law by addressing its shortcomings and promoting justice.

In the early years of the United States, some states followed the English tradition of maintaining separate courts for law and equity. Others combined both types of jurisdiction in their courts, as the US Congress did for federal courts. United States bankruptcy courts serve as an example of a US federal court that operates as a court of equity. A few common law jurisdictions, such as the U.S. states of Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Tennessee, continue to preserve the distinctions between law and equity as well as between courts of law and courts of equity. In New Jersey, this distinction is upheld between the civil and general equity divisions of the New Jersey Superior Court.

== History ==

The unique nature of courts of equity is a result of their historical evolution. This history has been crucial in shaping their application in case law, reflecting the values that have developed the equitable jurisdiction. The transformation of these courts demonstrates the evolution of equity&#x27;s doctrines and remedies, changes in its dominant nature and traits, and the influence of social and political environments on its operation and underlying issues in jurisprudence.

=== Equity as a body of law ===
Equity is currently recognized as a distinct body of law, administered by various modern courts. The evolution of procedures within courts of equity has guided the application of equitable principles. Originating from the diverse rules of the early Courts of Chancery, today&#x27;s courts can exercise equitable jurisdiction while maintaining their inherent discretionary abilities to address new forms of injustice. Equity is not an independent body of law; rather, it is synonymous with corrective justice and complements common law to counterbalance its inflexible rules.

=== Origin of the equity jurisdiction ===
The historical emergence of equity occurred during three significant periods: the medieval period (13th–15th centuries), the formative period (16th–17th centuries), and the period of systematization (17th–19th centuries). Throughout these periods, equity developed progressively from the Chancellor providing equitable relief based on personal conscience to an established and organized body of law governed by courts.

==== Medieval period ====
The Chancery Division was established in the 13th century by the King after the separation of the Supreme Court of Judicature. Under the Chancellor&#x27;s authority, the &quot;King&#x27;s law&quot; prevailed in local courts. The division did not handle actual cases but performed functions associated with the King&#x27;s secretarial department. Although the Chancery Division did not function as a court, judicial activity was still present. Limited discretionary power was provided, determining the validity of writs issued in courts and permitting only those in &quot;consimili casu&quot;. These were enforced temporarily and could be overridden by the courts of law if deemed to conflict with the actual law of the land. As the administrative operations of the division expanded through its implicit control of the King&#x27;s residual influence, the Chancellor became responsible for addressing &quot;prayers&quot; and &quot;petitions&quot;, including letters of remedy, relief, and grants on behalf of the King. During the 14th and 15th centuries, the Chancery developed into an independent and extensive bureaucracy. Its formalized role involved issuing writs regarding inheritance or property transfers, which served as the justice&#x27;s authorization for initiating claims in the King&#x27;s courts.

==== Formative period ====
In the 16th century, the modern system of equity and the Chancellor evolved into a body with recognized judicial features. Consequently, the jurisdiction within the courts experienced greater autonomy. This involved the Court of Chancery issuing decrees independently of the King&#x27;s Council, the Chancellors becoming proficient in law, and a more systematized role in resolving petitions. As it developed into a substantive judicial court with increased power, other common law courts became wary and defensive towards their jurisdiction. The court was one of specific jurisdiction with distinct procedures compared to common law courts, such as the Court of Chancery issuing a common injunction rather than common law injunctive relief.

==== Period of systemisation ====
The systemisation of equity is often credited to Lord Eldon and the introduction of the Judicature Acts in 1873. He rationalized the rules and principles found in modern equity today, to provide enhanced consistency and certainty. As a result, equity existed in conjunction with the common law. Prior to this, the Courts of Chancery experienced shortcomings and a &quot;period of decline and stagnation&quot; during the early 18th century. Such defects included jurisdictional delays, administrative complications, costly proceedings and burdensome processes.

=== The High Court of Chancery ===

By the early 1500s, a vast proportion of the court&#x27;s workload was attributed to cases concerning equity. W.S. Holdsworth believed that the principles of equity were developed by and through the Chancery, and recognised three factors that influenced the evolution of such jurisdiction: 
antagonism to the rigidity of the common law; ideas about the function of conscience in determining equitable rules; and a procedure, distinct from that of common law, that allowed the chancellor to decide the most equitable course to take in each individual case.

== Equity and Common Law ==

=== A merged administration ===

The passing of the English Judicature Act 1873 established the new High Court of Justice and Court of Appeal division to substitute the old Chancery, Common Pleas, Queen&#x27;s Bench and Exchequer Courts. Subsequently, changes in the court&#x27;s administration included the ability for separate divisions to obtain coexisting jurisdiction in relation to common law and equitable principles. As Lord Watson stated, the main purpose of this Act was to provide parties to a litigation &quot;all remedies to which they are entitled&quot;. This prevents the need to recourse to another court and reduces the unnecessary profusion of legal proceedings.

=== Relationship between common law and equity ===
Prior to the enactments of the Judicature Acts, equity courts occupied a discrete jurisdiction to the common law. It was prohibited to transfer an action, and if proceedings were initiated in the incorrect court, the entire case must be brought again from the beginning. The administrative inefficiency created by the operation of separate courts became excessively onerous, that it demanded a comprehensive overhaul of the system.

As a result of the post-judicature systems and Earl of Oxford&#x27;s case (1615) allowing an overlapping of claims brought before the merged modern courts, equity would prevail over the common law (common injunctions will be upheld) in situations of conflict or discrepancy between the opposing principles.

==== Exclusive jurisdiction ====
Prior to the introduction of the Judicature systems, the enforcement of equitable claims could only occur in a Court of Chancery who held the power to grant relief, and not by the common law. Equating to new rights, exclusive jurisdiction provided relief against breaches of legal privileges which were not preserved by equity within the concurrent jurisdiction. Such intervention was sanctioned as it ensured irreversible injury was effectively compensated by damages, and it prevented the multiplicity of claims regarding the same issue. The body of law/court acts without right where it interferes with the other who has exclusive jurisdiction; allowing for the relevant sovereign to be curtailed. The nature of the exclusive jurisdiction was defined by Ashburner as: 

The claim of the plaintiff was one which before the Judicature Act would have given him no right whatever against the defendant in any court but the Court of Chancery, and the court of Chancery, in granting relief was said to exercise its exclusive jurisdiction.

==== Concurrent jurisdiction ====
Concurrent jurisdiction recognises situations where the facts in a pleading brought by a party produces both common law and equity actions, with the same relief issued at either. The requirement post-Judicature system allowed a claimant to attend only one court, rather than two, to enforce both the common law and equitable principles regarding the breach and remedy. Associated with new remedies, this jurisdiction empowers an applicant to pursue equitable relief where it can be established that the appropriate relief under common law is insufficient to do justice. There is no rivalry between the two jurisdictions; given that they can freely undertake proceedings as though the other didn&#x27;t exist, and no grievances or restraints are made between them regarding the validity of their operations. The objective of this jurisdiction is to provide &quot;a more perfect remedy or to apply a more perfect procedure than the other court could give or apply&quot;.

==== Auxiliary jurisdiction ====
Associated with new procedure, auxiliary jurisdiction recognises situations of equity assisting in proceedings through the enforcement of legal rights where it did not have concurrent jurisdiction over the matter. The Court of Chancery did not arbitrate where adequate relief was accessible at common law and the adjudication of the legality of the litigant&#x27;s claim was left to the responsibility of common law courts. This meant that the common law was binding on equity. Auxiliary jurisdiction merely acted &quot;as ancillary to the administration of justice in other courts&quot;. Related to pre-trial, the court of equity has the power to produce documents which common law courts could not as a tool for discovery procedures. The court is required to maintain the present state of affairs, without any direct relief, until the parties’ rights are dictated at common law. It also has the authority after settlement to aid in relief by deliberating a more effective remedy on the litigant, who previously attained common law relief.

== Nature ==

=== Powers of courts of equity ===
The courts of equity in England are recognised for operating in personam, while the common law courts act in rem. This means that the court of equity&#x27;s jurisdiction constitutes acts only against the conscience of a person or a number of persons, rather than a claim against an item of property. Yet, there are several exceptions to this.
Given that equity does not pertain definitive or formal rules, the courts are required to assess explicit conduct through its flexible nature and discretionary powers. The courts address fundamental principles of good faith, generosity, morality, honesty and integrity, while also evaluating the relative fairness between the parties. Provided the latitude of the Chancellor&#x27;s discretion and scope of equitable remedies, it has allowed the courts to consider the interests of the public at large when providing or refusing relief to the plaintiff.

In contrast to the rulings in the King&#x27;s or Common Bench where the judgements are binding upon the rights of a party, equitable decrees only bind the person to obedience. Although the Chancellor has the authority to compel a person to punishment until they obey, the decree can also serve as a defence to future cases (regarding the same claim) in the Court of Chancery to provide a satisfactory reason why the Chancellor should not consider it again.

=== Administration of justice ===
As equity is perceived in an ethical context, the courts often encapsulate this as fair, moral, ethical and just conduct. As Aristotle highlighted, equitable conduct can be said to be just as it promotes the improvement of the deficiencies of the universal concept. He concludes that equity&#x27;s role within the courts &quot;is to prevent the law from adhering too rigidly to its own rules and principles when those rules and principles produce injustice&quot;. Given that equitable principles are not absolute in nature, it is acceptable for the courts to depart from any rules when they conflict with justice. Unlike legal justice, equitable justice develops on an individualised and case-by-case basis within the courts for the purpose of enhancing just outcomes and to adequately judge the requirements of specific circumstances.

=== Protection of personal rights ===
As the jurisdiction of the equity courts evolved, it was no longer limited to the protection of prescribed rights and eventually took cognizance of cases not generally conforming with its jurisdiction – such as criminal cases. Given that defamation highly concerns personal rights, post-Judicature Act has allowed a court of equity to exercise its jurisdiction to prevent the publication of false declarations determined to cause harm to an individual&#x27;s trade. A limitation to a court of equity&#x27;s jurisdiction in this area is its inability to prohibit the publication of false or derogatory statements detrimental to a plaintiff&#x27;s profession or title to property – whereby such assertions are not attendant to threats, coercion, intimidation, or any direct attack.

== Comparison of the courts of equity ==

=== Australia ===
The judicature system has been implemented across Australia, with South Australia being the first to enact it in 1853. Corresponding Acts to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (UK) include Supreme Court Act 1935 (SA) ss 17-28, Civil Proceedings Act 2011 (Qld) s 7, Supreme Court Act 1935 (WA) ss 24–25, Supreme Court Act 1986 (Vic) s 29, Supreme Court Civil Procedure Act 1932 (Tas) ss 10–11, Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) ss 57–62 and Law Reform (Law and Equity) Act 1972 (NSW).

Despite there being a single Supreme Court of New South Wales with complete jurisdiction within both common law and equity prior to the adoption of the Judicature Act in NSW, they remained being treated as separate courts.

=== India ===

Unlike most countries, the equity jurisdiction always operated and was administered in conjunction with the law in India, through the courts, and not in resistance to it. Following the British codification of the law in India, equitable principles were embedded in the judicial frameworks of the courts. The courts have relied on equity &quot;as a source of law to devise a new principle in a situation where the statute or codified law had no answer to a given situation&quot;. The Supreme Court of India recognised this fusion of the law by further expanding the application of its equitable and remedial powers in the areas of environmental degradation, tort law, strict liability doctrines and human rights.

=== Scotland ===

As there is no separate court in Scotland which exclusively operates an equity jurisdiction, the country&#x27;s legal system is classified as mixed. The Court of Session controls both jurisdictions, by differentiating between common law and equity throughout cases brought before it. This provides greater certainty to parties, given that the court has the power to provide relief in either equity or common law where the party is not entitled to one or the other. As the two jurisdictions became indistinguishable, &quot;what in effect was a rule in equity became in practice considered as common law&quot;. Scottish lawyers have raised concern that this system would create unjust decisions where cases are approached in terms of combining equity and common law reasoning. Others followed Lord Kames&#x27;s view of a dual approach, whereby equity in the court existed for the purpose of creating &quot;new equitable rules which gradually hardened into common law by virtue of their usage across time&quot;.

=== United States ===
The period after the American Revolution saw the abolition of chancery courts (or their merger with courts of law) in American states such as Massachusetts, New York, and Virginia. That was the result of equity being disfavoured and rejected until, late in the 19th century, federal judges revived the equitable injunction. The early amendments of the United States Constitution explicitly acknowledged common law and equity as being clear divisions of jurisprudence. However, Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure came into effect in 1938 to unite common law with equitable claims. Other states maintained their courts of equity, although many have more recently merged them with their courts of law. Only Delaware, Mississippi and Tennessee still have separate equity courts, such as the Delaware Court of Chancery.

<text>A traffic analysis zone or transportation analysis zone (TAZ) is the unit of geography most commonly used in conventional transportation planning models. The size of a zone varies, but for a typical metropolitan planning software, a zone of under 3,000 people is common. The spatial extent of zones typically varies in models, ranging from very large areas in the exurb to as small as city blocks or buildings in central business districts. There is no technical reason zones cannot be as small as single buildings, however additional zones add to the computational burden. 

Zones are constructed by census block information. Typically these blocks are used in transportation models by providing socio-economic data. States differ in the socio-economic data that they attribute to the zones. Most often the critical information is the number of automobiles per household, household income, and employment within these zones. This information helps to further the understanding of trips that are produced and attracted within the zone. Again these zones can change or be altered as mentioned in the first paragraph. This is done typically to eliminate unneeded areas to limit the computational burden.

<text>Hansen is a lunar impact crater that is located near the eastern limb of the Moon. It was named after Danish astronomer Peter Andreas Hansen. It lies to the northeast of the larger crater Condorcet, and to the south of the smaller Alhazen.

The outer wall of Hansen is sharp-edged, with a slight outward bulge to the southwest. The inner wall drops downward to a shelf of slumped material, then to a slightly bowl-shaped interior. There is a central peak formation at the midpoint of the interior.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hansen. All are in the east with the A being closer and the B being further.

<doc id="1096281" wikidata="Q1806665" url="?curid=1096281" title="Lassell (lunar crater)">
<text>Lassell is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the eastern part of the Mare Nubium. It was named after British astronomer William Lassell, who discovered Uranian moons Ariel and Umbriel, among other achievements.

Lassell lies to the west of the crater Alpetragius and southwest of Alphonsus.

==Description==
The interior of Lassell has been flooded and resurfaced by lava, leaving a nearly flat surface with a low remaining outer rim. The surface has a low albedo, giving the interior a dark appearance. The surviving outer wall is generally circular but with a somewhat polygonal shape.

To the east-northeast is a circular, bowl-shaped crater designated Lassell B. This formation has a higher albedo than its surroundings and so appears relatively bright, especially at high sun angles.

The tiny crater Lassell D is located to the west-northwest of Lassell, about halfway to the ruined crater Guericke. This craterlet is surrounded by a patch of high-albedo surface, and is an example of a prominent lunar bright patch. The light hue is thought to be an indication of recent formation, at least in lunar geological terms.

==Lassell massif==
To the west of Lassell, at coordinates 14.65°S, 350.96°E is a small highland area called the Lassell Massif, which has a reddish color relative to the surrounding mare.

The massif was created by series of eruptions of viscous silicic lavas starting 4.07 billion years ago. Its surface is suspected to be partially buried by ejecta from Copernicus crater. The southern domes Lassell G and Lassell K have most silica-rich composition and feature a caldera-like depressions on tops.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lassell.

<doc id="1096283" wikidata="Q2738168" url="?curid=1096283" title="Pseudomonas putida">
<text>Pseudomonas putida is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, saprophytic soil bacterium. It has a versatile metabolism and is amenable to genetic manipulation, making it a common organism used in research, bioremediation, and synthesis of chemicals and other compounds.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has listed &quot;P. putida&quot; strain KT2440 as Host-vector system safety level 1 certified (HV-1), indicating that it is safe to use without any extra precautions. Thus, use of &quot;P. putida&quot; in many research labs is preferable to some other &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species, such as &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, for example, which is an opportunistic pathogen.

== History and phylogeny ==
Based on 16S rRNA analysis, &quot;P. putida&quot; was taxonomically confirmed to be a &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species (&quot;sensu stricto&quot;) and placed, along with several other species, in the &quot;P. putida&quot; group, to which it lends its name. However, phylogenomic analysis of complete genomes from the entire &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; genus clearly showed that the genomes that were named as &quot;P. putida&quot; did not form a monophyletic clade, but were dispersed and formed a wider evolutionary group (the putida group) that included other species as well, such as &quot;P. alkylphenolia, P. alloputida, P. monteilii, P. cremoricolorata, P. fulva, P. parafulva, P. entomophila, P. mosselii, P. plecoglossicida&quot; and several genomic species (new species which are not validly defined).

A variety of &quot;P. putida&quot;, called multiplasmid hydrocarbon-degrading &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, is the first patented organism in the world. Because it is a living organism, the patent was disputed and brought before the United States Supreme Court in the historic court case &quot;Diamond v. Chakrabarty&quot;, which the inventor, Ananda Mohan Chakrabarty, won. It demonstrates a very diverse metabolism, including the ability to degrade organic solvents such as toluene. This ability has been put to use in bioremediation, or the use of microorganisms to degrade environmental pollutants.

== Genomics ==
The protein count and GC content of the (63) genomes that belong to the &quot;P. putida&quot; wider evolutionary group (as defined by a phylogenomic analysis of 494 complete genomes from the entire &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; genus) ranges between 3748–6780 (average: 5197) and between 58.7–64.4% (average: 62.3%), respectively. The core proteome of the analyzed 63 genomes (of the &quot;P. putida&quot; group) comprised 1724 proteins, of which only 1 core protein was specific for this group, meaning that it was absent in all other analyzed &quot;Pseudomonads&quot;.

==Repair and avoidance of DNA damage==

The &quot;P. putita&quot; genome specifies enzymes that repair oxidative DNA damages (oxidized guanine) during the stationary phase of growth thus avoiding mutagenesis. Enzymes that participate in the removal of oxidized guanine in carbon-starved &quot;P. putata&quot; DNA include MutY glycosylase and MutM glycosylase. &quot;P. putita&quot; also specifies the enzyme MutT, a pyrophosphohydrolase that converts 8-oxodGTP to 8-oxodGMP in order to prevent 8-oxodGTP from being used as a substrate by the replicative DNA polymerase.

==Uses==
===Bioremediation===
The diverse metabolism of wild-type strains of &quot;P. putida&quot; may be exploited for bioremediation; for example, it has been shown in the laboratory to function as a soil inoculant to remedy naphthalene-contaminated soils.

&quot;Pseudomonas putida&quot; is capable of converting styrene oil into the biodegradable plastic PHA. This may be of use in the effective recycling of polystyrene foam, otherwise thought to be not biodegradable.

===Biocontrol===
&quot;Pseudomonas putida&quot; has demonstrated potential biocontrol properties, as an effective antagonist of plant pathogens such as &quot;Pythium aphanidermatum&quot; and &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; f.sp. &quot;radicis-lycopersici&quot;.

===Oligonucleotide usage signatures of the &quot;P. alloputida&quot; KT2440 genome===
Di- to pentanucleotide usage and the list of the most abundant octa- to tetradecanucleotides are useful measures of the bacterial genomic signature. The &quot;P. putida&quot; KT2440 chromosome is characterized by strand symmetry and intrastrand parity of complementary oligonucleotides. Each tetranucleotide occurs with similar frequency on the two strands. Tetranucleotide usage is biased by G+C content and physicochemical constraints such as base stacking energy, dinucleotide propeller twist angle, or trinucleotide bendability. The 105 regions with atypical oligonucleotide composition can be differentiated by their patterns of oligonucleotide usage into categories of horizontally acquired gene islands, multidomain genes or ancient regions such as genes for ribosomal proteins and RNAs. A species-specific extragenic palindromic sequence is the most common repeat in the genome that can be exploited for the typing of &quot;P. putida&quot; strains. In the coding sequence of &quot;P. putida&quot;, LLL is the most abundant tripeptide. Phylogenomic analysis reclassified the strain KT2440 in a new species &quot;Pseudomonas alloputida&quot;.

=== Organic synthesis ===
&quot;Pseudomonas putida&#x27;s&quot; amenability to genetic manipulation has allowed it to be used in the synthesis of numerous organic pharmaceutical and agricultural compounds from various substrates.

=== CBB5 and caffeine consumption ===
&quot;Pseudomonas putida&quot; CBB5, a nonengineered, wild-type variety found in soil, can live on caffeine and has been observed to break caffeine down into carbon dioxide and ammonia.

<text>Vavasseur mountings were several mounting devices for artillery and machine guns. They were invented and patented by Josiah Vavasseur.

The mountings were used in Barton&#x27;s Point Battery in Sheerness, on the Isle of Sheppey, in Kent, England.

Vavasseur pivot mountings were also used in naval artillery mounted on ships in the late 19th century.

<text>Ashdod-Yam or Azotus Paralios (lit. Ashdod/Azotus-on-the-sea&quot;) is an archaeological site on the Mediterranean coast of Israel. It is located in the southern part of the modern city of Ashdod, and about 5 kilometres northwest of the ancient site of Tel Ashdod, where ancient Ashdod stood in the time of the Philistines. Ashdod-Yam and its inland counterpart, Ashdod or Azotus Mesogaios, were for most of their history two closely connected but distinct entities. Much of the surrounding environ is covered by sand dunes and remains unexplored.

==Names==

The ancient Levantine settlement of Ashdod-Yam had several names. In Assyrian records, it is attested as &quot;asdudi-immu&quot;, corresponding to the Hebrew &quot;’ašdód-yamm&quot;. The first part of the name, &quot;Ašdod&quot;, is believed to be derived from the Late Bronze Age Canaanite &quot;’aṯdādu&quot;.

In the Hellenistic period, the name of the settlement became &quot;Azotus Paralios&quot;, literally &quot;Azotus-by-the-sea&quot;, in contrast to Azotus Mesogaias, literally &quot;Inland Azotus&quot;. In the Islamic period, it became &quot;Mahuz Azdud&quot;, literally &quot;harbour of Azdud&quot;, a combining the ancient Aramaic word for harbour, &quot;mahuz&quot;, and &quot;Azdud&quot;.

During the Crusades, as property of the lord of Ramla, Hugh, it was bequeathed to the knight Nicolas de Beroard and became known as &quot;Castellum Beroart&quot;. Its contemporary Arabic name is &quot;Minat al-Qal&#x27;a&quot;, after the Umayyad-era fort that was built at the site and whose ruins remain partially intact to this day.

==History==

The two towns, Ashdod and Ashdod-Yam, have been connected throughout their history. Despite the antiquity of the place, the name &quot;Ashdod-yam&quot; was applied to the site and adjacent town in October 1955, by Israel&#x27;s Government Naming Committee.

===Late Bronze Age===
During the Late Bronze Age the inland city of Ashdod used a port facility near the mouth of the Lakhish River, at , as its main exit to the sea, while a smaller port was probably located at Ashdod-Yam.

===Iron Age===
During the Iron Age the roles gradually reversed, and Ashdod-Yam, located south of Ashdod, overtook in importance the port at Tel Mor, located north of Ashdod. As one of the main five cities of the Philistine Pentapolis, Ashdod had great regional significance.

Ashdod-Yam is first mentioned in documents from the time of Sargon II of Assyria when in 713 BCE the Assyrian king speaks of having to depose a usurper who had taken over control of the city of Ashdod and had fortified three towns: Ashdod itself, Gath, and &quot;Asdudimmu&quot; (Ashdod-Yam).

===Hellenistic through Byzantine period===

When general Pompey restored to Ashdod its independence previously lost to the Hasmonean king John Hyrcanus, the city consisted of two twin towns, the regional center of &quot;Azotos Mesogeios&quot; or &quot;A. Hippenos&quot; (lit. &quot;inland Ashdod&quot; and &quot;Ashdod of the horsemen&quot; respectively), and &quot;Azotos Paralios&quot; (lit. &quot;coastal Ashdod&quot;; also written A. Paralus, Paralius)
 The town, under its Greek designation, appears in the Madaba Map of the 6th century.

This arrangement persisted throughout the Byzantine period, when the port town actually overshadowed in importance its former mother-city further inland: the bishops of Azotos present at the council of 325 and the council of Jerusalem in 536 seem to have resided in Azotos Paralios rather than in Azotos Mesogeios. Remains from Azotos Paralios of the Byzantine period, including a 1.500-year-old Greek dedication to a large church, were found over 2 km north of the inland Iron Age site. The inscription was discovered between two modern houses, about a mile from the coast. According to a medieval Christian Georgian calendar, a four-line Greek mosaic inscription dated back to &quot;the 3rd indiction, year 292&quot;, which corresponds to the 6th century AD on the Gregorian calendar. The 6th-century Madaba Map shows both cities under their respective names. The prominence of Hellenised, then Christian Azotus continued until the 7th century, when it came under Muslim rule. The city was represented at the Council of Chalcedon by Heraclius of Azotus.

A chancel screen from a synagogue from the 6th century CE testifies to the existence of a Jewish community at Ashdod-Yam during the Byzantine period.

In November 2017, archaeologists discovered a church, later fully excavated and called “Church of the Deaconesses.” An inscription was discovered between two modern houses, about a mile from the coast. According to a medieval Christian Georgian calendar, a four-line Greek mosaic inscription dated back to &quot;the 3rd indiction, year 292&quot;, which corresponds to the 6th century AD on the Gregorian calendar. Archaeologists thought they could have found the remains of the Roman-Byzantine city of Ashdod-Yam. In 2021 excavations at the site of a Byzantine-era Christian basilica revealed &quot;splendid&quot; mosaics and tombs dug beneath the floors. The mosaics provide evidence of women serving as ministers and deacons of the church. The burials included mass-graves of bodies covered in lime, believed to have been used to inter victims of the Plague of Justinian.

===Early Muslim, Crusader, and Mamluk periods===
In the Umayyad period, the Caliph Abd al-Malik, the builder of the Dome of the Rock, constructed a fort at Azotus Paralios in the 7th century as part of a series of coastal defenses in Palestine. Measuring 35m by 55m, the fort was built over the razed &quot;insulae&quot; of the former Byzantine town, and was previously thought to been of later 10th or 11th century construction. It was only after subsequent archaeological work that it was determined to have been built by the Umayyads and only later remodelled by the Fatimids and Crusaders. 

The medieval Arabic name of the port town was Mahuz Azdud, &quot;harbour of Azdud&quot;, a very interesting combination between the by then already ancient Aramaic word for harbour, &quot;mahuz&quot;, and &quot;Azdud&quot;, a return to a form much closer to the old Semitic name &quot;Ashdod&quot;.

The fort of &quot;Minat al-Qal&#x27;a&quot; (lit. &quot;the port with the castle&quot; in Arabic) was probably built by the Umayyads and was reconstructed by the Fatimids and Crusaders. The initial purpose was to hold off the strong Byzantine navy and it constituted one link in a chain of Muslim coastal fortifications.

Documents from the Crusader period indicate that Ashdod and Ashdod-Yam belonged to the lordship of Ramla, and it appears probable that in 1169 the old Arab sea fort (Minat al-Qal&#x27;a) was given by Hugh, lord of Ramla, to his knight Nicolas de Beroard. From this period the fort is known as &quot;Castellum Beroart&quot;.

===Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===
The port stops being mentioned during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, making it likely that it was destroyed by the Muslims along with the other port cities, due to fears that they might again be used by Crusader invasions from the sea. With the destruction of the port city, its inland counterpart regains its importance.

==Excavation==
The Iron Age site was excavated by Jacob Kaplan from 1965 to 1968 on behalf of the Tel Aviv-Yafo Museum of Antiquities. Finds at the site include sections of city fortification walls and a glacis. Pottery found at the site suggests that the fortifications were built in the second half of the 8th century BCE and that a second phase of occupation occurred during the 7th century BCE when the site was no longer fortified.

The medieval fort has been most recently worked on by Dov Nachlieli and his team.

<text>Ohm is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the south of the crater Comrie, and the satellite crater Comrie K is attached to Ohm&#x27;s northeastern rim. To the northwest is the larger Shternberg, and to the southwest is Kamerlingh Onnes.

This crater is located at the origin of a ray system that extends for several hundred kilometers across the surrounding lunar terrain. The exterior surface for about 20–30 km is relatively free of the ray material, but beyond that perimeter is a skirt of higher albedo, with streaks extending to the northwest, east-northeast, and southwards. The crater is part of the Copernican System.

The outer rim of Ohm is sharply defined, except at the southern end where the edge is somewhat irregular. The inner surface drops down to an interior blanket of slumped material that slopes down to the floor. The crater lacks a notable central peak.

Prior to formal naming by the IAU in 1970, Ohm was called &quot;Crater 253&quot;.

<text>The Novosibirsk Report, which many scholars consider one of the first signs of perestroika, was the name given in the West to a classified paper (&quot;for internal use only&quot;) prepared under the direction of Tatyana Zaslavskaya of the Novosibirsk Institute of Economics which addressed the crisis in the agriculture of the Soviet Union. It was the theme of a closed conference in Novosibirsk in April 1983 and leaked to the &quot;Washington Post&quot; which published it in August.

Although expressed in terms of Marxist theory, this paper, an outline of a proposed research project to study the social mechanisms of economic development as exemplified in Siberian agriculture, was sharply critical of current conditions.

The conference was organized by the Sociology Department of the Institute of Economics and Industrial Engineering of the Soviet Academy of Sciences to discuss the report prepared under the direction of Zaslavskaya that considered lagging of &quot;production relations&quot; (производственные отношения) with respect to &quot;production forces&quot; (производительные силы) in the country.

Mikhail Gorbachev discussed this report within the higher echelons of the Soviet Communist Party, and it is believed that this report was the basis of Gorbachev&#x27;s criticism of &quot;administrative methods&quot; in the economic management at the 27th Party Congress, which initiated perestroika.

<text>Robertson is an important lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, just beyond the western limb. It lies just to the south of Berkner, a formation with a comparable size but more eroded features. Just to the east is Helberg, and to the southwest is Alter.

The inner wall of the crater rim has a wide, complex formation of multiple s. The rim is approximately circular, but with an irregular outline where various terraces have slumped away. The interior has a central peak at the midpoint, and this is joined to a rugged stretch of ground that connects with the northeastern rim. A band of light-hued ray material from Ohm covers the southern half of the crater floor and rim.

Prior to formal naming by the IAU in 1970, Robertson was called &quot;Crater 177&quot;.

<doc id="1096308" wikidata="Q220341" url="?curid=1096308" title="Zoospore">
<text>A zoospore is a motile asexual spore that uses a flagellum for locomotion in aqueous or moist environments. Also called a swarm spore, these spores are created by some protists, bacteria, and fungi to propagate themselves. Certain zoospores are infectious and transmittable, such as &quot;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&quot;, a fungal zoospore that causes high rates of mortality in amphibians.

==Diversity==

=== General morphology ===
Zoospores are composed of a microtubular cytoskeleton base which extends from the base of the flagellum. The complexity and structure of this cytoskeleton is variable and is largely dependent on volume and size. One common feature of zoospores is their asymmetrical shape; a result of the ventral grove housing the flagella base. Certain zoospores progress through different phases, the first phase commonly referred to as &#x27;the initial&#x27;. Others form cysts that vary tremendously in volume (14-4905 cubic micrometers) and shape, each with distinctive hair structures.

===Flagella types===
Zoospores may possess one or more distinct types of flagella - tinsel or &quot;decorated&quot;, and whiplash, in various combinations.

*Tinsellated (straminipilous) flagella have lateral filaments known as mastigonemes perpendicular to their main axis, which allow for more surface area, and disturbance of the medium, giving them the property of a rudder, that is, used for steering. 
*Whiplash flagella are straight, to power the zoospore through its medium. Also, the &quot;default&quot; zoospore only has the propelling, whiplash flagella.

Both tinsel and whiplash flagella beat in a sinusoidal wave pattern, but when both are present, the tinsel beats in the opposite direction of the whiplash, to give two axes of control of motility.

Attachment to the base of the zoospore is variable between taxa and may help with identification of species.

===Morphological types===

In eukaryotes, the four main types of zoospore are illustrated in Fig. 1 at right:
# Posterior whiplash flagella are a characteristic of the Chytridiomycota, and a proposed uniting trait of the opisthokonts, a large clade of eukaryotes containing animals and fungi. Most of these have a single posterior flagellum (Fig. 1a), but the Neocallimastigales have up to 16 (Fig. 1b).
# Anisokonts are biflagellated zoospores with two whip types flagella of unequal length (Fig. 1c). These are found in some of the Myxomycota and Plasmodiophoromycota.
# Zoospores with a single anterior flagellum (Fig. 1d) of the tinsel type are characteristic of Hyphochytriomycetes. 
# Heterokont are biflagellated zoospores (Fig. 1e, f) with both whiplash (smooth) and tinsel type (fine outgrowths called mastigonemes) flagella attached anteriorly or laterally. These zoospores are characteristic of the Oomycota and other heterokonts.

==Zoosporangium==

A zoosporangium is the asexual structure (sporangium) in which the zoospores develop in plants, fungi, or protists (such as the Oomycota). Developing sporangia of oomycetes go through a process of cleavage in which a protein kinase, in the case of &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot;, induces the sporangial cytoplasm to split and release the various zoospores. Release of the spores can occur either inside of the zoosporangium (intrasporangial zoosporogenesis) or exteriorly (extrasporangial zoosporogenesis). Spores absorb water and travel through the cell membrane for excretion.

== Infectivity ==
Different fungal zoospores may infect different taxa of organisms. Due to zoospores&#x27; aquatic lifestyle, fish and amphibians are ideal hosts. Some colonize exposed injuries in fish which may cause epidermal damage, leading to death in certain cases. Others may utilize species of frogs (such as &quot;Bufo marinus&quot; and &quot;Rana catesbieana&quot;) as carriers, allowing extended ranges of travel.

<text>Saenger is an ancient lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, just beyond the eastern limb. It was named after Austrian rocketry scientist Eugen Sänger. To the west-northwest is the crater Erro, and due north lies Moiseev. To the northeast is Al-Khwarizmi.

The outer rim of Saenger has been eroded and reshaped by subsequent impacts, leaving the outer wall nearly destroyed to the north and south. The satellite crater Saenger D is adjacent to the interior of the northeastern rim. To the west, Saenger V lies across the northwestern rim, while the crater pair Saenger P and Q lie across and intrude into the southwestern rim. In contrast, the interior floor is relatively flat and featureless, with only tiny craterlets to mark the surface.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Saenger.

<text>Ben Wicks, (born Alfred Wicks; October 1, 1926 – September 10, 2000) was a British-born Canadian cartoonist, illustrator, journalist and author.

==Biography==
Wicks was a Cockney born into a poor, working-class family in London&#x27;s East End near London Bridge. He learned to play the saxophone in the British Army and toured Europe in a band with author Leonard Bigg also from London. He immigrated to Canada in 1957 with his wife Doreen Wicks with just $25. He found work as a milkman in Calgary and then joined the Canadian Army as a musician and began studying cartooning from books. Wicks came across a list in a library of magazines willing to purchase cartoons and began trying his hand—his first major success was being published by the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;.

In 1963, he travelled to Toronto to assess cartooning possibilities and met Toronto Telegram &#x27;The Giants&#x27; daily illustrated feature cartoonist, Norman Drew, who advised him to move to Toronto. Wicks then moved to Toronto to work for the &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; and his cartoon, &quot;The Outcasts&quot;, was soon syndicated in over 50 newspapers. His cartoons were simply drawn but were very topical and witty and became popular with readers and were picked up by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; after the Telegram ceased operations in 1971. At its height, his daily cartoon, now called &quot;Wicks&quot;, was carried by 84 Canadian and more than 100 American newspapers.

Wicks had a self-effacing but charming personality and became a popular guest on television and radio shows and had his own television show on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in the 1970s. He also created and illustrated the &quot;Katie and Orbie&quot; series of children&#x27;s books written by his daughter Susan, which in 1994 were turned into an animated series for Family in Canada and for PBS in the United States.

Canada Games published a board game in collaboration with Ben called &quot;Quick Picks With Ben Wicks&quot; which is similar in game play to Pictionary.

He also opened a pub in Toronto&#x27;s Cabbagetown district named &quot;The Ben Wicks&quot;. The Parliament Street pub was sold to new owners in July 2013. However, a blue plaque commemorating Wicks has been installed on the railing and a wall-sized outdoor cartoon by Wicks has been retained.

Wicks was also known for his humanitarian work. He used his illustrations to publicize the plight of civilian sufferers of the Biafran War in Nigeria, and became a supporter of Oxfam. During the 1984–1985 famine in Ethiopia, he organized Cartoonists for Africa, raising money and awareness. Wicks spent much time in his later decades promoting literacy among children.

In 1986, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada.

In 1997, he donated material to the Ryerson University archives.

Wicks died of cancer in 2000 at age 73.

In Wicks&#x27; memory, the annual &quot;Ben Wicks Award&quot; was given from 2001 to 2010 to young talented cartoonists by Regional Maple Leaf Communications.

In May 2007, Wicks was the subject of a court case, as his children tried to reclaim 2,408 vintage drawings left behind in a 1992 move. The family won the case and the court ordered the drawings to be returned to them.

<doc id="1096323" wikidata="Q913447" url="?curid=1096323" title="Morley's trisector theorem">
<text>In plane geometry, Morley&#x27;s trisector theorem states that in any triangle, the three points of intersection of the adjacent angle trisectors form an equilateral triangle, called the first Morley triangle or simply the Morley triangle. The theorem was discovered in 1899 by Anglo-American mathematician Frank Morley. It has various generalizations; in particular, if all the trisectors are intersected, one obtains four other equilateral triangles.

==Proofs==
There are many proofs of Morley&#x27;s theorem, some of which are very technical. 
Several early proofs were based on delicate trigonometric calculations. Recent proofs include an algebraic proof by extending the theorem to general fields other than characteristic three, and John Conway&#x27;s elementary geometry proof. The latter starts with an equilateral triangle and shows that a triangle may be built around it which will be similar to any selected triangle. Morley&#x27;s theorem does not hold in spherical and hyperbolic geometry.
One proof uses the trigonometric identity

which, by using of the sum of two angles identity, can be shown to be equal to

::formula_1

The last equation can be verified by applying the sum of two angles identity to the left side twice and eliminating the cosine.

Points formula_2 are constructed on formula_3 as shown. We have formula_4, the sum of any triangle&#x27;s angles, so formula_5 Therefore, the angles of triangle formula_6 are formula_7 and formula_8

From the figure

{\overline{XE}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

and

{\overline{XF}}.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Also from the figure

::formula_9

and

The law of sines applied to triangles formula_10 and formula_11 yields

{\overline{AY}}\sin\gamma&lt;/math&gt;|}}

and

{\overline{AZ}}\sin\beta.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Express the height of triangle formula_12 in two ways

::formula_13

and

::formula_14

where equation (1) was used to replace formula_15 and formula_16 in these two equations. Substituting equations (2) and (5) in the formula_17 equation and equations (3) and (6) in the formula_18 equation gives

::formula_19

and

::formula_20

Since the numerators are equal

::formula_21

or

::formula_22

Since angle formula_23 and angle formula_24 are equal and the sides forming these angles are in the same ratio, triangles formula_6 and formula_26 are similar. 

Similar angles formula_27 and formula_28 equal formula_29, and similar angles formula_26 and formula_6 equal formula_32 Similar arguments yield the base angles of triangles formula_33 and formula_34

In particular angle formula_35 is found to be formula_36 and from the figure we see that

::formula_37

Substituting yields

::formula_38

where equation (4) was used for angle formula_11 and therefore

::formula_40

Similarly the other angles of triangle formula_41 are found to be formula_42

==Side and area==

The first Morley triangle has side lengths

formula_43

where &quot;R&quot; is the circumradius of the original triangle and &quot;A, B,&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are the angles of the original triangle. Since the area of an equilateral triangle is formula_44 the area of Morley&#x27;s triangle can be expressed as

formula_45

==Morley&#x27;s triangles==
Morley&#x27;s theorem entails 18 equilateral triangles. The triangle described in the trisector theorem above, called the first Morley triangle, has vertices given in trilinear coordinates relative to a triangle &quot;ABC&quot; as follows:

formula_46

Another of Morley&#x27;s equilateral triangles that is also a central triangle is called the second Morley triangle and is given by these vertices:

formula_47

The third of Morley&#x27;s 18 equilateral triangles that is also a central triangle is called the third Morley triangle and is given by these vertices:

formula_48

The first, second, and third Morley triangles are pairwise homothetic. Another homothetic triangle is formed by the three points &quot;X&quot; on the circumcircle of triangle &quot;ABC&quot; at which the line &quot;XX&quot; −1 is tangent to the circumcircle, where &quot;X&quot; −1 denotes the isogonal conjugate of &quot;X&quot;. This equilateral triangle, called the circumtangential triangle, has these vertices:

formula_49

A fifth equilateral triangle, also homothetic to the others, is obtained by rotating the circumtangential triangle /6 about its center. Called the circumnormal triangle, its vertices are as follows:

formula_50

An operation called &quot;extraversion&quot; can be used to obtain one of the 18 Morley triangles from another. Each triangle can be extraverted in three different ways; the 18 Morley triangles and 27 extravert pairs of triangles form the 18 vertices and 27 edges of the Pappus graph.

==Related triangle centers==

The Morley center, &quot;X&quot;(356), centroid of the first Morley triangle, is given in trilinear coordinates by

formula_51

1st Morley–Taylor–Marr center, &quot;X&quot;(357): The first Morley triangle is perspective to triangle the lines each connecting a vertex of the original triangle with the opposite vertex of the Morley triangle concur at the point

<text>Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn (November 24, 1941 – May 13, 2012) was an American bass guitarist, session musician, record producer, and songwriter. Dunn was notable for his 1960s recordings with Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s and as a session bassist for Stax Records. At Stax, Dunn played on thousands of records, including hits by Otis Redding, Sam &amp; Dave, Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas, William Bell, Eddie Floyd, Johnnie Taylor, Albert King, Bill Withers, Elvis Presley, and many others. In 1992, he was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s. In 2017, he was ranked 40th on &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Bass Players of All Time&quot;. He was known for his opinion that the Fabulous Blues Brothers&#x27; Show Band and Revue was &quot;powerful enough to turn goat piss into gasoline&quot;.

==Early life==
Dunn was born in Memphis, Tennessee. His father nicknamed him &quot;Duck&quot; while watching Disney cartoons with him one day. Dunn grew up playing sports and riding his bike with another future professional musician, Steve Cropper.

==Career==

=== 1960s: First bands ===

After Cropper began playing guitar with their friend Charlie Freeman, Dunn decided to learn the bass guitar. Eventually, along with drummer Terry Johnson, the four became the Royal Spades. The Messick High School group added keyboardist Jerry Lee &quot;Smoochy&quot; Smith, singer Ronnie Angel (also known as Stoots), and a budding young horn section in baritone saxophone player Don Nix, tenor saxophone player Charles &quot;Packy&quot; Axton, and trumpeter (and future co-founder of the Memphis Horns) Wayne Jackson.

Cropper has noted how the self-taught Dunn started out playing along with records, filling in what he thought should be there. &quot;That&#x27;s why Duck Dunn&#x27;s bass lines are very unique,&quot; Cropper said, &quot;They&#x27;re not locked into somebody&#x27;s schoolbook somewhere&quot;. Axton&#x27;s mother, Estelle, and her brother Jim Stewart owned Satellite Records and signed the band, who had a national hit with &quot;Last Night&quot; in 1961 under their new name, the &quot;Mar-Keys&quot;.

Booker T. and the M.G.&#x27;s was founded by Cropper and Booker T. Jones in 1962, with the drummer Al Jackson, Jr. The original bassist, on early hits such as &quot;Green Onions&quot;, was Lewie Steinberg; Dunn replaced him in 1965.

===Late 1960s–1970s: Session musician===

Stax became known for Jackson&#x27;s drum sound, the sound of the Memphis Horns, and Dunn&#x27;s grooves. The MG&#x27;s and Dunn&#x27;s bass lines on songs like Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;Respect&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Turn You Loose&quot;, Sam &amp; Dave&#x27;s &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;&quot;, and Albert King&#x27;s &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot; influenced musicians everywhere.

As an instrumental group, they continued to experiment with the album &quot;McLemore Avenue&quot; (their reworking of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot;) and on their final album, &quot;Melting Pot&quot; (1971), which featured bass lines that to this day inspire hip-hop artists. In the 1970s, Jones and Cropper left Stax, but Dunn and Jackson stayed with the label. Dunn worked with Elvis Presley on his 1973 RCA Album &quot;Raised on Rock&quot;.

In 1971, when the rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty left Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), the remaining members discussed with Dunn the possibility of his joining the group, with their current bassist, Stu Cook, moving to guitar. Booker T. and the MG&#x27;s had performed in concert and jammed in the studio with CCR in the past, and Dunn in particular had become friends with the band members. But CCR ultimately decided to remain a trio from then on.

===1980s–2000s===

Dunn went on to play for Muddy Waters, Freddie King, Jerry Lee Lewis, Eric Clapton, Paul Butterfield, Mike Bloomfield, and Rod Stewart. He was the featured bass player on the single &quot;Stop Draggin&#x27; My Heart Around&quot;, by Stevie Nicks and Tom Petty, from Nicks&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Bella Donna&quot; (1981), and on other tracks by Petty between 1976 and 1981. He reunited with Cropper as a member of Levon Helm&#x27;s RCO All Stars and also displayed his quirky Southern humor making two movies with Cropper, former Stax drummer Willie Hall, and Dan Aykroyd as a member of the Blues Brothers band. Dunn was the bassist in Eric Clapton&#x27;s band for Clapton&#x27;s appearance at Live Aid in 1985.

Dunn played himself in the 1980 feature &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, where he famously uttered the line, &quot;We had a band powerful enough to turn goat piss into gasoline!&quot; and was frequently shown smoking a pipe while playing. He appeared in the 1998 sequel &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;, again as himself. Dunn &amp; the MGs were the house band for Bob Dylan&#x27;s concert celebrating Dylan&#x27;s 30th anniversary in the music business at Madison Square Garden playing behind Dylan, George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty, Stevie Wonder, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Eddie Vedder, and Neil Young, who recruited the MGs to tour with him and recorded with Dunn several times since.

In the 2000s, Dunn was in semi-retirement, but still performed occasionally with Booker T. &amp; the MG&#x27;s at clubs and music festivals.

In June 2004, Dunn, Cropper, and Jones served as the house band for Eric Clapton&#x27;s Crossroads Guitar Festival. The group backed such guitarists as Joe Walsh and David Hidalgo on the main stage at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas.

In 2008, Dunn worked with the Australian soul singer Guy Sebastian touring for &quot;The Memphis Album&quot;. Dunn and Cropper arrived in Australia on February 20, 2008, to be Sebastian&#x27;s backing band for an 18-date concert tour, the Memphis Tour.

Dunn is credited with performing on a version of the standard &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got Nobody&quot; with Jones, Cropper and Michel Gondry in Gondry&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Be Kind Rewind&quot;.

==Personal life==
Dunn was married to his wife, June, until his death. They had two sons, Mike and Jeff, and a grandson, Michael.

==Death==
On the morning of May 13, 2012, Dunn died in his sleep at age 70 after finishing his fifth double show at the Blue Note nightclub in Tokyo with Cropper the night before. He had been in Japan as part of an ongoing tour with Cropper and Eddie Floyd.

== Musical equipment ==

When Dunn was 16, he bought his first bass guitar, a Kay 162 electric bass. About a year later, he acquired his first Fender Precision Bass, with sunburst body, rosewood fingerboard, and gold anodized pickguard. He lost that bass when Otis Redding and members of the Bar-Kays were killed in a plane crash, and the bass was on loan to bassist James Alexander. Dunn&#x27;s second Fender bass was a 1959 Fender Precision Bass, with sunburst body, one-piece maple neck and gold anodized pickguard; he owned it until his death. Throughout his life, Dunn believed this was a 1958 model, but after his death, his son Jeff had work done on it, and the neck was inscribed &quot;4-59,&quot; putting the date definitively as 1959. During the 1960s, he used a nearly identical 1959 model, but it was outfitted with a rosewood fretboard. He was an avid user of thick La Bella flatwound strings, as was James Jamerson.

While filming &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, Dunn used a sunburst early &#x27;70s Fender Precision bass with a rosewood fretboard and a &quot;tortoiseshell&quot; pickguard. He also used a red 1966 Precision in some of the scenes, a bass stamped &quot;Demo&quot; on the back, which was later fitted with a late &#x27;60s Jazz Bass neck. It was a combination that was popular with other top-level players, including Carl Radle, and Billy Cox. This &quot;Jazzision&quot; became the basis for a Skyline Series signature bass made by the Chicago bass company Lakland nearly 20 years later. Dunn also used a white late-70s Precision Bass when performing Minnie the Moocher with Cab Calloway.

In 1980, with the popular Blues Brothers Band touring regularly, Fender gave Dunn a new bass to try, the company&#x27;s first active electronics equipped model, the Precision Bass Special. His bass (serial number E0xx009) was finished in his favorite color, Candy Apple Red, with a matching headstock, and featured a one-piece maple neck, and gold hardware. He played this bass briefly, before gifting it to a friend.

In the mid-1980s, after nearly three decades, Dunn switched from Fender instruments, and became an endorser for Mississippi-based Peavey. He played their &quot;Dyna Bass&quot; model – finished in his favorite red – on stage and in the studio for a number of years. Over the decades, he was given various basses by friends and admirers, which included models by Travis Bean, Rickenbacker, Gibson, custom builders, and others, but his everyday instrument was always his Precision.

In 1998, Dunn collaborated with Fender to produce a signature Precision Bass: a candy apple red model based on the late 1950s style, with a gold anodized pickguard, split coil humbucking pickup, maple neck, and vintage hardware for a limited production of 200 instruments. The Bass was offered only for a limited time. The Dunn family has serial numbers XXX001, XXX002, and XXX003 in their collection. #002 is currently on display at the Hard Rock Cafe in Orlando, Florida.

Fellow studio legend Bob Glaub introduced Dunn to the people at Lakland, and based on his &quot;Jazzision&quot; bass from the Blues Brothers movie, the company&#x27;s Duck Dunn signature model was released (later available as the model 44-64 Custom). Dunn played his final shows on one of these basses, and that bass remains with his son Jeff, complete with sweat streaks from his final moments of playing. Some of Dunn&#x27;s basses are displayed at Hard Rock Cafe locations, some are in museums (like the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland), and others are in the hands of private collectors.

Over the years, Dunn played through an Ampeg Portaflex, or &quot;Fliptop&quot;, B-15 combo (so named for its head that flipped over to store in the cabinet), as well as a Kustom 200 stack, and a Fender rig. He is best known for his use of an Ampeg SVT head and the company&#x27;s matching 8×10&quot; cabinet through his endorsement deal with Ampeg.

<text>Barack () is a type of Hungarian brandy (Pálinka) made of (or flavored with) apricots; an apricot brandy. 

The word &quot;barack&quot; is a collective term for both apricot (in Hungarian , lit. &quot;yellow-peach&quot;) and peach (in Hungarian , lit. &quot;autumn-peach&quot;). Note that the Hungarian word is etymologically related to the English word &#x27;peach&#x27; as well as many words meaning the same in many European languages, and ultimately goes back to , the ancient Greek word for &#x27;Persian&#x27;.

<doc id="1096340" wikidata="Q3100373" url="?curid=1096340" title="Hysterotomy">
<text>A hysterotomy is an incision made in the uterus. This surgical incision is used in several medical procedures, including during termination of pregnancy in the second trimester (or abortion) and delivering the fetus during caesarean section. It is also used to gain access and perform surgery on a fetus during pregnancy to correct birth defects, and it is an option to achieve resuscitation if cardiac arrest occurs during pregnancy and it is necessary to remove the fetus from the uterus.

There are several types of incisions that can be made, including a midline vertical incision and a low transverse incision. The incision is made using a scalpel and is about 1-2 cm long, but it can be longer depending on the procedure that is performed. Other types of incisions are low transverse incision with T-extension in the midline, low transverse incision with J-extension, and low transverse incision with U-extension. These are used when low transverse incisions do not provide enough space in order to remove the contents in the uterus.

This incision also comes with possible risks and complications when the incision is made and during repair, including blood loss (possibly leading to anemia), wound infection, fertility problems, premature labor, postoperative pain, and many others. In addition, a rare form of ectopic pregnancy known as scar ectopic pregnancy can occur. This is when there is abnormal implantation of an embryo onto the scar of the uterus. There is an increased risk of this complication occurring due to trauma from previous procedures utilizing hysterotomies, such as caesarean section and dilation, though the mechanism is unknown. Closure of the hysterotomy incision made can be done with either a staple or a suture. Sutures are most commonly used, specifically double layer sutures.

==Medical uses==

=== Hysterotomy abortion ===
A hysterotomy is used to remove a fetus from the uterus, similar to a procedure known as caesarean section, in order to terminate a pregnancy in the second trimester of later. It is typically used as last resort if dilation and curettage, dilation and electric vacuum aspiration, or manual vacuum aspiration fails to work. Dilation and curettage refers to the opening or widening of the cervix and scooping and scraping the tissues that are inside of the uterus. Electric vacuum aspiration utilizes a vacuum to remove the embryo that is in the uterus, but this method is more expensive than manual vacuum aspiration. 
=== Caesarean section ===
Although fetal delivery through caesarean section is a very common surgery done in the world, it comes with several risks including bleeding, infection, thromboembolism, and soft-tissue injury. During a caesarean section, a hysterotomy is utilized to make an incision in the uterus and remove the fetus. Gestational age, newborn birth weight, and danger presenting risks are all taken into account on whether or not a classic hysterotomy or low transverse incision will be made.

=== Resuscitative hysterotomy ===
A resuscitative hysterotomy is performed during or near the occurrence of a cardiac arrest, in which an incision is made to remove the fetus from the uterus. This is done in order to save the fetus, as well as to revive the person whose uterus was carrying the fetus. This is traditionally done if the fetus is of 24 weeks or older, at which it is viable outside of the uterus. The primary goal is to save the pregnant person, and in order to insure the highest survival rate, the goal of fetus delivery time is within 5 minutes after the patient goes under arrest and/or two cycles of CPR. During pregnancy, the pregnant uterus may compress the inferior vena cava and abdominal aorta, causing reduced blood flow to the uterus and to the pregnant person. Removing the fetus can restore blood flow to the pregnant person.

=== Fetal surgery ===
Hysterotomy is a technique used during fetal surgery to access the fetus in the pregnant uterus in order to treat a birth defect such as spina bifida. A standard hysterotomy remains the gold-standard for the closure of a fetal spina bifida because it is the safest and most effective when compared to mini-hysterectomies and a percutaneous two-layer fetoscopy. A mini-hysterotomy procedure is favored for extreme cases of preterm delivery and any complications regarding maternal, fetal, and/or neonatal because of the reduced risks and complications.

==Risks and complications==
The technique used to repair the hysterotomy is dependent on the surgeon&#x27;s preference. The method of repair and type of suture affects the risks and complications of receiving a hysterotomy. Hysterotomy incision repair can be done within the intraperitoneal space (&quot;in situ&quot;) or the uterus can be temporarily removed for repair (exteriorization). Both types of uterine positioning for repair yielded similar lengths of hospital stay, risk of infection, and estimated blood loss. Recovery following uterine exteriorization was found to induce more nausea and be more painful, requiring more post-operative analgesia. Return of bowel function was faster with &quot;in situ&quot; repair. It was found that between unlocked single-layer closure and double-layer closure, there is no difference in risk of uterine rupture, however the risk of rupture is increased with a locked single-layer suture.

Following the repair of the incision, a scar defect may form, which is defined as a thinning of uterine muscle at the incision site. These uterine scar defects are associated with increased risk of uterine rupture and scar separation. Scar defects may increase the risk of complications such as abnormal bleeding, pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility.

=== During caesarean section ===
Caesarean sections require a large incision of the uterus, which can lead to complications such as blood loss, postoperative pain, anaemia due to continuing blood loss, fever and possible wound infection, breastfeeding issues, difficulty passing urine, future fertility problems, and/or possible complications in future pregnancies including uterine rupture.

=== During fetal surgery ===
In fetal surgery, without inhibition of uterine contractions, uterine irritability and premature labor are complications that occur very frequently in of hysterotomy cases. It can be inhibited by anti-contraction medications. Preterm birth and early membrane rupture (PPROM) are common risks for fetal therapies. For most cases, fetoscopic surgery, which minimizes the damage to the uterus, is preferred to mitigate risks and complications. Membrane sealing and fixation has been investigated for reducing PPROM risk, but it has not been found to be clinically beneficial.

=== Scar ectopic pregnancy ===
Scar ectopic pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy, however, when it does occur it causes complications in pregnancy such as abnormal uterine bleeding and uterine rupture. The mechanism of how scar ectopic pregnancy still remains unknown. However, the possibility that defects may form to the scarring from previous procedures/traumas such as caesarean section, dilation, hysterotomy, abnormal placentation can cause scar ectopic pregnancy.

=== Hysterotomy abortion ===
There are two categories of complications with surgical abortions, minor and major. Minor complications are procedural pain, bleeding, infection and common anesthesia complications. The more serious and major complications include hemorrhage, sepsis, peritonitis, deep vein thrombosis and death.

== Types ==

There are many different types of hysterotomies depending on the location and direction of the incision. Typically, a low transverse incision is preferred during a caesarean section. This area of the uterus has less vasculature and therefore provides lower risk of hemorrhage during the procedure for the patient. Incisions in the lower area of the uterus is also associated with lower risks of uterine rupture. There may be times in which the lower transverse incision does not provide adequate space and therefore, expansions of the low transverse incisions have led to the creation of the low transverse incision with T-extension in the midline, low transverse incision with J-extension, and low transverse incision with U-extension. A low vertical incision and a midline incision, also known as a classic caesarean incision, may be preferred during a labor that is preterm. Since the lower uterine segment is not yet fully developed during a preterm labor, these two incisions are preferred in order to provide adequate space for manipulations during delivery of the fetus. A low transverse incision would not provide adequate space and could entrap the fetal head therefore risking intercranial hemorrhage, morbidity and mortality for the fetus. A midline incision may be preferred as well when the fetus lies transversely across the patient&#x27;s uterus or if the placenta lies in the area where the low transverse incision is made. In practice, however, the midline incision is rarely used. Other hysterotomy incisions include a high transverse incision and a fundal incision. A fundal incision may be used if the placenta is placed behind the anterior wall of the uterus and therefore making typical incisions much more risky for hemorrhage.

== Techniques ==

=== Incision ===
A hysterotomy can be performed by various methods. Typically a small incision is made with a scalpel about 1–2 cm long. During a blunt expansion, the incision is expanded by the surgeon&#x27;s index fingers or other blunt dissection tools. During a sharp expansion, bandage scissors are used to cut a larger incision. Some professionals will say that the sharp expansion allows for a more controlled entry into the uterus and a faster delivery of the fetus. Other professionals will say the blunt expansion allows for reduced risk of hemorrhaging or excessive bleeding and improves healing for the patient.

=== Closure ===
A hysterotomy is completed by closing the uterus either by using a stapler or by suture, no significant differences have been noted to show one technique takes precedent over another.  The muscular outer layer of the uterus in all samples of closures showed some inflammation and thickening/scarring of the tissue. In the event a midline incision is used, three layers of sutures are performed to repair the uterine wall. An interrupted suture is used to close the first and second layer and a continuous locking suture or figure-of-eight suture is used to close the third layer. Since in practice the low transverse incision is typically made, the incision is also typically closed with two layers of sutures. Though, there is a debate on whether the suture should be close with a single layer or a double layer of sutures. Double layer of sutures can promote improved healing, hemostasis and less risk of uterine rupture in the next pregnancy, whereas single layer of sutures allows for less operation time, less tissue disruption and decreased exposure to foreign suture material.

<text>Trip distribution (or destination choice or zonal interchange analysis) is the second component (after trip generation, but before mode choice and route assignment) in the traditional four-step transportation forecasting model. This step matches tripmakers’ origins and destinations to develop a “trip table”, a matrix that displays the number of trips going from each origin to each destination. Historically, this component has been the least developed component of the transportation planning model.

Where: &quot;T&quot; &quot;ij&quot; = trips from origin &quot;i&quot; to destination &quot;j&quot;. Note that the practical value of trips on the diagonal, e.g. from zone 1 to zone 1, is zero since no intra-zonal trip occurs.
Work trip distribution is the way that travel demand models understand how people take jobs. There are trip distribution models for other (non-work) activities such as the choice of location for grocery shopping, which follow the same structure.

== History ==

Over the years, modelers have used several different formulations of trip distribution. The first was the Fratar or Growth model (which did not differentiate trips by purpose). This structure extrapolated a base year trip table to the future based on growth, but took no account of changing spatial accessibility due to increased supply or changes in travel patterns and congestion. (Simple Growth factor model, Furness Model and Detroit model are models developed at the same time period)

The next models developed were the gravity model and the intervening opportunities model. The most widely used formulation is still the gravity model.

While studying traffic in Baltimore, Maryland, Alan Voorhees developed a mathematical formula to predict traffic patterns based on land use. This formula has been instrumental in the design of numerous transportation and public works projects around the world. He wrote &quot;A General Theory of Traffic Movement,&quot; (Voorhees, 1956) which applied the gravity model to trip distribution, which translates trips generated in an area to a matrix that identifies the number of trips from each origin to each destination, which can then be loaded onto the network.

Evaluation of several model forms in the 1960s concluded that &quot;the gravity model and intervening opportunity model proved of about equal reliability and utility in simulating the 1948 and 1955 trip distribution for Washington, D.C.&quot; (Heanue and Pyers 1966). The Fratar model was shown to have weakness in areas experiencing land use changes. As comparisons between the models showed that either could be calibrated equally well to match observed conditions, because of computational ease, gravity models became more widely spread than intervening opportunities models. Some theoretical problems with the intervening opportunities model were discussed by Whitaker and West (1968) concerning its inability to account for all trips generated in a zone which makes it more difficult to calibrate, although techniques for dealing with the limitations have been developed by Ruiter (1967).

With the development of logit and other discrete choice techniques, new, demographically disaggregate approaches to travel demand were attempted. By including variables other than travel time in determining the probability of making a trip, it is expected to have a better prediction of travel behavior. The logit model and gravity model have been shown by Wilson (1967) to be of essentially the same form as used in statistical mechanics, the entropy maximization model. The application of these models differs in concept in that the gravity model uses impedance by travel time, perhaps stratified by socioeconomic variables, in determining the probability of trip making, while a discrete choice approach brings those variables inside the utility or impedance function. Discrete choice models require more information to estimate and more computational time.

Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985) have developed combination destination choice and mode choice models using a logit formulation for work and non-work trips. Because of computational intensity, these formulations tended to aggregate traffic zones into larger districts or rings in estimation. In current application, some models, including for instance the transportation planning model used in Portland, Oregon, use a logit formulation for destination choice. Allen (1984) used utilities from a logit based mode choice model in determining composite impedance for trip distribution. However, that approach, using mode choice log-sums implies that destination choice depends on the same variables as mode choice. Levinson and Kumar (1995) employ mode choice probabilities as a weighting factor and develop a specific impedance function or “f-curve” for each mode for work and non-work trip purposes.

== Mathematics ==

At this point in the transportation planning process, the information for zonal interchange analysis is organized in an origin-destination table. On the left is listed trips produced in each zone. Along the top are listed the zones, and for each zone we list its attraction. The table is &quot;n&quot; x &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; = the number of zones.

Each cell in our table is to contain the number of trips from zone &quot;i&quot; to zone &quot;j&quot;. We do not have these within-cell numbers yet, although we have the row and column totals. With data organized this way, our task is to fill in the cells for tables headed &quot;t&quot; = 1 through say &quot;t&quot; = &quot;n&quot;.

Actually, from home interview travel survey data and attraction analysis we have the cell information for &quot;t&quot; = 1. The data are a sample, so we generalize the sample to the universe. The techniques used for zonal interchange analysis explore the empirical rule that fits the &quot;t&quot; = 1 data. That rule is then used to generate cell data for &quot;t&quot; = 2, &quot;t&quot; = 3, &quot;t&quot; = 4, etc., to &quot;t&quot; = &quot;n&quot;.

The first technique developed to model zonal interchange involves a model such as this:

: formula_1

where:
* formula_2 : trips from i to j.
* formula_3 : trips from i, as per our generation analysis
* formula_4 : trips attracted to j, according to generation analysis
* formula_5 : travel cost friction factor, say = formula_6
* formula_7 : Calibration parameter
Zone &quot;i&quot; generates &quot;T&quot; &quot;i&quot; trips; how many will go to zone &quot;j&quot;? That depends on the attractiveness of &quot;j&quot; compared to the attractiveness of all places; attractiveness is tempered by the distance a zone is from zone &quot;i&quot;. We compute the fraction comparing &quot;j&quot; to all places and multiply &quot;T&quot; ;&quot;i&quot; by it.

The rule is often of a gravity form:

: formula_8

where:
* formula_9 : populations of &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;
* formula_10 : parameters

But in the zonal interchange mode, we use numbers related to trip origins (&quot;T&quot; ;&quot;i&quot;) and trip destinations (&quot;T&quot; ;&quot;j&quot;) rather than populations.

There are many model forms because we may use weights and special calibration parameters, e.g., one could write say:

: formula_8

or

: formula_12

where:
* &quot;a, b, c, d&quot; are parameters
* formula_13 : travel cost (e.g. distance, money, time)
* formula_14 : inbound trips, destinations
* formula_3 : outbound trips, origin

== Gravity model ==
The gravity model illustrates the macroscopic relationships between places (say homes and workplaces). It has long been posited that the interaction between two locations declines with increasing (distance, time, and cost) between them, but is positively associated with the amount of activity at each location (Isard, 1956). In analogy with physics, Reilly (1929) formulated Reilly&#x27;s law of retail gravitation, and J. Q. Stewart (1948) formulated definitions of demographic gravitation, force, energy, and potential, now called accessibility (Hansen, 1959). The distance decay factor of 1/distance has been updated to a more comprehensive function of generalized cost, which is not necessarily linear - a negative exponential tends to be the preferred form.

The gravity model has been corroborated many times as a basic underlying aggregate relationship (Scott 1988, Cervero 1989, Levinson and Kumar 1995). The rate of decline of the interaction (called alternatively, the impedance or friction factor, or the utility or propensity function) has to be empirically measured, and varies by context.

Limiting the usefulness of the gravity model is its aggregate nature. Though policy also operates at an aggregate level, more accurate analyses will retain the most detailed level of information as long as possible. While the gravity model is very successful in explaining the choice of a large number of individuals, the choice of any given individual varies greatly from the predicted value. As applied in an urban travel demand context, the disutilities are primarily time, distance, and cost, although discrete choice models with the application of more expansive utility expressions are sometimes used, as is stratification by income or vehicle ownership.

Mathematically, the gravity model often takes the form:

: formula_16

: formula_17

: formula_18

where 
* formula_2 = Trips between origin &quot;i&quot; and destination &quot;j&quot;
* formula_3 = Trips originating at &quot;i&quot;
* formula_14 = Trips destined for &quot;j&quot;
* formula_13 = travel cost between &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;
* formula_23 = balancing factors solved iteratively. See Iterative proportional fitting.
* formula_24 = distance decay factor, as in the accessibility model

It is doubly constrained, in the sense that for any &quot;i&quot; the total number of trips from &quot;i&quot; predicted by the model always (mechanically, for any parameter values) equals the real total number of trips from &quot;i&quot;. Similarly, the total number of trips to &quot;j&quot; predicted by the model equals the real total number of trips to &quot;j&quot;, for any &quot;j&quot;.

== Entropy analysis ==

Wilson (1970) gives another way to think about zonal interchange problem. This section treats Wilson’s methodology to give a grasp of central ideas.

To start, consider some trips where there are seven people in origin zones commuting to seven jobs in destination zones. One configuration of such trips will be:

: formula_25

where 0! = 1.

That configuration can appear in 1,260 ways. We have calculated the number of ways that configuration of trips might have occurred, and to explain the calculation, let’s recall those coin tossing experiments talked about so much in elementary statistics.

The number of ways a two-sided coin can come up is formula_26, where n is the number of times we toss the coin. If we toss the coin once, it can come up heads or tails, formula_27. If we toss it twice, it can come up HH, HT, TH, or TT, four ways, and formula_28. To ask the specific question about, say, four coins coming up all heads, we calculate formula_29. Two heads and two tails would be formula_30. We are solving the equation:

: formula_31

An important point is that as &quot;n&quot; gets larger, our distribution gets more and more peaked, and it is more and more reasonable to think of a most likely state.

However, the notion of most likely state comes not from this thinking; it comes from statistical mechanics, a field well known to Wilson and not so well known to transportation planners. The result from statistical mechanics is that a descending series is most likely. Think about the way the energy from lights in the classroom is affecting the air in the classroom. If the effect resulted in an ascending series, many of the atoms and molecules would be affected a lot and a few would be affected a little. The descending series would have many affected not at all or not much and only a few affected very much. We could take a given level of energy and compute excitation levels in ascending and descending series. Using the formula above, we would compute the ways particular series could occur, and we would conclude that descending series dominate.

That is more-or-less Boltzmann&#x27;s Law,

: formula_32

That is, the particles at any particular excitation level &quot;j&quot; will be a negative exponential function of the particles in the ground state, formula_33, the excitation level, formula_34, and a parameter formula_35, which is a function of the (average) energy available to the particles in the system.

The two paragraphs above have to do with ensemble methods of calculation developed by Gibbs, a topic well beyond the reach of these notes.

Returning to the O-D matrix, note that we have not used as much information as we would have from an O and D survey and from our earlier work on trip generation. For the same travel pattern in the O-D matrix used before, we would have row and column totals, i.e.:
Consider the way the four folks might travel, 4!/(2!1!1!) = 12; consider three folks, 3!/(0!2!1!) = 3. All travel can be combined in 12×3 = 36 ways. The possible configuration of trips is, thus, seen to be much constrained by the column and row totals.

We put this point together with the earlier work with our matrix and the notion of most likely state to say that we want to

: formula_36

subject to

: formula_37

where:

: formula_38

and this is the problem that we have solved above.

Wilson adds another consideration; he constrains the system to the amount of energy available (i.e., money), and we have the additional constraint,

: formula_39

where &quot;C&quot; is the quantity of resources available and formula_13 is the travel cost from &quot;i&quot; to &quot;j&quot;.

The discussion thus far contains the central ideas in Wilson’s work, but we are not yet to the place where the reader will recognize the model as it is formulated by Wilson.

First, writing the formula_41 function to be maximized using Lagrangian multipliers, we have:

: formula_42

where formula_43 and formula_35 are the Lagrange multipliers, formula_35 having an energy sense.

Second, it is convenient to maximize the natural log (ln) rather than formula_46, for then we may use Stirling&#x27;s approximation.

: formula_47

so

: formula_48

Third, evaluating the maximum, we have

: formula_49

with solution

: formula_50

: formula_51

Finally, substituting this value of formula_2 back into our constraint equations, we have:

: formula_53

and, taking the constant multiples outside of the summation sign

: formula_54

Let

: formula_55

we have

: formula_56

which says that the most probable distribution of trips has a gravity model form, formula_2 is proportional to trip origins and destinations. The constants formula_58, formula_59, and formula_35 ensure that constraints are met.

Turning now to computation, we have a large problem. First, we do not know the value of &quot;C&quot;, which earlier on we said had to do with the money available, it was a cost constraint. Consequently, we have to set formula_35 to different values and then find the best set of values for formula_58 and formula_59. We know what formula_35 means – the greater the value of formula_35, the less the cost of average distance traveled. (Compare formula_35 in Boltzmann&#x27;s Law noted earlier.) Second, the values of formula_58 and formula_59 depend on each other. So for each value of formula_35, we must use an iterative solution. There are computer programs to do this.

Wilson&#x27;s method has been applied to the Lowry model.

== Issues ==

=== Congestion ===

One of the key drawbacks to the application of many early models was the inability to take account of congested travel time on the road network in determining the probability of making a trip between two locations. Although Wohl noted as early as 1963 research into the feedback mechanism or the “interdependencies among assigned or distributed volume, travel time (or travel ‘resistance’) and route or system capacity”, this work has yet to be widely adopted with rigorous tests of convergence, or with a so-called “equilibrium” or “combined” solution (Boyce et al. 1994). Haney (1972) suggests internal assumptions about travel time used to develop demand should be consistent with the output travel times of the route assignment of that demand. While small methodological inconsistencies are necessarily a problem for estimating base year conditions, forecasting becomes even more tenuous without an understanding of the feedback between supply and demand. Initially heuristic methods were developed by Irwin and Von Cube and others, and later formal mathematical programming techniques were established by Suzanne Evans. 

=== Stability of travel times ===
A key point in analyzing feedback is the finding in earlier research that commuting times have remained stable over the past thirty years in the Washington Metropolitan Region, despite significant changes in household income, land use pattern, family structure, and labor force participation. Similar results have been found in the Twin Cities

The stability of travel times and distribution curves over the past three decades gives a good basis for the application of aggregate trip distribution models for relatively long term forecasting. This is not to suggest that there exists a constant travel time budget.

<doc id="1096360" wikidata="Q6294669" url="?curid=1096360" title="Oxygen saturation">
<text>Oxygen saturation (symbol S2) is a relative measure of the concentration of oxygen that is dissolved or carried in a given medium as a proportion of the maximal concentration that can be dissolved in that medium at the given temperature. It can be measured with a dissolved oxygen probe such as an oxygen sensor or an optode in liquid media, usually water. The standard unit of oxygen saturation is percent (%).

Oxygen saturation can be measured regionally and noninvasively. Arterial oxygen saturation (Sa2) is commonly measured using pulse oximetry. Tissue saturation at peripheral scale can be measured using NIRS. This technique can be applied on both muscle and brain.

== In medicine==
In medicine, oxygen saturation refers to &quot;oxygenation&quot;, or when oxygen molecules () enter the tissues of the body. In this case blood is oxygenated in the lungs, where oxygen molecules travel from the air into the blood. Oxygen saturation (() sats) measures the percentage of hemoglobin binding sites in the bloodstream occupied by oxygen. Fish, invertebrates, plants, and aerobic bacteria all require oxygen.

==In environmental science==


In aquatic environments, oxygen saturation is a ratio of the concentration of &quot;dissolved oxygen&quot; (DO, O2), to the maximum amount of oxygen that will dissolve in that water body, at the temperature and pressure which constitute stable equilibrium conditions. Well-aerated water (such as a fast-moving stream) without oxygen producers or consumers is 100% saturated.

Stagnant water can become somewhat supersaturated with oxygen (i.e., reach more than 100% saturation) either because of the presence of photosynthetic aquatic oxygen producers or because of a slow equilibration after a change of atmospheric conditions. Stagnant water in the presence of decaying matter will typically have an oxygen concentration much less than 100%, which is due to anaerobic bacteria being much less efficient at breaking down organic material. Similarly as in water, oxygen concentration also plays a key role in the breakdown of organic matter in soils. Higher oxygen saturation allows aerobic bacteria to persist, which breaks down decaying organic material in soils much more efficiently than anaerobic bacteria. Thus, soils with high oxygen saturation will have less organic matter per volume than those with low oxygen saturation.

Environmental oxygenation can be important to the sustainability of a particular ecosystem. The US Environmental Protection Agency has published a table of maximum equilibrium dissolved oxygen concentration versus temperature at atmospheric pressure. The optimal levels in an estuary for dissolved oxygen is higher than six ppm. Insufficient oxygen (environmental hypoxia), often caused by the decomposition of organic matter and nutrient pollution, may occur in bodies of water such as ponds and rivers, tending to suppress the presence of aerobic organisms such as fish. Deoxygenation increases the relative population of anaerobic organisms such as plants and some bacteria, resulting in fish kills and other adverse events. The net effect is to alter the balance of nature by increasing the concentration of anaerobic over aerobic species.

<text>In mathematical logic, a theory is categorical if it has exactly one model (up to isomorphism). Such a theory can be viewed as &quot;defining&quot; its model, uniquely characterizing the model&#x27;s structure.

In first-order logic, only theories with a finite model can be categorical. Higher-order logic contains categorical theories with an infinite model. For example, the second-order Peano axioms are categorical, having a unique model whose domain is the set of natural numbers formula_1

In model theory, the notion of a categorical theory is refined with respect to cardinality. A theory is -categorical (or categorical in) if it has exactly one model of cardinality up to isomorphism. Morley&#x27;s categoricity theorem is a theorem of stating that if a first-order theory in a countable language is categorical in some uncountable cardinality, then it is categorical in all uncountable cardinalities.

 extended Morley&#x27;s theorem to uncountable languages: if the language has cardinality and a theory is categorical in some uncountable cardinal greater than or equal to then it is categorical in all cardinalities greater than .

==History and motivation==
Oswald Veblen in 1904 defined a theory to be categorical if all of its models are isomorphic. It follows from the definition above and the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem that any first-order theory with a model of infinite cardinality cannot be categorical. One is then immediately led to the more subtle notion of -categoricity, which asks: for which cardinals is there exactly one model of cardinality of the given theory &quot;T&quot; up to isomorphism? This is a deep question and significant progress was only made in 1954 when Jerzy Łoś noticed that, at least for complete theories &quot;T&quot; over countable languages with at least one infinite model, he could only find three ways for &quot;T&quot; to be -categorical at some :

*&quot;T&quot; is totally categorical, &quot;i.e.&quot; &quot;T&quot; is -categorical for all infinite cardinals .
*&quot;T&quot; is uncountably categorical, &quot;i.e.&quot; &quot;T&quot; is -categorical if and only if is an uncountable cardinal.
*&quot;T&quot; is countably categorical, &quot;i.e.&quot; &quot;T&quot; is -categorical if and only if is a countable cardinal.

In other words, he observed that, in all the cases he could think of, -categoricity at any one uncountable cardinal implied -categoricity at all other uncountable cardinals. This observation spurred a great amount of research into the 1960s, eventually culminating in Michael Morley&#x27;s famous result that these are in fact the only possibilities. The theory was subsequently extended and refined by Saharon Shelah in the 1970s and beyond, leading to stability theory and Shelah&#x27;s more general programme of classification theory.

==Examples==
There are not many natural examples of theories that are categorical in some uncountable cardinal. The known examples include:
* Pure identity theory (with no functions, constants, predicates other than &quot;=&quot;, or axioms).
* The classic example is the theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic. Categoricity does &quot;not&quot; say that all algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0 as large as the complex numbers C are the same as C; it only asserts that they are isomorphic &quot;as fields&quot; to C. It follows that although the completed &quot;p&quot;-adic closures C&quot;p&quot; are all isomorphic as fields to C, they may (and in fact do) have completely different topological and analytic properties. The theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic is not categorical in (the countable infinite cardinal); there are models of transcendence degree 0, 1, 2, ..., .
* Vector spaces over a given countable field. This includes abelian groups of given prime exponent (essentially the same as vector spaces over a finite field) and divisible torsion-free abelian groups (essentially the same as vector spaces over the rationals).
* The theory of the set of natural numbers with a successor function.

There are also examples of theories that are categorical in but not categorical in uncountable cardinals. 
The simplest example is the theory of an equivalence relation with exactly two equivalence classes, both of which are infinite. Another example is the theory of dense linear orders with no endpoints; Cantor proved that any such countable linear order is isomorphic to the rational numbers: see Cantor&#x27;s isomorphism theorem.

==Properties==

Every categorical theory is complete. However, the converse does not hold.

Any theory &quot;T&quot; categorical in some infinite cardinal is very close to being complete. More precisely, the Łoś–Vaught test states that if a satisfiable theory has no finite models and is categorical in some infinite cardinal at least equal to the cardinality of its language, then the theory is complete. The reason is that all infinite models are first-order equivalent to some model of cardinal by the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, and so are all equivalent as the theory is categorical in . Therefore, the theory is complete as all models are equivalent. The assumption that the theory have no finite models is necessary.

<doc id="1096412" wikidata="Q6135705" url="?curid=1096412" title="James Hatfield">
<text>James Howard Hatfield (January 7, 1958 – July 18, 2001) was an American author.

== &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; and controversy ==
Hatfield was the author of &quot; Fortunate Son&quot;, a book published in 1999 during the George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000 that made serious allegations about George W. Bush. Published by the highly regarded St. Martin&#x27;s Press, the book was revealed as allegedly fraudulent and recalled by the publisher within days of publication.

Soon after the book&#x27;s release, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; reported that Hatfield was a paroled felon who had been convicted in 1988 of paying a hit man $5,000 to murder his former boss with a car bomb. It was also revealed that Hatfield pleaded guilty to embezzlement in 1992. Hatfield at first denied the allegations when his publisher confronted him, but he eventually owned up to his criminal history.

This was the second time that a book of Hatfield&#x27;s had been challenged. In 1985 he had written an unofficial James Bond novel, &quot;The Killing Zone&quot;, which – although purporting to be officially sanctioned by Glidrose, Bond&#x27;s literary copyright holder – was a vanity novel.

Due to the revelations of Hatfield&#x27;s criminal past and the damage to his credibility, in October 1999, Hatfield&#x27;s publisher, St. Martin&#x27;s Press, recalled 70,000 copies of &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; and left an additional 20,000 books in storage. Even so, the book had already reached the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list. Hatfield responded that before the Bush campaign brought pressure to bear, St. Martin&#x27;s had publicly stated that the book had been &quot;carefully fact-checked and scrutinized by lawyers.&quot;

The book was later republished by Soft Skull Press. The relationship between Sander Hicks, founder of Soft Skull Press, and Hatfield was explored in the movie &quot;Horns and Halos&quot;, an award-winning documentary film directed by Suki Hawley and Michael Galinsky. In one scene from the DVD extra disc, Hatfield says to the camera, &quot;If anything happens to me, get it out to the press.&quot;

== Death ==
According to Detective John Hubbard of the Bentonville, Arkansas Police Department, on July 17, 2001, the Police went to Hatfield&#x27;s house to arrest him on charges of credit card fraud but they were unable to locate him.

On July 18, 2001, Hatfield&#x27;s body was found by a hotel housekeeper in room 312 at a Days Inn in Springdale, Arkansas, an apparent suicide by prescription drug overdose. According to the police, notes were left listing alcohol, financial problems and &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; as reasons for killing himself.

<doc id="1096413" wikidata="Q5147770" url="?curid=1096413" title="Colne Valley">
<text>The Colne Valley is a steep sided valley on the east flank of the Pennine Hills in the English county of West Yorkshire. It takes its name from the River Colne which rises above the town of Marsden and flows eastward towards Huddersfield.

The name is used to describe that section of the valley between its source and Huddersfield at the point where the River Holme joins the Colne. The name can describe the whole valley of the Colne, including the section through Huddersfield its confluence with the River Calder at Cooper Bridge. Using the more common definition, the Colne Valley includes the towns and villages of Marsden, Slaithwaite, Linthwaite, Milnsbridge, Scapegoat Hill, Longwood and Golcar.

==Industry and economy==
The Colne Valley played a significant role in the development of the Industrial Revolution. Most of the population had been hand loom weavers for generations but when water-powered textile mills were built on the streams and rivers, the area was set to become a major producer of textiles. The Colne and the Huddersfield Narrow Canal provided transport links which were added to by road and railway links to Huddersfield and Leeds to the east and Manchester and Liverpool to the west.

By the end of the Second World War, the importance of the Colne Valley as a centre of textile production had begun to decrease and Huddersfield Narrow Canal was largely abandoned in 1944. The area is now primarily residential, its transport links making it ideal for commuters. Tourism is promoted: the Huddersfield Narrow Canal was reopened in 2001 and boat trips into Standedge Canal Tunnel are available; the National Trust advertises walks on Marsden Moor Estate; and television programmes such as &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; and &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; have been filmed there.

==Government and politics==
Colne Valley was an urban district of the West Riding of Yorkshire between 1937 and 1974. It was created by the merger of Golcar, Linthwaite, Marsden, Scammonden and Slaithwaite urban districts, and had a population of about 20,000. The Local Government Act 1972 saw it merged into the metropolitan borough of Kirklees. It is a ward of Kirklees Council, whose population at the 2011 census was 17,369.

The Colne Valley parliamentary constituency preserves the Colne Valley name, although the constituency also includes the Holme Valley, Meltham and the outskirts of Huddersfield. Notable former MPs for the constituency include Victor Grayson and Richard Wainwright. The current MP is Paul Davies - Labour

<doc id="1096420" wikidata="Q283722" url="?curid=1096420" title="Ifconfig">
<text>ifconfig (short for &quot;interface config&quot;) is a system administration utility in Unix-like operating systems for network interface configuration.

The utility is a command-line interface tool and is also used in the system startup scripts of many operating systems. It has features for configuring, controlling, and querying TCP/IP network interface parameters. Ifconfig originally appeared in 4.2BSD as part of the BSD TCP/IP suite.

Many Linux distributions have deprecated ifconfig in favor of tools from iproute2.

==Usage==
Common uses for ifconfig include setting the IP address and subnet mask of a network interface and disabling or enabling an interface. At boot time, many Unix-like operating systems initialize their network interfaces with shell scripts that call ifconfig. As an interactive tool, system administrators routinely use the utility to display and analyze network interface parameters. The following two examples show the output of the tool when querying the state of a single active interface each on a Linux-based host (interface eth0) and the ural0 interface on an OpenBSD installation.

* HWaddr: &quot;hardware address&quot;, MAC address.
* The parameter &quot;txqueuelen&quot; is measured in number of Ethernet frames and is the size of the buffer that is being managed by the network scheduler.

===Medium access control functions===
ifconfig is also commonly used to change the medium access control (MAC) address of an interface. In this process, the network interface is first disabled (set &quot;down&quot;) with the ifconfig command, followed by a MAC change command:
 ifconfig wlan0 down
 ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 13:11:20:33:49:66
 ifconfig wlan0 up

==Release status==
The Berkeley Software Distribution UNIX operating systems (e.g., NetBSD, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD) continue active development of ifconfig and extension of its functionality to cover the configuration of wireless networking interfaces, VLAN trunking, controlling hardware features such as TSO or hardware checksumming or setting up bridge and tunnel interfaces. Solaris has historically used ifconfig for all network interface configuration, but as of Solaris 10 introduced dladm to perform data-link (OSI model layer 2) configuration, reducing ifconfig&#x27;s purview to IP configuration.

In older Linux distributions, ifconfig, in conjunction with the utility route, was used to connect a computer to a network, and to define routes between networks. ifconfig for Linux is part of the package &quot;net-tools&quot;, released as the latest version 2.10 on 7 January 2021.

Many Linux distributions have deprecated the use of ifconfig and route in favor of the software suite iproute2, such as ArchLinux or RHEL since version 7, which has been available since 1999 for Linux 2.2. iproute2 includes support for all common functions of ifconfig(8), route(8), arp(8) and netstat(1). It also includes multicast configuration support, tunnel and virtual link management, traffic control, and low-level IPsec configuration, among other features.

==Related tools==
Another higher-level Linux command line tool is ifup (including ifdown and ifquery). In addition to controlling the interfaces, it also provides control of other aspects of the network such as specifying the DNS servers to use. The command is configured using the file &quot;/etc/network/interfaces&quot;, which contains &quot;stanzas&quot; for each interface.

NetworkManager is a Linux daemon that automatically reconfigures the network in dynamic environments, such as moving between WiFi hotspots. It is usually used in conjunction with a graphical front-end such as GNOME Shell.

Versions of Microsoft Windows from Windows 95 to Windows Me used winipcfg to give a graphical display of current IP information. ipconfig, a command similar to ifconfig, comes with Microsoft operating-systems based on the Windows NT kernel. ipconfig also controls the Windows DHCP client.

In macOS, the ifconfig command functions as a wrapper to the IPConfiguration agent, and can control the BootP and DHCP clients from the command-line. Use of ifconfig to modify network settings in Mac OS X is discouraged, because ifconfig operates below the level of the system frameworks which help manage network configuration.

iwconfig, a component of Wireless tools for Linux, which took its name from ifconfig, manages wireless network interfaces outside the original scope of Linux&#x27;s ifconfig. iwconfig sets such specialized settings as a wireless network&#x27;s SSID and WEP keys, and functions in tandem with iwlist. Linux also features iwspy, to read the signal, noise and quality of a wireless connection.

Other related tools for configuring Ethernet adapters are: ethtool, mii-tool, and mii-diag in Linux and the command &quot;dladm show-link&quot; in Solaris. 

The ip suite has a similar purpose and is meant to replace the deprecated ifconfig.

<doc id="1096425" wikidata="Q3025312" url="?curid=1096425" title="Second Carlist War">
<text>The Second Carlist War, or the War of the Matiners (Catalan for &quot;early-risers,&quot; so-called from the harassing action that took place at the earliest hours of the morning), was a civil war in Spain. Some historians consider it a direct Catalan revolt against Madrid, fought primarily in Catalonia by the Carlists under General Ramón Cabrera against the forces of the government of Isabella II. The uprising began in September 1846 and continued until May 1849, spreading to Galicia.

Theoretically, the war was fought to facilitate the marriage of Isabella II with the Carlist pretender, Carlos Luis de Borbón (or &quot;Carlos VI&quot;), which was supported by some &quot;doctrinaire&quot; elements from the moderate party and by the Carlists. The marriage never took place, as Isabella II was wed to Francisco de Borbón.

The conflict was rather minor in the Basque Country in the Basque context, a central focus of Carlist uprisings, it was non-existent, so &quot;Second Carlist War&quot; invariably refers to the Third Carlist War. It coincided with the democratic Revolutions of 1848, when Maria Christina revoked the constitution of Ramón de Narváez. Narváez himself led the counterattack against the revolt in Galicia while Fernando de Córdova, captain-general of Catalonia, put down the isolated rebel cells in that region by early 1849. In June of that year, amnesty was granted to the Carlists and those who had fled returned.

The war caused between 3,000 and 10,000 casualties.

<doc id="1096437" wikidata="Q7337296" url="?curid=1096437" title="River Colne, West Yorkshire">
<text>The River Colne in West Yorkshire is formed at the confluence of two brooks that originate in the Pennines close to Marsden. It flows in an easterly direction through the Colne Valley and Huddersfield towards Cooper Bridge where it flows into the River Calder.

==Course==
Brooks formed by rainwater high (between 300 and 480 metres AMSL) in the Pennines of West Yorkshire, flow down the hillsides through the small valleys known locally as &quot;cloughs&quot; to fill March Haigh and Redbrook Reservoirs. The Haigh Brook and Redbrook continue down the valley fed by more tributaries, until they converge at a scenic spot called Close Gate or Eastergate Bridge where the River Colne is formed.

The river flows from west to east through the Colne Valley passing through Marsden, Slaithwaite and Milnsbridge to Huddersfield and then on to Cooper Bridge where it feeds the larger River Calder.

Its tributaries include Wessenden Brook, Bradley Brook, Crimble Brook, Mag Brook, Fenay Brook, New Mill Dike and the River Holme.

==History==
Due to the soft, acidic waters of the River Colne and its brooks flowing through the side valleys (cloughs) from the peat moors above, the Colne Valley was renowned for producing some of the highest quality woollen and cotton cloth produced anywhere.

==Infrastructure==
The Huddersfield Narrow Canal follows the course of the river through the valley, as does the Huddersfield Line railway, and the A62 road. The river itself is too shallow and rocky to be navigable by any watercraft.

There are numerous factories, warehouses and plants along the river providing goods, services and jobs, but a few of these cause pollution to the local environment and waterways. In order to help tackle pollution, the Environment Agency demand that certain standards be met by local companies.

On 24 May 2010, part of a chemical factory was accidentally set ablaze and caused waste to be emptied into the river and the canal causing the deaths of many fish.

<text>In political philosophy, the phrase consent of the governed refers to the idea that a government&#x27;s legitimacy and moral right to use state power is justified and lawful only when consented to by the people or society over which that political power is exercised. This theory of consent is starkly contrasted with the divine right of kings and has often been invoked against the legitimacy of colonialism. Article 21 of the United Nations&#x27; 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that &quot;The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government&quot;. Consensus democracy is the application of consensus decision-making and supermajority to democracy.

==History==
The idea that a law derives its validity from the approval of those subject to it can already be found in early Christian author Tertullian, who, in his Apologeticum claims 

The earliest utterance of the specific term &quot;consent of the governed&quot; seemingly appears in the writings of Scottish Catholic priest and Franciscan friar Duns Scotus, who proposed this in his work &quot;Ordinatio&quot; in the 1290s. Scotus&#x27;s lengthy writing in theology have largely overshadowed this notable contribution that he made to early political theory. It is believed these writings influenced the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320. 

In his 1937 book &quot;A History of Political Theory&quot;, George Sabine collected the views of many political theorists on consent of the governed. He notes the idea mentioned in 1433 by Nicholas of Cusa in &quot;De Concordantia Catholica&quot;. In 1579 an influential Huguenot tract &quot;Vindiciae contra tyrannos&quot; was published which Sabine paraphrases: &quot;The people lay down the conditions which the king is bound to fulfill. Hence they are bound to obedience only conditionally, namely, upon receiving the protection of just and lawful government…the power of the ruler is delegated by the people and continues only with their consent.&quot; In England, the Levellers also held to this principle of government.

John Milton wrote
Similarly, Sabine notes the position of John Locke in &quot;Essay concerning Human Understanding&quot;: 
However, with David Hume a contrary voice is heard. Sabine interprets Hume&#x27;s skepticism by noting
Sabine revived the concept from its status as a political myth after Hume, by referring to Thomas Hill Green. Green wrote that government required &quot;will not force&quot; for administration. As put by Sabine,
According to James Feibleman, compliance with law is evidence for consent of the governed:
Consent of the governed, within the social liberalism of T. H. Green, was also described by Paul Harris:
==In the United States of America==
&quot;Consent of the governed&quot; is a phrase found in the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson.

Using thinking similar to that of John Locke, the founders of the United States believed in a state built upon the consent of &quot;free and equal&quot; citizens; a state otherwise conceived would lack legitimacy and rational-legal authority. This was expressed, among other places, in the 2nd paragraph of the Declaration of Independence (emphasis added):

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the , --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

In section 6 of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, written in May, 1776, and passed in June, Founding Father George Mason wrote:

That elections of members to serve as representatives of the people, in assembly, ought to be free; and that all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, the attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage, and cannot be taxed or deprived of their property for public uses without their own consent, or that of their representatives so elected, nor bound by any law to which they have not, in like manner, assented, for the public good.&quot;
Although the Continental Congress at the outset of the American Revolution had no explicit legal authority to govern, it was delegated by the states with all the functions of a national government, such as appointing ambassadors, signing treaties, raising armies, appointing generals, obtaining loans from Europe, issuing paper money (i.e. &quot; continentals&quot;), and disbursing funds. The Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and was required to request money, supplies, and troops from the states to support the war effort. Individual states frequently ignored these requests. According to the &quot;Cyclopædia of Political Science&quot;. New York: Maynard, Merrill, and Co., 1899, commenting on the source of the Congress&#x27; power:
The appointment of the delegates to both these congresses was generally by popular conventions, though in some instances by state assemblies. But in neither case can the appointing body be considered the original depositary of the power by which the delegates acted; for the conventions were either self-appointed &quot;committees of safety&quot; or hastily assembled popular gatherings, including but a small fraction of the population to be represented, and the state assemblies had no right to surrender to another body one atom of the power which had been granted to them or to create a new power which should govern the people without their will. The source of the powers of congress is to be sought solely in the acquiescence of the people, without which every congressional resolution, with or without the benediction of popular conventions or state legislatures, would have been a mere &quot;brutum fulmen&quot;; and, as the congress unquestionably exercised national powers, operating over the whole country, the conclusion is inevitable that the will of the whole people is the source of the national government in the United States, even from its first imperfect appearance in the second continental congress...

The &quot;consent of the governed&quot;, when the Constitution was ratified, was flawed in that it was limited to white men of property.

==Types of consent==

===Unanimous consent===
A key question is whether the unanimous consent of the governed is required; if so, this would imply the right of secession for those who do not want to be governed by a particular collective. All democratic governments today allow decisions to be made even over the dissent of a minority of voters which, in some theorists&#x27; view, calls into question whether said governments can rightfully claim, in all circumstances, to act with the consent of the governed.

===Hypothetical consent===
The theory of hypothetical consent of the governed holds that one&#x27;s obligation to obey government depends on whether the government is such that one &quot;ought&quot; to consent to it, or whether the people, if placed in a state of nature without government, would agree to said government. This theory has been rejected by some scholars, who argue that since government itself can commit aggression, creating a government to safeguard the people from aggression would be similar to the people, if given the choice of what animals to be attacked by, trading &quot;polecats and foxes for a lion&quot;, a trade that they would not make.

===Engineered consent===

According to the propagandist Edward Bernays when discussing public relations techniques that were described in his essay and book &quot;The Engineering of Consent&quot; (1955), the public may be manipulated by its subconscious desires to render votes to a political candidate. Consent thus obtained undermines the legitimacy of government. Bernays claimed that &quot;the basic principle involved is simple but important: If the opinions of the public are to control the government, these opinions must not be controlled by the government.&quot;

Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky in their book, &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; (1988), advanced a propaganda model for the news media in the United States in which coverage of current events was skewed by corporations and the state in order to manufacture the consent of the governed.

<text>Jeffrey John Crowe (born 14 September 1958) is a former New Zealand cricketer. He played Test and One Day International cricket for New Zealand from 1983 to 1990, and first-class cricket for South Australia and then Auckland.

He has been an ICC match referee since 2004.

==Early and personal life==
Crowe was born in Auckland, New Zealand. He is the son of Dave Crowe, and the elder brother of Martin Crowe. The Crowe brothers are cousins of Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe, whose father John Alexander Crowe is the brother of Dave Crowe; their grandfather John Doubleday Crowe, emigrated to New Zealand from Wrexham in Wales. He is also the great-grandson of All Black Francis Jervis (his mother&#x27;s maternal grandfather).

Crowe&#x27;s father played in three first-class cricket matches for Canterbury and Wellington between 1953 and 1957.

==Domestic career==
Crowe began his first-class cricket career at South Australia, where he played from 1977–78 to 1981–82. There was a suggestion that he could play for the Australian cricket team, but he returned to New Zealand in 1982–83 to play for Auckland, with the hope of playing for New Zealand instead. He worked on his fielding, and also occasionally kept wicket.

After a benefit season at Auckland in 1990–91, and one more domestic season, he retired from playing professional cricket at the end of the 1991–92 season.

==International career==
He was born just over 4 years before his younger brother Martin, but he made his Test debut for New Zealand in the First Test against Sri Lanka at Christchurch in March 1983, just over a year after his brother. He scored his maiden Test century (128) in the Third Test against England in Auckland in February 1984.

Playing against the dominant West Indies team in 1984–85, his team was following on 225 runs in arrears in the Fourth Test at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica, in May 1985. Crowe went in at number 3 in the second innings, with the score at 1–13. Against a fierce fast bowling attack that included Courtney Walsh, Malcolm Marshall and Joel Garner, he scored his second Test century (112); but despite his heroics, New Zealand still lost by 10 wickets.

He was captain of the New Zealand cricket team for six Tests – a one-off Test against Sri Lanka at Colombo in April 1987 (when he scored the third and last of his Test centuries, 120 not out in a drawn match) and then three on tour to Australia in December 1987, and finally two at home against England in February 1988. One of the matches against Australia was lost, and the other five were drawn. Crowe played his last Test against Australia at Wellington in March 1990. He also played in 75 ODIs from 1983 to 1990, including the Cricket World Cups in England in 1983 and in India in 1987.

==After cricket==
Crowe was manager of the New Zealand cricket team from 1999 to 2003. He ran a golfing holiday business in Florida for a period, and since 2004 he has been an ICC match referee, including the World Cup finals in 2007 and 2011. He is one of three people to have been referee in more than 75 Tests (the others are Chris Broad and Ranjan Madugalle) and one of four to have been referee in more than 220 ODIs (as well as Crowe, Broad, and Madugalle, the fourth is Roshan Mahanama). In January 2017 he refereed his 250th ODI match, when he officiated the fifth ODI between Australia and Pakistan at the Adelaide Oval.

<text>The Thrawn&quot; trilogy, also known as the Heir to the Empire&quot; trilogy, is a trilogy of novels set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, written by Timothy Zahn between 1991 and 1993. The first book marked the end of a notable drought of new &quot;Star Wars&quot; material over a four-year period, between the 10th anniversary of the original 1977 film&#x27;s release and the release of &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; (1991).

Set approximately five years after the events depicted in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, the trilogy details the offensive campaigns of military genius Grand Admiral Thrawn as he attempts to bring down the recently-founded New Republic in a bid to restore the Galactic Empire to power. In addition to Thrawn, the trilogy introduces several new and notable characters, including Mara Jade and Talon Karrde.

The &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy sold a combined total of 15 million books, with &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; reaching #1 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. The trilogy has been met with critical acclaim, and its success is credited to the creation of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe (EU), with the planet Coruscant from the trilogy later being adapted by George Lucas to his prequel trilogy of &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. 

On the EU&#x27;s 2014 reboot, characters and concepts from the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy were adapted to canon media, with Thrawn appearing in the animated Disney XD series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; (2014) and, later, in the Disney+ live-action series &quot;Ahsoka&quot; (2023), portrayed by Lars Mikkelsen. Rukh, an assassin and bodyguard for Thrawn, appears in &quot;Rebels&quot; as well as &quot;Tales of the Empire&quot; (2022), voiced by veteran Lucasfilm talent Warwick Davis—the original actor behind the Ewok character Wicket W. Warrick in films like &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) and &quot;Caravan of Courage&quot; (1984), among others. Gilad Pellaeon, an Imperial officer, was seen in the third season of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; (2023), portrayed by Xander Berkeley. 

Zahn has also written two additional, alternate &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogies in the new canon—&quot;Thrawn&quot; (2017–2019) and &quot;Thrawn Ascendancy&quot; (2020–2021); he has also consulted on &quot;Ahsoka&quot;.

==Books==
===&quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; (1991)===
In (1991), master tactician Grand Admiral Thrawn plots to destroy the New Republic despite their numerical advantage over the remaining Imperial forces. He sets his sights on the Wayland storehouse of the late Emperor Palpatine, which contains a massive array of Spaarti cloning cylinders and a working cloaking shield. To this end, Thrawn and his subordinate Gilad Pellaeon, captain of the Star Destroyer &quot;Chimaera&quot;, enlist the help of smuggler Talon Karrde and his second-in-command Mara Jade to obtain several salamander-like creatures called ysalamiri. Thrawn uses the ysalamiri, which possess the natural ability to disrupt the Force, to subdue the storehouse&#x27;s guardian Joruus C&#x27;baoth, a twisted clone of a Jedi Master whom the Grand Admiral had killed years before. C&#x27;baoth offers his allegiance in exchange for two acolytes to bend to his will: Darth Vader&#x27;s twin children, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa. Thrawn sends some of his Noghri killers to capture Luke and a pregnant Leia, but their attempts repeatedly fail. Leia defends herself from one attack and is surprised when the Noghri suddenly surrenders. Thrawn launches his first offensive, a series of hit-and-run attacks into New Republic territory, before stealing a complement of mole miners from Lando Calrissian&#x27;s mining operations on Nkllon. In need of warships, and with his previous tactics having forced over 100 lightly crewed ships to be stationed at the Sluis Van shipyards as he planned, Thrawn invades. His stormtroopers use the stolen miners to board and hijack the ships; however, his efforts are thwarted, as Calrissian seizes control of the miners, remotely. Thrawn withdraws his forces; thanks to his plotting, his New Republic nemesis, the Mon Calamari Admiral Ackbar, is subsequently arrested on accusations of treason.

===&quot;Dark Force Rising&quot; (1992)===
In (1992), it is revealed that before the Clone Wars, the Old Republic had constructed a fleet of highly automated heavy cruisers, known as the &quot;Katana&quot; fleet. A virus infected the crews of the entire fleet and drove them insane. The fleet was never seen again until Karrde discovered it (several years before the events of the first book). With access to Palpatine&#x27;s private storehouse on the planet Wayland, Thrawn presses his advantage to marshal more forces for the battle against the New Republic. Mara Jade, in an attempt to exonerate the Empire&#x27;s warrant for Karrde&#x27;s arrest, goes to Thrawn and offers to reveal the location of the &quot;Katana&quot; fleet. Instead, he has her followed and Karrde is captured. Luke and Mara rescue Karrde from Thrawn&#x27;s Star Destroyer as Thrawn attempts to capture another man who knows about the &quot;Katana&quot; fleet. Meanwhile, Leia learns that the Noghri serve the Empire because they revere her late father, Darth Vader, who they believe saved their planet Honoghr from ecological disaster. Leia convinces them that they have been deceived and effectively enslaved by the Empire, and they switch sides. With Ackbar temporarily neutralized as a tactical opponent, Thrawn leads an army of clones to claim the so-called &quot;&quot;Katana&quot; fleet&quot;, outmaneuvering Luke, Lando, and Han Solo.

===&quot;The Last Command&quot; (1993)===
In (1993), set about a month after the previous book, Thrawn uses the &quot;Katana&quot; fleet, crewed with clones, to mount a successful offensive against the New Republic. Seizing one planet after the other, Thrawn soon immobilizes the galactic capital world, Coruscant. He has placed multiple cloaked asteroids around the planet, and through a ruse, he has led the New Republic leadership to believe that Coruscant is surrounded with them. Learning of the deception, the Republic fleet attacks the Imperial shipyards at Bilbringi to capture a device that can find the cloaked asteroids, but Thrawn&#x27;s forces intercept and surround them. Meanwhile, Luke and Leia lead a group to destroy the cloning facility on Wayland, killing C&#x27;baoth and destroying the cloning cylinders. Just as Thrawn and Pellaeon learn that the Noghri aided in the attack on Wayland, Thrawn&#x27;s Noghri bodyguard, Rukh, kills the Grand Admiral—whose last words are, &quot;But ... it was so artistically done.&quot; The tide of battle at Bilbringi turns, and with the hope of victory dashed by Thrawn&#x27;s death, Pellaeon orders the Imperial forces to retreat.

==Development==
The idea for a post-film trilogy was conceived by Lou Aronica, an editor at Bantam Books who proposed a series as &quot;ambitious as the films were&quot;. Lucas was initially skeptical of the proposal, but acquiesced; Bantam Spectra then brought Timothy Zahn on board to write the trilogy.

Zahn was given freedom to develop the direction the story should go in, with minimal pushback from Lucasfilm. Before starting work on the books, Zahn was only given two rules: the series had to take place three to five years after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, and no characters killed in the films could return. Changes requested by Lucasfilm included changing an evil clone of Obi-Wan Kenobi to the new character of Joruus C&#x27;baoth and the renaming of Rukh&#x27;s species from Sith to Noghri. In order to provide him with existing worldbuilding material, Lucasfilm supplied Zahn with supplementary content from the tabletop RPG &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot;.

When conceiving of the antagonist for the series, Zahn desired a villain who was less brutal than Darth Vader or Emperor Palpatine. Instead, Zahn sought inspiration from military commanders throughout history and envisaged an adversary who could outsmart the protagonists. In creating the character of Thrawn, Timothy Zahn said:

I think it’s because he was so different from any other villain we’d seen in Star Wars to that time. Most Imperials seemed to follow the “hit it with a rock” school of thought regarding opposition. Thrawn, in contrast, used strategy and careful planning and usually managed to be two or three steps ahead of the New Republic.

Readers like their villains to be a challenge to the heroes because that forces the heroes to bring their best game to the field. The more clever the opponent, and the more difficult the fight, the more satisfying the victory.

The original, working title for &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; was &quot;Wild Card&quot;, which was rejected by Lucasfilm because they believed it was too similar to Bantam&#x27;s &quot;Wild Cards&quot; series. The alternate name &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Hand&quot; was also rejected. &quot;Warlord&#x27;s Gambit&quot; was also a potential title, but ultimately &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; was chosen, which according to Zahn was suggested by Aronica.

==Adaptations==
Denis Lawson, who portrayed Wedge Antilles in the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, narrates the abridged audiobook of &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;, and Anthony Daniels, who portrayed C-3PO in every &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, narrates &quot;Dark Force Rising&quot; and &quot;The Last Command&quot;. Lucasfilm and Varèse Sarabande Records producer Robert Townson discussed the creation of a score to promote the trilogy. All three books were adapted as comic books by Dark Horse Comics between 1995 and 1998. The series was divided into six issues per book, written by Mike Baron, who says, &quot;I didn&#x27;t invent any language. All the language is Zahn&#x27;s.&quot; The first volume was illustrated by French artists Olivier Vatine and Fred Blanchard, the second by Terry Dodson and Kevin Nowlan, and the third by Edvin Biuković and Eric Shanower. The entire trilogy was collected in 2009 as a single graphic novel. In 2011, a 20-year anniversary edition of the book was published, which included an introduction and annotations by Timothy Zahn, commentary by Lucasfilm and Del Rey books, and a new novella centered around the character of Thrawn. For the trilogy&#x27;s 20th anniversary, &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;, &quot;Dark Force Rising&quot; and &quot;The Last Command&quot; would be granted brand new unabridged audiobook productions, narrated by Marc Thompson and featuring official Star Wars music and sound effects.

Each novel in the trilogy had its own &quot;Star Wars&quot; role-playing game sourcebook created for it by West End Games. When the rules for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; RPG changed the three volumes were collected into one book for the entire &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy which also served as a second edition to the original three sourcebooks. According to Zahn, the writing of the trilogy was coordinated with preexisting West End Games materials (at the behest of Lucasfilm). Also, &quot;They filled in a bunch of gaps I hadn&#x27;t got around to filling in.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; reached #1 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, and the trilogy sold a combined total of 15 million copies. The trilogy has been called &quot;influential, much-loved, and ground breaking&quot;. In August 2011, the series was voted into NPR&#x27;s top 100 science-fiction and fantasy books (coming in at place 88), as voted on by over 60,000 participants. Writing for Tor.com, Ryan Britt stated that the &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; was closer to traditional science fiction rather than the epic space fantasy Star Wars was known for; he also compliments the character of Mara Jade for improving the perception of female characters in the franchise and not adhering to &quot;damsel in distress&quot; stereotypes. Zahn&#x27;s use of supplementary material from &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot; has been credited for creating a sense of unity between different publications, allowing for a more believable shared universe.

Some reviews have been more critical, with prolific fansite author Jonathan Hicks saying that the Force is trivialised and that there were too many references to the original movies, in a 2000 review republished by starwars.com.

The trilogy allowed Lucasfilm to expand its non-film media into the mainstream, as opposed to the more niche comic book and role-playing game markets it was previously focusing on. The success of the series prompted Lucasfilm to immediately commission more books to continue the &quot;Star Wars&quot; story.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy is widely credited with revitalizing the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, although Zahn himself was skeptical of this. In &quot;The Secret History of Star Wars&quot;, Michael Kaminski suggests that this renewed interest was a factor in George Lucas&#x27; decision to create the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The trilogy&#x27;s success has been cited as beginning the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe.

Zahn would go on to write a pair of sequel books, in the &quot;Hand of Thrawn&quot; duology (&quot;Specter of the Past&quot; (1997) and &quot;Vision of the Future&quot; (1998)), expanding on the background of the Thrawn character. He would later develop Thrawn&#x27;s legacy further by writing &quot;Survivor&#x27;s Quest&quot; (2004), and subsequently the prequel novel &quot;Outbound Flight&quot; (2006).

Although Lucas did not consider the Expanded Universe to be canonical, he adopted the name Coruscant for the galactic capital in the prequel trilogy, which was created by Zahn in the &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;. While the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy was rendered noncanonical following the Disney acquisition of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, the character of Thrawn was later re-canonized by Lucasfilm when he was introduced on &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, voiced by Lars Mikkelsen, in which Rukh also appeared, voiced by Warwick Davis. Zahn returned soon after to write an alternate trilogy surrounding the Thrawn character, in &quot;Star Wars: Thrawn&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2018), and &quot;&quot; (2019), and later a prequel trilogy about the character in the &quot;Ascendency&quot; trilogy. Zahn consulted on Thrawn&#x27;s adaptation to live-action in the television series &quot;Ahsoka&quot;, with Mikkelsen reprising his role as Thrawn from &quot;Rebels&quot;. Gilad Pellaeon also made his live-action and &quot;Star Wars&quot; canon debut in the third season of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, portrayed by Xander Berkeley.

<doc id="1096465" wikidata="Q707700" url="?curid=1096465" title="Radio Yerevan joke">
<text>In the Soviet Union and the former Communist Eastern bloc countries, a popular type of humour emerged in the 1950s and 1960s featuring the fictional broadcaster called the Armenian Radio () in the USSR and Radio Yerevan elsewhere. These jokes are typically structured in a question-and-answer session with what would purportedly be the host of the actual Armenian Radio but which would often touch topics that would be sensitive for the Communist authorities or which would otherwise be liable for censorship.

Radio Yerevan jokes likely appeared from &quot;Armenian riddles&quot;, a kind of absurdist Russian joke that was particularly popular in the post-World War II years. By the late 1950s, these jokes increasingly became political in nature and were actively lampooning the realities of the Soviet people, such as the lack of civil liberties, shortages, poor quality of household items, as well as satirizing Communist propaganda clichés. However, many of the jokes referred to other aspects of life, particularly sexual matters, and in the Soviet Union, also to stereotypical representations of Armenians. Warsaw Pact countries evolved their own nuances of Radio Yerevan jokes, such as the answers of East German ones often starting with . Few jokes from this cycle have been created since the fall of Communism in these states.

== History ==

Many types of question-and-answer jokes exist, and they are pretty much universal across cultures, such as lightbulb jokes. Some however, are more specific to one culture, such as elephant jokes that were an American fad in the 1960s. In the Soviet Union, a peculiar type of such jokes appeared that involved not the narrator but a fictional entity called the Armenian Radio. Despite the name, at the beginning, the Armenian Radio jokes were an ethnic Russian phenomenon. They are not really related to Armenian culture, nor do they have much in common with radio specifically. Shmelev &quot;et al.&quot; explain that the choice of the narrator was not coincidental and can be traced to &quot;Armenian riddles&quot; that existed since the early 20th century and featured weird questions followed by absurd answers. One of the more famous such riddles is about a herring:

Armenian riddles, in their turn, likely were preceded by Russian jokes popular in early 20th century that featured an Armenian, or a Georgian, answering questions (that were often asked by the Armenian/Georgian himself) in a silly way. Emil Draitser generally concurs with the assessment, further adding that the Armenian riddles saw a revival in the immediate post-World War II years. First &quot;Armenian Radio&quot; jokes themselves appeared either in late 1950s or in the 1960s. The &quot;radio&quot; part was likely chosen because at the time of their appearance, radio was the most popular mass media outlet in the Soviet Union and also because radio stations often scheduled programs during which hosts answered questions purportedly mailed by radio listeners (though virtually everybody suspected the questions were written by hosts themselves so as to give ideologically appropriate answers to them). An alternative explanation relies on an apocryphal story suggesting that a host of an actual Radio Yerevan made a gaffe during a program when saying that &quot;In a capitalist society, man exploits man, but in a Communist society it&#x27;s the other way round.&quot;

The rise of Armenian Radio jokes in particular, or Communist jokes in general, could be attributed to more lenient attitudes towards manifestations of &quot;anti-Soviet agitation&quot;. During Stalin&#x27;s rule, doing that could land a jokester in a Gulag or prison; in the early Khrushchev years, people were still sentenced to prison time for such offences, but by early 1960s all Communist states abandoned prosecution and arrests for such low-key dissent. At the same time, Communist propaganda, poor quality of life and (in Soviet satellite states) &quot;de facto&quot; lack of sovereignty made for ripe targets for satire. Another factor was that the Communist-approved mass media produced little of humour content, so much of the jokes circulating in public were not state-sanctioned and were created on the go by the people themselves.

New Armenian Radio jokes generally stopped appearing by the late 1980s, but some are still occasionally created today.

== Themes ==
The common feature of Radio Yerevan jokes is presenting a rather provocative or absurd question, followed by a witty answer. Armenian Radio jokes are diverse in their topics. There are, however, some similarities. More than half of Russian jokes start with &quot;May&quot; or &quot;Can&quot; questions, which are in general not Rhetorical. When asked about suggested conduct, &quot;Should&quot; is often used at the beginning, as in &quot;Should a Communist pay party dues from a bribe?&quot; (Answer: If they are honest, they should.) Answers are varied but even in a seemingly innocuous question, Radio Yerevan will generally find a risqué answer with an either political or sexual subtext. For a political example, Radio Yerevan defined a string quartet as the &quot;Moscow&#x27;s symphonic orchestra as it returns from a concert tour abroad&quot;, a snide remark referring to highly educated Soviet citizens migrating to the West.

In fact, many Radio Yerevan jokes are political in nature. In these cases, the radio conveys the opinion of a typical Soviet man cynical of the Soviet government. They are a veiled criticism or satire on poor quality of life that is at odds with assurances from the propaganda apparatus. The jokes will sometimes mock Communist propaganda clichés, as in agreeing that the United States are on the edge of the precipice, but &quot;the Soviets are a step ahead of them&quot;. These jokes will also make puns of the lack of civil liberties. The answer will often seemingly agree with the listener at first but then also introduce the &quot;but&quot; that completely turns the initial answer on its head. For example:

:Listener: Is it true that socialism is the shining example of the golden age?
:Radio Yerevan: Indeed, but all that glitters is not gold.

Particularly in Russian, the remainder of the jokes typically revolve around sexual matters (e.g. &quot;What to do if my dick will only point to my shoes?&quot; &quot;Put them on top of a cupboard&quot;), sometimes portraying the (Armenian) host as having a predilection for homosexuality, pedophilia and fat women. Some jokes will also refer to laziness and/or attempts to earn money outside the official (Soviet) economy. There are also ethnic jokes referring to traits stereotypically ascribed to Armenians, such as tensions with neighbouring Georgia and Azerbaijan, and Armenian nationalism:

:What is the most beautiful city in the Soviet Union?
:Yerevan, obviously.
:How many nuclear bombs will it take to destroy Yerevan?
:Baku is also a beautiful city.

<doc id="1096473" wikidata="Q466816" url="?curid=1096473" title="The Last Command (1928 film)">
<text>The Last Command is a 1928 American silent romantic drama film directed by Josef von Sternberg, and written by John F. Goodrich and Herman J. Mankiewicz from a story by Lajos Bíró. The film stars Emil Jannings, who won the first Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the 1929 ceremony for his performances in this film and &quot;The Way of All Flesh,&quot; the only year multiple roles were considered. Evelyn Brent and William Powell co-star.

In 2006, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for the National Film Registry.

== Plot==

In 1928 Hollywood, director Leo Andreyev looks through photographs for actors for his next movie. When he comes to the picture of an aged Sergius Alexander, he pauses, then tells his assistant to cast the man. Sergius shows up at the Eureka Studio with a horde of other extras and is issued a general&#x27;s uniform. As he is dressing, another actor complains that his continual head twitching is distracting. Sergius apologizes and explains that it is the result of a great shock he once experienced.

The film then flashes back ten years to Czarist Russia, which is in the midst of the Revolution. Grand Duke Sergius Alexander, the Czar&#x27;s cousin and commander of all his armies, is informed by his adjutant that two actors entertaining the troops have been identified as dangerous &quot;revolutionists&quot; during a routine passport check. He decides to toy with them for his amusement. When one of them, Leo Andreyev, becomes insolent, Sergius whips him across the face and has him jailed.

Leo&#x27;s companion, the beautiful Natalie Dabrova, is an entirely different matter. She intrigues Sergius. Despite the danger she poses, he takes her along with him. After a week, he gives her a pearl necklace as a token of his feelings for her. She comes to realize that he is at heart a man of great honor who loves Russia as deeply as she does. When she invites him to her room, he spots a partially hidden pistol, but deliberately turns his back to her. She draws the weapon, but cannot fire. Despite their political differences, she has fallen in love with him.

When the Bolsheviks capture the train on which they are traveling, she pretends to despise him. Instead of having him shot out of hand like his officers, she suggests they have him stoke coal into the locomotive all the way to Petrograd, where he will be publicly hanged. This is a ruse to keep him alive and, when everyone on board is drunk, she helps him escape, giving him back the pearl necklace to finance his way out of the country. Sergius jumps from the train, then watches in horror as it tumbles off a nearby bridge into the icy river below, taking Natalie with it. This moment is when Sergius develops his head twitch.

Ten years later, Sergius is reduced to poverty, eking out a living as a Hollywood extra. When he and the director finally meet, Sergius recognizes him. Leo, in an ironic act calculated to humiliate him, casts him as a Russian general in a battle scene. He is directed to give a speech to a group of actors playing his dispirited men. When one soldier tries to incite a mutiny, telling the general that &quot;you&#x27;ve given your last command&quot;, he whips the man in the face as instructed, just as he had once struck Leo. Losing his grip on reality, he imagines himself genuinely on the battlefield, besieged by enemies, and passionately urges his men to fight for Russia. Overstraining himself, he dies, inquiring with his last words if they have won. Moved, Leo tells him they have. The assistant remarks, &quot;That guy was a great actor.&quot; Leo replies, &quot;He was more than a great actor – he was a great man.&quot;

==Background==

Proving the Hollywood adage that movie directors are &quot;only as good as their last picture&quot;, Sternberg was given a free hand by Paramount when &quot;Underworld&quot; (1927) proved to be &quot;an instant success&quot;.

The following three years experienced the industry-wide transition from silent to sound technology, during which Sternberg completed &quot;The Last Command&quot; (1928), &quot;The Drag Net&quot; (1929) and &quot;The Case of Lena Smith&quot; (1929), his last silent works, and his first talkie, &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;, in 1929. Though these films were praised by critics for their distinct style, none achieved great box-office success.

Before embarking on &quot;The Last Command&quot;, Paramount tasked Sternberg with editing portions of director Erich von Stroheim’s &quot;The Wedding March&quot; (1928), as well as writing the screenplay for director Mauritz Stiller’s &quot;The Street of Sin&quot;.

Ernst Lubitsch told newspaper columnist Gilbert Swan that the background story for &quot;The Last Command&quot; had a real-life inspiration: a General in the Imperial Russian Army named Theodore A. Lodijensky whom Lubitsch had met in Russia, and again in New York, where he had opened a Russian restaurant after fleeing the communist revolution. Lubitsch encountered the ex-general once more, when the latter appeared in full uniform looking for work as an extra at $7.50 a day, the same rate as Sergius. Lubitsch later told Lajos Bíró the anecdote. Under the name Theodore Lodi, Lodijensky went on to play a handful of roles between 1929 and 1935, including Grand Duke Michael, a Russian exile who is forced to work as a hotel doorman in the 1932 film &quot;Down to Earth&quot;.

==Production==

In 1927, Paramount’s sister film company in Germany, Ufa, yielded its foremost actor Emil Jannings and producer Erich Pommer to make a number of movies in Hollywood. Sternberg and Jannings had established a friendly rapport when they met in Berlin in 1925.

Jannings starred in director Ernst Lubitsch’s &quot;The Patriot&quot; and in Victor Fleming’s &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;, but his performance in &quot;The Last Command&quot; surpassed these two productions.

The source of the script for the film has been termed “somewhat controversial”. Paramount attributed the original story entitled “The General” to screenwriter Lajos Bíró, the scenario to John S. Goodrich, and the titles to Herman J. Mankiewicz. Nevertheless, Sternberg&#x27;s significant additions and alterations to the plot are “incontestable” and form the basis of his claim to “ultimate authorship” of this cinematic &quot;masterpiece.&quot;
&quot;The Last Command&quot; was among “the most ambitious Sternberg ever shot”. The shooting was completed in five weeks.

The release of &quot;The Last Command&quot; was stalled when Paramount executives reviewed the film and discovered that Sternberg had inserted material portraying Hollywood as heartless and cynical. They further complained that he had historically misrepresented the Russian Revolution, including &quot;recognizable portraits of Trotsky and the young Stalin&quot;. Only under duress from a wealthy Paramount stockholder did the studio relent and distribute the film. This was the &quot;only time in his career that Sternberg confronted his own craft as a subject.&quot;

==Reception==
Despite opening to “remarkable critical success” and eliciting “ecstatic reviews”, the box-office profits never materialized.

American playwright and filmmaker Preston Sturges declared &quot;The Last Command&quot; &quot;perhaps the only perfect picture he had ever seen.&quot;

Despite its &quot;commercial failure&quot; the movie garnered a nomination for Best Original story, and Emil Jannings took the Oscar for Best Performance at the 1st Academy Awards.

Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded &quot;The Last Command&quot; four out of four stars, calling it &quot;A fascinating story laced with keen perceptions of life and work in Hollywood.

The themes presented in &quot;The Last Command&quot; reflect Sternberg’s obsession as a film poet, exhibiting “a continuous stream of emotional autobiography” and “ most strikingly defines the importance for Sternberg of the intertwined themes of desire, power and instability of identity.” 

Jannings’ General Sergius Alexander, an imperious member of the Russian Czar&#x27;s royal family, is punished for his arrogance – not once, but twice: first stripped of prestige and power by the Bolshevik Revolution, and then reduced to a Hollywood extra performing a burlesque of his former stature. Flashback sequences reveal his precipitous descent, a fate that provided Jannings with the opportunity to exhibit “the extremes of his talent.”

In this “saga of decline and fall” – the most &quot;Pirandellian&quot; of Sternberg&#x27;s films – the characters engage in a “desperate struggle for psychic survival [which] grants them a measure of heroic stature and stoic calm.”

In a “performance of remarkable depth”, Evylen Brent&#x27;s Bolshevik Revolutionary Natacha Dabrova develops “a relationship with Jannings as complex as anything in modern cinema.” 
On Sternberg&#x27;s handling of Brent&#x27;s Natacha, Film historian Andrew Sarris wrote: “[She], like all Sternbergian women, remains enigmatic beyond the demands of the plot. Her perverse nature operates beyond good and evil, beyond the convenient categories of virgins and vamps. What is unusual about Sternberg’s direction is that…he seeks to control performances not for the sake of simplicity, but for the sake of complexity.” 

Sarris concludes his thematic analysis with this paradox:

===Home media===
In 2010, The Criterion Collection released a DVD set titled, &quot;3 Silent Classics by Josef von Sternberg&quot; containing &quot;The Last Command&quot;, &quot;Underworld&quot; and &quot;The Docks of New York&quot;.

The film&#x27;s copyright was renewed, and therefore it did not fall into the public domain in the United States until 2024.

<doc id="1096474" wikidata="Q1089219" url="?curid=1096474" title="Chuckwagon">
<text>A chuckwagon, or chuck wagon, is a horse-drawn wagon operating as a mobile field kitchen and frequently covered with a white tarp, also called a camp wagon or round-up wagon. It was historically used for the storage and transportation of food and cooking equipment on the prairies of the United States and Canada. They were included in wagon trains for settlers and traveling workers such as cowboys or loggers. In modern times, chuckwagons feature in special cooking competitions and events. Chuckwagons are also used in a type of competition known as chuckwagon racing.

== History and description ==
While some form of mobile kitchens had existed for generations, the invention of the chuckwagon is attributed to Charles Goodnight, a Texas rancher known as the &quot;father of the Texas Panhandle,&quot; who introduced the concept in 1866. After the American Civil War, the beef market in Texas expanded. Some cattlemen herded cattle in parts of the country that did not have railroads, requiring them to be fed on the road for months at a time. Goodnight modified a Studebaker-manufactured covered wagon, a durable Civil War army-surplus wagon, to suit the needs of cowboys driving cattle from Texas to sell in New Mexico. He added a &quot;chuck box&quot; to the back of the wagon, with drawers and shelves for storage space and a hinged lid to provide a flat working surface. A water barrel was also attached to the wagon and canvas was hung underneath to carry firewood. A wagon box was used to store cooking supplies and cowboys&#x27; personal items.

Chuckwagon food typically included easy-to-preserve items such as baked beans, salted meats, coffee, and sourdough biscuits. Food would also be gathered &quot;en route&quot;. There were no fresh fruit, vegetables, or eggs available, and meat was not fresh unless an animal was injured during the drive and therefore had to be killed. The meats were greasy cloth-wrapped bacon, salt pork, and beef, usually dried, salted or smoked. On cattle drives, it was common for the &quot;cookie&quot; who ran the wagon to be second in authority only to the &quot;trailboss.&quot; The cookie would often act as cook, barber, dentist, and banker.

Doug Hansen, a contemporary restorer of old chuckwagons and maker of replicas, describes a chuck wagon as &quot;a factory made-vehicle that [was] retrofitted with the chuck wagon equipment, to support a cowboss and his dozen wranglers in a cross-country trek.&quot; He says it takes about 750 man-hours to construct a new chuckwagon.

== Contemporary use ==
The American Chuck Wagon Association was formed in 1997 to &quot;preserve the heritage of the chuck wagon&quot; including educating the public and promoting chuckwagon activities. They document chuckwagon heritage including equipment, food, cooking styles, campsites, and clothing, and keep a registry of wagons. Its members participate in chuckwagon cook-off competitions throughout the US where teams are judged on their cooking as well as the authenticity of their vehicle.

The Academy of Western Artists presents an annual award for outstanding chuckwagon cooking, as well as honors in other fields relating to the culture of the American cowboy.

Chuckwagon cook-offs are typically annual events open to the public—some drawing over 1,000 attendees—and private events may hire chuckwagon caterers. Chuckwagon suppers are held across the traditional cattle ranges of the Western United States and Western Canada, either on their own or as part of a trail ride or stay at a dude ranch.

== Chuckwagon races ==

Chuckwagon racing is an event at some rodeos, such as the Calgary Stampede which started in 1923. Chuckwagon races were held from 1952 until 1998 at Cheyenne Frontier Days, one of America&#x27;s biggest rodeos. The National Championship Chuckwagon Race in Clinton, Arkansas draws tens of thousands each Labor Day weekend.

These competitions use modern stripped-down versions of chuckwagons usually pulled by a team of four horses. The driver and his outriders &quot;break camp&quot; by tossing a barrel (the &#x27;stove&#x27;) and some &#x27;tent poles&#x27; into the wagon, complete a figure eight around two barrels, then circle a race track. The outriders and all equipment must finish the race course along with the chuckwagon.

<text>Pierre Blais (born December 30, 1948) is a Canadian jurist and former politician and Cabinet minister. He also served as the Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Appeal until his retirement in June 2014.

On May 1, 2015, Blais was appointed as chairman of the Security Intelligence Review Committee by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, replacing Interim Chair Deborah Grey who was stepping down from the Committee. The SIRC was dissolved on July 19, 2019, with the creation of the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency. Blais served as a member of the NSIRA until his term expired on May 1, 2020.

==Education==

Blais holds both a BA (1968) and an LLL (1976) from Laval University.

==Political career==

Blais entered the House of Commons of Canada as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Bellechasse, Quebec through the 1984 election.

In 1987, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney appointed Blais to Cabinet as Minister of State for agriculture. Two years later, he was promoted to the position of Solicitor-General. In 1990, he became Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and, in 1993, was appointed by Mulroney to the position of Minister of Justice.

Blais retained this position, and added the position of President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada when Kim Campbell succeeded Mulroney as PC leader and prime minister.

Blais&#x27;s political career came to an end when he was defeated, along with the Campbell government, in the 1993 election.

==Judicial career==

A member of both the Quebec and Ontario bar, Blais was appointed a Justice of the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division, an &quot;ex officio member&quot; of the Court of Appeal and Judge of the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada in June 1998.

Through 2004, Blais presided over hearings related to Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel&#x27;s detention under a National Security Certificate. In February 2005, he ruled that the security certificate was valid and that the government could deport Zundel immediately.

On February 20, 2008, Blais was appointed to the Federal Court of Appeal. On September 9, 2009, he was appointed chief justice of the Federal Court of Appeal.

Blais retired as Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Appeal effective June 23, 2014.

<text>The Gnome-Mobile is a 1967 American fantasy comedy film directed by Robert Stevenson and produced by Walt Disney Productions. Based on the 1936 book &quot;The Gnomobile&quot; by Upton Sinclair, it was one of the last films personally supervised by Walt Disney. Walter Brennan is dual cast as D.J. Mulrooney, the kind-hearted lumber tycoon of Irish descent, and as the irascible 943-year-old gnome Knobby. The film crosses genres &quot;between a comedy, a romance, a drama, and an environmental critique&quot;. Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber, previously the Banks children in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), portray Mulrooney&#x27;s grandchildren Elizabeth and Rodney. Tom Lowell, as the gnome Jasper, Richard Deacon, and Sean McClory round out the cast.

Richard and Robert Sherman contributed the title song. The film marked the final roles for both Matthew Garber and Ed Wynn. &quot;The Gnome-Mobile&quot; was re-released theatrically on November 5, 1976.

== Plot ==
The story opens with the children&#x27;s grandfather, D.J. Mulrooney, a well-known executive officer of a timber-trading company. D.J. is going to Seattle to sell 50,000 acres of timberland and takes his customized 1930 Rolls-Royce Phantom II on the trip. In a brief conversation with his company&#x27;s head of security, Ralph Yarby, it is revealed that the car was purchased after D.J. earned his first million dollars. His first stop is the airport, where he picks up his grandchildren, 10-year-old Elizabeth and 8-year-old Rodney, who are to accompany D.J. on his trip to Seattle.

Traveling north from San Francisco, the trio detour through what later became Redwood National Park where D.J. has endowed a grove of Redwood trees, entitled &quot;Mulrooney Grove&quot;. There they encounter a gnome called Jasper, who has &quot;a terrible problem&quot;. They also are introduced to Jasper&#x27;s 943-year-old grandfather Knobby who, like D.J., is passionate and short-tempered. Jasper&#x27;s &quot;terrible problem&quot; is that Knobby is suffering from a sickness called &quot;fading&quot;, or becoming semi-transparent. D.J. diagnoses this as Knobby losing the will to live. The reason for this &quot;fading&quot; is that Knobby fears that he and Jasper are the last two of their Gnome kind, and Knobby wants Jasper to find a bride before Knobby dies. Knobby harbors immense hatred for humans because of their logging damage to the forests and the livelihood of gnomes. D.J. Mulrooney is startled when Knobby exclaims that the worst loggers were &quot;Mulrooney&#x27;s Marauders&quot;, but the gnomes agree to go along with the trio and seek other gnomes. As they leave together, the children rename the Rolls-Royce &quot;the Gnome-Mobile&quot;.

Jasper and his grandfather are kidnapped by Horatio Quaxton, a freak show owner, while D.J. is committed to an asylum by Yarby, who has heard about the gnomes and deems his boss insane. Rodney and Elizabeth rescue D.J. from the asylum, rescue Jasper from Quaxton, and then set out to find Knobby, who had managed to escape earlier.

They arrive in the woods to find Knobby delighted with the presence of a thriving community of gnomes. Jasper is recognized by Rufus the Gnome King as &quot;the eligible gnome&quot; to a large number of young females of his race, who compete in a contest to determine which one will marry him. He is smitten with one timid, lovely girl gnome named Shy Violet, who is very clumsy and very innocent, even though she is hated by all of the other girl gnomes. Jasper tries to get Violet to catch him, but she keeps getting pushed to the side and run over by the other very aggressive girl gnomes. However, after a very wild chase, Violet manages to win the race and she and Jasper get married.

D.J. gives as a wedding present the rights to the 50,000 acres of forest that were to be sold for logging, which become a haven for the gnomes.

==Reception==
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, calling the special effects &quot;fascinating&quot; and reporting that the kids in the audience &quot;got their money&#x27;s worth&quot;. Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a good-natured but heavy-handed little comedy&quot;, finding that &quot;the action and light-hearted spirit sag under a crisscross jumble of slapstick and broadly handled locomotion that flattens the fun&quot;. Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;amusing, if somewhat uneven&quot;. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The moppet audience for which &#x27;The Gnome-Mobile&#x27; is intended will obviously find it a delight, funny and ingenious. The full-sized among us will find a few laughs, too, but cannot rank the film with Disney&#x27;s best by a long shot, or a gnome shot&quot;. &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called it &quot;a whimsical fantasy in the Disney tradition of clean, honest fun, with a merrily tuneful title song, moderately ingenious trick work, and some unsophisticated comedy of which the highlight is a car chase in which the aristocratic old Rolls is pursued by a modern vehicle which bit by bit falls to pieces&quot;.

Film critic Leonard Maltin rates this as one of Disney&#x27;s best comedy-fantasy films, and states that it is a &quot;mystery&quot; why the film is not better known. He says it deserves to be rediscovered and enjoyed by a new generation, especially younger children.

<text>Schwabach () is a German city of about 40,000 inhabitants near Nuremberg in the centre of the region of Franconia in the north of Bavaria. Together with the neighboring cities of Nuremberg, Fürth and Erlangen, Schwabach forms one of the three metropolitan areas in Bavaria. The city is an autonomous administrative district (&quot;kreisfreie Stadt&quot;). Schwabach is also the name of the river which runs through the city prior to joining the Rednitz.

Schwabach is famous for its crafts made of gold, particularly gold foil. In 2004, Schwabach celebrated this tradition with an anniversary festival, marking &quot;500 years gold foil in Schwabach&quot;.

Around 1500, a local typesetter developed the &quot;Schwabacher&quot; font. This font was used for printing the first Bible in German, which had been worked out by Martin Luther.

==Etymology==

The name derives from the old Franconian name &quot;Suapaha&quot; (later &quot;Suabaha&quot;, then &quot;Villa Suabach&quot;) which translates as &quot;Schwaben-Bach&quot; in modern German, which means &quot;Swabian stream&quot;, the first part of the name was given by the Franconians who came to the area about a millennium after the Hallstatt culture to the people living on the banks of that stream, which were perceived as &quot;Swabians&quot; by them, while the second part of the name is a reference to the stream which flows through the city.

<text>William Warner (1558?9 March 1609) was an English poet and lawyer.

==Life==

William Warner was born in London about 1558. In his later published work, &quot;Albion&#x27;s England&quot;, Warner describes his father accompanying explorer Richard Chancellor on a voyage to Russia in 1553 and dying on a voyage to The Guianas in 1557. The 17th century antiquarian Anthony Wood states that Warner was educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, but there are no records to support this, or that he took a degree there. He practised in London as an attorney, and gained a great reputation among his contemporaries as a poet. He married Anne Dale in 1599 and their son William was born at Ware, Hertfordshire in 1604. Warner died suddenly at Great Amwell in Hertfordshire on 9 March 1609.

==Works==

His chief work is a long poem in fourteen-syllabled verse, entitled &quot;Albion&#x27;s England&quot; (1586), and dedicated to Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon. His history of his country begins with Noah, and is brought down to Warner&#x27;s own time including the beheading of Mary, Queen of Scots. The chronicle is by no means continuous, and is varied by fictitious episodes, the best known of which is the idyll in the fourth book of the loves of Argentine, the daughter of the king of Deira, and the Danish prince, Curan.

His book, with its patriotic subject, was very popular. Francis Meres ranked him with Spenser as the chief heroical poets of the day, and compared him with Euripides.

His other works are &quot;Pan his Syrinx, or Pipe, Compact of Seven Reedes&quot; (1584), a collection of prose tales; and a translation of the &quot;Menæchmi&quot; of Plautus (1595). &quot;Albion&#x27;s England&quot; consisted originally of four &quot;books,&quot; but the number was increased in successive issues, and a posthumous edition (1612) contains sixteen books. It was reprinted (1810) in Alexander Chalmers&#x27;s &quot;English Poets&quot;.

<text>Mila D. Aguilar (1949 – October 13, 2023) was a Filipina poet, novelist, essayist, activist, educator, website designer, and video documentarian. Writing under the nom de guerre Clarita Roja during the dangerous days of the Marcos dictatorship, she is best remembered for having been &quot;&quot;the best known poet in the underground movement during the Marcos Regime&quot;.&quot; More broadly, she is also known for her leadership roles in the resistance against the authoritarian regime of Ferdinand Marcos, and for her continued social activism in the years after Marcos was deposed, including the last phase of her activism which was strongly influenced with her beliefs after her 1990 conversion to Born Again christianity.

As a writer she is best known for the poetry books &quot;Why Cage Pigeons?&quot;, &quot;A Comrade is as Precious as a Rice Seedling&quot; and &quot;Journey: An Autobiography in Verse (1964-1995)&quot;, and the autobiographical novel &quot;The Nine Deaths of M&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Mila D. Aguilar was born in Iloilo in 1949, the youngest daughter of Jose Vasquez Aguilar and Ramona Deysolong. Her father was well known as a founding figure in the Community School Movement in the Philippines, and had been recognized in 1952 as the first Filipino recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay Award, and also the first recipient of the award under the cagtegory of Government Service.

She studied English and Humanities at the University of the Philippines Diliman, writing poetry which was published in the Philippines Free Press, Sunday Times Magazine and the Philippines Graphic while studying, and finally earning her diploma in 1969.

== Early career ==
Immediately after graduating, Aguilar began her career by teaching at the UP Diliman Department of English and Comparative Literature. She also wrote for Philippines Graphic from 1969 to 1971, working alongside Amadis Ma. Guerrero and Petronilo Daroy.

== Life in the underground ==
In her poetry anthology &quot;Journey: An Autobiography in Verse (1964-1995),&quot; Aguilar described her writings from 1971 to 1984 as being part of her &quot;red period,&quot; because it was a time when she was actively involved in the underground resistance against the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos.

=== Going underground ===
Aguilar She first became exposed to the National Democratic (ND) movement when she was assigned by the Graphic to cover the ND youth and student movement, which meant covering the various pickets and demonstrations, particularly the Diliman commune.

She finally joined the underground movement against Marcos in 1971 when Marcos used the Plaza Miranda bombing as a reason to suspend the writ of habeas corpus.

Over the course of the next 13 years, she started out as an ordinary member of the Communist Party of the Philippines assigned as a driver plying the route between Manila and Isabela, and then later found herself assuming several top positions in the organization, including head of the Regional United Front Commission of Mindanao, and then head of the National United Front.

=== Marriage and widowhood ===
She met fellow activist Magtanggol Roque early on in her involvement with the CPP, and the two were married through party rites in the mountains of Isabela on May 5, 1971, and then getting a court marriage in Pasay City not long after. She had a son with Roque, who was seven years older than her. And he rented an apartment in their name in BF homes in Parañaque. But she barely stayed in the house, focusing on her duties as a driver for the underground movement. She was deeply distressed that they had to leave their son with Aguilar&#x27;s mother to keep him safe.

Roque was eventually killed in May 1981 when he was shot while trying to warn fellow activists that their safehouse was about to be raided.

=== Resignation from the CPP ===
Aguilar resigned from the Communist Party of the Philippines after the 1983 assassination of Ninoy Aquino. She had written a leaflet expressing sympathy for Aquino which the Central Committee rejected, and Aguilar resigned because of the disagreement.

By this time, Aguilar had become Assistant Director at St. Joseph&#x27;s College, and she continued in that role until her arrest in 1984.

== Imprisonment ==

Despite her resignation from the underground movement, Aguilar was arrested in August 1984. She was accosted by men in several vans which stopped the jeepney she was riding, and then threw her onto the backseat of a waiting car. Based on their actions, she said she realized they probably did not yet know that she had resigned from the CPP.

Aguilar was held in solitary confinement as a political detainee at Camp Crame, where she was subjected to psychological, mental, emotional, and sexual abuse.

During this time, however, Aguilar continued to write, and she later described her writings from her time in prison as being part of her &quot;purple period,&quot; and labeled it as a period where &quot;the questions start.&quot; University of the Philippines critic Mary Grace R. Concepcion notes that:

&quot;By this time, Aguilar had already severed ties with the party and was questioning the proletariat, the party dogma, Christian dogma, and even the petty-bourgeoisie. Aguilar said she felt that everyone was “exploiting” everyone else. Thus, unlike the poems from the “Red Period”, the fight was not an outward struggle against the bigger forces of imperialism and feudalism, nor an inward struggle of the self through an ideological remolding. Rather the struggle was towards an individuation of meanings, wherein one struggles to be an individual above any form of social and collective organization.&quot;

Some of her friends formed the Free Mila D. Aguilar Committee, and they published a collection of the works she had written in prison, titled &quot;Why Cage Pigeons?&quot; to help raise funds for her and lobby for her release.

== Release, conversion, and continued activism ==
Aguilar&#x27;s time as a political detainee ended in 1996 when Marcos was deposed by the People Power Revolution, and her release marked a period of discovery which led to her conversion to Born Again Christianity in 1990, which would be a defining influence on her as a writer, as an activist, and as a person moving forward.

Acknowledging that part of her life which began with her conversion marked a final chapter rather than a mere phase, she later labelled her literary works from this time as simply &quot;period&quot; in contrast to the previous &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, and &quot;purple&quot; periods. University of the Philippines academic reviewer Mary Grace R. Concepcion notes that Aguilar&#x27;s periodization of her works in this way in the 1995 poetry collection &quot;Journey: An Autobiography in Verse (1964-1995)&quot; acknowledges that her &quot;progression of self-awareness therefore ends with god and religion.&quot;

=== People Power Revolution and release from prison===
Aguilar was released from Prison in 1986, after the People Power Revolution. After her release, returned to teaching at St Joseph&#x27;s College.

During this time, she became a videographer, and produced, wrote, and directed almost 50 videos on subjects ranging from community organizations to regional cultures and good manners for government employees. She eventually also designed websites, describing herself as a &quot;webweaver.&quot;

=== Conversion to Born Again Christianity ===
Aguilar became a Born Again Christian in 1990, significantly reframing both her literary work and her social activism for the rest of her life. She famously reinterpreted her pseudonym Clarita Roja, which means &quot;clear red,&quot; to be a reference to the redeeming Blood of Christ. Her beliefs shaped her continued activism, as she denounced the injustices perpetuated by later government administrations.

Describing at a 2012 book launching how her writing and social engagement was affected by her conversion experience, and explaining her intention to write more essays and stories, Aguilar said:

 “College was not enough. Even 13 years underground and one and a half years in prison were not enough. I had to do video documentaries all over the Philippines for a few years, then take Philippine Studies formally and informally as well[...] I finally got it. Without a vision, the people perish! That vision is God’s for the people of God, led by the children of God. Poetry is emotion expressed in unified rhythm, imagery and tension. What I cannot express of this vision in poetry, I must express in essay and story. Then pray that God will accept my paeans to Him, my plaints for and in behalf of my people.”

=== Later work ===
Aguilar returned to teaching at the UP Diliman Department of English and Comparative Literature from 2000 to 2006. In 2013, she published her autobiographical novel &quot;The Nine Deaths of M.&quot; as an ebook on Kindle. In 2021, she co-wrote volume 2 of &quot;A History of the University of the Philippines,&quot; covering the years 1943 to 1975, alongsise Rosario Cruz-Lucero, Ruth Pison, and Alexander Dacanay.

== Death ==
On October 13, 2023, Aguilar passed away at the age of 74.

==Works==
As a poet, she has written about 400 poems in English, Filipino, and Ilonggo, about 125 of which are in &quot;Journey: An Autobiography in Verse (1964-1995)&quot;, a collection published by the University of the Philippines Press in 1996. The poems in this collection were culled from six books printed in Manila, San Francisco, and New York City between the years 1974 and 1987 (including &quot;A Comrade is as Precious as a Rice Seedling&quot;), as well as from her writing in subsequent years up to 1995. &quot;Chronicle of a Life Foretold: 101 Poems (1995-2005)&quot; was published in 2012 by Popular Bookstore, and two more collections &quot;Poetry as Prophecy (2005-2013),&quot; and an untitled book, remain unpublished.

<text>The mentalist postulate is the thesis that meaning in natural language is an information structure that is mentally encoded by human beings. It is a basic premise of some branches of cognitive semantics. Semantic theories implicitly or explicitly incorporating the mentalist postulate include force dynamics and conceptual semantics.

Two implications of the mentalist postulate are: first, that research on the nature of mental representations can serve to constrain or enrich semantic theories; and secondly, that results of semantic theories bear directly on the nature of human conceptualization.

<doc id="1096516" wikidata="Q785326" url="?curid=1096516" title="Language and the euro">
<text>Several linguistic issues have arisen in relation to the spelling of the words &quot;euro&quot; and &quot;cent&quot; in the many languages of the member states of the European Union, as well as in relation to grammar and the formation of plurals.
In official documents, the name &quot;euro&quot; must be used for the nominative singular in all languages, though different alphabets are taken into account and plural forms and declensions are accepted. In documents other than EU legal texts, including national legislation, other spellings are accepted according to the various grammatical rules of the respective language. For European Union legislation, the spelling of the words for the currency is prescribed for each language; in the English-language version of European Union legislation the forms &quot;euro&quot; and &quot;cent&quot; are used invariantly in the singular and plural, even though this departs from usual English practice for currencies.

==Written conventions for the euro in the languages of EU member states==

==Languages of the European Union==
===Bulgarian===

Bulgarian uses Cyrillic. The 1st series of euro banknotes had the word &quot;euro&quot; written in Latin and Greek alphabets. The Europa series introduced Cyrillic, adopting the spelling ЕВРО, as described below.
When Bulgaria issues Euro coins, if the Greek model is followed, the alternative spelling will go on the national (obverse) side.

In popular Bulgarian usage the currency is referred to as and, less often, (from Bulgarian Европа , meaning &quot;Europe&quot;); the plural varies in spoken language – , , – but the most widespread form is евро – without inflection in plural. The word for euro, though, has a normal form with the postpositive definite article – (the euro).

The word for eurocent is and most probably that, or only цент , will be used in future when the European currency is accepted in Bulgaria. In contrast to euro, the word for &quot;cent&quot; has a full inflection both in the definite and the plural form: (basic form), (full definite article – postpositive), (plural), 2 (numerative form – after numerals). The word (), singular (), the name of the subunit of the current Bulgarian currency can be used in place of cent, as it has become a synonym of the word &quot;coins&quot; in colloquial Bulgarian; just like &quot;cent&quot; (from Latin ), its etymology is from a word meaning hundred – &quot;sto&quot; (сто). is used widely in the Bulgarian diaspora in Europe to refer to subunits of currencies other than the Bulgarian lev.

Initially, the ECB and the European Commission insisted that Bulgaria change the name it uses for the currency from ЕВРО to ЕУРО, claiming the currency should have an official and standard spelling across the EU. Bulgaria on the other hand stated that it wants to take into account the different alphabet and the principle of phonetic orthography in the Bulgarian language. The issue was decisively resolved in favour of Bulgaria at the 2007 EU Summit in Lisbon, allowing Bulgaria to use the Cyrillic spelling евро on all official EU documents. As of 13 December 2007, all EU institutions – including the ECB – use ЕВРО as the official Bulgarian transliteration of the single European currency. The Bulgarian spelling Evro ЕВРО is spelt with a v because it is derived from the name Европа/Evropa (Europe).

Of other national Slavic languages using the Cyrillic alphabet, Macedonian, Russian and Serbian also use the spelling евро. In Serbian, this is used alongside the Latin spelling &quot;euro&quot; as the language uses both alphabets. Bosnian and Montenegrin also use both alphabets and use еуро / &quot;euro&quot; () like Croatian (which uses only Latin). Ukrainian uses &#x27; and Belarusian uses &#x27;/.

===Croatian===
In Croatian the euro and cent are called and (occasionally the word is used instead of to distinguish the euro denomination versus its foreign counterparts).

Plural forms are, like in many Slavic languages, somewhat complex. The general plural form of euro is , but the paucal or identically written (but not identically pronounced) genitive plural is used with all numbers, thus . The numbers ending in 1 (e.g. 21 or 101) take the nominative singular, the exception being numbers ending in 11 (e.g. 11 or 111). The examples are: , , , and respectively.

The general plural form of cent is and it is used with most numbers. The numbers ending in 1, except for those ending in 11, take the nominative singular , while those ending in 2, 3 and 4 except 12, 13 or 14 take the paucal . The examples are: , , , , , , , , , , , .

Both and in Croatian are of masculine gender.

Pronunciation follows the rules of Croatian. is pronounced , while is pronounced .

===Czech===
In Czech, the words and are spelt the same as in English and pronounced per Czech phonology , . Occasionally the word &quot;eurocent&quot; is used instead of to distinguish the euro denomination versus its foreign counterparts. The spelling differs from the Czech word for Europe (&quot;Evropa&quot;); however &quot;euro-&quot; has become a standard prefix for all things relating to the EU (&quot;Evropská unie&quot;).

The Czech declension uses different form of plural for various numerals: for 2, 3 and 4, it is plain nominative and , while for numbers above 5, genitive (a vestige of partitive) &quot;eur&quot; and &quot;centů&quot; is used.

For compound numerals, there are two variants: either genitive plural is used (, ) or the form is determined by the unit part of the numeral (, ). The partitive genitive is used only when the whole numeral phrase is in nominative or accusative phrases, otherwise the expected case is used: (7 euros-genitive), but (with seven-instrumental euro-instrumental). Moreover, these otherwise common declensions are often ignored and non-declined is used for every value (), even though this form is proscribed.

In Czech is of neuter gender and inflected like &quot;město&quot;, while is masculine and inflected like &quot;hrad&quot;.

===Danish===
The word is included in the 2002 version of &quot;Retskrivningsordbogen&quot;, the authoritative source for the Danish language (according to Danish law). Two plurals are given, &quot;euro&quot; when referring to an amount, and &quot;euroer&quot; when referring to coins. Both &quot;cent&quot; and &quot;eurocent&quot; are mentioned; the plural and singular forms are identical.

Danish words of Greek origin containing the sequence &quot;eu&quot; are traditionally pronounced with [œʊ̯], e.g. &quot;Zeus, terapeut, eutanasi, Europa&quot;. However, in the word &quot;Europa&quot;, a newer pronunciation with [eʊ̯] has gained ground in recent years, but this has not influenced the way &quot;euro&quot; is commonly pronounced.

===Dutch===
Plural: In Dutch, most abstract units of measurement are not pluralised, including the former Dutch guilder (&quot;gulden&quot; in Dutch) and Belgian franc (called &quot;frank&quot; in Dutch), and now the euro. An amount such as €5 is pronounced &quot;5 euro&quot;. This coincides with EU legislation stating that &quot;euro&quot; and &quot;cent&quot; should be used as both singular and plural. In Dutch, the words are however pluralised as &quot;euro&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;centen&quot; when referring to individual coins.

The euro is divided into 100 &quot;cent&quot;, as was the guilder. The Belgian franc was divided into 100 &quot;centiemen&quot;. The word &quot;eurocent&quot; is sometimes used to distinguish it from the cents of other currencies, such as the &quot;dollarcent&quot;, but originally mainly to differentiate it from what used to be 0.01 guilder, also called &quot;cent&quot;.

Pronunciation: The word &quot;euro&quot; is phonemically. This can be pronounced the same phonetically, but commonly also as , , and others depending on the dialect and speaker (see Dutch phonology).

Slang terms: In the Netherlands, slang terms that were previously applied to guilder coinage and banknotes are sometimes applied to euro currency. Examples in the Netherlands include &quot;stuiver&quot; for 5 cents, &quot;dubbeltje&quot; for 10 cents. However, the word &quot;kwartje&quot; (quarter), previously used for a guilder coin worth ƒ0.25, did not survive the introduction of the euro, which lacks a coin worth €0.25. Another popular slang term is the plural form () (or even the double plural &quot;euries&quot; ()), a deliberate hypercorrect form referring to the plural of Dutch words of Latin or Italian origin.

In Belgium, some Flemings refer to the 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins as &quot;koper&quot;, which is the Dutch word for copper, the metal these coins are made of (compare nickel). Another nickname is &quot;ros&quot; (&quot;redhead&quot;) or &quot;roskes&quot; (&quot;little redheads&quot;), referring to the colour of the coins.

Syntax: In Dutch language print, the euro sign (€) is chiefly placed before the amount, from which it is often separated by a (thin) space. This was also the case with the florin sign (ƒ).

===English===
In the English-language version of European Union legislation, the unit &quot;euro&quot;, without an &quot;s&quot;, is used for both singular and plural. However, the plural &quot;euros&quot; is also in everyday use. Many style guides such as those from the Associated Press and The Economist specify the plural &quot;euros&quot;, and major dictionaries describe it as the most common form.

Official practice for English-language EU legislation (not necessarily in national legislation) is to use the words &quot;euro&quot; and &quot;cent&quot; as both singular and plural. This practice originally arose out of legislation intended to ensure that the banknotes were uncluttered with a string of plurals. Because the &quot;s&quot;-less plurals had become &quot;enshrined&quot; in EU legislation, the Commission decided to retain those plurals in English in legislation even while allowing regular plurals in other languages. The Directorate-General for Translation&#x27;s &quot;English Style Guide&quot; (a handbook for authors and translators working for the European Commission) previously recommended the use of regular plurals where appropriate, but as of May 2019, states that no &quot;s&quot; should be used.
Prior to 2006, the inter-institutional style guide recommended use of &quot;euro&quot; and &quot;cent&quot; without the plural &quot;s&quot;, and the translation style guide recommended use of invariant plurals (without &quot;s&quot;) when amending or referring to original legislation but use of regular plurals in documents intended for the general public.

In Great Britain, despite not using the euro as its currency, the terms &quot;euros&quot; and &quot;cents&quot; are more common than the plurals without the &quot;s&quot;. The use of &quot;s&quot; for euros and cents is also recommended by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

====In Ireland====
As the euro was being adopted in Ireland, the Department of Finance decided to use the word &quot;euro&quot; as both the singular and plural forms of the currency. Some media outlets, including the national broadcaster RTÉ, followed suit. However, &quot;euros&quot; is also acceptable. The print media still frequently uses &quot;euro&quot; for plural amounts, although use of &quot;euros&quot; is also common.

Slang terms: As in the Netherlands, slang terms that were previously applied to punts have been carried over to the euro currency. For example, &quot;quid&quot; (same in singular and plural), which once referred to an Irish pound (and in the UK still refers to a British pound) is used as a synonym for &quot;euro&quot;. Also, &quot;fiver&quot; and &quot;tenner&quot;, which once referred to five and ten pounds respectively, now refer to five and ten euro either in the sense of the specific €5 and €10 banknotes, or in the broader sense of an equivalent sum of money.

====In English-speaking countries outside Europe====
The term euro-cent is sometimes used in countries (such as Australia, Canada, and the United States) which also have &quot;cent&quot; as a currency subdivision, to distinguish them from their local coin. This usage, though unofficial, is mirrored on the coins themselves, which have the words &quot;EURO&quot; and &quot;CENT&quot; displayed on the common side.

===Estonian===
===Finnish===
The Finnish pronunciation for &quot;euro&quot; is . In Finnish, the form is used for the cent – the letter &#x27;c&#x27; is generally not used in Finnish, and nativized Finnish words cannot end in consonant combinations like &#x27;-nt&#x27;, therefore an extra vowel &quot; is added. and are declined like many other existing words ending in and , and displays consonant gradation (genitive , ). With numerals, the partitive singulars and are used, e.g., . This is abbreviated &quot;10 €&quot;, where the &quot;€&quot; symbol takes the role of the word (never *&quot;€10&quot; or *&quot;10€&quot;). The colon notation (&quot;€:a&quot;) must not be used with the partitive of when the number is in the nominative. In general, colon notation should be avoided and, for example, one should write or instead of &quot;€:n&quot; or &quot;€:a&quot;.

Plurals (e.g., &quot;tens of euros&quot;) exist, but they are not used with singular numbers (e.g., &quot;ten euro&quot;).

 is problematic in that its primary meaning in colloquial language is &quot;centimeter&quot;. Thus, the officially recommended abbreviation of is , although Finnish merchants generally use a decimal notation (for example &quot;0,35 €&quot;).

Slang terms: In Helsinki slang, a common nickname for euro is . In Tampere slang , a common male name, may be used for euro.

===French===
In French, the singular is (masculine). The official plural is the same as the regular plural .
The , which is regarded as an authority for the French language in France, stated this clearly, following French legislation in this regard.

In France, the word is far more common than and is recommended by the . used to be a hundredth of the French franc which is now called . The word (plural , both pronounced to avoid the confusion with (100) pronounced ) is the official term to be used in the French-language version of community legislation. Before its use in relation to the euro, the word &quot;cent&quot; (pronounced as in English, ) was best known to European Francophones as a hundredth of a dollar (U.S., Canadian, etc.)

French-speaking Belgians use more often than because coins for the Belgian franc (worth, on 1 January 1999 about three U.S. cents) rarely circulated (only a 50 centime coin was still being issued) and because of the influence of Dutch and English, which are more commonly used in Belgium than in France as a result of Belgium&#x27;s language diversity.

Slang terms: the euro is often referred to as &quot;balle&quot;, meaning &quot;ball&quot; or &quot;bullet&quot; in English. This use of the word &quot;balle&quot; can be traced back to the 17th century.

===German===
Plural: In German, and are used as both singular and plural when following a numeral, as is the case with all units of measurement of masculine (e.g. , ) or neuter gender (e.g. , etc.). However, when talking about individual coins, the plurals and are used.

The only other marked case is the genitive singular, which is or, alternatively, .

Pronunciation: The beginning of the word is pronounced in German with the diphthong , which sounds similar to , the &#x27;oi&#x27; in the English word &quot;oil&quot;.

The spelling of the word is not well adapted to German spelling conventions because these strive to avoid ambiguous letter-sound correspondences. Initial letter C is often used in loanwords and corresponds to various pronunciations depending on the language of origin (e.g. [s] in &quot;Centime&quot;, in &quot;Cello&quot;, in &quot;Celsius&quot; and [k] in &quot;Café&quot;). Most of these words are therefore eventually spelt phonetically (e.g. , (Czech Republic), ).

Latin words beginning with &quot;ce&quot; such as (hundred) traditionally represent in German, and German words derived from these have therefore long been spelt with a , which represents (as in (centre), (centimetre), etc.). Equivalently, some German speakers pronounce the beginning of the word &quot;Cent&quot; , but since they are familiar with the English pronunciation of the American unit &quot;cent&quot;, most people pronounce it [s].

As these are nouns, both Euro and Cent are capitalised in German.

Slang terms: In Austria and Germany, the euro has also been called , a play on the word , meaning &#x27;expensive&#x27;. The Deutsche Mark was worth half as much as the euro (a ratio of approximately 2:1) and some grocers and restaurants were accused of taking advantage of the smaller numbers to increase their actual prices with the changeover.

In youth and Internet culture the fake plural is sometimes used; this form&#x27;s origin is unknown but it bears resemblance to &quot;Dublonen&quot; (doubloons) and has a retro ring to it. Also, &quot;&quot; is occasionally used, the name of the Swedish currency. Unlike the previous currencies (Mark and Schilling) which had well established nicknames for individual coins and notes, there are few widely used nicknames for Euros, but the two Euro coin is sometimes called like the old two Mark piece.

In German Usenet culture, the name (question mark) was occasionally used in reference to initial problems with display of the euro sign, which was often rendered as a question mark. The term was most often written using the mock currency code FRZ. This technical trouble has diminished and so has the usage of this term.

Abbreviations: EUR. TEUR for thousand Euros and MEUR for a million Euros are often used in financial documents. Numbers are given with a comma as decimal separator.

===Greek===
In the Greek language the indeclinable word () is used as the currency&#x27;s name. It was decided to use omega (ω) rather than omicron (ο) as the last letter of the word, partly because a noun ending with omicron would encourage mutability, and partly to stress the origin of the euro in the Greek word (&quot;Eurōpē&quot;, Europe) which is also spelt with omega and it is actually written on the euro notes in Greek as . Also, the spelling (resulting in a plural ) on the notes could have confused other Europeans, who might read it as a string of Latin letters: &quot;eypo&quot;. A plural form &quot;evra&quot;, as if from a regular declinable neuter noun in &quot;-o&quot;, is sometimes used in a jocular way.

For the cent, the terms used in Greece are , plural (&quot;leptó&quot;, plural &quot;leptá&quot;), a name used for small denominations of various ancient and modern Greek currencies, including the drachma (which the euro replaced). The word means &#x27;minute&#x27; (literally &quot;thin&quot;), the same as the unit of measurement of time or of angle. The term , plural (&quot;evroleptó&quot;, plural &quot;evroleptá&quot;) is sometimes used when a speaker wants to be completely specific that they are referring to money and not time.

Some colloquial names for currency are also in use for the euro, carried over from the drachma. One and two euro coins are respectively called (&quot;frango&quot;) and (&quot;difrango&quot;) from the French &quot;franc&quot;. A 5 euro banknote is also colloquially called (&quot;taliro&quot;) from the Germanic root &quot;thaler&quot; via the Italian &quot;talero&quot;. A 10 euro banknote is called (&quot;dekariko&quot;), a 20 euro banknote is called (&quot;eikosariko&quot;) or (&quot;eikosari&quot;), and a 50 euro banknote is called (&quot;penintariko&quot;), derivatives of the words for ten, twenty and fifty.

10 lepta of a drachma were called (&quot;dekara&quot;), but since lepta of the drachma were out of circulation long before the euro, this word is now considered too old-fashioned and only used in old expressions and thus it is not used for the 10 eurocent coin. Nevertheless, all Greeks understand the word to stand for 10 cents of any currency and thus use it for non-euro currencies like the dime of the US dollar. The same is true for the 5-cent coin which is not called (&quot;pentara&quot;) like its drachma equivalent. These words come from the words for five and ten respectively.

In Cyprus, however, the cent is officially called (&quot;sent&quot;) both in singular and plural. This is the name formerly used for of the Cypriot pound chosen for its neutrality to both official languages of the Republic (Greek and Turkish).

===Hungarian===
In Hungarian the currency is named &quot;euró&quot; () and () without plural forms (as in Hungarian no plural is used after numerals), the former written with an accented &quot;ó&quot;, as decided by the Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The spelling is also in accordance with the word &quot;Európa&quot; (&quot;Europe&quot;) in Hungarian.

Hungarian language does not use plural after numerals, as numerals already express plural; however, both &quot;euró&quot; and can take suffixes regarding to grammatical cases, just as:
* Accusative case: &quot;eurót&quot;
* Dative case: &quot;eurónak&quot;
* Instrumental case: &quot;euróval&quot; (&quot;with euro&quot;)
* Causative case: &quot;euróért&quot; (&quot;for euro&quot;)
* etc.

On introduction of the euro, Hungary—along with Lithuania, Latvia, and Slovenia—struggled for the euro to be written in its official documents according to its own usage and spelling, in contrast with Community law, which provides for a single name throughout the Union (in the nominative singular and taking account of different alphabets).

The Treaty of Lisbon, signed in 2009, contains the following declaration from Hungary, Latvia and Malta:
58. Declaration by the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Hungary and the Republic of Malta on the spelling of the name of the single currency in the Treaties
Without prejudice to the unified spelling of the name of the single currency of the European Union referred to in the Treaties as displayed on the banknotes and on the coins, Latvia, Hungary and Malta declare that the spelling of the name of the single currency, including its derivatives as applied throughout the Latvian, Hungarian and Maltese text of the Treaties, has no effect on the existing rules of the Latvian, Hungarian or Maltese languages.
===Irish===
In Irish, the words and are used without change in spelling or pronunciation, and immune to the regular rules of Irish mutation after numbers; as such, they are ungendered, and the plural &quot;euronna&quot; is thus rarely encountered. The word &quot;ceint&quot; (plural &quot;ceinteanna&quot; ) has been in the lexicon since at least 1959 and is attested in printed literature, but is very rarely encountered.

Linguist Michael Everson in a 2001 paper proposed a new masculine noun &quot;eoró&quot; (plural &quot;eorónna&quot; ), or alternatively &quot;eora&quot; (plural &quot;eoraí&quot;), derived from &quot;Eoraip&quot; (&#x27;Europe&#x27;), as being a more grammatically acceptable Irish term. However, it was not widely adopted and is not in common use.

Irish also practices lenition after the numerals 2–6 (5 &quot;cheint&quot;) and eclipsis after numerals 7–10 (9 &quot;gceint&quot;, 8 &quot;n-eoró&quot;). However, as &quot;ceint&quot; is irregularly pronounced (no other Irish word has a soft &quot;c&quot;), lenition and eclipsis are usually not applied.

===Italian===
In Italian the word is used, as both singular and plural. Its standard pronunciation is , although in several northern accents it is pronounced as instead. The plural form is uncommon, but not considered incorrect.

The issue of whether the correct plural form would be or remained open for a long time, predating the actual introduction of the currency. The Accademia della Crusca assigned to Severina Parodi, lexicographer, and to Luca Serianni, language historian, the task to give a response. They deliberated in favour of in 1999 with the motivation that &quot;euro is a masculine noun&quot;. But the issue was then re-examined many times.
Finally, in 2001 the consensus of the Accademia coalesced in favour of invariability. The rationale was based on the fact that abbreviated words originating from a longer word (for example &quot;auto&quot; from &quot;automobile&quot; (car) or &quot;moto&quot; from &quot;motocicletta&quot; (motorbike)) do not have a plural form, as well as the fact that the word is considered an abbreviation of the word &quot;Eurovaluta&quot; (European currency). In 2002 an amendment to the financial act was proposed to adopt as the plural form for public official deeds, but was quickly rejected by the Parliament.

The word (pronounced ) is in practical use always replaced by the word &quot;centesimo&quot; (), which simply means &quot;hundredth&quot; (also see in French); its plural form is &quot;centesimi&quot;. &quot;Cent&quot; only appears on documents such as electricity and telephone bills; it is perceived by native speakers as an abbreviation of &quot;centesimo&quot; (and in fact often followed by a period) rather than as an autonomous proper name. It should also be added that the word &quot;cent&quot;, or &quot;centesimo&quot;, is often omitted altogether in current usage, when it follows an amount expressed in higher values: a sum of € 1,50 is commonly referred to as &quot;one Euro fifty&quot; (&quot;un Euro e cinquanta&quot;), with no reference to the cent partition. 

===Latvian===

In Latvian the commonly used term is eiro (which somewhat resembles the West European &quot;euro&quot;, but has also taken its sound from &quot;Eiropa&quot;, the Latvian word for &quot;Europe&quot;).

In 2004 it was proposed by Terminology Commission of the Latvian Academy of Sciences that standardized usage should be eira as &quot;eiro&quot; is undeclinable in Latvian. The commission argued that a potentially frequently used term needs to fit especially well in the structure of Latvian grammar. They suggested that &quot;eiro&quot; is especially inconvenient to use in dative and locative, which would necessitate addition of &quot;valūta&quot; (&quot;currency&quot;) for clarification.

However, this decision resulted in public outcry, which resulted in the commission amending its original ruling to state that usage of &quot;euro&quot; is inappropriate for Latvian, and that &quot;eiro&quot; is acceptable as a parallel form, but its use should be limited and it should be dropped over time. The reasoning was explained, that while they still insist on the use of &quot;eira&quot;, they acknowledge that a half of users of the language are not content with such a form. They explained that the use of &quot;euro&quot; (and &quot;cent&quot; without nominative ending) is ill-suited to the language because an &quot;eu&quot; diphthong does not exist in Latvian, and orthographic rules discourage spellings that don&#x27;t reflect pronunciation.

===Lithuanian===
In Lithuanian the euro and cent are called &quot;euras&quot; () and &quot;centas&quot; () (in common language sometimes &quot;euro centas&quot;, to distinguish from the cents of the former Lithuanian currency, &quot;litas&quot;), while plural forms are &quot;eurai&quot; and &quot;centai&quot; (&quot;eurocentai&quot;). The Lithuanian language routinely adapts foreign words by re-spelling them according to Lithuanian phonetic rules and adding standardised endings, resulting in words like &quot;kompiuteris&quot;.

===Maltese===
In Maltese, the spelling is &quot;ewro&quot;, as announced in December 2005. The currency name &quot;ewro&quot; is spelt with &quot;w&quot; (not with a &quot;u&quot;) as derived from the Maltese word &quot;Ewropa&quot; (Europe), also written with &quot;w&quot;. Furthermore, the vowels &quot;e&quot; and &quot;u&quot; are not written next to each other in Maltese, except when they are pronounced as two syllables, which is not the case here. The plural of the word remains unchanged, as the singular. The cent is known as &quot;ċenteżmu&quot;, plural &quot;ċenteżmi&quot;, both abbreviated to &quot;ċ&quot;.

In Maltese, &#x27;ewro&#x27; is written with a small letter &quot;e&quot; and is masculine singular – as in &quot;L-ewro huwa...&quot; (The euro is...) and &quot;Il-munita tal-ewro hija&quot; (The euro coin is...).

===Polish===
In Polish, &quot;euro&quot; is both singular and plural, and pronounced . This noun belongs to a small group of nouns of foreign origin in Polish that, as an exception, remain non-declinable in any of the seven cases (other examples being &quot;zoo&quot;, &quot;Waterloo&quot; and few others). It is however likely for the word &quot;euro&quot; to follow the pattern of other foreign words like &quot;kino&quot;, &quot;studio&quot; and &quot;radio&quot; and eventually become fully declinable in a similar manner as a result of a full linguistic absorption of the word into Polish. &quot;Cent&quot; is declinable, being &quot;eurocent&quot; or simply &quot;cent&quot; () in singular nominative and &quot;eurocenty&quot; or &quot;centy&quot; () in plural nominative or &quot;eurocentów&quot; or &quot;centów&quot; () in plural genitive.

===Portuguese===
In Portuguese, &quot;euro&quot; has a Portuguese word-ending and thus is used in the singular, with &quot;euros&quot; the plural form. &quot;Cent&quot;, which does not conform to Portuguese word-forming rules, is commonly converted to &quot;cêntimo&quot; (singular) and &quot;cêntimos&quot; (plural).

The term &quot;cêntimo&quot; might have been adopted to distinguish it from the fractional value of the &quot;Portuguese escudo&quot;, which was called &quot;centavo&quot;.

Pronunciation of &quot;euro&quot; in Portuguese is still not standardized: either or . The latter has the regular final unstressed -&quot;o&quot; pronunciation, as , and is more widespread in the north of the country, while the former is more common in the south. &quot;Euro&quot;, &quot;cêntimo&quot; and &quot;centavo&quot; are masculine nouns in Portuguese, and as such, &quot;the cents&quot; are translated as &quot;os cêntimos&quot; and &quot;those euros&quot; as &quot;aqueles euros&quot;.

In Brazil the pronunciation is (generally in Rio de Janeiro and further north, as in Portugal, and in São Paulo and further south and west as well as the places where southern Brazilians settled) and fractional values are called &quot;centavos de euro&quot; (cents of euro) to differentiate them from Brazilian real &quot;centavos&quot;.

Units up to 1000 are colloquially designated as &quot;paus:&quot; 50 euros is designated as 50 &quot;paus&quot;. This name carried over from the escudo.

===Romanian===
In Romanian the euro and cent are called &quot;euro&quot; and (plural &quot;&quot; ). The official plural of &quot;euro&quot; is also &quot;euro&quot;, and this official form was readily adopted by speakers. The &quot;eu&quot; construct is not a diphthong, thus the pronunciation is .

When speaking in a familiar–vernacular setting, some speakers would make the informal plural &quot;euroi&quot;, which is unofficial and more colloquial.

===Slovak===
In Slovak the euro and cent are called &quot;euro&quot; and , the plural forms for amounts between 2 and 4 are &quot;2 eurá/centy&quot;, and the plural forms for larger amounts are &quot;5 eur/centov&quot;. &quot;Euro&quot; is spelt with a &quot;u&quot; because it is derived from the word &quot;Európa&quot; (Europe). The c in cent represents .

Slang terms: common nicknames for euro in Slovak includes: &quot;euráče&quot;, &quot;evri&quot;, &quot;juráše&quot;, &quot;éčka&quot; (literally &quot;e&quot;-s or &quot;letters ‘e’&quot;). Cents are sometimes jokingly called &quot;šestáky&quot; (as a common term for coins with small value); &quot;meďáky&quot; or &quot;medenáky&quot; (literally &quot;coppers&quot; or &quot;the copper ones&quot;) or &quot;haliere&quot; which is a reference to the small coins of the original Slovak currency.

===Slovene===
In Slovene the euro and cent are called &quot;evro&quot; and (, ), the dual form is &quot;2 evra/centa&quot; (, or ) and the plural forms are &quot;3/4 evri/centi&quot; (, or ), &quot;5+ evrov/centov&quot; (, or ), the same declension case being used for all higher numerals up to 100, then beginning again (&quot;101 evro/cent&quot;, &quot;102 evra/centa&quot;, &quot;103 evri/centi&quot;, &quot;104 evri/centi&quot;, &quot;105 evrov/centov&quot; etc.). &quot;Evro&quot; is spelt with &quot;v&quot; according to standard Slovene orthography, and matches the word &quot;Evropa&quot; (Europe).

In laws and regulations, though, the word ‘evro’ is replaced with the word ‘euro’ in all grammatical cases in accordance with an agreement between Slovenia and the European Union. In normative Slovene language usage ‘evro’ spelling should only be used, except as noted.

===Spanish===
In the Spanish language, the official plural is the same as its regular plural . For the cent, the word &quot;céntimo&quot; (plural &quot;céntimos&quot;) can be used. The fraction of the peseta was also called &quot;céntimo&quot;, but no céntimo coins had been issued since 1980, and had since been demonetised. The word &quot;euro&quot; is pronounced in Spanish, and &quot;céntimo&quot; in Spain or in Latin America.

Slang terms: the euro is often referred to as &quot;pavo&quot;, meaning &quot;turkey&quot; in English (the usual translation for &quot;buck&quot; in dubbed films).

===Swedish===
In Swedish writing, euro is spelt &quot;euro&quot; (and cent is spelt ) both in singular and plural, or written EUR, or €. The € sign is common in Finland but rare in Sweden. The currency &quot;the euro&quot; is spelt following Swedish grammar rules. There are many Swedish laws mentioning amounts in euro, because of EU directives, using &quot;euro&quot; for the amounts and expression like &quot;belopp i euro&quot; (amount in euro), not the € sign.

In Sweden, the accepted pronunciations are (more common and similar to how &quot;eu&quot; is pronounced in modern Swedish in &quot;neuro-&quot;) or (similar to how &quot;eu&quot; is pronounced in modern Swedish in &quot;Europa&quot;). However, many Swedes choose to pronounce it in a more English way (no &quot;s&quot; in plural). This pronunciation is rejected by official authorities, such as the Swedish Language Council, and not used in television news. In Sweden there are no widespread slang terms since the euro is a foreign currency.

In Finland, the euro is the official currency, and Swedish is an official language alongside Finnish. The same spelling as in Sweden is used (officially Swedish in Finland is spelt as in Sweden). The pronunciation, however, is , which has some similarities to Finnish pronunciation. The abbreviation is like 3,14 €, same as for Finnish. Among Swedish-speaking as well as Finnish-speaking people in Helsinki, a common slang term is &quot;ege&quot;.

==Other languages==
===Albanian===
In Albanian, the euro is referred to as &quot;euro&quot;. This is the same for Albanian in Kosovo, North Macedonia and rest of the Balkans. Some Kosovo Albanian speakers however, pronounce euro like Germans; &#x27;oiro&#x27;/&#x27;oi&#x27;, due to heavily migration. It is derived from the Albanian word for Europe, &quot;Europa&quot;, &quot;Europë&quot; and also &quot;Evropa&quot;/&quot;Evropë&quot;. All variants are official in Albanian, however Albania uses Euro, Europa or Europe whilst other Albanian dialects such as in Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia often use Evrope or Evropa. However the currency euro is not ever pronounced as evro like their Slavic neighbours.

Note: depending on dialect, location, diaspora and ethnicity some Albanians vary their pronunciations based on standard Albanian, Italian, Greek, German or Slavic (such as those in North Macedonia or Serbia).

===Arabic===
In Arabic, the euro is usually referred to as , which is an adaptation of the English pronunciation of the currency&#x27;s name. Another naming is , which is an approximation of the French pronunciation . In most cases this term is used both for the singular and the plural form, although the plurals and are sometimes encountered. The name for Europe in Arabic is . Because loanwords are not of Arabic origin, they are pronounced in accordance with the spoken varieties of Arabic phonology. For example, is pronounced by Egyptian Arabic speakers, while by Levantine Arabic speakers.

Attempts to artificially arabize the pronunciation according to the standardized Arabic phonology would be more conforming to Arabic transliterations such as &quot;&quot; which would be theoretically pronounced for , respectively.
See also Arabic diglossia to understand why the pronunciation differs from region to region.

===Armenian===
The Armenian word for euro is , pronounced in exactly the same way as the Greek, with an added initial &quot;y&quot; sound. It is derived from the Armenian word for Europe, , which is pronounced , as stress in Armenian usually falls on the final syllable. Cent in Armenian is pronounced ().

The plural of euro, in accordance with the formation of plurals in Armenian, is . The plural of cent, however, is , pronounced .

===Asturian===
In Asturian, there has been a controversy about the spelling of the word. The official academic dictionary uses the spelling &quot;euru&quot;, respecting the Asturian tendency to write nouns with a final &quot;-u&quot;. However, considering that the international use is &quot;euro&quot; and that there is a tendency in Asturian to write some short forms with a final (like &quot;euro&quot; from &quot;Europa&quot;), other linguists, like Ramón d&#x27;Andrés, defend the spelling &quot;euro&quot;.

===Azerbaijani===
The Azerbaijani name for Europe is &quot;Avropa&quot;, similar to that of its sister language, Turkish, and the Azerbaijani word for euro, derived from that for Europe, is &quot;avro&quot;, identical to Turkish.

===Catalan===
In Catalan the official plural is the same as its regular plural &quot;euros&quot;. The standard pronunciation of &quot;euro&quot; is .

For the cent, the word &quot;cèntim&quot; (, plural &quot;cèntims&quot;) is used, since historically this term has been used as the hundredth part of a currency unit. The fraction of the peseta was also called &quot;cèntim&quot;, but it was withdrawn from circulation decades ago.

===Chinese===
In Chinese, the euro is known as &quot;欧元&quot; (simplified), &quot;歐元&quot; (traditional), &quot;ōuyuán&quot; (pinyin), this comes from the Chinese word for Europe; 欧洲 (&quot;Ōuzhōu)&quot;, and the word 元 (&quot;yuán)&quot;, meaning coin as in refers to a currency. This follows the same pattern as the word for the United States dollar, which is 美元 (&quot;měiyuán)&quot;. For cent, the word 欧分 (&quot;ōufēn)&quot;, is used, The character 分 (&quot;fēn)&quot; is simply mean cent in any currency, like 美分 means United States cent.

However, in Hong Kong it is often referred to as 歐羅 (). The Hong Kong Monetary Authority explained that 元 is used only if that currency is ended with &quot;dollar&quot; (such as United States dollar and Canadian dollar). Homophonic translation will be used if the unit is not &quot;dollar&quot;, including the euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc.

Plurals do not exist in Chinese so the same character is used for singular and plural forms. As the character 元 in 欧元 is a counter word in Chinese, there is no need to put a measure word before the word. An example is: 五十欧元 (financial Chinese: 伍拾欧元) &quot;wǔshí ōuyuán&quot; for fifty euro.

===Cornish===
In the Cornish language, euro is written &quot;ewro&quot; (like &quot;Ewrop&quot; &#x27;Europe&#x27;), a masculine noun with its plural &quot;ewros&quot;. For cent, &quot;cent&quot; is used, a masculine noun with the plural &quot;centys&quot;.

===Esperanto===
In Esperanto, the currency is called &quot;eŭro&quot;, similar to the Esperanto word for the continent &quot;Eŭropo.&quot; The &quot;o&quot; ending in euro conveniently accords with the standard noun ending in Esperanto, but rather than sound out &quot;e&quot; and &quot;u&quot; separately, Esperanto speakers use the diphthong &quot;eŭ&quot;, which matches its etymology. Plurals are formed in accordance with Esperanto rules, eŭroj and cendoj. The words are also declined as any Esperanto noun (eŭro/eŭroj in the nominative, eŭron/eŭrojn in the accusative). Since the inventor of the name &quot;euro&quot; Germain Pirlot is an Esperantist it is often assumed that he intentionally chose a word that fits well into the Esperanto grammar.

A cent is , as is commonly used for subunits of all centimalized currency (cents, centimes, etc.). The alternatives are from the French or a more technical , literally, &quot;one-hundredth part&quot;. (Esperanto speakers are unlikely to call a cent , since means a group of 100, rather than a hundredth.)

===Faroese===
In Faroese the euro is called evra, a feminine noun derived from the Faroese name of Europe, &quot;Evropa&quot;; this makes Faroese (with Icelandic) one of only two European languages in which the word for the euro is feminine. The plural is formed regularly: evrur. The cents are often called sent which is a neuter word and has the same form in the nominative plural.

=== Friulian ===
In Friulian, the euro is called &quot;euro&quot; and the plural form is &quot;euros&quot;. E.g. &quot;un euro&quot; (one euro), &quot;doi euros&quot; (two euros), &quot;trê euros&quot; (three euros). Cent is &quot;centesim&quot; and the plural form is &quot;centesims&quot;.

===Georgian===
In Georgian, the euro is called (&quot;evro&quot;, pronounced ), derived from the Georgian word for Europe, . Unlike in Greek and Armenian, the stress of the word &quot;evro&quot; falls on the first syllable, as is usual in Georgian. Cent is , as nativized Georgian nouns cannot end in a consonant, so a nominative ending &#x27;i&#x27; is added. The respective plurals of euro and cent are and .

===Hebrew===
When euro coins and banknotes were introduced, the question of the spelling and pronunciation of the currency&#x27;s name in Hebrew arose. The official name of the currency established by the Academy of the Hebrew Language and the Bank of Israel is , derived from (Europe).

An unofficial spelling and pronunciation , derived from the English pronunciation of the currency&#x27;s name, is also used.

Although in Hebrew currency names are usually declined for singular and plural, both forms of the Euro name are used for the singular and plural alike.

===Hindi===
In Hindi, the euro is spelt यूरो (yūro), while cent is written as सेंट (seṇṭ). Neither word is pluralised. Europe is known as यूरोप (Yūrop) in Hindi.

===Icelandic===
In Icelandic the euro is called &quot;&quot;, a feminine noun derived from the Icelandic name of Europe, &quot;&quot;; this makes Icelandic (with Faroese) one of only two European languages in which the word for the euro is feminine. The plural is formed regularly: &quot;&quot;. The cents are often called sent which is a neuter word and has the same form in the nominative plural. However, a more common usage is to write, say, 20 cents as &quot;0,20 evrur&quot;.

===Ido===
In Ido, there is a rule that &quot;every word pertaining to a national or local custom will get imported to the language without change or adaption, both the singular and the plural forms alike&quot; (known as &quot;vorti stranjera&quot; – foreign words). This gets especially applied to &quot;currencies, weights and measurements that don&#x27;t belong to the metric system&quot; (according to KGD, Kompleta Gramatiko Detaloza – Ido&#x27;s grammar book). Thus the best word for &quot;euro&quot; would be just &quot;euro&quot;, like &quot;dollar&quot; and &quot;pound&quot;, with the plural probably kept the same: &quot;euro&quot;, since most languages do that. In common speech, though, many Idists commonly refer to the currency as &quot;euro&quot; and as if it got fully adopted to the language because of the common use of the currency.

Similarly, &quot;cent&quot; is , with the plural imported from its source, English: &quot;cents&quot;.

For both words, there are two other possibilities for pluralization. The native plural could be added to the &quot;vorto stranjera&quot; with the dash to mark that it is a foreign word: &quot;cent-i&quot; and &quot;euro-i&quot;, or to add the plural definite article &quot;le&quot;: &quot;le cent&quot; and &quot;le euro&quot;, though that generally means &quot;the cents&quot; and &quot;the euros&quot;.

===Interslavic===
In Interslavic, the diphthongs /au/ and /eu/ are generally written as &quot;av&quot; and &quot;ev&quot;, which is common in Slovene, Sorbian and (usually) the Slavic languages that use Cyrillic. Thus, the Interslavic word for &quot;euro&quot; is &quot;evro&quot;, which is an indeclinable neuter noun. It can both be pronounced or .

The word for &quot;cent&quot; is &quot;cent&quot; (pronounced ), which is declined like an inanimate masculine noun: gen.sg. &quot;centa&quot;, nom.pl. &quot;centy&quot;, gen.pl. &quot;centov&quot;, etc.

===Japanese===
In Japanese the euro is called &quot;yūro&quot; (ユーロ) based on the English pronunciation, using the katakana syllabary employed for foreign words. However, the word for Europe in Japanese is &quot;yōroppa&quot; (ヨーロッパ), probably borrowed from the Portuguese &quot;Europa&quot; () or from the Dutch &quot;Europa&quot; (, not English. The cent uses the same word employed for all currencies using cents. This is rendered &quot;sento&quot; (or セント in the katakana script) and it is also based on the English pronunciation. In Japanese, like other East Asian languages, no plurals are used for units so both &quot;yūro&quot; and &quot;sento&quot; are used as the singular and plural.

===Korean===
In Korean of South Korea, the Euro is called &quot;yuro&quot; (유로) and Cent is called &quot;senteu&quot; (센트). The word for Europe in Korean is &quot;Yureop&quot; (유럽). They are all based on the English pronunciation.

===Latin===
Living Latin enthusiasts use , -&quot;onis&quot; (pl. &quot;eurones&quot;); sometimes also &quot;euronummus&quot;, (pl. &quot;euronummi&quot;), &quot;eurum&quot;, (pl. ) or even &quot;euronus&quot;, (pl. &quot;euroni&quot;)., as well as declining in the fourth declension as if it was a Greek name like &quot;echo&quot;.

===Leonese===
In Leonese, a language spoken in the Spanish provinces of León and Zamora, the word for &quot;euro&quot; is &quot;euru&quot;, the plural being &quot;euros&quot;.

===Luxembourgish===

In Luxembourgish the Euro is officially called &quot;Euro&quot; (), both in singular and plural forms, although the correct plural according to linguistic rules would normally be &quot;Euroën&quot; ().

The Cent is called &quot;Cent&quot; (), plural &quot;Cents&quot;.
In popular parlance the term &quot;Zantimm&quot; () is also used, a word derived from the French .

=== Manx ===
The Manx word for &quot;euro&quot; is either &quot;oarey&quot; (plural: &quot;oaraghyn&quot;), based on &quot;Yn Oarpey&quot; (&quot;Europe&quot;), or , from English. &quot;Cent&quot; is either &quot;kent&quot; (plural: &quot;kentyn&quot;) or &quot;sent&quot;.

===Mirandese===
Mirandese (a regional language spoken in the northeastern Portuguese region of Miranda do Douro) uses the prefix &quot;ou&quot; already present in words like &quot;European&quot; (&quot;Ouropeu&quot;). The singular form is &quot;ouro&quot; () and the plural form is &quot;ouros&quot; (). &quot;Ouro&quot; is also the Mirandese word for &#x27;gold&#x27;, as in Portuguese.

===Norwegian===
In Norwegian there could be a problem concerning the spelling, since euro is masculine and would normally take a plural -er ending in Bokmål and -ar in Nynorsk. But since words for foreign currencies (like &quot;dollar&quot; and &quot;yen&quot;) normally do not have the endings -er or -ar in Norwegian the Norwegian Language Council reached a decision in 1996 that the proper declension of the word euro should be

in Bokmål:

:&quot;en euro – euroen – euro – euroene&quot;

in Nynorsk:

:&quot;ein euro – euroen – euro – euroane&quot;

The declensions are respectively: The two first in Singular, and the two last in Plural, while the first of each category are indefinite, the last of each category are definite nouns. The word cent is an old loan word in Norwegian – and it is declined the same way:

in Bokmål:

:&quot;en cent – centen – cent – centene&quot;

in Nynorsk:

:&quot;ein cent – centen – cent – centane&quot;

The pronunciation of the two words in Norwegian are and .

===Romansh===
In Romansh, the words are and ; these are regular masculine nouns forming their plurals with -s, as &quot;euros&quot; and , respectively.

===Russian===
Russia currently borders four eurozone members: Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. They supply much of the euro inflow in Russia in trade exchange and tourism. In Russian, just like in Bulgarian, euro is spelt евро (&quot;jevro&quot;, pronounced ) both in the singular and the plural, while &quot;cent&quot; is цент (sg.) and центы (pl.), though there are many colloquial semi-ironic forms such as евры &#x27;jevry&#x27; or еврики &#x27;jevriki&#x27; (there&#x27;s no plural form for &quot;euro&quot; in Russian), копейки for cents and others. Just as in Italian, although евро could have been declined as a regular neuter noun, it was made indeclinable like many neutral loanwords ending in a vowel: бюро &quot;bureau, office, writing-desk&quot;, пальто &quot;overcoat&quot;, бордо &quot;Bordeaux wine, claret&quot; etc.; the same form is used in the singular and the plural. Cents are sometimes transliterated as цент &#x27;tsent&#x27; – singular, центы &#x27;tsenty&#x27; – plural. Numerative form is цент for 1 cent (as well as amounts that end in 1 except for the ones ending in 11 – e.g. 51 цент but 11 центов), центa, the genitive singular, for 2 to 4 cents (as well as any other amounts ending in 2, 3 or 4, except for the ones ending in 12, 13, 14 – e.g. 54 центa but 12 центoв) and центoв, genitive plural, for the rest – 88 центoв. Sometimes eвроцент (also romanized as &#x27;jevrocent&#x27; or &#x27;evrotsent&#x27;) is used to distinguish euro-cents from the American cents. (If евро had been treated as a regular neuter noun instead of being indeclinable, it would have the forms *евра (regular plural or genitive singular) and *евр (genitive plural), but this treatment would have been unusual for a loanword.)

===Scottish Gaelic===
Due to the lack of a governing body, there is no consistent usage regarding the terms for euro and cent in Scottish Gaelic. The various approaches include:

* use of English spellings (including the English plural form and pronunciation), treating the nouns as indeclinable: &quot;an euro&quot; (genitive &quot;an euro&quot;; plural &quot;na euro(s)&quot;), &quot;an cent&quot; (genitive &quot;an cent&quot;, plural &quot;na cent(s)&quot;)
* use of English spellings and pronunciation for euro but with Gaelic case marking (both masculine and feminine as the gender of the word has not been determined to date)
** as a masculine noun: &quot;an t-euro&quot; (genitive &quot;an euro&quot;, plural &quot;na h-euro(s)&quot;)
** as a feminine noun: &quot;an euro&quot; (genitive &quot;na h-euro&quot;, plural &quot;na h-euro(s)&quot;)
* fully gaelicized forms (based on the Gaelic word &quot;Eòrpa&quot; &quot;Europe&quot;) such as: &quot;an t-eòra&quot; (genitive &quot;an eòra&quot;, plural &quot;na h-eòrathan&quot;), &quot;an seant&quot; (genitive &quot;an t-seant&quot;, plural &quot;na seantaichean&quot;)

===Serbian===
In Serbian the euro and cent are called &quot;evro&quot; (Cyrillic: евро) and (Cyrillic: цент) . &quot;Evro&quot; is spelt with a &quot;v&quot; because it is derived from the name Европа/&quot;Evropa&quot; (Europe).

Both &quot;evro&quot; and are masculine nouns. They are inflected according to regular rules of the language:

* When not accompanied by a number, plural quantities are in whatever grammatical case is appropriate to the context: the nominative plurals are &quot;evri&quot; (Cyrillic: еври) and &quot;centi&quot; (Cyrillic: центи).
* When accompanied by a number ending with the digit 1 (except the combination 11) the singular form is used: &quot;21 evro&quot; (Cyrillic: 21 евро), &quot;101 cent&quot; (Cyrillic: 101 цент).
* When accompanied by a &quot;small number&quot;, i.e. one ending with the digit 2, 3 or 4 (except the combinations 12, 13, 14), the paucal form is used: &quot;22 evra&quot; (Cyrillic: 22 евра), &quot;102 centa&quot; (Cyrillic: 102 цента).
* When accompanied by a &quot;large number&quot;, i.e. one ending with a digit outside the 1–4 range (or one ending with any of the combination 11, 12, 13, 14) the genitive plural is used: &quot;111 evra&quot; (Cyrillic: 111 евра), &quot;25 centi&quot; (Cyrillic: 25 центи) or rarely &quot;25 centa&quot; (Cyrillic: 25 цента).

The genitive plural &quot;centi&quot; is produced in an old-fashioned way that is today mostly reserved for measurement units. The alternative &quot;centa&quot; follows the vastly more common pattern of other masculine nouns but is very rarely heard in practice.

===Turkish===
Turkey and Northern Cyprus continue to use the Turkish lira as their official currency, but the euro is popularly used, particularly by individuals wanting to convert their savings into a more stable currency. &quot;Euro&quot; has been pronounced by a majority similar to the English fashion (phonetically transcribed in Turkish as &quot;yuro&quot;) since its inception, although it has been reported in 2004 that pronunciations based on French (phonetically transcribed in Turkish as &quot;öro&quot;) and to a lesser degree German (phonetically transcribed in Turkish as &quot;oyro&quot;) were also used by a minority.

In response to criticism of the widespread English pronunciation of &quot;euro&quot;, the Turkish Language Association officially introduced &quot;avro&quot; into Turkish (&quot;av&quot; being the first syllable of the Turkish word for Europe, &quot;Avrupa&quot;) in 1998. A concerted campaign by the Turkish Language Association has begun to blossom in recent years, with most sections of the Turkish media now using the new word. It has yet to enter widespread colloquial use, however. It has been reported in 2004 that the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey prefers the usage of euro over &quot;avro&quot;.

===Ukrainian===
The euro is becoming relatively widespread in Ukraine although the country did not border the eurozone until 1 January 2009. In standard literary Ukrainian the name is (). The same form is used in singular and plural cases. Cents are translated as in the singular and in the plural. In the Ukrainian language there is some variation in cases. Numerative form is for 1 cent (as well as amounts that end in 1 except for the ones ending in 11 – e.g. but ), центи for 2 to 4 cents (as well as any other amounts ending in 2, 3 or 4, except for the ones ending in 12, 13, 14 – e.g. but 12 ) and центів for the rest – . Sometimes is used to distinguish eurocents from American cents.

===Welsh===
In the Welsh language, the terms for &quot;euro&quot; and &quot;cent&quot; are (plural: &#x27; ) and &#x27; (plural: &#x27; ) respectively. Grammatical points to note about their usage include the fact that in Welsh, numerals are followed by singular nouns, for example, &#x27; &quot;five euros&quot;, &quot;ten cents&quot;, and that is a masculine noun whereas is feminine, thus affecting the form of the numeral that precedes them, for example, &quot;three euros&quot; but &quot;three cents&quot;.

Informally, the more Anglicised pronunciation may be used, written either with the standard spelling or as &#x27; or English &quot;.&quot; The word , however, is a separate word in Welsh meaning &quot;to gild&quot; (from &#x27; &quot;gold&quot;). It should also be noted that the Welsh abbreviation &#x27; stands for &#x27; &quot;penny, pence&quot;.

<text>HMCS &quot;Vancouver&quot; is a , of the Royal Canadian Navy launched on 8 July 1989, as the second vessel of her class. She is based at CFB Esquimalt on the west coast of Canada, and is the third vessel to be named after Vancouver, British Columbia.

==Description and design==
The &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigate design of which &quot;Vancouver&quot; belongs, was ordered by the Canadian Forces in 1977 as a replacement for the aging , , , and es of destroyer escorts, which were all tasked with anti-submarine warfare. In July 1983, the federal government approved the budget for the design and construction of the first batch of six new frigates of which &quot;Vancouver&quot; was a part, out of twelve that were eventually built. To reflect the changing long-term strategy of the Navy during the 1980s and 1990s, the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigates was designed as a general purpose warship with particular focus on anti-submarine capabilities.

As built, the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class vessels displaced and were long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . That made them slightly larger than the &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyers. The vessels are propelled by two shafts with Escher Wyss controllable pitch propellers driven by a CODOG system of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, generating and one SEMT Pielstick 20 PA6 V 280 diesel engine, generating .

This gives the frigates a maximum speed of and a range of at while using their diesel engines. Using their gas turbines, the ships have a range of at . The &quot;Halifax&quot; class have a complement of 198 naval personnel of which 17 are officers and 17 aircrew of which 8 are officers.

===Armament and aircraft===
As built the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class vessels deployed the CH-124 Sea King helicopter, which acted in concert with shipboard sensors to seek out and destroy submarines at long distances from the ships. The ships have a helicopter deck fitted with a &quot;bear trap&quot; system allowing the launch and recovery of helicopters in up to sea state 6. The &quot;Halifax&quot; class also carries a close-in anti-submarine weapon in the form of the Mark 46 torpedo, launched from twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo tubes in launcher compartments either side of the forward end of the helicopter hangar.

As built, the anti-shipping role is supported by the RGM-84 Harpoon Block 1C surface-to-surface missile, mounted in two quadruple launch tubes at the main deck level between the funnel and the helicopter hangar. For anti-aircraft self-defence the ships are armed with the Sea Sparrow vertical launch surface-to-air missile in two Mk 48 Mod 0 eight-cell launchers placed to port and starboard of the funnel. The vessels carry 16 missiles. A Raytheon/General Dynamics Phalanx Mark 15 Mod 21 Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) is mounted on top of the helicopter hangar for &quot;last-ditch&quot; defence against targets that evade the Sea Sparrow.

As built, the main gun on the forecastle is a /70 calibre Mark 2 gun from Bofors. The gun is capable of firing shells at a rate of 220 rounds per minute at a range of more than .

===Countermeasures and sensors===
As built, the decoy system comprises Two BAE Systems Shield Mark 2 decoy launchers which fire chaff to and infrared rockets to in distraction, confusion and centroid seduction modes. The torpedo decoy is the AN/SLQ-25A Nixie towed acoustic decoy from Argon ST. The ship&#x27;s radar warning receiver, the CANEWS (Canadian Electronic Warfare System), SLQ-501, and the radar jammer, SLQ-505, were developed by Thorn and Lockheed Martin Canada.

Two Thales Nederland (formerly Signaal) SPG-503 (STIR 1.8) fire control radars are installed one on the roof of the bridge and one on the raised radar platform immediately forward of the helicopter hangar. The ship is also fitted with Raytheon AN/SPS-49(V)5 long-range active air search radar operating at C and D bands, Ericsson HC150 Sea Giraffe medium-range air and surface search radar operating at G and H bands, and Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. The sonar suite includes the CANTASS Canadian Towed Array and GD-C AN/SQS-510 hull mounted sonar and incorporates an acoustic range prediction system. The sonobuoy processing system is the GD-C AN/UYS-503.

===Modernization===
The &quot;Halifax&quot; class underwent a modernization program, known as the Halifax Class Modernization (HCM) program, in order to update the frigates&#x27; capabilities in combating modern smaller, faster and more mobile threats. This involved upgrading the command and control, radar, communications, electronic warfare and armament systems. Further improvements, such as modifying the vessel to accommodate the new Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter and satellite communication links was done separately as part of the FELEX program.

The Frigate Equipment Life Extension (FELEX) program comprised upgrading the combat systems integration to CMS330. The SPS-49 2D long range air search radar was replaced by the Thales Nederland SMART-S Mk 2 E/F-band 3D surveillance radar, and the two STIR 1.8 fire control radars were replaced by a pair of CEROS 200 Fire Control radars. A Telephonics IFF Mode 5/S interrogator was installed and the Elisra NS9003A-V2HC ESM system replaced the SLQ-501 CANEWS. An IBM multi-link (Link 11, Link 16 and Link 22 enabled) datalink processing system was installed along with two Raytheon Anschütz Pathfinder Mk II navigation radars. Furthermore, Rheinmetall&#x27;s Multi-Ammunition Soft kill System (MASS), known as MASS DUERAS was introduced to replace the Plessey Shield decoy system. The existing 57 mm Mk 2 guns were upgraded to the Mk 3 standard and the Harpoon missiles were improved to Block II levels, the Phalanx was upgraded to Block 1B and the obsolete Sea Sparrow system was replaced by the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile.

==Construction and career==
The frigate&#x27;s keel was laid down on 19 May 1988 by Saint John Shipbuilding at Saint John, New Brunswick, the second ship of her class. &quot;Vancouver&quot; was launched on 8 July 1989. After trials, the warship was commissioned on 23 August 1993 in her namesake city of Vancouver alongside Canada Place, third ship of the class, as sister ship commissioned almost a month before her. After commissioning, she was assigned to CFB Esquimalt, British Columbia on Vancouver Island as the first &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigate to be based there.

From May to July 1994, the frigate took part in the RIMPAC naval exercise off the coast of Hawaii. The ship then made a training cruise around the Pacific, making several port visits. The following year, &quot;Vancouver&quot;, with sister ship , deployed on another Pacific training cruise. In 1995, the frigate deployed with a United States Navy carrier battle group. In 1997, &quot;Vancouver&quot; performed another Pacific training cruise and in 1998, took part in the RIMPAC naval exercise. &quot;Vancouver&quot;, accompanied by , visited Vladivostok, Russia, marking only the second time Canadian warships visited the country since the fall of the Soviet Union.

===War on Terror===

After the 11 September 2001 attacks, &quot;Vancouver&quot; and her sisters were a primary part of Canada&#x27;s anti-terrorism naval forces in the Middle East. For instance, &quot;Vancouver&quot; was an integrated part of the American carrier battle group led by , arriving at Hong Kong on 29 November 2001 and in the Persian Gulf in 19 December. The frigate performed maritime interdiction operations in the Gulf, enforcing sanctions on Iraq. The ship returned to Esquimalt on 28 May 2002.
During Operation Apollo, &quot;Vancouver&quot; was used to intercept suspicious and unknown vessels at sea, and had on occasion boarded vessels to prevent the escape of fugitives and the transit of contraband. After a tour of duty in the Arabian Sea, her role in Apollo ended. She was replaced by another &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigate to serve much the same role. &quot;Vancouver&quot; has spent time flying the Canadian flag more locally, including a trip to Oregon in 2003 and a visit to her namesake city of Vancouver to celebrate the tenth anniversary of her being commissioned.

===2011 Libyan civil war===

On 10 July 2011, &quot;Vancouver&quot; left her home port of Esquimalt to join the NATO-led air-sea Operation Unified Protector during the 2011 Libyan civil war. She was delayed by a small fire in her boiler. The fire was detected quickly and dealt with, delaying her departure only by an hour. The overall Canadian Forces contribution to Operation Unified Protector is known as Operation Mobile. She relieved , which had been on patrol in the region since the early spring. Operation Mobile closed on 1 November 2011, &quot;Vancouver&quot; was transferred to the NATO-led Operation Active Endeavour on 15 November 2011. She set course for her home port of CFB Esquimalt on 10 January 2012.

===Refit===
On 6 May 2013 &quot;Vancouver&quot; was turned over to Seaspan Marine Corporation&#x27;s Victoria Shipyards, to start an 18-month mid-life upgrading and modernization program. The HCM/FELEX refit was completed in May 2014.

=== Harpoon Block II testing ===
In October 2015, &quot;Vancouver&quot;, along with and , participated in the United States Navy&#x27;s Task Group Exercise, a naval exercise held off southern California. In April 2016, &quot;Vancouver&quot; was used as the testbed for the launch of the new Harpoon Block II surface-to-surface missile, increasing the land strike capabilities of the frigate class.

=== Pacific deployment ===
In June 2016, &quot;Calgary&quot;, &quot;Vancouver&quot;, and sailed from Esquimalt to participate in the RIMPAC naval exercise. Following RIMPAC, &quot;Vancouver&quot; was sent on a training cruise around the Pacific, making several port visits and participating in the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s training exercise &quot;Kakadu&quot;.

&quot;Vancouver&quot; was sent to take part in the Royal New Zealand Navy&#x27;s 75th Birthday Celebrations on 19–21 November 2016. However, following an earthquake in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, the frigate was re-directed to Kaikōura to aide in humanitarian and disaster relief operations. In 2018, &quot;Vancouver&quot; deployed to the Pacific, participating in training with the Fijian Navy. In June and July 2018, &quot;Vancouver&quot;, along with sister ship and the supply ship , took part in RIMPAC 2018 around the Hawaiian Islands.

In 2022, &quot;Vancouver&quot; and were deployed to the RIMPAC naval exercise off Hawaii followed by taking part in enforcing UN sanctions against North Korea. In September 2022, &quot;Vancouver&quot; sailed through the Taiwan Strait alongside the guided-missile destroyer in a freedom-of-navigation demonstration. In mid 2024, &quot;Vancouver&quot; took part in the multi-national exercise RIMPAC 2024 along with and &quot;Asterix&quot;.

==Badge==
The ship&#x27;s badge depicts a square-rigged, Royal Navy ship of the line sailing west along the ocean. The vessel in the badge is intended to represent , which, under the command of Captain George Vancouver, mapped much of North America&#x27;s north-western coast and learned more about the area than had hereto been discovered. Among the geographical locations named after &quot;Vancouver&quot; is the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. The badge has been maintained through the history of all three Canadian vessels named &quot;Vancouver&quot;.

<text>Batis (turtleweed, saltwort, beachwort, or pickleweed) is a genus of two species of flowering plants, the only genus in the family Bataceae. They are halophytic (salt tolerant) plants, native to the coastal salt marshes of warm temperate and tropical America (&quot;B. maritima&quot;) and tropical Australasia (&quot;B. argillicola&quot;).

==Morphology and taxonomy==
Both species are evergreen, low shrubs growing to 10–70 cm tall, prostrate where colonizing new mud, but once rooted, growing bushy. The leaves are small, swollen, fleshy, and narrowly club-shaped. They are bright green, but can also take on a reddish color. The flowers are small, produced in nonshowy spikes, flowering from midsummer to fall. The American species is dioecious, while the Australasian species is monoecious.

Some botanists divide &quot;B. maritima&quot; into five species, with &quot;B. californica&quot;, &quot;B. fruticosa&quot;, &quot;B. spinosa&quot; and &quot;B. vermiculatus&quot; split off, but this interpretation is not widely followed.

==Range and habitat==
&quot;Batis&quot; has the ability to live in salty environments. When other plants are exposed to salty soil or water, they lose most of their stored water, but &quot;Batis&quot; has adapted to this environment and does not have these problems. To help it survive in this salty habitat, its fleshy leaves are covered with very fine hairs that reduce the amount of water the plant loses to the air.

An example habitat of occurrence of &quot;Batis maritima&quot; is in the Petenes mangroves ecoregion of the Yucatán.

Not many animals can eat it because it is too salty, but white-tailed deer eat &quot;B. maritima&quot; as part of their diets. Eastern pygmy-blue butterflies collect the nectar from its flowers. &quot;B. maritima&quot; is becoming rare in some areas, and some scientists think it should be added to the United States endangered species list, though it has also become an invasive species in Hawaii after accidental introduction there.

==Terminology==
The genus &quot;Salsola&quot; is also sometimes known as saltwort, but is unrelated.

==Uses==
&quot;Batis maritima&quot; was used by Native Americans as a food, the roots were chewed (like sugar cane) or boiled into a beverage, while the stems and leaves were eaten raw, cooked or pickled. &quot;B. argillicola&quot; is also eaten as a green vegetable.

An analysis of saltwort&#x27;s peppercorn-sized seeds has revealed they are extremely nutritious, having high quantities of proteins, oils, and starches . The seeds are edible, having a nutty taste, and they can be added to salads, toasted, or even made into miniature popcorn. 
The oil is almost identical to safflower oil, which is used for cooking and in salad dressings, as well as for making margarine. The seeds also contain beneficial antioxidants, such as tocopherols, which are thought to fight cancer.

<text>The Colne Valley Museum is in the Colne Valley at Golcar, Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England. The museum consists of four converted 19th-century weavers&#x27; cottages. The museum provides an insight into what life was like for a weaver in the early 1850s. The museum includes a clog-maker&#x27;s workshop, a handloom chamber, a spinning room, a cropping room, kitchen and living rooms. The museum is run entirely by volunteers.

==History==
The original row of four cottages was built in the 1840s by James and Sally Pearson, who were independent cloth manufacturers. It was built into a steep hillside with a traditional entrance for the lower rooms and a separate entrance to the upper floor at the rear of the cottages. In 1970, three of the cottages were converted to house the museum. The cottages we’re named Spring Rock.

The museum features several restored period rooms, which are also used for temporary exhibits. Permanent exhibits include a handloom and a spinning jenny, invented by James Hargreaves, a weaver&#x27;s sitting room and gas-lit clogger&#x27;s shop.

The museum is open for school visits, for which children are encouraged to dress in period clothing, from Monday to Friday. Some weekends the museum opens for demonstrations and exhibitions by the volunteer helpers, who demonstrate the types of craft that would have existed during the 19th century.

<doc id="1096536" wikidata="Q1138991" url="?curid=1096536" title="Yenko Camaro">
<text>The Yenko Super Camaro was a modified Chevrolet Camaro prepared by Yenko Chevrolet, developed by the dealership owner and racer, Don Yenko, and subsequently aided by special parts ordering directly through Chevrolet.

The Yenko dealership did not merely install performance parts, it also made modifications and provided race track ready tuning.

==Background==

When the Camaro debuted, a General Motors corporate edict prevented it from carrying an engine larger than 400 in³ (6.6 L) V8. This put the Camaro at a disadvantage with pony car rival Plymouth Barracuda since Plymouth had no such limit. Although Ford did not, its largest offering in the Mustang, the 390 V8, was six cubic inches smaller than the largest Chevrolet engine available in a Camaro (396). Don Yenko and others knew there was a market for a more powerful Camaro and found ways around the GM limit.

==1967==

Yenko ordered L78 equipped SS Camaros and swapped in the Chevrolet Corvette&#x27;s L72 427 in³ (7.0 L) V8. The cars came with a 4.10 rear end and heavy-duty suspension. The approximate number of cars produced is 54. Yenko also installed a fiberglass replacement hood similar to the &quot;Stinger&quot; hood featured on 1967 big-block Corvettes. The Camaros were equipped with a M21 transmission. The horsepower was rated at .

==1968==

Encouraged by the success of the 1967 model, Yenko continued to produce his Yenko Super Camaros for 1968. The 1968 Yenko Super Camaros started life as Super Sports with L78 396 in³ hp engine and close ratio 4-speed Muncie transmission. Yenko also ordered the cars with COPO 9737 which included a speedometer, a larger 1 1/8th inch front anti-sway bar, and a special trim tag. Yenko swapped out the factory 396 in³ big-block for the L72 427 in³ big-block reusing the rest of the 396 in³ engine&#x27;s components including the heads, carburetor, intake manifold, etc. He swapped the stock hood for a twin-snorkel fiberglass hood, added Pontiac&#x27;s 14&quot;x6&quot; steel wheels with special Yenko caps, and placed Yenko emblems on the front grill, front fenders and tail panel. 427 emblems were added to the tail panel and front fenders as well. The cars had a Yenko Super Camaro serial-numbered tag in the driver&#x27;s side door jamb and Stewart Warner pedestal-mounted tachometer and gauges were installed in the interior. Early cars got a rear spoiler made for Yenko, and later cars all got factory spoilers front and rear. The recognized production number for these cars is approximately 64 cars converted, with well less than half of that number known to exist today.

==1969==
For 1969, the dealership worked with Chevrolet to have the L72 engines installed on the factory assembly line using a Central Office Production Order, or COPO. The orders included power disc brakes, spoilers, cowl-induction hood, a 4.10 Positraction rear end with gears that were heat treated for strength, a bigger front sway bar, and a heavy-duty 4-row radiator. Buyers of the car had the option of either the M-21 four speed or the Turbo Hydramatic 400 automatic transmission. A total of 201 cars were sold in 1969, 171 with four speed transmissions and 30 with automatic transmissions. Yenko rounded out the visual package with special &quot;Yenko 427&quot; badges, stripes down the sides and hood, and the sYc (Yenko Super Car) on the headrests. According to the Camaro Research Group, standard black interior (code 711) was the only interior ordered by Yenko in 69.

==1981==
The 1981 Yenko Turbo Z was based on a 1981 Camaro. Don Yenko&#x27;s comments on the car are:

==1969 Continuation Series==

In 2007, a company in North Carolina called Classic Automotive Restoration Specialists restarted production of the 1969 Yenko Camaro. Don Yenko sold 201 of his famous COPO-program Camaros out of his Canonsburg, PA dealership. As reported in the March &#x27;08 issue of Muscle Car Review, the vehicle is a fully licensed and certified Yenko starting at #202. The 427 in³ engine under the hood was built by GM who has brought back the big block engines from the muscle car era. The rest of the components took 2½ years to track down the original tooling. Options offered on the vehicle are the same as was available in 1969 including paint colors. The car costs around 60% less than some of the current 43-year-old Yenko Camaro survivors but drives like the old car would have when it was new from the dealership. Two known people own Yenko&#x27;s Camaros.

==2010==

A new Yenko Camaro based on the new 2010 Camaro platform was introduced at SEMA 2009. The new engine is a supercharged version of GM&#x27;s LS3, the 6.2-liter V8 that comes standard with the Camaro SS. Since it is only the Phase I Yenko, it is expected that Phase II and Phase III Yenkos are coming which will have a Z06-sourced LS7 427 in³ engine and possibly even an LS9. 

==2016-2020==
In 2016 Specialty Vehicle Engineering, Inc. announced that they&#x27;ll be making custom SYC Yenko Camaros based on the new sixth generation Chevrolet Camaro these cars featured a custom Supercharged &quot;LT1&quot; V8 rating from 750Hp-1000hp.

For 2024 Yenko Camaros will come out in three stages ranging from 1050 HP automatic or manual, aluminum block LT4 Stage 1, to manual only 1500 HP stage 3 based on GM&#x27;s L8T iron block.

<text>William Cecil, 16th Baron Ros of Helmsley (May 1590 – 27 June 1618) was an English peer, whose ill-advised marriage to Anne Lake resulted in a major scandal, which dragged on for years after his early death.

He was born at Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire, only son of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter, and baptised on 4 June 1590. In 1591, he inherited the barony of de Ros from his mother, Elizabeth Cecil, 15th Baroness de Ros.

In 1611, Roos embarked upon the early 17th-century version of the later Grand Tour, accompanied by a tutor. Whilst in Europe, Roos exhibited apparent Catholic sympathies: he &quot;regularly dined and conversed with Catholic priests and visited English Catholics living in Brussels. Rumors of Roos’s potential conversion to Catholicism persisted during his educational travels&quot;.

On 13 February 1615 or 1616, he married Anne Lake, daughter of Sir Thomas Lake, the Secretary of State, and his wife Mary Ryther, a marriage which soon ended in divorce and a bitter feud between the two families, caused in the first place by the Cecil family&#x27;s refusal to transfer lands allegedly due to Anne as part of the marriage settlement. Anne, her mother and other family members made lurid and entirely false allegations against Cecil. Cecil challenged his brother-in-law Sir Arthur Lake, generally regarded as the prime mover in the affair, to a duel, but Arthur refused the challenge.

The accusations, which included adultery with his grandfather&#x27;s young second wife Frances Brydges, were so serious that he felt it wiser to leave the country for a time. He was sent by King James I on a special mission to the Holy Roman Emperor. Eventually, a thorough investigation concluded that all the charges against Cecil had been fabricated by the Lake family, several of whom were severely punished by Star Chamber as a result. The matter was not finally resolved until 1621, by which time William was dead.

He died aged 28 without issue. Since his father and grandfather both outlived him, the Earldom of Exeter passed to his first cousin David Cecil, 3rd Earl of Exeter. His mother&#x27;s barony passed separately to her next heir, Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland. Cecil&#x27;s ex-wife Anne remarried George Rodney of Stoke Rodney, Somerset, and died in 1630.

<doc id="1096541" wikidata="Q3497552" url="?curid=1096541" title="Oliver Stanley">
<text>Oliver Frederick George Stanley (4 May 1896 – 10 December 1950) was a prominent British Conservative politician who held many ministerial posts before his early death.

==Background and education==
Stanley was the second son of Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, by his wife Lady Alice, daughter of William Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester. Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley, was his elder brother. He was educated at Eton, but did not proceed to the University of Oxford due to the outbreak of the First World War.

==Military career==
During the First World War, Stanley was commissioned into the Lancashire Hussars, before transferring to the Royal Field Artillery in 1915. He achieved the rank of captain, and won both the Military Cross and the Croix de Guerre.

==Political career==
After he was demobilised, Stanley was called to the bar by Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1919. In the 1924 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Westmorland. From 1945 he sat for Bristol West.

=== Ministerial career ===

He soon came to the attention of the Conservative leaders and held a number of posts in the National Government of the 1930s. As Minister of Transport he was responsible for the introduction of a 30 miles per hour speed limit and driving tests for new drivers. In May 1938 whilst President of the Board of Trade he achieved a rare distinction in British politics when his brother Lord Stanley became Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs – a rare example of two brothers sitting in the same Cabinet, more so as their father, a former Conservative minister, was still alive. Nevertheless, five months later Edward died. (Another example is that of two Labour Party brothers, David Miliband and his brother Ed Miliband, who were appointed to the British Cabinet in June 2007.)

In January 1940 Stanley was appointed Secretary of State for War after the previous incumbent, Leslie Hore-Belisha, had been sacked after falling out with the leading officers. Much was expected of Stanley&#x27;s tenure in this office, for his father had held it during the First World War, but four months later the government fell, and Stanley was replaced by Anthony Eden. Churchill offered Stanley the Dominions Office, which Stanley turned down. Instead, Churchill made him a personal link with intelligence agencies, notably as founder of the London Controlling Section. Two years later Stanley&#x27;s political fortunes revived when Churchill appointed him Secretary of State for the Colonies, a post which he held until the end of the war.

=== Last years ===

After the Conservatives&#x27; massive defeat in the 1945 general election Stanley was prominent amongst those rebuilding the party, and he came to be regarded as one of the most important Conservative MPs. He was a governor of The Peckham Experiment in 1949. Along with Churchill and Anthony Eden, Stanley was seen as one of the Conservative Party&#x27;s leaders in 1950. He succeeded his father as Chancellor of the University of Liverpool. By this time, however, his health was in decline; and he died on 10 December 1950 at his home in Sulhamstead.

Stanley had been Chairman of the Conservative Finance Committee. Had he lived longer, he might well have been appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer when the Conservatives formed a government the following year. Rab Butler was appointed instead. Butler later wrote in his 1971 memoirs that Oliver Stanley was “the acutest brain on the Conservative front bench, the keenest lance I have ever known in politics, and a flowing pen which could [write] several pages of immaculate foolscap in the same time that lesser men would take to wrote a decent paragraph”. However, Butler’s view was that he probably would not have been a great Prime Minister or even Chancellor of the Exchequer, as he was too indecisive, but that he was great in opposition.

Historian Sir Charles Petrie went further, and argued in his 1972 memoirs (&quot;A Historian Looks At His World&quot;) that &quot;the greatest blow the Conservative Party has sustained since the late war was the premature death of Oliver Stanley. He was one of the most gifted men of the century, and would have made a very great Prime Minister. ... He was as brilliant a conversationalist as a public speaker.&quot;

==Family==
Stanley married Lady Maureen Vane-Tempest-Stewart, daughter of Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 7th Marquess of Londonderry, and the Hon. Edith Chaplin, in 1920. They had one son and one daughter:

<text>Eponymous is the first greatest hits album by the American alternative rock band R.E.M., released in 1988. It was their last authorized release on I.R.S. Records, to whom they had been contracted since 1982, having just signed with Warner Bros. Records.

&quot;Eponymous&quot; includes several alternative versions of songs, including the soundtrack contribution &quot;Romance&quot;, which had not previously appeared on an R.E.M. record. Spanning from the initial single release of &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot; to the previous year&#x27;s breakthrough hit album &quot;Document&quot;, &quot;Eponymous&quot; provides a fair overview of R.E.M.&#x27;s early work.

The album features the alternate title &quot;File Under Grain&quot;, a reference to the cover photograph. A previous album, &quot;Document&quot;, had &quot;File Under Fire&quot; inscribed on it, and &quot;Reckoning&quot; featured the words &quot;File Under Water&quot;. On the reverse of the LP cover is a photograph of singer Michael Stipe with the words &quot;They Airbrushed My Face&quot; above his head. The photo is the senior portrait taken of Stipe while at Collinsville High School in Collinsville, Illinois. It appears in the Class of 1978 high school year book. The &quot;doodles&quot; on the front cover are the work of Stipe. He asked Tom Laune, the engineer at Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, to photocopy them and make them larger.

Released in October 1988, just a month before R.E.M.&#x27;s Warner Bros. debut &quot;Green&quot; appeared, &quot;Eponymous&quot; reached #44 in the US and #69 in the UK.

<doc id="1096549" wikidata="Q757670" url="?curid=1096549" title="California State Route 72">
<text>State Route 72 (SR 72) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California. The route runs along Whittier Boulevard in the Los Angeles area from SR 39 in La Habra to Interstate 605 in Whittier. SR 72 forms part of El Camino Real.

==Route description==
The California Streets and Highways Code defines Route 72 in section 372 as follows:

Route 72 is from Route 39 to Route 605 in Whittier

Section 372 subdivision (a) of the code also states that Route 72 will be deleted from the state highway system upon completed construction of Route 90, also known as the Slauson Freeway, from Route 5 to Route 39, but Caltrans has abandoned all plans to finish the freeway. Subdivision (c) also permits the state to relinquish to Whittier and unincorporated Los Angeles County the portion of Route 72 within their respective jurisdictional limits. If a relinquishment under this subdivision were to take effect, the western terminus of Route 72 would be moved to the Orange County line at Valley Home Avenue, making the entire route approximately half-a-mile long.

Route 72 officially begins at the junction of I-605 in Whittier. The route follows Whittier Boulevard for its entire length, heading southeast through Whittier as a four-lane arterial street. SR 72 crosses with Los Angeles County Route N8 at Colima Road and ends at the intersection of SR-39 (Beach Boulevard) in La Habra. Whittier Boulevard is a major commercial corridor in Whittier, though it does not go through the city center, which is north of the highway.

The route formerly continued west under a railroad bridge near Pio Pico State Historic Park and then over the San Gabriel River as it entered Pico Rivera and met State Route 19 at Rosemead Boulevard. After about a mile and a half, the route crossed a narrow steel bridge over the Rio Hondo into Montebello. There, it continued towards Atlantic Boulevard. From there, it continued further to its end at Downey Road. Whittier Boulevard itself continues past Downey Road towards downtown Los Angeles. These segments have been relinquished back to the cities of Pico Rivera and Montebello, and are not included in the length of SR 72.

Despite the fact that the route&#x27;s current alignment primarily goes west along Whittier Boulevard from Beach Boulevard to I-605, SR 72 is defined in the state highway code as a north–south state route. This reflects the original alignment and length of SR 72 before the highway was shortened (see below).

SR 72 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

==History==
California&#x27;s historic El Camino Real, which connected the Alta California missions, ran along what was then U.S. Route 101. Before 1964, U.S. Route 101 continued past today&#x27;s end near the East Los Angeles Interchange east onto Whittier Boulevard and south on Harbor Boulevard until it met its bypass in Anaheim. (What is now Route 5 from Los Angeles to Anaheim was the U.S. Route 101 Bypass.)

In 1964, the U.S. Route 101 designation was removed south of the East L.A. Interchange. Its routing on Whittier and Harbor Boulevards became Route 72 and was initially defined to run from Route 5 (the former bypass) to an unbuilt State Route 245, hence the route&#x27;s lackluster end at Downey Road. (Route 245 was to have been a bypass connecting Route 5 with Route 60, a function that was eventually assumed by an extended Route 710.)

In 1965, with Route 245 deleted, the definition was clarified to have Route 72 end at Downey Road, which was parallel to the planned Route 245.

In 1981, the portion from Route 5 to Harbor Boulevard (current Route 39) was deleted, and the portion from Harbor Boulevard to Route 39 was transferred to State Route 39.

In 1992, the portion from Atlantic Boulevard to Downey Road was deleted.

In 2010, SB-1318 Sec. 20 deleted the segment between I-605 and Atlantic Boulevard. It also states that Route 72 will be deleted when &quot;Route 90 freeway is completed from Route 5 to Route 39.&quot;
includes unspecified parts of Route 72 in El Camino Real.

<text>Pukapuka, formerly Danger Island, is a coral atoll in the northern group of the Cook Islands in the Pacific Ocean. It is one of the most remote islands of the Cook Islands, situated about northwest of Rarotonga. On this small island, an ancient culture and distinct language have been maintained over many centuries. The population of Pukapuka is around 400 people. 

== Etymology ==
The traditional name for the atoll is (&quot;The Head of the Rock&quot;), The modern name Pukapuka (sometimes written as Bukabuka) originally applied to the main island of the atoll, and is of uncertain etymology. In modern times, the main island is often called Wale (&quot;Home&quot;).

Pukapuka has been given various names by European explorers. Pedro Fernandes de Queirós sighted an island in 1595, likely Pukapuka, and called this San Bernardo. On 21 June 1665 John Byron sighted Pukapuka, calling it Islands of Danger, as he was unable to land due to high surf. A version of this name, Danger Island, became common use in English. French captain Pierre François Péron named the atoll (&quot;Islands of the Otter&quot;) when he visited on 3 April 1796.

==Geography==

Pukapuka is shaped like a three-bladed fan. There are three islets on the roughly triangular reef, with a total land area of approximately . Motu Kō, the biggest island, is to the southeast; Motu Kotawa (Frigatebird Island) is to the southwest; and the main island Wale is to the north. Toka sand cay is to the west of the atoll, separated from Motu Kotawa by a reef. Kō and Motu Kotawa are uninhabited food reserves, with taro and pulaka gardens and coconut plantations. Pukapuka Airport (ICAO: NCPK / IATA: PZK) is on Kō.

The three villages are located on the crescent-shaped bay of the northernmost islet of the atoll: Yātō (West), Loto (Central) and Ngake (East). Loto (Roto on most maps) is host to the Island Administration. The traditional names for these villages are Takanumi, Kotipolo and Te Lāngaikula. In daily life, the islanders frequently call them Tiapani (Japan), Malike or Amelika (United States) and Ōlani (Holland) respectively. In sports competitions between the villages, the villagers use the names and flags of these countries.

The submerged Tima Reef is situated 23 km southeast of Pukapuka. About 60 km away is Nassau (Cook Islands) which is owned by the people of Pukapuka and considered part of it for administrative purposes. Since the 1950s it has been governed by the Council of Chiefs of Pukapuka. The Nassau Island Committee advises the Pukapuka Island Committee on matters relating to its own island.

==History==

Human settlement of Pukapuka can be dated back about 1,000 years, after the sea level stabilised to its present height. According to oral tradition the island was discovered by Tamayei, a god from Tonga, and settled by ancestors from Tonga. The atoll served as a connecting hub between West and East Polynesia – a role that is reflected in Pukapukan material culture, and language, which is Samoic with a Tokelauan influence. Pukapukan traditions speak of frequent passages to Tuvalu, Tokelau, Niue, Tonga, Rarotonga and Tahiti, and basalt used for many of their adze blades can be geochemically traced to a quarry on Tutuila (Samoa). Tahitians are known to have passed through Pukapuka en route to islands in Samoa and Tonga.

The original population is likely to have numbered 1000 or more, but has recovered from extremely low numbers more than once. Oral traditions refer to at least two episodes of civil war, and inundation of the atoll from a major tsunami or cyclone, in which only two women and 15 men survived.

The island was first discovered by Europeans in 1595, when the Spanish explorer Álvaro de Mendaña saw it on the feast day of Saint Bernard and named it San Bernardo. It was sighted again in 1765 by a British Naval expedition under Commodore John Byron, who named it the &quot;Islands of Danger&quot; because of the reefs and the high surf that made it too dangerous to land. The name &quot;Danger Island&quot; still appears on some maps. According to oral tradition, an unknown ship called at Pukapuka in the mid 18th century, and when the Yalongo lineage chief Tāwaki boldly took the captain&#x27;s pipe out of his mouth, he was shot.

Thirty years later, Pukapuka was given the name &quot;Isles de la Loutre&quot; (Isles of the Otter) by Pierre François Péron, a French adventurer who was acting as first mate on board the American merchant ship (Captain Ebenezer Dorr) after it was sighted on 3 April 1796. The following day, Péron, Thomas Muir of Huntershill (1765–1799), and a small party landed ashore but the inhabitants would not allow them to inspect the island. Trading later took place near the ship, when adzes, mats and other artifacts were exchanged for knives and European goods.

&quot;Everything united to convince us that we had the right to attribute to ourselves the honour of having discovered three new islands; and with this conviction I gave them the name &#x27;Isles of the Otter&#x27; (&#x27;Isles de la Loutre&#x27;) which was the name of our vessel. In order to distinguish them, we named the eastern one &#x27;Peron and Muir&#x27; [Motu Kō], the one to the north &#x27;Dorr&#x27; [Pukapuka], and the name of &#x27;Brown&#x27; was given to the third [Motu Kotawa], after one of our officers.&quot; Péron believed that they were the first to discover the island, mostly because the people were so afraid of them. The Pukapukans&#x27; fear of the visitors was because Tāwaki had been killed during the ship visit about 30 years previously.

Because of Pukapuka&#x27;s isolation, few vessels visited before 1857 when the London Missionary Society landed teachers from Aitutaki and Rarotonga. Luka Manuae of Aitutaki later wrote an extended account of the first days of contact 5–8 December 1857: &quot;No te taeanga o te tuatua a te Atua ki Pukapuka&quot; (&quot;The arrival of the Word of God at Pukapuka&quot;, dated August 1869). Some lineages wanted to kill the newcomers in revenge for an incident that had happened a month earlier, but Vakaawi, chief of Yālongo lineage, protected them. In the following days, the island accepted Luka&#x27;s Christian message, largely because of an encounter when two dead people were apparently raised back to life.

In 1862 Rev. William Wyatt Gill found most of the people on the island converted to Christianity. A raid in 1863 by Peruvian slave traders took 145 men and women, of whom only two returned, Kolia and Pilato (Malowutia). The London Missionary Society barque &quot;John Williams&quot; was wrecked on the western side in May 1864. In 1868 the buccaneer Bully Hayes took about 40 people to go on a labour scheme, but none of them returned home.

Pukapuka was proclaimed a British protectorate in 1892 and was included in the Cook Islands boundaries under the control of New Zealand in 1901.

===World War II===

Three U.S. Navy fliers from the arrived on Pukapuka in February 1942. Harold Dixon, Gene Aldrich, and Tony Pastula survived 34 days on the open ocean in a tiny raft, beginning their odyssey with no food or water stores and very few tools. They were found by Teleuka Iotua huddled in a hut belonging to Lakulaku Tutala on Loto Village&#x27;s reserve, where he gave them coconuts to drink. He then went and got more help. Shortly after their arrival a cyclone struck the island and caused widespread damage. Their story was told in the book &quot;The Raft&quot; by Robert Trumbull, published by Henry Holt and Co. in 1942, and released as a motion picture &quot;Against the Sun&quot; in 2014.

===Post World War II===

Pukapuka was hit by Cyclone Percy in February 2005 — a Category Five cyclone that destroyed the taro gardens, brought down thousands of trees, and damaged three-quarters of the houses.

==Treaty==
From 1856 to 1980, the United States claimed sovereignty over the island under the Guano Islands Act. On 11 June 1980, in connection with establishing the maritime boundary between the Cook Islands and American Samoa, the United States signed the Cook Islands – United States Maritime Boundary Treaty acknowledging that Pukapuka was under Cook Islands&#x27; sovereignty.

==Economy==
Although the island has a well-maintained airstrip, flights from Rarotonga are very infrequent. The five-hour flight from Rarotonga via Air Rarotonga now operates when there is a Government charter once every six weeks or so. The island is closer to Samoa than to the rest of the Cook Islands and transport via Samoa is becoming a preferred option for Pukapukans visiting in organised groups (&quot;tele&quot; parties) from New Zealand and Australia.

==Culture==
Pukapuka has its own language and customs that are different from those of the rest of the Cook Islands.

The entire population is said to be descended from seventeen men, two women and an unknown number of children who survived a catastrophic storm and tsunami in the 17th century. A new estimate of the date of the calamity based on oral histories suggests that it happened about 1590. Following blackbirding raids, by 1870 the population of the atoll was reduced to 340 people.

The island had a population of 664 at the 2001 census, but since 2005 the population has declined to less than 500.

The American writer Robert Dean Frisbie settled on Pukapuka in 1924, married a native woman, and raised his family on the island. He wrote several books about his experiences on Pukapuka and surrounding islands. He said at the time he was looking for a place beyond the reach of &quot;the faintest echo from the noisy clamour of the civilised world&quot;. Frisbie’s daughter Johnny and her return to Pukapuka is featured in the 2021 documentary &quot;The Island in Me&quot;.

Pukapuka served as the namesake for the tribe of Asian-Americans in , the 13th season of the U.S. reality show in which initial tribes were divided by race.

<text>Zeulenroda-Triebes () is a German town in the district of Greiz in the state of Thuringia.

Zeulenroda-Triebes is situated in the south of Greiz in the mountains of the Thuringian Slate Mountains (Thüringer Schiefergebirge), on the border with Saxony. The population of Zeulenroda-Triebes in 2006 was about 18,000. The largest company is Bauerfeind AG. The most famous sight in the town is the neoclassical town hall, built in 1827. Zeulenroda-Triebes is also known for the International Thuringia Women&#x27;s Cycling Tour.

Zeulenroda unt Bf station lies on the Werdau–Mehltheuer railway.

==History==
Zeulenroda was mentioned in a document for a Saalburg convent as early as 1325, in Medieval Latin as &quot;Zulenrode&quot;. The village became a town in 1438. Zeulenroda belonged to the principality of the House of Reuss Elder Line for several centuries. On April 16, 1945 the United States Army took over Zeulenroda without a battle. On July 1 the Red Army occupied the town. In 1949 Zeulenroda and Triebes became a part of the German Democratic Republic. After German reunification in 1990, the Free State of Thuringia was reestablished. Zeulenroda merged with Triebes in 2006. The new name of the town is Zeulenroda-Triebes.


==Population development==
In 1908 the population of Zeulenroda reached the 10,000 mark. In 1946, the town had grown to more than 14,000 inhabitants through many resettlers. At the beginning of the 1990s more than 15,000 people lived in Zeulenroda. In recent years the number of inhabitants has declined slightly.

<text>Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland, KG KB (1578–1632) was an English nobleman. Despite a brief imprisonment for his involvement in the Essex Rebellion of 1601, he became prominent at the court of James I. He lived at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire. In 1618 three women, the &quot;Witches of Belvoir&quot;, were accused of witchcraft for having allegedly caused the deaths of his two young sons.

==Biography==

Francis Manners was the second son of John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland, and Elizabeth Charlton (died 1595), the daughter of Francis Charlton of Apley Castle, Shropshire.

In 1598, he went abroad, travelling through France, Germany, and Italy, probably in the company of the former school teacher Robert Dalllington and Inigo Jones. On his return to England he took part, along with his older brother Roger and their younger brother George, in the 1601 rebellion of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and was imprisoned in the Poultry Counter. He was fined a thousand marks and committed to the custody of his uncle Roger at Enfield. Sir Robert Cecil, however, obtained a remission of the fine, and thus the affair cost little either to him or his brother George. As soon. as he was free he wrote a penitent letter to his uncle Sir John Manners of Haddon. In November 1601, he became a member of the Inner Temple.

On 28 June 1603, Francis Manners travelled with his brother to Denmark to present the Order of the Garter to Christian IV, accompanied by &#x27;picture maker&#x27; Inigo Jones among others. He was prominent at the court of James I, and was created a Knight of the Bath on 4 January 1605 at the same time as Prince Charles. On 26 June 1612, he succeeded Roger as the 6th earl of Rutland, and was made lord-lieutenant of Lincolnshire on 15 July of that year. On 7 August he entertained James I at Belvoir, and the king repeated the visit five times in the after years. He held the offices of constable of Nottingham Castle and keeper of Sherwood Forest from October 1612 until April 1620, and carried the target or shield in the funeral procession of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales.
Manners was made a Knight of the Garter on 24 April 1616. On 6 April 1617 Manners became a member of the Privy Council and accompanied the king into Scotland the same year.

The title of Lord Ros or Roos had been carried by Elizabeth Cecil, 16th Baroness de Ros, a daughter of the third Earl of Rutland, into the Cecil family, but Rutland claimed it on the death of William Cecil, 17th Baron de Ros, in 1618. He was created warden and chief justice of the royal forests north of the Trent on 13 November 1619, and &quot;custos rotulorum&quot; for Northamptonshire on 7 February 1623. Although he seems to have disapproved of an extreme policy in church matters, his family connection with his son-in-law, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, secured him the appointment, on 21 April 1623, of admiral of the fleet to bring home Prince Charles from Spain. At the coronation of Charles he bore the rod with the dove.

Rutland died on 17 December 1632 at an inn in Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire, and was buried on 20 February 1633 in the parish church at Bottesford, Leicestershire. He was succeeded by his younger brother, George, who became the 7th Earl.

==Employing Shakespeare==
A discovery was made by W. H. Stevenson in 1905 among some records being kept in Belvoir Castle of an entry that indicates that in March 1613, the year that the Globe theatre would later burn down during a performance of Henry VIII, William Shakespeare and Richard Burbage, who was skilled as a portrait painter of his fellow actors, were each paid forty-four shillings in gold for creating and painting the Earl of Rutland&#x27;s emblem. This decorative emblem was to be used at a festive tournament later that month at Whitehall in London, which was to celebrate the accession of James I ten years earlier.

==Family==
Rutland married firstly, on 6 May 1602, Frances Knyvet (died before 26 November 1605), (third daughter and coheir of Sir Henry Knyvet of Charlton, Wiltshire and Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir James Stumpe of Bromham, Wiltshire), and widow of Sir William Bevill of Killigarth or Kilkhampton, Cornwall. They had a daughter, Katherine, who on 16 May 1620 married George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. After Buckingham&#x27;s death, Katherine married Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim.

Rutland married secondly, after 26 October 1608, Cecily, eldest daughter of Sir John Tufton of Hothfield, (and his second wife, Christian, daughter of Sir Humphrey Browne), and widow of Sir Edward Hungerford. They had two sons, Henry (died 1613) and Francis (died 5 March 1620), whose deaths in infancy were attributed to sorcery. The Flower family, known as the &quot;Witches of Belvoir&quot;, were said to have prevented the couple having more children by making a charm from wool from their mattress and a pair of gloves.

Witchcraft is mentioned in the inscription on the Earl of Rutland&#x27;s tomb in St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church, Bottesford: &quot;In 1608 he married ye lady Cecila Hungerford, daughter to ye Honorable Knight Sir John Tufton, by whom he had two sons, both of which died in their infancy by wicked practises and sorcerye&quot;.

<doc id="1096564" wikidata="Q5013605" url="?curid=1096564" title="CPA Australia">
<text>CPA Australia (&quot;Certified Practising Accountant&quot;) is a professional accounting body in Australia, originally founded as the &quot;Incorporated Institute of Accountants&quot; in 1886. As of 31 December 2020, it has 168,736 members in 150 countries and regions. CPA Australia currently has 19 staffed offices across Australia, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, New Zealand and the UK.

==History==
The current form of CPA Australia dates from 1952, when the Commonwealth Institute and Federal Institute merged to create the Australian Society of Accountants. In July 1990 the name changed to the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, and in April 2000, the name became CPA Australia.

The main predecessor bodies of the Society, with year of formation, were:
*Incorporated Institute of Accountants, 1886 
*Federal Institute of Accountants, 1894
*Association of Accountants of Australia, 1910
*Australasian Institute of Cost Accountants, 1920

===2017 CEO controversy===
The CEO of CPA Australia from 2009, Alex Malley, came under significant criticism in the media and from CPA members in 2017 for his A$1.8 million annual salary and for the significant amounts of CPA funds going towards promoting Malley and his personal interests, such as a paid television show and Malley&#x27;s autobiography. The scandal surrounding Malley, combined with broader member discontent over executive changes that made the board unaccountable and debts accrued from the establishment of a financial planning arm, led to the resignation of the CPA president Tyrone Carlin in May 2017, and then to two board members resigning a week later in June 2017. The resigning board members, Richard Alston and Kerry Ryan, cited the presence of &quot;board allies of chief executive Alex Malley&quot; refusing to &quot;allow a wide-ranging review of Mr Malley and the organisation&quot; as their main reason. The board resignations had also followed former Future Fund Chairman and Commonwealth Bank CEO, David Murray, who resigned his 40-year CPA membership in response to what he saw as poor management within CPA.

On 15 June, a further three directors resigned due to the expanding scandal surrounding Malley and the remaining board initiated an &quot;independent review&quot; of all claims made against CPA and its CEO, to be chaired by former chief of the Australian Defence Force, Sir Angus Houston. However, even the decision to create the review came under criticism when it was revealed that Houston had appeared as guest on Malley&#x27;s TV program and had written a glowing foreword in Malley&#x27;s book. Houston later resigned his post in favour of former Commonwealth Auditor-General, Ian McPhee.

Facing a significant swelling of discontent amongst CPA members, in June 2017 it was announced that the CPA board had terminated the contract of Malley, resulting in CPA paying out the remainder of his contract to the sum of A$4.9 million. On the developing scandal, &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; journalist Colin Kruger noted: &quot;Accountancy is meant to be the profession of sober financial clarity. [...] Not the sort of profession for flashy types, accountants are meant to be the score keepers, not the goal scorers. It makes the lack of accountability, and financial clarity, from the top accounting body in Australia – CPA Australia – all the more incongruous.&quot;

In August 2017, it was announced that the remaining board members would resign their positions at the end of the year, to make way for an entirely new board. The subsequent review report released in September 2017 found that the &quot;chief executive was overpaid, [CPA Australia] had lost touch with its members and provided questionable value for money for the services it rendered.&quot; In addition to CPA&#x27;s &quot;over-emphasis on marketing and brand building activities that centred on the former CEO&quot;, the review in particular noted the excessive CEO&#x27;s salary, with its many increases over several years not being justified by organisational growth. On 1 October 2017 an entirely new board took office, headed by Peter Wilson as president and chairman, and on 3 April 2018 a new CEO, Andrew Hunter, was appointed to take over from the interim CEO since Malley&#x27;s departure, Adam Awty. In January 2019, following the recommendations of the 2018 AGM, Malley and three previous directors (Penny Egan, former president Richard Petty, and Graeme Wade) were stripped of their Life Memberships by the Board for their involvement in the controversy.

In March 2024, CPA announced Chris Freeland as their new CEO.

==Membership==
Full members of CPA Australia use the designatory letters CPA, while senior members with at least 15 years&#x27; experience in finance, accounting or business, as well as leadership and/or management experience in those fields, may become Fellows and use the letters FCPA. The board may also confer life membership or honorary membership for &quot;eminent achievement and service&quot; to CPA Australia and/or the profession. In 2017, CPA Australia disclosed that the organisation had (as of 30 June 2017) 158,311 members, including 119,653 voting members. The membership at this time comprised 106,299 CPAs, 13,154 FCPAs, and 38,838 associate members.

<text>Harry Roe Hughes (November 13, 1926 – March 13, 2019) was an American politician from the Democratic Party who served as the 57th Governor of Maryland from 1979 to 1987.

==Early life and family==
Hughes was born in Easton, Maryland, the son of Helen (Roe) and Jonathan Longfellow Hughes. Hughes attended Caroline County, Maryland, public schools before attending the Mercersburg Academy in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania. After school, Hughes served in the U.S. Naval Air Corps during the Second World War.

After the War, Hughes continued his education by attending Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s University and the University of Maryland, from which he graduated in 1949. At Maryland he was a member of the Alpha Psi chapter of the Theta Chi social fraternity. He received his Juris Doctor degree from The George Washington University Law School in 1952 and was admitted to the Maryland Bar the same year. Hughes married his wife, Patricia Donoho Hughes, on June 30, 1951. They have two daughters, Ann and Elizabeth. Patricia Hughes died on January 20, 2010, in Denton at the age of 79.

Prior to his election as governor, Hughes was an attorney and one-time professional baseball player in the Eastern Shore League. From 1966 to 1970, Hughes was the chairman of Maryland Democratic State Central Committee.

==Political career==
Hughes began his political career as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1955 to 1959, representing Caroline County. He was elected a member of the Maryland Senate in 1958 and served until 1970 for district 15, representing Caroline, Cecil, Kent, Queen Anne&#x27;s, and Talbot counties. In 1971, Hughes was offered and accepted the position of Secretary of Transportation for the state.

In May 1977, however, Hughes resigned from his position because of a disagreement in the State Department of Transportation regarding the award of a construction contract for a subway in Baltimore.

Hughes was elected governor in 1978 after defeating Lieutenant Governor Blair Lee III in the Democratic primary election, and Republican John Glenn Beall, Jr. in the general election. Among other things, Hughes was a strong advocate for the Chesapeake Bay. He signed into law such legislation as that approving the Chesapeake Bay Agreement, which set into motion efforts to restore the Bay and recover from excessive fishing.

Also during his administration, Maryland initiated foreign trade with China. The Savings and Loan crisis, involving the failure of many savings and loan organizations across the United States, hit Maryland near the end of Hughes&#x27; tenure with the run at Old Court Savings and Loans, but nevertheless steps were taken to insure Maryland savings and loans organizations. Hughes served two terms, defeating Republican challenger Robert A. Pascal in 1982, and concluded his governorship in 1987.

In 1986, Hughes and Congressman Michael D. Barnes both unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Charles &quot;Mac&quot; Mathias. They lost to Barbara Mikulski, who went on to win the general election.

==Later career==

Hughes was a member of the Chesapeake Bay Trust from 1995 to 2003; a member of the Board of Regents of the University System of Maryland from 1996 to 2000; the chairman of the Blue Ribbon Citizens Pfiesteria Commission in 1997; the chairman of the Maryland Appellate Judicial Nominating Commission from 1999 to 2003; and a member of the committee to Establish the Maryland Survivors Scholarship Fund from 2001 to 2002. Hughes was a member of the Advisory Committee for the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy&#x27;s board of directors.

Hughes published an autobiography in 2006.

After a series of illnesses, including pneumonia, Hughes died under hospice care at his home in Denton on March 13, 2019, aged 92.

<text>Masalit (autonym &quot;Masala/Masara&quot;; ) is a Nilo-Saharan language of the Maban language group spoken by the Masalit people in Ouaddaï Region, Chad and West Darfur, Sudan.

Masalit, known as the &quot;Massalat&quot;, moved west into central-eastern Chad. Their ethnic population in Chad was as of the 1993 census, but only 10 speakers of their language were reported in 1991.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
*

=== Consonants ===
* It has been stated that occasional click sounds and may occur, however; they are considered to be rare.
* Sounds can occur as geminated .
* Sounds /t, m, n, ŋ/ can occur as palatalized [tʲ, mʲ, nʲ, ŋʲ] before front vowels.
* only occur as a result of words of Arabic origin.
* is not a phonemic sound, and is only heard before word-initial vowels.
* Sounds only occur in word-initial position.

==Sociolects==
The Masalit language has two sociolects:
*&quot;Heavy&quot; Masalit, spoken by higher-ranking people and those in the countryside, with a complicated agglutinative grammar
*&quot;Light&quot; Masalit, spoken particularly in the home and in the market, with a somewhat simplified grammatical structure and many borrowings from Sudanese Arabic, the regional lingua franca and language of education.

<text>This table explains the conjugation of auxiliary Catalan verbs.
==Notes==

# The past, also called preterite, is rarely used in the spoken and written language and the same applies for the past anterior in both indicative and subjunctive moods (because it has the past form of &quot;haver&quot; in the composite form). In the modern language, the periphrastic past and the periphrastic past anterior replace the past and the past anterior. The main auxiliary verb is &quot;anar&quot;, but one must pay attention that it is conjugated in a slightly different way than the actual &quot;anar&quot; (a non-auxiliary verb expressing the meaning &#x27;to go&#x27;). e.g. &quot;(Jo) vaig anar&quot; = I went.
# The participle must agree with the noun in grammatical gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural).
# &quot;Haver&quot; is never used in the imperative and all of the composite tenses.
# The personal pronouns are omitted in the spoken and written language, except only where to clear up the ambiguity and that is usually when the conjugated verbs look similar (ex.: the conjugated first and third person singulars in the imperfect). The pronouns may also be used to empathize the verbs. In this list, the pronouns only serve as a guide for each grammatical person.

<doc id="1096600" wikidata="Q2048265" url="?curid=1096600" title="Palmerston Island">
<text>Palmerston Island is a coral atoll in the Cook Islands in the Pacific Ocean about northwest of Rarotonga. James Cook landed there on 16 June 1774.

==Overview==
Palmerston Island is one of a number of sandy islets on a continuous ring of coral reef enclosing a lagoon. The only inhabited islet is Home. The total land area of the islets is approximately . The coral reef covers about . The lagoon is some across, covering an area of . There are several small passages through the reef for boats, though there is no safe entry for large ships. At a latitude of 18 degrees south, Palmerston enjoys a tropical climate but is exposed to severe tropical cyclones. A particularly destructive series of storms occurred during the 1920s and 1930s. The atoll rim consists of a series of motu or islets. Clockwise from Home, these include:
* Home
* North Island
* Tara i tokerau
* Marions bank
* Motu Ngangie
* Lee To Us
* Leicester
* Small Cooks
* Karakerake
* Primrose
* Toms
* Cooks

All the islets are wooded with coconut palms, pandanus, and native trees. There is some natural ground water on Palmerston but water captured from rainfall is preferred for drinking. Shellfish inhabit the reef, and fish are abundant although there are concerns about overfishing. 35 people live in Palmerston, all but three descended from 19th century English sailor William Marsters.

The economy is based on fishing and though Palmerston&#x27;s extreme remoteness makes a cash market difficult to maintain; in fact it is more like the subsistence ways of life in the northern atolls. Electricity and other modern utilities are available. Communication to the outside world is provided by Vodafone Cook Islands, including landline, internet and cellular phone service. The island has no airport or air service, but cargo ships visit a few times a year.

==History==
Palmerston was recorded by Captain Cook in 1774, but he did not land on the island until 13 April 1777. He found it uninhabited, though some ancient graves were discovered. Cook named the island after Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston, then one of the Lords Commissioner of the Admiralty. The ancient name of the island was supposedly &quot;Avarau&quot;, meaning &quot;two hundred harbour entrances&quot;. In 1863 William Marsters, a ship&#x27;s carpenter and barrel maker, arrived on Palmerston from Manuae with two Polynesian wives. He added a third wife and sired a large family of some 23 children, whose descendants now inhabit Palmerston. Thus, Palmerston Island is the only island in the Cook Islands for which English is the native language.

Palmerston was annexed by the British Empire on 23 May 1891 and in 1892, the British Government granted William a 21-year lease which was extended until 1954. Palmerston came under New Zealand administration in 1901.

William Marsters, originally thought to have come from Leicestershire, England, is now believed to have come from Gloucestershire, which might explain why his descendants now spell the name &quot;Marsters&quot; due to the Gloucestershire accent. By the time his youngest daughter Titana Tangi died in 1973, there were over a thousand of Marsters&#x27; descendants living in Rarotonga and New Zealand.

Though only some 24 family members remain on Palmerston, all of Marsters&#x27; descendants consider the island their ancestral home. In 1954 the family was granted full ownership of the island. Three branches of the family remain on Palmerston, each branch being descended from one of William&#x27;s three wives, marriage within a family group being prohibited. All of William&#x27;s wives came from Tongareva and there are still many family links and common ancestors between these atolls.

==Governance==
Palmerston is administered by the Cook Islands government, through the Palmerston Island Administration (PIA), in association with New Zealand.

The Island&#x27;s Council consists of six members, the three heads of each family and three other members appointed by each family. The Mayor is Bill Marsters.

==Ecology==
In December 2024 the atoll was declared rat free following an eradication campaign in 2023.

<doc id="1096604" wikidata="Q714173" url="?curid=1096604" title="Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa">
<text>Jorge Nuno de Lima Pinto da Costa (28 December 1937 – 15 February 2025) () was a Portuguese sports executive, who was president of Portuguese sports club Porto from 1982 until 2024. He was the president with most titles won (69) in the history of football and most days in charge in world as a president of football. 

Pinto da Costa was involved in the Portuguese football corruption scandal &quot;Apito Dourado&quot;, from which he was eventually absolved in April 2009 after receiving a two-year suspension and a €10,000 fine in May 2008.

==Early years==
Pinto da Costa was born in Cedofeita, the son of José Alexandrino Teixeira da Costa and Maria Elisa Bessa Lima de Amorim Pinto, who fathered other four children, including future forensic pathologist José Eduardo.

In his late teens, Pinto da Costa started working as a bank teller. He began collaborating with Porto, while keeping his day job; in 1953, on his 16th birthday, his maternal grandmother registered him as a club associate and he was a frequent attender of the team&#x27;s football and roller hockey games, eventually going on to work in directorial capacities in the latter department, in his early 20s.

==Directorial beginnings==
Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa&#x27;s career at Porto started when he was just 20 years old, after accepting the club&#x27;s invitation to join the rink hockey administrative commission. In 1962, he became chief of the rink hockey department, a job he would eventually accumulate after also taking over as chief of the boxing department in 1967. In 1969, he integrated Afonso Pinto de Magalhães&#x27;s Chairman candidacy list as Head of all Amateur Departments. Their list won the elections and he held the job for the three following years. Despite being invited by future president Américo de Sá to join his then candidacy list, he refused the offer as he felt the candidate should bring forward a renewed list. He left the club in 1971 after Pinto de Magalhães&#x27;s mandate was over.

==Return==
In 1976, Porto&#x27;s most popular department, association football, was facing the longest title drought in the club&#x27;s history, having not won the Primeira Liga for 19 years. This period coincided with the rise of neighbors Boavista, who under the guidance of Pinto da Costa&#x27;s friend and Porto&#x27;s former player and coach, José Maria Pedroto, would win later that season the Taça de Portugal.

On the same night, Porto&#x27;s transfer target Brazilian player Amarildo, fled to city rivals Boavista at the last-minute; Pinto da Costa was provoked by friends, some of whom were directors of Boavista, with allegations that Boavista had surpassed Porto as the city&#x27;s major sporting force. He considered this an outrage and vowed on that night to return to his beloved club. Soon after, he contacted then Porto&#x27;s chairman Américo de Sá and both arranged his return through the formers re-election list, this time as director of football. Before the elections, he agreed terms with José Maria Pedroto, who was still coaching Boavista at the time. In May 1976, chairman Américo de Sá was re-elected and Pinto da Costa returned to the club as director of football, alongside Pedroto as a coach.

==Rise and first victories==
It was under Pinto da Costa&#x27;s and José Maria Pedroto&#x27;s guidance that, in 1976–77, Porto won the Taça de Portugal, their first silverware in 18 years. During the following season, their success continued when they finally broke their 19-year-old title drought and won the 1977–78 league. The 1978–79 season would mark a league title for both men. Subsequently, though, in 1980 after failing a third title in a row, internal disputes regarding other sporting departments having too much influence in Porto football section led to their resignation. Following their resignation 15 first team players refused to play for the club. This specific period of time is dubbed as &quot;Verão Quente&quot; (Hot summer).

==Pinto da Costa and Pedroto, Chairman and Manager==
On 17 April 1982, following internal disputes in Porto, Pinto da Costa was elected the 31st Chairman of the club and took office on 23 April. He chose Pedroto as the association football manager and this partnership was to have a lasting effect on Porto&#x27;s whole structure. Pedroto was a visionary, a highly talented football player whose charisma as coach was unique. Under Pedroto, in 1984, Porto reached its first European final. Porto lost 2–1 to Juventus in Basel, in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final. By then, Pedroto was already ill, having been diagnosed with cancer. He would resign his duties and died shortly afterwards, in 1985.

===European Champions===
Artur Jorge was appointed Pedroto&#x27;s replacement, and European recognition would finally come under his spell. In 1987, Porto faced Bayern Munich for the European Cup final. At half-time, Bayern took a 1–0 lead. But the rookie Portuguese side would come back to claim a historic victory. Algerian Rabah Madjer scored with his heel to draw the match, and Juary later sealed the 2–1 win that ensured Porto the biggest feat of its near centenary history.

==Years of domestic success – association football==
Domestic success continued to be a hallmark of Porto in subsequent years, and 1995–99 became the highest note of Portuguese domestic competition ever, following titles by Bobby Robson (1995 and 1996) and António Oliveira (1997 and 1998); Fernando Santos captured a record-setting fifth consecutive title in 1999.

Porto later achieved second place in the championship, but won the 2000 and 2001 Portuguese Cups (whilst reaching the European quarter-finals in both seasons), only to replace Fernando Santos with Octávio Machado. Octávio however only had a short stint at Porto. His replacement would be José Mourinho.

===1999 Sweep===
In the end of the 1998–99 season, Porto swept the Portuguese professional sports by winning all the competitions in which it had a professional team: football, handball, basketball and rink hockey. It also won the swimming national championship, which made a total of five championship titles in the same year. In Portugal, it was called the &quot;double penta&quot;, making reference to the five consecutive championships in football.

==José Mourinho era==
Mourinho joined Porto in January 2002, the club was in fifth place on the table. Mourinho would ensure a UEFA Cup berth for the following season, ending the league in third. The summer of 2002 saw a lot of movement on the transfer market by Porto. The bets consisted mainly on Portuguese players playing in Portugal, yet to prove their true worth, as well as, for the most part, little known foreigners. It most certainly worked, and such was Mourinho&#x27;s impressive work in Porto, that he managed to lead the club to two glorious seasons in 2003 and 2004, wrapping up consecutive Portuguese titles and a UEFA Cup and Champions League in quick succession. During this period, Pinto da Costa remained somewhat in Mourinho&#x27;s shadow and allowed him a very firm grip on all matters regarding football.

==Post-Mourinho era==
Victory in the Champions League final in 2004 meant that Mourinho left Porto, looking for another challenge in a bigger league. He was replaced by Luigi Delneri, who only lasted four weeks on the job. In came Victor Fernandez, who qualified the club for the Champions League last 16 and won the Intercontinental Cup. He was sacked in late January 2005 following a home defeat to Braga, which saw the club lose the championship lead. José Couceiro took over and led the club to a final standing of second in the league. He subsequently resigned his post.

In late May 2005, Co Adriaanse, the former coach of Willem II, Ajax and AZ Alkmaar, was appointed the new Porto coach.

Under his guidance, Porto became an attacking team and the results were mixed, solid performances mixed with severe defensive flaws. European results, in particular, were terrible, and Porto suffered a humiliating exit from the UEFA Champions League in the group stage.

However, Adriaanse still guided Porto to a domestic double, wrapping up the title with two games to spare, and beating Vitória de Setúbal in the Cup final.

Adriaanse resigned before the start of the 2006–07 season, due to internal disputes with the club&#x27;s board, and was subsequently replaced by former Benfica and Braga manager Jesualdo Ferreira, who had only just joined arch-rivals Boavista that season, and left without managing a single competitive match for Boavista. With him, Porto won the league three consecutive times in 2006–07, 2007–08 and 2008–09.

In the 2010–11 season, with André Villas-Boas, Porto won the Portuguese SuperCup, the Portuguese title, the UEFA Europa League and the Portuguese Cup.

From 2013 to 2017, he failed to conquer any silverware, contributing to the biggest hiatus during his presidency.

==&quot;Apito Dourado&quot; affair==

Pinto da Costa was one of the people investigated by the police as part of the &quot;Apito Dourado&quot; (Golden Whistle) sports corruption scandal in Portuguese football. The investigation caused him to flee to Spain with his then partner Carolina Salgado in order to avoid detention in 2004. He was formally accused of corruption on 12 June 2007, along with Reinaldo Teles, another member of Porto&#x27;s administration.

Following the inquiry, Pinto da Costa vowed to appeal the two-year ban placed on him by the LPFP&#x27;s Discipline Committee in order to clear both his and the club&#x27;s names. In a short interview, he stated: &quot;We will not appeal the points deductions and we will still have a 14 or 15-point lead. But Porto&#x27;s honour will be salvaged because I, personally, as president and a citizen, will appeal on Monday to the Justice Council. After this appeal, we will wait to see the truth come out and it will allow us to show there is no reason for Porto to have been penalised.&quot;

In early April 2009, Pinto da Costa was declared innocent in all allegations relating to bribery or any case dealing with &quot;Apito Dourado&quot;.

Later, on 21 January 2010, the Portuguese newspaper &quot;Correio da Manhã&quot; revealed that many of the wiretapped phone calls in the Apito Dourado scandal were made public on YouTube.

In May 2011, the decision made by the LPFP&#x27;s Discipline Committee that initially punished Porto (six points were deducted) and Pinto da Costa (suspended for two years) was declared void and was thus annulled by the Administrative Court of Lisbon. Porto recovered those points in July 2017.

== Illness and death ==
Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa was diagnosed with prostate cancer in September 2021. He died from the illness on 15 February 2025, at the age of 87.

<text>Feminist legal theory, also known as feminist jurisprudence, is based on the belief that the law has been fundamental in women&#x27;s historical subordination. Feminist jurisprudence the philosophy of law is based on the political, economic, and social inequality of the sexes and feminist legal theory is the encompassment of law and theory connected. The project of feminist legal theory is twofold. First, feminist jurisprudence seeks to explain ways in which the law played a role in women&#x27;s subordinate status. Feminist legal theory was directly created to recognize and combat the legal system built primarily by the and for male intentions, often forgetting important components and experiences women and marginalized communities face. The law perpetuates a male valued system at the expense of female values. Through making sure all people have access to participate in legal systems as professionals to combating cases in constitutional and discriminatory law, feminist legal theory is utilized for it all.

Second, feminist legal theory is dedicated to changing women&#x27;s status through a rework of the law and its approach to gender. It is a critique of American law that was created to change the way women were treated and how judges had applied the law to keep women in the same position they had been in for years. The women who worked in this area viewed the law as holding women in a lower place in society than men based on gender assumptions, and judges have therefore relied on these assumptions to make their decisions. This movement originated in the 1960s and 1970s to achieve equality for women by challenging laws that made distinctions based on sex. One example of this sex-based discrimination during these times was the struggles for equal admission and access to their desired education. The women&#x27;s experiences and persistence to fight for equal access led to low rates of retention and mental health issues, including anxiety disorders. Through their experiences, they were influenced to create new legal theory that fought for their rights and those that came after them in education and broader marginalized communities which led to the creation of the legal scholarship feminist legal theory in the 1970s and 1980s. It was crucial to allowing women to become their own people through becoming financially independent and having the ability to find real jobs that were not available to them before due to discrimination in employment. The foundation of feminist legal theory reflects these second and third-wave feminist struggles. However, feminist legal theorists today extend their work beyond overt discrimination by employing a variety of approaches to understand and address how the law contributes to gender inequality.

==History==
The first known use of the term &quot;feminist jurisprudence&quot; was in the late 1970s by Ann Scales during the planning process for Celebration 25, a party and conference held in 1978 to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first women graduating from Harvard Law School. The term was first published in 1978 in the first issue of the Harvard Women&#x27;s Law Journal. This feminist critique of American law was developed as a reaction to the fact that the legal system was too gender-prioritized and patriarchal.

In 1984 Martha Fineman founded the Feminism and Legal Theory Project at the University of Wisconsin Law School to explore the relationships between feminist theory, practice, and law, which has been instrumental in the development of feminist legal theory.

The foundation of the feminist legal theory was laid by women who challenged the laws that were in place to keep women in their respective places in the home. A driving force of this new movement was the need for women to start becoming financially independent.

Women who were working in law started to focus on this idea more and started to work on achieving reproductive freedom, stopping gender discrimination in the law and workforce, and stopping the allowance of sexual abuse.

== Main approaches ==
Some approaches to feminist jurisprudence are: 
*the liberal equality model;
*the sexual difference model;
*the dominance model;
*the anti-essentialist model;
*and the postmodern model.

Each model provides a distinct view of the legal mechanisms that contribute to women&#x27;s subordination, and each offers a distinct method for changing legal approaches to gender.

=== The liberal equality model ===

The liberal equality model operates from within the liberal legal paradigm and generally embraces liberal values and the rights-based approach to law, though it takes issue with how the liberal framework has operated in practice. This model focuses on ensuring that women are afforded genuine equality including race, sexual orientation, and gender—as opposed to the nominal equality often given them in the traditional liberal framework—and seeks to achieve this either by way of a more thorough application of liberal values to women&#x27;s experiences or the revision of liberal categories to take gender into account. The liberal equality model applies Kimberlé Crenshaw&#x27;s theoretical framework of intersectionality in relation to a person&#x27;s lived experience. For example, when black women are only provided legal relief when the case is against their race or gender.

=== The sexual difference model ===
The difference model emphasizes the significance of gender discrimination and holds that this discrimination should not be obscured by the law, but should be taken into account by it. Only by taking into account differences can the law provide adequate remedies for women&#x27;s situation, which is in fact distinct from men&#x27;s. The difference model suggests that differences between women and men put one sex at a disadvantage; therefore, the law should compensate women and men for their differences and disadvantages. These differences between women and men may be biological or culturally constructed. The difference model is in direct opposition to the sameness account which holds that women&#x27;s sameness with men should be emphasized. To the sameness feminist, employing women&#x27;s differences in an attempt to garner greater rights is ineffectual to that end and places emphasis on the very characteristics of women that have historically precluded them from achieving equality with men.

The sameness feminist also argued that there was already special treatment for these so-called &quot;differences&quot; in the law, which is what was oppressing women. The idea of there being differences between the sexes led to the classical thought that feminist legal theory was trying to get rid of. It forced women to prove that they were like men by comparing their experiences to those of men, all in an attempt to gain legal protection. This all only led to women trying to meet norms that were made by men without questioning why these were accepted as the norm for equality.

Men and women cannot be seen or defined as equal because they have completely different lived experiences. Understanding that access must be equal, but difference must still be recognized to diffract fairness and power struggle including unpaid societal standards like caring for children and the home, rather than feminine characteristics.

=== The dominance model ===
The dominance model rejects liberal feminism and views the legal system as a mechanism for the perpetuation of male dominance. By recognizing the foundation of law, scholars are able to conceptualize how women and marginalized communities were not written into the foundation of many structures limiting access and equal rights in all areas of life. Further, dominance theorists reject the difference model because it uses men as the benchmark of equality. While the liberal equality model and difference theory aim to achieve equality for women and men, the dominance model&#x27;s end goal is to liberate women from men. Dominance theorists understand gender inequality as a result of an imbalance of power between women and men and believe the law contributes to this subordination of women. It thus joins certain strands of critical legal theory, which also consider the potential for law to act as an instrument for . This theory focuses on how male dominate females, but it also talks about other groups being oppressed such as how legal aid is not often offered to the transgender population. Also, any white female would have good legal representation compared to minority groups.

In the account of dominance proposed by Catharine MacKinnon, sexuality is central to dominance. MacKinnon argues that women&#x27;s sexuality is socially constructed by male dominance and the sexual domination of women by men is a primary source of the general social subordination of women. According to MacKinnon, the legal system perpetuates inequalities between women and men by creating laws about women using a male perspective.

Additionally, MacKinnon further applies her dominance model of feminist legal theory to transgender sex equality. She criticizes the libertarian Textual and Literal Approach for exacerbating, rather than eliminating, the discrimination faced by lesbians, gay men, and transgender men and women. MacKinnon argues that the liberal Anti-Stereotyping Approach benefits only those who do not conform to stereotypes and yet meet the dominant standards while offering no help to those who face discrimination based on subordinated stereotypes. She asserts that only by adopting the Substantive Approach, inspired by her dominance model and focusing on the gender hierarchy driven by sexualized misogyny, can intersectionality be properly addressed, ultimately benefiting all women.

=== The anti-essentialist model ===
Anti-essentialist feminist legal theory was created by women of color and lesbians in the 1980s who felt feminist legal theory was excluding their perspectives and experiences. Anti-essentialist and intersectionalist critiques of feminists have objected to the idea that there can be any universal women&#x27;s voice and have criticized feminists, as did Black feminism, for implicitly basing their work on the experiences of white, middle class, heterosexual women. The anti-essentialist and intersectionalist project has been to explore the ways in which race, class, sexual orientation, and other axes of subordination interplay with gender and to uncover the implicit, detrimental assumptions that have often been employed in feminist theory. This model challenges feminist legal theorists who only address how the law affects heterosexual, middle-class white women. Anti-essentialist feminist legal theory recognizes that the identities of individual women shape their experiences, so the law does not influence all women in the same ways. It is about building actual equality for all regardless or gender, race, sexual orientation, class, or disability.

When feminist legal theory practices under an essentialist lens, women of color are often dismissed as they would in historical legal theory. While race is an important factor in feminist legal theory, it can also be misconstrued in a way that silences women of color, furthering racism in a system created to build more access. For this reason, Crenshaw&#x27;s &quot;Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color&quot; should remain a canonical to this topic to continue to support and challenge the gender essentialism within feminism culture and ideology the marginalized women of color by protection them further in legal implications through support. Kimberlé Crenshaw&#x27;s formation of intersectionality within feminist legal theory has given more women and people living multifaceted lives more representation in an arguable essentialist legal arena.

Mari Matsuda created the term &quot;multiple consciousness&quot; to explain a person&#x27;s ability to take on the perspective of an oppressed group. Anti-essentialist feminist legal theorists use multiple consciousness to understand how the law is affecting women belonging to groups other than their own. Feminist legal theory is still evolving to diminish gender and race essentialism to recognize how oppression and privilege work together to create a person&#x27;s life experiences.

=== The postmodern model ===
Postmodern feminist legal theorists reject the liberal equality idea that women are like men as well as the difference theory idea that women are inherently different from men. This is because they do not believe in singular truths and instead see truths as multiple and based on experience and perspective. Feminists from the postmodern camp use a method known as deconstruction in which they look at laws to find hidden biases within them. Postmodern feminists use deconstruction to demonstrate that laws should not be unchangeable since they are created by people with biases and may therefore contribute to female oppression.

== Hedonic Jurisprudence ==
Feminist legal theory produced a new idea of using hedonic jurisprudence to show that women&#x27;s experiences of assault and rape was a product of laws that treated them as less human and gave them fewer rights than men. With this feminist legal theorists argued that given examples were not only a description of possible scenarios but also a sign of events that have actually occurred, relying on them to support statements that the law ignores the interests and disrespects the existence of women.

== Influence on judicial decisions ==
Over half of cases involving feminist issues in the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom included elements of feminist jurisprudence in their judgements. The most common form of feminist legal reasoning was placing the case within a wider context of the experience of those involved or another wider context, which could involve showing empathy for women involved in cases. Judges also considered the impact of judgments on disadvantaged groups, challenged gendered bias, and commented on historic injustice. Some feminist facts entered into the courts reasoning as common knowledge with feminist scholars being referred to. Lady Hale has used Intersectional arguments,arguments that extend the concept of violence in cases that domestic violence outside of physical violence.

<text>The  (; NOS or rarely ; ) is one of the broadcasting organisations making up the Dutch public broadcasting system. It has a special statutory obligation to make news and sports programmes for the three Dutch public television channels and the Dutch public radio services. It is funded by the Dutch government.

The foundation&#x27;s remit derives from the Dutch Media Act 2008, which stipulates that the NOS produce regular and frequent programming of a public service nature, including, notably, a full and impartial news service and coverage of parliamentary procedures and debates, as well as reporting on sporting and other national events. The NOS also acts as a technical coordinator for the Dutch public broadcasting system as a whole. In the event of emergencies and/or the breaking of a major news story, it can assume control of the public networks to provide coordinated coverage of events in cooperation with the other members of the systems.

The NOS has correspondents in multiple countries, including a permanent studio in Washington, D.C. Programmes produced by the NOS include its daily television and radio bulletins, the . Parliamentary reports are shown from a special studio in The Hague. It also supplies news programmes aimed at children (&quot;Jeugdjournaal&quot;), teens and young adults (&quot;NOS op 3&quot;) and sports fans (&quot;NOS Langs de Lijn&quot;, &quot;NOS Studio Sport&quot;). Programmes are made available via television, radio, and online. The NOS also broadcast text pages and a website, which are both often used by the public.

== History ==

===1947–1969: Unions and foundations===
The Nederlandse Radio Unie (Netherlands Radio Union; NRU) was established in 1947. After several failed attempts to create a public broadcasting system and link up with a national station, the NRU was created as a union of broadcasting associations that provided operational support. The associations were responsible for their output, but studios, orchestras, and outside broadcast facilities were managed by the NRU. Weekly radio plays were also the domain of the NRU and would run until 1986. The NRU became the Dutch founding member of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950.

Meanwhile, the Nederlandse Televisie Stichting (Netherlands Television Service; NTS) was created in 1951, two years after public television returned to the airwaves. The NTS served as a similar organization to the NRU, in that broadcast and transmission facilities were supplied to member associations for making programmes.

It was not until 1956 that the NTS itself produced its first programme, a news bulletin called the &quot;NTS Journaal&quot;. This was followed by a sports round-up, &quot;Sport in Beeld&quot; (Sports Illustrated) in 1959, and 1967 &quot;Langs de Lijn&quot; (Along the Line), a joint production of several broadcasting associations. On 15 October 1967, Willem Leonard Oltmans interviewed the de Mohrenschildts for the NTS, which resulted in a 40-minute film that was the only full-length filmed interview of George de Mohrenschildt. However, the film, which was kept at Hilversum, disappeared in 1975.

===1969–1995: The birth of the NOS===

A new Media Act was passed into law in 1967, merging the NRU and the NTS. The new organization, the Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (Netherlands Broadcasting Service; NOS) was created on 29 May 1969. The NOS, as were its predecessors, was tasked with coordinating the whole public broadcasting system, as well as providing news and sports bulletins. It also inherited the technical and production facilities needed to make and broadcast radio and television programmes. All broadcasting members of the NRU and the NTS were made members of the NOS.

On 2 May 1977, a strike by sound engineers affected television news broadcasts. Upset viewers called on all broadcasters to resolve the situation.

On 1 April 1980, the NOS launched its teletext service, in the framework of supplying news and information. It first experimented with Teletext in 1977. In 1981, on the 25th anniversary, the NOS aired its first televised youth news bulletin, called &quot;Jeugdjournaal&quot;.

The Media Act of 1988 facilitated several changes to NOS and the broadcasting system. The Services Department, which was made up of the technical, broadcast, and transmission facilities of the NOS, was privatised, which meant the broadcasting associations were required to pay to use the facilities. The Nederlands Omroepproduktie Bedrijf (Netherlands Broadcast Production Company; NOB) consisted of those facilities, mainly based in Media Park in Hilversum. The Media Act also required broadcasting association members to take up positions on the NOS Board of Directors. A new government commission oversaw content and financial matters, as well as admitting potential new broadcasting associations.

===1995–2005: The split of the NOS===

In 1995, another Media Act was enacted, which saw the NOS&#x27;s broadcasting duties greatly reduced, with the creation of the Nederlandse Programma Stichting (Netherlands Programming Service; NPS). The NPS took on the NOS&#x27;s programming tasks concerning culture, art, children, education, and ethnic minorities, while the NOS concentrated on news, sports, and live events.

A new Supervisory Board replaced the Board of Directors in 1998. The previous management was replaced with a three-man board, now charged with developing strategies and responsibility for all public output. Programming co-ordinators were appointed for each television and radio network and channel identities were created, largely replacing the varying on-air presentation of the pillar broadcasters. The broadcasting associations also have a degree of input through the Supervisory Board.

In 2002, the coordination element of the public broadcast system, administered by the NOS was now made clearer with the creation of an umbrella organization, Publieke Omroep (Public Broadcasting), while programme makers operated under the name &quot;RTV NOS&quot;. The reorganization caused NOS to be loosened from the public broadcasting system, causing it to be a neutral member of NPO and start reorganizing itself.

===2005–present: A new look ===
On 17 December 2005, the organization obtained a new corporate identity. The previous NOS logo was in use for 36 years and featured the company&#x27;s initials in lowercase, with round and obtuse angles. The O of the logo is painted red and represents &quot;the hub of 360-degree reportage&quot;. The new logo was designed by graphic designers Lambie-Nairn, complete with new idents for its television programmes. The typeface was Gotham.

Its news-gathering operations also changed, with the news departments for radio, television, and internet merging and re-organizing into different sections (NOS, NOS News, NOS Sports, with NOS Events added in 2009).

An announcement made by the Minister of Education in 2007 confirmed a further division of the NOS. The umbrella group &quot;Publieke Omroep&quot;, managed by the NOS was to be legally separated and renamed Nederlandse Publieke Omroep &quot;(Netherlands Public Broadcasting)&quot;. The move was to ensure the NOS operated under the same conditions as its fellow broadcasting associations, as well as transferring membership of the European Broadcasting Union.

In 2009, the NOS became fully independent and now has its own Board of Directors.

Since 2012, the NOS has got a new style and layout and, for some programs, other titles. The biggest change is visible in the 8 o&#x27;clock NOS Journaal (traditionally the most viewed and therefore the most important news broadcast of the NOS), where they adopted a standing presentation.

==Programming==

===Television===
The NOS is responsible for news, sports, political, and events programming on public service television networks and produces the following:
* – one of the most important news programmes in the Netherlands, broadcast on all public stations whenever possible. The flagship edition is the 8 pm bulletin on NPO 1, often called &quot;achtuurjournaal&quot;, supplemented by two shorter editions at 6pm &amp; midnight and hourly bulletins throughout the day.
* &quot;NOS Jeugdjournaal&quot; – A news programme aimed at 8–12-year-olds, aired on children&#x27;s channel NPO Zapp. It is broadcast at 7pm and lasts 20 minutes, and a short bulletin is broadcast every weekday at 8:45 am when primary school starts.
* &quot;NOS Studio Sport&quot; – A sports programme covering the most popular sports. It has the right to broadcast major sports tournaments, like the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro. The NOS no longer has the right to broadcast full matches of the Eredivisie, but &quot;Studio Sport Eredivisie&quot; still provides summaries of matches played. The programme also covers matches and competitions in other sports, most notably tennis, ice skating, cycling, and field hockey. The editorial staff is also responsible for the &quot;NOS Sportjournaal&quot;, a news programme about sport, and &quot;NOS Studio Voetbal&quot;, a football talkshow on Sunday evening about the Eredivisie, the Netherlands national team and other news in football.
* &quot;NOS Journaal op 3&quot; – a 60-second news bulletin aimed at teenagers and young adults, aired on NPO 3, since 2011 called NOS op 3.
* &quot;NOS Den Haag Vandaag&quot; – a daily roundup of events from parliamentary sessions and political reports, produced in cooperation with the NOS, NTR and BNNVARA.
* NOS Events – The NOS is also responsible for broadcasting live special events, such as breaking news, weddings of the Dutch royal family, and the Dutch elections. (This department was called NOS Actueel, but that name is defunct since on 1 January 2006 NOS RTV changed its corporate identity)
* &quot;Nieuwsuur&quot; (Newshour) – Co-produced with the NTR, the NOS provides news and political affairs coverage for NPO 2&#x27;s nightly hour-long news magazine programme.

==== Themed channels ====
Besides broadcasting on the main three public television channels, The NOS is also responsible for &quot;NPO Politiek en Nieuws&quot;, a television channel that was a result of the merger of &quot;NPO Nieuws&quot; and &quot;NPO Politiek&quot; in 2021, that airs news programs, including the latest NOS Journaal as well as covering live events, parliamentary sessions, debate and archive material of parliamentary sessions. When parliament was not in session, &quot;NPO Sport&quot; took its place where it featured live sports coverage or news and current affairs being programmed which were also supplied by the NOS.

<doc id="1096619" wikidata="Q1154459" url="?curid=1096619" title="Media Transfer Protocol">
<text>The Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is an extension to the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) communications protocol that allows media files to be transferred automatically to and from portable devices. Whereas PTP was designed for downloading photographs from digital cameras, Media Transfer Protocol allows the transfer of music files on digital audio players and media files on portable media players, as well as personal information on personal digital assistants. MTP is a key part of WMDRM10-PD, a digital rights management (DRM) service for the Windows Media platform. In 2011, it became the standard method to transfer files to and from Android.

MTP is part of the &quot;Windows Media&quot; framework and thus closely related to Windows Media Player. Versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system from Windows XP SP2 support MTP. Windows XP requires Windows Media Player 10 or higher; later Windows versions have built-in support. Microsoft has made an MTP Porting Kit available for older versions of Windows, back to Windows 98.

The USB Implementers Forum device working group standardized MTP as a full-fledged Universal Serial Bus (USB) device class in May 2008. Since then, MTP is an official extension to PTP and shares the same class code.

==Overview==
MTP is a high level file transfer protocol, as opposed to a general storage protocol like USB mass storage. That means that the MTP client (computer) does not see an array of byte blocks that makes up a data structure that makes up a file system, but instead speaks in terms of files and folders to the MTP device. This lets the MTP device take part in the high level operations (such as updating its metadata indexes) while keeping the integrity of its file system in its own hands. In particular, dropped transfers (such as by unplugging the USB cable too soon) do not corrupt the device file system. The non-generality of MTP has consequences for how a computer operating system can present the MTP device, both to other programs and to the user.

According to its specification, the main purpose of MTP is to facilitate communication between media devices with transient connection.
A secondary purpose being to enable command and control of the connected device. A battery-powered mobile device can report its battery charge level through MTP.

The protocol was originally implemented for use across USB but extended for use across TCP/IP and Bluetooth. Windows Vista supports MTP over TCP/IP. Windows 7 and Windows Vista with the Platform Update for Windows Vista also support MTP over Bluetooth. The host connecting to an MTP device is called an &quot;MTP Initiator&quot;, whereas the device itself is an &quot;MTP Responder&quot;.

MTP allows &quot;MTP Initiators&quot; to identify the specific capabilities of device(s) with respect to file formats and functionality. In particular, MTP Initiators may have to provide passwords and other information to unlock files, or otherwise enable digital rights management. Nothing specific of this nature is in the core standard, but the features are available via vendor extensions. MTPZ, the Zune Extension to MTP, specifically denies access to files until authentication has been processed, which is only possible using Windows Media Player 10 or higher.

==Comparison with USB Mass Storage==


MTP&#x27;s advantages are marked with &quot;(+)&quot; while disadvantages are marked with &quot;(-)&quot;.

===File oriented instead of block oriented protocol===
By not exposing the filesystem and metadata index, the integrity of these is in full control of the device.
*(+) No risk of file system corruption if unplugging the device while writing. File transfers are atomic, meaning completed in a single operation, and no explicit file system unmounting (&quot;safe removal&quot;) is required by the user, since the file system remains managed by the mobile device&#x27;s operating system, and a mobile device is battery-powered, meaning power to the flash memory is not cut out unexpectedly.
*The device can access its own file system while connected:
**(+) Re-indexing after unplugging can be avoided. Also helped by the inclusion of metadata with the transfer.
**(+) A separate file system for host exposure is unnecessary. This avoids the inflexibility of setting aside a fixed-size partition for this file system.
*(+) File system support: The host does not need to support the file system of the device. Conversely, the device manufacturer is free to choose a file system (usually a Linux filesystem unsupported by Windows) other than the widely supported FAT family of filesystems.
*(-) Undeletion: Filesystem recovery and undeletion tools on the computer cannot be used, since MTP is an abstraction layer that offers no block-level access.
*(-) Missing time stamps: Many MTP-attached devices, particularly older ones, do not report file timestamps via the protocol, causing them to be lost when files are copied/moved to or from a computer. Some file formats still store timestamps internally, such as JPEG photos with embedded Exif meta data, but the date and time information of files without such internal metadata would be lost.
*(-) Mislocation: Users have reported files occasionally showing up in incorrect locations as a result of poor communication between the MTP host (e.g. smartphone) and client (e.g. computer file manager). Should a directory be moved away from the MTP host without the client detecting all files, undetected files could end up deleted without all files having been transferred successfully.
*(-) Truncation: If a file has newly been created on the smartphone while it was connected to the computer through MTP, the computer&#x27;s file manager could potentially misreport the file size as too small due to having loaded the directory listing in a moment where the file was not complete. Moving the file away from the phone could cause it to be truncated (incomplete) on the target path while being deleted from the source, since the file manager might wrongfully assume that the file has been fully transferred while it hasn&#x27;t.

===Performance===
*(-) MTP operations are not multiplexable – any ongoing operation must either complete or be aborted before another operation can begin. Unlike USB mass storage, where the host operating system is free to multiplex block transfers, and logical operations are an emergent phenomenon, the operations supported by MTP are more coarse-grained, such as transferring entire files. Neither protocol is parallel or asynchronous by itself (aside from the UAS extension of USB mass storage, which adds multiple command queues).
*(-) Limited support for transferring parts of files, such as blocks or byte ranges (see ).
*(-) Limited support for direct modification of files (see ). To modify a file or its metadata, the whole file may need to be copied out of the device and reuploaded, which takes a long time for a large file or directory, and blocks the device for other operations in the meantime. Google&#x27;s MTP implementation in Android includes extensions to deal with this limitation; however, these extensions must be supported by the host operating system.
*(-) Loading long file listings of directories with thousands of items is slow. This could cause &quot;preparing&quot; for transferring files from highly populated directories to take longer than the file transfer itself, since the file manager needs to generate a list of paths to files it is about to transfer, which requires accessing the slow directory listings.

===Transparency to MTP-unaware software===
(-) Windows does not assign drive letters or UNC paths to MTP devices because it does not natively expose them as virtual file systems. Without drive letters or UNC paths, MTP-unaware software cannot access directories or files on these devices. The user has to switch to an MTP-aware application, or else work around by using an MTP-aware application such as Windows Explorer to copy or move the file to a file system that the application can access.

One specific concern is that antivirus software on the host computer may not be aware of MTP devices, making them potentially less secure than mass storage devices (although if files on MTP devices are copied or moved to the host before use, MTP-unaware antivirus software will have a chance to scan them). Antivirus scanning might also be impractical due to blocking regular use of the device.

===Drivers know a fixed set of supported devices===
(-) Despite identifiability by the PTP/MTP USB device class, libmtp documentation indicates that the vendor and product ID combination plays a functional role in identifying an MTP device, also by Windows drivers. Libmtp includes vast listings of vendor and product ID numbers of devices that it supports, along with workarounds for bugs. This non-generic methodology hinders MTP drivers&#x27; forward compatibility with new devices.

===The spec knows a fixed set of defined file formats===
The MTP specification includes an enumeration of file formats, called &quot;object format&quot;. The use of this enumeration is in communicating supported file formats, and formats of transferred files.
Apart from some uncategorized formats in the beginning, the list of formats is grouped in categories of image, audio, video and document formats, with each category having one &quot;Undefined&quot; format followed by specific formats. There is also a super-generic &quot;Undefined object&quot; format.

Jolla cited lack of WebM support in MTP as one reason not to support the video format in their mobile operating system Sailfish OS. It is unclear if the limitation is in the tools or the spec, other than that WebM is not defined by the MTP 1.1 spec.

==Direct modification and partial transfer features==
These features can be used as more efficient alternatives to whole-file transfers and re-uploads:

From the MTP 1.1 spec:
===Android extensions===
According to go-mtpfs:
==MTP support==

===Windows===
==== Adaption in Windows ====
MTP is supported in Windows XP if Windows Media Player 10 or later versions are installed. Windows Vista and later have MTP support built in. For older versions of Windows, specifically, Windows 2000, Windows 98 and Windows Me, Microsoft has released the MTP Porting Kit. which contains a MTP device driver. Some manufacturers, such as Creative Technology, also provide legacy MTP drivers for some of their players; these usually consist of MTP Porting Kit files with a customized INF file describing their specific players.

==== Support by software ====
Windows does not assign drive letters or UNC pathnames to devices connected via MTP; instead, they only appear as named devices in MTP-aware applications such as Windows Explorer. Compared to devices that implement USB mass storage, such devices cannot be accessed programmatically by scripts or normal Windows programs that depend on drive letters or UNC paths. Instead, files must be manipulated using Windows Explorer or applications with specially written MTP support.

Under Windows, MTP-compatible devices support a feature called Auto Sync, which lets users configure Windows Media Player to automatically transfer all copied or newly acquired content to devices whenever they are connected - provided that content is compatible with Windows Media Player. Auto Sync is customizable so that the player will transfer only content that meets certain criteria (songs rated four stars or higher, for instance). Changes made to file properties (such as a user rating and file playback counts) on a device can be propagated back to the computer when the device is reconnected.

Copies of files accessed over MTP may remain on the host computer even after reboot, where they will be accessible to the user account which accessed them, as well as any other user accounts able to read that user account&#x27;s files, including any administrative users. Windows 7&#x27;s sensor platform supports sensors built into MTP-compatible devices.

==== File move behavior ====
In the implementation of MTP used by Windows Explorer, files from a selection moved out of a mobile device&#x27;s storage, perhaps with the goal of freeing up space, are not deleted individually from the source after each file, but instead the entire selection becomes deleted at once from the source only after the transfer has finished.

As a result, file moves aborted untimely, whether manually or unexpectedly, will not have freed up any space on the source device.

===Unix-like systems===
A free and open-source implementation of the Media Transfer Protocol is available as libmtp. This library incorporates product and device IDs from many sources, and is commonly used in other software for MTP support.

====Graphical====
GNOME applications like GNOME Files (formerly called Nautilus) and Archive Manager (formerly called File-Roller) use GIO-based GVfs to access files on MTP devices. Proper MTP support was added to GVfs in version 1.15.2 (2013-01-15) by Philip Langdale. Early patches for GVfs to enable Google&#x27;s direct I/O extensions are available.

The KDE Project develops the MTP KIO Slave with a similar level of integration as GVfs.

Not related to GNOME or KDE is the *NIX graphical MTP-capable media player, gMTP.

====Virtual file system====
Several tools provide a FUSE based file system for mounting MTP devices within the Unix filesystem hierarchy, making it accessible to any program that operates on files and directories.

====macOS====
macOS has built-in support for MTP (through the application &quot;Image Capture&quot;) but no (third-party) drivers to mount MTP devices as drives. Also several third-party file transfer applications are available for Mac OS X v10.5 and later:

*Android File Transfer is a simple MTP client.
*Android File Transfer For Linux (and Mac OS X), Open Source, License GPL Version 3, Graphical UI, Command line tool, FUSE wrapper - mounting your device,
*OpenMTP - Open Source MTP client. Advanced Android File Transfer Application for macOS. Graphical UI. Faster transfer speeds than Android File Transfer. 
*XNJB also offers syncing of iTunes playlists.
*SyncMate Expert claims to also support MTP besides other synchronization tasks. The support can&#x27;t be tested in the free version.
*Commander One PRO Pack - file manager that allows mounting MTP devices to Mac and managing their content.

===Other operating systems===
Later versions of several operating systems, including AmigaOS, Android, AROS, MorphOS, Symbian OS, and HarmonyOS/OpenHarmony/Oniro support MTP, sometimes with additional drivers or software.

A disadvantage of MTP devices on Android as compared to USB mass storage is that although file timestamps are preserved when copying files from the Android device to one&#x27;s computer, when copying in the other direction, the file modification timestamps are replaced with the time the copy was done.

===Other manufacturers===
Companies, including Creative Technology, Intel, iriver, and Samsung Electronics, that manufacture devices based on Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Portable Media Center specification&quot;, have widely adopted MTP. Supporting devices were introduced at the 2004 Consumer Electronics Show.

After an initial period of uncertain reactions, several large media player producers such as Creative Technology and iriver adopted the MTP protocol in place of their own protocols.

Many devices and audio software applications support MTP.

<text>Sauroposeidon ( ; meaning &quot;lizard earthquake god&quot;, after the Greek god Poseidon) is a genus of sauropod dinosaur known from several incomplete specimens including a bone bed and fossilized trackways that have been found in the U.S. states of Oklahoma, Wyoming, and Texas.

The fossils were found in rocks dating from near the end of the Early Cretaceous (Aptian–early Albian), from about 113 to 110 million years ago, a time when sauropod diversity in North America had greatly diminished. It was the last known North American sauropod prior to an absence of the group on the continent of roughly 40 million years that ended with the appearance of &quot;Alamosaurus&quot; during the Maastrichtian.

While the holotype remains were initially discovered in 1994, due to their unexpected age and unusual size they were initially misclassified as pieces of petrified wood. A more detailed analysis in 1999 revealed their true nature which resulted in a minor media frenzy, and formal publication of the find the following year.

Paleoecological analysis indicates that &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; lived on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, in a river delta. Extrapolations based on the more completely known &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; indicate that the head of &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; could reach in height with its neck extended, which would make it one of the tallest known dinosaurs. With an estimated length of and a mass of , it also ranks among the longest and heaviest. However, this animal may not be as closely related to &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; as previously thought, so these estimates may be inaccurate.

While initially described as a brachiosaurid closely related to &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot; and &quot;Giraffatitan&quot;, the discovery of additional remains in the Cloverly Formation of Wyoming suggested that it was in fact more closely related to the titanosaurs, in the group Somphospondyli. Analysis of these remains and comparison with others from Texas supported this conclusion, and demonstrated that the more completely known sauropods from the Twin Mountains Formation (including a partial skull and fossil trackways) previously named Paluxysaurus jonesi also belonged to &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot;. It is the state dinosaur of Texas.

==Discovery==

The first fossils classified as &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; were four neck vertebrae discovered in rural Oklahoma, not far from the Texas border, in a claystone outcrop that dates the fossils to about 110 million years ago (mya). This falls within the Early Cretaceous Period, specifically between the Aptian and Albian epochs. These vertebrae were discovered in May 1994 at the Antlers Formation in Atoka County, Oklahoma by dog trainer Bobby Cross and secured by Dr. Richard Cifelli and a team from the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History in May 1994 and August 1994. Initially the fossils were believed to be simply too large to be the remains of an animal, and due to the state of preservation, believed to be tree trunks. In fact, they are the longest such bones known in dinosaurs. Thus, the vertebrae were stored until 1999, when Dr. Cifelli gave them to a graduate student, Matt Wedel, to analyze as part of a project. Upon their realization of the find&#x27;s significance, they issued a press release in October 1999, followed by official publication of their findings in the &quot;Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology&quot; in March 2000. The new species was named &quot;S. proteles&quot;, and the holotype is OMNH 53062. It garnered immediate media attention leading to some sources calling it inaccurately the largest dinosaur ever.

The generic name comes from &quot;sauros&quot; (Greek σαύρος for &quot;lizard&quot;), and &quot;Poseidon&quot; (Ποσειδών), the sea god in Greek mythology, who is also associated with earthquakes, that facet styled as Ennosigaios or Enosikhthōn, &quot;Earthshaker&quot;. This is a reference to the notion that a sauropod&#x27;s weight was so great that the ground shook as it walked.The specific descriptor &quot;proteles&quot; also comes from the Ancient Greek πρωτέλης and means &quot;perfect before the end&quot;, which refers to &quot;Sauroposeidon&#x27;s&quot; status as the last and most specialized giant sauropod known in North America, during the Early Cretaceous.
In 2012, numerous other sauropod remains that had been known for decades under various different names were also classified in the genus &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot;. Sauropod bones and trackways had long been known from the Paluxy River area of Texas, usually referred to the genus &quot;Pleurocoelus&quot;, including partial skeletons (particularly from the Glen Rose Formation, above the Twin Mountains Formation). In the mid 1980s, students from the University of Texas at Austin discovered a bonebed on a ranch in Hood County, but early work stopped in 1987. The quarry was reopened in 1993 and was subsequently worked by parties from Southern Methodist University, the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, and Tarleton State University. All sauropod remains from this bonebed appear to come from the same genus of sauropod. Petrified logs are also known from the site. The site was fluvial when its rocks were being deposited, with channel sands and muds, and concretions of calcite-cemented sandstone containing fossils. Following excavation and preparation of the majority of the fossils from the site, its sauropod species was given the name &quot;Paluxysaurus jonesi&quot;.

The name &quot;Paluxysaurus&quot; was based on the specimen FWMSH 93B-10-18, a partial skull including an associated left maxilla, nasal, and teeth. Other bones from the quarry included a partial neck of seven vertebrae, thirteen vertebrae from the back and 30 from the tail, and examples of all limb and girdle bones except some hand and foot bones. It was distinguished from all other sauropods by vertebral details, and has various morphological differences in other bones compared to other sauropods of the Early Cretaceous of North America. The genus was limited to the bonebed remains; for example, the partial skeleton from Wise County known as &quot;Pleurocoelus&quot; sp. (SMU 61732) is not referred to &quot;Paluxysaurus&quot;; instead that specimen is the holotype of &quot;Astrophocaudia slaughteri&quot; D&#x27;Emic 2012, another somphospondylan sauropod. There are differences in the remains of &quot;P.&quot; sp. and &quot;Paluxysaurus&quot;, but they cannot be distinguished with confidence. In 2012, re-analysis of these specimens in light of additional &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; remains led paleontologists D&#x27;Emic and Foreman to conclude that &quot;Paluxysaurus&quot; was the same animal as &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot;, and thus a junior synonym of &quot;S. proteles&quot;.

==Description==
The original &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; find was composed of four articulated, mid-cervical vertebrae (numbers 5 to 8), with the cervical ribs in place. The vertebrae are extremely elongated, with the largest one having an overall length of , making it the longest sauropod neck vertebra on record. Examination of the bones revealed that they are honeycombed with tiny air cells, and are very thin, like the bones of a chicken or an ostrich, making the neck lighter and easier to lift. The cervical ribs were remarkably long as well, with the longest measurable rib (on vertebra 6) measuring – about 18% longer than the longest rib reported for &quot;Giraffatitan&quot;, but exceeded in length by the cervical ribs of &quot;Mamenchisaurus&quot;.
Estimates of &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot;&#x27;s size are based on a comparison between the four &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; vertebrae and the vertebrae of the HM SII specimen of &quot;Giraffatitan brancai&quot;, located in the Berlin&#x27;s Natural History Museum. The HM SII is the most complete brachiosaur known, though since it is composed of pieces from different individuals its proportions may not be totally accurate. Comparisons to the other relatives of &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; are difficult due to limited remains.
The neck length of &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; is estimated at , compared to a neck length of for the HM SII &quot;Giraffatitan&quot;. This is based on the assumption that the rest of the neck has the same proportions as &quot;Giraffatitan&quot;, which is a reasonably good conjecture.

&quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; was probably able to raise its head above the ground, which is as high as a six-story building. In comparison, &quot;Giraffatitan&quot; could probably raise its head into the air.

&quot;Sauroposeidon&#x27;s&quot; shoulder height has been estimated at based on an interpretation of the animal as a brachiosaurid. Estimates of its total possible length have ranged from to .

The mass of &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; is estimated at . While the vertebrae of &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; are 25–33% longer than &quot;Giraffatitan&quot;&#x27;, they are only 10–15% larger in diameter. This means that while &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; probably has a larger body than &quot;Giraffatitan&quot; its body is smaller in comparison to the size of its neck, so it did not weigh as much as a scaled-up &quot;Giraffatitan&quot;. By comparison, &quot;Giraffatitan&quot; might have weighed . This estimate of the &quot;Giraffatitan&quot; is an average of several different methodologies.

However, &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; has a gracile neck compared to &quot;Giraffatitan&quot;. If the rest of the body turns out to be similarly slender, the mass estimate may be too high. This could be similar to the way the relatively robust &quot;Apatosaurus&quot; weighs far more than the longer but much slimmer &quot;Diplodocus&quot;. In addition, it is possible that sauropods may have had an air sac system, like those in birds, which could reduce all sauropod mass estimates by 20% or more.

==Paleoecology==


Sauropods, which include the largest terrestrial animals of all time, were a very wide-ranging and successful group. They first appeared in the Early Jurassic and soon spread across the world. By the time of the late Jurassic, North America and Africa were dominated by the diplodocids and brachiosaurids and, by the end of the Late Cretaceous, titanosaurids were widespread (though only in the southern hemisphere). Between these periods, in the Early Cretaceous, the fossil record is sparse. Few specimens have been found in North America from that time and those specimens that do exist are often fragmentary or represent juvenile members of their species. Most of the surviving sauropods at the time were also shrinking in size to a mere in length, and maybe , which makes the discovery of an extremely specialized super-giant like &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; very unusual.

&quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; lived on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, which ran through Oklahoma at that time, in a vast river delta similar to the Mississippi delta today. This paleoenvironment, which has been preserved in the Antlers Formation, also stretches from southwest Arkansas through southeastern Oklahoma and into northeastern Texas. This geological formation has not been dated radiometrically. Scientists have used biostratigraphic data and the fact that it shares several of the same genera as the Trinity Group of Texas, to surmise that this formation was laid down during the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous Period, approximately 110 mya. The area preserved in this formation was a large floodplain that drained into a shallow inland sea. Several million years later, this sea would expand to the north, becoming the Western Interior Seaway and dividing North America in two for nearly the entire Late Cretaceous period. The paleoenvironment of &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; consisted of tropical or sub-tropical forests, river deltas, coastal swamps, bayous and lagoons, probably similar to that of modern-day Louisiana. There were few predators which could attempt to attack a full-grown &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot;, but juveniles were likely to be preyed on by the contemporary &quot;Acrocanthosaurus atokensis&quot; (a carnosaur slightly smaller than a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;), which likely were the apex predators in this region, and the small dromaeosaur &quot;Deinonychus antirrhopus&quot;. &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot; also shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs, such as the sauropod &quot;Astrodon&quot; (Pleurocoelus) and the most common dinosaur in this region, the ornithopod &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot;. Other vertebrates present during this time included the amphibian &quot;Albanerpeton arthridion&quot;, the reptiles &quot;Atokasaurus metarsiodon&quot; and &quot;Ptilotodon wilsoni&quot;, the cartilaginous fish &quot;Hybodus buderi&quot; and &quot;Lissodus anitae&quot;, the ray-finned fish &quot;Gyronchus dumblei&quot;, the crocodilians &quot;Goniopholis&quot;, &quot;Bernissartia&quot;, and &quot;Paluxysuchus&quot;, and the turtles &quot;Glyptops&quot; and &quot;Naomichelys&quot;. Possible indeterminate bird remains are also known from the Antlers Formation. The fossil evidence suggests that the gar &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; was the most common vertebrate in this region. The early mammals known from this region included &quot;Atokatherium boreni&quot; and &quot;Paracimexomys crossi&quot;.

<text>Walter Wyman (August 17, 1848 – November 21, 1911) was an American physician and soldier. He was appointed the third Surgeon General of the United States from 1891 until his death in 1911.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Wyman was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He obtained his A.B. degree from Amherst College in 1870 and then graduated in 1873 from the St. Louis Medical College (now Washington University School of Medicine)

===Career===
Wyman served as a physician at the city hospital in St. Louis for two years and then engaged in private practice for another year before joining the Marine Hospital Service in 1876 as an Assistant Surgeon. He was promoted to Surgeon the following year, and served successively in the marine hospitals at St. Louis, Cincinnati, Baltimore, and New York City. While he was in charge of the marine hospital in Staten Island, New York, the Hygienic Laboratory (forerunner of the National Institutes of Health) was established there in 1887 by Supervising Surgeon General John B. Hamilton. Wyman had studied in Europe in 1885, and was well acquainted with the bacteriological investigations of Robert Koch and others. He fully supported the creation of the Hygienic Laboratory.

In December 1888, Wyman moved to Washington, D.C. as Chief of the Quarantine Division. When Hamilton resigned as Supervising Surgeon General, Wyman was appointed to the position as of June 1, 1891. He was to remain at the helm of the Marine Hospital Service for 20 years.

During Wyman&#x27;s tenure, the Marine Hospital Service significantly expanded its responsibilities, and in 1902 was renamed the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service. At that time, Wyman&#x27;s title was also changed from Supervising Surgeon General to just Surgeon General. As a result of immigration legislation passed on March 3, 1891, shortly before Wyman took office, the Marine Hospital Service was assigned responsibility for the medical inspection of arriving immigrations. The largest immigration depot was Ellis Island in New York, opened in 1892, where service physicians would inspect thousands of arriving immigrants on busy days. The quarantine activities of the service were expanded by legislative acts of 1893 and 1906, and maritime quarantine functions were extended to Hawaii, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Panama Canal, and the Philippine Islands.

The 1902 act, which changed the name of the service, also charged the Surgeon General with convening a conference of state health authorities at least on an annual basis, and directed him to prepare and distribute to state health officers forms for the uniform compilation of vital statistics. This statistical information was published in the service&#x27;s journal, Public Health Reports. The 1902 law also expanded the Hygienic Laboratory, which Wyman had moved to Washington, D.C., in 1891. Under Wyman&#x27;s administration, the Laboratory significantly increased its research activities, including studies on diseases such as hookworm and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and was provided with a new building in 1901. The 1902 Biologics Control Act gave the Laboratory responsibility for the regulation of biological products such as vaccines and antitoxins.

In the early years of the twentieth century, Surgeon General Wyman found himself in the midst of a controversy over the San Francisco plague of 1900–1904. The service first became involved in the situation in 1900 when MHS physician Joseph J. Kinyoun, stationed in San Francisco, confirmed by bacteriological analysis that the death of a laborer in the city&#x27;s Chinatown section was due to bubonic plague. Many local officials and business leaders, as well as Chinatown residents, concerned about how fears of plague would affect their lives and businesses, denied the existence of the disease and/or resisted quarantine and immunization efforts. When Wyman attempted to enforce an embargo on interstate travel for Californians without proper health certificates, the Governor of the state, Henry Gage, persuaded President McKinley to lift the travel ban. By 1903, however, the situation had become serious enough that an emergency conference was held in Washington, D.C., and a recommendation was made that all traffic between California and the rest of the country be halted unless Federal authorities were permitted to carry out their eradication campaign. Faced with the threat of a national boycott, San Francisco officials cooperated with Wyman and the service, and a successful campaign to eliminate the disease was led by Public Health Service physician Rupert Blue (who later served as Surgeon General). The service under Wyman also cooperated with state and local health authorities in the control of other infectious diseases such as yellow fever.

Wyman was involved in the creation of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau in 1902. From the time of its organization until 1936, the Surgeons General of the Public Health Service served as the Directors of the Bureau, with Wyman as Director until his death in 1911. Many of Wyman&#x27;s health policies and principles were adopted by the Bureau. He also played a leading role in the first four Inter-American Sanitary Conferences, acting as President of the first two and attending the next two as the United States Delegate.
Wyman authorized a nationwide study of the prevalence of leprosy in 1901, and worked to establish a leprosy hospital and laboratory in Hawaii. In 1905, Wyman personally went to Hawaii to select the site of the new facility.

During his tenure as surgeon general, Wyman was active in professional service in a number of organizations. For example, he served as president of the American Public Health Association in 1902 and as president of the Association of Military Surgeons in 1904.

Wyman was a member of the Society of Colonial Wars. Lake Wyman in Boca Raton, Florida was named for him. He was reported being to the north in Lake Worth in 1883.

Wyman continued to serve as surgeon general until his death at Providence Hospital in Washington, D.C., on November 21, 1911.

==Commemoration==
The Public Health Service boarding tug USPHS &quot;Walter Wyman&quot;, in service from 1932 to 1957, was named for Wyman.

<doc id="1096655" wikidata="Q1841141" url="?curid=1096655" title="Lewis Buxton">
<text>Lewis Edward Buxton (born 10 December 1983) is an English former professional footballer who played as a defender.

Buxton began his career with Portsmouth where he progressed through the youth ranks at the club. He gained first team experience with loan spells at Exeter City and AFC Bournemouth. He joined Stoke City in January 2005 in order to find first team football. His time at the Britannia Stadium was hampered by injury and he left for Sheffield Wednesday in October 2008. With the Owls Buxton established himself as a regular member of the team and spent seven years, making 207 appearances.

==Career==
===Portsmouth===
A promising young defender, after working his way up through the Portsmouth youth ranks, Buxton made his first team debut at the beginning of the 2001–02 season, aged 17, in a 1–0 win at Stockport County. He was soon a regular in Graham Rix&#x27;s squad.

However, following Harry Redknapp&#x27;s appointment as manager at the club, and the subsequent influx of new players, Buxton found games harder to come by. He was loaned out to Exeter City for October 2002, but upon his return to Fratton Park still found the competition too great. In January he was loaned to AFC Bournemouth for the remainder of the season. He played 18 games whilst at Bournemouth, and helped them achieve promotion.

He returned to Portsmouth for the 2003–04 season, but by October he was again not in the first team picture, and so returned to Bournemouth for the season, this time playing 28 games for the Cherries. It was a similar story during the 2004–05 season when Buxton failed to break into the team on a regular basis.

===Stoke City===
After turning down several loan offers he decided to call time on his Portsmouth career and transferred to Football League Championship club Stoke City in January 2005. He scored his first senior goal in Stoke&#x27;s 3–1 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers in September 2005.

He was sidelined for the first 2 months of the season due to a back injury, but he made his first start of the season in Stoke City&#x27;s 1–0 win at Ipswich Town as a centre-half. However, he required an operation on his back, which kept him out for the remainder of the 2006–07 season. He since recovered and was ready for pre-season training, prior to the start of the 2007–08 season. He made his comeback as a substitute for Stephen Wright in the 33rd minute of Stoke&#x27;s 2–1 win over Charlton Athletic on 18 August 2007. Buxton only appeared fleetingly in the 2007–08 season.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
On 17 October 2008 Buxton moved to Sheffield Wednesday on an initial one-month loan deal. This was made a full deal on 26 January 2009 after Buxton expressed his desire to leave Stoke and move to Wednesday. He signed a -year contract. On 31 January 2009, Buxton scored his first goal for Wednesday against Birmingham City. He has played in many different positions at Hillsborough. These are Right Back, Left Back, Centre Back, Right Wing and Centre Midfield. He achieved promotion to the Championship with Wednesday in May 2012.

In 2012–13, Buxton was voted player of the year by the Sheffield Wednesday supporters. This was following a consistency across over 40 games in a regularly changed Wednesday defensive unit. Buxton was released by Wednesday at the end of the 2014–15 season.

===Rotherham United===
In June 2015 Buxton signed for Rotherham United on a one-year contract with the option of a further year. After Rotherham had succeeded in surviving from relegation in the Championship, finishing one place above the drop in 21st, the club decided to opt in not keeping Buxton for a further season, and instead let his contract run out, releasing him.

===Bolton Wanderers===
On 5 August 2016, following a successful trial with Charlton Athletic, Buxton turned down a one-year contract signing in favour of a one-year contract to join Bolton Wanderers. On 11 May 2017 the club confirmed that Buxton would be leaving at the end of his contract on 30 June. Buxton retired from playing football after leaving the Trotters.

==Post retirement==
After retiring Buxton co-founded Human Experience Coaching, working with players in the Premier League, Championship, and Major League Soccer and also wrote a book named &quot;The Athlete&#x27;s Bible&quot;.

<doc id="1096685" wikidata="Q687580" url="?curid=1096685" title="Italian grammar">
<text>Italian grammar is the body of rules describing the properties of the Italian language. Italian words can be divided into the following lexical categories: articles, nouns, adjectives, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.

==Articles==
Italian articles vary according to definiteness (definite, indefinite, and partitive), number, gender, and the initial sound of the subsequent word. Partitive articles compound the preposition &quot;&quot; with the corresponding definite article, to express uncertain quantity. In the plural, they typically translate into English as &quot;few&quot;; in the singular, typically as &quot;some&quot;.


==Inflection of nouns and adjectives==
Nouns have gender (masculine, feminine or, in many instances, both) and inflect in number (singular and plural). When a noun refers to people or animals with natural gender, grammatical gender typically corresponds. The gender each noun is written in is the opposite of arbitrary. Because most nouns have a masculine &quot;and&quot; a feminine form, the form the given noun is written in could change the entire structure of the sentence. As in most other Romance languages, the historical neuter has merged with the masculine. A subgroup of these deriving from Latin&#x27;s second declension are considered feminine in the plural. Subclauses and infinitives are masculine. Adjectives inflect for gender and number in patterns broadly similar to nouns.

In the last two examples, only the article carries information about gender and number.

Most masculine words that end in &quot;-io&quot; pronounced as drop the &quot;-o&quot; and thus end in &quot;-i&quot; in the plural: &quot;vecchio / &quot;vecchi (&#x27;old&#x27;), &quot;funzionario / &quot;funzionari (&#x27;functionary(-ies)&#x27;), &quot;esempio / &quot;esempi (&#x27;example(s)&#x27;), etc.

The Italian hard and soft C and G phenomenon leads to certain peculiarities in spelling and pronunciation:
* Words in &quot;-cio&quot; and &quot;-gio&quot; form plurals in &quot;-ci&quot; and &quot;-gi&quot;, e.g. &quot;bacio / &quot;baci (&#x27;kiss(es)&#x27;)
* Words in &quot;-cia&quot; and &quot;-gia&quot; have been a point of contention. According to a commonly employed rule, they:
** form plurals in &quot;-ce&quot; and &quot;-ge&quot; if the final letter before the suffix is a consonant: &quot;frangia, &quot;frange (&#x27;fringe(s)&#x27;); &quot;faccia, &quot;facce (&#x27;face(s)&#x27;).
** form plurals in &quot;-cie&quot; and &quot;-gie&quot; if the final letter before the suffix is a vowel: &quot;camicia, &quot;camicie (&#x27;shirt(s)&#x27;); &quot;ciliegia, &quot;ciliegie (&#x27;cherry&#x27;/&#x27;cherries&#x27;). Note that the presence of an &quot;i&quot; in the plural ending has no impact on the pronunciation in this case.
** when the &quot;i&quot; is stressed, it always remains in plural: &quot;farmacia / &quot;farmacie (&#x27;chemist&#x27;s shop(s)&#x27;), &quot;nevralgia / &quot;nevralgie (&#x27;neuralgia(s)&#x27;).
* Words in &quot;-co&quot; and &quot;-go&quot; behave irregularly: for some words the plural form causes the hard consonant to become soft, and for others the consonant remains hard. &quot;The grammarians are skeptical of any attempt at giving a ruling about this area.&quot; There are, however, certain rules of thumb:
** plurals are formed with &quot;-chi&quot; and &quot;-ghi&quot; if the last letter before the suffix is a consonant or a stressed vowel: &quot;fungo / &quot;funghi (&#x27;mushroom(s)&#x27;), &quot;stecco / &quot;stecchi (&#x27;stick(s)&#x27;), &quot;mago / &quot;maghi (&#x27;magician(s)&#x27;), &quot;fuoco / &quot;fuochi (&#x27;fire(s)&#x27;)
** plurals are formed with &quot;-ci&quot; and &quot;-gi&quot; if the last letter before the suffix is an unstressed vowel: &quot;comico / &quot;comici (&#x27;comedian(s)&#x27;), &quot;medico / &quot;medici (&#x27;physician(s)&#x27;)
** in words ending with &quot;-logo&quot; suffix, the plural is usually in &quot;-gi&quot; when &quot;-logo&quot; means &#x27;expert&#x27; or &#x27;student&#x27;, corresponding to English &quot;-logist&quot; (e.g. &quot;archeologo / &quot;archeologi, &#x27;archaeologist(s)&#x27;), while it is in &quot;-ghi&quot; when it means &#x27;speech&#x27; or &#x27;reasoning&#x27;, corresponding often to English &quot;-logue/-log&quot; (e.g. &quot;catalogo / &quot;cataloghi, &#x27;catalogue(s)&#x27;).
** there are exceptions such as &quot;amico / &quot;amici (&#x27;friend(s)&#x27;), &quot;greco / &quot;greci (&#x27;Greek(s)&#x27;), &quot;valico / &quot;valichi (&#x27;mountain pass(es)&#x27;), &quot;carico / &quot;carichi (&#x27;cargo(s)&#x27;).
* Words in &quot;-ca&quot; and &quot;-ga&quot; form plurals in &quot;-che&quot; and &quot;-ghe&quot;, e.g. &quot;amica / &quot;amiche (&#x27;female friend(s)&#x27;)

==Nouns==
Most nouns are derived from Latin. Many of these are themselves borrowed from Greek (e.g. &quot;poeta&quot; below). Although Italian nouns do not inflect for case, they are derived from a mixture of the Latin nominative and accusative cases:

Nouns ending in any letter other than &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-e&quot; or &quot;-o&quot;, as well as nouns ending in a stressed vowel, are normally invariable in the plural. Thus:
* &quot;la gru&quot; / &quot;le gru&quot; (&#x27;the crane(s)&#x27;, from Latin &quot;grūs / grūes&quot;)
* &quot;la città&quot; / &quot;le città&quot; (&#x27;the city(ies)&#x27;, contracted form of archaic &quot;cittade, cittadi&quot;, from Latin &quot;cīvitātem, cīvitātēs&quot;)
* &quot;il caffè&quot; / &quot;i caffè&quot; (&#x27;the coffee(s)&#x27;)
* &quot;il film&quot; / &quot;i film&quot; (&#x27;the film(s)&#x27;)

There are certain words (derived from Latin second-declension neuter nouns) that are masculine in the singular and feminine or masculine in the plural. Examples include:
* &quot;il braccio&quot; / &quot;le braccia&quot; or &quot;i bracci&quot; (&#x27;the arm(s)&#x27;)
* &quot;l&#x27;uovo&quot; / &quot;le uova&quot; (&#x27;the egg(s)&#x27;)
* &quot;il ginocchio&quot; / &quot;le ginocchia&quot; or &quot;i ginocchi&quot; (&#x27;the knee(s)&#x27;)
* &quot;il sopracciglio&quot; / &quot;le sopracciglia&quot; or &quot;i sopraccigli&quot; (&#x27;the eyebrow(s)&#x27;)
These nouns&#x27; endings derive regularly from the Latin neuter endings of the second declension (sg. &quot;-um&quot; / pl. &quot;-a&quot;), but there are some from the third declension as well: e.g. &quot;il gregge / le greggi&quot; (&#x27;flock(s)&#x27;, but &quot;i greggi&quot; works, too); the tradition of calling them &quot;irregular&quot; or &quot;mobile gender&quot; (&quot;genere mobile&quot;) would come from the paradigm that there are so few nouns of this type that the existence of neuter can be considered vestigial (compared to Romanian, which has many more nouns of the masculine singular–feminine plural type, and as such are usually classified as a separate neuter gender). The choice of plural is sometimes left to the user, while in some cases there are differences of meaning:
* Sometimes, for body parts, the feminine/neuter plural denotes the literal meaning while the masculine one denotes a figurative meaning: &quot;il braccio&quot; (&#x27;the arm&#x27;) / &quot;le braccia&quot; (&#x27;the arms&#x27;) / &quot;i bracci&quot; (&#x27;the isthmuses&#x27;, &#x27;the inlets&#x27;); &quot;il corno&quot; (&#x27;the horn&#x27;) / &quot;le corna&quot; (&#x27;the horns&#x27; of an animal) / &quot;i corni&quot; (&#x27;the horns&#x27; as musical instruments)
* Sometimes, especially in poetic and old-fashioned Italian, the masculine plural acts as a count noun, while the neuter/feminine plural acts as a mass noun: &quot;il cervello&quot; (&#x27;the brain&#x27;) / &quot;due cervelli&quot; (&#x27;two brains&#x27;) / &quot;le cervella&quot; (&#x27;the cerebral matter&#x27;); &quot;l&#x27;anello&quot; (&#x27;the ring&#x27;) / &quot;due anelli&quot; (&#x27;two rings&#x27;) / &quot;le anella&quot; (&#x27;ringlets&#x27;); furthermore, &quot;il dito&quot; (&#x27;the finger&#x27;) / &quot;le dita&quot; (&#x27;the fingers&#x27;) and also &quot;due dita&quot; (&#x27;two fingers&#x27;) / but &quot;i diti indici&quot; (&#x27;the index fingers&#x27;)

Most noun stems are derived from the accusative: Latin &quot;socer/socerum&quot; begets Italian &quot;suocero&quot;, and Latin &quot;pēs/pēdem&quot; begets Italian &quot;piede&quot;. There are a few exceptions, however, such as &quot;uomo&quot; from Latin &quot;homo/hominem&quot; and &quot;moglie&quot; from Latin &quot;mulier/mulierem&quot;. Neuter third-declension nouns may bequeath Italian nouns either from the nominative/accusative case (e.g. &quot;capo&quot; from &quot;caput&quot;, &quot;cuore&quot; from &quot;cor&quot;) or from the oblique case used for other cases and for the plural (e.g. &quot;latte&quot; from &quot;lac, lact-&quot;, &quot;giure&quot; from &quot;ius, iur-&quot;).

===Irregular plurals===
There are a few genuine irregular plurals in Italian (&quot;plurali irregolari&quot;). Most of these were introduced in Vulgar Latin, but some derive from irregular Latin plurals. Examples include:
* (&#x27;man&#x27;/&#x27;men&#x27;; Latin )
* (&#x27;god(s)&#x27;; note also the irregularity in the article: &quot;gli&quot; instead of &quot;i&quot;)
* (&#x27;ox(en)&#x27;; Latin )
* (&#x27;temple(s)&#x27;; the plural retains the &quot;l&quot; from Vulgar Latin in order to distinguish it from , the plural of ; the &quot;l&quot; is lost in the singular)

===Alteration===
In Italian, altered nouns are nouns with particular shades of meaning. They are divided into diminutives, &quot;vezzeggiativi&quot; (diminutives with kindness and sympathy nuance), augmentatives and pejoratives.

Many other alterations can be built, sometimes with more than one suffix: for example, &quot;libro&quot; (&#x27;book&#x27;) can become &quot;libretto&quot; (diminutive), &quot;libricino&quot; (double diminutive), &quot;libercolo&quot; (diminutive + pejorative), &quot;libraccio&quot; (pejorative), &quot;libraccione&quot; (pejorative + augmentative).
&quot;Uomo&quot; (&#x27;man&#x27;), coming from Latin &quot;homo&quot;, becomes &quot;om-&quot; in altered forms: &quot;omino&quot;/&quot;ometto&quot; (diminutive), &quot;omone&quot; (augmentative), &quot;omaccio&quot; (pejorative), &quot;omaccione&quot; (augmentative + pejorative).

==Adjectives==
In Italian, an adjective can be placed before or after the noun. The unmarked placement for most adjectives (e.g. colours, nationalities) is after the noun, but this is reversed for a few common classes of adjective—those denoting beauty, age, goodness, and size are placed &quot;before&quot; the noun in the unmarked case, and after the noun for emphasis.

Placing the adjective after the noun can alter its meaning or indicate restrictiveness of reference. If a noun has many adjectives, usually no more than one will be before the noun.

*&quot;un libro rosso&quot; = a red book (the unmarked case)
*&quot;un rosso libro&quot; = a book that is red (the marked case; it is especially important to the intended meaning that the book is &quot;red&quot;, as opposed to some other color)
*&quot;un buon uomo&quot; = a good man (the unmarked case)
*&quot;un uomo buono&quot; = a man who is good (the marked case; it is especially important to the intended meaning that he is good, the adjective is emphasized)

Adjectives are inflected for gender and number:

===Degrees of comparison===
Italian has three degrees of comparison: comparative, relative superlative and absolute superlative.

The comparative and relative superlative are formed with &quot;più&quot; (&#x27;more&#x27;, &#x27;most&#x27;); for instance:
* &quot;sono più alto di te&quot; (&quot;I am taller than you&quot;)
* &quot;sono il più alto fra gli uomini&quot; (&quot;I am the tallest of men&quot;)

Vice versa when expressing inferiority, &quot;meno&quot; (&#x27;less, fewer&#x27;) is used; for instance:
* &quot;sono il meno forte del campionato&quot; (&quot;I am the least strong of the championship&quot;)
* &quot;tu sei meno alto di me &quot; (&quot;You are less tall than me&quot;)

Another comparative form is made with the word &quot;come&quot; (&#x27;as&#x27;, &#x27;like&#x27;); for instance:
* &quot;sono alto come te&quot; (&quot;I am as tall as you&quot;)

The &quot;absolute comparative&quot; is formed by placing &quot;troppo&quot; (&#x27;too&#x27;) before the adjective; for instance: 
* &quot;sei troppo buono&quot; (&quot;you are too good&quot;).

The &quot;absolute superlative&quot;, derived from the Latin synthetic superlative in &quot;-issimus&quot;, is formed by adding &quot;-issimo&quot; to an adjective: &quot;intelligente&quot; (&#x27;intelligent&#x27;), &quot;intelligentissimo (&#x27;very intelligent&#x27;); &quot;sporco&quot; (&#x27;dirty&#x27;) &quot;sporchissimo (&#x27;very dirty&#x27;). If the two letters before the last vowel are &quot;pr&quot; or &quot;br&quot; (e.g., &quot;aspro&quot;, &quot;celebre&quot;), the &quot;r&quot; is removed and &quot;-errimo&quot; is the suffix used (&quot;asperrimo, &quot;celeberrimo) (&#x27;very sour&#x27;, &#x27;very famous&#x27;). Another way to form the &quot;absolute superlative&quot; is to place either &quot;molto&quot; or &quot;assai&quot; (&#x27;very&#x27;) before the adjective. For instance &quot;sporchissimo&quot; and &quot;molto sporco&quot; (&#x27;very dirty&#x27;) are the same, although the form ending in &quot;issimo&quot; is usually perceived as more emphatic; that is, &quot;sporchissimo&quot; is dirtier than &quot;molto sporco&quot;.

Some adjectives have irregular comparatives (although with regularly-formed variants also in common use), such as
* &quot;buono&quot; (&#x27;good&#x27;), &quot;migliore&quot; / &quot;più buono&quot; (&#x27;better&#x27; or &#x27;best&#x27;), &quot;ottimo&quot; / &quot;buonissimo&quot; (&#x27;very good&#x27;)
* &quot;cattivo&quot; (&#x27;bad&#x27;), &quot;peggiore&quot; / &quot;più cattivo&quot; (&#x27;worse&#x27; or &#x27;worst&#x27;), &quot;pessimo&quot; / &quot;cattivissimo&quot; (&#x27;very bad&#x27;)
* &quot;grande&quot; (&#x27;big&#x27;), &quot;maggiore&quot; / &quot;più grande&quot; (&#x27;bigger&#x27;), &quot;massimo&quot; / &quot;grandissimo&quot; (&#x27;very big&#x27;)
* &quot;piccolo&quot; (&#x27;small&#x27;), &quot;minore&quot; / &quot;più piccolo&quot; (&#x27;smaller&#x27;), &quot;minimo&quot; / &quot;piccolissimo&quot; (&#x27;very small&#x27;)

===Possessive adjectives===
With the exception of 3rd person plural &quot;loro&quot;, &#x27;their&#x27;, possessive adjectives, like articles, must agree with the gender and number of the noun they modify. Hence, &quot;mio zio&quot; (&#x27;my uncle&#x27;), but &quot;mia zia&quot; (&#x27;my aunt&#x27;). So depending on what is being modified, the possessive adjectives are:

In most cases the possessive adjective is used with an article, usually the definite article:

And sometimes with the indefinite article:

The only exception is when the possessive refers to an individual family member (unless the family member is described or characterised in some way):

&quot;Mamma&quot; and &quot;papà&quot; (or &quot;babbo&quot;, in central Italy; &#x27;mother&#x27; and &#x27;father&#x27;), however, are usually used with the article.

For emphasis, however, possessive adjectives are sometimes placed after the noun. This is usually after words such as &quot;colpa&quot; (&#x27;fault&#x27;, &#x27;sin&#x27;); &quot;casa&quot; (&#x27;house&#x27;, &#x27;home&#x27;); &quot;merito&quot; (&#x27;merit&#x27;); &quot;piacere&quot; (&#x27;pleasure&#x27;); or in vocative expressions.

If the antecedent of a third person possessive (being used as an object) is the subject of the sentence, &quot;proprio&quot; can be used instead of &quot;suo&quot;, although the usage of &quot;proprio&quot; is declining in spoken language:

The first sentence is unambiguous and states that Marco took his own point of view, whereas the second sentence is ambiguous because it may mean that Marco took either his own or Maria&#x27;s point of view.

===Demonstrative adjectives===
Italian originally had three degrees of demonstrative adjectives: &quot;questo&quot; (for items near or related to the first person speaker: &#x27;this&#x27;), &quot;quello&quot; (for items near or related to an eventual third person: &#x27;that&#x27;), and &quot;codesto&quot; (for items near or related to an eventual second person). The usage has undergone a simplification, including the meaning of &quot;codesto&quot; in &quot;quello&quot;, and only Tuscan speakers still use &quot;codesto&quot;. Its use is very rare in modern language, and the word has acquired a rather pejorative connotation.

==Pronouns==
Italian features a sizeable set of pronouns. Personal pronouns are inflected for person, number, case, and, in the third person, gender. Literary subject pronouns also have a distinction between animate (&quot;egli&quot;, &quot;ella&quot;) and inanimate (&quot;esso&quot;, &quot;essa&quot;) antecedents, although this is lost in colloquial usage, where &quot;lui&quot;, &quot;lei&quot; and &quot;loro&quot; are the most used forms for animate subjects, while no specific pronoun is employed for inanimate subjects (if needed, demonstrative pronouns such as &quot;questo&quot; or &quot;quello&quot; may be used). There is also the uninflected pronoun &quot;ciò&quot;, which is only used with abstract antecedents.

Personal pronouns are normally omitted in the subject, as the conjugation is usually enough to determine the grammatical person. They are used when some emphasis is needed, e.g. &quot;sono italiano&quot; (&#x27;I am Italian&#x27;) vs. &quot;io sono italiano&quot; (&quot;&#x27;I&quot; [specifically, as opposed to others] am Italian&#x27;).

The words &quot;ci&quot;, &quot;vi&quot; and &quot;ne&quot; act both as personal pronouns (respectively instrumental and genitive case) and clitic pro-forms for &quot;there&quot; (&quot;ci&quot; and &quot;vi&quot;, with identical meaning—as in c&#x27;è&quot;, ci sono&quot;, v&#x27;è&quot;, vi sono&quot;, &quot;ci vengo&quot;, etc.) and &quot;from there&quot; (&quot;ne—&quot;as in: &quot;è entrato in casa alle 10:00 e ne è uscito alle 11:00&quot;).



Notes:
===Clitic pronouns===
Although objects come after the verb as a rule, this is often not the case with a class of unstressed clitic pro-forms.

Clitic pronouns are replaced with the stressed form for emphatic reasons. A somewhat similar situation is represented by the dative shift in English ditransitive verbs. Compare, for example, (emphasis in italic) &quot;John gave a book to her&quot; with &quot;John gave her &quot;a book&quot;&quot;. In Italian these two different emphases map respectively to &quot;John diede un libro a lei&quot; (stressed form) and &quot;John le diede &quot;un libro&quot;&quot; (clitic form). Compared to English, Italian presents a richer set of cases.

Clitic pronouns generally come before the verb, but in certain types of constructions, such as &quot;lo devo fare&quot;, they can also appear as enclitics (attached to the verb itself)—in this case, &quot;devo farlo&quot;. In the infinitive, gerund and, except with third-person courtesy forms, imperative moods clitic pronouns must &quot;always&quot; be compound to the suffix as enclitics (as in &quot;confessalo!&quot; [2p. sg.]/&quot;confessiamolo!&quot; [1p. pl.]/&quot;confessatelo!&quot; [2p. pl.], &quot;ricordandolo&quot; and &quot;mangiarlo&quot;).

Other examples:
(Compare with the similar use of objective pronouns and pro-forms in French and Catalan.)

Finally, in the imperative mood, the objective pronouns come once again &quot;after&quot; the verb, but this time as a suffix:

* Stressed forms of all four non-subject cases are used when emphasized (e.g. &quot;uccidi me, non lui (&quot;kill me, not him&quot;), &quot;dallo a lei (&quot;give it to &quot;her&quot;&quot;), &quot;lo farò con lui&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ll do it with &quot;that&quot;&quot;), etc.).
* In colloquial speech, form I. of the dative (&quot;mi, ti, gli, le, si, ci, vi&quot;) is often associated with the emphasized form of the dative (&quot;a me, a te, a lui, a lei, a sé, a noi, a voi, a loro&quot;) in such a way: &quot;a me mi danno un libro&quot; (&quot;they give me a book&quot;), &quot;a loro gli hanno venduto una casa&quot; (&quot;they sold them a house&quot;). Although widely used, this redundant usage is considered non-standard.

====Combinations of clitics====
In Italian it is possible to append more than one clitic to a single verb. In normal usage, two is the usual limit, although clusters of three can occasionally arise for some speakers, especially with impersonal constructs (e.g. &quot;Ce la si sente&quot; = &quot;One feels up to it&quot;, or &quot;Nessuno ha ancora visto l&#x27;ultimo film di Woody Allen, quindi ce lo si vede tutti insieme!&quot; = &quot;Nobody has watched the last Woody Allen movie yet, so we have to watch it together!&quot;). Any two cases can be used together, except for accusative + genitive, and word order is strictly determined according to one of the following two patterns:

====Apocopated forms====
Clitic forms (except &quot;cui&quot;) before a verbal form beginning with a vowel (except when they are compound to the suffix) can be apocopated; apocopations are more common before verbal forms &quot;è&quot;, &quot;ho&quot;, &quot;hai&quot;, &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hanno&quot;, &quot;abbia&quot;, and &quot;abbiano&quot; of verbs &quot;essere&quot; and &quot;avere&quot;, than when they are before verbal forms of other verbs, which are more rare, also apocopations of &quot;che&quot; are rare, while apocopation of &quot;cui&quot; is avoided due to phonetic ambiguities with words such as &quot;qua&quot; (homophone to &quot;cu&#x27;ha&quot;).
Apocopation is not mandatory.
&quot;Ci&quot; is graphically apocopated only in front of &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot; (as in &quot;c&#x27;è&quot; and &quot;c&#x27;inserisco&quot;), but the &quot;i&quot; is graphically kept in front of other vowels (as in &quot;mi ci addentro&quot;), although in all cases it is pronounced /t͡ʃ/ (without the &quot;i&quot;); similarly &quot;gli&quot; is graphically apocopated only in front of &quot;i&quot; (as in &quot;gl&#x27;impongo&quot;) but not in front of other vowels (&quot;gli è dato sapere&quot;), although in all cases the &quot;i&quot; is never pronounced. The apocopated form of &quot;che&quot; is always pronounced /k/, even when otherwise common phonetic rules switch their pronunciations.


===T–V distinction===
Italian makes use of the T–V distinction in second-person address. The second-person nominative pronoun is &quot;tu&quot; for informal use, and for formal use, the third-person form &quot;Lei&quot; (and historically &quot;Ella&quot;) has been used since the Renaissance. It is used like &quot;Sie&quot; in German, &quot;usted&quot; in Spanish, and &quot;vous&quot; in French. &quot;Lei&quot; was originally an object form of &quot;ella&quot;, which in turn referred to an honorific of the feminine gender such as &quot;la magnificenza tua/vostra&quot; (&#x27;Your Magnificence&#x27;) or &quot;Vossignoria&quot; (&#x27;Your Lordship&#x27;), and by analogy, &quot;Loro&quot; came to be used as the formal plural. Previously, and in some Italian regions today (e.g. Campania), &quot;voi&quot; was used as the formal singular, like French &quot;vous&quot;. The pronouns &quot;lei&quot; (third-person singular), &quot;Lei&quot; (formal second-person singular), &quot;loro&quot; (third-person plural), and &quot;Loro&quot; (formal second-person plural) are pronounced the same but written as shown, and formal &quot;Lei&quot; and &quot;Loro&quot; take third-person conjugations. Formal &quot;Lei&quot; is invariable for gender (always feminine), but adjectives that modify it are not: one would say to a man La conosco&quot; (&#x27;I know you&#x27;) but &quot;Lei è alto (&#x27;You are tall&#x27;). Formal &quot;Loro&quot; is variable for gender: Li conosco&quot; (&#x27;I know you [masc. pl.]&#x27;) vs. Le conosco&quot; (&#x27;I know you [fem. pl.]&#x27;), etc. The formal plural is very rarely used in modern Italian; the unmarked form is widely used instead. For example: &quot;Gino, Lei è un bravo ingegnere. Marco, Lei è un bravo architetto. Insieme, voi sarete una gran bella squadra.&quot; (&quot;Gino, you are a good engineer. Marco, you are a good architect. Together, you will make a very good team.&quot;).

==Verbs==

Based on the ending of their &quot;infiniti presenti&quot; (&quot;-are&quot;, &quot;-ere&quot;, or &quot;-ire&quot;), all Italian verbs can be assigned to three distinct conjugation patterns. Exceptions are found: &quot;fare&quot;, &#x27;to do/make&#x27; (from Latin &quot;FACĔRE&quot;) , and &quot;dire&quot;, &#x27;to say&#x27; (from Latin &quot;DICĔRE&quot;) , were originally 2nd conjugation verbs that reduced the unstressed vowel in the infinitive (and consequentially in the future and conditional, whose stem derives from the infinitive), but still follow the 2nd conjugation for all the other tenses; this behaviour is similarly featured in the verbs ending in &quot;-trarre&quot;, &quot;-porre&quot; and &quot;-durre&quot;, derived respectively from the Latin &quot;TRAHĔRE&quot; (&#x27;to drag&#x27;) , &quot;PONĔRE&quot; (&#x27;to put&#x27;) and &quot;DVCĔRE&quot; (&#x27;to lead&#x27;) .

Just like many other Romance languages, Italian verbs express distinct verbal aspects by means of analytic structures such as periphrases, rather than synthetic ones; the only aspectual distinction between two synthetic forms is the one between the &quot;imperfetto&quot; (habitual past tense) and the &quot;passato remoto&quot; (perfective past tense), although the latter is usually replaced in spoken language by the &quot;passato prossimo&quot;.

===Tenses===

====Simple tenses====
====Compound tenses====
Aspects other than the habitual and the imperfective, such as the perfective, the progressive and the prospective, are rendered in Italian by a series of periphrastic structures that may or may not be perceived as different tenses by different speakers. Note the difference between:
*Perfect aspect: &quot;io ho fatto&quot; (&quot;I have done&quot;)
*Progressive aspect: &quot;io sto facendo&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m doing&quot;)
*Prospective aspect: &quot;io sto per fare&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m about to do&quot;)

====Impersonal forms====
;Notes
===Compound tense auxiliary verbs===
In Italian, compound tenses expressing perfect aspect are formed with either auxiliary verb &quot;&quot; (&#x27;to have&#x27;) for transitive verbs and some intransitive verbs and with &quot;&quot; (&#x27;to be&#x27;) for the remaining intransitive verbs, plus the past participle. Progressive aspect is rendered by verb &quot;&quot; plus the gerund. The prospective aspect is formed with &quot;stare&quot; plus the preposition &quot;&quot; and the infinitive.

The passive voice of transitive verbs is formed with &quot;&quot; in the perfective and prospective aspects, with &quot;&quot; in the progressive or habitual aspect, and with either &quot;essere&quot; or &quot;venire&quot; in the perfective aspects:
* &quot;Il cancello è stato appena aperto.&quot; (&quot;The gate has just been opened.&quot;)
* &quot;Il cancello sta per essere aperto&quot; (&quot;The gate is about to be opened.&quot;)
* &quot;Il cancello sta venendo aperto in questo momento.&quot; (&quot;The gate is being opened right now.&quot;)
* &quot;Il cancello viene aperto ogni giorno.&quot; (&quot;The gate is opened every day.&quot;)
* &quot;Il cancello fu/venne aperto in fretta.&quot; (&quot;The gate was quickly opened.&quot;)

For the perfect tenses of intransitive verbs a reliable rule cannot be given, although a useful rule of thumb is that if a verb&#x27;s past participle can take on adjectival value, &quot;essere&quot; is used, otherwise &quot;avere&quot;. Also, reflexive verbs and unaccusative verbs use &quot;essere&quot; (typically non-agentive verbs of motion and change of state, i.e. involuntary actions such as &quot;&quot; (&#x27;to fall&#x27;) or &quot;&quot; (&#x27;to die&#x27;)).

The distinction between the two auxiliary verbs is important for the correct formation of the compound tenses and is essential to the agreement of the past participle. Some verbs, such as &quot;&quot; (&#x27;to live&#x27;), may use both: &quot;Io ho vissuto&quot; (&#x27;I have lived&#x27;) can alternatively be expressed as, &quot;Io sono vissuto&quot;.

===Past participle===
The past participle is used in Italian as both an adjective and to form many of the compound tenses of the language. There are regular endings for the past participle, based on the conjugation class (see below). There are, however, many irregular forms as not all verbs follow the pattern, particularly the -ere verbs. Some of the more common irregular past participles include: &quot;essere&quot; (&#x27;to be&#x27;) → &quot;stato&quot; (same for &quot;stare&quot;); &quot;fare&quot; (&#x27;to do&#x27;, &#x27;to make&#x27;) → &quot;fatto&quot;; &quot;dire&quot; (&#x27;to say, to tell&#x27;) → &quot;detto&quot;; &quot;aprire&quot; (&#x27;to open&#x27;) → &quot;aperto&quot;; &quot;chiedere&quot; (&#x27;to ask&#x27;) → &quot;chiesto&quot;; &quot;chiudere&quot; (&#x27;to close&#x27;) → &quot;chiuso&quot;; &quot;leggere&quot; (&#x27;to read&#x27;) → &quot;letto&quot;; &quot;mettere&quot; (&#x27;to put&#x27;) → &quot;messo&quot;; &quot;perdere&quot; (&#x27;to lose&#x27;) → &quot;perso&quot;; &quot;prendere&quot; (&#x27;to take&#x27;, &#x27;to get&#x27;) → &quot;preso&quot;; &quot;rispondere&quot; (&#x27;to answer&#x27;) → &quot;risposto&quot;; &quot;scrivere&quot; (&#x27;to write&#x27;) → &quot;scritto&quot;; &quot;vedere&quot; (&#x27;to see&#x27;) → &quot;visto&quot;.

For the intransitive verbs taking &quot;essere&quot;, the past participle always agrees with the subject—that is, it follows the usual adjective agreement rules: &quot;egli è partito; ella è partita&quot;. This is also true for reflexive verbs, the impersonal &quot;si&quot; construction (which requires any adjectives that refer to it to be in the masculine plural: &quot;Si è sempre stanchi alla fine della giornata&quot; – One is always tired at the end of the day), and the passive voice, which also use &quot;essere&quot; (&quot;Queste mele sono state comprate da loro&quot; – These apples have been bought by them, against &quot;Essi hanno comprato queste mele&quot; – They bought these apples).

The past participle when used with &quot;avere&quot; never changes to agree with the subject. It &quot;must&quot; agree with &quot;the object&quot;, although, in sentences where this is expressed by a third person clitic pronoun (e.g. &quot;Hai mangiato la mela? – Sì, l&#x27;ho mangiata (Have you eaten the apple? – Yes, I have eaten it)). When the object is expressed by a first or second person clitic pronoun instead, the agreement is optional: &quot;Maria! Ti ha chiamato / chiamata Giovanni? – No, non mi ha chiamato / chiamata (Maria! Has Giovanni called you? – No, he has not).

In all the other cases where the object is not expressed by a clitic pronoun, the agreement with the object is obsolescent in modern Italian (but still correct): &quot;La storia che avete raccontata&quot; (obsolete) &quot;/ raccontato non mi convince&quot; (The story you told does not convince me); or compare Manzoni&#x27;s &quot;Lucia aveva avute due buone ragioni&quot; with the more modern &quot;Lucia aveva avuto due buone ragioni&quot; (Lucia had had two good reasons).

===Tense relationship in subordinate sentences===
Italian inherits &quot;consecutio temporum&quot;, a grammar rule from Latin that governs the relationship between the tenses in principal and subordinate clauses. &quot;Consecutio temporum&quot; has very rigid rules. These rules require the subjunctive tense in order to express contemporaneity, posteriority and anteriority in relation with the principal clause.

* To express contemporaneity when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, present, or simple past), the subordinate clause uses the present subjunctive, to express &quot;contemporaneity in the present&quot;.
** &quot;Penso che Davide sia intelligente.&quot; I think David is smart.
* When the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subordinate clause uses the imperfect subjunctive, expressing &quot;contemporaneity in the past&quot;.
** &quot;Pensavo che Davide fosse intelligente&quot;. I thought David was smart.
* To express anteriority when the principal clause is in a simple tense (future, or present or passato prossimo) the subordinate clause uses the past subjunctive.
** &quot;Penso che Davide sia stato intelligente.&quot; I think David has been smart.
* To express anteriority when the principal clause has a past imperfect or perfect, the subjunctive has to be pluperfect.
** &quot;Pensavo che Davide fosse stato intelligente.&quot; I thought David had been smart.
* To express posteriority the subordinate clause uses the future tense in the indicative mood, not the subjunctive, because the subjunctive has no future tense.
** &quot;Penso che Davide sarà intelligente.&quot; I think David will be smart.
* To express posteriority with respect to a past event, the subordinate clause uses the past conditional, whereas in other European languages (such as French, English, and Spanish) the present conditional is used.
** &quot;Pensavo che Davide sarebbe stato intelligente.&quot; I thought that David would have been smart.

===Regular conjugation===
The infinitive of first conjugation verbs ends in &quot;-are,&quot; that of second conjugation verbs in &quot;-ere,&quot; and that of third conjugation verbs in &quot;-ire.&quot; In the following examples for different moods, the first conjugation verb is &quot;parlare&quot; (&#x27;to talk/speak&#x27;), the second conjugation verb is &quot;temere&quot; (&#x27;to fear&#x27;) and the third conjugation verb is &quot;partire&quot; (&#x27;to leave/depart&#x27;).

====Indicative mood====
Many third conjugation verbs insert an infix &quot;-sc-&quot; between the stem and the endings in the first, second, and third persons singular and third person plural of the present indicative and subjunctive, e.g., &quot;capire&quot; &gt; &quot;capisco, capisci, capisce, capiamo, capite, capiscono&quot; (indicative) and &quot;capisca, capisca, capisca, capiamo, capiate, capiscano&quot; (subjunctive). This subgroup of third conjugation verbs is usually referred to as &quot;incoativi&quot;, because in Latin the original function of the suffix -sc- was to denote inchoative verbs, but this meaning is totally lost in modern Italian, where the suffix mostly serves a euphonic function.

====Subjunctive mood====
The Italian subjunctive mood is used to indicate cases of desire, express doubt, make impersonal emotional statements, and to talk about impending events.
*Third conjugation verbs, such as &quot;capire&quot;, mentioned above insert &quot;-isc-&quot; in the first, second, and third persons singular and third person plural of the present.
*Compound forms (&quot;past&quot; and &quot;past perfect&quot;) are made by adding the past participle (e.g. &quot;parlato&quot;) to the corresponding auxiliary form (as &quot;abbia&quot;) in the present and imperfect.

====Conditional mood====
As the table shows, verbs each take their own root from their class of verb: &quot;-are&quot; becomes -&quot;er&quot;-, -&quot;ere&quot; becomes -&quot;er&quot;-, and -&quot;ire&quot; becomes -&quot;ir&quot;-, the same roots as used in the future indicative tense. All verbs add the same ending to this root.

Some verbs do not follow this pattern, but take irregular roots, these include:
Andare (&#x27;to go&#x27;) ~ Andr-, Avere (&#x27;to have&#x27;) ~ Avr-, Bere (&#x27;to drink&#x27;) ~ Berr-,
Dare (&#x27;to give&#x27;) ~ Dar-, Dovere (&#x27;to have to&#x27;) ~ Dovr-, Essere (&#x27;to be&#x27;) ~ Sar-,
Fare (&#x27;to make/do&#x27;) ~ Far-, Godere (&#x27;to enjoy&#x27;) ~ Godr-, Potere (&#x27;to be able to&#x27;) ~ Potr-,
Rimanere (&#x27;to remain&#x27;) ~ Rimarr-, Sapere (&#x27;to know&#x27;) ~ Sapr-, Sedere (&#x27;to sit&#x27;) ~ Sedr-,
Stare (&#x27;to be/feel&#x27;) ~ Star-, Tenere (&#x27;to hold&#x27;) ~ Terr-, Vedere (&#x27;to see&#x27;) ~ Vedr-,
Venire (&#x27;to come&#x27;) ~ Verr-, Vivere (&#x27;to live&#x27;) ~ Vivr-, Volere (&#x27;to want&#x27;) ~ Vorr- etc.

The Italian conditional mood is a mood that refers to an &quot;action&quot; that is possible or probable, but is dependent upon a condition. Example:
It can be used in two tenses, the present, by conjugation of the appropriate verb, or the past, using the auxiliary conjugated in the conditional, with the past participle of the appropriate noun:
Many Italian speakers often use the imperfect instead of the conditional and subjunctive. Prescriptivists usually view this as incorrect, but it is frequent in colloquial speech and tolerated in all but high registers and in most writing:
The conditional can also be used in Italian to express &quot;could&quot;, with the conjugated forms of &quot;potere&quot; (&#x27;to be able to&#x27;), &quot;should&quot;, with the conjugated forms of &quot;dovere&quot; (&#x27;to have to&#x27;), or &quot;would like&quot;, with the conjugated forms of &quot;volere&quot; (&#x27;want&#x27;):
====Imperative mood====
Verbs such as &quot;capire&quot; insert &quot;-isc-&quot; in all except the &quot;noi&quot; and &quot;voi&quot; forms. Technically, the only real imperative forms are the second-person singular and plural, with the other persons being borrowed from the present subjunctive.

====Non-finite forms====
* Infinitive: present: -are, -ere, -ire; past: avere/essere + past participle
* Gerund: present: -ando, -endo, -endo; past: avendo/essendo + past participle
* Participle: present: -ante -ente -ente; past: -ato, -uto (although verbs of the second conjugation almost always have a contracted desinence, e.g. &quot;cuocere&quot; (&#x27;to cook&#x27;) &quot;cotto&quot; (&#x27;cooked&#x27;)), -ito

===Irregular verbs===
While the majority of Italian verbs are regular, many of the most commonly used are irregular. In particular, the auxiliary verbs &quot;essere&quot;, &quot;stare&quot; and &quot;avere&quot;, and the common modal verbs &quot;dovere&quot; (expressing necessity or obligation), &quot;potere&quot; (expressing permission and to a lesser degree ability), &quot;sapere&quot; (expressing ability) and &quot;volere&quot; (expressing willingness) are all irregular.

The only irregular verbs of the first conjugation are &quot;dare&quot; (&#x27;to give&#x27;), which follows the same pattern as &quot;stare&quot;, and &quot;andare&quot; (&#x27;to go&#x27;), which features suppletive forms in the present of the indicative, subjunctive and imperative from the Latin verb &quot;VADERE&quot;. While apparently a 1st conjugation verb, &quot;fare&quot; is actually a highly irregular verb of the second conjugation. Even the third conjugation features a small handful of irregular verbs, such as &quot;morire&quot; (&#x27;to die&#x27;), whose present is &quot;muoio, muori, muore, moriamo, morite, muoiono&quot; (indicative) and &quot;muoia, muoia, muoia, moriamo, moriate, muoiano&quot; (subjunctive).

The second conjugation combines the second and third conjugation of Latin; since the verbs belonging to the third conjugation were athematic, and they behaved less regularly than the ones belonging to the other conjugations (compare &quot;AMĀRE&quot; &gt; &quot;AMAVI, AMATVS&quot;, first conjugation, and &quot;LEGĚRE&quot; &gt; &quot;LEGI, LECTVS&quot;, third conjugation), the second conjugation Italian features many irregularities that trace back to the original paradigms of the Latin verbs: &quot;amare&quot; &gt; &quot;amai, amato&quot; (first conjugation, regular), but &quot;leggere&quot; &gt; &quot;lessi, letto&quot; (second conjugation, irregular).





==Adverbs==
An adjective can be made into a modal adverb by adding &quot;-mente&quot; (from Latin &quot;mente&quot;, ablative of &quot;mens&quot; (&#x27;mind&#x27;), feminine noun) to the ending of the feminine singular form of the adjective. E.g. &quot;lenta&quot;, &#x27;slow&#x27; (feminine), becomes &quot;lentamente&quot;, &#x27;slowly&#x27;. Adjectives ending in &quot;-re&quot; or &quot;-le&quot; lose their &quot;e&quot; before adding &quot;-mente&quot; (&quot;facile&quot;, &#x27;easy&#x27;, becomes &quot;facilmente&quot;, &#x27;easily&#x27;; &quot;particolare&quot;, &#x27;particular&#x27;, becomes &quot;particolarmente&quot;, &#x27;particularly&#x27;).

These adverbs can also be derived from the absolute superlative form of adjectives, e.g. &quot;lentissimamente&quot; (&#x27;very slowly&#x27;), &quot;facilissimamente&quot; (&#x27;very easily&#x27;).

There is also a plethora of temporal, local, modal and interrogative adverbs, mostly derived from Latin, e.g. &quot;quando&quot; (&#x27;when&#x27;), &quot;dove&quot; (&#x27;where&#x27;), &quot;come&quot; (&#x27;how&#x27;), &quot;perché&quot; (&#x27;why/because&#x27;), &quot;mai&quot; (&#x27;never&#x27;), &quot;sempre&quot; (&#x27;always&#x27;), etc.

==Prepositions==
Italian has a closed class of basic prepositions, to which a number of adverbs can be added that also double as prepositions, e.g.: &quot;sopra il tavolo&quot; (&#x27;upon the table&#x27;), &quot;prima di adesso&quot; (&#x27;before now&#x27;).

In modern Italian the prepositions &quot;tra&quot; and &quot;fra&quot; are interchangeable, and often chosen on the basis of euphony: &quot;tra fratelli&quot; (&#x27;among brothers&#x27;) vs. &quot;fra i tralicci&quot; (&#x27;between the power pylons&#x27;).

In modern Italian, all the basic prepositions except &quot;tra&quot;, &quot;fra&quot;, &quot;con&quot; and &quot;per&quot; have to be combined with an article placed next to them. Of these, &quot;con&quot; and &quot;per&quot; have optional combining forms: &quot;col, collo, colla, coll&#x27;, coi, cogli, colle&quot;; &quot;pel, pello, pella, pell&#x27;, pei, pegli, pelle&quot;; except for &quot;col&quot; and &quot;coi&quot;, which are occasionally used, however, these are archaic and very rare.

Prepositions normally require the article before the following noun in a similar way as the English language does. However Latin&#x27;s lack of articles influenced several cases of prepositions used without article in Italian (e.g., &quot;a capo&quot;, &quot;da capo&quot;, &quot;di colpo&quot;, &quot;in bicicletta&quot;, &quot;per strada&quot;).

The preposition &quot;su&quot; becomes &quot;su di&quot; before a pronoun (e.g., &quot;su di te&quot;). Some speakers also use &quot;su di&quot; before a word beginning in &quot;u&quot; for euphonic reasons (e.g., &quot;su di un cavallo&quot;), but this is regarded as incorrect by grammarians. Historically the variant form &quot;sur&quot; was used before the letter &quot;u&quot;; however, this form fell into disuse during the nineteenth century.

==Syntax==
Italian is an SVO language. Nevertheless, the SVO sequence is sometimes replaced by one of the other arrangements (SOV, VSO, OVS, etc.), especially for reasons of emphasis and, in literature, for reasons of style and metre: Italian has relatively free word order.

The subject is usually omitted when it is a pronoun—distinctive verb conjugations make it redundant. Subject pronouns are considered emphatic when used at all.

Questions are formed by a rising intonation at the end of the sentence (in written form, a question mark). There is usually no other special marker, although wh-movement does usually occur. In general, intonation and context are important to recognize questions from affirmative statements.

In general, adjectives come after the noun they modify, adverbs after the verb. But: as with French, adjectives coming before the noun indicate essential quality of the noun. Demonstratives (e.g. &quot;questo&quot;, &#x27;this&#x27;, &quot;quello&quot;, &#x27;that&#x27;) come before the noun, and a few particular adjectives (e.g. &quot;bello&quot;) may be inflected like demonstratives and placed before the noun.

==Disputed points in Italian grammar==
Among sometimes proscribed Italian forms are:
* The usage of an indicative form where a subjunctive one is traditional; for instance: &quot;credo che Giorgio ieri fosse a casa&quot; (&quot;I believe that yesterday George was at home&quot;) is considered proper, while &quot;credo che Giorgio ieri era a casa&quot; may not be; &quot;se Maria fosse stata a casa, le avrei telefonato&quot; (&quot;if Mary had been at home, I would have telephoned her&quot;) is preferred, &quot;se Maria era a casa le telefonavo&quot; is often proscribed, despite being found in classic Italian writers.
* The use of the object forms (&quot;lui&quot;, &quot;lei&quot;, &quot;loro&quot; and &quot;Lei&quot;) of third person pronouns instead of the subject forms (&quot;egli&quot;, &quot;ella&quot;, &quot;essi&quot; and &quot;Ella&quot;), which are employed in formal language.
* &quot;Ma però&quot;, despite being widespread in spoken language, is proscribed in formal usage because it is redundant (&quot;ma&quot; and &quot;però&quot; are synonyms).

==Italian grammar books==
The first Italian grammar was printed by Giovanni Francesco Fortunio in 1516 with the title &quot;Regole grammaticali della volgar lingua&quot;. Ever since, several Italian and foreign scholars have published works devoted to its description. Among others may be mentioned the famous &quot;Grammatica storica della lingua italiana e dei suoi dialetti&quot; written by the philologist Gerhard Rohlfs, published at the end of the 1960s.

Among the most modern publications are those by Luca Serianni, in collaboration with Alberto Castelvecchi, &quot;Grammatica italiana. Suoni, forme, costrutti&quot; (Utet, Torino, 1998); and by Lorenzo Renzi, Giampaolo Salvi and Anna Cardinaletti, &quot;Grande grammatica italiana di consultazione&quot; (3 vol., Bologna, Il Mulino, 1988–1995). The most complete and accurate grammar in English is &quot;A Reference Grammar of Modern Italian&quot; by Martin Maiden and Cecilia Robustelli (McGraw-Hill, Chicago, 2000; 2nd edition Routledge, New York, 2013).

<doc id="1096688" wikidata="Q1438403" url="?curid=1096688" title="Dominance hierarchy">
<text>In the zoological field of ethology, a dominance hierarchy (formerly and colloquially called a pecking order) is a type of social hierarchy that arises when members of animal social groups interact, creating a ranking system. Different types of interactions can result in dominance depending on the species, including ritualized displays of aggression or direct physical violence. In social living groups, members are likely to compete for access to limited resources and mating opportunities. Rather than fighting each time they meet, individuals of the same sex establish a relative rank, with higher-ranking individuals often gaining more access to resources and mates. Based on repetitive interactions, a social order is created that is subject to change each time a dominant animal is challenged by a subordinate one.

== Definitions ==

Dominance is an individual&#x27;s preferential access to resources over another based on coercive capacity based on strength, threat, and intimidation, compared to prestige (persuasive capacity based on skills, abilities, and knowledge). A dominant animal is one whose sexual, feeding, aggressive, and other behaviour patterns subsequently occur with relatively little influence from other group members. Subordinate animals are opposite; their behaviour is submissive, and can be relatively easily influenced or inhibited by other group members.

== Dominance ==
For many animal societies, an individual&#x27;s position in the dominance hierarchy corresponds with their opportunities to reproduce. In hierarchically social animals, dominant individuals may exert control over others. For example, in a herd of feral goats it is a large male that is dominant and maintains discipline and coherence of the flock. He leads the group but shares leadership on a foraging expedition with a mature she-goat who will normally outlast a succession of dominant males. However, earlier work showed that leadership orders in goats were not related to age or dominance. In sheep, position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, but there is no definite study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual. In birds, dominant individuals preferentially select higher perches to put themselves in the best position to detect and avoid predators, as well as to display their dominance to other members of their own species. It has been suggested that decision-taking about the actions of the group is commonly dissociated from social dominance.

=== When individuals seek high rank ===

Given the benefits and costs of possessing a high rank within a hierarchical group, there are certain characteristics of individuals, groups, and environments that determine whether an individual will benefit from a high rank. These include whether or not high rank gives them access to valuable resources such as mates and food. Age, intelligence, experience, and physical fitness can influence whether or not an individual deems it worthwhile to pursue a higher ranking in the hierarchy, which often comes at the expense of conflict. Hierarchy results from interactions, group dynamics, and sharing of resources, so group size and composition affect the dominance decisions of high-ranking individuals. For example, in a large group with many males, it may be difficult for the highest-ranking male to dominate all the mating opportunities, so some mate sharing is likely to exist. These opportunities available to subordinates reduce the likelihood of a challenge to the dominant male: mating is no longer an all-or-nothing game and the sharing is enough to placate most subordinates. Another aspect that can determine dominance hierarchies is the environment. In populations of Kenyan vervet monkeys, high-ranking females have higher foraging success when the food resources are clumped, but when food is distributed throughout an area they lose their advantage, because subordinate females can acquire food with less risk of encountering a dominant female.

=== Benefits ===

==== Foraging success ====

A benefit to high-ranking individuals is increased foraging success and access to food resources. During times of water shortage the highest-ranking vervet females have greater access than subordinates females to water in tree holes. In chacma baboons, the high-ranking males have the first access to vertebrate prey that has been caught by the group, and in yellow baboons the dominant males feed for longer without being interrupted.

In many bird species, the dominant individuals have higher rates of food intake. Such species include dark-eyed juncos and oystercatchers. The dominant individuals in these groups fill themselves up first and fill up more quickly, so they spend less time foraging, which reduces the risk of predation. Thus they have increased survival because of increased nutrition and decreased predation.

==== Reproductive success ====

In primates, a well-studied group, high rank brings reproductive success, as seen in a 1991 meta-analysis of 32 studies. A 2016 study determined that higher status increased reproductive success amongst men, and that this did not vary by type of subsistence (foraging, horticulture, pastoralism, agriculture). This contradicts the &quot;egalitarian hypothesis&quot;, which predicts that status would affect reproductive success more amongst foragers than amongst nonforagers.

High-ranking bonnet macaque males have more access to fertile females and consequently partake in most of the matings within the group; in one population, three males were responsible for over 75% of matings. In this population, males often vary in rank. As their rank improves, they gain more exclusive time with fertile females; when their rank decreases, they get less time. In many primates, including bonnet macaques and rhesus monkeys, the offspring of high-ranking individuals have better fitness and thus an increased rate of survival. This is most likely a function of two factors: The first is that high-ranking males mate with high-ranking females. Assuming their high rank is correlated with higher fitness and fighting ability, this trait will be conferred to their offspring. The second factor is that higher-ranking parents probably provide better protection to their offspring and thus ensure higher survival rates. Amongst rhesus macaques, higher-ranking males sired more offspring, though the alpha male was never the one to sire the most offspring, with that instead being a high-ranking but not top male. The complex relationship between rank and reproduction in this species is likely explained by the fact that rhesus macaques queue, rather than fight, for dominance, meaning that the alpha male is not necessarily the strongest or most attractive male.

In rodents, the highest-ranking male frequently sires the most offspring. The same pattern is found in most carnivores, such as the dwarf mongoose. The dwarf mongoose lives in a social system with one dominant pair. The dominant female produces all or almost all of the offspring in the living group, and the dominant male has first access to her during her oestrus period. In red deer, the males who experienced winter dominance, resulting from greater access to preferred foraging sites, had higher ability to get and maintain larger harems during the mating season.

In many monogamous bird species, the dominant pairs tend to get the best territories, which in turn promote offspring survival and adult health. In dunnocks, a species of bird that experiences many mating systems, sometimes individuals will form a group that will have one dominant male who achieves all of the mating in the group.

In the monogynous bee species &quot;Melipona subnitida&quot;, the queen seeks to maintain reproductive success by preventing workers from caring for their cells, pushing or hitting them using her antennae. Workers display aggression towards males, claiming priority over the cells when males try to use them to place eggs.

=== Costs of being dominant ===

There are costs to being of a high rank in a hierarchical group which offset the benefits. The most common costs to high-ranking individuals are higher metabolic rates and higher levels of stress hormones. In great tits and pied flycatchers, high-ranking individuals experience higher resting metabolic rates and therefore need to consume more food in order to maintain fitness and activity levels than do subordinates in their groups. The energetic costs of defending territory, mates, and other resources can be very consuming and cause high-ranking individuals, who spend more time in these activities, to lose body mass over long periods of dominance. Therefore, their physical condition decreases the longer they spend partaking in these high-energy activities, and they lose rank as a function of age.

In wild male baboons, the highest-ranking male, also known as the alpha, experiences high levels of both testosterone and glucocorticoid, which indicates that high-ranking males undergo higher levels of stress which reduces fitness. Reduced health and longevity occurs because these two hormones have immunosuppressant activity, which reduces survival and presents opportunities for parasitic infestation and other health risks. This reduced fitness due to the alpha position results in individuals maintaining high rank for shorter periods of time and having an overall reduced health and longevity from the physical strain and costs of the position.

=== Interpersonal complementarity hypothesis ===
The interpersonal complementarity hypothesis suggests that obedience and authority are reciprocal, complementary processes. That is, it predicts that one group member&#x27;s behaviours will elicit a predictable set of actions from other group members. Friendly behaviours are predicted to be met with friendly behaviours, and hostile behaviours are predicted to be reciprocated with similar, hostile behaviours. When an individual acts in a dominant, authoritative manner in a group, this behaviour tends to prompt submissive responses from other group members. Similarly, when group members display submissive behaviour, others feel inclined to display dominant behaviours in return. Tiedens and Fragale (2003) found that hierarchical differentiation plays a significant role in liking behaviour in groups. Individuals prefer to interact with other group members whose power, or status behaviour complements their own. That is to say, group members who behave submissively when talking to someone who appears to be in control are better liked, and similarly individuals who display dominant behaviours (e.g., taking charge, issuing orders) are more liked when interacting with docile, subservient individuals.

== Subordinance ==

=== Benefits ===

Being subordinate offers a number of benefits. Subordination is beneficial in agonistic conflicts where rank predicts the outcome of a fight. Less injury will occur if subordinate individuals avoid fighting with higher-ranking individuals who would win a large percentage of the time — knowledge of the pecking order keeps both parties from incurring the costs of a prolonged fight. In hens, it has been observed that both dominants and subordinates benefit from a stable hierarchical environment, because fewer challenges means more resources can be dedicated to laying eggs. In groups of highly related individuals, kin selection may influence the stability of hierarchical dominance. A subordinate individual closely related to the dominant individual may benefit more genetically by assisting the dominant individual to pass on their genes.

Alpha male savanna baboons have high levels of testosterone and stress; over a long period of time, this can lead to decreased fitness. The lowest-ranking males also had high stress levels, suggesting that it is the beta males that gain the most fitness, avoiding stress but receiving some of the benefits of moderate rank. The mating tactics of savanna baboons are correlated with their age. Older, subordinate males form alliances to combat higher-ranking males and get access to females.

Fighting with dominant males is a risky behavior that may result in defeat, injury or even death. In bighorn sheep, however, subordinates occasionally win a fight for a female, and they father 44% of the lambs born in the population. These sheep live in large flocks, and dominance hierarchies are often restructured each breeding season.

Burying beetles, which have a social order involving one dominant male controlling most access to mates, display a behavior known as sneak copulation. While one male at a carcass has a 5:1 mating advantage, subordinate males will tempt females away from the carcass with pheromones and attempt to copulate before the dominant male can drive them forcefully away. In flat lizards, young males take advantage of their underdeveloped secondary sex characteristics to engage in sneak copulations. These young males mimic all the visual signs of a female lizard in order to successfully approach a female and copulate without detection by the dominant male. This strategy does not work at close range because the chemical signals given off by the sneaky males reveal their true nature, and they are chased out by the dominant.

=== Costs to subordinates ===

Subordinate individuals suffer a range of costs from dominance hierarchies, one of the most notable being reduced access to food sources. When a resource is obtained, dominant individuals are first to feed as well as taking the longest time. Subordinates also lose out in shelter and nesting sites. Brown hyenas, which display defined linear dominance in both sexes, allow subordinate males and females decreased time of feeding at a carcass. In toque monkeys subordinates are often displaced from feeding sites by dominant males. Additionally, they are excluded from sleeping sites, and they suffer reduced growth and increased mortality.

Subordinate individuals often demonstrate a huge reproductive disadvantage in dominance hierarchies. Among brown hyenas, subordinate females have less opportunity to rear young in the communal den, and thus have fewer surviving offspring than do high-ranking individuals. Subordinate males copulate far less with females than do the high-ranking males. In African wild dogs which live in social packs separated into male and female hierarchies, top-ranking alpha females have been observed to produce 76–81% of all litters.

=== Mitigating the costs ===

Subordinate animals engage in a number of behaviors in order to outweigh the costs of low rank. Dispersal is often associated with increased mortality and subordination may decrease the potential benefits of leaving the group. In the red fox it has been shown that subordinate individuals, given the opportunity to desert, often do not due to the risk of death and the low possibility that they would establish themselves as dominant members in a new group.

== Conflict over dominance ==

Animal decisions regarding involvement in conflict are defined by the interplay between the costs and benefits of agonistic behaviors. When initially developed, game theory, the study of optimal strategies during pair-wise conflict, was grounded in the false assumption that animals engaged in conflict were of equal fighting ability. Modifications, however, have provided increased focus on the differences between the fighting capabilities of animals and raised questions about their evolutionary development. These differences are believed to determine the outcomes of fights, their intensity, and animal decisions to submit or continue fighting. The influence of aggression, threats, and fighting on the strategies of individuals engaged in conflict has proven integral to establishing social hierarchies reflective of dominant-subordinate interactions.

The asymmetries between individuals have been categorized into three types of interactions:

# Resource-holding potential: Animals that are better able to defend resources often win without much physical contact.
# Resource value: Animals more invested in a resource are likely to invest more in the fight despite potential for incurring higher costs.
# Intruder retreats: When participants are of equal fighting ability and competing for a certain territory, the resident of the territory is likely to end as the victor because he values the territory more. This can be explained further by looking at the example of the common shrews. If one participant believes he is the resident of the territory, he will win when the opponent is weaker or food is scarce. However, if both shrews believe they are the true territory holder, the one with the greater need for food, and therefore, the one that values the resource more, is most likely to win.

As expected, the individual who emerges triumphant is rewarded with the dominant status, having demonstrated their physical superiority. However, the costs incurred to the defeated, which include loss of reproductive opportunities and quality food, can hinder the individual&#x27;s fitness. In order to minimize these losses, animals generally retreat from fighting or displaying fighting ability unless there are obvious cues indicating victory. These often involve characteristics that provide an advantage during agonistic behavior, such as size of body, displays, etc. Red stags, for example, engage in exhausting roaring contests to exhibit their strength. However, such an activity would impose more costs than benefits for unfit stags, and compel them to retreat from the contest. Larger stags have also been known to make lower-frequency threat signals, acting as indicators of body size, strength, and dominance.

Engaging in agonistic behavior can be very costly and thus there are many examples in nature of animals who achieve dominance in more passive ways. In some, the dominance status of an individual is clearly visible, eliminating the need for agonistic behavior. In wintering bird flocks, white-crowned sparrows display a unique white plumage; the higher the percentage of the crown that consists of white feathers, the higher the status of the individual. For other animals, the time spent in the group serves as a determinant of dominance status. Rank may also be acquired from maternal dominance rank. In rhesus monkeys, offspring gain dominance status based on the rank of the mother—the higher ranked the mother, the higher ranked the offspring will be (Yahner). Similarly, the status of a male Canada goose is determined by the rank of his family. Although dominance is determined differently in each case, it is influenced by the relationships between members of social groups.

== Regulation mechanisms ==

Individuals with greater hierarchical status tend to displace those ranked lower from access to space, to food and to mating opportunities. Thus, individuals with higher social status tend to have greater reproductive success by mating more often and having more resources to invest in the survival of offspring. Hence, hierarchy serves as an intrinsic factor for population control, ensuring adequate resources for the dominant individuals and thus preventing widespread starvation. Territorial behavior enhances this effect.

=== In eusocial animals ===

The suppression of reproduction by dominant individuals is the most common mechanism that maintains the hierarchy. In eusocial mammals this is mainly achieved by aggressive interactions between the potential reproductive females. In eusocial insects, aggressive interactions are common determinants of reproductive status, such as in the bumblebee &quot;Bombus bifarius&quot;, the paper wasp &quot;Polistes annularis&quot; and in the ants &quot;Dinoponera australis&quot; and &quot;D. quadriceps&quot;. In general, aggressive interactions are ritualistic and involve antennation (drumming), abdomen curling and very rarely mandible bouts and stinging. The winner of the interaction may walk over the subordinated, that in turn assumes a prostrated posture. To be effective, these regulatory mechanisms must include traits that make an individual rank position readily recognizable by its nestmates. The composition of the lipid layer on the cuticle of social insects is the clue used by nestmates to recognize each other in the colony, and to discover each insect&#x27;s reproductive status (and rank). Visual cues may also transmit the same information. Paper wasps &quot;Polistes dominulus&quot; have individual &quot;facial badges&quot; that permit them to recognize each other and to identify the status of each individual. Individuals whose badges were modified by painting were aggressively treated by their nestmates; this makes advertising a false ranking status costly, and may help to suppress such advertising.

Other behaviors are involved in maintaining reproductive status in social insects. The removal of a thoracic sclerite in &quot;Diacamma&quot; ants inhibits ovary development; the only reproductive individual of this naturally queenless genus is the one that retains its sclerite intact. This individual is called a gamergate, and is responsible for mutilating all the newly emerged females, to maintain its social status. Gamergates of &quot;Harpegnathos saltator&quot; arise from aggressive interactions, forming a hierarchy of potential reproductives.

In the honey bee &quot;Apis mellifera&quot;, a pheromone produced by the queen mandibular glands is responsible for inhibiting ovary development in the worker caste. &quot;Worker policing&quot; is an additional mechanism that prevents reproduction by workers, found in bees and ants. Policing may involve oophagy and immobilization of workers who lay eggs. In some ant species such as the carpenter ant &quot;Camponotus floridanus&quot;, eggs from queens have a peculiar chemical profile that workers can distinguish from worker laid eggs. When worker-laid eggs are found, they are eaten. In some species, such as &quot;Pachycondyla obscuricornis&quot;, workers may try to escape policing by shuffling their eggs within the egg pile laid by the queen.

=== Hormonal control ===

Modulation of hormone levels after hibernation may be associated with dominance hierarchies in the social order of the paper wasp (&quot;Polistes dominulus&quot;). This depends on the queen (or foundress), possibly involving specific hormones. Laboratory experiments have shown that when foundresses are injected with juvenile hormone, responsible for regulating growth and development in insects including wasps, the foundresses exhibit an increase in dominance. Further, foundresses with larger corpora allata, a region of the female wasp brain responsible for the synthesis and secretion of juvenile hormone, are naturally more dominant.
A follow-up experiment utilized 20-hydroxyecdysone, an ecdysone known to enhance maturation and size of oocytes. The size of the oocytes plays a significant role in establishing dominance in the paper wasp. Foundresses treated with 20-hydroxyecdysone showed more dominance than did those treated with juvenile hormone, so 20-hydroxyecdysone may play a larger role in establishing dominance (Roseler &quot;et al.&quot;, 1984). Subsequent research however, suggests that juvenile hormone is implicated, though only on certain individuals. When injected with juvenile hormone, larger foundresses showed more mounting behaviors than smaller ones, and more oocytes in their ovaries.

Naked mole-rats (&quot;Heterocephalus glaber&quot;) similarly have a dominance hierarchy dependent on the highest ranking female (queen) and her ability to suppress critically important reproductive hormones in male and female sub-dominants. In sub-dominant males, it appears that luteinizing hormone and testosterone are suppressed, while in females it appears that the suppression involves the entire suppression of the ovarian cycle. This suppression reduces sexual virility and behavior and thus redirects the sub-dominant&#x27;s behavior into helping the queen with her offspring, though the mechanisms of how this is accomplished are debated. Former research suggests that pheromones secreted by the queen cause direct suppression of these vital reproductive hormones and functions however current evidence suggests that it is not the secretion of pheromones which act to suppress reproductive function but rather the queen&#x27;s extremely high levels of circulating testosterone, which cause her to exert intense dominance and aggressiveness on the colony and thus &quot;scare&quot; the other mole-rats into submission. Research has shown that removal of the queen from the colony allows the reestablishment of reproductive function in sub-dominant individuals. To see if a priming pheromone secreted by the queen was indeed causing reproductive suppression, researchers removed the queen from the colony but did not remove her bedding. They reasoned that if a primer pheromones were on the bedding then the sub-dominant&#x27;s reproductive function should continue to be suppressed. Instead however, they found that the sub-dominants quickly regained reproductive function even in the presence of the queen&#x27;s bedding and thus it was concluded that primer pheromones do not seem to play a role in suppressing reproductive function.

Glucocorticoids, signaling molecules which stimulate the fight or flight response, may be implicated in dominance hierarchies. Higher ranking individuals tend to have much higher levels of circulating glucocorticoids than subdominant individuals, the opposite of what had been expected. Two core hypotheses attempt to explain this.
The first suggests that higher ranking individuals exert more energy and thus need higher levels of glucocorticoids to mobilize glycogen for energy use. This is supported by the fact that when food availability is low, cortisol levels increase within the dominant male. The second suggests that elevated stress hormones are a result of social factors, particularly when the hierarchy is in transition, perhaps resulting in increased aggression and confrontation. As a result, the dominant individual fights more and has elevated glucocorticoids during this period. Field studies of olive baboons in Kenya seem to support this, as dominant individuals had lower cortisol levels in a stable hierarchy than did subdominant individuals, but the reverse was true at unstable times.

=== Brain pathways and hierarchy ===

Several areas of the brain contribute to hierarchical behavior in animals. One of the areas that has been linked with this behavior is the prefrontal cortex, a region involved with decision making and social behavior. High social rank in a hierarchical group of mice has been associated with increased excitability in the medial prefrontal cortex of pyramidal neurons, the primary excitatory cell type of the brain. High ranking macaques have a larger rostral prefrontal cortex in large social groups. Neuroimaging studies with computer stimulated hierarchal conditions showed increased activity in the ventral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, one processing judgment cues and the other processing status of an individual. Other studies have determined that lesions to the prefrontal cortex (when the area is severed to disrupt functioning to observe its role in behavior) led to deficits in processing social hierarchy cues, suggesting this area is important in regulating this information. Although the prefrontal cortex has been implicated, there are other downstream targets of the prefrontal cortex that have also been linked in maintaining this behavior. This includes the amygdala through lesion studies in rats and primates which led to disruption in hierarchy, and can affect the individual negatively or positively depending on the subnuclei that is targeted. Additionally, the dorsal medial PFC-medial dorsal thalamus connection has been linked with maintenance of rank in mice. Another area that has been associated is the dorsal raphe nucleus, the primary serotonergic nuclei (a neurotransmitter involved with many behaviors including reward and learning). In manipulation studies of this region, there were changes in fighting and affiliative behavior in primates and crustaceans.

== In specific groups ==
=== Female dominance in mammals ===

Female-biased dominance occurs rarely in mammals. It occurs when all adult males exhibit submissive behavior to adult females in social settings. These social settings are usually related to feeding, grooming, and sleeping site priority. It is observed consistently in hyenas, lemurs and the bonobo. The ring-tailed lemur is observed to be the most prominent model of female dominance.

There are three basic proposals for the evolution of female dominance:

# The Energy Conservation Hypothesis: males subordinate to females to conserve energy for intense male-male competition experienced during very short breeding seasons
# Female behavioral strategy: dominance helps females deal with the unusually high reproductive demands; they prevail in more social conflicts because they have more at stake in terms of fitness.
# Male behavioral strategy: males defer as a parental investment because it ensures more resources in a harsh unpredictable climate for the female, and thus, the male&#x27;s future offspring.

In lemurs, no single hypothesis fully explains female social dominance at this time and all three are likely to play a role. Adult female lemurs have increased concentrations of androgens when they transition from non-breeding to breeding seasons, increasing female aggression. Androgens are greater in pregnant female lemurs, which suggests that organizational androgens might influence the developing offspring. Organizational androgens play a role in &quot;explaining female social dominance&quot; in ring-tailed lemurs, as androgens are associated with aggressive behavior in young females. Females that were &quot;exposed to greater concentrations of maternal [androstenedione] late in fetal development were less likely to be aggressed against postnatally, whereas females that were...exposed to greater concentrations of maternal [testosterone]...were more likely to receive aggression postnatally&quot;. Dominance rank in female chimpanzees is correlated with reproductive success. Although a high rank is an advantage for females, clear linear hierarchies in female chimpanzees have not been detected. In &quot;masculinized&quot; female mammals like the spotted hyena (&quot;Crocuta crocuta&quot;), androgens (i.e. specifically, androstenedione and testosterone) are &quot;implicated in the organization and activation of...nonreproductive behavioral traits, including aggression, social dominance, rough-and-tumble play, and scent marking&quot;. For aggressively dominant female meerkats (&quot;Suricata suricatta&quot;), they have &quot;exceptionally high concentrations&quot; of androgens, &quot;particularly during gestation&quot;.

=== Birds ===

The concept of dominance, originally called &quot;pecking order&quot;, was described in birds by Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 under the German terms &quot;Hackordnung&quot; or &quot;Hackliste&quot; and introduced into English in 1927. In his 1924 German-language article, he noted that &quot;defense and aggression in the hen is accomplished with the beak&quot;. This emphasis on pecking led many subsequent studies on fowl behaviour to use it as a primary observation; however, it has been noted that roosters tend to leap and use their claws in conflicts.

Wild and feral chickens form relatively small groups, usually including no more than 10 to 20 individuals. It has been shown that in larger groups, which is common in farming, the dominance hierarchy becomes less stable and aggression increases.

Dominance hierarchies are found in many species of bird. For example, the blue-footed booby brood of two chicks always has a dominance hierarchy due to the asynchronous hatching of the eggs. One egg is laid four days before the other, and incubation starts immediately after laying, so the elder chick is hatched four days before the younger chick and has a four-day head start on growth. The elder, stronger chick almost always becomes the dominant chick. During times of food shortage, the dominant chick often kills the subordinate chick by either repeatedly pecking or by ousting the younger chick from the nest. The brood hierarchy makes it easier for the subordinate chick to die quietly in times of food scarcity, which provides an efficient system for booby parents to maximize their investment.

===Eusocial insects===

In insect societies, only one to few individuals members of a colony can reproduce, whereas the other colony members have their reproductive capabilities suppressed. This conflict over reproduction in some cases results in a dominance hierarchy. Dominant individuals in this case are known as queens and have the obvious advantage of performing reproduction and benefiting from all the tasks performed by their subordinates, the worker caste (foraging, nest maintenance, nest defense, brood care and thermal regulation). According to Hamilton&#x27;s rule, the reproduction costs of the worker caste are compensated by the contribution of workers to the queen&#x27;s reproductive success, with which they share genes. This is true not only for the popular social insects (ants, termites, some bees and wasps), but also for the naked mole-rat &quot;Heterocephalus glaber&quot;. In a laboratory experiment, Clarke and Faulkes (1997) demonstrated that reproductive status in a colony of &quot;H. glaber&quot; was correlated with the individual&#x27;s ranking position within a dominance hierarchy, but aggression between potential reproductives only started after the queen was removed.

The social insects mentioned above, excluding termites, are haplodiploid. Queen and workers are diploid, but males develop from haploid genotypes. In some species, suppression of ovary development is not totally achieved in the worker caste, which opens the possibility of reproduction by workers. Since nuptial flights are seasonal and workers are wingless, workers are almost always non-breeders, and (as gamergate ants or laying worker bees) can only lay unfertilised eggs. These eggs are in general viable, developing into males. A worker that performs reproduction is considered a &quot;cheater&quot; within the colony, because it leaves disproportionately more descendants than do its sisters and mother. The advantage of remaining functionally sterile is only accomplished if every worker assume this &quot;compromise&quot;. When one or more workers start reproducing, the &quot;social contract&quot; is destroyed and the colony cohesion is dissolved. Aggressive behavior derived from this conflict may result in the formation of hierarchies, and attempts of reproduction by workers are actively suppressed. In some wasps, such as &quot;Polistes fuscatus&quot;, instead of not laying eggs, the female workers begin being able to reproduce, but once being under the presence of dominant females, the subordinate female workers can no longer reproduce.

In some wasp species such as Liostenogaster flavolineata there are many possible queens that inhabit a nest, but only one can be queen at a time. When a queen dies the next queen is selected by an age-based dominance hierarchy. This is also true in the species &quot;Polistes instabilis&quot;, where the next queen is selected based on age rather than size. &quot;Polistes exclamans&quot; also exhibits this type of hierarchy. Within the dominance hierarchies of the &quot;Polistes versicolor&quot;, however, the dominant-subordinate context in the yellow paper wasps is directly related to the exchange of food. Future foundresses within the nest compete over the shared resources of nourishment, such as protein. Unequal nourishment is often what leads to the size differences that result in dominant-subordinate position rankings. Therefore, if during the winter aggregate, the female is able to obtain greater access to food, the female could thus reach a dominant position.

In some species, especially in ants, more than one queen can be found in the same colony, a condition called polygyny. In this case, another advantage of maintaining a hierarchy is to prolong the colony lifespan. The top ranked individuals may die or lose fertility and &quot;extra queens&quot; may benefit from starting a colony in the same site or nest. This advantage is critical in some ecological contexts, such as in situations where nesting sites are limited or dispersal of individuals is risky due to high rates of predation. This polygynous behavior has also been observed in some eusocial bees such as &quot;Schwarziana quadripunctata&quot;. In this species, multiple queens of varying sizes are present. The larger, physogastric, queens typically control the nest, though a &quot;dwarf&quot; queen will take its place in the case of a premature death.

== Variations ==

=== Spectrum of social systems ===

Dominance hierarchies emerge as a result of intersexual and intrasexual selection within groups, where competition between individuals results in differential access to resources and mating opportunities. This can be mapped across a spectrum of social organization ranging from egalitarian to despotic, varying across multiple dimensions of cooperation and competition in between. Conflict can be resolved in multiple ways, including aggression, tolerance, and avoidance. These are produced by social decision-making, described in the &quot;relational model&quot; created by the zoologist Frans De Waal. In systems where competition between and within the sexes is low, social behaviour gravitates towards tolerance and egalitarianism, such as that found in woolley spider monkeys. In despotic systems where competition is high, one or two members are dominant while all other members of the living group are equally submissive, as seen in Japanese and rhesus macaques, leopard geckos, dwarf hamsters, gorillas, the cichlid &quot;Neolamprologus pulcher&quot;, and African wild dog. Linear ranking systems, or &quot;pecking orders&quot;, which tend to fall in between egalitarianism and despotism, follow a structure where every member of the group is recognized as either dominant or submissive relative to every other member. This results in a linear distribution of rank, as seen in spotted hyenas and brown hyenas.

=== Context dependency ===

Dominance and its organisation can be highly variable depending on the context or individuals involved. In European badgers, dominance relationships may vary with time as individuals age, gain or lose social status, or change their reproductive condition. Dominance may also vary across space in territorial animals as territory owners are often dominant over all others in their own territory but submissive elsewhere, or dependent on the resource. Even with these factors held constant, perfect dominance hierarchies are rarely found in groups of any great size, at least in the wild. Dominance hierarchies in small herds of domestic horses are generally linear hierarchies whereas in large herds the relationships are triangular. Dominance hierarchies can be formed at a very early age. Domestic piglets are highly precocious and, within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, will attempt to suckle. The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the anterior teats produce a greater quantity of milk. Once established, this teat order remains stable with each piglet tending to feed from a particular teat or group of teats. Dominance–subordination relationships can vary markedly between breeds of the same species. Studies on Merinos and Border Leicesters sheep revealed an almost linear hierarchy in the Merinos but a less rigid structure in the Border Leicesters when a competitive feeding situation was created.

=== Species with egalitarian/non-linear hierarchies ===

Although many group-living animal species have a hierarchy of some form, some species have more fluid and flexible social groupings, where rank does not need to be rigidly enforced, and low-ranking group members may enjoy a wider degree of social flexibility. Some animal societies are &quot;democratic&quot;, with low-ranking group members being able to influence which group member is leader and which one is not. Sometimes dominant animals must maintain alliances with subordinates and grant them favours to receive their support in order to retain their dominant rank. In chimpanzees, the alpha male may need to tolerate lower-ranking group members hovering near fertile females or taking portions of his meals. Other examples can include Muriqui monkeys. Within their groups, there is abundant food and females will mate promiscuously. Because of this, males gain very little in fighting over females, who are, in turn, too large and strong for males to monopolize or control, so males do not appear to form especially prominent ranks between them, with several males mating with the same female in view of each other. This type of mating style is also present in manatees, removing their need to engage in serious fighting. Among female elephants, leadership roles are not acquired by sheer brute force, but instead through seniority, and other females can collectively show preferences for where the herd can travel. In hamadryas baboons, several high-ranking males will share a similar rank, with no single male being an absolute leader. Female bats also have a somewhat fluid social structure, in which rank is not strongly enforced. Bonobos are matriarchal, yet their social groups are also generally quite flexible, and serious aggression is quite rare between them. In olive baboons, certain animals are dominant in certain contexts, but not in others. Prime age male olive baboons claim feeding priority, yet baboons of any age or sex can initiate and govern the group&#x27;s collective movements.

<text>M. Thomas Inge (March 18, 1936 – May 15, 2021)

 was an American academic. He was the Robert Emory Blackwell Professor of Humanities at Randolph–Macon College in Ashland, Virginia, where he taught, edited, and wrote about Southern literature and culture, American humor and comic art, film and animation, Asian literature, and William Faulkner.

==Early life==
A native of Newport News, Virginia, he received his B.A. degree in English and Spanish from Randolph-Macon in 1959 and his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Vanderbilt University in 1960 and 1964 respectively.

==Career==
Inge taught at Michigan State University and then chaired the English departments at Virginia Commonwealth University and Clemson University.

As a senior Fulbright Lecturer, Inge taught at the University of Salamanca in Spain (1967–68), at three institutions in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1971), at Moscow State University in the former Soviet Union (1979), and at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic (1994). As Resident Scholar in American Studies with the US Information Agency, a part of the State Department, he lectured and did diplomatic work in eighteen countries from 1982 to 1984, earning a commendation for distinguished work in the Soviet Union.

Inge authored or edited over sixty books and has been a pioneer in the development of popular culture as a legitimate field of academic study. He was one of the founders of the Popular Culture Association. His three-volume &quot;Handbook of American Popular Culture&quot; was cited by the American Library Association as an outstanding reference work in 1979 and has been issued in revised and expanded editions in 1989 and 2002. Publications include &quot;William Faulkner: Overlook Illustrated Lives&quot; (2006), &quot;The Incredible Mr. Poe: Comic Book Adaptations of the Works of Edgar Allan Poe&quot; (2008), &quot;New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture, Volume 9: Literature&quot; (2008), &quot;My Life with Charlie Brown by Charles M. Schulz&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Dixie Limited: Writers on Faulkner and His Influence&quot; (spring 2016). The Society for the Study of Southern Literature gave him the Richard Beale Davis Award for Lifetime Contributions to Southern Letters in 2008. He founded the journal, &quot;Resources for American Literary Study&quot;, in 1971 and the Southern Studies Forum of the European Association for American Studies in 1995.

Inge was also one of the founders of the American Humor Studies Association and served for four years as Editor of its journal, &quot;Studies in American Humor&quot;. His work on humor includes editions of &quot;Sut Lovingood’s Yarns&quot; by Tennessee humorist George Washington Harris (1966, 1967, 1987), the Oxford World Classics edition of Mark Twain’s &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court&quot; (1997), and with Ed Piacentino, &quot;Southern Frontier Humor: An Anthology&quot; (2010). Some of his numerous essays on American humor have been collected in his books &quot;Comics as Culture&quot; (1990), &quot;The Frontier Humorists: Critical Views&quot; (1975), and &quot;Perspectives on American Culture: Essays on Humor, Literature, and the Popular Arts&quot; (1994).

==The M. Thomas Inge Papers==
The M. Thomas Inge Papers (in the Comic Arts Collection at Virginia Commonwealth University) includes magazines, catalogs, fanzines, programs and humor publications. This collection is composed of materials collected by Dr. Inge relating to his academic studies of the comic arts, popular culture, and American literature. The bulk of the collection is dated from the 1950s onward and is made up of many items collected by Inge covering the history of the comic arts. It includes a large collection of published and unpublished materials and ephemera items relating to the comic arts. Manuscripts by Inge and other writers are also included.

The collection contains correspondence with a number of noted artists and writers, including Art Spiegelman, Mort Walker, Bruce Duncan, and Harold Foster, and comic arts scholars. The collection includes advertisements, fan club materials, posters, art prints, animation cells, comic strip and comic book samples, comic and animation character drinking glasses, numerous buttons, records, and various other collectable items.

The collection is highlighted by a very large collection of reference journals including fanzines, newsletters, journals, and numerous other periodicals related to the comic arts. These periodical titles focus on the history and art of comic books and comic strips, cartoonists, comic book and comic strip characters, animation, and other aspects of the comic arts and popular culture. These materials, and the hundreds of comic books and reference books donated by Dr. Inge, have been incorporated into their own individual collections.

<doc id="1096699" wikidata="Q4555039" url="?curid=1096699" title="1860 Democratic National Conventions">
<text>The 1860 Democratic National Conventions were a series of presidential nominating conventions held to nominate the Democratic Party&#x27;s candidates for president and vice president in the 1860 election.

The first convention, held from April 23 to May 3 in Charleston, South Carolina, deadlocked after failing to nominate a ticket: two subsequent conventions, both held in Baltimore, Maryland in June, ultimately nominated separate presidential tickets.

Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois entered the Charleston convention as the front-runner for the presidential nomination, and while he won a majority on the first presidential ballot of the convention, convention rules at the time required a two-thirds majority to win the nomination, with Douglas&#x27; adherence to the Freeport Doctrine regarding slavery in the territories engendering strong opposition from many Southern delegates: opponents of Douglas&#x27;s nomination spread their support among five major candidates, including former Treasury Secretary James Guthrie of Kentucky and Senator Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia.

After 57 ballots over a span of two days, in which Douglas consistently won at least half of the delegates, the Charleston convention adjourned when it became apparent no candidate could secure the required two-thirds of all votes.

The Democratic convention reconvened in Baltimore on June 18, but many Southern delegates were either excluded from the convention or refused to participate. The convention adopted a platform in which it pledged to abide by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States upon questions of Constitutional Law regarding slavery.

Douglas was ultimately nominated for president on the second ballot (the 59th ballot overall). Senator Benjamin Fitzpatrick of Alabama was nominated for vice president, but he refused the nomination, and was replaced by former Governor Herschel V. Johnson of Georgia.

The Southern Democrats who had boycotted, or walked out of, the Baltimore convention held their own separate convention and adopted a pro-slavery platform, and nominated incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge for president, with Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon as vice president.

While Douglas and Breckinridge received a combined 47.62% of the popular vote in the 1860 presidential election, they lost the election to Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln.

== Charleston convention ==

=== Background ===
The front-runner for the nomination was Douglas, who was considered a moderate on the slavery issue. With the 1854 Kansas–Nebraska Act, he advanced the doctrine of popular sovereignty: allowing settlers in each Territory to decide for themselves whether slavery would be allowed—a change from the flat prohibition of slavery in most Territories under the Missouri Compromise, which the South had welcomed. However, the Supreme Court’s ensuing 1857 &#x27;Dred Scott&#x27; decision declared that the Constitution protected slavery in all Territories.

Douglas was challenged for his Senate seat by Abraham Lincoln in 1858, and narrowly won re-election, after the Lincoln-Douglas debates, by professing the Freeport Doctrine, a &quot;de facto&quot; rejection of &quot;Dred Scott&quot;, with militant Southern &quot;Fire-Eaters&quot;, such as William Yancey of Alabama, opposing him as a traitor. Many of them openly predicted a split in the party and the election of Republican front-runner William H. Seward.

The 1860 Democratic National Convention convened at South Carolina Institute Hall (destroyed in the Great Fire of 1861) in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 23, 1860: the galleries at the convention were packed with pro-slavery spectators.

=== Party platform disputes ===
Urged by Yancey, the delegations from seven Deep South states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) met in a separate caucus before the convention. They reached a tentative consensus to &quot;stop Douglas&quot; by imposing a pro-slavery party platform which he could not run on if nominated.

The &quot;Fire-eater&quot; majority on the convention&#x27;s platform committee, chaired by William Waightstill Avery of North Carolina, produced an explicitly pro-slavery document, endorsing &quot;Dred Scott&quot; and Congressional legislation protecting slavery in the territories. Northern Democrats refused to acquiesce, as &quot;Dred Scott&quot; was extremely unpopular in the North, and the Northerners said they could not carry a single state with that platform: this would end any Democratic prospect of retaining the White House, as no previous candidate had won the presidency without winning either New York or Pennsylvania, and only four (John Adams in 1796, James Madison in 1812, John Quincy Adams in 1824, and James Buchanan in 1856) had been elected without winning both. Douglas and supporters thus preferred the 1856 Cincinnati platform.

On April 30, the minority (Northern) report was substituted for that of the majority (Southern) report by a vote of 165 to 138. The question next in order before the convention was upon the adoption of the second resolution of the minority of the committee: on this question Alabama, Arkansas, one of Delaware&#x27;s delegates, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas refused to vote. The Douglas party abandoned the vague second resolution, and it was defeated by an overwhelming vote of 238 to 21 (with 44 abstentions).

Between April 30 and May 1, 51 Southern delegates walked out of the convention in protest: the entire delegations of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas, three of the four delegates from Arkansas and one of the three delegates from Delaware. These delegates gathered at St. Andrews Hall on Broad Street and declared themselves the real convention as the Institute Hall convention proceeded to nominations.

Since both the majority and the minority resolutions on the Territorial question were rejected, nothing remained except the Cincinnati platform as the Douglas faction had desired. The dominant Douglas forces believed their path was now clear.

=== Two-thirds rule ===
Before the balloting for president commenced, Mr. Howard of Tennessee succeeded in obtaining a vote of the convention in affirmance of the two-thirds rule: on his motion they resolved, by 141 votes to 112, &quot;that the President of the Convention be and he is hereby directed not to declare any person nominated for the office of President or Vice President unless he shall have received a number of votes equal to two-thirds of the votes of all the Electoral Colleges.&quot;

It was well known at the time that this resolution would render the regular nomination of Douglas impossible.

=== Presidential balloting ===
Six major candidates were nominated at the convention: Douglas, former Treasury Secretary James Guthrie of Kentucky, Senator Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia, Senator Joseph Lane of Oregon, former Senator Daniel S. Dickinson of New York, and Senator Andrew Johnson of Tennessee.

==== Presidential candidates ====
While Douglas led on the first ballot, receiving of the 253 votes cast, the convention had required a two-thirds vote to win the nomination: further to this, convention chairman Caleb Cushing ruled that this was two-thirds of &quot;the whole membership&quot;, not two-thirds of those &quot;present and voting&quot;.

This ruling meant Douglas needed 202 votes ( more votes), or 80% of the remaining 253 delegates: this was all but impossible as it would have required several of the remaining Southern delegates to vote for Douglas, who they vehemently opposed.

Consequently, the convention held 57 ballots, and though Douglas led on all of them, he never received more than votes. On the 57th ballot, Douglas received votes, still votes short of the nomination, though far ahead of Guthrie, who was second with . On 3 May, the delegates voted to adjourn the convention, and reconvene in Baltimore six weeks later.

A few votes went to former Senator Isaac Toucey of Connecticut and Senator James Pearce of Maryland, while Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi (the future Confederate President) received one vote on over fifty ballots from Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts. Ironically, during the Civil War, Butler became a Union general, and Davis ordered him hanged as a criminal if he was captured.


1st Day of Presidential Balloting / 8th Day of Convention (May 1, 1860)
2nd Day of Presidential Balloting / 9th Day of Convention (May 2, 1860)
== Baltimore convention (Northern Democratic) ==
The Democrats re-convened at the Front Street Theater (destroyed in the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904) in Baltimore, Maryland, on 18 June.

=== Delegate re-admission disagreement ===
The resumed convention&#x27;s first business was to decide whether to re-admit the delegates who had walked out of the Charleston session, or to seat replacement delegates who had been named by pro-Douglas Democrats in some states: other delegates had boycotted the Baltimore convention.

The credentials committee&#x27;s majority report recommended re-admitting all delegates except those from Louisiana and Alabama, while the minority report recommended re-admitting some of the Louisiana and Alabama delegates as well. On June 22, the minority (Southern) report failed to be substituted for that of the majority (Northern) report by a vote of -150.

After the rejection of the minority report, two votes were taken on the reconsideration of the substitution vote. At first, New York revived hopes of adopting the minority report by voting for its reconsideration. But during the second vote on reconsideration, New York switched back to its original vote.

With the admission of the new Louisiana and Alabama delegates, 56 delegates - most of those remaining from the South, and a scattering of delegates from northern and far western states - all walked out of the convention in protest.

=== Presidential balloting ===
After the convention resumed voting on a nominee, Douglas received of the votes cast on the first ballot (the 58th overall), and votes of the votes cast on the second ballot (the 59th overall).

A rollcall was taken following the second ballot, and it was realized that there were only delegates present, meaning that there were insufficient delegates for Douglas to receive the 202 votes required by Cushing&#x27;s ruling at the first convention.

After the delegates unanimously voted to rescind that ruling, it was declared by acclamation that Douglas had received the required two-thirds of the votes cast, and he was therefore nominated.

==== Presidential candidates ====
==== Declined ====


=== Vice-presidential balloting ===
Senator Benjamin Fitzpatrick of Alabama was the only candidate for the vice-presidential nomination.

During the call of the states, every vote recorded was in favor of Fitzpatrick with no exception until Pennsylvania was reached. One of Pennsylvania&#x27;s votes was announced for former state senator William C. Alexander of New Jersey. Upon this announcement, a New Jersey delegate informed the delegates that he had been authorized before the convention, by Alexander himself, not to allow his name to be presented as a candidate. The Pennsylvanian who desired Alexander cast one blank vote thereafter.

==== Vice-presidential candidate ====


=== Vice-presidential replacement ===
After the unanimous nomination of Fitzpatrick as the candidate for vice president, the convention adjourned on June 23, the sixth and last day of its session. On the same day, but after the adjournment, Fitzpatrick declined the nomination. Fitzpatrick&#x27;s refusal of the vice-presidential nomination occurred sixteen years after Silas Wright was the first to turndown the honor. In 1924, Frank Lowden would be the third and last person to date who refused their party&#x27;s vice-presidential nomination.

==== Vice-presidential candidate ====

Since the convention had already adjourned, the executive committee was required to name a replacement for Fitzpatrick.

On motion of Mr. Dick, the lone remaining delegate from North Carolina, the vice-presidential nomination was conferred on former Senator and Governor Herschel V. Johnson of Georgia by acclamation.

== Baltimore convention (Southern Democratic) ==

A second convention assembled at Baltimore on June 23, 1860. It was composed chiefly of the delegates who had walked out of or boycotted the Northern Democratic convention.

One of their first acts was to abrogate the two-thirds rule, as had been done by the Douglas convention: both conventions acted under the same necessity, since there were insufficient delegates remaining to allow the preservation of this rule at either convention.

The majority resolutions, whose replacement by the minority report facilitated the collapse of the Charleston convention, were reported and adopted unanimously, amid great applause.

=== Presidential balloting ===
After the adoption of the majority resolutions, the convention proceeded to select their candidates. Four names were placed in nomination: Breckinridge, Dickinson, Hunter, and Lane.

==== Presidential candidates ====
Despite instructions from their state convention, the Mississippi delegation, with Jefferson Davis&#x27; concurrence, desired that his name be removed from possible consideration for the sake of harmony. The names of Hunter and Lane were subsequently withdrawn in the spirit of harmony and unanimity. After New York cast an obligatory vote for Dickinson, Breckinridge was declared the unanimous choice of the convention for president.


=== Vice-presidential balloting ===
After the applause for Breckinridge&#x27;s nomination had subsided, the whole hall resounded with cries for Yancey for Vice President. After Yancey got on his feet, but before he could speak, Lane&#x27;s name was presented and seconded.

No other names being presented for the office, the states were called and voted unanimously for Lane.

==== Vice-presidential candidates ====



== Consequences ==
After the break-up of the Charleston convention, many of those present stated that the Republicans were now certain to win the 1860 Presidential election.

In the general election, the actual division in Democratic popular votes did not directly affect any state outcomes except California, Oregon, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. Of these states, only California and Oregon were free states, and although both were carried by Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln they combined for only seven of Lincoln&#x27;s 180 electoral votes. The latter three states were slave states that were carried by neither Douglas, Breckinridge nor Lincoln but by John Bell, nominee of the Constitutional Union Party. Composed mainly of former Whigs and Know-Nothings, the Constitutional Union Party attempted to ignore the slavery issue in favor of preserving the Union.

Even if California, Oregon and every state carried by Douglas, Breckinridge or Bell had been carried by a single presidential nominee, Lincoln would still have had a large majority of electoral votes. However, the split in the Democratic Party organization was a serious handicap in many states, especially Pennsylvania, and almost certainly reduced the aggregate Democratic popular vote. Pennsylvania&#x27;s 27 electoral votes were especially decisive in ensuring a Republican victory – had Lincoln failed to carry that state combined with any other free state, he could not have obtained a majority of electoral votes, forcing a contingent election in the House of Representatives.

James M. McPherson suggested in &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; that the “Fire-eater” program of breaking up the convention and running a rival ticket was deliberately intended to bring about the election of a Republican as president, and thus trigger secession declarations by the slave-owning states. Whatever the “intent” of the fire-eaters may have been, doubtless many of them favored secession, and the logical, probable, and actual consequence of their actions was to fragment the Democratic party and thereby virtually ensure a Republican victory.

<text>Aviculture is the practice of keeping and breeding birds, especially of wild birds in captivity.

==Aviculture==

Aviculture is the practice of keeping birds (class &quot;Aves&quot;) in captivity using controlled conditions, normally within the confines of an aviary, for hobby, business, research and conservation purposes. Some reasons for aviculture are: breeding birds to preserve the species because many avian species are at risk due to habitat destruction and natural disaster. Aviculture encourages conservation, provides education about avian species, provides companion birds for the public, and includes research on avian behaviour.

==Avicultural societies==

In the UK, the Avicultural Society was formed in 1894 and the Foreign Bird League in 1932. In 1973 Aviornis was created, a bird-breeding association present in several European countries.

The oldest avicultural society in the United States is the Avicultural Society of America, founded in 1927. The ASA produces a bi-monthly magazine, &quot;ASA Avicultural Bulletin&quot;. The ASA is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that focuses on breeding, conservation, restoration and education.

The first avicultural society in Australia was The Avicultural Society of South Australia, founded in 1928. It is now promoted with the name Bird Keeping in Australia. The two major national avicultural societies in the United States are the American Federation of Aviculture and the Avicultural Society of America, founded in 1927. The Budgerigar Society was formed in 1925.

The Avicultural Society of South Australia (founded in 1928) produces a monthly full-colour magazine, &quot;Bird Keeping in Australia&quot;.

<text>The ecclesia or ekklesia (Greek: ἐκκλησία) was the citizens&#x27; assembly in the Ancient Greek city-state of Sparta. Unlike its more famous counterpart in Athens, the Spartan assembly had limited powers, as it did not debate; citizens could only vote for or against proposals.

In the pre-War literature, the assembly was often called the apella (), but this word refers to a festival of Apollo, the Apellai, during which the ekklesia originally met.

== Name ==
The pre-War academic literature often refers to the Spartan ekklesia as the apella. However, this word is never found in ancient sources in the singular, and never in a political context. The Apellai were a festival of Apollo during which the ekklesia originally met. They were organised once a month, with perhaps one more important feast once a year (called Apellaios), during which elections were presumably organised. In later times, the two events (religious and political) were possibly split. Ancient sources use instead the word ecclesia to designate the political assembly of the Spartans, like in any other Greek city-state. The most important mention comes from Thucydides, who reproduces a verbatim sentence of a decree between Sparta and Argos concluded in 418 or 417, which uses &quot;ecclesia&quot; for the Spartan assembly. The confusion arose from the Rhetra cited by Plutarch, mentioning &quot;apellazein&quot;, which Plutarch tells it means &quot;to assemble the people&quot;, but only in reference to Apollo, the god at the origins of the Rhetra.

== Structure ==
The meetings had in all probability taken place originally in the Agora but were later transferred to the neighbouring building, known as the Skias. According to Plutarch, a Great Rhetra was given by Pythia to Lycurgus. The old aristocratic council was substituted by the gerousia (thirty elders, including the two kings). Meetings of the ekklesia should take place from time to time, and citizens should have the power to debate and take decisions. That right of the citizens was very soon limited. Kings Theopompus and Polydorus, probably during the 7th century BC, added to the &quot;rhetra&quot; that the kings and the elders (gerousia) could set aside any &quot;crooked&quot; decision of the people.

The presiding officers were at first the kings but in historical times the ephors, and the voting was conducted by assessing the loudness of shouting in the crowd. If the president was doubtful as to the majority of voices, a division was taken, and the votes were counted. The ekklesia simply accepted or rejected the proposals submitted to it. In later times, too, the actual debate was almost, if not wholly, confined to the kings, elders, ephors and perhaps the other magistrates. The apella voted on peace and war, treaties and foreign policy in general. It decided the king who should conduct a campaign and settled questions of disputed succession to the throne. It elected elders, ephors and other magistrates, emancipated helots and perhaps voted on legal proposals.

There is a single reference to a &quot;small assembly&quot; () at Sparta, but nothing is known as to its nature or competence.

The ekklesia was responsible for electing men to the gerousia for life. Candidates were selected from the aristocrats and presented before the apella. The candidate who received the loudest applause became a member of the gerousia.

The ekklesia also elected the five ephors annually. Ephors presided over meetings of the gerousia and the apella. They could not run for re-election.

The ephorate presented motions before the ekklesia. The ekklesia then voted on the motions. However, unlike the ecclesia in Athens, the ekklesia did not debate; it merely approved or disapproved of measures. Moreover, the gerousia always had the power to veto the decision of the ekklesia.

<doc id="1096714" wikidata="Q1359323" url="?curid=1096714" title="Mangaia">
<text>Mangaia (traditionally known as A&#x27;ua&#x27;u Enua, which means &quot;terraced&quot;) is the most southerly of the Cook Islands and the second largest, after Rarotonga. It is a roughly circular island, with an area of , from Rarotonga. Originally heavily populated, Mangaia&#x27;s population has dropped by 75% in the last 50 years, mainly due to the decline of the pineapple industry in the 1980s and a subsequent economic crisis in 1996.

==Geography==
Originally known as &quot;A&#x27;ua&#x27;u&quot; or &quot;A&#x27;ua&#x27;u Enua&quot; (&quot;terraced&quot;), the island was named Mangaia (or &quot;Mangaianui-Neneva&quot;, &quot;Mangaia monstrously-great&quot;) by Tamaeu, who came to the island from Aitutaki in 1775.

Geologists estimate the island is at least 18 million years old. It rises 4,750 m (15,600 ft) above the ocean floor and has a land area of 51.8 km2. Surrounded by a fringing coral reef, like many of the southern Cook Islands, it is surrounded by a high ring of cliffs of fossil coral 60 m (200 ft) high, known as the makatea. The inner rim of the &quot;makatea&quot; forms a steep cliff, surrounding swamps and a central volcanic plateau. The interior of the island is drained by underground channels passing through the &quot;makatea&quot;, leading to extensive networks of caves which have been used historically as refuges and for burials.

The highest point is &quot;Rangi-motia&quot;, 169 m above sea level, near the centre of the island. Lake Tiriara is a body of fresh water in the south.

==History==

Excavation of the Tangatatau Rockshelter shows that Mangaia was first settled around 1000 CE. According to oral tradition, the island was not discovered, but emerged from the underworld of Avaiki already populated. It was later further settled from Rarotonga, Aitutaki, Atiu, Tonga and Tahiti. Adze heads and basalt tools show that trading contact was maintained with Rarotonga, Samoa, and Raiatea in the Society Islands. While sweet potato was likely grown as a crop earlier in the Pacific, the archaeological site at the Tangatatau Rockshelter is currently the earliest recorded location showing sweet potato cultivation in Polynesia. Initially settlement was focused on the coastal villages, but by the 16th century it had shifted inland and inter-island trade had virtually disappeared. Oral histories of this era are of chiefs competing for land and status.

The island was first discovered by Europeans on 29 March 1777 with the arrival of Captain James Cook. It was visited by two more ships, one of which was possibly &quot;HMS Bounty&quot;, before the arrival of John Williams of the London Missionary Society in 1823. Williams was unable to land, but in 1824 he returned and left behind two preachers from Taha&#x27;a, who began to convert the islands to Christianity.

Before the arrival of the missionaries, Mangaian society was characterised by a violent struggle between war-leaders competing for the title of &quot;mangaia&quot; (supreme temporal power), with &quot;Ariki&quot; serving as priests rather than hereditary chiefs. The last &quot;mangaia&quot;, Pangemiro, died shortly after the missionaries&#x27; arrival, and the abolition of war under Christianity effectively froze the power structure and the division of land and titles in the state they had been in 1823. The Numangatini Ariki became dominant, with the title alternating between two branches of the family.

In 1888 Mangaia became a British protectorate as part of the Cook Islands Federation. In 1901 it was annexed by New Zealand. Post-annexation the island exported citrus, bananas and coffee to New Zealand, but exports ceased during the First World War. In 1946 pineapple growing was introduced and in the 1960s and 1970s Mangaia had a thriving export industry. The collapse of this industry in the 1980s and a subsequent economic crisis in 1996 has led to the island&#x27;s gradual depopulation.

Mangaia was severely damaged by Cyclone Trina in December 2001. The slow-moving cyclone delivered eight days of heavy rain, resulting in the worst flooding in 50 years. Parts of the island were inundated with up to of water, and 95% of the taro crop and 60% of the livestock were destroyed. The resulting food shortage saw the IFRC distribute food to all of the island&#x27;s residents.

Due to the severity of damage caused by Trina, its name was later retired.

==Demographics and settlement==
Mangaia is divided into six districts (&quot;Puna&quot;): Tamarua, Veitatei, Kei&#x27;a, Tava&#x27;enga, Karanga, and Ivirua. The districts are very nearly sectors meeting at the highest point near the center of the island, &quot;Rangi-motia&quot;. The districts are, as on some other islands of the Southern Cook Islands, further subdivided into 38 traditional sub-districts called Tapere. In the Cook Islands constitution, however, the six districts are listed as Tapere.

The capital is the village of Oneroa, on the west coast, containing about half the population. Oneroa is in fact a contiguous village area that consists of three villages: Tavaʻenga, Kaumata and Temakatea. All of Oneroa is located within Keiʻa District, including its northernmost village Tavaʻenga, which is not in Tavaʻenga district as one might assume by the name. There are three more villages, Tamarua in the south and Ivirua and Karanga in the northeast.

Mangaia&#x27;s population was estimated at two to three thousand by John Williams in 1823. Despite an epidemic following European contact, and again in 1844, by 1846 its population had risen to 3,567. Emigration and disease had reduced the population to 2,237 in 1867, and 1,700 in 1892. In the twentieth century its population grew, peaking at 2002 in 1,966. The decline of the pineapple industry and subsequent economic collapse has led to further emigration and caused the population to drop by 75% from its peak, to 499 in 2016.

==Culture==
Unlike other islands of the Southern Cook Islands, Mangaia has retained its traditional collective land tenure system. Land use is decided by each district&#x27;s &quot;kavana&quot;, independently of the Land Court. It has also retained its own dialect of Cook Islands Māori, &quot;reo Mangaia&quot;.

One anthropologist, Donald Marshall, described Mangain residents as &quot;the most sexually active culture on record&quot; prior to European contact, with men &quot;[spending] their late teens and 20s having an average of 21 orgasms a week (more than 1,000 times a year).&quot;

==Economy==
Mangaia&#x27;s economy is heavily government-supported, with 50% of the workforce employed by the public-sector. Historically, its economy was based around agricultural production, which benefited from privileged access to the New Zealand market. The removal of this access combined with shipping interruptions destroyed the industry. Subsequent depopulation has left the island lacking in basic services, with no doctor or dentist. Current exports include &quot;eis&quot; necklaces made from the shells of the &quot;pupu&quot; snail.

Mangaia is connected to the rest of the Cook Islands by Mangaia Airport.

Previously powered by diesel generators, since 2018 it has been powered by a solar-battery power station.

==Ecology==
===Flora===
The flora of Mangaia can be divided into five ecological zones. The &quot;pa tai&quot;, or coast, is dominated by coconuts, &quot;Pandanus tectorius&quot;, &quot;Barringtonia asiatica&quot;, and other scrub plants. The &quot;Rautuitui&quot;, or upland &quot;makatea&quot;, is native forest, dominated by indigenous species such as &quot;Elaeocarpus tonganus&quot;, &quot;Hernandia moerenhoutiana&quot;, and &quot;Guettarda speciosa&quot;, with coconuts, candlenuts, and &quot;Morinda citrifolia&quot; in areas near villages and tracks. The harsher parts of the &quot;makatea&quot; are covered in scrub, including pandanus and the endemic &quot;Geniostoma sykesii&quot;. The &quot;Puna&quot; (swampy lowlands) contain the island&#x27;s most fertile soils, and are dominated by introduced and cultivate species such as taro, coconut, and &quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot;. The &quot;Rautuanue&quot; (slopes) and &quot;maunga&quot; (mountain) are heavily modified, and covered in pineapple, coconut, scrub, ferns, and grass.

===Fauna===
The arrival of humans caused the extinction of local wildlife. Surviving land-based species include the insular flying fox, Pacific reef heron, Pacific black duck, spotless crake, mewing kingfisher, Cook reed warbler, as well as 12 species of seabirds. Introduced species include the red junglefowl, Polynesian rat, Oceania gecko and mourning gecko.

Birds described from subfossil remains that became extinct as a consequence of human settlement of the island and the introduction of exotic mammals include the Mangaia rail (&quot;Gallirallus ripleyi&quot;) and the Mangaia crake (&quot;Porzana rua&quot;).

The island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

<doc id="1096722" wikidata="Q1528585" url="?curid=1096722" title="The Time Warrior">
<text>The Time Warrior is the first serial of the 11th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 15 December 1973 to 5 January 1974. The serial introduced Elisabeth Sladen as new companion Sarah Jane Smith. It also marked the debut of the Sontaran race. The serial also introduces the name of the Doctor&#x27;s home planet, Gallifrey.

In the serial, the Sontaran Commander Linx (Kevin Lindsay) crash-lands his spaceship in medieval England. He agrees to give futuristic weaponry to the warrior Irongron (David Daker) and his men, in exchange for Linx being given shelter to perform repairs on the damaged spaceship.

==Plot==

In the Middle Ages, the bandit Irongron and his aide Bloodaxe, together with their rabble of criminals, find the crashed spaceship of a Sontaran warrior named Linx. The alien claims Earth for his Empire, then sets about repairing his ship, offering Irongron “magic weapons” that will make him a king in return for shelter. Linx sends himself forward to the 20th century and kidnaps scientists from a top secret scientific research complex, then hypnotises them into making repairs on his ship.

The Third Doctor and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart are investigating the disappearance of the scientists. The Doctor meets an eccentric scientist called Rubeish and journalist Sarah Jane Smith. Later that evening Rubeish disappears and the Doctor uses the data he has gathered to pilot the TARDIS back to the Middle Ages, not realising that Sarah has stowed away on board.

Sarah is captured and brought before Irongron, along with an archer, Hal, who has been sent to kill Irongron. The Doctor sets Hal and Sarah free and they head for Wessex Castle.

The next morning Irongron and his troops assault the castle using rifles supplied by Linx, but the attack is repelled by the Doctor&#x27;s cunning. The failure further sours the relationship between Linx and Irongron.

The Doctor decides to lead an attack on Irongron&#x27;s castle. He makes contact with Rubeish and finds the human scientists in a state of extreme exhaustion. Linx catches the Doctor in the laboratory once more, but this time is rendered immobile when, with the Doctor&#x27;s guidance, a strike from Rubeish hits his probic vent – a Sontaran refuelling point on the back of their necks which is also their main weakness. Rubeish and the Doctor send the scientists back to the 20th century. Sarah now invites herself into Irongron&#x27;s kitchen, using the opportunity to drug the food, thereby knocking out Irongron&#x27;s men.

Linx determines his ship is repaired enough to effect a departure. A crazed and half drugged Irongron arrives and accuses Linx of betraying him; the Sontaran responds by killing him and is in turn shot by Hal. Linx falls dead over his controls, triggering the launch mechanism. Knowing the place is about to explode when the shuttle takes off, Hal awakes Bloodaxe, who rouses the remaining men and tells them to flee, while the Doctor hurries the last of his allies out of the castle. It explodes moments before the Doctor and Sarah depart in the TARDIS.

==Production==
Working titles for this story included &quot;The Time Fugitive&quot; and &quot;The Time Survivor&quot;. The original outline for the serial was humorously submitted to the production office in the form of a &quot;Field report from Sontaran Field Marshal Hol Mes, to Terran Cedicks&quot;.

Location shooting of both Wessex Castle and Irongron&#x27;s castle was done at Peckforton Castle, in Cheshire, utilising different views.

The serial also stars Kevin Lindsay as Commander Linx. Lindsay reappeared as Cho-je in Jon Pertwee&#x27;s last episode, &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot;, and again as two Sontarans in Tom Baker&#x27;s third story &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot;.

The story introduces a new opening sequence that includes a slit-scan &quot;time tunnel&quot; effect. It also introduces a new, diamond-shaped logo. These remained in use until 1980. This is the first story in the series history to refer to each segment as a &#x27;Part&#x27; rather than &#x27;Episode&#x27;. This remained until the end of the classic series with the exception of &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;.

==Broadcast and reception==
The BBC Audience Research Report taken for the fourth episode was positive, particularly the climax. However, there was a minority that felt it was too far-fetched or slapstick.

In &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote that the story was &quot;a rather wonderful romp&quot; and &quot;one of Robert Holmes&#x27; funniest&quot;. David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker in &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998) gave a mixed review, stating that it was &quot;enjoyable&quot;, especially in its dialogue and characters, but &quot;lacks the sort of impact ideally needed to launch a new run of adventures&quot;. They felt that it was &quot;absurd&quot; for scientists to be under custody by UNIT, that the scientists were &quot;clichéd and unbelievable&quot;, and the setting had &quot;a lack of convincing period atmosphere&quot;. In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded it four stars out of five, praising the &quot;broad characters and ripe dialogue&quot;, but felt the &quot;greatest success&quot; was Linx.

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; Christopher Bahn praised the characterisation of Linx and Sarah. DVD Talk&#x27;s Stuart Galbraith gave &quot;The Time Warrior&quot; four out of five stars, highlighting the &quot;clever writing&quot; and actor David Daker&#x27;s performance. In 2009, &quot;SFX&quot; listed the cliffhanger where Linx removes his helmet as the seventh scariest &quot;Doctor Who&quot; moment, praising the monster design and idea. In the book &quot;Doctor Who: The Episode Guide&quot;, Mark Campbell awarded it eight out of ten, concluding the serial was &quot;a clever hybrid of history and science fiction. Linx is a chilling creation and, despite the hammy acting, there are some great moments.&quot;

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in June 1978.

The Target novelisation, &quot;Doctor Who and the Time Warrior&quot;, features a prologue written by Robert Holmes involving Linx at war with a group of Rutan Fighters. He is given the first name of Jingo. The Sontaran home planet is named &quot;Sontara&quot;. It also suggests that the Earth had never been surveyed, which would eventually happen in the following &quot;Sontaran&quot; story &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot;.

Holmes was initially commissioned to novelise his own story, but wrote only the book&#x27;s prologue, sending it to Dicks with a note telling him to finish the rest himself. Holmes was not credited for his contribution. An unabridged reading of the Target novel was released by BBC audio on CD in February 2009. It is read by Jeremy Bulloch who played Hal the archer in the TV story.

===Home media===
In 1989, the story was released in an omnibus format on VHS. This version omits a slightly extended scene of Sarah&#x27;s capture from the beginning of episode two. &quot;The Time Warrior&quot; was released on region 2 DVD on 3 September 2007, commercially available in its original episodic format for the first time and on 1 April 2008 in Region 1 territories. 
It was also released as part of the &quot;Bred for War&quot; DVD boxset along stories &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot;, &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot; and &quot;The Two Doctors&quot;. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 53 on 12 January 2011.

Along with a few other selected serials of the Second and Third Doctor&#x27;s runs, this serial has been offered for sale on the iTunes Store as of August 2008.

<doc id="1096731" wikidata="Q7554108" url="?curid=1096731" title="Softbill">
<text>The term softbill is non-scientific term that has been used in aviculture for numerous years to describe a diverse range of bird species based upon their dietary habits. It has no fixed taxonomic meaning and can be misleading, as many species that fall into the category do not have a soft bill at all. Softbills are also referred to as such in aviculture to differentiate them from another commonly-kept group of birds, the hookbills - i.e. the parrots.

The proper use of the term is in reference to the ‘soft food’ diets which typically fall into the following six categories:

*Carnivorous – those who feed on small mammals, birds or other vertebrates (e.g. kingfishers, rollers)
*Insectivorous – those who feed on insects and other invertebrates (e.g. bee-eaters, flycatchers)
*Omnivorous – those who feed on both animal and plant material (e.g. Corvids, hornbills)
*Frugivorous – those who feed on fruit (e.g. turacos, fruit doves)
*Nectarivorous – those who feed on flower nectar (e.g. hummingbirds, sunbirds)
*Folivorous – those who feed on leaves, petals and other plant material (turacos, mousebirds)

This sixth diet type is usually in association with one of the above, as very few birds are solely folivorous. Several species of Galliformes are folivores, however they are not considered to be softbills.

A more recent definition by Clive Roots is, “Cage and aviary birds with relatively soft bills, which feed upon insects* and soft plant material and whose young are helpless at birth”.

- including other larger animal prey

This latter definition does discriminate against a few species, however as can be seen, the definition is very subjective and can encompass numerous species not generally included in the group.

<doc id="1096732" wikidata="Q3476317" url="?curid=1096732" title="The Sontaran Experiment">
<text>The Sontaran Experiment is the third serial of the 12th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was originally broadcast on BBC1 on 22 February and 1 March 1975.

The serial is set on Earth more than 10,000 years in the future, immediately after the events of &quot;The Ark in Space&quot;. In the serial, the Sontaran Field Major Styre (Kevin Lindsay) performs experiments on humans he trapped there as part of the Sontarans&#x27; invasion stratagem.

==Plot==
Following on from &quot;The Ark in Space&quot;, the Fourth Doctor, Sarah Jane Smith, and Harry Sullivan teleport down from the Nerva space station to Earth, ostensibly uninhabited. However, the system is not functioning well, and the Doctor begins repairing it. The other two explore the surrounding area, but Harry falls down a crevasse and Sarah goes to seek the Doctor&#x27;s help. He is nowhere in sight.

Roth, an astronaut, finds Sarah. He is obviously distressed, and explains that he has been tortured by an alien that lives in the rocks, together with its patrolling robot. He takes Sarah towards the astronauts&#x27; campsite, but refuses to approach it, suspecting the astronaut Vural of collusion with the alien.

Three of the astronauts have captured the Doctor. They believe Nerva to be a legend, and tell him in turn that they had picked up a distress signal from Earth. They came to investigate, but their ship was vapourised when they emerged, leaving nine of them stranded. Then they began to vanish one by one. They blame the Doctor for this. Roth appears and the astronauts chase him, while Sarah frees the Doctor. Roth loses the others and meets up with Sarah and the Doctor. The Doctor also falls down a crevasse, and the robot returns, capturing Roth and Sarah and bringing them to the alien&#x27;s spacecraft. The alien is Field Major Styre of the Sontaran G3 Military Assessment Survey, who has been experimenting on, and killing, the astronauts. Roth tries to escape but is shot dead by Styre.

Styre reports back to his Marshal via a video link. The Marshal is impatient for the intelligence report (without which an invasion of Earth cannot take place), but Styre admits that he has been delayed in his experiments.

Styre subjects Sarah to a series of terrifying hallucinations. The Doctor, free from the hole, has reached her and rips off a hallucinogenic device from her forehead, but she falls unconscious. The Doctor, enraged, attacks Styre, but the Sontaran easily fends him off. Styre shoots him unconscious (believing it to be fatal) when he runs away.

The robot, having captured the three remaining spacemen, brings them to Styre&#x27;s ship, where it is revealed that Vural had tried to make a deal with Styre in exchange for his own life. However, Styre intends to experiment on Vural anyway. The Doctor recovers, disables the robot, and meets Sarah and Harry. He confronts Styre, goading him into a hand-to-hand combat. While they fight, Sarah and Harry free the astronauts, and then Harry climbs towards Styre&#x27;s ship to sabotage it. Styre almost wins the fight, but Vural attacks him, saving the Doctor at the cost of his own life. Styre, now low on energy, heads back towards his ship to recharge, but the sabotage causes it to kill him.

The Doctor informs the Marshal that not only has Styre&#x27;s mission failed, but that the invasion plans are in human hands. This is enough to ward off the invasion, and the three companions attempt to return to Nerva.

These two episodes were initially part of a six-episode arc, but Philip Hinchcliffe made the decision to split the arc into the four-part &quot;Ark in Space&quot; and this two-part story, sharing the same director and budget. To save money, Hinchcliffe decided that &quot;Ark&quot; would be entirely recorded in the studio and this story would be entirely recorded on location. He also settled on the Sontarans because they could re-use the Sontaran costume from &quot;The Time Warrior&quot; and therefore save the expense of designing a new alien. This was the first two-part serial to be broadcast since 1965&#x27;s &quot;The Rescue&quot; and the last until 1982&#x27;s &quot;Black Orchid&quot;.

Although the serial was the third to feature Baker, it was actually the second shot, hence the out-of-sequence production code. This was only the second serial in the history of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (the first being 1970&#x27;s &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;) to be shot entirely on location, in this case at Hound Tor on Dartmoor. However, unlike &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot; and the location material for other serials, the production was mounted entirely on videotape using early portable video equipment, rather than on the usual 16mm film. This use of location video was remarkable for the time, but technical problems are evident in the final programmes. This was also the first and only &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story where there were no interior scenes at all. During shooting, Baker broke his collarbone. However, because part of his costume was a large scarf, he could conceal the neck brace he had to wear following the injury. For action scenes, he was doubled by regular stunt performer Terry Walsh, shot from several face-concealing angles. The recording of both episodes was completed in a week.

===Cast notes===
Glyn Jones, who played the astronaut Krans, wrote the First Doctor serial &quot;The Space Museum&quot; (1965); he was the only person both to act and write for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; during its original 1963-89 run. &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot; contains the last major role played by Kevin Lindsay before his death in 1975 of a heart condition. He found the heavy Sontaran costume so difficult to manage that he could not leave the Hound Tor location for breaks, and also could not perform the fight scene – a stand-in, Stuart Fell, was used instead. Terry Walsh not only played a minor role as an astronaut, but doubled for Tom Baker in parts of episode two, after Baker broke a collarbone during filming. This meant that the climactic fight was performed by two stand-ins rather than the original actors. Most of the actors playing the GalSec astronauts were South African. This was specified in the casting, as the writers, Bob Baker and Dave Martin, were interested in language change and reasoned that the multi-linguistic influences on South African English might resemble future developments of the English language.

==Broadcast and reception==
The two episodes were combined into a single 50 minute omnibus broadcast on BBC1 at 6:25 pm on 9 July 1976 and was seen by 8.2 million viewers. The story received criticism from Mary Whitehouse (of the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association) for its depiction of &quot;helpless adults in a state of terror&quot;.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995) that the serial &quot;succeeds despite its obvious limitations&quot;. They praised the look of the all-video location recording, but commented that &quot;neither the robot nor the deflection of the Marshal&#x27;s invasion plans are wholly convincing&quot;. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker said that the premise of a Sontaran surveying humans before conquering the Earth was &quot;silly&quot;, but they praised the &quot;atmosphere and imagery&quot; achieved with tension, location filming, and direction. In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; described &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot; as &quot;short, taut and sadistic&quot; and wrote that &quot;impetus and panache prevail over problems with plot logic&quot;. DVD Talk&#x27;s Stuart Galbraith gave the serial three and half out of five stars, writing that its &quot;best assets are its appropriately confined telling&quot;.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial was written by Ian Marter, who appeared in the serial as the Doctor&#x27;s companion Harry. It was published by Target Books in November 1978. The novelisation differs from the TV version by having the travellers arrive in the TARDIS. The Sontaran plan here does not involve war with the Rutans but a planned conquest in alliance with another clone species.

===Home media===
&quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot; was released on VHS in October 1991 as a double video with &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;. In October 2006, it was released on DVD on its own or part of the &quot;Bred for War&quot; box set, along with &quot;The Time Warrior,&quot; &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot; and &quot;The Two Doctors.&quot;

<text>Nicholas E. Macioci (September 19, 1927 – December 24, 2000) was an American bass singer, songwriter, and bass guitarist. He is best known for his work as the bassist and bass vocalist for The Four Seasons, for whom he performed under the stage name Nick Massi.

==Biography==
Born in Newark, New Jersey, Nicholas &quot;Massi&quot; Macioci was first taught to play the bass fiddle by Newark native and musician Anthony Gaeta. As a bass singer, Massi had been playing with several bands before he joined The Four Lovers in 1958, including some groups that featured future Four Lovers and Four Seasons members Frankie Valli and Tommy DeVito. Valli credited Macioci as one of his most influential early mentors in the music business. In October 1959, Macioci, by this point billed as &quot;Nickie Massey,&quot; was signed to Brunswick Records as frontman for the Nite-Lites; he recorded one single, the self-composed &quot;Tell Me You Care,&quot; which received a positive review in &quot;Cashbox&quot; but eventually failed to chart.

After Massi rejoined DeVito and Valli (who by this point were joined by keyboardist Bob Gaudio), the group evolved into the Four Seasons. They performed such hits as &quot;Sherry,&quot; &quot;Dawn (Go Away),&quot; and &quot;Rag Doll.&quot; He was responsible for most of the group&#x27;s vocal arrangements and wrote at least one song, the doo-wop style ballad &quot;Living Just for You,&quot; for the group&#x27;s &quot;Working My Way Back to You&quot; album. He took a scientific, &quot;open harmony&quot; approach to his arrangements that differered from the improvisational style of doo-wop groups before him. Massi left the Four Seasons in September 1965, and was replaced temporarily by Charles Calello who, in turn, was replaced by Joe Long.

Massi, Tommy DeVito, Frankie Valli, and Bob Gaudio—the original members of The Four Seasons—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999. Massi was posthumously recognized in 2017 when DeVito, Valli, Gaudio and Joe Long (Massi&#x27;s successor) were inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

Following his departure from the Four Seasons, he continued to operate Vito-Mass Productions, a production company that primarily focused on local New Jersey musical acts. He had a longstanding desire to front his own group, a factor in his departure from the Four Seasons and a desire that, other than occasional singles on small independent labels, never materialized. Much like his successor Joe Long, Massi had occasional reunions with the band after his departure, most prominently for a stretch in the 1970s.

In 1949, Macioci married Margaret Ann &quot;Margie&quot; Mengel, with whom he had three children, Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Macioci, Nick Macioci Jr. and Patricia &quot;Patti&quot; Massi-Candeliere. Nick and Margie would remain married until his death. Margie died in 2022.

In his latter years, Macioci, reverting to his birth surname, took up painting as a hobby; his daughter Patti has published many of his paintings online, consisting of a broad variety of styles but most commonly featuring portraits of celebrities and figures associated with his Catholic faith. He was made aware of plans to make &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; in the earliest stages and gave his approval to go ahead with the product before his death; his family eventually gave its strong support, with his widow describing it as her favorite musical. Valli and Gaudio ensured that the Massi family were paid an equal share of the profits from &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; as the other three members received; his son Nick Jr. claimed that DeVito used the contract to take a share four times as large as the Massi family received and that while Margie received a royalty (the size of which was in dispute), the children received nothing, which led to tensions when Nick Jr. resorted to scalping and aggressive behavior at &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; shows in an effort to provide for his daughter.

Massi died of liver cancer on December 24, 2000, allegedly brought on by &quot;alcoholism and other demons,&quot; at his home in West Orange, New Jersey. He spent the later years of his life as a recluse; according to Nick Jr., his father was estranged from his mother at the time of his death, living in the basement of their family home in &quot;an igloo&quot; and living off a Social Security pension.

<doc id="1096747" wikidata="Q4346116" url="?curid=1096747" title="William Poole">
<text>William Poole (July 24, 1821 – March 8, 1855), also known as Bill the Butcher, was the leader of the Washington Street Gang, which later became known as the Bowery Boys gang. He was a local leader of the Know Nothing political movement in mid-19th-century New York City.

==Early life==
Poole was born in Sussex County, New Jersey, to parents of English descent. In 1832, his family moved to New York City to open a butcher shop in Washington Market, Manhattan. Poole became skilled in his father&#x27;s trade and eventually took over the family store. In the 1840s, he worked with the Howard (Red Rover) Volunteer Fire Engine Company #34, on Hudson and Christopher Streets, and started the Washington Street Gang which later became the Bowery Boys. During this period in New York, fires were a problem for the city. Volunteer fire groups, such as the one Poole was in were important for keeping fires under control. These firefighting groups were closely tied with street gangs, and were seen as a public service provided by those groups. Throughout the years there was an ongoing rivalry between gangs over who would be the one to extinguish the fire. There began a common strategy that the Bowery Boys utilized to ensure that other fire engine companies could not put out the fires. Upon hearing the alarm sound indicating that a fire had broken out, a member of the Bowery Boys would find the nearest fire hydrant. He would then proceed to flip over an empty barrel upon the hydrant so it could not be seen or used. The Bowery Boys would sit on the barrel until his own fire engine arrived. Fights over the hydrants would break out, and often the Bowery Boys had no time to actually extinguish the fire.

== Personality ==
William Poole was a large man for the time. He weighed over two hundred pounds and was about six feet tall. He was known for his brutal boxing style: &quot;He was well known as being a notoriously dirty fighter, not averse to biting off noses, gouging out eyeballs, or beating a man to jelly.&quot; He fought in many fights that were considered illegal due to the brutality of bare-knuckle boxing. He was also a known skilled knife fighter, as a result of his profession as a butcher. Poole was a known gambler and a heavy drinker. He closed his family&#x27;s butchery business in the 1850s and opened a drinking saloon, known as the &quot;Bank Exchange&quot;.

== Street gangs ==
Street gangs in New York were fluid in their membership and name as they merged and found new leaders. The most well-known of these was the Bowery Boys, which Poole formed from his own Washington Street gang and a collection of many other street gangs. Other key gangs incorporated into the Bowery Boys were the American Guards, Atlantic Guards, True Blue Americans, and the Order of the Star-Spangled Guard. These gangs were composed of nativist White Anglo-Saxon Protestants who were opposed to enfranchisement of the growing number of Irish Catholic refugees from the Great Famine. Street gangs, like the Bowery Boys, &quot;were bound by ethnic ties or nativist belief; the members tended to be deeply patriotic, and a common thread was the belief that the country was pretty well full, so that newcomers were not welcomed.&quot; Poole&#x27;s gang was located near to the Five Points neighborhood, where many recent Irish Catholic immigrants settled. Five Points was located in what is now Chinatown in Lower Manhattan. Waves of Irish- and German-Americans moved into the Five Points as their first stop on the way to the American dream. In response to attacks by Poole and his followers, the Irish created their own street gangs. The Dead Rabbits were an Irish-membership gang and the biggest rival of Poole&#x27;s Bowery Boys. Much of the hatred between the two gangs was based on racial and religious differences. &quot;For years the Bowery Boys and the Dead Rabbits waged a bitter feud, and a week seldom passed in which they did not come to blows, either along the Bowery, or in the Five Points section.&quot; Both gangs were primarily brawlers and street fighters, another reason why William Poole was a well-known fighter, and most of their battling was done in open spaces. Poole made many alliances with other street gangs that supported his ideology.

==Political views==
William Poole detested the Democratic Party&#x27;s local political machine, Tammany Hall, because they accepted and included immigrants as members. Tammany Hall-affiliated street gangs also protected Irish Catholics from Poole&#x27;s Bowery Boys, whom he sent to terrorize immigrants and keep them from registering to vote. Poole and the Bowery Boys were a de facto extension of the Know Nothings, a nativist and militantly anti-Catholic political party. According to the &quot;New Orleans True Delta&quot;, the purpose of the Know Nothings was &quot;twofold – part religious, part political; and the ends aimed at the disenfranchisement of adopted citizens, and their exclusion from office, and perpetual war upon the Catholic religion.&quot; Originally, the Know Nothings were known as the Native American Party, but changed their name in 1855. Members of the Know Nothing Party had to &quot;be a native-born citizen, of native-born parents, and not of the Catholic religion&quot;. The goal was to organize native White Anglo-Saxon Protestants to defend and preserve their religion and control of American politics from enfranchised Catholics, immigrants and their descendants.

Poole was nominated by the Whig party in April 1848 as a candidate for alderman, representing the Sixth Ward. Poole fared poorly in the general election, receiving only 199 votes and tying for last place with his ticket-mate against four other candidates. 

In February of 1853, Poole was appointed to represent the Sixth Ward on the New York City Board of Education.

==Attack at Florence&#x27;s Hotel==
As a well-known gang leader and pugilist, Poole was frequently involved in fights, brawls, and other confrontations. The &quot;New York Daily Times&quot; reported the following on October 23, 1851:
==Dispute with John Morrissey==

Poole&#x27;s arch rival John Morrissey was an Irish immigrant and worked for the political machine at Tammany Hall. Morrissey was also a popular bare-knuckle boxer and challenged Poole to a match. Though the two men were of differing ethnic backgrounds and political parties, the initial grounds for their dispute may have arisen from an earlier bet by Poole on a boxing match at Boston Corners on October 12, 1853, in which Poole had placed his bet on Morrissey&#x27;s opponent, &quot;Yankee Sullivan&quot;. The results of the boxing match were disputed—Sullivan beat Morrisey but was then distracted into leaving the ring by Morrisey&#x27;s friends and the referee announced Morrisey winner for being in the ring—and Poole was against Morrissey being paid. In 1854 a fight was arranged between Morrissey and Poole, which Poole won.

===Shooting and death===
Morrissey plotted revenge and on February 25, 1855, recently-fired NYPD patrolman Lewis Baker and Jim Turner, who were allegedly acting as enforcers for Morrissey, shot Poole in the leg and chest at Stanwix Hall, a bar on Broadway near Prince, at that time a center of the city&#x27;s nightlife. The &quot;New York Daily Times&quot; reported on February 26, 1855, the following:

Several days after the shooting, on March 8, 1855, Poole died in his home on Christopher Street at the age of 33. Poole was survived by his wife and son, Charles Poole. The war between Poole and Morrissey had been very public and &quot;The New York Times&quot; covered the events of Stanwix Hall almost every day for a month. One local newsman reported Poole&#x27;s last words were, &quot;Good-bye, boys; I die a true American,&quot; although the New York Evening Post, quoting an unnamed man who was at Poole&#x27;s bedside when he died, reported that his last words named Morrissey as his killer. He was buried on March 11, 1855, in Brooklyn&#x27;s Green-Wood Cemetery with thousands of spectators.

Lewis Baker fled New York City, with the help of Daniel Kerrigan, a twenty-four year old 1853 Democratic nominee for councilman. Kerrigan was an Irish-American and expressed sympathy for Baker. The &quot;Times&quot; called Kerrigan &quot;one &#x27;of the principle accessories to the murder of Poole and the flight of Baker.&quot; Facing an international manhunt organized by Poole&#x27;s patrons in the Know Nothing Party, Baker boarded the &quot;Jewett&quot; and sailed for the Canary Islands. He was intercepted, however, on the high seas on April 17, 1855. Baker was arrested and returned to New York City to be tried for the murder of William Poole. All three trials, however, ended with a hung jury and Baker ultimately walked away a free man. Morrissey went on to open up several Irish pubs and accumulated a fortune of $1.5 million. He later served two terms as a New York state senator and two more terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Morrissey died in 1878 and lies buried in a Roman Catholic cemetery in his childhood hometown of Troy, New York.

==In popular culture==
Daniel Day-Lewis played a heavily fictionalized version of Bill the Butcher, renamed William Cutting, in the 2002 Martin Scorsese film &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;. Day-Lewis received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for his performance.

The chief differences between the historical Poole and the cinematic &quot;Butcher&quot; are that, while Poole died before the Civil War, the fictional character is still alive and leading his street gang in 1862, ultimately dying in the film in a street battle instead of being mortally shot in the Florence Hotel. Day-Lewis&#x27;s Poole reveals to Leonardo DiCaprio’s character that he is 47 years old, making him born in 1815, and claimed his father was killed by the British at the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane, six years before the real Poole was born.

<doc id="1096751" wikidata="Q2734389" url="?curid=1096751" title="Dee Jay">
<text>is a fictional character in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series. He made his first appearance in the 1993&#x27;s &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; as one of the four new characters introduced in the game. In the series, he is a Jamaican kickboxer and karateka, as well as a recording artist and breakdancer. He was the only character at the time to be designed by an American. Dee Jay was based on real-life kickboxer Billy Blanks and has received mixed critical reception.

==Conception design==
Dee Jay was conceived for &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; by American designer James Goddard, and his name was chosen as a variant on Goddard&#x27;s nickname, DJames. He was the first &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character to be designed by an American, and only one of only three characters in the series to have been conceived by an American, along with Blade and Captain Sawada. While &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; was going to feature Cammy, T. Hawk, and two brothers who had the same design save for a head swap, Goddard felt that it would be redundant to have another pair of characters with the same fighting style. As a result, Capcom added Dee Jay in place of one of the brothers, while the other evolved into Fei Long.

The character concept came from interpreting kickboxer Billy Blanks from his role in &quot;The King of the Kickboxers,&quot; but with a more cheerful disposition. Goddard suggested Blanks as an inspiration when the Japanese team asked for more design ideas. Goddard commented that &quot;a really kick-ass black character would be awesome, instead of someone who was more negative, which is what you tended to see from the Japanese back in those days.&quot; In spite of the fact that Blanks is a bad guy in the film which he saw him in, &quot;The King of the Kickboxers&quot;, he states &quot;his build and look, I just thought that it would make a great character—high-flying, crazy kicks... I mean, you have to remember, this was Billy Blanks pre-&#x27;Tae Bo.&#x27; He was so bad-ass.&quot;

Goddard began designing Dee Jay by drawing a sketch of him and sending it to the Japanese team. He sent the film &quot;The King of the Kickboxers&quot; by copying a VHS tape and sending it through FedEx. He designed him as a &quot;positive, fun character,&quot; implementing elements such as him being Jamaican, a &quot;fun-loving guy,&quot; and a person who is trying to &quot;jump-start his music career while kicking a lot of ass.&quot; While the design on his pants originally said &quot;MANTIS,&quot; but was changed to say &quot;MAXIMUM.&quot; This was because his sprite facing left was a mirror image of his sprite facing right, and the N and S in &quot;MANTIS&quot; would be reversed on the left sprite. According to Goddard, &quot;we decided that Mantis wasn&#x27;t going to work down the side of his pants, so we opted for Maximum.&quot; Soon after, Dee Jay was adapted into the 1994 &quot;Street Fighter&quot; film, played by Miguel A. Núñez Jr. with his musical background replaced by computer skills. As one of the only characters to be created by an American designer&quot;, Street Fighter&quot; co-creator Akira Nishitani commented that he only learned the story behind the character&#x27;s creation decades after.

==Appearances==
Dee Jay made his debut in &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; (1993) as one of the four new characters introduced in the game in addition to the original twelve character roster from previous &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; games. He enters the World Warrior tournament, seeking inspiration to develop a new musical sound. Dee Jay reappears as a playable character in the console versions of &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; (1998) and in the console version of &quot;Street Fighter: The Movie&quot;. The game is set before the World Warrior tournament and depicts Dee Jay before he began his professional music career. While he was not included in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, development of his character for its sequel, &quot;Super Street Fighter IV&quot;, had commenced during the former game&#x27;s development. Audio files of the announcer from &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; announcing Dee Jay were found amongst the game&#x27;s audio files. He was revealed along with T. Hawk, who also originated from &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;, and Juri, a character created for &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;. In &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;, Dee Jay has a manager named Rick, while in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; he has an agent named Bob. Dee Jay returns in &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, where he is now successful musician and part-time actor, as well as being a fan of Manon Legrand and befriend with a fellow music loving fighter, Kimberly Jackson who helped him find a new song.

One of the trailers of &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot; showed parts of Dee Jay that resembles him. However he did not make it to the final roster. Instead, his appearance served as a swap costume for Hwoarang.

===In other media===
Dee Jay plays a minor role in &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;. Here, he beats up a few punks causing trouble at a nightclub before being warned by Guile and Chun-Li that he is being monitored by Shadaloo, which he does not believe until Chun-Li destroys one of their cyborgs in front of him. He was voiced by Ginzo Matsuo in Japanese and Beau Billingslea (credited as John Hammond) in English.

In the 1994 live-action film version of &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, Dee Jay was portrayed by Miguel A. Núñez, Jr. as one of the primary antagonists. He is depicted as a greedy hacker and engineer working for General M. Bison. In the film&#x27;s climax, Dee Jay flees from Bison&#x27;s base with a trunk of Bison&#x27;s money instead of staying to fight, only to find it full of useless &quot;Bison Dollars&quot; that Bison had planned to issue as currency once he took over the world. He is also seen telling Zangief that Bison is the true enemy and had been using them both since his rise to crime power (though he had paid Dee Jay well while paying Zangief nothing). This version of Dee Jay appears in the console version of the &quot;Street Fighter: The Movie&quot; video game, and serves as the second of the four Grand Masters in the Street Battle mode (along with Zangief, Sagat and Bison).

UDON&#x27;s line of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; comics gives Dee Jay a minor role as a brainwashed agent of Shadaloo who breaks into MI5&#x27;s Delta Red headquarters (along with other Doll agents) and frees a captured Doll agent from their custody. He is captured during the raid and his mind is restored with the help of Delta Red.

==Reception==
Dee Jay has received mixed reception. &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; described Dee Jay as &quot;a flashy rapper-type, and probably the best of the new four&quot; characters introduced in &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;. Professional &quot;Street Fighter&quot; player Keith Stuart listed him as his second favourite &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character and praised his &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; incarnation, while also praising him for being &quot;a really positive, happy character.&quot; &quot;IGN UK&quot; editor Martin Robinson, in discussing the Dee Jay, T. Hawk, and Juri, stated that &quot;all three of which we&#x27;ve played and all three of which we&#x27;re already in love with.&quot; In discussing &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Giant Bomb&quot; editor Jeff Gerstmann commented that &quot;I did my best to basically pretend he didn&#x27;t exist,&quot; stating that the &quot;real stars&quot; of the game were Fei-Long and Cammy.

IGN editor Jesse Schedeen criticized his inclusion in the 1994 film, stating that he &quot;seemed included merely for comic relief.&quot; However, &quot;Games World&quot; praised the film for casting Miguel A. Núñez Jr., and also the alterations to his character, adding &quot;going from DJ to computer whizz isn&#x27;t a bad career move at all&quot;. Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; also noted a preference for the direction the film took the character, stating in regards to his in-game storyline &quot;Dee Jay is all about rhythm and that’s about it. Despite being a guy based on dancing, he’s still somehow the most boring guy.&quot;

Dee Jay has been examined as a representation of black characters in games. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; notes that Dee Jay was one of the few black video game characters in the early 1990s, saying &quot;the representation of black characters in the &#x27;90s seemed to get worse, with odd creative choices by developers and straight up laughable attempts at diversity, including a personal favourite, Dee Jay.&quot; Journalist and game critic Evan Narcisse notes Dee Jay as one of the few black characters in games from this period, as part of &quot;a whole parade of hot-tempered brawn-centric bruisers and slangtastic slicksters have appeared in fighting game series ... all clearly meant to convey a &#x27;hip&#x27; urban lifestyle in the broadest of strokes.&quot; &quot;Bitmob&quot; editor Brian Shirk mentions Dee Jay among &quot;Street Fighter&quot;&#x27;s &quot;most offensive stereotypes&quot; reserved for poorer nations that had been colonized, commenting that his appearance &quot;brings to mind the word &quot;savage&quot; that was typical of depictions of black people in early film. &quot;Paste&quot; described him as &quot;one of the most reviled characters in the series&#x27; whole canon. He’s among the least sensitive stereotypes in the Street Fighter II cast&quot;, and felt it was a sign of where things were going too far with re-releases, however they later added that due to the lack of usage and limited number of black characters in the series, they&#x27;d become more fond of him and ended with &quot;I’ll take what I can get.&quot;

<text>The retinoids are a class of chemical compounds that are natural derivatives of vitamin A or are chemically related to it. Synthetic retinoids are utilized in cosmetic formulations, clinical dermatology, and the treatment of some forms of cancer.

Retinoids have many important functions throughout the body, including in vision, regulation of skin proliferation and differentiation, growth of bone tissue, immune function, and male fertility.

The biology of retinoids is complex, having well-documented effectiveness in the management of conditions ranging from acute promyelocytic leukemia to acne to photoaging. On the other hand, retinoids may be involved in metabolic dysfunction and, at least in some forms, carcinogenesis.

==Types==
Retinoids are divided into four generations based on their molecular structure and receptor selectivity.
== Structure ==
The basic structure of the hydrophobic retinoid molecule consists of a cyclic end group, a polyene side chain and a polar end group. The conjugated system formed by alternating C=C double bonds in the polyene side chain are responsible for the color of retinoids (typically yellow, orange, or red). Hence, many retinoids are chromophores. Alternation of side chains and end groups creates the various classes of retinoids.

First generation retinoids are produced naturally in the body and interact with their normal biological counterparts, such as retinol binding protein 4 for retinol, retinoid receptors for all-trans-retinoic acid or 9-cis-retinoic acid. 13-cis retinoic acid has an unknown biological pathway but appears to act as a growth factor.

Second generation retinoids have a mixed effect and interact mainly with signaling in the skin.

Third generation retinoids have narrow biological roles due to their constrained structure, with adapalene mimicking the effects of isotretinoin, bexarotene binding only the Retinoid X receptors, and tazarotene binding the Retinoic acid receptor beta and Retinoic acid receptor gamma forms.

The only fourth generation retinoid, Trifarotene, binds selectively to the RAR-y receptor. It was approved for use in the US in 2019.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
The major source of retinoids in human diet are plant pigments such as carotenes and retinyl esters derived from animal sources. Retinyl esters are transported through the chylomicron pathway to the liver or fat tissue while retinol or carotenes are transported from the enterocytes to the liver and are processed into retinyl esters by LRAT for storage. Most synthetic retinoids are absorbed when taken orally while topical retinoids cannot diffuse through the skin barrier unless it is compromised.

All classes of retinoid bind to many proteins. Natural retinoids such as retinol and retinyl esters bind to carrier proteins such as RBP4, chylomicrons and VLDL while synthetic retinoids likely bind to these and other proteins. First generation retinoids are rapidly metabolized by Cytochrome p450 enzymes, typically of the Cyp26 family. Later generation retinoids are resistant to Cyp26 metabolism and remain in the body for much longer.

==Uses==
Common skin conditions treated by topical retinoids include acne, psoriasis, and effects of photoaging. In addition, retinoids are used to treat some rare skin disorders, including discoid lupus and mycosis fungoides. In Japan, isotretinoin may be used for neuroblastoma treatment, but it is not approved in other countries due to a lack of consistency in studies of its effectiveness. Oral retinoids are readily toxic, requiring consistent clinical oversight, and are approved in several diseases for which said toxicity is paradoxically useful, including acute promyelocytic leukemia, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and heterotopic ossification.

==Toxicity==
Toxic effects of retinoids occur with both acute or prolonged intake, depending on which retinoid is considered. The specific toxicity is related to the mechanism of action as well as exposure. A medical sign of chronic or acute poisoning with retinol is hypervitaminosis A, which includes the presence of painful tender swellings on the long bones. Anorexia, skin lesions, hair loss, hepatosplenomegaly, papilloedema, bleeding, general malaise, pseudotumor cerebri, and death may also occur. Similar effects occur with other retinoids, except for 13-cis retinoic acid and its derivatives, such as adapalene.

Retinoids provoke rapid elevation of circulating triglycerides leading to hypertriglyceridemia as well as cholesterol, leading to hypercholesterolemia. Retinoids are further shown to worsen many metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and congestive heart failure. Large-scale randomized, controlled clinical trials have conclusively shown that vitamin A, retinol and other retinoids increase mortality and cancer rates. In addition to the harmful effects shared by other retinoids, bexarotene causes severe hypothyroidism.

The Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), based on its review, confirmed that taking oral retinoids during pregnancy can have harmful effects on the baby as they may cause CNS, cranio-facial, cardiovascular and other defects. The use of acitretin, alitretinoin and isotretinoin should be prohibited in women of childbearing age unless they take measures to prevent pregnancy. The use of topical retinoids should also be excluded during pregnancy and in women planning pregnancy.

Many lotions that claim to prevent or treat stretch marks contain retinol, which is not an ingredient that is safe for pregnant women. The Association of the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) recommends that pregnant women consult a health care provider before trying any lotions or oils for stretch mark prevention.
