<text>Gabriel Leuvielle (16 December 18831 November 1925), known professionally as Max Linder (), was a French actor, director, screenwriter, producer, and comedian of the silent film era. His onscreen persona &quot;Max&quot; was one of the first recognizable recurring characters in film. He has also been cited as the &quot;first international movie star&quot; and &quot;the first film star anywhere&quot;.

Born in Cavernes, France to Catholic parents, Linder grew up with a passion for theater and enrolled in the Conservatoire de Bordeaux in 1899. He soon received awards for his performances and continued to pursue a career in the legitimate theater. He became a contract player with the Bordeaux Théâtre des Arts from 1901 to 1904, performing in plays by Molière, Pierre Corneille, and Alfred de Musset.

From the summer of 1905, Linder appeared in short comedy films for Pathé, at first usually in supporting roles. His first major film role was in the Georges Méliès-like fantasy film &quot;The Legend of Punching&quot;. During the following years, Linder made several hundred short films portraying &quot;Max&quot;, a wealthy and dapper man-about-town frequently in hot water because of his penchant for beautiful women and the good life. Starting with &quot;The Skater&#x27;s Debut&quot; in 1907, the character became one of the first identifiable motion-picture characters who appeared in successive situation comedies. By 1911, Linder was co-directing his own films (with René LePrince) as well as writing the scripts.

Linder enlisted at the outbreak of the First World War, and worked at first as a dispatch driver and entertainer. During his service, he was injured several times, and the experiences reportedly had a devastating effect on him both physically and mentally. Linder later moved to the U.S. but was unable to achieve success. He died in 1925 in a purported suicide pact with his wife in Paris.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Max Linder was born Gabriel Leuvielle near Saint-Loubès, Gironde. He was called &quot;Max&quot; from a young age. His parents, Jean and Suzanne (née Baron), were wealthy vineyard owners and expected Linder to take over the family business; his older brother Maurice (28 June 1881 – 14 December 1959) had become a celebrated national rugby player. But Linder grew up with a passion for theater, and was enthralled by the traveling theater and circus performances that occasionally visited his town. He later wrote that &quot;nothing was more distasteful to me than the thought of a life among the grapes.&quot;

As a child, Linder fell victim to a severe case of cholera. He survived by resting in the oven of the village baker. The heat from the oven supposedly brought down the infection to a manageable level.

In the spring of 1888, the Leuvielle family&#x27;s plantation was attacked by grape phylloxera. Jean and Suzanne heavily considered emigrating to America, and embarked on a trip to New York in search for propitious offers. During their trip, Max and Maurice remained in France with their grandmother Jeanne. Nothing became of Jean and Suzanne&#x27;s plans to emigrate, as it was discovered that the French vines could be replaced with American plants, which were sturdier and resistant to phylloxera.

While in New York, Suzanne gave birth to Max&#x27;s younger brother, Gérard. They returned to France, and, two years later, a sister, Marcelle, was born. Max developed a particular affection for her. Marcelle, along with Suzanne and Jean, appeared in Max&#x27;s film &quot;Max Is Convalescent&quot; (1911) and Marcelle starred alongside Max in &quot;Max, The Heartbreaker&quot; (1917).

===Early career 1899–1905===
In 1899, Linder enrolled in the Conservatoire de Bordeaux and quickly won awards for first prize in comedy and second prize in tragedy. He continued to pursue a career in the theater and became a contract player with the Bordeaux Théâtre des Arts from 1901 to 1904, performing in plays by Molière, Pierre Corneille and Alfred de Musset. At the same time that he was performing in serious dramatic theater, he became friends with Charles le Bargy of the Comédie-Française. Le Bargy encouraged Linder to audition for the Conservatoire de Paris in 1904. Linder was rejected and began appearing in less prestigious theaters such as the Olympia Theater and the Théâtre de l&#x27;Ambigu.

By 1905, he had adopted his stage name of Max Linder and used it in several theatrical performances. Also during this period, Linder applied for work at Pathé Frères in Vincennes at the suggestion of film director Louis Gasnier and began appearing in small bit parts, mostly in slapstick comedies. Linder continued to appear on the stage for the next two years and was not a significant film star at first. However, an often-told legend about the origins of Linder&#x27;s film career is that French film producer Charles Pathé personally saw Linder on the stage and wrote him a note that read &quot;In your eyes lies a fortune. Come and act in front of my cameras, and I will help make it.&quot;

===Film career 1905–1916===

From 1905 to 1907, Linder appeared in dozens of short comedy films for Pathé, usually in a supporting role. His first noticeably larger film role was in &quot;The Young Man&#x27;s First Outing&quot; in 1905. He also appeared in Georges Méliès-like fantasy films such as &quot;Serpentine Dances&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Punching&quot;, his first leading role. His rise to stardom commenced in 1907 when Pathé&#x27;s slapstick star René Gréhan left the company to join Éclair. Gréhan&#x27;s screen character was Gontran, whose persona included high-society clothing and a dandy-ish demeanor. Linder was chosen to take over the characterization for Pathé, and the style of dress and personality of Gréhan&#x27;s character became his trademark. Film critic David Robinson described Linder&#x27;s screen persona as &quot;no grotesque: he was young, handsome, debonair, immaculate...in silk hat, jock coat, cravat, spats, patent shoes, and swagger cane.&quot; Linder made more than one hundred short films portraying &quot;Max&quot;, a wealthy and dapper man-about-town frequently in hot water because of his penchant for beautiful women and the good life. With this character, he had created one of the first identifiable motion-picture characters who appeared in successive situation comedies.

Linder&#x27;s first appearance as &quot;Max&quot; was in &quot;The Skater&#x27;s Debut&quot; in 1907. Lake Daumesnil in Paris had frozen over and director Louis Gasnier filmed Linder in his new attire, with Linder improvising the rest. In the film, &quot;Max&quot; falls about and does a rendition of &quot;the windmill routine&quot; by spinning his cane around, predating Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s version in &quot;The Rink&quot; by nine years. Pathé was unimpressed with the film and re-shot parts of it, and it was not popular with audiences when released. Soon afterwards, Gasnier left Pathé and moved to Italy, leaving Linder without a supporter at Pathé; he made few films in 1908. His luck began to change when Pathé&#x27;s top comedy star, André Deed, left to work with the Italian film company Itala, leaving Linder as the company&#x27;s leading comedic actor. Later in 1909, Gasnier returned from Italy and immediately began working with Linder again. The team made several shorts in 1909 with Linder in various roles, such as a blind elderly man and a coquettish young woman. But they soon discovered that the character of &quot;Max&quot; was the most popular with audiences and stuck with him from then on. Among the popular &quot;Max&quot; films made by Linder and Grasnier in 1909 are &quot;A Young Lady Killer&quot; and &quot;The Cure for Cowardice&quot;.

By 1910, Linder had proved himself to Pathé and was quickly becoming one of the most popular film actors in the world. When Gasnier was sent to the United States later that year to oversee Pathé&#x27;s productions there, Lucien Nonguet took over as Linder&#x27;s director. Together they made such films as &quot;Max Takes a Bath&quot; and the autobiographical &quot;Max Linder&#x27;s Film Debut&quot;, which fictitiously recreates the legend of Linder&#x27;s early film career and includes Charles Pathé as himself.

By the end of the year, Linder had become the most popular film actor in the world. Although actress Florence Lawrence is often referred to as &quot;The First Movie Star&quot; in the United States, Linder appears to be the very first worldwide movie star with a major following. In Russia, he was voted the most popular film actor, ahead of Asta Nielsen. He also had a Russian impersonator, Zozlov, and a devoted fan in Czar Nicholas II. Another professed fan was British playwright George Bernard Shaw. The first feature film ever made in Bulgaria was a remake of one of Linder&#x27;s earlier movies. He was offered $12,000 to spend a month in Berlin making public appearances with his film screenings, but had to decline for health reasons. In France, a Max Linder movie theater had opened in Paris.

At the height of his fame, Linder ended 1910 with a serious illness. He was forced to stop making films when appendicitis left him bedridden, and some newspapers reported that he had died. He eventually recovered the following spring and began making films again in May 1911.
In 1911, Linder returned to filmmaking and began co-directing his own films (with René LePrince) as well as writing the scripts. By 1912, he was the solo director of his films. Gaining complete control over his own films brought positive results both critically and commercially; the films Linder made during this period are generally considered to be his best. &quot;Max, Victim of Quinine&quot; is considered by film critic Jean Mitry to be &quot;his masterpiece.&quot; In the film, an intoxicated &quot;Max&quot; gets into numerous fights with such dignitaries as the Minister of War, an ambassador and the police commissioner, all of whom challenge him to a duel and present him with their business cards. Eventually &quot;Max&quot; is apprehended by the police, who attempt to return him to his residence, but end up mistakenly taking him to the homes of the various men whom he had previously fought with.

The universality of silent films brought Linder fame and fortune throughout Europe, making him the highest paid entertainer of the day, with a salary increase of 150,000 francs (the average monthly salary in France was 100 francs at the time). He began touring Europe with his films from 1911 to 1912, including Spain, where he entertained thousands of fans at the Barcelona railway station, Austria, and Russia, where he was accompanied on piano by a young Dimitri Tiomkin. In 1912 after the tour, Linder demanded and received a salary of one million francs a year, and Charles Pathé used the huge sum to generate publicity, with an ad reading &quot;We understand that the shackles which bind Max Linder have attained the value of one million francs a year...the imagination boggles at such a figure!&quot; This set a precedent in the entertainment industry for actors&#x27; salaries that would become a staple of the Hollywood system, but privately Pathé nicknamed Linder &quot;The Napoleon of the Cinema&quot;.

The high point of Linder&#x27;s career was from 1912 to 1914. His films were made with increased skill and &quot;Max&quot; was at his funniest. He made such films as &quot;Max Virtuoso&quot;, &quot;Max Does Not Speak English&quot;, &quot;Max and His Dog&quot;, &quot;Max&#x27;s Hat&quot; and &quot;Max and the Jealous Husband&quot;. His ensemble of actors included Stacia Napierkowska, Jane Renouardt, Gaby Morlay, and occasional performances from the young actors Abel Gance and Maurice Chevalier. Linder had given Chevalier his start in movies, but the silent medium did not suit Chevalier, who stuck to the stage until the all-singing all-dancing features came in, many years later.

The outbreak of World War I brought a temporary end to Linder&#x27;s film career in 1914, but not before he made the short patriotic film &quot;The Second of August&quot; that year. Linder attempted to enlist in the French army, but was physically unfit for combat duty. Instead he worked as a dispatch driver between Paris and the front lines. Many conflicting stories about the reasons behind his dismissal from the army exist, including that he was shot through the lung, and seriously wounded. Initially, it was reported by one newspaper that he had been killed; Linder actually phoned the offending publishers, leading them to run the headline &quot;Max Linder Not Killed&quot;. However, others have asserted that he became infected with pneumonia after hiding from a German patrol in icy water for several hours. After being dismissed from his duties, Linder spent the remainder of the war entertaining the troops and making films. It was also during this period that Linder had his first serious bout with chronic depression.

===Move to the U.S. and career decline 1916–1925===

In 1916, Linder was approached by American film producer George K. Spoor, the president of the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company, to make twelve short films for him in the US at a salary of $5,000 a week. Earlier that year, Charlie Chaplin, then the most popular comedian in the world, had left Essanay for more money and independence at Mutual Film and Spoor wanted to replace Chaplin with Max Linder, whose pantomime skills were arguably equally accomplished. Linder was offered a new contract from Charles Pathé, but accepted Spoor&#x27;s offer and moved to the United States to work for Essanay later that year. Unfortunately his first few American-made &quot;Max&quot; films were unpopular both critically and financially. The first two, &quot;Max Comes Across&quot; and &quot;Max Wants a Divorce&quot; were complete failures, but the third film, &quot;Max and his Taxi&quot; was moderately successful. The financially troubled studio may have been counting on Linder to restore its flagging fortunes and cancelled production of the remaining films on Linder&#x27;s contract. &quot;Max and his Taxi&quot; had been shot in Hollywood and while there Linder had developed a close friendship with Charlie Chaplin. They would often attend events such as boxing matches or car races together, and according to writer Jack Spears, &quot;while working on a picture Linder would go next door to Chaplin&#x27;s home and discuss the day&#x27;s shooting. The two often sat until dawn, developing and refining the gags. Chaplin&#x27;s suggestions were invaluable, Linder said.&quot;

Linder returned to France in 1917 and opened a movie theater, the Ciné Max Linder. However, due to his depression and anxiety about the still ongoing war, he was unable to continue making films on a regular basis, and was often quoted by journalists about the horrors of the front lines. After the Armistice in 1918, Linder was able to regain his enthusiasm and agreed to make a film with director Raymond Bernard, the feature length &quot;The Little Café&quot; in 1919. In the film, Linder plays a waiter who suddenly becomes a millionaire, but simultaneously is tricked into a twenty-year contract to be a waiter by the cafe owner. The film made over a million francs in Europe and briefly revived his career, but was financially unsuccessful in the US.

Four years after failing to become a major star in the U.S., Linder made another attempt at filmmaking in Hollywood and formed his own production company there in 1921. His first film back in the U.S. was &quot;Seven Years Bad Luck&quot;, considered by some to be his best film. The film contains one of the earliest (though not the first) examples on film of the &quot;human mirror&quot; gag best known in the scene between Groucho and Harpo Marx in &quot;Duck Soup&quot; twelve years later. Linder next made &quot;Be My Wife&quot; later that year, but again neither films were able to find a major audience in the U.S.

Linder then decided to dispense with the &quot;Max&quot; character and try something different for his third (and final) attempt: &quot;The Three Must-Get-Theres&quot; in 1922. The film is a satire of swashbuckling films made by Douglas Fairbanks and is loosely based on the plot of Alexander Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. The film was praised by Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin, but again failed at the box office. At the films premiere, Linder had said to director Robert Florey &quot;You see, Bob, I sense that I&#x27;m no longer funny; I have so many preoccupations that I can no longer concentrate on my film character ... The public is mildly amused by my situations, but this evening where were the explosions of laughter that we hear when Charlie&#x27;s on the screen?...Make people laugh, its easy to say make people laugh, but I don&#x27;t feel funny anymore.&quot;

With his depression making it difficult for him to work, Linder returned to France in 1922 and shortly afterwards made a semi-serious film: &quot;Au Secours!&quot; (&quot;Help!&quot;) for director Abel Gance. The film is essentially a horror film set in a haunted house, with occasional moments of comedy by Linder. The film was released in England in 1924 and was critically praised, however the legal copyright of the film prevented it from being released in France or the US for several years. Linder&#x27;s last film was &quot;The King of the Circus&quot; directed by Édouard-Émile Violet (with pre-production collaboration from Jacques Feyder) and filmed in Vienna in 1925. In the film, &quot;Max&quot; joins a circus in order to be closer to the woman that he loves. The film includes such gags as a hungover &quot;Max&quot; waking up in a department store and the film&#x27;s plot is similar to the Charlie Chaplin film &quot;The Circus&quot; (1928). In late 1925, Linder was working on pre-production for his next film &quot;Barkas le fol&quot;, which would never be made.

==Marriage and death==
As a consequence of his war service, Linder had continuing health problems, including bouts of severe depression and several mental breakdowns. It has been said that he evoked &quot;tantrum-like appearances at the studio&quot;. Director Édouard-Émile Violet recalled that Linder seemed invariably &quot;unstable, worried...&quot; Linder also became a heavy user of opium in the 1920s, which could have further harrowed his mind.

During his war service, Linder was involved in a car accident; he was thrown out of the vehicle and badly injured.

In early April 1923, Linder was involved in a second near fatal car accident in Nice, which resulted in a head injury. He was arrested in Nice later that month for &quot;kidnapping a minor&quot;, who happened to be his future wife, the seventeen-year-old Hélène &quot;Ninette&quot; Peters. They had planned to run away to Monte Carlo.

Upon Linder and Peters&#x27; first encounter at a hotel in Chamonix, Linder was entranced by her, exclaiming to a friend, &quot;I spent the whole night in a hotel lounge talking to the most extraordinary girl I could ever imagine. Instantly I knew this to be the woman in my life.&quot; They married on 2 August 1923 at the Parisian church of St. Honoré d&#x27;Eylau. The two lived in an apartment at 11 Bis Avenue Émile Deschanel.

Linder is said to have been a fiercely jealous and mentally abusive husband. He would often accuse his young wife of being unfaithful and threaten to &quot;end her&quot;. Whenever he went to town alone in the evenings, he would call her to make sure that she had not gone out without his consent.

Linder and his wife may have made a suicide pact. On 24 February 1924, they were both found unconscious at a hotel in Vienna, though this was explained as an accidental overdose of &quot;sleeping powder.&quot; In late October 1925, Max and Hélène reportedly attended a Paris screening of &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (in which two characters, Petronius and his slave Eunice, as a reporter put it, &quot;bleed themselves to death&quot;), and died in a similar manner. They drank Veronal, injected morphine and slashed their wrists. Peters died first, while Linder was unconscious throughout 31 October, with doctors fighting to keep him alive. He died after midnight on 1 November.

There is still some question, however, as to whether the deaths were really a result of a suicide pact, or whether Max murdered his much-younger wife or pressured her into killing herself. On 2 November 1925, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Hélène Linder had told her mother by letter that, &quot;He will kill me.&quot; The article also claims that &quot;no one believes she herself opened her veins.&quot; Critic Vincent Canby acknowledged in 1988 that &quot;Linder died with his young wife in what has sometimes been described as a suicide pact, and sometimes as a murder-suicide.&quot; In addition, Maud Linder reported in her memoir that the head of the workmen at Linder&#x27;s house in Neuilly overheard Max tell a friend, probably Armand Massard, that he planned to kill his wife along with himself, as he could not bear the thought of her belonging to another after he was gone.

Linder was buried at the Catholique cimetière de Saint-Loubès. His wife is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

==Legacy==
Upon receiving the news of Linder&#x27;s death, Chaplin is reported to have closed his studio for one day out of respect.

In the ensuing years, his jealous and alcoholic elder brother won custody of sixteen-month-old heiress Maud Linder to get the girl&#x27;s fortune, before her grandmother (Hélène&#x27;s mother) legally fought back and took over. Meanwhile, many of his films were lost because most reels had been buried unprotected in a garden. Max Linder had been relegated to little more than a footnote in film history until a compilation film titled &quot;Laugh with Max Linder&quot; premiered at the Venice Film Festival and was theatrically released. The film was a compilation of Linder&#x27;s last three films made in Hollywood and its release was supervised by Maud Linder.

In 1983, Maud Linder made a documentary film, &quot;The Man in the Silk Hat&quot;, about Linder&#x27;s life and career. It was screened out of competition at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival. In 1992, Maud Linder published a book about Linder in France, &quot;Max Linder was my father&quot; and in 2008 she received the Prix Henri Langlois for her work to promote her father&#x27;s legacy. In his honor, &quot;Lycée Max Linder&quot;, a public school in the city of Libourne in the Gironde département near his birthplace was given his name in 1981.

Linder&#x27;s influence on film comedy and particularly on slapstick films is that the genre shifted from the &quot;knockabout&quot; comedies made by such people as Mack Sennett and André Deed to a more subtle, refined and character driven medium that would later be dominated by Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and others. Linder&#x27;s influence on Chaplin is apparent both from Chaplin&#x27;s sometimes borrowing gags or entire plot-lines from Linder&#x27;s films, as well as from a famous signed photo that Chaplin sent Linder which read: &quot;To Max, the Professor, from his disciple, Charlie Chaplin.&quot; Mack Sennett and King Vidor also singled out Linder as a great influence on their directing careers. His high society characterizations as &quot;Max&quot; also influenced such actors as Adolphe Menjou and Raymond Griffith.

In his heyday, Linder had two major rivals in France: Léonce Perret and Charles Prince. Perret later became a successful director, but his early career included a series of &quot;Léonce&quot; slapstick shorts that were popular but nowhere near the stature of Linder&#x27;s films. Charles Prince, on the other hand, was gaining popularity during his career and was nearly equal to Linder by the beginning of World War I. Prince&#x27;s screen persona was &quot;Rigadin&quot;, who like &quot;Max&quot; was a bumbling bourgeois socialite who always got into trouble. Both Linder and Prince were employed by Pathé in the early 1910s and they often used the same story lines, sets and directors. Years after both comedians&#x27; careers were long over, Linder has received several revivals in interest while Charles Prince remains mostly forgotten.

==In popular media==
Linder is referenced in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; where the owner of a cinema in Nazi occupied Paris in 1944, Shosanna Dreyfus, says that she will be having a Max Linder festival. The relative merits of Linder and Chaplin are then discussed by the German soldier, Frederick Zoller, who argues that Linder is superior to Chaplin while also admitting that Linder never made anything as good as &quot;The Kid&quot;.
The documentary film &quot;The Mystery of the King of Kinema&quot; portraits Linder and his impact through interviews (including Maud Linder), silent film excerpts and the Spanish-American actor Julio Perillán characterized as Linder and voicing answers from old press interviews. 
Perillán was nominated to the Goya awards for best lead actor.

<text>Skelton Barnaby Knaggs (27 June 1911 – 30 April 1955) was an English stage actor who also appeared in films, especially in horror films.

==Biography==
Knaggs was born in the Hillsborough district of Sheffield, England. Knaggs moved to London where he trained as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and subsequently became a Shakespearean actor. In addition to appearing on stage in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, Knaggs appeared in a few British films, including an uncredited role as a German orderly in Michael Powell&#x27;s &quot;The Spy in Black&quot;.
At some point he moved to Los Angeles, California, and found work as a character actor in Hollywood. Diminutive and distinctive-looking, with a strongly featured pock-marked face and charismatically voiced with an English Midlands provincial accent, he was cast in sinister roles, often in horror films. These ranged from uncredited bit parts to prominent roles in the Sherlock Holmes thriller &quot;Terror by Night&quot;, the all-star monster rally &quot;House of Dracula&quot; and three Val Lewton productions including &quot;The Ghost Ship&quot;. In the last, a voice-over narrative by Knaggs is heard, representing the thoughts of his character, a mute seaman.

Back in London, he married Thelma Crawshaw in 1949, then returned to Hollywood. The last film in which he appeared was Fritz Lang&#x27;s period adventure based on J. Meade Falkner&#x27;s novel &quot;Moonfleet&quot;.

==Death==
An alcoholic, Knaggs died of cirrhosis of the liver in Los Angeles in 1955 at the age of 43. His body was buried in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles.

<doc id="1115128" wikidata="Q921262" url="?curid=1115128" title="Francis King">
<text>Francis Henry King (4 March 19233 July 2011) was a British novelist and short-story writer. He worked for the British Council for 15 years, with positions in Europe and Japan. For 25 years, he was a chief book reviewer for the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, and for 10 years its theatre critic.

==Early life and Council career==
King was born on 4 March 1923 in Adelboden, Switzerland, to a father in the Indian Civil Service, brought up in British India and sent back to England when his father was dying. As a boy, he was shunted around among aunts and uncles.

He was educated at Shrewsbury School and Balliol College, Oxford. During the Second World War he was a conscientious objector and left Oxford to work on the land.

After completing his degree in 1949, King worked for the British Council. His positions with them took him to Italy, Salonika, and finally Kyoto. While he was in Greece he met the uninhibited writer Anne Cumming, who was also working for the British Council. She enjoyed observing his homosexual adventures. In 1964 he resigned to write full-time, by then he had already published nine novels, as well as poetry and a memoir.

==Literary career==
He won the Somerset Maugham Award for his novel &quot;The Dividing Stream&quot; (1951) and also won the Katherine Mansfield Short Story Prize. In 2000, he was awarded the Golden PEN Award by English PEN for &quot;a Lifetime&#x27;s Distinguished Service to Literature&quot;.

His 1956 book &quot;The Firewalkers&quot; was published pseudonymously under the name Frank Cauldwell.

From 1986 to 1989 he was President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers and oldest human rights organisation. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and was appointed an Officer (OBE) of the Order of the British Empire in 1979 and a Commander of the Order (CBE) in 1985. In 2003, his novel &quot;The Nick of Time&quot; was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize.

==Personal life==
King came out as homosexual in the 1970s. After his long-term partner had died from AIDS in 1988, King described their relationship in &quot;Yesterday Came Suddenly&quot; (1993). King suffered a stroke in 2005.

==Death==
Francis King died on 3 July 2011, at the age of 88.

<text>Lilla Cabot Perry (born Lydia Cabot; January 13, 1848 – February 28, 1933) was an American artist who worked in the American Impressionist style, rendering portraits and landscapes in the free form manner of her mentor, Claude Monet. Perry was an early advocate of the French Impressionist style and contributed to its reception in the United States. Perry&#x27;s early work was shaped by her exposure to the Boston School of artists and her travels in Europe and Japan. She was also greatly influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s philosophies and her friendship with Camille Pissarro. Although it was not until the age of thirty-six that Perry received formal training, her work with artists of the Impressionist, Realist, Symbolist, and German Social Realist movements greatly affected the style of her oeuvre.

==Early life==
Lydia (Lilla) Cabot was born January 13, 1848, in Boston, Massachusetts. Her father was Dr. Samuel Cabot III, a distinguished surgeon. Her mother was Hannah Lowell Jackson Cabot. She was the eldest of eight children, three being Samuel Cabot IV (b. 1850), chemist and founder of Valspar&#x27;s Cabot Stains; Dr. Arthur Tracy Cabot (b. 1852), a progressive surgeon; and Godfrey Lowell Cabot (b. 1861), founder of Cabot Corporation. Her family was prominent in Boston society, and friends of the family included Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and James Russell Lowell, who was her mother&#x27;s cousin and respected Lilla&#x27;s independent spirit, &quot;scorn of ignoble things,&quot; and &quot;alert nature.&quot; Lowell&#x27;s daughter and Lilla&#x27;s cousin, Mabel, was a close companion. Perry recalled having the opportunity to play the game &quot;fox and geese&quot; with both Emerson and Alcott. She had lending privileges at the Boston Athenæum, through her father, who was a proprietor, and her mother&#x27;s family.

Perry studied literature, language, poetry, and music and had informal sketching sessions with her friends. As a child she additionally enjoyed reading books and playing sports outdoors. Perry was thirteen years old when the Civil War began. Her parents were ardent abolitionists and took an active role in the war effort by providing care to wounded soldiers and helping to protect runaway slaves. At seventeen, when the Civil War ended, Perry moved with her family to a farm in Canton, Massachusetts, where much of her early interest in landscapes and nature was shaped. She traveled with her parents in 1867 to Europe, where she studied painting.

==Marriage==

On April 9, 1874, she married Thomas Sergeant Perry, a Harvard alumnus scholar and linguist. His granduncle was Matthew C. Perry, Commodore of the United States Navy. The couple had three daughters: Margaret (1876), Edith (1880), and Alice (1884).

==Education and early career==

Perry completed what is considered to be her earliest known painting, &quot;Portrait of an Infant&quot; (Margaret Perry) dating from 1877 to 1878. This work draws on the inspiration that would occupy much of her artwork throughout her career – her children.

===Boston===
In 1884, Perry began her formal artistic training with the portrait painter Alfred Quinton Collins. Collins had studied at the Académie Julian in Paris under the guidance of Léon Bonnat. Perry&#x27;s &quot;The Beginner&quot;, c. 1885–86, represents the first work she completed under formal guidance. &quot;The Beginner&quot; echoes Collins’ influences with the sitter&#x27;s serious gaze, dark background, and emphasis on dramatic lighting.

In 1885, Perry&#x27;s father died and left her an inheritance that allowed her to more seriously study art. In January 1886, she began to study with Robert Vonnoh, an artist who worked in the Impressionist&#x27;s &quot;en plein air&quot; style at Grez-sur-Loing in France. She took classes with instructor Dennis Bunker at Cowles Art School in Boston beginning in November 1886. Cowles taught its students &quot;liberal theories&quot; in the creation of realist art – theories that Perry greatly responded to.

===Paris===
Perry was commissioned by Aaron Lufkin Dennison, a founder of the Waltham Watch Company, to paint his three daughters. She earned sufficient money to travel first-class passage to Europe in June 1887. The Perrys moved to Paris that year. Perry enrolled in the Académie Colarossi, where she worked with Gustave Courtois and Joseph Blanc. She studied with Felix Borchardt, a German painter. In addition to receiving formal academic training, Perry spent much of her time studying the old masters in museums with Bernard Berenson, an art critic and her husband&#x27;s friend. She also traveled to Spain to copy works at the Museo del Prado. Perry&#x27;s &quot;The Red Hat&quot; from 1888 strongly reflects the formal training she had received and her exposure to the old masters, especially the work of Sandro Botticelli.

In 1888, Perry traveled to Munich, where she studied with the German social realist Fritz von Uhde. Uhde&#x27;s handling of the subject and his use of color had a dynamic effect on Perry&#x27;s work. By the fall of 1888, Perry had returned to Paris. She studied at Académie Julian with Tony Robert-Fleury.

With the encouragement of Walter Gay, Perry submitted two paintings she had recently completed to the Société des Artistes Indépendants. The portraits of her husband Thomas Sergeant Perry (1889) and of her daughter Edith Perry (1889) were accepted by the Salon, and with this accomplishment Perry&#x27;s career began in France.

Perry&#x27;s success in 1889 made it possible for her to be one of the select few admitted to Alfred Stevens&#x27; class in Paris. Stevens was known for his &quot;elegant interiors featuring genteel ladies lost in their reveries.&quot; While in Paris, she became friends with Mary Cassatt, Camille Pissarro, and Claude Monet.

==Career==

===Giverny===
In 1889, Perry first encountered Claude Monet&#x27;s work in Georges Petit&#x27;s gallery. Inspired by his work, the Perrys spent the next summer in Giverny, where Monet lived, in order to further expose Lilla to the Impressionist&#x27;s style. Between 1889 and 1909, Perry spent nine summers in Giverny. It was there that she fully found herself as an artist. During her time in Giverny, she formed a close friendship with Claude Monet, whose impressionistic handling of color and light greatly inspired her work. In addition, she also worked with a cadre of American artists who had found their way to Giverny, including Theodore Robinson, John Leslie Breck, and Theodore Earl Butler.
A distinct shift can be observed in Perry&#x27;s work after she arrived in Giverny. Her &quot;La Petite Angèle, II&quot; (1889), illustrates the dramatic evolution of her style during this period. Unlike her earlier portraits, such as &quot;The Letter&quot;, which relied on more traditional techniques to carefully render the subject matter, &quot;La Petite Angèle, II&quot;, is clearly impressionistic in style with its free form brushstrokes that capture the impression of light and color. Rather than blending together each brushstroke, Perry allowed the composition to be &quot;raw,&quot; thus allowing a vibrancy to be imbued in the canvas that was not possible in her earlier works. Giverny and, more specifically, Claude Monet inspired Perry to work with &quot;en plein air&quot; forms, impressionistic brushstrokes, soft colors, and poppy red. In the window of&quot; La Petite Angèle, II&quot;, we see the beginnings of what would become Perry&#x27;s love affair with the Impressionist&#x27;s handling of the landscape theme.

By the fall of 1889, Perry had departed from Giverny to tour Belgium and the Netherlands. She had returned to Boston with her family in 1891 with a painting by Monet and a series of landscapes by John Breck.

===Return to Boston===

Perry&#x27;s artistic career took on new meaning when she returned to Boston. She was not content to simply paint in the new style she had acquired while overseas. More than this, she was inspired to &quot;foster a new truth in painting&quot; in the Boston art community, which was not responsive to the new Impressionist modes. In 1890, Perry helped to organize the first public exhibition of John Breck&#x27;s landscapes at the St. Botolph Club.

Perry won a silver medal in 1892 exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association. In 1893 Perry was chosen to represent Massachusetts at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Perry had seven works displayed at the exhibition, of which four of the compositions were worked in the &quot;en plein air&quot; style (&quot;Petite Angèle, I, An Open Air Concert, Reflections, Child in a Window&quot;) and three were more formal studio portraits (&quot;Portrait of a Child, Child with a Violoncello, Portrait Study of a Child&quot;).

In 1894, Perry had achieved another success when her Impressionist paintings were exhibited in Boston at the St. Botolph Club with other artists, including Edmund C. Tarbell (1862–1938), Philip Leslie Hale (1865–1931), Theodore Wendel (1859–1932), Frederick Porter Vinton (1846–1911), and Dawson Dawson-Watson (1864–1939). Not only did this exhibition reveal that Perry&#x27;s work was being accepted in America, it also proved that Impressionism was finally starting to be accepted as an art form outside of Europe. Perry also held an exhibit of Monet&#x27;s work at the Boston Art Students Association that year.

Between 1894 and 1897, Perry&#x27;s work achieved international acclaim. Not only was she able to exhibit her work in Boston, she also regularly exhibited at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts at the &quot;Salon de Champ de Mars&quot; during this time. The year 1897 brought another exhibition for Perry at the St. Botolph Club. A &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot; critic said of her work, &quot;Mrs. Perry is one of the most genuine, no-nonsense, natural painters that we know of... Such paintings must be taken seriously.&quot; Unlike her previous exhibition at the same location, this exhibit was a solo show featuring the breadth of Perry&#x27;s artistic achievements up until that point, including Impressionist portraits and landscapes.

===Japan===

A new inspiration entered Perry&#x27;s life in 1897 when her husband received a teaching position in Japan as an English professor at the Keio Gijuku University. Lilla Perry met Okakura Kakuzō, one of the Imperial Art School co-founders. For three years Perry resided in Japan and took full advantage of its unique artistic community. In October 1898, Perry exhibited her work in Tokyo, with the assistance of Kakuzō, and became an honorary member of the Nippon Bijutsu-In Art Association. Perry&#x27;s involvement with the Asian art world greatly influenced her work and made it possible for her to develop a unique style that brought together western and eastern aesthetic traditions. Her &quot;Meditation&quot;, &quot;Child in a Kimono&quot;, and &quot;Young Girl with an Orange&quot; vibrantly illustrate the distinct changes that occurred in her work during her stay in Japan. Unlike her earlier works, these compositions draw on uniquely eastern subject matter and show a strong influence of the clean lines from Japanese prints. The result of this blending of east and west is striking, with Impressionist portraits flowing seamlessly with the well-organized, balanced compositions that the eastern art world was known for at the time. Mount Fuji became the subject of 35 or more of her paintings, and she made a total of more than 80 paintings while in Japan.

===Boston and Paris===
By 1901, Perry had returned to Boston to the Perrys&#x27; home on Marlborough Street, and two years later the Perrys bought a farmhouse in Hancock, New Hampshire, as a summer house. It was during her time in Hancock that Perry conceived &quot;Boy Fishing&quot; (1929), which featured a local farm boy (known to be Robert Eaton Richardson Sr.), a painting that is now part of the White House Art Collection. In 1904, her &quot;Portrait of Mrs. Joseph Clark Grew [Alice Perry]&quot; won a bronze medal at the prestigious International Louisiana Purchase Exhibition in St. Louis. The upcoming years would prove to be difficult for Perry&#x27;s personal life. In 1905, she returned to France, and by the winter of the same year, her health had collapsed. Frequent moves and losses from unprofitable investments, along with having spent most of the inheritance from her father, meant that Perry constantly needed to commission portraits to support the family, which took a toll on her health.

===Return to America===

In 1908, Perry returned to Boston, but she focused on portraits because they were more marketable than her landscapes. She regained her health and had six of her paintings exhibited in Paris at the Salon des Indépendants, including &quot;Dans un Bateau&quot; and &quot;Le Paravent Jaune&quot; in 1908. In November 1909, Perry returned to America with a newfound inspiration for her work. The following year, she demonstrated her renewed enthusiasm for her art by creating a rare urban view for her oeuvre, &quot;The State House, Boston&quot; (1910). She was a founding member of The Guild of Boston Artists (1914). By 1915, Perry had received yet another bronze medal at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California for her portrait, &quot;Hildegarde&quot;, the daughter of a friend. In 1916, she painted a portrait of Edwin Arlington Robinson, who wrote a biography of her husband for &quot;The Dictionary of American Biography&quot;. Robinson often visited the Perrys at their house in Hancock, New Hampshire.

Throughout her career as an artist, Perry was deeply engaged in the artistic communities of whatever town she lived in and actively promoted Impressionism&#x27;s style. The passage of time did not cause Perry&#x27;s passions to wane. In 1913, Perry helped to form the ultra-conservative Guild of Boston Artists in order to oppose the art world&#x27;s avant-garde trends. Perry was dissatisfied by the “modern art&quot; that was taking hold. In 1920, Perry received a commemoration for giving six years of loyal service to the Guild.

In 1922, she had her first solo exhibition in New York, which included her landscapes from Japan and Giverny. A &quot;New York Morning Telegrapher&quot; review called it &quot;one of the most exciting exhibitions given by a woman in this city in years.&quot;

===Final years===

By 1923, Perry&#x27;s book of poetry, &quot;The Jar of Dreams,&quot; was published. It included a poem of her appreciation for Japan and New England:

:The sun breaks forth and now my plum tree smiles,
:Charming its feathery burden into dew,
:That all its flowers may drink a health to Spring!
:For February in Japan beguiles
:Even my homesick heart from thoughts of you,
:New England, still icebound and blustering.

The same year she became critically ill with diphtheria while her daughter Edith had a complete mental health collapse and was sent to a private mental health institution in Wellesley. Perry spent the next two years in convalescence in Charleston, South Carolina. During this time, she found new inspiration for her landscape theme and executed works such as &quot;Road from Charleston to Savannah&quot; and &quot;A Field, Late Afternoon, Charleston, South Carolina&quot;. It was also during her time in Charleston that Perry found a new theme for her landscapes, what she referred to as &quot;snowscapes.&quot; Two examples of her snowscapes include &quot;A Snowy Monday&quot; (1926) and &quot;After First Snow&quot; (1926).

In 1927, there was an exhibition in February at the Gordon Dunthorne Gallery. She published &quot;Reminiscences of Claude Monet from 1889 to 1909&quot; first in 1927 in the &quot;Magazine of Art&quot;. The following year, on May 7, 1928, Thomas Sergeant Perry died after having been sick with pneumonia. After a period of mourning, Perry again allowed her work to be exhibited at the Guild of Boston Artists – the organization she helped to establish – in 1929 and then again in 1931. Many of her landscapes were showcased in the exhibition, including &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; (1926), &quot;Lakeside Reflections&quot; (1929–1931), and &quot;Snow, Ice, Mist&quot; (1929).

Perry painted winter scenes, which reflected an abstract influence, at her Hancock, New Hampshire, vacation home. &quot;Mist on the Mountain&quot; (1931) was her last exhibited landscape. She continued to paint until her death.

Lilla Cabot Perry died on February 28, 1933. Her ashes, and those of her husband, who died in 1928, are buried at the Pine Ridge Cemetery in Hancock, New Hampshire.

==Legacy==

Hirschl &amp; Adler Galleries held a retrospective of her work in 1969, and the Boston Athenæum exhibited her works in March 1982. Her blending of eastern and western aesthetics and her sensitive visions of the feminine and natural worlds offered significant stylistic contributions to both the American and French Impressionist schools.

Her vocal advocacy for the Impressionist movement helped to make it possible for other American Impressionists, such as Mary Cassatt, to gain the exposure and acceptance they needed in the states. She furthered the American careers of her close friends Claude Monet and John Breck by lecturing stateside on their talents and showcasing their works. She also worked closely with Camille Pissarro to assist him in his dire financial situation by selling his work to friends and family in America.

<text>Surat Thani International Airport is an international airport in Hua Toei subdistrict, Phunphin district, Surat Thani province in Southern Thailand. The airport, 21 kilometres west of downtown Surat Thani, is also home to the Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) squadrons. It has a single paved runway and is the tenth-busiest airport in Thailand in terms of passengers, handling more than two million passengers annually.

==Airlines and destinations==

== Statistics ==
=== Passengers ===
== History ==

=== Donnok airport ===
Surat Thani Airport&#x27;s predecessor is known locally as Donnok Airport (). It is located in Makham Tia subdistrict, Mueang Surat Thani district, around away from Surat Thani City, and has a single, gravel paved runway, 800 meters in length. Later, the runway was expanded by the Royal Thai Air Force to 1,000 metres, which was still only capable of handling small planes, such as the Douglas DC-3.

=== The current airport ===
Due to the original airport&#x27;s close proximity to Surat Thani, The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) planned a new airport away from the city. A former airfield used in World War II by the military was chosen as the site for the new airport. After the construction site was chosen, a plan for the airfield&#x27;s development was proposed. However, in 1973, the government suspended the development project and used the funds to support Phuket International Airport&#x27;s operations instead.

In 1975, many residents in Surat Thani called for the project&#x27;s reconsideration. The Ministry of Defence and CAAT showed interest in the project and the airfield&#x27;s development began in 1978. The airport was officially opened on 15 April 1981. It had a single runway, 2,500 metres in length. In 1993, the runway was expanded to support larger commercial flights and military operations.

=== Future upgrades and developments ===
The Department of Airports announced a 1.7 billion Baht plan to upgrade the airport. Details of the project are as following:

# The airport&#x27;s apron will be expanded to increase its capacity up to 11 Boeing 737s at a time.
# The electrical system and wires will be moved underground.
# The airport terminal will be expanded to accommodate up to 3.6 million passengers a year. The car park will also be expanded to handle up to 700 cars at a time.
# The runway will be upgraded to increase its strength.
# Construction of the new transportation center to handle more passengers.

==Military use==
As well as being a commercial facility, Surat Thani Airport is an active RTAF base, the home of 4th Air Division/7th Wing Air Combat Command. 701 Squadron, &quot;Shark&quot;, flies twelve SAAB JAS-39 C/D Gripen fighter aircraft. 702 Squadron operates two airborne early warning (AEW) and two transport SAAB SF340 airplanes. A further two SF340s are on order.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 11 December 1998, Thai Airways International Flight 261, an Airbus A310-200 (HS-TIA, &quot;Phitsanulok&quot;), bound for Surat Thani from Bangkok, was making its third landing attempt in heavy rain when it crashed into a rice paddy about from the airport; 101 of the 146 passengers and crew aboard were killed.

<text>François-Louis David Bocion (; 30 March 1828 in Lausanne – 12 December 1890 in Lausanne) was a Swiss painter, designer and art professor, known primarily for his landscapes of the area around Lake Geneva.

== Biography ==
He was the youngest of five children born to the carpenter, Henri-Louis Bocion (1792-1835), who was originally from Bournens, and his wife Suzanne-Catherine. After his father&#x27;s death, the family&#x27;s financial situation became untenable and he was placed with his paternal grandfather, a marble sculptor, in Montreux. His grandfather, in turn, died in 1840 and François went to live with his mother&#x27;s family in Vevey, where he completed his primary education.

During those years, he was introduced to drawing by Christian-Gottlieb Steinlen (1779-1847) and François Bonnet (1811-1894). This inspired him to visit Paris in 1846, where he frequented the studios of Louis-Aimé Grosclaude and Charles Gleyre at the École des Beaux-arts. He also made friends with Gustave Courbet. After a bout with typhoid fever, he returned to Lausanne.

He held his first showing with the &quot;Société des beaux-arts&quot; (Turnus), shortly thereafter. From 1849 until his death, he was a Professor of Drawing at the École industrielle de Lausanne and designed the school&#x27;s student uniform. He was a regular contributor of cartoons to the satirical journal, &quot;La Guêpe&quot; (The Wasp) from 1851 to 1854. Until 1858, he made numerous trips to Italy. His painting of Venice was purchased by the Canton of Vaud and hangs in the meeting room of the Council of State. He also took private students, notably Théophile Steinlen and Eugène Grasset.

In 1859, he married Anna-Barbara Furrer. They had nine children, five of whom died in infancy.

After 1888, he was a member of the . His works may be seen at the , the Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts and the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg. A pedestrian passage in Lausanne was named after him in 1924.

<doc id="1115147" wikidata="Q7857778" url="?curid=1115147" title="Twenty 1">
<text>Twenty 1 is the seventeenth studio album (and twenty-first overall) by the American band Chicago. Released on January 29, 1991, it was their first album of the 1990s. &quot;Twenty 1&quot; spent eleven weeks on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at position No. 66, and did not chart in the UK.

== Production ==
The production of &quot;Twenty 1&quot; saw a significant personnel reconfiguration. The recent departure of founding drummer Danny Seraphine had made way for the band&#x27;s &quot;great new drummer&quot; Tris Imboden. Session player John Keane played the majority of this album&#x27;s drum tracks. Their touring guitarist since 1986, Dawayne Bailey, performed as an extra guitarist for &quot;Twenty 1&quot;″s sessions.

The band retained producer Ron Nevison, who&#x27;d already done &quot;Chicago 19&quot;. According to Nevison, work on the album was somewhat fragmented, with the band members rarely being in the studio together, and with work continuing with session musicians while the band was on tour. The fragmentation was furthered when Humberto Gatica was assigned to mix the final version of the album without Nevison&#x27;s input.

Although the music for &quot;Twenty 1&quot; was considered commercially viable, the shifting of popular musical trends toward the impending grunge movement is said to have lost Chicago some valuable radio support. Nevison maintains that if his original mixes had been used, he&#x27;d have been much happier and the album could have theoretically been more successful: &quot;It all would have worked if they’d left it alone. I promise you.&quot; The single &quot;Chasin&#x27; the Wind&quot; peaked at No. 39 and &quot;Twenty 1&quot; peaked at #66 during its eleven-week period on the charts, making it their second least successful non-greatest hits album, only behind &quot;Chicago XIV&quot;.

For what was intended to be the band&#x27;s twenty-second album, &quot;Stone of Sisyphus&quot;, Chicago hired producer Peter Wolf to develop what could be considered a more ambitious and experimental effort. That 1994 release was indefinitely postponed, and then finally released more than fourteen years later on June 17, 2008 as &quot;Chicago XXXII: Stone of Sisyphus&quot;. A demo &quot;Love Is Forever&quot; from the &quot;Twenty 1&quot; sessions was included on the &quot;Sisyphus&quot; release.

Three singles were released: &quot;Chasin&#x27; the Wind&quot; (B-side &quot;Only Time Can Heal the Wounded&quot;) in January 1991, &quot;Explain It to My Heart&quot; (B-side &quot;God Save The Queen&quot;) in April 1991, and &quot;You Come to My Senses&quot; (B-side &quot;Who Do You Love&quot;) in August 1991. &quot;Twenty 1&quot; would be Chicago&#x27;s last full-length album release of original songs until &quot;Chicago XXX&quot; in 2006.
== Reception ==

&quot;Twenty 1&quot; spent eleven weeks on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at position No. 66, and did not chart in the UK.

<text>Jean Gabin Alexis Moncorgé (born Jean-Alexis Moncorgé), known as Jean Gabin (; 17 May 190415 November 1976), was a French actor and singer. Considered a key figure in French cinema, he starred in several classic films, including &quot;Pépé le Moko&quot; (1937), &quot;La grande illusion&quot; (1937), &quot;Le Quai des brumes&quot; (1938), &quot;La bête humaine&quot; (1938), &quot;Le jour se lève&quot; (1939), and &quot;Le plaisir&quot; (1952). During his career, he twice won the Silver Bear for Best Actor from the Berlin International Film Festival and the Volpi Cup for Best Actor from the Venice Film Festival, respectively. Gabin was made a member of the Légion d&#x27;honneur in recognition of the important role he played in French cinema.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Gabin was born Jean-Alexis Moncorgé in Paris, the son of Madeleine Petit and Ferdinand Moncorgé, a cafe owner and cabaret entertainer whose stage name was Gabin, which is a first name in French. He grew up in the village of Mériel in the Seine-et-Oise (now Val-d&#x27;Oise) département, about 22 mi (35 km) north of Paris. He attended the Lycée Janson de Sailly. Gabin left school early, and worked as a laborer until the age of 19 when he entered show business with a bit part in a Folies Bergère production. He continued performing in a variety of minor roles before going into the military.

===Career===

====Early days====
After completing his military service in the Fusiliers marins, he returned to the entertainment business, working under the stage name of Jean Gabin at whatever was offered in the Parisian music halls and operettas, imitating the singing style of Maurice Chevalier, which was the rage at the time. He was part of a troupe that toured South America, and upon returning to France found work at the Moulin Rouge. His performances started getting noticed, and better stage roles came along that led to parts in two silent films in 1928.

Two years later Gabin made the transition to sound films in a 1930 Pathé Frères production, &quot;Chacun sa chance&quot;. Playing secondary roles, he made more than a dozen films over the next four years, including films directed by Maurice and Jacques Tourneur. But he only gained real recognition for his performance in &quot;Maria Chapdelaine&quot;, a 1934 production directed by Julien Duvivier. He was then cast as a romantic hero in the 1936 war drama &quot;La Bandera&quot;; this second Duvivier-directed film established him as a major star. The next year he teamed up with Duvivier again in the highly successful &quot;Pépé le Moko&quot;. Its popularity brought Gabin international recognition. That same year he starred in Jean Renoir&#x27;s &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot;, an antiwar film that ran at a New York City theatre for an unprecedented six months. This was followed by another of Renoir&#x27;s major works, &quot;La Bête Humaine&quot; (&quot;The Human Beast&quot;), a film noir tragedy based on the novel by Émile Zola and starring Gabin and Simone Simon, as well as &quot;Le Quai Des Brumes&quot; (&quot;Port of Shadows&quot;), one of director Marcel Carné&#x27;s classics of poetic realism. His rugged charisma could be compared with Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney. 

He divorced his second wife in 1939.

====Hollywood====

In the late 1930s Gabin was flooded with offers from Hollywood, but turned them all down until the outbreak of World War II. After the German occupation of France in 1940, he joined Renoir and Duvivier in the United States. During his time in Hollywood, Gabin began a romance with actress Marlene Dietrich that lasted until 1948.
His films in America—&quot;Moontide&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Impostor&quot; (1944), the latter with Duvivier—were not successful.

====World War II action====
Undaunted, Gabin joined General Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French Forces and earned the Médaille militaire and a Croix de Guerre for his wartime valor fighting with the Allies in North Africa. Following D-Day, Gabin served with the 2nd armored division that liberated Paris.

====Career slump====
In 1945 Carné chose Gabin to star in the film &quot;Gates of the Night&quot; with Dietrich as his co-star. She disliked the screenplay and feared her German accent would not go over well with postwar French audiences. When she withdrew from the project, Gabin followed suit, leading to a falling out with Carné. He found a French producer and director willing to cast him and Dietrich together, but the film, &quot;Martin Roumagnac&quot;, was not a success and their personal relationship soon ended. In 1948 Gabin starred in René Clément&#x27;s poetic realist film &quot;The Walls of Malapaga&quot; (), which won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Picture but garnered little recognition for Gabin. In 1949 he starred in his only role in legitimate theatre in Henri Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;La Soif&quot;. It ran in Paris for six months, with Gabin critically praised as &quot;a first-rate stage actor.&quot; Despite this recognition, his subsequent films did not do well at the French box office, and the next five years brought repeated failures.

====Comeback====
Gabin&#x27;s career seemed headed for oblivion until the 1954 film &quot;Touchez pas au grisbi&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Touch the Loot&quot;), directed by Jacques Becker, earned him critical acclaim. The film was very profitable internationally. He then worked once again with Renoir in &quot;French Cancan&quot;, with María Félix and Françoise Arnoul. Gabin played Georges Simenon&#x27;s detective Jules Maigret in three films in 1958, 1959 and 1963. Over the next 20 years, he made almost 50 more films, most of them very successful commercially and critically, including many for Gafer Films, his production partnership with fellow actor Fernandel. His co-stars included such leading figures of postwar cinema as Brigitte Bardot (&quot;En cas de malheur&quot;), Alain Delon (&quot;Le Clan des Siciliens&quot;, &quot;Mélodie en sous-sol&quot; and &quot;Deux hommes dans la ville&quot;), Jean-Paul Belmondo (&quot;Un singe en hiver&quot;) and Louis de Funès (&quot;Le Tatoué&quot;).

===Death===
Gabin died of leukemia at the American Hospital of Paris, in the Parisian suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine. His body was cremated, and—with full military honours—his ashes were scattered at sea from a military ship.

==Legacy==
*Gabin is considered one of the greatest stars in French cinema, and was appointed Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur.
*In 1981, French actor Louis de Funès initiated the Prix Jean Gabin, an accolade presented to upcoming actors in the French film industry. It was awarded annually from 1981 to 2006.
*The Musée Jean Gabin—in the commune of Mériel, where he grew up—narrates his story and features his film memorabilia.
*The Place Jean Gabin was inaugurated on 16 May 2008 by Daniel Vaillant, the then mayor of the 18th arrondissement of Paris, and Gabin&#x27;s children. It is on the corner of rue Custine and rue Lambert, at the foot of Montmartre.
*The Cinema Jean Gabin in Montgenèvre was named for him. Montgenèvre describes itself as France&#x27;s oldest ski resort, and was a popular holiday destination for Gabin and other French artists and intellectuals, including Jean-Paul Sartre.
*Gabin bought land in Orne, most notably Bonnefoi and Moulins-la-Marche, where a street is named in his honour and the race track he created, Hippodrome Jean Gabin still bears his name.

<text>A collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) is a type of complex debt security that repackages and directs the payments of principal and interest from a collateral pool to different types and maturities of securities, thereby meeting investor needs.

CMOs were first created in 1983 by the investment banks Salomon Brothers and First Boston for the U.S. mortgage liquidity provider Freddie Mac. The Salomon Brothers team was led by Lewis Ranieri and the First Boston team by Laurence D. Fink, although Dexter Senft also later received an industry award for his contribution).

Legally, a CMO is a debt security issued by an abstraction—a special purpose entity—and is not a debt owed by the institution creating and operating the entity. The entity is the legal owner of a set of mortgages, called a &quot;pool&quot;. Investors in a CMO buy bonds issued by the entity, and they receive payments from the income generated by the mortgages according to a defined set of rules. With regard to terminology, the mortgages themselves are termed &quot;collateral&quot;, &#x27;classes&#x27; refers to groups of mortgages issued to borrowers of roughly similar credit worthiness, &quot;tranches&quot; are specified fractions or slices, metaphorically speaking, of a pool of mortgages and the income they produce that are combined into an individual security, while the &quot;structure&quot; is the set of rules that dictates how the income received from the collateral will be distributed. The legal entity, collateral, and structure are collectively referred to as the &quot;deal&quot;. Unlike traditional mortgage pass-through securities, CMOs feature different payment streams and risks, depending on investor preferences. For tax purposes, CMOs are generally structured as Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits, which avoid the potential for &quot;double-taxation&quot;.

Investors in CMOs include banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, government agencies, and most recently central banks. This article focuses primarily on CMO bonds as traded in the United States.

The term &quot;collateralized mortgage obligation&quot; technically refers to a security issued by a specific type of legal entity dealing in residential mortgages, but investors also frequently refer to deals put together using other types of entities such as real estate mortgage investment conduits as CMOs.

==Purpose==
The most basic way a mortgage loan can be transformed into a bond suitable for purchase by an investor would simply be to &quot;split it&quot;. For example, a $300,000 30 year mortgage with an interest rate of 6.5% could be split into 300 1000-dollar bonds. These bonds would have a 30-year amortization, and an interest rate of 6.00% for example (with the remaining 0.50% going to the servicing company to send out the monthly bills and perform servicing work). However, this format of bond has various problems for various investors

*Even though the mortgage is 30 years, the borrower could theoretically pay off the loan earlier than 30 years, and will usually do so when rates have gone down, forcing the investor to have to reinvest his money at lower interest rates, something he may have not planned for. This is known as &quot;prepayment risk&quot;.
*A 30-year time frame is a long time for an investor&#x27;s money to be locked away. Only a small percentage of investors would be interested in locking away their money for this long. Even if the average home owner refinanced their loan every 10 years, meaning that the average bond would only last 10 years, there is a risk that the borrowers would not refinance, such as during an extending high interest rate period, this is known as &quot;extension risk&quot;. In addition, the longer time frame of a bond, the more the price moves up and down with the changes of interest rates, causing a greater potential penalty or bonus for an investor selling his bonds early. This is known as &quot;interest rate risk&quot;.
*Most normal bonds can be thought of as &quot;interest only loans&quot;, where the borrower borrows a fixed amount and then pays interest only before returning the principal at the end of a period. On a normal mortgage, interest and principal are paid each month, causing the amount of interest earned to decrease. This is undesirable to many investors because they are forced to reinvest the principal. This is known as reinvestment risk.
*On loans not guaranteed by the quasi-governmental agencies Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, certain investors may not agree with the risk reward tradeoff of the interest rate earned versus the potential loss of principal due to the borrower not paying. The latter event is known as default risk.

Salomon Brothers and First Boston created the CMO concept to address these issues. A CMO is essentially a way to create many different kinds of bonds from the same mortgage loan so as to please many different kinds of investors. For example:

*A group of mortgages could create four different classes of bonds. The first group would receive any prepayments before the second group would, and so on. Thus the first group of bonds would be expected to pay off sooner, but would also have a lower interest rate. Thus a 30-year mortgage is transformed into bonds of various lengths suitable for various investors with various goals.
*A group of mortgages could create four different classes of bonds. Any losses would go against the first group, before going against the second group, etc. The first group would have the highest interest rate, while the second would have slightly less, etc. Thus an investor could choose the bond that is right for the risk they want to take (i.e. a conservative bond for an insurance company, a speculative bond for a hedge fund).
*A group of mortgages could be split into principal-only and interest-only bonds. The &quot;principal-only&quot; bonds would sell at a discount, and would thus be zero coupon bonds (e.g., bonds that you buy for $800 each and which mature at $1,000, without paying any cash interest). These bonds would satisfy investors who are worried that mortgage prepayments would force them to re-invest their money at the exact moment interest rates are lower; countering this, principal only investors in such a scenario would also be getting their money earlier rather than later, which equates to a higher return on their zero-coupon investment. The &quot;interest-only&quot; bonds would include only the interest payments of the underlying pool of loans. These kinds of bonds would dramatically change in value based on interest rate movements, e.g., prepayments mean less interest payments, but higher interest rates and lower prepayments means these bonds pay more, and for a longer time. These characteristics allow investors to choose between interest-only (IO) or principal-only (PO) bonds to better manage their sensitivity to interest rates, and can be used to manage and offset the interest rate-related price changes in other investments.

Whenever a group of mortgages is split into different classes of bonds, the risk does not disappear. Rather, it is reallocated among the different classes. Some classes receive less risk of a particular type; other classes more risk of that type. How much the risk is reduced or increased for each class depends on how the classes are structured.

==Credit protection==
CMOs are most often backed by mortgage loans, which are originated by thrifts (savings and loans), mortgage companies, and the consumer lending units of large commercial banks. Loans meeting certain size and credit criteria can be insured against losses resulting from borrower delinquencies and defaults by any of the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) (Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, or Ginnie Mae). GSE guaranteed loans can serve as collateral for &quot;Agency CMOs&quot;, which are subject to interest rate risk but not credit risk. Loans not meeting these criteria are referred to as &quot;Non-Conforming&quot;, and can serve as collateral for &quot;private label mortgage bonds&quot;, which are also called &quot;whole loan CMOs&quot;. Whole loan CMOs are subject to both credit risk and interest rate risk. Issuers of whole loan CMOs generally structure their deals to reduce the credit risk of all certain classes of bonds (&quot;Senior Bonds&quot;) by utilizing various forms of credit protection in the structure of the deal.

===Credit tranching===
The most common form of credit protection is called credit tranching. In the simplest case, credit tranching means that any credit losses will be absorbed by the most junior class of bondholders until the principal value of their investment reaches zero. If this occurs, the next class of bonds (more senior) absorb credit losses, and so forth, until finally the senior bonds begin to experience losses. More frequently, a deal is embedded with certain &quot;triggers&quot; related to quantities of delinquencies or defaults in the loans backing the mortgage pool. If a balance of delinquent loans reaches a certain threshold, interest and principal that would be used to pay junior bondholders is instead directed to pay off the principal balance of senior bondholders, shortening the life of the senior bonds.

===Overcollateralization===
In CMOs backed by loans of lower credit quality, such as subprime mortgage loans, the issuer will sell a quantity of bonds whose principal value is less than the value of the underlying pool of mortgages. Because of the excess collateral, investors in the CMO will not experience losses until defaults on the underlying loans reach a certain level.

If the &quot;overcollateralization&quot; turns into &quot;undercollateralization&quot; (the assumptions of the default rate were inadequate), then the CMO defaults. CMOs have contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis.

===Excess spread===
Another way to enhance credit protection is to issue bonds that pay a lower interest rate than the underlying mortgages. For example, if the weighted average interest rate of the mortgage pool is 7%, the CMO issuer could choose to issue bonds that pay a 5% coupon. The additional interest, referred to as &quot;excess spread&quot;, is placed into a &quot;spread account&quot; until some or all of the bonds in the deal mature. If some of the mortgage loans go delinquent or default, funds from the excess spread account can be used to pay the bondholders. Excess spread is a very effective mechanism for protecting bondholders from defaults that occur late in the life of the deal because by that time the funds in the excess spread account will be sufficient to cover almost any losses.

==Prepayment tranching==
The principal (and associated coupon) stream for CMO collateral can be structured to allocate prepayment risk. Investors in CMOs wish to be protected from prepayment risk as well as credit risk. Prepayment risk is the risk that the term of the security will vary according to differing rates of repayment of principal by borrowers (repayments from refinancings, sales, curtailments, or foreclosures). If principal is prepaid faster than expected (for example, if mortgage rates fall and borrowers refinance), then the overall term of the mortgage collateral will shorten, and the principal returned at par will cause a loss for premium priced collateral. This prepayment risk cannot be removed, but can be reallocated between CMO tranches so that some tranches have some protection against this risk, whereas other tranches will absorb more of this risk. To facilitate this allocation of prepayment risk, CMOs are structured such that prepayments are allocated between bonds using a fixed set of rules. The most common schemes for prepayment tranching are described below.

===Sequential tranching (or &quot;by time&quot;)===
All of the available principal payments go to the first sequential tranche, until its balance is decremented to zero, then to the second, and so on. There are several reasons that this type of tranching would be done:
*The tranches could be expected to mature at very different times and therefore would have different yields that correspond to different points on the yield curve.
*The underlying mortgages could have a great deal of uncertainty as to when the principal will actually be received since home owners have the option to make their scheduled payments or to pay their loan off early at any time. The sequential tranches each have much less uncertainty.

===Parallel tranching===
This simply means tranches that pay down &quot;&quot;. The coupons on the tranches would be set so that in aggregate the tranches pay the same amount of interest as the underlying mortgages. The tranches could be either fixed rate or floating rate. If they have floating coupons, they would have a formula that make their total interest equal to the collateral interest. For example, with collateral that pays a coupon of 8%, you could have two tranches that each have half of the principal, one being a floater that pays LIBOR with a cap of 16%, the other being an inverse floater that pays a coupon of 16% minus LIBOR.
*A special case of parallel tranching is known as the IO/PO split. IO and PO refer to Interest Only and Principal Only. In this case, one tranche would have a coupon of zero (meaning that it would get no interest at all) and the other would get all of the interest. These bonds could be used to speculate on prepayments. A principal only bond would be sold at a deep discount (a much lower price than the underlying mortgage) and would rise in price rapidly if many of the underlying mortgages were prepaid. The interest only bond would be very profitable if few of the mortgages prepaid, but could get very little money if many mortgages prepaid. Unlike sequential tranche securitization, an IO/PO split is a parallel tranche securitization in that each simply represents a separate claims on a different portion of the cash flows from the collateral pool (e.g. mortgages bonds). Unlike sequential tranche securitization, the payments to each tranche of a parallel securitization are not predicated on the prior payment to a more senior tranche of the pool. Absent any subordination of one tranche to the other, neither tranche of an IO/PO split (parallel securitization) would be deemed to be leveraged.

===Z bonds===
This type of tranche supports other tranches by not receiving an interest payment. The interest payment that would have accrued to the Z tranche is used to pay off the principal of other bonds, and the principal of the Z tranche increases. The Z tranche starts receiving interest and principal payments only after the other tranches in the CMO have been fully paid. This type of tranche is often used to customize sequential tranches, or VADM tranches.

===Schedule bonds (also called PAC or TAC bonds)===
This type of tranching has a bond (often called a PAC or TAC bond) which has even less uncertainty than a sequential bond by receiving prepayments according to a defined schedule. The schedule is maintained by using support bonds (also called companion bonds) that absorb the excess prepayments.
*Planned Amortization Class (PAC) bonds have a principal payment rate determined by two different prepayment rates, which together form a band (also called a collar). Early in the life of the CMO, the prepayment at the lower PSA will yield a lower prepayment. Later in the life, the principal in the higher PSA will have declined enough that it will yield a lower prepayment. The PAC tranche will receive whichever rate is lower, so it will change prepayment at one PSA for the first part of its life, then switch to the other rate. The ability to stay on this schedule is maintained by a support bond, which absorbs excess prepayments, and will receive less prepayments to prevent extension of average life. However, the PAC is only protected from extension to the amount that prepayments are made on the underlying MBSs. When the principal of that bond is exhausted, the CMO is referred to as a &quot;busted PAC&quot;, or &quot;busted collar&quot;.
*Target Amortization Class (TAC) bonds are similar to PAC bonds, but they do not provide protection against extension of average life. The schedule of principal payments is created by using just a single PSA.

===Very accurately defined maturity (VADM) bonds===
Very accurately defined maturity (VADM) bonds are similar to PAC bonds in that they protect against both extension and contraction risk, but their payments are supported in a different way. Instead of a support bond, they are supported by the accretion of a Z bond. This means a VADM tranche will receive the scheduled prepayments even if no prepayments are made on the underlying. The VADM bond concept was named after its inventor, Vadim Khazatsky, a trader at Solomon Brothers, highlighting its innovative approach to managing prepayment risks associated with mortgage-backed securities.

===Non-accelerating senior (NAS)===
NAS bonds are designed to protect investors from volatility and negative convexity resulting from prepayments. NAS tranches of bonds are fully protected from prepayments for a specified period, after which time prepayments are allocated to the tranche using a specified step down formula. For example, an NAS bond might be protected from prepayments for five years, and then would receive 10% of the prepayments for the first month, then 20%, and so on. Recently, issuers have added features to accelerate the proportion of prepayments flowing to the NAS class of bond in order to create shorter bonds and reduce extension risk. NAS tranches are usually found in deals that also contain short sequentials, Z-bonds, and credit subordination.
A NAS tranche receives principal payments according to a schedule which shows for a given month the share of pro rata principal that must be distributed to the NAS tranche.

===NASquential===
NASquentials were introduced in mid-2005 and represented an innovative structural twist, combining the standard NAS (Non-Accelerated Senior) and Sequential structures. Similar to a sequential structure, the NASquentials are tranched sequentially, however, each tranche has a NAS-like hard lockout date associated with it. Unlike with a NAS, no shifting interest mechanism is employed after the initial lockout date. The resulting bonds offer superior stability versus regular sequentials, and yield pickup versus PACs. The support-like cashflows falling out on the other side of NASquentials are sometimes referred to as RUSquentials (Relatively Unstable Sequentials).

==Coupon tranching==
The coupon stream from the mortgage collateral can also be restructured (analogous to the way the principal stream is structured). This coupon stream allocation is performed after prepayment tranching is complete. If the coupon tranching is done on the collateral without any prepayment tranching, then the resulting tranches are called &#x27;strips&#x27;. The benefit is that the resulting CMO tranches can be targeted to very different sets of investors. In general, coupon tranching will produce a pair (or set) of complementary CMO tranches.

===IO/discount fixed rate pair===
A fixed rate CMO tranche can be further restructured into an Interest Only (IO) tranche and a discount coupon fixed rate tranche. An IO pays a coupon only based on a notional principal, it receives no principal payments from amortization or prepayments. Notional principal does not have any cash flows but shadows the principal changes of the original tranche, and it is this principal off which the coupon is calculated. For example, a $100mm PAC tranche off 6% collateral with a 6% coupon (&#x27;6 off 6&#x27; or &#x27;6-squared&#x27;) can be cut into a $100mm PAC tranche with a 5% coupon (and hence a lower dollar price) called a &#x27;5 off 6&#x27;, and a PAC IO tranche with a notional principal of $16.666667mm and paying a 6% coupon. Note the resulting notional principle of the IO is less than the original principal. Using the example, the IO is created by taking 1% of coupon off the 6% original coupon gives an IO of 1% coupon off $100mm notional principal, but this is by convention &#x27;normalized&#x27; to a 6% coupon (as the collateral was originally 6% coupon) by reducing the notional principal to $16.666667mm ($100mm / 6).

===PO/premium fixed rate pair===
Similarly if a fixed rate CMO tranche coupon is desired to be increased, then principal can be removed to form a Principal Only (PO) class and a premium fixed rate tranche. A PO pays no coupon, but receives principal payments from amortization and prepayments. For example, a $100mm sequential (SEQ) tranche off 6% collateral with a 6% coupon (&#x27;6 off 6&#x27;) can be cut into a $92.307692mm SEQ tranche with a 6.5% coupon (and hence a higher dollar price) called a &#x27;6.5 off 6&#x27;, and a SEQ PO tranche with a principal of $7.692308mm and paying a no coupon. The principal of the premium SEQ is calculated as (6 / 6.5) * $100mm, the principal of the PO is calculated as balance from $100mm.

===IO/PO pair===
The simplest coupon tranching is to allocate the coupon stream to an IO, and the principal stream to a PO. This is generally only done on the whole collateral without any prepayment tranching, and generates strip IOs and strip POs. In particular FNMA and FHLMC both have extensive strip IO/PO programs (aka Trusts IO/PO or SMBS) which generate very large, liquid strip IO/PO deals at regular intervals.

===Floater/inverse pair===
The construction of CMO Floaters is the most effective means of getting additional market liquidity for CMOs. CMO floaters have a coupon that moves in line with a given index (usually 1 month LIBOR) plus a spread, and is thus seen as a relatively safe investment even though the term of the security may change. One feature of CMO floaters that is somewhat unusual is that they have a coupon cap, usually set well out of the money (e.g. 8% when LIBOR is 5%) In creating a CMO floater, a CMO Inverse is generated. The CMO inverse is a more complicated instrument to hedge and analyse, and is usually sold to sophisticated investors.

The construction of a floater/inverse can be seen in two stages. The first stage is to synthetically raise the effective coupon to the target floater cap, in the same way as done for the PO/Premium fixed rate pair. As an example using $100mm 6% collateral, targeting an 8% cap, we generate $25mm of PO and $75mm of &#x27;8 off 6&#x27;. The next stage is to cut up the premium coupon into a floater and inverse coupon, where the floater is a linear function of the index, with unit slope and a given offset or spread. In the example, the 8% coupon of the &#x27;8 off 6&#x27; is cut into a floater coupon of:

:formula_1

(indicating a 0.40%, or 40, spread in this example)

The inverse formula is simply the difference of the original premium fixed rate coupon less the floater formula. In the example:

:formula_2

The floater coupon is allocated to the premium fixed rate tranche principal, in the example the $75mm &#x27;8 off 6&#x27;, giving the floater tranche of &#x27;$75mm 8% cap + 40 LIBOR SEQ floater&#x27;. The floater will pay LIBOR + 0.40% each month on an original balance of $75mm, subject to a coupon cap of 8%.

The inverse coupon is to be allocated to the PO principal, but has been generated of the notional principal of the premium fixed rate tranche (in the example the PO principal is $25mm but the inverse coupon is notionalized off $75mm). Therefore, the inverse coupon is &#x27;re-notionalized&#x27; to the smaller principal amount, in the example this is done by multiplying the coupon by ($75mm /$25mm) = 3. Therefore, the resulting coupon is:

:formula_3

In the example the inverse generated is a &#x27;$25mm 3 times levered 7.6 strike LIBOR SEQ inverse&#x27;.

===Other structures===
Other structures include Inverse IOs, TTIBs, Digital TTIBs/Superfloaters, and &#x27;mountain&#x27; bonds. A special class of IO/POs generated in non-agency deals are WAC IOs and WAC POs, which are used to build a fixed pass through rate on a deal.

==Attributes of IOs and POs==
===Interest only (IO)===
An interest only (IO) tranche may be carved from collateral securities to receive just the interest payments from a pool of mortgages. IO holders are only entitled to the actual amount of interest paid, as it is paid, on a pool of mortgage collateral. Since mortgages allow for prepayment, there is no assurance how much interest will actually be paid. Once all an underlying debt is paid off, that debt&#x27;s future stream of interest is terminated and the IO expires with no terminal value. Therefore, IO securities are annuity-like securities but the amount and timing of payments is uncertain as payments are based on the total interest payments paid on all the underlying mortgages in the collateral pool. 

Generally speaking, mortgage prepayments tend to slow down as general interest rates increase. Therefore, IOs prices generally increase as interest rates increase and decrease as interest rates decrease (i.e. negative duration). If mortgage prepayments increase, or the market&#x27;s expectations of future prepayments increases (i.e. higher expected PSA speed), the expected aggregate dollar amount of interest payments [and therefore the market price of the IO tranche] would generally be expected to decrease. By contrast, if mortgage prepayments decrease, or the market&#x27;s expectations of future prepayments decreases (i.e. lower expected PSA speed), the expected dollar amount of interest payments [and therefore the market price of the IO tranche] would generally be expected to increase. 

Therefore, IOs have investor demand due to their expected negative effective duration as they can be used as a hedge against conventional fixed-income securities in a portfolio. Additionally, since investors are only buying a portion of the overall cash flows and are not entitled to any payments of principal (the PO tranche), the cost of the IO trance may be significantly lower than that of the PO tranche. While IO and PO tranches have different risk characteristics, neither the IO nor the PO represents a leveraged position in the underlying collateral pool.ФПЖб

===Principal only (PO)===
A principal only (PO) strip may be carved from collateral securities to receive just the principal portion of a payment. Since the IO tranche has negative duration, a PO typically has more effective duration than its collateral. One may think of this in two ways: 1. The increased effective duration must balance the matching IO&#x27;s negative effective duration to equal the collateral&#x27;s effective duration, or 2. Bonds with lower coupons usually have higher effective durations, and a PO has no [zero] coupon. POs have investor demand as hedges against IO-type streams (e.g. mortgage servicing rights).

<text>The Advertising Council, commonly known as Ad Council, is an American nonprofit organization that produces, distributes, and promotes public service announcements or PSAs on behalf of various sponsors, including nonprofit organizations, non-governmental organizations and agencies of the United States government.

The Ad Council partners with advertising agencies that work pro bono to create the public service advertisements on behalf of their campaigns. The organization accepts requests from sponsor institutions for advertising campaigns that focus on particular social issues. To qualify, an issue must be non-denominational, non-partisan (though not necessarily unbiased), have national relevance and be an issue for which communications can make a measurable difference.

The Ad Council distributes the advertisements to a network of 33,000 media outlets—including broadcast, print, outdoor (e.g., billboards, bus stops), and Internet—which run the ads in donated time and space. Media outlets donate approximately $1.8 billion to Ad Council campaigns annually. If paid for, this amount would make the Ad Council one of the largest advertisers in the country.

Beyond advertisements across broadcast, print, and digital, campaign efforts often include virtual panels, coalition building, and information sharing.

In 2020, the Ad Council coordinated with partners across government, media, tech, and health to disseminate messaging about social distancing, wearing masks, and staying home when possible to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2021, the Ad Council announced the COVID-19 Vaccine Education initiative in partnership with COVID Collaborative and more than 300 partners.

==History==
The organization was conceived in 1941, and it was incorporated as The Advertising Council, Inc., on February 26, 1942. On June 25, 1943, it was renamed The War Advertising Council, Inc. for the purpose of mobilizing the advertising industry in support of the war effort for the ongoing Second World War. Early campaigns encouraged enlistment to the military, the purchase of war bonds, and conservation of war materials.

Before the conclusion of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested that the Ad Council continue its work during peacetime. On February 5, 1946, The War Advertising Council officially changed its name back to The Advertising Council, Inc., and shifted its focus to issues such as atomic weapons, world trade and religious tolerance. In 1945, the Ad Council began working with the National Safety Council.

U.S. presidents subsequent to Roosevelt have also supported the Ad Council&#x27;s work. In the 1950s, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and General Dwight D. Eisenhower appeared in the Ad Council&#x27;s anti-communism ads. In the 1980s First Lady Nancy Reagan collaborated with the Ad Council on the “Just Say No” anti-drug campaign.

On March 11, 2021, as part of its COVID-19 Vaccine Education Initiative, the Ad Council released a PSA featuring former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter along with former First Ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton, and Rosalynn Carter. On March 15, the White House&#x27;s official Twitter account shared the PSA with the message “Four presidents. Two political parties. One clear message: Get vaccinated when it’s available to you.”

Their partners on the initiative, COVID Collaborative, is a national assembly chaired by former Governor and U.S. Senator Dirk Kempthorne (R-ID) and former Governor Deval Patrick (D-MA). The Ad Council&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccine promotion efforts were further supported by a $500,000 grant in the first quarter of 2021 from Pfizer for a &quot;COVID-19 Crisis Response &amp; Recovery Effort.&quot;
The Ad Council&#x27;s first president, Theodore Repplier, assumed leadership of the organization in 1947. Robert Keim succeeded Repplier as Ad Council president from 1966 to 1987, Ruth Wooden succeeded Keim from 1987 to 1999, and Peggy Conlon succeeded Wooden from 1999 to 2014, when the current president, Lisa Sherman, began her tenure.

Since 1986, the Ad Council&#x27;s archive has been housed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

==Famous campaigns==

It was 1947 when the iconic Smokey Bear phrase was finally coined: &quot;Remember...only YOU can prevent forest/wild fires!&quot; The Forest Fire Prevention campaign has helped reduce the number of acres lost annually to wildfire from 22 million to 8.4 million (in 2000).

* FWD campaign with USAID (2011–present) In September 2011, Ad Council and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the FWD campaign to spread awareness about famine, war and drought in the Horn of Africa.

In June 2020, the campaign released “Fight for Freedom” to support the ongoing fight for racial justice for the Black community. The next month, it released “Fight the Virus. Fight the Bias” in response to the rise of anti-Asian racism during COVID-19.
* Seize the Awkward (2018–present). Launched in partnership with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the JED Foundation, this campaign empowers young adults to talk to each other about mental health. In 2020, the campaign received the Shorty Award for Best Use of a Spokesperson for its partnership with Billie Eilish. The same year, the campaign expanded to address mental health issues exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
* COVID-19 Response (2020–present). Less than a week after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, the Ad Council announced a collaboration with the White House, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and major media networks to launch a series of national public service ads and multi-channel content to provide critical and urgent messages to the American public. As the pandemic unfolded, the campaign continued to create work encouraging Americans to socially distance, wear masks and stay home when possible to slow the spread of the pandemic. As part of the campaign&#x27;s response to the pandemic&#x27;s disproportionate impact on the Black community, “You Will See Me” ads featured Viola Davis, Simone Biles, and Questlove. Ad Age noted the ads “[encourage] people to stay safe while also elevating the voices of the individuals behind the masks.” 
* COVID-19 Vaccine Education Initiative (2021–present). On February 25, 2021, the Ad Council and COVID Collaborative launched the COVID-19 Vaccine Education Initiative with more than 300 founding partners. The initiative involved multiple campaigns designed to reach multiple communities with the facts about the vaccines. In April, a cover story on the initiative in Washington Post Magazine explored the strategy behind “one of the biggest, most difficult public service campaigns in U.S. history.” Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter appeared in a PSA for the initiative along with former First Ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton and Rosalynn Carter. Pope Francis also appeared in a PSA along with six cardinals and archbishops from North, Central and South America, saying that getting vaccinated against COVID-19 was “an act of love.”

==Organizations with campaigns done by the Ad Council==
==Partnerships with film production companies==
Several recent Ad Council PSA campaigns have involved partnerships with film production companies, including Warner Bros., Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Disney. Examples include a partnership with Warner Bros. featuring characters from &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; in PSAs to counteract childhood obesity, PSAs for child passenger safety featuring clips from Warner Bros. &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, a partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;The Smurfs 2&quot; to encourage children to explore nature.

==Criticism==
Due to the Ad Council&#x27;s historically close collaboration with the President of the United States and the federal government, it has been labeled by historian Robert Griffith as &quot;little more than a domestic propaganda arm of the federal government.&quot;

Environmental activist Mike Ewall has criticized the Ad Council for what he believes is distracting the public by focusing on individual lifestyle changes, rather than on the perceived need to fix social problems by changing institutions, such as the Ad Council&#x27;s many corporate sponsors, or the government and military, whose campaigns the Ad Council has also promoted.

<text>The Florida Times-Union is a daily newspaper in Jacksonville, Florida, United States. Widely known as the oldest newspaper in the state, it began publication as the Florida Union in 1864. Its current incarnation started in 1883, when the &quot;Florida Union&quot; merged with another Jacksonville paper, the &quot;Florida Daily Times&quot;.

In 1983, Morris Communications of Augusta, Georgia, purchased Florida Publishing Company. &quot;The Times-Union&quot; became the largest newspaper of this chain, which owns a number of newspapers around the country. The paper is now owned by Gannett. Its editor is Paul Runnestrand.

==History==
In 1864, during the American Civil War, J. K. Stickney and W. C. Morrill published the first edition of the &quot;Florida Union&quot;. It was a Northern and Republican paper, at the time when Jacksonville was occupied by the Union Army. By 1867, Stickney sold the &quot;Florida Union&quot; to Edward M. Cheney, of Boston. Cheney tried to make the paper into a daily publication but lacked the needed money. The &quot;Union&quot; was sold to Walton, Fowle &amp; Co. in 1873. Stockholder C. F. Mawbey assumed control and turned the &quot;Union&quot; into a daily publication. Cheney returned to the &quot;Union&quot; as an editor. 

In 1876, the &quot;Union&quot; was in decline and abandoned daily publication. Financially doomed, it was sold to H. B. McCallum, who then returned it to daily publication and converted it from an afternoon to a morning paper. Charles H. Jones wanted to buy the &quot;Union&quot; but was refused by McCallum. Annoyed, Jones started a rival paper, the &quot;Florida Daily Times&quot;, in November 1881. By 1883, the &quot;Daily Times&quot; was dominating the &quot;Union&quot;. McCallum became ill and finally decided to sell the paper to the &quot;Daily Times&quot;. The &quot;Union&quot; then combined with the &quot;Daily Times&quot; to form &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot;, whose first edition was published on February 4, 1883. 

The paper was partisan and worked to promote railroad interests. The &quot;Daily Times&quot; was reporting on election related violence in 1882.

On February 11, 2018, &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; printed its last papers in Jacksonville after 154 years. &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; newspapers are now printed at &quot;The Gainesville Sun&quot; and &quot;The Daytona Beach News-Journal&quot;, which are both owned by Gatehouse Media. On April 1, 2019, &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; moved to the Wells Fargo building at 1 Independent Drive, Suite 200 in downtown Jacksonville.

==Ownership==
For most of the 20th century, &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; was owned by the Florida Publishing Company, which was in turn jointly owned by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, the Florida East Coast Railway, and the Seaboard Air Line Railway, the three main railroads serving Jacksonville, having been acquired in equal shares by them or their corporate predecessors about 1896. The Coast Line and the Seaboard merged in 1967 as the Seaboard Coast Line, which evolved into CSX Transportation; the Florida East Coast has maintained its corporate identity into the 21st century. Both railroads have their headquarters in Jacksonville, the railroad hub of the state.

In 1983 Morris Communications of Augusta, Georgia, acquired the Florida Publishing Company for $200 million. In October 2017 Gatehouse Media acquired the &quot;Times-Union&quot; from Morris Communications, in conjunction with numerous other papers across the country, for $120 million. GateHouse merged with Gannett in 2019; while GateHouse was the nominal survivor, the merged company took the better-known Gannett name.

<text>The Peddie School is a college preparatory school in Hightstown, in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a non-denominational, coeducational boarding school located on a campus, and serves students in the ninth through twelfth grades, plus a small post-graduate class. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1928.

For the 2023–24 school year, the school had an acceptance rate of 22%.

As of the 2021–22 school year, the school had an enrollment of 532 students and 83 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 6.4:1. The school&#x27;s student body was 41.0% (218) White, 35.0% (186) Asian, 11.3% (60) Black, 7.3% (39) two or more races and 5.5% (29) Hispanic. Peddie had 62% of students in residence. The student body represented 26 states as well as 29 foreign countries. Peddie had an average class size of 12.

Peter Quinn succeeded John Green as head of school in 2013.

==History==
What is now The Peddie School was founded in 1864 as the Hightstown Female Seminary, an American Baptist school. Later that year, boys were admitted and it changed its name for the first time, to New Jersey Classical and Scientific Institute. In 1872, it became the Peddie Institute in honor of philanthropist and politician Thomas B. Peddie, who gave the school $25,000 (equivalent to $ in ). In 1923, the school was formally renamed The Peddie School.

Peddie remained coeducational until 1908, when, for social and economic reasons, it decided to begin admitting only boys. This decision was reversed in 1970 when girls began to be admitted again. The following year, Peddie&#x27;s first female African-American student enrolled in the fall term.

Beginning in the 1930s, Peddie began to attract students from other countries including China and Central America. As of 2022, 21% of Peddie&#x27;s students identified as international, with top countries including China, South Korea, and Canada.

In 1983, Walter Annenberg, class of 1927, made a gift of $12 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to Peddie, the largest donation to a secondary school at the time. Ten years later in 1993, Ambassador Annenberg topped his gift when he made the groundbreaking donation of $100 million (equivalent to $ million in ), allowing it to expand its facilities, financial aid, and teachers&#x27; compensation and housing; prior to the Annenberg donation, the school&#x27;s endowment totaled $17 million.

As of 2022, Peddie&#x27;s endowment remains at over $450 million.

Students begin to design their program during their sophomore year, with them conducting research and traveling during the summer between their junior and senior years. The program allows students to conduct research in any subject they are interested in, including STEM, English, Language, history, writing, and the arts. Many students focused on STEM conduct research in large, university labs, including University of California, Berkeley and Princeton University. Each year, students who participate in STEM-EXP present their research to students in a research fair during their senior year.

==Athletics==
All students must participate in theater, be on an interscholastic team, or be in one of the elective physical-education classes after school.

Peddie has its own 18-hole golf course, where the boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; golf teams compete. The course is a private facility of the Peddie Golf Club, but students and faculty have free access to the greens.

The school competes in the Mid-Atlantic Prep League, a sports league with participating institutions from preparatory schools in the New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania area.

===Football rivalry===
Peddie&#x27;s arch-rival is Blair Academy, and the two schools compete every year during the second week of November for the Potter-Kelley Cup. The day of the football competition, which alternates yearly between campuses, is known as &quot;Blair Day&quot; at Peddie (and &quot;Peddie Day&quot; at Blair). The game between the two schools is the oldest football rivalry in New Jersey and ranks among the oldest in the country.

===Crew===
Peddie&#x27;s crew team was first recognized on the national stage in 1993, when the men&#x27;s midweight 4+ won a Youth National Championship title in Occaquan, VA. This feat was nearly repeated three years later, with Peddie coming in second in the same event by less than half a second. In 2006, the Peddie Girls&#x27; Varsity Four won the United States Youth National Championship, a regatta hosting the strongest club and scholastic teams in the nation. They won again in 2007, defending their U.S. Youth National Regatta title. In 2008, Peddie&#x27;s Girls&#x27; Varsity Four placed third in their division at the Head of the Charles Regatta and returned to the Youth National in Ohio, placing second. The men&#x27;s varsity four also traveled to Ohio, placing twelve in the Varsity Lightweight Four event. In 2009 the girls and boys returned to the National Championships. The girls regained their first place position, and the men placed sixth in the Petite Final of the Heavyweight Varsity Four. The women then continued on to the Henley Women&#x27;s Regatta in England, setting a course record on their way to the final and eventually placing second.

===Swimming===
Peddie also boasts a nationally-acclaimed swimming program. Peddie School swimmers (students or alumni) have represented their nations in every Olympics since 1992. The team has won the Swimming World Mythical National Championships eight times, including the inaugural boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; independent-school titles in 1977 and 1982. The teams in the early 1990s were among the most-dominant high-school swimming programs in history, winning back-to-back boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; Mythical titles in 1990 and 1991. The 1994-95 team was the only team ever to lead the nation in all six relays. In 2007 both the girls&#x27; and boys&#x27; teams claimed first place at the Eastern Interscholastic Swimming and Diving Championships held at La Salle University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the 2007 championships, Peddie broke three national independent-school records in the girls&#x27; relay events. In 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017 the Peddie&#x27;s boys swim team won the Eastern Interscholastic Swimming and Diving Championships, continuing their success.

The boys swimming team won the New Jersey Non-Public state championship in 1951.

===Basketball===
In 2010, the girls&#x27; basketball team won the ESPN National High School Invitational, defeating Oak Hill Academy by a score of 60-44 in the tournament final and finishing the season with a 25-2 record. From 2000-2010 the girls&#x27; basketball program has been ranked one of the top 25 teams in the country seven times. During this same time period, three McDonald&#x27;s All-Americans played for the Falcons including: Crystal Goring &#x27;05 (Richmond), Bridgette Mitchell &#x27;06 (Duke) and Haley Peters &#x27;10 (Duke).

<text>The Kennebunk River is a river in York County, Maine in the United States. It drains a settled rural area southwest of Portland, emptying into the Atlantic Ocean.

It rises in central York County, at the junction of Carlisle Brook and Lords Brook in the town of Lyman. Lords Brook issues from Kennebunk Pond in Lyman. The Kennebunk River flows generally southeast, passing under Interstate 95 and U.S. Route 1. It flows past the town center of Kennebunkport, where it becomes navigable, and enters the Atlantic in Kennebunkport, approximately one-half mile (1 km) downstream from the town center.

<text>USS &quot;S-30&quot; (SS-135) was an &quot;S&quot;-class submarine of the United States Navy during World War II.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;S-30&quot; was laid down on 1 April 1918 by the Union Iron Works at San Francisco, California. She was launched on 21 November 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Edward S. Stalnaker, and commissioned on 29 October 1920.

==Service history==
===1920–1941===
Based at San Pedro, California, with her home yard at Mare Island, California, &quot;S-30&quot; conducted tests and exercises off the California coast until the summer of 1921. Then, on 15 August 1921, she was placed in ordinary. Returned to full commission on 14 February 1922, she was ordered to New London, Connecticut, where she was placed in ordinary again on 21 June 1922 for engine alterations by the prime contractor for her construction, the Electric Boat Company.

Trials and exercises off the southern New England coast followed her return to full commission on 21 November 1922. In January 1923, she moved south to the Caribbean Sea to participate in winter maneuvers and Fleet Problem I, conducted to test the defenses of the Panama Canal Zone. In April 1923, she returned to California and resumed operations off the coast of California with her division, Submarine Division 16. During the winter of 1924, she again participated in fleet exercises and Fleet Problems in the Panama Canal Zone area and in the Caribbean.

During the winter of 1925, &quot;S-30&quot; prepared for transfer to the United States Asiatic Fleet. She departed Mare Island with her division in mid-April 1925. During May 1925, she conducted exercises and underwent upkeep in the Hawaiian Islands, and, on 16 June 1925 she got underway for the Philippines. On 12 July 1925, she arrived at the Submarine Base, Cavite, Luzon. In the years that followed, her division rotated between exercises and patrols in the Philippines during the winter and operations off the China coast during the summer.

In 1932, &quot;S-30&quot;′s division was ordered back to the eastern Pacific Ocean, and, on 2 May 1932, she departed Manila bound for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, which became her new home port.

Transferred back to the United States East Coast, &quot;S-30&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 19 May 1937 and arrived at New London on 8 August 1937. She then trained along the U.S. East Coast until May 1939, when she was placed in commission, in reserve. On 1 September 1940, she returned to full commission. With World War II raging in Europe and German U-boats raiding shipping in the western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean, S-boats like &quot;S-30&quot; were assigned to Submarines, Patrol Force (known as Submarines, Atlantic Fleet after February 1941) and conducted training and the development of tactical skills. From New London, she operated along the mid-Atlantic and northeastern coasts of the United States into the spring of 1941. She then served briefly in the Bermuda area before returning to New London.

In early July 1941, &quot;S-30&quot; proceeded to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for overhaul. In September 1941, she emerged from the shipyard, returned to New England, and resumed submarine and antisubmarine warfare training operations in the Long Island Sound, Narragansett Bay, Casco Bay, and Placentia Bay areas.

=== World War II ===

==== First, second, and third (defensive) war patrols ====

The United States entered World War II on 7 December 1941 with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and &quot;S-30&quot;′s division, Submarine Division 52, soon was reassigned to the Panama Canal Zone for defensive patrol duties. Departing New London on 31 January 1942, she hunted for enemy submarines along her route which took her via Bermuda and Mona Passage into the Caribbean Sea. On 16 February 1942, she arrived at Coco Solo, Panama, from which she conducted two more defensive patrols in the western approaches to the Panama Canal, from 10 to 31 March 1942 and from 14 April to 13 May 1942, before she was ordered to California to prepare for service in the Aleutian Islands. She underwent repairs at San Diego, California, then, inmid-July 1942, she started for the Territory of Alaska. While en route, engine trouble forced her into Mare Island for repairs, but on 1 August 1942 she resumed her northward voyage.

==== Fourth (first offensive) war patrol ====

On 12 August 1942, &quot;S-30&quot; departed the submarine base at Dutch Harbor on Amaknak Island off Unalaska in the Aleutians to begin her fourth — and first offensive — war patrol. Moving through fog, she arrived off Attu Island — occupied by the Japanese at the beginning of the Aleutian Islands campaign in June 1942 — in the western Aleutians on 16 August 1942, her crew sighting only the hazy outline of Cape Wrangell through the fog. She continued on to patrol across the anticipated Japanese shipping lanes between Attu and the northern Kuril Islands. On the afternoon of 7 September 1942, three Imperial Japanese Navy destroyers attacked her some north of Cape Wrangell, subjecting her to depth-charge attacks during a two-and-a-half-hour encounter. She departed her patrol area on 10 September 1942 and headed for Dutch Harbor.

==== Fifth war patrol ====

On 24 September 1942, &quot;S-30&quot; got underway for her fifth war patrol, her second in the Aleutians. A cracked cylinder in her port engine forced her back to Dutch Harbor on 27 September, but on 30 September, she again headed west. On 3 October 1942, she entered her patrol area and began hunting Japanese ships along the sea lanes west of Kiska, but by 9 October 1942 additional engineering casualties, cracks, and leaks had developed and forced her to return to Dutch Harbor.

==== October 1942–March 1943 ====
After arriving at Dutch Harbor, &quot;S-30&quot; received orders to proceed to San Diego for an overhaul. During the overhaull, she received a fathometer, a new distilling unit, and more modern radar equipment. After the completion of her overhaul, she provided training services to the West Coast Sound School from mid-February 1943 into March 1943. On 16 March 1943, she departed for Dutch Harbor, which she reached on 21 March 1943. After her arrival, an air compressor failure and malfunctioning of her fathometer delayed her departure on her next war patrol.

==== Sixth war patrol ====

With repairs complete, &quot;S-30&quot; began her sixth war patrol on 13 April 1943, departing Dutch Harbor for a patrol area off Attu. On 15 April 1943, she crossed the International Date Line and she arrived in her patrol area on 17 April 1943 Dutch Harbor time (18 April local time). For the next few days, she reconnoitered and, when possible photographed, Attu&#x27;s principal coves, bays, and harbors. On 26 April 1943, she was ordered to operate east of 176°E and south of 52°40&#x27;N, where she remained until after an Allied strike against Attu. On the afternoon of 27 April 1943, she returned the waters off Attu but was unable to determine the extent of damage the strike inflicted on Japanese forces and facilities. On 2 May 1943, she departed the Attu area and returned to Dutch Harbor for refit.

==== Seventh war patrol ====

On 24 May 1943, &quot;S-30&quot; departed Dutch Harbor to begin her seventh war patrol and headed west again, this time bound for the northern Kuril Islands. On 31 May 1943 (Dutch Harbor date; 1 June 1943 locally), she entered her assigned patrol area. On 5 June 1943, off the Kamchatka Peninsula, she attacked her first target, a large sampan. Her guns set the vessel on fire, but as it burned, a Japanese destroyer appeared on the horizon and began closing the surfaced submarine at high speed. Three minutes later, the destroyer opened fire on the diving &quot;S-30&quot;.

&quot;S-30&quot; commenced an approach on the destroyer, but just as she reached firing bearing, she lost depth control. A few seconds later, the destroyer began depth-charging her. In the next 20 minutes, the destroyer dropped 33 depth charges. Others followed sporadically over the next five hours. &quot;S-30&quot; then was able to clear the area. On 6 June 1943, &quot;S-30&quot;′s crew repaired all minor damage and began efforts to remove two torpedoes which had been crushed in the number-three and number-four torpedo tubes. The one in the number four tube was removed on 7 June 1943, but the one in the number-three tube remained until the completion of the patrol.

On 8 June, &quot;S-30&quot; headed down the coast of Paramushiro at the northern end of the Kurils. approached Onekotan, then transited Onekotan Strait and set a course for Araito. During the next two days, she sighted four targets but was able to close only the last two, merchant ships in column, contacted on 10 June (Dutch harbor date; 11 June local date). Fog closed in rapidly as she made her approach, then blanketed the area as she launched three torpedoes. Her crew heard two explosions but could see nothing. Post-war examination of Japanese records revealed that she sank the 5,131- or 5,228-gross register ton (according to different sources) cargo ship (ex-&quot;Jinbu Maru&quot;) — which was anchored in Kakumabetsu Bay on the coast of Paramushiro at the time — in the attack. During the ensuing depth charging by Japanese warships, &quot;S-30&quot; began to move out of the area. Within two and one-half hours, she had left the pinging of the searching Japanese sonars behind.

&quot;S-30&quot; resumed her hunt for Japanese ships. On 12 June 1943, she again transited Onekotan Strait. On 13 June, she fired on a convoy, but missed. On 14 June, she departed the area, and on 22 June 1943 she returned to Dutch Harbor to begin extracting the damaged torpedo in her number three tube and commence refitting.

==== Eighth war patrol ====

On 5 July 1943, &quot;S-30&quot; got underway on her eighth war patrol, which took her back to the Kurils and into the Sea of Okhotsk. She patrolled on both sides of the Kuril Island chain and across the shippung lanes leading to Soya Strait and to Yokosuka, Japan. She took periscope photographs of Japanese facilities on various islands and sighted several targets, but was unable to close on most of them and was unsuccessful against those she attacked. On 20 July 1943, she attacked what appeared to be an inter-island steamer but which turned out to be a Japanese warship that steamed straight down the torpedo track and dropped six depth charges in quick succession. &quot;S-30&quot; went deep, reloaded, and prepared to reattack. The target, however, was lost in the fog.

&quot;S-30&quot; continued her patrol. On 27 July 1943, she fired three torpedoes at a Japanese merchant ship estimated at 7000 gross register tons. Her sound operator reported two hits, breaking-up noises, and distant depth charging, but the damage went unverified by postwar examination of Japanese records. On 31 July 1943, she attacked another cargo ship under similar circumstances and reported scoring one torpedo hit. Her sound operator reported that screw noises from the target stopped and that he heard breaking-up noises, and periscope observation showed no ship still afloat at the site of the attack. However, any damage which &quot;S-30&quot; might have inflicted was never verified.

&quot;S-30&quot; departed the Kurils on 7 August 1943 and headed east. O 9 August 1943, she arrived in Massacre Bay on Attu, which U.S. forces had retaken from the Japanese in May 1943 during the Battle of Attu.

==== Ninth war patrol ====
&quot;S-30&quot; departed Massacre Bay on 26 August 1943 to begin her ninth and final war patrol. During the patrol, she operated along the eastern and western sides of the Kuril Islands. Again, she lost several targets in fog, nut nevertheless took photographs of the islands. In mid-September 1943, she added a new dimension to her activities when attempted to bombard the Japanese garrison on Matsuwa. Fog interfered with her first attempt to shell Matsuwa, but it cleared off early on the morning of 15 September 1943 (local date) as she neared the firing point with her crew at battle stations. When the order to fire was given, however, the gun failed to respond. Her crew attempted to install a new firing pin, but it was a fraction of an inch too short, and she had to abandon her bombardment effort.

On 16 September 1943, &quot;S-30&quot; received orders to head for Dutch Harbor.. En route, a Japanese patrol plane sighted and bombed her on 17 September 1943. Her port engine failed during the attack, but she escaped serious damage. On 23 September 1943, she arrived at Dutch Harbor.

==== September 1943–October 1945 ====

Within a week of arriving at Dutch Harbor, &quot;S-30&quot; headed south to San Diego, where, with others of her class, she provided training services for the West Coast Sound School for the remainder of World War II. Hostilities ended in mid-August 1945. In mid-September 1945, she proceeded to Mare Island, where she was decommissioned on 9 October 1945.

==Disposal==
On 24 October 1945, &quot;S-30&quot;′s name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. In December 1946, she was sold and delivered to the Salco Iron and Metal Company, San Francisco, for scrapping.

<text>Beat Girl is a 1960 British teen exploitation drama film directed by Edmond T. Gréville. The film was released in the United States under the title Wild for Kicks.

The title character of &quot;Beat Girl&quot; was played by starlet Gillian Hills, who later went on to have numerous small roles in 1960s and 1970s films, such as &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966) and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971), and became a successful &quot;ye-ye&quot; singer in France. &quot;Beat Girl&quot; marked the first film roles of British pop idol Adam Faith and actor Peter McEnery, although it was not released until after other films featuring Faith (&quot;Never Let Go&quot; (1960)) and McEnery (&quot;Tunes of Glory&quot; (1960)) had already come out. The film also features Christopher Lee and Nigel Green as strip joint operators, and Oliver Reed in a small role as one of the &quot;beat&quot; youth.
The original music was composer John Barry&#x27;s first film commission, and was performed by the John Barry Seven and Orchestra, Adam Faith, and Shirley Anne Field. The &quot;Beat Girl&quot; soundtrack was the first British soundtrack to be released on a vinyl LP. It reached number 11 on the UK Albums Chart, paving the way for the release of other film soundtrack albums.

==Plot==
Paul Linden, a wealthy, middle-aged architect, returns home to Kensington, London. Previously divorced, he brings his new wife: 24-year-old Nichole, whom he just married in Paris. Paul&#x27;s teenage daughter Jennifer is resentful of his remarriage and rejects Nichole&#x27;s friendly overtures. After Paul and Nichole go to bed, Jennifer sneaks out to the Off-Beat café in Soho for an evening of rock music and dancing with her friends.

The next day, Nichole plans to meet Jennifer at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art, where the latter studies, so they can have lunch together. At lunchtime, Nichole arrives at St Martin&#x27;s, but learns that Jennifer has gone to the Off-Beat. There, Nicole confronts Jennifer in front of her friends and reminds her to be home for Paul&#x27;s important business dinner that night. While leaving, Nichole passes Greta, the star performer at the strip club across the street. Greta recognises Nichole and greets her by name. However, Nichole ignores her. Jennifer suspects that Nichole was also a stripper before meeting Paul.

At Paul&#x27;s business dinner, Jennifer tries to embarrass Nichole in front of the guests by bringing up the encounter with the stripper. After the guests leave, Paul questions Nichole, who says that she knew Greta in Paris and that they were in ballet together but Greta pursued a different way of life and Nichole lost track of her. Paul accepts her explanation, but Jennifer goes to the strip club to ask Greta directly. Greta initially claims that she made a mistake and does not know Nichole, but under pressure from her boyfriend, strip club manager Kenny King, she reveals that she and Nichole worked together as strippers and occasional prostitutes in Paris. Jennifer, encouraged by Kenny, becomes enamoured with the idea of becoming a stripper herself. Jennifer is caught by Paul and Nichole coming home from the strip club at late at night and a confrontation ensues. Jennifer reveals that she spoke with Greta and threatens to tell Paul what she has learned if Nichole does not stay out of her life. At the strip club, Nicole tells Kenny and Greta to stay away from Jennifer. Kenny says that Jennifer will be welcome there any time and that if Nichole interferes, he will tell Paul about her past.

That night, Jennifer and her friends dance at Chislehurst Caves, and participate in a car race and a game of chicken on railway tracks where the last person to leave the rails before the train arrives (Jennifer) wins. Jennifer invites everyone to continue the party at her house, as Paul is out of town and Nichole presumably will not interfere. Jennifer accepts a dare to &quot;strip like a Frenchie&quot; and begins a striptease to music, but when she gets down to her underwear Nichole bursts from her bedroom and stops her. Then Paul arrives home and breaks up the party, throwing all of the beatniks out of his house. Jennifer angrily tells Paul about Nichole&#x27;s activities in Paris. Nichole, crying, admits that it is true and explains that she only did it because she was broke and hungry. Paul and Nichole profess their love for each other and reconcile.

Jennifer goes to the café, but now finds it boring. She walks out on her friends and meets Kenny at the strip club. Kenny invites her to go to Paris with him, where he can train her to be a star stripper. Greta later learns that Kenny plans to leave her and go off with Jennifer. As Kenny makes a pass at Jennifer, someone stabs him to death. The club staff, thinking Jennifer killed Kenny, lock her in a room and call the police. Jennifer screams that she did not do it, and the real culprit, Greta, emerges from behind a curtain. Meanwhile, Teddy Boys vandalise the car of Tony (one of Jennifer&#x27;s friends) and smash the guitar of Dave (another of Jennifer&#x27;s friends), intiating a confrontation between the two groups. Paul and Nichole arrive searching for Jennifer while the police drag her out of the strip club. The police release Jennifer to Paul and Nicole, and they return home, arms around each other, as Dave throws his broken guitar in the rubbish.

==Production==
===Filming===
George Minter, who ran Renown Pictures, said he wanted to make a picture &quot;for the kids&quot;.

Gillian Hills had been discovered by Roger Vadim, who considered casting her in &quot;Les liaisons dangereuses&quot;. He elected not to do so, and Hills made her film debut in this movie instead.

Filming started 27 July 1959. The movie was filmed at MGM-British Studios at Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, UK, with exteriors filmed in Soho and Chislehurst Caves (then in Kent).

Pascaline, the Haitian exotic dancer who appears in a sequence performing with a scarf, had performed in real life as an exotic dancer at the Crazy Horse Saloon in Paris.

===Music===
After Adam Faith was cast, John Barry was asked to compose the film soundtrack, because he had already been collaborating with Faith as an arranger. 

Barry was subsequently hired to score Faith&#x27;s next films, &quot;Never Let Go&quot; (1960) and &quot;Mix Me a Person&quot; (1962), leading to Barry&#x27;s successful career as a composer and arranger of film music. 

In addition to the &quot;Beat Girl&quot; soundtrack LP reaching number 11 in the album charts, the song &quot;Made You,&quot; composed by John Barry and Trevor Peacock and performed in the film by Faith, achieved minor hit status before being banned by the BBC for suggestive lyrics. A sample from the title track is used in &quot;The Rockafeller Skank,&quot; a 1998 single by Fatboy Slim, for which Barry receives a co-writer credit.

==Release==
Some versions of the released film have cut the original striptease sequences (which included topless nudity), some exposition scenes set in the strip club, the &quot;chicken&quot; game scene, and/or some opening exposition scenes with David Farrar and Noëlle Adam on a train and then with Gillian Hills at their London home.

===Censorship===
When the original script, entitled &quot;Striptease Girl,&quot; was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors in March 1959, the reviewer termed it &quot;machine-made dirt&quot; and &quot;the worst script I have read for some years&quot;. The project was then renamed &quot;Beat Girl&quot; and nudity was reduced, but censors still objected to scenes of strip tease, juvenile delinquency, and teenagers playing &quot;chicken&quot; by lying on railway tracks in front of an oncoming train. Ultimately, the film received an &quot;X&quot; certificate, causing its release to be delayed because it was queued behind a glut of other X-rated films. 

===Critical reception===
The film was bought for distribution by Victoria Films and did &quot;exceptionally well&quot; playing over 1,000 theatres, despite receiving bad reviews.

&quot;Kine Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;JEAN-AGE melodrama, with songs. Set mainly in Soho, it&#x27;s about a self-willed fifteen-year-old beatnik daughter of a successful architect, who resents her father&#x27;s pretty French second wife and decides to live for kicks, but soon gets into hot water and, chastened, returns lo the old nest. The tale is not particularly original, but the principal adults&#x27; and teenagers&#x27; performances are first-class, the list of ”cool” guest artists stretches as long as your arm, and the numbers head the current hit parade. And that&#x27;s not all. the film&#x27;s musical score, played by topnotch John Barry and his Orchestra and sung by Shirley Ann Field and Adam Faith, is the first to be recorded in its entirety on a long-playing disc. Pre-sold, the opus can hardly miss. Outstanding British gimmick offering&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; said: &quot;Cheap little dualer about a London kid who gets mixed up with beatniks, striptease, murder and problems with her father and stepmother; may click with undiscriminating audiences.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell called the film a &quot;Risible exposé-style melodrama.&quot;

The &quot;Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: &quot;[this] failed attempt to launch Adam Faith as yet another of Britain&#x27;s answers to Elvis Presley is now a great pop history lesson in teenage attitudes and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll rebellion, complete with cool jive talk and swinging sounds.&quot;

&quot;Sight and Sound&quot; said: &quot;&quot;Beat Girl&quot; evidently has one eye on US product such as &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, offering a largely studio set, mock ethnographic survey of the new teenage tribe frequenting Soho coffee bars and basement clubs, playing chicken on country roads and talking in a brand new argot (“Straight from the fridge, dad!&quot;), which screenwriter Dail Ambler quite possibly made up for the occasion. It&#x27;s a film as flummoxed as super-square patriarch David Farrar&#x27;s permanently creased brow, which perhaps explains why the producers hedged their bets by situating a striptease show across the street from the kids&#x27; espresso stop, allowing extensive onstage footage to be tailored for various export versions. ... Like so much British cinema of the time, It&#x27;s a muddled yet fascinating affair, which somehow manages to look to the future in spite of itself.&quot;

<doc id="1115218" wikidata="Q1411810" url="?curid=1115218" title="Fifth Third Bank">
<text>Fifth Third Bank (5/3 Bank), the principal subsidiary of Fifth Third Bancorp, is a bank holding company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. Fifth Third operates 1,100 branches and 2,400 automated teller machines, which are in 11 states: Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia. It is on the list of largest banks in the United States and is ranked 321st on the Fortune 500. The name &quot;Fifth Third&quot; is derived from the names of the bank&#x27;s two predecessor companies, Third National Bank and Fifth National Bank, which merged in 1909.

==History==
===Pre-merger (1858-1908)===
On June 17, 1858, the Bank of the Ohio Valley, founded by William W. Scarborough, opened in Cincinnati, Ohio. On June 23, 1863, the Third National Bank was organized. On April 29, 1871, Third National Bank acquired Bank of the Ohio Valley. In 1888, Queen City National Bank changed its name to Fifth National Bank.

===Merger of Third National Bank and Fifth National Bank (1908)===
On June 1, 1908, Third National Bank and Fifth National Bank merged to become the FifthThird National Bank of Cincinnati; the hyphen was later dropped. The merger took place when prohibitionist ideas were gaining popularity, and it is a legend that &quot;Fifth Third&quot; was better than &quot;Third Fifth&quot;, which could have been construed as a reference to three fifths of alcohol. The name went through several changesthe most recent being Fifth Third Union Trust Companyuntil March 24, 1969, when it was changed to Fifth Third Bank.

===Post-merger===

In 1999, the bank acquired Emerald Financial for $204 million.

In November 2008, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $3.4 billion in the company as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and in February 2011, the company repurchased the investment from the Treasury.

In 2009, Fifth Third completed the corporate spin-off of Fifth Third Processing Solutions, which was acquired by Worldpay, Inc. in 2012.

In May 2018, Fifth Third acquired MB Financial in a $4.7 billion transaction.

In August 2020, the bank signed a partnership with Trust &amp; Will.

In May 2022, Fifth Third acquired Dividend Finance, a San Franciscobased residential solar power lender.

In May 2023, the bank acquired Rize Money. Also in May 2023, the bank acquired Big Data Healthcare.

==Lawsuits==
In December 2016, small business owners sued Fifth Third, along with Vantiv and National Processing Company, for violating telemarketing laws. On August 4, 2022, a $50 million settlement was finalized.

On March 9, 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) charged Fifth Third with illegal cross-selling; the suit was resolved in 2024 with the bank paying $20 million and taking remedial actions. A class action suit was filed on behalf of former MB Financial shareholders, alleging that the cross-selling strategy artificially inflated Fifth Third&#x27;s stock price and thus MB Financial&#x27;s shareholders were not honestly compensated when the purchase occurred. The case was settled on September 14, 2023, with Fifth Third paying former MB Financial shareholders $5.5 million.

In September 2015, the US Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced an $18 million settlement to resolve allegations that Fifth Third Bank engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against AfricanAmerican and Hispanic borrowers in its indirect auto lending business.

On April 27, 2023, a jury sided with Fifth Third in a lawsuit filed by customers of its Early Access loan program. The program charged a 10% flat fee. While Fifth Third listed an APR estimate of 120%, the actual APR would be higher if the loan was paid off early due to the fee structure. While the jury agreed Fifth Third breached its loan agreement, it also agreed that customers were fully aware of the fee and thus were not awarded any damages.

On March 8, 2024, the Minnesota Attorney General filed suit against Fifth Third subsidiary Dividend Finance and three other lending companies (GoodLeap, Sunlight Financial, and Solar Mosaic), following an investigation that uncovered they charged Minnesotans $35 million in hidden fees on nearly 5,000 loans to finance sales of residential solar panels. The lawsuit alleges the lenders violated Minnesota state laws against deceptive trade practices, deceptive lending, and illegally high rates of interest.

<doc id="1115228" wikidata="Q2866118" url="?curid=1115228" title="Arzen">
<text>Arzen (in Syriac &quot;Arzŏn&quot; or &quot;Arzŭn&quot;, Armenian &quot;Arzn&quot;, &quot;Ałzn&quot;, Arabic &quot;Arzan&quot;) was an ancient and medieval city, located on the border zone between Upper Mesopotamia and the Armenian Highlands. The site of the ancient Armenian capital of Tigranocerta, according to modern scholars, in Late Antiquity it was the capital of the district of Arzanene, a Syriac bishopric and a Sasanian Persian border fortress in the Roman–Persian Wars of the period. After the Muslim conquests, it briefly became the seat of an autonomous dynasty of emirs in the 9th century, before being devastated in the wars between the Byzantine Empire and the Hamdanids in the 10th century. By the 12th century, it had been abandoned and ruined. Today, few traces of the town survive.

==Antiquity==
The origin of the name &quot;Arzĕn&quot; (reflecting the Armenian pronunciation) is unknown, but non-Armenian. Its site, on the banks of the river Garzan Su (ancient &quot;Nicephorius&quot;) in southeastern Turkey, was visited and identified in the early 1860s by John George Taylor, then British consul in Diyarbakir, who sketched its outline in his &quot;Travels in Kurdistan&quot; (&quot;Journal of the Royal Geographical Society&quot;, Vol. 35, 1865).

In 1995–96 (&quot;The site of Tigranocerta&quot;, in &quot;Revue des Études Arméniennes&quot;, Vol. 25, pp. 183–254 &amp; Vol. 26, pp. 51–118), T. A. Sinclair identified Arzen with the site of Tigranocerta, the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia founded by Tigranes the Great, instead of previously current identifications with Martyropolis or Kızıltepe.

In Classical Antiquity, Arzen was the chief city and capital of the district of Arzanene. Under the Kingdom of Armenia, Arzanene was governed by a march-warden (&quot;bdeašx&quot;). In the peace of 297, the city along with the rest of the district of Arzanene, and the neighbouring districts of Sophene, Ingilene, Zabdicene and Corduene was ceded to the Roman Empire by the Sasanian emperor Narseh, but returned to Sasanian control in 363. The office of &quot;bdeašx&quot; apparently continued to be filled, as a holder named Hormizd is mentioned by Procopius in 528 leading a Sasanian army.

The city is attested as a bishopric of the Syriac Church for the first time , as a suffragan of Nisibis. In the 5th and 6th centuries it was a bastion of the Sasanians in their recurrent wars with the Byzantine Empire. Its strategic importance derived from its location on the route from Amida in Upper Mesopotamia via Lake Van to the Armenian Highlands and the Armenian capitals of Artaxata and Dvin. In 578, according to Theophylact Simocatta, 10,000 people from the district were forcibly resettled by the Byzantines to Cyprus.

==Middle Ages==
The city surrendered to Iyad ibn Ghanm in 640, during the first wave of the Muslim conquests. Arab geographers included the city in the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), specifically in the district of Diyar Bakr, and often referred to it together with nearby Mayyafariqin. The region was fertile and wealthy: according to Qudama ibn Ja&#x27;far, the combined revenue of Mayyafariqin and Arzen in Abbasid times amounted to 4.1 million dirhams. Unlike the Armenian regions further north, which eventually formed part of a restored Armenian kingdom in the 9th century, Arzen and other towns on the southern periphery were quickly Arabized, and their population became indistinguishable from the inhabitants of Upper Mesopotamia or Syria. The Banu Shayban tribe, a branch of the Banu Bakr, settled in the wider area and dominated the Diyar Bakr politically until the late 9th century.

===Zurarid emirate of Arzen===
Arzen itself came to be ruled by a local Muslim dynasty, the Zurarids, which probably also descended from the Banu Bakr but whose exact origin, relationship to the Shaybanids, and early history are unknown. The first attested member of the dynasty is Musa ibn Zurara in the mid-9th century. The Zurarids intermingled with their Armenian Christian neighbours: Musa married the sister of Bagrat II Bagratuni, while his son Abu&#x27;l-Maghra married an Artsruni princess. As a result, the Zurarids tended to side with their Christian neighbours during the 9th century. Indeed, during the Armenian revolt in the early 850s, the emir Musa joined the uprising due to his opposition to the Abbasid governor Yusuf ibn Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Marwazi, and was one of the Armenian princes carried into captivity in the Abbasid capital Samarra by the Abbasid general Bugha al-Kabir. Threatened by his Shaybanid neighbours, Abu&#x27;l-Maghra, a half-Armenian married to an Armenian, even went as far as to secretly convert to Christianity, and join his forces to those of his Artsruni relatives, but in he was taken prisoner by the ambitious Shaybanid ruler of Diyar Bakr, Ahmad ibn Isa al-Shaybani, who annexed the Zurarid domains.

===Later history and abandonment===
Faced with the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s expansion under John Kourkouas in the 930s, Arzen came under Hamdanid control. A Hamdanid lieutenant, Ali ibn Ja&#x27;far al-Daylami, was appointed its governor, but rebelled against the Hamdanid emir Nasir al-Dawla in 936. The latter sent his brother, Sayf al-Dawla, to defeat the rebel and assume the governorship of the entire Diyar Bakr. During the next decades, Sayf al-Dawla would use the town as a base for his operations against the Armenian principalities to the north or the Byzantines to the west. In the course of these conflicts, the Byzantines sacked Arzen in 942. The Hamdanids soon retook it, but the area remained contested after that. During this period, the Kurds first appeared and settled in the area, quickly supplanting the Arab element.

The town declined in importance from the mid-10th century on, so that the 12th/13th-century geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi reported that it was deserted and in ruins. Apart from Taylor&#x27;s sketches, little survives of the town today, as the area has been given over to agriculture.

<doc id="1115233" wikidata="Q7396887" url="?curid=1115233" title="Saco Bay">
<text>Saco Bay ( ) is a small curved embayment of the Gulf of Maine on the Atlantic coast of Maine in the United States. 

Saco Bay is approximately 10 mi (16 km) wide, running from the Fletcher Neck (the Biddeford Pool peninsula) and the mouth of the Saco River in York County north to the Scarborough River and Prouts Neck in Scarborough, Cumberland County, Maine, approximately 13 mi (19 km) southwest of Portland. The shoreline of the bay makes the largest sand beach and salt marsh system in Maine and contains the longest unbroken stretch of beach in the state.

==Ecosystem==
Construction of a railroad causeway in the 19th century led to the closure of the Little River Inlet. This tidal re-entrant had formed the county line between York and Cumberland counties and the town line between Scarborough and Old Orchard Beach. Prior to its closure, the Pine Point region of Scarborough was a barrier island, the only one in Maine. Behind Pine Point is the state run wildlife management area for Scarborough Marsh. The marsh is 15% of the state&#x27;s total tidal marsh area and the largest contiguous marsh in Maine. The state owns and manages a reserve, of which is salt marsh, about is upland habitats, with the remainder being other types of wetlands. The marsh is an excellent site for birding as 72% of the water dependent birds that can be found in Maine can be found at the marsh. The marsh is located within of two nationally significant seabird nesting islands. The marsh has been designated essential habitat for endangered piping plovers and least terns. The Maine Audubon Society maintains a center at the marsh from which visitors can do hikes or rent a canoe and paddle through the marsh.

The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has designated Saco Bay as &quot;essential fish habitat&quot; for at least fifteen types of fish, including Atlantic salmon, hake, halibut, herring, and scallops. Stratton Island in the bay is a wildlife sanctuary owned and run by the National Audubon Society where multiple species of terns nest. Arctic, common, and roseate terns have been regulars, and in 2005 they were joined for the first time by nesting least terns.

==Sand movement and erosion==
The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) initially thought that the beach sand was coming from an underwater glacial deposit. Thus when in 1866 they were called in to protect the navigable channel of the Saco river, they built rock jetties on both sides of the mouth of the Saco river to protect the channel from sand. The north jetty was extended in 1897, 1930 and 1938, and raised at various dates through 1969. The primary source of sediment for the beaches is the Saco river. Longshore drift is dominantly to the north along the shore. About 1960 another jetty was built on the south (Pine Point) side of the mouth of the Scarborough River to protect it from sand. It was not until 1992 that the USACOE acknowledged that there is no source of sand nourishment in the area. Thus, erosion is worst at Camp Ellis in Saco at the south end of the system where the Saco jetty prevents sand from coming ashore naturally while Pine Point is growing both from the sand coming out of the Saco river and from sand eroding from Camp Ellis and other parts of the bay to its south.

Much of the inner shore of the bay is within the town of Old Orchard Beach, Maine&#x27;s largest resort beach community. The geology of the larger Gulf of Maine means that warm waters coming up the Atlantic Coast are kept far offshore, while the inshore waters are flowing from the north to the south, fed by the Labrador Current that originates from the glaciers of Greenland, making most Maine coastal waters very cold, especially to the east. The combination of Saco Bay&#x27;s western location, the inland waters of the Saco river, and the bay&#x27;s local flow from the south to the north make it the warmest water for swimming in Maine, although summer water temperatures regularly dip into the 50s (Fahrenheit).

==History==

The bay was mapped in 1605 by the French explorer Samuel de Champlain, who named it the &quot;Baie de Chouacouët&quot;, also spelled &quot;Chouacoit&quot; or &quot;Chouacoet&quot; (as recorded in &quot;The Jesuit Relations&quot;), which de Champlain said was the name used by the indigenous Abenaki people of the area. His chart of the bay and the mouth of the river has been described as one of his best charts.

In 1616, Sir Ferdinando Gorges sent Richard Vines to settle in New England. He spent the winter of 1616–1617 on Saco Bay. A pestilence was raging among the Indians, and as Vines was a physician he attended to sick Indians in the area. In 1630 the Plymouth Company gave Richard Vines and John Oldham each a tract of land on the Saco River, four miles (6 km) wide on the sea and extending eight miles (13 km) inland.
==Winslow Homer painting==

&quot;Saco Bay&quot; or &quot;Sunset, Saco Bay&quot; is a painting by Winslow Homer, showing a view of the bay from Checkley Point on the southwestern side of Prouts Neck. According to Winslow he worked on it for about 10 years, finishing only 3 days before shipping it for exhibition. It was first exhibited in 1897 at the Society of American Artists in New York City. The painting is now at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute.

<doc id="1115236" wikidata="Q3982934" url="?curid=1115236" title="Cosmic Background Imager">
<text>The Cosmic Background Imager (or CBI) was a 13-element astronomical interferometer perched at an elevation of 5,080 metres (16,700 feet) at Llano de Chajnantor Observatory in the Chilean Andes. It started operations in 1999 to study the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation and ran until 2008.

CBI conducted measurements at frequencies between 26 and 36 GHz in ten bands of 1 GHz bandwidth. It had a resolution of better than 1/10 of a degree. (In comparison, the pioneering COBE satellite, which produced the first detection of fluctuations in the microwave background in 1992, had a resolution of about 7 degrees.) Among the key findings of the CBI is the fact that fluctuations which have a small size on the sky are weaker than fluctuations which have a large size on the sky, which confirmed earlier theoretical predictions. More technically, CBI was the first experiment to detect intrinsic anisotropy in the microwave background on mass scales of galaxy clusters; it provided the first detection of the Silk damping tail; it found a hint of excess power at high-l multipoles (CBI-excess) than expected from the ΛCDM model; and it detected fluctuations in the polarization of the microwave background obtaining the first detailed E-mode polarization spectrum providing evidence that it is out of phase with the total intensity mode spectrum.

The CBI was built at the California Institute of Technology, and employed sensitive radio amplifiers from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory; two similar experiments are the Very Small Array, operated on the island of Tenerife, and the Degree Angular Scale Interferometer, operated in Antarctica. Both of these experiments used radio interferometry to measure CMB fluctuations at lower resolution over larger areas of the sky. Another experiment operated from Antarctica, the Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver, used total power (bolometric) detection and a single antenna at higher frequency and similar angular resolution to obtain results comparable to the CBI. The confluence of these and other CMB experiments employing different measurement techniques in recent years is a great triumph of observational cosmology.

CBI was a collaboration among a number of institutions in the US and Europe. It still closely collaborates with Chilean institutions Universidad de Chile and Universidad de Concepción through the Chajnantor Observatory.

In 2006, new 1.4 m antennas replaced the old 0.9 m dishes for more high-resolution studies in total intensity mode. During this stage, CBI was called CBI-2.

In June 2008, CBI-2 stopped the observations and the 13-antenna instrument was removed from its mount. The new QUIET telescope instrument was installed in August 2008 on the CBI mount, replacing CBI-2 .

<doc id="1115265" wikidata="Q7873963" url="?curid=1115265" title="USS Sea Horse (1812)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Sea Horse&quot; was a one-gun schooner that the Navy purchased in 1812 for service on Lake Borgne, near New Orleans, Louisiana. It is claimed she was one of 15 vessels available to Commodore Daniel Todd Patterson in New Orleans at the outbreak of war with Britain in 1812. The &quot;Sea Horse&quot; and USS &quot;Alligator&quot; accompanied a squadron of five gunboats at the end of 1814. In addition to these vessels, there was also a further gunboat at Fort St. Philip, as well as the USS Carolina (1812) and USS Louisiana (1812).

She saw action as a tender to a squadron of gunboats, under the command of Lieutenant Thomas ap Catesby Jones, that in December 1814 opposed the British advance on New Orleans. On the afternoon of December 13, 1814, at 2:00pm Jones despatched &quot;Sea Horse&quot; to a store house, to remove its contents, to prevent capture by the British. 

At 3:45pm, &quot;Sea Horse&quot; was moored at Bay St Louis next to a store house and a battery of two 6–pounder cannons. The schooner, with assisted by the battery, fired on three approaching launches with grapeshot, forcing them to retire out of range. &quot;Sea Horse&quot; faced a subsequent attack by four more launches as reinforcements, commanded by Captain Samuel Roberts of HMS &quot;Meteor&quot;. This renewed attack was &quot;repulsed after sustaining for nearly half an hour a very destructive fire.&quot; In the face of superior numbers, &quot;Sea Horse&quot; was scuttled and the store was set alight, an explosion occurring at 7:30pm with a large fire being visible thereafter. Jones subsequently confirmed that he had permitted Sailing Master William Johnson, her commanding officer, to destroy &quot;Sea Horse&quot; to prevent her being captured.

<text>By administrative means (в административном порядке, &quot;v administrativnom poryadke&quot;) was a term used in the Soviet Union when some actions which would normally require a court decision were left to the decision of executive bodies (administration), i.e. a form of extrajudicial punishment.

In modern Russia there are concepts of :ru:административное правонарушение, administrative process, and :ru:административная ответственность - all governed by the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses: is &quot;an unlawful, guilty action (inaction) of an individual or legal entity for which this Code or the laws of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation on administrative offenses establishes &quot;, and &quot;by administrative means&quot; refers to the application of the administrative process.

Concepts similar to &quot;administrative process&quot; exist in other countries: :de:Verwaltungsverfahren in Germany, :pl:Postępowanie administracyjne in Poland, etc.

<text>Infinite Energy is a bi-monthly magazine published in New Hampshire that details theories and experiments concerning alternative energy, new science and new physics. The magazine was founded by the late Eugene Mallove, and is owned by the non-profit New Energy Foundation. It was established in 1994 as &quot;Cold Fusion&quot; magazine and changed its name in March 1995.

Topics of interest include &quot;new hydrogen physics,&quot; also called cold fusion; vacuum energy, or zero point energy; and so-called &quot;environmental energy&quot; which they define as the attempt to violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics, for example with a perpetual motion machine. This is done in pursuit of the founder&#x27;s commitment to &quot;unearthing new sources of energy and new paradigms in science.&quot; The magazine has also published articles and book reviews that are critical of the Big Bang theory that describes the origin of the universe.

The magazine has a print run of 3,000, and is available on U.S. newsstands. The issues range in size from 48 to 100 pages.

<doc id="1115294" wikidata="Q247641" url="?curid=1115294" title="Shepherdia">
<text>Shepherdia, commonly called buffaloberry or bullberry, is a genus of small shrubs in the Elaeagnaceae family. The plants are native to northern and western North America. They are non-legume nitrogen fixers.

&quot;Shepherdia&quot; is dioecious, with male and female flowers produced on separate plants.

==Species==
The genus has three living species:

*&quot;Shepherdia argentea&quot; - silver buffaloberry
*&quot;Shepherdia canadensis&quot; - Canada buffaloberry 
*&quot;Shepherdia rotundifolia&quot; - roundleaf buffaloberry, endemic to southern Utah and northern Arizona

An additional extinct species is also placed in the genus:
*†&quot;Shepherdia weaveri&quot; - Paleocene/Eocene Kachemak Bay, Alaska

==Fruit==
The berry is recognizable by being a dark shade of red, with little white dots on them. They are rough to the touch, and are found on both trees and shrubs.

===Wildlife===
The plants have rather bitter-tasting berries. The fruit are often eaten by bears, which by legend, prefer the berries to maintain fat stores during hibernation.

Buffaloberries are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including &quot;Ectropis crepuscularia&quot; (recorded from &quot;S. canadensis&quot;) and &quot;Coleophora elaeagnisella&quot;.

===As food===
Buffaloberries are sour and can be made into jam, pie, jelly, syrup, soups, or prepared like cranberry sauce with sugar added.

<text>Shepherdia canadensis, commonly called Canada buffaloberry, russet buffaloberry, soopolallie, soapberry, or foamberry (Ktunaxa: &quot;&quot;,) is one of a small number of shrubs of the genus &quot;Shepherdia&quot; that bears edible berries.

==Description==
The plant is a deciduous shrub, growing to a maximum of . The leaves are long, green above, and whitish and brownish below. The fruit is usually red, but one variety has yellow berries. The berries have a bitter taste.

It is a non-legume nitrogen fixer.

== Etymology ==
The common name of the plant in British Columbia is &quot;soopolallie&quot;, a word derived from the historic Chinook Jargon trading language spoken in the North American Pacific Northwest in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The name is a composite of the Chinook words &quot;soop&quot; (soap) and &quot;olallie&quot; (berry).

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species is widespread in all of Canada, except in Prince Edward Island, and in the western and northern United States, including Alaska and Idaho.

It grows in openings and forest understories.

== Uses ==
The fruit is edible but the saponin chemicals it contains may cause gastrointestinal irritation if large quantities are consumed. Unrelated plants in the genus &quot;Sapindus&quot;, also commonly denominated &quot;soapberry&quot;, produce toxic saponins.

Some Canadian First Nations peoples such as Nlaka&#x27;pamux (Thompson), St&#x27;at&#x27;imc (Lillooet), and Secwepemc (Shuswap) in the Province of British Columbia extensively collect the berries. The bitter berries (which may be sweetened by frosts) are processed with other berries as Indian ice cream. The saponins create a foam when the berry is whipped into a dessert dish. First Nations peoples believe that the berry has many health properties. Native-themed restaurants in British Columbia have occasionally offered the berries on their menus.

<text>Greg Shaw (January 1949 – October 19, 2004) was an American writer, publisher, magazine editor, music historian and record executive.

==Biography==
Shaw was born in San Francisco, California. He began writing about rock and roll music as a young teenager. His first zines were Tolkien-related, but among them was also a mimeographed sheet called &quot;Mojo Navigator&quot; (full title, &quot;Mojo-Navigator Rock and Roll News&quot;) which he founded in 1966 with David Harris. &quot;Mojo Navigator&quot; is said to have been an early inspiration for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, as its co-founder Jann Wenner befriended Shaw and learned how to produce a rock magazine.

In the 1970s Shaw moved to Los Angeles with wife and partner Suzy Shaw and started the fanzine called &quot;Who Put the Bomp&quot;, popularly known as simply &quot;Bomp!&quot;, or &quot;Bomp magazine&quot;. He was hired by United Artists as assistant head of creative services. Shaw&#x27;s writing appeared in &quot;Bomp!&quot;, of which he was editor and publisher, as well as in &quot;Creem&quot;, &quot;Phonograph Record&quot; (where he again served as editor) and occasionally &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. During this time, he pursued a long-time project &quot;The Encyclopedia Of British Rock&quot;. He also later wrote a book about Elton John. &quot;Bomp&quot; featured many writers who would later become prominent, including Lester Bangs, Greil Marcus, Richard Meltzer, and Ken Barnes.

During the 1970s, Shaw worked for Sire Records, and was instrumental in the signing of Flamin&#x27; Groovies, a band that he also managed for a couple of years. In 1974, Bomp! became a record label, and Shaw released records by Devo, the Weirdos and Iggy Pop, and worked with several artists including Stiv Bators and the Dead Boys. He signed, and distributed, power pop and new wave acts such as Shoes, the Nerves, the Plimsouls and the Romantics. Bomp! Records was an LA record store for a couple of years, as well as one of the first independent distributors in the U.S.

In the 1980s, Shaw helped launch the garage revival scene with bands such as the Miracle Workers and the Pandoras. He also released music by Spacemen 3 and the Brian Jonestown Massacre in the mid to late-1990s, and appears in the Sundance award-winning documentary &quot;Dig!&quot;. In 1994, he associated with Patrick Boissel&#x27;s Alive Records, a label with music by the Black Keys, Two Gallants, the Bobby Lees, Radio Moscow, Swamp Dogg and many other artists.

In addition, he was known as a record collector, and historian, and started the &quot;Pebbles&quot; collection album series in the early 1980s.

Greg Shaw died of heart failure in Los Angeles at the age of 55.

<doc id="1115299" wikidata="Q7398672" url="?curid=1115299" title="Safety testing of explosives">
<text>The safety testing of explosives involves the determination of various properties of the different energetic materials that are used in commercial, mining, and military applications. It is highly desirable to measure the conditions under which explosives can be set off for several reasons, including: safety in handling, safety in storage, and 
safety in use.

It would be very difficult to provide an absolute scale for sensitivity with respect to the different properties of explosives. Therefore, it is generally required that one or more compounds be considered a standard for comparison to those compounds being tested. For example, PETN is considered to be a primary explosive by some individuals, and a secondary explosive by others. As a general rule, PETN is considered to be either a relatively insensitive primary explosive, or one of the most sensitive secondary explosives. PETN may be detonated by striking with a hammer on a hard steel surface (a very dangerous thing to do), and is generally considered the least sensitive explosive with which this may be done. For these facts and other reasons, PETN is considered one standard by which other explosives are gauged.

Another explosive that is used as a calibration standard is TNT, which was afforded the arbitrary Figure of Insensitivity of 100. Other explosives could then be compared against this standard.

==Types of safety testing==

Because there are different ways to set off explosives, there are several different components to the safety testing of explosives:

* Impact testing: The impact testing of explosives is performed by dropping a fixed weight onto a prepared sample of the explosive to be tested from a given distance. The weight is released, impacts upon the sample, and the result is noted. The impact distances are determined and the results are analyzed by the sensitivity test and analysis methods selected. The two most common sensitivity test and analysis methods are the Bruceton analysis and Neyer d-optimal test. These methods allow the user to determine the 50% initiation level (the distance at which 50% of the samples will &quot;go&quot;), and a standard deviation. Impact testing may also be performed with liquid samples confined in special cells.
* Friction testing. There are several techniques through which explosives may be tested to determine their sensitivity to friction. One of the most popular is the ABL friction test, which uses a line of explosives on a prepared metal plate, placed in front of a specially prepared metal wheel that is forced down upon the plate with a hydraulic press. The metal plate is then struck with a pendulum to move it, squeezing the explosives between plate and wheel as the plate moves. Initiation is determined, and analyzed by the Bruceton analysis or Neyer d-optimal test, as above. BAM friction testing is similar, except that the sample is placed on a ceramic plate which is then moved side-to-side as a ceramic peg exerts force on the sample.
* Electrostatic discharge. Testing for ESD, or &quot;spark&quot; sensitivity of explosives is performed with a machine designed to discharge from a capacitor through a prepared sample. The Sandia National Labs design employs a dipping needle that punctures a sample cell and discharges the spark simultaneously. The amount of energy discharged into the cell becomes the variable in which Bruceton analysis or Neyer d-optimal test is performed to determine spark sensitivity.
* Thermal sensitivity. Determining the point at which a compound is capable of detonating under confinement with thermal stress is useful. A fixed quantity of material is placed in an aluminum blasting cap shell, and pressed into place with an aluminum plug. The sample is immersed in a hot metal bath, and the time-to-detonation is measured. If over 60 seconds, a fresh sample is run again at a higher temperature. In this manner, it is possible to determine the temperature at which an explosive will detonate on the small scale. Unlike the other tests above, this figure is misleading as explosives have more thermal issues on the large scale. Therefore, the thermal sensitivity figures established using this technique are higher than one would expect in the real world. Thermal safety testing may also be performed via differential scanning calorimetry, in which a small (sub-milligram) sample is placed in a sample cell, and the temperature is increased slowly. The calorimeter determines how much energy is required to increase the temperature of the sample. Using this device, characteristics such as the melting point, phase transitions and decomposition temperature of an explosive may be determined.

Used together, these numbers may be used to determine the potential threats afforded by energetic materials when employed in the field. It cannot be stressed enough that these figures are relative; when we determine that impact sensitivity of an explosive is lower for that of a tested explosive than PETN, for example, the number produced in the impact test is dimensionless, but it means that it is expected that it would take a greater impact to detonate it than PETN. Therefore, an experienced ordnance technician who works with raw PETN will know that the new explosive is not as sensitive with regards to impact. However, it could be more sensitive to friction, spark, or thermal issues. These conditions must be taken into account before any compound is to be stored, handled, or used in the field.

== Fireworks ==
In the Netherlands, the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research tests the safety of fireworks. According to a 2017 report by the Dutch Safety Board, 25% of all fireworks tested failed to meet safety standards and were banned from sale. Since 2010, safety testing of fireworks is required in the entire European Union, but companies are allowed to test their products in one member state before importing and selling them in another.

<doc id="1115308" wikidata="Q2479254" url="?curid=1115308" title="Rulemaking">
<text>In administrative law, rulemaking is the process that executive and independent agencies use to create, or &quot;promulgate&quot;, regulations. In general, legislatures first set broad policy mandates by passing statutes, then agencies create more detailed regulations through &quot;rulemaking&quot;.

By bringing detailed scientific and other types of expertise to bear on policy, the rulemaking process has been the means by which some of the most far-reaching government regulations of the 20th century have been created. For example, science-based regulations are critical to modern programs for environmental protection, food safety, and workplace safety. However, the growth in regulations has fueled criticism that the rulemaking process reduces the transparency and accountability of democratic government.

==Introduction==
Legislatures rely on rulemaking to add more detailed scientific, economic, or industry expertise to a policy—fleshing out the broader mandates of authorizing legislation. For example, typically a legislature would pass a law mandating the establishment of safe drinking water standards, and then assign an agency to develop the list of contaminants and safe levels through rulemaking.

The rise of the rulemaking process itself is a matter of political controversy. Many find that obscure and complex rulemaking tends to undercut the democratic ideal of a government that is closely watched by and accountable to its citizens.

==Purposes==
Although executive agencies are usually charged with executing, not promulgating a regulatory scheme, the breadth and depth of regulation today renders it difficult, if not impossible, for legislatures to specify the details of modern regulatory schemes. As a result, the specification of these details are mostly delegated to agencies for rulemaking.

Common purposes of rulemaking include:
* &quot;Adding scientific expertise.&quot; For example, in the U.S., the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act outlaws the sale of adulterated or impure drugs. The act requires that the Department of Health and Human Services promulgate regulations establishing which laboratory tests to use to test the purity of each drug.
* &quot;Adding implementation detail.&quot; Legislation on automobile fuel efficiency, for example, often delegates the development of the actual engine tests used to calculate &#x27;city mileage&#x27; and &#x27;highway mileage&#x27;.
* &quot;Adding industry expertise.&quot; The U.S. Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act require the United States Environmental Protection Agency to determine the appropriate emissions control technologies on an industry-by-industry basis.
* &quot;Adding flexibility.&quot; More detailed regulations allow for more nuanced approaches to various conditions than a single legislative standard could. Moreover, regulations tend to be more easily changed as new data or technologies emerge.
* &quot;Finding compromise.&quot; In some cases, a divided legislature can reach an agreement on a compromise legislative standard, while each side holds out hope that the implementing regulations will be more favorable to its cause.

==The rulemaking process==

Rulemaking processes are generally designed to ensure that
* The public is informed of &quot;proposed rules&quot; before they take effect;
* The public can comment on the proposed rules and provide additional data to the agency;
* The public can access the &quot;rulemaking record&quot; and analyze the data and analysis behind a proposed rule;
* The agency analyzes and responds to the public&#x27;s comments;
* The agency creates a permanent record of its analysis and the process;
* The agency&#x27;s actions can be reviewed by a judge or others to ensure the correct process was followed.

The primary administrative law statutes and other laws that govern agency rule making include:
* The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 552 and 553
* The Housekeeping Act, 5 U.S.C. § 301, which gives heads of agencies authority to issue rules for agency employees
* The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601 et seq., which requires agencies to consider the needs of small entities in rule making
* The Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. §§ 3501 et seq., which limits the power of an agency to collect information from the public
* The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 801–808, which gives Congress the authority to review and veto any agency regulation
* The Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952, 31 U.S.C. §§ 9701, which limits the power of agencies to set user fees
* Executive Order 12866, which requires agencies to use cost-benefit balancing in all regulatory actions

For example, a typical U.S. federal rulemaking would contain these steps:
* Legislation. The U.S. Congress passes a law, containing an organic statute that creates a new administrative agency, and that outlines general goals the agency is to pursue through its rulemaking. Similarly, Congress may prescribe such goals and rulemaking duties to a pre-existing agency.
* When the agency begins to develop a rule, the agency must file with OMB to put the rule on the &quot;regulatory agenda&quot;.
* In the process of developing a rule, before publication in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the agency must “consult with members of the public” to evaluate the following:
:(i) whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency;
:(ii) the accuracy of the agency&#x27;s estimate of the burden;
:(iii) how to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and
:(iv) minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond.

* Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. This optional step entails publishing the agency&#x27;s initial analysis of the subject matter, often asking for early public input on key issues. Any data or communications regarding the upcoming rule would be made available to the public for review. Occasionally, a board of potentially affected parties is comprised to do give-and-take bargaining over rulemaking subject-matter which would otherwise result in deadlocked opposition by an interested party. This is commonly called &quot;negotiated rulemaking&quot;, and results in more custom-tailored proposed rule. An ANPRM can be a useful opportunity for the agency to collect some of the information and feedback it needs for later steps.
* If the rule is “economically significant” under Executive Order 12,866, then the agency must prepare a Regulatory Impact Analysis under OMB Circular A-4 before the agency publishes a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
* Any rule that imposes or modifies any “information collection” burden on the public must be submitted to the Director of OMB, with “objectively supported” estimates, no later than the time of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. As part of this submission, the agency must certify or demonstrate (depending on the setting), and provide a record in support of the certification, that:
(a) the information to be collected “is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency”;
(b) the agency is not seeking “unnecessarily duplicative” collection of “information otherwise reasonably accessible to the agency”;
(c) the agency “has taken every reasonable step to ensure that the proposed collection of information … is the least burdensome necessary”; and
(d) the regulations are “written using plain, coherent, and unambiguous terminology.”
* Proposed Rule. In this step, the agency publishes the actual proposed regulatory language in the Federal Register; in which a discussion of the justification and analysis behind the rule is printed, as well as the agency&#x27;s response to any public comment on the advance notice.
* Public comment. Once a proposed rule is published in the Federal Register, a public comment period begins, allowing the public to submit written comments to the agency. Most agencies are required to respond to every issue raised in the comments. Depending on the complexity of the rule, comment periods may last for 30 to even 180 days.
* Final Rule. Usually, the proposed rule becomes the final rule with some minor modifications. In this step, the agency publishes a full response to issues raised by public comments and an updated analysis and justification for the rule, including an analysis of any new data submitted by the public. In some cases, the agency may publish a second draft proposed rule, especially if the new draft is so different from the proposed rule that it raises new issues that have not been submitted to public comment. This again appears in the Federal Register, and if no further steps are taken by the public or interested parties, it is codified into the Code of Federal Regulations.
* Judicial review. In some cases, members of the public or regulated parties file a lawsuit alleging that the rulemaking is improper. While courts generally offer significant deference to the agency&#x27;s technical expertise, they do review closely whether the regulation exceeds the rulemaking authority granted by the authorizing legislation and whether the agency properly followed the process for public notice and comment.
* Effective date. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the rule does not become effective for some time after its initial publication to allow regulated parties to come into compliance. Some rules provide several years for compliance.
* &quot;Hybrid&quot; rulemaking. Not a legal term of art, but describes the kind of rulemaking performed by agencies that is somewhere between formal (with a hearing and record) and informal (with the notice and comment procedures described above). Hybrid rulemaking generally subsumes procedural aspects reserved for adjudication, such as a formal hearing in which interested parties are sworn and subject to cross-examination. The statutory construction of the Administrative Procedure Act, as well as the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.&quot;, make hybrid-rulemaking proper only when specifically provided for by the U.S. Congress.

In the United States when an agency publishes a final rule generally the rule is effective no less than thirty days after the date of publication in the Federal Register. If the agency wants to make the rule effective sooner, it must cite &quot;good cause&quot; (persuasive reasons) as to why this is in the public interest.

Significant rules (defined by Executive Order 12866) and major rules (defined by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act ) are required to have a 60-day delayed effective date.

==Rules for rulemaking==
Most modern rulemaking authorities have a common law tradition or a specific basic law that essentially regulates the regulators, subjecting the rulemaking process to standards of due process, transparency, and public participation.
* In the United States, the governing law for federal rulemaking is the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. Separate states often have parallel systems.
* Commonwealth countries use a mix of common law and similar statute law.
* The European Commission has recently developed new standards under ideas laid out in a &#x27;Whitepaper on governance.&#x27; This effort was undertaken after the Irish ‘No’ vote in 2001, addressing concerns that the public perceived the commission&#x27;s legislative and rulemaking processes as too removed from citizen input.

==Use in private industry==
Private rulemaking bodies, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, Java Community Process, and other technical communities, have adopted similar principles and frameworks to ensure fairness, transparency, and thoroughness. While the mechanics vary, these efforts follow the same pattern of an open rulemaking record, public publication of proposals, and an opportunity for public comment on those proposals before they are finalized.

==Rulemaking apparatus==
Public participation requires some official methods for the agency to communicate with the public. Generally, agencies produce an official &quot;gazette,&quot; or periodical for publishing all rulemaking notice, such as the Federal Register. Once a rule is final, the language of the rule itself (not the supporting analysis or data) is &quot;codified&quot; in the official body of regulations, such as the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

In essence, the accountability of the rulemaking system assumes that the public does take note of all of the notices in the Federal Register, which can run over a hundred pages per day. In practice, many industry or public advocacy lobbyists and lawyers monitor the Federal Register Table of Contents every day by email on behalf of their constituents or clients.

Public comments are the heart of the public&#x27;s ability to participate in the rulemaking process. The agency rulemaking is usually required to consider and publish a written response to all comments. Although high-profile rulemakings may include public hearings, most rulemakings are simply noticed in the Federal Register with a call for written comments by a set deadline.

Holding agencies accountable for objective, fact-based rulemaking requires maintaining a formal record of the facts and analysis behind the rule. Agencies must assemble and make public a &quot;rulemaking record&quot; that includes all information considered as part of the rulemaking process.

These records can be enormous and can easily fill scores to hundreds of boxes. Interested parties generally must travel to an agency repository to inspect and copy this record. In the United States, the Federal government is moving toward posting rulemaking dockets online at www.regulations.gov. Supporting documentation for 37% of new rulemakings was available on-line as of August 2006. By August 2007 it was available for 80% of new rulemakings. Interested parties frequently comb through the agency&#x27;s data to find flaws in the agency&#x27;s reasoning. Also, interested parties’ comments on the rule then become part of this record.

==Rulemaking and the courts==
In the U.S., interested parties can sue to have a judge review the rulemaking process once the rule is finalized. Interested parties frequently sue the rulemaking agency, asking the court to order the agency to reconsider. For example, environmental groups may sue, claiming that the rule is too lax on industry; or industry groups may sue, claiming that the rule is too onerous.

Traditionally, courts are reluctant to step into the shoes of the technical experts and re-open the decisions made in the agency&#x27;s detailed analysis. However, courts do review whether a rulemaking meets the standards for the rulemaking process. The basis of this review by the courts may be limited to certain questions of fairness or the procedures that ensure that both sides of a dispute are treated equally before any decision making occurs or that the decision is not patently unreasonable (under Canadian law) or Wednesbury unreasonableness (under British law) or similar doctrines described below.

These powers of review of administrative decisions, while often governed by statute, were originally developed out of the royal prerogative writs of English law such as the writ of mandamus and the writ of certiorari.

Thus, it is not enough to simply claim that the rulemaking agency could have done a better job. Instead, under U.S. administrative law, to ask the court to order changes in a rule, a party must argue that the rule is:

Arbitrary and capricious and/or unsupported by the record. Most frequently, objectors will argue that, even if the judge is not an expert, the judge can tell that there is an obvious gap in the agency&#x27;s data or analysis. A court may intervene if it finds that there is no reasonable way that the agency could have drafted the rule, given the evidence in the rulemaking record. A court may send a rule back to the agency for further analysis, generally leaving the agency to decide whether to change the rule to match the existing record or to amend the record to show how they arrived at the original rule. If a court does remand a rule back to the agency, it almost always involves an additional notice and public comment period.

Exceeds statutory authority. Frequently, opponents of a rule argue that it fails to follow the instructions of the authorizing legislation. Rules can be found to exceed statutory authority if they are too strict or too lax. If a law instructs an agency to issue regulations to ban a chemical, but the agency issues a rule that instead sets levels for safe use—or vice versa—a court may order the agency to issue a new rule.

Bolt out of the blue. Occasionally, interested parties argue that the final rule contains provisions that were never vetted during the public comment period. A court may intervene if it finds that there was no way that the commenting public could have anticipated the new provisions and provided comments. If so, the new provisions are said to be, in a colorful legal phrase, a &#x27;bolt out of the blue&#x27; rather than a reasonable course correction during the rulemaking process. Frequently, agencies will vet several options during the proposed rule phase to allow for comment on the full spectrum of rules under consideration.

<doc id="1115313" wikidata="Q4978553" url="?curid=1115313" title="Bruceton analysis">
<text>A Bruceton analysis is one way of analyzing the sensitivity of explosives as described originally by Dixon and Mood in 1948. Also known as the &quot;Up and Down Test&quot; or &quot;the staircase method&quot;, a Bruceton analysis relies upon two parameters: first stimulus and step size. A stimulus is provided to the sample, and the results noted. If a positive result is noted, then the stimulus is decremented by the step size. If a negative result occurs, the stimulus is increased. The test continues with each sample tested at a stimulus 1 step up or down from the previous stimulus if the previous result was negative or positive.

The results are tabulated and analyzed via Bruceton analysis, a simple computation of sums that can be performed by pencil and paper, to provide estimates of the mean and standard deviation. Confidence estimates are also produced.

Other analysis methods are the Neyer d-optimal test and Dror and Steinberg [2008] sequential procedure. Bruceton analysis has an advantage over the modern techniques being very simple to implement and analyze - as it was designed to be performed without a computer. The modern techniques offer a great improvement in efficiency, needing a much smaller sample size to obtain any desired significance level. Furthermore, these techniques enable the treatment of many other related experimental designs - such as when there is a need to learn the influence of more than one variable (say, testing the sensitivity of an explosive to both shock level and environment temperature), to models which are not only binary by nature (not only &quot;detonate or not&quot;), to experiments where you decide in advance (or &quot;group&quot;) on more than one sample in each &quot;run&quot;, and more. In fact, with the modern techniques the experimenter is not even constrained to specify a single model and can reflect uncertainty as to the form of the true model.

For mechanical threshold testing, typically on the up down method, originally proposed by Dixon, was used by SR Chaplan et al. in 1994. Their paper tabulated the coefficients required to process the data after testing. The mechanical thresholds generated have a discrete range of values (i.e. do not lie on an analog scale) and thus should be regarded as non-parametric for statistical purposes.

==Worked examples==
Example 1

Testing performed at an interval of d=0.2, testing commences one step before a change in response.
Each test level is assigned an index (i).
As the number of responses is less than the number of non-responses, the responses are used to determine the 50% value.
N=Sum Ni = (1+2+9+7+1+0)=20

A=Sum i*Ni=(5+8+27+14+1+0)=55

50% level = X0+d*(A/N-0.5)=3+0.45=3.45

Example 2

Testing performed at an interval of d=0.2, testing commences one step before a change in response.

As the number of non-responses is less than the number of responses, the non-responses are used to determine the 50% value.

N=Sum Ni = (0+2+12+1)=15

A=Sum i*Ni=(0+4+12+0)=16

50% level = X0+d*(A/N+0.5)=3.2+0.31=3.51

<doc id="1115329" wikidata="Q1037645" url="?curid=1115329" title="Netherlands Antilles national football team">
<text>The Netherlands Antilles national football team (; ) was the national team of the former Netherlands Antilles from 1958 to 2010. It was controlled by the Nederlands Antilliaanse Voetbal Unie. The NAVU consisted of Curaçao and Bonaire. Aruba split in 1986 and has its own team.

The Netherlands Antilles team never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. The country managed to come third in the CONCACAF championships of 1963 and 1969; during the 1963 tournament they were unofficial football world champions for four days after beating Mexico and before losing to Costa Rica.

==History==
Under the name Curaçao, the team played its first international game in 1934 (against Suriname, which was then still part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands as well) and continued to use the name Curaçao until the qualifications for the World Championships of 1958, although the name of the area had changed from &quot;Territory of Curaçao&quot; to &quot;Netherlands Antilles&quot; in 1948.

==Dissolution of country==
The Netherlands Antilles was dissolved as a unified political entity on 10 October 2010, and the five constituent islands took on new constitutional statuses within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, forming 2 new countries (Curaçao and Sint Maarten) and 3 new &quot;special municipalities&quot; of the Netherlands (&quot;namely Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius&quot;).

At the time of the dissolution, the team was about to compete in the qualification tournament for the 2010 Caribbean Championship, and finally competed under an obsolete country name. Sint Maarten national football team, as well as Bonaire national football team are already members of CONCACAF, but are not members of FIFA. The Curaçao national football team took the place of the Netherlands Antilles as a FIFA member.

<text>Torsa (occasionally Torsay) is one of the Slate Islands in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. Lying east of Luing and south of Seil, this tidal island was inhabited until the 1960s. There is now only one house there, which is used for holiday lets. The underlying bedrock is slate but unlike Torsa&#x27;s immediate island neighbours this has never been worked commercially. The island&#x27;s name is of Norse origin but the most prominent historical structure on the island is the ruined &quot;Caisteal nan Con&quot; on the northeast shore, once held by Clan Campbell. The abundant sea life in the waters surrounding the island are protected by the Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura Marine Protected Area.

==Geography==
Torsa lies just offshore from the east coast of Luing. A rough track leads down from the road to Ardinamir farm on Luing to a narrow strait, fordable at low water, and onto the south west corner of the island. This area is known as Torsa Beag (&quot;Little Torsa&quot;), which name implies a small island in its own right but it is permanently attached to the main part of Torsa by a narrow strip of land.

Torsa farmhouse, which was inhabited until the 1960s and in 2007 was a holiday let, is nearby. The bulk of the island, the total area of which extends to , lies above a raised beach at between 10 and 60 metres above sea level. There is a shallow anchorage at Ardinamir reached via a narrow entrance with drying rocks. There is no jetty on the island and holidaymakers reach it using a small dinghy. The island is relatively fertile compared to its larger neighbours with good pasture for cattle and &quot;almost its entire surface is capable of cultivation&quot;.

There are various small offshore islets on the west side of Torsa including Eilean Fraoch (Heather Island), Glas Eilean (Grey-green Island) and Sgeir a&#x27; Bodaich. The peninsula that forms the northern point of Torsa is called &quot;Eilean na h-Eaglaise&quot; - island of the church.

==Geology==
Most of Torsa comprises the Easdale Slate formation, although it has never been extracted commercially. There are post-glacial marine deposits all around the raised beach that encircles the middle of the island. Torsa Beag has been formed from a Neoproterozoic metamorphic intrusion.

==Etymology==

Torsa, archaically Torsay, is a Gaelic name derived from Old Norse. It means &quot;Thorir&#x27;s island&quot; or possibly &quot;Thor&#x27;s Island&quot;. The names were common ones and there is an early reference to the Norse presence in the Irish records to a king of &quot;Viking Scotland&quot; whose heir Thórir brought an army to Ireland in 848. Just south of Ardinamir on Luing, overlooking Torsa, there is &quot;Bàgh Lachlainn&quot; - &quot;Lachlan&#x27;s Bay&quot;. The personal name Lachlan is derived from an 11th-century term &quot;Lochlann&quot; indicating a person of Norse origin.

==History==
From about the 6th to the 8th century AD the Cenél Loairn kindred controlled what is today known as Lorn, which region includes the Slate Islands, in the then kingdom of Dalriada. By the late 8th century the area was a zone of conflict between the Celtic rulers of mainland Argyll and the newly arrived Norse settlers. Although there are few written references to the Slate Islands for this period the influence of the Norse language on placenames suggests that these islands then became part of the Kingdom of the Isles. Clan MacDougall were an important force in the area responsible for their mainland territories to the Scots crown, but to the Kings of Norway for their island territories until the 1266 Treaty of Perth when the Hebrides were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland.

&quot;Caisteal nan Con&quot; - the Dogs&#x27; Castle - is a ruined tower house that occupied a rocky eminence on the NE shore of the island. During the late Middle Ages it was held by Clan Campbell and then by the MacDougalls of Rarey at a later date, then finally Clan MacLean. It occupies a fine defensive position built on a sheer rocky outcrop overlooking the sea on three sides. The rock platform was enclosed by the oblong tower which measured about 13.7 metres by 8.8 metres and the lower, seaward portion by a bailey which included a small circular tower. In the 1970s RCAHMS reported that &quot;all the buildings are very ruinous and much overgrown with turf, but considerable portions of the external wall faces of the tower-house and bailey survive.&quot; A small rocky inlet 75 metres north east of the ruins may have been used a boat landing. The name suggests it may have been used as a hunting lodge although Torsa itself is too small to have provided much sport of this nature. It is more likely that this name is derived from a byname used of Clan MacLean by their enemies - &quot;Clann Illeathain nan Con&quot;.

By the late 17th century the Dukes of Argyll were the dominant landowners in the area and they began to lease land on a competitive basis rather than as the traditional means of strengthening the welfare of their senior clansmen. Neighbouring Seil, Luing and Shuna were subject to significant clearances of the indigenous population by Clan Campbell as early as 1699 and it is highly likely that Torsa suffered the same fate. The Slate Islands then became part of the Netherlorn estates of the Breadalbane family, a branch of Clan Campbell, whose affairs were directed from Ardmaddy Castle on the mainland.

At the beginning of the 19th century there were eleven families living on the island who made use of the traditional run rig system of cultivation. In the mid-19th century the population was recorded as 9, 5 females and 4 males and by 1909 the island had a single farm. The 1961 census was the last record of any permanent inhabitation with a single resident living there at that time.

During the 20th century most of the Breadalbane land on the Slate islands was sold off as smaller farms and individual houses. Torsa is still a part of Ardmaddy Estate today although this is now in the hands of the Struthers family. In 1928 a stone spindle whorl of unknown date was found on the central plateau of the island.

In 2024, a controversial UK-based Muslim preacher, Sheikh Yasser al-Habib, attempted to buy the island to establish a Sharia-based state but was refused by the owner. Al-Habib had raised £3 million from followers for the purchase, intending to build a school, hospital, and mosque and is accused of using the island for more malicious deeds. In response, Calvin Robinson, a Christian commentator, launched a campaign to buy the island for a Christian monastery and retreat; aiming to create a space for Christians to reconnect with their faith and resist competing ideologies.

==Wildlife==

Red deer, roe deer and foxes can be found on the island and otters and seals can sometimes be seen along the shoreline. Various boat trips operate locally offering visitors the opportunity to see cetaceans and basking sharks. The island lies near the eastern edge of the Firth of Lorn Marine Special Area of Conservation and the waters surrounding all the Slate Islands are part of the Loch Sunart to the Sound of Jura Marine Protected Area.

<text>Edward Breitung (November 10, 1831 – March 3, 1887) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. He served one term in the United States House of Representatives from 1883 to 1885.

==Early life and career==
Breitung, the son of John M. Breitung, a Lutheran minister, was born in the city of Schalkau in the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, Germany (now in Sonneberg District, Thuringia). He attended the College of Mining in Meiningen, then one of the celebrated schools in Germany for scientific and classical studies.

In 1849, after the revolution in Germany, he immigrated to the United States and settled in Kalamazoo County, Michigan. He moved to Detroit in 1851 and became a clerk in a mercantile house. He moved to Marquette and engaged in mercantile pursuits until 1859, when he went to Negaunee. Here he was also engaged in the mercantile business; however, his store burnt in 1860.

After this, he ran the Pioneer Blast Furnace in Negaunee, with Israel Case, under a four-year contract. Subsequently he engaged exclusively in iron-mining operations in 1864, explored for iron deposits in Marquette and Menominee Counties, locating several profitable mines from 1864 to 1867. He later became interested iron mining in Minnesota, and in gold and silver mining in Colorado.

On November 28, 1870, Edward married Mary Paulin, who was originally from Belgium, Wisconsin. Mary had been working as a chambermaid at a boarding house in Republic (Smith&#x27;s Mine), Michigan, where Edward owned the Republic Mine.

Edward and Mary&#x27;s first child was Edward Jr., born on November 1, 1871, in Negaunee. Their second child, William, was born in Negaunee, but became sick soon thereafter. Edward did not make it back from his Lansing duties before William&#x27;s death, on August 26 of the same year, from cholera.
==Congress==
Breitung was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives in 1873 and 1874 and a member of the Michigan State Senate in 1877 and 1878. He served as mayor of Negaunee in 1879, 1880, and 1882. He was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives from Michigan&#x27;s 11th congressional district for the Forty-eighth Congress, serving from March 4, 1883, to March 3, 1885. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1884.

==Death==

Breitung died in Eastman, Georgia before he was able to move into a winter house he had built. This was also before construction was due to begin on his new house in Marquette, Michigan. He is interred in the Breitung Mausoleum at Park Cemetery in Marquette.

Breitung Township, Minnesota, is named after him for his work in developing the Soudan Mine there in the 1880s. Breitung Township, Michigan, is also named for him.

Edward Breitung&#x27;s widow married into the Samuel R. Kaufman family of Marquette, marrying Samuel&#x27;s son Nathan Kaufman. Mary had in fact placed Nathan in effective charge of several Breitung businesses while Edward was away in Congress.

Breitung&#x27;s son, Edward N. Breitung Jr., continued his father&#x27;s successful mining enterprises in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and much further afield. Edward Jr. also married into the Kaufman family, wedding Nathan&#x27;s sister Charlotte. Despite his father&#x27;s political career, Edward Jr.&#x27;s loyalties were compromised with the outbreak of World War I. He attempted to profit through the questionable purchase of an impounded German ship. Later, his nephew, and others working in the Breitung New York office, served time for involvement in plots to bomb American factories and merchant ships.

Edward Jr. and Charlotte had one child: Juliet. Although Charlotte was grooming Juliet for New York&#x27;s high society, she eloped with their Marquette neighbor&#x27;s gardener, Max. Edward Jr. &quot;gracefully&quot; offered Max a chance to prove himself in a Breitung mine in New Mexico, where over the course of two months he faced nine life-threatening events. Coming back to New York, Max was attacked twice in the same evening, and left for dead.

<doc id="1115360" wikidata="Q12403260" url="?curid=1115360" title="TheDraw">
<text>TheDraw is a text editor for MS-DOS to create ANSI and animations as well as ASCII art. The editor is especially useful to create or modify files in ANSI format and text documents, which use the graphical characters of the IBM ASCII code pages, because they are not supported by Microsoft Windows anymore. The first version of the editor was developed in 1986 by Ian E. Davis of TheSoft Programming Services. The last public version of the editor was version 4.63, which was released in October 1993.

TheDraw was one of the first ANSI editors that supported ANSIs longer than 25 rows. The limit in the latest available version is still 100 rows. Other editors, such as ACiDDraw are able to support ANSIs larger than 100 lines for a single ANSI/ASCII (ACiDDraw supports 1,000 lines). The animation mode is limited to 50 lines (rows). The column width can be extended from the standard 80 characters to 160, but this also reduces the row limit down to 50.

==Compatibility with Microsoft Windows==
The program is stable in an MS-DOS Window on Windows XP and allows the user to maintain mouse control. Used with Windows Vista however, TheDraw performs with less predictable results. It works with DOSBox.

==Significant features==
Some of the features of the editor include:

* Mouse support to select blocks of text within the editor (even under Windows in window and full-screen mode)
* For the selected area/block exist a number of unique functions
:* Fill function to change the color of a whole section of the text
:* Copy/Move and Paste function to copy/move entire blocks of text within the document. 
:* Erase function that clears the selected area of any characters without the surrounding characters changing position.
:* Replace function to replace the content of the selected area with the content of the TheDraw &quot;clipboard&quot;.
:* Load/Save function to save only the selected area or load an ANSI/ASCII from the hard disk into the selected area (replace).
* Font manager to create/modify and organize ASCII and ANSI fonts to be used within the editor
* Additional file formats in addition to ANSI (.ANS) and text (.ASC).
:* The proprietary PCBoard (.PCB) and Wildcat! BBS (.BBS) file formats.
:* The AVATAR (.AVT) file standard defined by FidoNet.
:* Save files for various programming languages, including Assembly (.ASM), C (.H) and Turbo Pascal (.PAS).
:* Ability to save ANSIs as .COM binary, .BIN and object code (.OBJ).
:* Other supported formats: BSave (.BSV) and backup files (.BAK)
* Comprehensive help screens
* Preset transition animations to wipe or change the image
* ANSI animation support (creation and modification)
* The &quot;Draw Mode&quot; used automatically the appropriate character from the currently selected set to draw lines and corners by simply using the cursor keys (up/down/left/right)
* The default character sets can be modified and extended

<doc id="1115363" wikidata="Q7233695" url="?curid=1115363" title="Post Office Square, Boston">
<text>Post Office Square (est. 1874) in Boston, Massachusetts, is a square located in the financial district at the intersection of Milk, Congress, Pearl and Water Streets. It was named in 1874 after the United States Post Office and Sub-Treasury which fronted it, now replaced by the John W. McCormack Post Office and Courthouse.

The square is almost entirely occupied by a privately owned and managed but publicly accessible park, Norman B. Leventhal Park, named for the Boston building manager and designer who designed it. It sits above a parking garage, named &quot;The Garage at Post Office Square.&quot; The garage descends to below the surface, at the time one of the deepest points of excavation in the city. Revenues from parking fund the maintenance of the park. The park is a popular lunchtime destination for area workers. It features a café, fountains, and a pergola around a central lawn, and the management provides seat cushions for visitors during the summer. Designed by landscape architects The Halvorson Company in collaboration with Ellenzweig Architects, the park is also home to &quot;125 species of plants.&quot;

== History ==

In the 18th century, rope manufacturers occupied the area, then it became a residential district, and later a business and commercial area. The Great Boston fire of 1872 swept through the area, and as rebuilding began the area began to be called Post Office Square after the new United States Post Office and Sub-Treasury Building which faced the square.

In 1874, the headquarters of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company, designed by Nathaniel Bradlee, was erected in the square on the site of what is now Norman B. Leventhal Park. This building was demolished in 1945, and a large parking garage which filled the area of the present park was erected, being completed in 1954.

Post Office Square was the site of a 1964 speech by Lyndon B. Johnson.

There was a transformer explosion and fire in the One Post Office Square building in December 1986. An electric company worker was killed but it was after normal business hours and the building was able to be evacuated with only a few injuries.

The above-ground parking garage was demolished in 1988. The new garage, entirely underground, was opened in 1990 at a cost of $18 million, and the park above it was completed in 1992.

==Major buildings==
Significant buildings on the square include the following:
*John W. McCormack Post Office and Courthouse
*New England Telephone and Telegraph Building is a historic structure built in 1947 at 185 Franklin Street. It is a Pending Boston Landmark. A developer purchased the building in 2011 and renamed it &quot;50 Post Office Square.&quot; In this building, the laboratory in which the first telephone was built has been reconstructed.
*Langham Hotel Boston, a building that until 1977 housed the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston In 1978 it was designated a Boston Landmark.
*One Post Office Square
*100 Federal Street
*Ten Post Office Square (Atlantic National Bank Building) built 1924, a pending Boston Landmark, petition accepted for further study in 2000.

<text>The Lomami River (, , ) is a major tributary of the Congo River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The river is approximately long. It flows north, west of and parallel to the upper Congo.

The Lomami rises in the south of the country, near Kamina and the Congo–Zambezi divide. It flows north through Lubao, , Kombe, Bolaiti, Opala, and Irema before joining the Congo at Isangi.

Henry Morton Stanley reached the confluence of the two rivers on 6 Jan. 1877, &quot;the affluent Lumami, which Livingstone calls &#x27;Young&#x27;s river,&#x27; entered the great stream, by a mouth 600 yards wide, between low banks densely covered with trees.&quot;

In October 1889 M. Janssen, Governor-General of the Congo State, explored the Lomani river upstream from Isangi on the &quot;Ville de Bruxelles&quot;. After steaming for 116 hours he was stopped by rapids at a latitude of 4°27&#x27;2&quot; S.

The river has lent its name to a number of biological species, including the monkey &quot;Cercopithecus lomamiensis&quot; and the flowering plant &quot;Pavetta lomamiensis&quot;.

<doc id="1115370" wikidata="Q45585" url="?curid=1115370" title="The Starry Night">
<text>The Starry Night is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh, painted in June 1889. It depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village. It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. Described as a &quot;touchstone of modern art&quot;, &quot;The Starry Night&quot; has been regarded as one of the most recognizable paintings in the Western canon.

The painting was created in mid-June 1889, inspired by the view from Van Gogh’s bedroom window at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole monastery. The monastery functioned as a mental asylum, where Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself on May 8, 1889, following a mental breakdown and Van Gogh&#x27;s infamous act of self-mutilation that occurred in late December 1888. Catering to wealthy patients, the facility was less than half full at the time of Van Gogh&#x27;s admission, allowing the artist access to both a second-story bedroom and a ground-floor studio. During his year-long stay, he remained highly productive, creating &quot;Irises&quot;, a self-portrait, and &quot;The Starry Night&quot;.

The painting&#x27;s celestial elements include Venus, which was visible in the sky at the time, though the moon’s depiction is not astronomically accurate. The cypress trees in the foreground were exaggerated in scale compared to other works. Van Gogh&#x27;s letters suggest he viewed them primarily in aesthetic rather than symbolic terms. The village in the painting is an imaginary addition, based on sketches rather than the actual landscape seen from the asylum.

&quot;The Starry Night&quot; has been subject to various interpretations, ranging from religious symbolism to representations of Van Gogh’s emotional turmoil. Some art historians link the swirling sky to contemporary astronomical discoveries, while others see it as an expression of Van Gogh’s personal struggles. Van Gogh himself was critical of the painting, referring to it as a &quot;failure&quot; in letters to his brother. The artwork eventually made its way through several collectors before being acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1941. Scientific analysis of the painting has confirmed Van Gogh’s use of ultramarine and cobalt blue for the sky, with indian yellow and zinc yellow for the stars and moon.

==The asylum==

In the aftermath of the 23 December 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self-mutilation of his left ear, Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum on 8 May 1889. Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived, allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.

During the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, the prolific output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued. During this period, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the &quot;Irises&quot; from May 1889, now in the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the blue self-portrait from September 1889, in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay. &quot;The Starry Night&quot; was painted mid-June by around 18 June, the date he wrote to his brother Theo to say he had a new study of a starry sky.

==The painting==

Although &quot;The Starry Night&quot; was painted during the day in Van Gogh&#x27;s ground-floor studio, it would be inaccurate to state that the picture was painted from memory. The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east, a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times, including &quot;The Starry Night&quot;. &quot;Through the iron-barred window&quot;, he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, &quot;I can see an enclosed square of wheat ... above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory.&quot;

One of the first paintings of the view was F611 &quot;Mountainous Landscape Behind Saint-Rémy&quot;, now in Copenhagen. Van Gogh made several sketches for the painting, of which F1547 &quot;The Enclosed Wheatfield After a Storm&quot; is typical. It is unclear whether the painting was made in his studio or outside. In his 9 June letter describing it, he mentions he had been working outside for a few days. Van Gogh described the second of the two landscapes he mentions he was working on, in a letter to his sister Wil on 16 June 1889. This is F719 &quot;Green Wheat Field with Cypress&quot;, now in Prague, and the first painting at the asylum he painted &quot;en plein air&quot;. F1548 &quot;Wheatfield, Saint-Rémy de Provence&quot;, now in New York, is a study for it. Two days later, Vincent wrote to Theo stating that he had painted &quot;a starry sky&quot;.

&quot;The Starry Night&quot; is the only nocturne in the series of views from his bedroom window. In early June, Vincent wrote to Theo, &quot;This morning I saw the countryside from my window a long time before sunrise with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big&quot;. Researchers have determined that Venus (sometimes referred to as the &quot;morning star&quot;) was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in the spring of 1889, and was at that time nearly as bright as possible. So the brightest &quot;star&quot; in the painting, just to the viewer&#x27;s right of the cypress tree, is Venus.

The Moon is stylized, as astronomical records indicate that it was waning gibbous at the time Van Gogh painted the picture, and even if the phase of the Moon had been its waning crescent at the time, Van Gogh&#x27;s Moon would not have been astronomically correct. (For other interpretations of the Moon, see below.) The one pictorial element that was not visible from Van Gogh&#x27;s cell is the village, which is based on a sketch (F1541v) made from a hillside above the village of Saint-Rémy. Pickvance thought F1541v was done later, and the steeple more Dutch than Provençal, a conflation of several Van Gogh had painted and drawn in his Nuenen period, and thus the first of his &quot;reminisces of the North&quot; he was to paint and draw early the following year. Hulsker thought a landscape on the reverse (F1541r) was also a study for the painting.

==Interpretations==
Despite the large number of letters Van Gogh wrote, he said very little about &quot;The Starry Night&quot;. After reporting that he had painted a starry sky in June, Van Gogh next mentioned the painting in a letter to Theo on or about 20 September 1889, when he included it in a list of paintings he was sending to his brother in Paris, referring to it as a &quot;night study.&quot; Of this list of paintings, he wrote, &quot;All in all the only things I consider a little good in it are the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry, and the rest says nothing to me&quot;; &quot;the rest&quot; would include &quot;The Starry Night&quot;. When he decided to hold back three paintings from this batch to save money on postage, &quot;The Starry Night&quot; was one of the paintings he did not send. Finally, in a letter to painter Émile Bernard from late November 1889, Van Gogh referred to the painting as a &quot;failure.&quot;

Van Gogh argued with Bernard and especially Paul Gauguin as to whether one should paint from nature, as Van Gogh preferred, or paint what Gauguin called &quot;abstractions&quot;: paintings conceived in the imagination, or &quot;de tête&quot;. In the letter to Bernard, Van Gogh recounted his experiences when Gauguin lived with him from October 23, 1888, to December 25 of the same year. &quot;When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to be led astray into abstraction, as you know. . . . But that was a delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick wall. . . And yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching for stars that are too big—another failure—and I have had my fill of that.&quot; Van Gogh here is referring to the expressionistic swirls which dominate the upper center portion of &quot;The Starry Night&quot;.

Theo referred to these pictorial elements in a letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: &quot;I sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [&quot;The Starry Night&quot;] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things.&quot; Vincent responded in early November, &quot;Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel greatly driven to seek style if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can&#x27;t do anything about it. But am inclined to believe that in the long run, you&#x27;d get used to it.&quot; And later in the same letter, he wrote, &quot;I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren&#x27;t what they ought to become, however, I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses.&quot;

But although Van Gogh periodically defended the practices of Gauguin and Bernard, each time he inevitably repudiated them and continued with his preferred method of painting from nature. Like the impressionists he had met in Paris, especially Claude Monet, Van Gogh also favored working in series. He had painted his series of sunflowers in Arles, and he painted the series of cypresses and wheat fields at Saint-Rémy. &quot;The Starry Night&quot; belongs to this latter series, as well as to a small series of nocturnes he initiated in Arles.
The nocturne series was limited by the difficulties posed by painting such scenes from nature, i.e., at night. The first painting in the series was &quot;Café Terrace at Night&quot;, painted in Arles in early September 1888, followed by &quot;Starry Night (Over the Rhône)&quot; later that same month. Van Gogh&#x27;s written statements concerning these paintings provide further insight into his intentions for painting night studies in general and &quot;The Starry Night&quot; in particular.

Soon after he arrives in Arles in February 1888, Van Gogh wrote to Theo, &quot;I need a starry night with cypresses or—perhaps above a field of ripe wheat; there are some really beautiful nights here.&quot; That same week, he wrote to Bernard, &quot;A starry sky is something I should like to try to do, just as in the daytime I am going to try to paint a green meadow spangled with dandelions.&quot; He compared the stars to dots on a map and mused that, as one takes a train to travel on Earth, &quot;we take death to reach a star.&quot; Although at this point in his life Van Gogh was disillusioned by religion, he appears not to have lost his belief in an afterlife. He voiced this ambivalence in a letter to Theo after having painted &quot;Starry Night Over the Rhône&quot;, confessing to a &quot;tremendous need for, shall I say the word—for religion—so I go outside at night to paint the stars.&quot;

He wrote about existing in another dimension after death and associated this dimension with the night sky. &quot;It would be so simple and would account so much for the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but where one lands when one dies.&quot; &quot;Hope is in the stars,&quot; he wrote, but he was quick to point out that &quot;this earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or celestial orb.&quot; And he stated flatly that &quot;The Starry Night&quot; was &quot;not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas.&quot;

Noted art historian Meyer Schapiro highlights the expressionistic aspects of &quot;The Starry Night&quot;, saying it was created under the &quot;pressure of feeling&quot; and that it is a &quot;visionary [painting] inspired by a religious mood.&quot; Schapiro theorizes that the &quot;hidden content&quot; of the work refers to the New Testament Book of Revelation, revealing an &quot;apocalyptic theme of the woman in pain of birth, girded with the sun and moon and crowned with stars, whose newborn child is threatened by the dragon.&quot; (Schapiro, in the same volume, also professes to see an image of a mother and child in the clouds in &quot;Landscape with Olive Trees&quot;, painted at the same time and often regarded as a pendant to &quot;The Starry Night&quot;.)

Art historian Sven Loevgren expands on Schapiro&#x27;s approach, again calling &quot;The Starry Night&quot; a &quot;visionary painting&quot; that &quot;was conceived in a state of great agitation.&quot; He writes of the &quot;hallucinatory character of the painting and its violently expressive form,&quot; although he takes pains to note that the painting was not executed during one of Van Gogh&#x27;s incapacitating breakdowns. Loevgren compares Van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;religiously inclined longing for the beyond&quot; to the poetry of Walt Whitman. He calls &quot;The Starry Night&quot; &quot;an infinitely expressive picture which symbolizes the final absorption of the artist by the cosmos&quot; and which &quot;gives a never-to-be-forgotten sensation of standing on the threshold of eternity.&quot; Loevgren praises Schapiro&#x27;s &quot;eloquent interpretation&quot; of the painting as an apocalyptic vision and advances his symbolist theory concerning the eleven stars in one of Joseph&#x27;s dreams in the Old Testament Book of Genesis. Loevgren asserts that the pictorial elements of &quot;The Starry Night&quot; &quot;are visualized in purely symbolic terms&quot; and notes that &quot;the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.&quot;
Art historian Lauren Soth also finds a symbolist subtext in &quot;The Starry Night&quot;, saying that the painting is a &quot;traditional religious subject in disguise&quot; and a &quot;sublimated image of [Van Gogh&#x27;s] deepest religious feelings.&quot; Citing Van Gogh&#x27;s avowed admiration for the paintings of Eugène Delacroix, and especially the earlier painter&#x27;s use of Prussian blue and citron yellow in paintings of Christ, Soth theorizes that Van Gogh used these colors to represent Christ in &quot;The Starry Night&quot;. He criticizes Schapiro&#x27;s and Loevgren&#x27;s biblical interpretations, dependent as they are on a reading of the crescent moon as incorporating elements of the Sun. He says it is merely a crescent moon, which, he writes, also had symbolic meaning for Van Gogh, representing &quot;consolation.&quot;

It is in light of such symbolist interpretations of &quot;The Starry Night&quot; that art historian Albert Boime presents his study of the painting. As noted above, Boime has proven that the painting depicts not only the topographical elements of Van Gogh&#x27;s view from his asylum window but also the celestial elements, identifying not only Venus but also the constellation Aries. He suggests that Van Gogh originally intended to paint a gibbous moon but &quot;reverted to a more traditional image&quot; of the crescent moon, and theorizes that the bright aureole around the resulting crescent is a remnant of the original gibbous version. He recounts Van Gogh&#x27;s interest in the writings of Victor Hugo and Jules Verne as a possible inspiration for his belief in an afterlife on stars or planets. he provides a detailed discussion of the well-publicized advances in astronomy that took place during Van Gogh&#x27;s lifetime.

Boime asserts that while Van Gogh never mentioned astronomer Camille Flammarion in his letters, he believes that Van Gogh must have been aware of Flammarion&#x27;s popular illustrated publications, which included drawings of spiral nebulae (as galaxies were then called) as seen and photographed through telescopes. Boime interprets the swirling figure in the central portion of the sky in &quot;The Starry Night&quot; to represent either a spiral galaxy or a comet, photographs of which had also been published in popular media. He asserts that the only non-realistic elements of the painting are the village and the swirls in the sky. These swirls represent Van Gogh&#x27;s understanding of the cosmos as a living, dynamic place.

Harvard astronomer Charles A. Whitney conducted his astronomical study of &quot;The Starry Night&quot; contemporaneously with but independent of Boime (who spent almost his entire career at U.C.L.A.). While Whitney does not share Boime&#x27;s certainty about the constellation Aries, he concurs with Boime on the visibility of Venus in Provence at the time the painting was executed. He also sees the depiction of a spiral galaxy in the sky, although he gives credit for the original to Anglo-Irish astronomer William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, whose work Flammarion reproduced.
Whitney also theorizes that the swirls in the sky could represent wind, evoking the mistral that had such a profound effect on Van Gogh during the twenty-seven months he spent in Provence. (It was the mistral which triggered his first breakdown after entering the asylum, in July 1889, less than a month after painting &quot;The Starry Night&quot;.) Boime theorizes that the lighter shades of blue just above the horizon show the first light of morning.

The village has been variously identified as either a recollection of Van Gogh&#x27;s Dutch homeland, or based on a sketch he made of the town of Saint-Rémy. In either case, it is an imaginary component of the picture, not visible from the window of the asylum bedroom.

Cypress trees have long been associated with death in European culture, though the question of whether Van Gogh intended for them to have such a symbolic meaning in &quot;The Starry Night&quot; is the subject of an open debate. In an April 1888 letter to Bernard, Van Gogh referred to &quot;funereal cypresses,&quot; though this is possibly similar to saying &quot;stately oaks&quot; or &quot;weeping willows.&quot; One week after painting &quot;The Starry Night&quot;, he wrote to his brother Theo, &quot;The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts. I should like to make something of them like the canvases of the sunflowers because it astonishes me that they have not yet been done as I see them.&quot; In the same letter he mentioned &quot;two studies of cypresses of that difficult shade of bottle green.&quot; These statements suggest that Van Gogh was interested in the trees more for their formal qualities than for their symbolic connotation.

Schapiro refers to the cypress in the painting as a &quot;vague symbol of a human striving.&quot; Boime calls it the &quot;symbolic counterpart of Van Gogh&#x27;s own striving for the Infinite through non-orthodox channels.&quot; Art historian Vojtech Jirat-Wasiutynski says that for Van Gogh the cypresses &quot;function as rustic and natural obelisks&quot; providing a &quot;link between the heavens and the earth.&quot; (Some commentators see one tree, others see two or more.) Loevgren reminds the reader that &quot;the cypress is the tree of death in the Mediterranean countries.&quot;

Art historian Ronald Pickvance says that with &quot;its arbitrary collage of separate motifs,&quot; &quot;The Starry Night&quot; &quot;is overtly stamped as an &#x27;abstraction&#x27;&quot;. Pickvance claims that cypress trees were not visible facing east from Van Gogh&#x27;s room, and he includes them with the village and the swirls in the sky as products of Van Gogh&#x27;s imagination. Boime asserts that the cypresses &quot;were&quot; visible in the east, as does Jirat-Wasiutyński. Van Gogh biographers Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith concur, saying that Van Gogh &quot;telescoped&quot; the view in certain of the pictures of the view from his window, and it stands to reason that Van Gogh would do this in a painting featuring the Morning Star. Such a compression of depth serves to enhance the brightness of the planet.

Soth uses Van Gogh&#x27;s statement to his brother, that &quot;The Starry Night&quot; is &quot;an exaggeration from the point of view of arrangement&quot; to further his argument that the painting is &quot;an amalgam of images.&quot; However, it is by no means certain that Van Gogh was using &quot;arrangement&quot; as a synonym for &quot;composition.&quot; Van Gogh was speaking of three paintings, one of which was &quot;The Starry Night&quot;, when he made this comment: &quot;The olive trees with white cloud and background of mountains, as well as the Moonrise and the Night effect,&quot; as he called it, &quot;these are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts.&quot; The first two pictures are universally acknowledged to be realistic, non-composite views of their subjects. What the three pictures do have in common is exaggerated color and brushwork of the type that Theo referred to when he criticized Van Gogh for his &quot;search for style [that] takes away the real sentiment of things&quot; in &quot;The Starry Night&quot;.

On two other occasions around this time, Van Gogh used the word &quot;arrangement&quot; to refer to color, similar to the way James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term. In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, &quot;As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens. As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I&#x27;ve never devised anything better.&quot; (The painting he is referring to is &quot;La Berceuse&quot;, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.) And to Bernard in late November 1889: &quot;But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished. Ah, you&#x27;re exchanging that for something—must one say the word—something artificial—something affected.&quot;

While stopping short of calling the painting a hallucinatory vision, Naifeh and Smith discuss &quot;The Starry Night&quot; in the context of Van Gogh&#x27;s mental illness, which they identify as temporal lobe epilepsy, or latent epilepsy. &quot;Not the kind,&quot; they write, &quot;known since antiquity, that caused the limbs to jerk and the body to collapse (&#x27;the falling sickness&#x27;, as it was sometimes called), but a &quot;mental&quot; epilepsy—a seizing up of the mind: a collapse of thought, perception, reason, and emotion that manifested itself entirely in the brain and often prompted bizarre, dramatic behavior.&quot; Symptoms of the seizures &quot;resembled fireworks of electrical impulses in the brain.&quot;

Van Gogh experienced his second breakdown in seven months in July 1889. Naifeh and Smith theorize that the seeds of this breakdown were present when Van Gogh painted &quot;The Starry Night&quot;, that in giving himself over to his imagination &quot;his defenses had been breached.&quot; On that day in mid-June, in a &quot;state of heightened reality,&quot; with all the other elements of the painting in place, Van Gogh threw himself into the painting of the stars, producing, they write, &quot;a night sky unlike any other the world had ever seen with ordinary eyes.&quot; The painting echoes his thoughts and the state of mind he was in. Despite the darkness there is always hope at the end of the tunnel.

==Provenance==
After having initially held it back, Van Gogh sent &quot;The Starry Night&quot; to Theo in Paris on 28 September 1889, along with nine or ten other paintings. Theo died less than six months after Vincent, in January 1891. Theo&#x27;s widow Jo became the caretaker of Van Gogh&#x27;s legacy. In Paris in 1900 she sold the painting to a poet Julien Leclercq. In 1901 Leclercq sold it to Gauguin&#x27;s old friend Émile Schuffenecker. Jo bought the painting back from Schuffenecker and in 1906 sold it to the Oldenzeel Gallery in Rotterdam. From 1906 to 1938 it was owned by Georgette P. van Stolk, of Rotterdam, who sold it to Paul Rosenberg, of Paris and New York. It was through Rosenberg that the Museum of Modern Art acquired the painting in 1941.

==Painting materials==
The painting was investigated by scientists at the Rochester Institute of Technology and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The pigment analysis has shown that the sky was painted with ultramarine and cobalt blue, and for the stars and the moon, Van Gogh employed the rare pigment indian yellow together with zinc yellow.

<text>Mamikonian, or Mamikonean (, , &quot;Mamigonian&quot;), was an Armenian aristocratic dynasty which dominated Armenian politics between the 4th and 8th centuries. They were the most notable noble house in Early Christian Armenia after the ruling Arsacid dynasty and held the hereditary positions of (supreme commander of the army) and (royal tutor), allowing them to play the role of kingmaker for the later Armenian kings. They ruled over extensive territories, including the Armenian regions of Tayk, Taron, Sasun, and Bagrevand, among others. The Mamikonians had a reputation as supporters of the Roman (later Byzantine) Empire in Armenia against Sasanian Iran, although they also served as viceroys under Persian rule. Their influence over Armenian affairs began to decline at the end of the 6th century and suffered a final, decisive blow after a failed rebellion against Arab rule over Armenia in 774/75.

==Origin==
The origin of the Mamikonians is unknown. Movses Khorenatsi in his &quot;History of Armenia&quot; (traditionally dated to the 5th century) claims that in the year of the death of Ardashir I (i.e., 242) a nobleman of (, plural , thought to refer to China) origin named Mamgon fled to the Persian court after being sentenced to death by Arbok Chen-bakur, his foster brother (or half-brother) and the king of , due to the scheming of a third brother and prince, Bghdokh. Chen-bakur demanded Mamgon&#x27;s extradition from Ardashir&#x27;s successor, Shapur I, who instead exiled the prince to Armenia, where he entered the service of the Armenian king Trdat and received land for him and his entourage to settle, founding the Mamikonian dynasty. A slightly different story is recorded in the &quot;Primary History&quot; traditionally attributed to Sebeos, according to which two noble brothers from &#x27; named Mamik and Konak, sons of Karnam, fled to Parthia after a failed uprising against their brother, King Chenbakur. The Parthian king settled the two brothers and their household in Armenia, where they founded the Mamikonian clan. Another 5th-century Armenian historian, Pavstos Buzand, also mentions the reputed Chinese/&#x27; origin of the Mamikonians. In his &quot;History of Armenia&quot;, he twice mentions that the Mamikonians descended from the royal house of &quot;&quot;/China and as such were not inferior to the Arsacid rulers of Armenia.

Although it seems that the legend of Mamikonian origins, even if untrue, does indeed concern China, more recent scholarship suggests that &#x27; is to be identified either with the Tzans, a Kartvelian tribe in the southern Caucasus, or with a Central Asian group living near the Syr Darya river. Nicholas Adontz believed the legend to be &quot;a confusion, prompted by the love of exotic origins, between the ethnicon &quot;čen&quot; and that of the Georgian Čan-ians (Tzanni) or Lazi[...] who were settled in the neighbourhood of Tayk῾.&quot; He derives the dynasty&#x27;s name from Georgian , meaning father, combined with the Armenian diminutive suffix . This view is shared by Cyril Toumanoff, who describes the Mamikonians as the &quot;immemorial dynasts of Tayk῾.&quot; Other Armenian dynasties also claimed foreign royal ancestry: the Bagratunis claimed Davidic descent and the Artsrunis claimed royal Assyrian ancestry. The later medieval Armenian author Vardan Areveltsi mentions that the &#x27; live in the Caucasus near Derbend. One scholar argued in the 1920s that the &quot;&quot; were a Turkic group that lived by the Syr Darya.

==History==


The Mamikonians feature prominently in the works of most of the classical Armenian historians. Pavstos Buzand speaks highly favorably of the dynasty, while Movses Khorenatsi is noticeably hostile to them and minimizes their role. Under the late Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia, the family occupied a preeminent position among the Armenian noble houses: they were hereditary commanders-in-chief of the army () and royal tutors () and controlled large domains, including most of Taron and Tayk. The Mamikonians later increased their property further with the death of the last hereditary Patriarch of Armenia, Isaac in ca. 428, when they inherited many Church lands through the marriage of his only daughter to Hamazasp Mamikonian.

The family first appears in the early 4th century, although Toumanoff asserts that Mancaeus, who defended Tigranocerta against the Romans in 69 BC, was a member of the dynasty. The first Mamikonian lord, or &quot;nakharar&quot;, about whom anything certain is known was a certain Vache Mamikonian (fl. 330–339). According to Pavstos Buzand, Vache Mamikonian, son of Artavazd and of Armenia, was ordered by King Khosrov III to exterminate two feuding noble families, the Manavazians and the Ordunis. Vache also successfully defended Armenia against Sanesan, the invading king of the Maskuts, slaying the latter in a battle near Oshakan Fortress and receiving new holdings as reward. He later fell in battle against the Persians and was succeeded as &#x27; by his son Artavazd, who was a child at the time, since &quot;no other adult could be found in that clan.&quot; This episode and others in Pavstos&#x27; &quot;History&quot; illustrate the nature of the office of &#x27; as the exclusive and hereditary possession of the Mamikonian clan.

The family reappears in chronicles in 355, during the reign of Arshak (Arsaces) II. At that point the family chief was &quot;&quot; Vasak Mamikonian. When Arshak II sided with the Sasanian Empire against the Eastern Roman Empire, Vasak raided Roman lands for six years. After Arshak switched to the Roman side against Persia, Vasak Mamikonian commanded the Armenian defense, winning a series of victories against Shapur II&#x27;s forces, although he was unable to capture the rebellious Armenian nobleman Meruzhan Artsruni. After years of warfare, multiple other Armenian lords defected to the Persian side, including Vasak&#x27;s renegade brother Vahan Mamikonian. Vasak was later flayed alive after being lured to Persia for peace negotiations together with Arshak II. Shapur laid waste to Armenia and installed Meruzhan Artsruni and Vahan Mamikonian as governors (according to Pavstos, Vahan was later killed by his own son, Samuel).

Vasak was succeeded as &#x27; by his son Mushegh I Mamikonian, who restored Arshak&#x27;s heir, Pap, to the throne c. 367/370 with the support of an imperial army sent by the emperor Valens. Mushegh drove the Persians out of Armenia and brutally punished the provinces that had revolted against the Arsacid monarchy, restoring the kingdom&#x27;s former borders. Following Pap&#x27;s murder in 374, Mushegh acted as regent for the new king Varazdat (Varasdates). Varazdat attempted to free himself of Mamikonian tutelage by ordering Mushegh&#x27;s murder and replacing him as &#x27; with a non-Mamikonian noble, Smbat Saharuni&quot;.&quot;

On this event, the family leadership passed to Mushegh&#x27;s brother, Manuel Mamikonian, who had formerly been kept as a hostage in Persia. The Mamikonians at once broke into insurrection and routed Varazdat and Saharuni at Karin. Varazdat fled abroad and Manuel installed the two underage sons of Pap, Vagharshak (Vologases) and Arshak as kings of Armenia under the formal regency of their mother, Zarmandukht.&#x27; Manuel also married his daughter Vardandukht to Arshak III and accepted the suzerainty of the Sasanian Empire, as Roman power had effectively ended in the East following the defeat at Adrianople in 378. Armenia was to retain its autonomy but be overseen by a (governor) appointed by the Persian king. Manuel&#x27;s death c. 385 precipitated the partition of Armenia between the Sasanians and the Romans. Pavstos writes that Manuel was succeeded by his son Artashir as &#x27;.

Hamazasp Mamikonian is recorded as the family patriarch in 393. He married Sahakanoysh, daughter of Patriarch Isaac the Great. She was a descendant of the Arsacid kings and Saint Gregory the Illuminator. Through this marriage, the Mamikonians gained the western part of Taron centered on Ashtishat, as well as Bagrevand and Ekegheats (Acilisene). Hamazasp and Sahakanush&#x27;s eldest child Vardan Mamikonian is revered for his leadership of the Armenian rebellion against Persia in 450/451 (called &quot;&quot; in Armenian, meaning &quot;the war of Vardan and his companions&quot;).

After Vardan became &#x27; in 432, the Persians summoned him to Ctesiphon. Upon his return home in 450, Vardan repudiated Zoroastrianism and instigated a great Armenian rebellion against their Sasanian overlords, provoked by Yazdegerd II&#x27;s attempts to impose Zoroastrianism on Armenia and other outrages. The rebellion was opposed by a party of pro-Persian Armenian nobles led by &#x27; Vasak Siwni. Although Vardan and many other leading Armenian noblemen died at the Battle of Avarayr in 451, the continued insurrection led by Vardan&#x27;s nephew Vahan Mamikonian and the death of Peroz I resulted in the restoration of Armenian autonomy and religious rights with the Treaty of Nvarsak (484). Vahan was confirmed as &#x27; by the Persians and appointed &#x27; of Armenia in 485. Vardan Mamikonian, immortalized by the histories of Ghazar Parpetsi and Elishe, is venerated as a saint by the Armenian Church and commemorated by many churches in Armenia and an equestrian statue in Yerevan.

After the country&#x27;s subjugation by the Persians, the Mamikonians often sided with the Eastern Roman Empire, with many family members entering Byzantine service, most notably Vardan II Mamikonian in the late 6th century after his failed revolt against Persia. Vardan&#x27;s failed revolt marked the beginning of the decline of the Mamikonian dynasty in Armenia. The power of the Mamikonians waned further with the Arab conquest of Armenia in the late 7th century, especially relative to their great rivals, the Bagratunis (Bagratids), who were generally favored by the Arabs. Several Mamikonian nobles served as presiding princes of Armenia under Arab rule, but the house lost its traditional office of &quot;&quot; to the Bagratunis in the 8th century. Grigor Mamikonian led a rebellion against Arab rule but was defeated and forced to flee to Byzantium in ca. 748. By 750, the Mamikonians had lost Taron, Khlat, and Mush to the Bagratunis. In the 770s, the family was led by Artavazd Mamikonian, then by Mushegh IV Mamikonian (+772) and by Samuel II. The latter married his daughter to Smbat VII Bagratuni, constable of Armenia. His grandson Ashot Msaker (&quot;the Carnivorous&quot;) became forefather of the Bagratuni rulers of Armenia and Taron.

The final death-blow to the family&#x27;s power came in the mid-770s with the defeat and death of Mushegh VI Mamikonian at the Battle of Bagrevand against the Abbasids. After the battle, Mushegh&#x27;s two sons took refuge in Vaspurakan and were murdered by Meruzhan II Artsruni. Mushegh&#x27;s daughter was married off to Djahap al-Qais, a tribal chief who settled in Armenia and seized part of the former Mamikonian lands and legalized it by marrying the daughter of Mushegh VI, the last living Mamikonian prince. This marriage created the Kaysite dynasty of Arminiya centered in Manzikert, the most powerful Muslim Arab emirate in the Armenian Highlands region, and thus ending the existence of the Mamikonian line in Armenia. Only secondary lines of the family survived thereafter, both in Transcaucasia and in Byzantium. Even in their homeland of Tayk, they were succeeded by the Bagratunis. One Kurdik Mamikonian was recorded as ruling Sasun c. 800, where the Surb Karapet Monastery and family seat was. Half a century later, Grigor Mamikonian lost Bagrevand to the Muslims, reconquered it in the early 860s and then lost it to the Bagratunis, permanently. After that, the Mamikonians pass out of history.

After their disastrous uprising of 774–775, some of the Mamikonian princes moved to the Georgian lands. The latter-day Georgian feudal houses of the Liparitids-Orbeliani and Tumanishvili are sometimes surmised to have been descended from those princes.

Several scholars—most notably Cyril Toumanoff and Nicholas Adontz—have suggested a Mamikonian origin for a number of leading Byzantine families and individuals, beginning with the emperor Philippikos Bardanes in the early-8th century, the general and usurper Artabasdos in the mid-8th century, the families of men like Alexios Mosele or Empress Theodora and her brothers Bardas and Petronas in the 9th century, and the Phokas family in the 10th century. However, as the Armenian historian Nina Garsoïan comments, &quot;[a]ttractive though it is, this thesis cannot be proven for want of sources&quot;.

<text>Concordia Research Station, which opened in 2005, is a French–Italian research facility managed by l&#x27;Institut polaire français Paul-Émile Victor and Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide, that was built above sea level on a geographical formation known as dôme C, on the Antarctic Plateau, Antarctica. It is located inland from the French research station at Dumont D&#x27;Urville, inland from Australia&#x27;s Casey Station and inland from the Italian Zucchelli Station at Terra Nova Bay. Russia&#x27;s Vostok Station is away. The Geographic South Pole is away. The facility is also located within Australia&#x27;s claim on Antarctica, the Australian Antarctic Territory.

Concordia Station is the third permanent, all-year research station on the Antarctic Plateau besides Vostok Station (Russian) and the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station (U.S.) at the Geographic South Pole. It is jointly operated by scientists from France and Italy and regularly hosts ESA scientists.

The station is also known as &quot;Concordia camp&quot;, and previously as &quot;Dome Charlie&quot;.

== History ==
The first research work at dôme C began during 1978. In 1982 the French first had the idea to build a permanent base at the dôme.

In 1992, France built a new station on the Antarctic Plateau. The program was later joined by Italy in 1993.

In 1995, Pr. Jean Vernin from University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis and Pr. Giorgio Dall&#x27;Oglio from University of Rome performed the first scientific experience towards a site qualification at dôme C.

In 1996, a French-Italian team established a summer camp at dôme C. The two main objectives of the camp were the provision of logistical support for the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) and the construction of a permanent research station.

The new all-year facility, &quot;Concordia Station&quot;, became operational in 2005. The first winterover began with a staff of 13 (eleven French and 2 Italians) in February 2005.
===Winterovers===

While the station has been in use for summer campaigns since December 1997, the first winterover (February to October) was only made in 2005. During this period, the station is inaccessible, requiring total autonomy.

====First winter-over (DC01 – 2005)====

The first winter began in mid-February 2005, with thirteen wintering (eleven French people and two Italians):

*Michel Munoz: station leader, plumber, 
*Christophe Mozer: powerhouse chief

In September 2005 the highest temperature was −48 °C, with an average in August of −60.2 °C and a record of −78.6 °C on 1 September.
At these temperatures, trips outside had to be performed with the utmost care. Those going outside travelled at least in pairs and were equipped with a radio, spare batteries and a full fleece suit, with only the eyes at times visible. Italian Glaciologist Emanuele Salvietti had to take snow samples every day one kilometre from the base. As he had to walk (because no vehicle operates at these temperatures), he built a full face mask, with only a pipe to breathe. The slightest mistake would lead to certain injury, as astronomer Agabi Karim explained: &quot;Burns on the cheeks and eyelashes glued to the lens of the telescope,&quot; after exposure to the freezing cold.

===Beyond Epica-Oldest Ice===
During February 2022 initial ice core extraction of the Beyond Epica-Oldest Ice research activity was completed, located 34 km from the station. 

== Transportation==


Most of the cargo is moved to Dome C by traverse (called raid) from Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station, covering in 7 to 12 days depending on weather conditions. Station personnel and light cargo arrive by air, landing on a Skiway, using the Twin Otters or Basler BT-67 flying from DDU or Zucchelli Station at .

== Environment ==
Dome C is situated on top of the Antarctic Plateau. No animals or plants live at a distance of more than a few tens of kilometers from the Southern Ocean. However, south polar skuas have been spotted overflying the station, 1,200 km away from their nearest food sources. It is believed that these birds have learned to cross the continent instead of circumnavigating it.

== Human biology and medicine ==
Concordia Station shares many stressor characteristics similar to that of long-duration deep-space missions, in particular extreme isolation and confinement, and therefore serves as a useful analogue platform for research relevant to space medicine. During the winter, the crew are isolated from the outside world, having no transportation and limited communication for 9 months and live a prolonged period in complete darkness, at an altitude almost equivalent to 4000m at the equator. This creates physiological and psychological strains on the crew. Concordia station is particularly useful for the study of chronic hypobaric hypoxia, stress secondary to confinement and isolation, circadian rhythm and sleep disruption, individual and group psychology, telemedicine, and astrobiology. Concordia station has been proposed as one of the real-life Earth-based analogues for long-duration deep-space missions.

== Glaciology ==
In the 1970s, Dome C was the site of ice core drilling by field teams of several nations.
In the 1990s, Dome C was chosen for deep ice core drilling by the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA). Drilling at Dome C began in 1996 and was completed on 21 December 2004, reaching a drilling depth of 3270.2 m, 5 m above bedrock. The age of the oldest recovered ice is estimated to be ca. 900,000 years.

== Astronomy ==

Concordia Station has been identified as a suitable location for extremely accurate astronomical observations. The transparency of the Antarctic atmosphere permits the observation of stars even when the sun is at an elevation angle of 38°. Other advantages include the very low infrared sky emission, the high percentage of cloud-free time and the low aerosol and dust content of the atmosphere.

The median seeing measured with a DIMM Differential Image Motion Monitor placed on top of an 8.5 m high tower is 1.3 ± 0.8 arcseconds.
This is significantly worse than most major observatory sites, but similar to other observatories in Antarctica. However, Lawrence &quot;et al&quot;. considered other features of the site and concluded that &quot;Dome C is the best ground-based site to develop a new astronomical observatory&quot;, a conclusion made before whole-atmospheric seeing measurements had been made at Dome C.

Thanks to the Single Star Scidar SSS, Vernin, Chadid and Aristidi &quot;et al&quot;. and Giordano, Vernin and Chadid &quot;et al&quot;. finally demonstrated that most of the optical turbulence is concentrated within the first 30 m atmospheric level at Dome C. The rest of the atmosphere is very quiet with a seeing of about 0.3-0.4 arcseconds, and the overall seeing is somewhat around 1.0 arcseconds.

Launched in 2007, PAIX, the first robotic multi-color Antarctica Photometer
gives a new insight to cope with unresolved stellar enigma and stellar oscillation challenges and offers a great
opportunity to benefit from an access to the best astronomical site on Earth –Dome C–. Indeed, Chadid, Vernin, Preston et al.
implement, for the first time from the ground, a new way to study the stellar oscillations, pulsations and their evolutionary
properties with long uninterrupted and continuous precision observations over 150 days, and
without the regular interruptions imposed by the Earth rotation. PAIX achieves astrophysical UBVRI bands time-series measurements of stellar physics fields,
challenging photometry from Space.

The Antarctic Search for Transiting ExoPlanets (ASTEP) programme is composed of two telescopes: a 10 cm refractor installed in 2008, and a 40 cm telescope installed in 2010 and upgraded in 2022.

== Climate ==

The climate at Dome C where Concordia Station is located is frigid all year round, being one of the coldest places on Earth. It has a polar ice cap climate (Köppen &quot;EF&quot;), with maximums ranging from in December to in May, mean ranging from in December to in May and minimums ranging from in December to in May. The annual average air temperature is . The station has never recorded a temperature above freezing; the warmest temperature recorded was in January. Temperatures can fall below in winter, and the coldest recorded temperature was in August 2010; one of the coldest temperatures ever recorded on Earth.

Humidity is low and it is also very dry, with very little precipitation throughout the year.

Dome C does not experience the katabatic winds typical for the coastal regions of Antarctica because of its elevated location and its relative distance from the edges of the Antarctic Plateau. Typical wind speed in winter is 2.8 m/s.

<doc id="1115389" wikidata="Q15272035" url="?curid=1115389" title="Raynes Park">
<text>Raynes Park is a residential suburb, railway station and local centre near Wimbledon, London, and is within the London Borough of Merton. It is situated southwest of Wimbledon Common, to the northwest of Wimbledon Chase and to the east of New Malden, in South West London. It is 7.8 miles (12.5 km) southwest of Charing Cross. Towards the north and west, either side of the borough boundary with the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames are the areas of Copse Hill and Coombe with their large detached houses, golf courses and gated lands. Raynes Park had a population of 19,619 in 2011, which refers to the populations of the wards of Raynes Park and West Barnes.

== Geography ==
Raynes Park is 7.8 miles from Central London and has one of the largest proportions of green open space in South London. The area has a number of parks including Cottenham Park Recreation Ground, named after Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham, and Cannon Hill Common. It lies approximately 2.5 miles (4 km) north of the Greater London border with Surrey. 

Cannon Hill Common covers 21 hectares of open space, and is a site of borough importance – Grade 1 for Nature Conservation. It contains mature woodland that is over 140 years old and provides a habitat for a variety of fauna and flora.

==History==
Historically, the area of Raynes Park south of Coombe Lane and Kingston Road was part of the parish of Merton and the area north of that line was part of the Parish of Wimbledon. The area remained rural until late into the 19th century. The first development in the area was the opening of the London &amp; South Western Railway in May 1838 which crossed the area on a high embankment, although the station did not open until 1871.

Cottenham Park to the north of the station was the first part of the area to be laid out for development in the 1870s. It takes its name from Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham who lived in Wimbledon until his death in 1851. The name Raynes Park was originally used in the 1870s and only applied to the area south of the railway line where the local landowner, Richard Garth, Lord of the Manor of the adjacent parish of Morden, planned to develop a new garden suburb similar to that being developed by John Innes at Merton Park to the east. The name refers to the Rayne family, the previous landowners of the farmland on which Garth intended to build.

Garth laid out the northern section of Grand Drive, about as far south as Heath Drive, and Blenheim Road and persuaded the railway company to build the station. A number of detached houses were constructed, but Garth&#x27;s absence as Chief Justice of Bengal slowed the development and much of the rest of the area became a golf course and cricket grounds.
By the late Victorian period the residential development of Wimbledon was encroaching on the north side of the railway from the east but, apart from a few buildings including the Junction Tavern and a school, development around the station did not start until the beginning of the 20th century.

South of the railway, the twelve terraced roads known locally as &quot;the Apostles&quot; (although they are not named after the Apostles) were laid out over a former cricket ground starting during the Victorian period. In the 1920s, the Kingston Bypass (A3) and its spur, Bushey Road (A298), were built as dual carriageways. South of the railway, the majority of residential development occurred in the 1930s with Grand Drive being extended south into Lower Morden and new roads being developed. During the interwar period, developer George Blay was key in transforming Raynes Park into the place it is today, with his properties still known locally as &quot;Blay houses&quot;. Much of the area remains open space.

During World War II the area suffered considerable bombing, especially in 1944 from the V-1 flying bomb.

In 2015, Raynes Park High Street was a finalist in the &quot;Great British High Street&quot; competition&#x27;s London category. The competition title was eventually won by Ealing&#x27;s Pitshanger Lane.

== Transport and amenities ==

Raynes Park station is on the National Rail network. The station is at the junction of the branch line heading towards Epsom and Dorking and has four platforms. A distinctive local landmark is the station footbridge which spans all four main running lines at an angle of about 45 degrees. Another distinctive feature of the station is that the platforms are not opposite each other. The station benefits from frequent train services to central London, with approximately 210 trains to Waterloo each day, averaging about 12 per hour during service hours. Raynes Park is effectively divided into two by the Waterloo - Southampton mainline railway.

In recent years, Raynes Park has benefitted from increased investments; this includes a large Waitrose.

Raynes Park has London bus services running through Wimbledon to Colliers Wood, Tooting, Streatham and to New Malden and Kingston upon Thames, as well as nightbus services to Wandsworth, Vauxhall, Westminster and Aldwych.

Bushey Road connects the Kingston Bypass to Wimbledon Chase and Merton Park. On the south side is Prince George&#x27;s playing field which plays host to Sunday league football. The field also has other purposes and has in the past held travelling Funfairs and Hindu festival celebrations. Adjacent to the playing field is a sports and leisure centre. The area has a number of other parks and open spaces including Cottenham Park Recreation Ground and Raynes Park Sports Ground.
The nearest London Underground tube station is Wimbledon on the District line.
==Sport and leisure==

Raynes Park has a Non-League football club Raynes Park Vale F.C. who play at Prince George&#x27;s Fields. Other leisure facilities in the area include the Raynes Park Residents Lawn Tennis Club, and the Malden Golf Club. The Malden Golf Club was founded in 1893 and the parkland course is set over an area of 120 acres. Wimbledon United CC have fielded a number of Sunday cricket teams with great success at their home ground at Cottenham Park for the past 90 years. Cannon Hill Common is popular for walking, cycling, recreational fishing and angling, dog walking, bird watching and represents a small piece of countryside within the city of London. Since 2010 the MyRaynesPark Festival has taken place annually for a week during the summer, providing arts and cultural events for the local community, with previous guest speakers including Yasmin Alibhai-Brown and Tim Vine.

Wimbledon Volleyball Club is based at Raynes Park High School.

<text>Wanda G. Bryant (born June 26, 1956) is an American judge, who retired as an associate judge on the North Carolina Court of Appeals at the end of 2020.

Born in Southport, North Carolina, Bryant earned an undergraduate degree in history and comparative area studies from Duke University in 1977, then earned her Juris Doctor degree from North Carolina Central University in 1982. She worked as an assistant district attorney from 1983 to 1987, as an assistant U.S. attorney from 1989 to 1993, and as senior deputy attorney general for the state of North Carolina from 1993 to 2001. In 2001, Bryant was appointed to the North Carolina Court of Appeals by Gov. Mike Easley but was defeated for election in her own right when she ran as a Democrat in 2002. In 2004, she was elected to an eight-year term on the North Carolina Court of Appeals (expiring 2012). In the 2012 election, Bryant was endorsed for reelection for her final term by the (Raleigh) News and Observer, which cited her &quot;wide-ranging experience in the law.&quot; Bryant chose not to run for reelection in 2020 and therefore, her term ended Dec. 31, 2020. Governor Roy Cooper awarded her the Order of the Long Leaf Pine.

Bryant is married and has one child.

<doc id="1115392" wikidata="Q1108196" url="?curid=1115392" title="Coleshill, Warwickshire">
<text>Coleshill ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the North Warwickshire district of Warwickshire, England, taking its name from the River Cole, on which it stands. It had a population of 6,900 in the 2021 Census, and is situated east of Birmingham, southeast of Sutton Coldfield, south of Tamworth, northwest of Coventry by road and 13 miles (21km) west of Nuneaton. It borders the parish village of Kingshurst in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull to the west. It is also home to the 502 year The Coleshill School seated next to the dual carriageway.

==Geography==
Coleshill is located on a ridge between the rivers Cole and Blythe which converge to the north with the River Tame. It is adjacent to the border with West Midlands county, and is just outside Birmingham.

===Climate===

==History==
Coleshill began life in the Iron Age, before the Roman conquest of 43AD at the Grimstock Hill Romano-British settlement, north of the River Cole. Evidence of hut circles were found by archaeologists at the end of the 1970s. These excavations showed that throughout the Roman period there was a Romano-Celtic temple on Grimstock Hill. It had developed over the earlier Iron Age huts and had gone through at least three phases of development. The area was at the junction of two powerful Celtic Tribes – the &quot;Coritanii&quot; to the east from Leicester, and to the west the &quot;Cornovii&quot; from Viroconium Cornoviorum. In the post Roman or Arthurian period (The Dark Ages), the nucleus of Coleshill moved about a kilometre to the south, to the top of the hill. Here the present church is set and the medieval town developed around it. 

By 1066 the town was a Royal Manor held by King Edward the Confessor and is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as land held by William the Conqueror and the site of the court for the ancient hundred of Coleshill. In 1284/5 John de Clinton, elder, was granted Coleshill Manor by King Henry II, and claimed by prescription within the lordship of Coleshill, Assize of bread and ale, gallows, pillory, tumbrell and court leet, infangthef and utfangthef, a market, fair, and free warren. He died in 1316. His heir was his 12-year-old grandson, John, who subsequently married a daughter of Sir Roger Hilary, and died in 1353 or 1354 leaving one daughter Joan. She had as her first husband Sir John of Montfort, illegitimate son of Sir Peter de Montfort of Beaudesert. 

Coleshill Manor then passed to this branch of Sir Simon de Montford who moated the manor houses at Coleshill and Kingshurst. King Henry VII granted Coleshill Manor and its lands to Simon Digby in 1496 following the execution and forfeiture of Sir Simon de Montford for supporting the rebellion of Perkin Warbeck. The (Wingfield-Digby) family descendants still hold the titles. Coleshill village was granted a market charter by King John in 1207, alongside Liverpool, Leek and Great Yarmouth. During the era of stagecoach and the turnpike trusts, Coleshill became important as a major staging post on the coaching roads from London to Chester, Liverpool and Holyhead. At one point there were over twenty inns in the town. The Coleshill to Lichfield Turnpike dates from 1743.

==Notable buildings==

Many former coaching inns remain in Coleshill, mostly along the High Street and Coventry Road. One of the most notable buildings in the town is the parish&#x27;s Church of St Peter and St Paul at the top of the Market Square. It has a 52-metre (170 ft) high steeple, one of the finest in Warwickshire, dating from the 13th century. Inside there is a 12th-century font of Norman origin, which is one of the finest examples in the country. There are also medieval table tombs with effigies of knights, including John de Clinton. Just outside the south door are the preserved remains of a medieval cross. 

Church Street is the location of the town&#x27;s pillory and whipping post, which were last used in 1863. A bronze sculpture by Peter Walker in the High Street shows three themes of the town&#x27;s origins: a stagecoach wheel, a visiting circus elephant and the creation of the Typhoo Tea brand by John Sumner.

==Transport==

The town is close to the M6, M6 Toll and M42 motorways. It is on Junction 4 of the M6, with Birmingham City Centre at Junction 6, Sutton Coldfield J5, Nuneaton, Bedworth and Coventry North at J3 and Coventry East at Junction 2. The town is connected to East Birmingham by the B4114 Road which subsequently creates a road connection into Birmingham City Centre. There is also a route to Coventry via the A446, which becomes the A452 just before the A45 road junction at Stonebridge. Upon reaching the Western edge of Coventry, it is necessary to follow the A4114 road which now takes you to the city centre ring road A4053 after the A45 was diverted to run south of Coventry acting as a bypass.

Two regular bus routes serve the town. The X13 (previously called X70) passes through Coleshill between Birmingham and Chelmsley Wood operated by National Express West Midlands. The 76 passes through between Tamworth and Sutton Coldfield operated by Diamond Bus.

The town is served by Coleshill Parkway railway station, which reopened in 2007, on the site of the previous Coleshill station, which had closed in 1968. It is on the Birmingham to Peterborough Line and is served half hourly by CrossCountry as part of their service between Birmingham, Nuneaton, Leicester, Peterborough, Cambridge and Stansted Airport. Historically the town was also served by Maxstoke on the Stonebridge Railway which closed in 1917 and Coleshill railway station, originally named Forge Mills, which closed in 1968. As a result until 2007, the town&#x27;s nearest railway station was at Water Orton, some to the north-west.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter. The town is served by both BBC WM on 95.6 FM and BBC CWR on 94.8 FM. Other radio stations received in the town are Heart West Midlands on 100.7 FM, Smooth West Midlands on 105.7 FM, Capital Mid-Counties on 96.2 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Birmingham &amp; The West Midlands on 105.2 FM, and Hits Radio Coventry &amp; Warwickshire on 97.0 FM. The town is served by local newspapers, &quot;Leamington Courier&quot; and &quot;Warwick Courier&quot;.

<text>Alan Z. Thornburg (born January 10, 1967) is an American lawyer and jurist, formerly a judge on the North Carolina Court of Appeals.

Born in Sylva, North Carolina, Thornburg earned a history degree from Davidson College in 1989 and a Juris Doctor degree from Wake Forest University in 1996. His father, Lacy Thornburg, is a former North Carolina attorney general, state superior court judge, and federal district court judge.

After serving as an aide to U.S. Senator Terry Sanford and working in private practice in Asheville, North Carolina from 1997 to 2004, Thornburg was named to the North Carolina Court of Appeals in 2004. He is married and has two children.

In 2004, Thornburg sought a full eight-year term on the North Carolina Court of Appeals, but was defeated by Barbara Jackson in the statewide judicial elections.

Gov. Mike Easley appointed Thornburg to the North Carolina Board of Transportation in 2005 and then appointed him to a Superior Court judgeship in 2009. He was elected to keep his seat on the superior court bench in the November 2010 election. Thornburg is currently the senior resident superior court judge for Buncombe County.

<text>Profiteering is a pejorative term for the act of making a profit by methods considered unethical.

==Overview==
Business owners may be accused of profiteering when they raise prices during an emergency (especially a war). The term is also applied to businesses that play on political corruption to obtain government contracts.

Some types of profiteering are illegal, such as price fixing syndicates, for example on fuel subsidies (see &quot;British Airways price-fixing allegations&quot;), and other anti-competitive behaviour. Some are restricted by industry codes of conduct, e.g. aggressive marketing of products in the Third World such as baby milk (see &quot;Nestlé boycott&quot;).

==Types of profiteering==
*Price fixing
*Price gouging
*War profiteering

==Laws== 
Profiteering is illegal in several countries, including but not limited to:
*UK: Chapter 1 of the Competition Act 1998
*Germany: § 291 StGB (Criminal Code) – up to 10 years&#x27; jail maximum penalty
*Austria: § 154 StGB – up to 5 years&#x27; jail maximum penalty

<doc id="1115423" wikidata="Q1263002" url="?curid=1115423" title="Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh">
<text>Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh (), also known as Dubhaltach Óg mac Giolla Íosa Mór mac Dubhaltach Mór Mac Fhirbhisigh, Duald Mac Firbis, Dudly Ferbisie, and Dualdus Firbissius (fl. 1643 – January 1671) was an Irish scribe, translator, historian and genealogist. He was one of the last traditionally trained Irish Gaelic scholars, and was a member of the Clan MacFhirbhisigh, a leading family of northern Connacht. His best-known work is the &quot;Leabhar na nGenealach&quot;, which was published in 2004 as &quot;The Great Book of Irish Genealogies&quot;, by Éamonn de Búrca, more than 300 years after it had been written.

==Family and education==

Mac Fhirbhisigh was most likely born at the family castle, in the parish of Lackan, Tireragh, County Sligo, sometime in the first quarter of the 17th century. He was originally known as &quot;Dubhaltach Og&quot; (&quot;young Dubhaltach&quot;) to distinguish him from his grandfather, &quot;Dubhaltach Mór&quot; (&quot;big Dubhaltach&quot;).

He was the eldest of four sons born to Giolla Íosa Mór Mac Fhirbhisigh and an unnamed daughter of Eoghan Gruamadha Mac Diarmada of the Sliocht Cormaic Oig Mac Diarmada of Tireragh. It is unknown whether he himself had ever married or had children. On page nine of his Introduction to &quot;The Great Book of Irish Genealogies&quot;, Nollaig Ó Muraíle writes:

It is possible that he had received some sort of formal education in Galway, studying English, Latin and some Greek. This is implied by his use of all three languages in his works. There is also the possibility that he received additional training at the Mac Aodhagáin bardic school located at Ballymacegan, Lough Derg, County Tipperary, which was run by noted scholar, Flann Mac Aodhagáin.

Mac Fhirbhisigh&#x27;s friends and acquaintances included John Lynch, Patrick D&#x27;Arcy, Mary Bonaventure Browne, Sir James Ware, Eoin Ó Gnímh and Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh. His contemporaries include Peregrine O&#x27;Duignan, Mícheál Ó Cléirigh, Richard Martyn, Daibhidh Ó Duibhgheannáin, and Randal MacDonnell, 1st Marquess of Antrim.

Mac Fhirbhisigh&#x27;s career as a scholar overlapped with a devastating period of war, famine, and plague in Ireland (the Irish Confederate Wars of 1641–1653) but, curiously, he never mentions contemporary politics or events in his works.

==Emergence in 1643==

The first certain date that can be associated with Dubhaltach is 5 May 1643, when he was situated at Ballymacegan translating the ancient glossary &quot;Duil Laithne&quot; (&quot;the book of Latin&quot;). In that year he transcribed from an old Mac Aodhagan manuscript what is now known as the &quot;Fragmentary Annals of Ireland&quot;. According to a Latin note prefixed to the manuscript, it was made for &quot;Rev. Dr. John Lynch&quot;, then Archdeacon of Tuam.

It may also have been in 1643 that he transcribed &quot;Beatha Neimheadh Deidheanach&quot; (a legal tract) and the &quot;Chronicon Scotorum&quot;. Both of these may have been further copies made by Mac Fhirbhisigh at the behest of John Lynch.

===&quot;Seanchas Síl Ír&quot;===
At some point between 1643 and early 1645, Dubhaltach moved to the town of Galway, where in April 1645 he completed a transcription of the seventy-page historical-genealogical compilation called &quot;Seanchas Síl Ír&quot;. His source can be shown to be the late 14th-century manuscript called &quot;The Book of Uí Mhaine&quot; (also known as the &quot;Book of Ó Dubhagáin&quot;). Dubhaltach&#x27;s very faithful transcript is especially valuable as four of the original fourteen folios have since been lost.

===Work for the Poor Clares===
On 8 December 1647, Dubhaltach noted that he had completed the translation – from English into Irish – of part of one book and all of a second concerning the Rule of St. Clare, and related matters. This translation was commissioned by Mother Mary Bonaventure Browne, Abbess of the Order of the Poor Clares in Galway. The initial section had been copied by Brother Mícheál Ó Cléirigh in 1636, and it was left to Mac Fhirbhisigh to complete it. He states in a note that his place of writing was the &quot;College of Galway&quot;, most probably the college-house of the Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas, Galway. The college house was demolished in 1836, though the church itself is still in regular use. The Poor Clares are now based on Nun&#x27;s Island in Galway city centre.

===&quot;Leabhar na nGenealach&quot;===
In April 1649, Mac Fhirbhisigh was working on what would come to be considered his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Leabhar na nGenealach&quot;, or the &quot;Book of Genealogies&quot;. Nollaig Ó Muraíle describes it as &quot;a compilation of Irish genealogical lore relating to the principal Gaelic and Anglo-Norman families of Ireland and covering the period from pre-Christian times to the mid-17th century and collected from a variety of sources.&quot;

It is not known how long Dubhaltach spent collecting the necessary materials and planning the book&#x27;s layout. Nor is it known when he commenced writing; he does note that on the &quot;13 April, in Galway, 1649&quot;, he had completed a fifty-page tract on the genealogies of the Ui Bhruin down to &quot;&quot;do shlioch Brian mc Eathach Muighmheadhoin&quot;/the lineage of Brian son of Eochaidh Muighmheadhoin.&quot; That August saw him complete a catalogue of the Kings of Ireland, from Partholón to Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, entitled &quot;Réim Ríoghraidhe Éireann&quot;. He names the source of this material as &quot;Leabhar Airisean Fhearghail Uí Ghadhra&quot;, an alternative name for the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;. Exactly how this work reached Galway has never been explained.

&quot;Réim Ríoghraidhe Éireann&quot; was completed on 8 August 1649, just as the bubonic plague entered Galway on a Spanish ship. Over the next nine months it killed some 3,700 of the town&#x27;s inhabitants. Of Dubhaltach&#x27;s whereabouts and activities in this period, Ó Muraíle has the following to say:
In fact, Dubhaltach&#x27;s only remark thought to be connected with this time is what Ó Muraíle calles a &quot;breathtaking understatement&quot; that Dubhaltach writes in the &quot;Díonbhrollach&quot; (preface):
With most of the text compiled, Dubhaltach added an index of just under three thousand entries, an index being rare in a Gaelic manuscript. This was completed on the Feast of the Holy Innocents (28 December 1650) just as English parliamentary forces, completing the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, crossed the Shannon. In July, these forces, under Sir Charles Coote, began a nine-month siege of Galway which ended in the town&#x27;s surrender in April 1652.

In July 1653 at an unknown location, perhaps still in County Galway, he added further material, along with a separate index to the book&#x27;s list of Saint&#x27;s pedigrees. Ó Muraíle identifies one of his probable sources for this material as &quot;one of two early-12th-century manuscript-recensions of the work known as the &quot;Irish Liber Hynorum&quot;, while another was the great early-15th-century manuscript now known as the &quot;Leabhar Breac&quot;, formerly &quot;Leabhar More Duna Daighre&quot;&quot;.

==1656 to 1662==

In April 1656, Dubhaltach acted as a witness to his hereditary lord, Dathi Og O Dubhda (David O Dowd) upon his marriage to Dorothy O Down. He may have drafted the &quot;Articles of Agreement&quot; or marriage articles, in English. Two other Mac Fhirbihisgh family members—his brother Seamus and cousin Myles—are also listed as witnesses. In the same year he compiled a work on legendary Irish authors. It is now lost apart from a partial copy begun in May 1657. The final part of it, comprising about a third of the total, was only completed in the spring of 1666.

In October 1657 – on a Sunday – Dubhaltach was writing in Sligo town, beside the ruined Dominican Abbey. His presence there was in direct contravention of a Cromwellian edict that forbade Catholics to approach or enter towns such as Sligo. Added to that, his working on a Sunday would have further aroused Puritan ire. His labour was adding further material to &quot;Leabhar na nGenealach&quot; from manuscripts no longer extant. The tracts included &quot;Séanadh Saighre&quot; and &quot;Do Fhorshloinntibh Éireann&quot;. After this he disappears until around 1662 when he is named in an official report as liable to pay hearth-tax for a dwelling in Castletown, just a few miles north of his native Lackan. Also around this time, he is mentioned in print for the only time in his life, in &quot;Cambrensis Eversus&quot;, by John Lynch.

==Sir James Ware==

During 1665 and 1666, Dubhaltach was employed in Dublin by Sir James Ware, providing him with English translations of parts of certain Irish tracts. These included extracts from the &quot;Annals of Inisfallen&quot; and the &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot; for the years 1174–1281 and 1172–1178, respectively. From the archives of the Clan MacFhirbhisigh he drew upon documents and sources to write a tract, in English, on early and medieval Irish bishops. Few of his sources are now in existence. Much of this was used for Ware&#x27;s final work, &quot;De Praesulibus Hiberniae&quot;, a history of Irish bishops published in 1665.

===Return to Dublin===
Mac Fhirbhisigh had returned to work for Ware in Dublin by early November. On 6 November 1666 he commenced a translation, into English, of part of the &quot;Annals of Lackan&quot;. This work too is lost, and his translation of the years 1443–68 is almost all that survives of a work compiled by members of his own family since before 1397. With the death of Sir James on 1 December, Dubhaltach&#x27;s employment and time in Dublin came to an end.

==Final years and death==
After the death of Sir James, Mac Fhirbhisigh may have travelled to Gort, seeking patronage from Diarmuid Ó Seachnasaigh (Sir Dermot O Shaughnessey), as indicated by a poem he apparently composed in 1667. It is thought that also in this year or shortly after he obtained a copy of the important early Irish law tract, Senchas Már. It seems he also travelled to Larne in County Antrim, seeking patronage from Randall MacDonnell, Marquess of Antrim. Here it seems he left or sold about twelve or more manuscripts to a local bard, Eoin Ó Gnímh.

Nothing more is known of Mac Fhirbhisigh until January 1671, when his friend Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh noted in a manuscript: &quot;1670/1 mense Janu: Dualdus Firbisius obiit, a Thoma Croftono occisus.&quot; Mac Fhirbhisigh was stabbed to death by local man Thomas Crofton, at a shebeen near the village of Skreen, County Sligo. He appears to have been buried at his local church, Kilglass (&quot;Cill Molaise&quot;). The circumstances of the killing were related by Eugene O&#x27;Curry as follows:

==Fate of his manuscripts==
According to Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh – as noted by Edward Lhuyd – Dubhaltach&#x27;s manuscripts were passed on his death to his lord, David O Dowd. Ó Flaithbheartaigh himself obtained Dubhaltach&#x27;s transcript of &quot;Chronicum Scotorum&quot;. William O Sullivan believed that his law manuscripts were passed on to John Conry via the library of Tadhg O&#x27;Roddy.

In 1702, Dubhaltach&#x27;s genealogical works were in the possession of merchant and part-time scribe, Henry MacCarrick, of Sligo. &quot;Leabhar na nGenealach&quot; was in this possession till 1705, while the &quot;Cuimre&quot; disappears after 1706, fate unknown (there exists a possibility that it was in the possession of Richard Tipper of Dublin, scribe, in the years 1710–1730, as he made a copy of it).

&quot;Leabhar na nGenealach&quot; next came into the hands of Séamus Bacach
Mág Uidhir of &quot;An Leargaidh&quot; (Dowra-Blacklion area) who made a copy in 1715 or 1716 at Stranamart, north-west County Cavan. It is of poor value overall. A transcript of &quot;Réim Ríoghraidhe Éireann&quot; was made by him at Doobally in 1713. It next appeared in Dublin, held by John Conry, who penned extracts from it on 24 July 1723. He may have obtained it from the library of Tadhg O Rodaighe (Thady Roddy) of Crossfield, County Leitrim.

It was sold in 1731 to Dr John Fergus (&quot;Eoin O Fearghusa&quot;) of Jervis Street, Dublin. Fergus also acquired the anonymous copy of the Cuimre. Following his death and that of his son, Dr. Fergus&#x27;s daughter put his extensive library up for auction at their home in Abbey Street, Dublin, on 3 February 1766. &quot;Leabhar na nGenealach&quot; was purchased by Robert Jocelyn (who became 1st Earl of Roden in 1771) for £7.1.0. For much of the next hundred and fifty years, it was placed at the Jocelyn family home of Tollymore House, Newcastle, County Down, who were in part descended through a female line from the local Magennis clan.

During this time extensive use of &quot;Leabhar na nGenealach&quot; was made by Charles O&#x27;Conor (1770s), Thady Connellan (1830s), John O&#x27;Donovan (MacCarrick&#x27;s version) and Eugene O&#x27;Curry, who transcribed in between March 1836 and February 1837. Upon the death of William Henry Jocelyn, 6th Earl of Roden in 1911, it was included in a list of items sold to cover his death duties. The auction was held at Sotheby&#x27;s of London on 10 November 1911, and the manuscript was purchased by Dublin physician Dr Michael F. Cox, for £79.00. Cox died on 20 February 1926, and his son, Dublin solicitor Arthur Cox, oversaw his father&#x27;s bequest of the manuscript to University College Dublin on 23 March 1926, &quot;to be perpetually preserved in its library.&quot; During the 20th century, it was consulted by various scholars, including Eoin MacNeill, Eleanor Knott, and Father Paul Walsh. The study by Ó Muraíle commenced in 1971; this process ended with its publication in five volumes by De Burca books in 2004.

==Personal life==
There are no substantial surviving details of Dubhaltach&#x27;s personal life. It is unknown whether he married or ever had children. His brothers were Padraig (fl. 1663), Diarmaid, and Seamus (fl. 1656) but no sisters are mentioned. Nor does he record the year his father died, or even his mother&#x27;s name. During the 1690s, one &quot;Dudley Forbissy, Ardneere, clerk, commonly called Prior of the Abbey of Ardnaree&quot; appears on a list of persons &quot;Outlawed for Foreign Treason&quot;. However, the precise identity of this Father Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh of the Order of St. Augustine is not known.

In 1842, a letter (dated 15 August 1842, Dublin) was received by the Royal Irish Academy from one John Mac Firbis, a farmer, &quot;in a humble state of poverty,&quot; from the parish of Lackan, County Sligo. He stated that he was &quot;fifth in descent from the younger and only brother [sic] of Duald Mac Firbis,&quot; that, &quot;the sisters of the said Duald ... retired into Spain, where they ended their lives in a convent.&quot; Having been informed that works by Dubhaltach and his family were in the possession of the R.I.A., Mac Firbis stated that he &quot;humbly hopes, from the honour and humanity of the Noblemen and Gentlemen composing the Royal Irish Academy, that he will be allowed some consideration for those works of his ancestors.&quot; Mac Firbis is listed as John Forbes in the 1834 Tithe Allotments but there is no trace of him or his family in the 1856 Griffith&#x27;s Valuation. O Muralie suggests that as the letter was written in Dublin, Mac Firbis and his family may have been seeking financial aid while emigrating from Ireland.

Under the Anglicised surname Forbes, descendants of the Clan MacFhirbhisigh are still to be found in small numbers in north Mayo, mainly in and about the town of Ballina.

==Legacy==
MacFhirbhisigh&#x27;s endeavours ensured the survival of several invaluably important sources of medieval and early Irish history. These include three annals, an early Irish law tract, material on ecclesiastical matters, and translations. His supreme achievement however remains &quot;Leabhar na nGenealach&quot;, which together with the &quot;Cuimre&quot;, is comparable in size and scope to the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;. Yet it is especially astonishing as it was written by just one man, without any known patron, while the &quot;Four Masters&quot; was written by a team funded by Feargal O&#x27;Gara.

Yet even beyond this, his importance as a collector and transmitter has been noted by the likes of William O Sullivan and Tomas O Concheannain. Nollaig Ó Muraíle sums up his career as follows:

<doc id="1115424" wikidata="Q3500593" url="?curid=1115424" title="New eugenics">
<text>New eugenics, also known as liberal eugenics (a term coined by bioethicist Nicholas Agar), advocates enhancing human characteristics and capacities through the use of reproductive technology and human genetic engineering. Those who advocate new eugenics generally think selecting or altering embryos should be left to the preferences of parents, rather than forbidden (or left to the preferences of the state). &quot;New&quot; eugenics purports to distinguish itself from the forms of eugenics practiced and advocated in the 20th century, which fell into disrepute after World War II.

== New eugenics practices ==
Eugenics is sometimes broken into the categories of positive eugenics (encouraging reproduction among the designated &quot;fit&quot;) and negative eugenics (discouraging or prohibiting reproduction among those designated &quot;unfit&quot;). Both positive and negative eugenic programs were advocated and pursued during the early 20th century. Negative programs were responsible for the compulsory sterilization of hundreds of thousands of persons in many countries, and were included in much of the rhetoric of Nazi eugenic policies of racial hygiene and genocide. According to its proponents, new eugenics belongs in the category of positive eugenics.

New eugenics generally supports genetic modification or genetic selection of individuals for traits that are supposed to improve human welfare. The underlying idea is to improve the genetic basis of future generations and reduce incidence of genetic diseases and other undesirable traits. Some of the practices included in new eugenics are: pre-implantation diagnosis and embryo selection, selective breeding, and human embryo engineering and gene therapy.

==Ethical status ==

New eugenics was founded under the liberal ethical values of pluralism, which advocates for the respect of personal autonomy, and egalitarianism, which represents the idea of equality for all people. Arguments used in favor of new eugenics include that it is in the best interest of society that life succeeds rather than fail, and that it is acceptable to ensure that progeny has a chance of achieving this success. Ethical arguments against new eugenics include the claim that creating designer babies is not in the best interest of society as it might create a breach between genetically modified individuals and natural individuals. Additionally, some of these technologies might be economically restrictive, further increasing the socio-economical gap.

Dov Fox, a law professor at the University of San Diego, argues that liberal eugenics cannot be justified on the basis of the underlying liberal theory which inspires its name. Instead he favors traditional, coersive eugenics, arguing that reprogenetic technologies like embryo selection, cellular surgery, and human genetic engineering, which aim to enhance general purpose traits in offspring, are not practices a liberal government leaves to the discretion of parents, but practices the state makes compulsory. Fox argues that if the liberal commitment to autonomy is important enough for the state to mandate childrearing practices such as health care and basic education, that very same interest is important enough for the state to mandate safe, effective, and functionally integrated genetic practices that act on analogous all-purpose traits such as resistance to disease and general cognitive functioning. He concludes that the liberal case for compulsory eugenics is a reductio ad absurdum against liberal theory.

The United Nations International Bioethics Committee wrote that new eugenics should not be confused with the ethical problems of the 20th century eugenics movements. They have also stated the notion is nevertheless problematic as it challenges the idea of human equality and opens up new ways of discrimination and stigmatization against those who do not want or cannot afford the enhancements.

<doc id="1115425" wikidata="Q261734" url="?curid=1115425" title="Amy Robsart">
<text>Amy, Lady Dudley (; 7 June 1532 – 8 September 1560) was the first wife of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, favourite of Elizabeth I of England. She is primarily known for her death by falling down a flight of stairs, the circumstances of which have often been regarded as suspicious. Amy Robsart was the only child of a substantial Norfolk gentleman. In the vernacular of the day, her name was spelled as Amye Duddley.

At nearly 18 years of age, she married Robert Dudley, a son of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. In 1553, Robert Dudley was condemned to death and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where Amy Dudley was allowed to visit him. After his release the couple lived in straitened financial circumstances until, with the accession of Elizabeth I in late 1558, Dudley became Master of the Horse, an important court office. It was rumoured that the Queen soon fell in love with him and there was talk that Amy Dudley, who did not follow her husband to court, was suffering from an illness, and that Elizabeth would perhaps marry her favourite should his wife die. The rumours grew more sinister when Elizabeth remained single against the common expectation that she would accept one of her many foreign suitors.

Amy Dudley lived with friends in different parts of the country, having her own household and hardly ever seeing her husband. In the morning of 8 September 1560, at Cumnor Place near Oxford, she insisted on sending away her servants, and later was found dead at the foot of a flight of stairs with a broken neck and two wounds on her head. The coroner&#x27;s jury&#x27;s finding was that she had died of a fall downstairs; the verdict was &quot;misfortune&quot;, accidental death.

Amy Dudley&#x27;s death caused a scandal. Despite the inquest&#x27;s outcome, Robert Dudley was widely suspected to have orchestrated his wife&#x27;s demise, a view not shared by most modern historians. He remained Elizabeth&#x27;s closest favourite, but with respect to her reputation she could not risk a marriage with him. A tradition that Sir Richard Verney, a follower of Robert Dudley, organized Amy Dudley&#x27;s violent death evolved early, and &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot;, a notorious and influential libel of 1584 against Robert Dudley, by then Earl of Leicester, perpetuated this version of events. Interest in Amy Dudley&#x27;s fate was rekindled in the 19th century by Walter Scott&#x27;s novel, &quot;Kenilworth&quot;. The most widely accepted modern explanations of her death have been breast cancer and suicide, although a few historians have probed murder scenarios. The medical evidence of the coroner&#x27;s report, which was found in 2008, is compatible with accident as well as suicide and other violence.

==Life==
Amy Robsart was born in Norfolk, the heiress of a substantial gentleman-farmer and grazier, Sir John Robsart of Syderstone, and his wife, Elizabeth Scott. Amy Robsart grew up at her mother&#x27;s house, Stanfield Hall (near Wymondham), and, like her future husband, in a firmly Protestant household. She received a good education and wrote in a fine hand. Three days before her 18th birthday she married Robert Dudley, a younger son of John Dudley, Earl of Warwick. Amy and Robert, who were of the same age, probably first met about ten months before their wedding. The wedding contract of May 1550 specified that Amy would inherit her father&#x27;s estate only after both her parents&#x27; death, and after the marriage the young couple depended heavily on both their fathers&#x27; gifts, especially Robert&#x27;s. It was most probably a love-match, a &quot;carnal marriage&quot;, as the wedding guest William Cecil later commented disapprovingly. The marriage was celebrated on 4 June 1550 at the royal palace of Sheen, with Edward VI in attendance.

The Earl of Warwick and future Duke of Northumberland was the most powerful man in England, leading the government of the young King Edward VI. The match, though by no means a prize, was acceptable to him as it strengthened his influence in Norfolk. The young couple dwelt mostly at court or with Amy&#x27;s parents-in-law at Ely House; in the first half of 1553 they lived at Somerset House, Robert Dudley being keeper of this great Renaissance palace. In May 1553 Lady Jane Grey became Amy Dudley&#x27;s sister-in-law, and after her rule of nine days as England&#x27;s queen, Robert Dudley was sentenced to death and imprisoned in the Tower of London. He remained there from July 1553 until October 1554; from September 1553 Amy was allowed to visit &quot;and there to tarry with&quot; him at the Tower&#x27;s Lieutenant&#x27;s pleasure.

 After his release Robert Dudley was short of money and he and Amy were helped out financially by their families. Their lifestyle had to remain modest, though, and Lord Robert (as he was known) was heaping up considerable debts. Sir John Robsart died in 1554; his wife followed him to the grave in the spring of 1557, which meant that the Dudleys could inherit the Robsart estate with the Queen&#x27;s permission. Lady Amy&#x27;s ancestral manor house of Syderstone had been uninhabitable for many decades, her childhood home of Stanfield had been left to her mother for life by her first husband, but on her mother&#x27;s death had reverted to Amy Robsart&#x27;s half-brother John Appleyard, and the couple were now living in Throcking, Hertfordshire, at the house of William Hyde, when not in London. In August 1557, Robert Dudley went to fight for Philip II of Spain (who was then Mary I&#x27;s husband) at the Battle of St. Quentin in France.
From this time a business letter from Amy Dudley survives, settling some of her husband&#x27;s debts in his absence, &quot;although I forgot to move my lord thereof before his departing, he being sore troubled with weighty affairs, and I not being altogether in quiet for his sudden departing&quot;.

In the summer of 1558, Robert and Amy Dudley were looking for a suitable residence of their own in order to settle in Norfolk; nothing came of this, however, before the death of Queen Mary I in November 1558. Upon the accession of Elizabeth I Robert Dudley became Master of the Horse and his place was now at court at almost constant attendance on the Queen. By April 1559, Queen Elizabeth seemed to be in love with Lord Robert, and several diplomats reported that some at court already speculated that the Queen would marry him, &quot;in case his wife should die&quot;, as Lady Amy Dudley was very ill in one of her breasts. Very soon court observers noted that Elizabeth never let Robert Dudley from her side. He visited his wife at Throcking for a couple of days at Easter 1559, and Amy Dudley came to London in May 1559 for about a month. At this time, on 6 June, the new Spanish ambassador de Quadra wrote that her health had improved, but that she was careful with her food. She also made a trip to Suffolk; by September she was residing in the house of Sir Richard Verney at Compton Verney in Warwickshire.

By late 1559, several foreign princes were vying for the Queen&#x27;s hand; indignant at Elizabeth&#x27;s little serious interest in their candidate, the Spanish ambassador de Quadra and his Imperial colleague were informing each other and their superiors that Lord Robert was sending his wife poison and that Elizabeth was only fooling them, &quot;keeping Lord Robert&#x27;s enemies and the country engaged with words until this wicked deed of killing his wife is consummated&quot;. Parts of the nobility also held Dudley responsible for Elizabeth&#x27;s failure to marry, and plots to assassinate him abounded. In March 1560 de Quadra informed Philip II: &quot;Lord Robert told somebody … that if he live another year he will be in a very different position from now. … They say that he thinks of divorcing his wife.&quot; Lady Amy never saw her husband again after her London visit in 1559. A projected trip of his to visit her and other family never materialized. Queen Elizabeth did not really allow her favourite a wife; according to a contemporary court chronicle, he &quot;was commanded to say that he did nothing with her, when he came to her, as seldom he did&quot;.

From December 1559 until her death, Amy Dudley lived at Cumnor Place, also sometimes known as Cumnor Hall, in the village of Cumnor in Berkshire (on the outskirts of Oxford, and now in Oxfordshire). The house, an altered 14th century monastic complex, was rented by a friend of the Dudleys and possible relative of Amy, Sir Anthony Forster. He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, relations of the house&#x27;s owner. Lady Amy&#x27;s chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, with a separate entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house&#x27;s rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24 August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband. No picture of her is known to have survived, though according to the Imperial ambassador Caspar Breuner, writing in 1559, she was &quot;a very beautiful wife&quot;.

However, in 2009, Eric Ives suggested that a portrait miniature now in the Yale Center for British Art, the Yale Miniature, was, in fact, Amy Robsart. Chris Skidmore concurs with this in his 2010 book &quot;Death and the Virgin: Elizabeth, Dudley and the Mysterious Fate of Amy Robsart&quot;, adding that Robert Dudley used the oak as a personal symbol in his youth, the sitter wearing oak leaves and gillyflowers at her breast. Recently a point has been made of the fact that the sprig of yellow flowers at the lady&#x27;s breast corresponds with the colours of the Robsart coat of arms, green and yellow, or &quot;Vert&quot; and &quot;Or&quot;. The name gilliflower or gillyflower derives from the French giroflée from Greek &quot;karyophyllon&quot; meaning &quot;nut-leaf&quot;, the association deriving from the flower&#x27;s scent, making it another possible wordplay for oak for Robert or even Robsart, &quot;Robur&quot; being Latin for oak. A portrait miniature of the same woman was sold at Sotheby&#x27;s in 1983 by the Duke of Beaufort, a direct descendant of Lettice Knollys, who was the second wife of Amy&#x27;s widower Robert Dudley.

==Death and inquest==
On Sunday, 8 September 1560, the day of a fair at Abingdon, Amy Robsart was found dead at the foot of a set of stairs at Cumnor Place. Robert Dudley, at Windsor Castle with the Queen, was told of her death by a messenger on 9 September and immediately wrote to his steward Thomas Blount, who had himself just departed for Cumnor. He desperately urged him to find out what had happened and to call for an inquest; this had already been opened when Blount arrived. He informed his master that Lady Amy Dudley had risen early and

would not that day suffer one of her own sort to tarry at home, and was so earnest to have them gone to the fair, that with any of her own sort that made reason of tarrying at home she was very angry, and came to Mrs. Odingsells … who refused that day to go to the fair, and was very angry with her also. Because [Mrs. Odingsells] said it was no day for gentlewomen to go … Whereunto my lady answered and said that she might choose and go at her pleasure, but all hers should go; and was very angry. They asked who should keep her company if all they went; she said Mrs. Owen should keep her company at dinner; the same tale doth Picto, who doth dearly love her, confirm. Certainly, my Lord, as little while as I have been here, I have heard divers tales of her that maketh me judge her to be a strange woman of mind.

Mrs. Picto was Lady Amy Dudley&#x27;s maid and Thomas Blount asked whether she thought what had happened was &quot;chance or villany&quot;: she said by her faith she doth judge very chance, and neither done by man nor by herself. For herself, she said, she was a good virtuous gentlewoman, and daily would pray upon her knees; and divers times she saith that she hath heard her pray to God to deliver her from desperation. Then, said I, she might have an evil toy [suicide] in her mind. No, good Mr. Blount, said Picto, do not judge so of my words; if you should so gather, I am sorry I said so much.
Blount continued, wondering: 

My Lord, it is most strange that this chance should fall upon you. It passeth the judgment of any man to say how it is; but truly the tales I do hear of her maketh me to think she had a strange mind in her: as I will tell you at my coming.


The coroner and the 15 jurors were local gentlemen and yeomen of substance. A few days later Blount wrote that some of the jury were no friends of Anthony Forster (a good sign that they would not &quot;conceal any fault, if any be&quot;) and that they were proceeding very thoroughly: 
they be very secret, and yet do I hear a whispering that they can find no presumptions of evil. And if I may say to your Lordship my conscience: I think some of them be sorry for it, God forgive me. … Mine own opinion is much quieted … the circumstances and as many things as I can learn doth persuade me that only misfortune
hath done it, and nothing else.

The jury&#x27;s foreman assured Robert Dudley in a letter of his own that for all they could find out, it appeared to be an accident. Dudley, desperately seeking to avert damage from what he called &quot;my case&quot;, was relieved to hear the impending outcome, but thought &quot;another substantial company of honest men&quot; should undertake a further investigation &quot;for more knowledge of truth&quot;. This panel should include any of Lady Amy&#x27;s available friends and her half-brothers John Appleyard and Arthur Robsart, both of whom he had ordered to Cumnor immediately after Amy&#x27;s death. Nothing came of this proposal.

The coroner&#x27;s verdict, pronounced at the local Assizes on 1 August 1561, was that Lady Amy Dudley, &quot;being alone in a certain chamber … accidentally fell precipitously down&quot; the adjoining stairs &quot;to the very bottom of the same&quot;. She had sustained two head injuries—one &quot;of the depth of a quarter of a thumb&quot;, the other &quot;of the depth of two thumbs&quot;. She had also, &quot;by reason of the accidental injury or of that fall and of Lady Amy&#x27;s own body weight falling down the aforesaid stairs&quot;, broken her neck, &quot;on account of which … the same Lady Amy then and there died instantly; … and thus the jurors say on their oath that the Lady Amy … by misfortune came to her death and not otherwise, as they are able to agree at present&quot;.

Following her death, Amy Dudley&#x27;s body was taken to Gloucester Hall, Oxford, where it lay in the room which may now be the Junior Common Room of Worcester College, Oxford. Her coffin was covered with black cloth and the arms of the Earl of Leicester. She was buried at St. Mary&#x27;s, Oxford, on 22 September 1560 with full pomp, including attendance by the Garter King of Arms and other heralds, which cost Dudley some £2,000 (roughly £1 million in 2021). He wore mourning for about six months but, as was within custom, did not attend the funeral, at which Lady Amy Dudley&#x27;s half-brothers and neighbours, as well as prominent city and county citizens, played leading parts. The court went into mourning for over a month; Robert Dudley retired to his house at Kew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams / Archer / Bernard p. 66&quot;&gt;Adams, Archer, and Bernard 2003 p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Amy Dudley&#x27;s death, happening amid renewed rumours about the Queen and her favourite, caused &quot;grievous and dangerous suspicion, and muttering&quot; in the country. Robert Dudley was shocked, dreading &quot;the malicious talk that I know the wicked world will use&quot;. William Cecil, the Queen&#x27;s Principal Secretary, felt himself threatened by the prospect of Dudley&#x27;s becoming king consort and spread rumours against the eventuality.

Already knowing of her death before it was officially made public, he told the Spanish ambassador that Lord Robert and the Queen wished to marry and were about to do away with Lady Amy Dudley by poison, &quot;giving out that she was ill but she was not ill at all&quot;. Likewise strongly opposed to a Dudley marriage, Nicholas Throckmorton, the English ambassador in France, went out of his way to draw attention to the scandalous gossip he heard at the French court. Although Cecil and Throckmorton made use of the scandal for their political and personal aims, they did not believe themselves that Robert Dudley had orchestrated his wife&#x27;s death.

In October Robert Dudley returned to court, many believed, &quot;in great hope to marry the Queen&quot;. Elizabeth&#x27;s affection and favour towards him was undiminished, and, importuned by unsolicited advice against a marriage with Lord Robert, she declared the inquest had shown &quot;the matter … to be contrary to which was reported&quot; and to &quot;neither touch his honesty nor her honour.&quot;

However, her international reputation and even her position at home were imperilled by the scandal, which seems to have convinced her that she could not risk a marriage with Dudley. Dudley himself had no illusions about his destroyed reputation, even when he was first notified of the jury&#x27;s decision: &quot;God&#x27;s will be done; and I wish he had made me the poorest that creepeth on the ground, so this mischance had not happened to me.&quot; In September 1561, a month after the coroner&#x27;s verdict was officially passed, the Earl of Arundel, one of Dudley&#x27;s principal enemies, studied the testimonies in the hope of finding incriminating evidence against his rival.

===John Appleyard===
John Appleyard had profited in terms of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law&#x27;s rise ever since 1559; he was nevertheless disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently on behalf of the Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £1,000 in cash. He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, in the last few years come to believe that his half-sister was murdered. He had always been convinced of Dudley&#x27;s innocence but thought it would be an easy matter to find out the real culprits. He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl&#x27;s help to this effect, claiming the jury had not yet come up with their verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a jury had found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law. Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation.

Some weeks later the Privy Council investigated the allegations about Norfolk, Sussex, and Leicester, and Appleyard found himself in the Fleet prison for about a month. Interrogated by Cecil and a panel of noblemen (among them the Earl of Arundel, but not Robert Dudley), he was commanded to answer in writing what had moved him to implicate &quot;my Lord of Norfolk, the Earl of Sussex and others to stir up matter against my Lord of Leicester for the death of his wife&quot;, and what had moved him to say that &quot;the death of the Earl of Leicester&#x27;s wife&quot; was &quot;procured by any person&quot;. Appleyard, instead of giving answers, retracted all his statements; he had also requested to see the coroner&#x27;s report and, after studying it in his cell, wrote that it fully satisfied him and had dispelled his concerns.

===Early traditions and theories===

From the early 1560s there was a tradition involving Sir Richard Verney, a gentleman-retainer of Robert Dudley from Warwickshire, in whose house Lady Amy Dudley had stayed in 1559. A 1563 chronicle, which is heavily biased against the House of Dudley and was probably written by the Protestant activist John Hales, describes the rumours:[t]he Lord Robert&#x27;s wife brake her neck at Forster&#x27;s house in Oxfordshire … her gentlewomen being gone forth to a fair. Howbeit it was thought she was slain, for Sir ----- Varney was there that day and whylest the deed was doing was going over the fair and tarried there for his man, who at length came, and he said, thou knave, why tarriest thou? He answered, should I come before I had done? Hast thou done? quoth Varney. Yeah, quoth the man, I have made it sure. … Many times before it was bruited by the Lord Robert his men that she was dead. … This Verney and divers his servants used before her death, to wish her death, which made the people to suspect the worse.

The first printed version of Amy Robsart&#x27;s alleged murder appeared in the satirical libel &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot;, a notorious propaganda work against the Earl of Leicester written by Catholic exiles in 1584. Here Sir Richard Verney goes directly to Cumnor Place, forces the servants to go to the market, and breaks Lady Amy&#x27;s neck before placing her at the foot of the stairs; the jury&#x27;s verdict is murder, and she is buried first secretly at the Cumnor parish church before being dug up and reburied at Oxford. Verney dies, communicating &quot;that all the devils in hell&quot; tore him in pieces; his servant (who was with him at the murder) having been killed in prison by Dudley&#x27;s means before he could tell the story.

Enhanced by the considerable influence of &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot;, the rumours about Amy Robsart&#x27;s death developed into a tradition of embellished folklore. As early as 1608, a domestic tragedy named &quot;A Yorkshire Tragedy&quot; alluded to her fall from a pair of stairs as an easy way to get rid of one&#x27;s wife: &quot;A politician did it.&quot; In the 19th century her story became very popular due to the best-selling novel, &quot;Kenilworth&quot;, by Walter Scott. The novel&#x27;s arch-villain is again called Varney. The notion that Amy Robsart was murdered gained new strength with the discovery of the Spanish diplomatic correspondence (and with it of poison rumours) by the Victorian historian James Anthony Froude. Generally convinced of Leicester&#x27;s wretchedness, he concluded in 1863: &quot;she was murdered by persons who hoped to profit by his elevation to the throne; and Dudley himself … used private means … to prevent the search from being pressed inconveniently far.&quot; There followed the Norfolk antiquarian Walter Rye with &quot;The Murder of Amy Robsart&quot; in 1885: here she was first poisoned and then, that method failing, killed by violent means. Rye&#x27;s main sources were Cecil&#x27;s talk with de Quadra around the time of Amy Dudley&#x27;s death and, again, &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot;. Much more scholarly and influential was an 1870 work by George Adlard, &quot;Amy Robsart and the Earl of Leycester&quot;, which printed relevant letters and covertly suggested suicide as an explanation. By 1910, A.F. Pollard was convinced that the fact that Amy Robsart&#x27;s death caused suspicion was &quot;as natural as it was incredible … But a meaner intelligence than Elizabeth&#x27;s or even Dudley&#x27;s would have perceived that murder would make the[ir] marriage impossible.&quot;

===Modern theories===
The coroner&#x27;s report came to light in The National Archives in 2008 and is compatible with an accidental fall as well as suicide or other violence. In the absence of the forensic findings of 1560, it was often assumed that a simple accident could not be the explanation—on the basis of near-contemporary tales that Amy Dudley was found at the bottom of a short flight of stairs with a broken neck, her headdress still standing undisturbed &quot;upon her head&quot;, a detail that first appeared as a satirical remark in &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot; and has ever since been repeated for a fact. To account for such oddities and evidence that she was ill, it was suggested in 1956 by Ian Aird, a professor of medicine, that Amy Dudley might have suffered from breast cancer, which through metastatic cancerous deposits in the spine, could have caused her neck to break under only limited strain, such as a short fall or even just coming down the stairs. This explanation has gained wide acceptance.

Another popular theory has been that Amy Dudley took her own life; because of illness or depression, her melancholy and &quot;desperation&quot; being traceable in some sources. As further arguments for suicide have been forwarded the fact that she insisted on sending her servants away and that her maid Picto, Thomas Blount, and perhaps Robert Dudley himself alluded to the possibility.

A few modern historians have considered murder as an option. Alison Weir has tentatively suggested William Cecil as organizer of Amy Dudley&#x27;s death on the grounds that, if Amy was mortally ill, he had the strongest murder motive and that he was the main beneficiary of the ensuing scandal. Against this idea it has been argued that he would not have risked damaging Elizabeth&#x27;s reputation nor his own position. The notion of Sir Richard Verney killing Amy Robsart after long and fruitless efforts to poison her (with and without his master&#x27;s knowledge) has been revived by George Bernard and by Chris Skidmore on the basis that Verney appears in both the c. 1563 chronicle by John Hales (also called &quot;Journal of Matters of State&quot;) and the 1584 libel &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot;. This coincidence has as often been evaluated as no more than a tradition of gossip, poison being a stock-in-trade accusation in the 16th century.

That Robert Dudley might have influenced the jury has been argued by George Bernard, Susan Doran, and by Chris Skidmore. The foreman, Sir Richard Smith (mayor of Abingdon in 1564/1565), had been a household servant of Princess Elizabeth and is described as a former &quot;Queen&#x27;s man&quot; and a &quot;lewd&quot; person in Hales&#x27; 1563 chronicle, while Dudley gave a &quot;Mr. Smith&quot;, also a &quot;Queen&#x27;s man&quot;, a present of some stuffs to make a gown from in 1566; six years after the inquest. It has, however, not been established that Sir Richard Smith and the &quot;Mr. Smith&quot; of 1566 are one and the same person, Smith being a &quot;very common&quot; name. Susan Doran has pointed out that any interference with the jury could be as easily explained by the desire to cover up a suicide rather than a murder.

Most modern historians have exonerated Robert Dudley from murder or a cover-up. Apart from alternatives for a murder plot as causes for Amy Robsart&#x27;s death, his correspondence with Thomas Blount and William Cecil in the days following has been cited as proofs of his innocence; the letters, which show signs of an agitated mind, making clear his bewilderment and unpreparedness. It has also been judged as highly unlikely that he would have orchestrated the death of his wife in a manner which laid him open to such a foreseeable scandal.

== Family ==

Amy Robsart was the daughter of Sir John Robsart of Syderstone (d.1557) and his wife, Elizabeth Scott (d.1549), daughter of John Scott, of Camberwell in Surrey. From her mother&#x27;s first marriage to Roger Appleyard of Stanfield (d.1528) Amy had four half-siblings, John Appleyard, Philip, who married Mary Shelton and was a Member of Parliament, Anne, who married James Bigos, esquire, Frances, who married William Flowerdew, and Bridget. Through their son Anthony Flowerdew of Hethersett in Norfolk and his wife Martha Stanley of Scottow in Norfolk, Amy Robsart is the great-aunt of Temperance Flowerdew.

Amy Robsart&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Theoderick (Terry) Robsart and Elizabeth (d.20 November 1535), daughter of Sir Thomas Kerdeston of Syderstone.

Her half-brother Arthur Robsart was the illegitimate son of her father Sir John Robsart, and married Margaret, daughter of Sir Arthur Hopton.

== Memorial tile ==

Amy was buried in the chancel of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Oxford, but her grave has been lost. Professor Ian Aird wrote: &quot;The exact site of Amy’s grave has never been known, though in the contemporary account it was said to have been at the east end of the church of St. Mary the Virgin in Oxford.&quot;

A memorial tile in the church, however, pays tribute to her:

<text>Lje, or Lle (Љ љ; italics: &quot;Љ љ&quot;; also called lye) is a letter of the Cyrillic script.

Lje represents a palatal lateral , a sound similar (but not identical) to the palatalized alveolar lateral approximant /lʲ/, which is in some languages represented by the digraph ⟨ль⟩ and pronounced like the in &quot;million&quot;. Compare Latvian ⟨ļ⟩, Slovak ⟨ľ⟩, Portuguese ⟨lh⟩, Spanish ⟨ll⟩ and Italian ⟨gl⟩.

Lje is a ligature of ⟨л⟩ and ⟨ь⟩. It was invented by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić for use in his 1818 dictionary, replacing the earlier digraph ⟨ль⟩. It corresponds to the digraph in Gaj&#x27;s Latin alphabet for Serbo-Croatian.

It is today used in Macedonian, variants of Serbo-Croatian when written in Cyrillic (Bosnian, Montenegrin and Serbian), and Itelmen.

It was also once used in the Udege language, and in the Lithuanian Cyrillic alphabet.

Lje is commonly transliterated as but it can also be transliterated as , or .

<doc id="1115433" wikidata="Q204806" url="?curid=1115433" title="Benue River">
<text>Benue River (), previously known as the Chadda River or Tchadda, is a major tributary of the Niger River. The size of its catchment basin is 319,000 km2 (123,000 sq mi). Almost its entire length of approximately is navigable during the summer months. As a result, it is an important transportation route in the regions through which it flows. The name &quot;Benue&quot; comes from &quot;Binuwe,&quot; meaning &#x27;Mother of Waters’ in the Batta language.

==Geography==
The Benue rises in the Adamawa Plateau of northern Cameroon, from where it flows west, and through the town of Garoua and Lagdo Reservoir, into Nigeria south of the Mandara mountains, and through Jimeta, Ibi and Makurdi before meeting the Niger River at Lokoja.

Large tributaries are the Faro River, the Gongola River and the Mayo Kébbi, which connects it with the Logone River (part of the Lake Chad system) during floods. Other tributaries include Taraba River and River Katsina Ala.

At the point of confluence, the Benue exceeds the Niger by volume. The mean discharge before 1960 was for the Benue and for the Niger. During the following decades, the runoff of both rivers decreased markedly due to irrigation.

== Climate ==
Benue State has a tropical savanna climate. It is warm every month of the year throughout both wet and dry seasons. The annual temperature is 34°C and there is about 244 inch of rain in a year. The state has an average humidity of 61%, dew point of 25 °C, an UV-index of 7 and it is mainly dry for 169 days in a year.

== Major floods ==
Nigeria’s National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), conducted a “disaster risk management analysis” and advised Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) to take proactive steps to mitigate the impact of climate change. The agency advised that water bodies across some states be desilted and dredged regularly to make water available for various purposes. The agency urged relevant institutions to carry out routine monitoring of dams and water bodies to ensure their operation rule curve for reservoirs is adhered to.

=== 2022 Flood ===
On September 23, 2022, flooding affected all riverine local government areas of Benue, according to the state Commissioner for Water Resources and Environment, Godwin Oyiwona. The flooding affected Makurdi, Agatu, Logo, Guma, Buruku, Otukpo, and Gwer-West. The government worked to mitigate flooding effects and released funds for cleaning the Idye Basin.

In October 2022, farmers in Adamawa State struggled to clear off remnants of crops destroyed by the flooding. The disaster disrupted many communities across Nigeria’s 36 states, with hundreds of villages and urban centers submerged in water. The disaster unsettled over 2.4 million people and over 600 fatalities were recorded. Additionally, &quot;expansive hectares of farmlands across affected states were swept off.&quot;

The worst hit were mostly residents of agrarian communities near major tributaries in seven of the 21 local government areas in the state. Within three months, 12 Local Government Areas (LGAs) were submerged, affecting 82,730 residents, 13,788 households, 51 people injured, and 27 deaths. Farmlands worth billions of naira were destroyed.

==== January 2020 ====
President Muhammadu Buhari inaugurated a 3.35-km drainage channel project in Makurdi, Benue, to address ecological challenges in the Idye Community. The project, part of the 17 ecological intervention projects, was approved by the President in the fourth quarter of 2017 and completed in 48 weeks. The project aimed to address the devastating effects of erosion and flood in the region.

=== 2017 Flood ===
News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that Idye Community was among the worst-hit areas of the 2017 flood that displaced over 120,000 persons in the Benue capital, Makurdi. Floods devastated more than 200 households in Makurdi.

===2012 Flood===
The Benue River flooded in October 2012, resulting in a large increase in the population of venomous snakes in the Duguri District, Alkaleri Local Government Area, Bauchi State. A July 2013 report indicated that over 200 people in the district had died of snakebite. The General Hospital in Kaltungo, Gombe State in Nigeria, is the nearest location for treatment of snakebite; &quot;whoever is lucky to make it to Kaltungo is treated in only two days and then they return home.&quot;
==Pollution==
Benue Hike Tourism and Conservation Foundation, in an attempt to keep the river protected from various forms of pollution, informed the Benue State Government about the irregularities of some companies in the state for emptying waste in the river. Waste like ethanol, that could easily cause damage to human and aquatic life, was dumped into Benue River. Subsequently, the Benue State Government took an immediate attempt in addressing the issue to prevent further damages for its citizenry.

<text>Jim Long (born Timothy John Moynihan; February 7, 1943 – May 30, 2022) was an American entrepreneur, who worked in the broadcast music industry.

Experienced in the development of intellectual properties, his business holdings focused on music production, master recordings, music publishing, and broadcast licensing and syndication for the radio, television and film industries. He founded/co-founded numerous broadcast and radio syndication companies, including Dallas-based TM Productions/Starr Broadcasting, FirstCom/Jim Long Music, Long-Pride Broadcasting, and a Nashville-based music and publishing group, OneMusic. At various times, he also held ownership interest in 19 radio and TV stations throughout the U.S. His record label, &quot;Honest Entertainment&quot;, produced Grammy-nominated albums.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Long (who took his maternal grandfather&#x27;s name when he began his career as a radio announcer) was the only child of John Francis Moynihan and Marion Long Moynihan, whose families came to New England from County Kerry and Mallow, County Cork, Ireland in the 1800s. Always in some form of law enforcement, Long&#x27;s father retired as a United States Air Force major (provost marshal in Germany) and corrections officer for the State of Massachusetts. His mother was a registered nurse and homemaker.

Fascinated by radio since childhood, Long built his first vacuum tube radio transmitter at the age of 13 and started his own radio station in his basement in Marlborough, Massachusetts. It was a successful enterprise until the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) showed up to confiscate his transmitter. It was interfering with a local radio station&#x27;s signal. (Long later went to work for the station, WMRC, Milford, Massachusetts). At 15, he produced his first record, &quot;Liza Lee&quot; by Roger and The Markees, and started his own record company, Dell Mont Recording, to release it (also in his basement, using his savings and a $200 loan from his mother). This gave him his first taste of artist promotion, record production, and distribution, especially “returns”. After high school, Long worked at Walgreens Drug Stores, while taking courses in broadcasting, to fulfill his goal of becoming a D.J./radio announcer.

He joined the United States Navy and was stationed at Anacostia Naval Base in Washington, D.C., where he served in the elite U. S. Navy Ceremonial Guard, with duty at Arlington National Cemetery. Honorably discharged, he returned to civilian life to pursue a career in broadcasting, where he put his talents as a writer and producer to work.

===Notable firsts===

Jim Long was the first to:

* Introduce the use of CDs in the U.S. as format for music production libraries; 
* Introduce and market comprehensive multi-media image campaigns for radio stations, complete with station IDs, print and broadcast advertising, promotional materials, and market research programs. Such as, “Someplace Special”, “Rhythm of the City”, the “You” campaign; 
* Create a major special for album oriented rock station programming, “Album Greats”, a 48-hour history of album rock.;
* Successfully automate rock programming;
* Introduce a cappella and shotgun vocal formats for station IDs;
* Introduce commercial services and music production libraries for radio stations to sell their local advertisers.;
* Introduce station ID image songs – station identification jingles of more than :60 seconds that sounded like the hits songs that the stations played, in 1972–1973. Later known in the industry as the “mini-song” station ID – a widely imitated concept; and
* Introduce the “Turn on the Light” radio format in Washington, D.C.

==Radio career==
Beginning in 1961, Long worked as an announcer, producer and program manager at radio stations in Keene (WKBK), Dover (WTSN) and Manchester (WFEA), NH; Westfield (WDEW) and Southbridge (WESO), Massachusetts; Waterbury, Connecticut (WWCO); Springfield, Vermont (WCFR); Bangor, Maine (WGUY); Messina (WSTS), Malone (WICY), Utica (WRUN) and Syracuse (WOLF) New York; Orlando, Florida (WKIS); and Indianapolis (WIBC), Indiana.

In early 1967, after a year as Program Director of WIBC/Indianapolis, the 24-year-old Long was given the opportunity to move to Texas by composer Tom Merriman who was working at Dallas-based Commercial Recording Corporation (CRC). Within six months, he and Merriman would launch TM Productions, Inc. with $10,000 capital.

==Companies==

===The TM Companies (1967–1979)===
In 1967 TM Productions began as a music production company, producing commercial jingles and broadcast station identifications (IDs). Long conceptualized and co-produced an entirely new approach to station IDs which provided stations a natural flow from commercial breaks to station IDs to music programming, increasing listenership and ratings. Called “Phase 2”, “The Propellants” and “The Winning Score”, these programs were quickly adopted by top stations including KILT Houston, WCFL Chicago and KHJ Los Angeles. He also created IDs that sounded like the hit songs the stations were playing (e.g., “And the Beat Goes On” and “Charisma” for WCFL Chicago and KLIF Dallas). These concepts were extremely successful and soon widely imitated within the industry.

TM Productions was the first production-syndication company to create and market comprehensive multi-media image campaigns for radio stations, complete with station IDs, print and broadcast advertising, promotional materials, and market research programs. (“Someplace Special”, “Rhythm of the City”, “You”, “Where You Belong” and “Where Your Friends Are”) These image campaigns increased ratings at stations like WCOL Columbus, KRFC San Francisco, KHJ Los Angeles, and WIBG in Philadelphia. These award-winning campaigns could be syndicated for use in non-competing markets.

A similar format image campaign was also developed for television stations, with WLKY-TV in Lexington, Kentucky, serving as the pilot. Called ColorTheme, it incorporated animation and music for station IDs and was customized for many major market TV stations, including the MetroMedia Group, Inc.

Long also introduced commercial services libraries – full service, multi-media advertising campaigns designed for local advertisers by award-winning composers and writer-producers. For the first time, radio stations could provide high quality advertising campaigns to their advertising sponsor clients. The Producer (1973) and MasterPlan (1976) were licensed to over 2000 radio stations, worldwide, and generated millions of dollars in additional revenue for local radio broadcasters.

The scope of the business included three additional product divisions:

TM Programming, a full service radio programming firm, created and produced customized services for over 500 radio stations throughout the U.S., including market analysis, and music programming in four different musical formats: Beautiful music, stereo rock, soft rock, and country. It was the first to successfully automate mainstream rock programming (WGY-FM in Albany, New York) and the first syndicator to successfully program country music on FM radio (WSOC-FM, Charlotte, North Carolina).

TM Special Projects produced music “specials” for broadcast, including the first-ever 48-hour history of album rock, &quot;Album Greats&quot;, which was aired by hundreds of top progressive rock radio stations, upon its release in 1977.

TM International provided worldwide distribution of the products of the TM Companies.

By the early 1970s, the TM Companies had become internationally recognized as the radio industry&#x27;s leading provider of music libraries and programming. When Long left to found FirstCom in 1980, he had accumulated industry and broadcast awards, including nine Clio awards. He had built the largest and most successful broadcast syndicator of its kind in the world.

===Starr Broadcasting and William F. Buckley (1973–1979)===
The success of the TM Companies brought suitors and, on October 15, 1973, Long and Tom Merriman sold TM to Starr Broadcasting Group, a broadcast oriented, publicly held corporation whose primary shareholder and chairman of the board was William F. Buckley. Long and Merriman (who both became multi-millionaires in the deal) continued in their roles with TM, but sought to buy back the company in 1976 when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation into Buckley&#x27;s business affairs, accusing him and several members of the Starr Broadcasting board of directors of fraud and misuse of shareholder&#x27;s funds.

On July 17, 1979, Starr Broadcasting Group, along with its 13 radio and television stations and the TM Companies, was merged with Shamrock Broadcasting Corporation, a privately held Los Angeles company controlled by the Roy E. Disney family.

===FirstCom Broadcast Services (1980–1995), a division of Jim Long Companies, Inc.===
Long founded FirstCom in 1980 to provide broadcasters with a new level of promotion, music production services, and high-end creative ideas, using emerging technologies. He called his new commercial services library “The Creative Department” and was considered a pioneer in his use of market research to develop audience share and increase profitability – resulting in a series of syndicated promotions, sales training programs (Sales Performance System), and high quality music production libraries, unsurpassed in the industry, at that time.

In 1984, Long introduced the first ever compact disc (CD) production music library, Digital Production Library. This production format soon became the industry standard (instead of vinyl). By this time, FirstCom had become one of the largest stock music library companies worldwide. Long had reinvented the company to look beyond radio at the broader arena of domestic and international copyrights/music publishing, exploring audio-visual and digital technologies not yet widely used by business. He also expanded FirstCom&#x27;s marketing to include sales to television and film music clients, a concept he later expanded upon when he created OneMusic and Crucial Music Corporations.

In 1992 FirstCom was the first company to put their entire music catalog online and to offer an online music delivery system, called MusiQuick so that clients had immediate access to their production tools on the internet.

Long sold FirstCom and the Jim Long Companies, Inc. in 1990 to Clive Calder’s Zomba Enterprises/Jive Records of London. He continued as chairman and on-going consultant until 1995. FirstCom is now owned by Universal Music Group.

===Long-Pride Broadcasting Group, Inc. (1980–1987)===
In 1980, Long formed Long-Pride Broadcasting with friend and business associate, country singer Charley Pride. They shared ownership in several real estate ventures, a Texas bank, and oil and gas leases and acquired radio stations KQAM/KEYN in Wichita, Kansas, and KAYC/KAYD in Beaumont, Texas. The company was dissolved in 1987 after the sale of its radio stations.

===OneMusic Corporation (1990–2005)===
In 1990, Long founded OneMusic in Del Mar, California, and created yet another innovative music library, increasingly used in radio, television (e.g., &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;), and film production (e.g., the Oscar-winning &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;). And, LiquidTracks, a new concept in music production services, allowed clients to actually remix music to their own specifications. Long sold 50% of the OMC Library to Clive Calder&#x27;s Zomba/FirstCom, which was purchased by BMG in 2002. In 2005 BMG purchased the remainder of the OMC Library from Long.

Divisions of OneMusic, but not part of the sale to BMG, included Honest Entertainment Group, Inc. and The Gold Label.

====Honest Entertainment Group, Inc. (1992–2001)/The Gold Label (1999–2001)====
Having already produced artists for the Capitol, MCA, and Atlantic labels, Long started his own record label in California in 1992, Honest Entertainment, as a vehicle for re-launching Charley Pride’s career. He produced three albums for Pride (&quot;Pride&quot;, &quot;My 6 Latest &amp; 6 Greatest&quot;, &quot;Platinum Pride, Volumes 1 &amp; 2&quot;, and &quot;Classics with Pride&quot;) which provided impetus for the Country Music Association Awards (CMA) to recognize Pride with their Pioneer Award and other accolades. As part of his marketing strategy, Long created the first direct response marketing (DR) campaign for a major artist that used 800# marketing to drive new retail sales, selling over 500,000 units through the combination of DR and retail. Honest developed similar campaigns for other artists, including country superstar, Alan Jackson.

Honest Entertainment opened offices in Nashville in 1994 and became known for its niche marketing of Irish artists, including Foster &amp; Allen, Daniel O’Donnell, and Ronan Hardiman, the composer for Michael Flatley’s &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; extravaganza. Honest also had its own roster of singer/songwriters, including Kate Wallace for whom Long produced the first “CD Plus” for a new artist marketing campaign, providing biographical audio as well as music video and behind the scenes footage (a new technology format, now familiar on DVD). It was at this time that he pioneered the use of the (almost unheard of then) Internet chat rooms for music listening tests, focus groups and market research.

Honest also featured a group of legendary older artists, including Jack Jones, for whom Long produced two albums, one of which received a Grammy nomination in 1998, &quot;Jack Jones Paints a Tribute to Tony Bennett&quot; (Bennett actually won the Grammy that year for his own CD.)(www.digitalhit.com/grammy) This group of older artists became a separate company, The Gold Label, in 1999 and was sold to Pat Boone in 2001.

====Crucial Music Corporation (2007–2022)====
Launched in 2006, Crucial Music Corporation (CMC) is one of the first 100% online companies to use the Internet to link independent artists and musicians to those in the music industry who want their songs. CMC licenses music to radio, television, and film. A former OneMusic-Honest Entertainment executive, Tanvi Patel, serves as CEO and partner,(www.crucialmusic.com) while Long serves as chairman. CMC is headquartered in Suite 2 of 12031 Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, Los Angeles. Many bands and singers have licensed their music to movies through CMC, including Owen Chaim, Ronjii, Michael Kisur, The John D&#x27;Agostino Band, Curtis Marolt, Erin Reign, Attila, Ron Esposito, Thomas David Grant, Ellery, Shock of Pleasure, Christopher Welch, Kate Booye, Jon Estep, Juvon Taylor, Andy Bianco and Christopher Jon Winston. In January 2016, CMC launched Crucial Custom, a division that links composers to advertising agencies and licenses music to advertisement.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2019 Long was inducted into the Production Music Association’s Hall of Fame, and posthumously received the first Lifetime Achievement Award, presented by the music connection organization, TAXI, in 2022.

Building on Long’s passion and dedication to foster the next generation of creators and business leaders, in January, 2025 the Grammy Museum Foundation dedicates a permanent gallery to Long to honor his legacy of mentorship in the music industry.  The GMF Sonic Playground and Career Wall provides a guided, interactive opportunity for young and old, alike, to learn about careers in music.  It offers experiential learning by music industry mentors for anyone seeking career options in music, including advertising, broadcasting, digital, media, and film.

<text>Molly Miriam Esther Holzschlag (January 25, 1963 – September 5, 2023) was an American author, lecturer and advocate of the Open Web. She wrote or co-authored 35 books on web design and open standards, including &quot;The Zen of CSS Design: Visual Enlightenment for the Web&quot; (co-authored with Dave Shea). She was nicknamed the &quot;Fairy Godmother of the Web&quot;.

==Campaigning for web standards==
Holzschlag conceived and led the first five years of Open Web Camp, a free event in Silicon Valley from 2009 to 2013. Her work focused on Open Web technologies, web design, and accessibility. She was the 2004–2006 group lead for the Web Standards Project (WaSP), a coalition that campaigned browser makers such as Microsoft, Opera, and Netscape to support modern web standards. Her obituary in the &quot;Tucson Sentinel&quot; reported that &quot;more than once, she challenged Bill Gates face-to-face to fix problems with Internet Explorer&quot;.

She participated as a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) invited expert on the CSS Working Group, chaired the CSS Accessibility Community Group, and was an invited expert on the HTML and GEO working groups.

==Teaching work==
In 2011, Holzschlag worked for Knowbility, teaching classes on Open Web technologies such as HTML5 and ARIA, with a strong emphasis on using inclusive design to overcome accessibility barriers. She also taught webmaster courses for the University of Arizona, University of Georgia, University of Phoenix, New School University, and Pima Community College.

==Writing==
Holzschlag wrote or co-authored 35 books on web design and open standards, including &quot;The Zen of CSS Design: Visual Enlightenment for the Web&quot; (co-authored with Dave Shea). She also reported on music for the &quot;Tucson Weekly&quot; in the 1990s.

==Personal life==
Holzschlag was born on January 25, 1963 in Brooklyn. She was diagnosed with aplastic anemia in 2014. She had spoken about the problems with health care funding and raised over $70,000 through GoFundMe in 2013 to fund her chemotherapy. Holzschlag was found dead at home in Tucson, Arizona on September 5, 2023, at age 60.

<doc id="1115443" wikidata="Q3378085" url="?curid=1115443" title="Phantom Brave">
<text>is a tactical role-playing game for the PlayStation 2 video game console, developed and published by Nippon Ichi Software. It was released on January 22, 2004 in Japan, on August 31, 2004 in North America and on February 4, 2005 in Europe. The North American release was the first game published by NIS America. The game shipped in two &quot;editions&quot;, Normal and Special. The Special edition came with a free soundtrack and shortened instruction manual.

An expanded remake for the Wii console, titled Phantom Brave: We Meet Again, was released on March 12, 2009 in Japan. A North American release by NIS America was originally set for June, but was delayed to August 14 to include dual audio and as a result of manufacturing issues. In addition to the Wii game disc, NIS America included a DVD which contains official artwork and both animated and non-animated sprites.

The game was ported to the PlayStation Portable with added features under the title Phantom Brave: The Hermuda Triangle. &quot;Siliconera&quot; teased gamers with a &quot;puzzlehunt&quot;, giving them the quote &quot;Maybe that means thank you?&quot; This puzzlehunt eventually came to be the announcement that &quot;Phantom Brave: The Hermuda Triangle&quot; was set for release in North America and Europe. While US players got both PSN and UMD versions of the game, players in Europe were only offered the downloadable PSN version.

The game was ported to Steam on July 25, 2016. The PC version has all of the added content in both &quot;The Hermuda Triangle&quot; and &quot;We Meet Again&quot;. It was also released on August 31, 2021 on Nintendo Switch and PC as part of the &quot;Prinny Presents NIS Classics Volume 1&quot; compilation. A sequel, titled &quot;Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero&quot;, was released on January 30, 2025. A remaster of &quot;The Hermuda Triangle&quot; for PlayStation 5 was released on November 7th, 2024.

==Plot==

The protagonist of &quot;Phantom Brave&quot; is a 13-year-old girl named Marona. Marona lives on Phantom Isle in the oceanic world of Ivoire with a phantom named Ash. While he was still alive, Ash worked alongside Marona&#x27;s parents Jasmine and Haze as a Chroma, a sort of bounty hunter or adventurer for hire. On an assignment on the Isle of Evil, a fragment of a malevolent being known as Sulphur attacked the group, mortally wounding them. Using the last of his life energy, Haze attempted to revive the party after the battle. However, there was only enough life left in him to bring Ash back as a phantom. Haze and Jasmine&#x27;s dying wish was for Ash to watch over their then infant daughter Marona.

Marona is the only one able to see Ash in phantom form. This is primarily because of her unique ability, Chartreuse Gale. This ability not only allows her to see and interact with phantoms, but bind their souls to various objects to grant them a temporary body, using the skill &quot;Confine&quot;. Using this power she can summon Ash and other phantoms to the world of the living to aid her in her own endeavors as a Chroma, similar to the work done by her late parents. Because she possesses the ability to see and speak with the dead, many assume that she is either controlled by or cooperates with evil spirits, and are afraid to even interact with her, much less employ her for Chroma work. In the early portions of the story, people who offer Marona employment would rescind any rewards upon completion once they discover that she was a phantom-possessed Chroma.

As she continues her Chroma work, Marona&#x27;s path crosses with that of a man named Walnut. Walnut prides himself on his status as a Chroma Oxide, one who secretly follows a Chroma on their mission and steals the reward for their work. Walnut regularly tries to meddle in Chroma-related matters involving Marona, but is rarely successful. As they continue their work, Ash and Marona also meet a sickly young girl named Castille. Confined to her bed or wheelchair for most of her life, Castille has been unable to go out into the world and make friends. However, after helping Castille&#x27;s family on an assignment, Marona and Castille become friends. Marona leaves Putty (a mischievous nature spirit found on an assignment) with Castille to keep her company when Marona is unable to do so.

Signs of Sulphur returning to Ivoire in full force become more apparent. Earthquakes increase in frequency and monsters plague the land, with lesser forms of Sulphur known as Wraiths appearing to attack Ash and Marona. Marona and Walnut are forced to team up, and it is revealed that Walnut is Castile&#x27;s older brother who has been stealing money from Chromas in an effort to pay Castile&#x27;s hospital bills so that she can be cured of the sickness that keeps her bedridden. Ash and Marona meet more people who are aware of the signs signalling Sulpher&#x27;s return and are making preparations to meet Sulpher in battle, if necessary. Among these individuals are Raphael, a renowned knight from a legion known as the Nine Swords of Ivoire, and Sprout, a renegade soldier whose family was killed by Sulphur many years earlier. While Sprout seems to side with Ash in this fight, he is hellbent on the destruction of Sulphur at all costs.

As preparations for the final battle are made, Ash and Marona return to the Isle of Evil and find Raphael is possessed by Sulphur. Marona&#x27;s team of phantoms is forced to engage Raphael in a duel. After Raphael is too injured to continue and comes back to his senses, he entrusts Ash with Heliotrope, his sacred sword, for use in their battle against Sulphur. At the center of the island lies a portal from which Sulphur is entering the world, and upon the heroes&#x27; arrival they expect to engage in combat with Sulphur. However, they are intercepted by Sprout. Having gone mad from the dark power that he has stolen from the minions of Sulphur that he killed and by Sulphur&#x27;s increased influence in the area, Sprout attacks Ash and Marona. When he loses to Ash he kills himself with his sword, Shiva, in an attempt to stop Sulphur within him, but Sulphur materializes anyway.

Ash and Marona battle it out with Sulphur, but in spite of their best efforts, Sulphur is merely weakened and is still attempting to enter into Ivoire. Walnut appears and sacrifices his own life to sever the portal between Ivoire and Sulphur&#x27;s domain.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Phantom Brave&quot; is a tactical role-playing game with battles that take place on an isometric board. Marona dispatches her phantom allies by confining them to objects on the field, such as trees, grass, rocks, and flowers. Different objects grant different stat bonuses to the characters that are confined to them, making it advantageous to confine certain characters to certain things. A soldier, for example, often benefits from the stat bonuses found on a rock because of his physical combat abilities, whereas a witch works better when summoned out of a flower or another object that increases its magical abilities. Up to 14 phantoms can be dispatched during any given battle, but the phantoms can only be confined to the physical world for a particular number of turns. The number of turns that a character can stay confined is based upon their class. For example, a witch can stay on the field for three turns, while a soldier lasts eight. While a high confine is desirable for continuous use of the character, a low confine number is actually advantageous if the player intends to either reuse the item to confine another phantom or take items back from the battlefield permanently, or for &quot;bomber&quot; units. Depending on their class, each phantom has a certain chance of acquiring the item he is confined to, bringing it back to Phantom Isle when the battle is won.
&quot;Phantom Brave&quot; has a gridless system in which each character can move a certain number of dm in each turn. The terrain also has traction and pliability characteristics, which affect how long characters continue to slide along after they stop moving and how high they bounce when the character jumps down from a ledge. On slippery surfaces, it is possible to make the characters &quot;ice skate&quot; by moving very short distances (consuming few dm) and letting them slide to their destination. In addition, the hold and throw system inherited from &quot;&quot; allows characters to pick up and throw objects and even other characters (including allies) toward a desired location.

Unlike most tactical role-playing games, the border of the battle maps do not have barriers around their edges. Most characters and objects can be thrown off, hit off, fall off, or slip off of the field of battle and sent O.B. (out-of-bounds). Characters and objects that are O.B.&#x27;d are gone for the rest of the battle. When an enemy is O.B&#x27;d, the level of each of the remaining enemies rises by one, so the player can trade a large force of weak enemies for a smaller number of stronger ones. If the enemy&#x27;s HP is reduced to zero before it is thrown out of the stage, its allies will not be granted a level up. The last enemy on the map cannot be thrown O.B., and Marona&#x27;s team members do not gain levels for falling out of bounds.

All characters and weapons accumulate &quot;mana&quot; (a magical currency for increasing a character or weapon&#x27;s abilities) whenever they kill an enemy. This mana can be spent to fuse two characters together, an item into a character, or an item to an item. Fusion increases the level cap of the beneficiary by the level of the consumed item or character. By spending mana, the player can improve equipment percentages (stat bonuses given to characters who equip the item or character) and confine percentages (bonuses to characters confined in the item on the field), and even transfer skills to the beneficiary. In &quot;Phantom Brave&quot;, weapons have a much greater effect on a character&#x27;s stats than their natural affinity. The maximum obtainable character level is 9999.

While on Phantom Isle, a character class called Dungeon Monk can be asked to create a random dungeon. Some characteristics of the dungeon can be seen before creation, including the type and general number of enemies present, the floor conditions, and if the use of equipped weapons is restricted or not. Dungeons also have titles, which are applied to every enemy in the dungeon. As the floors of the dungeon are cleared, the title of the dungeon will improve. These titles can later be removed and placed on player characters or weapons to alter their stats. Random dungeons can also be retitled. A popular leveling trick is to give a random dungeon the &quot;failure&quot; title, allowing the player to beat hordes of high level enemies easily. Random dungeons tend to take the form of a linear series of floors, although occasionally a floor may have a special named layout (&quot;for example, &quot;Self-Styled God&quot; floors have a stronger enemy in the center of a terraced layout&quot;). These floors occur randomly and confer an extra bonus upon completion. Unlike in Disgaea, where to descend to the next floor one may merely move a character to a certain panel, in Phantom Brave one must defeat all the enemies present to continue. To leave a random dungeon, one must either clear every floor, or use a Dungeon Monk&#x27;s Return skill, which costs money proportional to the current depth.

While between battles, Marona can return to her home; Phantom Island, where she can summon (create) new phantoms to aid her in future battles. The player starts off by being able to create characters from a limited selection of classes, but each class of enemy that is defeated in battle is added to the selection of phantoms the player may summon. Summoning phantoms requires only a nominal fee, but new phantoms always join at level 1 no matter when they are summoned. Marona&#x27;s phantoms populate the island, and the player can converse with them. Many classes have a special utility on the island; Merchants sell items, Healers can recover the damage that units have sustained Fusionists can combine characters and items, Witches allow the player to reorder a character or weapon&#x27;s spells and skills, and Blacksmiths combine mana with weapons to either level them up or to awaken latent skills hidden in the weapon. Phantom Isle hides several secret items and character classes, such as the Changebook, which allows the player to switch the character they explore the map with.

&quot;Phantom Brave&quot; has a series of extra maps following the main storyline. These post-game maps offer more powerful enemies and feature cameos by some members of the cast of the Disgaea games as enemies. After defeating these characters they will join the player&#x27;s pool of playable characters as &quot;phantom doubles&quot;. While the first couple of extra maps can be completed immediately after the main story, the later extra maps are very difficult and require a large amount of time invested into the game to be spent leveling characters and fusing weapons before they can be completed.

==Characters==
*Marona
The main protagonist of the game. Marona is a 13-year-old girl who has the ability to see and communicate with phantoms, a set of abilities collectively known in-game as &quot;Chartreuse&quot;. This power enables her to make a living as a Chroma, a kind of adventurer-for-hire, despite being at such a young age, but it also makes her feared and shunned by other people, many thinking that she is possessed. She lost her parents when she was five, but Ash, a friend of her parents and a former Chroma-turned-phantom, came back to protect Marona after the demise of her parents and himself.

*Ash
Ash is the phantom of a young man who protects Marona. When he was alive he worked alongside Marona&#x27;s parents as a Chroma. After dying along with them, he found himself stuck between life and death, thanks to the efforts of Marona&#x27;s father. He has since sworn to watch over and protect Marona, feeling that he owes Marona&#x27;s parents for being the only one to &quot;survive&quot; their unfortunate demise. He is usually careful and well-intentioned, if overprotective of Marona, but is sometimes known to frighten the unwary when he accidentally speaks aloud while concealed in his phantom form. He frequently objects to Marona&#x27;s selfless behavior.

*Bijou
A werewolf who impersonates Raphael of the White Wolf Army in order to steal from people who have heard of Raphael&#x27;s renowned fighting prowess. He later returns in the Sand region under the influence of Sulphur, which fuels his impersonation into a belief that he really is Raphael. After he is defeated again, he is shown to be a member of the Raven clan, the Fighting Beasts, under Captain Drab. Bijou, along with many other characters that show up in the original game&#x27;s story, is a playable unit in the Wii and PSP exclusive side story &quot;Another Marona&quot;.

*Walnut
A Chroma Oxide, a person that makes a living by waiting for a Chroma to near the completion of their assigned job and then takes proof of the work&#x27;s completion in order to steal the reward. Willing to do anything and step on anyone to achieve his goals, Walnut is the older brother of Marona&#x27;s newfound friend Castile, and puts aside his Chroma Oxide earnings to pay for an operation for her. Walnut&#x27;s power, &quot;Psycho Burgundy&quot;, is the same power utilized by the legendary hero Scarlet the Brave, and is fueled by burning the wielder&#x27;s soul to create a powerful energy. An alternate universe version of Walnut joins Marona and company as a playable character in &quot;Another Marona&quot;, a side story that is exclusive to the Wii and PSP versions of the game. Walnut also makes an appearance in another NIS game, Soul Nomad.

*Castile
Castile is a young wheelchair-bound girl, whose family was rich before spending most of their fortune on her treatments. She is kidnapped by minions of Sulphur, but rescued by Marona and Ash. Castile learns about Marona&#x27;s ability to see phantoms, and meets with Ash, and she and Marona become best friends as the events of the story unfold. According to an after-game bonus map in the PS2 game &quot;Makai Kingdom: Chronicles of the Sacred Tome&quot;, Castile eventually recovers from the sickness that keeps her in bed and becomes healthy enough to fight alongside Marona, while searching for signs that her brother Walnut may still be alive.

*Sienna
Sienna is a beautiful and elegant businesswoman who owns Phantom Isle, Marona&#x27;s home. She is generous and polite to a fault, but her calm demeanor holds a few secrets. Even her assistant, Murasaki, is clueless as to Sienna&#x27;s true motivations, or what it is about Phantom Isle that makes it so important to her. Besides Phantom Isle, Sienna owns an immense Bottle Mail factory. It is later revealed that she was the legendary hero Scarlet the Brave before she was severely wounded in her battle with Sulphur, and that she gave up being a famed warrior to live a calm life of relative obscurity.

*Sprout
A fierce and powerful 85-year-old man whose family was slain by Sulphur&#x27;s hand 30 years ago. Once the famed wielder of a holy sword, he has sworn to kill Sulphur and avenge his family, turning to the use of dark powers in order to achieve his revenge. He is the former mentor of Raphael, and one of the warriors known as the 9 Swords of Ivoire. His signature technique is the power &quot;Dark Eboreus&quot;. An alternate version of Sprout joins the player&#x27;s party in &quot;Another Marona&quot;.

*Raphael
Leader of the White Wolf Army; a group of Ravens (&quot;a large team of professional demon slayers&quot;), Raphael is one of the warriors known as the 9 Swords of Ivoire. He is first seen in the quest to find the rainbow bird. His signature technique is called &quot;Heliotrope Blade&quot;. An alternate version of Raphael fights by Marona&#x27;s side in the Wii and PSP exclusive side story, &quot;Another Marona&quot;.

*Count Malt
A dignified old Scrabbit with a mustache that sends Marona on a search for Scarlet the Brave.

*Sulphur
The story&#x27;s main antagonist and a powerful demon that periodically threatens the world of Ivoire.
The very thought of his return causes chaos and widespread panic across all of Ivoire. His power possesses a number of characters throughout the game. After his defeat, Sulphur returns to Ivoire in a bonus battle on the Island of Evil. Another optional battle in the PS2 game &quot;Soul Nomad &amp; the World Eaters&quot; reveals both how Sulfur came back to Ivoire and Walnut&#x27;s fate after Phantom Brave&#x27;s final battle.

===&quot;Another Marona&quot; characters===
These characters were originally introduced in Phantom Brave: We Meet Again for the Nintendo Wii (and its PSP port, &quot;Phantom Brave: The Hermuda Triangle&quot;), in the new campaign &quot;Another Marona&quot;.

*Carona
The Marona of an alternate reality, she shares the same phantom-related Chartreuse powers that the original Marona has. In order to avoid confusion amongst the people of this reality&#x27;s world she goes by the name &#x27;Carona&#x27; instead. Whereas Marona is both carefree and optimistic, Carona is usually serious and pessimistic, although she does show a twisted sense of humor. Her goals and intent are both unknown, and she mostly keeps to herself when she&#x27;s not training Marona and company for their upcoming battle with Sulpher. Carona appears in Ivoire just after a mysterious veil of darkness claimed the lives of all of the peoples of Ivoire, save Marona.

*God Eringa
A powerful character that appears alongside Carona, this bearded mushroom creature claims to be God. He entices Marona and company to work in his interest under the proposal that if they can defeat Sulfer within a certain number of days, he will revive all of the people who were felled by the darkness that swallowed Ivoire. During the final battle of &quot;Another Marona&quot; it is revealed that he is actually the fabled &quot;Merchant of Death&quot;, and was responsible for the spreading darkness that killed everyone.

===Other characters===
Four characters that originate from the &quot;Disgaea&quot; series (Laharl, Etna, Flonne, and Vyers) become playable characters upon completing certain post-game content. Myao, one of Marjoly&#x27;s henchwomen from the &quot;Marl Kingdom&quot; series game &quot;&quot;, also makes a playable cameo.

==Reception==

The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; on all platforms except the PSP version, which received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave the Wii version a favorable review, nearly two months before its U.S. release date. &quot;Edge&quot; gave the original game a score of seven out of ten, saying, &quot;Nippon Ichi&#x27;s disregard for the cult of stagnated updates is at once exhilarating and unnerving. It&#x27;s exhilarating because it leaves the player wondering exactly where these craftsmen of the strategy minutiae will go next, and it&#x27;s unnerving because &quot;Phantom Brave&quot;″s reworking is a bridge too far for all but the most dedicated of videogame strategists.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 33 out of 40 for the original game, and 32 out of 40 for the PSP version.

Michael Lafferty of &quot;GameZone&quot; gave the original game a score of 7.8 out of 10, calling it &quot;A mixed bag that goes from simple (and a tad frustrating) to thoughtfully compelling in the combat.&quot; Later, however, Michael Knutson gave the Wii version 7.9 out of 10, calling it &quot;a very interesting game that players will love to get their hands on. This game offers numerous hours of playtime and is one of the most &#x27;hardcore&#x27; games on the Nintendo Wii. Even though this game has a few pitfalls, overall players will enjoy the experience it offers.&quot;

<text>Psi (Ѱ, ѱ; italics: &quot;Ѱ ѱ&quot;) is a letter in the early Cyrillic alphabet, derived from the Greek letter of the same name (Ψ, ψ). It represents the sound /ps/, as in English &quot;naps&quot;. According to the school rules developed in the 16th and the 17th centuries, such as Meletius Smotrytsky&#x27;s grammar book, it was intended for use in words of Greek origin, but it was occasionally used for writing native words as well like Ukrainian (&quot;psy&quot;, &quot;dogs&quot;). It was used especially in words relating to the Eastern Orthodox Church, as can be seen in its continuing use in Church Slavonic.

Psi was eliminated from the Russian orthography, along with ksi, omega, and the yuses, in the Civil Script of 1708 (Peter the Great&#x27;s &quot;Grazhdansky Shrift&quot;), and it has also been dropped from other secular languages. It continues to be used in Church Slavonic.

<text>The Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions, usually referred to by the acronym SAK (; ) is the largest trade union confederation in Finland. Its member organisations have a total of more than one million members, which makes up about one fifth of the country&#x27;s population.
==History==
The other two Finnish trade unions confederations are the Finnish Confederation of Professionals (STTK) and the Confederation of Unions for Professional and Managerial Staff in Finland (AKAVA). The most important negotiating partner of the SAK is the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK, &quot;Elinkeinoelämän keskusliitto/Finlands Näringsliv&quot;) which represents the majority of Finnish employers.

The current SAK was founded in 1969 as the Finnish Federation of Trade Unions (SAK 1930–1969), controlled by SKDL and TPSL, and the Finnish Trade Union Federation (SAJ 1960–1969), controlled by the SDP, settled their disputes and merged into one. The SAK considers itself the continuation of the first Finnish central organisation, the Finnish Trade Union Federation (SAJ 1907–1930).

The SAK is generally supportive of the Social Democratic Party, and has spent money on advertisements backing the party. In 2007, advertisements it placed on behalf of the SDP were found to be defamitory, leading the SAK to withdraw them.

<doc id="1115450" wikidata="Q773752" url="?curid=1115450" title="Old South Meeting House">
<text>The Old South Meeting House is a historic Congregational church building located at the corner of Milk and Washington Streets in the Downtown Crossing area of Boston, Massachusetts, built in 1729. It gained fame as the organizing point for the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773. Five thousand or more colonists gathered at the Meeting House, the largest building in Boston at the time.

==History==

===Church (1729–1872)===
The meeting house or church was completed in 1729, with its 56m (183ft) steeple. The congregation was gathered in 1669 when it broke off from First Church of Boston, a Congregational church founded by John Winthrop in 1630. The site was a gift of Mrs. Norton, widow of John Norton, pastor of the First Church in Boston. The church&#x27;s first pastor was Rev. Thomas Thacher, a native of Salisbury, England. Thacher was also a physician and is known for publishing the first medical pamphlet in Massachusetts.

After the Boston Massacre in 1770, yearly anniversary meetings were held at the church until 1775, featuring speakers such as John Hancock and Dr. Joseph Warren. In 1773, 5,000 people met in the Meeting House to debate British taxation and, after the meeting, a group raided three tea ships anchored nearby in what became known as the Boston Tea Party.
In October 1775, led by Lt Col Samuel Birch of the 17th Dragoons, the British occupied the Meeting House due to its association with the Revolutionary cause. They gutted the building, filled it with dirt, and then used the interior to practice horse riding. They destroyed much of the interior and stole various items, including William Bradford&#x27;s Of Plymouth Plantation (1620), a unique Pilgrim manuscript hidden in Old South&#x27;s tower. After the British evacuated Boston, the plan for rebuilding the interior of the church was drawn by Thomas Dawes.

Old South Meeting House was almost destroyed in the Great Boston Fire of 1872. As the fire approached the historic structure, Boston firefighting crews, understanding the importance of the building to the history of Boston and the nation, staged a massive effort to protect it. Aided by the arrival of fire companies from across New England, the firefighters took heroic measures to extinguish the flames after a twelve-hour battle, saving Old South and stopping the fire before it reached other historic buildings and residential neighborhoods. As the city rebuilt, the congregation sought out a quieter neighborhood, away from the bustling commercial area near OSMH. The congregation built a new church building (the &quot;New&quot; Old South Church in the Back Bay, at Copley Square), which remains its home to this day. In 1877, a group of twenty women, including the philanthropist Mary Hemenway (who used $100,000 of her own funds) and Mary Tyler (allegedly the inspiration for the poem &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;), raised money and helped pass legislation to preserve and save the Meeting House. By 1910, preservation work was transferred to the Old South Association through aid from the Mary Hemenway Foundation. The Old South congregation returns to Old South Meeting House for services in its ancestral home once a year, on the Sunday before Thanksgiving.

===Museum (1877–present)===
Old South Meeting House has been an important gathering place for nearly three centuries. Renowned for the protest meetings held here before the American Revolution when the building was termed a &quot;mouth-house,&quot; this National Historic Landmark has long served as a platform for the free expression of ideas. Today, the Old South Meeting House is open daily as a museum and continues to provide a place for people to meet, discuss and act on important issues of the day. The stories of the men and women who are part of Old South&#x27;s vital heritage reveal why the Old South Meeting House occupies an enduring place in the history of the United States.

The museum and historic site is located at the intersection of Washington and Milk Streets and can be visited for a nominal sum. It is located near the State Street, Downtown Crossing and Park Street MBTA (subway) stations.

The Old South Meeting House is claimed to be the second oldest establishment existent in the United States. It is currently under consideration for local landmark status by the Boston Landmarks Commission.

In 2020 the former caretaker of Old South Meeting House (the Old South Association in Boston) merged with the Bostonian Society, forming Revolutionary Spaces, which now manages both Old South Meeting House and the Old State House.

<text>Boy&#x27;s Life is a 1991 novel by &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling author Robert R. McCammon. It received the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 1992.

The story is set in the early 1960s and makes observations about changes in America at that time, with particular emphasis on the Civil Rights Movement. Several of the characters are connected to the Ku Klux Klan, and the segregation of the black community is dealt with in some detail.

==Synopsis==
The book deals with 12-year-old Cory Mackenson, who grows up in the town of Zephyr, Alabama. The story begins as Cory&#x27;s father, Tom, takes Cory on his daily milk route one morning, and while driving by Saxon&#x27;s Lake (an old quarry filled with water) he watches a car drive straight into the lake and sink to the bottom with a dead man inside, beaten viciously, and his only identification is a tattoo of a skull with wings sprouting from the head. Tom jumps in and tries to save the driver of the car, only to discover that the man is actually a murder victim, handcuffed to the steering wheel. He cannot save him, and the car plummets three hundred feet down to the bottom of the lake. This vision, and the realization that there is evil in the small town of Zephyr, is enough to haunt Cory&#x27;s father. Throughout the novel Cory&#x27;s father is haunted by this image in his dreams. Cory is a writer and throughout the book he writes many stories, and goes on many adventures in his hometown including helping a young boy through a flood, facing the town beast, spending a horrid week with his grandfather, exposing two KKK members, thwarting a racist plot, letting loose an abused rhinoceros, and witnessing a gunfight against the town mob. He also tries to find out who killed the man at Saxon&#x27;s Lake. In the end it is a German Nazi, an escaped war criminal, who posed as the town veterinarian and had recently took care of Cory&#x27;s dog Rebel, who eventually died. Dr. Lezander, a.k.a. Gunther Dehninaderke, was a former Nazi officer in charge of physical examinations at a concentration camp in Germany. After revealing his true identity to Cory, he kidnaps Cory and tries to leave town, only to drive off of Route Ten into Saxon&#x27;s Lake, where he does save Cory&#x27;s life and sacrifices his own. He drowns, sinking to the bottom near where the man he murdered did. In the epilogue, 27 or so years later, Cory, who has since become a big city writer, married a woman named Sandy, and also had a tomboy of a daughter named Skye, comes back to what is left of Zephyr, which shows many characters have left or died. He finds most of his hometown in shambles, but then finds the town mansion has become an orphanage for boys, and some of the town&#x27;s members have moved in to help the young boys. The book ends when Cory goes in to see them all again.

==Characters==
Cory Mackenson— A 12-year-old boy who loves to write, making his stories on paper show life the way it is. The truth, as he says. He believes in juvenile magics, the moments you cherish as an adult and wish you could have back. His troubles begin when he witnesses a murder, the only clue being a green feather he finds at the scene, and a person he sees in the shadows. Throughout the book, he struggles with death, bullies, and everything in between.

Tom Mackenson— Cory&#x27;s father, a quiet and kind-hearted man, who loses his job as a milkman and has to work at a super market. His one desire in life is peace from his nightmares and thoughts, from which he can&#x27;t escape after witnessing a murder, seemingly an unsolvable one. He learns to find his peace at Cory&#x27;s suggestion.

Davy Ray Callan— Cory&#x27;s hot-headed, sarcastic friend who dies towards the end of the story by shooting himself accidentally. The explanation he gives Cory is that he saw Snowdown, the local myth, which is a white stag no hunter can bag. Davy explains that when he saw Snowdown, he was so shocked he tripped and shot himself in the stomach.

Ben Sears— Cory&#x27;s chubby, somewhat slow friend, who turns out to be braver than Cory thought. Cory realizes, during a sleepover, that Ben&#x27;s father is a violent alcoholic, though Ben has never mentioned it.

Johnny Wilson— A soft-spoken, part-Native American friend of Cory&#x27;s who gets a severe concussion when fighting with the Branlin brothers, the local bullies. Cory worries about him throughout the summer, but Johnny teaches Cory a lesson when there is another confrontation with the Branlins. Johnny uses fighting skills and strength he had worked on all summer to defeat the Branlins. Cory realizes that it takes courage and hard work to earn peace.

Dr. Lezander— The local veterinarian who pretends to be a Dutch survivor of World War II. He is friendly and gives nicknames to the town&#x27;s residents at weekly church services. His outward appearance hides sinister secrets. In the final chapter, it is revealed that his real name is Gunther Dahninaderke and he is actually a former Nazi, who was the doctor of Esterwegen concentration camp in World War II.

Rebel— Cory&#x27;s dog that gets hit by a car and dies, but Cory prays him back to life. Cory slowly realizes that he has to let Rebel die so his dog can find rest.

Vernon Thaxter— The middle-aged son of the richest man in town, Vernon Thaxter refuses to wear clothes. He is crazy in some ways, yet makes predictions that are important to the solving of the murder. He is good-hearted in general, coercing even the most racist people in Zephyr to help build a dam in Bruton, the place where all the black citizens live, against a coming flood. He, like Cory, is a writer, but his writing disappointed his father, who in turn blamed Vernon for his mother&#x27;s death. Vernon&#x27;s father may or may not be dead during the story, but this is never proven.

The Lady— The Lady is the undisputed leader of Bruton, and is well respected by almost everyone in Zephyr. White people tend to fear her, including Tom Mackenson. She is very in touch with the supernatural, such as Ol&#x27; Moses, the huge creature in the river, and spirits of the dead. She gives Cory his bike, Rocket, as thanks for saving a young boy from Ol&#x27; Moses during the flood.

The Moon Man— The Lady&#x27;s mysterious husband, known to all as the Moon Man, is black but has a very pale birthmark (hinted to be vitiligo) on his face and head that give him a very unusual appearance. He is generally a soft-spoken gentleman.

Dick Moultry— Moultry is an obese, cowardly, angry, self-centered KKK member. Ironically, he is caught under a bomb that is mysteriously, &quot;mistakenly&quot; dropped in Zephyr on Christmas Eve, and which Cory attributes to the Lady&#x27;s supernatural power. The bomb does not go off, but pins Moultry in his basement. He needs the help of Mr. Lightfoot, the local fix-it man who has a prodigious ability with all machines, to get out from under it. He refuses Mr. Lightfoot&#x27;s help at first, on the grounds that Mr. Lightfoot is black. He had helped to place a bomb meant to destroy Bruton&#x27;s civil rights museum.

Mr. Hargison— The local mailman, who saves Cory and his friends during the first fight with the Branlins. He is friendly with Tom Mackenson until they discuss the matter of the KKK, which Hargison secretly belongs to. He had also assisted in setting the bomb in the mailbox in front of the museum.

The Blaylocks— A violent family of criminals, who use fear and money to stay out of jail.

The Demon— A girl in Cory&#x27;s class who disgusts the other students with her nose-picking, etc., but wins their respect at the end when she glues Leatherlungs, their tyrannical teacher, to her chair.

Mayor Swope— The mayor of Zephyr who Cory suspects of the murder. He also oversees the local short-story contest.

Judith Harper (a.k.a. Leatherlungs)— One of Cory&#x27;s teachers, who is considered to be half-crazy and a &quot;burnout&quot; by the other teachers. She bullies Cory, specifically for his trouble in math, and at one point he gets so angry that he hits her. At the end, she gets what she deserves when the Demon glues her (with very strong, homemade glue) to her chair.

Mrs. Neville— Cory&#x27;s teacher in the beginning of the book, who encourages him to enter a short-story contest. Cory resents her, simply because she is a teacher, but finds out later that she was dying of cancer at the end of the year. She passes away during the summer.

Reverend Blessett— A very right-wing Baptist preacher, who strongly opposes the Beach Boys and their music. He gives a sermon saying that their music is from the devil, is trying to make children sexually crazed, and encourages delinquents. He illustrates this point with an angry spider monkey, whom he calls Lucifer, but this backfires when Lucifer escapes and proceeds to wreak havoc on the town.

The Branlins— Two brothers, Gotha and Gordo, who bully children in the town. Eventually Johnny and Cory fight back, and win peace for the kids of Zephyr.

Nemo Curliss—A sickly, weak young boy who makes friends with Cory and the other kids. His mother forbids him from playing sports due to his illness, but he actually reveals himself to be a talented pitcher, not only nailing one of the Branlin boys with an incredible fastball, but also throwing a ball so high in the air that it appears to enter orbit.

The Glass Sisters—Two sisters, Miss Blue Glass and Miss Green Glass who teach piano lessons in Zephyr. Both own parrots, with Miss Green Glass&#x27;s parrot being able to speak German curse words due to being around Dr. Lezander. Miss Green Glass&#x27;s parrot also was the source of the mysterious green feather Cory finds at the start of the story. At the end of the story, Miss Blue Glass elopes with Owen Cathcoate.

Owen Cathcoate—An elderly man who claims to have been a gunfighter in the dying days of the wild west. He says he met Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday after the gunfight at the OK Corral as a kid, and Earp gave him the nickname &quot;The Candystick Kid&quot;. While his claims are considered to be false, he demonstrates expert gunslinging ability during a shootout at the gas station with the Blaylocks. 

Chile Willow—A young lady that Cory encounters bathing after getting lost from Zephyr. She&#x27;s incredibly sweet to Cory, and he believes himself to be in love with her. After helping Cory get back home, its revealed that Willow is in a (abusive) relationship and even has a child. Throughout the story, Cory learns to accept the fact that he and Willow weren&#x27;t meant to be.

Granddaddy Jaybird An eccentric old man who is the grandfather of Cory, and who Cory spends a week with during the summer. Jaybird is part of an underground group of gamblers, which include the Blaylocks.

<doc id="1115467" wikidata="Q323356" url="?curid=1115467" title="Rick Allen (drummer)">
<text>Richard John Cyril Allen (born 1 November 1963) is an English musician who has been the drummer of the hard rock band Def Leppard since 1978. He overcame the amputation of his left arm in January 1985 and continued to play with the band, which went on to its most commercially successful phase. He is known as &quot;The Thunder God&quot; by fans. He is ranked No. 7 on the UK website Gigwise in &quot;The Greatest Drummers of All Time&quot; list.

== Early life ==
Allen was born on 1 November 1963 in Dronfield, Derbyshire to Kathleen Moore and Geoffrey Allen, related to Kevin Wells and started playing drums at the age of nine. He performed in the bands Grad, Smokey Blue, Rampant, and the Johnny Kalendar Band. When he was 14, his mother replied on his behalf to an advertisement placed by a band called Def Leppard looking for a drummer to replace Tony Kenning (&quot;Leppard loses skins&quot; was the advertisement&#x27;s headline). He later joined the band on 1 November 1978, which was his 15th birthday. In 1979, he dropped out of school to concentrate on a career in music. He celebrated his 16th birthday with a performance at the Hammersmith Odeon, when Def Leppard opened for AC/DC.

== Car crash and recovery ==

On the afternoon of 31 December 1984, Allen was involved in a car crash with his girlfriend, Miriam Barendsen, on the A57 road in the countryside a few miles west of Sheffield. 
A car in front of theirs deliberately slowed for him to catch up, only to speed up as he tried to pass. This went on for several miles until, in frustration, he accelerated to pass, at which point he lost control of the left-hand-drive Corvette C4, which hit a dry stone wall and entered a field. His left arm was entangled in the seat belt and severed, remaining in the car while he was flung out. Doctors initially re-attached it, but it was later amputated due to an infection.

Initially Allen felt &quot;defeated&quot; but, buoyed by &quot;family, friends and hundreds of thousands of letters from all over the planet&quot;, he decided to continue playing drums with Def Leppard, and adopted a specially designed electronic drum kit. The band took a hiatus from onstage performances until 5 August 1986, (Allen&#x27;s first live performance since losing his arm) instead doing a small run of public rehearsal shows in Ireland in advance of their 16 August 1986 Monsters of Rock festival performance at Castle Donington. He has since re-adopted partially acoustic drum kits depending on the setting.

==Equipment==
Allen has used custom-manufactured cable routing by Whirlwind. He uses four electronic pedals for his left foot to play the pieces he used to play with his left arm, which from left to right trigger sounds of a closing hi-hat, bass drum, snare drum, and a tom drum. 
In 2009, Yamaha announced the addition of Allen to their artist roster. He plays Yamaha Oak Custom drums with a matching subkick. He also uses Remo drumheads (usually he has coated Ambassadors on his drums and a clear Powerstroke 3 on his bass drum), Zildjian cymbals (mostly K customs, Z Customs and A customs), an Ahead drumstick and an LP rock cowbell. He previously used Ludwig Drums, Paiste 2002, RUDE, and Sound Creation cymbals.

== Charitable works ==
Allen and his wife Lauren Monroe are the co-founders of the Raven Drum Foundation, a charity. Allen also formed the One Hand Drum Company to provide funding for the Raven Drum Foundation. The company primarily sells merchandise featuring &quot;Stick Rick&quot;, an illustrated character representing Allen.

== Personal life ==
Allen was married to Stacy Lauren Gilbert from 1991 to 2000. In 1995, he was arrested for spousal abuse and was sentenced to a work crew and ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He is married to Lauren Cuggino Monroe, who is also a musician and he has contributed to some of her albums. He is a vegan.

On the weekend of 12 March 2023, while standing in the parking valet area of the Four Seasons Hotel in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where he was staying for a performance at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood, Allen was attacked by a &quot;spring-breaker&quot; who intentionally ran toward and collided with him, knocking him to the ground. He sustained a head injury. The attacker was apprehended and charged with several crimes.

<text>Nora Cherie Killian Berry (born December 21, 1946) is an American politician who served as the North Carolina Commissioner of Labor from 2001 to 2021. A member of the Republican Party, she was the first woman to hold the office.

==Early life==
Nora Cherie Killian was born in Newton, North Carolina, on December 21, 1946, to Earl and Lena Carrigan Killian. Her father gave her the name Cherie after the French phrase &quot;mon chérie&quot; (English: my darling) which he had heard in France on his way home following his release as a prisoner-of-war of World War II. Killian graduated from Maiden High School in Maiden, North Carolina, in 1965 and then moved to Boone, North Carolina, where she worked wrapping Christmas presents at a department store and selling advertisements for, writing for, and delivering newspapers. She attended Lenoir Rhyne College, ending her studies there in 1967. She also studied at Gaston College in 1969 and Oakland Community College in 1977. She married Norman H. Berry Jr. and took his last name.

In 1985 Berry and her husband founded LGM Ltd., a company based in a former billiard hall that manufactured spark-plug wires for cars. After initial financial uncertainty, the venture became very profitable. Norman H. Berry Jr. died in 2006.

==Political career==
===State House===

Berry served in the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1993 to 2000, where she chaired the welfare reform committee and co-chaired the commerce committee.

===State Labor Commissioner===
In November 2000, she was elected state labor commissioner, the first woman to hold the post and the first Republican elected to the post. Berry was sworn in as North Carolina Commissioner of Labor on January 6, 2001. She was the only Republican on the Council of State between 2001 and 2005, and defeated Democrat Wayne Goodwin to win a second term in the 2004 statewide elections. Berry narrowly defeated Mary Fant Donnan to keep her seat in the 2008 election. Berry won a fourth four-year term in November 2012, defeating former Labor Commissioner John C. Brooks by more than 280,000 votes. Berry won a fifth four-year term in November 2016, defeating former Raleigh mayor Charles Meeker by more than 476,000 votes, her largest percentage margin of victory. On April 2, 2019, she announced at a Council of State meeting that she would not seek reelection. She endorsed Pearl Burris Floyd to succeed her.

Berry was criticized in a newspaper report on poultry plant oversight. In 2008, &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; found that at least half of contributors to Berry&#x27;s reelection campaign were the executives and managers of business inspected by the department she leads. The same report also found that while Berry&#x27;s department reduced fines for workplace safety violations as a matter of routine, &quot;Berry&#x27;s contributors have usually gotten bigger-than-average breaks.&quot;

==In popular culture==
During Berry&#x27;s first term as North Carolina Commissioner of Labor, her spokesman suggested that she include a portrait of herself on inspection forms displayed in elevators in the state &quot;to put a face on government&quot;. Berry initially rejected the idea, but decided to implement it after winning reelection.

Berry has received a small following among younger North Carolinians due to her catchy name and her picture inside elevators in North Carolina. Her picture and signature appeared inside all elevators in North Carolina on the Certification of Operation leading to her receiving the unofficial title of &quot;The Elevator Queen.&quot; A paper published in a political science journal attributes her success above that of other Republican politicians to the presence of her name and picture in elevators across the state. In 2018 Elon University conducted a poll on photographic recognition of North Carolina politicians. Most of the respondents who correctly identified Berry referred to her as the &quot;Elevator Lady&quot; or the &quot;Elevator Queen&quot; instead of using her name.

In 2007 musician Dan Bryk recorded a song, &quot;Cherry Berry&quot;, about the &quot;gal in the elevator&quot; after seeing Berry&#x27;s photograph in an elevator. He released it under a pseudonym, Tha Commissioners, on a MySpace page and supplied a copy to a disc jockey at WKNC-FM, North Carolina State University&#x27;s student radio station. The music director at the station played it frequently, and Berry said of it, &quot;I just think it rocks.&quot; The band Alternative Champs also released a song about her, entitled, &quot;Cherie Berry&quot;. A Raleigh shirt company released a shirt with the words &quot;Cherie Berry lifts me up&quot; printed on the front. A Durham restaurant also listed a &quot;Cherie Berry&#x27;s Elevated Tea&quot; on its menu. In 2019 two North Carolina breweries released cherry-flavored beers in homage to Berry.

== Later life ==
Following her departure from the labor commissionership, Berry moved to Toledo, Ohio.

<text>The Museum of the Home, formerly the Geffrye Museum, is a free museum in the 18th-century Grade I-listed former almshouses on Kingsland Road in Hoxton, London. The museum&#x27;s change of name was announced in 2019. The museum explores home and home life from 1600 to the present day with galleries which ask questions about &#x27;home&#x27;, present diverse lived experiences, and examine the psychological and emotional relationships people have with the idea of &quot;home&quot; alongside a series of period room displays.

In 2018 the museum had about 120,000 visitors before then closing for two and a half years, during which an extensive refurbishment and building programme took place. The museum reopened as the Museum of the Home in summer 2021 with a mission to reveal and rethink the ways we live, in order to live better together, and with 80 per cent more exhibition space for its collections and 50 per cent more public space. The Museum of the Home now has new basement galleries (The Home Galleries), a cafe, learning pavilion, collections and reference libraries, several events spaces, and replanted gardens.

==History==

Almshouses were built on the site in 1714, to house the widows of ironmongers. The almshouses were funded by a bequest from Sir Robert Geffrye, a merchant who had served as Lord Mayor of London and Master of the Ironmongers&#x27; Company. There were 14 four-room houses, for up to 56 pensioners, with a large garden.

The Metropolitan Public Gardens Association contributed to the funding for the acquisition of the former almshouses and garden by Shoreditch Metropolitan Council, and the MPGA&#x27;s landscape gardener Fanny Wilkinson laid out the garden in 1900–01.

In 1911 the Ironmongers&#x27; Company decided the area had become too dangerous for pensioners, moved them to the country, and sold the buildings to the London County Council (LCC).

==Museum==
The museum opened on 2 April 1914. When the LCC took over the site to create the Geffrye Museum, Wilkinson&#x27;s design was replaced with a new layout. The area was a centre of the furniture trade, so it was decided to establish a reference collection of furniture and interiors to inspire the manufactures. When furniture production moved away the focus of the museum shifted to a younger audience, particularly school children. The curator between 1935 and 1940, Marjorie Quennell, introduced rooms furnished as at a series of historical times. In the latter part of the 20th century it was run by the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA).

Following the abolition of ILEA, the museum became a charitable trust in 1991.

In 1992 a herb garden was opened on a formerly derelict site to the north of the building, partly funded again by the MPGA, which then awarded the herb garden its London Spade Award in 1992.

The museum expanded in 1998 with the opening of a horseshoe-shaped extension designed by Branson Coates Architecture, providing space to add a 20th Century exhibition, shop and education rooms.

In January 2018, the museum closed for an £18m development project, reopening in June 2021. Until this closure, the main permanent displays were a series of room settings furnished and decorated to show the main living spaces and elements of domestic life through the centuries, reflecting changes in society, behaviour, style and taste. The museum&#x27;s change of name was announced in 2019. Since reopening, the museum has new galleries to &quot;explore the concept of home through people&#x27;s everyday experiences of making, keeping and being at home over the last 400 years&quot;.

With the reopening of the refurbished and extended buildings in summer 2021 the museum has 80 per cent more exhibition space for its collections and 50 per cent more public space, with its main entrance now facing Hoxton station. &quot;The Financial Times&quot;″ correspondent praised the Museum&#x27;s refurbishment and exhibits, stating: &quot;There is nothing else quite like the Museum of the Home ... Other museums tend to dwell on the finest artefacts, the most famous chairs, lamps or most beautiful manufactured pieces. This is not that. This is about how even the humblest of homes reveals rich, unique stories, a recognition that culture is not only the domain of museums but of all of our front rooms, bedside tables and the snaps in photo albums (or on phones) of years of family dinners in the room with slightly ropey wallpaper, the stopped clock, those old plates and granny’s dining table.&quot;

&quot;The Times&quot; dwelt on Michael McMillan&#x27;s West Indian front room: &quot;The stand-out set is the new West Indian front room circa 1976 with its glittery cushions, pineapple ice bucket and kitsch souvenirs from St Vincent. A proper home with cheering clutter ... The gardens are heavenly, the gift shop divine. It might be the best present-shopping spot in London.&quot;

The Museum&#x27;s director Sonia Solicari views the almshouse as &quot;a viable model for 21st-century housing&quot;, comparing it to the modern concept of pod living and saying that &quot;The home of the future is looking a lot like the past.&quot;

In 2022, the museum held a Festival of Sleep and a Winter Festival, and the BBC series &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; filmed a toys and childhood special at the museum. In 2023 the museum began to host exhibitions exploring the meaning of home to diverse communities, with disability rights activist Paul Darke curating an exhibition displaying toys that represent disability including characters from &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and the Barbie collection. In early summer 2023 &quot;No Place Like Home (A Vietnamese Exhibition) Part II&quot; showed at the museum and was co-curated and led by KV Duong and Hoa Dung Clerget, featuring a group of Vietnamese diasporic artists. In June 2023, the museum announced the joint acquisition with Tate of Rebecca Solomon&#x27;s 1861 painting, &quot;A Young Teacher&quot;.

==Architecture==

Several structures connected with the museum are listed on the National Heritage List for England. The main museum building is Grade I listed and the niche in the northwest corner of the forecourt of the museum is listed Grade II*. The forecourt wall, gates and railings to the museum are also Grade II* listed, and the two K6 telephone boxes on Kingsland Road outside the museum are listed Grade II. In 2021 the museum reopened following an extensive rebuilding programme.

==Statue of Robert Geffrye==

Above the Museum&#x27;s former entrance is a statue of the benefactor who financed the initial almshouses (not the museum which now occupies those buildings), Robert Geffrye. Geffrye was a merchant whose wealth was partly derived from the forced labour and trading of enslaved Africans. The statue is a replica replacing the 1723 original which was moved to the new almshouses in 1912 when the building was sold. Following the refurbishment of the museum and the reorientation of the site entrance towards Hoxton Station, the side of the building with the statue is now the back of the museum.

In July 2020 the museum held a consultation on the potential removal of the statue, with 79.4% of local people voting to take the statue down. Under pressure from the then Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who threatened to remove the museum&#x27;s funding, the museum&#x27;s board of trustees elected to &quot;reinterpret and contextualise&quot; the statue in its current location. There is now a sign at the foot of the building below the statue. 

In November 2021 the museum published a revision to their previous position, stating that the museum &quot;... strives to be a welcoming place for all. We feel that the statue of Robert Geffrye on the front of the Museum&#x27;s buildings does not promote the sense of belonging that is so important for our visitors, and fundamental to the Museum&#x27;s values.&quot; They went on to state that:

<text>The Computer History Museum (CHM) is a museum of computer history, located in Mountain View, California. The museum presents stories and artifacts of Silicon Valley and the Information Age, and explores the computing revolution and its impact on society.

==History==
The museum&#x27;s origins date to 1968 when Gordon Bell began a quest for a historical collection and, at that same time, others were looking to preserve the Whirlwind computer. The resulting &quot;Museum Project&quot; had its first exhibit in 1975, located in a converted coat closet in a DEC lobby. In 1978, the museum, now &quot;The Digital Computer Museum&quot; (TDCM), moved to a larger DEC lobby in Marlborough, Massachusetts. Maurice Wilkes presented the first lecture at TDCM in 1979 – the presentation of such lectures has continued to the present time.

TDCM incorporated as &quot;The Computer Museum&quot; (TCM) in 1982. In 1984, TCM moved to Boston, locating on Museum Wharf.

In 1996/1997, the TCM History Center (TCMHC) was established; a site at Moffett Field was provided by NASA (an old building that was previously the Naval Base furniture store) and a large number of artifacts were shipped there from TCM.

In 1999, TCMHC incorporated and TCM ceased operation, shipping its remaining artifacts to TCMHC in 2000. The name TCM had been retained by the Boston Museum of Science so, in 2000, the name TCMHC was changed to &quot;Computer History Museum&quot; (CHM).

In 2002, CHM opened its new building, previously occupied by Silicon Graphics, at 1401 N. Shoreline Blvd in Mountain View, California, to the public. The facility was later heavily renovated and underwent a two-year $19 million makeover before reopening in January 2011.

John Hollar, a former media executive, was appointed CEO in July 2008. Dan&#x27;l Lewin, a former technology executive, replaced Hollar as CEO in March 2018. CHM appointed former NASA Communications Leader Marc Etkind as its next President and Chief Executive Officer on February 19th, 2025.

==Public programs==
The Computer History Museum hosts regular public programs (currently under the &quot;CHM Live&quot; banner) with notable leaders (past and present) from Silicon Valley and the global tech sector, including past speakers such as Mark Zuckerberg, Reid Hoffman, Elon Musk, and Eric Schmidt, as well as academics, historians, and others on the impact of technology. The Museum also produces special events marking key anniversaries, such as the 40th Anniversary of the Apple Macintosh and the 50th Anniversary of Ethernet, featuring panels reflecting on the history and impact of key computing technologies.

Recordings of the Museum&#x27;s past events are viewable on its YouTube channel.

The Museum also hosts TechFest events for families.

==Collections and exhibition space==
The Computer History Museum claims to house the largest and most significant collection of computing artifacts in the world. This includes many rare or one-of-a-kind objects such as a Cray-1 supercomputer as well as a Cray-2, Cray-3, the Utah teapot, the 1969 Neiman Marcus Kitchen Computer, an Apple I, and an example of the first generation of Google&#x27;s racks of custom-designed web servers. The collection comprises nearly 90,000 objects, photographs and films, as well as of cataloged documentation and several hundred gigabytes of software.

The CHM oral history program conducts video interviews around the history of computing, this includes computer systems, networking, data-processing, memory, and data-storage. There are over 1,000 interviews recorded as of 2021, including panel discussions on the origins of the IBM PC and the hard disk drive, and individual interviews with Joanna Hoffman, Steve Chen, Dame Stephanie Shirley, and Donald Knuth.

The museum&#x27;s exhibit &quot;Revolution: The First 2000 Years of Computing&quot;, opened to the public on January 13, 2011. It covers the history of computing in 20 galleries, from the abacus to the Internet. The entire exhibition is also available online.On January 28, 2017, the Museum launched a exhibit &quot;Make Software: Change the World!&quot; The exhibit covers how people&#x27;s lives are transformed by software. Designed for middle schoolers and up, it features multimedia and touchscreen interactives, including a software lab where visitors can explore coding hands-on.

Other exhibits include a restoration of an historic PDP-1 minicomputer, two restored IBM 1401 computers, and a restored IBM Ramac 350 disk drive.

An operating difference engine designed by Charles Babbage in the 1840s and constructed by the Science Museum of London was on display until January 31, 2016. It had been on loan since 2008 from its owner, Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft executive.

===Software ===
The CHM is also home to an extensive collection of software, curated by Al Kossow, a veteran of Apple Computer whom the museum hired in 2006. Kossow is responsible for preservation and accession of software in the museum, as well as for developing CHM&#x27;s software-themed exhibitions. Kossow was a contributor to the museum long before being hired full-time and is the proprietor of Bitsavers, a large online repository of historical computer manuals and archived software and firmware acquired from his own collection and through donations from his peers.

In 2010 the museum began with the collection of source code of important software, beginning with Apple&#x27;s MacPaint 1.3, written in a combination of assembly language and Pascal and available as download for the public.

Many other accessions have followed over the years. APL programming language was received in 2012. Adobe donated the Photoshop 1.0.1 source code in 2013, and Postscript in 2022. Microsoft followed with the source code donation of SCP MS-DOS 1.25 and a mixture of Altos MS-DOS 2.11 and TeleVideo PC DOS 2.11 as well as Word for Windows 1.1a under their own license. On October 21, 2014, Xerox Alto&#x27;s source code was released. On January 19, 2023, the Apple Lisa source code was released to the public.

===Past exhibits===

On June 23, 1990, the Walk-Through Computer exhibit opened to help visitors learn how computers work. The interactive exhibit included a desktop computer, a giant monitor, a keyboard, and a diameter trackball (initially planned to be a &quot;bumper-car sized mouse&quot;) used by visitors to control the World Traveler program. In the Software Theater, animation and hardware video is used alongside a video feed of the World Traveler Program to show how computer programs work. This exhibit was closed on August 5, 1995, and re-opened as the Walk-Through Computer 2000 on October 21, 1995, to include an updated monitor, 3D graphics, and more interactive features. One of these features allowed visitors to change the pits imprinted on a giant CD-ROM, and the changes are seen on a monitor.

In 2016, the museum had a Liquid Galaxy in the &quot;Going Places: A History of Silicon Valley&quot; exhibit. The exhibit had 20 preselected locations that visitors can fly to on the Liquid Galaxy. An exhibit on the history of autonomous vehicles, from torpedoes to self-driving cars was also on display.

==Fellows==
The CHM Fellow Awards Program honors distinguished technology pioneers for their outstanding merits and significant contributions to the advancement of computing and the evolution of the digital age. The CHM Fellows are men and women &#x27;whose ideas have changed the world [and] affected nearly every human alive today&#x27;. The first fellow was Rear Admiral Grace Hopper in 1987. The fellows program has grown to 100 members as of 2024. Fellow nominations are open to the public and are accepted year round.

<doc id="1115482" wikidata="Q7623078" url="?curid=1115482" title="Streetcar suburb">
<text>A streetcar suburb is a residential community whose growth and development was strongly shaped by the use of streetcar lines as a primary means of transportation. Such suburbs developed in the United States in the years before the automobile, when the introduction of the electric trolley or streetcar allowed the nation’s burgeoning middle class to move beyond the central city’s borders. Early suburbs were served by horsecars, but by the late 19th century cable cars and electric streetcars, or trams, were used, allowing residences to be built farther away from the urban core of a city. Streetcar suburbs, usually called additions or extensions at the time, were the forerunner of today&#x27;s suburbs in the United States and Canada. San Francisco&#x27;s Western Addition is one of the best examples of streetcar suburbs before westward and southward expansion occurred.

Although most closely associated with the electric streetcar, the term can be used for any suburb originally built with streetcar-based transit in mind, thus some streetcar suburbs date from the early 19th century. As such, the term is general and one development called a streetcar suburb may vary greatly from others. However, some concepts are generally present in streetcar suburbs, such as straight (often gridiron) street plans and relatively narrow lots.

==Similar terms==

===Railroad suburbs===
By 1830, many New York City area commuters were going to work in Manhattan from what are now the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, which were not part of New York City at that time. They commuted by ferries. In 1852, architect Alexander Jackson Davis designed Llewellyn Park in New Jersey, a planned suburb served by both ferry and steam railroad. In the 1840s and 1850s, new railroad lines fostered the development of such New York City suburbs as Yonkers, White Plains, and New Rochelle. The steam locomotive in the mid 19th century provided the wealthy with the means to live in bucolic surroundings, to socialize in country clubs and still commute to work downtown. These suburbs were what historian Kenneth T. Jackson called the &quot;railroad suburbs&quot; and historian Robert Fishman called a &quot;bourgeois utopia&quot;.

Outside of Philadelphia, suburbs like Radnor, Bryn Mawr, and Villanova developed along the Philadelphia Main Line. As early as 1850, 83 commuter stations had been built within a 15-mile radius of Boston. Chicago saw huge developments, with 11 separate lines serving over 100 communities by 1873. A famous community served was Riverside, Illinois, arguably one of the first planned communities in the United States, designed in 1869 by Frederick Law Olmsted.

===Horsecar and cable car suburbs===

However, the suburbs closest to the city were based on horsecars and eventually cable cars. First introduced to America around 1830, the horse-drawn omnibus was revolutionary because it was the first mass transit system, offering regularly scheduled stops along a fixed route, allowing passengers to travel three miles sitting down in the time it would take them to walk two miles. Later more efficient horse-drawn streetcars allowed cities to expand to areas even more distant. By 1860, they operated in most major American and Canadian cities, including New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, Cincinnati, Saint Louis, Montreal, and Boston.

Horsecar suburbs emanated from the city center towards the more distant railroad suburbs. For the first time, transportation began to separate social and economic classes in cities, as the working and middle class continued to live in areas closer to the city center, while the rich could afford to live farther out.

==History==

===Development===
The introduction of the electrical streetcar in Richmond, Virginia, in 1887 by Frank J. Sprague marked the start of a new era of transportation-influenced suburbanization through the birth of the &quot;streetcar suburb&quot;. The early trolley allowed people to effortlessly travel in 10 minutes what they could walk in 30, and was rapidly introduced in cities like Boston and Los Angeles, and eventually to all larger American and Canadian cities. There were 5,783 miles of streetcar track serving American cities in 1890; this grew to 22,000 by 1902 and 34,404 by 1907.

By 1890, electric streetcar lines were replacing horse-drawn ones in cities of all sizes, allowing the lines to be extended and fostering a tremendous amount of suburban development. They were often extended out to formerly rural communities, which experienced an initial surge of development, and then new residential corridors were created along the newly built lines leading to what had sometimes been separate communities. On side streets, the houses closest to the original streetcar line are often as much as ten to twenty years older than houses built farther down the street, reflecting the initial surge and slow completion of a development.

Because streetcar operators offered low fares and free transfers, commuting was finally affordable to nearly everyone. Combined with the relatively cheap cost of land farther from the city, streetcar suburbs were able to attract a broad mix of people from all socioeconomic classes, although they were most popular by far with the middle class.

The houses in a streetcar suburb were generally narrow in width compared to later homes, and Arts and Crafts movement styles like the California Bungalow and American Foursquare were most popular. These houses were typically purchased by catalog and many of the materials arrived by railcar, with some local touches added as the house was assembled. The earliest streetcar suburbs sometimes had more ornate styles, including late Victorian and Stick. The houses of streetcar suburbs, whatever the style, tended to have prominent front porches, while driveways and built-in garages were rare, reflecting the pedestrian-focused nature of the streets when the houses were initially built. Setbacks between houses were not nearly as small as in older neighborhoods (where they were sometimes nonexistent), but houses were still typically built on lots no wider than 30 to 40 feet.

Shops such as groceries, bakeries, and drug stores were usually built near the intersection of streetcar lines, or directly along more heavily traveled routes (otherwise, routes would simply be lined with houses similar to those found in the surrounding neighborhoods). These shops would sometimes be multi-story buildings, with apartments on the upper floors. These provided convenient shopping for household supplies for the surrounding neighborhoods, which could potentially be visited on one&#x27;s way to or from work. While there were stores near houses, they were not quite as close as in older parts of cities, and they were usually confined to specific streets, representing the beginning of a complete separation between residential and commercial areas in cities.

Unlike railroad suburbs, which tended to form in pockets around stations along the interurban line, streetcar suburbs formed continuous corridors stretching outwards from city cores. The streetcar lines themselves were either built on roads that conformed to the grid, or on former turnpikes radiating in all directions from the city, sometimes giving such cities a roughly star-like appearance on maps. Along the lines, developers built rectangular &quot;additions&quot; with homes, usually on small lots, within a five- to ten-minute walk of the streetcar. These were essentially built on the grid plan of the older central cities, and typically spread out in between streetcar lines throughout a city.

=== Decline ===
Streetcar use continued to increase until 1923 when patronage reached 15.7 billion, but it declined in every year after that as automobile use increased amongst the middle and upper classes. By the 1930s, the once-profitable streetcar companies were diversifying by adding motorized buses and trackless trolleys to their fleets. By the 1940s, streetcar ridership had dropped dramatically, and few subdivisions were being built with streetcars or mass transit in general in mind. By the 1950s, nearly all streetcar lines had stopped running, and were instead served by buses. Compared to the streetcars, which were the primary method of transport at their peak and ran very frequent service, the replacement buses tended to be much less frequent and reliable. 

In the second half of the 20th century, streetcar suburbs in many American cities suffered serious deterioration. The home ownership boom facilitated by the Federal Housing Administration excluded neighborhoods which received negative reviews from FHA and bank officials in the underwriting process. FHA standards at the time discouraged many design features common in streetcar suburbs; small lots, narrow streets, semi-detached housing, lack of off-street parking, and mixing single-family houses with apartment or commercial buildings were all viewed negatively in FHA reports. This meant that streetcar suburbs were very frequently redlined. Without streetcar services, and lacking adequate space and infrastructure for residents to keep private automobiles, these neighborhoods were considered obsolete and were a frequent target of Urban renewal programs. The West End in Cincinnati, Bronzeville, Chicago, and West Philadelphia were all typical streetcar suburbs which were partially or completely demolished as part of postwar urban renewal programs.

===Modern streetcar suburbs===

Now somewhat urban in appearance, former streetcar suburbs are readily recognizable by the neighborhood structure along and near the route. Every few blocks, or along the entire route in well-preserved neighborhoods, there are small commercial structures, storefronts usually flush with the sidewalk; these were small stores—often groceries—operated by &quot;mom and pop&quot; operators who lived in quarters behind or above the establishment. Off-street parking, if it exists at all, is in the rear of the building.

Because stores were originally built along streetcar lines, a person could exit the transport near home, do some light shopping for dinner items, and continue by walking to his or her residence. These buildings also provided shopping for a non-employed spouse. Very few small groceries remain (outside of dense cities), though the space is often now used for non-foodstuff retail, capable of drawing clients from outside of the immediate neighborhood.

Modern streetcar suburbs are usually served by buses which run roughly the original streetcar routes, and may offer highly reasonable mass transit commute times to downtowns and other business areas, especially compared to later automobile suburbs. Toronto, Ontario, Canada is an example of a city in which most streetcar suburbs are still served by streetcars.

House prices in streetcar suburbs vary by neighborhood and city. Lots left empty in these areas during initial development, or where the initial houses have burned or been torn down, are usually too narrow for modern residential zoning regulations, meaning that it is difficult to infill housing in well-preserved streetcar suburbs. Occasionally two lots are combined into one for a wide enough lot, or many houses are torn down for a new use as needed. However, in some cases where historic zoning applies, infill housing is encouraged or required to match neighboring housing standards.

==Features==

In a greater sense, the streetcar suburbs of the early 20th century worked well for a variety of reasons.

* While most cities grew in a piecemeal fashion, without any real plan for future development, streetcar suburbs were highly planned communities that were organized under single ownership and control. Indeed, they would often be the first such developments in their respective cities.
* Most lots in streetcar suburbs were quite small by post-World War II suburban standards, allowing for a compact and walkable neighborhood, as well as convenient access to public transport (the streetcar line).
* Most streetcar suburbs were laid out in a grid plan, although designers of these suburbs often modified the grid pattern to suit the site context with curvilinear streets. Additionally, most of these pre-automobile suburbs included alleys with a noticeable absence of front-yard driveways.
* In terms of transportation, the streetcar provided the primary means for residents to get to work, shopping, and social activities. Yet, at either end of the streetcar trip, walking remained as the primary means of getting around. As a result, even in these early suburbs, the overall city remained very pedestrian friendly. This was not always the case for other vehicles. At the turn of the 20th century, the bicycle was also a popular form of mobility for many urban dwellers of the era. (However, when the streetcar rail tracks were encased in the asphalt of a street the resulting trench, for the flanges of the steel wheels, created a dangerous hazard for cyclists, being big enough to trap bicycle wheels but not large enough to get out of easily.)
* Because of the pedestrian-oriented nature of these communities, sidewalks were necessary in order to avoid an unacceptable and muddy walk to the streetcar on an unpaved street. Trees lining the streets were also seen as critical to a healthy and attractive neighborhood. While such developments often occurred on farmland or other cleared sites, the evidence of the street trees planted can be seen today in the large, overarching canopies found in these attractive post-turn-of-the-20th-century communities.

==Examples of streetcar suburbs in North America==


===Atlanta===
*Adair Park started developing in the 1890s as an all-white streetcar suburb and is now a majority-black area, with strong community commitment to preservation. The Wren&#x27;s Nest, the home of Joel Chandler Harris, the writer of the Uncle Remus stories, can be visited here.
*Inman Park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and became Atlanta&#x27;s first streetcar suburb in 1889. The trolley line is gone, but the trolley barn is still standing, renovated
*Virginia Highland developed starting in 1911, located at the end of Atlanta&#x27;s legendary Nine-Mile Circle trolley line
*Kirkwood was founded in 1899 as an independent city, which grew around a streetcar line between Atlanta and Decatur

===Austin===
*Hyde Park in Austin, Texas, traces its origins back to 1891 and is considered to be Austin&#x27;s first suburb. The neighborhood was originally developed by Monroe Martin Shipe in 1891 as a &quot;white only&quot; streetcar suburb with a large artificial lake, but it has since become one of the most densely populated areas in the city&#x27;s urban core.

===Baltimore===
*Roland Park

===Boston===
*Roxbury
*Dorchester
*Brighton became a streetcar suburb when transit lines were laid in 1889.
*Roslindale
*Brookline
*Somerville was studied with respect to the social mobility in streetcar suburbs.
*Chestnut Hill is a particularly affluent railroad/streetcar suburb, and has been home to Boston’s wealthy elite for two centuries.
*Winchester
*Arlington
*Belmont

*Melrose
*Malden

===Cleveland===
*Bratenahl
*Cleveland Heights
*East Cleveland
*Euclid

===Columbus===
*Bexley is the location of the Ohio Governor&#x27;s Mansion, along with a number of other large Tudor and Colonial style mansions.
*Grandview Heights 
*Old Beechwold
*Upper Arlington, specifically the original section south of Lane Avenue, was mapped out and developed around the Scioto Country Club, beginning just after WWI.

===Dallas===
* The neighborhood of Highland Park was mapped out specifically for such reasons, and attracted the wealthiest citizens of the city at the time.

===Detroit===
*The Grosse Pointe neighbourhoods were conceived of in the early 1890s as a retreat for wealthy Detroit businessmen and families. A passenger rail line that connected Detroit to Mt. Clemens, along the coast, was operational by the late 1890s, passing through what would become Grosse Pointe, making the area more accessible.
*Many of the neighborhoods of Detroit were built as streetcar suburbs. They are characterized by mostly single- and 2-family houses on 30 or 45-foot lots with a few townhouses and multifamily apartments scattered about. These include Springwells Village, Southwest Detroit, Michigan-Martin, Arden Park, and Boston–Edison.

===Edmonton===
*Alberta Avenue began development in the 1890s before the arrival of the Edmonton Radial Railway, however much of the neighbourhood&#x27;s development occurred after the streetcar&#x27;s introduction on 95th Street. 
*Central McDougall is bisected by 107th Avenue, which remained a streetcar route until the system&#x27;s closure, and by then most of the neighbourhood had been developed.
*Highlands was initially isolated from Edmonton&#x27;s developed area in the early 1900s, however developers negotiated with the city to extend the electric streetcar line, which made development in an otherwise isolated area possible. Much of the neighbourhood developed upon the Streetcar&#x27;s introduction along 112th Avenue.
*McCauley had been largely subdivided by 1892 upon Edmonton&#x27;s incorporation as a town, however little development occurred until 1912, when multiple streetcar services ran through the heart of McCauley on 97th and 95th Streets.
*Westmount developed early due to its proximity to downtown Edmonton, with access further enhanced by the extension of the streetcar in 1910 and commercial space developed along 124th Street along the line.
*Wîhkwêntôwin (formerly Oliver) was initially disconnected from the remaining town of Edmonton. Development was accelerated by the introduction of streetcar service in 1908 along Jasper Avenue.

===Houston===
* The Houston Heights neighborhood was created in 1891 by millionaire Oscar Martin Carter and a group of investors who established the Omaha and South Texas Land Company. It was its own municipality until the City of Houston annexed the Heights in 1919.
* Neartown was originally envisioned as a planned community and streetcar suburb dating back to the early 20th century before the development of River Oaks by developer J. W. Link and his Houston Land Corporation. Link built his own home in Montrose, known as the Link-Lee Mansion, which is now part of the University of St. Thomas campus.

===Indianapolis===
*Irvington, founded in 1870 five miles (8 km) east of downtown Indianapolis, prospered as a streetcar suburb in the 1890s, leading to Indianapolis annexing the community in 1902.
* Riverside, founded in 1902 three-and-a-half miles (5.6 km) northwest of downtown Indianapolis, was developed in the style of the City Beautiful movement with tree-lined streets, landscaped medians/traffic circles, generous setbacks, and glacier boulder retaining walls.

===Jacksonville===
*The combined Riverside and Avondale  neighborhoods were served by streetcar lines starting in 1887 until the 1930s, with ridership peaking at over 13 million riders in 1913. 

===Knoxville===
*Fourth and Gill, established in the 1880s, still contains most of its original houses and streetscapes.
*Oakwood, Knoxville, was studied as an example of a working-class, as opposed to middle-class, streetcar suburb.
*Old North Knoxville, established as a separate town in the 1880s.

===Los Angeles===
*Angelino Heights, built around the Temple Street horsecar (later upgraded to electric streetcar as part of the Los Angeles Railway Yellow Car system), was the first suburban development outside of downtown Los Angeles.
*Glendale, California, served by the Glendale–Burbank Line
*Highland Park developed along the Figueroa Street trolley lines and railroads linking downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena. The old right-of-way was reopened in 2003 as part of the Los Angeles County Transit Authority Metro Gold Line light rail.
*Leimert Park, a later streetcar suburb planned by the Olmsted Brothers firm, touted both its automobile accessibility and location along the 6 line of the Yellow Car.
*Much of South Central Los Angeles first developed as streetcar suburbia, served by the Yellow Car&#x27;s Vermont Avenue, Broadway, and Central Avenue lines.
*Southeast Los Angeles, including the neighborhoods of Huntington Park and Walnut Park, also served by the Yellow Car lines. 
*West Hollywood was marketed by developers in the late 19th and early 20th century for its proximity, by streetcar, both to downtown Los Angeles and Pacific Ocean beaches.
* Los Cerritos, Long Beach

===Miami===
Miami&#x27;s Coral Gables neighborhoods were built in the 1920s as the earliest suburbs of Downtown Miami by early Miami developers. Coral Gables was connected to Downtown, by a series of streetcars down Coral Way. Today, Coral Gables homes are some of the most expensive single-family homes in Miami, as the vast majority of them have been preserved since the 1920s. Within Coral Gables, Miracle Mile has urbanized over the decades, becoming a dense, urban neighborhood with numerous high rise apartment and office towers.

===Milwaukee===
*Shorewood was served by the numbers 10 and 15 streetcars on the north side until the mid-1950s, when it was converted to bus.
*Whitefish Bay was served by the number 15 streetcar on the north side until the mid-1950s, when it was converted to bus.
*Cudahy was served by the 15 and 16 streetcars on the south side.
*South Milwaukee was served by the 15 and 16 streetcars on the south side.
*Wauwatosa was served by the 10, 16 and 17 streetcars on the west side.
*West Allis was served by the 10, 18 and 19 streetcars on the west side.

===Montreal===

Most of Montreal&#x27;s streetcar suburbs feature a mix of attached red-brick or greystone duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes and multiplexes with exterior staircases instead of narrow-lot single-family homes. These areas usually feature a vibrant main street, usually the one where the trams traversed, that contains most of the shops, businesses and services, while smaller &quot;dépanneurs&quot; (Convenience stores) line the intersections of the smaller residential streets.

*Park-Extension: Tramways 80 &amp; 95
*Hochelaga-Maisonneuve: Tramways 84,87, 3, 5 &amp; 22
*Rosemont: Tramways 7,52 &amp; 54
*Verdun: Tramways 25 &amp; 58
*Notre-Dame-de-Grâce: Tramways 70, 83, 3 &amp; 31
*Villeray: Tramways 24, 35 &amp; 72

===Newark===
Many communities in Essex County, New Jersey were served by the Public Service Railway lines that fed into the Newark City Subway and the Newark Public Service Terminal including Irvington, Maplewood, Montclair, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge and The Oranges. Some of these routes remain today as NJ Transit Bus routes including the 21, 25, 27, 29 and 39.

===Omaha===
Soon after the city&#x27;s founding in 1856, many different companies provided horse-drawn cars, streetcars and eventually busing throughout the city. Streetcar service stopped on March 4, 1955. Some of the communities served exclusively as streetcar suburbs included:
* Kountze Place
* Dundee
* Benson
* South Omaha

===Ottawa===
* After the Bank St. streetcar to Lansdowne Park was installed, the Glebe began attracting upper-middle class residents, particularly those whose homes were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1900.
* The extension of the streetcar system along Richmond Road from Rochesterville to Britannia Park created the streetcar suburbs of Hintonburg, Westboro and Britannia Village.

===Philadelphia===
*Aldan
*Beechwood
*Brookline
*Camden
*Cheltenham
*Clifton Heights
*Collingdale
*Collingswood
*Darby
*Haddonfield
*Llanerch
*Media
*Merchantville
*Millbourne
*Norristown
*Oakmont
*Penfield
*Sharon Hill
*Springfield (Delco)
*Upper Darby
*West Philadelphia Streetcar Suburb Historic District

===Phoenix===
*The F. Q. Story Neighborhood Historic District was developed in the 1920s as one of Phoenix&#x27;s streetcar suburbs.

===Piedmont===
* Piedmont, California real estate developments and the Key System (or Key Route) street car lines were built and managed by Francis Marion Smith and Frank Colton Havens.

===Pittsburgh===

*Many of Pittsburgh&#x27;s more affluent areas began as streetcar suburbs, including Friendship, Highland Park, Squirrel Hill, and Regent Square, primarily residential neighborhoods located east of the city&#x27;s center. Outside city limits, the construction of streetcar tracks caused communities such as Edgewood, Sewickley, and Aspinwall to become heavily developed sanctuaries for the city&#x27;s upper middle class.
*The T light rail, Pittsburgh&#x27;s only current rail transit, encompasses former streetcar lines and connects the streetcar suburbs of Dormont, Mt. Lebanon, and Castle Shannon. Although the communities at the end of the line (Bethel Park and South Park) are mainly 1940s-60s automobile-dependent suburbs, some neighborhoods within them near the rail line reflect the character of streetcar communities, such as the neighborhood of Library.
* A streetcar in Pittsburgh also is known as a &quot;trolley,&quot; and Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood, a children&#x27;s public television show (1968–2001) originating in Pittsburgh, used a toy trolley as transition between reality and a &quot;Neighborhood of Make-Believe&quot; show segment, as trolleys would be familiar to local children in 1968.

===Portland, Oregon===
*Lents was a separate community connected to Portland by streetcar when it was platted in 1892.
*Laurelhurst was a planned community designed around the streetcar lines along Glisan Street.

===Richmond, Virginia===
*Barton Heights
* Bellevue
*Ginter Park
*Hermitage
*Laburnum Park
*Highland Park
*Highland Springs
*Sherwood Park
*Washington Park
*Westover Hills
*Woodland Heights

===St. Louis===
*Maplewood a bedroom community established at the end of a streetcar line from St. Louis. An early suburb of the city, touted for its fresh air in an era when St. Louis tended to have high smog levels from coal burning.
*University City formed in 1903, at the end of St. Louis&#x27; streetcar line to that area. One year before the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair, which was held nearby in Forest Park, spurred further development. A prominent area in University City is known as &quot;the Loop&quot; to this day, a reference to the streetcar lines which ended in a turnaround loop near the town hall. The Loop Trolley, a new historic streetcar line was built in this area. (2018).

===Salt Lake City===
*Sugar House is a neighborhood southeast of downtown Salt Lake City. It was originally established in 1853, however, saw its biggest expansion upon the completion of the Salt Lake City streetcar system. It was originally isolated from the region, as much of the city&#x27;s growth took place in and around downtown Salt Lake. But after the Utah Prison moved to the area and retail development took over 2100 South it become one of the most active areas of the city. Today it is home to SugarHouse Park, Westminster College, and a revived downtown area filled with mostly local and regional businesses. A modern streetcar line, the S-Line, was opened in 2013 by the city and the Utah Transit Authority, with plans to build a whole streetcar &quot;Park&quot; and modern transit-oriented development.

===San Jose===
* Hanchett Residence Park was San Jose&#x27;s first streetcar suburb. It was built in 1907 by Lewis E. Hanchett, who connected his streetcar system directly into the neighborhood using formal entrance gates, separate automobile entrances, and two of the earliest roundabout traffic circles built in America. The layout was designed by famed San Francisco Golden Gate Park designer John McLaren. San Jose&#x27;s Alum Rock Park and Venodome Hotel were also on different spurs of the streetcar line connecting downtown.
* Willow Glen was originally an independent town, until it voted to be annexed by San Jose in 1936. The Southern Pacific Railroad operated the Peninsular Rail line, which ran “Big Red Cars” down Bird, to Coe, to Lincoln, with a turn at Willow Street, then to Meridian Avenue. The line covered areas out to Saratoga and elsewhere, and Southern Pacific operated it at a financial loss from about 1918. In the 1920s, the city of San Jose ordered Southern Pacific to change the route’s alignment, which led to Willow Glen incorporating as a city in 1927 as an attempt to stop the realignment from going through. The railroad would ultimately end up being rerouted through nearby North Willow Glen.

===Seattle===
* Columbia City was established as an independent town in 1891 along the Rainier Avenue Electric Railway.
* Eastlake
* Ravenna was established adjacent to Ravenna Park after a streetcar line was built by the Rainier Power and Railway Company in 1891.
* Wallingford
*Alaska Junction (West Seattle)

===Toronto===

*West Hill, Cliffside, Birch Cliff, Riverdale, The Beaches, North Toronto, Parkdale, New Toronto, Mimico and Long Branch are all streetcar suburbs. The Scarborough neighbourhoods of West Hill (c. 1906) and Cliffside (c. 1901) lost their service in 1936 under the Toronto Transportation Commission (TTC). Birch Cliff lost its streetcar service (began in 1897) by the TTC in 1954. Streetcar service was also provided far outside of the modern Toronto areas as interurbans, into Port Credit west of Long Branch on the lakefront, which is now part of the city of Mississauga.

===Washington, D.C.===
During the late-1800s, streetcars spurred development in numerous villages in Washington County, D.C., including Brightwood, Mount Pleasant, Tenleytown, Chevy Chase, LeDroit Park, Uniontown, and Brookland. All lost streetcar service by the mid-1960s.

From the late 1880s to the end of the streetcar era, transit lines spread out of Washington and into the surrounding areas of Montgomery and Prince George&#x27;s counties in Maryland, heading out to Rockville, Forest Glen, Kensington, Takoma Park, and Berwyn Heights. In particular, the streetcar helped shape the development of the Gateway Arts District from Mount Rainier through Hyattsville and Riverdale Park and beyond through College Park to Laurel.

==Australasia==
Kelburn, New Zealand is served by the Wellington Cable Car, and Karori transport once linked to it.

The inner suburbs of many Australian cities were planned around tram lines. Melbourne&#x27;s existing extensive tram network includes some examples of existing tram suburbs where tram was the dominant form of early transportation and still a major form of transport, including Carlton, Fitzroy, St Kilda, Albert Park, South Melbourne and Brunswick. Sydney also once had the largest tram network in the Southern Hemisphere, with many of the contemporary main streets of different suburbs having been built around tram stops.

== Old World ==
In the Old World, many residential neighborhoods were developed in the early days of industrial urbanization before electric streetcars/trams were invented. However, in much of Europe tram systems eventually came to play a much larger role in public transportation than in most of the New World. Here, therefore, the term &quot;streetcar suburb&quot; is not needed as distinct concept as &quot;most&quot; neighborhoods in many European cities are tram-oriented, especially in those countries which still had a lower rate of private automobile ownership in the 20th century, such as in the former Soviet Union.

An example is the city of Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. Prague has built many new suburban roads since the fall of communism and also has an extensive metro and bus system, but because its central core is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city authorities limit new road construction in historic areas. Instead the tram system is the backbone of the transportation system, with many pre-communist and communist-era neighborhoods featuring brick and plaster walk-up apartment buildings lining roads that are served by several tram routes which run into the centre of the city. This is broadly similar to many mid-sized European cities.

As housing was scarce in much of the Eastern bloc, new construction mostly occurred in the Plattenbau/Panelák style and new neighborhoods were planned from the outset with a tram connection to enable easy commuting. Examples include the planned developments of Berlin Marzahn, Halle-Neustadt or Dresden-Gorbitz. In the west, streetcars had lost much of their importance so similar neighborhoods were built along much more car-dependent lines or - in the case of Nürnberg Langwasser - with a new subway that was built from Langwasser inwards to link the new neighborhoods to jobs and shopping in downtown Nuremberg.
