<text>Hidden text is computer text that is displayed in such a way as to be invisible or unreadable. Hidden text is most commonly achieved by setting the font colour to the same colour as the background, rendering the text invisible unless the user highlights it. 

Hidden text can serve several purposes. Often, websites use it to disguise spoilers for readers who do not wish to read that text. Hidden text can also be used to hide data from users who are less Internet-experienced or who are not familiar with a particular website. Another meaning may refer to hidden text to small messages at the bottom of advertisements that are permitted by some law to state a particular liability or requirement in text (also known as fine print). An example of this practice is to display an FTP password in hidden text to reduce the number of users who are able to access downloads and thereby save bandwidth. Parody sites (such as Uncyclopedia) occasionally use the technique as a joke about censorship, with the &quot;censored&quot; text displayed black-on-black in an obvious manner akin to a theatrical stage whisper. 

It is also used by websites as a spamdexing technique to fill a page with keywords that a search engine will recognize but are not visible to a visitor. However, Google has taken steps to prevent this by parsing the color of text as it indexes it and checking to see if it is transparent, and may penalize pages and give them lower rankings. 

Conversely, Project Honey Pot uses links intended only to be followed by spambots; the links point to honeypots which detect e-mail address harvesting. A link using rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; (to hide it from legitimate search engine spiders) and hidden text (to remove it for human visitors) would remain visible to malicious &#x27;bots.

Compare with metadata, which is usually also hidden, but is used for different purposes.

Hidden characters are characters that are required for computer text to render properly but which are not a part of the content, so they are hidden. This includes characters such as those used to add a new line of text or to add space between words, commonly referred to as &quot;white space characters&quot;.

<text>Traverse City Central High School (also known as Central High School, TC Central, or simply TCC) is a public high school in Traverse City, Michigan. It is one of two comprehensive high schools in the Traverse City Area Public Schools district. It is the second-largest high school in Northern Michigan, behind rival Traverse City West Senior High School.

== History ==
The first public school in Traverse City opened in 1853. In 1877, it was moved to a new building called the Central School, built at Seventh and Pine Streets, which was rebuilt as a brick building in 1886. In 1934, the Central school building burned down, and students were relocated to the nearby Perry Hannah House while the school was being rebuilt.

In 1959, grades 10 through 12 moved into a new building called Traverse City Senior High School at its present-day location, on grounds formerly owned by the Northwestern Michigan College.

In 1978, 1985 and 1988, the Trojans of Traverse City Senior High School won the MHSAA Class A football championships.

In 1997, because of overcrowding at the school, which had become one of the largest high schools in Michigan, a second high school was built, and opened in early 1998. The new high school became Traverse City West Senior High School, and the existing one was renamed to Traverse City Central High School.

From 1997 to 2022, Traverse City Central&#x27;s athletic programs were part of the Big North Conference, which was founded as a collection of Northern Michigan&#x27;s largest public high schools after Traverse City&#x27;s school split. However, in 2021, both Central and rival West made the decision to move football programs to the Saginaw Valley League in 2022, but remain in the Big North for all other offered sports.

In 2021, a group of white students at Traverse City Central held a mock slave auction on Snapchat where they sold fellow students of color. An attempt by the school board to pass an equity resolution condemning racism met with a fierce backlash from white parents, who falsely claimed that it was a means of indoctrinating students with critical race theory.

In October 2023, construction began on a new &quot;Innovation &amp; Manufacturing Center&quot; at the school, focusing on STEM education. The new wing is expected to open by the end of 2024.

== Demographics ==
The demographic breakdown of the 1,324 students enrolled in 2023-24 was:

* Male – 52.9%
* Female – 47.1%
* American Indian/Alaska Native – 1.5%
* Asian – 1.3%
* Black – 1.2%
* Hispanic – 3.4%
* Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander – 0.2%
* White – 88.9%
* Multiracial – 3.5%

Additionally, 361 students (27.3%) were eligible for reduced-price or free lunch.

== Athletics ==
Traverse City Central&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Trojans. The school is part of the Big North Conference for all sports except football, which plays in the Saginaw Valley League and is considered a Class A school by MHSAA.

In 1978, 1985 and 1988, the Trojans of Traverse City Senior High School won the MHSAA Class A football championships. In 2021, the Trojans made it to the MHSAA Division 2 Championship round at Ford Field, but ultimately lost to the Warren De La Salle Pilots.

=== Rivalries ===
Traverse City Central has had an intense crosstown rivalry with the Traverse City West Titans since 1997. Prior to then, the Traverse City Trojans had an intense rivalry with the Alpena Wildcats.

<doc id="1102966" wikidata="Q936477" url="?curid=1102966" title="Killer's Kiss">
<text>Killer&#x27;s Kiss is a 1955 American independently produced crime film noir directed by Stanley Kubrick and written by Kubrick and Howard Sackler. It is the second feature film directed by Kubrick, following his 1953 debut feature, &quot;Fear and Desire&quot;. The film stars Jamie Smith, Irene Kane, and Frank Silvera.

The film is about Davey Gordon (Jamie Smith), a 29-year-old middleweight New York boxer at the end of his career, and his relationship with his neighbor, taxi dancer Gloria Price (Irene Kane), and her violent employer Vincent Rapallo (Frank Silvera).

==Plot==
In New York, veteran welterweight boxer Davey Gordon lives in the same building as taxi dancer Gloria Price. Their windows face each other, and they steal glances at one another. The two leave their building at the same time to report to their jobs-Davey prepares to fight newcomer Kid Rodriguez, and Gloria is picked up by Vinnie Rapallo, her boss. Davey&#x27;s fight with Kid Rodriguez is televised, and Rapallo brings Gloria to his office, both to watch the fight, and to make sexual advances. Davey is knocked out, goes home, and takes a phone call from his uncle, who wants Davey to return to the family farm near Seattle. Davey is awakened from a dream by Gloria&#x27;s screaming, and sees that Rapallo is assaulting her. Davey runs across the roof of the building to reach Gloria&#x27;s apartment, finding her unharmed.

The next morning, Davey and Gloria share breakfast. Gloria describes her family history: her older sister Iris was an accomplished ballerina, and their mother died while giving birth to Gloria. Gloria&#x27;s father favored Iris, and Gloria resented Iris. Shortly after their father&#x27;s death, Iris committed suicide. Davey and Gloria fall for each other, arrange to go to Seattle, and also to collect their final payments at Gloria&#x27;s dance hall.

Outside the dance hall, street thieves steal Davey&#x27;s scarf and Davey chases them, just as his manager arrives to hand off final payment. Inside, Rapallo initially refuses to give Gloria her final payment, believing that she will leave with another man. When Rapallo&#x27;s henchmen see Gloria standing with Davey&#x27;s manager outside the building, they mistake him for her lover, and entice Gloria back into the building to collect her payment. Davey and Gloria reunite, and leave with Gloria&#x27;s collected payment. Rapallo&#x27;s henchmen kill Davey&#x27;s manager. At the apartment building, Davey vacates his unit and crosses the roof to Gloria&#x27;s, finding it empty as well. Looking across to his old window, Davey observes police searching for him, suspecting him in the murder of his manager.

Davey stalks Rapallo and forces him to drive to a hideout, where Gloria is being held. As Davey attempts to free Gloria, the gangsters overpower him. Davey escapes, pursued by the gangsters, and uses a fire escape to climb onto a rooftop. Rapallo pursues him into a mannequin warehouse, and they fight to the death. Rapallo wields an axe, the two hurl mannequin parts at each other, and Davey kills Rapallo.

At Penn Station, Davey awaits his train to Seattle and reminisces over the events of the past few days. He and Gloria were questioned separately, and once the police concluded that Davey acted in self-defense and was not responsible for his manager&#x27;s murder, he was freed. Gloria finds Davey waiting for his train, and the two embrace.

==Cast==
==Background==
This was Kubrick&#x27;s second feature. Kubrick removed his first film, &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; (1952), from circulation over his dissatisfaction with it. Kubrick directed that film between the ages of 23 and 24, and had to borrow $40,000 () from his uncle Martin Perveler, who owned a chain of drug stores in Los Angeles. &quot;Killer&#x27;s Kiss&quot;, originally titled &quot;Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot;, was also financed privately through family and friends, but because &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; did not recoup its production budget, Perveler did not invest this time. Most of the initial budget was covered by Morris Bousel, a Bronx pharmacist who was rewarded with a co-producer credit.

Kubrick began to shoot the film with sound recorded on location, as was common practice in Hollywood. However, frustrated by the intrusion of the microphone into his lighting scheme, Kubrick fired his sound man and decided to post-dub the entire film as he had with his first film. The film is notable for its location shots in the old Penn Station, which was demolished in 1963, as well as Times Square, and the run-down streets of both the Brooklyn waterfront and of Hell&#x27;s Hundred Acresthe nickname at the time for Manhattan&#x27;s SoHo neighborhood.

Ballerina Ruth Sobotka, Kubrick&#x27;s wife at the time, was the art director for this film, as well as for Kubrick&#x27;s next, &quot;The Killing&quot;. She is also featured in a long dance solo, playing the role of Iris. Then-model and future writer and television journalist Chris Chase, using the stage name Irene Kane, made her acting debut as the female lead.

Against Kubrick&#x27;s wishes, United Artists required the film be recut with a happy ending.
United Artists paid $100,000 for the film and also agreed to provide $100,000 for Kubrick&#x27;s next, &quot;The Killing&quot;.

The film features the song &quot;Once&quot;, written by Norman Gimbel and Arden Clar. It is one of Gimbel&#x27;s earliest contributions to a film, although his lyrics do not appear in the final version.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

When released, the staff at &quot;Variety&quot; magazine gave the film a mixed review, and wrote:
In a 2003 review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote:
===Awards===
Wins
* Locarno International Film Festival: Prize, Best Director, Stanley Kubrick; 1959.

===Adaptation===
In 1983 Matthew Chapman directed &quot;Strangers Kiss&quot;, a film that portrayed the making of &quot;Killer&#x27;s Kiss&quot;.

==Home media==

The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray as a special feature of The Criterion Collection&#x27;s release of Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Killing&quot;. A UHD Blu-ray was released by Kino Lorber on June 28, 2022.

<text>Buntingford Manor House is an 18th-century building in the town of Buntingford, in Hertfordshire, England. It is a Grade II listed building.

==Usage==
The house, located on Market Hill in between The Crown Public House and Barclays Bank, was originally the home of the Lord of the Manor.
The building was bought by Buntingford Town Council in 1996 and converted to become its headquarters. It is also used as the Buntingford Heritage Centre, where information on the history of the town can be found.

<doc id="1102989" wikidata="Q5253588" url="?curid=1102989" title="Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives">
<text>Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives (called either delegates or resident commissioner, in the case of Puerto Rico) are representatives of their territory in the House of Representatives, who do not have a right to vote on legislation in the full House but nevertheless have floor privileges and are able to participate in certain other House functions. Non-voting members may introduce legislation and may vote in a House committee of which they are a member.

There are currently six non-voting members: a delegate representing the District of Columbia, a resident commissioner representing Puerto Rico, as well as one delegate for each of the other four permanently inhabited U.S. territories: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A seventh delegate, representing the Cherokee Nation, has been formally proposed but not yet seated, while an eighth, representing the Choctaw Nation, is named in a treaty but has neither been proposed nor seated. As with voting members, delegates are elected every two years, except the resident commissioner of Puerto Rico, who is elected every four years.

==Privileges of delegates==
Non-voting members serve exclusively in the House of Representatives; the Senate has no non-voting members (with the exception of the vice president of the United States, who may vote but only to break ties) and no members representing the territories or the District of Columbia. All delegates serve a term of two years, while resident commissioners serve a term of four years. They receive compensation, benefits, and franking privileges (the ability to send outgoing U.S. mail without a stamp) similar to full House members. The rules governing the rights of a non-voting member are set forth in the House Rules adopted in each congress (i.e., every two years). Since 1993, they have changed three times, and current delegates—along with the resident commissioner—enjoy privileges that they did not have previously.

==Early history==

Territorial delegates existed before the ratification of the United States Constitution. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 allowed for territory with &quot;five thousand free male inhabitants of full age&quot; to elect a non-voting delegate to the Continental Congress. After the ratification of the Constitution, the first United States Congress reenacted the Ordinance and extended it to include the territories south of the Ohio River.

In 1790, the state of North Carolina—having recently ratified the constitution, becoming the 12th state—sent its congressional delegation to what was then the federal capital at New York City. Among them was former State of Franklin governor John Sevier, whose district (Washington District) comprised the &quot;counties beyond the Alleghenies&quot;. He took office June 16, 1790, however, the government of North Carolina had ceded Washington District to the federal government on February 25, 1790, and it was organized as the Southwest Territory on August 7, 1790. He remained a member of the House until March 3, 1791, when he was appointed brigadier general of the militia.

On September 3, 1794, James White was elected by the Southwest Territory, which contained the former Washington District, to be their delegate to Congress. A resolution was put forth in the House to admit him to Congress, but as a delegate was not a position stated in the Constitution, the House debated what, if any, privileges White would have. As the Northwest Ordinance had only stated that a delegate is to sit &quot;in Congress&quot; the first debate was which chamber a delegate would sit in. Resolutions that he sit in both chambers and that his right to debate is limited to territorial matters were defeated. Ultimately, the House voted to allow him a non-voting seat in the House.

Following his placement, representatives debated whether he should take the oath. Representative James Madison stated &quot;The proper definition of Mr. White is to be found in the Laws and Rules of the Constitution. He is not a member of Congress, therefore, and so cannot be directed to take an oath, unless he chooses to do it voluntarily.&quot;
As he was not a member, he was not directed to take the oath, though every delegate after him has done so. He was also extended franking privileges, which allowed him to send official mail free of charge, and compensation at the same rate as members.

In 1802 Congress passed a law that specifically extended franking privileges and pay to delegates. An act passed in 1817 codified the term and privileges of delegates:

[I]n every territory of the United States in which a temporary government has been, or hereafter shall be established...shall have the right to send a delegate to Congress, such delegate shall be elected every second year, for the same term of two years for which members of the House of Representatives of the United States are elected; and in that house, each of the said delegates shall have a seat with a right of debating, but not of voting.
From that point on, until August 1959, there was not a single congress without delegates. During the period from 1870 to 1891, there were as many as ten serving at one time. With the admission of Hawaii, and with Puerto Rico sending a Resident Commissioner, the office temporarily went out of existence.

==Resident commissioner==

Similar to delegates are resident commissioners, who represented the large areas acquired during the Spanish–American War, and for much of the 20th century were considered colonies, not territories and unlike the previously acquired areas which would become the contiguous U.S. or Alaska and Hawaii, did not initially have residents with the rights of or to U.S. citizenship. Territories can secede from the United States with the consent of Congress,
 and in the case of the Philippines, they have.

===Puerto Rico===
Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth, has been represented by a non-voting resident commissioner since 1901. The resident commissioner holds a status similar to that of a delegate within the House, but, since 1921, serves a four-year term. The resident commissioner is the only individual elected to the House who serves for this duration.

===The Philippines===

From 1907 until 1937, while it was a U.S. territory, the Philippines elected two non-voting resident commissioners to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. From 1937 until 1946, while it was a U.S. commonwealth, the Philippines sent one non-voting resident commissioner to the House. Upon independence in 1946, the Philippines ceased to be represented in Congress.

== List of past delegates ==

Listed here by their congressional districts.

== Current delegates ==
In the mid-1960s, a number of small territories that had no prospects of becoming states began to petition for representation in Congress. Starting in 1970, the House of Representatives started to grant representation to these territories, but with limited voting rights.

===American Samoa===

As the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam had delegates in Washington, D.C., the American Samoa-based &quot;Political Status Study Commission&quot; had meetings with the delegates from these two territories. They came home to Pago Pago convinced of the importance of having this representation in the nation&#x27;s capital. Members of the American Samoa Fono had already been attending budget hearings in Washington for over a decade by 1970. During a special session held in July 1969, Salanoa Aumoeualogo, the President of the American Samoa Senate, introduced Senate Bill 54 to create a delegate at-large to Washington with four-year terms (without congressional rights), which was approved by Governor Owen Aspinall on August 8, 1969. A. U. Fuimaono was elected at the first delegate at-large in 1970 before ending his term to run unsuccessfully for Governor of American Samoa. A. P. Lutali became the territory&#x27;s second delegate to Washington in 1975. Fofō Sunia was elected in 1978 after Lutali declined to run for reelection. He went to Washington knowing his term would be limited to two years, since a law had passed establishing an official non-voting delegate seat for American Samoa. Sunia was elected as American Samoa&#x27;s first congressional delegate in 1981.

===District of Columbia===

The District of Columbia is technically a federal district—not a territory, commonwealth or insular area. However, from 1871 to 1875, it briefly had a delegate to Congress. This situation did not last long and congressional representation was terminated. The district had no other delegates until 1971, when the House of Representatives agreed to seat Walter E. Fauntroy. He then served in that position between March 23, 1971 and January 3, 1991, when Eleanor Holmes Norton was elected. Norton continues in that position.

===U.S. Virgin Islands===

In 1972, the House agreed to admit Ron de Lugo as a delegate from the United States Virgin Islands, which had been a U.S. territory since 1917 after they were purchased from Denmark under the 1916 Treaty of the Danish West Indies. The current delegate, Stacey Plaskett, became the first nonvoting delegate to serve as an impeachment manager in the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump.

===Guam===
In 1972, the House also agreed to admit Antonio Borja Won Pat as a delegate from Guam, which had been a U.S. territory since 1899 when it was ceded to the United States by Spain under the Treaty of Paris. Won Pat had been serving as the Washington Representative since 1965, an office without congressional rights that lobbied for a place in the House. Since 2023, this seat has been represented by Republican James Moylan.

===Northern Mariana Islands===

For thirty years, since 1978, citizens of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) elected a resident representative, commonly known as Washington representative, an office without congressional rights that was established to represent the CNMI in Washington and performing related official duties established by CNMI law.

In 2008, the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, signed into law by President George W. Bush, replaced the position of Resident Representative with a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives. The election of the first delegate took place in November 2008. It was the only contest on the ballot because CNMI elections traditionally occurred in odd-numbered years. Gregorio Sablan won the election and took office in January 2009. Sablan retired in 2024 and was succeeded by Kimberlyn King-Hinds.

==Native American treaty-right delegates==

The Cherokee and Choctaw Native American tribes have treaty rights to send delegates to Congress. The right to a non-voting delegate to Congress was promised to the Cherokee by the Treaty of Hopewell in 1785 (affirmed in 1835&#x27;s Treaty of New Echota) and to the Choctaw under the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek in 1830, &quot;whenever Congress shall make provision for [a delegate]&quot;. Congress has never provided for the appointment of delegates from Indian tribes. The Choctaw tribe has never appointed a delegate to Congress and the Cherokee had not until 2019. However, the Choctaw did send a non-congressional delegate to Washington for most of the 19th century as an ambassador to represent them before the U.S. government, the most noteworthy being Peter Pitchlynn.

In addition, the first treaty signed between the United States and a Native American nation, the Treaty of Fort Pitt (1778) with the Lenape (&quot;Delaware Nation&quot;), encouraged them to form a state that would have representation in Congress; however, it is unclear if the treaty would allow a delegate without the formation of a U.S. state. In 2022, Deborah Dotson, president of Delaware Nation, expressed an opinion that their treaty right was &quot;stronger&quot; than the Cherokees&#x27; and voiced frustration about their treaty promises being ignored.

A similar situation actively exists at the state legislature level with the Maine House of Representatives maintaining seats for three non-voting delegates representing the Penobscot (since 1823), the Passamaquoddy (since 1842), and the Maliseet (since 2012). The rights of the tribal delegates has fluctuated over time but appears to have been born from a practice in Massachusetts General Court (Maine was a part of Massachusetts until 1820). Unlike the situation at the federal level, Maine&#x27;s state-level tribal delegates are established by state law rather than treaties. As of 2015, only the Passamaquoddy seat is filled; the other two Nations have chosen to currently not fill their seats in protest over issues of tribal sovereignty and rights. The Wisconsin Legislature, the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in Canada, and the New Zealand Parliament were allegedly reviewing Maine&#x27;s indigenous delegate policy for their own adoption (though New Zealand had already established Māori electorates since 1867).

There remain, however, untested questions about the validity of such delegates. If tribal citizens are represented in the House by both a voting member and a non-voting delegate, that might be seen as contrary to the principle of &quot;one person, one vote&quot;. Disagreement on which federally recognized tribes would appoint the relevant delegate could also occur (e.g. the Choctaw delegate might represent only the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, say, or also the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians; similarly with the Cherokee Nation and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians). In 2022, the Congressional Research Service published &quot;Legal and Procedural Issues Related to Seating a Cherokee Nation Delegate in the House of Representatives&quot;, addressing these concerns and logistical issues.

On August 25, 2019, the Cherokee Nation formally announced its intention to appoint a delegate, nominating Kimberly Teehee, the tribe&#x27;s vice president of government relations, as its first delegate. According to the process used for other non-voting delegates, the House of Representatives must vote to formally admit Teehee. Some congressional leaders have expressed concerns about Teehee being appointed by a tribal government rather than elected by tribal members; Teehee has contended that, since the Cherokee Nation is a sovereign nation, her appointment as a delegate should be viewed analogous to an ambassadorship. An ambassadorial view of Native delegates is consistent with prior history of Native envoys to Washington and Maine&#x27;s state-level tribal delegates. Teehee&#x27;s appointment to the House was not finalized in the 116th Congress and has been reported to have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Teehee remained unseated as of September 2022, when the Cherokee Nation government reiterated their insistence that Congress seat her.

==Expanding (and contracting) voting rights==
The positions of non-voting delegates are now a more or less permanent fixture of the House of Representatives, having been supported by legislation. However, this legislation stipulates that &quot;...the right to vote in the committee shall be provided by the Rules of the House.&quot; Under Article I, Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution, the House establishes its rules, which allows a majority of the House to change the powers of delegates. Since the 1970s, delegates have served on Congressional committees with the same powers and privileges as members of Congress, including the right to cast votes, but since 1993 their ability to vote on the floor of the House has changed several times.

In 1993, the 103rd Congress approved a rule change that allowed the four delegates and the resident commissioner to vote on the floor of the House, but only in the Committee of the Whole. However, if any measure passed or failed in the Committee of the Whole because of a delegate&#x27;s vote, a second vote—excluding the delegates—would be taken. In other words, delegates were permitted to vote only if their votes had no effect on a measure&#x27;s ultimate outcome. This change was denounced by Republicans (all five of the delegates either were Democrats or were allied with the Democrats at the time) as a case of partisanship; the Democrats had lost a dozen House seats in the 1992 elections, and Republicans charged allowing delegates to vote would inflate Democratic vote totals. In 1995, this rule was reversed by the newly seated Republican majority in the 104th Congress; stripping the delegates, all of whom caucused with the Democrats, of even non-decisive voting privileges. Upon re-gaining control of the House in January 2007, Democrats revived the 1993–1995 status for delegates during both the 110th and 111th Congresses. After taking back control of the House in 2011, Republicans revoked the right of delegates to vote in the Committee of the Whole during the term of the 112th Congress. In 2019, Democrats took back control of the House and delegates have retained the right to vote in the Committee of the Whole since the 116th United States Congress. In a contrast from previous GOP majorities, delegate voting in the Committee of the Whole remains in place for the 118th Congress. 

==Current non-voting members of the U.S. House of Representatives==
As of the 118th United States Congress, the six non-voting delegates consist of three Democrats and three Republicans. Pablo Hernández Rivera, of Puerto Rico, a member of the Popular Democratic Party, affiliates nationally to the Democratic Party.

<text>Burton Nathan Raffel (April 27, 1928 – September 29, 2015) was an American writer, translator, poet and professor. He is best known for his vigorous translation of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, still widely used in universities, colleges and high schools. Other important translations include Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, &quot;Poems and Prose from the Old English&quot;, &quot;The Voice of the Night: Complete Poetry and Prose of Chairil Anwar&quot;, &quot;The Essential Horace&quot;, Rabelais&#x27; &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; and Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;.

== Biography ==

Raffel was born in New York City in 1928. An alumnus of James Madison High School in Brooklyn, New York (1944), Raffel was educated at Brooklyn College (B.A., 1948), Ohio State University (M.A., 1949), and Yale Law School (J.D., 1958). As a Ford Foundation fellow, Raffel taught English in Makassar, Indonesia, from 1953 to 1955. Following the completion of his legal studies and admission to the New York State Bar in 1959, Raffel practiced law as an associate at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy before deciding that he was not suited to practice law. Between 1960 and 1963, he served as founding editor of &quot;Foundation News&quot;, a trade journal published by the Council on Foundations.

He taught at Brooklyn College (lecturer in English, 1950–51), Stony Brook University (instructor of English, 1964–65; assistant professor of English, 1965–66), the University at Buffalo (associate professor of English, 1966–68), the University of Haifa (visiting professor of English, 1968–69), the University of Texas at Austin (visiting professor of English, 1969–70; professor of English and classics and chair of the graduate program in comparative literature, 1970–71), the Ontario College of Art (senior tutor, 1971–72), York University, Toronto (visiting professor of humanities, 1972–75), Emory University (visiting professor, spring 1974) and the University of Denver (professor of English, 1975–89).

From 1989 until his death, he held the Chair in Humanities at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, ultimately retiring from active service as distinguished professor emeritus of arts and humanities and professor emeritus of English in 2003.

Raffel died on September 29, 2015, at the age of 87.

== Translations ==
He translated many poems, including the Anglo-Saxon epic &quot;Beowulf&quot;, poems by Horace, and &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; by François Rabelais. In 1964, Raffel recorded an album along with Robert P. Creed, on Folkways Records entitled &quot;Lyrics from the Old English.&quot; In 1996, he published his translation of Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, which has been acclaimed for making Cervantes more accessible to the modern generation. In 2006, Yale University Press published his new translation of the Nibelungenlied. Among his many edited and translated publications are &quot;Poems and Prose from the Old English&quot;, and Chrétien de Troyes&#x27; &quot;Cligès&quot;, &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot;, &quot;Perceval, the Story of the Grail&quot;, &quot;Erec and Enide&quot;, and &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;.

Raffel worked with Yale University Press and Harold Bloom on a series of 14 annotated Shakespeare plays. In 2008 the Modern Library published his new translation of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.

Raffel&#x27;s main contribution to translation theory was the principle of &quot;syntactic tracking&quot;, which he championed in a monograph published in 1994. According to this theory, a good translation of a prose literary text should track the syntax of the original element-by-element, never joining sentences where the original separated them, never splitting a long sentence, never rearranging the order of ideas. The accuracy of tracking is measured syntactically by counting punctuation marks: the best translation will be the one which comes closest to the original in a statistical analysis of commas, colons and full stops. Raffel claimed that those translators who heed the syntax also make the best lexical choices, so that tracking becomes a measure not only of syntactic accuracy but of translating skills per se. This principle has since been applied in scholarly studies of translations of classical and modern works.

=== &quot;Beowulf&quot; translation ===
Raffel&#x27;s 1963 &quot;Beowulf&quot; has been described by Hugh Magennis as &quot;an extremely free imitative verse.&quot; Magennis calls it highly accessible and readable, using alliteration lightly, and creating a &quot;vivid and exciting narrative concerned with heroic exploits ... in a way that [the modern reader] can understand and appreciate. Clarity, logic and progression are hallmarks of this treatment of narrative in Raffel&#x27;s translation, producing a satisfying impression of narrative connectedness&quot;.

== Literary production ==

Over the years he published numerous volumes of poetry; however, only one remains in print: &quot;Beethoven in Denver&quot;. &quot;Beethoven&quot; describes what happens when the dead composer visits Denver, Colorado, in the late 1970s. Also set in Colorado was the Raffel-scripted film, &quot;The Legend of Alfred Packer&quot;, the first film version of the story of Alferd Packer.

<text>Genting Casino Westcliff is a gambling establishment located on the Western Esplanade, Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, England, on the seafront overlooking the Thames estuary.

==History ==
The original &quot;Westcliff&quot; and &quot;Waterfront&quot; Casinos were established in the 1970s and it was originally at the Mill House in Station Road. It opened at its present site, formerly an open-air swimming pool as part of The Westcliff Leisure Centre that opened in 1975. It has developed into the largest provincial casino and the second largest in Britain. The casino was first run by Brent Walker, and then by &quot;R J Bown Holdings&quot;. It was bought by Genting UK for an estimated £30,000,000.

The casino features many slots and Electronic Roulette terminals and twenty table games (single zero American Roulette, Baccarat, Three Card Poker, Blackjack and Two Way Texas Hold&#x27;em Poker) as well as a 120 cover restaurant overlooking the Thames Estuary.

Only a small part of the entire building is used by the public. The building itself actually descends three floors down.

In November 2007, the two sister casinos, &quot;Spielers&#x27; Casino&quot; and &quot;Westcliff Casino&quot;, were refurbished by Genting Stanley to create the casinos named Southend Mint. Most recently in 2012, the casino underwent a multimillion-pound refurbishment and was renamed.

The first casino wedding in the United Kingdom took place at Southend. A player won £200,000 from the casino in 2010 taking him out of debt.

In November 2023, the casino had to close due to the discovery of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC), but work to rectify the problem was completed quickly and the casino re-opened two weeks later.

<text>USS &quot;Sawfish&quot; (SS-276), a , was a ship of the United States Navy named for the sawfish, a viviparous ray which has a long flat snout with a row of toothlike structures along each edge. It is found principally in the mouths of tropical American and African rivers.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sawfish&quot; was laid down on 20 January 1942 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine; launched on 23 June 1942; sponsored by Hattie Wyatt Caraway, the first woman to be elected to the United States Senate; and commissioned on 26 August 1942.

==Service history==
===World War II===
After shakedown off Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in Narragansett Bay, and en route to the Panama Canal, &quot;Sawfish&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 21 January 1943. Ten days later, she got underway for the first of her 10 war patrols.

==== First and second war patrols, January–June 1943 ====

&quot;Sawfish&quot; proceeded to waters off southwestern Japan where she attacked several targets and concluded that she had sunk or damaged some. However, it turned out that she had mistakenly sunk two neutral Soviet cargo ships on the Pacific Route, &quot;Kola&quot; on 16 February 1943 and &quot;Ilmen&quot; on 17 February. A careful study of Japanese and American records after the war did not confirm any other sinkings on &quot;Sawfish&quot;″s first war patrol, which ended when she reached Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands on 25 March 1943.

The submarine departed Midway on 15 April and headed for Japan. On 5 May off the coast of Honshū, she sank the converted gunboat, &quot;Hakkai Maru&quot;. A fortnight later, she stalked an enemy task force but lost her quarry in heavy swells. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 6 June.

==== Third war patrol, June–August 1943 ====

Underway again on the last day of the month, &quot;Sawfish&quot; set course for the East China Sea. On the night of 21 July, she attacked convoy Hi-3 of nine ships and concluded that she had scored several hits. However, postwar assessment of records was unable to confirm any kills during this attack or during her operations for the next five days.

Finally, early on the morning of 27 July, her luck changed when she attacked a convoy escorted by a 720-ton minelayer. Comdr. Sands fired a spread of four torpedoes from a range of only . He went deep as soon as the &quot;fish&quot; were clear and, in less than half a minute, the submarine was jolted by a violent explosion. Fearing that the detonation had been premature, Sands remained deep for over an hour. When he ascended to periscope depth, the convoy had escaped, but the escort, coastal minelayer, &quot;Hirashima&quot;, was sinking. &quot;Sawfish&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 August.

==== Fourth and fifth war patrols, September–December 1943 ====

During her fourth patrol, 10 September to 16 October, defective torpedoes frustrated the seven attacks which she made in the Sea of Japan before she returned to Midway. She got underway for the Bonins and her fifth patrol on 1 November. On 8 December, she sank 3,267-ton passenger-cargo ship, &quot;Sansei Maru&quot;, and returned to Midway on 19 December. She soon proceeded to Hunter&#x27;s Point Navy Yard, San Francisco, California, for overhaul.

==== Sixth and seventh war patrols, April–August 1944 ====

Back in top trim, the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor early in the spring. On 8 April 1944, she got underway for Japanese waters and her sixth war patrol. However, she only encountered two targets: a cargo ship which she attacked on 25 April and a second vessel which she sighted four days later—too fast and too far away for the submarine to attack. Although the submarine reported scoring two hits on the cargo ship, Japanese records contain no evidence of any sinking in the vicinity of the attack.

During her seventh war patrol, &quot;Sawfish&quot; joined and for wolfpack operations. The submarines sortied from Majuro on 22 June and headed for the Philippines. On 18 July, she damaged a tanker and, on 26 July, fired a spread of four torpedoes at surfaced Japanese submarine (one of only six Axis powers submarines to attempt trans-oceanic Yanagi missions), which exploded and sank. After a fruitless chase of a large Japanese convoy, the wolfpack ended the patrol at Pearl Harbor on 15 August.

==== Eighth war patrol, September–November 1944 ====

During &quot;Sawfish&quot;&#x27;s eighth war patrol, her commanding officer, Comdr. Alan B. Banister, led a wolfpack which included , and from time to time other submarines. The pack departed Pearl Harbor on 9 September and headed for waters south of Formosa where the submarines took a heavy toll on enemy shipping. &quot;Sawfish&quot;, herself, accounted for a 6,521-ton tanker, &quot;Tachibana Maru&quot;, on 9 October and a 6,838-ton seaplane tender, , on 23 October.

During the patrol, &quot;Sawfish&quot; also served on lifeguard station off Formosa in support of carrier raids. On 16 October, she rescued a pilot from VF-15 of ) who had survived four and one-half days at sea in a small rubber boat without food, water, or sunshade. The wolfpack returned to Majuro on 8 November.

==== Ninth and tenth war patrols, December 1944–April 1945 ====

&quot;Sawfish&quot; got underway on 17 December 1944 and returned to waters off Formosa where she spent her entire ninth war patrol on lifeguard station. She rescued a pilot on 21 January 1945 before heading toward Guam. She reached Apra Harbor on 4 February for refit.

&quot;Sawfish&quot; sailed on 10 March for her 10th and last war patrol, which she spent on lifeguard station off Nansei Shoto supporting air strikes preparing for and covering the conquest of Okinawa. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 April and soon proceeded to San Francisco for overhaul in the Bethlehem Steel Company yard there.

=== Post-World War II ===

&quot;Sawfish&quot; was heading toward Hawaii on 15 August 1945 when hostilities ended. She reached Pearl Harbor on 22 August but soon headed back to the west coast for duty as a training ship for the West Coast Fleet Sound School. She returned to Hawaii early in 1946 but was back at San Francisco on 22 March for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 26 June 1946 and remained in reserve at Mare Island Naval Shipyard until May 1947 when she proceeded to San Pedro for duty as a Naval Reserve training ship. On 1 April 1960, &quot;Sawfish&quot; was stricken from the Navy List and scrapped.

==Honors and awards==

<doc id="1103004" wikidata="Q233580" url="?curid=1103004" title="Al-Alaq">
<text>Al-ʻAlaq (, &quot;al-ʻalaq&quot;, also known as &quot;The Clinging Clot&quot; or &quot;The Embryo&quot;) is the 96th chapter (sūrah) of the Qur&#x27;an. It is composed of 19 &quot;āyāt&quot; or verses. It is sometimes also known as Sūrat Iqrā (, &quot;Read&quot;).

Chapter 96 of the Qur&#x27;an is traditionally believed to have been Muhammad&#x27;s first revelation. It is said that while Muhammad was on retreat in the Cave of Hira, at Jabal al-Nour near Mecca, the angel Gabriel appeared before him and commanded him to &quot;Read!&quot;. He responded, &quot;But I cannot read!&quot;. Then the angel Gabriel embraced him tightly and revealed to him the first lines, &quot;Read: In the name of your Lord Who created, (1) Created man from a clot. (2) Read: And your Lord is the Most Generous, (3) Who taught by the pen, (4) Taught man that which he knew not.&quot; (Bukhari 4953). It is traditionally understood the first five ayat or verses (1–5) of Surah Alaq were revealed; however, this is not the first fully complete Surah to be revealed and was actually revealed in 3 parts.

==Summary==

:1-5 Angel Gabriel commanding towards Muhammad to recite the first verses of the Qur&#x27;an. 
:6-14 Rebuke of Abu Jahl for hindering the Muslim cause.
:15 ۩ 19 Abu Jahl threatened with the torments of Hell as punishment.

===1-5 The first revelation ===

The first five verses of this sura are believed by some commentators to be the first verses of the Quran claimed to be related by Muhammad. He received them while on a retreat in a mountain cave at Hira, just outside the city of Mecca, in 610 CE. A few commentators disagree with this account, claiming that the first revelation was the beginning of surat al-Muddaththir or surat al-Fatiha, but theirs is a minority position. Moreover, the term إِنْسَان insān, which is translated &quot;man, human&quot;, appears 65 times in the Qur&#x27;an, meaning &quot;humanity&quot;.

=== 6–19 The morality and beliefs of mankind ===
The remainder of the surah, claimed to have been revealed later, questions the morality and beliefs of mankind, who &quot;thinks himself self-sufficient&quot;, unaware that all things will return to their Lord. Once man becomes self-satisfied, he has the tendency to transgress. These ayahs were revealed shortly after Muhammed started to pray publicly, as many people questioned his actions. The text continues, addressing the impiety of &quot;the man who forbids Our servant to pray&quot;. These later lines are thought to date from the time when Muhammad began to pray the salat in the Kaaba. Abu Jahl attempted to interrupt the prayer by trampling on Muhammad&#x27;s neck while he was prostrated. &quot;Does he not realize that God sees all?&quot;
The Qur&#x27;an commands Muhammad (and by inference all believers) to continue the prayer regardless, as those who persecute the faithful are unaware that God sees what they do. After the first 8 ayahs were revealed, Muhammed left the cave at Hira, and then surahs Ad-Duha, Nashra, and the second part of this surah were revealed after 6 months. 
More specifically, ayahs 9–14 were revealed when Muhammed first began praying publicly near the Kaaba because the Meccans didn&#x27;t comprehend what he was doing. These were directed towards people who tried to stop others from making devotions toward Allah. Once Abu Jahl (member of the Quraish) saw Muhammed praying publicly, he thought that Muhammed had adopted a new religion and tried to drive him away from the Kaaba. He gathered a crowd and asked: &quot;Is Muhammed setting his face on the ground in front of you (praying)?&quot; When they replied in affirmative he said: &quot;by the gods Al-Lat and Al-Uzza, if I ever catch him in that act of worship (salah), I will set my foot on his neck and rub his face in the dust.&quot; Abu Jahl wanted to follow through on his threat, but when he saw Muhammed he stepped forward, motioned to put his foot on his neck, but then became frightened and left. When asked about it later, he said that he had seen a vision of a ditch right in front of Muhammed, filled with fire and a ghoul with fiery wings. After Muhammed heard about the remark, he said: &quot;if he would have come near me, the angels would have struck him down and torn him into pieces.&quot;
Ayahs 15–19 say that when Abu Jahl saw Muhammed pray again near the Kaaba, and said &quot;Didn’t I tell you not to do this!&quot; Muhammad scolded him and said that he had the right to pray here, because he was a born citizen of Mecca. Abu Jahl said &quot;you dare to scold me! By God, with one call I can fill this valley with supporters!&quot; This passage was revealed: &quot;If (Abu Jahl) would have called upon his men, the angel of punishment would have seized him.&quot;

The translated words &#x27;bow down&#x27; in verse 19 comes from the word &#x27;Sujud&#x27; which refers to the position in Muslim prayer where the head, hands, knees, and toes are on the ground.

== The meaning of &#x27;alaq ==
The linguistic definition of &quot;ʻalaq&quot; (singular ʻalaqah ) is &quot;leech&quot;, &quot;medicinal leech&quot;, &quot;coagulated blood&quot;, &quot;blood clot&quot;, or &quot;the early stage of the embryo&quot;. &quot;ʻAlaq&quot; is also a derivative of &quot;ʻalaqa&quot; which means &quot;attached and hanging to something.&quot; Professor Abdul Haleem mentions that &quot;ʻalaq&quot; can also mean anything that clings: a clot of blood, a leech, even a lump of mud. All these meanings involve the basic idea of clinging or sticking.&quot;

The term &quot;ʻalaqah&quot; is the second stage of human prenatal development (sura Al-Mu’minoon 23:12–14) which &quot;descriptively encompasses the primary external and internal features&quot; of the early embryo. The term &quot;ʻalaqah&quot; also occurs in several languages related to Arabic. In Hebrew there is alûqāh (or alukah), the generic name for any blood-sucking worm or leech, and in Aramaic and Syriac there are words with apparently similar meanings.

== Hadith ==

The first and foremost exegesis/tafsir of the Qur&#x27;an is found in hadith of Muhammad. Although scholars including ibn Taymiyyah claim that Muhammad has commented on the whole of the Qur&#x27;an, others including Ghazali cite the limited amount of narratives, thus indicating that he has commented only on a portion of the Qur&#x27;an. Ḥadīth (حديث) is literally &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;report&quot;, that is a recorded saying or tradition of Muhammad validated by isnad; with Sirah Rasul Allah these comprise the sunnah and reveal shariah. According to Aishah, the life of Muhammad was the practical implementation of Qur&#x27;an. Therefore, higher count of hadith elevates the importance of the pertinent surah from a certain perspective. According to hadith, first 5 ayaat of this surah were first revelation of whole of the Quran.

* Narrated Yahya: I asked Aba Salama, &quot;Which Sura of the Qur&#x27;an was revealed first?&quot; He replied, &quot;O you, wrapped-up&#x27; (Al-Muddaththir).&quot; I said, &quot;I have been informed that it was, &#x27;Read, in the Name of your Lord who created (i.e. Surat Al-Alaq) 

* Abu Huraira reported: We performed prostration along with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (as he recited these verses: )&quot; When the heaven burst asunder&quot; (Al-Inshiqaq) and&quot; Read in the name of Thy Lord (Al-Alaq)&quot; 

1–3: These verses are talking about how God created human beings from Alaq (The Clot of blood or The Clinging Thing). After this verse was revealed, Muhammed responded by saying that he didn&#x27;t know how to read. After angel Jibraeel squeezed Muhammed&#x27;s chest a few times, and the 3rd verse was revealed, Muhammed read even though he did not know how to read or write.

4–5: These verse stress the importance of an education for a Muslim. As time goes on, things progress and advance, and everything comes from God. God opens peoples brains to new things, and this verse stresses the importance of furthering your education. This hadeeth in relation to this ayah was revealed which says: &quot;a person who reads is handsome in the eyes of God.&quot;

6–8: Even though God does so many things for us we still disobey him. Some people say that they do not need Allah. It does not matter because everyone will return to him on the Day of Judgement for reckoning.

9–10: In this verse &quot;the one who discourages&quot; references Abu Jahl when he tried to stop Muhammed from making devotions towards Allah, and anyone else for that matter.

11–14: These verses question whether the &quot;one who discourages&quot; is being &quot;guided&quot; or even &quot;concerned&quot; about God. They also emphasize that if someone is praying not to stop them because Allah is always watching.

15–19: These verse explain why the person who interrupts someone in prayer is said that they will be dragged from their &quot;lying, sinful, forelock.&quot; This phrase comes from Abu Jahl, who in the battle of Badr was killed by the hands of 2 child orphans of Medinah. His body was thrown into a well and they dragged him by his hair, which is specifically in reference to verse 15.

===Period of revelation===

This sura has two parts: the first consists of vv. 1–5, and the second of vv. 6–19. The majority of Islamic scholars agreed that the first part forms the first revelation to be sent down to Muhammad in 610. In this regard, the Hadith from Aisha, which Ibn Hanbal, Bukhari, Muslim and other traditionists have related with several chains of authorities, is one of the most authentic Hadith on the subject. In it Aisha narrates the full story of the beginning of revelation as she herself heard it from Muhammad. Besides, Ibn Abbas, Abu Musa al-Ashari and a group of the Companions also are reported to have stated that these were the very first verses of the Quran to be revealed to Muhammad.

The second part was revealed later, when Muhammad began to perform the prescribed prayer in the precincts of the Kaaba, and Abu Jahl tried to prevent him from this with threats.

<doc id="1103007" wikidata="Q60469" url="?curid=1103007" title="Angelus Silesius">
<text>Angelus Silesius, OFM (9 July 1677), born Johann Scheffler, was a German Catholic priest, physician, mystic and religious poet. Born and raised a Lutheran, he began to read the works of medieval mystics while studying in the Netherlands and became acquainted with the works of the German mystic Jacob Böhme through Böhme&#x27;s friend Abraham von Franckenberg. Silesius&#x27;s display of his mystic beliefs caused tension with Lutheran authorities and led to his eventual conversion to Catholicism in 1653, wherein he adopted the name &quot;Angelus&quot; (Latin for &quot;angel&quot; or &quot;heavenly messenger&quot;) and the epithet &quot;Silesius&quot; (&quot;Silesian&quot;). He entered the Franciscans and was ordained a priest in 1661. Ten years later, in 1671, he retired to a Jesuit house where he remained for the rest of his life.

An enthusiastic convert and priest, Silesius worked to convince German Protestants in Silesia to return to the Catholic Church. He composed 55 tracts and pamphlets condemning Protestantism, several of which were published in two folio volumes entitled &quot;Ecclesiologia&quot; (i.e., Ecclesiology). However, he is now remembered chiefly for his mystical poetry, and in particular for two poetical works, both published in 1657: &quot;Heilige Seelen-Lust&quot; (&quot;The Soul&#x27;s Holy Desires&quot;), a collection of more than 200 religious hymn texts that have since been used by both Catholics and Protestants; and &quot;Cherubinischer Wandersmann&quot; (&quot;The Cherubic Pilgrim&quot;), a collection of 1,676 short poems, mostly in Alexandrine couplets. His poetry explores contemporary themes of the greatness of God, mystic interpretations of the Trinity, quietist practices, and pantheism within an orthodox Catholic context.

==Life==
===Early life and education===
While his exact birthdate is unknown, it is believed that Silesius was born in December 1624 in Breslau, the capital of Silesia. The earliest mention of him is the registration of his baptism on Christmas Day, 25 December 1624. At the time, Silesia was a province of the Habsburg Empire. Today, it is the southwestern region of Poland. Baptized Johann Scheffler, he was the first of three children. His parents, who married in February 1624, were Lutheran Protestants. His father, Stanislaus Scheffler (–1637), was of Polish ancestry and was a member of the lower nobility. Stanislaus dedicated his life to the military, was made Lord of Borowice (or Vorwicze) and received a knighthood from King Sigismund III. A few years before his son&#x27;s birth, he had retired from military service in Kraków. In 1624, he was 62. The child&#x27;s mother, Maria Hennemann (–1639), was a 24-year-old daughter of a local physician with ties to the Habsburg Imperial court.

Scheffler obtained his early education at the Elisabethsgymnasium (Saint Elizabeth&#x27;s Gymnasium, or high school) in Breslau. His earliest poems were written and published during these formative years. Scheffler was probably influenced by the recently published works of the poet and scholar Martin Opitz and by one of his teachers, the poet Christoph Köler.

He subsequently studied medicine and science at the University of Strasbourg (or &quot;Strassburg&quot;) in Alsace for a year in 1643. It was then a Lutheran university with a course of study that embraced Renaissance humanism. From 1644 to 1647, he attended Leiden University. At this time, he was introduced to the writings of Jacob Böhme (1575–1624) and became acquainted with one of Böhme&#x27;s friends, Abraham von Franckenberg (1593–1652), who probably introduced him to ancient Kabbalist writings, alchemy, and hermeticism, and to mystic writers living in Amsterdam. Franckenberg had been compiling a complete edition of Böhme&#x27;s work at the time Scheffler resided in the Netherlands. The Dutch Republic provided refuge to many religious sects, mystics, and scholars who were persecuted elsewhere in Europe. Scheffler then went to Italy and enrolled in studies at the University of Padua in Padua in September 1647. A year later, he received a doctoral degree in philosophy and medicine and returned to his homeland.

===Physician===
On 3 November 1649, Scheffler was appointed to be the court physician to Silvius I Nimrod, Duke of Württemberg-Oels (1622–1664) and was given an annual salary of 175 thalers. Although he was &quot;recommended to the Duke on account of his good qualities and his experience in medicine,&quot; it is likely that Scheffler&#x27;s friend and mentor, Abraham von Franckenberg, had arranged the appointment given his closeness to the Duke. Franckenberg was the son of a minor noble from the village of Ludwigsdorf near Oels within the duchy. Franckenberg returned to the region the year before. It is also possible that Scheffler&#x27;s brother-in-law, Tobias Brückner, who was also a physician to the Duke of Württemberg-Oels, may have recommended him. Scheffler soon was not happy in his position as his personal mysticism and critical views on Lutheran doctrine (especially his disagreements with the Augsburg Confession) caused friction with the Duke and members of the ducal court. The Duke was characterized in history as being &quot;a zealous Lutheran and very bigoted.&quot; Coincidentally, it was at this time that Scheffler began to have mystical visions, which along with his public pronouncements led local Lutheran clergy to consider him a heretic. After Franckenberg&#x27;s death in June 1652, Scheffler resigned his position—he may have been forced to resign—and sought refuge under the protection of the Roman Catholic Church.

===Priest and poet===
The Lutheran authorities in the Reformed states of the Empire were not tolerant of Scheffler&#x27;s increasing mysticism, and he was publicly attacked and denounced as a heretic. At this time, the Habsburg rulers (who were Catholic) were pushing for a Counter Reformation and advocated a re-Catholicisation of Europe. Scheffler sought to convert to Catholicism and was received by the Church of Saint Matthias in Breslau on 12 June 1653. Upon being received, he took the name &quot;Angelus&quot;, the Latin form of &quot;angel&quot;, derived from the Greek &quot;ángelos&quot; (, &quot;messenger&quot;); for his epithet, he took &quot;Silesius&quot; (Latin for &quot;Silesian&quot;). It is uncertain why he took this name, but he may have added it in honour of his native Silesia or to honour a favourite scholastic, mystic or theosophic author, to distinguish himself from other famous writers of his era: perhaps the Spanish mystic writer Juan de los Ángeles (author of &quot;The Triumph of Love&quot;) or Lutheran theologian Johann Angelus in Darmstadt. He no longer used the name Scheffler, but did on occasion use his first name, Johann. From 1653 until his death, he used the names &quot;Angelus Silesius&quot; and also &quot;Johann Angelus Silesius&quot;.

Shortly after his conversion, on 24 March 1654, Silesius received an appointment as Imperial Court Physician to Ferdinand III, the Holy Roman Emperor. However, this was probably an honorary position to offer some official protection against Lutheran attackers, as Silesius never went to Vienna to serve the Imperial Court. It is very likely that he never practiced medicine after his conversion to Catholicism.

In the late 1650s, he sought permission (a nihil obstat or imprimatur) from Catholic authorities in Vienna and Breslau to begin publishing his poetry. He had begun writing poetry at an early age, publishing a few occasional pieces when a schoolboy in 1641 and 1642. He attempted to publish poetry while working for the Duke of Württemberg-Oels, but was refused permission by the Duke&#x27;s orthodox Lutheran court clergyman, Christoph Freitag. However, in 1657, after obtaining the approval of the Catholic Church, two collections of his poems were published—the works for which he is known—&quot;Heilige Seelen-Lust&quot; (&quot;The Soul&#x27;s Holy Desire&quot;) and &quot;Der Cherubinische Wandersmann&quot; (&quot;The Cherubinic Pilgrim&quot;).

On 27 February 1661, Silesius took holy orders as a Franciscan. Three months later, he was ordained a priest in the Silesian Duchy of Neisse—an area of successful re-Catholicisation and one of two ecclesiastical states within the region (that is, ruled by a Prince-Bishop). When his friend Sebastian von Rostock (1607–1671) became Prince-Bishop of Breslau, Silesius was appointed his &quot;Rath und Hofmarschall&quot; (a counselor and Chamberlain). During this time, he began publishing over fifty tracts attacking Lutheranism and the Protestant Reformation. Thirty-nine of these essays he later compiled into a two-volume folio collection entitled &quot;Ecclesiologia&quot; (1676).

===Death===
After the death of the Prince-Bishop of Breslau in 1671, Silesius retired to the &quot;Hospice of the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star&quot; (the &quot;Matthiasstift&quot;), a Jesuit house associated with the church of Saint Matthias at Breslau. He died on 9 July 1677 and was buried there. Some sources claim he died from tuberculosis (&quot;consumption&quot;), others describe his illness as a &quot;wasting sickness.&quot; Immediately after news of his death spread, several of his Protestant detractors spread the untrue rumour that Silesius had hanged himself. By his Will, he distributed his fortune, largely inherited from his father&#x27;s noble estate, to pious and charitable institutions, including orphanages.

==Importance==
===Interpretation of his work===
The poetry of Angelus Silesius consists largely of epigrams in the form of alexandrine couplets—the style that dominated German poetry and mystical literature during the Baroque era. According to Baker, the epigram was key to conveying mysticism, because &quot;the epigram with its tendency towards brevity and pointedness is a suitable genre to cope with the aesthetic problem of the ineffability of the mystical experience.&quot; The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition identifies these epigrams as &quot;Reimsprüche&quot;—or rhymed distichs—and describes them as:

Silesius&#x27;s poetry directs the reader to seek a path toward a desired spiritual state, an eternal stillness, by eschewing material or physical needs and the human will. It requires an understanding of God that is informed by the ideas of apophatic theology and of antithesis and paradox. Some of Silesius&#x27;s writings and beliefs that bordered on pantheism or panentheism caused tensions between Silesius and local Protestant authorities. However, in the introduction to &quot;Cherubinischer Wandersmann&quot;, he explained his poetry (especially its paradoxes) within the framework of Catholic orthodoxy and denied pantheism which would have run afoul of Catholic doctrine.

His mysticism is informed by the influences of Böhme and Franckenberg as well as of prominent writers Meister Eckhart (1260–1327), Johannes Tauler (–1361), Heinrich Suso (–1366), and Jan van Ruysbroeck (1293/4–1381). Critic and literary theorist Georg Ellinger surmised in his study of Silesius that his poetry was influenced by loneliness (especially due to the death of his parents and becoming an orphan early in life), ungoverned impulsivity, and lack of personal fulfillment, rendering much of his poetry confessional and exhibiting internal psychological conflict.

===Use in hymns===
Several of the poems of Silesius have been used or adapted as hymns used in Protestant and Catholic services. In many early Lutheran and Protestant hymnals, these lyrics were attributed to &quot;anonymous&quot;, rather than admit they were penned by the Catholic Silesius, known for his criticism and advocacy against Protestantism. In many instances, the verse of Silesius is attributed in print to &quot;anonymous&quot; or to &quot;I.A.&quot; While I.A. were the Latin initials for &quot;Iohannis Angelus&quot; they were often misinterpreted as &quot;Incerti auctoris&quot;, meaning &quot;unknown author&quot;. Likewise, several truly anonymous works were later misattributed to Silesius, thanks to the same ambiguous initials. Verses by Silesius appear in the lyrics of hymns published in &quot;Nürnberg Gesang-Buch&quot; (1676), Freylinghausen&#x27;s &quot;Gesang-Buch&quot; (1704), Porst&#x27;s &quot;Gesang-Buch&quot; (1713); and Burg&#x27;s &quot;Gesang-Buch&quot; (1746). Seventy-nine hymns using his verses were included in Nicolaus Zinzendorf&#x27;s &quot;Christ-Catholisches Singe und Bet-Büchlein&quot; (1727). During the 18th Century, they were frequently in use in the Lutheran, Catholic, and Moravian Churches. Many of these hymns are still popular in Christian churches today.

==In popular culture==

*In 1934, Hugo Distler based 14 motets of his &quot;Totentanz&quot; on texts from &quot;The Cherubinic Pilgrim&quot;.
*In a series of lectures entitled &quot;Siete Noches&quot; (&quot;Seven Nights&quot;) (1980), Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges (1899–1986) remarks that the essence of poetry can be encapsulated in a single line from Silesius. Borges wrote:

I will end with a great line by the poet who, in the seventeenth century, took the strangely real and poetic name of Angelus Silesius. It is the summary of all I have said tonight — except that I have said it by means of reasoning and simulated reasoning. I will say it first in Spanish and then in German:
: La rosa es sin porqué; florece porque florece.
: Die Rose ist ohne warum; sie blühet weil sie blühet.

The line he quoted, &quot;Die Rose ist ohne warum; sie blühet, weil sie blühet...&quot; from Silesius&#x27;s &quot;The Cherubinic Pilgrim&quot; (1657), can be translated as: &quot;The Rose is without a &#x27;wherefor&#x27;—she blooms because she blooms.&quot; The influence of mysticism is seen in the work of Borges, especially in his poetry, which frequently references Silesius and his work.
*This same line was often referenced in the work of Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) who (building on the work of Leibniz and Hegel) explored mysticism in many of his works, in which he defines a theory of truth as phenomenal and defying any rational explanation. Heidegger was commenting on the rational philosophy of German philosopher and mathematician Leibniz (1646–1716)—a contemporary of Silesius—who called the mystic&#x27;s poetry &quot;beautiful&quot;, but &quot;extraordinarily daring, full of difficult metaphors and inclined almost to godlessness&quot; despite Silesius&#x27;s mysticism being contrary to Leibniz&#x27;s &quot;principium reddendae rationis sufficientis&quot;, the Principle of sufficient reason.
*In the 1991 American film &quot;Cape Fear&quot; directed by Martin Scorsese, the film&#x27;s sadistic antagonist, Max Cady (played by Robert De Niro) quotes a verse of Silesius. The verse is:
However, the context of this line in the film contradicts the meaning intended by Angelus Silesius. Max Cady has a God complex and quotes Silesius&#x27; poem to emphasize to his intended victims both the power of his individual will and his god-like ability to exact a violent vengeance. The context intended by Silesius was of man&#x27;s realization through his spiritual potential for perfection that he was of the same substance with God in the sense of the mystical divine union or theosis—that experience of direct communion of love between the believer and God as equals.

<text>The 1950 British Grand Prix, formally known as The Royal Automobile Club Grand Prix d&#x27;Europe Incorporating The British Grand Prix, was a Formula One motor race held on 13 May 1950 at the Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone, England. It was the first World Championship Formula One race, as well as the fifth British Grand Prix, and the third to be held at Silverstone after motor racing resumed after World War II. It was the first race of seven in the 1950 World Championship of Drivers.

The 70-lap race was won by Nino Farina for the Alfa Romeo team, after starting from pole position, with a race time of 2:13:23.6 and an average speed of 146.378 km/h (90.955 mph). Luigi Fagioli finished second in another Alfa Romeo, and Reg Parnell third in a third Alfa Romeo.

The race followed the non-championship Pau Grand Prix and San Remo Grand Prix (both won by Juan Manuel Fangio), the Richmond Trophy (won by Reg Parnell), and the Paris Grand Prix (won by Georges Grignard).

==Background==
=== Early Formula One racing ===

In 1946, the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&#x27;s Commission Sportive Internationale first defined the &quot;International Formula&quot;, a premier single-seater racing series to start in 1947. While the first Formula One race was the 1947 Pau Grand Prix, the 1950 British Grand Prix was the first Grand Prix of the new World Championship of Drivers.

Four non-championship races were held all across Europe in 1950 prior to the Grand Prix: Juan Manuel Fangio won the races in Pau and San Remo, Reg Parnell won in Douglas, and Georges Grignard won in Paris.

=== The First World Championship race ===
The 1950 edition of the British Grand Prix was fifth held since 1926 and the third held at Silverstone Circuit since its first time in 1948. It was also the designated European Grand Prix for the year, making it the 11th time the circuit has held the title since the first race in 1923.

The race was also supported by an international 500cc Formula Three race the same weekend, which was won by Stirling Moss driving a Cooper-JAP. There was also a demonstration run for the BRM P15, which was due to enter the sport later in the year. The race was attended by George VI, Queen Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, and the Earl &amp; Countess Mountbatten of Burma.

===Entries===


24 drivers were entered for the first race with them competing in 22 different cars. The numbers 7 and 13 were not assigned. The biggest absence was the Scuderia Ferrari who would not compete in the opening race with Enzo Ferrari not sending any cars to Britain with the team debuting at the next round in Monaco, due to the small amount of appearance money the organisers were willing to pay him to participate.

This meant that Alfa Romeo were favourites with their four drivers Farina, Fangio, Fagioli, and British driver, Reg Parnell, while their main competition came from the Maseratis of the Scuderia Ambrosiana and Enrico Platé teams. Felice Bonetto also entered a Maserati but would not arrive for the race.

Talbot-Lago sent over two factory cars in the traditional French pale blue colour to be driven by Yves Giraud-Cabantous and Eugène Martin. Other private Talbots were entered by Louis Rosier, Philippe Etancelin, and Belgian Johnny Claes in a car painted in Belgium&#x27;s national yellow colour. The rest of the field was made up of local machinery, which included four ERAs and two Altas in British racing green.

: – Luigi Fagioli qualified and drove all 70 laps of the race in the #3 Alfa Romeo. Gianbattista Guidotti, named substitute driver for the car, was not used at the Grand Prix.
: – Peter Walker qualified and drove 2 laps of the race in the #9 ERA. Tony Rolt took over the car for 3 laps of the race.
: – Joe Fry qualified and drove 45 laps of the race in the #10 Maserati. Brian Shawe-Taylor took over the car for 19 laps of the race.
: – Entry cancelled prior to the event.

==Qualifying==
Qualifying took place on Friday and saw the Alfa Romeos end up on the front row of the grid as Farina claimed the first pole position in the history of Formula One with a time of 1:50.8. Fagioli and Fangio and Parnell would fill the remaining spots on the front row of the grid. Prince Bira was the fastest non-Alfa, 1.8 seconds back with the two Talbot&#x27;s cars filling in the second row.

===Qualifying classification===
==Race==
On 13 May, 21 drivers from 9 countries were represented at the old Silverstone airport, 4 from France, 2 from Italy, 1 each from Belgium, Ireland, Monaco, Argentina, Thailand and Switzerland. The UK was represented by 9 drivers. The race drew 200,000 spectators. At the start of the race, Farina took the lead with Fagioli and Fangio in pursuit, while Cabantous got a poor start and lost 4 positions. In the early laps, they switched around between themselves several times to keep everyone amused. Fangio retired with engine troubles caused by a broken oil pipe and so Farina led Fagioli home by 2.5 seconds with Parnell a distant third, despite hitting a hare during the race. The nearest challenger was Giraud-Cabantous two laps down, with Bira having retired with a fuel problem. Crossley and Murray duelled at the back before retiring, de Graffenried had done so on lap 34, while Chiron was demoted to the role of the viewer 10 laps earlier.

Nino Farina led for 63 laps (1–9, 16–37 and 39–70). Luigi Fagioli led for 6 laps (10–15). Juan Manuel Fangio led for 1 lap (38).

Nino Farina achieved the fastest lap of the race, with a 1:50.6 on Lap 2.

===Shared drives===
Joe Fry drove car #10 for the first 45 laps, then Brian Shawe-Taylor took over for 19 laps for a total of 64 laps, a distance of 297.536 km.

Peter Walker drove car #9 for 2 laps, then Tony Rolt drove for an additional 3 laps, totaling 5 laps, a distance of 23.245 km.

White Wolf wanted an expert in the legal and mechanical issues involved with the d20 trademark license, so they asked Necromancer Games to help form the &quot;Sword &amp; Sorcery&quot; imprint, to publish both the books of Sword &amp; Sorcery Studio and those of Necromancer Games. This partnership was announced on September 13, 2000.

When this partnership was announced, White Wolf also stated that Sword &amp; Sorcery Studio was involved as a third partner was involved, although it was actually just the White Wolf d20 content division, but did give its name to the Sword &amp; Sorcery d20 imprint. White Wolf produced the first book for Sword &amp; Sorcery, the &quot;Creature Collection&quot; (2000) monster book which was assembled by Clark Peterson and Bill Webb of Necromancer Games, and written by White Wolf staffers.

<text>Hindu Love Gods is the only album by American band Hindu Love Gods, which was released in 1990. The album was recorded around the same time as Warren Zevon&#x27;s album &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot;, for which Zevon had enlisted Bill Berry, Peter Buck and Mike Mills of R.E.M. as players. The musicians also recorded this set of songs, mainly cover versions of old blues tunes, reputedly during late-night drunken recording sessions, not originally intending them for release. According to Zevon and Mills, Zevon&#x27;s manager made the decision to publish the album without consulting the musicians, creating a public rift between Zevon and the musicians.

<doc id="1103041" wikidata="Q6941743" url="?curid=1103041" title="Music examination">
<text>Music examinations are a method of formally assessing the accomplishments of pupils learning musical instruments. 

Trinity College London was the first organization to offer examinations in music to external students in 1877. Trinity College London conducts around 850,000 assessments per year worldwide. The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music conducts around 650,000 assessments per year in 93 countries.

==Eligibility==

Many students who enter the music exams have taken a course of music lessons with a private tutor, although some are self-taught. Often this is a way for children to receive music training over and above what is provided at their usual place of learning, although private lessons are also popular with adults who turn to music later in life. 

Although there are music examinations available to school and university students alongside other regular qualifications and assessments, there are also a number of independent bodies who solely provide assessments which are open to all.

==Content and structure==

Music exams are set in both theory and practical aspects. The theory examinations are taken by pupils of all instruments and typically cover areas such as musical notation, harmony and composition. The practical exams concentrate on a particular instrument (i.e., piano, guitar, flute) and style of music (i.e., classical, jazz, popular). They cover elements such as playing set pieces, technical work including scales, sight reading, aural, musical knowledge and improvisation.

In the United Kingdom, graded music exams are offered at grades 1 to 8, with Grade 1 being the entry level, and Grade 8 being the standard required for entry to higher study in a music college. Some exam boards offer additional levels, before Grade 1 and/or after Grade 8. Different music exam boards may have different grade levels for instruments and music theory. 

There are also music exams which do not follow the graded system, but have other designations. For instance, the Royal School of Church Music&#x27;s Voice for Life training scheme designates levels by color (White, Light Blue, Dark Blue, Red, Silver, Gold) and awards by metal (Bronze Award, Silver Award, Gold Award).

==Recognition==

Some qualifications are recognised by regulatory bodies, such as Ofqual, whereas others are not. 

Some qualifications are recognised, in the admissions process for colleges and universities, as demonstrating the musical ability of the student. The UCAS Tariff awards points for certain graded music exams.

Examination results or credits may or may not be transferable from one exam board to the other.

==Examination boards==

Reputable music examination boards include: 
* ANZCA Music Examinations
* Associated Boards of the Royal Schools of Music
* Australian Guild of Music 
* Australian Music Examinations Board
* London College of Music
* Music Teachers&#x27; Board 
* Music Teachers National Association
* Music Teachers&#x27; Association of California
* New Zealand Music Examinations Board
* Rockschool Awards
* The Royal Conservatory of Music 
* Royal Irish Academy of Music 
* Royal School of Church Music
* St. Cecilia School of Music 
* Trinity College London
* University of South Africa - Directorate Music
* Victoria College of Music and Drama 

These examination boards offer exams in music theory as well as in musical performance.

<doc id="1103042" wikidata="Q662290" url="?curid=1103042" title="Claude de Forbin">
<text>Claude, comte de Forbin-Gardanne (6 August 1656 – 4 March 1733) was a French Navy officer, nobleman and diplomat. From 1685 to 1688, he led a diplomatic mission to the Ayutthaya Kingdom. He became governor of Bangkok and a general in the Siamese army, and left Siam shortly before King Narai fell ill and was deposed by the 1688 coup d&#x27;état. Returning to Europe, he got involved in the Nine Years&#x27; War and the War of the Spanish Succession. 

==Biography==
Claude de Forbin was born in the village Gardanne in the Provence, as a member of a family established in Marseille in the 14th century. Later divided into several branches, Claude de Forbin was the most famous of the branch Forbin Gardanne.

High-spirited and ungovernable in his boyhood, he ran away from his home, and through the influence of an uncle entered the navy, serving his first campaign in 1675. For a short time he quit the navy and entered the musketeers. There, he killed the chevalier de Gourdon in a duel, and was sentenced to death by the Parliament of Aix; he managed to obtain a grace and joined the Navy under his brother&#x27;s identity.

He served under the Count d&#x27;Estrées during the American campaign, and under Duquesne that of Algiers in 1683, on all occasions distinguishing himself by his impetuous courage.

===Grand Admiral of Siam===

The most remarkable episode of his life was his mission to Siam. During the administration of the Greek adventurer Phaulcon in that country, the project was formed of introducing the Christian religion and European civilisation, and the king sent an embassy to Louis XIV. In response a French embassy was sent out, Forbin accompanying the Chevalier de Chaumont with the rank of major aboard the &quot;Oiseau&quot;. When Chaumont returned to France, Forbin was induced to remain in the service of the Siamese king, and accepted, though with much reluctance, the posts of grand admiral, general of all the king&#x27;s armies and governor of Bangkok. During his tenure he crushed the Makassar Revolt at Bangkok, although almost at the cost of his own life.

His position, however, was soon made untenable by the jealousy and intrigues of the minister Phaulcon; and at the end of two years he left Siam, reaching France in 1688. He was replaced as Governor of Bangkok by the Chevalier de Beauregard.

===War with England===
Claude de Forbin was afterwards fully engaged in active service, first with Jean Bart in the war with England, when they escorted a convoy; attacked by superior forces, Forbin, aboard the &quot;Jeux&quot;, and Jean Bart, aboard the &quot;Railleuse&quot;, sacrificed themselves in a delaying action to allow the convoy the escape. They were both captured and taken to Plymouth. They succeeded in making their escape after 11 days, crossed the Channel on a small craft, and were soon serving their country again.

Made a &quot;capitaine de vaisseau&quot; in June 1689, he commanded the &quot;Neptune&quot; in the Battle of Beachy Head (1690). After a campaign in the North Sea in 1691, he commanded the &quot;Perle&quot; in Barfleur, where he was wounded. He greatly distinguished himself at the battle of Lagos in 1693. Commanding the &quot;Marquis&quot; in 1695, he campaigned in the Mediterranean and Constantinople. In 1697, he served in Catalonia in the siege of Barcelona.

During the War of the Spanish Succession, he led a three-ship of the line division in the Adriatic, where he blockaded Venice, bombed Trieste and ransomed Fiume. In 1703 and 1704, he hunted down the privateers from Vlissingen.

In June 1706, he attacked a British convoy, capturing seven ships; on 12 July, he seized two Dutch ships, and on 28 October, engaging a strongly escorted Dutch convoy, he captured three ships and sank another one.

In 1707, he was made a &quot;Chef d&#x27;Escadre&quot; (Rear-Admiral). On 12 May he captured a British convoy of 18 ships en route for Portugal. In the summer he led the &quot;Mars&quot; and a division into the White Sea, returning to Brest on 23 September with 34 captured ships.
On 21 October in the Battle at the Lizard, he helped Duguay-Trouin in attacking a British convoy set for Portugal: of 80 ships, 15 merchantman and three ships of the line were captured, and 1 other was sunk.

In 1708, he led Prince James Francis Edward Stuart to Scotland, in an attempt to reclaim the British throne; ill-prepared, the attempt failed, and Forbin ceased to navigate. He quit the Navy in January 1715, and died on 4 March 1733 in Saint-Marcel Castle near Marseille.

His &quot;Memories&quot; were published in 1730, written by his secretary.

<text>Ilford North is a constituency in Greater London that was created in 1945. The seat has been represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom by Wes Streeting of the Labour Party since 2015. Streeting currently serves as Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in the government of Keir Starmer.

==History==
The seat was created for the 1945 general election, from the northern part of the former Ilford seat.

==Constituency profile==
Incomes and house prices are above average for the UK.
All districts are suburban but interspersed with many parks and a few small nature reserves and are connected to Central London by the Central line which forms an end loop around Hainault tube station. Most residents live in terraced or semi-detached houses with small and narrow gardens. As at the 2011 census, mid-rise apartments in modest landscaped grounds form the bulk of the type of flats in the seat as opposed to tower blocks.

==Political history==
The seat has fluctuated since 1945 between Labour and Conservative representation in the House of Commons. The 2015 result made the seat the 8th narrowest win of Labour&#x27;s 232 seats by percentage of majority, and in first past the post a 1.2% majority would be considered marginal. The 2017 election saw an 8.5% swing to Labour, increasing their margin in the seat to 9,639 votes (18.2%), the largest majority for a Labour MP in the seat&#x27;s history. Labour&#x27;s majority was almost halved during the 2019 general election.

In 2024, Ilford North became the focus of press attention as independent candidate Leanne Mohamad sought to oust incumbent Wes Streeting. One of several independents running primarily on the issue of the Israel–Hamas war, Whilst Mohamad ended up not winning the seat, she reduced Streeting&#x27;s majority from 5,198 (10.4%) to 528 (1.2%), making it one of the country&#x27;s most marginal constituencies.

==Boundaries==

1945–1950: The Municipal Borough of Ilford wards of Barkingside, North Hainault, Seven Kings, and South Hainault.

1950–1974: The Municipal Borough of Ilford wards of Barkingside, Clayhall, Fairlop, North Hainault, Seven Kings, and South Hainault.

1974–1983: The London Borough of Redbridge wards of Aldborough, Barkingside, Chadwell, Fairlop, Hainault, and Seven Kings.

1983–1997: As above plus Fullwell

1997–2024: The London Borough of Redbridge wards of Aldborough, Barkingside, Bridge, Clayhall, Fairlop, Fullwell, Hainault, and Roding.

2024–present: The London Borough of Redbridge wards of Aldborough, Barkingside, Clayhall, Cranbrook, Fairlop, Fullwell, Hainault, and Valentines.
:&quot;The Bridge ward and the part of Churchfields ward were transferred to Chingford and Woodford Green, with the part of South Woodford ward going to Leyton and Wanstead. To compensate, the Cranbrook and Valentines wards were transferred from Ilford South.&quot;

<doc id="1103051" wikidata="Q5589562" url="?curid=1103051" title="Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge">
<text>The Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial/Senator Thomas &quot;Mac&quot; Middleton Bridge, also known as the Potomac River Bridge, is a , four-lane continuous truss bridge that spans the Potomac River between Newburg in Charles County, Maryland and Dahlgren in King George County, Virginia, United States. It is one of eight toll facilities operated by the Maryland Transportation Authority, and is one of two toll bridges over the Potomac River. The other, the privately owned Oldtown Low Water Toll Bridge, connects Maryland and West Virginia, far upstream. The new Nice Bridge opened to traffic in October 2022. Demolition of the original bridge began on March 21, 2023.

==Overview==
This two lane bridge carries U.S. Route 301, which is a spur of U.S. Route 1 and a popular north–south alternative for bypassing the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and its frequently congested roads such as Interstate 95, Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway), and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge to the north along the Potomac River. 
In 2014, the bridge handled approximately 6.4 million vehicles, with a daily average of approximately 17,500.

===Congestion===
Since the late 2000s, the bridge was known to experience significant traffic congestion due to its design, combined with increasing traffic from Southern Maryland, particularly as it peaks on holidays and weekends. The bridge is narrow (one lane in each direction with no shoulders), steep (up to 3.75 percent grade), and has a reduced speed limit ( on the main span, even slower through the southbound toll gates and plaza). By contrast, the approach roads on both sides of the bridge feature four lanes (2 in each direction), full shoulders, and speed limits. This combination forces vehicles to slow and merge as they cross the bridge, which often results in backups.

In response to the bridge&#x27;s traffic issues, the Maryland Transportation Authority initiated the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge Improvement Project in June 2006, which would contemplate improvement of bridge traffic either by widening the bridge or by replacing it altogether. Planning continued for another year, and by the end of 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that six alternatives had been identified. Ultimately, the decision was made to replace the bridge altogether five years later with a wider one with two lanes per direction.

==History==

President Franklin D. Roosevelt presided over the ground-breaking ceremony for the bridge in 1938. Known as the Potomac River Bridge when opened in December 1940, the bridge was renamed in 1967 for Harry W. Nice (1877–1941) who served as governor of Maryland from 1935 to 1939.
The bridge was the first south of Washington, D.C. to provide a highway link between Maryland and Virginia. In October 2018, the name of retiring state Senator Thomas M. Middleton was added to the bridge, making it officially the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial/Senator Thomas &quot;Mac&quot; Middleton Bridge.

In March 2020, all-electronic tolling was implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with tolls payable through E-ZPass or Video Tolling, which uses automatic license plate recognition. All-electronic tolling was made permanent in August 2020.

===Construction of replacement bridge===
In December 2012, it was reported that the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA) completed a study of the Nice Bridge and received approval from the federal government to replace the current structure with a span with four lanes and a bike/pedestrian path, to be located just north of the existing bridge, which will be removed upon completion of the replacement crossing. The MDTA estimated the cost of a replacement span at about $850 million, but funding was not identified as of 2012.
The project is being coordinated with the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), and is proceeding in conjunction with the Maryland State Highway Administration&#x27;s U.S. Route 301 South Corridor Transportation Study
and the U.S. Route 301 Waldorf Area Transportation Improvements Project.

On November 21, 2013, Governor Martin O’Malley announced that the MDTA Board has approved an additional $50 million in its final six-year capital program (FY 2014 – FY 2019) to fund initial design and right-of-way acquisition for the project to replace the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge (US 301), which connects Charles County, Maryland and King George County, Virginia, across the Potomac River. The planning phase of the project was completed in fall 2012. The selected alternative consists of a new four-lane bridge built parallel to, and north of, the existing bridge, which would be removed upon completion of the new bridge. Opposition to a new bridge from Governor Larry Hogan had prevented construction from being scheduled. 

However, on November 21, 2016, the Maryland Transportation Authority Board voted unanimously to build a new, 4-lane bridge just north of the current structure. Construction began in July 2020. A ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new bridge was held on October 12, 2022, with Governor Hogan in attendance, while the bridge opened to traffic the following day. The approved bridge design has several design alterations which shave more than $200 million from the originally projected price of around $1 billion, allowing Governor Hogan to shift his support in favor of the bridge. One of the major redesign choices was the removal of the multi-use path for pedestrians and bicycles, citing low projected usage; in its stead, Will Pines, chief engineer of the MDTA, states that the bridge will be open for cyclists to share the lane with motor vehicles, similar to the present arrangement on the Thomas J. Hatem Bridge on US 40. Demolition of the old bridge began on March 21, 2023. Materials from the demolition will be used to create an artificial reef that can provide new shelter for marine life in the river.

====Bike lane exclusion and old bridge demolition controversies====
Former Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives Steny Hoyer, along with US Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, objected to plans to demolish the old bridge following the new one&#x27;s completion, suggesting an independent study be conducted to explore the possibility that the old bridge itself could be used for recreational and bike traffic, but Transportation Secretary Jim Ports countered by contending that financial and logistical challenges were too great to keep the old bridge in place. However, bicycle advocacy groups, which include Potomac Heritage Trail Association, Dahlgren Railroad Heritage Association and Oxon Hill Bicycle and Trail Club, allege in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, that state agencies, including the MDTA, violated state and federal environmental review laws by changing the project from its original conception and failing to study the impact of demolishing the bridge. The groups, who are asking for a temporary restraining order, to halt the demolition, also allege that the authority lacks the power to destroy the bridge under environmental laws, stating in a complaint, &quot;Using explosives to demolish parts of the Historic Nice Bridge or the rubble from the bridge to create a &#x27;reef&#x27; has not been evaluated appropriately for the impact on the natural habitat and human environment, including the taking of endangered species or disruption of their habitats.&quot;

The plaintiffs also allege that the defendants never considered the “cumulative effects” of the construction plan and the potential demolition of the old bridge on human, environmental and historic resources, as well as on publicly or privately owned landmark sites listed or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. The future of the old bridge fell to U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman, who declined to issue an injunction blocking the demolition Tuesday, October 11, 2022, saying after a three-hour hearing that the groups had not met standards to halt the plans — a pause the state estimated would cost taxpayers $21,500 each day. The decision appeared to end a years-long dispute, part of a battle over how to accommodate non-drivers on a major river crossing that was designed to last a century. Demolition began on March 21, 2023.

<doc id="1103053" wikidata="Q5416833" url="?curid=1103053" title="EverQuest Role-Playing Game">
<text>EverQuest Role-Playing Game is a role-playing game based on the &quot;EverQuest&quot; fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). The game was published by White Wolf under its Sword and Sorcery Studios imprint. &quot;EverQuest Role-Playing Game&quot; shares many things with the MMORPG, such as setting, available races and classes, monsters, spells, and items.

==History==
&quot;EverQuest Role-Playing Game&quot; was first published in summer 2002 under Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s Open Gaming License using a system nearly identical to the d20 System, but was not d20 System branded because it included self-contained rules for character creation and advancement.

In early 2005, a major revision in the form of the &quot;EverQuest II&quot; Player&#x27;s Guide was released, which deviated even further from the d20 System. A notable example is its approach to classes. There are only four character classes, called &quot;Archetypes&quot;, available to starting characters. Each archetype has several more advanced classes, called &quot;Classes&quot; and &quot;Subclasses&quot;, associated with it; these work much like prestige classes in standard d20 System games. Characters can freely mix the four basic archetypes, but may only take the more advanced classes associated with &quot;one&quot; of the archetypes.

The EverQuest II Player&#x27;s Guide did not contain rules for magic, though a free download at Sword and Sorcery Studio&#x27;s website did give basic spells for low-level characters. Almost a year later, on March 1, 2006, the EverQuest II Spell Guide, which included the core rules for magic and a full spell list, was published in PDF form only. 

Freelancers and customer service representatives have stated that future &quot;EverQuest&quot; RPG releases, if any, will have statistics for both the &quot;EverQuest&quot; and &quot;EverQuest II&quot; games, rather than being exclusively for one or the other. As of 2011 no further products in either line have been released, and all mention of the &quot;EverQuest&quot; property have been removed from the White Wolf website.

<text>The Safeguard Program was a U.S. Army anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system designed to protect the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Minuteman ICBM silos from attack, thus preserving the US&#x27;s nuclear deterrent fleet. It was intended primarily to protect against the very small Chinese ICBM fleet, limited Soviet attacks and various other limited-launch scenarios. A full-scale attack by the Soviets would easily overwhelm it. It was designed to allow gradual upgrades to provide similar lightweight coverage over the entire United States over time.

Safeguard was the ultimate development of an ever-changing series of designs produced by Bell Labs that started in the 1950s with the LIM-49 Nike Zeus. By 1960 it was clear that Zeus offered almost no protection against a sophisticated attack using decoys. A new design emerged, Nike-X, with the ability to defend against attacks with hundreds of warheads and thousands of decoys, but the cost of the system was enormous. Looking for alternatives, the Sentinel program offered a lightweight cover that would protect against limited attacks. Sentinel began construction in 1968 but ran into a firestorm of protest over its bases being placed in suburban areas. In March 1969, incoming President Richard M. Nixon announced that Sentinel would be cancelled and redirected to protect the missile farms, and that its bases would be placed well away from any civilian areas.

The debate about ABM protection of US ICBMs had been going on for over a decade when Safeguard was announced, and the arguments against such a system were well known both in the military and civilian circles. In military circles, the most basic argument against Safeguard was that adding an ABM requires the Soviets to build another ICBM to counter it, but the same is true if the US builds another ICBM instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building more of their own ICBMs than Army ABMs, and lobbied against the Army continually. In the public sphere, opinion by the late 1960s was anti-military in general, and in an era of ongoing Strategic Arms Limitation Talks the entire concept was derided as sabre rattling. Safeguard had been developed to calm opposition but found itself just as heavily opposed. Nixon pressed ahead in spite of objections and complaints about limited performance, and the reasons for his strong support remains a subject of debate among historians and political commentators.

Through the Safeguard era, talks between the US and Soviet Union originally started by President Lyndon B. Johnson were continuing. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 limited the US and Soviet Union to two ABM sites each. Safeguard was scaled back to sites in North Dakota and Montana, abandoning initial work at a site in Missouri, and cancelling all other planned bases. Construction on the two remaining bases continued until 1974, when an additional agreement limited both countries to a single ABM site. The Montana site was abandoned with the main radar partially completed. The remaining base in North Dakota, the Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard Complex, became active on 1 April 1975 and fully operational on 1 October 1975. By that time the House Appropriations Committee had already voted to deactivate it. The base was shut down on 10 February 1976.

==History==
===Nike Zeus===
An anti-ICBM defensive ABM system was first considered by the US Army in 1955 under the name Nike II. This was essentially an upgraded version of their Nike B surface-to-air missile (SAM) along with dramatically improved radars and computers able to detect the incoming reentry vehicles (RVs) and develop tracking information while still leaving enough time for the interceptor missile to climb to its altitude. Zeus had limited &quot;traffic handling&quot; capabilities, designed to deal with a small number of attacking missiles arriving over a period of as long as an hour. It was calculated that an attack of only four missiles arriving within one minute would allow one of the warheads to pass by while the system was busy attacking others, making it relatively easy to attack the Zeus base. However, in an era when ICBMs cost about the same as a strategic bomber, such an attack would cost an enormous amount.

Through the late 1950s a new generation of much lighter thermonuclear bombs cut warhead weight from in the case of the original Soviet R-7 Semyorka ICBM to perhaps , and further reductions were known to be possible - the US&#x27;s W47 of the UGM-27 Polaris weighed only . This meant that much smaller rockets could carry these new warheads to the same range, greatly reducing the cost of the missile, making them far cheaper than bombers or any other delivery system. When Nikita Khrushchev angrily boasted that the Soviet Union was producing new missiles &quot;like sausages&quot;, the US responded by building more ICBMs of their own, rather than attempting to defend against them with Zeus. Adding to the problems, as the warhead weight dropped, existing missiles had leftover throw weight that could be used for various radar decoys, which Zeus proved unable to distinguish from the actual RV. The Army calculated that as many as twenty Zeus&#x27; would have to be fired to ensure a single incoming missile was destroyed.

===Nike-X===
Faced with these problems, both the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations turned to the newly created ARPA to suggest solutions. ARPA noted that because the decoys were lighter than the actual warhead, they would slow down more rapidly as they reentered the lower atmosphere. They proposed a system using a short range missile that could wait until the warhead was below altitude, at which point the decoys would have been &quot;decluttered&quot;. Desiring to destroy the missile before it was below altitude, combined with the per second terminal speed of the RV meant there were only 2 to 3 seconds to develop a track and shoot the interceptor. This would demand extremely fast missiles, high-performance radars and advanced computers.

In 1963, Robert McNamara cancelled the upcoming deployment of Zeus and announced that money would instead be provided for research into this new system, now known as Nike-X. Construction on the new phased array radar and its associated computer systems began at the MAR-I site in White Sands Missile Range. MAR could track hundreds of warheads and the interceptor missiles sent to attack them, meaning the Soviets would have to launch hundreds of missiles if they wanted to overwhelm it. And now that decoys were no longer an issue, the cost-exchange ratio fell back to reasonable levels.

The Nike-X developed the same sort of trouble as the Zeus before it. In this case it was ironically due to the Soviet&#x27;s own ABM system which was very similar to Zeus. To ensure they could defeat it, the US Air Force began equipping their own ICBMs with decoys, which would defeat the Soviet&#x27;s Zeus-like system. However, concerned that the Soviets would upgrade their system to Nike-X like performance, they instead began replacing their warheads with lighter ones, and carrying three of them. This meant that every US missile would require three (or six accounting for redundancy) interceptors.

When the same calculations were run for Nike-X, it was calculated that they would have to deploy 7,000 Sprint missiles, and the cost-exchange ratio was 20-to-1 in favor of the Soviets. When presented with these numbers, McNamara concluded that deploying Nike-X would prompt to Soviets to build more ICBMs, increasing the risk of an accidental war. From this point on, he opposed building a &quot;heavy&quot; ABM system like Nike-X.

===Sentinel===
In spite of all of these problems, which McNamara repeatedly made public in a series of talks, the Johnson administration was under intense pressure to deploy an ABM system. In 1966 Congress voted to provide deployment funding for Nike-X, although McNamara refused to use it. As the 1967 elections approached, it became clear that this was going to be a major election issue. McNamara proposed arms limitations talks with the Soviets to put upper limits on the numbers of ABMs and warheads, but the Glassboro Summit Conference ultimately came to nothing.

By late 1967 it was clear the Soviets were not seriously considering limitations, and were continuing deployment of their own ABM system. In September, the Chinese tested their first H-bomb. McNamara and Johnson seized on this as a solution to the problem; a defense against the tiny Chinese fleet was both technically possible and relatively low-cost. Deploying this system would mute the ongoing debate, even over the long term if the option was open to expand the system to Nike-X coverage levels in the future. On 18 September 1967, McNamara announced the Sentinel program, with 17 bases covering all of the US, along with a total of just under 700 missiles, about the number in a baseline Nike-X.

Nixon, having campaigned that the Democrats were deliberately dragging their feet on the ABM, inherited the system with his election win. He also inherited a massive NIMBY backlash that blew up in late 1968 when the Army chose to deploy the missiles in suburban locations to allow future expansion to be easier. City-dwellers could tolerate the idea of an armed rocket attack against bombers going on over their heads. They were less comfortable with the concept of nuclear anti-missiles detonating against incoming missiles at low altitudes.

The issue came to a head at a meeting outside Boston, when an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people showed up to express their displeasure in spite of a raging blizzard. Congressmen were flooded by letters from constituents demanding the sites be moved, and Congress was soon threatening to freeze all additional funds for the system. Nixon announced construction would be delayed while the system underwent a review.

===Safeguard===
The review was completed on 14 March 1969 and announced in a lengthy speech made by Nixon and various DoD advisers. The entire concept was reviewed and all possibilities considered fresh. Among these, the idea of a heavyweight Nike-X-like system was considered, but Defense Secretary Melvin Laird apparently came to the same conclusion as McNamara before him, stating that the protection the system offered simply didn&#x27;t justify the cost;

However, they disagreed with the concept of a light city defense as well. There was no reason to deploy a system that only worked under contrived circumstances, especially as accepting them as possibilities meant that the enemy was ignoring your deterrent. If that was the case, why have missiles at all? The real issue becomes ensuring they cannot ignore your deterrent, and it was this concept that Nixon chose. Instead of deploying the ABM system to protect cities, the new deployment would protect the missile bases themselves, ensuring that no limited attack could be contemplated. This did not have to be perfect, or even close to it;

==Operation==

Safeguard was a two-layer defense system. The long-range Spartan missile would attempt interception outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The missile&#x27;s long range allowed protection of a large geographic area. If the Spartan failed to intercept the incoming offensive missile, the high performance and high speed but short ranged Sprint missile would attempt an interception within the atmosphere. Both missiles used nuclear warheads, and they relied on destroying or damaging the incoming warhead with radiation rather than heat or blast. The Spartan carried a weapon with a yield; the Sprint in the range.

The envisioned sequence was as follows:

# Enemy launch detected by Defense Support Program satellites, sensing the hot infrared exhaust of the ICBM booster.
# While in the mid-course phase, the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System radars in the far north would detect the incoming warheads.
# As the warheads approached (but while still in outer space) the Safeguard long-range Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR) would detect them, providing filtered information to the shorter-range and more precise Missile Site Radar (MSR).
# While the incoming warhead came within range of the MSR, the associated computer systems would calculate intercept trajectories and launch times.

==Original deployment plan==
Plans were made in the late 1960s to deploy Safeguard systems in three locations, Whiteman AFB, Missouri, Malmstrom AFB, Montana, and Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota, to protect important strategic weapons assets. However the Whiteman AFB location was canceled despite the fact that specific missile and radar site locations had already been selected. Construction was actually commenced at the North Dakota and Montana sites, but only the North Dakota site was completed. Remnants of the incomplete PAR system still remain in rural Montana.

==Components==
The Safeguard system consisted of several primary components, the Perimeter Acquisition Radar, the Missile Site Radar, the Spartan missile launchers, co-located Sprint missile launchers, and Remote Sprint missile launchers.

===Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR)===
The PAR was a large passive electronically scanned array radar that was intended to detect incoming ballistic missile warheads as they crossed over the North Pole region. Potential targets detected by the PAR would be sent to the Missile Site Radar (MSR) and to North American Aerospace Defense Command. Two radar sites were intended to be constructed on the northern border of the United States, one in Montana and one in North Dakota. Construction was begun at both locations, but because of the ratification of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, only the site at North Dakota was completed. That site, near Cavalier, North Dakota, is now operated by the United States Space Force as Cavalier Space Force Station.

Remnants of the Montana PAR site are located east of Conrad, Montana, at .

===Missile Site Radar (MSR)===
The Missile Site Radar was the control of the Safeguard system. It housed the computers and a phased array radar necessary to track and hit back at incoming ICBM warheads. The radar building itself is a pyramid structure several stories tall. Construction was begun in both Montana and North Dakota, but only the North Dakota site remains standing. The MSR complex included 30 Spartan missile launchers and 16 Sprint missile launchers.

Remnants of the Montana MSR site were dismantled and buried.

===Remote Sprint Launchers (RSL)===
Remote Sprint Launchers were established around the MSR main complex in order to place missile launchers closer to their intended targets, and thus reduce the flight range to the targets. Four sites were completed, and they still remain there, around the MSR complex in Nekoma, North Dakota.

<text>The violet sabrewing (Campylopterus hemileucurus) is a species of hummingbird in the &quot;emeralds&quot;, tribe Trochilini of the subfamily Trochilinae. It is found from Mexico to Panama.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The violet sabrewing has two subspecies, the nominate &quot;C. h. hemileucurus&quot; and &quot;C. h. mellitus&quot;.

==Description==

The violet sabrewing is the largest hummingbird of Mexico and Central America. It is long and weighs . Both sexes have a black bill, though those of subspecies &quot;C. h. mellitus&quot; are longer than the nominate&#x27;s. Males of the nominate subspecies have a dusky crown with a bluish green gloss. Their nape and upper back, face, and underparts are metallic violet blue that is somewhat bluer on the belly. Their lower back and uppertail coverts are metallic green. Their central tail feathers are bluish green to bluish black and the rest blackish with wide white tips. Females have a dusky crown and metallic green to bronze green upperparts with a more bluish green rump. They have a violet blue throat. Their underparts are mostly gray with a whiter belly and metallic green spots along the sides and green undertail coverts. Their central tail feathers are bluish green and the rest blacker with wide white tips.

Males of subspecies &quot;C. h. mellitus&quot; have more green on their upper parts than the nominate and almost entirely violet underparts with no blue on the belly. Female&#x27;s upper-parts have a coppery tinge and their throat is violet.

==Distribution and habitat==

The nominate subspecies of violet sabrewing is found from the Mexican states of Guerrero and Veracruz intermittently south through Guatemala, southern Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador into northern Nicaragua. Subspecies &quot;C. h. mellitus&quot; is found most of the length of Costa Rica into western Panama. The species inhabits the edges and interior of humid evergreen montane forest and mature secondary forest, banana plantations, and gardens. In Mexico, it generally ranges in elevation between but occurs as high as . In Costa Rica, it ranges between .

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The violet sabrewing is mostly sedentary, but individuals frequently move to lower elevations after the breeding season.

===Feeding===

The violet sabrewing feeds on nectar primarily by trap-lining, visiting a circuit of flowering plants. Males occasionally defend patches of flowers and are dominant over other hummingbirds. The species forages mostly in the understory, often on &quot;Heliconia&quot;, banana (&quot;Musa&quot;), &quot;Cephalism&quot;, and &quot;Palic urea&quot; though it visits others as well. It frequents nectar (sugar water) feeders and chases other hummingbirds from them. In addition to nectar, violet sabrewings also eat arthropods gleaned from foliage and spiderwebs.

===Breeding===

The violet sabrewing breeds during the local rainy season, which ranges from June to September in Mexico and May to November in Costa Rica. In the latter country they may raise two broods. Males court females by singing in leks, typically in the understory or at the forest edge. The nest is a cup of moss cemented with spiderwebs and lined with fine fibers. In Costa Rica it is often built above a ravine or stream, on a horizontal branch above the ground. The female incubates the clutch of two eggs for 19 to 22 days and fledging occurs 22 to 24 days after hatch.

===Vocalization===

The violet sabrewing&#x27;s song has been described as &quot;&quot;cheep tsew cheep tik-tik tsew cheep&quot; ..., high-pitched, piercing and ventriloquial&quot; and as &quot;varied, loud, sharp chipping and warbles, often punctuated with fairly shrill, slightly explosive notes&quot;. Its calls are &quot;high, sharp chippering&quot;, &quot;prolonged, hard chipping&quot;, and &quot;single sharp chips given in flight.&quot;

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the violet sabrewing as being of Least Concern. It has a very large range and a population of at least 50,000 mature individuals, though the latter is believed to be decreasing. No specific threats have been identified. &quot;This species can tolerate habitat disturbance, however, as long as some forest cover or tall second growth persists.&quot;

<doc id="1103076" wikidata="Q530267" url="?curid=1103076" title="Emilio Prados">
<text>Emilio Prados (4 March 1899 – 24 April 1962) was a Spanish poet and editor, a member of the Generation of &#x27;27.

==Life==
Born in the Andalusian city of Málaga in 1899, Prados was offered a place at Madrid&#x27;s famous Residencia de estudiantes in 1914 and moved into its university section in 1918. Here he met Lorca, Dalí, Buñuel and many other young people who were to become celebrated and influential figures in Spanish art and literature.

In 1921, a long-running lung complaint forced him to retire to a sanatorium in Davosplatz, Switzerland, where he spent most of the year. In this enforced seclusion from wider society he read widely in European literature and settled upon becoming a writer himself. Emerging from the sanatorium in 1922, he resumed his academic training: taking courses at the universities of Freiburg and Berlin; visiting museums and art galleries across Germany; immersing himself in the artistic culture of Paris and meeting, amongst others, Pablo Picasso.

In the summer of 1924, he returned to Málaga, where he continued writing. Together with Manuel Altolaguirre he founded the magazine &quot;Litoral&quot;, one of the most influential literary and artistic publications of 1920s Spain. In 1925 he became an Editor for the &quot;Sur&quot; printing-house, again working closely with Altolaguirre. &quot;Sur&quot; was responsible for publishing most of the work of the Generation of &#x27;27, and the quality of their editing brought Prados and Altolaguirre international prestige.

At the same time as he was working in literature and pursuing his own creative talents, Prados took an increasing interest in social affairs and politics, particularly the marginalization of the poorest sectors of society. The climate of violence in Málaga after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 led him to return to Madrid, where he joined the Alianza de Intelectuales Antifascistas and began contributing enthusiastically to the intellectual side of the Republican cause. As well as publishing his own works (his compilation of war poetry, &quot;Destino fiel&quot;, won the National Literature Prize in 1938), he edited various books including &quot;Homenaje al poeta Federico García Lorca&quot; and &quot;Romancero general de la guerra de España&quot;.

He moved to Barcelona in 1938 and took charge, again with Altolaguirre, of the publications of the Republican Ministry of Public Instruction. However, as a prominent Republican he was soon forced to flee Spain altogether as the Nationalists won victory in the Civil War. He escaped to Paris and then, early in July 1939, in the company of a variety of other intellectual Republican figures, to Mexico, where he lived until his death in 1962.

==Work==
Early work, 1925 - 1928: Prados&#x27;s poetry highlights in particular the relationship between the natural world and the otherness of being, mixing avant-garde and surrealist elements with his own Arabic/Andalusian roots.
*&quot;Tiempo&quot; 
*&quot;Veinte poemas en verso&quot;
*&quot;Seis estampas paraun rompecabezas&quot;
*&quot;Canciones del farero&quot; 
*&quot;Vuelta&quot; 
*&quot;El misterio del agua&quot;

Political poetry, 1932 - 1938: Prados devotes himself to outspokenly social and political poetry, developing these themes using surrealist language.
*&quot;La voz cautiva&quot; 
*&quot;Andando, andando por el mundo&quot; 
*&quot;La tierra que no alienta&quot;
*&quot;Seis estancias&quot;
*&quot;Llanto en la sangre&quot;
*&quot;El llanto subterráneo&quot;
*&quot;Tres cantos&quot;
*&quot;Homenaje al poeta Federico García Lorca contra su muerte&quot;
*&quot;Romances&quot;
*&quot;Romancero general de la guerra de España&quot;
*&quot;Cancionero menor para los combatientes&quot;
*&quot;Destino fiel&quot; (a collection of all his war poetry, won the Premio Nacional de Literatura in 1938)

Poetry from exile, 1939 - 1962: Prados&#x27;s later poetry carries a profound sense of rootlessness and solitude. Thematically his work becomes much denser and more philosophical, addressing the complexity of concepts such as new life, solidarity and love.

*&quot;Mínima muerte&quot; 
*&quot;Jardín cerrado&quot; 
*&quot;Memoria del olvido&quot;
*&quot;Penumbras&quot;
*&quot;Río natural&quot; 
*&quot;Circuncisión del sueño&quot;

<doc id="1103081" wikidata="Q1077519" url="?curid=1103081" title="Ilford South (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Ilford South is a constituency created in 1945, and represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2024 by Jas Athwal of the Labour Party.

== Constituency profile==
The seat covers Ilford town centre and the surrounding suburbs, and the housing is predominantly semi-detached with little high-rise development. There is significant commuting to central London via the four stations on the Elizabeth line. The seat is ethnically diverse including white, black and Asian communities.

==Political history==
This constituency was created in 1945. The previous MP since 1992, Mike Gapes, who before defecting to Change UK, was the fourth Labour Party MP, each of whose tenures was interspersed or preceded by one of a Conservative MP serving the area. Regarded as a key marginal seat for decades, under Gapes&#x27;s tenure Ilford South became a very safe seat for the Labour Party; in every election since 1997 it has been won by a majority of over 20% by Labour, and in 2017 they secured over 75% of the vote in the constituency.

The 2015 result made the seat the 38th safest of Labour&#x27;s 232 seats by percentage of majority. The narrowest result since 1997 (inclusive) was in 2005 at a majority of 21.6%; the 2017 majority is the greatest ever achieved in the seat, at 54.9%.

== Boundaries ==

1945–1950: The Borough of Ilford wards of Clementswood, Cranbrook, Goodmayes, Loxford, and Park.

1950–1974: The Borough of Ilford wards of Clementswood, Cranbrook, Goodmayes, Loxford, Mayfield, and Park.

1974–1983: The London Borough of Redbridge wards of Clementswood, Cranbrook, Goodmayes, Ilford, Mayfield, and Park.

1983–1997: As above substituting Ilford and Park with reshaped wards Loxford, Newbury, and Valentines.

1997–2024: As above plus Chadwell and Seven Kings wards.

2024–present: The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham ward of Chadwell Heath, and the London Borough of Redbridge wards of Chadwell, Clementswood, Goodmayes, Ilford Town, Loxford, Mayfield, Newbury, and Seven Kings.
:&quot;The Cranbrook and Valentines wards were transferred to Ilford North, with the small part of Wanstead Park ward going to Leyton and Wanstead. To partly compensate, the Chadwell Heath ward was transferred from Dagenham and Rainham.&quot;

<doc id="1103083" wikidata="Q5195950" url="?curid=1103083" title="Curtiss Candy Company">
<text>The Curtiss Candy Company was an American confectionery brand and a former company based in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded in 1916 by Otto Schnering near Chicago, Illinois. Wanting a more &quot;American-sounding&quot; name (due to anti-German sentiment during World War I), Schnering named his company using his mother&#x27;s maiden name.

Their first confectionery item was Kandy Kake, later refashioned in 1920 as the log-shaped Baby Ruth. Their second confectionery item was the chocolate-covered peanut butter crunch Butterfinger, which was introduced in 1926. In 1931, Curtiss marketed the brand by sponsoring famous air racer, John H. Livingston, in the Baby Ruth Aerobatic Team flying the air-racer Howard &quot;Mike&quot; at airshows, and sponsoring Livingston&#x27;s Monocoupe racer in the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race. The Jolly Jack candy was included in army rations during World War II.

In 1964, Standard Brands purchased Curtiss Candy Company. Standard Brands merged with Nabisco in 1981. In 1990, RJR Nabisco sold the Curtiss brands to Nestlé.

The Baby Ruth / Butterfinger factory, built in the 1960s, is located at 3401 Mt. Prospect Rd. in Franklin Park, Illinois. Interstate 294 curves eastward around the plant, where a prominent, rotating sign, resembling a giant candy bar, is visible. It originally read &quot;Curtiss Baby Ruth&quot; on one side and &quot;Curtiss Butterfinger&quot; on the other. It was changed to read &quot;Nestlé&quot; following the acquisition.

A &quot;Curtiss Baby Ruth&quot; sign was on an apartment building across from Wrigley Field for several decades. Wrigley and the Curtiss plant are both on Addison Street, although more than 10 miles apart.

<doc id="1103090" wikidata="Q533425" url="?curid=1103090" title="Roman square capitals">
<text>Roman square capitals, also called capitalis monumentalis, inscriptional capitals, elegant capitals and capitalis quadrata, are an ancient Roman form of writing, and the basis for modern capital letters. Square capitals are characterized by sharp, straight lines, supple curves, thick and thin strokes, angled stressing and incised serifs. When written in documents this style is known as Latin book hand.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
Square capitals were used to write inscriptions, and less often to supplement everyday handwriting as Latin book hand. For everyday writing, the Romans used a current cursive hand known as Latin cursive. Notable examples of square capitals used for inscriptions are found on the Roman Pantheon, Trajan&#x27;s Column, and the Arch of Titus, all in Rome. These Roman capitals are also called majuscules, as a counterpart to minuscule letters such as Merovingian and Carolingian.

Before the 4th century CE, square capitals were used to write &quot;de luxe&quot; copies of the works of authors categorized as &quot;pagan&quot; by Christians, especially those of Virgil; the only three surviving manuscripts using this letter, among them the Vergilius Augusteus, contain works by Virgil. After the 5th century the square capitals fell out of use, except as a display lettering for titles and chapter headings in conjunction with various script hands for body text: for example, uncials.

Edward Catich is noted for the fullest development of the thesis that the inscribed Roman square capitals owed their form, including the serifs, wholly to the use of the flat brush, rather than to the exigencies of the chisel or other stone cutting tools. Although not universally accepted, the brushed-origin thesis had been proposed in the nineteenth century. Catich made a complete study and proposed a convincing by which the forms were created, using a flat brush and then chisel.

=== Later influence ===

==== Renaissance ====
Square capitals were greatly respected by artisans of the Renaissance such as Geoffroy Tory and Felice Feliciano.

==== Arts and Crafts movement ====

In the 19th and 20th centuries, they were a major inspiration for artisans of the Arts and Crafts movement such as Edward Johnston and Eric Gill, and so many signs and engravings created with an intentionally artistic design in the twentieth century are based on them.

==== Influence on modern typefaces ====
During the early era of the movable type printing press, Roman square capitals became the primary inspiration for the capital letters in early serif typefaces; Roman type, especially that developed by those associated with Aldus Manutius, came to produce a number of typefaces still used to the present day. The 1989 digital typeface Trajan from Adobe is a direct, all-capital adaptation of the Roman square capitals on Trajan&#x27;s column.

<text>The University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law (formerly University of Maryland School of Law) is the law school of the University of Maryland, Baltimore and is located in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1816, it is one of the oldest law schools in the United States.

The law school is fully accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). It is a member of the Association of American Law Schools and has a chapter of the Order of the Coif honor society.

==History==
Maryland Law was founded in 1816 as the Maryland Law Institute. David Hoffman is credited with founding the institute, and in 1817 he published his legal course Hoffman&#x27;s Course of Legal Study. The school began regular instruction in 1824, and it is the fourth oldest law school in the United States. After the law school denied admission to black applicant Donald Gaines Murray on account of his race, in 1936 the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that the law school must admit him.

In 2002, the law school moved into a facility in downtown Baltimore near the Inner Harbor and Oriole Park at Camden Yards. In 2011, the law school received a donation from the W.P. Carey Foundation, the largest gift in the school&#x27;s history. In response, the law school changed its name to the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.

==Student body==

Maryland Law has approximately 650 students enrolled in its Juris Doctor (J.D.) program. The racial makeup of students in the J.D. program is approximately , with about 30% identifying as a minority race (and the remainder are unknown or did not specify). Around 72% of J.D. students are under 25 years old. There are more than 40 student organizations, four specialized legal centers, and five law journals.

In 2019, Maryland Law enrolled 205 students into its first-year J.D. class, including 179 full-time students and 26 part-time students. The median LSAT score was 160, and the median undergraduate GPA was 3.66. The law school accepted approximately 36% of its applicants.

==Rankings==
The law school was ranked 51st by the U.S. News &amp; World Report in 2023-2024. The 2023 edition ranked Maryland Law 6th in part-time programs, 6th in health care law, 13th in environmental law, 12th in dispute resolution, and 8th in clinical training.

==Bar passage and employment outcomes== 
According to Maryland Law&#x27;s official data reported to the American Bar Association, approximately 77% of Maryland Law graduates who took the bar exam for the first time in 2019 passed. In addition, 94% of 2019 J.D. graduates were employed in some capacity ten months after graduation. These 2019 graduates became employed in a variety of contexts, including approximately 35% in judicial clerkships (4% federal clerkships and 31% state and local clerkships), 23% in government, 20% in private practice, 11% in business and industry, 5% in public interest, and 4% in education. For 2018 J.D. graduates who entered private practice within ten months of graduation, the median starting salary was $80,000.

==Costs==
During the 2019-2020 academic year, tuition and fees for full-time J.D. students were $32,808 for Maryland residents and $48,426 for out-of-state students. For part-time J.D. students, tuition and fees were $21,538 for Maryland residents and $31,704 for out-of-state students. The estimated total cost of attendance for J.D. students, which includes tuition and fees, living expenses, transportation expenses, book expenses, and health insurance, was $61,745 for full-time students who are Maryland residents, $79,277 for full-time out-of-state students, $45,123 for part-time students who are Maryland residents, and $56,972 for part-time out-of-state students. In addition, 77% of students received a scholarship or grant from Maryland Law, including 78% of full-time students and 74% of part-time students.

==Academics==
===Curriculum===
==== Core ====
The core curriculum at Maryland Law for J.D. students includes courses in civil procedure, constitutional law, torts, property, contracts, and criminal law, as well as a two-semester sequence of courses focusing on legal skills of analysis, research, writing, and oral argument. After completing these initial courses, students are required to complete additional coursework in constitutional law, ethics, and legal research, and satisfy experiential and writing requirements. This core curriculum forms the basis for more specialized study through more than 150 elective courses, seminars, independent studies, simulations, clinics, and externships.

The LL.M. degree program is designed for students who have earned a prior law degree, either a J.D. degree from a law school in the United States or a law degree from a school in another country. Students must complete coursework in a specialty field and may choose to write a thesis. LL.M. students who did not earn a prior law degree in an American law school must take a course on introductory American law, but otherwise, no specific courses are required for LL.M. students.

====Specialty programs====
Maryland Law is home to several specialty programs that enable students to explore areas of interest through experiential learning and a specialized curriculum. The main specialty areas include:

* Alternative Dispute Resolution
* Business Law
* Clinical Law
* Cybersecurity and Crisis Management
* Environmental Law 
* Health Care Law
* Intellectual Property Law
* International and Comparative Law
* Public Health Law
* Women, Leadership, and Equality

Students can focus in other areas as well, such as criminal law, dispute resolution, family law/child advocacy, general practice, jurisprudence/legal history, labor/employment law, administrative law, property/real estate/decedent&#x27;s estates law, public interest law/community development, and tax law.

====Clinical law program====
Through the Cardin Requirement, named after Maryland Law alumnus U.S. Senator Benjamin Cardin, each full-time day student in the J.D. program must gain hands-on legal experience by representing actual clients who would otherwise lack access to justice. Most students fulfill the Cardin Requirement through the Clinical Law Program, which provides free legal services to Maryland&#x27;s poorest citizens each year.

More than 25 clinics focus on a broad range of practice areas, including civil and criminal litigation, advice and counseling, and transactional work. Civil practice areas include environmental law, health, housing and community development, juvenile law and children, AIDS, and immigration. Criminal student attorneys often represent defendants in misdemeanor cases in Maryland&#x27;s district courts, as well as work in the School of Law&#x27;s community justice efforts. In addition to in-house clinical work, students may gain experience in public and private nonprofit externships in the Baltimore-Washington region.

====Initiatives====
In addition to formal specialty programs, the law school sponsors a variety of academic and public service initiatives. These initiatives enhance the educational and scholarly mission of the law school and also serve the community.

* Agriculture Law Education Initiative
* Chacón Center for Immigrant Justice
* Leadership, Ethics and Democracy (LEAD) Initiative: In spring 2008, the Fetzer Institute made a three-year $1.6 million funding commitment to the School of Law to help it respond to these challenges and create a Leadership, Ethics and Democracy program (LEAD).
* Legislation, politics, and public policy: The University of Maryland School of Law offers students an educational experience in the areas of legislation, public policy and public interest practice.
* Linking law and the arts: The University of Maryland School of Law, in conjunction with local arts organizations and as part of the &quot;Linking Law and Arts&quot; series, uses theater and art to help address complex legal, social, and public policy issues. As part of their commitment to blending law and the arts, students and professors at Maryland Law produced a short film in 2010 about the handling of war tribunals at Guantanamo Bay titled &quot;The Response&quot; starring Aasif Mandvi. UMD Carey Law is also one of fewer than 10 law schools in the United States to offer a course in Visual Legal Advocacy, teaching students how to and encouraging them to incorporate cinema into their advocacy work.
*The Moser Ethics in Action Initiative The successor to the LEAD Initiative.
*Erin Levitas Initiative for Sexual Assault Prevention

The Thurgood Marshall Law Library houses a collection of more than 495,000 volumes and equivalents accessible through the online catalog. A staff of 23, including 11 librarians, provides customized reference and consulting services to faculty and students. In addition to LexisNexis, Westlaw and Bloomberg Law, the library offers a legal and non-legal Web-based electronic databases.

The library is named after Justice Thurgood Marshall. Despite growing up in Baltimore, he was unable to attend Maryland Law because, in the 1930s, the school denied all African Americans admission. Marshall attended Howard University School of Law.

<text>Football Club Groningen () is a Dutch professional association football club based in Groningen, Groningen province. Founded in 1971 as the successor of GVAV, Groningen compete in the Eredivisie, the first tier of Dutch football, following promotion from the 2023–24 Eerste Divisie.

Groningen played in the Eredivisie during their first three seasons, before the side were relegated to the Eerste Divisie in 1973–74 as they got into financial difficulties. Groningen were promoted back to the Eredivisie as champions in 1979–80 with a squad composed mostly of players who were recruited from the club&#x27;s youth academy, remaining in the top flight for 18 seasons before they dropped to the second tier in 1997–98. The team won promotion back to the Eredivisie in 1999–2000, where they remained for 23 seasons before suffering relegation in 2022–23. Groningen finished as runners-up in the 2023–24 Eerste Divisie and returned to the Eredivisie at the first attempt.

Groningen have won the KNVB Cup once, in 2014–15, and were runners-up in 1988–89. Groningen achieved their highest league finish in 1990–91 when they ranked third in the Eredivisie, competing for the league title until the latter part of the season. The side have participated in several European competitions; Groningen&#x27;s first participation in European competition came during the 1983–84 UEFA Cup, when they defeated Atlético Madrid on aggregate in the first round, but were eliminated by Inter Milan in the following round. Erwin Koeman, Ronald Koeman, Arjen Robben and Virgil van Dijk started their careers at Groningen, while it was Luis Suárez&#x27;s first European club.

The team&#x27;s first home ground was Oosterparkstadion; since 2006, they have played their home games at Euroborg. Groningen&#x27;s home kit colours are based on the city&#x27;s coat of arms: green and white. The club is nicknamed &quot;Trots van het Noorden&quot; (), and has a rivalry with Frisian side Heerenveen, with whom it contests the Derby van het Noorden ().

==History==
===Foundation===
GVAV, established in 1921, were founder members of the Eredivisie in 1956, the first tier in Dutch football. GVAV were one of the four professional teams from the city of Groningen, the others being Be Quick, Velocitas and . During the early 1960s, GVAV became mired in financial difficulties. This led to the establishment of &quot;Stichting Betaald Voetbal GVAV&quot; () in 1963, a triumvirate of GVAV, Groningen City Council and an organisation representing local businesses. The three parties paid 300,000 Dutch guilders each to be the foundation&#x27;s shareholders; GVAV&#x27;s finances remained in a weak position and their future as a professional side was uncertain, as was the prospect of professional football in the city of Groningen, with GVAV the only remaining professional team left. The club remained in the Eredivisie until it was relegated to the Eerste Divisie in 1969–70.

In February 1970, Harm Brink, the chairman of amateur club , suggested the foundation of a new professional team representing Groningen. Several other local amateur clubs supported Brink&#x27;s idea, and local businesses and Groningen City Council were willing to remit the debt of Stichting Betaald Voetbal GVAV. In September 1970, the majority of GVAV&#x27;s members voted in favour of the plans. GVAV won promotion to the Eredivisie after a one-year absence, and Football Club Groningen were founded on 16 June 1971 as the successor of GVAV, who returned to amateur football. During the 1970–71 season, GVAV goalkeeper and Netherlands international Tonny van Leeuwen conceded only seven goals; no goalkeeper conceded fewer during the season, and Van Leeuwen was honoured with an award by the Royal Dutch Football Association in Rotterdam. On his way back home, Van Leeuwen died in a car accident, one day before Groningen&#x27;s foundation. Groningen played their first match on 17 July 1971, defeating German Regionalliga side TSR Olympia Wilhelmshaven 6–0. Groningen played in a green and white kit, the colours of the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

===Financial difficulties and European matches (1971–1991)===

Groningen lost their first league game 1–0 at home against FC Utrecht in front of 13,000 spectators. The team recorded their first league victory on the 10th matchday—a 2–1 win at Vitesse—and finished the 1971–72 Eredivisie season 12th out of 18 sides. The club was still mired in financial difficulties; to cut transfer expenses, Groningen established a scouting system. In 1973–74, Groningen ranked bottom and were relegated to the Eerste Divisie; during the season, the team lost 9–0 to Ajax, Groningen&#x27;s record defeat. The club came close to bankruptcy but was saved by Groningen City Council. In 1974–75, Groningen finished runners-up to NEC Nijmegen because of an inferior goal difference, although Groningen qualified for the play-offs which determined the second and final team to gain promotion to the Eredivisie. They finished second behind FC Eindhoven and remained in the second tier. In 1975, Groningen established a youth boarding school as the club tried to rebuild the squad with youth players. The side placed eighth in the 1976–77 Eerste Divisie—Groningen&#x27;s lowest league finish—before they missed promotion to the Eredivisie on goal difference in the promotion play-offs in 1977–78, despite Peter Houtman scoring a club record 31 goals during the season. Groningen finished runners-up to Excelsior in 1978–79, but returned to the Eredivisie as champions in the following season under coach , losing only 4 of 36 matches. Most of the squad came from Groningen&#x27;s youth academy.

In the 1982–83 season, Groningen qualified for European competition for the first time following a 5th-place finish, meaning that the side would enter the 1983–84 UEFA Cup. Key player Ronald Koeman left the club during the off-season in 1983 and joined Ajax, while his brother Erwin remained at Groningen; both players had made their debut at Groningen. The team&#x27;s first European game was an away match against Atlético Madrid, losing 2–1 after being 1–0 ahead. Groningen recorded a shock 3–0 victory in the return game, winning 4–2 on aggregate. They faced Inter Milan in the second round; Groningen won 2–0 at Oosterparkstadion but lost 5–1 in Italy and were eliminated from the competition. Groningen competed in European competition again on five occasions from 1986 until 1992, reaching the third round in the 1986–87 UEFA Cup and in the 1988–89 UEFA Cup.

As a result of their successful spell, Groningen became almost fully professional during the mid-1980s—only Jan van Dijk and Adri van Tiggelen remained semi-professionals. The club also recorded the fourth highest average home attendances in Dutch football—behind Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord—as it attracted more than 10,000 fans for each match. In 1989, Groningen reached their first KNVB Cup final, but lost 4–1 against PSV. During the same year, Groningen chairman was found guilty by the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) of embezzlement and the use of dirty money to sign several players between 1984 and 1989. De Vries, Groningen&#x27;s chairman since 1980, stepped down and spent several days in prison. Several other Eredivisie clubs were also investigated and punished by the FIOD during this period, with Groningen receiving an additional assessment of 700,000 Dutch guilders from the Tax and Customs Administration. Groningen were saddled with debt and again came close to bankruptcy. Despite the financial situation, Groningen recorded their highest-ever league finish in 1990–91: third place. Managed by Hans Westerhof, Groningen competed for the league title with Ajax and PSV until the latter part of the season, when suspensions and injuries to first-team players saw them drop points. Groningen&#x27;s Henny Meijer was named Dutch Footballer of the Year after the season ended.

===New stadium and the first major honour (1991–2021)===
Although Groningen recorded a 5th-place finish in 1991–92 and qualified for the 1992–93 UEFA Cup, the team began to slide down the league table; they were eventually relegated to the Eerste Divisie in 1997–98. Groningen had little financial resources left, and made many managerial changes in a search for success. The side returned to the Eredivisie in 1999–2000 following a first-place finish in the promotion play-offs group. During the season, Groningen set several club records: they scored 81 goals, won 10 matches in a row and recorded their largest victory—10–1 against DVS &#x27;33 in the KNVB Cup. In December 2000, 16-year-old Arjen Robben made his professional debut under coach Jan van Dijk; Robben, later regarded as one of the best players of his generation, was soon sold to PSV for a fee of 3.9 million euros. Groningen avoided relegation during their first seasons back in the Eredivisie; under coach Ron Jans, appointed in 2002, Groningen began to return into the top half of the league.

In January 2006, Groningen moved from the outdated Oosterparkstadion—the club&#x27;s first home stadium—to the newly-built Euroborg. The club&#x27;s average home attendance increased from approximately 12,000 in Oosterparkstadion to around 20,000 in its new stadium. Groningen went the first 15 league games unbeaten at Euroborg, and the stadium was soon nicknamed &quot;De Groene Hel&quot; (). Groningen finished the 2005–06 season in fifth place and qualified for the play-offs which determined a place in the preliminary round of the UEFA Champions League. Groningen reached the final but were narrowly beaten by Ajax on aggregate, after Ajax scored in the last minutes of the second leg; the side qualified instead for the 2006–07 UEFA Cup in which they were eliminated by Partizan Belgrade in the preliminary round. Groningen again qualified for the UEFA Cup preliminary round the following season, but were eliminated by Italian side Fiorentina after a penalty shootout. In 2010, Jans left the club and went to local rivals Heerenveen; his successor was former Groningen player Pieter Huistra.

Under Huistra, the team finished 5th in 2010–11 and reached the European competition play-off final; Groningen turned around a 5–1 deficit against ADO Den Haag but lost after a penalty shootout. In 2013–14, Groningen won the European competition play-off final under coach Erwin van de Looi and qualified for the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, but were eliminated by Aberdeen in the second qualifying round. Groningen claimed their first major honour during the season, however, defeating PEC Zwolle 2–0 in the 2015 KNVB Cup final. They became the third Groningen-based team to win a major honour, after Be Quick (1919–20 Dutch League Championship) and Velocitas (1933–34 KNVB Cup). By winning the cup, Groningen qualified for the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League group stage. They gained only two points from six matches and finished the group in bottom place. In 2019, —Groningen&#x27;s CEO since 1996 and the longest-serving director in Dutch professional football—stepped down and was replaced by Excelsior&#x27;s Wouter Gudde.

=== Relegation and promotion (2021–present) ===
In 2022–23, Groningen finished the season in bottom place, winning only 4 times in 34 matches, and were relegated to the Eerste Divisie for the third time. Before the start of the season, the German Frank Wormuth was appointed coach. He was sacked in November 2022, after which Wormuth labelled the working conditions as &quot;mentally unsafe&quot;. Under his successor, Dennis van der Ree, Groningen won only once in 21 matches, and were eliminated from the KNVB Cup at home by amateur club SV Spakenburg. During the season, director of football Mark-Jan Fledderus was sacked, and two board members stepped down. Gudde concluded the squad was unfit, unbalanced, and lacked quality and &quot;personality&quot;. Under coach Dick Lukkien, Groningen finished runners-up in the Eerste Divisie the following season and were promoted back to the Eredivisie with a squad composed of many players who were recruited from Groningen&#x27;s youth academy; the team defeated direct rivals Roda JC 2–0 on the last matchday to take second place from them.

==Crest and colours==

Shortly after Groningen were founded in June 1971, &quot;Nieuwsblad van het Noorden&quot; organised a competition to design a crest for the club. The draft of 21-year-old Reint Rozema, a designer at a local printing house, was chosen: an abstract letter &quot;G&quot;, referring to Groningen. In 1993, board member and commercial manager Jos Smulders added a Pegasus to the badge to give Groningen a more &quot;dynamic and aggressive&quot; image; in 1996, the Pegasus was removed after criticism from the club&#x27;s fans and the local press, and the original crest was restored.

Groningen&#x27;s colours have been green and white since the club&#x27;s foundation, derived from the city&#x27;s coat of arms. During the first seasons, the team also played several matches in a purple kit. Groningen&#x27;s jerseys were manufactured by local companies until 1975, when Adidas became the first to have its logo on the club&#x27;s shirt. The team&#x27;s first kit sponsor was AGO in 1982. Since then, the club has had a variety of kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors. Until the early 1990s, Groningen used various permutations of green and white on their home kits, when the club adopted a white shirt with two vertical green stripes.

==Stadium==

Groningen have played their home matches at Euroborg since January 2006, which replaced Oosterparkstadion, the home of GVAV and Groningen since the 1930s. The Netherlands national team played two international matches at Oosterparkstadion: against Cyprus in 1981 and in 1983 against Iceland. In 1985, Groningen recorded their largest attendance at the stadium during a 1–1 draw against Feyenoord, when 21,500 spectators attended. The club first expressed an interest in building a new stadium away from Oosterparkstadion in 1996 as it had become outdated and had only a capacity of around 12,500. In 2003, Groningen started with the building of Euroborg, designed by Wiel Arets. The stadium was opened on 13 January 2006 with a match against Heerenveen, which Groningen won 2–0. It hosted the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship final, in which the Netherlands defeated Serbia 4–1. In 2014, Groningen became the first Dutch club to have its own solar power plant; more than 1,000 solar panels were placed on the roof of Euroborg to make Groningen &quot;more eco-friendly&quot;.

Euroborg&#x27;s current capacity is 22,525, and is nicknamed &quot;De Groene Hel&quot; () and &quot;De Groene Kathedraal&quot; (). The stadium consists of four stands: the Tonny van Leeuwen Tribune, the Piet Fransen Tribune, the Koeman Familie Tribune and a stand containing skyboxes.

==Supporters and rivalries==

Groningen&#x27;s supporters are mainly drawn from the provinces of Groningen and Drenthe. During their early years, Groningen, and their predecessor GVAV, also had a decent following in Friesland as they were the only northern team in the Eredivisie, which earned them the nickname &quot;Trots van het Noorden&quot; (). During the late 1970s, an ultras group known as the Z-side emerged from within Groningen&#x27;s fanbase. The Z-side and other Groningen ultras groups have had long-standing friendships with the ultras and hooligans of AS Roma, Beerschot and Rot-Weiß Erfurt. The club&#x27;s fans also have had a long-standing friendship with supporters of Scottish team Hibernian since the 1990s. Several Groningen and Hibernian fans regularly make an overseas journey to visit each other&#x27;s matches.

As Groningen are one of the few professional sides in the Northern Netherlands and the only team from the province of Groningen, the team lack rivalries. Until SC Veendam from Groningen province was dissolved in 2013, Groningen contested the with the club. The sides met only four times in the Eredivisie—in 1986–87 and 1988–89, with both teams winning once—as Veendam spent most of their existence in the lower divisions. During the 1990s, Groningen contested heated matches with Twente as hooligans of both clubs often clashed. During the same period, a local rivalry between Groningen and Frisian club Heerenveen developed—known as the Derby van het Noorden ()—following Heerenveen&#x27;s first-ever promotion to the Eredivisie in 1989–90. Groningen went down to the Eerste Divisie in 1998, and by 2000, they were surpassed in results by Heerenveen. During the 2000s, the rivalry reached its peak and fans of both clubs pulled pranks, such as Groningen fans painting the statue of Heerenveen&#x27;s Abe Lenstra in green-white colours. The rivalry faded during the mid-2010s as another Frisian club, Cambuur, won promotion to the Eredivisie; Heerenveen regard Cambuur as their main rivals.

===Coaches===
Ron Groenewoud was the club&#x27;s first coach; he was relegated with Groningen to the Eerste Divisie in 1974 and remained in charge until 1975. Groningen won the Eerste Divisie title in 1979–80 under coach , who also led them to qualification for their first-ever European campaign in 1983. Groningen recorded their best league finish under Hans Westerhof: third in the 1990–91 Eredivisie. After relegation in 1998, the side won promotion back to the top flight under Jan van Dijk in 1999–2000. Erwin van de Looi led Groningen to their first major honour: the 2014–15 KNVB Cup. The German Frank Wormuth became the club&#x27;s first foreign coach when he took the post in 2022. Under Dick Lukkien, Groningen won promotion back to the top flight in 2023–24.

<text>Jill Beck (born 1949) is an American dancer, scholar, administrator and educator. She served as the 15th president of Lawrence University from July 2004 to 2013. On February 2, 2012, Beck announced her intention to retire, and was succeeded by Mark Burstein.

== Early life and education ==
A native of Worcester, Massachusetts, Beck received a B.A. in philosophy and art history from Clark University, an M.A. in history and music from McGill University, and a Ph.D. in theatre history and criticism from the City University of New York.

== Career ==
As dean of the School of the Arts at the University of California, Irvine from 1995 to 2003, she instituted a strategic planning process and led a capital campaign that contributed to the school&#x27;s endowment, facilities, educational mission, and outreach activities. Under her leadership, the school was named the Claire Trevor School of the Arts and undergraduate applications increased by more than 70 percent over four years.

During her tenure as dean, Beck founded the ArtsBridge outreach program in art education, with professor Keith Fowler as its initial administrative director. Now named ArtsBridge America, the program is an arts partnership between universities and the K-12 community. The program offers hands-on experiences in the arts to school-age children, placing university students in K-12 classrooms as instructors and mentors. Beck also established the da Vinci Research Center for Learning Through the Arts, an interdisciplinary center for research focused on learning across disciplines.

In 2000, Beck co-chaired an international conference entitled &quot;Sciences for the Arts: Building a Coalition for Arts Education&quot; that brought psychological and medical researchers together with artists and art educators.

Beck is both a scholar and a practitioner of dance and choreography and has written in the fields of dance history, theory, repertory, and technique, as well as directed ballet and modern dance repertory. In addition to holding an appointment as professor of dance at UCI, she has taught at the City College of New York and the Juilliard School. Beck was a founding member of the Alliance of Dance Notation Educators.

<text>The Pen (, &quot;al-qalam&quot;), or Nūn (Arabic: نٓ) is the sixty-eighth chapter (sūrah) of the Qur&#x27;an with 52 verses (āyāt). Quran 68 describes God&#x27;s justice and the judgment day. Three notable themes of this Surah are its response to the opponents&#x27; objections, warning and admonition to the disbelievers, and exhortation of patience to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Chronologically, this was the first appearance of any of the &quot;disjointed&quot; [i.e., single] letters (muqattaat) which precede a number of the surahs of the Qur&#x27;an, while in Quranic order this is the last surah to have the appearance of muqattaat.

==Summary==
:1-8 Muhammad not a madman nor an impostor
:9-16 Invective against a prominent enemy of Islam
:17-34 The example of certain gardeners a warning to the Makkans
:35-47 Disbelievers warned of coming judgment
:48-50 Muhammad exhorted not to be impatient, like Jonah
:51-52 Extreme hatred of the Quraish towards Muhammad

==Verse of Evil Eye==
==Asbab al-nuzul==
&quot;Asbab al-nuzul&quot; (occasions or circumstances of revelation) is a secondary genre of Qur&#x27;anic exegesis (&quot;tafsir&quot;) directed at establishing the context in which specific verses of the Qur&#x27;an were revealed. Though of some use in reconstructing the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s historicity, &quot;asbab&quot; is by nature an exegetical rather than a historiographical genre, and as such usually associates the verses it explicates with general situations rather than specific events. Most of the &quot;mufassirun&quot; say that this surah was revealed at Mecca, at a stage when opposition to Muhammad had grown very strong and intense verbally. At the same time, here seems absence of any physical violence towards Muslims. According to some historians including William Muir, ayaat 9 to 16 refer to Walid ibn al-Mughirah as his personality traits fit in the character defined in these ayaat and a tradition by Ibn Abbas that &quot;We know of no one whom God has described in the derogatory way in which He describes him, blighting him with ignominy that will never leave him (the adverbial qualifier [ba&#x27;da dhalika, &#x27;moreover&#x27;] is semantically connected to zanim, &#x27;ignoble&#x27;)&quot;. Tafsir al-Jalalayn also highlights the correlation in 16th ayah: &quot;Soon We shall brand him on the snout&quot; and his nose being chopped off by a sword at the Battle of Badr. However the target personality is not restricted to a single person as the ayaat describe a personality type and not a name and the description starts with a plural form: &quot;So do not obey the deniers&quot;.

==Period of revelation==

Surahs in the Qur&#x27;an are not arranged in the chronological order of revelation because order of wahy or &quot;chronological order of revelation&quot; is not a part of Quran but according to Aisha: &quot;Muhammed always recited the Quran in Chronological order even in prayer&quot; and there are many verses on arrangement of Quran e.g. Surah Furqhan Verse 32 &quot;...we have repeated it in perfect arrangement&quot;. Also other imaams tell that Ali was ordered by Muhammed to arrange the Quran in Chronological Order. According to Israr Ahmed: Muhammed told his followers the placement (sahaba) in Quranic order of every Wahy revealed along with the original text of Quran, Israr Ahmed&#x27;s word on this cannot be taken as the only truth or the only view on this subject. Wm Theodore de Bary, an East Asian studies expert, describes that &quot;The final process of collection and codification of the Quran text was guided by one over-arching principle: God&#x27;s words must not in any way be distorted or sullied by human intervention. For this reason, no serious attempt, apparently, was made to edit the numerous revelations, organize them into thematic units, or present them in chronological order...&quot;. &quot;Surat Al-Qalam&quot; is a Meccan sura and meccan suras are chronologically earlier suras that were revealed to Muhammad at Mecca before the hijrah to Medina in 622 CE. They are typically shorter, with relatively short &quot;ayat&quot;, and mostly come near the end of the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s 114 surahs. Most of the surahs containing &quot;muqatta&#x27;at&quot; are Meccan. Henceforth apart from traditions, this surah qualifies to be Meccan typically. According to some classical traditions, commentaries and tafsirs the proposed order is 2nd in place right after Muhammad&#x27;s first revelation. The supporting argument of this surah being the second revelation is that Arabs were unaware of angels in the time of Jahiliyyah and news of Muhammad&#x27;s first revelation made them curious about the sanity of Muhammad, thus to refute this idea God revealed the first seven ayaat of Surah Qalam.

On the other hand, the latest suggested order is 18th place according to Theodor Nöldeke and John Medows Rodwell setting the order band from 2nd to 18th. Sayyid Qutb (d. 1966), who was an Egyptian author, Islamist of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, in his Magnum opus &quot;Fi Zilal al-Qur&#x27;an&quot; (In the shades of the Qur&#x27;an) highlights a very interesting fact that the opening and the ending of the surah tackle the same point, therefore it is not possible to identify a specific time of revelation. George Sale estimates the revelation to be from fourth year of Islam.

The major scholars of Islam agree (Ijma) however that this is one of the earliest surahs to be revealed at Makkah. Muhammad Asad (2 July 1900 – 20 February 1992) a Jewish-born Austro-Hungarian journalist, traveler, writer, linguist, political theorist, diplomat and Islamic scholar, said:

In the chronological order of revelation, this surah most probably occupies the third place. Some authorities – among them Suyuti – incline to the view that it was revealed immediately after the first five verses of surah 96 (&quot;The Germ-Cell&quot;); this, however, is contradicted by some of the best-authenticated traditions, according to which most of surah 74 came second in the order of revelation (see introductory note to that surah). In any case, &quot;The Pen&quot; is undoubtedly one of the oldest parts of the Qur&#x27;an.
 —Muhammad Asad – The Message of The Qur&#x27;an 1980 

==Coherence with adjacent surahs==
The idea of textual relation between the verses of a chapter has been discussed under various titles such as &quot;nazm&quot; and &quot;munasabah&quot; in non-English literature and &quot;coherence&quot;, &quot;text relations&quot;, &quot;intertextuality&quot;, and &quot;unity&quot; in English literature. Hamiduddin Farahi, an Islamic scholar of the Indian subcontinent, is known for his work on the concept of nazm, or coherence, in the Quran. Fakhruddin al-Razi (died 1209 CE), Zarkashi (died 1392) and several other classical as well as contemporary Quranic scholars have contributed to the studies.

===Connection with previous surah===
Surah Al-Mulk (67) and Surah Qalam (68) form a pair with regard to their subject matter. Thus there is no principal difference between the central themes and topics of the two. The difference lies in the style, nature of arguments and the tone adopted. In Surah Mulk, the Quraysh are warned of the Day of Judgement, while in Surah Qalam they are warned of the punishment which a people necessarily face if they deny their punishment of the Day of Judgement, similar is the warning sounded in this sūrah. However, this sūrah is more stern in its tone. surah Mulk focused on believing in Allah, this surah Qalam focuses on believing in His Messenger, Muhammad.

===Connection with next surah===
Surah Al-Haaqqa (69) also deeply resembles Surah Qalam (68), both having same the central theme: substantiation of the Day of Judgement. However, the nature of arguments differ. Just as the greatness and truth of the Qur&#x27;an are explained in the surah Qalam (68) and people are warned of the consequences of rejecting the Qur&#x27;an, similarly, in the next surah (69) this subject is discussed. The difference is that in surah 68, it is discussed in the opening part while in surah 69 it is in the concluding part. (Javed Ahmad Ghamidi (born 1951), a Pakistani Muslim theologian, Quran scholar, exegete, and educationist). Near the end of surah Qalam, Allah says: &quot;then leave Me (to deal) with the one who rejects this Hadeeth/Statement.“ and in the beginning of surah Al-Haaqqa, Allah tells how He dealt with previous nations (ʿĀd and Thamud) who rejected and oppressed the Messenger of Allah who came to them. Allah mentioned two groups of people briefly in surah Qalam; i.e. in Ayah 38 He mentions the people of Paradise, and in ayah 42 He mentions people who will not be able to prostrate/sajdah to Allah. Allah talks about two groups of people who receive their books on Judgment Day, good and bad.

==Theme of the surah==
There are almost seven divisions in the Qur&#x27;an according to Themes. The last of these seven sections goes from surah Al-Mulk [surah number 67] to surah Al-Nas [surah number 114]. This final part [last seventh of the Quran] focuses on sources of reflection, people, final scenes they will face on Judgment Day and hellfire and paradise in general and admonition to the Quraysh about their fate in the present and the hereafter if they deny Muhammad, specifically. The surah carries the theme &quot;Let the good carry on their work, in spite of abuse of Companions of Evil: let all remember Allah, before Whom all men are on trial.&quot; True judgement comes from Allah, and not from the false standards of men. Muhammad is addressed as if to say: &quot;The disbelievers call you a madman whereas the Book that you are presenting and the sublime conduct that you practise are by themselves sufficient to refute their false accusations. Soon they will see as to who was mad and who was sane.&quot;

The disbelievers are admonished that well-being in the hereafter inevitably belongs to those who are God-conscious. It is utterly against reason that in the hereafter, the obedient servants should meet the same fate as the guilty. Those who are being called upon to bow before God in the world and refuse to do so, would be unable to prostrate themselves on the Day of Resurrection, even if they wanted to do so, and thus would stand disgraced and condemned. They have no reasonable ground for opposing the Prophet Muhammad, they cannot either make the claim that they know with certainty that he is not a true messenger of God, nor that what he says is false.

In conclusion, Muhammad has been exhorted: &quot;Bear with patience the hardships that you may have to face in the way of preaching the Faith until Allah&#x27;s judgement arrives, and avoid the impatience which caused suffering and affliction to Jonah.&quot;

==Subject matter of the surah==
This surah opens with the single discrete Arabic letter Nun (letter) and the oath of the Divine One swearing by the instrument of The Pen, as well as all knowledge that people are able to preserve and communicate thereby, is split into three parts according to the subject matter:
* 1st part – Defending Muhammad. Allah has declared Muhammad to be of the highest moral character and Do not yield any disbelieving oath monger, slanderer and wicked person.
* 2nd part – The example of companions of the Garden [aS-haab al Jannah]. What happened to the arrogant stingy owners of a garden who did not want to pay charity?
* 3rd part – Harshly rebuking those who deny life after death. The disbelievers would say that – if hypothetically there is a life in the next world, &quot;What is preventing us from being in power in the next world, just as we are in power in this world?&quot;a – Response: Do you think that Allah is so unjust that He cannot see the difference between the one who is right (and submits to Him) and the one who is wrong (disbelieves in His signs)? b - Allah challenges the disbelievers that if there is no next life, or that the disbelievers will be successful in the next life, then produce your evidence or proof that this is true. c – the surah begins with Allah defending His Messenger, and then ends with consoling him. Consolation from Allah to the Islamic prophet Muhammad is; And do not rush (don&#x27;t become impatient). Why? Because there was another Messenger – Prophet Yunus (Jonah) – the companion of the Whale (saahib-il Hoot). He became a little bit impatient for the help of Allah to arrive/he rushed a little bit.

==Hadith==
* Alqamah ibn Waqqas and Al-Aswad ibn Yazid said: A man came to Ibn Mas&#x27;ud. He said: I recite the mufassal surahs in one rak&#x27;ah. You might recite it quickly as one recites verse (poetry) quickly, or as the dried dates fall down (from the tree). But the Prophet (pbuh) used to recite two equal surahs in one rak&#x27;ah; he would recite (for instance) surahs an-Najm (53) and ar-Rahman (55) in one rak&#x27;ah, surahs Iqtarabat (54) and al-Haqqah (69) in one rak&#x27;ah, surahs at-Tur (52) and adh-Dhariyat (51) in one rak&#x27;ah, surahs al-Waqi&#x27;ah (56) and Nun (68) in one rak&#x27;ah, surahs al-Ma&#x27;arij (70) and an-Nazi&#x27;at (79) in one rak&#x27;ah, surahs al-Mutaffifin (83) and Abasa (80) in one rak&#x27;ah, surahs al-Muddaththir (74) and al-Muzzammil (73) in one rak&#x27;ah, surahs al-Insan (76) and al-Qiyamah (75) in one rak&#x27;ah, surahs an-Naba&#x27; (78) and al-Mursalat (77) in one rak&#x27;ah, and surahs ad-Dukhan (44) and at-Takwir (81) in one rak&#x27;ah.
* The Messenger of Allah said, &quot;dajjal (the Antichrist) will appear in my Ummah and he will stay in the world for forty. I do not know whether this will be forty days or forty months or forty years. Allah will then send (Prophet) &#x27;Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). &#x27;Isa will pursue him and slaughter him. Then people will survive for seven years (i.e., after the demise of &#x27;Isa) in the state that there will be no rancour between two persons. Then Allah will send a cool breeze from the side of Ash-Sham. None will remain upon the face of the earth having the smallest particle of good or Faith in him but he will die, so much so that even if someone amongst you will enter the innermost part of a mountain, this breeze will reach that place also and will cause him to die. Only the wicked people will survive and they will be as fast as birds (i.e., to commit evil) and as ferocious towards one another as wild beasts. They will never appreciate the good, nor condemn evil. Then Shaitan (Satan) will come to them in the garb of a man and will say: &#x27;Will you not obey me?&#x27; They will say: &#x27;What do you order us to do?&#x27; He will command them to worship idols. They will have abundance of sustenance and will lead comfortable lives. Then the Trumpet will be blown. Every one hearing it, will turn his neck towards it and will raise it. The first one to hear that Trumpet will be a man who will be busy repairing the basin for his camels. He will become unconscious. Allah will send, or will cause to send, rain which will be like dew and there will grow out of it (like wild growth) the bodies of the people. Then the second Trumpet will be blown and they will stand up and begin to look around. Then it will be said: &#x27;O people! Go to your Rubb.&#x27; Then there will be a command: &#x27;Make them stand there.&#x27; After it they will be called to account. Then it will be said: &#x27;Separate from them the share of the Fire.&#x27; It will be asked: &#x27;How much?&#x27; It will be said: &#x27;Nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand.&#x27; That will be the Day which will make children hoary-headed men because of its terror and that will be the &quot;Day when the Shin will be uncovered&quot;.&quot;
* Narrated Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri: We said, &quot;O Allah&#x27;s Messenger (ﷺ)! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&quot; He said, &quot;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon when the sky is clear?&quot; We said, &quot;No.&quot; He said, &quot;So you will have no difficulty! For seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon (in a clear sky).&quot; ...When there remain only those who used to worship Allah (solely), both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, it will be said to them, &#x27;What keeps you here when all the people have gone?&#x27; They will say, &#x27;We parted with them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today, we heard the call of one proclaiming, &#x27;Let every nation follow what they used to worship,&#x27; and now we are waiting for our Lord.&#x27; Then the Almighty will come to them in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, &#x27;I am your Lord,&#x27; and they will say, &#x27;You are not our Lord.&#x27; And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and then it will be said to them, &#x27;Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?&#x27; They will say. &quot;The Shin,&#x27; and so Allah will then uncover His Shin&quot; whereupon every believer will prostrate before Him and there will remain those who used to prostrate before Him just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate but their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not be able to prostrate). Then the bridge will be laid across Hell...

<doc id="1103136" wikidata="Q276089" url="?curid=1103136" title="Libya national football team">
<text>The Libya national football team () represents Libya in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Libyan Football Federation. The team has never qualified for FIFA World Cup but has qualified for editions of the Africa Cup of Nations in 1982, 2006, and 2012. In 1982, the team was both the host and runner-up. In the Arab Cup, Libya finished second in 1964 and 2012, and third in 1966. The team is affiliated with both FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF).

Due to political circumstances, Libya has typically been less successful in international competition compared to other North African teams like Algeria, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia. Libya has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup and its participation in AFCON is sporadic, having only qualified for three AFCON editions.

Since the 2010s, Libya&#x27;s global ranking has improved due to the increasing number of Libyan players playing in foreign leagues. In the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, the team recorded their first-ever win in the tournament outside Libya. Their FIFA world ranking rose to a high of 36 in September 2012; Libya then won a gold medal in the 2014 African Nations Championship. However, the Libyan Civil War caused the stoppage of the Libyan Premier League and severely disrupted domestic affairs. Libya was eliminated in the first round of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations qualification by Rwanda and failed to qualify for the 2016 African Nations Championship as the defending champions.

==History==

===Early history===
Libya&#x27;s national team was first initiated in 1918, but did not play an official international until 3 August 1953, when they defeated Palestine 5–2 in the first Arab Games in 1953. The team&#x27;s first manager was Masoud Zantouny, and the first foreign manager was Englishman James Bingham, who took charge of the Libyan national team for the 1961 Arab Games. The first player ever to score for the Libyan national team in an official international was Mukhtar Ghonaay.

The first penalty ever scored by a member of the national team was in the 1953 Arab Games group stage; in the match against Egypt, Ali Zantouny scored in the 3–2 defeat. The national team&#x27;s first participation in the Arab Cup was in 1964, the second edition of the competition, held in Kuwait.

The first ever player to score for the Libyan national team in a non-official international was Mustapha Makki in a warm-up friendly played prior to the 1953 Arab Games tournament, played against Palestine in Alexandria in 1952. The national team&#x27;s first attempt to qualify for an Olympic football tournament was in 1967, where they played their first qualification match against Niger in an attempt to qualify for the 1968 Olympic football tournament in Mexico City.

===World Cups===
Libya first entered the FIFA World Cup qualifiers in 1970. Their early attempts failed, but during the 1980s the national side strengthened. The country&#x27;s geopolitical position, however, affected the football team, who had to withdraw from qualifying for the 1982 and 1990 World Cups.

Libya came closest to qualifying for the World Cup in 1986. They came to within a game of reaching the finals in Mexico. After winning their match against Sudan in their first game, the Libyans beat Ghana in the next round before taking on Morocco for a place at the finals. Morocco won the first game 3–0 and went through, even though Libya won the return leg 1–0.

After not entering the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cup competition, Libya came back in the qualifying competition for Korea/Japan. The Libyans advanced to the second round at the expense of Mali, who were beaten 4–3 on aggregate. In the group stage, Libya managed only two draws in eight games.

In the qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, a 9–0 two-legged victory against São Tome and Principe put the Libyans through to the group stage. Libyan player Al-Saadi Gaddafi was banned from the team after failing drug test.

A difficult group followed containing Egypt, Cameroon and Ivory Coast, the eventual group winners and qualifiers for the World Cup. However, The Knights were able to secure good results against these sides, as they beat Egypt 2–1 in Tripoli, and held Cameroon and Ivory Coast to 0–0 draws, helping them to a 4th-place finish and a place at the 2006 African Cup of Nations finals in Egypt.

During the qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Libya defeated each side in the second round during home matches (they also defeated Lesotho away). However they were defeated by Gabon in an away match, and failed to qualify to the next round on goal difference.

In the qualifying campaign for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Libya reached the final match in the group stage without a defeat. They were defeated 1–0 by Cameroon and failed to advance to the final round.

In the qualifying campaign for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Libya defeated Rwanda 4–1 on aggregate in the second round but were eliminated after losing the first three matches in the group stages.

===African Cup Of Nations===

====Libya 1982====
The biggest football tournament to be held in Libya was the 1982 African Cup of Nations. Libya qualified automatically as hosts and were put in a group alongside Ghana, Cameroon and Tunisia. The opening match of the tournament saw the hosts take on Ghana in Tripoli in a 2–2 draw. A 2–0 win over Tunisia and a goalless draw against Cameroon saw Libya topping the group.

In the semi-finals, Libya came from behind to beat Zambia 2–1 and set up another match with Ghana, this time in the final on 19 March. Ghana scored first in the 35th minute, but Libya equalised in the 70th. This was followed by a tense period of extra time in which no goals were scored. In a long penalty shootout, Ghana came out triumphant 7–6.

====Egypt 2006====
Libya&#x27;s second African Cup of Nations saw a return to the higher levels of the international footballing scene at the 2006 African Cup of Nations finals in Egypt. They qualified for the competition after a goalless draw with Sudan in their ninth qualifying match.

Libya were drawn in Group A with Egypt (the hosts and eventual winners), 2006 World Cup-qualifiers Ivory Coast and Morocco. Libya lost 3–0 to Egypt in Cairo, then lost 2–1 to Ivory Coast. A goalless draw against Morocco saw Libya finish bottom of the group.

===Post-Gaddafi era===
Libya played its first match after the Battle of Tripoli (and thus the end of the Gaddafi era in Libya) on 3 September 2011, with a new uniform sporting the National Transitional Council flag of Libya.

The match, part of the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualification campaign, resulted in a 1–0 victory over Mozambique. The historic goal was scored by Rabee&#x27;a al Laafi. Like Libya&#x27;s previous home match, a 3–0 defeat of Comoros in qualifying, played in Stade 26 mars in Bamako, Mali, a relocation was necessary due to the ongoing Libyan Civil War, and so the Petro Sport Stadium in Cairo, Egypt became the venue. The match was played behind closed doors for security reasons.

Prior to the team&#x27;s final game in the qualification campaign, against Zambia, coach Marcos Paquetá claimed that the team was now &quot;not only playing for football success but for a new government and a new country&quot;. The match was played on 8 October 2011, and resulted in a 0–0 draw which was good enough for both teams to qualify. Paquetá and his team danced and celebrated afterwards.

In November 2011 the team travelled to the United Arab Emirates to play a friendly match against Belarus organized by FIFA and broadcast Dubai Sports. The team members, along with the Libyan national chess team, also attended an event at the Libyan Consulate in Dubai organized to honour their contribution to their country in the field of sports.

On 7 June 2013, Libya met DR Congo in its first match on home ground in two years.

====2012 Africa Cup of Nations====
Having qualified, Libya were drawn into Group A with co-hosts Equatorial Guinea, qualification rivals Zambia and pre-tournament favourites Senegal.

The Mediterranean Knights&#x27; first game, the tournament&#x27;s opening match, saw them lose to an 87th-minute winner from ex-Real Madrid winger Javier Ángel Balboa. Libya went on to secure a 2–2 draw with Zambia in terrible conditions at the Estadio de Bata, before two goals from Ihaab al Bousseffi guided them to a 2–1 victory over Senegal, their first Nations Cup win in 30 years and a first on foreign soil. After four points from three games Libya was eliminated at the group stage.

====2014 African Nations Championship Final====

Libya played Ghana in the 2014 CHAN final. Extra time was given (two 15 minutes), however both teams failed to score. It was taken to penalty shootouts, where the Libyan team scored the first three penalties, missed two others and scored the final sixth and their Ghanaian opponents missed the first two, scored the next three then missed the final sixth penalty (resulting in 3 penalties scored). The match finished (0–0) and was won by the Mediterranean Knights by penalties (4–3).

====Coaching crisis====

After Javier Clemente&#x27;s dismissal in 2016, Jalal Damja took over the national team. He left in 2017 after his contract expired. Omar Almaryami was later appointed as coach and led Libya to the semi-finals of the 2018 African Nations Championship. After Libya&#x27;s elimination by Morocco, Adel Amrouche was appointed in May 2018. His goal was to help Libya qualify for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. He led Libya to a 0–0 draw against South Africa away from home. However, days before Libya&#x27;s match against Nigeria, Amrouche suddenly left the team&#x27;s camp and later resigned. During an interview with Reuters, Amrouche said that the reason for his resignation was that the Libyan Football Federation was repeatedly interfering with his work as a coach. He also cited unpaid wages as a reason for his resignation.

Omar Almaryami was again appointed as a caretaker coach of Libya. The team lost twice to Nigeria (4–0 away, 3–2 home) and Almaryami was replaced by former striker Fawzi Al-Issawi, who led Libya to an 8–1 away win over Seychelles. However, Libya later lost to South Africa 2–1, and Libya failed to qualify for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. It was noted during the match that al-Issawi&#x27;s assistant, Abu Bakr Bani was the one who made substitutions and instructed players, leaving many to wonder who was the actual coach.

After the match against South Africa, Jalal Damja was reappointed as the head coach for temporary matches in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification before Faouzi Benzarti was named as new coach of Libya. Under Benzarti, Libya opened their campaign with a disastrous 1–4 loss to Tunisia, the home of Benzarti, before managed to salvage an important 2–1 win over Tanzania to gain hope for qualifying to an AFCON tournament since 2012. Yet, managerial crisis once again erupted when Benzarti left the team and Libya had to appoint a local coach, Ali El Margini, in charge against Equatorial Guinea, a team that had not won a single game in the qualification. Internal instability proved to be a rupture, as Libya lost two consecutive games against the Central African opponent and fell out of top two position. El Margini left after losing all three of his games in charge. He was replaced by Zoran Filipović, who led a team of domestic players into the 2020 African Nations Championship. Libya were eliminated in the group stage after two draws and a loss in three games. Defeats in their final two AFCON qualifiers saw Filipovic sacked in May 2021. Javier Clemente was reappointed as head coach shortly afterwards.

==Kits==

In the Gaddafi era the National team used to play its home matches wearing the green coloured kit representing the Flag of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. However, after the Libyan Civil War in 2011, Libya changed its flag to the new one which was used from 1951 to 1969 back when Libya was a Kingdom. This change resulted in changing the national team&#x27;s kit in order to represent the new flag. The team played its home matches with colours: Red, Black and Green (as in the flag). Red dominates the strip and is the sole jersey colour. The away colours were white in both eras. Since 2011, the LFF emblem and the national team&#x27;s badge was changed into the current design. The previous badge was two balls in front of green coloured Libya&#x27;s map which is also in front of a sun.

During late 2011 and early 2012 the Libyan team wore white jerseys temporarily in their qualification games and 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. However, in mid-2012 the team began to use red jerseys.
In 2014, Libya replaced the green socks worn by the players with black ones.

Adidas is the supplier of the official team strip.

==Home stadium==
The Tripoli Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Tripoli, Libya. It can hold 80,000 spectators.

It was the main venue used by the Libyan national football team in its FIFA World Cup and African Nations Cup qualifying matches as well as friendlies and other international games.

The stadium hosted many games of the 1982 African Cup of Nations held in Libya along with the 28 March Stadium in Benghazi.

The 28 March Stadium in Benghazi was also used by the national team sometimes.

FIFA lifted the ban on Libyan stadiums in 2013, during the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. However, it was re-imposed in 2014 due to increased security concerns. The Libyan national team was forced to host games in neighboring countries such as Algeria, Morocco, Egypt or Tunisia (Tunisia the most popular choice due to its close distance to Libya).

Libya played their first home game since 2013 at the Martyrs of February Stadium in Benghazi against Tunisia on 25 March 2021, where they lost 2–5.

==Rivalries==
Libya&#x27;s only real rivalries are with its fellow North African footballing nations, Algeria, Morocco, Egypt and, mainly, Tunisia. Matches between Libya and any one of these opponents are highly charged encounters. Libya defeated Egypt 2–1 in a World Cup qualifier on 8 October 2004, the Pharaohs only managed to beat the Libyans on their own turf twice. The rivalry was rekindled at the 2007 Arab Games, where the teams drew 0–0; Egypt eventually claimed the gold medal on goal difference from the Libyans.

Libya also has a rivalry with Morocco. Libya&#x27;s last win against Morocco was during the 1986 World Cup qualifiers, which Libya won 1–0. A friendly was played between both countries on the 11th of October 2019 in which they tied. Matches between Libya and Tunisia are also very tense, the last time they played was a 5–2 win from the latter in the African Cup of Nations qualification group stage round.

<text>Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma (; born 12 April 1942) is a South African politician who served as the fourth president of South Africa from 2009 to 2018. He is also referred to by his initials JZ and clan names Nxamalala and Msholozi. Zuma was a former anti-apartheid activist, member of uMkhonto weSizwe, and president of the African National Congress (ANC) from 2007 to 2017.

Zuma was born in the rural region of Nkandla, which is now part of the KwaZulu-Natal province and the centre of Zuma&#x27;s support base. He joined the ANC at the age of 17 in 1959 and spent ten years in Robben Island Prison as a political prisoner. He went into exile in 1975 and was ultimately appointed head of the ANC&#x27;s intelligence department. After the ANC was unbanned in 1990, he quickly rose through the party&#x27;s national leadership and became deputy secretary general in 1991, national chairperson in 1994, and deputy president in 1997. He was the deputy president of South Africa from 1999 to 2005 under President Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela&#x27;s successor. Mbeki dismissed Zuma on 14 June 2005 after Zuma&#x27;s financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, was convicted of making corrupt payments to Zuma in connection with the Arms Deal. Zuma was charged with corruption and was also acquitted on rape charges in the highly publicised 2006 trial. He managed to retain the support of a left-wing coalition inside the ANC, which allowed him to remove Mbeki as ANC president in December 2007 at the ANC&#x27;s Polokwane elective conference.

Zuma was elected president of South Africa in the 2009 general election and took office on 9 May. The criminal charges against him were formally withdrawn the same week. As president, he launched the R4-trillion National Infrastructure Plan and signed a controversial nuclear power deal with the Russian government, which was blocked by the Western Cape High Court in 2017. As a former member of the South African Communist Party, he increasingly relied on left-wing populist rhetoric, and in his 2017 State of the Nation address he announced a new policy of &quot;radical economic transformation&quot;. Among the few policies implemented before the end of his presidency were land expropriation without compensation, free higher education, a series of attempted structural reforms in key sectors involving restrictions on foreign ownership, and more stringent black economic empowerment requirements. In the international arena, Zuma emphasised South-South cooperation and economic diplomacy. The admission of South Africa to the BRICS grouping has been described as a major triumph for Zuma, and he has been praised for his HIV/AIDS policy.

Zuma&#x27;s presidency was beset by controversy, especially during his second term. In 2014, the Public Protector found that Zuma had improperly benefited from state expenditure on upgrades to his Nkandla homestead, and in 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled that Zuma had failed to uphold the Constitution, leading to calls for his resignation and a failed impeachment attempt in the National Assembly. By early 2016, there were also widespread allegations, later investigated by the Zondo Commission, that the Gupta family had acquired immense corrupt influence over Zuma&#x27;s administration, amounting to state capture. Several weeks after Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa was elected to succeed Zuma as ANC president in December 2017, the ANC National Executive Committee recalled Zuma. After a fifth vote of no confidence in Parliament, he resigned on 14 February 2018 and was replaced by Ramaphosa the next day.

Shortly after his resignation, on 16 March 2018, the National Prosecuting Authority announced that it would reinstate corruption charges against Zuma in relation to the 1999 Arms Deal. He pleaded not guilty on 26 May 2021, but the trial was not scheduled to take place until early 2023. The trial has since been set for April 2025. In a separate matter, in June 2021, the Constitutional Court convicted Zuma of contempt of court for his failure to comply with a court order compelling his testimony before the Zondo Commission. He was sentenced to 15 months&#x27; imprisonment and was arrested on 7 July 2021 in Estcourt, KwaZulu-Natal. However, he was released on medical parole two months later on 5 September. The high court rescinded his parole on 15 December. The parole was declared unlawful by the Supreme Court of Appeal, but it allowed the Department of Correctional Services to consider whether to deduct the time spent under it from his sentence. On 11 August 2023, the Department of Correctional Services granted Zuma remission of his 15-month sentence.

==Early life==
Zuma was born in Nkandla, Natal Province (now part of the province of KwaZulu-Natal), and often moved around Natal and the suburbs of Durban as a child. His father, Nobhekisisa, was a policeman who died when Zuma was five, and his mother, Geinamazwi, was a domestic worker. His middle name, Gedleyihlekisa, means &quot;one who smiles while causing you harm&quot; in Zulu. He did not receive formal schooling.

He has at least three brothers—Michael, Joseph, and Khanya—and at least one sister—Velephi. Michael Zuma was employed by Khumbula Property Services, a construction company, and in 2011 admitted to using his elder brother Jacob&#x27;s political status to secure a government contract for the company in exchange for a homestead in Nkandla. 

==Anti-apartheid activism==

=== Imprisonment and exile ===
Zuma began engaging in anti-apartheid politics at an early age and joined the ANC in 1959. He became an active member of uMkhonto we Sizwe in 1962, two years after the ANC was banned. That year, he was arrested with a group of 45 recruits near Zeerust in western Transvaal, currently part of the North West Province. Zuma was convicted of conspiring to overthrow the apartheid government and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, which he served on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela and other notable ANC leaders also imprisoned during that time. While imprisoned, Zuma was a referee for prisoners association football games, organised by the prisoners own governing body, Makana F.A.

After his release from prison, Zuma re-established ANC underground structures in Natal. He left South Africa in 1975 and was initially based in Swaziland where he met Thabo Mbeki. In Mozambique, he dealt with the arrival of thousands of exiles seeking military training in the wake of the 1976 Soweto uprising. He became a full member of the ANC National Executive Committee in 1977, and a member of the ANC&#x27;s Politico-Military Council when it was formed in 1983. He was also Deputy Chief Representative of the ANC in Mozambique, a post he occupied until the signing of the Nkomati Accord between the Mozambican and South African governments in 1984. After the Accord was signed, he was appointed as ANC Chief Representative in Mozambique. In December 1986, the South African government requested that Mozambican authorities expel six senior members of the ANC, including Zuma. He was forced to leave Mozambique in January 1987, so he moved to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, where he was appointed Head of the ANC&#x27;s underground structures, and shortly afterward was named chief of the intelligence department.

Zuma was also a member of the South African Communist Party (SACP). He joined in 1963, served briefly on the party&#x27;s Politburo, and left in 1990.

===Return from exile===
After the ANC was unbanned in February 1990, Zuma returned to South Africa on 21 March to begin the negotiations process. He was one of the first ANC leaders to return to South Africa for negotiations. Later that year, he was elected unopposed as the ANC&#x27;s Southern Natal Chairperson. Zuma, as a Zulu, became known as a leading peace broker in Natal during the political violence of this period that was concentrated in that province, and arose largely from conflict between nationalist supporters of the then Xhosa-dominated ANC and supporters of the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). He is also credited with having expanded the ANC&#x27;s Zulu support base in Natal. At the ANC&#x27;s July 1991 elective conference, Zuma stood for the post of ANC Secretary-General and lost to Cyril Ramaphosa, but was elected Deputy Secretary-General, comfortably beating Alfred Nzo and Popo Molefe in a vote.

In the 1994 general election, South Africa&#x27;s first democratic election, Zuma stood as the ANC&#x27;s candidate for the premiership of his newly constituted home province, KwaZulu-Natal. The ANC rose to power in the elections, with Mandela elected president and Mbeki his deputy, but lost KwaZulu-Natal to the IFP. Zuma became a member of the executive council (MEC) for economic affairs and tourism in KwaZulu-Natal. In December 1994, he was elected ANC provincial chairperson for KwaZulu-Natal, and at the ANC&#x27;s 1994 elective conference he was elected national chairperson, beating Pallo Jordan and Jeff Radebe by a large margin. He held both positions until 1997, having been re-elected provincial chairperson in 1996.

== Rise to the presidency ==
===Deputy presidency===
Zuma was elected deputy president of the ANC at the party&#x27;s 50th National Conference in Mafikeng in December 1997, and was subsequently appointed deputy president of South Africa in June 1999, pursuant to the 1999 general election. Zuma served under newly elected President Mbeki and was the chief mediator in the Burundi peace process, in which he worked with Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, who chaired the Great Lakes Regional Initiative, a grouping of regional presidents overseeing the peace process in Burundi.

In late 2002, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) announced that Zuma was one of several ANC politicians under investigation by the Scorpions for corruption related to the R30-billion Arms Deal, a major defence procurement package which the government had signed months after Zuma&#x27;s appointment to the deputy presidency. In August 2003, however, National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Bulelani Ngcuka told the media that the NPA had a &quot;prima facie case of corruption&quot; against Zuma but had decided not to prosecute on the basis that the case was unlikely to be won. A highly public spat ensued between Zuma allies and Ngcuka, who was accused by Moe Shaik and Mac Maharaj of having been an apartheid spy, an accusation later dismissed by the specially appointed Hefer Commission. Zuma laid a misconduct complaint against Ngcuka with the Public Protector, Lawrence Mushwana, who in May 2004 found that Ngcuka&#x27;s statement to the media had been &quot;unfair and improper&quot;.

Mbeki and Zuma were both re-elected in the 2004 general election, but on 14 June 2005, Mbeki removed Zuma from his post as deputy president following the conviction of Zuma&#x27;s associate, Schabir Shaik, for making underhanded payments to Zuma in relation to the Arms Deal. Mbeki told a joint sitting of Parliament that &quot;in the interest of the honourable Deputy President, the government, our young democratic system and our country, it would be best to release the honourable Jacob Zuma from his responsibilities&quot;. Zuma also resigned as a member of Parliament.

His successor as deputy president of South Africa was Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Ngcuka&#x27;s wife. Mlambo-Ngcuka had been minister of minerals and energy since 1999. Her appointment was booed publicly at ANC rallies by Zuma supporters, including at a Women&#x27;s Day event in Utrecht, KwaZulu-Natal.

=== First corruption indictment ===

Soon after Zuma&#x27;s dismissal, the NPA announced its intention to instate formal corruption charges against him. He was served with a provisional indictment on fraud and corruption charges in November 2005, mirroring the indictment earlier served on Shaik. However, the NPA was unprepared to serve the final indictment and filed an application for postponement. On 20 September 2006, the Pietermaritzburg High Court dismissed the application, and when the NPA indicated that it was not prepared to proceed with the trial, the matter was stricken off.

=== Rape trial ===
In December 2005, Zuma was charged with raping a 31-year-old woman, known to the public by the pseudonym Khwezi. The incident allegedly occurred on 2 November 2005 at Zuma&#x27;s home in Forest Town, Johannesburg. When the trial began on 6 March 2006, Zuma pleaded not guilty, claiming that he and Khwezi had consensual sex. He was acquitted on 8 May 2006 following a highly publicised trial. Zuma&#x27;s admission was controversial, as he stated that he had not used a condom while having sex with Khwezi, despite knowing she was HIV-positive and having been, as deputy president, the head of the National AIDS Council and Moral Regeneration Campaign. He told the court that he had taken a shower after the act, claiming that doing so reduced the risk of HIV transmission. The South African comic strip &quot;Madam &amp; Eve,&quot; and political cartoonist Zapiro, repeatedly lampooned Zuma for his testimony, and Zuma now always appears under a showerhead in Zapiro cartoons.

=== Continued popularity ===
Although Zuma had been fired as national deputy president, he retained the ANC deputy presidency, and internal factions began to coalesce around him and Mbeki. Between 2005 and 2007, their rivalry deepened into what Susan Booysen called &quot;a brutal and all-consuming disagreement between two major ANC groupings&quot;. Although the corruption and rape allegations were considered politically damaging, Zuma continued to enjoy considerable support from left-wing elements of the ANC, especially the ANC Youth League under Fikile Mbalula, and from the ANC&#x27;s partners in the Tripartite Alliance, the SACP, and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). Blade Nzimande of the SACP and Zwelinzima Vavi of COSATU were among Zuma&#x27;s chief organisers and most vocal supporters (though both recanted their support years later). Vavi and Youth League leader Julius Malema later said that they were prepared to &quot;kill for Zuma&quot;. Nzimande and his SACP comrade Gwede Mantashe warned that the corruption trial would endanger public stability if it went ahead, although there were reports that support for Zuma had caused a rift within the SACP. While Zuma&#x27;s political strength was at least partly based on his relationships within intra-party politics and Mbeki&#x27;s lack of popularity with the left wing, he also had a large Zulu support base, and one analyst argued that his supporters&#x27; loyalty was partially rooted in a traditionalist Zulu loyalty.

Zuma&#x27;s supporters publicly expressed the view that his dismissal and prosecution were the result of a political conspiracy by Mbeki, who they said had sought to oust Zuma to entrench their dominance in the ANC. Zuma&#x27;s court appearances on the corruption charges drew large crowds of supporters (on one estimate, up to 10,000 at a time), who, on one occasion, burned T-shirts with Mbeki&#x27;s picture on them, which the ANC leadership condemned. Zuma became known for singing the apartheid-era struggle song &quot;Umshini wami&quot; (English: &quot;Bring Me My Machine Gun&quot;) with his supporters during these informal rallies. Likewise, during the rape trial, Zuma supporters gathered outside the courthouse and sometimes clashed with smaller groups of anti-rape protesters. Zuma supporters were seen carrying posters questioning Khwezi&#x27;s integrity, burning photos of her, and on one occasion throwing stones at a woman that they mistook for her.

By October 2008, Zuma had been acquitted of rape and was no longer subject to corruption charges. However, this did little to lighten the rivalry between Mbeki and Zuma. A &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; analysis stated:The political damage [of events of recent months] is incalculable, with the ruling African National Congress now an openly divided and faltering movement. This has had a domino effect on the South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions, which have floundered and fractured in the face of damaging charges against a man they ardently backed as the country&#x27;s next president. The trial has been fought against the backdrop of a bitter succession war between Mbeki and Zuma. Both have been fatally wounded. Mbeki&#x27;s support in the ANC has crumbled... But even Zuma&#x27;s most diehard supporters privately acknowledge that he cannot now be president...

=== Defamation lawsuits ===
By early 2006 during the rape trial, Zuma and his supporters complained of a concerted media plot to discredit him and harm his political career. In March, he appointed a legal team, including former Conservative Party politician Jurg Prinsloo and advocate Wycliffe Mothuloe, to fight his &quot;crucifixion by the media&quot;. Among his targets was the &quot;Sowetan,&quot; whom he told that the media, at the instruction of Ngcuka of the NPA and former Justice Minister Penuell Maduna, was trying to &quot;crucify&quot; him. The newspaper had printed the interview under the headline &quot;I&#x27;m like Christ – Zuma&quot;. In June and July 2006, Zuma filed a series of defamation lawsuits against various South African media outlets for publishing content that allegedly besmirched his public profile in the form of cartoons, commentary, photos and parody pieces. The defendants included the &quot;Star&quot; (sued for R20 million), &quot;Rapport&quot; (R10 million), Highveld Stereo (R7 million), the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; (R6 million), the &quot;Citizen&quot; (R5 million), the &quot;Sunday Sun&quot; (R5 million), the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; (R5 million), and the &quot;Sunday World&quot; (R5 million). Zuma said in 2005:For a period of five years my person has been subjected to all types of allegations and innuendo, paraded through the media and other corridors of influence without these allegations tested. I have thereby been denied my constitutional right to reply and defend myself.In December 2008, Zuma sued Zapiro for R7 million over his controversial rape of Lady Justice cartoon, bringing the total value of the defamation lawsuits to at least R70 million, an unprecedented figure in South African law. Many of the suits were withdrawn or settled out of court. &quot;Rapport&quot; settled for R50,000 over a defamatory reader&#x27;s letter, and the British &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper also paid Zuma substantial damages over defamatory statements.

===Election as ANC president===

As per party tradition, Zuma was in line to succeed Mbeki as head of the party. However, by April 2007 it was clear that Mbeki intended to run for a third term as ANC president. Even though he was prohibited by the Constitution from standing again for the national presidency, the ANC lacks internal term limits. Zuma gained the support of five of the nine provincial ANC branches when they nominated candidates at their provincial congresses in late 2007. He became the favourite to win the presidency and became the ANC&#x27;s presidential candidate in the 2009 elections. While the ANC was extremely likely to win regardless of its candidate, there were reports that Zuma&#x27;s support base and left-wing alliances unnerved international and domestic investors.

On 18 December 2007, at the ANC&#x27;s 52nd National Conference in Polokwane, Limpopo, Zuma was elected ANC president, beating Mbeki with 2,329 votes to 1,505.

=== Second corruption indictment ===
Just over a week after the Polokwane conference, the NPA reinstated charges against Zuma and served him an indictment to stand trial on 12 fraud charges, two corruption charges, and one charge each of racketeering and money laundering. According to the Constitution, he would have been rendered ineligible for the national presidency had he been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment. However, on 12 September 2008, the charges were declared unlawful on a technicality. The presiding judge also expressed a belief that the charges had been the result of a political conspiracy against Zuma.

Although this judgement was later overturned by the appellate court, the Zuma-aligned ANC National Executive, as elected at the Polokwane conference, immediately &quot;recalled&quot; Mbeki, asking him to resign as national president. Mbeki, seeking to avoid a protracted dispute, did so, and was replaced by newly elected ANC Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe, who led an interim administration while Zuma campaigned for the 2009 election.

In January 2009, the Supreme Court of Appeal found that the charges against Zuma were not unlawful, contrary to the ruling of the lower court. However, the NPA formally withdrew the charges in the same week that Zuma was inaugurated as national president, citing apparent evidence of prosecutorial misconduct in the so-called spy tapes.

=== Release of Shaik on parole ===
In March 2009, Shaik was controversially released from prison on medical parole, just over two years into his 15-year sentence. Earlier the same week, Zuma had said publicly that as national president he would pardon Shaik on medical grounds, and denied having played any role in Shaik&#x27;s release. Shaik had applied for a presidential pardon in April 2008 when Mbeki was president, and he continued to lobby for a pardon during Zuma&#x27;s presidency, saying it was unfair that he had been convicted while neither Zuma nor the implicated arms company had been taken to trial.

== President of South Africa (2009–2018) ==

The ANC won the national election on 22 April 2009 by a slightly diminished majority of 65.90%, with Zuma having campaigned under the theme &quot;Continuity and Change&quot;. His appointment was formalised by Parliament on 6 May, and he was sworn in as president of South Africa on 9 May 2009.

=== Failure to disclose assets ===
As president and therefore a member of cabinet, Zuma was required by the government&#x27;s ethics code to declare his financial interests within 60 days of taking office. In March 2010, nine months after taking office, South African media reported that he had failed to do so. Opposition parties and the ANC&#x27;s Tripartite Alliance partner COSATU urged Zuma to disclose his interests, and the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) called for an investigation by the Public Protector. ANC spokesperson Brian Sokutu explained that Zuma constituted a &quot;special case&quot; because of his &quot;large family&quot;, which complicated the process. The ANC distanced itself from Sokutu&#x27;s statement and Zuma filed the disclosure later that week.

=== Domestic policy ===
==== Radical economic transformation ====
As a former member of the SACP, Zuma has described himself as a socialist and became president with the support of a left-wing coalition. Analysts have claimed that he has bolstered populism in South Africa. From 2017, at the tail-end of his presidency, his rhetoric and policy priorities became more leftist under what is known as the &quot;radical economic transformation&quot; (RET) programme of the ANC of this period. Zuma announced the new focus on RET during his February 2017 State of the Nation address. Later that year, he explained that RET had been adopted as ANC policy and therefore as government policy, and defined it as a &quot;fundamental change in the structures, systems, institutions and patterns of ownership and control of the economy, in favour of all South Africans, especially the poor&quot;. The RET policy was controversial, and some critics claimed that it had popular political appeal but lacked substance. Others claimed that it was used to defend &quot;rent-seeking practices&quot; and the influence of the Gupta family on Zuma&#x27;s administration. Zuma claimed that critics of his politics were agents of &quot;white monopoly capital&quot;.

==== Economic reform and spending ====
Zuma was inaugurated in South Africa at the height of the 2008 global financial crisis and amid South Africa&#x27;s first recession since the end of apartheid. Upon taking office, he established the National Planning Commission under the office of the presidency which was chaired by Minister Trevor Manuel. It was responsible for developing the National Development Plan, which was adopted by Zuma&#x27;s cabinet in 2012. Other major initiatives included the Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme, which was launched in 2011 amid electricity generation shortfalls at state energy utility Eskom, and a R4-trillion National Infrastructure Plan launched in 2012. Zuma expressed support for expanding South Africa&#x27;s nuclear power programme, particularly for a nuclear deal with Russian nuclear agency Rosatom which concluded in September 2014 but was ruled unlawful by the Western Cape High Court in 2017.
Zuma&#x27;s administration pursued a number of structural economic policy reforms, but critics characterised them as &quot;investor-unfriendly&quot;, and most were met significant opposition. His reforms included the increased regulation of private security companies. He also increased the regulation of oil, gas, and minerals resources. Furthermore, Zuma announced a proposal to increase black economic empowerment ownership requirements in mines. In 2017, Zuma advanced a proposal for the introduction of a national minimum wage.

Zuma was attentive to land reform issues throughout his second term, but from 2017 he emphasised his support for land expropriation without compensation. While opening the ANC&#x27;s 54th National Conference in December 2017, he unilaterally announced that higher education would be free for students in households whose income was less than R350,000 per year, meeting a central demand of the #FeesMustFall student protests.

South Africa&#x27;s social grants programme expanded under Zuma, and Zuma was praised for his HIV/AIDS policy which has been credited with increasing life expectancy in South Africa. However, his critics claim that his policies increased South Africa&#x27;s debt burden with the debt-to-GDP ratio increasing from 28% at the start of his presidency to just over 50% in the week of his resignation. Nedbank, one of South Africa&#x27;s largest banks, estimates that poor policy decisions, maladministration, and corruption during Zuma&#x27;s second term alone cost the South African economy R470 billion (US$33.7 billion).

Contracts with the consulting firms McKinsey &amp; Company, KPMG, and Deloitte were linked to alleged corruption in state-owned enterprises. McKinsey &amp; Company eventually reached an agreement with the South African government and paid back R1 Billion (US$67.3 million) for problems relating to work done at Eskom, as well as a company linked to the Gupta family. In January 2022 the South African government published the findings of an inquiry into state capture and the consultancy firm Bain &amp; Company stands accused of helping Zuma to undermine the South African tax authority.

=== Foreign policy ===

Zuma&#x27;s first state visit as president was to Angola, where he sought to improve relations with the government of President José Eduardo dos Santos, who had had a tense relationship with Mbeki. His government&#x27;s foreign policy emphasised the developmental objectives of African and Global South countries with a focus on economic diplomacy. It was also characterised by a pivot towards the BRIC, especially China. In December 2010, South Africa became a formal member of BRIC, which was then renamed BRICS, and Zuma attended the group&#x27;s third summit meeting in Sanya, China, in 2011. South Africa&#x27;s admission followed a concerted campaign for membership and has been described as &quot;a huge diplomatic coup&quot; and &quot;the most important foreign policy achievement of the Zuma administration&quot;.During South Africa&#x27;s tenure on the United Nations Security Council, Zuma&#x27;s administration was criticised for deviating in its stance on certain foreign regimes, especially in its attitudes towards international intervention in civil conflicts. It voted in favour of Resolution 1970 and Resolution 1973 but condemned their use by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) as the basis for military intervention in Libya. It also voted in favour of a 2012 resolution calling for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, but established friendly relations with the Assad regime after the 2014 Syrian presidential election. The administration also appeared to vacillate in its response to the disputed 2010 presidential election in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

==== Zimbabwe ====

In Zimbabwe, Mbeki had advocated for non-confrontational &quot;quiet diplomacy&quot; as an alternative to the &quot;megaphone diplomacy&quot; used by Western governments that harshly criticised Robert Mugabe&#x27;s regime. This approach was controversial, with elements of the ruling alliance calling for a tougher stance against Mugabe and the ruling ZANU–PF. In a 2006 interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, Zuma had supported quiet diplomacy and said of Mugabe:The Europeans often ignore the fact that Mugabe is very popular among Africans... The people love him. So how can we condemn him? Many in Africa believe that there is a racist aspect to European and American criticism of Mugabe. Millions of blacks died in Angola, the Republic of Congo and Rwanda. A few whites lost their lives in Zimbabwe, unfortunately, and already the West is bent out of shape.

By December 2007, Zuma was more forthcoming in criticising Zimbabwe&#x27;s leadership, contrasting his own policy to Mbeki&#x27;s, and observing that it was &quot;tragic that other world leaders who witness repression pretend it is not happening, or is exaggerated&quot;. He was critical of the Zimbabwean government&#x27;s behaviour during the disputed March 2008 elections in Zimbabwe and called the delays &quot;suspicious&quot;. In a press conference on 24 June he said, &quot;We cannot agree with ZANU-PF. We cannot agree with them on values. We fought for the right of people to vote, we fought for democracy.&quot; At an ANC dinner in July, he rebuked Mugabe for refusing to step down, and in November he said that the South African Development Community (SADC) should &quot;force&quot; Zimbabwean leaders to reach an agreement, if necessary.

In 2010, Zuma called for international sanctions against Mugabe and his allies to be lifted. After a March 2013 meeting with Mugabe in Pretoria, he highlighted the commonalities between his and Mugabe&#x27;s political parties, telling the press, &quot;We share the same values, we went through the same route... We believe that our positions as former liberation movements need to be consolidated.&quot; Despite tensions in later months, as Zuma and SADC attempted to nudge Mugabe towards democratic reforms, the &quot;Business Day&quot; reported that relations between the countries remained &quot;cordial&quot; throughout Zuma&#x27;s presidency.

==== International Criminal Court ====
South Africa hosted the 25th Summit of the AU in Johannesburg from 7 to 15 June 2015. It was attended by Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, then a fugitive from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which sought to prosecute him on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. South Africa was a signatory to the Rome Statute, which obliged it to arrest al-Bashir, but instead granted him diplomatic immunity while he attended the summit. While the matter was being adjudicated by a South African High Court, and just after Judge President Dunstan Mlambo ordered al-Bashir&#x27;s arrest, the state&#x27;s lawyer told the court that he had left the country. His plane left from Waterkloof Air Force Base, presumably with the government&#x27;s knowledge and reportedly with Zuma&#x27;s explicit approval. When it was criticised for this breach, the South African government argued that the ICC was used unfairly against African heads of state while failing to hold Western leaders to the same standards. In 2016, it announced in New York that it was withdrawing from the ICC, and Zuma&#x27;s administration subsequently tabled legislation to effect the withdrawal.

=== Mandela&#x27;s memorial ===
In a press conference on 5 December 2013, Zuma announced the death of Nelson Mandela, South Africa&#x27;s first democratically elected president. The memorial took place on 10 December 2013 at FNB Stadium near Soweto. When Zuma entered the stadium parts of the crowd booed him loudly. Ramaphosa and Archbishop Desmond Tutu called for discipline, with Ramaphosa telling the crowd in Zulu that the country could address its internal disagreements when foreign dignitaries were not present. Some South African commentators said that the crowd&#x27;s actions were unexpected, and they were widely linked to the ongoing Nkandla scandal, a draft of the Public Protector&#x27;s provisional report had been leaked the previous week, or to dissatisfaction with Zuma&#x27;s administration more generally. Others suggested that the booing reflected frustration with the lack of socioeconomic change under the ANC government since Mandela&#x27;s presidency, or that it reflected enduring divisions within the ANC; the crowd also chanted Mbeki&#x27;s name. In a public statement, the ANC chastised those who had booed, saying they had embarrassed the country. The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) was criticised for having cut away from the booing in its live broadcast of the memorial.

=== Re-election ===
Despite an &quot;Anyone but Zuma&quot; campaign in the run-up to the ANC&#x27;s 53rd National Conference, Zuma was re-elected ANC president on 18 December 2012, beating Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe by a large margin. Although in 2008 he had said that he would prefer to serve only one term as president, Zuma became the ANC&#x27;s sole presidential candidate in the 2014 national election. In January 2014, after he was heckled at Mandela&#x27;s memorial, the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; reported that around November 2013, KwaZulu-Natal branches of the ANC had discussed a proposed resolution asking Zuma not to run for a second term as the country&#x27;s president. However, ANC Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte dismissed rumours of disunity in the ANC saying, &quot;The policy is that the president of the ANC is always the candidate for the election. We don&#x27;t have another candidate and there will be no other candidate.&quot;

The ANC retained its majority in the national election, and on 21 May 2014, the National Assembly elected Zuma to a second term as president.

=== Nkandla homestead ===
Zuma began his second term amid ongoing controversy over what were officially security upgrades made with state funds to his private homestead at Nkandla. Public Protector Thuli Madonsela investigated, and in late November 2013 her draft report was leaked to the &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian.&quot; Similar to the final version of the report, titled &quot;Secure in Comfort&quot; and released on 19 March 2014, the draft found that some of the Nkandla upgrades exceeded Zuma&#x27;s security needs and recommended that Zuma should repay the state. The opposition, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), and DA applied for legal recourse to compel Zuma to follow the recommendations in Madonsela&#x27;s report, and the Constitutional Court found in their favour on 31 March 2016. In &quot;EFF v Speaker; DA v Speaker&quot;, the full court agreed that Madonsela&#x27;s report was binding, meaning Zuma was required to repay the state for some of the Nkandla upgrades and that Zuma had failed to uphold the country&#x27;s Constitution. In a public address on 1 April, Zuma welcomed the judgment and apologised to the country, though legal academic Pierre de Vos said that the statement seriously misconstrued the judgment.

The court&#x27;s finding that Zuma had failed to uphold the Constitution subsequently provided the basis of an impeachment motion in Parliament, which was sponsored by the DA and defeated by a significant margin. However, Zuma faced serious backlash in the aftermath of the Constitutional Court ruling, including criticism from the SACP, civil society, several ANC stalwarts (including Ahmed Kathrada, Ronnie Kasrils, Trevor Manuel, and Cheryl Carolus), and several active factions of the ANC. Before the ruling, Zuma had faced and defeated five motions of no confidence in Parliament, three of which went to a vote. Following the ruling and failed impeachment motion, he faced three more in November 2016, August 2017, and February 2018.

=== State capture allegations ===
Zuma&#x27;s close and allegedly corrupt relationship with the Gupta family, known ANC donors, became a major source of discontent both within the ANC and among the South African public. This relationship received widespread public attention in April 2013 when the media reported that the Guptas had landed an Airbus A330 at Waterkloof Air Force Base without formal authorisation, but was welcomed by a police escort. The political influence of the Guptas was one issue that was thought to have motivated a wave of anti-government protests in October 2015, and at Zuma&#x27;s February 2016 State of the Nation address, the EFF coined the phrase &quot;Zupta&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;Zuma&quot; and &quot;Gupta&quot;, when they disrupted the event by repeatedly chanting &quot;Zupta must fall.&quot; 
In March 2016, allegations of state capture of the Zuma administration by the Gupta family were revived when two ANC politicians, Mcebisi Jonas and Vytjie Mentor, publicly claimed that the Guptas had offered them cabinet positions. The Guptas denied the allegations, as did Zuma who reminded Parliament that only he had the power to appoint ministers. Shortly thereafter, the former director-general of the Government Communication and Information System, Themba Maseko, told the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; that Zuma had asked him to &quot;help&quot; the Guptas and that the Guptas had subsequently asked him to channel government advertising tenders to their newspaper, the &quot;New Age&quot;.

In mid-March 2016, Madonsela launched an investigation into state capture, resulting in a report entitled &quot;State of Capture&quot; in November 2017. The report found &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence implicating Zuma and other state officials in various improprieties, including improper relationships with the Gupta family. It also recommended that Zuma should appoint a full commission of inquiry into state capture. Zuma applied to have Madonsela&#x27;s report overturned in the high court, which dismissed his application and ordered him to appoint a commission. In January 2018, just over a month before he resigned, he established the Zondo Commission.

=== Cabinet reshuffles ===
Zuma was criticised for a lack of stability in his cabinet. During his two terms in office, he implemented twelve cabinet reshuffles, and some of his appointments unsettled financial markets, such as when Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene was replacedwith the little-known backbencher Des van Rooyen in the 9 December 2015 reshuffle. The political response was so hostile that van Rooyen was replaced by Pravin Gordhan after four days in office. Later, on 31 March 2017, Gordhan was sacked and replaced by Malusi Gigaba. Gordhan&#x27;s deputy Jonas, who had alleged corruption by the Guptas a year earlier, was also fired. The reshuffle was criticised by senior ANC leaders including Deputy President Ramaphosa, from the SACP, and from members of the public, who, on 7 April, launched protests against Zuma and his government in several of South Africa&#x27;s major cities. Another march on the Union Buildings on 12 April, Zuma&#x27;s birthday, was organised by a coalition of seven opposition parties. It attracted tens of thousands of protesters and the &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; said that it was &quot;possibly the largest march in post-apartheid history&quot;.

=== Succession ===

==== Succession as ANC president ====

From 2015, Zuma was understood to favour his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to succeed him as ANC president and therefore, presumptively, as national president. His critics claimed that he would use his relationship with Dlamini-Zuma to retain control of the ANC and the state, and avoid prosecution on corruption charges. She campaigned on a platform of economic transformation – so that the pro-Dlamini-Zuma faction became known as the RET faction – while her challenger, Ramaphosa, emphasised anti-corruption. On 18 December 2017, at the ANC&#x27;s 54th National Conference, Ramaphosa narrowly beat Dlamini-Zuma in a vote and succeeded Zuma as ANC president.

==== Resignation ====
Once Ramaphosa replaced Zuma as ANC president, there was growing pressure for the latter to resign from the national presidency. On 6 February 2018, Zuma&#x27;s annual State of the Nation Address, scheduled for 8 February, was postponed indefinitely &quot;to create room for establishing a much more conducive political atmosphere&quot;. The following week, Ramaphosa and Zuma spent almost five days in talks. On 12 December, when it became clear that the negotiations had failed, the ANC National Executive Committee convened an emergency meeting near Pretoria, and, after nearly ten hours of debate, decided that Zuma should be &quot;recalled&quot; by the party if he did not resign voluntarily. Ramaphosa and another senior official reportedly drove to Zuma&#x27;s home just after midnight to deliver the ultimatum, but Zuma refused, insisting on a three-month notice period or transition period before leaving office. On 13 December, the National Executive Committee publicly announced its intention to recall Zuma. As a party-political body, it formally lacked the authority to remove sitting presidents, though it could instruct the ANC caucus, which controlled Parliament, to remove Zuma through a motion of no confidence if he did not resign at its request.

At dawn on 14 February, there was a police raid at the Johannesburg home of the Gupta family, which the Hawks said was related to an investigation into state capture. Baleka Mbete, the Speaker of the National Assembly, announced that the EFF&#x27;s motion of no confidence in Zuma had been moved forward in the parliamentary schedule, and that it would now be voted on the following day instead of on 22 February. She told journalists that &quot;the recall, most definitely official, is now being implemented by this institution [Parliament]&quot;. The ANC announced that it planned to support the opposition&#x27;s motion, which would ensure its passage. Shortly afterwards, Zuma gave a long live television interview on SABC on 14 February 2018, arguing that he had done nothing wrong and had not been given reasons for his recall. He said that he disagreed with the ANC&#x27;s decision and was being &quot;victimised&quot;. He also said that if he was dismissed, the ANC could be &quot;plunged in a crisis that I&#x27;m sure my comrade leaders will regret&quot;. According to a later report by &quot;City Press&quot;, during this period elements of the South African National Defence Force and State Security Agency were unsuccessfully lobbied to launch a revolt to prevent Zuma&#x27;s removal.

On the same day, in a live televised address just before 11 p.m., Zuma announced his immediate resignation. In his speech, he said that he accepted the ANC&#x27;s decision but had asked its leadership to &quot;articulate my transgressions and the reason for its immediate instruction that I vacate office&quot;. He claimed that he had earlier had an agreement with the party that if he resigned it would be after &quot;a period of transition&quot;. He said:Make no mistake, no leader should stay beyond the time determined by the people they serve... No life should be lost in my name and also the ANC should never be divided in my name... I have therefore come to the decision to resign as President of the Republic with immediate effect. Even though I disagree with the decision of the leadership of my organisation, I have always been a disciplined member of the ANC. As I leave I will continue to serve the people of South Africa as well as the ANC, the organisation I have served all my life. I will dedicate all of my energy to work towards the attainment of the policies of our organisation, in particular the radical economic transformation agenda.

== Post-presidency ==

The week after his resignation, Zuma attended a farewell cocktail party in his honour, hosted by Ramaphosa at Tuynhuys in Cape Town and attended by other members of cabinet. Although former presidents are invited to all State of the Nation addresses, Zuma did not attend Ramaphosa&#x27;s addresses in 2018, 2019, or 2020.

=== Third corruption indictment ===
On 16 March 2018, a month after Zuma resigned from the presidency, the NPA announced that he would again face prosecution on the same 16 criminal charges he was indicted on in 2006: 12 charges of fraud, two of corruption, and one each of racketeering and money laundering, all related to the 1999 Arms Deal and to Zuma&#x27;s relationship with Shaik. The case was enrolled in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. Zuma pleaded not guilty when the trial began on 26 May 2021. As of May 2024, the trial was scheduled to resume in late April 2025 after many appeals by Zuma.

=== Zondo Commission ===

==== Testimony ====

At the instruction of the Public Protector and high court, in January 2018 Zuma established the Zondo Commission to investigate fraud, corruption, and state capture in the public sector in South Africa. Zuma was scheduled to testify before the commission for five days in mid-July 2019, and on Monday 15 July he opened his testimony by claiming that the commission was part of a decades-long &quot;character assassination&quot; conspiracy against him. He denied the veracity of several other witnesses&#x27; testimony and questioned the appropriateness of the phrase &quot;state capture&quot;, which he said was used to discredit him. If the whole state had truly been captured, he argued that the commission should investigate the judiciary and Parliament as well as the executive branch of government. After the hearings, Zuma addressed supporters who gathered outside the commission&#x27;s offices in Johannesburg.

Before the end of the third day of testimony on Wednesday 17 July, chairperson Ray Zondo adjourned proceedings so that the commission could meet with Zuma and his lawyers in order to discuss Zuma&#x27;s grievances about his treatment by the commission. On the morning of Friday 19 July, his lawyer announced that Zuma would &quot;take no further part&quot; in the commission&#x27;s proceedings and would consider court action. Zuma felt that he had been treated like an accused criminal rather than as a witness and that he had been relentlessly cross-examined – though the head of the commission&#x27;s legal team pointed out that his cross-examination had not yet begun. Later that day Zondo announced that they had come to an agreement: the commission had acquiesced to Zuma&#x27;s demand to furnish him with specific allegations in advance, and Zuma would provide written statements in response.

In subsequent months, Zuma appeared reluctant to cooperate with the commission, and he did not provide further testimony before it. Zondo issued a summons for Zuma&#x27;s appearance in the week of 16 November 2020, but Zuma applied to have Zondo recuse himself from proceedings. Zuma claimed that he and Zondo were friends, which Zondo denied, and that there was a conflict of interest arising from their &quot;historical family relations&quot;. On the latter point, Zondo conceded that he had had a child with the sister of Zuma&#x27;s third wife, Thobeka Madiba-Zuma, but pointed out that their relationship had ended in the 1990s, before Zuma and Madiba-Zuma met. On Thursday 19 November, Zondo dismissed Zuma&#x27;s application for his recusal. When the commission heard Zuma&#x27;s testimony, Zondo announced that Zuma had left during a break without being excused. He did not return on 20 November.

==== Contempt of court ====
In early December, the commission issued summonses for Zuma to appear before it in the weeks of 18 January and 15 February 2021 and applied to the Constitutional Court for an order compelling Zuma to comply with the summonses, which was granted on 28 January. When Zuma did not comply with the February summons, in open defiance of the court order, the commission approached the Constitutional Court and asked it to sentence Zuma to two years&#x27; imprisonment for contempt of court. Zuma refused to participate in the contempt proceedings, although he complained of bias, and on 29 June 2021 he was sentenced to 15 months&#x27; imprisonment.

==== Arrest and imprisonment ====
Zuma was given until 4 July to hand himself in, after which the police would have until 7 July to arrest him forcibly. The uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans&#x27; Association warned that his arrest would destabilise the country, and hundreds of supporters gathered outside his Nkandla residence, threatening violence if he was detained. Zuma told the press that he had been sentenced without trial, saying that it might &quot;remind our people of the apartheid days&quot;, and told a rally in Nkandla:I fought for freedom. I was fighting for these very rights. No one will take my rights away. Even the dead that I fought against during the liberation struggle will turn in their graves.On 7 July, with the deadline nearing and an outstanding court application by Zuma to halt the arrest, it was unclear whether the South African Police Service planned to arrest him. Forty minutes before the midnight deadline, Zuma handed himself over and was taken to the Estcourt Correctional Centre. On 9 July, the Pietermaritzburg High Court dismissed Zuma&#x27;s application to have the arrest overturned, citing a lack of evidence for the medical grounds raised by Zuma. There was a severe outbreak of civil unrest in KwaZulu-Natal on the same day linked to Zuma&#x27;s detention. The Constitutional Court subsequently heard an urgent rescission application by Zuma, reserving judgement on 12 July, but ultimately upheld its earlier sentence in a 7–2 ruling.

On 22 July, Zuma was granted one day&#x27;s compassionate leave to attend the funeral of his brother Michael. On 6 August, the Department of Correctional Services reported that he had been admitted to hospital for routine medical observation following a routine health check. He underwent surgery for an unspecified condition on 14 August and had to remain hospitalised in order to undergo further medical procedures. On 5 September, he was released on medical parole to receive medical care at home, instead of in hospital, in order to complete the rest of his sentence at his Nkandla home, under supervision in the community corrections system.

The decision was challenged in court by the Democratic Alliance, the Helen Suzman Foundation, and Afriforum. On 15 December 2021, high court judge Keoagile Matojane set aside the parole decision, declaring it unlawful and saying that it undermined respect for the judiciary, the rule of law, and the Constitution. The Medical Parole Advisory Board had advised against parole, but it had been granted by the Correctional Services Commissioner, Arthur Fraser, who had thereby effectively and improperly overruled the board. Zuma was ordered to return to prison, with his time on parole not counted towards his sentence. Zuma&#x27;s lawyers immediately announced his intention to appeal the high court&#x27;s decision, and he was granted leave to do so on 21 December.

The Department of Correctional Services declared that Zuma&#x27;s sentence had ended on 7 October 2022. A ruling had not yet been delivered on his appeal against the cancellation of his medical parole. The Supreme Court of Appeal ruled on 21 November that the medical parole was unlawful, but allowed the national commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services to consider whether the time he spent in parole would count towards his sentence. The Department of Correctional Services appealed the ruling to the Constitutional Court on 16 December. The Constitutional Court however refused to hear the appeal on 13 July 2023. On 11 August 2023, the Department of Correctional Services granted Zuma remission of his 15-month sentence.

==uMkhonto we Sizwe political party==
In December 2023, Zuma announced that, while planning to remain a lifelong member of the ANC, he would not be campaigning for the ANC in the 2024 South African general election, and would instead be voting for a newly-formed party, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK Party). He stated that &quot;I cannot and will not&quot; campaign for the ANC of current president Cyril Ramaphosa, Zuma&#x27;s successor, and that to do so would be a &#x27;betrayal&#x27;. On 29 January 2024, Zuma was suspended from the ANC for his endorsement of the MK Party. The ANC approached South Africa&#x27;s electoral court and contended that Zuma&#x27;s registration of the MK Party was &quot;unlawful&quot; (as it was a name of the ANC&#x27;s military wing) and also took on the country&#x27;s Electoral Commission for allowing its registration. Lawyers for the MK Party told the court that the ANC knew about the existence of the party since its registration in September 2023 but wondered why they waited this long for Zuma to endorse it before challenging it. Judges for the electoral court then dismissed the ANC&#x27;s request and found that the MK Party&#x27;s registration was lawful.

Just two weeks after his suspension from the ANC, the ANC alliance partner, SANCO, in KZN announced on 16 February 2024 that it had expelled Zuma because of absenteeism. Zuma had served as provincial chairperson of SANCO since 19 November 2023 after being elected unopposed in absentia at the organisation&#x27;s conference in Durban. The organisation said since his election Zuma never attended a single meeting and its provincial executive committee took the decision to get rid of him and find a replacement. On 28 March 2024, Zuma was banned from running in the 2024 South African general election over his 2021 conviction and jailing for contempt of court as the South African law doesn&#x27;t allow convicted candidates to stand for public office. On 20 May 2024, the Constitutional Court of South Africa would also bar Zuma from the running for parliament in the 2024 election, ruling that his early release was irrelevant. 

Having been a member of the African National Congress for over 45 years, his support for the rival party led to him being expelled from the ANC on 29 July 2024.

== Personality and public image ==

Zuma&#x27;s &quot;charisma and affable personality&quot; is at the centre of his public image, and is thought to be responsible for much of his political popularity. His charisma is most fully on display at his political rallies, which sociologist Roger Southall describes as laden with &quot;political theatre&quot; and &quot;popular idiom&quot;, especially through song – his longstanding trademark is uMkhonto we Sizwe anthem &quot;&quot;Umshini wami&quot; (English: &quot;Bring Me My Machine Gun&quot;), but he also became associated with &quot;Yinde lendlela&quot;&quot; (English: &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Journey&quot;) after the ANC&#x27;s Mangaung conference in 2012. Journalist Alec Russell wrote in 2009, &quot;When Zuma gets in front of these crowds, he is more than a politician: briefly, he becomes something closer to a revivalist preacher, or the leader of a cult.&quot;

Zuma is known for his sense of humour, and to the disapproval of opposition politicians, as president he frequently joked during his addresses to Parliament, including the mockery of the Democratic Alliance&#x27;s fixation on the Nkandla scandal. On 1 April 2015, his office released a statement about new cabinet appointments which was later revealed as an April Fools&#x27; Day prank on the media. Some have said that one factor in Zuma&#x27;s popularity is what Southall calls &quot;the politics of charismatic buffoonery&quot;. In one phrase, his public persona has been &quot;constructed as sometimes slightly gormless, but warm and accessible&quot;. Mondli Makhanya wrote:Zuma&#x27;s other great strength was that he did not mind looking stupid. And so he sang and danced at will. Whereas other politicians use this as an election gimmick, Zuma did it all the time and genuinely seemed to enjoy it. In Parliament and on public platforms he laughed and giggled as if he had inhaled a potent hallucinogenic. The more stupid he looked, the more it seemed to endear him to the people.

As a politician, he was viewed as an accessible figure – &quot;a simple man, a man of the people&quot;, and a good listener. In a 2009 interview, Zuma said that apartheid-era ANC president Oliver Tambo inspired his public posture:While Tambo was a great thinker, he was very simple. There is nothing he did not do... When people came to him he attended to them. He would even attend to somebody who comes to raise the issue of the shoe that doesn&#x27;t have shoelaces, he would ensure that the shoelaces were found... I am not a great man. I am a man of the people. I believe in people and I think that the people are everything. Once there is disconnection with the people you have problems.His connection to the &quot;grassroots&quot; is partly due to his embrace of his rural background, ethnic heritage, and lack of formal education. These aspects of his persona are frequently contrasted with the perceived intellectualism and Pan-Africanism of the ANC under Mbeki. Especially in combination with his penchant for struggle songs and the toyi-toyi, Zuma&#x27;s acceptance of his background has been described as tapping into &quot;popular understandings, memories, and meanings of racial oppression, racialised dispossession, and struggles of freedom&quot; during apartheid and thereafter. On the ethnic front, he often presents himself as a Zulu traditionalist, and has been associated with social conservatism. He is a polygamist, in line with Zulu tradition, and at a 2006 rally in KwaZulu-Natal, for example, he publicly spoke against same-sex marriage. He was frequently photographed wearing traditional Zulu attire at cultural events, and he appears less comfortable speaking in English than in his native Zulu, in which he is known for his &quot;linguistic flair&quot;.

Some commentators have claimed that his broad appeal arises from &quot;the populist&#x27;s trait of sometimes saying what his audiences want to hear&quot;, and he has frequently been called a political &quot;chameleon&quot;, with little known about what political principles and ideologies he subscribes to personally. This characterisation was made as early as 2007, when, ahead of the ANC&#x27;s Polokwane conference, the &quot;Financial Mail&quot; ran the first of two stories on Zuma, famously published under the headline &quot;Be Afraid&quot;. The articles criticised Zuma as an &quot;opportunist&quot; and concluded, in the paraphrase of &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist Barry Bearak, that he was &quot;far more interested in holding power than in making policy, long on charm if short on intellect&quot;.

During his post-presidency legal battles, when Zuma publicly claimed that he was being vilified under a conspiracy, William Gumede and others criticised what they called his &quot;narcissism&quot;.

== Controversies ==

=== Alleged abuses by bodyguards ===
In 2010, Zuma&#x27;s bodyguards were implicated in multiple incidents involving members of the public and journalists.

In February, a Cape Town student, Chumani Maxwele, was detained by police after allegedly showing Zuma&#x27;s motorcade a &quot;rude gesture&quot;. Maxwele, an active ANC member, was released after 24 hours, having provided a written apology to police, which he later claimed was coerced. He also claimed that his home had been raided by plain-clothes policemen, and that he had been forced into the vehicle at gunpoint. Maxwele later instituted legal action against the police, and a complaint was filed on his behalf to the Human Rights Commission. The incident led to a heated dispute when it was discussed in Parliament.

In March, journalist Tshepo Lesole was forced to delete pictures of Zuma&#x27;s convoy from his camera by police, and two photographers were detained by police when photographing Zuma&#x27;s Johannesburg home. Sky News reporter Emma Hurd claimed she had been pushed, manhandled and &quot;groped&quot; by Zuma&#x27;s bodyguards in 2009.

=== &quot;Shoot the Boer&quot; song ===
In January 2012, Zuma gave a speech at the ANC Centennial 2012 celebrations in Bloemfontein and, afterwards, sang the controversial song &quot;Dubul&#x27; ibhunu&quot; (&quot;Shoot the Boer&quot;).

=== &quot;The Spear&quot; painting ===
In 2012, Zuma was featured in a satirical painting by Cape Town-based artist Brett Murray, who depicted him in his painting &quot;The Spear&quot;, with his genitals exposed. The ANC responded by threatening court action against the gallery showing the painting, and further demanding that the image should be removed from online sources. On 22 May 2012, the painting was vandalised while it was hanging in an art gallery in Johannesburg. Zuma&#x27;s face and genitals were painted over.

=== Panama Papers revelations ===
Clive Khulubuse Zuma, Jacob Zuma&#x27;s nephew, was named in the Panama Papers as a result of his links to oilfields in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Shortly after Jacob Zuma met with DRC president Joseph Kabila, Khulubuse Zuma&#x27;s company Caprikat Limited secured a 100-billion-rand oil deal in the DRC.

== Jacob Zuma Foundation ==

Zuma started the foundation to send children to school and build houses for people living in poverty. The former chairperson of the foundation is Dudu Myeni, before she resigned from her memberships on the boards of directors of these and other bodies because she was declared a delinquent director for life in May 2020 by the Pretoria High Court.

== Personal life ==

=== Polygamy ===
Zuma is a polygamist, in line with traditional Zulu culture, and has been married six times. In 2012 the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; estimated he had 20 children, and in 2014 the &quot;Guardian&quot; reported he has 21, some of whom were born out of wedlock. In an interview, he said:There are plenty of politicians who have mistresses and children that they hide so as to pretend they&#x27;re monogamous. I prefer to be open. I love my wives and I&#x27;m proud of my children.Less than a year into Zuma&#x27;s presidency in March 2010, responding to a parliamentary question from the DA, the Minister in the Presidency, Collins Chabane, reported that the state spousal support budget was about R15.52 million, close to double the budget in the previous year when Kgalema Motlanthe had been president. Opposition leader Helen Zille expressed disapproval. In subsequent years, Zuma&#x27;s spokesperson, Mac Maharaj, stressed that South Africa did not have a formal office for the first lady, and that the state did not support the President&#x27;s wives or children except insofar as it funded some travel expenses and spousal participation at official functions. Yet in June 2012, there were reports that activists in the Eastern Cape branch of the ANC were backing a proposal that only Zuma&#x27;s first wife should receive state support.

=== Wives and children ===
; Gertrude Sizakele Khumalo, 1973–present: Zuma met Khumalo (born 2 March 1940) in 1959 and they married shortly after his release from prison in 1973. They have no children together.
; Kate Mantsho, 1976–2000: Zuma married Mantsho (born 2 September 1956 in Mozambique) in 1976 while he was in exile in Mozambique. She committed suicide on 8 December 2000 and is buried in Heroes&#x27; Acre at Westpark Cemetery in Johannesburg. Mantsho is the mother of twins Duduzile and Duduzane (born 1984), and three other children born in 1980, 1989, and 1993, the last of whom, Nhlakanipho Vusi, died on 1 July 2018.
; Nkosazana Dlamini, 1982–1998: Zuma met Dlamini (born 27 January 1949), an ANC politician and cabinet minister, while he was in exile in Swaziland. They were married in 1982 and divorced in June 1998. Dlamini is the mother of Gugulethu (born 1985), Nokuthula (also known as Thuli, born 1987), and Thuthukile (born 1989), as well as another child born in 1982.
; Nompumelelo Ntuli, 2008–present: Zuma married Ntuli (born 1975) on 5 January 2008. From 2014, she was investigated by police on the allegation that she had attempted to kill Zuma with poisoned tea. She denied the allegation and the NPA declined to prosecute her due to insufficient evidence. As of 2022, she and Zuma are reportedly estranged. They have three children, born in 2002, 2006, and 2010.
; Thobeka Stacie Mabhija, 2010–present: Zuma married Mabhija, also known as Thobeka Madiba (born 1973), on 4 January 2010. She and Zuma are reportedly estranged, and in 2020 she sued Zuma for spousal maintenance and then filed for divorce. They have three children. 
; Gloria Bongekile Ngema, 2012–present: In April 2012, Zuma married Ngema (born 1965), with whom he already had a son, Sinqumo (born c. 2009). In 2017, emails leaked as part of the so-called #GuptaLeaks suggested that the Gupta family had partially funded the purchase of Ngema&#x27;s R5.4-million house in Waterkloof Ridge, Pretoria.

Zuma has also been engaged to other women, including, from 2002, Princess Sebentile Dlamini, a niece of Swazi King Mswati III. Zuma paid the traditional &quot;lobola&quot; in cattle, but, as of 2022, they have not married, although the &quot;Citizen&quot; reported in 2017 that they were still engaged. He was also engaged to Nonkanyiso Conco (born 16 October 1993), a cast member on &quot;Real Housewives of Durban&quot;, but has broken off the engagement and are reportedly estranged. They have a child together: Sakh&#x27;muzi (born 12 April 2018).

Zuma&#x27;s firstborn child was born 1977 to Minah Shongwe, sister of Judge Jeremiah Shongwe, who asked to be recused from Zuma&#x27;s rape trial because of the relationship. He also has two children, born in 1998 and 2002, with Pietermaritzburg businesswoman Nonkululeko Mhlongo, whom he met in 1990 and to whom he was rumoured to be engaged. In 2024, Nomcebo became engaged to King Mswati III of Eswatini. In March 2017, a covert recording was leaked in which Mhlongo allegedly outlined a plan for defrauding the KwaZulu-Natal government, apparently with Zuma&#x27;s knowledge. His other children include a daughter born 8 October 2009 to Sonono Khoza, the daughter of soccer administrator Irvin Khoza, and, according to media reports, three children to a woman from Johannesburg and one to a woman from Richard&#x27;s Bay.

=== 2009 &quot;love-child&quot; ===
In January 2010, the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reported that Khoza had given birth to Zuma&#x27;s daughter in 2009, and Zuma ultimately confirmed that he had paid &quot;inhlawulo&quot;, acknowledging paternity, and appealed for privacy. Opposition parties criticised Zuma&#x27;s actions. Both the African Christian Democratic Party and the DA said that it undermined the government&#x27;s HIV/AIDS prevention programme, which promoted safe sex and marital fidelity. DA leader Zille also argued that it was not a purely private matter, since elected public officials had to embody the principles and values for which they stood. The Congress of the People said that Zuma could no longer use African cultural practices to justify his &quot;promiscuity&quot;, and Independent Democrats leader Patricia de Lille said that Zuma was asking people &quot;to do as I say and not as I do&quot;.

Zuma initially denied that the incident was relevant to the government&#x27;s HIV/AIDS programme and appealed for privacy. However, amid public controversy, on 6 February Zuma said he &quot;deeply regretted the pain that he caused to his family, the ANC, the alliance and South Africans in general&quot;. Similarly, the ANC initially defended Zuma, saying that it saw no links between its HIV/AIDS policies and Zuma&#x27;s personal life, but on 5 February acknowledged the widespread disapproval and said that it had listened to the public and learnt &quot;many valuable lessons&quot;. ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema said, &quot;Zuma is our father so we are not qualified to talk about that&quot;, but committed the Youth League to continual emphasis on its HIV/AIDS programme and &quot;one boyfriend, one girlfriend&quot; stance in a nationwide awareness campaign. ANC Women&#x27;s League deputy president Nosipho Ntwanambi said:With many African people for instance, and generally speaking, it is not right to have an extramarital affair if you have committed to yourself to a marriage. But under the Customary Marriages Act, if the first wife agrees, and if all these issues are discussed with her, we can&#x27;t do anything.Zwelinzima Vavi, the general secretary of the ANC&#x27;s Tripartite Alliance partner the Congress of South African Trade Unions, said that he passed no judgment but hoped that the matter would be &quot;on Zuma&#x27;s conscience&quot;, while also reiterating Zuma&#x27;s appeal for privacy.

<text>Peter Glen Vidmar (born June 3, 1961, in Los Angeles) is an American gymnast and two-time Olympic gold medalist. He was a member of the United States men&#x27;s national artistic gymnastics team and won gold in the team final and pommel horse, and silver in the individual all-around.

==Olympics==
At age 18, Vidmar was the youngest member of the U.S. team that won a bronze medal in the 1979 World Championships. He qualified for the 1980 Olympic team, but did not compete due to the U.S. Olympic Committee&#x27;s boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Russia. Vidmar was one of 461 athletes to receive a Congressional Gold Medal.

At the 1984 Summer Olympic games in Los Angeles, Vidmar won gold medals in the men&#x27;s all-around team competition and the pommel horse competition, and a silver medal in the men&#x27;s all-around individual gymnastics competition. With three Olympic medals, he is one of three athletes inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame twice. He was inducted as an individual, then as a member of the 1984 U.S. men&#x27;s gymnastics team.

==UCLA==
He is an alumnus of UCLA. In 1983, Vidmar won the Nissen Award (the &quot;Heisman&quot; of men&#x27;s gymnastics).

==Career==
Vidmar hosts the annual Peter Vidmar Men&#x27;s Gymnastics Invitational at Brentwood School in Los Angeles. He has been a gymnastics anchor for both CBS and ESPN. He is currently a motivational speaker as well as a co-chairman of the U.S. Olympic Committee Summer Sports Summit. In 1998 Vidmar was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Vidmar and his wife, Donna, have five children. He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

==2012 Olympics==
Vidmar was selected to be the chef de mission for the 2012 Olympics, where he would have represented all U.S. athletes and marched in the opening ceremonies. His selection drew criticism from LGBT activists and athletes, including Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir, because in 2008 Vidmar donated money to and publicly campaigned for Proposition 8 that banned same-sex couples from being married in California. Vidmar resigned his position to avoid his presence from being detrimental to the U.S. Olympics.

==U.S. Gymnastics==
Vidmar was named chairman of the U.S. Gymnastics Board of Directors in December 2008. He left his role at USA Gymnastics in December 2015 to serve as a mission president for the LDS Church in the Australia Melbourne Mission.

<text>Thorite, (Th,U)SiO4, is a rare nesosilicate of thorium that crystallizes in the tetragonal system and is isomorphous with zircon and hafnon. It is the most common mineral of thorium and is nearly always strongly radioactive. Thorite was discovered in 1828 on the island of Løvøya, Norway, by the vicar and mineralogist, Hans Morten Thrane Esmark. First specimens of Thorite were sent to his father, Jens Esmark, who was a professor of mineralogy and geology. It was named in 1829 to reflect its thorium content.

==Occurrence==


Specimens of thorite generally come from igneous pegmatites and volcanic extrusive rocks, hydrothermal veins and contact metamorphic rocks. It is also known to occur as small grains in detrital sands. Crystals are rare, but when found can produce nicely shaped short prismatic crystals with pyramidal terminations.
It is commonly associated with zircon, monazite, gadolinite, fergusonite, uraninite, yttrialite and pyrochlore.

Thorite is currently an important ore of uranium. A variety of thorite, often called &quot;uranothorite&quot;, is particularly rich in uranium and has been a viable uranium ore at Bancroft in Ontario, Canada. Other varieties of thorite include &quot;orangite&quot;, an orange variety, and &quot;calciothorite&quot;, an impure variety with trace amounts of calcium.

==Properties==
Due to the radioactive elements contained, Thorite is commonly &quot;metamict&quot;. With the destructive effects of radioactivity on the crystal lattice, hydrated specimens are often amorphous and optically isotropic. 
Owing to differences in composition, the specific gravity varies from 4.4 to 6.6 g/cm3. Hardness is 4.5 and the luster is vitreous or resinous. The color is normally black, but can range from brownish black to orange, yellowish-orange and dark green.

<doc id="1103163" wikidata="Q3039571" url="?curid=1103163" title="Anglo-Saxon law">
<text>Anglo-Saxon law (, later ; , ) was the legal system of Anglo-Saxon England from the 6th century until the Norman Conquest of 1066. It was a form of Germanic law based on unwritten custom known as folk-right and on written laws enacted by kings with the advice of their witan or council. By the later Anglo-Saxon period, a system of courts had developed to administer the law, while enforcement was the responsibility of ealdormen and royal officials such as sheriffs, in addition to self-policing () by local communities. 

Originally, each Anglo-Saxon kingdom had its own laws. As a result of Viking invasions and settlement, the Danelaw followed Scandinavian laws. In the 10th century, a unified Kingdom of England was created with a single Anglo-Saxon government; however, different regions continued to follow their customary legal systems. The last Anglo-Saxon law codes were enacted in the early 11th century during the reign of Cnut the Great. 

== Development ==
=== Before Christianisation ===
The native inhabitants of England were Celtic Britons. The unwritten Celtic law was learned and preserved by the Druids, who in addition to their religious role also acted as judges. After the Roman conquest of Britain in the first century, Roman law was operative at least concerning Roman citizens. But the Roman legal system disappeared after the Romans left the island in the 5th century.

In the 5th and 6th centuries, the Anglo-Saxons migrated from continental Europe and established several Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. These had their own legal traditions based in Germanic law that &quot;owed little if anything&quot; to Celtic or Roman influences. Anglo-Saxon law largely derived from unwritten customs termed folk-right (, ).

The older law of real property, of succession, of contracts, the customary tariffs of fines, were mainly regulated by folk-right. Customary law differed between local cultures. There were different folk-rights of West and East Saxons, of East Angles, of Kentish men, Mercians, Northumbrians, Danes, Welshmen, and these main folk-right divisions remained even when tribal kingdoms disappeared and the people were concentrated in one kingdom.

=== After Christianisation ===
Following the Christianisation of the Anglo-Saxons, written law codes or &quot;dooms&quot; were produced. The Christian clergy brought with them the art of letters, writing, and literacy. The oldest Anglo-Saxon law codes, especially from Kent and Wessex, reveal a close affinity to Germanic law. The first written Anglo-Saxon laws were issued around 600 by Æthelberht of Kent. Writing in the 8th century, the Venerable Bede comments that Æthelberht created his law code &quot;after the examples of the Romans&quot; (). This likely refers to Romanised peoples such as the Franks, whose Salic law was codified under Clovis I. As a newly Christian king, Æthelberht&#x27;s creation of his own law code symbolised his belonging to the Roman and Christian traditions. The actual legislation, however, was not influenced by Roman law. Rather, it converted older customs into written legislation, and, reflecting the role of the bishops in drafting it, protected the English church. The first seven clauses deal solely with compensation for the church.

Folk-right could be broken or modified by special law or special grant, and the fountain of such privileges was the royal power. Alterations and exceptions were, as a matter of fact, suggested by the interested parties themselves, and chiefly by the church. Thus a privileged land-tenure was created—bookland; the rules as to the succession of kinsmen were set at nought by concession of testamentary power and confirmations of grants and wills; special exemptions from the jurisdiction of the hundreds and special privileges as to levying fines were conferred. In process of time the rights originating in royal grants of privilege overbalanced, as it were, folk-right in many respects, and became themselves the starting-point of a new legal system—the feudal one.

In the 9th century, the Danelaw was conquered by Danes and governed under Scandinavian law. The word &quot;law&quot; itself derives from the Old Norse word . Starting with Alfred the Great (), the kings of Wessex united the other Anglo-Saxon peoples against their common Danish enemy. In the process, they created a single Kingdom of England. This unification process was completed under Æthelstan ().

There is a good deal of resemblance between the capitularies legislation of Charlemagne and his successors on one hand and the acts of Alfred, Edward the Elder, Æthelstan and Edgar on the other, a resemblance called forth less by direct borrowing of Frankish institutions than by the similarity of political problems and condition.

The Norman Conquest of 1066 ended the Anglo-Saxon monarchy. But Anglo-Saxon law and institutions survived and formed the foundation for the common law.

==Legislation==
While custom was respected, kings could adapt the laws of their predecessors and also create new laws. Royal law codes were produced in consultation with the witan, the king&#x27;s council comprising the lay and ecclesiastical nobility. Some law codes portrayed the witan as initiating new legislation and the king assenting to it. For example, one code begins, &quot;these are the ordinances which the wise men established at Exeter, by the counsel of King Æthelstan&quot;. Royal law codes were written to address specific situations and were intended to be read by people who were already familiar with the law.

The first law code was the Law of Æthelberht (), which put into writing the unwritten legal customs of Kent. This was followed by two later Kentish law codes, the Law of Hlothhere and Eadric () and the Law of Wihtred (695). Outside of Kent, Ine of Wessex issued a law code between 688 and 694. Offa of Mercia () produced a law code that has not survived. Alfred the Great, king of Wessex, produced a law code known as the Doom Book. The prologue of Alfred&#x27;s code states that the Bible and penitentials were studied as part of creating his code. In addition, older law codes were studied, including the laws of Æthelberht, Ine, and Offa. This may have been the first attempt to create a limited set of uniform laws across England, and it set a precedent for future English kings.

The House of Wessex became rulers of all England in the 10th century, and their laws were applied throughout the kingdom. Significant 10th-century law codes were promulgated by Edward the Elder, Æthelstan, Edmund I, Edgar, and Æthelred the Unready. But regional variations in laws and customs survived as well. The Domesday Book of 1086 noted that distinct laws existed for Wessex, Mercia, and the Danelaw.

The law codes of Cnut () were the last to be promulgated in the Anglo-Saxon period and are primarily a collection of earlier laws. They became the main source for old English law after the Norman Conquest. For political reasons, these laws were attributed to Edward the Confessor (), and &quot;under the guise of the &quot;Leges Edwardi Confessoris&quot; they achieved an almost mystical authority which inspired Magna Carta in 1215 and were for centuries embedded in the coronation oath.&quot; The &quot;Leges Edwardi Confessoris&quot; is the best known of the custumals, compilations of Anglo-Saxon customs written after the Conquest to explain Anglo-Saxon laws to the new Norman rulers.

===Language and dialect===

The English dialect in which the Anglo-Saxon laws have been handed down is in most cases a common speech derived from the West Saxon dialect. Wessex formed the core of the unified Kingdom of England, and the royal court at Winchester became the main literary centre. Traces of the Kentish dialect can be detected in the &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot;, a manuscript containing the earliest Kentish laws. Northumbrian dialectical peculiarities are also noticeable in some codes, while Danish words occur as technical terms in some documents. With the Norman Conquest, Latin took the place of English as the language of legislation.

== Courts ==
The Anglo-Saxons developed a sophisticated system of assemblies or moots (the Old English words and mean &quot;meeting&quot;). Historians often call these assemblies &quot;courts&quot;; however, they were not like the specialised law courts that developed under Angevin government. These assemblies performed a variety of functions beyond judicial business. They issued legislation, organised and performed law enforcement, and witnessed transactions.

Vague references to courts appear in earlier laws. These texts use terms such as (). Later laws use more specific terminology. The laws of Edgar () outline a precise division of courts. The hundred court was to meet every four weeks. The borough court was to meet three times a year, and the shire court was to meet twice a year.

=== King&#x27;s court ===
In addition to being a legislator, the king was also a judge. The king heard cases in the presence of his witan or council. Kings could also hear and act on complaints alone, outside of a formal judicial context. The cases heard by the king included:

* matters directly involving the king or royal property
* treason 
* land disputes 
* appeals from the decisions of lower courts

The law reserved some cases to the king&#x27;s jurisdiction. In the laws of Cnut, they include:

* (breach of the king&#x27;s protection)
* (assault on a person inside a house)
* (assault on a royal road)
* (fine for failing to perform military service)
* In the Danelaw: (fine for fighting) and (infringement of the peace)

These reserved cases could only be tried in the presence of the king or a royal official, and the fines were paid into the royal treasury. The requirement that a royal official preside usually meant that these cases, if not heard directly by the king, were heard in the shire court.

=== Shire courts ===

The shire court was a royal court presided over by the ealdorman and local bishop as royal representatives. The sheriff might also be there, either alongside the ealdorman or in his stead. It met twice a year around Easter and Michaelmas. A law of Cnut allowed it to meet more often if necessary.

While the ealdorman and bishop presided over the court, they were not judges in the modern sense. Decisions were made by the local thegns (nobles) who attended the court as suitors (those who declared the law and made judgments). Litigants and their supporters (such as oath-helpers) would also be present.

The shire court likely addressed the most serious crimes, such as death penalty cases. The shire was also the most likely setting for cases reserved to the king . The shire court witnessed land purchases, and it also adjudicated land disputes.

===Hundred courts===
Most people experienced the judicial system through their local hundred or wapentake. The hundred court met monthly and was presided over by a royal reeve. The laws of Edward the Elder and Æthelstan required reeves to ensure everyone received the benefits of folk-right and royal law.

The hundred had a role in witnessing transactions. Edgar&#x27;s law required all sales and purchases (such as land, cattle, and the manumission of slaves) to be witnessed by 12 men chosen by the hundred. The hundred handled criminal cases, civil cases, land disputes, and tort. It heard accusations of theft not involving the death penalty and may have executed thieves caught in the act; however, most serious offenses were reserved to the shire court&#x27;s jurisdiction. The hundred handled most ecclesiastical cases (such as tithe and marriage cases), and the bishop or his representative was expected to attend.

Each hundred was responsible for policing itself through a system called (). Free men were organised into groups of 10 or 12 called tithings. They pledged to be law abiding and to report crimes on pain of amercement. When a crime was committed, the victim or witnesses could raise the &quot;hue and cry&quot;, requiring all able-bodied men to pursue the suspect. The Hundred Ordinance attributed to Edgar commands, &quot;if the need is pressing, the man in charge of the hundred is to be told, and he then is to tell the men in charge of the tithings; and all are to go forth, where God guides them, that they may reach [the thief]. Justice is to be done on the thief as Edmund decreed previously.&quot; Suspects who escaped were declared outlaws, and it was said that they &quot;wore the wolf&#x27;s head&quot;, meaning they could be hunted and killed like wolves.

The identities of suitors to the hundred court are unclear. Cnut&#x27;s law required all freemen 12 years and older to belong to a hundred and tithing. However, this law referred to peacekeeping, and it is unknown if all free men would have attended the hundred court. It is possible that local thegns (or their bailiffs) controlled the court and made its decisions.

Decisions of a hundred court could be appealed to the shire or to the king. Before taking distraint of property, Cnut&#x27;s law required a man to seek justice three times in the hundred court and, failing that, to appeal to the shire court. Other laws required plaintiffs to seek justice in hundred courts before appealing to the king.

===Borough courts===
Boroughs were separate from the hundreds and had their own courts (variously termed burghmoot, portmanmoot, or husting). These met three times a year. Like hundreds, boroughs were required to appoint official witnesses for all transactions, 36 witnesses for large boroughs and 12 witnesses for small ones. While initially a regular court, the borough court developed into a special court for the law merchant.

=== Franchisal courts ===
The king could grant judicial rights and powers to a lord over his lands or over entire hundreds. It was common for royal writs granting such rights to include the phrases &quot;sake and soke&quot; and &quot;sake and soke, toll and team, and .&quot;

* Sake and soke: right to hold a court with similar jurisdiction to a hundred court and to collect judicial fines.
* Toll: right to charge tolls. 
* Team: right to judge whether goods were acquired in good faith and to collect fines from offenders. 
* : right to summary trial and execution of thieves caught in the act.

Sometimes further rights were granted, such as jurisdiction over (breach of the king&#x27;s protection), (assault on a person inside a house), and (assault on a royal road). The king could revoke all of these grants.

===Church courts===
Synods dealt with legal disputes. Initially, synods may have had jurisdiction over cases involving bookland since this form of land tenure originated within the church.

The king could also grant the church (either the bishop of a diocese or the abbot of a religious house) the right to administer a hundred. The hundred&#x27;s reeve would then answer to the bishop or abbot. The same cases would be tried as before, but the profits of justice would now go to the church. One such hundred was the Soke of Peterborough.

== Trial procedure ==
While common legal procedures existed, they can be difficult to reconstruct due to lack of evidence and variation in local custom. Shires possessed their own local traditions, and the Danelaw deviated in important ways from other parts of England.

=== Accusation and denial ===
Legal proceedings began with an accusation by an aggrieved party. In addition, tithing groups could present accusations as part of the system of . In cases involving royal rights, accusations could be brought by royal officials.

There were two types of cases that could be brought to court. In the first kind, a party claimed they or, in the case of homicide, a relative had been wronged. In the second kind, a claimant asserted that another party was in possession of movable or immovable property rightfully belonging to the claimant. The outcome sought could vary based on the type of case. Claimants might seek restoration of property, compensation, or the offender&#x27;s punishment.

The initiating party formally stated his charge with a fore-oath. An example formula in the anonymous text &quot;Swerian&quot; states, &quot;by the Lord, I accuse N. neither for hatred nor for calumny nor for unjust gain; nor do I know anything more true, except as my informant told me and I myself truly relate that he was the thief of my cattle&quot;. If strong evidence existed, the accuser would not need to make a fore-oath. However, false accusations were severely punished; the offender would lose his tongue unless he redeemed himself by paying his wergeld.

The defendant had to appear in court at the scheduled time or provide an essoin (excuse) for not attending. Surety () could be required to ensure the accused attended court and did not attempt to flee justice. This could take the form of a financial pledge, but it also included people standing as pledges. If the accused could find no people to stand surety and had no property to pledge, then he would be imprisoned. The man&#x27;s kinsmen or lord had a particular responsibility to act as surety for him. If a man fled justice, his surety had to pay his wergeld to the king or to the entitled party.

The accused had to formally deny the accusation in person; however, women and the mute or deaf needed a representative. The denial took the form of an oath, such as &quot;by the Lord, I am guiltless, both in deed and counsel, of the accusation of which N. accuses me&quot;.

=== Argument and mesne judgment ===
After the initial accusation and denial, the parties themselves (or their supporters) were able to argue their case. Each side told their version of the facts of the case, which could be supported by witnesses or written evidence (such as the well-known Fonthill Letter). Arguments could also cite folk-right or legal norms.

Following the arguments, the court might issue a mesne or intermediate judgment. A mesne judgment might declare the form of proof to be used in the trial and which party should provide that proof. Alternatively, a mesne judgment could appoint a smaller group of people to decide a case.

=== Proof ===
==== Evidence ====
Witnesses were an important form of evidence, especially in cases involving property. The parties might bring their own witnesses, but the official presiding over the court might also search for witnesses. Charters and other documents could help decide land disputes. Physical evidence could also be utilized. The Fonthill Letter recounts that a cattle thief named Helmstan was scratched in the face by a bramble while fleeing the scene of the crime. In court, the scratch was used as evidence against him.

==== Oath ====
In compurgation or trial by oath, a defendant swore oaths to prove his innocence without cross-examination. A defendant was expected to bring oath-helpers (), neighbors willing to swear to his good character or &quot;oathworthiness&quot;. In the Christian society of Anglo-Saxon England, a false oath was a grave offense against God and could endanger one&#x27;s immortal soul.

In Anglo-Saxon law, &quot;denial is always stronger than accusation&quot;. The defendant was acquitted if he produced the necessary number of oaths. If a defendant&#x27;s community believed him to be guilty or generally untrustworthy, he would be unable to gather oath-helpers and would lose his case. This system was vulnerable to abuse. A defendant might be unable to gather oath-helpers because his opponent was more powerful or influential within the community.

The number of oaths needed depended on the seriousness of the accusation and the person&#x27;s social status. If the law required oaths valued at 1200 shillings, then a thegn would not need any oath-helpers because his wergeld equaled 1200 shillings. However, a (200 shilling wergeld) would need oath-helpers.

==== Ordeal ====
When a defendant failed to establish his innocence by oath in criminal cases (such as murder, arson, forgery, theft and witchcraft), he might still redeem himself through trial by ordeal. Trial by ordeal was an appeal to God to reveal perjury, and its divine nature meant it was regulated by the church. The ordeal had to be overseen by a priest at a place designated by the bishop. The most common forms in England were ordeal by hot iron and ordeal by water. Before a defendant was put through the ordeal, the plaintiff had to establish a &quot;prima facie&quot; case under oath. The plaintiff was assisted by his own supporters or &quot;suit&quot;, who might act as witnesses for the plaintiff.

=== Final judgment ===
The final judgment was made collectively by the suitors of the court, especially the thegns. In the Danelaw, judgment might be made by a group of &quot;doomsmen&quot; or judges. There is also evidence that those presiding over the court sometimes issued their own judgments. 

A court could order the guilty party to pay a fine, compensate a victim, or forfeit property. A religious penalty, such as a penance, might also be imposed. In land disputes, a court could order the restoration of property to a successful litigant. Sometimes resolutions took the form of compromise. For example, a party who lost their claim to land might be given a life-tenure in the property.

The most serious crimes (murder, treachery to one&#x27;s lord, arson, house-breaking, and open theft) were punishable by death and forfeiture. Hanging by the gallows and beheading were common forms of execution. A woman convicted of murder by witchcraft was punished by drowning. According to the laws of Æthelstan, thieves over 15 years of age who stole more than 12 pence were to be executed (men by stoning, women by burning, and free women could be pushed off a cliff or drowned).

In Cnut&#x27;s code, a first criminal offence usually merited compensation to victims and fines to the king. Later offenses saw progressively severe forms of bodily mutilation. Cnut also introduced outlawry, a punishment only the king could remove.

Anglo-Saxon law assumed that a man&#x27;s wife and children were his accomplices in any crime. If a man could not return or pay for stolen property, he and his family could be enslaved.

==Kinship law==
One of the foundations of Anglo-Saxon law was the extended family or kindred (Old English: ). Membership in a kindred provided the individual with protection and security.

In the case of homicide, the victim&#x27;s family was responsible for avenging him or her through a blood feud. The law set criteria for legitimate blood feuds. A family did not have the right to retaliate if a member was killed while stealing property, committing capital crimes, or resisting capture. A person was exempt from retaliation if he killed while:

* Fighting for his lord
* Protecting his family from attack
* Defending his wife, daughter, sister, or mother from attempted rape (the murder had to take place during the attack)

Kings and the church promoted financial compensation (Old English: ) for death or injury as an alternative to blood feuds. In the case of death, the victim&#x27;s family was owed the weregild (&quot;man price&quot;). A person&#x27;s weregild was greater or lesser depending on social status.

Cnut&#x27;s code allowed secular clergy to demand or pay compensation in a feud. However, monks were prohibited because they had abandoned their &quot;kin-law when [they bowed] to [monastic] rule-law&quot;.

== Social class ==
A man had to own at least five hides of land to be considered a thegn (nobleman). Ealdormen (and later earls) were the highest-ranking nobles. High-ranking churchmen such as archbishops, bishops, and abbots also formed part of the aristocracy.

There were various categories of freemen:

* performed riding service (carried messages, transported strangers to the village, cared for horses, and acted as the lord&#x27;s bodyguard)
* held one to two hides of land
* held a virgate of land
* (cottage dwellers) held five acres
* Homeless laborers were paid in food and clothing

Thegns enjoyed greater rights and privileges than did ordinary freemen. The weregild of a was 200 shillings while that of a thegn was 1200. In court, a thegn&#x27;s oath was equal to the oath of six .

Slavery was widespread in early medieval England. The price of a slave (Old English: ) or thrall (Old Norse: ) was one pound or eight oxen. If a slave was killed, his murderer only had to pay the purchase price because slaves had no wergild. Because slaves had no property, they could not pay fines as a punishment for crime. Instead, slaves received corporal punishments such as flogging, mutilation, or death.

Slavery was an inherited status. The slave population included the conquered Britons and their descendants. Some people were enslaved as war captives or as punishment for crimes (such as theft). Others became slaves due to unpaid debts. While owners had extensive power over their slaves, their power was not absolute. Slaves could be manumitted; however, only second- or third-generation descendants of freed slaves received all the privileges of a freeman.

Slavery may have declined in the late eleventh century as it was considered a pious act for Christians to free their slaves on their deathbed. The church condemned the sale of slaves outside the country, and the internal trade declined in the twelfth century. It may have been more economic to settle slaves on land than to feed and house them, and the change to serfdom was probably an evolutionary change in status rather a clear distinction between the two.

== Land law ==
=== Types ===
Land in Anglo-Saxon England can be divided into three types: bookland, loanland, and folkland.

When a royal charter () transferred land ownership from the king to another person, the land was known as bookland (). Owning bookland carried three important benefits. First, food rent and other services owed to the king (except for the ) were transferred to the new owner. Second, the charter itself served as important evidence of ownership in case of a dispute. Third, the charter granted perpetual ownership to the grantee and his heirs unless freely alienated. The king had special jurisdiction over legal disputes involving bookland, and sometimes the king had to consent to its alienation. Originally, only religious houses received bookland, but kings started granting it to laymen in the late 8th century.

When a king, religious house, or lay lord leased property to others, it became loanland (). Most of the surviving evidence involves leases from religious houses. Sometimes land was leased to pay back a monetary loan; as part of such an agreement, a lender paid a lump sum of money to the borrower in exchange for the right to collect the loanland&#x27;s income for a set period (commonly three lives). For example, one document records loanland granted for three years in return for a loan of £3. Leases were witnessed in court, and written documents have survived, such as chirographs.

The meaning of folkland () is unclear, and historians have proposed at least three definitions. The first view, popular in the 19th century, is that folkland was a form of communal property belonging to the nation (the folk). The second view is that it belonged to the Crown but was separate from the king&#x27;s personal property; it could therefore be leased but not permanently alienated. The third view is that folkland referred to land held according to custom or tradition, which included all land except bookland.

=== Lordship and dependents ===
Lords granted peasants land in return for rent and labor. It was also common for free peasants who owned their land to submit to a lord for protection through a process called commendation. Peasants who commended their land owed their lord labor service. Theoretically, a commended peasant could transfer his land to a new lord whenever he liked. In reality, this was not permitted. By 1066, manorialism was entrenched in England.

=== Inheritance ===
Many parts of England (including Kent, East Anglia, and Dorset) practiced forms of partible inheritance in which land was equally divided among heirs. In Kent, this took the form of gavelkind.

== Peace and protection ==

Every house had a peace (Old English: ). Intruders and other violators of the peace had to pay a fine called a . A man&#x27;s status determined the amount of the . The laws of Æthelberht set the for the king at 50 shillings, the eorl (noble) at 12s., and the ceorl (freeman) at 6s. In Alfred the Great&#x27;s time, the king&#x27;s was £5. Individuals received protection through kinship ties or by entering the service of a lord.

 is the origin of the king&#x27;s peace. Initially, the king&#x27;s was limited to the royal residence. As royal power and responsibilities grew, the king&#x27;s peace was applied to other areas: shire courts, hundred courts, highways, rivers, bridges, churches, monasteries, markets, and towns. Theoretically, the king was present at these places. King&#x27;s imposed fines called wites as punishments for breaches of the king&#x27;s peace.

The king could grant individuals a personal peace (or ). For example, the king&#x27;s peace protected his counselors when traveling to and from meetings of the witan. Foreign traders and others not protected by lordship or kinship ties were under the king&#x27;s protection.

== Compensation ==
Anglo-Saxon law mandated that a person pay compensation when injuring another person. The injured body part determined the amount of compensation. According to Æthelberht&#x27;s law, pulling someone&#x27;s hair cost 50 sceattas, a severed foot cost 50 shillings, and &quot;damaging the kindling limb&quot; (the reproductive organs) cost 300 shillings.

In the case of murder, the victim&#x27;s kindred could forego a blood feud in return for payment of a wergild. In addition to paying the king a wite (fine), the killer also owed compensation to the victim&#x27;s lord. Some crimes could not be satisfied by financial compensation. These botless crimes were punished with death or forfeiture of property. They included:

* secret murder, such as by poison or witchcraft
* treachery to one&#x27;s lord
* arson
* house-breaking
* open theft

== Religion and the church ==
The creation of written law codes coincided with Christianisation, and the church received special privileges and protections in the earliest codes. The Law of Æthelberht demanded compensation for offenses against church property:
* 12-fold compensation for church property
* 11-fold for a bishop&#x27;s property

In the late 7th century, the laws of Kent and Wessex supported the church in various ways.

<text>Harry Whinna Nice (December 5, 1877 – February 25, 1941) was an American politician and a member of the Republican Party who served as the 50th Governor of Maryland from 1935 to 1939.

==Biography==
Harry Nice was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. He later attended Baltimore City College, Dickinson College and graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1899. He was married to Edna Viola Amos in 1905, with whom he had two sons, Harry Jr, and William, who died in childhood.

Nice served as assistant to the State&#x27;s Attorney in Baltimore, but later resigned to run for the Republican nomination for governor of Maryland in 1919. He lost to Democrat Albert C. Ritchie by a narrow margin. Following the defeat, Nice accepted a position in the Appeals Tax Court of Baltimore City as a judge from 1920 until 1924. In 1934, running under the campaign motto of &quot;Right the wrong of 1919&quot;, Nice again challenged Ritchie and defeated him by 6,149 votes.

Nice rose to become governor during the national depression, which brought great financial hardships to the state budget. To help find a solution to the situation, Nice assigned a committee to investigate ways of alleviating the debt, but was not pleased with the recommendations of raising taxes. Neither he nor the Maryland General Assembly felt it would be wise to raise taxes at such a rate. Also as governor, Nice redesigned the governors&#x27; residence at Government House, changing the architectural style from Victorian to Georgian.

After losing the support of his party, Nice was defeated by Herbert R. O&#x27;Conor in 1938. He attempted to run for the U.S. Senate in 1940, but was unsuccessful and resumed his law practice in Baltimore. He died on February 25, 1941, in Richmond, Virginia. He is buried in Greenmount Cemetery.

<doc id="1103173" wikidata="Q7964761" url="?curid=1103173" title="Walter Elliot (Scottish politician)">
<text>Walter Elliot Elliot (19 September 1888 – 8 January 1958) was a politician of Scotland&#x27;s Unionist Party prominent in the interwar period. He was elected to the House of Commons in 1918, and besides an interval of months in 1923–24 and 1945–46, remained in parliament until his death. His Cabinet roles were as the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the National Government (1931–1935) of Ramsay MacDonald; as the Secretary of State for Scotland in the National Government (1935–1937) of Stanley Baldwin; and as Minister of Health in Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s National Government (1937–1939) and the short-lived Chamberlain war ministry.

While in medical training at university he was President of the Glasgow University Union and served in the First World War, winning the Military Cross on two occasions. In the course of his career he was Member of Parliament for the constituencies of Lanark, Glasgow Kelvingrove, and Combined Scottish Universities. He was also Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Rector of the University of Aberdeen, and Rector of the University of Glasgow.

==Early life==
He was born in Lanark the eldest son of William Elliot, of the livestock auctioneers&#x27; firm Lawrie and Symington, and his wife, Ellen Elizabeth Shiels. His mother died during the birth of his youngest sibling. The children were thereafter raised by the mother&#x27;s relatives in Glasgow. They appear to have had a company, Shiels, Elliot and Nelson, who made farming equipment including the Shiels patent milking machine. Elliot was raised in Glasgow and educated at the high school in Lanark and The Glasgow Academy. One of his friends from the academy, through university and beyond, was the playwright Osborne Henry Mavor.

From 1905 he studied science and medicine at the University of Glasgow. In the election for Rector of the University of Glasgow in 1908, Elliot assisted the Liberal Club campaign to elect the Liberal David Lloyd George, supported the candidacy of George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, and according to Henry Mavor, ultimately voted for Keir Hardie, founder of the Labour Party. In 1909–10 he was editor of the &quot;Glasgow University Magazine&quot;. He co-wrote the university song &quot;Ygorra&quot;. Elliot graduated BSc in 1910. As a postgraduate he was President of the Glasgow University Union, 1911–12. While in the British Army&#x27;s Glasgow University Officers&#x27; Training Corps, he befriended John Boyd Orr. He graduated MB ChB in 1913.

In 1913–14 he was houseman (a newly qualified doctor) at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary.

== First World War ==
At the onset of the First World War the Special Reserve of the Royal Army Medical Corps was mobilised and in December 1914 Elliot was attached as a medical officer to the Royal Scots Greys on the Western Front. He won a Military Cross for his actions at Wancourt during the Battle of Arras in April 1917. He won a second Military Cross in the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, adding a bar to the original medal. Walter received a leg wound in the final month of the war, but returned home safely. His younger brother Dan Elliot was killed in 1915, during the Gallipoli campaign.

After the war, Elliot refused his father&#x27;s urging to enter the family business, Lawrie and Symington, and instead began a political career after being asked to stand for election while recovering from his war-wound. The invitation came from the governing Lloyd George ministry, a coalition government of the Liberal Party with the Conservative Party and their allies the Unionist Party. Elliot was indifferent to party-political divisions, and was reputed to have agreed to stand before asking which party&#x27;s ticket he should stand for.

== Member of Parliament ==
Elliot then entered politics and was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Lanark in the 1918 general election, standing as a Unionist. In 1919 he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Liberal Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health for Scotland, John Pratt. During his first stint in parliament he shared a house in Westminster with Liberal MP Colin Coote, who was later to write a biography of Elliot. In the same period Elliot met Blanche &quot;Baffy&quot; Dugdale niece and biographer of Arthur Balfour, whose Zionism Elliot came to support. Elliot also undertook scientific research during parliamentary recesses; his friend John Boyd Orr invited him to work at the Rowett Research Institute. In the Commons, Elliot supported the Government of Ireland Act 1920, which established the Partition of Ireland into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland as an attempt at Home Rule. At the pivotal Carlton Club meeting on 19 October 1922, he supported the Conservative Party&#x27;s ongoing coalition government of the Lloyd George ministry, but the Party favoured ending its involvement.

From Elliot&#x27;s research emerged a doctoral thesis on nutrition in pigs submitted to the University of Glasgow and for which Elliot was made Doctor of Science in 1923. He lost this seat in the 1923 general election but regained a place in the House of Commons months later in the 1924 Glasgow Kelvingrove by-election, a seat he held until July 1945.

== Junior Minister ==
In January 1923 Elliot was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health for Scotland in the government of Stanley Baldwin. He briefly lost the post during the Labour Party&#x27;s 1924 first MacDonald ministry, but regained it after Baldwin&#x27;s return to power that same year. In July 1926 Elliot was made to Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, a role he filled until 1929. He made an official visit to Colonial Nigeria in 1927. He was involved in the passage of the Local Government Act 1929, as well as reforms to administration in Scotland in 1928 and changes to Scottish ministers&#x27; positions in 1926.

In 1924 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Robert Blyth Greig, Frederick Orpen Bower, Arthur Crichton Mitchell, and William Archer Porter Tait.

Elliot was involved in the Empire Marketing Board from October 1927, having been appointed president of the Imperial Research Conference in Westminster Hall. and with John Boyd Orr began a project that conducted experiments in 1927 proving the value of feeding free milk to children in schools, and this persuaded Elliot to extend the pilot scheme to all Scotland&#x27;s schools by legislation. Elliot was a supporter of the Empire Marketing Board Film Unit and its work on documentary films, particularly those of John Grierson, including &quot;Drifters&quot; in 1929.

In May 1928, Elliot and Arthur Samuel, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury were reported to be working together in helping the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill in the budget debate.

After the formation of the first National Government (1931), Elliot was appointed Financial Secretary to the Treasury, a post he retained in the following second National Government (1931–1935). Early in 1932 Elliot was made a Privy Counsellor.

== Cabinet Minister ==
Political dispute over the British Empire Economic Conference held in Ottawa in summer 1932 – in which the British Dominions&#x27; governments discussed solutions to the Great Depression – eventually caused the replacement of the then Home Secretary Herbert Samuel with Sir John Gilmour, 2nd Baronet. In the same cabinet reshuffle, it was generally anticipated that Elliot would be appointed Secretary of State for Scotland, including by Elliot himself and by the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, but unexpectedly Elliot was appointed to replace Gilmour as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food while Godfrey Collins became the Scottish Secretary after the departure of Sir Archibald Sinclair, 4th Baronet.

He was seen by many as a rising star. In 1932 he entered the Cabinet as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and subsequently served as Secretary of State for Scotland and Minister of Health. Amongst his achievements were the Agricultural Marketing Act which sought to protect food producers from going bankrupt amidst massive surpluses and collapsing prices, the introduction of free milk for school children and formation of the National Housing Company which built prefabricated steel-based &quot;Weir Houses&quot; (produced for industrialist William Weir, 1st Viscount Weir) in Clydeside.

While Minister of Agriculture, Elliot asked John Boyd Orr, who advocated a national food policy, to prepare a report on nutrition and public health, though it went unpublished because of their political ramifications. Orr published the report himself as &quot;Food, Health and Income&quot; in early 1936, advocating national and international co-ordination on nutrition.

He was elected Rector of the University of Aberdeen in 1933, serving until 1936. Elliot was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1935.

On 29 March 1939, Elliot passed the Cancer Act 1939 – &quot;An Act to make further provision for the treatment of cancer, to authorise the Minister of Health to lend money to the National Radium Trust, to prohibit certain advertisements relating to cancer, and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid&quot;. All provisions in the Act for improving the treatment of cancer nationally have since been stripped, leaving only the prohibition against advertisements relating to cancer treatments.

In 1938 Elliot&#x27;s career reached a turning point when he came close to resigning over the Munich Agreement but decided against. Consequently, his political stock began to fall and when Winston Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister in 1940, Elliot was dropped from the government. He later served as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

== Second World War ==
Churchill did not include Elliot in the Churchill war ministry during the Second World War; instead, Churchill offered him the post of Governor of British Burma (the &quot;Scottish Colony&quot;) in October 1940, which Elliot refused. Since leaving government, Elliot become deputy assistant adjutant-general at Chester. There he dealt with refugees from The Blitz. After refusing the governorship of Burma, in January the following year he accepted the role of director of public relations at the War Office. He also sat on the Scottish Council of State established by Churchill&#x27;s Secretary of State for Scotland, Tom Johnston, since Elliot was himself a former Scotland Secretary.

In May 1941, during the London Blitz, Elliot chanced to be nearby the Palace of Westminster during a heavy air-raid which damaged the building. In the fire that followed, he was able to direct the London Fire Brigade to focus their efforts on saving the centuries-old Westminster Hall, with its unrivalled medieval hammerbeam roof, rather than on the Victorian Gothic chamber of the House of Commons, which was destroyed. During his time at the War Office, Elliot commissioned war artists in co-operation with Kenneth Clark, the Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Pictures, director of the National Gallery, and instigator of the War Artists&#x27; Advisory Committee. He also commissioned war-work from writers, including Eric Linklater. At the end of the year Elliot left his job at the War Office; he retired from the British Army having been promoted colonel.

He was chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a powerful House of Commons select committee, in 1942. During his chairmanship, he handled an inquiry examining deals between the Marconi Company and the Air Ministry; the investigation ended in the company forfeiting the proceeds.

In the beginning of 1943, Elliot suffered serious injury in an accident at the railway station at Hawick, while boarding a train on the Waverley Route between Edinburgh and Carlisle. He took the rest of 1943 to recover. In this time he was chair of committee on herring fisheries and published a collection of broadcasts he had made the previous year as &quot;Long Distance&quot;.

In early 1944 Elliot travelled to British West Africa, where he was instrumental in the eventual establishment of universities in the Gold Coast, the Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate, and British Nigeria. The commission established to deal with higher education in West Africa was chaired by Elliot.

Elliot had a meeting with Joseph Stalin as part of a parliamentary delegation to the Soviet Union, one of the Allies, in spring 1945. In the 1945 general election which brought the Attlee ministry to power, he lost the Glasgow Kelvingrove constituency to Labour&#x27;s John Williams by just 88 votes.

== Backbencher ==
He was returned for the Combined Scottish Universities seat in the November 1946 Combined Scottish Universities by-election, in which he replaced John Boyd Orr, who had resigned to become Director-General of the United Nations&#x27; new Food and Agriculture Organization. (This was the last such election.) When the university seats were abolished, Elliot returned to Kelvingrove where he beat his Labour opponent from 1945, John Lloyd Williams, and SNP candidate Hugh MacDiarmid in the 1950 election.

Between 1947 and 1950, Elliot was the elected Rector of the University of Glasgow. He was a governor of The Peckham Experiment in 1949. The same year, Elliot undertook a journey to the newly established State of Israel to report for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Elliot was a strong supporter of Israel.

In 1954 Elliot led the Parliamentary Delegation of Inquiry into the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya Colony. He also led the popular Elliot Commission on Higher Education in West Africa whose report informed the creation of the first university colleges in West African countries such as Nigeria and Ghana.

Elliot co-founded the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in 1955, and was its treasurer, often travelling to North America on NATO business. He frequently attended the Königswinter Conference at Königswinter in West Germany, an Anglo-German meeting of parliamentarians held annually from 1950.

Besides his fellowship in the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Elliot was also fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow.

Six universities awarded him honorary &quot;Legum Doctor&quot; (LLD) doctorates, including all the ancient universities of Scotland (Aberdeen, Edinburgh, St Andrews, Glasgow) and the universities of Leeds and Manchester. He received an honorary Doctor of Science (DSc) degree from the University of South Africa. He was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in 1952. He was also Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland 1956–1957.

He regularly appeared on the BBC television programme &quot;The Brains Trust&quot; and the BBC Home Service&#x27;s radio programme &quot;Any Questions?&quot;.

==Family==
Elliot married Helen Hamilton on 27 August 1919, but she died on 8 September in a mountaineering accident on their honeymoon on the Isle of Skye&#x27;s Cuillin hills. He married secondly Katharine Tennant (the daughter of Sir Charles Tennant, 1st Baronet and a half-sister of Margot Asquith) on 2 April 1934.

==Arms==
Elliot was posthumously granted arms from Lord Lyon in 1962 at the request of his widow, Katharine Elliot, Baroness Elliot of Harwood. His arms are impaled with the arms of his father-in-law, Sir Charles Tennant, 1st Baronet, in the arms of Katharine Elliot.

== Death ==
He died at the family estate of Harwood (inherited from his father) in Bonchester Bridge on 8 January 1958 of a coronary thrombosis. He was buried in Hobkirk churchyard three days later. On Elliot&#x27;s death, his widow stood as a Unionist for her husband&#x27;s former seat of Glasgow Kelvingrove; she was defeated in the 1958 Glasgow Kelvingrove by-election by Labour&#x27;s Mary McAlister. Afterwards she was instead one of the four women initially created a life peer under the Life Peerages Act 1958. As the Baroness Elliot of Harwood, she was the first woman to speak in the modern House of Lords.

==Publications==

*&quot;Toryism in the Twentieth Century&quot; (1927)
*&quot;Long Distance&quot; (1943)

==Recognition==

The Elliot Library at the Glasgow University Union is named after him, the main part of which consists of 2,000 books from Elliot&#x27;s own library at Harwood. The Library was opened by then Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in 1962.

<text>The Underground Area 2 (UA2) experiment was a high-energy physics experiment at the Proton-Antiproton Collider (SpS) — a modification of the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) — at CERN. The experiment ran from 1981 until 1990, and its main objective was to discover the W and Z bosons. UA2, together with the UA1 experiment, succeeded in discovering these particles in 1983, leading to the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics being awarded to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer. The UA2 experiment also observed the first evidence for jet production in hadron collisions in 1981, and was involved in the searches of the top quark and of supersymmetric particles. Pierre Darriulat was the spokesperson of UA2 from 1981 to 1986, followed by Luigi Di Lella from 1986 to 1990.

==Background==
Around 1968 Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg, and Abdus Salam came up with the electroweak theory, which unified electromagnetism and weak interactions, and for which they shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics. The theory postulated the existence of W and Z bosons, and the pressure on the research community to prove the existence of these particles experimentally was substantial. During the 70s it was established that the masses of the W and Z bosons were in the range of 60 to 80 GeV (W boson) and 75 to 92 GeV (Z boson) — energies too large to be accessible by any accelerator in operation at that time. In 1976, Carlo Rubbia, Peter McIntyre and David Cline proposed to modify a proton accelerator — at that time a proton accelerator was already running at Fermilab and one was under construction at CERN (SPS) — into a proton–antiproton collider, able to reach energies large enough to produce W and Z bosons. The proposal was adopted at CERN in 1978, and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) was modified to occasionally operate as a proton-antiproton collider (SpS).

==History==
On 29 June 1978 the UA1 experiment was approved. Two proposals for a second detector, with the same purpose as UA1, were made the same year. On 14 December 1978, the proposal of Pierre Darriulat, Luigi Di Lella and collaborators, was approved. Like UA1, UA2 was a moveable detector, custom built around the beam pipe of the collider, which searched proton–antiproton collisions for signatures of the W and Z particles. The UA2 experiment began operating in December 1981. The initial UA2 collaboration consisted of about 60 physicists from Bern, CERN, Copenhagen, Orsay, Pavia and Saclay.

From 1981 to 1985, the UA1 and UA2 experiments collected data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately . From 1985 to 1987 the SpS was upgraded, and the luminosity of the machine increased by a factor 10 compared to the previous performance. The UA2 sub-detectors were also upgraded, making the detector hermetic, which increased its ability to measure missing transverse energy.

The second experimental phase ran from 1987 to 1990. Groups from Cambridge, Heidelberg, Milano, Perugia and Pisa joined the collaboration, which grew to about 100 physicists. During this phase, UA2 accumulated data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of in three major running periods. After nearly ten years of operation, the UA2 experimental program stopped running at the end of 1990.

==Components and operation==
The UA1 and UA2 experiments recorded data during proton–antiproton collision operation and moved back after periods of data taking, so that the SPS could revert to fixed-target operation. UA2 was moved on air cushions when removed from the beam pipe of the SpS.

===Construction===
The UA2 experiment was located some 50 meters underground, in the ring of the SPS/SpS accelerator, and was housed in a big cavern. The cavern was large enough to house the detector, provide room for it to be assembled in a &quot;garage position&quot; without shutting down the accelerator and to where it was also moved back after periods of data taking. The accelerator could therefore revert to fixed-target operation, after periods of operating as a collider.

===Detectors===
The UA1 and the UA2 experiments had many things in common; they were both operating on the same accelerator and both had the same objective (to discover the W and Z bosons). The main difference was the detector design; UA1 was a multipurpose detector, while UA2 had a more limited scope. UA2 was optimized for the detection of electrons from W and Z decays. The emphasis was on a highly granular calorimeter – a detector measuring how much energy particles deposit – with spherical projective geometry, which also was well adapted to the detection of hadronic jets. Charged particle tracking was performed in the central detector utilising a combination of multi-wire proportional chambers and drift chambers and hodoscopes. Energy measurements were performed in the calorimeters. Unlike UA1, UA2 had no muon detector.

The calorimeter had 24 slices, each weighing 4 tons. These slices were arranged around the collision point like segments of an orange. Particles ejected from the collision produced showers of secondary particles in the layers of heavy material. These showers passed through layers of plastic scintillators, generating light which was read with photomultiplier by the data collection electronics. The amount of light was proportional to the energy of the original particle. Accurate calibration of the central calorimeter allowed the W and Z masses to be measured with a precision of about 1%.

===Upgrades of the detector===
The 1985-1987 upgrade of the detector was aimed at two aspects: full calorimeter coverage and better electron identification at lower transverse momenta. The first aspect was addressed by replacing the end-caps with new calorimeters that covered the regions 6°-40° with respect to the beam direction, thereby hermetically sealing the detector. The end-cap calorimeters consisted of lead/scintillator samplings for the electromagnetic part, and iron/scintillator for the hadronic part. The performance and granularity of the new calorimeters were set to match the central calorimeter, which was of importance for the triggering system.

The electron identification was improved by the use of a completely new central tracking detector assembly, partly consisting of a pioneering silicone-pad detector. In 1989, the collaboration pushed this concept even further by developing a Silicon Pad Detector (SPD) with finer pad segmentation to be placed directly around the collision region beam pipe. This detector was built as a cylinder, closely surrounding the beam pipe. The detector had to fit into the available space of less than 1 cm. It was therefore necessary to miniaturize the components of the detector. This was achieved with two brand new technologies: the silicon sensor and the Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). Existing electronics were too bulky, and therefore a novel ASIC had to be developed. This was the first silicon tracker adapted to a collider experiment, a technology prior to the present silicon detectors.

==Results==
===Hadronic jets at high transverse momentum===
The very first result of the UA2 collaboration, published on 2 December 1982, was the first unambiguous observation of hadronic jet production at high transverse momentum from hadronic collisions. Observations of hadronic jets confirmed that the theory of quantum chromodynamics could describe the gross features of the strong parton interaction.

===Discovery of the W and Z bosons===
The UA2 and UA1 collaboration chose to search for the W boson by identifying its leptonic decay, because the hadronic decays, although more frequent, have a larger background. By the end 1982, the SpS had reached high enough luminosity to permit the observation of formula_1 and formula_2 decays. On 22 January 1983, the UA2 collaboration announced that the UA2 detector had recorded four events that were candidates for a W boson. This brought the combined number of candidate events seen by UA1 and UA2 up to 10. Three days later, CERN made a public announcement that the W boson was found.

The next step was to track down the Z boson. However, the theory said that the Z boson would be ten times rarer than the W boson. The experiments therefore needed to collect several times the data collected in the 1982 run that showed the existence of the W boson. With improved techniques and methods, the luminosity was increased substantially. These efforts were successful, and on 1 June 1983, the formal announcement of the discovery of the Z boson was made at CERN.

===Search for the top quark===
Throughout the runs with the upgraded detector, the UA2 collaboration was in competition with experiments at Fermilab in the US in the search for the top quark. Physicists had anticipated its existence since 1977, when its partner — the bottom quark — was discovered. It was felt that the discovery of the top quark was imminent.

During the 1987-1990 run UA2 collected 2065 formula_1 decays, and 251 Z decays to electron pairs, from which the ratio of the mass of the W boson and the mass of the Z boson could be measured with a precision of 0.5%. By 1991 a precise measurement for the mass of the Z boson from LEP had become available. Using the ratio of the W mass to Z mass, a first precise measurement of the W mass could be made. These mass values could be used to predict the top quark from its virtual effect on the W mass. The result of this study gave a top quark mass value in the range of 110 GeV to 220 GeV, beyond the reach for direct detection by UA2 at the SpS. The top quark was ultimately discovered in 1995 by physicists at Fermilab with a mass near 175 GeV.

<text>Finch Avenue is an arterial thoroughfare that travels east–west in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The road continues west into the Regional Municipality of Peel as Regional Road 2 and east into the Regional Municipality of Durham as Regional Road 37.

The road is considered a high-density transit corridor by Metrolinx. At its intersection with Yonge Street in North York, the Finch subway station and Finch Bus Terminal carry some of the highest numbers of commuters in the city.

==History==

Finch Avenue was named after hotel owner John Finch, who operated John Finch&#x27;s Hotel at the northeast corner of Finch Avenue and Yonge Street. The road allowance was a concession road, and at one time, there were a number of older churches, schoolhouses, and cemeteries on each side of the road. In the 1950s, Ontario Hydro built a series of transmission lines around Toronto, and paralleled Finch from Highway 400 eastward into Pickering. A compressed natural gas pipeline also follows this routing.

As suburban development in North York progressed northward in the 1960s, Finch was rapidly reconstructed from a gravel road into a four-laned traffic artery. This began with the realignment of several sections, such as at Bayview where Newtonbrook Creek flows diagonally beneath the crossroads. A rail overpass west of Leslie was built by 1968.

In the west, Finch originally ended at the Humber River at Islington Avenue. A separate western section was later constructed as development occurred in the-then Borough of Etobicoke. Traffic proceeding west had to travel on Islington, south across the Humber to Albion Road, and west beyond Kipling Avenue to reach it. In the early 1990s, this gap was closed. Earlier, in the 1980s a short extension was built northwestward into Mississauga and Brampton with the construction of Highway 427, following the former Toronto Gore Township Concession 3, which originally spurred off Indian Line, the precursor to the 427. Finch ends at Steeles Avenue, and Gorewood Drive continues it for a short distance north of Highway 407, where the concession is cut off by the Claireville Conservation Area. The concession is then called McVean Drive in northeastern Brampton, north of Queen Street, the former Highway 7. It then continues into Caledon as Centreville Creek Road.

On August 19, 2005, a freak rainstorm in Toronto caused the Black Creek water level to rise, which caused a section of Finch Avenue West near Sentinel Road (due south of York University between Keele and Jane Streets) to collapse, leaving a deep pit that prevented any pedestrian or vehicular traffic from passing through. The crater left where a 4 lane roadway once was is approximately deep. Two lanes reopened in late 2005, and the remaining lanes opened in April 2006. On July 24, 2009, two sinkholes appeared on Finch Avenue West between Dufferin Street and Bathurst Street.

==Route description==


Despite its length (one of the longest streets in the Greater Toronto Area), few major landmarks are on Finch; it runs primarily through business and residential areas. The North York City Centre area, which runs south from Finch&#x27;s intersection with Yonge Street, has many condominium and office high-rises.
Most of Finch Avenue west of Morningside Avenue is a four- to six-lane principal arterial, with a speed limit of 50 km/h (31–40 mph) in most sections. A part between Markham Road and Midland Ave remains at 60km/h. East of Morningside, Finch Ave. E becomes Staines Rd., a collector road that runs through residential communities, northeast to Steeles Ave. E. East of Morningside, the road is signed as Old Finch Avenue, requiring connections with several north-south streets (Sewells Road, Meadowvale Road and Plug Hat Road) before continuing briefly at the south end of Beare Road. Heading east, it enters into the City of Pickering in Durham Region after Scarborough-Pickering Townline, where it is also known as Durham Regional Road 37.

In Pickering, Finch Avenue is also known as Durham Road # 37 and continues east to Brock Road (Durham Regional Road 1). It ends at a cul-de-sac at Kingston Road (Durham Regional Highway 2 and formerly provincial Highway 2), and Kingston Rd. continues the concession line to the eastern boundary of Oshawa.

In Mississauga and Brampton, Finch Avenue is designated as Peel Regional Road 2, and is the shortest road corridor under the jurisdiction of the Region of Peel.

==Public transit==
Finch subway station (on the eastern branch of Line 1 Yonge–University of the Toronto subway) is located at the intersection of Finch Avenue and Yonge Street. It is the northern terminus of the eastern branch and is a major regional transit hub. The Finch Bus Terminal, a hub for GO Transit, York Region Transit and Viva buses, is next to the station. Finch Avenue is served by buses from the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) 24 hours a day through regular routes (36 Finch West and 39 Finch East) and Blue Night Network routes (336 Finch West and 339 Finch East). One express route, 939 Finch Express, provides faster transit along Finch Avenue and connects to Scarborough Centre station on Line 3 Scarborough in the east.

West of Humberwood Boulevard, the TTC routes 36 and 336 diverge, and Brampton transit buses take over. The Brampton Transit 11 Steeles operates westward only to Steeles, and the 511 Züm Steeles operates express from Steeles.

Finch West station (on the western branch of Line 1) was opened on December 17, 2017 and is located at the intersection of Finch Avenue and Keele Street. In 2007, former mayor David Miller proposed the construction of several light rail lines under the Transit City plan, one of which was Line 6 Finch West, which was to operate between Humber College in the west and Finch West station in the east. After the succeeding mayor Rob Ford cancelled the line, it was restored through a vote in the city council. Funding was then approved by Metrolinx and had been scheduled for completion in 2022. Still, after consultation with Mosaic Transit Group over the construction schedule, Metrolinx delayed the line&#x27;s completion to 2024.

==Former sections==
Pawnee Avenue is a former alignment of Finch Avenue. Pawnee Avenue runs along the former North York Township road alignment between Highway 404 and Victoria Park Avenue. Old Finch Avenue (despite its name, there is no &quot;New&quot; Finch) is a separate part of the present road alignment severed from the main section of the street, after a northward arc in its course was partially incorporated into a northerly extension of Morningside Avenue, creating a jog. It runs from Morningside Avenue to east of Sewells Road in northeastern Scarborough, and ends at the western boundary of Rouge Park.

<doc id="1103240" wikidata="Q3881054" url="?curid=1103240" title="Officium Triste">
<text>Officium Triste is a death-doom band from Rotterdam, The Netherlands. They refer to their style often as &quot;Rotterdoom&quot;. It is largely inspired by bands like My Dying Bride and early Anathema, but the last album is slower and more melodic. The vocals are mostly unintelligible death grunts but with occasional clean vocals. Their home-venue is Baroeg in Rotterdam.

==History==
The origins of Officium Triste trace back to the early 1990s when Martin and Johan made the decision to establish a metal band. Initially named Reïncremated, the band underwent a significant transformation in the spring of 1994 when the final lineup opted to disband and regroup under a new name, adopting a distinct musical direction.

The new moniker became Officium Triste. Musically, they started to compose heavy and melodic doom metal. The start of Officium Triste went pretty smooth and new songs were composed quickly. This resulted in the decision to record a demo, which was recorded at the Elektra in Sliedrecht on the 4th and 5 August 1994. The recordings were low-budget and made using a 4-track recorder.

This recording session resulted in the &quot;Demo &#x27;94&quot; which included three songs and an intro. The reactions from the underground scene were positive and eventually, all 200 copies were sold out. The music on this demo resulted in a deal with a label called Fuck You Records for a 7-inch EP. Officium Triste entered the Excess studio in Rotterdam on 19 and 20 February 1995 to record two new songs and an intro. Due to supposed lack of money the label did nothing. After a delay of a year, the band decided to release the EP by themselves. Vocalist Pim started Weeping Willow Records and released the EP &quot;Mountains Of Depressiveness&quot; pressed on red vinyl limited to 500 copies in the summer of 1996. In the meantime, during the summer of 1995, bass player Maarten quit the band and was replaced by Johan. Although the recordings were over a year old by the time they were released, the reactions within the scene were very good. This resulted in a deal with Dutch underground label Teutonic Existence Records for an album. The band entered Excess studio again to record the CD in December 1996. They recorded five new songs and re-recorded two songs from the demo and one from the EP in slightly different versions. In February 1997, the recording sessions were finished. The album &quot;Ne Vivam&quot; was released late April of the same year.

The next recordings Officium Triste made were three new tracks (again using Excess studio) for a split MiniCD release with Cold Mourning from Monterey, California, United States. This MCD was also released through Weeping Willow Records, containing two songs by each band. Officium Triste were also featured on a compilation CD released by Innocent Record Productions from the Netherlands. The track featured was &quot;Dreams Of Sorrow&quot; of the &quot;Ne Vivam&quot; album. This compilation did not receive much attention.

In September 1998, some irritation between the band members led to the decision to disband. They played a successful goodbye-gig, again supporting Anathema, in their hometown Rotterdam at Baroeg. They also decided to release one more CD-single. This CD contained &#x27;left-overs&#x27; from the last two recording sessions: &quot;Roses on my Grave&quot; was recorded at the same time as the songs for the split-MCD and had never before been released and &quot;Headstone&quot; was a cover song from the English band Chorus of Ruin, recorded during the &quot;Ne Vivam&quot; session. In the meantime Martin, Johan and Pim decided to continue and created a new band, XI:LIX (also known as Eleven Fiftynine or 11:59). A new guitarist, also named Johan, was recruited and they started working on new songs. After seven months the former members of Officium Triste decided to meet in the pub to have a drink for old-times sake and decided to reform the band. Johan the new guitarist was also taken in the line-up, leading to a line-up featuring 3 guitarists.

In January 2000, Officium Triste recorded two new songs, &quot;Pathway of Broken Glass&quot; and &quot;Divinity&quot; for a promo. The song &quot;Roses on my Grave&quot; was also included. This promo was sent to labels for a possible deal. During April 2000, &#x27;new man&#x27; Johan wanted to quit due to lack of time. July 2000, the band let bass-player Johan go. He was replaced by Lawrence who used to play guitar in Death Sentence and drums in Liar of Golgotha. The release of the promo lead to a two-album deal with Displeased Records from the Netherlands. The band entered Valvesound studios in Schiedam, the Netherlands in April 2001 to record a second full-length album. In 10 days it was recorded and mixed. The album was called &quot;The Pathway&quot; and contains seven songs. Meanwhile, the band did some live performances with the new line-up. In October 2001 the album &quot;The Pathway&quot; was released as well as a re-issue of the self-financed &quot;Goodbye&quot; MiniCD &quot;Roses on my Grave&quot; a limited 7-inch EP with a slightly different cover.

The band started working on new material for their third opus and decided to record the next album in their own studio “El Pato” run by guitarist Johan. The band recorded a demo consisting of one song and Displeased gave green light to record the next album at “El Pato”. During December 2003 and March 2004 they recorded the five-track album &quot;Reason&quot;. A lot of shows were done to promote this album directly after the release.

In 2005, the band re-released a CD version of the debut album &quot;Ne Vivam&quot; through Russia&#x27;s Serpent&#x27;s Lair Productions. This album already was re-released on vinyl in 2003 on Badger Records. At this time the band also started to think about their next release since they once again signed a deal for two albums with Displeased Records. At the end of 2006 Officium Triste felt they were ready to record their fourth album and booked the Excess Studio in Rotterdam. In the first week of January 2007 most parts of the album were recorded and in February the guitar parts were recorded at the band&#x27;s own El Pato studio. In May the album called &quot;Giving Yourself Away&quot; featuring six new songs was released. At the same time guitarist Johan decided to leave the band after 13 years. His replacement is Bram Bijlhout, former guitarist/vocalist for the Dutch band Imbolc.

<text>The Unadilla River is a river in the Central New York Region of New York State. The river begins northeast of the hamlet of Millers Mills and flows generally south to the village of Sidney, where it converges with the Susquehanna River, which drains into the Chesapeake Bay, a bay of the Atlantic Ocean.

Most of the length of the Unadilla forms the western border of Otsego County and the eastern borders of Chenango and Madison counties, all in New York. This border made up a significant portion of the Fort Stanwix Treaty Line of 1768. It was meant to establish the border for an Indian reserve, beyond which European-American settlers were not supposed to go. Settlers resented British efforts to control their movements, and continued to encroach on Native American territories.

==Branches==
The Unadilla has two branches which join at Unadilla Forks on the Otsego-Madison County border.

*The main branch of the Unadilla, referred to as the Unadilla River, starts northeast of the hamlet of Millers Mills in southwestern Herkimer County.
*The West Branch Unadilla River starts a few miles north of Bridgewater in southeast Oneida County. This branch was known as &quot;Eghwagy Creek&quot; during the early 18th century.

==Tributaries==
The Unadilla&#x27;s tributaries, from north to south, include:
* Campbell Brook: from the east, near the Skaneateles Turnpike north of Leonardsville
*Button Creek: from the west, between Leonardsville and West Edmeston
* Beaver Creek: from the west, between South Brookfield and Columbus Quarter
* Tallette Creek: from the west, near Columbus Quarter
*Center Brook: from the west, at New Berlin
*Wharton Creek: from the east, at New Berlin
*Butternut Creek: from the east, near Mount Upton
*Guilford Creek: from the west, north of Sidney

==Alternate names and spellings==
Unadilla has had various spellings and alternate names, particularly in the 18th century:
*Che-on-a-dill-ha: Oneida dialect
*Teyonadelhouogh: Gideon Hawley, &quot;Journey to Broome County, Oquaga (Onaheghgwage)&quot;, 1753
*Tiona-derha: Guy Johnson&#x27;s 1768 map
*Tienaderha: Guy Johnson&#x27;s 1771 map and Southeir&#x27;s 1779 map
*Tianaderaha: Surveyor-General, Simeon De Witt&#x27;s map 
*Tianaderha: Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768
*Tunadilla: Common spelling 18th century correspondence
*Susquehannock: Vaughan&#x27;s 18th century &quot;Chorographical Map&quot;

<text>General William Edmeston (died 1804) was a British Army officer who owned an estate in New York State.

As a captain in the 48th Regiment of Foot, he was posted to North America in 1755 with his brother, Lieutenant Robert Edmeston, to fight in the French and Indian War.

In 1763, by royal proclamation, the brothers were each awarded 5,000 acres (20 km2) of land in the colonies for their military service. They attempted to establish their claims in what was then a disputed part of the New Hampshire Grants, now Vermont. However, in 1770 they decided to locate on the east bank of the Unadilla River in New York State just west of George Croghan&#x27;s Otsego patent, in what is now the Town of Edmeston in Otsego County. They established their homes on the land, which became known as the Mount Edmeston Tracts. The transactions were facilitated by Percifer Carr, who had been a sergeant in the 48th with Edmeston and when the Edmeston brothers later returned to England, Carr would be employed as caretaker of their land.

When the American War of Independence broke out in 1775 Edmonston was arrested by the Americans and sent to Boston to be exchanged, after which he became Lieutenant-Colonel of the 48th Foot. He was captured by a French privateer in 1779, but he made his way to England the following year and spent the remainder of the war serving in Europe as a lieutenant-colonel, first with the 48th Foot but from 1782 to 1783 with the 50th Foot.

Between 1793 and 1796 he was the Colonel of the short-lived 95th Regiment of Foot and in 1802 he was appointed Colonel of the 1st Royal Veteran Battalion. He was promoted full general in 1803.

He died the following year and was buried at Hanwell, Middlesex on 3 July 1804.

<text>The International Association of Exorcists (), abbreviated as &quot;AIE&quot;, is a Roman Catholic organization which was founded in 1994. by six priests including the world-famous exorcist of Rome, Father Gabriele Amorth and Father Jeremy Davies. Its statutes were approved by the Catholic Church on June 13, 2014. The &quot;AIE&quot; provides training and support to exorcists, and also helps to raise awareness of the issue of demonic possession. It has around 900 members from 58 countries. Its members are all priests who have been authorized by their bishops to perform exorcisms. The organization is composed of mostly Catholic priests, as well as some Anglican and Orthodox priests.

==History==
Although the membership is restricted and exclusive, by 2000 there were over two hundred members, who meet bi-annually in Rome. The association sends out a quarterly newsletter where members can tell of particularly interesting or difficult cases. An exorcist priest must have the permission of his bishop to join the group. 
Within the Roman Catholic Church a priest may only perform an exorcism with the express consent of his bishop or local ordinary, and only, to the extent necessary, after an examination of the patient by doctors and psychiatrists in order to determine that the affliction has no natural origin. A priest is required by canon law to be devout, knowledgeable, prudent, and respected for his integrity.

Father Amorth began the organization in the hopes of increasing the number of official exorcists worldwide and to alert more dioceses about the issue of the increasing number of demonic possessions, which he believed had been ignored or suppressed by some priests and bishops. During his lifetime, Father Amorth was the honorary president of &quot;AIE&quot;. His successor as president was Father Giancarlo Gramolazzo, who died in November 2010 and was succeeded in turn by Capuchin Father Cipriano de Meo (born January 5, 1924), Fr. Francesco Bamonte, and then by Msgr.Karel Orlita the current president.

<text>The Kano Chronicle (Arabic: تاريخ أرباب هذا البلاد المصممة كان; &quot;The history of the masters of this country it was designed&quot;) is an Arabic-language manuscript that lists the rulers of Kano.

==Summary==
The &quot;Kano Chronicle&quot; is a list of rulers of Kano stretching back to the 10th century AD. It tells of eleven clans of animists (such as salt extractors, brewers, or smiths) who were warned by their spiritual leader that a stranger would come and cut down their sacred tree and wrest their dominion from them: “If he comes not in your time, assuredly he will come in the time of your children, and will conquer all in this country” (Palmer 1928: III: 98). Indeed, a man named Bagauda arrived soon after, conquered, and became the first king of Kano according to the chronicle (Palmer 1928: III: 97-100).

==Authorship==
The existing &quot;Kano Chronicle&quot; was probably written in the 1880s by Malam Barka, a &quot;Dan Rimi&quot; (high-ranking slave official) who worked for Muhammad Bello, the &quot;Sarkin Kano&quot; (ruler of Kano) who reigned as emir from 1882–1893.

The chronicle may represent the amalgamation of earlier works. The original copy is still with the descendants of Malam Idris al-Khilawiy in Kano.

==Translations==
The best-known translation is Sir Richmond Palmer&#x27;s 1908 English translation, which was derived from a manuscript obtained at Sabon Gari near Katsina, northern Nigeria.

There is also a 1933 translation into Hausa by Rupert M. East, titled &quot;Labarun Hausawa da Makwabtansu: Littafi na biyu&quot;. Since this translation made use of a different source than Palmer&#x27;s translation, East&#x27;s text has some differences from Palmer&#x27;s text.

<text>Father Giancarlo Gramolazzo (Ortonovo, Italy, 1945 - Rome, 8 November 2010) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest who served as an exorcist. He was the president of the International Association of Exorcists until his death.

Born in the north of Italy, he joined the order of Saint Luigi Orione at the age of 12, where he was ordered as a priest in 1973, to become president of the Institute of orphans of Roma-Montemario.

He was dedicated during 30 years to exorcism, becoming president of the International Association of Exorcists, founded in 1990 by father Gabriele Amorth (1925–2016), who later remained its honourable president and 5 other priests.
Father Gramolazzo has over thirty years experience as an exorcist.
He helped Father Gabriele Amorth in a 1999 exorcism of a nineteen years old woman. The next day the same woman who appeared at the Vatican underwent another exorcism performed by Pope John Paul II.

In September 2004, in Mexico City, Mexico, Father Gramolazzo addressed more than five hundred participants including exorcist priests from various dioceses in the country at the annual meeting of the International Association of Exorcists.

He died in Rome at the age of 65, after a serious disease, as Radio Vatican informed on November 12, 2010. The funeral was officed in the Roman church of All Saints, presided by bishop Giovanni D&#x27;Ercole and concelebrated by 60 priests, with the presence of family members, exorcists and representatives of the Association Family of the Immaculate, founded by himself.

<text>Al-Ikhlāṣ (, &quot;Sincerity&quot;), also known as the Declaration of God&#x27;s Unity and al-[[Tawhid]] (, &quot;Monotheism&quot;), is the 112th chapter (&quot;sūrah&quot;) of the Quran.
According to George Sale, this chapter is held in particular veneration by Muslims, and declared, by Islamic tradition, to be equal in value to a third part of the whole Quran. It is said to have been revealed during the Quraysh Conflict with Muhammad in answer to a challenge over the distinguishing attributes of God, Muhammad invited them to worship.

Al-Ikhlas is not merely the name of this surah but also the title of its contents, for it deals exclusively with Tawhid. The other surahs of the Quran generally have been designated after a word occurring in them, but in this surah the word Ikhlas has occurred nowhere. It has been given this name in view of its meaning and subject matter.

And there is none comparable unto Him.


=== Meaning ===
== Material evidence ==
The first three verses of Al-Ikhlas are known from a coin issued by Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in 697 AD. It is also at the beginning of the major inscription on the Dome of the Rock, which dates to 691. Some of the early inscriptions of the surah contain a variant of the first verse, where the &quot;qul huwa&quot; of the first verse is missing (a variant also documented in the Islamic tradition). It is typically not found in early manuscripts because it is located towards the end of the Quran, and therefore, is in a location of a manuscript sensitive to damage, although it is present in the manuscript Sarayı Medina 1a.

== Historical context ==
In Islamic tradition, the audience of Al-Ikhlas has been variously reported to be Jewish, Christian, or pagan. Various potential contextualizations have been suggested in Quranic studies. One suggestion relates the first verse to the Shema of the Book of Deuteronomy: &quot;Hear, O Israel: YHVH is our God, YHVH is one&quot; (Deut 6:4). Another suggestion, especially as advocated by Angelika Neuwirth, relates this verse as representing an antithesis or a counter to the Nicene Creed based on structural corresponds between the two. A recent proposal has compared this surah to Jacob&#x27;s commentary of the Christological beliefs of the Christians of Najran in his 6th-century Letter to the Himyarites. This, in particular, resembles a Muslim tradition whereby the surah was revealed in the context of an arrival of a delegation of Christians from Najran into Muhammad&#x27;s audience.

==Exegesis==

In the early years of Islam, some surahs of the Quran came to be known by several different names, sometimes varying by region. This surah was among those to receive many different titles. It is a short declaration of tawhid, God&#x27;s absolute oneness, consisting of four ayat. &quot;Al-Ikhlas&quot; means &quot;the purity&quot; or &quot;the refining&quot;.

It is disputed whether this is a Meccan or Medinan surah. The former seems more probable, particularly since it seems to have been alluded to by Bilal ibn al-Harith, who, when he was being tortured by his cruel master, is said to have repeated &quot;Ahad, Ahad!&quot; (unique, referring as here to God). It is reported from Ubayy ibn Ka&#x27;b that it was revealed after the polytheists asked &quot;O Muhammad! Tell us the lineage of your Lord.&quot;

===Q112:1-2 None comparable to God===
Surah Al-Ikhlas contains four verses: 112:1. Say: He is Allah, One. 112:2. Allah As-Samad. 112:3. He begets not, nor was He begotten. 112:4. And there is none comparable to Him.

About this, Tafsir Ibn Kathir says: 

The word (Al-Ahad) cannot be used for anyone in affirmation except for Allah within the Islamic tradition.

==Hadith==
According to hadiths, this surah is an especially important and honored part of the Quran:
* Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: A man heard another man reciting (in the prayers): &#x27;Say (O Muhammad): &quot;He is Allah, the One.&quot; (112.1) And he recited it repeatedly. When it was morning, he went to the Prophet and informed him about that as if he considered that the recitation of that Sura by itself was not enough. Allah&#x27;s Apostle said, &quot;By Him in Whose Hand my life is, it is equal to one-third of the Quran.&quot;
* Narrated Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab that Humayd ibn Abd ar-Rahman ibn Awf had told him that Surat al-Ikhlas (Surah 112) was equal to a third of the Qur&#x27;an, and that Surat al-Mulk (Surah 67) pleaded for its owner.
* Narrated &#x27;Aisha: The Prophet sent (an army unit) under the command of a man who used to lead his companions in the prayers and would finish his recitation with (the Sura 112): &#x27;Say (O Muhammad): &quot;He is Allah, the One.&quot; &#x27; (112.1) When they returned (from the battle), they mentioned that to the Prophet. He said (to them), &quot;Ask him why he does so.&quot; They asked him and he said, &quot;I do so because it mentions the qualities of the Beneficent and I love to recite it (in my prayer).&quot; The Prophet; said (to them), &quot;Tell him that Allah loves him&quot;
* Imam Malik ibn Anas recorded from Ubayd bin Hunayn that he heard Abu Hurayrah saying, &quot;I went out with the Prophet and he heard a man reciting `Say: He is Allah, the One.&#x27; So the Messenger of Allah said, (It is obligatory). I asked, `What is obligatory&#x27; He replied, &quot;Paradise.&quot;
* Narrated by Abu Said, the Prophet said to his companions, &quot;Is it difficult for any of you to recite one third of the Qur&#x27;an in one night?&quot; This suggestion was difficult for them so they said, &quot;Who among us has the power to do so, O Allah&#x27;s Apostle?&quot; Allah Apostle replied: &quot; Allah (the) One, the Self-Sufficient Master Whom all creatures need.&#x27; (Surat Al-Ikhlas 112.1 ..to the End) is equal to one third of the Qur&#x27;an.&quot;
* Al-Bukhari reported from Amrah bint Abdur-Rahman, who used to stay in the apartment of Aisha, the wife of the Prophet, that Aisha said, &quot;The Prophet sent a man as the commander of a war expedition and he used to lead his companions in prayer with recitation (of the Quran). And he would complete his recitation with the recitation of `Say: He is Allah, One.&#x27; So when they returned they mentioned that to the Prophet and he said, Ask him why does he do that? So they asked him and he said, &quot;Because it is the description of Ar-Rahman and I love to recite it. So the Prophet said, &quot;Inform him that Allah the Most High loves him.&quot; This is how Al-Bukhari recorded this hadith in his book of tawhid. Muslim and an-Nisai also recorded it.
* An authentic Hadith says &#x27;Say [recite] Surat al-Ikhlās and al-Muawwidhatayn (Surat al-Falaq and Surat an-Nās) three times in the morning and the evening; they will suffice you from everything.&#x27; [Narrated by At-Tirmidhi. And Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani authenticated it: 2829
* Narrated Aisha: &quot;Whenever the Prophet went to bed every night, he used to cup his hands together and blow over it after reciting Surah al-Ikhlas, Surah al-Falaq and Surah an-Nas, and then rub his hands over whatever parts of his body he was able to rub, starting with his head, face and front of his body. He used to do that three times.
* Imam Ahmad also recorded that Ibn &#x27;Umar said, &quot;I watched the Prophet twenty-four or twenty-five times reciting in the two Rak&#x27;ahs before the Morning prayer and the two Rak&#x27;ahs after the Sunset prayer, &#x27;Say: &quot;O ye infidels!&quot;&#x27; (Surah Al-Kafirun) and &quot;Say: &quot;He is Allah, One.&quot;

<doc id="1103334" wikidata="Q1884439" url="?curid=1103334" title="Bannaventa">
<text>Bannaventa or Benaventa was a Romano-British fortified town which was on the Roman road later called Watling Street, which today is here, as in most places, the A5 road. Bannaventa straddles the boundaries of Norton and Whilton, Northamptonshire, England, villages highly clustered and double that away, respectively.

==Iter II (Watling Street)==
The road on which Bannaventa lies is thought to be the first built by the Romans in Britain. It begins in Portus Ritupis (Richborough in Kent) and runs in successive north westerly directions – via many Roman towns.

Bannaventa was a small fortified town on this road north-northwest of the Roman town of Lactodorum (now Towcester). The other way, by , was the Roman settlement of Venonis (Wigston Parva), a crossroads town – of this street which there for several miles marks the Leicestershire-Warwickshire boundary – with Fosse Way (road from Lincoln to Britain&#x27;s south west).

==Name==
Bannaventa is derived from Brittonic &quot;*bannā&quot; &quot;peak, hill&quot; (as in Modern Welsh &quot;ban&quot;, &quot;top, tip, point, summit, crest, peak, beacon, height, pinnacle, turret, hill, mountain, bare hill&quot;) and &quot;*wentā&quot;, of obscure origin, but perhaps &quot;place of sacrifice&quot; or simply &quot;place, field&quot; (as in Welsh &quot;cadwent&quot; &quot;battlefield&quot;)

Brief mention of the settlement is thrice found in Emperor Antoninus Pius’s &quot;Itinerarium, Iter Britanniarum&quot; (The Road Routes of Antoninus Augustus): 

:* Iter 2, Venone XII, Benaventa XVII, Lactodorum XII.
:* Iter 6, Lactodorum XVI, Isannavantia XII, Tripontium XII.
:* Iter 8, Venone XII, Benaventa XVIII, Magiovinter XXVIII.
The sites of these names are as follows:
*Venone = High Cross, Wigston Parva, Leicestershire
*Lactodorum = Towcester, Northamptonshire
*Isannavantia = Bannaventa – assumed.
*Tripontium = Cave&#x27;s Inn, Warwickshire
*Magiovinter = Dropshort, Buckinghamshire

This emperor died in 161 CE.
==Description==

Bannaventa was a staging post for Romano-Celtic travellers and would have operated along the lines of the coaching towns of a later period along Watling Street. The town would have been a vital part of the road infrastructure of Roman Britain. The fortified town would provide a safe, warm resting place where for the journey could be bought and horses and other livestock could be safely stabled overnight. The town would also provide some protection for the wider local allies in times of danger. Close to the town are other Roman sites, connected in time. These include the remains of a villa on the summit of nearby Borough Hill, another smaller settlement between Thrupp Lodge and Thrupp Grounds and two other small homesteads, and a more western Roman villa.

===Rediscovery===
It was not until the early 18th century that the site of Bannaventa was positively identified. Previously, sites at nearby Weedon Bec, Daventry&#x27;s Borough Hill and even Northampton had been suggested. There have been many archaeological finds across the site including the discovery of a skeleton and numerous cremations in a Roman burial ground a little south of the boundary of the fortifications. Other discoveries include Constantinian coins, some foundations, stonework, and pottery; most were found in the early 18th century and they led to the definitive location of the town. More finds in the 20th century have been discovered and are listed below:

*A number of rubbish pits dating from the 1st and 2nd century
*In 1900, Roman coins of Victorinus and Samian ware, remnants of buildings including wall plaster, rotten wood, roof slates, and a cobbled floor.
* In 1922 Roman coins including a Sestertius of Hadrian.
* In 1957 a Large Nene Valley beaker, large painted pot, part of a glass bowl. Fragments of a black Samian pot plus many other artifacts.

In 1970 the site was photographed from the air. This revealed the position of the street which was more true north-south as it bisected the town, and the outline of the town mostly to the west of the A5. The settlement was enclosed by an imperfect square (distended to the south-east) with broad rounded corners, bounded by a series of three sets of banks and ditches. The enclosed town measured . In the enclosure lies evidence of the wooden buildings which made up most of the town.

===Current status===
Nothing obviously Roman now remains above ground and has no public access, and is privately owned and is a field. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

==Similarity to name of Saint Patrick&#x27;s birthplace==
Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, tells us in his &quot;Confession&quot; that he had been born in a settlement called &quot;Bannavem Taburniae&quot;. The location is unknown, but could be a variant of &quot;Bannaventa&quot;. This led at least one historian of this county to opine that Patrick was born at Bannaventa. 

However an early &quot;Life of Patrick&quot; describes his birthplace as &quot;near the western sea&quot;, easing the rest of Patrick&#x27;s confession that he was carried into slavery in Ireland by Irish raiders. Likewise, per co-authors of a scholarly national typography of 1979, the suffix &quot;Taburniae&quot; is likely to distinguish it from Bannaventa.

<text>The British Columbia Social Credit Party was a conservative political party in the province of British Columbia, Canada. The provincial Social Credit movement was divided in its early years and was largely under the influence of the Alberta Social Credit League; it did not have a functional leadership before 1952.

The 1952 leadership convention was held when the party was largely dominated by the Alberta leadership of the national social credit movement. Alberta Premier Ernest Manning hand-picked Ernest George Hansell to lead the British Columbia party into the election despite the fact that Hansell was an Alberta politician. W.A.C. Bennett was chosen party leader by Social Credit MLAs following the provincial election.

In 1973, the party elected W.A.C. Bennett&#x27;s son, Bill Bennett, on the first ballot.

All of the party&#x27;s leadership conventions before 1993 were delegated, i.e., local party riding associations selected delegates to attend a convention and elect a leader by secret ballot. The 1993 leadership election was determined by a &quot;one-member, one-vote&quot; system, using mail-in preferential ballots. The 1994 leadership election used the same system, but did not incorporate preferential balloting as there were only two candidates.

==1952 leadership convention==
Held April 27, 1952
*Reverend Ernest George Hansell &quot;acclaimed&quot;
*W.A.C. Bennett (declined nomination)
*Lyle Wicks (declined nomination)

At this time the Alberta Social Credit League still dominated the British Columbia association. Hansell, an Alberta Social Credit Member of Parliament, was the hand-picked candidate of Alberta Premier Ernest Manning. Bennett and Wicks were both nominated from the floor, however, but declined allowing Hansell to be acclaimed. Following the general election in which Social Credit unexpectedly emerged as the largest party, Wicks, who was the British Columbia party&#x27;s president, called a new leadership vote at which only elected Social Credit MLAs could vote. In this contest, held on July 15, 1952, Bennett defeated Philip Gaglardi by a margin of 10 to 9 to become Social Credit leader and was invited by the lieutenant-governor to become Premier of the province.

<doc id="1103352" wikidata="Q5283998" url="?curid=1103352" title="Divide-and-conquer eigenvalue algorithm">
<text>Divide-and-conquer eigenvalue algorithms are a class of eigenvalue algorithms for Hermitian or real symmetric matrices that have recently (circa 1990s) become competitive in terms of stability and efficiency with more traditional algorithms such as the QR algorithm. The basic concept behind these algorithms is the divide-and-conquer approach from computer science. An eigenvalue problem is divided into two problems of roughly half the size, each of these are solved recursively, and the eigenvalues of the original problem are computed from the results of these smaller problems.

This article covers the basic idea of the algorithm as originally proposed by Cuppen in 1981, which is not numerically stable without additional refinements.

==Background==
As with most eigenvalue algorithms for Hermitian matrices, divide-and-conquer begins with a reduction to tridiagonal form. For an formula_1 matrix, the standard method for this, via Householder reflections, takes formula_2 floating point operations, or formula_3 if eigenvectors are needed as well. There are other algorithms, such as the Arnoldi iteration, which may do better for certain classes of matrices; we will not consider this further here.

In certain cases, it is possible to &quot;deflate&quot; an eigenvalue problem into smaller problems. Consider a block diagonal matrix
:formula_4
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of formula_5 are simply those of formula_6 and formula_7, and it will almost always be faster to solve these two smaller problems than to solve the original problem all at once. This technique can be used to improve the efficiency of many eigenvalue algorithms, but it has special significance to divide-and-conquer.

For the rest of this article, we will assume the input to the divide-and-conquer algorithm is an formula_1 real symmetric tridiagonal matrix formula_5. The algorithm can be modified for Hermitian matrices.

==Divide==

The &quot;divide&quot; part of the divide-and-conquer algorithm comes from the realization that a tridiagonal matrix is &quot;almost&quot; block diagonal.

The size of submatrix formula_6 we will call formula_11, and then formula_7 is formula_13. formula_5 is almost block diagonal regardless of how formula_15 is chosen. For efficiency we typically choose formula_16.

We write formula_5 as a block diagonal matrix, plus a rank-1 correction:

The only difference between formula_6 and formula_19 is that the lower right entry formula_20 in formula_19 has been replaced with formula_22 and similarly, in formula_23 the top left entry formula_24 has been replaced with formula_25.

The remainder of the divide step is to solve for the eigenvalues (and if desired the eigenvectors) of formula_19 and formula_23, that is to find the diagonalizations formula_28 and formula_29. This can be accomplished with recursive calls to the divide-and-conquer algorithm, although practical implementations often switch to the QR algorithm for small enough submatrices.

==Conquer==

The &quot;conquer&quot; part of the algorithm is the unintuitive part. Given the diagonalizations of the submatrices, calculated above, how do we find the diagonalization of the original matrix?

First, define formula_30, where formula_31 is the last row of formula_32 and formula_33 is the first row of formula_34. It is now elementary to show that
:formula_35

The remaining task has been reduced to finding the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix plus a rank-one correction. Before showing how to do this, let us simplify the notation. We are looking for the eigenvalues of the matrix formula_36, where formula_37 is diagonal with distinct entries and formula_38 is any vector with nonzero entries. In this case formula_39.

The case of a zero entry is simple, since if wi is zero, (formula_40,di) is an eigenpair (formula_40 is in the standard basis) of formula_36 since
formula_43.

If formula_44 is an eigenvalue, we have:
:formula_45
where formula_46 is the corresponding eigenvector. Now
:formula_47
:formula_48
:formula_49
Keep in mind that formula_50 is a nonzero scalar. Neither formula_38 nor formula_46 are zero. If formula_50 were to be zero, formula_46 would be an eigenvector of formula_37 by formula_45. If that were the case, formula_46 would contain only one nonzero position since formula_37 is distinct diagonal and thus the inner product formula_50 can not be zero after all. Therefore, we have:
:formula_60
or written as a scalar equation,
:formula_61
This equation is known as the &quot;secular equation&quot;. The problem has therefore been reduced to finding the roots of the rational function defined by the left-hand side of this equation.

All general eigenvalue algorithms must be iterative, and the divide-and-conquer algorithm is no different. Solving the nonlinear secular equation requires an iterative technique, such as the Newton–Raphson method. However, each root can be found in O(1) iterations, each of which requires formula_62 flops (for an formula_63-degree rational function), making the cost of the iterative part of this algorithm formula_64.

==Analysis==

W will use the master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences to analyze the running time. Remember that above we stated we choose formula_16. We can write the recurrence relation:
:formula_66
In the notation of the Master theorem, formula_67 and thus formula_68. Clearly, formula_69, so we have
:formula_70

Above, we pointed out that reducing a Hermitian matrix to tridiagonal form takes formula_2 flops. This dwarfs the running time of the divide-and-conquer part, and at this point it is not clear what advantage the divide-and-conquer algorithm offers over the QR algorithm (which also takes formula_64 flops for tridiagonal matrices).

The advantage of divide-and-conquer comes when eigenvectors are needed as well. If this is the case, reduction to tridiagonal form takes formula_3, but the second part of the algorithm takes formula_74 as well. For the QR algorithm with a reasonable target precision, this is formula_75, whereas for divide-and-conquer it is formula_76. The reason for this improvement is that in divide-and-conquer, the formula_74 part of the algorithm (multiplying formula_78 matrices) is separate from the iteration, whereas in QR, this must occur in every iterative step. Adding the formula_3 flops for the reduction, the total improvement is from formula_80 to formula_81 flops.

Practical use of the divide-and-conquer algorithm has shown that in most realistic eigenvalue problems, the algorithm actually does better than this. The reason is that very often the matrices formula_78 and the vectors formula_83 tend to be &quot;numerically sparse&quot;, meaning that they have many entries with values smaller than the floating point precision, allowing for &quot;numerical deflation&quot;, i.e. breaking the problem into uncoupled subproblems.

==Variants and implementation==

The algorithm presented here is the simplest version. In many practical implementations, more complicated rank-1 corrections are used to guarantee stability; some variants even use rank-2 corrections.

There exist specialized root-finding techniques for rational functions that may do better than the Newton-Raphson method in terms of both performance and stability. These can be used to improve the iterative part of the divide-and-conquer algorithm.

The divide-and-conquer algorithm is readily parallelized, and linear algebra computing packages such as LAPACK contain high-quality parallel implementations.

<doc id="1103359" wikidata="Q7880334" url="?curid=1103359" title="Ultra-high vacuum">
<text>Ultra-high vacuum (often spelled ultrahigh in American English, UHV) is the vacuum regime characterised by pressures lower than about . UHV conditions are created by pumping the gas out of a UHV chamber. At these low pressures the mean free path of a gas molecule is greater than approximately 40 km, so the gas is in free molecular flow, and gas molecules will collide with the chamber walls many times before colliding with each other. Almost all molecular interactions therefore take place on various surfaces in the chamber.

UHV conditions are integral to scientific research. Surface science experiments often require a chemically clean sample surface with the absence of any unwanted adsorbates. Surface analysis tools such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low energy ion scattering require UHV conditions for the transmission of electron or ion beams. For the same reason, beam pipes in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider are kept at UHV.

== Overview ==
Maintaining UHV conditions requires the use of unusual materials for equipment. Useful concepts for UHV include:
* Sorption of gases
* Kinetic theory of gases
* Gas transport and pumping
* Vacuum pumps and systems
* Vapour pressure

Typically, UHV requires:
*High pumping speed — possibly multiple vacuum pumps in series and/or parallel
*Minimized surface area in the chamber
*High conductance tubing to pumps — short and fat, without obstruction
*Use of low-outgassing materials such as certain stainless steels
*Avoid creating pits of trapped gas behind bolts, welding voids, etc.
*Electropolishing of all metal parts after machining or welding
*Use of low vapor pressure materials (ceramics, glass, metals, teflon if unbaked)
*Baking of the system to remove water or hydrocarbons adsorbed to the walls
*Chilling of chamber walls to cryogenic temperatures during use
*Avoiding all traces of hydrocarbons, including skin oils in a fingerprint — gloves must always be used

Hydrogen and carbon monoxide are the most common background gases in a well-designed, well-baked UHV system. Both Hydrogen and CO diffuse out from the grain boundaries in stainless steel. Helium could diffuse through the steel and glass from the outside air, but this effect is usually negligible due to the low abundance of He in the atmosphere.

==Measurement==
===Pressure===

Measurement of high vacuum is done using a &quot;nonabsolute gauge&quot; that measures a pressure-related property of the vacuum. See, for example, Pacey. These gauges must be calibrated. The gauges capable of measuring the lowest pressures are magnetic gauges based upon the pressure dependence of the current in a spontaneous gas discharge in intersecting electric and magnetic fields.

UHV pressures are measured with an ion gauge, either of the hot filament or inverted magnetron type.

===Leak rate===
In any vacuum system, some gas will continue to escape into the chamber over time and slowly increase the pressure if it is not pumped out. This leak rate is usually measured in mbar L/s or torr L/s. While some gas release is inevitable, if the leak rate is too high, it can slow down or even prevent the system from reaching low pressure.

There are a variety of possible reasons for an increase in pressure. These include simple air leaks, virtual leaks, and desorption (either from surfaces or volume). A variety of methods for leak detection exist. Large leaks can be found by pressurizing the chamber, and looking for bubbles in soapy water, while tiny leaks can require more sensitive methods, up to using a tracer gas and specialized Helium mass spectrometer.

==Outgassing==
Outgassing is a problem for UHV systems. Outgassing can occur from two sources: surfaces and bulk materials. Outgassing from bulk materials is minimized by selection of materials with low vapor pressures (such as glass, stainless steel, and ceramics) for everything inside the system. Materials which are not generally considered absorbent can outgas, including most plastics and some metals. For example, vessels lined with a highly gas-permeable material such as palladium (which is a high-capacity hydrogen sponge) create special outgassing problems.

Outgassing from surfaces is a subtler problem. At extremely low pressures, more gas molecules are adsorbed on the walls than are floating in the chamber, so the total surface area inside a chamber is more important than its volume for reaching UHV. Water is a significant source of outgassing because a thin layer of water vapor rapidly adsorbs to everything whenever the chamber is opened to air. Water evaporates from surfaces too slowly to be fully removed at room temperature, but just fast enough to present a continuous level of background contamination. Removal of water and similar gases generally requires baking the UHV system at while vacuum pumps are running. During chamber use, the walls of the chamber may be chilled using liquid nitrogen to reduce outgassing further.

===Bake-out===
In order to reach low pressures, it is often useful to heat the entire system above for many hours (a process known as bake-out) to remove water and other trace gases which adsorb on the surfaces of the chamber. This may also be required upon &quot;cycling&quot; the equipment to atmosphere. This process significantly speeds up the process of outgassing, allowing low pressures to be reached much faster. After baking, to prevent humidity from getting back into the system after it is exposed to atmospheric pressure, a nitrogen gas flow that creates a small positive pressure can be maintained to keep the system dry.

==System design==

===Pumping===
There is no single vacuum pump that can operate all the way from atmospheric pressure to ultra-high vacuum. Instead, a series of different pumps is used, according to the appropriate pressure range for each pump. In the first stage, a roughing pump clears most of the gas from the chamber. This is followed by one or more vacuum pumps that operate at low pressures. Pumps commonly used in this second stage to achieve UHV include:
*Turbomolecular pumps (especially compound pumps which incorporate a molecular drag section and/or magnetic bearing types)
*Ion pumps
*Titanium sublimation pumps
*Non-evaporable getter (NEG) pumps
*Cryopumps
*Diffusion pumps, especially when used with a cryogenic trap designed to minimize backstreaming of pump oil into the systems.

Turbo pumps and diffusion pumps rely on supersonic attack upon system molecules by the blades and high speed vapor stream, respectively.

===Airlocks===
To save time, energy, and integrity of the UHV volume an airlock or load-lock vacuum system is often used. The airlock volume has one door or valve, such as a gate valve or UHV angle valve, facing the UHV side of the volume, and another door against atmospheric pressure through which samples or workpieces are initially introduced. After sample introduction and assuring that the door against atmosphere is closed, the airlock volume is typically pumped down to a medium-high vacuum. In some cases the workpiece itself is baked out or otherwise pre-cleaned under this medium-high vacuum. The gateway to the UHV chamber is then opened, the workpiece transferred to the UHV by robotic means or by other contrivance if necessary, and the UHV valve re-closed. While the initial workpiece is being processed under UHV, a subsequent sample can be introduced into the airlock volume, pre-cleaned, and so-on and so-forth, saving much time. Although a &quot;puff&quot; of gas is generally released into the UHV system when the valve to the airlock volume is opened, the UHV system pumps can generally snatch this gas away before it has time to adsorb onto the UHV surfaces. In a system well designed with suitable airlocks, the UHV components seldom need bakeout and the UHV may improve over time even as workpieces are introduced and removed.

===Seals===

Metal seals, with knife edges on both sides cutting into a soft, copper gasket are employed. This metal-to-metal seal can maintain pressures down to . Although generally considered single use, the skilled operator can obtain several uses through the use of feeler gauges of decreasing size with each iteration, as long as the knife edges are in perfect condition. For SRF cavities, indium seals are more commonly used in sealing two flat surfaces together using clamps to bring the surfaces together. The clamps need to be tightened slowly to ensure the indium seals compress uniformly all around. 

===Material limitations===
Many common materials are used sparingly if at all due to high vapor pressure, high adsorptivity or absorptivity resulting in subsequent troublesome outgassing, or high permeability in the face of differential pressure (i.e.: &quot;through-gassing&quot;):
* The majority of organic compounds cannot be used:
**Plastics, other than PTFE and PEEK: plastics in other uses are replaced with ceramics or metals. Limited use of fluoroelastomers (such as Viton) and perfluoroelastomers (such as Kalrez) as gasket materials can be considered if metal gaskets are inconvenient, though these polymers can be expensive. Although through-gassing of elastomerics can not be avoided, experiments have shown that slow out-gassing of water vapor is, initially at least, the more important limitation. This effect can be minimized by pre-baking under medium vacuum. When selecting O-rings, permeation rate and permeation coefficients need to be considered. For example the penetration rate of nitrogen in Viton seals is 100 times lower than the penetration of nitrogen in silicon seals, which impacts the ultimate vacuum that can be achieved. 
** Glues: special glues for high vacuum must be used, generally epoxies with a high mineral filler content. Among the most popular of these include asbestos in the formulation. This allows for an epoxy with good initial properties and able to retain reasonable performance across multiple bake-outs.
* Some steels: due to oxidization of carbon steel, which greatly increases adsorption area, only stainless steel is used. Particularly, non-leaded and low-sulfur austenitic grades such as 304 and 316 are preferred. These steels include at least 18% chromium and 8% nickel. Variants of stainless steel include low-carbon grades (such as 304L and 316L), and grades with additives such as niobium and molybdenum to reduce the formation of chromium carbide (which provides no corrosion resistance). Common designations include 316L (low carbon), and 316LN (low carbon with nitrogen), which can boast a significantly lower magnetic permeability with special welding techniques making them preferable for particle accelerator applications. Chromium carbide precipitation at the grain boundaries can render a stainless steel less resistant to oxidation.
* Lead: Soldering is performed using lead-free solder. Occasionally pure lead is used as a gasket material between flat surfaces in lieu of a copper/knife edge system.
* Indium: Indium is sometimes used as a deformable gasket material for vacuum seals, especially in cryogenic apparatus, but its low melting point prevents use in baked systems. In a more esoteric application, the low melting point of Indium is taken advantage of as a renewable seal in high vacuum valves. These valves are used several times, generally with the aid of a torque wrench set to increasing torque with each iteration. When the indium seal is exhausted, it is melted and reforms itself and thus is ready for another round of uses.
* Zinc, cadmium: High vapor pressures during system bake-out virtually preclude their use.
*Aluminum: Although aluminum itself has a vapor pressure which makes it unsuitable for use in UHV systems, the same oxides which protect aluminum against corrosion improve its characteristics under UHV. Although initial experiments with aluminum suggested milling under mineral oil to maintain a thin, consistent layer of oxide, it has become increasingly accepted that aluminum is a suitable UHV material without special preparation. Paradoxically, aluminum oxide, especially when embedded as particles in stainless steel as for example from sanding in an attempt to reduce the surface area of the steel, is considered a problematic contaminant.
* Cleaning is very important for UHV. Common cleaning procedures include degreasing with detergents, organic solvents, or chlorinated hydrocarbons. Electropolishing is often used to reduce the surface area from which adsorbed gases can be emitted. Etching of stainless steel using hydrofluoric and nitric acid forms a chromium rich surface, followed by a nitric acid passivation step, which forms a chromium oxide rich surface. This surface retards the diffusion of hydrogen into the chamber.

Technical limitations: 
* Screws: Threads have a high surface area and tend to &quot;trap&quot; gases, and therefore, are avoided. Blind holes are especially avoided, due to the trapped gas at the base of the screw and slow venting through the threads, which is commonly known as a &quot;virtual leak&quot;. This can be mitigated by designing components to include through-holes for all threaded connections, or by using vented screws (which have a hole drilled through their central axis or a notch along the threads). Vented Screws allow trapped gases to flow freely from the base of the screw, eliminating virtual leaks and speeding up the pump-down process.
* Welding: Processes such as gas metal arc welding and shielded metal arc welding cannot be used, due to the deposition of impure material and potential introduction of voids or porosity. Gas tungsten arc welding (with an appropriate heat profile and properly selected filler material) is necessary. Other clean processes, such as electron beam welding or laser beam welding, are also acceptable; however, those that involve potential slag inclusions (such as submerged arc welding and flux-cored arc welding) are obviously not. To avoid trapping gas or high vapor pressure molecules, welds must fully penetrate the joint or be made from the interior surface, otherwise a virtual leak might appear.

=== UHV manipulator ===

A UHV manipulator allows an object which is inside a vacuum chamber and under vacuum to be mechanically positioned. It may provide rotary
motion, linear motion, or a combination of both. The most complex devices give motion in three axes and rotations around two of those axes. To generate the mechanical movement inside the chamber, three basic mechanisms are commonly employed: a mechanical coupling through the vacuum wall (using a vacuum-tight seal around the coupling: a welded metal bellows for example), a magnetic coupling that transfers motion from air-side to vacuum-side: or a sliding seal using special greases of very low vapor pressure or ferromagnetic fluid. Such special greases can exceed USD $400 per kilogram. Various forms of motion control are available for manipulators, such as knobs, handwheels, motors, stepping motors, piezoelectric motors, and pneumatics. The use of motors in a vacuum environment often requires special design or other special considerations, as the convective cooling taken for granted under atmospheric conditions is not available in a UHV environment.

The manipulator or sample holder may include features that allow additional control and testing of a sample, such as the ability to apply heat, cooling, voltage, or a magnetic field. Sample heating can be accomplished by electron bombardment or thermal radiation. For electron bombardment, the sample holder is equipped with a filament which emits electrons when biased at a high negative potential. The impact of the
electrons bombarding the sample at high energy causes it to heat. For thermal radiation, a filament is mounted close to the sample and resistively heated to high temperature. The infrared energy from the filament heats the sample.

== Typical uses ==

Ultra-high vacuum is necessary for many surface analytic techniques such as: 
* X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
* Auger electron spectroscopy (AES)
* Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)
* Thermal desorption spectroscopy (TPD)
* Thin film growth and preparation techniques with stringent requirements for purity, such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), UHV chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD) and UHV pulsed laser deposition (PLD)
* Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
* Field emission microscopy and Field ion microscopy
* Atom Probe Tomography (APT)

UHV is necessary for these applications to reduce surface contamination, by reducing the number of molecules reaching the sample over a given time period. At , it only takes 1 second to cover a surface with a contaminant, so much lower pressures are needed for long experiments.

UHV is also required for:
* Particle accelerators The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has three UH vacuum systems. The lowest pressure is found in the pipes the proton beam speeds through near the interaction (collision) points. Here helium cooling pipes also act as cryopumps. The maximum allowable pressure is 
* Gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO, VIRGO, GEO 600, and TAMA 300. The LIGO experimental apparatus is housed in a vacuum chamber at in order to eliminate temperature fluctuations and sound waves which would jostle the mirrors far too much for gravitational waves to be sensed. 
* Atomic physics experiments which use cold atoms, such as ion trapping or making Bose–Einstein condensates.

While not compulsory, it can prove beneficial in applications such as:
* Molecular beam epitaxy, E-beam evaporation, sputtering and other deposition techniques.
* Atomic force microscopy. High vacuum enables high Q factors on the cantilever oscillation.
* Scanning tunneling microscopy. High vacuum reduces oxidation and contamination, hence enables imaging and the achievement of atomic resolution on clean metal and semiconductor surfaces, e.g. imaging the surface reconstruction of the unoxidized silicon surface.
* Electron-beam lithography

<text>The Island Council is the legislature of the Pitcairn Islands.

==Structure==
The Council has ten members, seven (five Councillors, the Mayor, and the Deputy Mayor) of whom are elected by popular vote and are the only members that are allowed to vote during any Council meeting. The other three are &quot;ex-officio&quot; members: the Administrator (who serves as both the head of government and the representative of the Governor of the Pitcairn Islands), the Governor, and the Deputy Governor. The Councillors and the Deputy Mayor all serve two year terms. The Mayor is elected for three years and is eligible to serve a second term in office, whilst the Administrator is appointed by the Governor for an indefinite term.

there is one councillor per every just ~5 people, making this the Most representative official legislature of any country, non-sovereign entity, or unrecognized states. 

==History==
The presiding officer of the council was traditionally the &quot;Magistrate&quot;, who held executive, legislative, and judicial authority. Following a constitutional review in 1998, this office was divided and replaced by the &quot;Mayor&quot; and the &quot;council chairman,&quot; effective from 1999.

Until 2011 the Governor appointed a second member of the Council. However, this position was scrapped in favour of introducing the fifth elected seat.

==Council membership==
As of 9 August 2022, the composition of the Island Council was:

Voting members:
*Mayor: Simon Young
*Deputy Mayor: Shawn Christian
*Councillors: Michele Christian, Heather Menzies, Simon Young, Torika Christian, and Leslie Jaques

Non-voting (ex-officio) Members:
*Administrator : Lindsy Thompson
*Governor: Iona Thomas
*Deputy Governor: Alasdair Hamilton

<text>A planimeter, also known as a platometer, is a measuring instrument used to determine the area of an arbitrary two-dimensional shape.

==Construction== 
There are several kinds of planimeters, but all operate in a similar way. The precise way in which they are constructed varies, with the main types of mechanical planimeter being polar, linear, and Prytz or &quot;hatchet&quot; planimeters. The Swiss mathematician Jakob Amsler-Laffon built the first modern planimeter in 1854, the concept having been pioneered by Johann Martin Hermann in 1818. Many developments followed Amsler&#x27;s famous planimeter, including electronic versions.

The Amsler (polar) type consists of a two-bar linkage. At the end of one link is a pointer, used to trace around the boundary of the shape to be measured. The other end of the linkage pivots freely on a weight that keeps it from moving. Near the junction of the two links is a measuring wheel of calibrated diameter, with a scale to show fine rotation, and worm gearing for an auxiliary turns counter scale. As the area outline is traced, this wheel rolls on the surface of the drawing. The operator sets the wheel, turns the counter to zero, and then traces the pointer around the perimeter of the shape. When the tracing is complete, the scales at the measuring wheel show the shape&#x27;s area.

When the planimeter&#x27;s measuring wheel moves perpendicular to its axis, it rolls, and this movement is recorded. When the measuring wheel moves parallel to its axis, the wheel skids without rolling, so this movement is ignored. That means the planimeter measures the distance that its measuring wheel travels, projected perpendicularly to the measuring wheel&#x27;s axis of rotation. The area of the shape is proportional to the number of turns through which the measuring wheel rotates.

The polar planimeter is restricted by design to measuring areas within limits determined by its size and geometry. However, the linear type has no restriction in one dimension, because it can roll. Its wheels must not slip, because the movement must be constrained to a straight line.

Developments of the planimeter can establish the position of the first moment of area (center of mass), and even the second moment of area.

The images show the principles of a linear and a polar planimeter. The pointer M at one end of the planimeter follows the contour C of the surface S to be measured. For the linear planimeter the movement of the &quot;elbow&quot; E is restricted to the &quot;y&quot;-axis. For the polar planimeter the &quot;elbow&quot; is connected to an arm with its other endpoint O at a fixed position. Connected to the arm ME is the measuring wheel with its axis of rotation parallel to ME. A movement of the arm ME can be decomposed into a movement perpendicular to ME, causing the wheel to rotate, and a movement parallel to ME, causing the wheel to skid, with no contribution to its reading.

==Principle==
The working of the linear planimeter may be explained by measuring the area of a rectangle ABCD (see image). Moving with the pointer from A to B the arm EM moves through the yellow parallelogram, with area equal to PQ×EM. This area is also equal to the area of the parallelogram A&quot;ABB&quot;. The measuring wheel measures the distance PQ (perpendicular to EM). Moving from C to D the arm EM moves through the green parallelogram, with area equal to the area of the rectangle D&quot;DCC&quot;. The measuring wheel now moves in the opposite direction, subtracting this reading from the former. The movements along BC and DA are the same but opposite, so they cancel each other with no net effect on the reading of the wheel. The net result is the measuring of the difference of the yellow and green areas, which is the area of ABCD.

==Mathematical derivation==
The operation of a linear planimeter can be justified by applying Green&#x27;s theorem, though the design of the major varieties predates the theorem&#x27;s proof. Apply it to the components of the vector field N, given by:

:formula_1

where &quot;b&quot; is the &quot;y&quot;-coordinate of the elbow E.

This vector field is perpendicular to the measuring arm EM:

:formula_2

and has a constant size, equal to the length &quot;m&quot; of the measuring arm:

:formula_3

Then:
:formula_4

because:
:formula_5

The left hand side of the above equation, which is equal to the area &quot;A&quot; enclosed by the contour, is proportional to the distance measured by the measuring wheel, with proportionality factor &quot;m&quot;, the length of the measuring arm.

The justification for the above derivation lies in noting that the linear planimeter only records movement perpendicular to its measuring arm, or when 
:formula_6 is non-zero. When this quantity is integrated over the closed curve C, Green&#x27;s theorem and the area follow.

=== Polar coordinates ===
The connection with Green&#x27;s theorem can be understood in terms of integration in polar coordinates: in polar coordinates, area is computed by the integral formula_7 where the form being integrated is &quot;quadratic&quot; in &quot;r,&quot; meaning that the rate at which area changes with respect to change in angle varies quadratically with the radius.

For a parametric equation in polar coordinates, where both &quot;r&quot; and &quot;θ&quot; vary as a function of time, this becomes
formula_8

For a polar planimeter the total rotation of the wheel is proportional to formula_9 as the rotation is proportional to the distance traveled, which at any point in time is proportional to radius and to change in angle, as in the circumference of a circle (formula_10).

This last integrand formula_11 can be recognized as the derivative of the earlier integrand formula_12 (with respect to &quot;r&quot;), and shows that a polar planimeter computes the area integral in terms of the &quot;derivative&quot;, which is reflected in Green&#x27;s theorem, which equates a line integral of a function on a (1-dimensional) contour to the (2-dimensional) integral of the derivative.

<text>Bde Maka Ska ( , previously named Lake Calhoun) is the largest lake in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, and part of the city&#x27;s Chain of Lakes. Surrounded by city park land and circled by bike and walking trails, it is popular for many outdoor activities. The lake has an area of and a maximum depth of .

==Lake and surrounding area==

The lake is part of the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway, connecting with Lake of the Isles on the northeast, Cedar Lake and Brownie Lake on the northwest, and Lake Harriet on the south. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board trail system has a trail around the lake for bicyclists and skaters and a trail around it for pedestrians. Both of these trails connect to the larger trail system via connections to Lake of the Isles and Lake Harriet. In addition, the Midtown Greenway Trail is located just north of the lake and Lake Street. The lake itself is popular for canoeing, kayaking, and windsurfing, and it has three swimming beaches.

The three beaches are North Beach on the north side of the lake, 32nd Beach on the east, and Thomas Beach on the south. There is Bde Maka Ska Park and surrounding park land offers parking, picnicking, volleyball, and athletic fields. It is also home of sailing, hosting the Calhoun Yacht Club, the Minneapolis Sailing Center, as well as local high school teams and the University of St. Thomas Sailing Team.
During 1829–1839, it was the site of the Bdewákhathuŋwaŋ Dakota agricultural village known as Ḣeyate Otuŋwe. A plaque on the east side of the lake commemorates the mission station built by Samuel and Gideon Pond where they created the first alphabet for the Dakota language at Cloudman&#x27;s Village. In 2019, the Bde Maka Ska Public Art Project was completed on the village site. On the west side is The Bakken, an old mansion with medicinal gardens and a library and museum devoted to medical electricity and the history of electromagnetism. The Como-Harriet Streetcar Line operates between the lake and Lake Harriet.

== Naming ==
===Historic names===
The Dakota originally called the lake (standardized Lakota/Dakota spelling ; English approximation: &quot;Be-DAY Mah-KAH-Ska&quot;) meaning &#x27;Lake White Earth&#x27;, or &#x27;Lake White Bank&#x27;, a name that probably was given by the Ioway who inhabited the area until the 16th century. Another Dakota name for the lake may have been , which was the name initially adopted by settlers, either as &quot;Lake Medoza&quot; or in translation as &quot;Loon Lake&quot;. The Dakota also described it as , meaning &#x27;the set back lake&#x27;.

===Calhoun naming===
The United States Secretary of War, John C. Calhoun, sent the Army to survey the area that would surround Fort Snelling in 1817. Calhoun had also authorized the construction of Fort Snelling, one of the earliest American settlements in the state. The surveyors named the water body &quot;Lake Calhoun&quot; in his honor, and the Fort Snelling Military Reservation survey map of Lt. James L. Thompson in 1839 shows that name for the lake.

===Calhoun–Bde Maka Ska naming dispute===
Calhoun&#x27;s legacy as a slaveowner and pro-slavery politician led critics to question whether he was the best person to be honored. In 2011 the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board (MPRB) visited the issue. Their legal counsel concluded that the board could not legally change the name, as state law gives that power to the Commissioner of Natural Resources, and then only in the first 40 years after the name was designated. Following the Charleston church shooting in June 2015, a fresh drive to change the name started via an online petition and the Park Board indicated it would look into whether they could change the lake&#x27;s name through state action. At the time, the &quot;Minneapolis Star Tribune&quot; published an article quoting Calhoun&#x27;s views on the black race (see 1840 census controversy):

The number of deaf and dumb, blind, idiots and insane of the Negroes in the States that have changed the ancient relations between the races [and are no longer slaves] is one out of every ninety-six; while in the States adhering to it [slavery], it is one out of every six hundred and sixty-one; being nearly six to one against the free blacks in the same state

as well as his actions in ordering the flogging of one of his own slaves. In fall 2015 the board added the Dakota name to signage below the official name. In March 2016, an advisory group decided by majority vote to urge the MPRB to restore the lake&#x27;s former name. There was also a proposal to rename the lake for Senator Paul Wellstone, who is buried in nearby Lakewood Cemetery.

In 2017, the Minneapolis Park Board voted unanimously to recommend changing the lake&#x27;s name back to Bde Maka Ska and the Hennepin County commissioners agreed. In January 2018, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) made Bde Maka Ska the official name in Minnesota. To change it at the federal level, the state submitted materials to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, which approved the change in June 2018. Park signs around the lake use only the name Bde Maka Ska.

On April 29, 2019, the Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the DNR, holding that a name that had been in use more than 40 years could only be changed by the legislature. The MPRB stated they would continue to keep the signage of Bde Maka Ska at the lake and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, &quot;I will continue to call Bde Maka Ska by its rightful name. That was the lake&#x27;s name before people who look like me renamed it to honor a slavery apologist and as far as I&#x27;m concerned that is still its name today&quot;. The DNR appealed the court decision, and also released a statement confirming that the federal Board on Geographic Names (BGN) had adopted Bde Maka Ska as the lake&#x27;s official name. Executive secretary of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names Lou Yost said, &quot;State legislation (or court ruling) is not binding on the Federal Government. The name at the Federal level will remain Bde Maka Ska as was approved at the BGN&#x27;s June 21, 2018 meeting&quot;. The Minnesota Court of Appeals decision was appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court, which heard oral argument November 13, 2019. On May 13, 2020, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources had the authority to rename Lake Calhoun as Bde Maka Ska, ruling that the law restricting renaming only applied to county boards, not to the DNR.

==Wildlife==

The lake contains black crappie, bluegill, bowfin, common carp, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, tiger muskellunge, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch. Some fish consumption guideline restrictions have been placed on the lake&#x27;s bluegill, crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, and white sucker due to mercury and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid contamination.

In 1991, the then-Minnesota state record tiger muskellunge at was caught in the lake. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation website lists the lake as one of the best in the city for ice fishing walleye, northern pike, and crappies.

Zebra mussels, an aquatic invasive species, were found in the lake in 2018.

<text>Gesta Hungarorum, or The Deeds of the Hungarians, is the earliest book about Hungarian history which has survived for posterity. Its genre is not chronicle, but &quot;gesta&quot;, meaning &quot;deeds&quot; or &quot;acts&quot;, which is a medieval entertaining literature. It was written in Latin by an unidentified author who has traditionally been called Anonymus in scholarly works. According to most historians, the work was completed between around 1200 and 1230. The &quot;Gesta&quot; exists in a sole manuscript from the second part of the 13th century, which was for centuries held in Vienna. It is part of the collection of Széchényi National Library in Budapest.

The principal subject of the &quot;Gesta&quot; is the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries, and it writes of the origin of the Hungarians, identifying the Hungarians&#x27; ancestors with the ancient Scythians and Huns. Many of its sources—including the Bible, Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Etymologiae&quot;, the 7th-century &quot;Exordia Scythica&quot;, the late 9th-century Regino of Prüm&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot;, and early medieval romances of Alexander the Great—have been identified by scholars. Anonymus also used folk songs and ballads when writing his work. He knew a version of the late 11th-century &quot;Hungarian Chronicle&quot; the text of which has partially been preserved in his work and in later chronicles, but his narration of the Hungarian Conquest differs from the version provided by the other chronicles. Anonymus did not mention the opponents of the conquering Hungarians known from sources written around 900, but he wrote of the Hungarians&#x27; fight against rulers unknown from other sources. According to a scholarly theory, he used place names when naming the opponents of the Hungarians.

==Background==

Although the Hungarians, or Magyars, seem to have used their own alphabet before adopting Christianity in the 11th century, most information of their early history was recorded by Muslim, Byzantine and Western European authors. For instance, the &quot;Annals of Fulda&quot;, Regino of Prüm&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot;, and Emperor Constantine VII&#x27;s &quot;De administrando imperio&quot; contain contemporaneous or nearly contemporaneous reports of their conquest of the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries. Among the Hungarians, oral tradition—songs and ballads—preserved the memory of the most important historical events. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; explicitly stated that the &quot;seven captains&quot; who led the Hungarians during the Conquest &quot;composed lays about themselves and sang them among themselves in order to win worldly renown and to publish their names abroad, so that their posterity might be able to boast and brag to neighbours and friends when these songs were heard&quot;.

The &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, or &quot;The Deeds of the Hungarians&quot;, is the first extant Hungarian chronicle. Its principal subject is the conquest of the Carpathian Basin and it narrates the background and the immediate aftermath of the conquest. Many historiansincluding Carlile Aylmer Macartney and András Róna-Tasagree that Simon of Kéza&#x27;s chronicle, the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; and other works composed in the 13th–15th centuries preserved texts which had been written before the completion of the &quot;Gesta&quot;. They say that the first &quot;Hungarian Chronicle&quot; was completed in the second half of the 11th century or in the early 12th century. The existence of this ancient chronicle is proven by later sources. One Ricardus&#x27;s report of a journey of a group of Dominican friars in the early 1230s refers to a chronicle, &quot;The Deeds of the Christian Hungarians&quot;, which contained information of an eastern &quot;Magna Hungaria&quot;. The &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; from 1358 refers to &quot;the ancient books about the deeds of the Hungarians&quot; in connection with the pagan uprisings of the 11th century. The earliest &quot;Hungarian Chronicle&quot; was expanded and rewritten several times in the 12th–14th centuries, but its content can only be reconstructed based on 14th-century works.

==Manuscript==
The work exists in a sole manuscript. The codex is in size and contains 24 folios, including two blank pages. The first page of the codex originally contained the beginning of the &quot;Gesta&quot;. It was blanked because the scribe had made mistakes when writing the text. The work was written in a Gothic minuscule. The style of the letters and decorations, including the elaborate initial on its first page, shows that the manuscript was completed in the middle or in the second part of the 13th century. Scribal errors suggest that the extant manuscript is a copy of the original work. For instance, the scribe wrote &quot;Cleopatram&quot; instead of &quot;Neopatram&quot; in the text narrating a Hungarian raid in the Byzantine Empire although the context clearly shows that the author of the &quot;Gesta&quot; referred to Neopatras (now Ypati in Greece).

The history of the manuscript up until the early 17th century is unknown. It became part of the collection of the Imperial Library in Vienna between 1601 and 1636. In this period, the court librarian Sebastian Tengnagel registered it under the title &quot;Historia Hungarica de VII primis ducibus Hungariae auctore Belae regis notario&quot; (&quot;Hungarian History of the First Seven Princes of Hungary Written by King Béla&#x27;s Notary&quot;). Tengnagel added numbers to the folios and the chapters. The codex was bound with a leather book cover, impressed with a double-headed eagle, in the late 18th century. The manuscript, which was transferred to Hungary in 1933 or 1934, is held in the Széchényi National Library in Budapest.

==The author==
The author of the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; has been known as Anonymus ever since the publication of the first Hungarian translation of his work in 1790. The author described himself as &quot;P who is called magister, and sometime notary of the most glorious Béla, king of Hungary of fond memory&quot; in the opening sentence of the &quot;Gesta&quot;. The identification of this King Béla is subject to scholarly debate, because four Hungarian monarchs bore this name. Most historians identify the king with Béla III of Hungary who died in 1196.

Anonymus dedicated his work to &quot;the most venerable man N&quot; who had been his schoolmate in an unspecified school. Anonymus mentioned that they had found pleasure in reading the &quot;Trojan History&quot;, a work attributed to Dares Phrygius, which enjoyed popularity in the Middle Ages. He also referred to a work of the Trojan War that he had &quot;brought most lovingly together into one volume&quot; upon his masters&#x27; instructions. Anonymus stated that he had decided to write of &quot;the genealogy of the kings of Hungary and of their noblemen&quot; because he had no knowledge of any decent account of the Hungarian Conquest. According to scholars who identify Anonymus as King Béla III&#x27;s notary, he wrote his &quot;Gesta&quot; around 1200 or in the first decades of the 13th century.

The study of place names mentioned in the &quot;Gesta&quot; suggests that Anonymus had a detailed knowledge both of the wider region of Óbuda and Csepel Island (in and to the south of present-day Budapest) and of the lands along the upper courses of the river Tisza. For instance, he mentioned a dozen places—settlements, ferries and streams—in the former region, including &quot;a small river that flows through a stone culvert&quot; to Óbuda. He did not write of the southern and eastern parts of Transylvania.

==Sources==
Minstrels and folk-singers reciting heroic songs were well-known figures of the age of Anonymus. He explicitly referred to &quot;the gabbling rhymes of minstrels and the spurious tales of peasants who have not forgotten the brave deeds and wars of the Hungarians&quot; even to his time. However, he did not conceal his scorn for oral tradition, stating that it &quot;would be most unworthy and completely unfitting for the so most noble people of Hungary to hear as if in sleep of the beginning of their kind and of their bravery and deeds from the false stories of peasants and the gabbling song of minstrels&quot;. All the same, stylistic elements (including formulaic repetitions which can be found in his text) imply that he occasionally used heroic songs. According to Kristó, the legend of Emese&#x27;s dream of the &quot;falcon that seemed to come to her and impregnate her&quot; was one of the motifs that Anonymus borrowed from oral tradition.

Anonymus, as Macartney says, claimed to &quot;rely solely on written sources, as alone trustworthy&quot; when writing his work. Among his sources, Anonymus explicitly mentioned the Bible and Dares Phrygius&#x27;s &quot;Trojan History&quot;. He borrowed texts from the latter work and adopted its &quot;overall structure of short but informative accounts naming important protagonists and main events&quot;, according to historians Martyn Rady and László Veszprémy. Anonymus also referred to &quot;historians writing of the deeds of the Romans&quot; when narrating the history of the Scythians. According to Kristó, Györffy and Thoroczkay, Anonymus obviously read the so-called &quot;Exordia Scythica&quot; (&quot;Scythian Genesis&quot;), a 7th-century abridgement of a work of the 2nd-century historian, Justin.

Anonymus used Regino of Prüm&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot;, that he mentioned as &quot;the annals of chronicles&quot; in his &quot;Gesta&quot;. He accepted Regino of Prüm&#x27;s view when identifying the Scythians as the Hungarians&#x27; ancestors. Sometimes, he misinterpreted his sources. For instance, he wrote of &quot;the boundaries of the Caranthians of the Mura&quot; (&quot;Carinthinorum Moroanensium fines&quot;) instead of the &quot;lands of the Carinthians, Moravians&quot; (&quot;Carantenorum, Marahensium ... fines&quot;) of which he read in Regino of Prüm&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon&quot;, which shows that Anonymus did not understand Regino of Prüm&#x27;s reference to the Moravians.

Direct borrowings from Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Etymologiae&quot;, Hugh of Bologna&#x27;s &quot;Rationes dictani prosaice&quot;, and medieval romances about Alexander the Great prove that Anonymus also used these works. According to Macartney, textual coincidences show that Anonymus adopted parts of late 12th-century chronicles narrating Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s crusade. For instance, Anonymus&#x27; descriptions of tournaments seem to have been taken from Arnold of Lübeck&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle of the Slavs&quot;.

Anonymus also used the ancient &quot;Hungarian Chronicle&quot; or its sources. However, there are differences between Anonymus&#x27; narration of the Hungarian Conquest and other works preserving texts from the ancient chronicle. For instance, the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; wrote of the Hungarians&#x27; arrival in Transylvania across the Carpathian Mountains from the east at the beginning of the Conquest, but according to Anonymus the Hungarians invaded Transylvania across the valleys of the Meseş Mountains from the west at a later stage.

Sources from the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries mentioned more than a dozen persons who played an important role in the history of the Carpathian Basin at the time of the Hungarian Conquest. Anonymus did not mention any of them; he did not refer, for instance, to Emperor Arnulf of Carinthia, Boris I of Bulgaria, and Svatopluk I of Moravia. On the other hand, none of the persons whom Anonymus listed among the opponents of the conquering Hungarians—for instance, the Bulgarian Salan, the Khazar Menumorut and the Vlach Gelouwere mentioned in other sources. According to Györffy, Engel, and other historians, Anonymus either invented these personalities or listed them anachronistically among the conquering Hungarians&#x27; opponents. Martyn Rady and László Veszprémy explicitly describe the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; as a &quot;&#x27;toponymic romance&#x27;that seeks to explain place-names by reference to imagined events or persons, and vice versa.&quot; For instance, Györffy writes that Gelou&#x27;s story was based on the conquest of Gyula of Transylvania&#x27;s realm by Stephen I of Hungary in the early 11th century and Gelou was named after the town Gilău where he was killed in battle, according to Anonymus. Anonymus likewise wrote that the Bulgarian Laborec had died at the River Laborec and the Czech Zubur on the Mount Zobor near Nitra.

Anonymus did not allude to the Hungarians&#x27; decisive victory over the united Bavarian forces in the Battle of Pressburg in 907, but he narrated battles unknown from other works. Anonymus seems to have applied place names when creating these battles, according to Győrffy. For instance, the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; wrote of a battle between the Greeks and the Hungarians at a ford by the River Tisza which was named after this event as &quot;Ford of the Greeks&quot;, according to Anonymus, although it received this name after its revenues were granted to the Greek Orthodox monastery of Sremska Mitrovica in the 12th century.

Late 9th-century sources mentioned the Avars, the Bavarians, the Bulgarians, the Danubian Slavs, the Gepids and the Moravians among the peoples inhabiting the Carpathian Basin. Anonymus did not mention the Avars, the Bavarians, the Gepids and the Moravians, but he listed the Czechs, the Greeks, the Khazars, the &quot;Romans&quot; and their shepherds, the Székelys, and the Vlachs besides the Bulgarians and the Slavs. According to Györffy and Madgearu, Anonymus may have based his list of the peoples inhabiting the Carpathian Basin on the local Slavs&#x27; oral tradition which was preserved in the early 12th-century &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot;. The latter source described the Slavs as the first settlers in the Carpathian Basin and mentioned that they were conquered by the &quot;Volokhi&quot; before the Hungarians arrived and expelled the &quot;Volokhi&quot;. According to Györffy, Kristó and other historians, Anonymus misinterpreted his source when identifying the &quot;Volokhi&quot; with the Vlachs, because the &quot;Volokhi&quot; were actually Franks who occupied Pannonia, but the Hungarians expelled them during the Conquest. But Spinei, Pop and other historians write that &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot; confirms Anonymus&#x27;s report of the Hungarians&#x27; fight against the Vlachs. Madgearu, who does not associate the &quot;Volokhi&quot; with the Vlachs, emphasizes that Anonymous &quot;had no interest to invent the presence of the [Vlachs] in Transylvania in the 10th century, because if [Vlachs] had indeed arrived there in the 12th century, his readers would not have believed this assertion&quot;. Györffy says that the Vlachs, Cumans, Czechs and other peoples whose presence in the late-9th-century Carpathian Basin cannot be proven based on sources from the same period reflects the situation of the late 13th century.

==Structure==
The &quot;Gesta&quot; contains a prologue and 57 chapters.

In the prologue, Anonymus introduced himself and declared that he decided to write his work to put in writing the early history of the Hungarians and their conquest of the Carpathian Basin. In addition, he stated that he wanted to write of the genealogy of the royal Árpád dynasty and of the noble families of the Kingdom of Hungary.

The first seven chapters describe the Hungarians&#x27; legendary homelandmentioned as Scythia or &quot;Dentumoger&quot;and their departure from there. According to Macartney, the first chapter was based on the late 11th-century &quot;Hungarian Chronicle&quot;, and it contains interpolations from the &quot;Exordia Scythica&quot; and Regino of Prüm&#x27;s chronicle. The second chapter explains that the Hungarians were named after &quot;Hunguar&quot; (present-day Uzhhorod in Ukraine). The third chapter preserved the totemistic pre-Christian tradition of the origin of the Árpád dynasty, narrating Emese&#x27;s dream of the falcon impregnating her before the birth of her son, Álmos. The next section describes Álmos, mentioning that he was &quot;more powerful and wiser than all the princes of Scythia&quot;, which may have derived from oral tradition or from the common wording of contemporaneous legal documents. The fifth chapter writes of the election of Álmos as &quot;the leader and master&quot; of the Hungarians, mentioning a blood-mingling ceremony. In this section, Anonymus states that the Hungarians &quot;chose to seek for themselves the land of Pannonia that they had heard from rumor had been the land of King Attila&quot; whom Anonymus describes as Álmos&#x27;s forefather. The next chapter narrates the oath that the leaders of the Hungarians took after Álmos&#x27;s election, including the confirmation of the hereditary right of Álmos&#x27;s descendants to rule and the right of his electors and his electors&#x27; offspring to hold the highest offices in the realm. In the seventh chapter, Anonymus writes of the Hungarians&#x27; departure from Scythia and their route across the river &quot;Etil&quot; and &quot;Russia which is called Suzdal&quot; to Kiev.

The next four sections of the &quot;Gesta&quot; describe the fights of the Hungarians with the Rus&#x27; people and the &quot;Cumans&quot;. Anonymus&#x27;s report of the Hungarians&#x27; passing by Kiev was based on the ancient &quot;Hungarian Chronicle&quot;, according to Macartney. References to the Hungarians&#x27; march by Kiev towards the Carpathian Basin can also be found in the &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot;, and in Simon of Kéza&#x27;s and Henry of Mügeln&#x27;s chronicles. In an attempt to make his work more entertaining, Anonymus supplemented this information with vivid battle-scenes borrowed from the &quot;Trojan History&quot; and the romances about Alexander the Great, according to Macartney. Anonymus mentions an alliance between the Rus&#x27; people and the &quot;Cumans&quot; against the Hungarians. Macartney, Györffy, Spinei and many other historians agree that he misinterpreted the Hungarian word &quot;kun&quot;, which originally designated all nomadic Turkic peoples, and wrongly identified the &quot;Kuns&quot; mentioned in one of his sources with the Cumans of his age. The latter had at least twice supported the Rus&#x27; princes against the Hungarian monarchs in the 12th century, which explains Anonymus&#x27;s mistake. The ninth chapter of the &quot;Gesta&quot; describes the submission of the Rus&#x27; and &quot;Cuman&quot; princes to Álmos. Anonymus also writes how seven Cuman chieftains joined the Hungarians, which may have preserved the memory of the integration of the Kabars in the Hungarian tribal alliance based on oral tradition of the noble families of Kabar origin, according to Györffy.

==Reception and editions==
The existence of a sole manuscript of the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; shows that the chronicle &quot;was not very popular during either its author&#x27;s lifetime or the subsequent centuries&quot;, according to historian Florin Curta. For instance, the contemporary 13th century Friar Julian and his Dominican brethren studied a century earlier work: &quot;The Deeds of the Christian Hungarians&quot; instead of Anonymus&#x27;s work before departing for the ancient homeland of the Magyars in the early 1230s. Later chronicles did not use the &quot;Gesta&quot;, suggesting that Anonymus&#x27;s contemporaries knew that he had invented most details of his account of the Hungarian Conquest, according to Gyula Kristó.

The &quot;Gesta&quot; was first published as the first volume of the series &quot;Scriptures rerum Hungaricarum&quot; in 1746 by Johann Georg von Schwandtner. Matthias Bél wrote a preface to this first edition. Professors of the Universities of Halle and Göttingen soon raised their doubts about the reliability of the &quot;Gesta&quot;, emphasizing, for instance, the anachronistic description of the Rus&#x27; principalities. The Slovak scholar Juraj Sklenár dismissed Anonymus&#x27;s work in the 1780s, pointing out that Anonymus failed to mention Great Moravia..

When demanding the emancipation of the Romanians of Transylvania in the late 18th century, the authors of the &quot;Supplex Libellus Valachorum&quot; referred to Anonymus&#x27;s work. Anonymus&#x27;s three heroesGelou, Glad and Menumorutplay a preeminent role in Romanian historiography. Romanian historians have presented them as Romanian rulers whose presence in the &quot;Gesta&quot; proves the existence of Romanian polities in the territory of present-day Romania at the time of the Hungarian Conquest. The Romanian government even published a full-page advertisement about the reliability of Anonymus&#x27;s reference to the Romanians in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1987.

The view of modern historians on the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; is mixed: some consider it a reliable source; others consider its information doubtful. Alexandru Madgearu, who wrote a monography of the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, concluded that the &quot;analysis of several fragments of&quot; the Gesta Hungarorum &quot;has demonstrated that this work is generally credible, even if it ignores important events and characters and even if it makes some chronological mistakes&quot;. According to Neagu Djuvara, professor of international law and economic history, the factual accuracy of Anonymus&#x27;s work is likely high, because it is the earliest preserved Hungarian chronicle and is based on even older Hungarian chronicles. On the other hand, Carlile Aylmer Macartney described Anonymus&#x27;s work as &quot;the most famous, the most obscure, the most exasperating and most misleading of all the early Hungarian texts&quot; in his book of medieval Hungarian historians. Carlile Aylmer Macartney writes in his critical and analytical guide of Anonymus &quot;this is not evidence that he introduced the whole person of Gelou or the presence of Vlachs in Transylvania&quot;. Paul Robert Magocsi also regarded the &quot;Gesta&quot; as an unreliable work. Romanian-British historian Dennis Deletant joins the opinion that it is a debatable chronicle, criticizing how Anonymous has the Hungarians fighting Bulgarians while making no mention of the Moravians, Carinthians, Franks and Bavarians, and also his reliance upon legends and historical tradition than facts, such as in the parts where he makes the dubious claim that the Hungarian leader Almos was descended from Attila. Deletant further concludes that the cases for and against the existence of Gelou and the Vlachs simply cannot be proven. Martyn Rady, the translator of the first English version of the Gesta, states that &quot;It is at best to project contemporary conditions backwards.&quot;

<doc id="1103391" wikidata="Q528444" url="?curid=1103391" title="Greek National Road 3">
<text>Greek National Road 3 (, abbreviated as EO3) is a single carriageway road in Greece. It connects Elefsina near Athens with the border of North Macedonia at Niki. It passes through Larissa and Florina. At Niki, it connects with the M5K motorway to Bitola. The section Kozani - Niki is also designated as the A27 motorway, part of which is operational as a 2-lane motorway.

Greek National Road 3 is one of the longest national roads in Greece and until the 1960s it served as the main route from Larissa to Thessaloniki. The A1 motorway now offers a faster connection to Thessaloniki. Most of the EO3, except the southernmost section between Eleusis and Bralos, is part of the E65.

==Future developments==
Throughout the late 1980s, motorway bypasses were constructed at the towns of Tyrnavos and Elassonas, but in 2002 plans surfaced to convert all of the road into a new motorway, from Larissa to Kozani and further on to Bitola, in North Macedonia. Throughout the 2000s motorway sections were delivered to the public and are running north of Larissa and north of Kozani, up to Ptolemaida. Remaining parts have either fallen through, as no construction works are currently being undertaken and no further announcements have been delivered by the government.

==Route==

The EO3 is officially defined as a north-south route through central Greece, running between Elefsina to the south and the Greece–North Macedonia border to the north at Niki: however, the EO3 is split into two parts, because the A27 motorway replaced a short segment of the former near Mavrodendri.

The section between Elefsina and Kozani passes through Thebes, Livadeia, Bralos, Lamia, Farsala, Larissa, Elassona and Servia: the section between Mavrodendri and Niki passes through Ptolemaida, Vevi and (near Florina). The EO3 overlaps with the EO30 from Neo Monastiri to Farsala, and with the EO2 from Vevi to Agios Athanasios. The exact alignment of the EO3 between Mavrodendri and also varies due to lignite mining in the area.

The EO3 forms part of the European route E962 from Elefsina to Thebes, and the E65 from Lamia to Kozani as well as the short segment from the northern end of the A27 motorway to the Greece–North Macedonia border. The EO3 from Lamia and Kozani will no longer be part of the E65 when the A3 motorway is connected to the A2 motorway (Egnatia Odos).

==History==

Ministerial Decision G25871 of 9 July 1963 created the current EO3 from all or part of the following short-lived national roads (listed from south to north), which existed by royal decree from 1955 to 1963:

* The old EO1 from Elefsina to Larissa
* The old EO30 from Larissa to Kozani
* The old EO31 from Kozani to Vevi
* The old EO36 from Vevi to , near Florina (shared with the current EO2)
* The old EO37 from Agios Athanasios to the Greece–North Macedonia border at Niki

Until 1975, the EO3 formed part of the old European route E92 from Lamia to Kozani, the old E90 from Kozani to Vevi, and the old E20 from Vevi to Agios Athanasios.

<text>The NS-23 was a aircraft cannon designed by A. E. Nudelman, A. Suranov, G. Zhirnykh, V. Nemenov, S. Lunin, and M. Bundin during World War II as a replacement for the Volkov-Yartsev VYa-23 cannon. It entered service in 1944. The NS-23 round was derived from the 14.5×114mm anti-tank round by necking it out to 23 mm.

A synchronized version, designated NS-23S (for &quot;synchronized&quot;), was used for fixed installations firing through the propeller arc.

Applications of the NS-23 included the Antonov An-2, Ilyushin Il-10, Ilyushin Il-22, Lavochkin La-9, La-15, MiG-9, Yak-9UT, Yak-15, Yak-17, Yak-23, and Tu-4. Some early MiG-15s were also equipped with the NS-23.

The NS-23 was replaced in service by the Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 around 1949.

<text>The DAMA/NaI experiment investigated the presence of dark matter particles in the galactic halo by exploiting the model-independent annual modulation signature. Based on the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun and the solar system&#x27;s speed with respect to the center of the galaxy (which on short time scales can be considered constant), the Earth should be exposed to a higher flux of dark matter particles around June 1, when its orbital speed is added to the one of the solar system with respect to the galaxy and to a smaller one around December 2, when the two velocities are subtracted. The annual modulation signature is distinctive since the effect induced by dark matter particles must simultaneously satisfy many requirements.

==Description==
The experimental set-up was located deep underground in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy.

The experimental set-up was made by nine 9.70 kg low-radioactivity scintillating thallium-doped sodium iodide crystals [NaI(Tl)]. Each crystal was faced by two low-background photomultipliers through 10 cm light guides. The detectors were installed inside a sealed copper box flushed with highly pure nitrogen in order to insulate the detectors from air that contains trace amounts of radon, a radioactive gas. To reduce radiation from radon daughters and other environmental effects, the copper box is enclosed inside a multi-component, multi-ton passive shield made of copper, lead, polyethylene/paraffin, and cadmium foil. A plexiglass box encloses the whole shield and is also kept in a highly pure nitrogen atmosphere. A concrete neutron moderator 1 m thick largely surrounds the set-up. The experiment followed the proposal of Pierluigi Belli (then a Ph.D. student, now a research director of the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics), which his research group then followed up on.

==Results==
The DAMA/NaI set-up observed the annual modulation signature over 7 annual cycles (1995–2002). The presence of a model independent positive evidence in the data of DAMA/NaI was first reported by the DAMA collaboration in fall 1997 and published beginning of 1998. The final paper with the full results was published in 2003 after the end of experiment in July 2002. Various corollary investigations are continuing and have also been published.

The model-independent evidence is compatible with a wide set of scenarios regarding the nature of the dark matter candidate and related astrophysical, nuclear and particle physics, for example: neutralinos, inelastic dark matter, self-interacting dark matter, and heavy 4th generation neutrinos.

A careful quantitative investigation of possible sources of systematic and side reactions has been regularly carried out and published at the time of each data release. No systematic effect or side reaction able to account for the observed modulation amplitude and to simultaneously satisfy all the requirements of the signature has been found.

The experiment has also obtained and published many results on other processes and approaches.

==Skepticism==
Negative results from the XENON Dark Matter Search Experiment seem to contradict DAMA/Nal&#x27;s results.

The COSINE-100 collaboration has been working in Korea towards confirming or refuting the DAMA-signal. They are using a similar experimental setup to DAMA (NaI(Tl)-crystals). They published their results in December 2018 in the journal Nature; their conclusion was that their &quot;result rules out WIMP–nucleon interactions as the cause of the annual modulation observed by the DAMA collaboration&quot;.

A possible explanation of the reported modulation was pointed out as originating from the data analysis procedure. A yearly subtraction of the constant component can give rise to a sawtooth residual in the presence of a slower time dependence. New support for this hypothesis came in August 2022 when COSINE-100 applied an analysis method similar to one used by DAMA/LIBRA and found a similar annual modulation suggesting the signal could be just a statistical artifact.

In May 2021, the ANAIS dark matter direct detection experiment, after acquiring data for 3 years at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory in Spain, has not seen evidence for annual modulation in 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) crystals and is thus incompatible with DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA and in November new results from COSINE-100 experiment after 1.7 years of data collection also failed to replicate the signal of DAMA.

==Follow-up==
DAMA/NaI has been replaced by the new generation experiment, DAMA/LIBRA. These experiments are carried out by Italian and Chinese researchers.

<text>A concourse is a place where pathways or roads meet, such as in a hotel, a convention center, a railway station, an airport terminal, a hall, or other space.

The term is not limited to places where there are literally pathways or roadways or train tracks joining. An alternate meaning now is &quot;an open space or hall (as in a railway terminal) where crowds gather.&quot; In this meaning as a place where crowds gather, while many persons in any crowd no doubt have followed different paths in their lives to get to the place, there need not be notable specific roadways leading to the place.

==Examples==
Examples of concourses include:
*Airport terminals
*Conference centres
*Hotels
*Meeting halls
*Railway stations
*Shopping malls or portions of shopping malls which are often called &quot;shopping concourses&quot;
*Sports arenas and stadiums
*Universities

==Gallery==
===Outdoor concourses===
===Public transport concourses===
===Car park concourses===
==Contemporary usage==
More recently, &quot;concourse&quot; is often used to refer to a situation where people come together in online presence, even if they do not physically come together in reality. An example of such an online community is the IEEE Student Concourse, as well as various online shopping concourses.

<text>Philip Lionel Corner (b. The Bronx, New York, April 10, 1933; name sometimes given as Phil Corner) is an American composer, trombonist, alphornist, vocalist, pianist, music theorist, music educator, and visual artist.

==Biography==
After The High School of Music &amp; Art in New York City, Philip Corner received his BA (1955) at CCNY, where his most important teacher was Fritz Jahoda; and an MA (1959) from Columbia University where his composition teachers were Otto Luening and Henry Cowell, The two years in between (1955–57) were spent in Paris at the Conservatoire Nat&#x27;l de Musique, following the class &quot;Philosophie Musicale&quot; of Olivier Messiaen. Equally important was his friendship with the Canadian painter Paul-Emile Borduas, who introduced him to &quot;la grande aventure nord-américaine&quot;, to which he returned and became part of the group around John Cage. At the same time he resumed his studies of the piano with Dorothy Taubman, which was to have a significant role in his compositional as well as performing life. He taught Modern Music at the New School for Social Research from 1967–1970, inheriting the class founded by John Cage at double remove after Richard Maxfield, with whom he was teaching assistant, and Malcolm Goldstein. His teaching career started at a New York City high school and continued at the New Lincoln School where he helped develop the music department and introduced innovative courses (1966–1972). During this period he was married to the astrologer and trance medium Julie Winter who was also a minister in the Church of Religious Science, with which he too was associated, composing music to be sung at meditation sessions. From 1972 to 1992 he continued as professor at the newly established Livingston College, a part of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, soon to be absorbed into the Mason Gross School of the Arts. He then took early retirement and moved to Reggio Emilia, Italy where he had previous contact through the Pari e Dispari &quot;Arte Club Internazionale&quot;. An early friend, the dancer and choreographer Phoebe Neville, joined him there and became his wife and performance partner.

As an early participant in pre-Fluxus activities since 1961, he was a resident composer and musician with the Judson Dance Theatre from 1962 to 1964 and later with the Experimental Intermedia Foundation upon the invitation of Elaine Summers, for whose dance company he served as musician. He co-founded with Malcolm Goldstein and James Tenney the Tone Roads Chamber Ensemble in 1963 (active until 1970), with Julie Winter Sounds Out of Silent Spaces in 1972 (active until 1979) and with Barbara Benary and Daniel Goode, Gamelan Son of Lion in 1976 (still active).

==Works==
Corner became interested in calligraphy during military service in Korea in 1960–1961 and studied it with Ki-sung Kim; it is often incorporated into his scores. While there he became enamored with Korean traditional music, particularly the &quot;jeongak&quot; composition&quot; Sujecheon&quot;, which he describes as &quot;the most beautiful piece of music in the history of the world.&quot; Many of his scores are open-ended in that some elements are specified, but others are left partially or entirely to the discretion of the performers. Some employ standard notation, whereas others are graphic scores, text scores, etc. His music also frequently explores unintentional sound, chance activities, minimalism, and non-Western instruments and tuning systems. Improvisation is important, though not exclusive; some &quot;performance proposals&quot; lead to a kind of ecstatic semi-trance. Contact with artists in other media, especially dance and the visual arts, as well as a long-standing interest in Eastern religions such as Zen Buddhism and study of the music of composers from the Baroque and Pre-Baroque eras, has likewise impacted his music.

Representative works include the ensemble pieces &quot;Passionate Expanse of the Law&quot;, &quot;Sang-teh/Situations&quot; and &quot;Through the Mysterious Barricade&quot;, among many others. Also in his incredibly large oeuvre are piano pieces (&quot;perfect&quot;, &quot;Pictures of Pictures from Pictures of Pictures&quot;), choral works (&quot;Peace, be still&quot;), electronic music (the war cantata &quot;Oracle&quot;), and more than 400 works in the &quot;Gamelan&quot; series, to mention only some of his catalogue. He divides his output into five periods, each one reflective of his attitudes at the time:

#Culture, 1950s
#The World, 1960s and 1970s
#Mind, 1970s and 1980s
#Body, 1980s and 1990s
#Spirit; Soul, 1999–present

Frog Peak Music, a Composer&#x27;s Collective, has undertaken to make as much as possible of his opera omnia available by on-order photocopy publication.

In 1962, Corner&#x27;s &quot;Piano Activities&quot; became notorious by challenging the important status of the piano in post-war German homes in Wiesbaden, West Germany after concerts of antique musical instruments, the “Fluxus Internationale Festspiele Neuester Music” (Fluxus International Festival of Newest Music) was organized by the American artist George Maciunas at the Museum Wiesbaden to support a planned &quot;Fluxus&quot; publication. Fourteen concerts were performed on four weekends between 1 and 23 September. Corner&#x27;s work in particular attracted press and public reaction, later seen as marking the beginning of the Fluxus &quot;movement.&quot;

===Non-musical activities===
In addition to his work as a composer and musician, he has created numerous assemblages, calligraphy, collages, drawings, and paintings, many of which have been exhibited internationally. He has also written much poetry, which like some of his music, has occasionally appeared under his Korean pseudonym Gwan Pok, meaning &quot;Contemplating Waterfall&quot;.In the late 1960s Corner&#x27;s work was published in 0 to 9 magazine, an avant-garde journal which experimented with language and meaning-making. 
Editions in silk-screen have been brought out by the Archivio F. Conz, Verona, and Pari e Dispari Agency in Reggio Emilia, among others.
Works are regularly exhibited in galleries, mostly in Europe, and are in notable museum collections.
His principal gallery is UnimediaModern in Genova, whose director Caterina Gualco maintains a large collection. Other important collectors are Hermann Braun in Germany (deceased 2009) and Luigi Bonotto in Bassano who maintains an extensive documentation.

During &quot;Mississippi Freedom Summer 1964&quot; and for some of the following year, Corner was a civil rights volunteer and Freedom School teacher in Meridian, Miss. &quot;Mark Levy Collection. Queens College/CUNY Rosenthal Library Civil Rights Archive.&quot; In 1968, Corner signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

<doc id="1103416" wikidata="Q80319" url="?curid=1103416" title="Tales from the Punchbowl">
<text>Tales from the Punchbowl is the fourth studio album by the American rock band Primus, released on June 6, 1995. It was the band&#x27;s last album with Tim Alexander before he rejoined Primus seven years later, and again in September 2013. It was certified Gold on July 20, 1995.

==Enhanced CD reissue==
In 1996 the album was re-released as an Enhanced CD for Macintosh and Windows. As printed on the back inlay for this version, &quot;Combining high end production values, 3-D graphics, spectacular effects and loads of insanely cool stuff, the &#x27;Tales From The Punchbowl&#x27; Enhanced CD, played on a CD-ROM drive, sends the viewer through a surreal virtual experience that features the complete album in CD sound quality (which you can hear on a stereo CD player as well).&quot; Players must &quot;navigate from the helm of Captain Shiner&#x27;s ferryboat through an enchanted liquid atmosphere to many strange and mysterious islands. Many experiences are to be had, all in a rose-colored waterworld filled with visuals reminiscent of Dalí and Bosch.&quot; Printed on the actual CD is a ship helm instead of the large image of Captain Shiner&#x27;s face that appeared on the original, more common pressing.

The vinyl cover shows a picture of the band members dressed up as penguins standing on an iceberg. The same picture comes with the CD version, on the first page of the booklet at the front.

==Reception and awards==

In his review for AllMusic, Daniel Gioffre describes the album as &quot;unabashed prog rock ... which even the thick dollops of irony that the band seeks to impart to its compositions are unable to mask completely.&quot; He also says that &quot;the high-energy angular rhythms that Primus is known and loved for are as present as ever; they are just pulled off with greater zest and looser precision (if there is such a thing) than they have in the past&quot;, concluding that &quot;&quot;Tales From the Punchbowl&quot; is one of Primus&#x27; finer discs.&quot; Robert Christgau describes the album simply as &quot;modern teen horrors simplified—and funkified.&quot; Chuck Eddy of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B and said, &quot;Hearing Les Claypool thwap oppressive bass lines while rapping like a congested auctioneer isn&#x27;t nearly as entertaining as watching this trio fish for bass on MTV.&quot;

&quot;Tales from the Punchbowl&quot; was nearly as successful as &quot;Pork Soda&quot;, and peaked at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Primus&#x27; second-highest chart position. It is also the band&#x27;s last studio album to be certified gold by the RIAA.

<text>Triakel is a Swedish folk band. They mostly perform old Swedish folk songs, particularly those from the Jämtland area, but also include songs by contemporary folk artists.

Triakel was founded in 1995 by Emma Härdelin (Garmarna), Kjell-Erik Eriksson (Hoven Droven) and Janne Strömstedt (former Hoven Droven member); Eriksson and Strömstedt had to perform together using only the fiddle and harmonium on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1994 following a lost bet, and the performance was so successful that they decided to continue with the project. Härdelin, later on, joined the newly formed band as the singer, and the name &quot;Triakel&quot; (a kind of sweet, black liquorice in the Swedish dialect of Jämtland; the word is etymologically related to the English &quot;&quot;) was chosen after a long discussion.

<doc id="1103425" wikidata="Q16675609" url="?curid=1103425" title="Sant (religion)">
<text>A sant (; IAST: ; ) is a human being revered as a &quot;truth-exemplar&quot; for their abnormal level of &quot;self, truth, [and] reality&quot; in Indian religions, particularly Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism. In Sikhism it is used to describe a being who has attained spiritual enlightenment and divine knowledge and power through union with God.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Sant&quot; is sometimes translated as &quot;saint&quot;, but this is a false cognate (there is no etymological commonality) as &quot;sant&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit root &quot;sat&quot;, which can mean &quot;truth, reality, essence&quot;, while &quot;saint&quot; is derived from the Latin word , which means &quot;holy, sacred&quot;, derived from Indo-European root &quot;sak-&quot;, &quot;to sanctify&quot;.

Schomer and McLeod explain &quot;sant&quot; as preceptor of &quot;Sat&quot; or &quot;truth, reality&quot;, in the sense of &quot;&#x27;one who knows the truth&#x27; or &#x27;one who has experienced Ultimate Reality&#x27;, that is a person who has achieved a state of spiritual enlightenment or mystical self-realisation&quot;. William Pinch suggests the best translation of &quot;sant&quot; is &quot;truth-exemplar&quot;.

== Usage ==
&quot;Sant&quot; differs from &quot;saint&quot; not merely in the etymological sense but also in usage. The word is used in various contexts:
*In fifteenth- and sixteenth-century India under Islamic rule, it was used generally to describe teachers and poet-scholars who led worshippers and communities the praises of god or goddess within the Bhakti movement in Hinduism.
*In modern era, the term sometimes describes any holy man or woman who advocates a particular form of spirituality or members of the group that leads a &quot;Sant Mat&quot; (teachings of a spiritual congregation).
*The term is also used in a generic sense and in this respect is similar to the usage of &quot;saint&quot; to indicate a morally good person. As such, it has been applied to a wide range of gurus (not to be confused with Sikh gurus) and other religious leaders.

== Sikhism ==

*In Sikhism, a &quot;sant&quot;, &quot;brahmgiani&quot;, or &quot;bhagat&quot; is any human being that has attained God realization and spiritual communion with God. Sikhs believe that the divine energy of God can be experienced by humans on Earth. This is attained through continual recitation and spiritual internalization of God&#x27;s name (Naam Japo/&quot;Naam Simran&quot;). Sikhs commonly utilize reality as the name of God which cannot be simply uttered by the mouth but must be lived thru truthfullness. 
* &quot;Sants&quot; can originate from any religion. Figures such as Kabir, Ravidas, Namdev, Farid, Bhikkan and others are known as &quot;sants&quot; or &quot;bhagats&quot;, despite some being of Islam or Hindu faith. Divine knowledge is universal, and their knowledge after obtaining enlightenment through &quot;Naam Simran&quot; has been compiled and included in the holy book of Sikhism, the Sri Guru Granth Sahib.
* &quot;Sants&quot; are holy persons of very exalted status, one of being the ideal human being. As such, Sikhs are encouraged to seek the company and holy congregation of &quot;sants&quot; (Sadh-Sangat), learn from them, and attain &quot;santhood&quot; through intensive reading and contemplation of Sikh scripture (gurbani) and &quot;Naam Simran&quot;. 
* The virtuous life associated with a &quot;sant&quot; or a &quot;brahmgyani&quot; (one who has a perfect knowledge of God) is strenuously defined in Sikh gurbani, most notably in the &quot;Sukhmani Sahib&quot; passage of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Sikhism advocates for people of all faiths to realize and become one with God, and attaining union with God is the highest form of spiritual enlightenment. 

==Hinduism==

In Hinduism, a Sant has an important place in the life of a devotee. Hindu scriptures also tell the importance of a sant. According to the Hindu scriptures, worshipers are freed from the disease of birth and death by taking refuge in a true sant and doing devotion according to the scriptures. The identity of the true sant is also stated in the holy scriptures of Hinduism that one who is a true sant will have complete knowledge of all the holy books and will initiate three types of mantras (names) thrice.

<text>Jakob Amsler-Laffon (11 November 1823 – 3 January 1912) was a mathematician, physicist, engineer and the founder of his own factory. Amsler was born on the Stalden near the village of Schinznach in the district of Brugg, canton Aargau, and died in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. His father was Jakob Amsler-Amsler (1779–1869).

On graduating from school in 1843, he went to the University of Jena and then to the University of Königsberg to study theology. At Königsberg he changed courses, deciding to focus on mathematics and physics after meeting the inspiring Franz Neumann. Among Amsler&#x27;s fellow students at Königsberg were Gustav Robert Kirchhoff and Siegfried Heinrich Aronhold. Amsler gained his doctorate from Königsberg in 1848 and returned to Switzerland in the same year. In 1851 he became a Privatdozent at the University of Zürich and later in that year accepted a position as a mathematics teacher at the Gymnasium in Schaffhausen. In 1854 Amsler married Elise Laffon (1830–1899). The couple had two daughters and three sons. Their oldest son Alfred Amsler (1857–1940) was a mathematician and engineer in his own right and succeeded to his father as the owner and director of the factory. From about 1885 until about 1905, father and son closely cooperated on many projects in their business; many of their ideas, inventions and constructions of the time are difficult to attribute to either one of them.

Jakob Amsler-Laffon invented the polar planimeter in 1854.

<text>The Governor of Pitcairn is the representative of the British monarch in the Pitcairn Islands, the last remaining British Overseas Territory in the Pacific Ocean. Despite technically being under the authority of the colonial governor, Pitcairn has local autonomy.

Because of the dependency&#x27;s small population (it peaked at 233 in the 1930s, and has since dwindled to 35 in 2023), the British never considered it worthwhile to station a resident governor on Pitcairn. Instead, the Governor of Fiji doubled as governor of Pitcairn from 1898 onward. When Fiji became independent in 1970, the governorship of Pitcairn was transferred to the British high commissioner to New Zealand. The office is currently held by Iona Thomas.

Throughout the island&#x27;s history, the authority of the British governor was almost never used. An exception was Governor Richard Fell&#x27;s dismissal of Mayor Steve Christian, who was convicted in the Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004.

<doc id="1103446" wikidata="Q6778558" url="?curid=1103446" title="Marwan Muasher">
<text>Marwan al-Muasher () (born 1956) is a former Jordanian diplomat and politician who was Jordan&#x27;s foreign minister from 2002 to 2004 and its deputy prime minister during 2004 and 2005. He currently serves as vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he oversees research on the Middle East. He was Jordan&#x27;s first ambassador to Israel and former ambassador to the United States.

==Education and early career==
Muasher attended Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1977, a Master of Science degree in computer engineering in 1978, and a PhD, also in computer engineering, in 1981.

Muasher began his career working as a journalist for the &quot;Jordan Times&quot;, the only Jordanian newspaper in the English language. He then entered government service, working in communications in the Ministry of Planning, at the prime minister&#x27;s office as press adviser, and as director of the Jordan Information Bureau in Washington, D.C.

==Career==
===Jordanian politics===
In 1995, following the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, Muasher became Jordan&#x27;s first ambassador to Israel. Then, in 1996, he became minister of information and the government spokesperson. From 1997 to 2002, he served in Washington, D.C., again as ambassador to the United States, and helped negotiate the Jordan–U.S. Free Trade Agreement, the first free-trade agreement the United States signed with an Arab country.

He returned to Jordan in January 2002 to serve as foreign minister, where he played a central role in developing the Arab Peace Initiative and the Middle East roadmap. He served until October 2004, when he gained the post of deputy prime minister in a cabinet reshuffle under former Prime Minister Adnan Badran that sought to continue reform and shrink the bureaucracy. He served as the deputy prime minister until November 2005. In 2005 he developed the National Agenda, a long-term political, economic and social reform plan for Jordan. The making up of the plan involved 450 Jordanian stakeholders and experts giving solutions and deadlines to implement them. The National Agenda was never actually realized because, according to Muasher, it was thwarted by a group of political elites and bureaucrats, eager to keep a rentier-based state system, rather than one based on merit. According to Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi, al-Muasher, a Christian, was dropped from the post to please the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood.

<text>Philip Cunliffe-Lister, 1st Earl of Swinton (1 May 1884 – 27 July 1972), known as Philip Lloyd-Greame until 1924 and as The Viscount Swinton between 1935 and 1955, was a prominent British Conservative politician from the 1920s until the 1950s. He was notable through the 1940s and 1950s as being firstly the Minister for Aviation, and then being on the steering committee for the Convention on International Civil Aviation. he retired from politics in 1955 and his status was raised to an earldom.

==Background and early life==
Beginning life as Philip Lloyd-Greame, he was the younger son of Lieutenant-Colonel Yarburgh George Lloyd-Greame (1840–1928) of Sewerby House, Bridlington, Yorkshire, by his wife Dora Letitia O&#x27;Brien, a daughter of the Right Reverend James Thomas O&#x27;Brien, Bishop of Ossory. His paternal grandfather was Yarburgh Gamaliel Lloyd, later Lloyd-Greame (1813–1890), who inherited Sewerby House by the will of his maternal uncle Yarburgh Greame, later Yarburgh (1782–1856).

He was educated at Winchester College, an all-boys public school in Winchester. He studied law at University College, Oxford, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1905, then became an Honorary Fellow of his college and was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1908.

He joined the British Army in 1914, following the start of the First World War. He was mentioned in despatches and promoted to the rank of Major. In 1916, he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) while serving on the Western Front as a brigade major to the 124th Brigade of the 41st Division. During the war, Cunliffe-Lister spent time with Winston Churchill at his advanced HQ Lawrence Farm. They later worked together in the Stanley Baldwin ministries of the 1920s, when Cunliffe-Lister served as a minister of state. In 1917 he was appointed joint secretary to the Minister of National Service. He was noticed by David Lloyd George, who recruited the young man to be chairman of the Labour sub-committee of the war cabinet in Downing Street. At the end of the war, he stood as a Conservative candidate in the Coupon election of 1918.

==Political career==
He agreed to join the Coalition slate and was elected for Hendon. He would hold this seat until his elevation to the House of Lords in 1935. His strong intellect was immediately recognizable as a member of the National Expenditure select committee scrutinizing the controversial McKenna Duties and Homes Fit For Heroes, after which in 1920 he was knighted.

He achieved his first ministerial post as Additional Under-Secretary Foreign Affairs in 1920 and took charge of the Overseas Trade Department in 1921 as Additional Parliamentary Secretary. In 1922 he became a Privy Counsellor and was appointed President of the Board of Trade, an office he would hold with two breaks until 1931. This fast elevation to the Cabinet came about because of the collapse of the Lloyd George Coalition Government, which forced the new Prime Minister Bonar Law to promote many inexperienced MPs.

In 1923, Law was forced to resign due to failing health and there was discussion as to whether he would be succeeded by Stanley Baldwin or Lord Curzon. As the last survivor of Law&#x27;s Cabinet, Lloyd-Greame would later assert that it was Cabinet hostility to Curzon that prevented his appointment as Prime Minister, when he returned from the Imperial Economic Council. On 27 November 1924 Lloyd-Greame changed his surname to Cunliffe-Lister so as to be able to inherit property from his wife&#x27;s family. Raised to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in 1929.

In 1931 Cunliffe-Lister was one of the Conservatives chosen to negotiate with the Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald as the latter&#x27;s government collapsed and was replaced by the multi-party National Government. As a sign of his prominence within the party, Cunliffe-Lister was one of just four Conservatives in the emergency Cabinet of 10, serving for the third and final time as President of the Board of Trade.

The National Government won a massive election victory in the 1931 general election but was internally divided on the question of protective tariffs. So as to balance the Cabinet Cunliffe-Lister was replaced at the Board of Trade by the supposed Free Trader Walter Runciman, and instead became Secretary of State for the Colonies, which he would hold until June 1935. When MacDonald retired as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Stanley Baldwin a Cabinet reshuffle took place in which Cunliffe-Lister became Secretary of State for Air. At the 1935 general election he did not contest his seat and was instead ennobled as Viscount Swinton, retaining his ministerial office for the next three years into the premiership of Neville Chamberlain he took the strategic post of Secretary of State for Air responsible for Britain air defences in the lead up to war.

As Swinton was now in the House of Lords his hands were free to be Chairman of the UK Commercial Corporation responsible for boosting enterprise and output. So Chamberlain appointed the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Lord Winterton (an Irish peer who sat in the House of Commons) to speak for the Air Ministry in the Commons. This arrangement did not prove successful and in May 1938 there was a disastrous debate on air and it became clear to Chamberlain that the Secretary of State must sit in the House of Commons. Swinton was dismissed, his political career seemingly over.

After serving as Minister Resident in West Africa and being made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1943, during the Second World War Swinton&#x27;s career revived when he was appointed as the first Minister of Civil Aviation, a post he held until the end of the war. During 1944 he served on the executive committee and on the Steering Committee at the Convention on International Civil Aviation done in Chicago, formally representing the United Kingdom.

When Winston Churchill formed his peacetime government in 1951 he appointed Swinton as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for War Materials a year later. As Deputy Leader of the House of Lords Lord Swinton was also Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations for three years. When in 1955 Churchill retired, Swinton insisted on retiring too, and he was further ennobled as the Earl of Swinton. Towards the end of his life, Swinton was an Honorary Fellow of University College, Oxford.

==Family==
Philip Lloyd-Greame married Mary Constance &quot;Molly&quot; Boynton (died 1974) on 5 September 1912. She was the granddaughter of industrialist Samuel Cunliffe-Lister, 1st Baron Masham who had bought Swinton Park in 1882. In 1924, Philip and Molly Lloyd-Greame took the name of Cunliffe-Lister and moved to Swinton (sold in 1980 by the 2nd Earl and bought back 2000 by his nephew, Lord Masham and the latter&#x27;s family).

* John Yarburgh Cunliffe-Lister (1913–14 April 1943) 
* S/Ldr The Hon Philip Ingram Cunliffe-Lister DSO RAF (1918–1956)

Their elder son, John, was killed in the Second World War, leaving two sons of his own, of whom the elder grandson succeeded his grandfather as the 2nd Earl of Swinton, and was succeeded 2006 by his younger brother as the 3rd Earl of Swinton. The third Earl has two sons, both of whom are now married.

<text>The Line Mode Browser (also known as LMB, WWWLib, or just www) is the second web browser ever created.
The browser was the first demonstrated to be portable to several different operating systems.
Operated from a simple command-line interface, it could be widely used on many computers and computer terminals throughout the Internet.
The browser was developed starting in 1990, and then supported by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as an example and test application for the libwww library.

== History ==
One of the fundamental concepts of the &quot;World Wide Web&quot; projects at CERN was &quot;universal readership&quot;. In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee had already written the first browser, WorldWideWeb (later renamed to &quot;Nexus&quot;), but that program only worked on the proprietary software of NeXT computers, which were in limited use. Berners-Lee and his team could not port the WorldWideWeb application with its features—including the graphical WYSIWYG editor— to the more widely deployed X Window System, since they had no experience in programming it. The team recruited Nicola Pellow, a math student intern working at CERN, to write a &quot;passive browser&quot; so basic that it could run on most computers of that time.
The name &quot;Line Mode Browser&quot; refers to the fact that, to ensure compatibility with the earliest computer terminals such as Teletype machines, the program only displayed text, (no images) and had only line-by-line text input (no cursor positioning).

Development started in November 1990 and the browser was demonstrated in December 1990.

The development environment used resources from the PRIAM project, a French language acronym for &quot;PRojet Interdivisionnaire d&#x27;Assistance aux Microprocesseurs&quot;, a project to standardise microprocessor development across CERN.
The short development time produced software in a simplified dialect of the C programming language. The official standard ANSI C was not yet available on all platforms.
The Line Mode Browser was released to a limited audience on VAX, RS/6000 and Sun-4 computers in March 1991. Before the release of the first publicly available version, it was integrated into the CERN Program Library (CERNLIB), used mostly by the High-Energy Physics-community. The first beta of the browser was released on 8 April 1991. Berners-Lee announced the browser&#x27;s availability in August 1991 in the &quot;alt.hypertext&quot; newsgroup of Usenet.
Users could use the browser from anywhere in the Internet through the telnet protocol to the &quot;info.cern.ch&quot; machine (which was also the first web server).
The spreading news of the World Wide Web in 1991 increased interest in the project at CERN and other laboratories such as DESY in Germany, and elsewhere throughout the world.

The first stable version, 1.1, was released in January 1992. Since version 1.2l, released in October 1992, the browser has used the &quot;common code library&quot; (later called libwww). The main developer, Pellow, started working on the MacWWW project, and both browsers began to share some source code. In the &quot;May 1993 World Wide Web Newsletter&quot; Berners-Lee announced that the browser was released into the public domain to reduce the work on new clients. On 21 March 1995, with the release of version 3.0, CERN put the full responsibility for maintaining the Line Mode Browser on the W3C. The Line Mode Browser and the libwww library are closely tied together—the last independent release of a separate browser component was in 1995, and the browser became part of libwww.

The Agora World Wide Web email browser was based on the Line Mode Browser. The Line Mode Browser was very popular in the beginning of the web, since it was the only web browser available for all operating systems. Statistics from January 1994 show that Mosaic had quickly changed the web browser landscape and only 2% of all World Wide Web users browsed by Line Mode Browser. The new niche of text-only web browser was filled by Lynx, which made the Line Mode Browser largely irrelevant as a browser. One reason was that Lynx is much more flexible than the Line Mode Browser. It then became a test application for the libwww.

== Operating mode ==
The simplicity of the Line Mode Browser had several limitations.
The Line Mode Browser was designed to work on any operating system using what were called &quot;dumb&quot; terminals. The user interface had to be as simple as possible. The user began with a command-line interface specifying a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The requested web page was then printed line by line on the screen, like a teleprinter. Websites were displayed using the first versions of HTML. Formatting was achieved with capitalization, indentation, and new lines. Header elements were capitalized, centered and separated from the normal text by empty lines.

Navigation was not controlled by a pointing device such as a mouse or arrow keys, but by text commands typed into the program.
Numbers in brackets are displayed for each link; links are opened by typing the corresponding number into the program.
This led one journalist of the time to write: &quot;The Web is a way of finding information by typing numbers.&quot;
The page scrolled down when an empty command (carriage return) was entered, and scrolled up with the command &quot;codice_1&quot;. The command &quot;codice_2&quot; navigated backwards in history, and new pages were navigated with &quot;codice_3&quot; (for &quot;go to&quot;) and the URL.

The browser had no authoring functions, so pages could only be read and not edited. This was considered to be unfortunate by Robert Cailliau, one of the developers: 
== Features ==
The Line Mode Browser was designed to be able to be platform independent. There are official ports to Apollo/Domain, IBM RS6000, DECStation/ultrix, VAX/VMS, VAX/Ultrix, MS-DOS, Unix, Windows, Classic Mac OS, Linux, MVS, VM/CMS, FreeBSD, Solaris, and to macOS. The browser supports many protocols like File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Gopher, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), and Wide area information server (WAIS).

Other features included rlogin and telnet hyperlinks, Cyrillic support (added on 25 November 1994 in version 2.15), and ability to be set up as a proxy client. The browser could run as a background process and download files. The Line Mode Browser has had problems recognizing character entities, properly collapsing whitespace, and supporting tables and frames.

<doc id="1103453" wikidata="Q766150" url="?curid=1103453" title="Capsian">
<text>The Capsian was an Epipalaeolithic tradition in Algeria and Tunisia from ca. 9000 to 5400 cal BC. It is named after the town of Gafsa, Tunisia (Capsa in Latin).

The Capsian is traditionally divided into the Typical Capsian and the Upper Capsian, which are sometimes found in chronostratigraphic sequence. In terms of lithics, the differences between these divisions are both typological and technological.

During this period, the environment of the Maghreb was open savanna, much like modern East Africa, with Mediterranean forests at higher altitudes; where the initial phase overlaps with the African humid period. The Capsian diet included a wide variety of animals, ranging from aurochs and hartebeest to hares and snails; there is little evidence concerning plants eaten. During the succeeding Neolithic of Capsian Tradition, there is evidence from one site, for domesticated, probably imported, ovicaprids.

Given the Capsian culture&#x27;s timescale, widespread occurrence in the Sahara, and geographic association with modern speakers of the Afroasiatic languages, historical linguists have tentatively associated the industry with the Afroasiatic family&#x27;s earliest speakers on the continent.

Decorative art can be found at Capsian sites, including figurative and abstract rock art. Ochre is found on both tools and corpses. Ostrich eggshells were used to make beads and containers; seashells were used for necklaces. The Iberomaurusian practice of extracting the central incisors continued sporadically but became rarer.

Anatomically, Capsian populations were modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, traditionally classed into two variegate types: Proto-Mediterranean and Mechta-Afalou on the basis of cranial morphology and anthropological traits. Some have argued that they were associated with Mediterranean immigrants from the east such as the Natufians/Pre-Pottery Neolithic, whereas others argue for a population continuity based on physical skeletal characteristics and other criteria. In 1950, 3 skulls from the Upper Capsian of the Maghreb were measured, and based on indicators of the craniofacial form, considered to have been mixed in traits. The overall anthropological investigation highlighted that their dominant characteristics were conforming to a Mediterranean type, while the minority characteristics conformed to Mechta-Afalou (Iberomarusian) and &quot;Negroid&quot; type. It was suggested that this population was the product of Pre-Neolithic Mectha-Afalous, &quot;White&quot; immigrants from the east, and African migrants from the south.

The Eburran industry which dates between 13,000 and 9,000 BC in East Africa, was formerly known as the &quot;Kenya Capsian&quot; due to similarities in the stone blade shapes.

== Genetics ==
Recent genetic studies have further illuminated the origins and diversity of Capsian populations. A forthcoming study by researchers from Harvard University analyzed the DNA of nine late Stone Age individuals from Tunisia and Algeria (PRJEB83667). The findings suggest that the inhabitants of North Africa during this period were predominantly of local North African origin, resembling the Stone Age populations from Taforalt and Ifri N&#x27;Ammar in Morocco. This indicates a broad geographical and temporal distribution of a distinctive genetic component in the region.

Some of these genomes had contributions from European farmers (~7,000 BP) and Levantine groups (~6,800 BP). Moreover, one sample from Djebba, Tunisia, revealed European hunter-gatherer ancestry dating back to around ~8,000 BP, likely due to human migrations across the Sicilian Straits. Other samples from the Greater East of Morocco demonstrated minimal genetic contributions from European farmers or Eastern groups, reflecting a relatively isolated genetic profile compared to southern Europe and other parts of the Mediterranean.

In terms of paternal haplogroups, the study identified the following lineages among the analyzed individuals:

The majority belonged to Haplogroup E-M215
Two specimens carried the E-Z1902 lineage (a subclade of E-V65).
One sample belonged to the E-M78 haplogroup.
Two individuals were assigned to the  Haplogroup T-M184 on distinct branches.
Maternal haplogroups included:

Two individuals with U6a.
Two with U6d.
One with U6b.
Two with R.
One with U5b.
One with L3f1b-a.
These findings align with earlier genetic data from Taforalt and Ifri n&#x27;Amr Ou Moussa caves in Morocco. At Taforalt, all samples belonged to the E-M78* haplogroup, while samples from Ifri n&#x27;Amr Ou Moussa included E-L19 and a unique E-PF2545 subclade within the E-M81 lineage.
