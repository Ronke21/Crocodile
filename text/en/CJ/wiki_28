<text>Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa (born 17 November 1952) is a South African businessman and politician serving as the 5th and current President of South Africa since 2018. A former anti-apartheid activist and trade union leader, Ramaphosa is also the president (leader) of the African National Congress (ANC).

Ramaphosa rose to national prominence as secretary general of South Africa&#x27;s biggest and most powerful trade union, the National Union of Mineworkers. In 1991, he was elected ANC secretary general under ANC president Nelson Mandela and became the ANC&#x27;s chief negotiator during the negotiations that ended apartheid. He was elected chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly after the country&#x27;s first fully democratic elections in 1994 and some observers believed that he was Mandela&#x27;s preferred successor. However, Ramaphosa resigned from politics in 1996 and became well known as a businessman, including as an owner of McDonald&#x27;s South Africa, chair of the board for MTN, member of the board for Lonmin, and founder of the Shanduka Group.

Ramaphosa returned to politics in December 2012 at the ANC&#x27;s 53rd National Conference and served as the deputy president of South Africa under President Jacob Zuma from 2014 to 2018. He was also chairman of the National Planning Commission. At the ANC&#x27;s 54th National Conference on 18 December 2017, he was elected president of the ANC. Two months later, the day after Zuma resigned on 14 February 2018, the National Assembly (NA) elected Ramaphosa as president of South Africa. He began his first full term as president in May 2019 following the ANC&#x27;s victory in the 2019 general election. While president, Ramaphosa served as chairperson of the African Union from 2020 to 2021 and led South Africa&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ramaphosa&#x27;s net worth was estimated at over R6.4 billion ($450 million) as of 2018. He has been criticised for his conduct and involvement in his business interests, including his harsh posture as a Lonmin director towards the Marikana miners&#x27; strike in the week ahead of the Marikana massacre.

On 19 December 2022, it was announced that the ANC&#x27;s 55th National Conference had elected Ramaphosa to a second term as president of the ANC. On 14 June 2024, the National Assembly of South Africa elected Ramaphosa to a second term as president of South Africa after the ANC lost its majority in the general election.

== Early life ==
Ramaphosa was born in Soweto, Johannesburg, on 17 November 1952, to Venda parents. He is the second of the three children to Erdmuth and retired policeman Samuel Ramaphosa. He attended Tshilidzi Primary School and Sekano Ntoane High School in Soweto. In 1971, he matriculated from Mphaphuli High School in Sibasa, Venda where he was elected head of the Student Christian Movement. He subsequently registered to study law at the University of the North (Turfloop) in Limpopo Province in 1972.

While at university, Ramaphosa became involved in student politics and joined the South African Students&#x27; Organisation (SASO) and the Black People&#x27;s Convention (BPC). This resulted in him being detained in solitary confinement for eleven months in 1974 under Section 6 of the Terrorism Act, 1967, for organising pro-Frelimo rallies. In 1976 he was detained again, following the unrest in Soweto, and held for six months at John Vorster Square under the Terrorism Act. After his release, he became a law clerk for a Johannesburg firm of attorneys and continued with his legal studies through correspondence with the University of South Africa (UNISA), where he obtained his Bachelor of Procurationis degree (B. Proc.) in 1981.

== Anti-apartheid and labour activism ==
After completing his legal qualifications and obtaining his degree, Ramaphosa joined the Council of Unions of South Africa (CUSA) as an advisor in the legal department. In 1982, CUSA requested that Ramaphosa start a union for mineworkers; this new union was launched in the same year and was named the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Ramaphosa was arrested in Lebowa, on the charge of organising or planning to take part in a meeting in Namakgale which had been banned by the local magistrate.

In August 1982, CUSA resolved to form the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), and in December Ramaphosa became its first secretary. Ramaphosa was the conference organiser in the preparations leading to the formation of the Congress of the South African Trade Union (COSATU). He delivered a keynote address at Cosatu&#x27;s launch rally in Durban in December 1985. In March 1986, he was part of COSATU&#x27;s delegation which met the African National Congress in Lusaka, Zambia.

Ramaphosa was elected as the first general secretary of the union, a position he held until he resigned in June 1991, following his election as secretary-general of the African National Congress (ANC). Under his leadership, union membership grew from 6,000 in 1982 to 300,000 in 1992, giving it control of nearly half of the total black workforce in the South African mining industry. As general secretary, he, James Motlatsi (president of NUM), and Elijah Barayi (vice-president of NUM) also led the mineworkers in one of the biggest strikes ever in South African history.

In December 1988, Ramaphosa and other prominent members of the Soweto community met Soweto&#x27;s mayor to discuss the rent boycott crisis.

In 1985, the NUM broke away from CUSA and helped to establish the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). When COSATU joined forces with the United Democratic Front (UDF) political movement against the National Party government of P. W. Botha, Ramaphosa took a leading role in what became known as the Mass Democratic Movement (MDM).

Ramaphosa has claimed that he is a committed socialist.

==Rise in the ANC (1990–1996)==
After the ANC was unbanned in early 1990, Ramaphosa became increasingly close with the organisation. In January 1990, he accompanied released ANC political prisoners to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia; and, later, that year, he served as chairman of the National Reception Committee, which coordinated arrangements for Nelson Mandela&#x27;s release from prison, including concomitant celebratory rallies. Ramaphosa was elected Secretary-General of the ANC at the party&#x27;s 48th National Conference in Durban in July 1991, and subsequently became head of the ANC&#x27;s delegation to the negotiations that ended apartheid. He was also a visiting professor of law at Stanford University in October 1991.

Following the first fully democratic elections in 1994, he became a Member of Parliament (MP) and was elected the chairperson of its Constitutional Assembly on 24 May 1994, a central role in Mandela&#x27;s Government of National Unity. He was also re-elected, unopposed, as ANC Secretary-General at the party&#x27;s 49th National Conference in December 1994. However, in 1996, he resigned from ANC office and from Parliament and announced his retreat from politics, reportedly because he was disappointed that Thabo Mbeki had been anointed Mandela&#x27;s successor.

==Business career (1996–2014)==
After he resigned from politics, Ramaphosa became a businessman, taking advantage of the conducive environment provided by the new Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policy. Among other positions, he was executive chairman of the Shanduka Group, a company he founded, which invested in mineral resources, energy, real estate, banking, insurance, and telecoms (SEACOM). By 2014, Shanduka was worth more than R20-billion, and the Ramaphosa family&#x27;s Tshivhase Trust was its majority shareholder. Ramaphosa was also a chairman of Bidvest, MTN, and from March 2007, Mondi, a leading international paper and packaging group. His other non-executive directorships included Macsteel Holdings, Alexander Forbes, SABMiller, Lonmin, Anglo American, and Standard Bank. In 2011, Ramaphosa paid for a 20-year master franchise agreement to run 145 McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in South Africa. He also belonged to the Coca-Cola Company International Advisory Board and the Unilever Africa Advisory Council.

Ramaphosa&#x27;s various shareholdings made him one of South Africa&#x27;s richest men. According to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, his estimated net worth of R2.22 billion made him the 13th richest person in South Africa in 2011, and that figure jumped to R3.1 billion in 2012. Both estimates, moreover, excluded his unlisted investments through Shanduka, including the McDonald&#x27;s franchise agreement and a coal-mining partnership with Glencore.

===Cattle farming===
During a visit to Uganda in 2004, Ramaphosa became interested in the Ankole breed of cattle. Because of inadequate disease control measures in Uganda, the South African government denied him permission to import any of the breed. Instead, Ramaphosa purchased 43 cows from Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni and shipped them to Kenya, where they were artificially inseminated; the embryos were then removed and shipped to South Africa, to be transferred to quarantined cows. As of August 2017, Ramaphosa had 100 Ankole breeding cows at his Ntaba Nyoni farm in Mpumalanga. That year, he co-wrote a book about the breed, &quot;Cattle of the Ages: Stories, and Portraits of the Ankole Cattle of Southern Africa&quot;.

===Public service===
His resignation from politics notwithstanding, Ramaphosa occasionally accepted positions in the public eye, both abroad and in South Africa. He became the first Vice Chairman of the Commonwealth Business Council, and, in 1998, the Chairman of South Africa&#x27;s BEE Commission. In 2000, he was appointed to the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning as an arms inspector, responsible for supervising the decommissioning of Irish Republican Army armaments in Northern Ireland. And, in April 2010, he was appointed by President Jacob Zuma to the National Planning Commission, where he served as deputy chairperson to Minister in the Presidency Trevor Manuel.

In the 2007–2008 Kenyan crisis, which followed the disputed re-election of President Mwai Kibaki in December 2007, Ramaphosa was unanimously chosen by Kofi Annan&#x27;s mediation team to be the chief mediator in charge of long-term talks. However, Kibaki&#x27;s government protested Ramaphosa&#x27;s involvement, saying that he had business links with Kibaki&#x27;s opponent Raila Odinga. According to Ramaphosa, Odinga had visited him in 2007, but he did not have any &quot;special interest&quot; that would lead him to favour one side or the other; however, he said that he could not be an effective mediator without &quot;the trust and confidence of all parties&quot; and that he did not wish to become an obstacle to the negotiations. He therefore withdrew from the talks on 4 February. However, he returned to a peacemaking role in 2014, when – in his capacity as Deputy Chairperson of the National Planning Commission – he served as the South African President&#x27;s Special Envoy to South Sudan during the South Sudanese civil war.

Ramaphosa also continued to accept nominations to the National Executive Committee of the ANC: at the 50th National Conference in 1997, he received the most votes of any candidate; and at the 51st National Conference in 2002, he received the second-most. Ahead of the 52nd National Conference in 2007, he denied persistent rumours that he intended to join the race to replace Mbeki as ANC president; that year, he ranked 30th on the list of most popular NEC candidates.

==ANC Deputy Presidency (2012–2017)==

Ramaphosa made his return to political leadership in 2012, ahead of the ANC&#x27;s 53rd National Conference, when he received nominations to become ANC Deputy President. On 20 May 2012, Derek Hanekom, an ANC MP, publicly encouraged Ramaphosa to run for the ANC presidency, saying, &quot;We need leaders of comrade Cyril&#x27;s calibre. I know Cyril is very good at business, but I really wish he would put all his money in a trust and step up for a higher and more senior position&quot;. Ramaphosa dismissed the resulting speculation, saying, &quot;You can&#x27;t read anything [into what Hanekom said]. He was joking&quot;.

Indeed, Ramaphosa did not confirm his intention to accept the deputy presidential nomination until 16 December, the day before the conference began. However, he received strong backing from incumbent President Jacob Zuma – a partnership viewed as a strategic attempt by Zuma to &quot;outsmart and punish&quot; Kgalema Motlanthe, who was challenging Zuma for the presidency but whose constituency was similar to Ramaphosa&#x27;s, given their shared union backgrounds and polished reputations. Ramaphosa elected ANC Deputy President in a resounding victory on 18 December: he received 3,018 votes, while Mathews Phosa received 470 votes and Tokyo Sexwale received 463 votes.

==Deputy Presidency of South Africa (2014–2018)==
After his reelection in the 2014 elections, President Zuma appointed Ramaphosa the Deputy President of South Africa on 25 May 2014; Ramaphosa was sworn into office by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng the following day.

After his election as ANC Deputy President, Ramaphosa had begun the process of resigning from various business positions, and in 2014 he concluded the process, as required by the Executive Ethics Code. This entailed his exit from Shanduka, from McDonald&#x27;s South Africa, from platinum producer Lonmin, and from all other companies which might give rise to a conflict of interest, particularly in industries regulated by the government. His other interests – including a share trading company, his livestock farms, his property interests, and a sports car company – were placed in a blind trust. Parliament&#x27;s 2014 Register of Members&#x27; Interests reflected over R76-million in company shares held by Ramaphosa (although that figure excluded shares held together with private individuals), as well as his ownership of 30 townhouses in Johannesburg and two apartments in Cape Town.

===Domestic role===
Alongside his duties as Deputy President, Ramaphosa was made Leader of Government Business in the National Assembly in terms of section 91(4) of the Constitution, a role which involved coordinating between Parliament and Zuma&#x27;s cabinet. On 3 June, Zuma also appointed him the Chairman of the National Planning Commission, with Jeff Radebe as his deputy. In addition, Ramaphosa was responsible for developing a proposal to implement a national minimum wage, leading consultation on the matter between Zuma&#x27;s administration and representatives of labour and business. The proposal was approved by cabinet in November 2017.

In July 2014, Ramaphosa called for unity in the country after Julius Malema argued that the Afrikaans portion of the national anthem should be scrapped. Ramaphosa said, &quot;We are about building a nation and we must extend a hand of friendship, a hand of continued reconciliation to those who feel that the national anthem does not represent them any longer, and it can happen on both sides&quot;. Late in Zuma&#x27;s term, Ramaphosa also began to address publicly the widespread allegations of corruption in Zuma&#x27;s administration.

===Foreign relations===
In 2018, Ramaphosa, in Zuma&#x27;s stead, led South Africa&#x27;s delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, to promote investment and business in South Africa. His other official trips abroad included a two-day working visit to Vietnam and Singapore, the objectives of which included consolidating trade relations, as well as the opportunity for South Africa to learn from the Singaporean economic model and the role it prescribed for state-owned enterprises. Ramaphosa also continued to serve as Zuma&#x27;s Special Envoy during the mediation in the South Sudanese conflict, and participated in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) mediation in neighbouring Lesotho.

==ANC Presidency (2017–present)==
===Election===
Ramaphosa stood for the ANC presidency in 2017, at the expiry of Zuma&#x27;s term. Although he received the NUM&#x27;s endorsement as early as September 2016, his campaign did not begin until April 2017. Under the banner #CR17 Siyavuma, Ramaphosa ran on anti-corruption platform, with an emphasis on economic policies conducive to industrialisation and investment. He was endorsed by Cosatu and the SACP; by the provincial leadership of the ANC&#x27;s Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, and Gauteng provinces; and by politicians including education minister Angie Motshekga, former finance minister Pravin Gordhan, Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini, and former KwaZulu-Natal Premier Senzo Mchunu.

Ramaphosa&#x27;s primary opponent was Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who had the endorsement of Zuma, her ex-husband. On 18 December 2017, he was elected the President of the ANC at the party&#x27;s 54th National Conference, defeating Dlamini-Zuma by 2,440 votes to 2,261.

===Renewal project===
In his first speech as ANC leader, Ramaphosa pledged to stamp out corruption in the party. He subsequently spearheaded what he said was a campaign to &quot;renew&quot; the ANC internally and to restore its integrity and public image. Among other things, this campaign entailed the implementation of the new step-aside rule to suspend ANC leaders accused of corruption. This, in turn, led to a confrontation with ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule, who, upon his suspension from the party in May 2021, attempted to retaliate by suspending Ramaphosa, accusing him of irregularities in the financing of the CR2017 campaign. Magashule&#x27;s attempt had no legal force because of his own suspension.

In December 2022, Ramaphosa was re-elected leader of the ANC, running against Zweli Mkhize, for a second five-year term. The next parliamentary general election which took place in 2024 saw the ANC lose its parliamentary majority. Despite this, Ramaphosa would secure a third term as president in June 2024 after the ANC secured a coalition with the Democratic Alliance (DA), the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the Patriotic Alliance (PA) parties. Ramaphosa received 283 votes to Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema’s 44 in the 400-member house.

==Presidency of South Africa (2018–present)==

Following President Jacob Zuma&#x27;s resignation in February 2018, Ramaphosa was elected unopposed as President of South Africa by the National Assembly on 15 February 2018. Ramaphosa took his oath of office in the presidential guesthouse, Tuynhuys, by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng.

Markets rallied strongly the day after Ramaphosa assumed the presidency with stocks rising and the rand reaching its firmest since early 2015. Government bonds also increased in strength.

On 16 February 2018, Ramaphosa gave his first State of the Nation Address as the president of South Africa, the first time in a democratic South Africa where the president delivered his State of the Nation Address without a deputy president. Ramaphosa emphasised the need to grow the economy of South Africa, increase tourism and youth employment, as well as reduce the size of the Cabinet. In this speech, Ramaphosa also focused on the importance of keeping Mandela&#x27;s legacy alive.

Ramaphosa&#x27;s speech was met with mostly positive reviews from opposition parties saying that his speech was positive and that it would bring about change, but that they would hold him accountable.

On 17 February 2018, Ramaphosa, as commander in chief of the South African National Defence Force, attended the Armed Forces Inter-Faith Service at the Mittah Seperepere Convention Centre in Kimberley and made his first public speech as the president of South Africa.

On 26 February 2018, Ramaphosa, who had inherited Jacob Zuma&#x27;s cabinet, reshuffled cabinet for the first time removing many of the cabinet members who had been controversial through the Zuma era and who had close links to the Gupta family. Ramaphosa also named the deputy president of the African National Congress and the Premier of Mpumalanga, David Mabuza, as the country&#x27;s Deputy President.

On 8 May 2019, the African National Congress led by President Ramaphosa won 57.50% of the vote in the 2019 South African general election. Ramaphosa was subsequently elected unopposed to his first full term as president by the National Assembly on 22 May 2019. As Ramaphosa had previously been elected as president to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of his predecessor, he is constitutionally eligible to serve two full terms.

At the 2020 AU summit, Ramaphosa expressed support for the African Continental Free Trade Area and described it as a major driver for reigniting industrialization and paving the way for Africa&#x27;s integration into the global market. Ramaphosa also stated that the free trade agreement will make Africa a player of considerable weight and scale in the global market as well.

At the 2020 AU Summit, Ramaphosa also expressed support for closing the gender gap and ending gender inequality.

His government responded to the 2021 South African unrest, the deadliest riots in South Africa since the apartheid era.

Ramaphosa was re-elected as president for a second term on 14 June 2024 with the support of the Democratic Alliance and other opposition parties after ANC failed to win an outright majority in the 2024 general elections. Ramaphosa was inaugurated and took his oath of office at the Union Buildings in Pretoria on 19 June 2024.

===Domestic policy===
Since Ramaphosa became president he has made land reform and the economy his main priorities, as well as dealing with the outbreak of listeriosis which has claimed the lives of over 100 since the start of 2018.

In February 2018, South Africa&#x27;s parliament voted 241–83 to begin amending the &quot;property clause&quot; in the constitution to allow the expropriation of land without compensation.

On 19 March 2018, Ramaphosa suspended Tom Moyane as the Commissioner of the South African Revenue Service after Moyane had refused to step down.

Under his leadership, the African National Congress has pushed for a constitutional amendment allowing the government to confiscate farms owned by White South Africans. He has said that the state having the power to seize property for no compensation will encourage economic growth. In a time when the Rand is at a two-year low, economists have been doubtful over the possibility of this policy being successful.

On 14 August 2018, Ramaphosa appointed Dr. Silas Ramaite as the Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) following the ruling by the Constitutional Court that Director Shaun Abrahams had been appointed unlawfully by the former president, Jacob Zuma.

South Africa made world headlines because of attacks against foreign nationals within the borders of the country, with many South Africans blaming foreign nationals for the country&#x27;s socio-economic issues.

On 10 June 2021, Ramaphosa announced that his government would raise the threshold for the amount of electricity that private companies could produce without a license – from 1 Megawatt to 100 Megawatts. The decision was taken in order to respond to the increasing challenges faced by the country during the ongoing energy crisis, and to give &quot;oomph,&quot; in Ramaphosa&#x27;s words, to South Africa&#x27;s economic recovery.

On 11 February 2022, Ramaphosa announced that his government will formalise the South African cannabis industry, seeking to grow both production and exports.

Ramaphosa launched the Youth Employment Service (YES) initiative as a means to employ one million youth and giving them more experience in the working field, with the South African Government even introducing the Employment Tax Incentive, which would reduce employer&#x27;s costs when hiring youth.

On 14 August 2018, President Ramaphosa addressed the launch of the Sanitation Appropriate For Education (SAFE) initiative in Pretoria to respond to the sanitary challenges facing the country&#x27;s poorest schools.

===Foreign policy===
Ramaphosa made his first international trip as President of South Africa to the Republic of Angola and met with President João Lourenço in his capacity as chairperson of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to talk about peace and defence. Ramaphosa made his first international trip as the president of South Africa on 2 March 2018 to the Republic of Angola and met with President João Lourenço as the chair of the SADC.

On 20 March 2018, Ramaphosa made a trip to Kigali, Rwanda, along with Foreign Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, and met with President Paul Kagame and spoke about restoring relations between South Africa and Rwanda, later participating as panelists on the African Continental Free Trade Area Business Forum (ACFTABF) ahead of the 10th African Union Extraordinary Summit. The following day, Ramaphosa signed the Kigali Declaration on the establishment of the ACFTABF at the 10th African Union Extraordinary Summit.

Ramaphosa hosted the 11th BRICS summit for 25–27 July 2018, at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg.

On 10 May 2021, Ramaphosa said that the ANC condemned &quot;in the strongest possible terms&quot; the potential evictions of Palestinian families from their homes in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem and the &quot;brutal attacks on Palestinian protesters&quot; at Al-Aqsa.
Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, launched on 24 February 2022, Ramaphosa did not condemn Russia or agree to any sanctions against Russia. A month later, he stated that maintaining neutrality was essential to his having been asked to mediate between the two countries&#x27; leadership. Ramaphosa blamed NATO&#x27;s proximity to Russian borders for the war: &quot;The war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders and officials over the years that its eastward expansion would lead to greater, not less, instability in the region.&quot; On 11 May 2023, the United States ambassador to South Africa alleged the country was supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia. Days later, Ramaphosa announced his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts have agreed that a delegation of African heads of state could visit Moscow and Kyiv to present a peace plan. &quot;Whether that will succeed or not is going to depend on the discussions that will be held,&quot; he said.

In November 2022, Ramaphosa became the first foreign head of state to make a formal state visit to the United Kingdom during the reign of King Charles III. He was made an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath by Charles.

On 16 May 2023, Ramaphosa announced that the leaders of African countries came up with a new initiative for peace in Ukraine. In June 2023, Ramaphosa led a delegation to Russia and Ukraine, which also included heads of state from Zambia, the Republic of Congo, Egypt, Uganda and Senegal. After a meeting with Ramaphosa in Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that peace talks with Russia would be possible only after Moscow withdraws its forces from the entire occupied territory. Ramaphosa visited the site of a mass grave in the town of Bucha, Ukraine and was in Kyiv during Russia&#x27;s missile attack on the city. Putin later admitted to Ramaphosa that he had ordered the bombing of Kyiv that day despite the presence of an African delegation in the city. He met Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg and told Putin that the war must end, but Putin rejected the delegation&#x27;s peace plan based on accepting Ukraine&#x27;s internationally recognized borders. 

In July 2023, Ramaphosa attended the 2023 Russia–Africa Summit in Saint Petersburg and met with Russian President Putin. Ramaphosa called for peace in Ukraine and expressed concern about the global food crisis and rising fertilizer prices.

Ramaphosa called for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war, stating &quot;as South Africans we can relate to what is happening to Palestinians&quot;. He condemned Israel&#x27;s blockade of the Gaza Strip and the &quot;collective punishment&quot; of Palestinians in Gaza. Ramaphosa described Israel as an &quot;oppressive regime&quot;.

In January 2024, he met with Hemedti, the leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), in their first meeting since the start of the Sudanese Civil War. He called for a ceasefire without reference to the humanitarian situation in the country. He has emerged to embrace civilian politicians and tour African capitals in a bid for international legitimacy, analysts said.

In January 2025, South African Defense Minister Angie Motshekga stated that the M23 offensive against South African positions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, resulting in the death of 13 South African peacekeepers, was only alleviated after President Ramaphosa told the Rwandan government that continued attacks would be interpreted by South Africa as a &quot;declaration of war&quot; by Rwanda. President Ramphosa later also wrote on X that the South African peacekeepers had been killed by the &quot;Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) militia.&quot;

=== Coronavirus response ===
Ramaphosa has been internationally praised for his response to the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa with the BBC commenting that, in this regard, &quot;Ramaphosa has emerged as a formidable leader — composed, compassionate, but seized by the urgency of the moment.&quot; In October 2020, Ramaphosa began a period of self-isolation after a guest at a dinner party he attended tested positive for coronavirus.

On 12 December 2021, Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele announced that Ramaphosa had tested positive for COVID-19, and deputy president, David Mabuza would take over &quot;all responsibilities&quot; for the following week.

== Political philanthropy ==
Ramaphosa publicly declared in South Africa on 24 May 2018 that he would be donating half of his salary (R3.6 million annually) to charity in honour of late former South African president Nelson Mandela. He said the gesture was aimed at encouraging the wealthy to dedicate some of their pay to help build the nation. The donation was set to be managed by the Nelson Mandela Foundation (NMF).

Ramaphosa is also the founder of the Cyril Ramaphosa Foundation.

== Controversies ==

=== Marikana massacre ===
The Marikana massacre, as referred to in the media, occurred when police broke up an occupation by striking Lonmin workers of a &quot;koppie&quot; (hilltop) near Nkaneng shack settlement in Marikana on 16 August 2012. As a result of the police shootings, 34 miners died and an additional 78 miners were injured causing anger and outcry against the police and South African government. Further controversy emerged after it was discovered that most of the victims were shot in the back and many victims were shot far from police lines. The violence on 16 August 2012 was the single most lethal use of force by South African security forces against civilians since the end of the apartheid era.

During the Marikana Commission, it also emerged that Lonmin management solicited Ramaphosa, a Lonmin shareholder and ANC heavyweight, to coordinate &quot;concomitant action&quot; against &quot;criminal&quot; protesters and therefore is seen by many as being responsible for the massacre.

Under the investigation of Farlam committee, Ramaphosa said that Lonmin lobbied government and the SAPS firstly to secure a massive police presence at Lonmin and secondly to characterise what was taking place as a criminal rather than an industrial relations event.

The Marikana Commission of Inquiry ultimately found that given the deaths that had already occurred, his intervention did not cause the increase in police on site, nor did he know the operation would take place on 16 August.

He was employed on the board of directors of Lonmin while taking an active stance when the Marikana Massacre took place on Lonmin&#x27;s Marikana premises. On 15 August 2012 he called for action against the Marikana miners&#x27; strike, which he called &quot;dastardly criminal&quot; conduct that needed &quot;concomitant action&quot; to be taken. He later admitted and regretted his involvement in the act and said that it could have been avoided if contingency plans had been made prior to the labour strike.

=== Alleged extramarital affairs ===
In August 2017, the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; published an article alleging that Ramaphosa had had several extramarital affairs, including with some women to whom he had given money. Ramaphosa denied the allegations, claiming that they were politically motivated aimed to derail his presidential campaign.

=== CR17 campaign funds ===
On 19 July 2019, the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, released a report in which she claimed that Ramaphosa had intentionally misled the Parliament of South Africa over the controversial Bosasa donations to his CR17 ANC presidential campaign. COPE Leader Mosiuoa Lekota called for Ramaphosa to be impeached while DA Leader Mmusi Maimane proposed the establishment of an ad hoc committee to effectively investigate these allegations. Ramaphosa briefed the nation on 21 July 2019 and described the report as &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; and called for a judicial review of Mkhwebane&#x27;s findings.

=== Conduct of business interests ===
Ramaphosa has been criticised for the conduct of his business interests, although he has never been indicted for illegal activity in any of these controversies. Controversial business dealings include his joint venture with Glencore and allegations of benefitting illegally from coal deals with Eskom which he has staunchly denied, during which Glencore was in the public spotlight for its tendentious business activities involving Tony Blair in the Middle East; his son, Andile Ramaphosa, has also been found to have accepted payments totalling R2 million from Bosasa, the security company implicated in corruption and state capture by the Zondo Commission.

=== Phala Phala robbery ===

On 9 February 2020, it is alleged about US$4 million in cash was stolen from Ramaphosa&#x27;s Phala Phala game farm in Limpopo, although the exact amount was disputed.

Ramaphosa later said the amount was $580,000. In 2022, he was accused of corruption, obstruction of justice, kidnapping and bribing the burglars into silence. After delivery of a report on the matter commissioned by Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, the parliament voted on 13 December 2022, 148 for and 214 against impeachment of the president.. On 11 October 2024, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) announced that it would not be prosecuteing Ramaphosa or any suspects involved in the case.

== Honours and awards ==

Ramaphosa received the Olof Palme Prize in Stockholm in October 1987. In 2009, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 2009, presented by Awards Council member Archbishop Desmond Tutu at a ceremony at St. George&#x27;s Cathedral, Cape Town. He has also frequently been listed as an influential individual: he was voted 34th in the 2004 list of Top 100 Great South Africans, and was included in the &quot;Time&quot; 100 in 2007 and 2019.

He has received honorary doctorates from, among others, the University of Natal, the University of Port Elizabeth, the University of Cape Town, the University of the North, the National University of Lesotho, National University of Ireland Galway, the University of Massachusetts Boston, and the University of Pennsylvania.

===State honours===
*: Medal of the Order of National Merit (Athir, 2024)
*: Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit (2019)
*: Collar of the Order of King Abdulaziz (2018)
*: Grand Cross of the National Order of the Lion (2021)
*: Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB, 2022)

==Personal life==
Ramaphosa was married from 1978 to 1989 to Hope Ramaphosa, with whom he has a son, and from 1991 to 1993 to the now deceased businesswoman Nomazizi Mtshotshisa. In 1996, he married Tshepo Motsepe, a medical doctor and the sister of South African mining billionaire Patrice Motsepe. He is thought to have five children.

He owns a luxury mansion at the foot of Lion&#x27;s Head in Cape Town, as well as 30 other properties. In 2018, Investing.com estimated his net worth at R6.4 billion ($450 million).

He is a polyglot, and is known for using a variety of South African languages when delivering his speeches.

<doc id="1089197" wikidata="Q941928" url="?curid=1089197" title="Wolf River (Fox River tributary)">
<text>The Wolf River is a long tributary of the Fox River in northeastern Wisconsin in the Great Lakes region of the United States. The river is one of the two National Scenic Rivers in Wisconsin, along with the St. Croix River. The scenic portion is long. The river and its parent the Fox River and associated lakes are known for their sturgeon which spawn every spring upstream on the lower river until blocked by the Shawano Dam. The river flows through mostly undeveloped forestland southerly from central Forest County in the north to Lake Poygan (west of Lake Winnebago) in the south. The lake is part of the Winnebago Pool of lakes fed by both the Fox and Wolf Rivers. The Fox-Wolf basin is usually considered to be a single unified basin and the rivers themselves may be referred to as the &quot;Fox-Wolf River system&quot;.

The river is known in the Menominee language as &quot;Mahwāēw-Sēpēw&quot;, &quot;wolf river&quot;.

==Course==

The Wolf River rises in the southern Headwaters Wilderness of the Nicolet unit of Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, with the northernmost fork stemming from the confluence of Wildcat Creek and Pine Creek at Pine Lake in west central Forest County. The river flows south through Langlade and Menominee counties, where whitewater rafting is well known. Menominee County is mostly within the boundaries of the federally recognized Menominee Indian Reservation. Next the Wolf River flows through Shawano County, where it collects the Red River, passes by the city of Shawano. It then flows through Waupaca and Outagamie counties and back into Waupaca County, where it collects the Embarrass River and the Little Wolf at the city of New London. The Wolf River then collects the Waupaca River, then flows through Partridge Lake. The river then flows through Winnebago County and into Lake Poygan and Lake Winneconne. It finally goes through the village of Winneconne to empties into Lake Butte des Morts on the Fox River.

==Hydrology==
Principal tributaries of the river include Wildcat Creek and Pine Creek (headwaters), Pine River, Rat River, Waupaca River, Little Wolf River, Embarrass River, Shioc River, Red River, Evergreen River, Lily River, and Hunting River.

The river drains into the Fox River at Lake Butte des Morts then via the Fox River into Lake Winnebago and then into lower Green Bay of Lake Michigan. Lake Michigan drains northerly via the Straits of Mackinac into Lake Huron then south and east through the Great Lakes waterways into the St. Lawrence River, which flows northeasterly into the Gulf of St. Lawrence on the Atlantic Ocean.

==Ecology==
Environmentalists were concerned about preserving the river when the Crandon mine was proposed near a tributary of the river. The Crandon Mine was purchased by the Sokaogon Mole Lake Chippewa Band tribe in 2003 to prevent development that would adversely affect the river. The campaign to stop the Crandon Mine on the Wisconsin&#x27;s Wolf River was the result of successful coalition-building efforts amongst Wisconsin&#x27;s indigenous groups, environmentalists, and rural citizens.

===Restoration of sturgeon spawning===
Two dams on the upper Wolf River block sturgeon from returning to their historic spawning grounds at Keshena Falls on the Menominee Reservation: the Shawano Dam 125 mi. upstream from Oshkosh, Wisconsin and Balsam Row Dam 5.5 miles above the Shawano Dam, both constructed in the late 1800s. The result was that for over 100 years no sturgeon (or other fish) spawned in the waters above the Shawano Dam. Starting in 2012, the WDNR in conjunction with the Menominee tribe, implemented a sturgeon capture and relocation program to populate the river above the dams with mature sturgeon. Eggs and young fish were also used to achieve a breeding population of sturgeon in Legend Lake, a 1304 acre lake in Menominee County. Sturgeon successfully spawned at the falls the following year. The tribe has proposed that fishways be constructed around both dams to allow spawning from populations in Lake Winnebago. However, due to concerns about aquatic invasive species and Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS), a deadly fish disease, the proposal has not yet been implemented, and the capture and relocation program has continued.

===Zebra Mussels===
Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are small, freshwater, bivalve shellfish native to the Caspian and Black Seas south of Russia and Ukraine. They can clog water intakes and pipes, encrust piers, boats and motors, and cut the feet of swimmers. Zebra mussels have been found in less than 5% of Wisconsin lakes predicted to be suitable for zebra mussels. However, they were detected in the Winnebago Pool including the Wolf River as early as 1999.

There are many different species of fish in the river. In 2016, the Wisconsin state record Quillback was caught in the Wolf River. It was long and weighed .
====Sturgeon====
The Winnebago system, including Wolf and Fox Rivers and associated lakes, is home to the largest population of Lake Sturgeon in the world.
The sturgeon which spawn annually in the springtime in the Wolf River and its parent, the Fox River, between approximately April 15 and May 5, as they swim upstream from Lake Winnebago. It is estimated that the extent of the Lake Sturgeon has dropped to about one-tenth of its population in the state since year 1800. This species, which has existed since the time of the dinosaurs (100 million years ago), has a viable naturally reproducing population, which are highly prized for the taste of their flesh, and also for their eggs. Female sturgeon deposit their eggs only about every four to six years, starting at 20 years old, up to their life span of 50 years. At this age, the sturgeon are five feet long. The fish spawn in the shallows of the Wolf river, as they swim upstream.

In order to protect the spawning locations of the sturgeon from poaching when the fish are the most vulnerable, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources formed a citizen sturgeon guard called &quot;Sturgeon For Tomorrow&quot; in the early 1990s. They volunteer to watch over the spawning sites during the spawning season.

====Walleye====
The walleye is very popular during their spawning period, during the spring. Many fishermen set out to catch their daily limit. The walleye is probably the most prized fish on the river.

====White bass====
The white bass or sand bass (&quot;Morone chrysops&quot;) is a freshwater fish of the temperate bass family Moronidae that also spawns in the Wolf River. While different fishing methods and techniques are used, the most common is the river rig (also known as the Wolf River rig).

==Points of interest==
Two towns named for the river are on the river: Wolf River, Winnebago County and Wolf River, Langlade County.

<doc id="1089211" wikidata="Q6383900" url="?curid=1089211" title="Mr. Miyagi">
<text>Nariyoshi Miyagi, better known as Mr. Miyagi, is a fictional character and the overarching protagonist of Robert Mark Kamen&#x27;s &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; franchise, appearing in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984), &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; (1986), &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot; (1989), and &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; (1994). He was portrayed by Japanese-American actor Pat Morita . A wise, Okinawan-born karate master, he mentors Daniel LaRusso in the first three films (1984–1989) and Julie Pierce in the fourth film (1994).

The sequel series &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; (2018–2025), produced after Morita&#x27;s death in 2005, frequently references Miyagi through dialogue, archival images, archival footage, and briefly with a CG altered body double, and follows Daniel as he reopens Miyagi-Do as its sensei to continue his mentor&#x27;s teachings. The series also uncovers secrets in Mr. Miyagi&#x27;s past.

In addition to &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; films, the character has made appearances in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; animated television series and a Broadway musical. &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; is thematically structured around the concept of the &quot;Miyagi-Verse&quot;.

Morita was recognized for his role as Mr. Miyagi with nominations for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor at the 57th Academy Awards ceremony and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.

== Concept and creation ==

=== Writing ===
The character originated in a screenplay written for &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; by American screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen. In his youth, Kamen had experienced bullying at the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair in New York and subsequently turned to karate. He was trained in Okinawan Gōjū-ryū, a defensive style of karate by a sensei who spoke poor English. Kamen stated that Mr. Miyagi was named after Chōjun Miyagi, the founder of the Gōjū-ryū karate style, and that Fumio Demura was the inspiration for the character.

=== Casting ===
The original preferred choice for the role was Toshiro Mifune, who had appeared in the Akira Kurosawa films &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950), &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; (1958), but the actor did not speak English. Pat Morita later auditioned for the role, but was initially rejected for the part due to his close association with stand-up comedy, and with the character Arnold from &quot;Happy Days&quot;. Producer Jerry Weintraub in particular did not want Morita, as he saw him as a comedic actor. Morita eventually tested five times before Weintraub himself offered him the role, ultimately winning it because he grew a beard and patterned his accent after his uncle. After he was cast and although he had been using the name Pat for years, Weintraub suggested that he be billed with his given name to sound &quot;more ethnic&quot;.

== Characterization ==
In &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; films, Mr. Miyagi is portrayed as a strange old man who teaches Daniel LaRusso karate underlined by honor and discipline. Being a spiritual and non-violent man, he instills wisdom in his teachings. This makes him an outsider in comparison with the no mercy philosophy of Cobra Kai. Miyagi is eccentric, making his first appearance trying to catch flies with chopsticks, but has an impressive knowledge of karate. Over the course of his training, Mr. Miyagi becomes a father figure to Daniel. Macchio described Mr. Miyagi as &quot;that special human Yoda character that we all wish we had as we navigated our childhood&quot;.

Initially referred to only as Mr. Miyagi in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, the character&#x27;s backstory was explored in the sequel &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot;, particularly his upbringing in Okinawa. His name was given as Nariyoshi Miyagi, which later appeared on his tombstone in &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;. In &quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot;, his first name was inexplicably changed to Keisuke. When considering this continuity error, Jon Hurwitz explained that the &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; creators considered the second film to be more meaningful in relation to the character&#x27;s backstory but felt that his name could be Nariyoshi Keisuke Miyagi. In &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;, in the article about the assault and on his fake passport, Mr. Miyagi&#x27;s first name is given as Keisuke, causing confusion amongst Daniel and the others as they knew him by the first name of Nariyoshi while his birthdate is given as 1918 rather than 1925. It&#x27;s established that Keisuke was an alias that Mr. Miyagi began using after being forced on the run by the robbery and assault allegations.

&quot;The Karate Kid&quot; provides insight into the character&#x27;s difficult past during a scene where he drunkenly shows Daniel a photograph of his wife, who died in childbirth along with his son. Born on June 9, 1925, Mr. Miyagi left Okinawa at the age of 18 and emigrated to the United States after defying convention and unsuccessfully declaring his love for Yukie, a girl intended to marry his best friend Sato. He meets his future wife while working in the cane fields in Hawaii. At the onset of World War II, Miyagi and his wife move to Manzanar, a Japanese-American internment camp in California. During this time, he serves overseas in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team in the United States army, for which he receives the highest military award, a Medal of Honor, but loses his wife and son in childbirth. Weintraub wanted to cut the drunken scene, believing that it slowed down the film, but Avildsen and Kamen insisted on retaining it as they considered it to be the film&#x27;s emotional core. Kamen wanted the scene to remind American viewers about the Japanese-Americans who were moved to American internment camps during World War II and those that fought in the 442nd regiment who won more medals of honor than any other regiment. Morita particularly related to this aspect of his character&#x27;s backstory, having himself been placed in an internment camp in his youth.

In &quot;Cobra Kai&#x27;s&quot; final season, a darker aspect of Mr. Miyagi&#x27;s past is explored, revealing that he had fought in the Sekai Taikai tournament and won by killing his opponent. Daniel also learns that Mr. Miyagi was accused of stealing a valuable necklace and a violent assault. However, Lucille LaRusso reveals that the necklace had belonged to Mr. Miyagi&#x27;s mother and later his wife with one of the guards stealing it following Mrs. Miyagi&#x27;s death at Manzanar. Mr. Miyagi had only stolen it back and defended himself when attacked.

==Appearances==

===&quot;The Karate Kid&quot; (1984)===

Miyagi is working as a maintenance man at the South Seas apartment complex when Daniel LaRusso and his mother moved in. When Daniel throws away his bike after it is damaged in an ambush by Johnny Lawrence and other members of Cobra Kai, Miyagi repairs and returns it. He later rescues Daniel after he is beaten up by the same bullies. When Daniel realizes that Miyagi saved him, he asks to be taught karate. Miyagi initially declines, wanting instead to prevent the bullying entirely. A meeting with John Kreese – a former Special Forces veteran running the Cobra Kai dojo and the bullies&#x27; sensei – proves largely futile. Kreese consents to a cessation of hostilities until the time of The All-Valley Karate tournament, where Daniel and the Cobra Kai students will compete. Miyagi starts Daniel&#x27;s training with several seemingly non-karate-related house chores, albeit with specific rhythmic patterns: the first day of training sees Daniel waxing Miyagi&#x27;s various cars; on the second, he sands the wooden floors of Miyagi&#x27;s house; on the third, he paints a fence with vertical strokes; on the fourth, he paints Miyagi&#x27;s house with horizontal strokes. Not understanding his mentor&#x27;s methods, Daniel gets upset and threatens to leave, but Miyagi shows him that the chores were training Daniel to block attacks through muscle memory. One night, Daniel finds Miyagi drunkenly lamenting the death of his wife and newborn son during childbirth at Manzanar while he was serving in Europe during World War II. Miyagi accompanies Daniel to the All-Valley tournament, where Daniel goes on to win in the finals.

===&quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; (1986)===

After the All-Valley tournament, Mr. Miyagi tells Daniel it is time to meet his mother and Ali for dinner. They are distracted by Kreese attacking Johnny Lawrence and Miyagi asks him to end the fight. When Kreese refuses and turns his anger towards Miyagi, who &quot;honks&quot; his nose and subdues him. After Daniel&#x27;s senior prom ends in disaster, Miyagi invites him to stay with him. A letter arrives informing Miyagi that his father, who lives in Okinawa, is dying. Mr. Miyagi makes plans to visit, and Daniel decides to join him. Miyagi recounts his unfortunate history with Sato and Yukie. Upon arriving, they are greeted by Sato&#x27;s nephew Chozen, who drives Miyagi and Daniel to Sato. Sato tells Miyagi that they will fight to the death to restore Sato&#x27;s honor. At the village, Miyagi and Daniel are welcomed by Yukie and her niece, Kumiko. They explain that Sato owns the village&#x27;s land title and the villagers are forced to rent their property from him. Yukie reveals that she never married because of her love for Miyagi. Miyagi&#x27;s father requests an audience with both Sato and Miyagi and before dying, requests that they put aside their differences. Sato gives Miyagi three days to mourn before their fight. Miyagi shows Daniel the secret to his family&#x27;s karate: a handheld drum that twists back and forth, illustrating a block-and-defense karate move called the &quot;drum technique&quot;. After Chozen and his crew vandalize Miyagi&#x27;s family property and attack Daniel, Miyagi decides to return to California. Sato shows up with bulldozers, threatening to destroy the village if Miyagi flees again. Miyagi gives in on the condition that Sato signs the land title over to the villagers and Sato agrees. On the day before their fight, a typhoon strikes the village, leaving Sato trapped under the ruins of a dojo. Miyagi rescues Sato and they hide in a nearby pillbox with Chozen and other villagers. Daniel rushes into the storm after seeing Yuna stuck on top of a bell tower; Sato demands that his nephew help Daniel, but Chozen refuses. Sato assists Daniel himself, after which he disowns Chozen, who runs out into the storm. The next morning, the bulldozers return to help rebuild the village while Sato hands over the village&#x27;s land title and asks forgiveness from Miyagi. Chozen takes Kumiko hostage and challenges Daniel to a fight to the death. Miyagi and others in the festival use handheld drums to motivate Daniel, inspiring him to subdue Chozen and they celebrate their victory.

===&quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot; (1989)===

Miyagi and Daniel return to California and discover that the South Seas apartment complex has been sold and is being slated for development, leaving Daniel homeless and Miyagi unemployed. Miyagi offers Daniel the choice to stay at his house. Daniel uses his college funding to help Miyagi open up a nursery shop for bonsai trees. John Kreese is attempting to resurrect Cobra Kai and get revenge on Daniel and Miyagi with the help of his friend Terry Silver, who hires Mike Barnes, a vicious karate expert. Daniel chooses not to defend his title in the next competition but continues his training under Miyagi. Silver claims that Kreese has died and requests forgiveness for his behavior. Barnes attempts to goad Daniel into entering the tournament by picking a fight with him. Daniel and Miyagi later find that their bonsai trees have been stolen and replaced with an application for the tournament. Daniel and his new neighbor, Jessica Andrews, decide to sell a valuable bonsai tree that Miyagi had brought back from Okinawa. Barnes returns while Daniel and Jessica ascend uphill, holding them hostage until Daniel agrees to compete in the tournament. Barnes then snaps the tree in half. Daniel takes the broken bonsai tree to Miyagi. He performs triage on the bonsai while confessing that he sold his truck to obtain a new stock of trees and that he cannot train Daniel for the tournament. Daniel accepts training under Silver&#x27;s brutal conditions and ends up attacking a man at a nightclub by punching him and breaking his nose, after Silver bribed the man into instigating a fight with Daniel. Horrified at seeing what he has become, Daniel apologizes to Miyagi and Jessica. When Daniel decides not to compete after all, Silver unveils his true agenda: Barnes and Kreese appear and attack Daniel. Miyagi intervenes and defends Daniel, agreeing to train him once more. The two repair their friendship and replant the now-healed bonsai tree. At the tournament, Daniel defeats Barnes and shares a hug with Miyagi to celebrate his second tournament victory, while Silver and Kreese speculate that Cobra Kai is finished for good.

===&quot;The Next Karate Kid&quot; (1994)===

Miyagi travels to Arlington National Cemetery for a commendation for Japanese-Americans who fought in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team during World War II. While there he also meets Louisa Pierce, the widow of his commanding officer Jack Pierce, and they both listen to the opening speech given by Senator Daniel Inouye. When Louisa brings Miyagi to her home in Boston, he meets her granddaughter Julie Pierce. Julie has behavioral and anger problems stemming from both the loss of her parents in an automobile accident and frequent bullying at school by a school security fraternity called the Alpha Elite. Miyagi invites Louisa to stay in his house in Los Angeles to relax, and he himself stays in Boston to act as Julie&#x27;s caretaker. Julie&#x27;s issues cause friction at school and with Miyagi; he watches as she attempts to leave and narrowly misses being struck by a car by managing to jump into a tiger crouch onto the hood. Julie explains that she learned rudimentary karate from her father, Jack&#x27;s son; Jack had taught his son what he learned from Miyagi. After Julie is arrested during a two-week suspension from school, Miyagi uses the remainder of the time to take Julie to a Buddhist monastery. There, he teaches Julie the true ways of karate – balance, coordination, awareness, and respect for all life – and helps her overcome her anger issues. As Julie is preparing for her high school prom, Miyagi teaches her to dance and buys her a dress. While Julie attends the prom, Miyagi goes bowling with the Buddhist monks. Things go awry when Julie and her date, Eric McGowen, come under siege by Colonel Dugan and the Alpha Elite. Eric&#x27;s car is set on fire and Eric is saved by Julie and Miyagi. Miyagi challenges Colonel Dugan to a fight and easily defeats him.

===&quot;Cobra Kai&quot; (2018-2025)===

Although he does not physically appear in &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;, due to Morita&#x27;s death in 2005, Mr. Miyagi is frequently referenced, or appears in archival footage, such as newspaper clippings. Daniel is inspired to open Miyagi-Do in honor of his mentor and attempts to continue his teachings. He also regularly visits Mr. Miyagi&#x27;s grave. The fifth episode of the first season pays tribute to Morita by showing Daniel reconnecting with his mentor. In Part 1, &quot;Cobra Kai season 6&quot;, Daniel, Chozen, and Amanda learn that Mr. Miyagi had a secret past when they find a hidden box in his house. The objects in the box indicate that he was a boxer and a silent partner in a boxing gym. Amanda discovers a news clipping dated May 3, 1947, that details the beating and assault of Jim Watkins, who was from Lodi. In the article, Watkins accused Keisuke Miyagi of attacking him and stealing a valuable necklace. Daniel also discovers a bloodied headband from the Sekai Taikai. In Part 2 of &quot;Cobra Kai season 6&quot;, Daniel uncovers a Sekai Taikai record which reveals Miyagi&#x27;s fight in the competition against &quot;Claramunt&quot; ended in death. The results are authenticated by the current Sekai Taikai officials. Mr. Miyagi returns to the screen in a flashback in the episode &quot;Eunjangdo&quot;, recreated using artificial intelligence in the likeness of Morita. The younger version of the character is played by Brian Takahashi. In Part 3, Daniel has a dream of Mr. Miyagi and himself fighting off the same bullies from the original film, after which Mr. Miyagi reminds his pupil that Daniel had always been taught that winning or losing isn&#x27;t why Daniel fought. In the final episode, Daniel&#x27;s mother, Lucille, reveals the real story behind Mr. Miyagi&#x27;s secret. The man who Miyagi was accused of attacking actually attacked him after Miyagi confronted him for stealing a pearl necklace that had belong first to Miyagi&#x27;s mother and then his wife and was stolen following Mrs. Miyagi&#x27;s death at Manzanar. Some time before his passing, Miyagi gave the necklace to Lucille to hold onto for Sam when the time was right. Lucille gives the necklace to Sam as a graduation gift before Sam departs for Okinawa to visit her surrogate grandfather&#x27;s ancestral home. Daniel later has a flashback of Mr. Miyagi teaching him to catch a fly with chopsticks during one of their first lessons. Daniel tries to replicate the feat, only to have Johnny kill the fly first.

== In other media ==
In 1989, Mr. Miyagi appeared alongside Daniel LaRusso in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; animated television series, voiced by Robert Ito. The plot recounts their adventures around the world with a character named Taki. This incarnation was inexplicably given the name Yakuga. In 2004, Mr. Miyagi appeared alongside Daniel in a musical produced for Broadway titled &quot;It’s Karate, Kid! The Musical&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
Morita gained fame in the 1980s for his role as Mr. Miyagi. In 2015, Mr. Miyagi was inducted into the Fictitious Athlete Hall of Fame in the Contributor Category. Julian Roman of &quot;MovieWeb&quot; described Mr. Miyagi as an enduring symbol of &quot;strength, friendship and teaching&quot;.

For his role in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; Morita was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor at the 57th Academy Awards ceremony and a corresponding Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in any Motion Picture. 

Although Morita died in 2005, Macchio wrote in an imaginary 2022 letter to him that due to the &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; series, the &quot;legacy of your work and contribution to the world in your portrayal of Mr. Miyagi shines brighter than ever.&quot; Macchio also described &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; through the concept of the &quot;Miyagi-verse,&quot; which comprises &quot;anyone who knew Mr. Miyagi&quot;.

<text>Linvoy Stephen Primus MBE (born 14 September 1973) is an English former professional footballer who played as a defender.

Born in Forest Gate, England, to Caribbean-born parents, Primus began his professional career at Charlton Athletic, where he made four league appearances. Primus moved on a free transfer to Barnet and established himself as a first team regular in the lower divisions of English football before earning a £250,000 transfer to Reading.

A Bosman transfer to Portsmouth followed after three successful seasons at the Berkshire-based club. Initially, Primus struggled to break into the team and had his progress hindered by injuries. But the 2002–03 season signaled a change in direction as Primus broke into the first team and won Portsmouth fan&#x27;s player of the season as well as the PFA Fans&#x27; Player of the Year for his division. For the next three seasons Primus was in and out of the first team and worked under three managers: Harry Redknapp, Velimir Zajec and Alain Perrin. The 2006–07 season was the last injury-free season for Primus as a career-threatening knee injury meant he would not make an appearance the following season. Primus went out on loan to former club Charlton and made 10 appearances and one further appearance for Portsmouth before retiring through injury in December 2009. The Milton End stand at Fratton Park was renamed the &#x27;Linvoy Primus Community Stand&#x27; because of his outstanding services to the club.

Primus, who is married and has three children, is known for his Christian charity work. He is involved in the Christian charity &#x27;Faith &amp; Football&#x27; and walked the Great Wall of China to raise £100,000 for their cause. Other charitable causes he has been involved in are the Alpha course, a cinema advertisement about Christianity and the formation of a prayer group at Portsmouth. In 2007, he released his autobiography, titled &quot;Transformed&quot;, which details his conversion to Christianity.

==Early life==
Primus was born the first child of Newton and Pauline Primus in Forest Gate Hospital, Forest Gate, Greater London on 14 September 1973. His Jamaican-born mother worked as an orderly at Whipps Cross Hospital in nearby Leytonstone. Primus&#x27; father, who was born in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, worked for Thames Water as an engineer. His parents are practising Christians who took Linvoy to church and Sunday school when he was young. In his autobiography he wrote that church was &quot;a cold unwelcoming place&quot; for him as a child but that it &quot;instilled in [him] a very strong sense of right and wrong&quot;.

Primus attributed his desire to become a footballer from watching Ricky Villa&#x27;s winning goal for Tottenham Hotspur against Manchester City in the 1981 FA Cup Final Replay. He played his first game of football two years later in a match between two Cub Scout groups and, because of his performance, he was offered a trial with the Newham District Schools under-11&#x27;s by one of the Cub Scout leaders who was the manager of the Newham team. Primus was a striker or right winger at this time; in the team was future Portsmouth teammate Sol Campbell who played in midfield.

==Football career==
===Early career===
In Primus&#x27; early teenage years he played for his local Sunday league football club, Pretoria, based in Canning Town after being introduced by a school friend. Charlton Athletic arranged a friendly match with Pretoria and Primus was offered the chance to join the Charlton associate schoolboys which he took. For the last two years of his school life, Primus traveled to Greenwich twice a week to train with the team; in addition to this he played matches on a Sunday against the schoolboy teams of clubs such as Maidstone United and Dover Athletic. Primus initially struggled to cope; he cited the &quot;dog eat dog&quot; nature and the &quot;ambitious and aggressive&quot; parents as factors but nevertheless he decided to see it through later remarking that it was a &quot;very strong character building experience&quot;.

===Charlton Athletic===
After finishing his GCSEs, where he achieved three A grades, Primus signed a two-year apprenticeship with Charlton. He also received an offer from West Ham United, who were in a higher division, but he rejected this because he felt his first team opportunities would be greater at Charlton. Primus was playing in various positions until the club&#x27;s youth team coach, Colin Clarke, decided that he should play as a centre back, &quot;I see you as a centre back, that way you can see everything you want in front of you&quot;.

Under the Youth Training Scheme, Primus was earning £35 a week while training with the youth and reserve teams as well as having cleaning duties. He had to study Leisure Management at a nearby college which he disliked. Primus, along with Jermaine Darlington, was chosen to travel to Charlton&#x27;s temporary stadium Selhurst Park to lay out the kits and the boots for the senior players. He admitted this may have earned him &quot;Brownie points&quot; with the youth management. Primus began playing in the reserves under manager Alan Curbishley and, at the end of his apprenticeship, Primus was offered a one-year professional contract by the new youth team coach John Cartwright. Darlington was the only other apprentice who was offered a contract.

Due to injuries to first team centre backs Simon Webster and Darren Pitcher, Primus made his professional debut against Birmingham City. The match took place at their substitute stadium Upton Park in November 1992 and Primus was awarded man of the match for his performance. Primus played the next two matches against Leicester City and Brentford but was disappointed with his performances. Primus made two further first team appearances in the 1992–93 season but soon found himself lower in the pecking order after other players returned from injury and Primus got injured. He felt that he had to leave the club: &quot;I really felt as though I wasn&#x27;t wanted and that my days were numbered.&quot;

Despite this, he signed a one-year extension with the Greenwich-based club. However, he suffered another muscle injury, and with further competition for places in the form of Dean Chandler and Richard Rufus, he failed to make a single appearance for Charlton in the 1993–94 season. He was released at the end of it.

===Barnet===
Primus first rejected a trial with Crewe Alexandra before accepting one with Cardiff City. Just three days before his trial with Cardiff was set to begin Ray Clemence, the Barnet manager, offered Primus a two-year contract with the club. It was later revealed that Clemence was told by his assistant, Terry Harvey, that he should sign him immediately: &quot;Get in now and sign him, if he goes down to Cardiff and sees their stadium he will sign for them.&quot; Primus was determined to prove Charlton wrong and says he &quot;grew from a boy to a man&quot; at Barnet. This was also a time when depression was common for Primus, and he became addicted to alcohol and drugs such as ecstasy and LSD.

In the second game of the 1994–95 season against Leyton Orient, Primus made his debut as a substitute coming on for the injured Mark Newson. His next appearance for Barnet, against Scarborough, was described as the &quot;worst performance of [his] career&quot; in his autobiography. He went on to say that he was &quot;weighed down by the burden of expectation&quot; and heard someone say he was the &quot;worst player we&#x27;ve ever had at Barnet&quot;. He was often nervous before matches and recited the Lord&#x27;s Prayer as a way of coping with his anxiety. At the end of the season, Primus was runner-up in the voting for the Player of the Season and was man of the match on several occasions. Barnet had a poor start to the next season and they were at the bottom of the table in mid-September. After beating Northampton Town 2–0, Barnet went on an 11-game winning streak which ended at Colchester United despite Primus scoring a goal. He would go on to score five goals in the season; more than any other season in his career. Once again, he was runner-up in the Player of the Season award, this time to the goalkeeper Maik Taylor.

His third season for the club was an unsettled one. The club went through three different managers after the departure of Clemence: Terry Bullivant (twice), Terry Gibson and Alan Mullery. Nevertheless, Barnet narrowly avoided relegation to the Conference and Primus was awarded the Player of the Season and given the captaincy after a season which saw him make 46 league appearances. After Bullivant left for Reading, however, Primus became unsettled and said &quot;[I was] hankering after a move to join Terry [Bullivant] and Pards [Alan Pardew] at Reading&quot;.

===Reading===
Primus was signed for £500,000 at the start of the 1997–98 season although he found himself being sued by the Stellar Sports Agency after the £8,000 fee was not paid because of difficulties with Primus&#x27; agent. Joining him in Berkshire was Barnet teammate Lee Hodges. Primus partnered Keith McPherson in defence but Reading started the season poorly with just one point from the first six games despite Primus saying &quot;I played well from the word go&quot;. Due to an injury crisis, Reading lost their penultimate league match at Nottingham Forest and were relegated from Division One. This was Primus&#x27; first experience of relegation. Earlier in the season Primus had scored his first and what turned out be only Reading goal in the home match against Forest.

In the next season, Reading finished 10th and faced strong competition from new signing Elroy Kromheer, but Primus became disillusioned at the financial situation he was in. He was on £1,500 a week and commented &quot;[new signings were] on twice the wages I was being paid and I had seen the lifestyles they were enjoying&quot;. Primus was promised an improved contract, however no such contract was given to him over the summer. By popular demand, manager Tommy Burns was replaced by Alan Pardew. Fitness problems prevented Primus from getting much first team football at the start of the 1999–2000 season until a change of diet helped him regain stamina. As the season progressed, the club offered Primus a new contract which he dismissed as &quot;derisory&quot; saying the club was &quot;taking advantage of [his] good nature&quot;.

At the end of the season, Primus was free to leave under the Bosman ruling and received an offer from Luton Town which he accepted. Lennie Lawrence, the manager who bidded for Primus was sacked soon afterwards, however, and the deal was cancelled to the dismay of Primus who said he felt as if &quot;[his] whole world had collapsed&quot;. In the aftermath, Pardew put him in contact with Portsmouth manager Tony Pulis and a trial was agreed.

===Portsmouth===
After friendly matches with Dorchester Town and Exeter City, Primus signed a contract with Portsmouth although he was disappointed with the low wages in comparison to other players. He did not get his Portsmouth career off to a good start, scoring an own goal on his debut away at Sheffield United. Pulis was sacked early on in the 2000–01 season after a poor start and was replaced by fans&#x27; favourite Steve Claridge. Portsmouth were still near the relegation zone after a poor run of form that also saw Primus being sent off for the first time in his career for a foul on Fulham&#x27;s Louis Saha. Gilmore&#x27;s groin ruled him out of action for five months from November of that season, during which Claridge was replaced by Graham Rix, this was after Primus formed a partnership with Jamaican international Darren Moore. After a defeat to Crystal Palace (which Primus described as the &quot;lowest point of [his] career&quot;), Portsmouth needed a victory over Barnsley to stay in Division One and they duly won 3–0 with Huddersfield being relegated after their final day defeat. After the conclusion of the season, Primus fell out with Rix as he was unsure about whether Rix thought he had a future at the club.

The next season started with the death of goalkeeper Aaron Flahavan and the departure of Primus&#x27; close friend Moore to West Bromwich Albion. Primus struggled to get a game under Rix but the appointment of Harry Redknapp in March 2002 gave him a new lease of life and he ended that season with two league goals in games against Bradford City and Barnsley.

Despite originally being told by Redknapp he was not of Division One standard, let alone suitable for the Premier League, Primus proved his manager wrong by seizing his chance when other players missed out through injury and suspension. By the end of the 2002–03 season he had become a vital member of the side that won the Division One title, winning the Portsmouth fans&#x27; player of the season as well as the PFA accolade for Division One. He scored once that season for Portsmouth in the League Cup against Peterborough United. Primus credits his renaissance to his conversion to Christianity after a friend of his wife&#x27;s invited him to church.

Despite the previous season&#x27;s heroics, Primus was not used regularly in the early part of Portsmouth&#x27;s first Premier League season. Harry Redknapp had ditched his 3–5–2 formation in favour of the more conventional 4–4–2 and partnered new record signing Dejan Stefanović with Arjan de Zeeuw. During December, Portsmouth were in a terrible run of form and Redknapp decided to bring one of his most reliable players back into his plans for the derby match with Southampton. In spite of a 3–0 loss, Primus retained his starting place for the remainder of the season.

The following season saw Primus remain a regular member of the Portsmouth team under first Redknapp and then both his successors, Velimir Zajec and Alain Perrin. He scored his first Premier League goal at Crystal Palace on Boxing Day 2004. He scored again on Boxing Day in 2006, when grabbing two headed goals against West Ham United.

Although Primus was a regular member of Perrin&#x27;s team at the end of the 2004–05 season and captained the side on occasions during pre-season, he rarely featured until Perrin&#x27;s sacking in November. The return of Harry Redknapp, who had been won over by his performances and was now one of his biggest admirers, to Portsmouth lead to Primus&#x27; immediate return to the side, and he was ever present in the side that achieved Premiership survival in the last 10 games of the season. Primus remained a regular in the Portsmouth defence for the 2006–07 season, partnering England international Sol Campbell in the centre of defence, and Redknapp hailed him as the unofficial Player of the Season; the official winner of the award was David James. He failed to make an appearance in 2007–08 due to a career threatening knee injury. He was treated with surgery performed by Dr. Richard Steadman who is known to have saved the careers of many footballers, including Alan Shearer and Ronaldo. After the operation, Primus commented &quot;The difference between success and failure is what you do afterwards in your rehabilitation, not necessarily the actual operation.&quot; Despite his injury, he still managed to earn a new one-year deal at Portsmouth in May 2008.

===Charlton Athletic loan and Portsmouth return===
In August 2008, Primus returned to Charlton Athletic on a loan deal, however the deal almost collapsed as negotiations broke down between Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp and Charlton manager Alan Pardew. Pardew wanted the centre half for the whole of the 2008–09 season, but Redknapp was only happy to loan him out until Christmas of 2008 to gain match fitness, and it appeared the deal would be called off by Portsmouth. Finally Charlton agreed to the terms and Primus move to the Valley on a three-month loan days before the transfer window closed. He scored his first goal for Charlton in a 5–2 home defeat to Sheffield United. The result ultimately led to the sacking of manager Alan Pardew. He played 10 matches for the Championship (new name for Division One) club before returning to Portsmouth for the rest of the 2008–09 season. He was due to play in a crucial match against Derby County, however the match was postponed by Sky until after the expiration of his loan; Primus&#x27; loan had to be rearranged and a deal was agreed by both clubs for the loan to expire after the match against Derby.

After a near two-year absence, Primus made a comeback to the Portsmouth first team on 18 May 2009, the penultimate game of the 2008–09 season, as a late substitute appearance against Sunderland at Fratton Park. He received a standing ovation from the home crowd and was cheered each time he touched the ball.

Primus signed a one-year extension to his contract with Portsmouth in July 2009. Primus also agreed to take on an ambassadorial and advisory role to help guide emerging talent at Portsmouth, as well as a playing role. On 8 December 2009, Primus announced his retirement due to a knee injury. Portsmouth&#x27;s chief executive Peter Storrie confirmed that Primus would retain his ambassadorial role.

Following his testimonial on 31 July 2010, Portsmouth announced that the Milton End Stand at Fratton Park would be renamed the &#x27;Linvoy Primus Community Stand&#x27; because of his outstanding services to the club.

==Personal life==
At the age of 17, Primus met future wife Trish through a mutual friend. Much to the chagrin of Primus&#x27; parents, they decided to have a child after 18 months. The footballer said in his autobiography, &quot;Up until then I had been the model son and had brought no trouble to their door, but now they were upset at what they saw as my rebellion&quot;. In November 1993, their first son was born. Their daughter Atlanta, born in April 1997, plays for Southampton FC played in the FA Women&#x27;s Championship. She previously represented England at the youth level and played in the United States for California State University-Fullerton and Chelsea Women Primus and Trish married on 9 June 1999. Their third child, and second son, was born in 2002.

In 2007, he released his autobiography, &quot;Transformed&quot;, which was co-written by Peter Jeffs. It received generally positive reviews: &quot;Christianity Magazine&quot; said the book was a &quot;disarmingly honest account of Primus&#x27;s triumphs and struggles on and off the pitch&quot; while &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; described it as &quot;an antidote to the &#x27;me-me-me&#x27; tales that weigh down the shelves&quot;. Rival football magazine &quot;When Saturday Comes&quot; was more critical, pointing out its &quot;sometimes ungrammatical and often ponderous style&quot; and going on to say &quot;[the] book is also full of cliches&quot;.

==Charitable and Christian work==
Trish suffered from depression and was introduced to Christianity by stable owners, Keith and Sam, who invited the Primus family to join them at church on a Sunday. Initially, Primus was reluctant but Trish convinced him. Primus remarked that it was a case of &quot;well church is the last place we&#x27;d go, but why not?&quot; The church was more &quot;laid-back&quot; than the one that Primus attended as a child and he, with the rest of his family, became regular churchgoers in 2001. Trish&#x27;s depression was lifted and Primus converted to Christianity later that year. &quot;In my heart I felt whole and complete, and I wanted to read the Bible at every opportunity.&quot; According to his autobiography, Primus is able to speak in tongues.

Primus, with Darren Moore, former footballer Mick Mellows, and former Portsmouth player Joel Ward is involved with the Christian charity &#x27;Faith and Football, and walked the Great Wall of China in summer 2005 to raise £100,000 for Prospect Children&#x27;s School in Ibadan, Nigeria and a new medical centre, school and orphanage for a village in Goa.

He was also involved in supporting the Alpha course, which is run all over the world, and is designed to explain Christian beliefs and promote discussion. Primus appeared in a cinema advertisement for the movement, alongside the comedian Lennie Bennett. At his former club Portsmouth, he founded a prayer group which has included teammates such as Nwankwo Kanu, Sean Davis and Benjani. In December 2006, he took part in a &quot;Football Focus&quot; feature on faith in the game presented by fellow Christian footballer Gavin Peacock. On 16 April 2013, Primus played for Portsmouth in a charity match raising money for the Portsmouth supporters trust.

Primus was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to football and charity in Portsmouth.

<text>The Tegetthoff&quot; class(also called the Viribus Unitis&quot; class) was a class of four dreadnought battleships built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Named for Austrian Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, the class was composed of , , , and . Construction started on the ships shortly before World War I; &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; and &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; were both laid down in 1910, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; and &quot;Szent István&quot; followed in 1912. Three of the four warships were built in the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste; &quot;Szent István&quot; was built in the Ganz-Danubius shipyard in Fiume, so that both parts of the Dual Monarchy would participate in the construction of the ships. The &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class ships hold the distinction for being the first and only dreadnought battleships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy.
The SMS Szent István had a different more modern propulsion system than her sister ships.

&quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; and &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; were commissioned into the fleet in December 1912 and July 1913, respectively. &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; followed in July 1914. The smaller shipyards in Fiume resulted in a slower construction which was further delayed by the outbreak of the war, with &quot;Szent István&quot; commissioned into the fleet in December 1915. This was too late for her to take part in the Bombardment of Ancona in which the remaining ships in the class saw action immediately following Italy&#x27;s declaration of war on Austria-Hungary in May 1915.

All of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s were members of the 1st Battleship Division at the beginning of the war and were stationed out of the naval base at Pola. Following the Bombardment of Ancona and the commissioning of &quot;Szent István&quot;, the four ships saw little combat due to the Otranto Barrage which prohibited the Austro-Hungarian Navy from leaving the Adriatic Sea. In June 1918, in an attempt to earn safer passage for German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats through the Strait of Otranto, the Austro-Hungarian Navy attempted to break the Barrage with a major attack on the strait, but it was abandoned after &quot;Szent István&quot; was sunk by the Italian motor torpedo boat &quot;MAS-15&quot; on the morning of 10 June.

After the sinking of &quot;Szent István&quot;, the remaining three ships of the class returned to port in Pola where they remained for the rest of the war. When Austria-Hungary was facing defeat in the war in October 1918, the Austrian government decided to transfer &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; to the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in order to avoid having to hand the ship over to the Allied Powers. Renamed &quot;Jugoslavija&quot;, the ship was destroyed by an Italian mine in the Raid on Pola a day later. Following the Armistice of Villa Giusti in November 1918, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was ceded to France where she was sunk as a target ship in 1922, while &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; was handed over to Italy and scrapped between 1924 and 1925. The wreck of &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; was salvaged from Pola harbor and broken up between 1920 and 1930.

== Background ==

With the establishment of the Austrian Naval League in September 1904 and the October appointment of Vice-Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli to the posts of Commander-in-Chief of the Navy (German: &quot;Marinekommandant&quot;) and Chief of the Naval Section of the War Ministry (German: &quot;Chef der Marinesektion&quot;), the Austro-Hungarian Navy began an expansion program befitting a Great Power. Montecuccoli immediately pursued the efforts championed by his predecessor, Admiral Hermann von Spaun, and pushed for a greatly expanded and modernized navy.

Additional motivations existed which led to the development of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class beyond Montecuccoli&#x27;s own plans for the navy. New railroads had been constructed through Austria&#x27;s Alpine passes between 1906 and 1908, linking Trieste and the Dalmatian coastline to the rest of the Empire. Lower tariffs on the port of Trieste aided the expansion of the city and similar growth in Austria-Hungary&#x27;s merchant marine. These changes necessitated the development of a new line of battleships capable of more than the defense of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s coastline.

Prior to the turn of the century, sea power had not been a priority in Austrian foreign policy and the navy had little public interest or support. However, the appointment of Archduke Franz Ferdinand – heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne and a prominent and influential supporter of naval expansion – to the position of admiral in September 1902 greatly increased the importance of the navy in the eyes of both the general public and the Austrian and Hungarian Parliaments. Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s interest in naval affairs stemmed primarily from his belief that a strong navy would be necessary to compete with Italy, which he viewed as Austria-Hungary&#x27;s greatest regional threat.

The &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class battleships were authorized when Austria-Hungary was engaged in a naval arms race with its nominal ally, Italy. Italy&#x27;s &quot;Regia Marina&quot; was considered the most important naval power in the region, which Austria-Hungary measured itself against, often unfavorably. The disparity between the Austro-Hungarian and Italian navies had existed for decades; in the late 1880s Italy boasted the third-largest fleet in the world, behind the French Navy and the British Royal Navy. While that disparity had been somewhat equalized with the Imperial Russian Navy and German Imperial Navy surpassing the Italian Navy in 1893 and 1894 respectively, by 1903 the balance began to shift towards Italy&#x27;s favor with the Italians claiming 18 pre-dreadnoughts in commission or under construction compared to 6 Austro-Hungarian battleships.

Following the construction of the final two s in 1903, the Italian Navy elected to construct a series of large cruisers rather than additional battleships. Furthermore, a major scandal involving the Terni steelworks&#x27; armor contracts led to a government investigation that postponed several naval construction programs for three years. These delays meant that the Italian Navy would not initiate construction on another battleship until 1909, and provided the Austro-Hungarian Navy with an opportunity to address the disparity between the two fleets.

=== Austro-Italian naval arms race ===
As late as 1903 the Italian advantage in naval arms appeared so large that the difficulty of Austria-Hungary catching up to the Italian Navy, much less surpassing it, appeared insurmountable. Events changed, however, with the revolution in naval technology created by the launch of the British in 1906 and the Anglo-German naval arms race that followed. The value of pre-dreadnought battleships declined rapidly and numerous ships in European navies were rendered obsolete, giving Austria-Hungary an opportunity to make up for past neglect in naval affairs. With an improved financial situation and budget from the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, and with Archduke Ferdinand and Admiral Montecuccoli both supportive of constructing a new class of modern battleships, the stage was set for the development of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s first and only class of dreadnought battleships.

Shortly after assuming command as Chief of the Navy, Montecuccoli drafted his first proposal for a modern Austrian fleet in the spring of 1905. It was to consist of 12 battleships, 4 armored cruisers, 8 scout cruisers, 18 destroyers, 36 high seas torpedo craft, and 6 submarines. While these plans were ambitious, they lacked any ships the size of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class. Additional proposals came from outside the Naval Section of the War Ministry. The Slovenian politician and prominent Trialist Ivan Šusteršič presented a proposal to the &quot;Reichsrat&quot; in 1905 calling for the construction of nine additional battleships. The Austrian Naval League also presented its proposals for the construction of a series of dreadnoughts. Petitioning the Naval Section of the War Ministry in March 1909 to construct three dreadnoughts of , the League justified its proposal by arguing that a strong navy would be necessary to protect Austria-Hungary&#x27;s growing merchant marine, and that Italian naval spending was twice Austria-Hungary&#x27;s.

Following the construction of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s last class of pre-dreadnought battleships, the , Montecuccoli submitted his first proposal for true dreadnought battleships for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Taking advantage of political support for naval expansion he had obtained in both Austria and Hungary over the course of several years, and Austrian fears of a war with Italy over the Bosnian Crisis during the previous year, Montecuccoli drafted a new memorandum to Emperor Franz Joseph I in January 1909 proposing an enlarged Austro-Hungarian Navy consisting of 16 battleships, 12 cruisers, 24 destroyers, 72 seagoing torpedo boats, and 12 submarines. While this was a modified version of his 1905 plan, one notable change was the inclusion of four additional dreadnought battleships with a displacement of at load. These ships would become the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class.

=== Proposals ===

Following up on Montecuccoli&#x27;s memorandum, the Naval Section of the War Ministry submitted its specifications for the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class battleships to Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in October 1908, who in turn hired naval architect Siegfried Popper to produce a design. In December 1908, the Naval Section of the War Ministry also began a competition for the design of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class, with the aim of producing alternate designs aside from those Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino would present.

Emperor Franz Joseph I approved Montecuccoli&#x27;s plan in January 1909, who subsequently circulated it among the governments in Vienna and Budapest. In March, Popper presented five pre-project designs for the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class. These initial designs were effectively enlarged versions of the &quot;Radetzky&quot; class and lacked the triple turrets which would later be found on the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s. In April 1909, Popper returned with a new set of proposals, named &quot;Variant VIII&quot; which included triple turrets. That same month, Montecuccoli&#x27;s memorandum found its way into Italian newspapers, sparking hysteria among the Italian people and politicians. The Italian Navy used the report as justification for initiating a new dreadnought program. In June 1909 was laid down at the naval shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia.

== Funding ==
=== Budget crisis ===

The development of &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot; left the Austro-Hungarian Navy in a precarious position. The Italian battleship was laid down largely due to the leaking of Montecuccoli&#x27;s memorandum, while the proposal for constructing four new battleships still remained in the planning stages. Complicating the matter further was the collapse of Sándor Wekerle&#x27;s government in Budapest, which left the Hungarian Diet without a prime minister for nearly a year. With no government in Budapest to pass a budget, efforts to secure funding and begin construction had stalled.

The budget crisis likewise affected industries with close ties to the navy, particularly the Witkowitz Ironworks and the Škoda Works. With nearing completion and the only remaining Austro-Hungarian battleship still under construction in the shipyards of Trieste, the major shipbuilding enterprises in Austria offered to begin construction on three dreadnoughts at their own financial risk, in exchange for promises from the Austro-Hungarian government that the battleships would be purchased as soon as the budget impasse had been resolved. After negotiations involving the ministries of foreign affairs, war and finance, the navy agreed to the offer but lowered the number of dreadnoughts that would be constructed before a budget was passed from three to two. In his memoirs, former Austrian Field Marshal and Chief of the General Staff Conrad von Hötzendorf wrote that due to his belief in a future war with Italy, construction on the battleships should begin as soon as possible. He also worked to secure agreements to sell the dreadnoughts to, in his words, a &quot;reliable ally&quot; (which only Germany could claim to be) should the budget crisis fail to be resolved in short order.

Facing potential backlash over constitutional concerns that the construction of the first two battleships committed Austria-Hungary to spend roughly 120 million &quot;Kronen&quot; without prior approval by either the Austrian &quot;Reichsrat&quot; or the Diet of Hungary, the deal remained secret. In the event of the agreement being leaked to the press prior to the passage of a new naval budget, Montecuccoli drafted several explanations to justify the battleships&#x27; construction and the necessity to keep their existence a secret. These included the navy&#x27;s urgent need to counter Italy&#x27;s naval build up and desire to negotiate a lower price with their builders. By the time the agreement was leaked to the public in April 1910 by the &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot;, the newspaper of Austria&#x27;s Social Democratic Party, the plans had already been finalized and construction on the first two battleships, &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; and &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, was about to begin.

=== Costs ===
The costs to construct the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class battleships were enormous by the standards of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. While the , , and the &quot;Radetzky&quot;-class battleships cost the navy roughly 18, 26, and 40 million &quot;Kronen&quot; per ship, each ship of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class was projected to cost over 60 million &quot;Kronen&quot;. Under the previous budgets for 1907 and 1908, the navy had been allocated some 63.4 and 73.4 million &quot;Kronen&quot;, which at the time was considered an inflated budget due to the construction of two &quot;Radetzky&quot;s. Montecuccoli worried that the general public and the legislatures in Vienna and Budapest would reject the need for the expensive ships, especially so soon after the political crisis in Budapest. The dramatic increase in spending meant that in 1909 the navy spent some 100.4 million &quot;Kronen&quot;, a huge sum at the time. This was done in order to rush the completion of the &quot;Radetzky&quot;-class battleships, though the looming construction of four dreadnoughts meant the Austro-Hungarian Navy would likely have to ask the government for a yearly budget much higher than 100 million &quot;Kronen&quot;.

In order to guarantee funding for the ships from the Rothschild family in Austria, who owned the Witkowitz Ironworks, the Creditanstalt Bank, and had significant assets in both the Škoda Works and the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino, Archduke Franz Ferdinand personally courted Albert Salomon Anselm von Rothschild in order to obtain his family&#x27;s monetary support until the government could buy the ships.

=== Budget negotiations and passage ===

The budgets providing funding for the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class were finally approved after two meetings of the Austrian &quot;Reichsrat&quot; and the Diet of Hungary in October and November 1910, with opposition being rejected as the Italian Navy had laid down another three battleships during the summer. The retroactive passage of the 1910 budget and the passage of the 1911 budget was secured between December and March with little opposition. István Tisza, who had won Hungary&#x27;s 1910 parliamentary election but instead chose to allow a government to form under Károly Khuen-Héderváry, secured passage of the budgets with his large parliamentary majority. This was done after it was agreed the contract for the battleship which would eventually become &quot;Szent István&quot; was to be awarded to the Ganz-Danubius shipyard in Fiume. Tisza&#x27;s political allies were likewise won over with bribes such as being appointed to the board of directors of the Adria Line. Securing passage of the budgets in the Austrian &quot;Reichsrat&quot; had been comparatively easy. Karel Kramář, leader of the Young Czech Party, supported the budgets with the justification that he had &quot;a certain weakness for the navy.&quot; Šusteršič, leader of the Slovene bloc, rallied support by arguing that the battleships were in the best interests of the navy and the Slovenian people. German politicians supported the battleships&#x27; construction on the grounds that their existence made Austria-Hungary a more powerful ally for Germany. The final package included provisions which ensured that while the armor and guns of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class were to be constructed within Austria, the electrical wiring and equipment aboard each ship was to be assembled in Hungary. Additionally, half of all ammunition for the battleships&#x27; guns would be purchased in Austria and half was to be bought in Hungary. Only the Social Democrats opposed the budgets. Their leader, Karl Seitz, decried the worsening relations with Italy and called for negotiations with Rome to end the Austro-Italian naval arms race. In a sign of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s strained relationship with her nominal ally Italy, the proposal failed with little support outside of Seitz&#x27; party. The budgets passed both parliaments with large majorities, ensuring that the financial questions regarding the construction of the ships were resolved.

== Design ==
=== General characteristics ===

Designed by naval architect Siegfried Popper, the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class ships had an overall length of , with a beam of and a draught of at deep load. They were designed to displace at load, but at full combat load they displaced . The propellers for the class is where differences in design began to appear between the three ships constructed in Trieste, and &quot;Szent István&quot; which was constructed in Fiume. The skeg for each propeller shaft on &quot;Szent István&quot; was a solid, blade-like fitting, unlike the strut-type skegs used in the other three &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s. The hull was built with a double bottom, deep, with a reinforced inner bottom that consisted of two layers of plates. This design was intended by Popper to protect the battleships from naval mines, although it ultimately failed both &quot;Szent István&quot; and &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;, the former being sunk by a torpedo in June 1918 and the latter by a mine in November of that same year. The &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class also featured two Barr and Stroud optical rangefinder posts on both the starboard and port sides for the secondary guns of each ship. These rangefinders were equipped with an armored cupola, which housed an Schwarzlose M.07/12 anti-aircraft machine gun.

&quot;Szent István&quot; had a few external variations from the other ships of her class. These differences included a platform built around the fore funnel which extended from the bridge of the ship to the after funnel upon which several searchlights were installed. A further distinguishing feature was the modified ventilator trunk in front of the mainmast. The rangefinders on &quot;Szent István&quot; had an armored stand which turned 90° to the right of those on the other three ships. This was done in order to present a smaller target for the ship&#x27;s broadside. Perhaps the most-notable distinguishing characteristic of &quot;Szent István&quot; was that she was the only ship of her class not to be fitted with torpedo nets. The other three ships of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class had their torpedo nets removed in June 1917. The &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class ships were manned by a crew of 1,087 officers and men.

=== Propulsion ===

Differences between the three battleships constructed in Trieste and the one in Fiume were most apparent when examining each ship&#x27;s propulsion. &quot;Szent István&quot; differed from the other ships in that she possessed two propellers and two larger Parsons steam turbines, while the propulsion of &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;, &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; each had four smaller Siemens turbines and four propellers. These turbines were housed in a separate engine-room and with the exception of SMS &quot;Szent István&quot;, they were powered by twelve Yarrow boilers. The more modern new type of Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers of &quot;Szent István&quot; were 48 tonnes heavier than the older type Yarrow boilers installed on the sister ships; however, they were more efficient than the old boilers. The new Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers had a huge advantage of being able to maintain top speed for up to eight hours, compared with only two hours on their sister ships. They were designed to produce a total of , which was theoretically enough to attain a maximum designed speed of . While it was reported during the speed trials of &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; that she attained a top speed of , the actual top speed of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class ships is unknown as the sea trial data and records for each ship were lost after the war. Each ship also carried of coal, and an additional of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s could steam for at a speed of .

=== Armament ===
Constructed at the Škoda Works in Plzeň, Bohemia, the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s″ main battery consisted of twelve 45-calibre Škoda K10 guns mounted in four triple turrets. Two turrets each were mounted forward and aft of the main superstructure in a superfiring pair. The implementation of triple turrets came about for two reasons: the need to ensure the ships had a more compact design and smaller displacement to conform to Austro-Hungarian naval doctrine and budget constraints, and to counter the implementation of triple turrets on the Italian &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot;. While the Italians had initiated construction on &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot; before work had begun on the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class, the shipyards in Trieste were able to construct &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; faster than their Italian counterparts and she was commissioned in December 1912, just a month before &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot;. This made the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s the first dreadnoughts in the world with triple turrets, in which the Austro-Hungarian Navy took great pride.

Having three guns on each turret rather than two made it possible to deliver a heavier broadside than other dreadnoughts of a similar size and meant a shorter citadel and better weight distribution. The choice of implementing triple turrets also assisted in the construction speed of the first two ships, as the guns were available at short notice because Škoda had already been working on a triple-turret design ordered by the Imperial Russian Navy when their initial order for the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class arrived.

The &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s carried a secondary armament which consisted of a dozen 50-calibre Škoda K10 guns mounted in casemates amidships. Additionally, eighteen 50-calibre Škoda K10 guns were mounted on open pivot mounts on the upper deck, above the casemates. Three more Škoda K10 guns were mounted on the upper turrets for anti-aircraft duties. Two additional Schwarzlose M.07/12 anti-aircraft machine guns were mounted atop the armoured cupolas of each ship&#x27;s rangefinders. Each ship had two Škoda G. L/18 landing guns, and two Škoda SFK L/44 S guns for use against small and fast vessels such as torpedo boats and submarines. Each ship was also fitted with four submerged torpedo tubes, one each in the bow, the stern, and each side. Each ship usually carried twelve torpedoes.

=== Armor ===
The &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class ships were protected at the waterline with an armor belt which measured thick in the central citadel, where the most important parts of the ship were located. This armor belt was located between the midpoints of the fore and aft barbettes, and thinned to further towards the bow and stern, but did not reach either. It was continued to the bow by a small patch of armor. The upper armor belt had a maximum thickness of , but it thinned to from the forward barbette all the way to the bow. The casemate armor was also thick.

The sides of the main gun turrets, barbettes, and main conning tower were protected by of armor, except for the turret and conning tower roofs which were thick. The thickness of the decks ranged from in two layers. The underwater protection system consisted of the extension of the double-bottom upwards to the lower edge of the waterline armor belt, with a thin plate acting as the outermost bulkhead. It was backed by a torpedo bulkhead that consisted of two plates. The total thickness of this system was only , which made it incapable of containing a torpedo warhead detonation or mine explosion without rupturing.

In the spring of 1909, Montecuccoli sent an officer from the Naval Section of the War Ministry to Berlin in order to obtain input from Alfred von Tirpitz on the design of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class. The Imperial German Navy had conducted gunnery and torpedo tests and concluded that, &quot;The angle between [the] armored deck and belt armor should be as flat as possible&quot;, and that &quot;The armored torpedo bulkhead should be angled inwards, the second longitudinal bulkhead outwards. The distance of the torpedo bulkhead from the outer plating should be raised from 2.5 to 4 meters.&quot; While Popper adopted several of Tirpitz&#x27;s suggestions regarding the external layout of the belt armor for the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class, the internal modifications put forward by the Imperial German Navy were not implemented.

===Assessment===

Although smaller than the contemporary dreadnought and super-dreadnought battleships of the German &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; and the British Royal Navy, the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class was the first of its type in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. The &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s were described by former Austro-Hungarian naval officer Anthony Sokol in his book &quot;The Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian Navy&quot; as &quot;excellent ships&quot;, and were acknowledged as some of the most powerful of their type in the region. Their design signaled a change in Austro-Hungarian naval policy, as the ships were capable of far more than coastal defense or patrolling the Adriatic Sea. The &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s were so well received that when the time came to plan for the replacement of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s old s, the navy elected to simply take the layout of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class and enlarge them to have a slightly greater tonnage and larger main guns.

Despite these praises, criticisms of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class design exist. Friedrich Prasky refers to the ships in his article &quot;The Viribus Unitis class&quot; &quot;The ships were too small and had a very low range of stability.&quot; Erwin Sieche writes in his article &quot;S.M.S. Szent István: Hungaria&#x27;s Only and Ill-Fated Dreadnought&quot; &quot;There had been much quibbling about the bad design of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class and the bad workmanship and riveting of the &quot;Szent István&quot; in particular.&quot; Poor riveting has been blamed for the sinking of &quot;Szent István&quot;, and Karl Mohl, chief non-commissioned officer of &quot;Szent István&quot;″s machinery, reported that the rivets from the ships snapped loose during the battleship&#x27;s sinking. Furthermore, reports emerged following the ship&#x27;s gunnery trials of rivets in the double bottom of the hull being blown out of their sockets. The sinking of &quot;Szent István&quot; revealed several flaws in the design of the ships&#x27; armor. The naval commission investigating the loss of the battleship ultimately concluded: &quot;The distance between mine armor and 15-cm-ammunition magazines is too small and a major design failure, which most probably caused the widening of the leak.&quot; Following &quot;Szent István&quot;″s sinking, it was also discovered that her propeller shafts had such a high degree of resistance that the ship&#x27;s rudder could only be laid at a maximum angle of 10° at full speed or else she would suffer from a heavy list.

=== Secrecy ===
Montecuccoli&#x27;s plans for the battleships gained approval from Emperor Franz Joseph I in January 1909, and by April plans for the ships&#x27; design, construction, and financing in the face of the ongoing budget crisis in Budapest were already being laid out. Upon learning that Austria-Hungary was planning or currently building a class of dreadnoughts, the British Admiralty considered the project &quot;as a concealed addition to the German fleet&quot; and interpreted the ships as Austria-Hungary&#x27;s way of repaying Germany for her diplomatic support during the former&#x27;s annexation of Bosnia in 1908. During the spring and summer of 1909, the United Kingdom was locked in a heated naval arms race with Germany which led the Royal Navy to look upon the Austro-Hungarian ships as a ploy by German Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz to outpace British naval construction, rather than the latest development in Austria-Hungary&#x27;s own naval arms race with Italy. The Admiralty&#x27;s concerns regarding the true purpose of the ships were so great that a British spy was dispatched to Berlin when Montecuccoli sent the officer to obtain recommendations from Tirpitz regarding the design and layout of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class ships.

These concerns continued to grow and in April 1909 British Ambassador Fairfax Leighton Cartwright asked Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal about the rumored battleships. Aehrenthal denied the construction of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class, but admitted that plans to construct a class of dreadnoughts were being considered. In an attempt to assure Cartwright that Austria-Hungary was not constructing any ships for the German Navy, Aehrenthal justified any naval expansion as being necessary to secure Austria-Hungary&#x27;s strategic interests in the Mediterranean. At the time, the potential of Austria-Hungary constructing four dreadnought battleships was widely regarded among the British press, public, and politicians as a provocation on the part of Germany. Neither the Admiralty&#x27;s suspicions, nor those of some politicians, managed to convince the British Parliament that the German government was attempting to use the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class to escalate Germany and Britain&#x27;s already contentious naval arms race. When Winston Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty in 1911, he rejected any potential Austro-German collusion regarding the battleships.

For a full year, the Austro-Hungarian Navy attempted to keep the project a state secret. This did not prevent rumors about their construction of a series of dreadnought battleships from circulating across Europe. The French Naval Attaché in Vienna complained to Paris in 1910 of extensive secrecy within the Austro-Hungarian Navy, which manifested itself in several ways. Among these were a ban on photography at Pola, future home port of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class, and near-constant observation by the Austro-Hungarian police. Roughly a year after the project began, the &quot;Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot;, the Austrian Social Democratic Party newspaper, reported the details of the battleships to the general public. The Christian Social Party, supportive of the construction of the ships and operating on the advice of the navy, published in its own newspaper, &quot;Reichspost&quot;, that the secret dreadnought project and related financial agreements were true. The &quot;Reichspost&quot; lobbied in support of the project, citing Austria-Hungary&#x27;s national security concerns with an Italian dreadnought already under construction. When the story broke Archduke Ferdinand also worked to build public support for the battleships, and the small but growing Austrian Navy League did the same.

=== Assembly ===

The first ship of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class, &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;, was formally laid down on 23 July 1910. Originally referred to as &quot;Battleship IV&quot;, her keel was laid down after months of fiscal and political uncertainty. Two months later &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; was laid down on 24 September 1910. The title ship of the class, &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, was named after Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, a 19th-century Austrian naval admiral known for his 1866 victory over Italy at the Battle of Lissa. She was laid down once it became clear that Vienna and Budapest would pass the necessary budget funding to pay for the construction of the entire class.

By the end of 1910, construction on the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class ships was well underway. Two ships were being assembled in Trieste&#x27;s slipways, and more were in preparation. Aside from a brief strike in May 1911, construction on the battleships continued at a fast pace. Less than a year after being laid down in Trieste, &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; was launched on 24 June 1911 at a large ceremony featuring Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Austrian Minister of War, General Moritz von Auffenberg. &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;″s sponsor at the ceremony was Archduchess Maria Annunziata, sister to Franz Ferdinand. Seven months later, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was laid down on 16 January 1912. She was followed by &quot;Szent István&quot; on 29 January. &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; was launched on 21 March following delays due to poor weather around Trieste. Despite strikes in August 1912 and March 1913 by mechanics working on her engines, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was launched on 30 November, while construction on &quot;Szent István&quot; took longer due to the fact that the shipyards in Fiume had to be expanded for a ship of her size. She was launched two years later on 17 January 1914.

While the battleships were under construction, discussions began over what to name them. The Naval Section of the War Ministry initially proposed naming the four battleships &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, &quot;Don Juan&quot;, and &quot;Hunyadi&quot;. Newspapers within Austria reported during construction that one of the ships was to be named &quot;Kaiser Franz Joseph I&quot;, though it was later revealed the navy had no intentions of renaming the cruiser which already bore the Emperor&#x27;s name. Archduke Franz Ferdinand proposed &quot;Laudon&quot; for the fourth ship in honor of the Austrian field marshal. Emperor Franz Joseph I ultimately decided the names of the dreadnoughts, choosing to name the first ship using his own personal motto, &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; (Latin: &quot;With United Forces&quot;), while the fourth ship in the class would be named &quot;Szent István&quot; after the Hungarian king and saint, Stephen I.

=== Commissioning ===

When &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; was commissioned on 6 October 1912, she was at the time the most expensive warship ever to be constructed. The Italian &quot;Dante Alighieri&quot; had been laid down before &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; but was not commissioned until January 1913. This meant Austria-Hungary became the sixth nation, after the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, Brazil, and Japan to possess a dreadnought battleship. Montecuccoli addressed the Austrian and Hungarian Parliaments on 15 October 1912 and laid out his vision for the role the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class would play in naval policy. Declaring that Austria-Hungary had become &quot;a Mediterranean power&quot; in light of her new dreadnoughts, Montecuccoli expected that the new class of battleships would help Austria-Hungary &quot;assume our proper place among the Mediterranean powers&quot;.

&quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; was soon followed by &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, the namesake of the class, on 14 July 1913. During her gunnery trials, a discharge from one of the main guns of &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; damaged the staterooms of the ship&#x27;s officers. &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was commissioned on 8 July 1914, ten days after Archduke Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s assassination in Sarajevo. Expansion of the Graz-Danubius shipyards in Fiume delayed the launching and christening of &quot;Szent István&quot; until 17 January 1914. Though it was customary for either the Emperor or his heir to be present at the launching of a major warship, Franz Joseph was too feeble and his heir, Franz Ferdinand, refused to be there due to his anti-Hungarian attitudes. Franz Joseph sent a telegram of congratulations to avoid controversy, and the ceremony was presided over by Archduchess Maria Theresa who launched it with the words: &quot;Slip out and may the protection of the Almighty be with you on all your ways!&quot; Also present at the ceremony was Hungarian Prime Minister Tisza, Minister of Finance János Teleszky, and Minister to the Imperial Court Stephan Burián von Rajecz. As the German cruiser had recently been refitted at Trieste, her officers also attended the ceremony.

During the launching itself there was an accident when the starboard anchor had to be dropped to prevent the ship from hitting a ship carrying spectators of the celebrations, but the anchor chain had not been shackled to the ship and it struck two dockworkers, killing one and crushing the left leg of the other. The following day, the navy had to raise the anchor out of of water and re-attach it to the ship. Her fitting out was further delayed by the start of World War I six months later, and she was commissioned as the final battleship of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class on 13 December 1915.

== History ==
===Pre-war===

Prior to World War I, the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class served as the pride of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, conducting several voyages throughout the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas as members of the 1st Battle Division under the command of Vice-Admiral Maximilian Njegovan. In the spring of 1914 &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; and &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, together with &quot;Zrínyi&quot; and the coastal defense ship , traveled the eastern Mediterranean, the Sea of Sicily, and the Levant, visiting the ports of Smyrna, Beirut, Alexandria, and Malta. While at port in Alexandria, two of &quot;Monarch&quot;″s crew contracted smallpox and cerebrospinal meningitis which caused the ship to be quarantined for several weeks in Pola. Meanwhile, &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; and &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; arrived at Malta on 22 May, before leaving for Pola on 28 May. Upon their return, &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; was tasked with transporting Ferdinand to the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to watch military maneuvers. Following the maneuvers, Ferdinand and his wife Sophie planned to visit Sarajevo to open the state museum in its new premises. On 24 June the battleship brought the Archduke from Trieste to the Narenta River, where he boarded a yacht which took him north towards Sarajevo. After observing the military maneuvers for three days, the Archduke met his wife in Sarajevo. On 28 June 1914, they were shot to death by Gavrilo Princip.

Upon hearing of the assassination, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Anton Haus sailed south from Pola with an escort fleet comprising &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, the scout cruiser , and several torpedo boats. Two days after their murders, Ferdinand and Sophia&#x27;s bodies were transferred aboard &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;, which had been anchored waiting to receive the Archduke for his return, and were transported back to Trieste. &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; was shadowed by Haus&#x27; escort fleet for the journey, with the fleet moving slowly along the Dalmatian coast, usually within sight of land. Coastal towns and villages rang church bells when the ships passed while spectators watched the fleet from the shoreline. The Archduke&#x27;s death triggered the July Crisis, culminating in Austria-Hungary&#x27;s declaration of war on the Kingdom of Serbia on 28 July 1914.

=== World War I ===
==== Outbreak of war ====
Events unfolded rapidly in the ensuing days. On 30 July 1914 Russia declared full mobilization in response to Austria-Hungary&#x27;s declaration of war on Serbia. Austria-Hungary declared full mobilization the next day. On 1 August both Germany and France ordered full mobilization and Germany declared war on Russia in support of Austria-Hungary. While relations between Austria-Hungary and Italy had improved greatly in the two years following the 1912 renewal of the Triple Alliance, increased Austro-Hungarian naval spending, political disputes over influence in Albania, and Italian concerns over the potential annexation of land in the Kingdom of Montenegro caused the relationship between the two allies to falter in the months leading up to the war. Italy&#x27;s 1 August declaration of neutrality in the war dashed Austro-Hungarian hopes to use the ships of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class in major combat operations in the Mediterranean, as the navy had been relying upon coal stored in Italian ports to operate in conjunction with the &quot;Regia Marina&quot;. By 4 August Germany had already occupied Luxembourg and invaded Belgium after declaring war on France, and the United Kingdom had declared war on Germany in support of Belgian neutrality.

The assistance of the Austro-Hungarian fleet was called upon by the German Mediterranean Division, which consisted of the battlecruiser and &quot;Breslau&quot;. The German ships were attempting to break out of Messina, where they had been taking on coal prior to the outbreak of war. By the first week of August, British ships had begun to assemble off Messina in an attempt to trap the Germans. While Austria-Hungary had not yet fully mobilized its fleet, a force was assembled to assist the German ships. This consisted of the three &quot;Radetzky&quot;s and the three &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s, along with the armored cruiser , &quot;Admiral Spaun&quot;, six destroyers, and 13 torpedo boats. The Austro-Hungarian high command, wary of instigating war with Great Britain, ordered the fleet to avoid the British ships and to only support the Germans openly while they were in Austro-Hungarian waters. On 7 August, when the Germans broke out of Messina, the Austro-Hungarian fleet had begun to sail for Brindisi to link up with the Germans and escort their ships to a friendly port in Austria-Hungary. However, the German movement toward the mouth of the Adriatic had been a diversion to throw the British and French off their pursuit, and the German ships instead rounded the southern tip of Greece and made their way to the Dardanelles, where they would eventually be sold to the Ottoman Empire. Rather than follow the German ships towards the Black Sea, the Austrian fleet returned to Pola.

==== 1914–1915 ====

Following France and Britain&#x27;s declarations of war on Austria-Hungary on 11 and 12 August respectively, the French Admiral Augustin Boué de Lapeyrère was issued orders to close off Austro-Hungarian shipping at the entrance to the Adriatic Sea and to engage any Austro-Hungarian ships his Anglo-French fleet came across. Lapeyrère chose to attack the Austro-Hungarian ships blockading Montenegro. The ensuing Battle of Antivari ended Austria-Hungary&#x27;s blockade, and effectively placed the entrance of the Adriatic Sea firmly in the hands of Britain and France.

After the breakout of &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot;, the ships of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class saw very little action, spending much of their time in their base at Pola. The navy&#x27;s general inactivity was partly caused by a fear of mines in the Adriatic. Other factors contributed to the lack of naval activity among the ships of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class in the first year of the war. Haus was fearful that direct confrontation with the French Navy, even if it should be successful, would weaken the Austro-Hungarian Navy to the point that Italy would have a free hand in the Adriatic. This concern was so great to Haus that he wrote in September 1914, &quot;So long as the possibility exists that Italy will declare war against us, I consider it my first duty to keep our fleet intact.&quot; Haus&#x27; decision to use the Austro-Hungarian Navy as a fleet in being earned sharp criticism from the Austro-Hungarian Army, the German Navy, and the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Ministry, but it also led to a far greater number of Entente naval forces being devoted to the Mediterranean and the Strait of Otranto. These could have been used elsewhere, such as against the Ottoman Empire during the Gallipoli Campaign.

The most important factor contributing to the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s spending most of their time at port may have been the lack of coal. Prior to the war, the United Kingdom had served as Austria-Hungary&#x27;s primary source for coal. In the years before the war an increasing percentage of coal had come from mines in Germany, Virginia in the United States, and from domestic sources, but 75% of the coal purchased for the Austro-Hungarian Navy came from Britain. The outbreak of war meant that these sources, as well as those from Virginia, would no longer be available. Significant quantities of coal had been stockpiled before the war however, ensuring the navy was capable of sailing out of port if need be. Even so, the necessity of ensuring the navy&#x27;s most important ships such as the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s had the coal they needed in the event of an Italian or French attack or a major offensive operation resulted in the dreadnoughts remaining at port unless circumstances necessitated their deployment at sea.

In early 1915 Germany suggested that the Austro-Hungarian Navy conduct an attack on the Otranto Barrage in order to relieve pressure on the Ottoman Empire at the height of the Gallipoli Campaign. Haus rejected the proposal, countering that the French had pulled back their blockade to the southernmost end of the Adriatic Sea, and that none of the Anglo-French ships assigned to blockading the strait had been diverted to the Dardanelles.

Haus also advocated strongly in favor of keeping his battleships, in particular the ships of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class, in reserve in the event of Italy&#x27;s entry into the war on the side of the Entente. Haus believed that Italy would inevitably break her alliance with Austria-Hungary and Germany, and that by keeping Austria-Hungary&#x27;s battleships safe, they could rapidly be employed against Italy. This strategy enabled Austria-Hungary&#x27;s battleships to engage the Italians shortly after Italy&#x27;s declaration of war in May 1915.

==== Bombardment of Ancona ====

After failed negotiations with Germany and Austria-Hungary over Italy joining the war as a member of the Central Powers, the Italians negotiated with the Triple Entente for Italy&#x27;s eventual entry into the war on their side in the Treaty of London, signed on 26 April 1915. On 4 May Italy formally renounced her alliance to Germany and Austria-Hungary, giving the Austro-Hungarians advanced warning that Italy was preparing to go to war against them. On 20 May, Emperor Franz Joseph I gave the Austro-Hungarian Navy authorization to attack Italian ships convoying troops in the Adriatic or sending supplies to Montenegro. Haus meanwhile made preparations for his most valuable battleships to sortie out into the Adriatic in a massive strike against the Italians the moment war was declared. On 23 May 1915, between two and four hours after the Italian declaration of war reached the main Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola, the Austro-Hungarian fleet, including the three ships of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class, departed to bombard the Italian coast.

While several ships bombarded secondary targets and others were deployed to the south to screen for Italian ships that could be steaming north from Taranto, the core of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, spearheaded by the ships of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class, made their way to Ancona. The bombardment across the province of Ancona was a major success for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. In the port of Ancona an Italian steamer was destroyed and three others damaged. An Italian destroyer, &quot;Turbine&quot;, was sunk further south. The infrastructure of the port of Ancona and the surrounding towns was severely damaged. The railroad yard and port facilities in the city were damaged or destroyed, while local shore batteries defending them were knocked out. Multiple wharves, warehouses, oil tanks, radio stations, and coal and oil stores were set on fire by the bombardment, and the city&#x27;s electricity, gas, and telephone lines were severed. Within the city itself, Ancona&#x27;s police headquarters, army barracks, military hospital, sugar refinery, and Bank of Italy offices all saw damage. 30 Italian soldiers and 38 civilians were killed, while an additional 150 were wounded in the attack.

The Austro-Hungarian ships would later move on to bombard the coast of Montenegro, without opposition; by the time Italian ships arrived on the scene, the Austro-Hungarians were safely back in Pola. The objective of the bombardment of Ancona was to delay the Italian Army from deploying its forces along the border with Austria-Hungary by destroying critical transportation systems. The surprise attack on Ancona succeeded in delaying the Italian deployment to the Alps for two weeks. This delay gave Austria-Hungary valuable time to strengthen its Italian border and re-deploy some of its troops from the Eastern and Balkan fronts. The bombardment also delivered a severe blow to Italian military and public morale.

==== 1916–1917 ====

Largely unable to engage in major offensive combat operations after the Bombardment of Ancona, the ships were mostly relegated to defending Austria-Hungary&#x27;s coastline for the next three years. The lack of combat engagements, or even instances where the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s left port, is exemplified by the career of &quot;Szent István&quot;. The ship was unable to join her sisters in the Bombardment of Ancona and rarely left the safety of the port except for gunnery practice in the nearby Fažana Strait. She only spent 54 days at sea during her 937 days in service and made only a single two-day trip to Pag Island. In total, only 5.7% of her life was spent at sea; and for the rest of the time she swung at anchor in Pola Harbour. &quot;Szent István&quot; saw so little action and so little time at sea that she was never drydocked to have her bottom cleaned.

In January 1917 Emperor Karl I attended a military conference at Schloss Pless with German Kaiser Wilhelm II and members of the German Army and Navy. Haus, along with members of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s naval command at Pola, accompanied the Emperor to this conference in order to discuss naval operations in the Adriatic and Mediterranean for 1917. Days after returning from this conference, Grand Admiral Haus died of pneumonia aboard his flagship &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; on 8 February 1917. Newly crowned Karl I attended his funeral in Pola.

Despite his death, Haus&#x27; strategy of keeping the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and particularly its dreadnoughts, in port continued. By keeping the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s as a fleet in being, the Austro-Hungarian Navy would be able to continue to defend its lengthy coastline from naval bombardment or invasion by sea. The major ports of Trieste and Fiume would also remain protected. Furthermore, Italian ships stationed in Venice were effectively trapped by the positioning of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, preventing them from sailing south to join the bulk of the Entente forces at the Otranto Barrage.

Njegovan was promoted to admiral and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. With Njegovan appointed to higher office, command of the 1st Battle Division, which consisted of all four &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class ships, fell to Vice-Admiral Anton Willenik. Njegovan had previously voiced frustration watching the dreadnoughts he had commanded under Haus sit idle at port and upon taking command he had some 400,000 tons of coal at his disposal, but he chose to continue the strategy of his predecessor. Despite a change in command of both the Austro-Hungarian Navy and the Empire which it served, there would be no change in strategy regarding the employment of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class in battle.

Having hardly ever ventured out to port except to conduct gunnery practice for the past two years, the most significant moments the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class ships saw while moored in Pola were inspections by dignitaries. The first such visit was conducted by Emperor Karl I on 15 December 1916. During this brief visit the Emperor inspected Pola&#x27;s naval establishments and &quot;Szent István&quot;. Karl I returned to Pola in June 1917 in the first formal imperial review of the Austro-Hungarian Navy since 1902. This visit was far grander than his previous trip to the naval base, with officers and sailors crowding the decks of their ships at port and the naval ensign of Austria-Hungary flying from every vessel. The Emperor received multiple cheers and salutes from the men at Pola, who had spent the past two years doing little more than shooting down Italian airplanes and airships. The third dignitary visit came during Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s inspection of Pola&#x27;s German submarine base on 12 December 1917. During this trip, the German Emperor also took the time to inspect &quot;Szent István&quot; in similar fashion to his Austro-Hungarian counterpart. Aside from these visits, the only action the port of Pola and the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s were subject to between the Bombardment of Ancona and the summer of 1918 were the more than eighty air raids conducted by the newly formed Italian Air Force.

==== 1918 ====

Following the Cattaro Mutiny in February 1918, Admiral Njegovan was fired as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, though at Njegovan&#x27;s request it was announced that he was retiring. Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya, commander of &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, was promoted to rear admiral and named Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet. Horthy&#x27;s promotion was met with support among many members of the naval officer corps, who believed he would use Austria-Hungary&#x27;s navy to engage the enemy. Horthy&#x27;s appointment did however pose difficulties. His relatively young age alienated many of the senior officers, and Austria-Hungary&#x27;s naval traditions included an unspoken rule that no officer could serve at sea under someone of inferior seniority. This meant that the heads of the First and Second Battle Squadrons, as well as the Cruiser Flotilla, all had to go into early retirement.

In March 1918 Horthy&#x27;s position within the navy was secured, and he had begun to reorganize it according to his own vision, with strong support from Emperor Karl I. By this time, the United States had declared war on both Germany and Austria-Hungary and had begun to send ships to aid the French, British, and Italians in the Mediterranean Sea. Horthy had inherited an &quot;Austrian lake&quot; in the Adriatic Sea, according to the United States Navy, and shipping of supplies, troops, sick and wounded personnel, and military equipment across various ports in the Adriatic was done with little to no opposition from the Allied Powers. American planning for a naval offensive to sweep the Adriatic and even land up to 20,000 marines with naval and infantry support from Britain, France, and Italy were halted by the onset of the German spring offensive in France, launched on 21 March 1918. Horthy used these first few months as Commander-in-Chief to finish his re-organization of the navy. As one of Njegovan&#x27;s final actions before he was ousted entailed shifting several smaller and older vessels around to different ports under Austro-Hungarian control, the only ships which remained at port in Pola aside from the three of the &quot;Radetzky&quot; class were the four dreadnoughts of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; class, which had now fallen under the command of Captain Heinrich Seitz. Horthy worked to re-locate as many ships as he could back to Pola in order to maximize the threat the Austro-Hungarian Navy posed to the Allied Powers. Horthy also used his appointment to take the Austro-Hungarian fleet out of port for maneuvers and gunnery practice on a regular basis. The size of these operations were the largest the navy had seen since the outbreak of the war.

These gunnery and maneuver practices were conducted not only to restore order in the wake of several failed mutinies, but also to prepare the fleet for a major offensive operation. Horthy&#x27;s strategic thinking differed from his two predecessors, and shortly after assuming command of the navy he resolved to undertake a major fleet action in order to address low morale and boredom, and make it easier for Austro-Hungarian and German U-boats to break out of the Adriatic into the Mediterranean. After several months of practice, Horthy concluded the fleet was ready for a major offensive at the beginning of June 1918.

==== Otranto Raid ====

Horthy was determined to use the fleet to attack the Otranto Barrage. Planning to repeat his successful raid on the blockade in May 1917, Horthy envisioned a massive attack on the Allied forces with his four &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class ships providing the largest component of the assault. They would be accompanied by the three ships of the &quot;Erzherzog Karl&quot;-class pre-dreadnoughts, the three s, the cruiser &quot;Admiral Spaun&quot;, four s, and four torpedo boats. Submarines and aircraft would also be employed in the operation to hunt down enemy ships on the flanks of the fleet.

On 8 June 1918 Horthy took his flagship, &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;, and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; south with the lead elements of his fleet. On the evening of 9 June, &quot;Szent István&quot; and &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; followed along with their own escort ships. Horthy&#x27;s plan called for and to engage the Barrage with the support of the &quot;Tátra&quot;-class destroyers. Meanwhile, &quot;Admiral Spaun&quot; and would be escorted by the fleet&#x27;s four torpedo boats to Otranto to bombard Italian air and naval stations. The German and Austro-Hungarian submarines would be sent to Valona and Brindisi to ambush Italian, French, British, and American warships that sailed out to engage the Austro-Hungarian fleet, while seaplanes from Cattaro would provide air support and screen the ships&#x27; advance. The battleships, and in particular the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s, would use their firepower to destroy the Barrage and engage any Allied warships they ran across. Horthy hoped that the inclusion of these ships would prove to be critical in securing a decisive victory.

En route to the harbour at Islana, north of Ragusa, to rendezvous with &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; for the coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage, &quot;Szent István&quot; and &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; attempted to make maximum speed in order to catch up to the rest of the fleet. In doing so, &quot;Szent István&quot;″s turbines started to overheat and speed had to be reduced to . When an attempt was made to raise more steam in order to increase to &quot;Szent István&quot; produced an excess of smoke. At about 3:15 am on 10 June, two Italian MAS boats, &quot;MAS-15&quot; and &quot;MAS-21&quot;, spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships while returning from an uneventful patrol off the Dalmatian coast. The MAS platoon was commanded by &quot;Capitano di corvetta&quot; Luigi Rizzo, who had sunk the Austro-Hungarian coastal defense ship in Trieste six months before. The individual boats were commanded by &quot;Capo timoniere&quot; Armando Gori and &quot;Guardiamarina di complemento&quot; Giuseppe Aonzo respectively. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage each of the dreadnoughts. &quot;MAS-21&quot; attacked &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, but her torpedoes failed to hit the ship. &quot;MAS-15&quot; fired her two torpedoes successfully at 3:25 am at &quot;Szent István&quot;. Both boats evaded any pursuit although &quot;MAS-15&quot; had to discourage the Austro-Hungarian torpedo boat &quot;Tb 76 T&quot; by dropping depth charges in her wake. &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, thinking that the torpedoes were fired by submarines, pulled out of the formation and started to zigzag to throw off any further attacks. She repeatedly fired on suspected submarine periscopes.
&quot;Szent István&quot; was hit by two torpedoes abreast her boiler rooms. The aft boiler room quickly flooded and gave the ship a 10° list to starboard. Counterflooding of the portside trim cells and magazines reduced the list to 7°, but efforts to use collision mats to plug the holes failed. While this was going on the dreadnought steered for the nearby Bay of Brgulje at low speed, before eventually coming to a halt in order to provide additional power to the ship&#x27;s pumps, which could discharge of water per hour. However, water continued to leak into the forward boiler room and eventually doused all but the two boilers on the port side. This killed the power for the pumps and only left enough electricity to run the lights. The turrets were trained to port in a futile effort to counter the list and their ready ammunition was thrown overboard. Upon returning to the formation at 4:45 am, &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; attempted to take &quot;Szent István&quot; in tow, which failed. Many of the crew members of the sinking battleship assembled on the deck to use their weight along with the turned turrets as a counterbalance, but the ship was taking on too much water, with her watertight bulkheads giving way to the flooding one by one. &quot;Szent István&quot;″s chaplain performed one final blessing while the crew of &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; emerged onto her decks to salute the sinking ship. At 6:12 am, with the pumps unequal to the task, &quot;Szent István&quot; capsized off Premuda. 89 sailors and officers died in the sinking, 41 of them from Hungary. The low death toll can be partly attributed to the long amount of time it took for the battleship to sink, and the fact that all sailors with the Austro-Hungarian Navy had to learn to swim before entering active service. The captain of &quot;Szent István&quot;, Heinrich Seitz, was prepared to go down with his ship but was saved after being thrown off the bridge when she capsized.

Film footage and photographs exist of &quot;Szent István&quot;″s last half-hour, taken by &quot;Linienschiffsleutnant&quot; Meusburger of &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; with his own camera and by an official film crew. The two films were later spliced together and exhibited in the United States after the war. The battleship&#x27;s sinking was one of only two on the high seas to ever be filmed, the other being that of the British battleship during World War II. Proceeds from the film of &quot;Szent István&quot; capsizing were eventually used to feed children in Austria following the ending of the war.

Fearing further attacks by torpedo boats or destroyers from the Italian navy, and possible Allied dreadnoughts responding to the scene, Horthy believed the element of surprise had been lost and called off the attack. In reality, the Italian torpedo boats had been on a routine patrol, and Horthy&#x27;s plan had not been betrayed to the Italians as he had feared. The Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed Pola until 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that they were no longer there. Nevertheless, the loss of &quot;Szent István&quot; and the blow to morale it had on the navy forced Horthy to cancel his plans to assault the Otranto Barrage. The fleet returned to the base at Pola where it would remain for the rest of the war.

==== End of the war ====

On 17 July 1918, Pola was struck by the largest air raid the city would see during the war. 66 Allied planes dropped over 200 bombs, though none of the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s were hit or damaged in the attack.

By October 1918 it had become clear that Austria-Hungary was facing defeat in the war. With various attempts to quell nationalist sentiments failing, Emperor Karl I decided to sever Austria-Hungary&#x27;s alliance with Germany and appeal to the Allied Powers in an attempt to preserve the empire from complete collapse. On 26 October Austria-Hungary informed Germany that their alliance was over. In Pola the Austro-Hungarian Navy was in the process of tearing itself apart along ethnic and nationalist lines. Horthy was informed on the morning of 28 October that an armistice was imminent, and used this news to maintain order and prevent a mutiny among the fleet. While a mutiny was avoided, tensions remained high and morale was at an all-time low. The situation was so stressful for members of the navy that the captain of &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, Alexander Milosevic, committed suicide in his quarters aboard the battleship.

On 29 October, the National Council in Zagreb announced Croatia&#x27;s dynastic ties to Hungary had come to a formal conclusion. The National Council also called for Croatia and Dalmatia to be unified, with Slovene and Bosnian organizations pledging their loyalty to the newly formed government. This new provisional government, while throwing off Hungarian rule, had not yet declared independence from Austria-Hungary. Thus Emperor Karl I&#x27;s government in Vienna asked the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs for help maintaining the fleet stationed at Pola and keeping order among the navy. The National Council refused to assist unless the Austro-Hungarian Navy was first placed under its command. Emperor Karl I, still attempting to save the Empire from collapse, agreed to the transfer, provided that the other &quot;nations&quot; which made up Austria-Hungary would be able to claim their fair share of the value of the fleet at a later time. All sailors not of Slovene, Croatian, Bosnian, or Serbian background were placed on leave for the time being, while the officers were given the choice of joining the new navy or retiring.

The Austro-Hungarian government thus decided to hand over the bulk of its fleet to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs without a shot being fired. This was considered preferential to handing the fleet to the Allies, as the new state had declared its neutrality. Furthermore, the newly formed state had also not yet publicly dethroned Emperor Karl I, keeping the possibility of reforming the Empire into a triple monarchy alive. The transfer to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs began on the morning of 31 October, with Horthy meeting representatives from the South Slav nationalities aboard his flagship, &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;. After &quot;short and cool&quot; negotiations, the arrangements were settled and the handover was completed that afternoon. The Austro-Hungarian Naval Ensign was struck from &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;, and was followed by the remaining ships in the harbor. After the transfer, Horthy took with him from his personal cabin a portrait of Emperor Franz Joseph I, which the late Emperor had gifted to the battleship, along with the ceremonial silk ensign of &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;, and Horthy&#x27;s own personal admiral&#x27;s flag. That evening &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; was renamed &quot;Jugoslavija&quot;. Control over the battleship, and the head of the newly established navy for the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, fell to Captain Janko Vuković, who was raised to the rank of admiral and took over Horthy&#x27;s old responsibilities as Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet.

On 1 November 1918, the transfer being still unknown to Italy, two men of the Italian Regia Marina, Raffaele Paolucci and Raffaele Rossetti, rode a primitive manned torpedo (nicknamed &quot;Mignatta&quot; or &quot;leech&quot;) into the naval base at Pola. Using limpet mines, they attacked &quot;Jugoslavija&quot; and the freighter &quot;Wien&quot;. Traveling down the rows of battleships, the two men encountered &quot;Jugoslavija&quot; at around 4:40 am. Rossetti placed one canister of TNT on the hull of the battleship, timed to explode at 6:30 am. He then flooded the second canister, sinking it on the harbor floor close to the ship. The men had no breathing sets, and therefore had to keep their heads above water. They were discovered and taken prisoner just after placing the explosives under the battleship&#x27;s hull. The Italians did not know that the Austrian government had handed over &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot;, along with most of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. They were taken aboard &quot;Jugoslavija&quot;, where they informed her new captain of what they had done but did not reveal the exact position of the explosives. Vuković then arranged for the two prisoners to be taken safely to the sister ship &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, and ordered the evacuation of the ship. The explosion did not happen at 6:30 am as predicted and Vuković, believing mistakenly that the Italians had lied, returned to the ship with many sailors. When the mines exploded shortly afterwards at 6:44 am, the battleship sank in 15 minutes; Vuković and 300–400 of the crew went down with her. The second explosive canister, lying on the bottom, exploded close to the freighter &quot;Wien&quot;, resulting in her sinking. The two Italians were interned for a few days until the end of the war and were honored by the Kingdom of Italy with the Gold Medal of Military Valor.

=== Post-war ===
The Armistice of Villa Giusti, signed between Italy and Austria-Hungary on 3 November 1918, refused to recognize the transfer of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s warships to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. As a result, on 4 November 1918, Italian ships sailed into the ports of Trieste, Pola, and Fiume. On 5 November, Italian troops occupied the naval installations at Pola. While the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs attempted to hold onto their ships, they lacked the men and officers to do so as most sailors who were not South Slavs had already gone home. The National Council did not order any men to resist the Italians, but they also condemned Italy&#x27;s actions as illegitimate. On 9 November, all remaining ships in Pola harbor had the Italian flag raised. At a conference at Corfu, the Allied Powers agreed the transfer of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s Navy to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs could not be accepted, despite sympathy from the United Kingdom. Faced with the prospect of being given an ultimatum to hand over the former Austro-Hungarian warships, the National Council agreed to hand over the ships beginning on 10 November 1918.

It would not be until 1920 that the final distribution of the ships was settled among the Allied Powers under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Of the two remaining &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;s, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was ceded to France. The French Navy removed the main armament of the battleship for inspection, then used the dreadnought as a target ship. She was first subject to test aerial bombardment attacks and later sunk by the battleships , , and off Toulon on 28 June 1922, exactly eight years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. In March 1919, &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; and , both flying the Italian flag, were escorted into Venice where they were exhibited as war trophies by the Italians. During that time period, &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; starred in the movie &quot;Eroi dei nostri mari&quot; (&quot;Heroes of our seas&quot;) which depicted the sinking of &quot;Szent István&quot;. Following the adoption of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, she was broken up at La Spezia between 1924 and 1925. The wreck of &quot;Viribus Unitis&quot; was salvaged from of water in Pola harbor and scrapped between 1920 and 1930.

=== Legacy ===
After the war, &quot;MAS-15&quot; was installed in the Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II as part of the &quot;Museo del Risorgimento&quot; in Rome for the torpedo boat&#x27;s role in the sinking of &quot;Szent István&quot;. The anniversary of the sinking, 10 June, has been celebrated by the &quot;Regia Marina&quot;, and its successor, the &quot;Marina Militare&quot;, as the official Italian Navy Day (). After &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; was dismantled, one of her anchors was placed on display at the Monument to Italian Sailors at Brindisi, where it can still be found.

Following the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria into Nazi Germany on 12 March 1938, Adolf Hitler used Austria-Hungary&#x27;s naval history to appeal to the Austrian public and obtain their support. Having lived in Vienna during the development of much of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, Hitler decided upon an &quot;Austrian&quot; sounding name for a German cruiser which was being constructed at Kiel. The cruiser was originally to be named &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; after Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, although concerns over the possible insult to Italy and Benito Mussolini of naming the cruiser after the Austrian victor of the Battle of Lissa, led the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to adopt as the ship&#x27;s namesake, after the Austrian general Prince Eugene of Savoy. &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; had also served as the name for four Austrian naval ships between 1848 and 1918. She was launched on 22 August 1938, in a ceremony attended by Hitler and the Governor (German: &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot;) of Ostmark, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, who made the christening speech. Also present at the launch was Regent of Hungary, Admiral Miklós Horthy. Horthy had previously commanded the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;-class battleship &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; from 24 November 1917 to 1 March 1918 and had commanded the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the final months of World War I. Horthy wife&#x27;s, Magdolna Purgly, performed the christening. In reference to her originally planned name and in homage to the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the bell from &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; was presented to the German cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; on 22 November 1942 by the Italian Regia Marina. After World War II, the bell from &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; was placed on display in Graz, Austria, where it can still be viewed.

The wreck of &quot;Szent István&quot; was located in the mid-1970s by the Yugoslav Navy. She lies upside down at a depth of . Her bow broke off when it hit the seabed while the stern was still afloat, but is immediately adjacent to the rest of the heavily encrusted hull. The two holes from the torpedo hits are visible in the side of the ship as is another deep hole which may be from a torpedo fired at &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; by &quot;MAS-21&quot;. She is a protected site of the Croatian Ministry of Culture.

<text>Arcanite is a potassium sulfate mineral with formula K2SO4.

Arcanite was first described in 1845 for an occurrence in old pine railroad ties in the Santa Ana tin mine, Trabuco Canyon, Santa Ana Mountains, Orange County, California, US. It has also been reported from hydrothermal deposits in the Cesano geothermal field, Latium, Italy; in bat guano on the Chincha Islands of Peru; and in caves in Western Australia, South Africa and Namibia.

Well-crystalline specimens sold as &#x27;arcanite&#x27; are grown synthetically in places such as Poland for the decorative specimen market and are not natural minerals.

<text>Wytch Farm is an oil field and processing facility in the Purbeck district of Dorset, England. It is the largest onshore oil field in Western Europe. The facility, taken over by Perenco in 2011, was previously operated by BP. It is located in a coniferous forest on Wytch Heath on the southern shore of Poole Harbour, two miles (3.2 km) north of Corfe Castle. Oil and natural gas (methane) are both exported by pipeline; liquefied petroleum gas is exported by road tanker.

==History==

===Name===
The oil field takes its name from the neighbouring Wytch Farm which had existed on the site for many centuries on the fringes of Wytch Heath.

===Pre-1973===
The earliest industry in the Wytch Farm area dated to the early medieval period and featured multiple salt production workshops. The workshops, adjacent to the modern oilfield, were part of a medieval salt industry owned by Milton Abbey. The site was excavated by Bournemouth University under the directorship of Dr Derek Pitman.

The Isle of Purbeck&#x27;s oil shale, or &quot;Kimmeridge Coal&quot; which has been won from the cliffs to the east of Kimmeridge since the early 17th century, is no longer used commercially. Similar deposits were found at Wytch Farm in the 1890s, but were commercially exploited until only circa 1900, and only at a low level. The Kimmeridge Oil and Carbon Company reported that in 1890 it had dug of tunnels at Kimmeridge on four levels into the local cliffs. There was a local jetty to export the oil shale, and smaller operations occurred at nearby Bencliff Grit east of Osmington Mills.

The Isle of Purbeck&#x27;s oil industry began in 1936 with the first unsuccessful and then experimental wells drilled at Broad Bench near Kimmeridge by D&#x27;Arcy Exploration. The area had long been mined for oil shale and tar, but was only prospected for crude oil in the 1950s. It was not until 1959 that a borehole at Kimmeridge showed that oil was seeping out, and 1960 that BP&#x27;s Kimmeridge Oil Field was discovered.

===1973 to date===
The field was discovered by the British government owned British Gas Corporation in December 1973 and began producing oil in 1979. Wytch Farm was sold to BP which took over as operator in 1984. In May 2011, BP announced that it had agreed to sell its majority interest in Wytch Farm to Perenco, which became the new operator. Premier Oil has a 30.1% stake in the field. On 17 May 2011, BP announced the sale of its interests in the Wytch Farm, Wareham, Beacon and Kimmeridge fields to Perenco and the sale of the Dimlington gas terminal to Perenco in February 2011. In September 2012, Perenco UK applied to Dorset County Council (DCC) for permission to extend the life of 39 planning permissions at three of the oilfields. DCC&#x27;s Planning Committee recommended approval of the applications on 6 September 2013, thereby extending to 2037 the operational life of the oilfields, beyond their original end-date of 2016.

=== 2023 oil spill ===
On 26 March 2023, the Poole Harbour Commissioners reported that around 200 barrels of &quot;reservoir fluid&quot; had leaked into Poole Harbour from one of the oil field&#x27;s pipelines. The Environment Agency described it as a &quot;major incident&quot;. Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole Council leader Philip Broadhead called the leak &quot;unacceptable...some serious questions need to be answered&quot;.

==Geology==
The field is located in a faulted block of Jurassic and older rocks beneath the Hampshire Basin, close to the steeply sloping monocline in the overlying chalk. The Purbeck Monocline defines the field&#x27;s southern limit. The field consists of three separate reservoirs known as Bridport, Sherwood and Frome. Bridport, the first discovery, is in the Jurassic Bridport Sands below Poole Harbour, with an oil source in the Lower Lias. The much larger Sherwood (discovered 1978) is below this in the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone at and extends under Poole Bay. The Frome reservoir is in a shelly limestone within the Frome Clay at . The field extends eastwards from Sandbanks and Studland for around under the sea to the south of Bournemouth.

==Environment==

Most of the field is protected by various conservation laws, including the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site, Purbeck Heritage Coast and a number of sites of special scientific interest, areas of outstanding natural beauty and nature reserves (including Studland and Brownsea Island), so the gathering centre and most of the well sites are small and well screened by trees. Directional drilling has also contributed to reducing the impact on the local environment, with extended reach drilling from the Goathorn Peninsula attaining distances in excess of 10 km.

==Production and reserves==

Production grew from in 1984 and eventually peaked at in 1997; by 2002 this had declined to . In 2002 it was estimated that the field contained reserves of 65.40 million tonnes of oil (479.6 million barrels), 4.73 million tonnes of natural gas liquids and of natural gas that will last until 2020 and 2025 respectively.

Oil is also transported to Wytch Farm for processing from two smaller Dorset oilfields, Wareham (discovered in 1964) by pipeline and Kimmeridge Oil Field (discovered in 1959) by road.

Oil is piped about from Wytch Farm via Fawley to a terminal on the far side of Southampton Water at Hamble, for export by tanker. Natural Gas (methane) is piped to Sopley, north of Christchurch, for use in the national domestic gas supply network. Smaller quantities of liquefied petroleum gas are transported by road. A rail terminal at Furzebrook connecting to the Swanage Railway between Corfe Castle and Wareham is now closed and mothballed.

=== Production process plant ===
The well fluids from the field and the remote well sites are combined at the gathering station. Oil is routed to the first stage separator where initial separation of the well fluids into its component parts takes place. Produced water settles to the bottom of the horizontal separator vessel, oil floats on the water layer and gas (vapour) occupies the top of the vessel. These three fluids are withdrawn continuously from the vessel to downstream plant.

Oil flows to further separators operating at lower pressures, where further vapour and produced water are separated and removed. The oil then passes to a desalter to reduce the salt content. Fresh water is added to the oil and the oil-water mixture which is allowed to settle. The salt dissolves preferentially in the water phase reducing the salt content of the oil. Treated oil is cooled and stored in tanks before finally being pumped through the 16-inch (0.4 m) pipeline to the storage and loading facility at Hamble.

The vapour from the separators is cooled, compressed and dehydrated by counter-current contact with glycol. It is chilled by refrigeration and routed to a series of fractionation towers. These include a de-ethaniser which separates the methane (CH4) from ethane (C2H6). There is a depropaniser to remove propane (C3H8) and a debutaniser to remove butane (C4H10). Some of the gases – the methane and ethane – are used as fuel gas on the site, the rest is compressed, odorised (with tertiary butyl mercaptan) and is routed via a 8-inch (0.2 m) pipeline to Sopley near Christchurch where it enters the National Gas Grid. Propane and butane (known collectively as LPG or liquefied petroleum gas) are maintained as liquids, they are odorised (with ethyl mercaptan) and stored in horizontal vessels on the site. LPG is sold and transported from the site by road tanker.

Produced water from the separators is combined with treated site surface water and seawater and is injected into the reservoir via five wells. This provides a disposal route for oily water and maintains pressure in the reservoir.

There are several facilities that support oil and gas production, these include:

* Two open cycle gas turbines each with a capacity of 17.7 MW. The turbine exhaust stacks include waste heat recovery units
* Three ground flares (Low Temperature, Low Pressure and High Pressure) for emergency or maintenance flaring of gas
* Abstraction of seawater from Cleaval Point and Furzey Island
* Compressed air for plant instrumentation
* Generation and storage of liquid nitrogen
* Methanol for injection into gas streams to prevent hydrate formation
* Refrigeration system.

=== Oil specification ===
The produced oil has a gravity of 37/38°API, and a sulphur content of 0.1 to 0.2%.

The oil product sent to Hamble has the following properties:

<doc id="1089226" wikidata="Q2339538" url="?curid=1089226" title="Blaze and Satanus">
<text>Blaze and Satanus are twin fictional demonic siblings appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Blaze debuted in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #655 (July 1990), created by Roger Stern and Brett Breeding and first pencilled by Bob McLeod. Later, Satanus was created by Brett Breeding and debuted in &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #493 (August 1992) by Jerry Ordway and Tom Grummett. The twin duo originally starred as Superman villains associated with the supernatural but were later revealed to be the children of the Wizard Shazam, Blaze respectively depicted as a powerful enemy of the Marvel Family.

==Fictional character biographies==
=== Origin ===
Blaze and Satanus are demonic hybrid children of the wizard Shazam and an unnamed Hellhound demoness who assumed human form to seduce him. Shortly after their birth, the twin children would be banished by the Cannite gods along with their mother back to their home world, having found his act to be displeasing as Jebediah learned the lesson to resisting sexual temptation. However, the two would embrace their demonic heritage and forsake their humane one, with Blaze holding the most hatred for their father.

=== Conflicts with Superman and other heroes ===

Later in her life, Blaze is involved in the creation of Superman&#x27;s enemies the Silver Banshee and Skyhook. She disguises herself as Metropolis nightclub owner Angelica Blaze to steal souls. In one altercation, Superman follows her to Hell to fight for the souls of Jimmy Olsen and Perry White&#x27;s son Jerry (who, in fact, was the son of Perry&#x27;s wife Alice and Lex Luthor). Superman manages to save Jimmy Olsen, but Blaze succeeds in killing Jerry White, whose selfless sacrifice saves his soul.

Conversely, Satanus resembles a traditional demon, with large horns and dark red skin. He wears a heavy Roman-style helmet which buries his face in shadow. Blaze and Satanus fight each other for possession of Blaze&#x27;s domain, using Superman as a pawn. Satanus has an Earthly identity and disguises himself as Collin Thornton, the publisher of &quot;Newstime&quot; magazine, who had previously hired Clark Kent as editor. At one point, Blaze also clashed with Jared Stevens.

In the &quot;Powers of Shazam!&quot;, Blaze appears as the main antagonist in the first few arcs of the book, being responsible for the creation of Sinclair Batson, the rich cousin of Billy Batson who vehemently denies relations, through the wishes of his corrupt uncle, Ebeneezer Batson. She also plots to exact her revenge on her father as well as release the ultimate evil entity dwelling within the Rock of Eternity. She teams up with Black Adam but is foiled by the combined might of Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, and many of his allies in the process. Satanus also appears as an ally to foil his sister although he later returns to rescue her from certain doom.

===&quot;Underworld Unleashed&quot;===

During the &quot;Underworld Unleashed&quot; event, Blaze and Satanus gain increased power from the demon Neron in exchange for their souls.

===&quot;Day of Vengeance&quot;===

Satanus reveals to Superman that he is Collin Thornton when the Spectre arrives in Metropolis as part of his mission to destroy all evil magic during the &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; miniseries as part of Alexander Luthor Jr.&#x27;s plot.

===&quot;Reign in Hell&quot; and afterward===

Blaze and Satanus are major characters in the &quot;Reign in Hell&quot; miniseries. In this story, they have become the rulers of Purgatory and lead a rebellion against Hell by offering hope to the hopeless. They are opposed by Neron, other demons, and the magical superheroes of the DC Universe.

Blaze contacts Mary Marvel, offering to restore her lost powers in exchange for killing Freddy Freeman so that she can have his powers. Mary appears to go along with it, seemingly poisoning Freddy; however, when Blaze arrives, Freddy gets up and fights her, eventually impaling her on an iron statue and using his lightning to send her back to Hell. Now, Blaze seems to be interested in manipulating Osiris.

Satanus sends the Justice League to Hell, where the League thwarts Satanus&#x27; plans to obtain Dante&#x27;s mask. Satanus attempts to use the mask to become all-powerful, but is prevented by Plastic Man. The mask possesses him before the League destroys it and escapes from Hell.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. Blaze and Satanus are reimagined as the overlords of the Dark Realm and unrelated to Shazam. In &quot;Supergirl: Red Daughter of Krypton&quot;, Blaze is imprisoned by Shay Veritas before being freed.

==Powers and abilities==
In the DC Universe, both siblings are recognized as major demons with significant magical power, holding high-ranking positions in the infernal hierarchy within DC Comics&#x27; version of Hell. The pair can also share power with one another in given circumstances to bolster one another.

Blaze is a major demon in terms of supernatural power. She possesses abilities such as superhuman durability, demonic sorcery, heightened senses, and shapeshifting. In modern continuities, her magical abilities include transmutation, invisibility, superhuman strength, and spatial manipulation. It is speculated that she is capable of contending with powerful beings like Supergirl and Lobo. In her realm, called the Nether Realm, her power is nearly limitless, allowing her to animate rock, control fire and lava, manipulate souls, traverse dimensions, and alter her size and appearance. Those who fall under her demonic influence become her servants. In personal combat, she is strong enough to engage in battle with Captain Marvel, with her strength being compared to that of the demigod Hercules.

Satanus is, similarly, recognized as a demon lord with significant mystical power, placing him among the highest ranks of infernal authority in Hell. He possesses demonic sorcery and a diverse range of magical abilities, including illusion creation, shape-shifting, manipulation of eldritch energies, dimensional travel, and the ability to alter his size and appearance at will. He is occasionally seen wielding a gnawed, forked staff capable of emitting blasts of mystical hellfire. Following the New 52, Satanus&#x27;s powers have undergone some changes. He possesses supernatural physical prowess derived from his demonic nature and has abilities such as dimensional travel, reality alteration, and flight. Unlike his sister, he retains a fraction of his father&#x27;s powers, allowing him to invoke &quot;Shazam&quot; for supernatural effects. This power was demonstrated when he transformed Neron into a weakened, depowered state.

==Other versions==
Alternate universe variants of Blaze and Satanus created by Lex Luthor appear in &quot;&quot;.

== In other media ==
Blaze and Satanus appear as character summons in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.

<text>Wilsons Promontory, is a peninsula that forms the southernmost part of the Australian mainland, located in the state of Victoria.

South Point at is the southernmost tip of Wilsons Promontory and hence of mainland Australia. Located at nearby South East Point, () is the Wilsons Promontory Lighthouse. Most of the peninsula is protected by the Wilsons Promontory National Park and the Wilsons Promontory Marine National Park.

== Human history ==

The promontory was first occupied by indigenous Koori people at least 6,500 years prior to European arrival. Middens along the western coast indicate that the inhabitants subsisted on a seafood diet.

The promontory is mentioned in dreamtime stories, including the Bollum-Baukan, Loo-errn and Tiddalik myths. It is considered the home of the spirit ancestor of the Brataualung clan - &quot;Loo-errn&quot;. The area remains highly significant to the Gunai/Kurnai and the Boon wurrung people, who consider the promontory to be their traditional country/land.

The first European to see the promontory was George Bass in January 1798. He initially referred to it as &quot;Furneaux&#x27;s Land&quot; in his diary, believing it to be what Captain Furneaux had previously seen. But on returning to Port Jackson and consulting Matthew Flinders he was convinced that the location was so different it could not be that land.

Seal hunting was conducted in the area in the 19th century. Shore-based whaling was also carried out in a cove at Wilsons Promontory from at least 1837. It was still underway in 1843 at Lady&#x27;s Bay (Refuge Cove).

Throughout the 1880s and &#x27;90s a public campaign to protect the area as a national park was waged, including by the Field Naturalists&#x27; Club of Victoria. The promontory has been a national park, to one degree or another, since 1898. Wilsons Promontory National Park, also known locally as &quot;the Prom&quot;, contains the largest coastal wilderness area in Victoria. Until the 1930s, when the road was completed, it was accessible only by boat. The site was closed to the public during World War II, as it was used as a commando training ground. The only settlement within Wilsons Promontory is Tidal River which lies south of the park boundary and is the focus for tourism and recreation. This park is managed by Parks Victoria.
In 2005 a burn started by staff got out of control and burnt 13% of the park, causing the evacuation of campers. In 2009, a lightning strike near Sealer&#x27;s Cove started a fire that burned over . Much of the area had not been burned since 1951. The fire began on 8 February, the day after &quot;Black Saturday&quot;, where an intense heat wave, combined with arson, faulty electrical infrastructure and natural causes, led to hundreds of bushfires burning throughout the state of Victoria. Although the fire burned to within , the Tidal River camping area and park headquarters were unaffected. The park reopened to the public one month after the incident and the burned areas quickly regrew. Despite the damage, the natural beauty of the area remained largely intact.

In March 2011 a significant rainfall event led to major flooding of the Tidal River camping area. The bridge over Darby River was cut, leaving no vehicle access to Tidal River, leading to the evacuation of all visitors by helicopter over the following days, and the closure of the southern section of the park. In September 2011 public access to Tidal River was reopened following repair of the main access road, and the bridge at Darby River. All sections of the park south of Tidal River were closed while further repairs of tracks and footpaths were undertaken. The park was fully re-opened by Easter of 2012.

Tourists may choose basic or glam, cabins or camping (powered/unpowered) if they wish to stay inside Wilsons Promontory National Park. Many however choose to stay in accommodation just outside the Park in Yanakie, where they can still view the Wisons Promontory mountains and scenery and be only minutes from the Park&#x27;s free entrance.

There are overnight hiking tracks with two key circuits, one in the north and one in the south. The southern circuit is more popular with overnight hikers with several camping areas suited to wild camping. Camping is only allowed in the designated areas to reduce damage to the bush.

===Name===
The promontory is also known as &quot;Yiruk&quot; or &quot;Wamoon&quot; by some traditional owner groups. From the early 19th century, it has also been known as Wilsons Promontory. It was given this name by Governor Hunter on the recommendation of Matthew Flinders and George Bass: 

&quot;At our recommendation governor Hunter called it WILSON&#x27;S PROMONTORY, in compliment to my friend Thomas Wilson, Esq. of London.&quot;

Despite Wilson being significant enough for such a large amount of land to be named in his honour, he had slipped into obscurity until 2023, when new research was published by the Royal Australian Historical Society. Wilson was in fact one of the most important promoters of the study of the natural history of New South Wales, as Eastern Australia was then known, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He was a member of both the Society for Promoting Natural History and the Linnean Society, a wealthy apothecary, a patron of surgeon and botanical collector John White and supporter of Flinders. White dedicated his far-reaching and substantial account of the First Fleet to Wilson, entitled &quot;Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales&quot;

== Geography and wildlife==
Coastal features include expansive intertidal mudflats, sandy beaches and sheltered coves interrupted by prominent headlands and plunging granite cliffs in the south, backed by coastal dunes and swamps. The promontory is surrounded by a scatter of small granite islands which, collectively, form the Wilsons Promontory Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for breeding seabirds.

Tidal River is the main river in Wilsons Promontory. The river runs into Norman Bay and swells with the tide. The river is a very fascinating colour, a purple-yellow. This is due to the large number of tea trees in the location, which stain the water with tannin, giving it a tea-like appearance. Darby River is the second major river, with extensive alluvial flats and meanders. It was the site of the original park entrance and accommodation area from 1909 to the Second World War.

Wilsons Promontory is home to many marsupials, native birds and other creatures. One of the most common marsupials found on the promontory is the common wombat, which can be found in much of the park (especially around campsites where it has been known to invade tents searching for food). The peninsula is also home to kangaroos, snakes, wallabies, koalas, long-nosed potoroos, white-footed dunnarts, broad-toothed rats, feather-tailed gliders and emus. Some of the most common birds found on the promontory include crimson rosellas, yellow-tailed black cockatoos and superb fairywrens. There are also many pests, including hog deer, foxes, feral cats, rabbits, common starlings, and common blackbirds.

As the Wilsons Promontory Marine National Park and Corner Inlet Marine National Park have been established, the area holds a variety of marine life and coral reefs. In recent years, after a long disappearance, due to illegal hunting by the Soviet Union with help by Japan, Southern right whales started to return to the area to rest and calve in the sheltered bays along with Humpback whales. Killer whales are also known to pass the area, and dolphins, seals, sea lions, and penguins still occur today.

The peninsula is also home to two large sets of dunes, the Big Drift and Little Drift. They are not very well-known but sometimes visited by hikers and suitable for sandboarding.

==Climate==
Wilsons Promontory has an Oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) heavily influenced by the &quot;Roaring Forties&quot;, bringing summer temperatures far below what is the norm on mainland Australia at sea level. Winters and springs are dominated by low-pressure systems and high rainfall.

<doc id="1089240" wikidata="Q3771739" url="?curid=1089240" title="Bisulfide">
<text>Bisulfide (or bisulphide in British English) is an inorganic anion with the chemical formula HS− (also written as SH−). It contributes no color to bisulfide salts, and its salts may have a distinctive putrid smell. It is a strong base. Bisulfide solutions are corrosive and attack the skin.

It is an important chemical reagent and an industrial chemical, mainly used in paper pulp industry (Kraft process), textiles, synthetic flavors, coloring brasses, and iron control.

== Properties ==

A variety of salts are known, including sodium hydrosulfide and potassium hydrosulfide. Ammonium hydrosulfide, a component of &quot;stink bombs&quot; has not been isolated as a pure solid. Some compounds described as salts of the sulfide dianion contain primarily hydrosulfide. For example, the hydrated form of sodium sulfide, nominally with the formula , is better described as .

Aqueous bisulfide absorbs light at around 230 nm in the UV–visible spectrum. Using this approach, bisulfide has been detected in the ocean and in sewage.
Bisulfide should not be confused with the disulfide dianion, , or −S–S−.

=== Basicity ===

The bisulfide anion can accept a proton:

Because of its affinity to accept a proton (H+), bisulfide has a basic character. In aqueous solution, it has a corresponding p&quot;K&quot;a value of 6.9. Its conjugate acid is hydrogen sulfide (). However, bisulfide&#x27;s basicity stems from its behavior as an Arrhenius base. A solution containing spectator-only counter ions, has a basic pH according to the following acid-base reaction:
=== Chemical reactions ===

Upon treatment with an acid, bisulfide converts to hydrogen sulfide. With strong acids, it can be doubly protonated to give . Oxidation of bisulfide gives sulfate. When strongly heated, bisulfide salts decompose to produce sulfide salts and hydrogen sulfide.
=== Biochemistry ===

At physiological pH, hydrogen sulfide is usually fully ionized to bisulfide (HS−). Therefore, in biochemical settings, &quot;hydrogen sulfide&quot; is often used to mean, bisulfide. Hydrosulfide has been identified as the third gasotransmitter along with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide.

== Other derivatives ==

SH− is a soft anionic ligand that forms complexes with most metal ions. Examples include [Au(SH)2]− and (C5H5)2Ti(SH)2, derived from gold(I) chloride and titanocene dichloride, respectively.

== Safety ==

Bisulfide salts are corrosive, strongly alkaline and release toxic hydrogen sulfide upon acidification.

<text>Boehmite or böhmite is an aluminium oxide hydroxide (γ-AlO(OH)) mineral, a component of the aluminium ore bauxite. It is dimorphous with diaspore. It crystallizes in the orthorhombic dipyramidal system and is typically massive in habit. It is white with tints of yellow, green, brown or red due to impurities. It has a vitreous to pearly luster, a Mohs hardness of 3 to 3.5 and a specific gravity of 3.00 to 3.07. It is colorless in thin section, optically biaxial positive with refractive indices of nα = 1.644 – 1.648, nβ = 1.654 – 1.657 and nγ = 1.661 – 1.668.

Boehmite occurs in tropical laterites and bauxites developed on alumino-silicate bedrock. It also occurs as a hydrothermal alteration product of corundum and nepheline. It occurs with kaolinite, gibbsite and diaspore in bauxite deposits; and with nepheline, gibbsite, diaspore, natrolite and analcime in nepheline pegmatites. Industrially, it is used as an inexpensive flame retardant additive for fire-safe polymers.

It was first described by J. de Lapparent in 1927 for an occurrence in the bauxites of Mas Rouge, Les Baux-de-Provence, France, and named for the Bohemian-German chemist Johann Böhm (1895–1952) who carried out X-ray studies of aluminium oxide hydroxides in 1925 (and not for the German geologist Johannes Böhm (1857–1938) as often stated).

<doc id="1089261" wikidata="Q942249" url="?curid=1089261" title="Freddie Welsh">
<text>Freddie Welsh (born Frederick Hall Thomas; 5 March 1886 – 29 July 1927) was a Welsh World boxing champion. The lightweight boxer was born in Pontypridd, Wales, nicknamed the &quot;Welsh Wizard&quot;. Brought up in a tough mining community, Welsh left a working-class background to make a name for himself in America. He turned professional as a boxer in Philadelphia in 1905, and spent the best part of his career fighting in the United States.

Welsh spent much of his career chasing the world championship title, held in turn by Battling Nelson, Ad Wolgast and Willie Ritchie, failing through a series of events to meet each until a successful encounter with Ritchie in July 1914, when he finally became world lightweight champion. Welsh held the title until 1917 when he lost to Benny Leonard, though he continued to fight sparingly until 1922. During his career, he fought in more than 160 professional bouts, suffering defeat on just 5 occasions.

A keen follower of Bernarr Macfadden&#x27;s physical culture, Welsh believed in exercise and healthy living and was a non-smoker and a vegetarian. In the years following the end of his career, bad business choices cost him his fortune, and after numerous health problems he died in poverty in 1927.

==Boxing career==

===Early life and amateur career===
Freddie Welsh was born in Pontypridd on 5 March 1886, to John Thomas and his wife Elizabeth Thomas (née Hall). In the late 19th century, Pontypridd was a growing coal mining town, which attracted not only those wishing to make a living in the mines, but also middle-class professionals who saw an opportunity to make a living in a thriving community. Welsh&#x27;s father was one such commercial immigrant, setting up a business on Taff Street as an auctioneer. Welsh&#x27;s parents moved into 17 Morgan Street in the town, where Welsh was born. He had two younger siblings, a brother, Arthur Stanley and a sister, Edith Kate. Unlike most boxers of the period, Welsh had a privileged upbringing, at the age of four he attended Mr Mclune&#x27;s Grammar School in Pontypridd and was privately educated at Long Ashton College in Clifton, Bristol. A few months after Welsh was born, his mother persuaded her husband to buy the Bridge Inn Hotel on Berw Road, and the family moved there. Welsh&#x27;s mother was the daughter of a hotelier from Merthyr, and the Bridge Inn was her responsibility, as John Thomas was often away from home. When Welsh was ten, his father died. His mother, faced with running the hotel alone, sent Kate and Stanley to an aunt in Merthyr, while Welsh was sent to his maternal grandfather in Radyr. After a year, suffering from homesickness, Welsh returned home to Pontypridd. His mother later remarried, to Richard Williams, an innkeeper from Aberdare.

When Welsh left school at the age of 14, he took up work as a boilerman (the 1901 census, when he was 15, has him recorded as an apprentice mechanical engineer) finding work with Llewellyn &amp; Cubbitt of Pentre, Rhondda. At the age of 16 he and three friends decided to find a new life in Canada. They set sail from Liverpool to Vancouver arriving in January 1903, but although his companions were able to find work, Welsh struggled to hold down any steady jobs. It was in Canada that he took a serious interest in bodybuilding and became a firm advocate of Bernarr Macfadden&#x27;s &quot;physical culture&quot; regime. After a year Welsh was again homesick and borrowed enough money to return to Britain, but with only $10 he was forced to travel as a worker on a cattle-boat.

With his newfound physical fitness he entered the boxing ring undertaking amateur fights in Scotland, far away from Wales to prevent his mother discovering his passion for fighting. After twelve months he raised the money needed to return to the America, travelling to New York on the &quot;Baltic&quot; on her maiden voyage on 29 June 1904.

Welsh failed to find steady work in the States, and although his mother thought he was earning a regular wage and living comfortably, Welsh was actually taking any casual work that was offered him. Initially he rode the rails to the Dakotas to labour in the farm fields, before heading to New York City working long hours as a dishwasher or banner bearer. When Welsh was mugged while sleeping at a cheap hotel, he was given a job as a porter by the sympathetic hotel manager.

His first job in New York was as a boxing instructor in one of Bernarr Macfadden institutes. He was allowed to sleep in the gym, was given all his meals, plus $1 salary a day. It was as an instructor he first met his future wife, Brahna Weinstein, a Jewish Russian girl who anglicised her name to Fanny Weston when her family moved to the East Side.

He then successfully applied to an advertisement for a &quot;smart, active young man who can box&quot; at a down town gym, Knipe&#x27;s Institute. Welsh subsidised his work as a trainer, as a boxing instructor and training director at Brown&#x27;s Gymnasium. When hard times hit the gym, he was put on half time subsidising his earnings as a snow shoveller in Harlem. Welsh then found work at a well-known New York gymnasium for $8 a day, the wage barely paid his meals but he took the job to learn the boxing profession.

Despite going days without eating, and having to sleep on the wrestling mats at the gym, he refused to turn professional, partially to preserve his amateur status and he also did not want his mother to discover he was earning a living as a boxer. When friends who knew him from his gym work, and seeing him struggle to pay for a decent meal, asked why he didn&#x27;t take up the nightly paid &#x27;private&#x27; fights, Welsh initially refused. Despite his misgivings, the next day Welsh took up the offer and knocked out Kid Allen in a third round bout. This was followed with wins over Johnny Mezier, Young Peterson and Jack Cameron. With his financial issues resolved and being able to pay for steady meals, at the age of 19, Welsh decided to turn professional.

===Early professional career, 1905–1906===
Still with dreams of becoming a culture expert, he moved to Philadelphia to become an instructor at Herman&#x27;s Institute, while Fanny stayed in New York to finish her studies. Before his first professional fight, Welsh decided to change his name, fearing he may fail and that his mother would find out he was boxing. He first chose Fred Cymry, Cymry meaning Welsh, but on writing to Fanny, she suggested that &#x27;Welsh&#x27; would be less confusing. Welsh took Jack Clancy on as his American manager, and on 21 December 1905 he experienced his first professional bout. His first opponent was Young Williams, and the two novices fought at the Broadway Athletic Club of Philadelphia. Welsh won by knockout in the third round, and was booked to return to the club for his second fight in January. He went six rounds with Johnny Keely on 25 January, with a &#x27;no-decision&#x27; verdict, the standard practice in Philadelphia for full-distance fights at the time, given to the fight. His next match saw him stop Eddie Fay in the sixth, and with this promising start to his career, the Broadway Athletic Club lined up a more challenging opponent, journeyman Tommy Feltz. The fight went all six rounds, and although Feltz was past his best, he was expected to win the bout; so the result, given to Welsh by the &quot;Philadelphia Item&quot;, was seen as an upset. From that fight, Welsh started to take more frequent matches, sometimes accepting two bouts a week to build up his experience and stamina. In March 1906, he faced four opponents, defeating Tommy Love and Kid Stinger (both &#x27;no-decision&#x27;, but given by the &quot;Philadelphia Item&quot;) and then a points win over Eddie Lenny, followed by a draw with Johnny Dohan. The Lenny result was the first of eight bouts to which the &quot;Philadelphia Item&quot; failed to give Welsh a victory, though seven of them were &#x27;no-decision&#x27; verdicts on the night. The seven matches after Dohan were Billy Maharg, who took the fight decisively on points, then Frank Carsey, followed by three experienced fighters, Jimmy Devine, Tommy Love and Matty Baldwin; the last two opponents on this losing streak were Philadelphians Billy Willis and Tim Callahan.

On 12 May, two days after the Callahan encounter, he faced Jack Reardon, another &#x27;no-decision&#x27; match, though on this occasion Welsh was given the bout by the press. This was followed by a win over Kid Gleason, and a second-round stoppage of Mike Loughlin. The 15 June saw a rematch with Chicago native Frank Carsey, which after the full six rounds it was again declared a &#x27;no-decision&#x27;, but with the press siding with Carsey. Carsey and Welsh would later become close friends over the years, with Carsey becoming his sparring partner, and was part of Welsh&#x27;s corner team during his big fights.

Welsh finished June with a gruelling win over Billy Glover, before facing Young Erne, an intelligent boxer from Philadelphia. The match against Young Erne quickly turned into a slugging contest with both men forgetting their defensive strategies for an all-out attacking contest. The crowd were well entertained in a six-round bout, which the press gave to Welsh. The next contest was to be his first twenty-round match and his first professional fight outside Philadelphia, in Dayton, Ohio, against Australian lightweight champion Hock Keys. Welsh injured his favoured right hand in the sixth round, forcing him to box left-handed for the next eleven rounds, and won the match by technical knockout after downing Keys twice in the sixteenth round, and again in the seventeenth.

After the defeat of Hock Keys, Welsh took a month break, partly due to a failed show by Tim Callahan. He faced Jimmy Dunn on 31 August, in a six-round bout that went all the way, the press favouring Dunn. Welsh took another extended break, and when he returned to the ring, both he and Dunn agreed to another encounter, this time a twenty-round match at Dayton. The contest went the distance, with the referee declaring the match a draw, which enraged the crowd.

He fought twice more in America before the end of the year, both six-round results given to Welsh by the press: against Willie Moody on 23 November and then Kid Gleeson in December. Welsh now had a fine record behind him, but a few days after the Gleeson fight, he received news from Wales that his mother was seriously ill, and with Fanny still in New York, he returned to Britain on the &quot;Etruria&quot;.

===First British fights, 1907===
When Welsh returned to Britain, he was still an unknown, even in boxing circles. Despite his mother&#x27;s illness Welsh arranged boxing matches in Britain, his first was against Seaman Arthur Hayes, a six-round match held at the National Sporting Club (NSC) in London. Welsh took the contest on points and followed this up with another points victory at the NSC, this time a 15-round bout against Young Joseph. To this point, Welsh had never fought in his home country, and to introduce himself to a Welsh audience, a display was arranged at the Park Gymnastic Club in Pontypridd on 17 April 1907. No opponent of sufficient calibre was available to fight, so he took on three local boxers. All three men lasted no more than three rounds.

On 21 May, Welsh took part in a fight against Johnny Owens of Aberaman, unofficial lightweight champion of Wales. The contest was for a purse of £50 and the Welsh lightweight title, though as a spectacle the match was a disappointment, with Welsh in complete control of the bout from the second round. After a two-month break, Welsh&#x27;s next fight was a win over Sid Russell of Cheltenham on 18 July; and the next day appeared at an exhibition bout at Pontypridd, where he sparred with Jim Driscoll a fighter who would play a prominent part in Welsh&#x27;s boxing career. After a win over Young Lilly in August, he followed this with a victory over former amateur featherweight champion, Dick Lee. A few days later at the St. Mary Hill Fair at Pencoed in Wales, Welsh and Driscoll fought in their first recorded match. Driscoll was working for the Frank Guess Boxing Booth at the fair, when Welsh accepted the barker&#x27;s offer of £1 if he could last six rounds with Driscoll. In Welsh&#x27;s previous fight Driscoll had been part of Welsh&#x27;s corner, so it came as some surprise to Driscoll when his friend was over enthusiastic in the challenge, attacking him with kidney and rabbit punches. Driscoll never forgave Welsh for taking such liberties.

After winning a rematch against Seaman Hayes on 7 September, Welsh was invited to a private fight arranged by local industrialists for a fee of £100 plus a large purse. Some individuals had felt that Welsh had embraced America too much, and had undertaken too many &#x27;Yankee&#x27; mannerisms, forgetting his home country. The fight was arranged to test Welsh, and they chose Joe White, a Swiss-Canadian who had also learnt his boxing art in the United States, but was now living in Cardiff. The fight took place in a converted loft in front of a select crowd of about sixty, who were balloted to gain their tickets. The fight went to sixteen rounds before White, who had suffered since the eleventh, threw in the towel.

Welsh&#x27;s final fight in Britain until 1910, took place in Pontypridd on 3 October, when he faced two opponents on the same night. He stopped both in five rounds, first beating Gunnar Hart, the welterweight champion of the Royal Navy; then Arthur Ellis. Welsh never fought competitively in Pontypridd again. On 4 October, Welsh left for America, catching the train to Liverpool before taking the Lusitania to New York.

An insight into Welsh&#x27;s personality was recorded in a legal case he raised which was concluded after he had left for the States. Welsh took the case against one of the three boys he travelled to Canada with in 1902, claiming that he had given the defendant, David Davies, £8 for the cost of the trip. Davies denied having received the money, and knew nothing of the claim until meeting Welsh in Taff Street in June, who then threatened to &#x27;knock him through a window if he didn&#x27;t pay the money&#x27;. After testimonies from the other two emigrants who travelled with Davies and Welsh, the judge found in favour of Welsh.

===Return to America and first international belt, 1907–1909===
On arrival in the United States, Welsh met Fanny in New York and the two of them travelled to Philadelphia. On 2 November 1907, Welsh faced Cyclone Johnny Thompson at the National Athletic Club in the city. The six-round encounter ended in a &#x27;no-decision&#x27; given by the press to Welsh. A similar result was given in the contest against a poor Boxer Kelly, before he faced Willie Fitzgerald at Spring Garden Athletic Club; another six-round bout given as a draw. Welsh then experienced his first American fight outside Pennsylvania when a bout was arranged between him and Dave Deshler at the Winnisemmet Club in Chelsea, Massachusetts. The ten-round bout went the distance, with Welsh victorious by points decision, and he was congratulated by Theodore Roosevelt Jr. at the end of the match.

Welsh went on to beat Eddie Carter in Philadelphia on Christmas Day 1907, Kid Locke on 2 January and then Maurice Sayers at the Milwaukee Boxing Club. He then faced local Milwaukee boxer Charley Neary in a ten-round match, the decision going to the referee Al Bright, who called the encounter a draw. This was followed by a fight against Chicago boxer Packey McFarland, regarded as one of the greatest lightweight boxers in history, which McFarland won on points. The contest caused controversy after Welsh was floored in the fourth round following what is believed to be a low shot. The referee failed to see the offending blow, and the match continued. When the points decision was announced there was jeering from the crowd, and accusations of favouritism were made, as referee Malachy Hogan was a Chicago man and had previously favoured Chicago fighters.

With fan frustration after the McFarland match, a rematch was arranged for 4 July, with Welsh facing just one opponent in the four and a half months between the bouts, Phil Brock. Welsh was meant to fight Dick Hyland, but blood poisoning to the Welshman&#x27;s hand meant the Hyland fight did not take place. The Brock encounter, held at Vernon, California, was Welsh&#x27;s first 25-round bout and ended in a terribly one-sided victory with a plucky Brock losing on points.

The rematch with McFarland was set for 4 July, Independence Day, to coincide with the world lightweight title fight between champion Joe Gans and Battling Nelson held in California. The Welsh-McFarland fight was gaining much press attention, and this increased after fight promoter and owner of the Jeffries Arena, Jim Jeffries, had offered Gans a $20,000 purse to face the winner of the bout in August. Betting was heavy for the match, and was to be refereed by Jeffries himself. Fought over 25 rounds, Welsh had the upper hand for the first nineteen, but after an announcement was made that Nelson had won in California, Welsh&#x27;s game slipped with McFarland taking control. In the final two rounds Welsh took a heavy beating and was knocked down to the canvas in the last round. At the end of the encounter the decision from the referee was a draw. McFarland took the result badly and launched into a vicious tirade of abuse towards Jeffries, though Welsh too thought he had done enough to win in the first two-thirds of the fight and sent a cablegram to Wales stating such.

After the McFarland draw, for the first time the American press began questioning Welsh&#x27;s credentials as a champion contender, mainly due to his inability to finish off his opponent due to a lack of punching power. Welsh was hurt by the remarks that he was a &#x27;snowflake puncher&#x27;, and used his next three fights to prove his critics wrong. Johnny Murphy went the full twenty-five rounds but suffered a terrible beating, Frank Carsey was knocked out in round four, lying unconscious for five minutes; while Harry Trendall was laid out in the sixth.

Although Welsh was chasing Nelson for a title shot, Nelson took an eight-month sabbatical after winning his rematch in September over Gans. Around this time, Welsh received a promise of a fight from fellow Brit Johnny Summers for the European title, but the major challenger in California was Abe Attell, the featherweight champion of the world since 1906. Attell had run out of opponents, so after much advertising of the match, the two men met on 25 November 1911. Although Attell&#x27;s boxing weight was half a stone lighter than Welsh&#x27;s on the night, both men weighed in at . Under stormy weather conditions, Welsh won by points in a fifteen-round match, with one newspaper reporting that although Attell did not lose his featherweight title, he did &quot;lose the title that he has held for years, that being the cleverest man in the game&quot;.

Welsh followed up the Attell fight with a narrow victory over George Memsic in Los Angeles, before heading to New Orleans to take a points victory over Young Erne and then a knock-out win over Ray Bronson. Shortly after the Bronson fight, Welsh learned that Nelson had no intention of facing him, deciding to face three more opponents before retiring; none of these talks included Welsh. Welsh carried on fighting, with one final match in New Orleans against Young Donahue. It was an acrimonious affair before the bout started, and when Welsh rejected the referee before the match began, another referee was found, but was told to call a draw if no clear winner was apparent. When the fight reached its ten-round conclusion, the referee called a draw, much to Welsh&#x27;s annoyance.

Welsh and Fanny headed East to New York, and on 7 May he made his New York debut against Johnny Frayne. The match went the full ten rounds, with the press giving Welsh the decision with a lukewarm report, comparing him unfavourably against Jim Driscoll. Welsh finished off his tour of America with far more convincing displays over Jack Goodman and Phil Brock. With his sights now on the Lonsdale Belt, Welsh travelled back to Britain.

On his arrival at Cardiff on 19 June he was greeted by a throng of admirers; one of the first to greet him was Jim Driscoll. Cars had been arranged to take Welsh through Pontypridd, and he asked Driscoll to join him on the journey. Despite Pontypridd having a population of 32,000 at the time, reports were made that 80,000 people lined the streets to see their hero&#x27;s arrival.

Welsh began his British return with an encounter with Young Joseph at the Pavilion in Mountain Ash, a 20-round match which only reached the eleventh after Young was disqualified for two low punches. Just over a month later, Welsh was back fighting in Mountain Ash, to face little known French lightweight Henri Piet. The press were unimpressed with the choice of opponent, but Piet gave a good account for himself before retiring in the twelfth. After Piet, Welsh faced Joe Fletcher from England; it was a terribly mismatched affair which resulted in negative press reports towards Welsh&#x27;s choice of opponents. In truth there were very few fighters of a sufficient calibre to test Welsh in Britain, but on 8 November, Welsh got his chance to face Johnny Summers, for the British and European lightweight championship.

The Summers fight took part at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, with a purse of £2,200 and the Lonsdale Belt at stake. Welsh took control in the first round and never let Summers into the fight. One reporter counted 200 successful blows to Summers head during the match, and he was bleeding as early as the third round. During the fight, some members of the crowd jeered Welsh&#x27;s use of the kidney punch, which although not outlawed at the time was seen as unsporting; he was also cautioned by the referee for the use of his head in the fifth. The fight went the distance, with Welsh winning on points; in taking the Lonsdale Belt he was the pride of Wales and America, but many in the boxing fraternity of England saw in Welsh a cynical, cold and cruel fighter.

===McFarland, Driscoll and Wells, 1910–1911===
Welsh took a break away from boxing after winning the Lonsdale Belt, earning good money making theatrical appearances at music halls in London, but a chance meeting with Packy McFarland led to a match being arranged between them. Welsh warmed up for the bout with a win over Jack Daniels, before facing McFarland for the third time, now on British soil at Covent Garden. The match was billed as the &quot;Light-weight Championship of the World&quot;, but that title was now held by Ad Wolgast who had beaten Battling Nelson in a shock win in February. McFarland started the fight well, and most reporters gave him the first nine rounds, after that Welsh took most of the rounds, though in the eyes of the British press he failed to claw back the advantage McFarland had opened up in the early rounds. Although the result after twenty rounds was a draw, the British newspapers reported that McFarland had been robbed of a victory.

In the summer of 1910, Welsh was finding it difficult to find a fight. Wolgast was pricing himself out of the market, McFarland could not reach the weight and the National Sporting Centre could not find a credible contender to challenge for the Lonsdale Belt. Jim Driscoll, who had earlier won the flyweight Lonsdale Belt, was in a similar situation and a highly anticipated match was arranged between them. Two uninspiring fights were arranged before the Driscoll encounter in December, a sixth round win over middleweight Joe Heathcote and then a ninth round stoppage over Dick Bailey. A long build up to the game caused the relationship between Welsh and Driscoll to sour, and when they met to sign the contracts, an argument broke out between the two men over the choice of referee. Driscoll lost his temper with Welsh, became verbally abusive and stormed out of the meeting.

The fight took place on 20 December 1910 at the American Skating Ring in Cardiff, in front of a crowd of 10,000. Welsh started well, surprising the crowd with a straight back stance, out-jabbing Driscoll, but in the fifth he reverted to his normal crouched stance. Welsh&#x27;s tactics changed and was now using his kidney punch on his opponent, amidst cries of &quot;foul&quot; from the crowd. He also tried to get in close to Driscoll, holding with one arm and delivering body blows with the other, which saw Driscoll adopt a similar tactic. By the eighth round Driscoll was coming into the match, and forced the fighting in the ninth. In the tenth round, Driscoll, becoming irritated at Welsh&#x27;s clinches and illegal use of his shoulder, rushed Welsh and head butted him on the chin. It was an obvious foul, the referee, Arthur Frederick Bettinson, quickly entered the ring and disqualified Driscoll. The end of the fight was mired further when men from each of the boxers&#x27; corners began arguing before coming to blows, which saw the police entering the ring.

In early 1911, Welsh was about to set off for the United States when Matt Wells, a little-known British boxer who had recently turned professional, challenged him for his title. Welsh accepted, but was unprepared for Wells, who had been studying Welsh for the last eighteen months. On 27 February 1911 Welsh entered the ring at Covent Garden to little cheer, with the crowd supporting Wells the underdog. Wells&#x27; tactics were finely executed and he built up a healthy lead by attacking Welsh from the first round, he then spent the second half of the match defending his body and his lead. When the twenty rounds were up, Wells was given the decision and the championship title. Welsh departed for America on 11 March 1911, no longer a champion.

===Reclaiming the British lightweight title 1911–1913===

Welsh&#x27;s time in Britain had damaged his credibility in America, so he set out to make amends. An easy victory over Pal Moore in March was followed by a trip to California to face Matty Baldwin in San Francisco. Welsh won the Baldwin fight on points in a performance that was considered an excellent display of boxing. On 4 August 1911, after weeks of negotiation, it was announced that Wolgast would face Welsh on 30 November, Welsh&#x27;s first attempt at the world title. The buildup was intense and both camps attempted to use the media to their advantage. Just days before the match, with tickets in high demand, the man named in the fight articles as the referee, Eddie Smith, died. This led to arguments between Welsh and Tom &#x27;Ten per cent&#x27; Jones, Wolgast&#x27;s manager, as both tried to get the most favourable replacement referee. When Jones and Welsh met each other by chance on Windward Avenue in Venice, California, the men came to a heated argument with Jones threatening that he would &#x27;knock his [Welsh] block off&#x27;. A few days later, realising that he was in the weaker position as the challenger, Welsh accepted Jones&#x27; choice of referee, Jack Welch. On the eve of the big encounter, news reached Welsh that Wolgast had been taken to hospital with acute appendicitis and would be unable to fight for three months. Walgast&#x27;s last-minute replacement Willie Ritchie took Welsh the full twenty rounds, and although he failed to beat the Welshman, the fight had many fans contemplating how Welsh would have fared against the champion.

In January 1912, Welsh dislocated his neck in a bout of wrestling. He was now unable to box and running low on money after living beyond his means. He left San Francisco in March, travelling to Canada where he took in an exhibition bout with Jack O&#x27;Brien, before heading to Chicago where he and Fanny stayed for two months. Welsh then decided to head to New York as to take in some six-round matches to earn some money. On the way through Buffalo he fought Jimmy Duffy, although about half a stone overweight, Welsh was given the bout by the press, and was at least making money again. While in Buffalo, Welsh visited his friend Elbert Hubbard and after long philosophical discussions, he returned to boxing with a new purpose, intent on regaining his British title. He fought three more times in America before he returned to Britain, two draws against Grover Hayes and a press decision over Phil Knight.

In September 1912, Welsh travelled back to Britain on the &quot;Mauritania&quot;. A rematch was planned with Wells for 11 November, and Welsh warmed up with a points win over Jack Langdon in Liverpool. Almost three weeks later he faced Wells at Covent Garden for a second time, but now as challenger. Wells took the first four rounds, but in the sixth round, Welsh landed a combination of punishing blows which slowed the champion down. By the tenth round the match was level, and as the match progressed Welsh took charge. At the end of the 20 round bout Welsh was declared European and British champion.

Just before his next fight, news came from America that Willie Ritchie had taken the world title from Wolgast, strengthening Welsh&#x27;s case for a championship shot. Before he could return a British Empire title fight had been arranged against Australian Hughie Mehegan. The encounter went the full 20 rounds, and although Welsh won on points he took a severe beating, complaining he found it difficult to sleep from the pain three or four days after the fight.

In early January 1913, Welsh&#x27;s mother, who had been ill for some time, died. He gave up his immediate plans to chase Willie Ritchie and stayed in Wales for a while to be near his family. He fought four more fights in Britain, beginning with a home contest in Aberdare against Frenchman Paul Brevieres, who was stopped in the third. Then he took a points win over Young Nipper, a successful defence of his European title against Raymond Vittet, finishing with a points win over Eddie Beattie. The three final fights were conducted within seven days, and Welsh almost paid the price for such a challenging schedule when Beattie knocked him down for nine seconds in the ninth.

===World title bid 1913–1914===

When Welsh returned to America he was intent on fighting Ritchie, having failed to meet both Nelson and Wolgast. He employed the services of Harry Pollok, one of New York&#x27;s most flamboyant sports impresarios. When Welsh and Fanny arrived in New York on 29 March 1913, Pollok was there orchestrating the reporters and photographers. Even with Pollack&#x27;s help Ritchie was difficult to commit. Champions tended to stick to the East Coast, fighting in six round contests where the &#x27;no-decision&#x27; contests meant the only way the title could be lost would be through a knockout. When Welsh arrived in New York, Billy Dolan, Ritchie&#x27;s manager, announced that the champion would not be fighting for four months as he was touring Europe to fulfil theatrical commitments.

In preparation of a possible title bid on Ritchie&#x27;s return, Welsh started his build up on 28 April by going the distance with Al Ketchell in Bridgeport. He then headed north to Canada to take the press decisions over Jack Redmond on 16 May and Kid Scaler on 24 May. These fights were followed by bouts against Billy Farrell in Moose Jaw, Ray Campbell and Young Jack O&#x27;Brien in Vancouver and then Martin Murphy in Fernie, British Columbia. In early July Welsh broke off his Canadian tour to watch Ritchie&#x27;s return to the ring. It was an unimpressive display over &#x27;Mexican&#x27; Joe Rivers, saved only by a knockout in the eleventh. During this period, to insure his name stayed in the papers, Welsh revealed that he and Fanny Weston had actually been married since 1905, a secret kept from all but the closest family members. This was followed by a stunt to break the Canadian land speed record over a mile. Welsh sat in with &#x27;Speed King&#x27; Bob Burman when he broke the record in 50.8 seconds in his Blitzen Benz.

Eventually a fight was arranged between Welsh and Ritchie to be fought in Vancouver on 4 September 1913, but when Welsh turned on his ankle in training the date was forced back to the 20th. Worse was to follow when the evening before the fight Ritchie left Vancouver, later citing unhappiness over the filming rights of the fight. Around the same time, a gold belt awarded to Welsh after he won the Commonwealth encounter with Mehegan, was stolen while on display at a tea room near his training quarters. The belt was recovered when an Australian, named Henry Beckett, was caught trying to smuggle it out of the country.

Welsh responded to his bad luck by throwing himself back into competitive fighting. With three months of the year left, he arranged five fights. The first two contests, in Montana, against Fighting Dick Hyland and Leo Kossick were won on points decisions. These was followed with a match against Milburn Saylor who was disqualified in the ninth for a low blow. He faced Phil Bloom in New York, the press decision favouring Welsh, before he returned to Canada for a knockout win over Canadian Champion Arthur Ellis. Back in the United States, Welsh, although struggling with his weight was able to best Johnny Dundee in New Orleans, followed by a points victory over Frank Whitney in Atlanta. Welsh continued his journey east, stopping at Philadelphia for a match against Sam Robideau. This would be his third win in three different cities in just ten days. Five days later on 15 January 1914 in Kansas City he faced Mickey Sheridan of Chicago, who underwent &quot;thirty minutes of torture and considerable humiliation&quot; in an easy points decision for Welsh. He faced two more opponents in January, Earl Fisher in Cincinnati on the 26th followed by Leo Kelly in Saint Louis on the 29th, both were press decisions for Welsh. With his weight now coming down and his bank account swelled, Welsh and Pollok refocused on Ritchie. The American sportswriters were calling Welsh a &#x27;has-been&#x27;, so the two men devised a new strategy, if they could not get Ritchie to agree to a bout, they would beat as many of Ritchie&#x27;s credible contenders until he could no longer ignore Welsh.

The first target on his list was Mexican Joe Rivers, who had already had two failed attempts at the lightweight title. On his build-up to the match, Welsh suffered his first defeat since 1911, when Jimmy Duffy took the press decision over eight rounds in Saint Louis. Undeterred he continued his preparation for the contest with Rivers on 17 March in Vernon. Rivers started as favourite, but his inexperience showed and Welsh dominated the entire fight winning on points. After the fight, at a celebratory dinner, Welsh was shown a newspaper reporting King George V&#x27;s enthusiasm for boxing. Welsh wrote to His Majesty thanking him for his support, the next day he received a royal response by telegram. Nearly every major newspaper in the United States and the United Kingdom printed the correspondence in full, giving Welsh much needed column space.

In the spring of 1914, Welsh contacted Ritchie and asked him if he would face him in England, providing he got a satisfactory guarantee of money. Ritchie agreed that he would fight for the right money. Welsh cabled the Olympia Theatre, London, and began booking advertising space. When Ritchie finally stated that he wanted $50,000, win lose or draw, Welsh said the price &quot;would make a horse laugh&quot;, and was double what he was expecting. Despite this huge fee, England was desperate for a world champion and $40,000 was raised on the stipulation that Ritchie fought no other bouts in the meantime. Ritchie accepted the $40,000 but stated a fight was already planned and he would fight who he liked. The London syndicate relented to his demands. Before Ritchie&#x27;s arranged fight with Charley White, Welsh took in two more encounters, beating Leach Cross on points and then Joe Mandot on press decision. All attention then switched to the White-Ritchie fight in Milwaukee. In almost the first punch that White connected with, Ritchie was in trouble. Staggered, Ritchie was laid open to a battering, but stayed on his feet until the end of the fight. White was declared winner, but as he had failed to stop Ritchie before the end of the match, he kept his world title. Pollok and Welsh then took a major gamble. They sent a telegram to Ritchie with the message, &#x27;Promoters have called off match with you. Want us to meet White.&#x27;, a bluff to force the Champion&#x27;s hand. The following day Ritchie accepted a fee for $25,000 and $1,500 expenses to meet Welsh in London. The White fight had cost Ritchie almost $15,000.

Welsh and Pollok set off for Britain on the &quot;Imperator&quot;, and on his arrival on 12 June, he told reporters that he had received news from Fanny of the birth of his first child, Elizabeth. The fight took place on 7 July, and from the first round Welsh took control. It wasn&#x27;t until the sixth when Ritchie caught Welsh on the jaw that he took a round. Welsh played defensive, but landed with jabbing blows to the head, while Ritchie kept looking for the massive knockout punch that would win the match. In the seventeenth round Ritchie was forced to up his game to find a winning punch, but failed to make significant contact before the end of the bout. Welsh was declared winner and lightweight boxing champion of the world, with the consensus around the ring that Welsh took ten rounds, Ritchie five and five were even. After the fight the new champion retired to The Waldorf Hilton, London, to see his daughter for the first time.

===Championship years and World War I===

Just 25 days after becoming lightweight champion, Germany declared war on Russia, and the Great War began. His expected payout touring theatres was curtailed and he lost more than $50,000 in music hall engagements alone. Thanks to a manager of the White Star Line, he, Fanny and Elizabeth obtained first class passage to America on the &quot;Olympic&quot;. In some sections of the sporting press he was accused of cowardice for not joining the British Army. Welsh countered that he undertook numerous engagements to rally support for troops and stated &quot;I can do far more for my country out of the trenches than in them.&quot;

In 1914 only two U.S. states allowed twenty round championship bouts to a verdict, Colorado and Louisiana, and no promoters in either state were offering large enough purses to risk losing the championship title for. To earn as much money as he could from being the champion, Welsh fought in as many ten round &#x27;no verdict&#x27; matches as he could. As long as he was on his feet at the end of the ten rounds, he could not lose his title. Still, Welsh wanted to show he was not going to choose soft opposition and began a series of bouts against serious contenders. His first defence was against Matty Baldwin on 27 October in Boston, a match he won on points. This was followed six days later by a contest against Al Wolgast, the former champion who had avoided Welsh when he had the title to lose. The fight was a near sell out at Madison Square Garden in New York, with the crowd firmly behind Wolgast. Although the first few rounds were fairly even between the two fighters, at the end of the fifth round Wolgast blocked an uppercut with his right arm. The blow broke his ulna three inches (76 mm) above the wrist, forcing Wolgast to box on with just his left hand. Wolgast kept on fighting but could not continue after the eighth.

A week later Welsh faced Charley White, the man most sports-writers believed was the natural contender for the lightweight title. The ten round bout, held in Milwaukee, was a one-sided affair with Welsh landing four times as many punches as White. Despite White having the stronger punch, it was not until the tenth that he managed to draw blood, and many writers failed to give him even one round.

Welsh was expected to retire in 1915, with Harry Pollok stating that he planned to fight on four more occasions before leaving the sport. However, he continued fighting and retained the title until May 1917, when he was knocked out at the Manhattan Athletic Club by Benny Leonard, the first time in his career that he had been stopped. Leonard was deemed to have controlled the fight. After being floored in the ninth round, Welsh had risen back to his feet and absorbed even more blows before the referee called a halt to the bout.

==Later life==
Welsh retired from boxing after a defeat by Archie Walker in 1922, but retired as a wealthy man. Before he lost to Leonard in 1917, Welsh bought a farm on Long Hill in Chatham Township, New Jersey. The farm was set in and Welsh spent thousands of dollars on improvements, installing a gymnasium, a state of the art kitchen, golf course, tennis courts and a swimming pool. His idea was to turn it into a health spa, and on 11 August 1917 a host of celebrities and dignitaries were invited to its opening. One of the guests, Bat Masterson, described Long Hill as a &#x27;palatial home sitting high upon a hill, like an acropolis&#x27;.

Welsh found Long Hill a poor distraction and thought of joining the British forces, but was persuaded out of the idea by Fanny. Instead he joined the United States Army, serving as a lieutenant and was consigned to the Walter Reed Hospital where he helped rehabilitate disabled veterans.

In 1918 Welsh was struggling with Long Hill and decided he wanted rid of it. Welsh had spent $150,000 on Long Hill, his entire life&#x27;s earnings, and he placed it on the market for $20,000 cash as his business was close to collapse. He was still unable to find a buyer. Welsh&#x27;s dream was to earn and run a health farm, held since his first days in America; now with his dream in tatters his life began to disintegrate. On 11 October 1919, Welsh was the only diner in a restaurant on 50th and Broadway, when by coincidence Harry Pollok walked in. The men became violent, and a fight ensued which ended with Pollok being rushed to the Polyclinic Hospital with half his right ear in an ice bucket. Pollok swore out a warrant against Welsh who was arrested upon complaint that he had bitten his former manager&#x27;s ear in half. Welsh denied the charges and after Pollok failed to appear to press the charge for a third time, the case was dismissed.

In 1920 he was discharged from his duties at Walter Reed Hospital having reached the rank of captain. He returned to Long Hill, and with his money dwindling made the decision to return to the ring. After six months of preparation he faced &#x27;Kid&#x27; Green on 28 December 1920. Despite the three-and-a-half-year absence from the ring, Welsh was in good shape and took only four rounds to beat Green; though he had switched his trademark defensive boxing to a heavier brawling style. Welsh then fought twice in May 1921, against Willie Jackson and Kid Murphy, both wins; but the most notable event regarding the bouts was the appearance of heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, who was spending time relaxing at Welsh&#x27;s health farm. After two more fights in 1921, both in Canada, Welsh returned to New York to face Archie Walker in April 1922. The fight was a sporting disaster for Welsh, losing seven of the ten rounds, and by the tenth he was being chased around the ring as he covered himself up. It was a pitiful display and Welsh never stepped into a professional ring again.

By 1923, during Prohibition, Long Hill was attracting more guests for its supply of home-brewed ciders and beers than its sporting facilities. While in 1924, through their mutual acquaintance of Ring Lardner, F. Scott Fitzgerald turned up at the farm and sparred three rounds with Welsh. In 1924, Welsh was back in court, after he was involved in a car collision caused by him driving his vehicle on the wrong side of the road. Welsh began looking for other ventures to take him away from the health farm, and in 1925 he rejoined the US Army, becoming a boxing instructor at the Plattsburg Barracks in upstate New York. While in the forces he placed an advertisement for a manager to run Long Hill, which was accepted by neighbour and friend, Sidky Bey, and his wife Hranoush, known as Madame Bey. With strict curfew hours and a no-alcohol policy, Madame Bey made the farm a success, and Long Hill became an important training venue for New York boxers. But her tenure at the farm ended acrimoniously, over an argument with boxer Battling Siki, who Welsh believed to be a bad influence. After discussing the matter with other boxers, Madame Bey left Long Hill and set up her own rival venue. With Welsh in the Army and Madame Bey gone, the farm fell into disrepair. Bey later recalled Welsh fondly, stating that he was a man who enjoyed having a good time, but was a terrible businessman.

In 1927, with Welsh unable to raise the capital to pay the mortgage on his Long Hill estate, the farm was sold to satisfy a mortgage of $30,000 even though it was valued at $150,000. With Long Hill lost, Fanny and Welsh separated, Fanny taking a job as a live-in housekeeper at the St Paul&#x27;s Hotel on 60th Street, New York, a venue where she and Welsh once lived in a suite of apartments. Soon after, Welsh&#x27;s health began to deteriorate and he began complaining of severe chest pains. His doctor reported that Welsh was depressed and was drinking too much. On 17 July 1927 Welsh appeared at the West Side Court in New York City, sporting a black-eye suffered in a street brawl. He faced a charge of disorderly conduct, after he came off worse in a drunken encounter with Edward Delaney of New York. The patrolman who saved Welsh from a serious beating assured the magistrate that it was a friendly fight and the charges were dismissed against both men.

On 28 July 1927 a maid at Hotel Sidney, discovered Welsh laid face downward in his pyjamas and bathrobe. He had died in the night. A doctor was called who opined that Welsh had died of a heart attack. On 13 October 1927, Welsh&#x27;s old health farm was destroyed in a fire.

==Legacy==
Freddie Welsh was inducted into the &#x27;Ring Boxing Hall of Fame&#x27; in 1960, the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame in 1994 and the &#x27;International Boxing Hall of Fame&#x27; in 1997.

In 2008, Welsh was celebrated by Rhondda Cynon Taf council when it was decided to raise a blue plaque at his former boxing club to commemorate his life. The plaque was unveiled by Welsh boxer Dai Dower the following year.

===Record===
During the time Welsh boxed, scoring resulted in a large number of no-decision fights. However, newspapers commonly reported a winner in the case of no-decision bouts. With that adjustment, Welsh&#x27;s final record would be 110–25–15 with 32 KOs and 16 no-decisions.

==Fighting style==
During his career Welsh was often reported in the British press as having learned his boxing trade in America, and therefore he had an ungentlemanly style of boxing, especially when compared to the darling of the National Sporting Club, &#x27;peerless&#x27; Jim Driscoll. Welsh had a history of boxing in his family, with his paternal grandfather being a mountain fighter.

Although Welsh is often criticised throughout his career as being unable to knock out his opponents, his style centred on his footwork and ability to avoid punishment. He was calm, elusive and able to frustrate those who faced him, especially heavy hitters. Welsh would often finish long fights without injury, while his opponents suffered heavy damage, and was described as &quot;essentially a long-distance fighter&quot;.

==Vegetarianism==
Welsh, when talking to the press, always stated that he was a vegetarian. This was always received with a mixture of interest and jest from his opponent and the journalists. Welsh was a vegetarian for its health values, inspired by the writings of Bernarr Macfadden, and showed no interest in animal welfare. When Welsh beat Phil Brock, he received a telegram from Macfadden stating &#x27;Mr. Welsh - Dear Sir: Hope you will go through the whole bunch of meat eaters&#x27;.

Although he preached the benefits of vegetarianism, he was not averse to eating meat if required. In an interview Welsh once stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in a variety of cooked dishes. I eat as much raw food as possible, and this second meal consists of all sorts of vegetables, and for the main dish I have a macaroni and cheese, followed by fruit and nuts and a little rice or tapioca pudding. I find plenty of vegetable and fruits to choose from without touching meat at all. I am not a faddist, and, I eat meat when I cannot get anything else.&quot;

In his later life his adherence to vegetarianism slipped, and his difficulty in maintaining his weight after 1913 was credited to him switching diets. Welsh was known to slip away after training to secluded roadhouses where he would eat his favourite meal Chicken Maryland.

<doc id="1089263" wikidata="Q8031151" url="?curid=1089263" title="Women's fiction">
<text>Women&#x27;s fiction is an umbrella term for women-centered books that focus on women&#x27;s life experience that are marketed to female readers, and includes many mainstream novels or women&#x27;s rights books. It is distinct from women&#x27;s writing, which refers to literature written by (rather than promoted to) women. There exists no comparable label in English for works of fiction that are marketed to men.

The Romance Writers of America organization defines women&#x27;s fiction as, &quot;a commercial novel about a woman on the brink of life change and personal growth. Her journey details emotional reflection and action that transforms her and her relationships with others, and includes a hopeful/upbeat ending with regard to her romantic relationship.&quot;

The Women&#x27;s Fiction Writers&#x27; Association gives a broader and more inclusive definition, in which romance elements are not mandatory: &quot;Our stories may include romance, or they may not. They can be contemporary or historical and have magical, mystery, thriller, or other elements. Whereas the driving force of a romance novel is a love story, a mystery&#x27;s is the exposure of an event, a thriller&#x27;s is a fear-inducing chase or escape, etc., the driving force of women&#x27;s fiction is the protagonist&#x27;s journey toward a more fulfilled self.

&quot;Women&#x27;s fiction as defined by WFWA is reflected in our guiding statement: Women&#x27;s Fiction Writers Association is an inclusive organization of writers creating layered stories in which the plot is driven by the main character’s emotional journey.&quot;

== Criticism of the term ==
While the women&#x27;s fiction label is embraced by some authors, others have argued that it is applied too broadly to works by women that would otherwise be considered literary fiction, therefore marginalizes women&#x27;s writing. Critics point to the lack of an equivalent term for men&#x27;s works, and that men&#x27;s works are rarely if ever considered women&#x27;s fiction even if they fall within the parameters of the genre. Author Jennifer Weiner has been a vocal critic of the term, which she believes leads to books written by women receiving less publicity, fewer reviews, and lower esteem than those written by men. Women&#x27;s fiction has been compared to chick lit, a term that has since fallen out of favor.

<doc id="1089269" wikidata="Q2584915" url="?curid=1089269" title="Westcliff-on-Sea">
<text>Westcliff-on-Sea (often abbreviated to Westcliff, and in the past spelt as Westcliffe-on-Sea) is a suburb of the city of Southend-on-Sea, located within the ceremonial county of Essex, England. It is on the north shore of the lower Thames Estuary, about 37 miles (55 km) east of London. The Westcliff-on-Sea area is described by Southend-on-Sea City Council as having a border in the east with Milton Road, Hamlet Court Road and Gainsborough Drive; Prittlewell Chase to the North and Valkyrie Road/ London Road/ Southbourne Grove in the west. Traditionally Westcliff included Chalkwell.

==Geography==

The cliffs formed by erosion of the local quaternary geology give views over the Thames Estuary towards the Kent coastline to the south. The coastline has been transformed into sandy beaches through the use of groynes and imported sand. The estuary at this point has extensive mud flats. At low tide, the water typically retreats some 600 m from the beach, leaving the mud flats exposed.

==History==
The southern area of what is now known as Westcliff, south of the London Road, was known as Milton or Milton Hamlet until the period 1860–1880 when the Milton Estate and surrounding land was sold to speculators who preferred the name Westcliff-on-Sea. The name Milton was derived from being in the middle between Leigh and Southchurch, with the settlement said to be from where Leigh Road meets Chalkwell Park to the mayor&#x27;s residence at Porters. The protestant martyr John Frith was captured on the shore at Milton trying to escape in 1532. By the time the station opened in 1895, it was named Westcliff not Milton. The area between Milton Road and Hamlet Court Road was named The Hamlet by the original developers Brassey, Peto, Betts &amp; Co. when they developed it as a &quot;high class suburban retreat&quot;. Milton Hall (demolished 1900) was on the site of the what is now Nazareth House on the London Road. Hamlet Court was a large house in the area between Hamlet Court Road, Canewdon Road, and Ditton Court Road and was demolished in 1929.

==Governance==
Westcliff-on-Sea is covered by several wards under Southend-on-Sea City Council, including some that fall outside of the designated area of Westcliff. The wards are:
* Westborough
* Milton
* Victoria
* Prittlewell

==Transport==
The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway route passing through the suburb was completed to Southend in 1856 but the Westcliff railway station in Station Road was not opened until 1895. It is now managed by c2c.

==Education==
Westcliff is served by two selective secondary schools: Westcliff High School for Girls and Westcliff High School for Boys, two Catholic secondary schools: St Thomas More High School for boys and St Bernard&#x27;s High School, Westcliff-on-Sea for girls, and the non selective Chase High School.

==Architecture==
Several areas of Westcliff have been classified as conservation areas: Clifftown bordering Southend town centre and including Prittlewell Square gardens, Shorefield and the Leas towards the sea front, and Milton focused on the Park Estate between Park Street and Milton Road. The Milton Conservation Area includes the Grade II listed building which was formerly the Wesleyan Chapel (Park Road Methodist Church) it was completed in 1872 to the design of Elijah Hoole (1837-1912) and was Southend&#x27;s first permanent Methodist Church.

Westcliff contains a number of other Grade II listed buildings, Our Lady Help of Christians and St Helen&#x27;s Church in Milton Road, the Church of Saint Alban the Martyr in St John&#x27;s Road, the former Havens department store in Hamlet Court Road, Marteg House in Annerley Road, Westcliff Library in London Road and the Palace Theatre. Westcliff Library, designed by Patrick Burridge, the councils architect in 1956, built on a site damaged by bombing in World War II. The building was listed as Grade II in 1998.

The official list entries for these are available from Historic England on the National Heritage List for England.

==Economy==
The main shopping area in Westcliff-on-Sea is Hamlet Court Road, where the department store Havens established itself in 1901, and remained the anchor store until its closure in 2017. Hamlet Court Road took its name from a manor house called the Hamlet Court, which stood on land now occupied by Pavarotti&#x27;s restaurant and adjoining shops, facing towards the sea with sweeping gardens down to the rail line. The road later developed into a strong independent retail area and quickly became famous outside the area as the Bond Street of Essex. There were many haberdashers and specialist shops, and it was not too unusual to see chauffeurs waiting for their employers to emerge from the shops.

The economic recessions of the 1980s and 1990s saw the area decline. The road underwent a £1 million regeneration in the early 2000s and a further regeneration in 2010. Further plans have been put forward by Southend-on-Sea City Council to pedestrianise half of the street, while the local historical organisation, the Milton Society is campaigning to regenerate the road on the lines of Margate and the Cathedral Quarter in Derby.

The Milton Ward in Westcliff is one of the most deprived areas in England. The ward is mostly in the top 20% most deprived areas in the East of England, but some of the ward is in the top 10% most deprived areas in the country.

==Leisure==

The two main theatres in Westcliff are the Cliffs Pavilion, which overlooks the seafront, and the Palace Theatre situated on the London Road.

Westcliff-on-Sea is also home to the Thames Estuary Yacht Club and the Genting Casino Westcliff. Westcliff RFC currently play in National League 2 East, the fourth tier of the English rugby union system.

==In Literature==

<text>Random sample consensus (RANSAC) is an iterative method to estimate parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data that contains outliers, when outliers are to be on the values of the estimates. Therefore, it also can be interpreted as an outlier detection method. It is a non-deterministic algorithm in the sense that it produces a reasonable result only with a certain probability, with this probability increasing as more iterations are allowed. The algorithm was first published by Fischler and Bolles at SRI International in 1981. They used RANSAC to solve the location determination problem (LDP), where the goal is to determine the points in the space that project onto an image into a set of landmarks with known locations.

RANSAC uses repeated random sub-sampling. A basic assumption is that the data consists of &quot;inliers&quot;, i.e., data whose distribution can be explained by some set of model parameters, though may be subject to noise, and &quot;outliers&quot;, which are data that do not fit the model. The outliers can come, for example, from extreme values of the noise or from erroneous measurements or incorrect hypotheses about the interpretation of data. RANSAC also assumes that, given a (usually small) set of inliers, there exists a procedure that can estimate the parameters of a model optimally explaining or fitting this data.

==Example==
A simple example is fitting a line in two dimensions to a set of observations. Assuming that this set contains both &quot;inliers&quot;, i.e., points which approximately can be fitted to a line, and &quot;outliers&quot;, points which cannot be fitted to this line, a simple least squares method for line fitting will generally produce a line with a bad fit to the data including inliers and outliers. The reason is that it is optimally fitted to all points, including the outliers. RANSAC, on the other hand, attempts to exclude the outliers and find a linear model that only uses the inliers in its calculation. This is done by fitting linear models to several random samplings of the data and returning the model that has the best fit to a subset of the data. Since the inliers tend to be more linearly related than a random mixture of inliers and outliers, a random subset that consists entirely of inliers will have the best model fit. In practice, there is no guarantee that a subset of inliers will be randomly sampled, and the probability of the algorithm succeeding depends on the proportion of inliers in the data as well as the choice of several algorithm parameters.

==Overview==
The RANSAC algorithm is a learning technique to estimate parameters of a model by random sampling of observed data. Given a dataset whose data elements contain both inliers and outliers, RANSAC uses the voting scheme to find the optimal fitting result. Data elements in the dataset are used to vote for one or multiple models. The implementation of this voting scheme is based on two assumptions: that the noisy features will not vote consistently for any single model (few outliers) and there are enough features to agree on a good model (few missing data). The RANSAC algorithm is essentially composed of two steps that are iteratively repeated:
# A sample subset containing minimal number of data items is randomly selected from the input dataset. A fitting model with model parameters is computed using only the elements of this sample subset. The cardinality of the sample subset (e.g., the amount of data in this subset) is sufficient to determine the model parameters.
# The algorithm checks which elements of the entire dataset are consistent with the model instantiated by the estimated model parameters obtained from the first step. A data element will be considered as an outlier if it does not fit the model within some error threshold defining the maximum data deviation of inliers (data elements beyond this deviation are outliers).
The set of inliers obtained for the fitting model is called the &quot;consensus set&quot;. The RANSAC algorithm will iteratively repeat the above two steps until the obtained consensus set in certain iteration has enough inliers.

The input to the RANSAC algorithm is a set of observed data values, a model to fit to the observations, and some confidence parameters defining outliers. In more details than the aforementioned RANSAC algorithm overview, RANSAC achieves its goal by repeating the following steps:
# Select a random subset of the original data. Call this subset the &quot;hypothetical inliers&quot;.
# A model is fitted to the set of hypothetical inliers.
# All data are then tested against the fitted model. All the data points (of the original data) that fit the estimated model well, according to some model-specific loss function, are called the &quot;consensus set&quot; (i.e., the set of inliers for the model).
# The estimated model is reasonably good if sufficiently many data points have been classified as a part of the consensus set.
# The model may be improved by re-estimating it by using all the members of the consensus set. The fitting quality as a measure of how well the model fits to the consensus set will be used to sharpen the model fitting as iterations goes on (e.g., by setting this measure as the fitting quality criteria at the next iteration).

To converge to a sufficiently good model parameter set, this procedure is repeated a fixed number of times, each time producing either the rejection of a model because too few points are a part of the consensus set, or a refined model with a consensus set size larger than the previous consensus set.

== Pseudocode ==

The generic RANSAC algorithm works as the following pseudocode:

 Given:
 data – A set of observations.
 model – A model to explain the observed data points.
 n – The minimum number of data points required to estimate the model parameters.
 k – The maximum number of iterations allowed in the algorithm.
 t – A threshold value to determine data points that are fit well by the model (inlier).
 d – The number of close data points (inliers) required to assert that the model fits well to the data.
 Return:
 bestFit – The model parameters which may best fit the data (or null if no good model is found).
 
 iterations = 0
 bestFit = null
 bestErr = something really large // This parameter is used to sharpen the model parameters to the best data fitting as iterations go on.
 while &quot;iterations&quot; &lt; &quot;k&quot; do
 maybeInliers := n randomly selected values from data
 maybeModel := model parameters fitted to maybeInliers
 confirmedInliers := empty set
 for every point in data do
 if point fits maybeModel with an error smaller than t then
 add point to confirmedInliers
 end if
 end for
 if the number of elements in confirmedInliers is &gt; d then
 // This implies that we may have found a good model.
 // Now test how good it is.
 betterModel := model parameters fitted to all the points in confirmedInliers
 thisErr := a measure of how well betterModel fits these points
 if thisErr &lt; bestErr then
 bestFit := betterModel
 bestErr := thisErr
 end if
 end if
 increment iterations
 end while
 return bestFit

== Parameters ==
The threshold value to determine when a data point fits a model (), and the number of inliers (data points fitted to the model within &quot;t&quot;) required to assert that the model fits well to data () are determined based on specific requirements of the application and the dataset, and possibly based on experimental evaluation. The number of iterations (), however, can be roughly determined as a function of the desired probability of success () as shown below.

Let be the desired probability that the RANSAC algorithm provides at least one useful result after running. In extreme (for simplifying the derivation), RANSAC returns a successful result if in some iteration it selects only inliers from the input data set when it chooses points from the data set from which the model parameters are estimated. (In other words, all the selected data points are inliers of the model estimated by these points). Let formula_1 be the probability of choosing an inlier each time a single data point is selected, that is roughly,

:formula_1 = number of inliers in data / number of points in data

A common case is that formula_1 is not well known beforehand because of an unknown number of inliers in data before running the RANSAC algorithm, but some rough value can be given. With a given rough value of formula_1 and roughly assuming that the points needed for estimating a model are selected independently (It is a rough assumption because each data point selection reduces the number of data point candidates to choose in the next selection in reality), formula_5 is the probability that all &quot;n&quot; points are inliers and formula_6 is the probability that at least one of the points is an outlier, a case which implies that a bad model will be estimated from this point set. That probability to the power of (the number of iterations in running the algorithm) is the probability that the algorithm never selects a set of points which all are inliers, and this is the same as formula_7 (the probability that the algorithm does not result in a successful model estimation) in extreme. Consequently,

:formula_8

which, after taking the logarithm of both sides, leads to

:formula_9

This result assumes that the data points are selected independently, that is, a point which has been selected once is replaced and can be selected again in the same iteration. This is often not a reasonable approach and the derived value for should be taken as an upper limit in the case that the points are selected without replacement. For example, in the case of finding a line which fits the data set illustrated in the above figure, the RANSAC algorithm typically chooses two points in each iteration and computes codice_3 as the line between the points and it is then critical that the two points are distinct.

To gain additional confidence, the standard deviation or multiples thereof can be added to . The standard deviation of is defined as

:formula_10

==Advantages and disadvantages==

An advantage of RANSAC is its ability to do robust estimation of the model parameters, i.e., it can estimate the parameters with a high degree of accuracy even when a significant number of outliers are present in the data set. A disadvantage of RANSAC is that there is no upper bound on the time it takes to compute these parameters (except exhaustion). When the number of iterations computed is limited, the solution obtained may not be optimal, and it may not even be one that fits the data in a good way. In this way RANSAC offers a trade-off; by computing a greater number of iterations, the probability of a reasonable model being produced is increased. Moreover, RANSAC is not always able to find the optimal set even for moderately contaminated sets, and it usually performs badly when the number of inliers is less than 50%. Optimal RANSAC was proposed to handle both these problems and is capable of finding the optimal set for heavily contaminated sets, even for an inlier ratio under 5%. Another disadvantage of RANSAC is that it requires the setting of problem-specific thresholds.

RANSAC can only estimate one model for a particular data set. As for any one-model approach when two (or more) model instances exist, RANSAC may fail to find either one. The Hough transform is one alternative robust estimation technique that may be useful when more than one model instance is present. Another approach for multi-model fitting is known as PEARL, which combines model sampling from data points as in RANSAC with iterative re-estimation of inliers and the multi-model fitting being formulated as an optimization problem with a global energy function describing the quality of the overall solution.

==Applications==
The RANSAC algorithm is often used in computer vision, e.g., to simultaneously solve the correspondence problem and estimate the fundamental matrix related to a pair of stereo cameras; see also: Structure from motion, scale-invariant feature transform, image stitching, rigid motion segmentation.

==Development and improvements==
Since 1981 RANSAC has become a fundamental tool in the computer vision and image processing community. In 2006, for the 25th anniversary of the algorithm, a workshop was organized at the International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) to summarize the most recent contributions and variations to the original algorithm, mostly meant to improve the speed of the algorithm, the robustness and accuracy of the estimated solution and to decrease the dependency from user defined constants.

RANSAC can be sensitive to the choice of the correct noise threshold that defines which data points fit a model instantiated with a certain set of parameters. If such threshold is too large, then all the hypotheses tend to be ranked equally (good). On the other hand, when the noise threshold is too small, the estimated parameters tend to be unstable ( i.e. by simply adding or removing a datum to the set of inliers, the estimate of the parameters may fluctuate). To partially compensate for this undesirable effect, Torr et al. proposed two modification of RANSAC called MSAC (M-estimator SAmple and Consensus) and MLESAC (Maximum Likelihood Estimation SAmple and Consensus). The main idea is to evaluate the quality of the consensus set ( i.e. the data that fit a model and a certain set of parameters) calculating its likelihood (whereas in the original formulation by Fischler and Bolles the rank was the cardinality of such set). An extension to MLESAC which takes into account the prior probabilities associated to the input dataset is proposed by Tordoff. The resulting algorithm is dubbed Guided-MLESAC. Along similar lines, Chum proposed to guide the sampling procedure if some a priori information regarding the input data is known, i.e. whether a datum is likely to be an inlier or an outlier. The proposed approach is called PROSAC, PROgressive SAmple Consensus.

Chum et al. also proposed a randomized version of RANSAC called R-RANSAC to reduce the computational burden to identify a good consensus set. The basic idea is to initially evaluate the goodness of the currently instantiated model using only a reduced set of points instead of the entire dataset. A sound strategy will tell with high confidence when it is the case to evaluate the fitting of the entire dataset or when the model can be readily discarded. It is reasonable to think that the impact of this approach is more relevant in cases where the percentage of inliers is large. The type of strategy proposed by Chum et al. is called preemption scheme. Nistér proposed a paradigm called Preemptive RANSAC that allows real time robust estimation of the structure of a scene and of the motion of the camera. The core idea of the approach consists in generating a fixed number of hypotheses so that the comparison happens with respect to the quality of the generated hypothesis rather than against some absolute quality metric.

Other researchers tried to cope with difficult situations where the noise scale is not known and/or multiple model instances are present. The first problem has been tackled in the work by Wang and Suter. Toldo et al. represent each datum with the characteristic function of the set of random models that fit the point. Then multiple models are revealed as clusters which group the points supporting the same model. The clustering algorithm, called J-linkage, does not require prior specification of the number of models, nor does it necessitate manual parameters tuning.

RANSAC has also been tailored for recursive state estimation applications, where the input measurements are corrupted by outliers and Kalman filter approaches, which rely on a Gaussian distribution of the measurement error, are doomed to fail. Such an approach is dubbed KALMANSAC.

<text>An ultrafast monochromator is a monochromator that preserves the duration of an ultrashort pulse (in the femtosecond, or lower, time-scale). Monochromators are devices that select for a particular wavelength, typically using a diffraction grating to disperse the light and a slit to select the desired wavelength; however, a diffraction grating introduces path delays that measurably lengthen the duration of an ultrashort pulse. An ultrafast monochromator uses a second diffraction grating to compensate time delays introduced to the pulse by the first grating and other dispersive optical elements.

==Diffraction grating==
Diffraction gratings are constructed such that the angle of the incident ray, &quot;θi&quot;, is related to the angle of the &quot;m&quot;th outgoing ray, &quot;θm&quot;, by the expression

:formula_1. 

Two rays diffracted by adjacent grooves will differ in path length by a distance &quot;mλ&quot;. The total difference between the longest and shortest path within a beam is computed by multiplying &quot;mλ&quot; by the total number of grooves illuminated. 

For instance, a beam of width 10 mm illuminating a grating with 1200 grooves/mm uses 12,000 grooves. At a wavelength of 10 nm, the first order diffracted beam, &quot;m&quot; = 1, will have a path length variation across the beam of 120 μm. This corresponds to a time difference in the arrival of 400 femtoseconds. This is often negligible for picosecond pulses but not for those of femtosecond duration.

==Applications==
A major application is the extraction, without time-broadening, of a single high-order harmonic pulse out of the many generated by an ultrafast laser pulse interacting with a gas target.

<doc id="1089286" wikidata="Q518197" url="?curid=1089286" title="Ted Sorensen">
<text>Theodore Chaikin Sorensen (May 8, 1928 – October 31, 2010) was an American lawyer, writer, and presidential adviser. He was a speechwriter for President John F. Kennedy, as well as one of his closest advisers. President Kennedy once called him his &quot;intellectual blood bank&quot;. He collaborated with Kennedy on the book &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; , &quot;assembling and preparing&quot; much of research on which the book was based. Kennedy won the 1957 Pulitzer Prize for Biography. Sorensen helped draft Kennedy&#x27;s inaugural address and Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s Let Us Continue speech following Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, and was the primary author of Kennedy&#x27;s 1962 &quot;We choose to go to the Moon&quot; speech.

==Early life and education==
Sorensen was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of Christian A. Sorensen (1890–1959), who served as Nebraska attorney general (1929–1933), and Annis (Chaikin) Sorensen. His father was Danish American and his mother was of Russian Jewish descent. His younger brother, Philip C. Sorensen, later became the lieutenant governor of Nebraska. He graduated from Lincoln High School during 1945. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and attended University of Nebraska College of Law, graduating first in his class.

During January 1953, the 24-year-old Sorensen became the new chief legislative aide to Senator John F. Kennedy. He wrote many of Kennedy&#x27;s articles and speeches. In his 2008 autobiography &quot;Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History&quot;, Sorensen said he wrote &quot;a first draft of most of the chapters&quot; of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1956 book &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; and &quot;helped choose the words of many of its sentences.&quot;

== Career ==

=== Kennedy administration ===

Sorensen was President Kennedy&#x27;s special counsel, adviser, and primary speechwriter, the role for which he is remembered best. He helped draft the inaugural address in which Kennedy said famously, &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.&quot; Although Sorensen played an important part in the composition of the inaugural address, he has stated that &quot;the speech and its famous turn of phrase that everyone remembers was written by Kennedy himself.&quot; In his 2008 memoir, &quot;Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History&quot;, Sorensen claimed, &quot;The truth is that I simply don&#x27;t remember where the line came from.&quot;

During the early months of the administration, Sorensen&#x27;s responsibilities concerned the domestic agenda. After the Bay of Pigs debacle, Kennedy asked Sorensen to participate with foreign policy discussions as well. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Sorensen served as a member of ExComm and was named by Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara as one of the &quot;true inner circle&quot; members who advised the president, the others being Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, General Maxwell D. Taylor (chairman of the Joint Chiefs), former ambassador to the USSR Llewellyn Thompson, and McNamara himself. Sorensen played a critical role in drafting Kennedy&#x27;s correspondence with Nikita Khrushchev and worked on Kennedy&#x27;s first address to the nation about the crisis on October 22.

Sorensen was devastated by Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, which he termed &quot;the most deeply traumatic experience of my life. ... I had never considered a future without him.&quot; He later quoted a poem that he said summed up how he felt: &quot;How could you leave us, how could you die? We are sheep without a shepherd when the snow shuts out the sky.&quot; He submitted a letter of resignation to President Lyndon B. Johnson the day after the assassination but was persuaded to stay through the transition. Sorensen drafted Johnson&#x27;s first address to Congress as well as the 1964 State of the Union. He officially resigned February 29, 1964, and was the first member of the Kennedy Administration to do so. As Johnson was later to recount in his memoirs, Sorensen helped in the transition to the new administration with those speeches.

Prior to his resignation, Sorensen stated his intent to write Kennedy&#x27;s biography, calling it &quot;the book that President Kennedy had intended to write with my help after his second term.&quot; He was not the only Kennedy aide to publish writings; Paul “Red” Fay, Jr., Kennedy’s Secretary of the Navy and a close friend of Kennedy’s from his Navy service wrote &quot;The Pleasure of His Company&quot;, David Powers and Kenneth O’Donnell, Special Assistants to the President wrote &quot;Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye&quot;, and historian and special assistant Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. wrote his Pulitzer Prize winning memoir &quot;A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House&quot; during the same period. Sorensen&#x27;s biography, &quot;Kennedy&quot;, was published during 1965 and became an international bestseller.

=== Politics after Kennedy ===
Sorensen later joined the U.S. law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP, where he was of counsel, while still staying involved in politics. He was involved with Democratic campaigns and was a major adviser of Robert F. Kennedy in Kennedy&#x27;s 1968 presidential campaign. After the death of Robert Kennedy he wrote a book entitled &quot;The Kennedy Legacy: A Peaceful Revolution For The Seventies&quot; (1969) about the political ideals of the Kennedy brothers that could be applied to the Democratic Party in particular and to America and American society in general going forward. During the next four decades, Sorensen had a career as an international lawyer, advising governments around the world, as well as major international corporations.

During the 1970 United States Senate election in New York, Sorensen was the Democratic party&#x27;s designee for the Democratic nomination for U.S. senator from New York. He was challenged in the primary election by Richard Ottinger, Paul O&#x27;Dwyer, and Max McCarthy, and polled third. The winning nominee Ottinger was subsequently defeated by James L. Buckley in the general election. 

In 1973, Sorensen wrote a contingency plan for the presidential transition of the Democratic Speaker of the House Carl Albert. Albert was third in the United States presidential line of succession under the Twenty-fifth Amendment in the event that Richard Nixon was impeached or forced to resign by the Watergate scandal, and if the nomination of Gerald Ford to replace Spiro Agnew as Vice President failed. The memorandum included advice on drafting an inaugural address and appointing a Cabinet. It recommended the appointment of a Republican Vice President, but urged Albert to remain in office as President until the end of the term. The memorandum was discarded because Ford was nominated and because Albert personally did not wish to be President. 

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter nominated Sorensen as Director of Central Intelligence, but the nomination was withdrawn before a Senate vote. Sorensen&#x27;s help with explaining Ted Kennedy&#x27;s Chappaquiddick incident and Sorensen&#x27;s mishandling of classified information were cited as factors of Senate opposition to his nomination. Sorensen in his autobiography attributed the loss of Senate support for his nomination for CIA director to his conscientious objector status as a youth, his two failed marriages, and his writing an affidavit in defense of releasing Daniel Ellsberg&#x27;s Pentagon Papers.

Sorensen was the national co-chairman for Gary Hart for the 1984 Democratic Party presidential primaries and made several appearances on his behalf.

In addition to his successful career as a lawyer, Sorensen was also a frequent spokesman for liberal ideals and ideas, writing opinion-editorials and delivering speeches concerning domestic and international subjects. For several years during the 1960s, he was an editor of the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;.

He was affiliated with a number of institutions, including the Council On Foreign Relations, The Century Foundation, Princeton University, and the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School. Sorensen was a board member of the International Center for Transitional Justice and an advisory board member of the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating bipartisan consensus for American national security and foreign policy. He also was chairman of the advisory board to the International Center for Ethics, Justice and Public Life at Brandeis University. Sorensen also attended meetings of the Judson Welliver Society, a bipartisan social club composed of former presidential speechwriters.

During 2007, a model Democratic presidential nomination acceptance speech written by Sorensen was published in the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot;. The magazine had solicited him to write the speech that he would most want the 2008 Democratic nominee to give at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, without regard to the identity of the nominee.

On March 9, 2007, he spoke at an event with then-senator Barack Obama at New York City&#x27;s Grand Hyatt Hotel and officially endorsed him in the presidential election in 2008. Very active in his campaign, Sorensen spoke early on and frequently about the similarities between Obama&#x27;s and John Kennedy&#x27;s presidential campaigns. He also provided some assistance with President Obama&#x27;s 2009 Inaugural Address.

Sorensen served on the advisory board of the National Security Network.

In his book &quot;Let The Word Go Forth&quot;, Sorensen selects from more than 110 speeches and writings that indicate the importance of historical insights in Kennedy&#x27;s thoughts and actions.

==Personal life==
He was married three times. His first marriage, in 1949, was to Camilla Palmer. The couple had three sons: Eric, Steven, and Philip. They later divorced. In 1964, he married Sara Elbery. That marriage also ended in divorce. In 1969, Sorensen married Gillian Martin of the United Nations Foundation. They had a daughter, Juliet Sorensen, and remained married until Sorensen&#x27;s death.

On February 25, 2010, he received the National Humanities Medal for 2009 in a ceremony in the East Room of the White House. He was awarded the medal for &quot;Advancing our understanding of modern American politics. As a speechwriter and adviser to President Kennedy, he helped craft messages and policies, and later gave us a window into the people and events that made history.&quot;

=== Death ===
On October 31, 2010, Sorensen died at the age of 82 at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City of complications from a stroke he suffered the previous week.

<doc id="1089293" wikidata="Q921679" url="?curid=1089293" title="Jason Molina">
<text>Jason Andrew Molina (December 30, 1973 – March 16, 2013) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. Raised in northern Ohio, he came to prominence performing and recording as Songs: Ohia, both in solo projects and with a rotating cast of musicians in the late 1990s. Beginning in 2003, he garnered a further indie following for his releases with the band Magnolia Electric Co.

Molina had a prolific career between his two musical projects and solo releases, producing a total of sixteen studio albums, eight EPs, and numerous singles. His overall discography was noted by critics for blending elements of indie rock, blues, and alternative country with his tenor vocal range.

In 2009, Molina canceled a European and U.S. tour with Will Johnson, citing health problems. He spent the next four years dealing with alcoholism, which ultimately resulted in his death from multiple organ failure in March 2013.

== Early life ==
Molina was born December 30, 1973 in Oberlin, Ohio. His father was a middle school teacher. He had one brother, Aaron, and one sister, Ashley. Molina was raised in Lorain, Ohio, an industrial town 25 miles west of Cleveland, and grew up in a single-wide trailer on Lake Erie. He began playing guitar at age 10. Molina attended Admiral King High School, graduating in 1992. During school, he played bass guitar, most notably with the metal band Spineriders.

Molina attended Oberlin College, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in art history in 1996. After playing bass guitar in various metal bands in and around Cleveland, Molina became a solo artist under an assumed band name, recruiting other musicians for each project as needed. He made several home recordings under various names, including &quot;Songs: Albian&quot;, &quot;Songs: Radix&quot;, and &quot;Songs: Unitas&quot;, which he distributed himself at live performances.

== Career ==
=== Songs: Ohia: 1995–2003 ===
Songs: Ohia was largely a project of revolving musicians with Molina as its center and sole stable member. The band&#x27;s genre is generally considered indie rock, lo-fi, folk, or alt-country. The second part of the name is an allusion to both the Hawaiian tree &quot;&#x27;Ōhi&#x27;a lehua&quot; and Molina&#x27;s home state of Ohio.

The first Songs: Ohia release came in 1995 as a single on Palace Records, &quot;Nor Cease Thou Never Now&quot;. This was followed by the 1997 full-length album (known among fans as &quot;The Black Album&quot;), released on the Bloomington, Indiana-based label Secretly Canadian.

In 2000, Molina released three albums: &quot;The Lioness&quot;, recorded near Glasgow by producer Andy Miller with help from Alasdair Roberts and members of Arab Strap; &quot;Ghost Tropic&quot;, recorded by Mike Mogis; and &quot;Protection Spells&quot;, a solo album sold at live shows and now out of print. By 2000, Molina had given his tenor guitar a rest in favor of a regular six-string electric guitar and put together a full band to back him, including brothers Rob and Dan Sullivan on bass and guitar, Jeff Panall on drums, and Jim Grabowski on organ. In the same year the touring band recorded a live album near Modena, Italy, released locally in 2001 as &quot;Mi Sei Apparso Come Un Fantasma&quot;.

In 2002, Molina recorded &quot;Didn&#x27;t It Rain&quot; in Philadelphia with members of bluegrass band Jim &amp; Jennie &amp; the Pinetops. On the album, named after a Mahalia Jackson song, the band achieved an almost gospel sound that was a vast departure from the dense feel of &quot;Ghost Tropic&quot;. Constantly recording and writing new songs, Songs: Ohia released a handful of singles and EPs in 2002, including a split EP with My Morning Jacket and a collaborative EP (under the name Amalgamated Sons of Rest) with Will Oldham and Alasdair Roberts.

The 2003 release &quot;Magnolia Electric Co.&quot; marked a shift in direction for Songs: Ohia. Every song was recorded live in the studio with a full touring band plus musicians from &quot;Didn&#x27;t It Rain&quot;. The album&#x27;s sound draws heavily from the heartland rock and folk-rock of the 1960s/70s, as well as Molina&#x27;s heavy metal roots.

=== Magnolia Electric Co.: 2003–2012 ===

In March 2003, while on tour, Molina announced that he would rename the band Magnolia Electric Co., retaining the stylistic direction of the album of the same name. He also continued to release solo work under his own name. The first such release came in January 2004 as the full-length vinyl release &quot;Pyramid Electric Co.&quot;

Engineered by Mike Mogis, who also engineered &quot;Ghost Tropic&quot;, &quot;Pyramid&quot; found Molina alone at the microphone with only his voice and a piano or guitar. Magnolia Electric Co.&#x27;s first official release was a live album, &quot;Trials and Errors&quot;, followed by a studio album, &quot;What Comes After the Blues&quot;, and an EP, &quot;Hard to Love a Man&quot;, all released in 2005. In 2006, Molina released two more records: the sparse solo &quot;Let Me Go, Let Me Go, Let Me Go&quot; and the more conventional &quot;Fading Trails&quot; with Magnolia Electric Co., the latter culled from three separate sessions over the previous year.

It is not entirely clear when Songs: Ohia became Magnolia Electric Co. In interviews, Molina claimed that he considered the tenure of Songs: Ohia over after &quot;Didn&#x27;t It Rain&quot;, which would make &quot;Magnolia Electric Co.&quot; the self-titled debut album under the new name. The name &quot;Songs: Ohia&quot; appears nowhere on the artwork of the album and only a promotional sticker on the cellophane wrapping connects it with the prior name. Nevertheless, Secretly Canadian still promotes the album under the Songs: Ohia moniker. On the other hand, the Magnolia Electric Co. live album &quot;Trials and Errors&quot; was recorded on April 16, 2003, at the Ancienne Belgique club in Brussels, at a time when the band was still touring under the Songs: Ohia name. Pitchfork Media later reported that name change would be made official after the Spanish tour in October 2003.

=== Later years and illness: 2009–2013 ===

According to Magnolia Electric Co. bandmate Jason Groth, Molina &quot;and the bottle had a complicated relationship&quot; dating back as far as 2003. The full extent of his alcoholism was not revealed to many of his close friends until after 2009.

A European tour for Molina &amp; Johnson in support of their self-titled album was scheduled for November and December 2009; the tour was canceled on November 23, three days before it was to begin. A brief note on the band&#x27;s website blamed &quot;health problems&quot; (without elaborating) for the cancelations and noted, &quot;Jason Molina is extremely disappointed but there is no way he can be on the road at the present time.&quot; A U.S. leg of the Molina &amp; Johnson tour was scheduled for January and February 2010 but was canceled in early December with another brief note on the band&#x27;s website citing Molina&#x27;s &quot;present health issues&quot;. Following this announcement, Molina effectively withdrew from public life.

On September 19, 2011, a message from Molina&#x27;s family was posted on the Secretly Canadian Records website, titled &quot;Where Is Jason Molina?&quot;, which said that over the preceding two years Molina had visited rehab facilities and hospitals in England, Chicago, Indianapolis, and New Orleans for an unnamed condition. His family wrote that he was &quot;currently working on a farm in West Virginia raising goats and chickens for the next year or so, and is looking forward to making great music again.&quot;

On May 5, 2012, a post titled &quot;a note from jason&quot; was posted on the Magnolia Electric Co. website, explaining certain aspects of his situation for the first time. Saying that it had been &quot;a long hospital year&quot;, Molina expressed gratitude and appreciation for the monetary and emotional support he had received from fans and friends. He gave a brief update on his condition, saying, &quot;Treatment is good, getting to deal with a lot of things that even the music didn&#x27;t want to. I have not given up because you, my friends have not given up on me.&quot; The note concludes optimistically, saying that there were a few music projects on the &quot;distant radar screen&quot;.

== Death and legacy ==
Molina died on March 16, 2013, in Indianapolis of alcohol abuse-related organ failure. He was 39. His friend Henry Owings published an article in his online music magazine &quot;Chunklet&quot; that said Molina had struggled with alcoholism for most of the decade leading up to his death. Owings also wrote that Molina had &quot;cashed out on Saturday night in Indianapolis with nothing but a cell phone in his pocket&quot;. Molina was cremated.

Following 2013, two posthumous 7-inch singles of Townes Van Zandt and Black Sabbath covers were released. In May 2013, Graveface Records released a double CD called &quot;Weary Engine Blues: A Tribute to Jason Molina&quot;. Additionally, a biography of Molina, &quot;Jason Molina: Riding with the Ghost&quot;, was published in May 2017 by Erin Osmon. A plaque dedicated in Molina&#x27;s memory was erected on the entrance of Secretly Canadian&#x27;s second storage facility. In January 2018, the indie label Dead Oceans published in homage to Molina the cooperation single &quot;Farewell Transmission b/w The Dark Don&#x27;t Hide It&quot; by Kevin Morby and Waxahatchee. Two posthumous albums, &quot;Live at La Chapelle&quot; and &quot;Eight Gates&quot;, were released by Secretly Canadian in 2020.

== Artistry ==
Music critics noted Molina&#x27;s music for its unique blend of indie rock with blues, alternative country, and lo-fi music, which combined &quot;Rust Belt grit with Americana music&#x27;s pastoral imagery.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s William Yardley characterized Molina as a &quot;balladeer of heartbreak&quot;. He possessed a tenor vocal range.

According to Molina, he treated his work as a musician like a standard job, writing music eight hours per day. &quot;I throw away most of what I write&quot;, he said in a 2006 interview. &quot;I feel a lot of guilt about the freedom that being an artist provides. I ask myself, &#x27;Why am I not the guy emptying the trash, why am I the guy who is watching the guy empty the trash?

== Personal life ==
Molina was married to Darcie Schoenman Molina. They had no children and were estranged at the time of his death.

<text>Bromyrite or bromargyrite is a natural mineral form of silver bromide found mainly in Mexico and Chile. Hardness is 1.5 to 2. Related are chlorargyrite and iodyrite.

It was first described in 1859 for an occurrence in Plateros, Zacatecas, Mexico where it occurred in a silver deposit as an oxidation product of primary ore minerals. It occurs in arid environments along with native silver, iodargyrite and smithsonite along with iron and manganese oxide minerals.

<text>Billy is a lunar impact crater that is located at the southern fringes of the Oceanus Procellarum, in the western hemisphere of the Moon. It was named after French mathematician Jacques de Billy. It lies to the southeast of the similar-sized crater Hansteen, and west-southwest of the flooded Letronne.

The interior floor of Billy has been flooded by basaltic lava, leaving a dark surface due to the low albedo. The portion of the rim remaining above the surface is narrow and low, with a thin inner wall. Only a few tiny craterlets mark the interior.

To the north of the crater is a triangular mountainous formation named Mons Hansteen, from the nearby crater. Southeast of Billy is a rille, designated Rima Billy, that runs 70 kilometers to the south.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Billy.

<doc id="1089311" wikidata="Q1538614" url="?curid=1089311" title="Modular lattice">
<text>In the branch of mathematics called order theory, a modular lattice is a lattice that satisfies the following self-dual condition,
;Modular law: implies 

where are arbitrary elements in the lattice,  ≤  is the partial order, and  ∨  and  ∧ (called join and meet respectively) are the operations of the lattice. This phrasing emphasizes an interpretation in terms of projection onto the sublattice , a fact known as the diamond isomorphism theorem. An alternative but equivalent condition stated as an equation (see below) emphasizes that modular lattices form a variety in the sense of universal algebra.

Modular lattices arise naturally in algebra and in many other areas of mathematics. In these scenarios, modularity is an abstraction of the 2nd Isomorphism Theorem. For example, the subspaces of a vector space (and more generally the submodules of a module over a ring) form a modular lattice.

In a not necessarily modular lattice, there may still be elements for which the modular law holds in connection with arbitrary elements and (for ). Such an element is called a right modular element. Even more generally, the modular law may hold for any and a fixed pair . Such a pair is called a modular pair, and there are various generalizations of modularity related to this notion and to semimodularity.

Modular lattices are sometimes called Dedekind lattices after Richard Dedekind, who discovered the modular identity in several motivating examples.

==Introduction==
The modular law can be seen as a restricted associative law that connects the two lattice operations similarly to the way in which the associative law λ(μ&quot;x&quot;) = (λμ)&quot;x&quot; for vector spaces connects multiplication in the field and scalar multiplication.

The restriction is clearly necessary, since it follows from . In other words, no lattice with more than one element satisfies the unrestricted consequent of the modular law.

It is easy to see that implies in every lattice. Therefore, the modular law can also be stated as

;Modular law (variant): implies .

The modular law can be expressed as an equation that is required to hold unconditionally. Since implies and since , replace with in the defining equation of the modular law to obtain:
;Modular identity: .
This shows that, using terminology from universal algebra, the modular lattices form a subvariety of the variety of lattices. Therefore, all homomorphic images, sublattices and direct products of modular lattices are again modular.

==Examples==

The lattice of submodules of a module over a ring is modular. As a special case, the lattice of subgroups of an abelian group is modular.

The lattice of normal subgroups of a group is modular. But in general the lattice of all subgroups of a group is not modular. For an example, the lattice of subgroups of the dihedral group of order 8 is not modular.

The smallest non-modular lattice is the &quot;pentagon&quot; lattice &quot;N&quot;5 consisting of five elements 0, 1, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; such that 0 &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; &lt; 1, 0 &lt; &quot;a&quot; &lt; 1, and &quot;a&quot; is not comparable to &quot;x&quot; or to &quot;b&quot;. For this lattice,
:&quot;x&quot; ∨ (&quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; ∨ 0 = &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; = 1 ∧ &quot;b&quot; = (&quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;a&quot;) ∧ &quot;b&quot;
holds, contradicting the modular law. Every non-modular lattice contains a copy of &quot;N&quot;5 as a sublattice.

== Properties ==
Every distributive lattice is modular.

 proved that, in every finite modular lattice, the number of join-irreducible elements equals the number of meet-irreducible elements. More generally, for every , the number of elements of the lattice that cover exactly other elements equals the number that are covered by exactly other elements.

A useful property to show that a lattice is not modular is as follows:

: A lattice is modular if and only if, for any ,
::formula_1

Sketch of proof: Let G be modular, and let the premise of the implication hold. Then using absorption and modular identity:

: &quot;c&quot; = (&quot;c&quot;∧&quot;b&quot;) ∨ &quot;c&quot; = (&quot;a&quot;∧&quot;b&quot;) ∨ &quot;c&quot; = &quot;a&quot; ∧ (&quot;b&quot;∨&quot;c&quot;) = &quot;a&quot; ∧ (&quot;b&quot;∨&quot;a&quot;) = &quot;a&quot;

For the other direction, let the implication of the theorem hold in G. Let &quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot; be any elements in G, such that &quot;c&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot;. Let &quot;x&quot; = (&quot;a&quot;∧&quot;b&quot;) ∨ &quot;c&quot;, &quot;y&quot; = &quot;a&quot; ∧ (&quot;b&quot;∨&quot;c&quot;). From the modular inequality immediately follows that &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;. If we show that &quot;x&quot;∧&quot;b&quot; = &quot;y&quot;∧&quot;b&quot;, &quot;x&quot;∨&quot;b&quot; = &quot;y&quot;∨&quot;b&quot;, then using the assumption &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; must hold. The rest of the proof is routine manipulation with infima, suprema and inequalities.

== Diamond isomorphism theorem ==

For any two elements &quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot; of a modular lattice, one can consider the intervals [&quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] and [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot; ∨ &quot;b&quot;]. They are connected by order-preserving maps
::φ: [&quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] → [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot; ∨ &quot;b&quot;] and
::ψ: [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot; ∨ &quot;b&quot;] → [&quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]
that are defined by φ(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;a&quot; and ψ(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;y&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot;.

The composition ψφ is an order-preserving map from the interval [&quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] to itself which also satisfies the inequality ψ(φ(&quot;x&quot;)) = (&quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;a&quot;) ∧ &quot;b&quot; ≥ &quot;x&quot;. The example shows that this inequality can be strict in general. In a modular lattice, however, equality holds. Since the dual of a modular lattice is again modular, φψ is also the identity on [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot; ∨ &quot;b&quot;], and therefore the two maps φ and ψ are isomorphisms between these two intervals. This result is sometimes called the diamond isomorphism theorem for modular lattices. A lattice is modular if and only if the diamond isomorphism theorem holds for every pair of elements.

The diamond isomorphism theorem for modular lattices is analogous to the second isomorphism theorem in algebra, and it is a generalization of the lattice theorem.

==Modular pairs and related notions==

In any lattice, a modular pair is a pair (&quot;a, b&quot;) of elements such that for all &quot;x&quot; satisfying &quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;, we have (&quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;a&quot;) ∧ &quot;b&quot; = &quot;x&quot;, i.e. if one half of the diamond isomorphism theorem holds for the pair. An element &quot;b&quot; of a lattice is called a right modular element if (&quot;a, b&quot;) is a modular pair for all elements &quot;a&quot;, and an element &quot;a&quot; is called a left modular element if (&quot;a, b&quot;) is a modular pair for all elements &quot;b&quot;.

A lattice with the property that if (&quot;a, b&quot;) is a modular pair, then (&quot;b, a&quot;) is also a modular pair is called an M-symmetric lattice. Thus, in an M-symmetric lattice, every right modular element is also left modular, and vice-versa. Since a lattice is modular if and only if all pairs of elements are modular, clearly every modular lattice is M-symmetric. In the lattice &quot;N&quot;5 described above, the pair (&quot;b, a&quot;) is modular, but the pair (&quot;a, b&quot;) is not. Therefore, &quot;N&quot;5 is not M-symmetric. The centred hexagon lattice &quot;S&quot;7 is M-symmetric but not modular. Since &quot;N&quot;5 is a sublattice of &quot;S&quot;7, it follows that the M-symmetric lattices do not form a subvariety of the variety of lattices.

M-symmetry is not a self-dual notion. A dual modular pair is a pair which is modular in the dual lattice, and a lattice is called dually M-symmetric or M*-symmetric if its dual is M-symmetric. It can be shown that a finite lattice is modular if and only if it is M-symmetric and M*-symmetric. The same equivalence holds for infinite lattices which satisfy the ascending chain condition (or the descending chain condition).

Several less important notions are also closely related. A lattice is cross-symmetric if for every modular pair (&quot;a, b&quot;) the pair (&quot;b, a&quot;) is dually modular. Cross-symmetry implies M-symmetry but not M*-symmetry. Therefore, cross-symmetry is not equivalent to dual cross-symmetry. A lattice with a least element 0 is ⊥-symmetric if for every modular pair (&quot;a, b&quot;) satisfying &quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot; = 0 the pair (&quot;b, a&quot;) is also modular.

==History==
The definition of modularity is due to Richard Dedekind, who published most of the relevant papers after his retirement.
In a paper published in 1894 he studied lattices, which he called &quot;dual groups&quot; () as part of his &quot;algebra of modules&quot; and observed that ideals satisfy what we now call the modular law. He also observed that for lattices in general, the modular law is equivalent to its dual.

In another paper in 1897, Dedekind studied the lattice of divisors with gcd and lcm as operations, so that the lattice order is given by divisibility.
In a digression he introduced and studied lattices formally in a general context. He observed that the lattice of submodules of a module satisfies the modular identity. He called such lattices &quot;dual groups of module type&quot; (). He also proved that the modular identity and its dual are equivalent.

In the same paper, Dedekind also investigated the following stronger form of the modular identity, which is also self-dual:

: (&quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot;) ∨ (&quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot;) = [&quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;a&quot;] ∧ &quot;b&quot;.

He called lattices that satisfy this identity &quot;dual groups of ideal type&quot; (). In modern literature, they are more commonly referred to as distributive lattices. He gave examples of a lattice that is not modular and of a modular lattice that is not of ideal type.

A paper published by Dedekind in 1900 had lattices as its central topic: He described the free modular lattice generated by three elements, a lattice with 28 elements (see picture).

<text>Decaborane, also called decaborane(14), is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula B10H14. It is classified as a borane and more specifically a boron hydride cluster. This white crystalline compound is one of the principal boron hydride clusters, both as a reference structure and as a precursor to other boron hydrides. It is toxic and volatile, giving off a foul odor, like that of burnt rubber or chocolate.

==Handling, properties and structure==
The physical characteristics of decaborane(14) resemble those of naphthalene and anthracene, all three of which are volatile colorless solids. Sublimation is the common method of purification. Decaborane is highly flammable, and burns with a bright green flame like other boron hydrides. It is not sensitive to moist air, although it hydrolyzes in boiling water, releasing hydrogen and giving a solution of boric acid. It is soluble in cold water as well as a variety of non-polar and moderately polar solvents.

In decaborane, the B10 framework resembles an incomplete octadecahedron. Each boron atom has one &quot;radial&quot; hydride, and four boron atoms near the open part of the cluster feature extra bridging hydrides. In the language of cluster chemistry, the structure is classified as &quot;nido&quot;.

==Synthesis and reactions==
It is commonly synthesized via the pyrolysis of smaller boron hydride clusters. For example, pyrolysis of B2H6 or B5H9 gives decaborane, with loss of H2. On a laboratory scale, sodium borohydride is treated with boron trifluoride to give NaB11H14, which is acidified to release borane and hydrogen gas.

It reacts with Lewis bases (L) such as CH3CN and Et2S, to form adducts:
:B10H14 + 2 L → B10H12L2 + H2

These species, which are classified as &quot;arachno&quot; clusters, in turn react with acetylene to give the &quot;closo&quot; ortho-carborane:
:B10H12·2L + C2H2 → C2B10H12 + 2 L + H2

Decaborane(14) is a weak Brønsted acid. Monodeprotonation generates the anion [B10H13]−, with again a nido structure.

In the Brellochs reaction, decaborane is converted to arachno-CB9H14−:
:B10H14 + CH2O + 2 OH− + H2O → CB9H14− + B(OH)4− + H2

==Possible applications==
Decaborane has no significant commercial applications, although the compound has often been investigated. It and its derivatives were investigated as an additive to special high-performance rocket fuels. Its derivates were investigated as well, e.g. ethyl decaborane.

Decaborane is an effective reagent for the reductive amination of ketones and aldehydes.

Decaborane has been assessed for low energy ion implantation of boron in the manufacture of semiconductors. It has also been considered for plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition for the manufacture of boron-containing thin films. In fusion research, the neutron-absorbing nature of boron has led to the use of these thin boron-rich films to &quot;boronize&quot; the walls of the tokamak vacuum vessel to reduce recycling of particles and impurities into the plasma and improve overall performance. It has been evaluated in the context of nuclear fusion.

==Safety==
Decaborane, like pentaborane, is a powerful toxin affecting the central nervous system, although decaborane is less toxic than pentaborane. It can be absorbed through skin.

Purification by sublimation require a dynamic vacuum to remove evolved gases. Crude samples explode near 100 °C.

It forms an explosive mixture with carbon tetrachloride, which caused an often-mentioned explosion in a manufacturing facility.

In crystalline form, it reacts violently with red and white fuming nitric acid which has a use as rocket fuel oxidizer, producing an extremely powerful detonation.

<text>A request for information (RFI) is a common business process whose purpose is to collect written information about the capabilities of various suppliers. Normally it follows a format that can be used for comparative purposes.

An RFI is primarily used to gather information to help make a decision on what steps to take next. RFIs are therefore seldom the final stage and are instead often used in combination with request for proposal (RFP), request for tender (RFT), and request for quotation (RFQ). In addition to gathering basic information, an RFI is often used as a solicitation sent to a broad base of potential suppliers for the purpose of conditioning suppliers&#x27; minds, developing strategy, building a database, and preparing for an RFP, RFT, or RFQ.

An RFI may be &quot;open&quot;, where information is publicly gathered from anyone interested who wants to provide a submission, or &quot;closed&quot;, where parties are privately approached to provide information.

The ubiquitous availability of the Internet has made many government agencies turn either to state-run or vendor-operated websites which provide listings of RFIs as well as RFPs and RFQs. Many allow vendors to sign up at no charge to receive e-mails of requests either generally or for specific categories of product or service for which there is an interest. The entire process may be conducted online and collects responses as scanned documents or Portable Document Format (PDF) files uploaded to the server. Or for legal reasons, a response must be sent in hard copy form and/or on CD/DVD disc or USB flash drive by mail or delivery service.

==In the construction industry==
An RFI is used in the construction industry when a project&#x27;s construction documentation lacks information that is required to proceed with any given scope of work. It is raised by the general contractor that has been answered by the client, or architect, and distributed to all stakeholders, is generally accepted as a change to the scope of work unless further approval is required for costs associated with the change.

An RFI is common and accepted practice for a subcontractor or supplier to state his/her concern related to the omission or misapplication of a product, and seek further clarification of the building owner&#x27;s intended use or their official acceptance of the specified product. It is also acceptable for the subcontractor to use an RFI to call attention to an inferior product that may not meet the building owner&#x27;s needs, and use his/her expertise to recommend the better/correct product.

RFIs were for some years tracked using spreadsheets, but during the early 21st century many companies started using various construction management applications, including document management platforms, to manage RFI processes and help construction professionals save time, reduce costs, and improve quality.

Today, it is common for RFI management software to automatically track all activities related to RFIs and alert all personnel when there are status changes to help increase productivity and avoid construction delays.

== Extended components ==
The exact format of an RFI will vary depending on what information is being requested, but the most common elements found in a construction industry RFI include:
* Objective/Summary
* Timeline
* Storyboard or Screenshots
* Deliverables&quot;The bare minimum&quot;
* Evaluation criteria&quot;For any bonuses&quot;
* Payment terms

<doc id="1089321" wikidata="Q3110421" url="?curid=1089321" title="Steve Hofmeyr">
<text>Steve Hofmeyr (born 29 August 1964) is a South African singer, songwriter, writer, actor and former TV presenter.

==Personal life==
Hofmeyr married actress Natasha Sutherland whom he had met on the set of &quot;&quot; in 1998. They had two sons. Hofmeyr also has two sons and two daughters with other women. The couple was divorced after reports of numerous affairs dominated Hofmeyr&#x27;s time in the spotlight in 2008.

In December 2008, Hofmeyr allegedly assaulted Esmaré Weideman, editor of &quot;Huisgenoot&quot;, a popular Afrikaans magazine, by pouring a cup of cold tea over her at the Miss South Africa finals. He was said to have blamed her and two other journalists for his divorce from Sutherland. Weideman subsequently dropped her accusations of assault.

On 19 December 2013, Hofmeyr was arrested in Bronkhorstspruit for driving at 169 km/h in an 80 km/h zone and was released on bail of R500. He was subsequently fined R10,000 in the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate&#x27;s Court on 23 January 2014.

Hofmeyr married Janine van der Vyver on 26 January 2014. In 2008, van der Vyver, a fitness instructor, revealed they had been seeing each other for 10 years. Their daughter, Romy Lee, was born 19 June 2017.

Hofmeyr&#x27;s grandfather, Steve Hofmeyr Sr., was a leader in the Ossewabrandwag.

Hofmyer is also an outspoken Christian. He served the compulsory two years of military service required in South Africa at the time.

==Controversies==
===News Cafe Controversy===

In January 2007, there were reports that one branch of the News Cafe restaurant chain would not play Hofmeyr&#x27;s song &quot;Pampoen&quot;. The managing director of the company that owns the franchise denies that this is company policy and points out that many Afrikaans acts, such as Karen Zoid and Arno Carstens have performed at News Cafe.

===Racism===

On 12 May 2011, Hofmeyr released the lyrics to his new song called &quot;Ons sal dit oorleef&quot;, which means &quot;We will survive this&quot;. The song is controversial, because Hofmeyr threatened to include the ethnic slur &quot;kaffir&quot; in the lyrics of the song.
Hofmeyr removed the offensive word in his song, citing that the word would offend his black friends and colleagues.

In 2011, he made public that he supports the Afrikaner advocacy group &quot;Expedition for Afrikaner Self-Determination&quot; (Onafhanklike Afrikaner Selfbeskikkingsekspedisie, OASE).

Hofmeyr was heavily criticised after performing the former South African national anthem, &quot;Die Stem&quot;, at a cultural festival known as &quot;Innibos&quot; in Nelspruit in July 2014. He went on to perform the anthem on international tours, and encouraged white South Africans to continue singing it, stating that it did not contain any form of hate speech.

In October 2014, Hofmeyr wrote and published a tweet stating that he believed that black South Africans were the &quot;architects of apartheid&quot; on his public Twitter account. This prompted a significant public backlash. One of Hofmeyr&#x27;s critics was puppeteer Conrad Koch through his puppet Chester Missing, who launched a campaign calling on companies to stop sponsoring Hofmeyr. On 27 November 2014, Hofmeyr failed to acquire a final protection order against Koch and his puppet in the Randburg Magistrate&#x27;s Court.

Hofmeyr has given statements indicative of apartheid denialism, leading various journalists and political analysts to label him a &quot;disgrace to South Africa&quot;.

===Views on LGBTQ+===

Hofmeyr criticized Disney&#x27;s plan to have more inclusive characters, suggesting this was a way of teaching children &quot;bestiality&quot; and that the &quot;+” in LGBTQ+ could be inclusive of relationships with animals. The South African Human Rights Commission has set out demands for Hofmeyr to pay an amount of R500,000 to an NPO who fights for the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, post a formal apology to the LGBTQ+ community, serve 20 hours of community service at an LGBTQ+ center, and attend a workshop on diversity and inclusivity. As of October 2023 there is no evidence of Hofmeyr committing to such obligations.

===Claims about murders of white South Africans===

Hofmeyr has made numerous claims relating to murders of white South Africans. Hofmeyr has claimed that whites, and in particular Afrikaners, are being &quot;killed like flies&quot;, posting on Facebook that &quot;my tribe is dying&quot;. Hofmeyr also posted a picture of a &quot;World Cup soccer stadium&quot; which he claimed could be filled by the number of whites murdered by blacks. Africa Check, a fact-checking organisation has found Hofmeyr&#x27;s claims to be &quot;incorrect and grossly exaggerated&quot;, pointing out that whites are in fact &quot;less likely to be murdered than any other race group&quot;. Lizette Lancaster from the Institute for Security Studies told Africa Check that &quot;Whites are far less likely to be murdered than their black or coloured counterparts.&quot; While white South Africans account for nearly 9% of the population, they account for 1.8% of murder victims.

===Removal from MultiChoice networks===

On 30 April 2019, all content with Hofmeyr was removed from all MultiChoice networks, most notably DStv after Steve&#x27;s song &quot;Die Land&quot; (The Land) was removed from an award show category from Multichoice request. In response, Hofmeyr called for a boycott of Multichoice, calling for fans to destroy their DStv boxes.

Due to this, Afrikaans singers, including Bobby van Jaarsveld and Bok van Blerk boycotted a number of televised award shows and concerts in solidarity.

<text>Cadmium sulfate is the name of a series of related inorganic compounds with the formula CdSO4·H2O. The most common form is the monohydrate CdSO4·H2O, but two other forms are known CdSO4·H2O and the anhydrous salt (CdSO4). All salts are colourless and highly soluble in water.

==Structure, preparation, and occurrence==

X-ray crystallography shows that CdSO4·H2O is a typical coordination polymer. Each Cd2+ center has octahedral coordination geometry, being surrounded by four oxygen centers provided by four sulfate ligands and two oxygen centers from the bridging water ligands.

Cadmium sulfate hydrate can be prepared by the reaction of cadmium metal or its oxide or hydroxide with dilute sulfuric acid:
:
The anhydrous material can be prepared using sodium persulfate:

Cadmium sulfates occur as the following rare minerals drobecite (CdSO4·4H2O), voudourisite (monohydrate), and lazaridisite (the 8/3-hydrate).

==Applications==
Cadmium sulfate is used widely for the electroplating of cadmium in electronic circuits. It is also a precursor to cadmium-based pigment such as cadmium sulfide. It is also used for electrolyte in a Weston standard cell as well as a pigment in fluorescent screens.

<text>Euclase is a beryllium aluminium hydroxide silicate mineral (BeAlSiO4(OH)). It crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system and is typically massive to fibrous as well as in slender prismatic crystals. It is related to beryl (Be3Al2Si6O18) and other beryllium minerals. It is a product of the decomposition of beryl in pegmatites.

Euclase crystals are noted for their blue color, ranging from very pale to dark blue. The mineral may also be colorless, white, or light green. Cleavage is perfect, parallel to the , and this suggested to René Just Haüy the name euclase, from the Greek , easily, and , fracture. The ready cleavage renders the crystals fragile with a tendency to chip, and thus detracts from its use for personal ornament. When cut, it resembles certain kinds of beryl and topaz, from which it may be distinguished by its specific gravity (3.1). Its hardness (7.5) is similar to beryl (7.5 - 8), and a bit less than that of topaz (8).
It was first reported in 1792 from the Orenburg district in the southern Urals, Russia, where it is found with topaz and chrysoberyl in the gold-bearing gravels of the Sanarka (nowadays probably, Sakmara River, Mednogorsk district, Orenburgskaya Oblast&#x27;). Its type locality is Ouro Prêto, Minas Gerais, Southeast Region, Brazil, where it occurs with topaz. It is found rarely in the mica-schist of the Rauris in the Austrian Alps.

<text>The Franchi SPAS-15 is a dual-mode 12 gauge combat shotgun manufactured by the Italian company Luigi Franchi S.P.A.

==Design==

The weapon is based on the SPAS-12, and has similar pump-action/semi-automatic firing modes. In semi-automatic mode, a gas piston drives a bolt carrier and rotating bolt. In pump-action mode, the same components are driven by sliding the fore-end backwards. Pump-action mode is required to reliably fire low-pressure (less lethal) ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. Switching between firing modes is done by pressing a button above the foregrip, and sliding the foregrip slightly forwards or backwards. The barrel is chrome lined and features screw-in choke tubes.

Unlike its predecessor, the SPAS-15 is fed by a detachable box magazine. The gun features either a fixed black wooden stock or a side folding metal stock. Both had the same pistol grip safety. 

Additionally, a semi-auto only variant called SPAS-16 was manufactured in small numbers.

Amongst Italian troops the weapon is known by the nickname &quot;La Chiave dell&#x27;Incursore&quot; (the key of the commando) because it is used to blast the locks of closed doors.

==Legality==
In Italy, the SPAS-15 is a common weapon for both law enforcement and civilians.

In Canada, the SPAS-15 is classified as a Prohibited Weapon and cannot be legally owned or imported except under very limited circumstances.

In 1994, the United States banned the importation of the SPAS-15 with close to 180 shotguns imported, but later abolished the relevant regulations.

==Users==
*: Used by Grupo Alacrán.
*: Used by BOPE, BFEsp, Federal Highway Police and Military Police GRT unit. Small numbers were also acquired by Federal Police in 2002 but retired due to reliability issues.
*: National Security Guard.
*: 2,000 acquired in 1999 by the Italian Army. Also used by the Carabinieri.

<doc id="1089340" wikidata="Q419260" url="?curid=1089340" title="Witherite">
<text>Witherite is a barium carbonate mineral, BaCO3, in the aragonite group. Witherite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system and virtually always is twinned. The mineral is colorless, milky-white, grey, pale-yellow, green, to pale-brown. The specific gravity is 4.3, which is high for a translucent mineral. It fluoresces light blue under both long- and short-wave UV light, and is phosphorescent under short-wave UV light.

Witherite forms in low-temperature hydrothermal environments. It is commonly associated with fluorite, celestine, galena, barite, calcite, and aragonite. Witherite occurrences include: Cave-in-Rock, Illinois, US; Pigeon Roost Mine, Glenwood, Arkansas, US; Settlingstones Mine Northumberland; Alston Moor, Cumbria; Anglezarke, Lancashire and Burnhope, County Durham, England; Thunder Bay area, Ontario, Canada, Germany, and Poland (Tarnowskie Góry and Tajno at Suwałki Region).

Witherite was named after William Withering (1741–1799) an English physician and naturalist who in 1784 published his research on the new mineral. He could show that barite and the new mineral were two different minerals.

== Discovery ==
In 1789 the German geologist Abraham Gottlob Werner named the mineral witherite in honour of William Withering. The Matthew Boulton mineral collection of Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery may contain one of the earliest known specimens of witherite. A label in Boulton&#x27;s handwriting, records: &quot;No.2 Terra Ponderosa Aerata, given me by Dr. Withering&quot;.

==Risk to human health==

The 18th-century naturalist Dr. Leigh recorded its lethal effects after the death of a farmer&#x27;s wife and child. James Watt Jnr. experimented with the mineral on animals and he recorded the same lethal properties. Until the 18th century farmers at Anglezarke used the mineral as rat poison.

==Industrial use==

An experiment conducted by Josiah Wedgwood, led to it being used in his &#x27;Jasper ware&#x27;; the mineral had previously been considered as worthless.
Witherite has been used for hardening steel, and for making cement, glass, enamelware, soap, dye and explosives.

Witherite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system. The crystals are invariably twinned together in groups of three, giving rise to pseudo-hexagonal forms somewhat resembling bipyramidal crystals of quartz, the faces are usually rough and striated horizontally. It transforms into an hexagonal phase at 1084 K that changes into a cubic phase at 1254 K. The mineral is named after William Withering, who in 1784 recognized it to be chemically distinct from barytes. It occurs in veins of lead ore at Hexham in Northumberland, Alston in Cumbria, Anglezarke, near Chorley in Lancashire and a few other localities. Witherite is readily altered to barium sulfate by the action of water containing calcium sulfate in solution and crystals are therefore frequently encrusted with barytes. It is the chief source of barium salts and is mined in considerable amounts in Northumberland. It is used for the preparation of rat poison, in the manufacture of glass and porcelain, and formerly for refining sugar. It is also used for controlling the chromate to sulfate ratio in chromium electroplating baths.

<doc id="1089341" wikidata="Q521377" url="?curid=1089341" title="John Duncan Sr.">
<text>John James Duncan Sr. (March 24, 1919 – June 21, 1988) was an American attorney and Republican politician who represented Tennessee&#x27;s 2nd Congressional District in the U. S. House of Representatives from 1965 until his death in 1988. He also served as Mayor of Knoxville, Tennessee, from 1959 to 1964, and as assistant attorney general of Knox County, from 1948 until 1956. He is the father of Congressman John J. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Duncan, Jr., who succeeded him in Congress, and current Tennessee State Senator Becky Duncan Massey.

==Early life==
Duncan was born in Huntsville, Tennessee, the sixth of ten children of Cassie (Lee) and Flem Baird Duncan. After completing grade school in the Huntsville area and Hunstville High School, he won a $25 scholarship from Sears-Roebuck. He enrolled in the University of Tennessee in 1939, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science two years later.

Following the outbreak of World War II he joined the United States Army, serving from May 1942 to December 1945. While in the army, he served as a special agent in the Security and Intelligence Division with the same paygrade as a master sergeant. After the war, Duncan enrolled in Cumberland University&#x27;s law school, from which he graduated in June 1947. He became the state commander of the American Legion in 1954.

==Political career==
===Knox County prosecutor===
Following his graduation, Duncan returned to Knoxville, where he had accepted a position as assistant attorney general of Knox County. In late 1952, Duncan became embroiled in a local controversy when, as commander of the American Legion&#x27;s East Tennessee Division, he drafted a resolution condemning University of Tennessee&#x27;s film society for a planned showing of several films starring Charlie Chaplin, who had been accused of being a communist sympathizer. Reacting to the resolution, University of Tennessee president Cloide Brehm cancelled the event. The school&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Orange and White&quot;, nevertheless blasted Duncan&#x27;s accusations as &quot;nonsense.&quot;

===Mayor of Knoxville===
In 1959, Duncan was elected mayor of Knoxville in an election held to replace Mayor Jack Dance, who had died while in office. One of his first initiatives was to complete the overhaul of Market Square, which involved the demolition of the old Market House and its replacement by the Market Square Mall. In spite of opposition from historical interests, who wanted to preserve the Market House, Duncan pushed forward with the transition, and by mid-1960 the Market House had been removed.

Another contentious issue erupted in the Summer of 1960, when several black students from Knoxville College initiated a series of sit-ins to protest segregation at downtown-area lunch counters. With the backing of the Chamber of Commerce, Duncan formed a Good Will Committee, which encouraged downtown businesses to integrate their lunch counters. By July 1960, most downtown businesses had done away with their policies of segregation. Duncan&#x27;s early intervention in the crisis is often cited as one of the reasons Knoxville avoided the widespread integration-related violence that plagued other Southern cities during this period.

Like his predecessors, Duncan struggled to alleviate the city&#x27;s unemployment problem, which had been brought on by the closure of several textile mills and the shift of the city&#x27;s major retail centers to West Knoxville. Numerous companies expressed interest in relocating to Knoxville, but could not do so due to a lack of suitable industrial sites. Duncan proposed a bond issue to fund the preparation of a large industrial site, but met immediate opposition from the city&#x27;s conservative elements, which rejected government subsidies for business, and the bond proposal was defeated in a referendum.

===Congressional career===
In 1964, roughly 10 months into his second term as mayor, Duncan won a hard-fought Republican primary election in the Knoxville-based Second Congressional District. The district&#x27;s seven-term incumbent, Howard Baker Sr., had died that January, and his wife Irene held the seat for the rest of his term as a caretaker. Duncan was heavily favored due to his popularity as mayor of Knoxville and the heavy Republican tilt of the district. The 2nd had been one of the few areas of Tennessee where most residents supported the Union over the Confederacy. Its residents identified with the GOP soon after the return of peace, and have continued to support the Republicans through good times and bad ever since. As a result, the 2nd&#x27;s seat has been in the hands of the GOP or its predecessors without interruption since 1857. He defeated Democrat Willard Yarborough by just under 10 percentage points, the closest race in the district since Baker&#x27;s first run in 1950. The contest was closer than expected in part because the 2nd was nearly swept up in Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s national landslide in that year&#x27;s presidential election; Barry Goldwater just barely carried it.

Duncan never faced another close contest, and was reelected 11 times, including two unopposed runs in 1972 and 1982. He often won re-election by some of the largest majorities of any congressman. He was a member of the House Ways and Means Committee for much of his congressional career. A staunch conservative, he supported U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, and advocated tougher policies against antiwar demonstrators. Duncan voted against the Voting Rights Act of 1965 but in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. He was one of the first congressmen to endorse Richard Nixon for president in 1967.

In the late 1970s, Duncan engaged in a protracted legislative struggle with environmentalists over the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s construction of Tellico Dam, on the Little Tennessee River, in Duncan&#x27;s district. The dam&#x27;s completion had been halted over concerns for the endangered snail darter, which lived in the river. After numerous failed attempts to amend the Endangered Species Act to allow the dam&#x27;s completion, Duncan managed to insert a rider into the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act in July 1979, on a day when most House members were absent. The dam&#x27;s opponents cried foul, but the bill nevertheless passed the Senate and was signed into law, allowing TVA to finally close the dam&#x27;s gates.

Duncan served in the House until his death from prostate cancer in 1988.

==Personal life==
Duncan married Lois Swisher of Iowa City, Iowa in 1942. They had four children, including John J. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Duncan Jr., who won his father&#x27;s former congressional seat in the special election that followed his father&#x27;s death.

<text>Blanchinus is a lunar impact crater in the rugged south-central highlands of the Moon. It is named after Italian astronomer Giovanni Bianchini whose Latinized name is Blanchinus. Adjacent to its south is the crater Werner, and La Caille is attached to the northwest rim. To its west is the prominent formation Purbach.

Blanchinus&#x27; outer rim has been significantly degraded by subsequent impacts, leaving an irregular, notched exterior ring of rugged hills and ridges. The inner floor, in contrast, is nearly flat and free of significant impacts. Only a few tiny craterlets mark it, with Blanchinus M near the midpoint and the remainder near the southwest rim.

For a few hours before the first quarter, the crater&#x27;s rim contributes the lunar x visual phenomenon.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Blanchinus.

<doc id="1089349" wikidata="Q968105" url="?curid=1089349" title="Wild Gunman">
<text>is a light gun shooter game developed and published by Nintendo. Based an electro-mechanical arcade game in 1974 by Gunpei Yokoi, it was adapted to a video game for the Famicom console in 1984. It was released in 1985 as a launch game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) with the Zapper light gun.

==History==
===1974 arcade game===
&quot;Wild Gunman&quot; is one of Nintendo&#x27;s electro-mechanical (EM) arcade games created by Gunpei Yokoi and released in 1974. It consists of a light gun connected to a 16 mm projection screen. Full-motion video footage of an American Wild West gunslinger is projected onto the screen. When this enemy character&#x27;s eyes flash, the player draws and fires the gun. If the player is fast enough, the projection changes to that of the shot gunman falling down; otherwise it shows the gunman drawing and firing his gun. 

Regardless of their success, the player continues to face off against other gunslinger opponents, of which there are five in total. 

Should the player draw their gun prematurely, a &quot;foul&quot; light turns on and the player&#x27;s input is ignored for the rest of the duel, rendering it unwinnable. 

&quot;Wild Gunman&quot; was released in North America by Sega in 1976. The game&#x27;s footage was filmed with local, uncredited extras on location around Kyoto and at the Nara Dreamland amusement park.

The toy version has a plastic gunman figure mounted on top of a plastic battery box called &quot;Custom Gunman&quot;, which later became one of the microgames in the Game Boy Advance title &quot;WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!&quot;.

In Japan, &quot;Wild Gunman&quot; was the sixth highest-grossing EM arcade game of 1976, below two other Nintendo Laser Clay Shooting System titles, &quot;Sky Hawk&quot; at fourth place and &quot;Mini Laser Clay&quot; at fifth. In North America, &quot;Wild Gunman&quot; was one of the most popular arcade machines at the AMOA 1976 show.

The game consists of four film scenes, called Film-A, Film-B, Film-C and Film-D. Each scene was shot on two 16 mm film reels, for displaying alternate outcomes, making up a total of eight film reels. Two of the original reels were discovered by collector Benjamin Solovey in 2021.

===NES video game===
Nintendo adapted the electro-mechanical game into a video game, replacing filmed footage with cartoon-style sprites.

In 1984 in Japan, the Famicom version was released for use with the original version of the Zapper gun peripheral. This version, named the &quot;Beam Gun&quot;, was a plastic, western-style revolver accessory (modeled after the Colt Single Action Army) that came packaged with a plastic holster belt. In 1985 in the United States, it was released on the Nintendo Entertainment System.

== Gameplay ==

The player waits for the opponent&#x27;s eyes to flash (accompanied by a speech bubble reading &quot;FIRE!!&quot;) before shooting. It features a shooting gallery where opponents are to be shot from the windows of a saloon. A piece of Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Funeral march&quot; indicates the player&#x27;s defeat. This version was also published on the PlayChoice-10 arcade system. On the Wii U Virtual Console, the Wii Remote pointer is used instead of the Zapper.

==Popular culture==

Experimental filmmaker Craig Baldwin&#x27;s 1978 short &quot;Wild Gunman&quot; features footage from the original 1974 arcade game which was re-edited, sped up, and slowed down to surreal effect.

The 1974 arcade game also appears in the 1981 film &quot;Gas&quot;, being played by the main antagonist. The film establishes the antagonist&#x27;s ruthless cowboy-like personality by juxtaposing directly captured clips of the game with footage of him giving an expository monologue to his sons (and the audience) while playing. After delivering the monologue, he loses to a gunman and proceeds to shoot the game&#x27;s projector screen multiple times with a real gun. The game&#x27;s appearance is also a nod to the character&#x27;s actor, frequent western star Sterling Hayden.

In the 1989 film &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;, protagonist Marty McFly plays a non-existent arcade version of the NES &quot;Wild Gunman&quot; resembling a Nintendo VS. System cabinet. The 1990 follow-up, &quot;Part III&quot;, reveals that frequently playing the game has given Marty the skill to shoot a real revolver. Nintendo re-released the game to the Wii U Virtual Console on October 21, 2015, to coincide with &quot;Back to the Future&quot; Day, honoring the game&#x27;s appearance in the film.

In the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, the &quot;Duck Hunt&quot; duo can summon &quot;Wild Gunman&quot; characters to attack their opponents. Their &quot;Final Smash&quot; attack causes opponents to get caught in the middle of a shootout between the gunmen and the enemy characters from &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;.

<doc id="1089354" wikidata="Q410893" url="?curid=1089354" title="Tridymite">
<text>Tridymite is a high-temperature polymorph of silica and usually occurs as minute tabular white or colorless pseudo-hexagonal crystals, or scales, in cavities in felsic volcanic rocks. Its chemical formula is SiO2. Tridymite was first described in 1868 and the type location is in Hidalgo, Mexico. The name is from the Greek &quot;tridymos&quot; for &quot;triplet&quot; as tridymite commonly occurs as twinned crystal &quot;&quot; (compound crystals comprising three twinned crystal components).

==Structure==
Tridymite can occur in seven crystalline forms. Two of the most common at standard pressure are known as α and β. The α-tridymite phase is favored at elevated temperatures (above 870 °C) and it converts to β-cristobalite at 1,470 °C. However, tridymite does usually not form from pure β-quartz, one needs to add trace amounts of certain compounds to achieve this. Otherwise the β-quartz-tridymite transition is skipped and β-quartz transitions directly to cristobalite at 1,050 °C without occurrence of the tridymite phase.
In the table, M, O, H, C, P, L and S stand for monoclinic, orthorhombic, hexagonal, centered, primitive, low (temperature) and superlattice. T indicates the temperature, at which the corresponding phase is relatively stable, though the interconversions between phases are complex and sample dependent, and all these forms can coexist at ambient conditions. Mineralogy handbooks often arbitrarily assign tridymite to the triclinic crystal system, yet use hexagonal Miller indices because of the hexagonal crystal shape (see image).

==Mars==
In December 2015, the team behind NASA&#x27;s Mars Science Laboratory announced the discovery of large amounts of tridymite in Marias Pass on the slope of Aeolis Mons, popularly known as Mount Sharp, on the planet Mars. This discovery was unexpected given the rarity of the mineral on Earth and the apparent lack of volcanic activity where it was discovered, and at the time of discovery no explanation for how it was formed was forthcoming. Its discovery was serendipitous: two teams, responsible for two different instruments on the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover, both happened to report what in isolation were relatively uninteresting findings related to their instruments: the ChemCam team reported a region of high silica while the DAN team reported high neutron readings in what turned out to be the same area. Neither team would have been aware of the other&#x27;s findings had it not been for a fortuitous Mars conjunction in July 2015, during which the various international teams took advantage of the downtime to meet in Paris and discuss their scientific findings. 

DAN&#x27;s high neutron readings would normally have been interpreted as meaning the region was hydrogen-rich, and ChemCam&#x27;s high-silica readings were not surprising given the ubiquity of silica-rich deposits on Mars, but taken together it was clear that further study of the region was needed. Following conjunction, NASA directed the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover back to the area where the readings had been taken and discovered that large amounts of tridymite were present. How they were formed was unknown, .

<text>Thermonatrite is a naturally occurring evaporite mineral form of sodium carbonate, Na2CO3·H2O.

It was first described in 1845. Its name is from the Greek θερμός &quot;thermos&quot;, &quot;heat&quot;, plus &quot;natron&quot;, because it may be a dehydration product of natron.

Typical occurrence is in dry saline lake beds and as soil encrustations. It has been reported from volcanic fumaroles and in association with carbonatite-related veins. Common associated minerals include trona, natron and halite.

<text>Bose is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, in the southern sphere hemisphere. It lies just to the northwest of the smaller crater Bhabha, and southeast of Alder.

The outer rim of Bose has become worn and the edges rounded by impacts, although the shape of the wall is still well-preserved. The small satellite crater Bose D lies across the east-northeastern rim, and a smaller craterlet has impacted on the inner southeast wall. The inner floor is level with a low central peak offset slightly to the southeast of the midpoint. There are several tiny craterlets marking the interior, including three to the east of the central peak.

The crater is named after an eminent Indian polymath, Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose, for his works on wireless communication.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified in selenography by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bose.

<text>Aphthitalite is a potassium sulfate mineral with the chemical formula: (K,Na)3Na(SO4)2.

It was first described in 1835 for an occurrence on Mount Vesuvius, Italy. The name is from the Greek άφθητος, &quot;unalterable&quot;, and άλας, &quot;salt&quot;, for its stability in air. It occurs as fumarolic incrustations in volcanic environments, as small crystals and masses in evaporite deposits and in guano deposits. It occurs associated with thenardite, jarosite, sylvite and hematite in fumaroles; with blödite, syngenite, mirabilite, picromerite, borax and halite in evaporites; and with syngenite, whitlockite, monetite, niter and gypsum in guano deposits.

<text>Boyle is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the rugged far side of the Moon. It is adjacent to the larger crater Hess to the southeast, and lies about midway between the craters Alder to the north-northeast and Abbe to the south-southwest.

The outer rim of Boyle is nearly circular, and displays some slumping around the interior. Most of the rim is sharp-edged and displays little appearance of wear due to subsequent impacts. The southern rim, however, is overlain by a wide, irregular groove in the surface that follows a course from east to west along the rim. There is also an overlapping formation of tiny craterlets overlapping the narrow strip of terrain that joins Boyle to Hess.

The interior of the crater is relatively flat, with a long, low central ridge at the midpoint. This rise is aligned in a linear formation from southwest to northeast. There is a tiny craterlet near the eastern rim, but the interior is otherwise undistinguished.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Boyle.

His &quot;paternal grandparents were small-acreage farmers in Scott County, which in 1861 left Tennessee, refusing to follow the Volunteer State into the Confederacy, and declared itself &#x27;the Free and Independent state of Scott.&#x27;&quot; Duncan&#x27;s parents were Lois (Swisher) and John Duncan Sr., who &quot;hitchhiked into Knoxville with five dollars in his pocket,&#x27; and after an education at the University of Tennessee was elected mayor of Knoxville and then congressman.&quot; The elder Duncan was also a co-owner of the Knoxville Smokies of the &quot;Sally League,&quot; for which his son &quot;was a batboy, a ball shagger, scoreboard operator, and, as a freshman at the University of Tennessee, the Smokies&#x27; public-address announcer.&quot; Duncan also worked as a grocery bagger and salesman at Sears while working his way through school. Duncan supported Barry Goldwater&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign, and sent the first paycheck he earned as a bag boy at the local A&amp;P to the Goldwater campaign.

Duncan graduated from Holston High School in Knoxville, Tennessee. He completed his college course work at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville in 1969 with a Bachelor of Journalism degree and subsequently received a Juris Doctor degree from George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C. in 1973 and was admitted to the bar that same year. He also served in the Army National Guard from 1970 to 1987. He was an attorney in private practice until he became a state court judge for the Criminal Court in Knox County, Tennessee following an appointment by Lamar Alexander. Hee served as Criminal Court judge from 1981 to 1988.

Duncan also served in the Army National Guard from 1970 to 1987, obtaining the ultimate rank of captain.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Duncan&#x27;s father, John Sr., who had represented the Knoxville, Tennessee based 2nd District since 1965, died in June 1988. Jimmy Duncan won the Republican nomination to succeed him. He ran in and won two elections on November 8, 1988. The first election being a special election for the balance of his father&#x27;s 12th term, followed by a regular election for a full two-year term following his father&#x27;s term. He was re-elected every two years from then until his retirement from a district that had been held continuously by Republicans (or their antecedents) since 1859, and by a Duncan since his father was first elected in 1964.

He won reelection fourteen times (1990-2016), generally garnering above 70% of the total vote each time. He never faced a serious or well-funded challenge for reelection, and was reelected without major-party opposition in four consecutive elections (1994 through 2000). For four the general elections from 1990 to 2000 Duncan&#x27;s primary challenger came from an independent candidate or a member of the Libertarian Party. On the occasions he did face major-party opposition, he only dropped below 70% of the vote twice, during the special and regular elections in 1988, while surpassing the 80% threshold 5 times and once exceeding 90% of the total vote.

In 2017, he announced he would not seek re-election in the 2018 election for Tennessee&#x27;s 2nd District, and would instead retire. His eventual replacement Tim Burchett, who was the Knox County, Tennessee Mayor at the time announced his intention to run for the seat shortly thereafter.

===Tenure===

Duncan voted against authorizing the 2003 War in Iraq based on opposition to what he believed to be an unnecessary foreign involvement. He also opposed and voted against a June 2006 House declaration in support of the war. He was one of the most conservative Republicans to do so. Duncan later remarked that the Iraq War vote had been

Duncan was among only six Republicans to vote against funding for the Iraq War on May 24, 2007. Duncan voted, along with three other Republicans, to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq by April 2008 on July 12, 2007.

On March 10, 2010, Duncan again joined three other Republicans in voting for the removal of troops from Afghanistan. Duncan and Ron Paul were the only members of Congress to vote for the removal of troops from Afghanistan and against all recent bailout and stimulus bills.

He has criticized neoconservatism and supports a non-interventionist foreign policy.

Duncan was a member of the Liberty Caucus, a group of libertarian-minded congressional Republicans. Other members included Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland, Scott Garrett of New Jersey, and Jeff Flake of Arizona. A former neighbor of his district, Zach Wamp of the 3rd district, also belonged to the group during his tenure in the House.

Duncan voted against the Wall Street bailout. In a column he explained his vote stating he &quot;thought it would be better in the long run not to adopt the socialist approach.&quot; The American Conservative Union gave Duncan a 96% score for his voting record in 2013, higher than any other federal Representative in Congress from Tennessee.

The Family Research Council has rated Duncan as a 92% or above since 2002 and the NRA Political Victory Fund has rated him in equally positive terms. In 2012, Duncan received the number one spot in the 435-member House in the National Taxpayers Union&#x27;s (NTU) annual ranking of Congress, earning him the &quot;Taxpayer Hero&quot; award.

Duncan is a frequent contributor to &quot;Chronicles&quot; and &quot;The American Conservative,&quot; both magazines associated with the paleoconservative movement. He has also contributed to numerous trade publications and Capitol Hill newspapers. Duncan has also voiced public support for returning the gold standard.

In April 2016, Duncan endorsed Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.

On 5 January 2017, he was one of only four Republicans to oppose the House&#x27;s resolution 11 condemning the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334.

===Controversies===
In February 2017, Duncan refused to hold any town halls in his district after the election of then recently inaugurated President Donald Trump. Duncan said that he preferred one-on-one meetings rather than town halls, adding that he was not willing to give a platform to &quot;extremists, kooks and radicals.&quot;

===Misuse of campaign funds===
Duncan was accused of misuse of campaign funds for using them to pay his son almost $300,000 over the course of five years, for work not done or for fees that were too high. Duncan denied the charges.

However his son, John Duncan III (R) a Knox County Trustee, pled guilty to a felony charge of official misconduct for handing out bonuses to his own staff for training they had not received. Duncan III resigned from office and was given one year of probation. His charges are now expunged.

<text>The Derby Canal ran from the Trent and Mersey Canal at Swarkestone to Derby and Little Eaton, and to the Erewash Canal at Sandiacre, in Derbyshire, England. The canal was authorised by an act of Parliament, the Derby Canal Act 1793 (33 Geo. 3. c. 102) and was fully completed in 1796. It featured a level crossing of the River Derwent in the centre of Derby. An early tramroad, known as the Little Eaton Gangway, linked Little Eaton to coal mines at Denby. The canal&#x27;s main cargo was coal, and it was relatively successful until the arrival of the railways in 1840. It gradually declined, with the gangway closing in 1908 and the Little Eaton Branch in 1935. Early attempts at restoration were thwarted by the closure of the whole canal in 1964. Since 1994, there has been an active campaign for restoration spearheaded by the Derby and Sandiacre Canal Trust and Society. Loss of the Derwent crossing due to development has resulted in an innovative engineering solution called the Derby Arm being proposed, as a way of transferring boats across the river.

==Origin==
Although the River Derwent had been used for transport from the Trent since ancient times, it was winding and shallow in many places, silting frequently. The right to use it for navigation was conferred upon the citizens of Derby by King John in 1204. The engineer George Sorocold was involved with plans for improvements, although it is uncertain whether he was involved in the actual work. Plans had been first proposed in 1664, and bills had been presented to Parliament in 1696 and 1698. In 1703, Sorocold attended Parliament to give evidence for a scheme which involved four new cuts, with weirs and locks, on a stretch of the river. The bill failed, but the map for a similar scheme presented in 1717 was said to be drawn by Sorocold. This became the Derwent Navigation Act in 1720, and the work enabled boats to reach Derby in January 1721, but it was still difficult to navigate in periods of flood or dry weather. Indeed the Trent itself was little better.

In 1770, James Brindley had brought the Trent and Mersey Canal to the Trent near Shardlow. He proposed a canal from Swarkestone through Derby to join the Chesterfield Canal, but he was resisted by the Derwent Navigation and the Trent Navigation companies, and the matter was not raised again until 1791. Two schemes were then proposed by rival groups, one from Swarkestone to Derby, and the other from Derby to the Trent and Mersey Canal at Shardlow. By August 1792, the first scheme had grown to include a branch to Smithy House near Denby, another to Newhall and Swadlincote, and a third to Cheadle in Staffordshire, following a route through Sudbury and Uttoxeter. When Benjamin Outram was asked to carry out surveys later that year, it had been reduced to a more sensible size, and he estimated that the construction of a broad canal from Swarkestone to Smithy Houses, with a branch from Derby to the Erewash Canal at Sandiacre, including the purchase of the Derwent Navigation Company, would cost £60,000
(equivalent to £ million in ).

The costs of the length from Derby to Denby would account for a third of this, and the plan included an aqueduct across the River Derwent at Derby, costing £8,160. Initially Outram suggested a narrow canal as an alternative. William Jessop was asked to give his opinion and he suggested a tramway from Little Eaton to Denby. This, the &quot;Derby Canal Railway,&quot; but known locally, as the Little Eaton Gangway, was therefore one of the first to be publicly subscribed, and would save the construction of six locks.

Outram also proposed to save some £4,000 by dispensing with the aqueduct and, instead, building a weir to raise the river level to form a basin adjacent to the Morledge, with locks connecting it to each branch of the canal. A bridge would carry the towpath across the basin. A small aqueduct would still be needed to cross the mill race on the west side of the Holmes.

==Construction==

The bill was passed by Parliament in 1793 by a narrow majority in the face of strong opposition from the Trent and Mersey Canal and the Erewash Canal owners who had a scheme of their own. It became the (33 Geo. 3. c. 102).

Work commenced with the Little Eaton branch and the gangway, followed by the Sandiacre line. This began with a small basin under what is now St. Alkmund&#x27;s Way, proceeding eastwards following a line south of the Nottingham Road. A short branch from the basin led via Phoenix lock to the river above a weir at St. Mary&#x27;s Bridge, which gave access to the Darley Abbey mills. These were located some upstream from the bridge. By 1904, the river was only used for the first , up to the Great Northern Railway bridge, according to Bradshaw&#x27;s Guide.

The Sandiacre line followed the course of the old Nottingham Road with two locks near Borrowash, then level through Draycott and Breaston, and descending through two locks to Sandiacre Junction with the Erewash Canal, a distance of . The Little Eaton line branched northwards at the boundary of the racecourse, passing to the east of Chester Green, parallel to and east of the present day railway. The canal from Derby to Little Eaton was opened on 11 May 1795, the first load of coal from Denby being distributed to the poor of Derby. The Sandiacre line was opened on 30 May 1795.

Work then began on the crossing of the Derwent, followed by the line out to Swarkestone. From the small weir mentioned above a canal led through what is now Darwin Place to the Derwent Basin above the weir in the river which still exists behind the Council House, downstream of the Exeter Bridge. A timber causeway was built on trestles for use as the towpath. The weir also contained a culvert which transferred water between two branches, for a distance of about .

From the basin the canal fell into a lock before crossing the mill race (which still runs beside Bass&#x27;s Recreation Ground) by way of the cast-iron aqueduct arriving at Gandy&#x27;s Wharf roughly where the Cockpit island is now.

It followed the line of the mill race before passing behind what became the Locomotive Works (now Pride Park), before turning sharply southwards towards Chellaston descending through Shelton and Fullen&#x27;s locks. It joined the Trent and Mersey Canal at Swarkestone Junction, a distance of from Derby. A short extension led on to the River Trent just upstream from Swarkestone Bridge. The route from Derby to Swarkestone was opened on 30 June 1796.

==History==
The Little Eaton gangway was built using cast iron plates, initially weighing 28 lb per yard (13.9 kg/m) although this was increased to 40 lb per yard (19.8 kg/m) for plates made after 1804. By 1825, there were nine passing places on the single-track line, which carried 2-ton waggons. Each waggon carried a box of coal, with a load of between 1.65 and 1.87 tons, which was transferred to a barge at Little Eaton wharf by a crane. From Smithy Houses, several private lines served the Denby Main colliery and other mines in the locality. Further extensions were made in the 1820s, by which time there were around of tramroad.

The Holmes Aqueduct proved to be extremely troublesome. Aqueducts up to that time had been made of stone, but several short arches would have been necessary, causing obstruction to the flow of the stream. The single-span cast iron structure that Outram devised, and completed in 1796, was the first of its kind, as it was completed a few weeks earlier than Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct, the structure by Thomas Telford at Longdon-on-Tern on the Shrewsbury Canal.

In 1802 there was a partial failure, probably due to the sides bowing and transferring too much weight to the base where they joined to the deck. After remedial work it failed again in 1812 and was reinforced with timber baulks. Although plans were prepared for replacement in stone, it survived until 1930, when the bottom plates were replaced by a wooden base, which was sealed by puddling.

In 1817 the link between the River Trent and the Trent and Mersey Canal was closed because of its lack of financial success. Maintenance charges had exceeded revenue since 1812, as it was little used because the Trent and Mersey canal charged compensation tolls at extortionate rates for boats using the link. Twenty years later it was dry.
In 1838 the canal was diverted away from the River Derwent at Borrowash to allow construction of the Midland Counties Railway line between Derby and Long Eaton. This diversion included building a new Borrowash Top Lock.

The canal was relatively successful before the arrival of railways. Traffic figures are scarce, but in 1798, 28,571 tons of coal were recorded, of which 40 per cent came from the Little Eaton gangway. By 1803 this had risen to 50,374 tons, with 55 per cent from the gangway. Rather than it just supplying Derby, the company encouraged through trade on the canal, and this contributed to its profitability. Regular dividends were paid to shareholders from 1811, although some had been paid in previous years. Initially, they were close to the 5 per cent promised by the original Derby Canal Act 1793, but reached 12 per cent in 1839. Although this exceeded the amount specified by the act, it was justified as covering years where the 5 per cent had not been made. Traffic figures for February and March 1839 indicate that the Little Eaton line carried 13,332 tons, the Sandiacre line carried 15,725 tons, and 9,773 tons were carried on the Swarkestone line. This would suggest that the total for the year was around 200,000 tons.

==Decline==
In 1830 the company considered building a locomotive line from Derby to Smithy Houses, and two years later looked at the possibility of a locomotive line from Derby to Little Eaton. The first was surveyed by an engineer called Stephenson, presumed to be George Stephenson, but no further action was taken. Toll reductions were made from 1834, in an attempt to stay competitive, but by 1840 there were three main line railways in Derby. By 1845, tolls on the Little Eaton line were less than half what they had been five years earlier. The Derby and Gainsborough Company wanted to buy the Little Eaton line in 1846, and were quoted £30,000, as were the Midland Railway in 1847. Instead, they built a parallel line to Ripley, which opened in 1855.

Receipts fell from £8,180 to £2,556 between 1838 and 1868, and dividends for the same period fell from 10.5 per cent to 4 per cent. An attempt was made in 1872 to sell the whole canal to the Midland Railway for £90,000, without success, and a similar offer to the London and North Western Railway also failed. Traffic suffered further decline when Butterley Tunnel on the neighbouring Cromford Canal had to be closed. The Little Eaton gangway was closed in 1908, ten years after the action was first considered, and the Little Eaton branch followed on 4 July 1935, when the company obtained a warrant for its closure. Attempts to close the Sandiacre line in 1937 were thwarted by objections from Imperial Chemical Industries. Commercial traffic on the remainder of the canal ceased in 1945. In 1964 the canal company gained permission to close the rest of the canal. Over the next three decades, areas of the canal were built on while others were allowed to decay.

==Restoration==
In view of proposals to abandon the canal, B. A. Mallender, who lived in the locality, asked the fledgling Inland Waterways Association to help mount a campaign for its revival in 1947. The author Tom Rolt made a series of cruises on threatened waterways at this time, but could not obtain permission to navigate the Derby Canal. Rolt took his case to the Ministry of Transport, seeking to invoke the conditions of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1888 (51 &amp; 52 Vict. c. 25), but was told that they would not sanction an inspection of the canal, because the company had intimated that they were preparing to restore the waterway. In 1956 a local committee was formed to campaign for restoration. By 1961, Derby Council were actively promoting the infilling of the canal, and so the Inland Waterways Association together with the Derby Canal Restoration Committee wrote to the &quot;Derby Evening Telegraph&quot;, calling for the canal&#x27;s restoration. Although the council refused to comment, the letter, which was published on 1 February 1961, caused considerable local debate, and a protest cruise was organised on the Erewash Canal, with the Derby Canal entrance lock as the destination. &quot;The Times&quot; national newspaper carried details of the event, and a subsequent meeting held on 27 May called for a public enquiry into how best to restore the canal for commercial and amenity use. Despite the campaigns, the company obtained a warrant to abandon the whole canal in 1964.

With the changed economic climate of the 1990s and the success of other restoration schemes, a feasibility study was carried out in 1994. It included detailed plans for restoration, and concluded that the cost for reinstating the main line would be £17.3 million. To make progress, a company called the Derby and Sandiacre Canal Trust was formed, with volunteer input managed by the Derby and Sandiacre Canal Society. In early 1996, construction of the Derby Bypass threatened to sever the line at Swarkestone, although the Department of Transport suggested that a navigable culvert could be provided if the Canal Society paid for it. In 2000, Derby Council assisted the canal trust in applying for a £3.2 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, to create a linear park by restoring the canal from Spondon to Sandiacre, while the canal was identified as one of several projects which British Waterways thought they could assist, at its annual general meeting held in 2001.

By mid-2003, the canal trust has succeeded in getting the whole route of the canal protected by inclusion in the local council structure plans. By this time, the estimated cost of restoration had risen to £34 million, but they launched a major initiative to raise the funding over a 10-year period. Grants from the Derbyshire City Partnership received from 2008 enabled the Trust Development Group to begin the process of applying for outline planning permission for reinstatement. The route of the canal passes through three local council regions, and so separate applications had to be made to Derby City Council, Erewash Borough Council and South Derbyshire District Council. All three applications had been approved by 24 August 2011, paving the way for actual reinstatement to begin, subject to the necessary funding being available. The restoration plans do not include reinstatement of a level crossing of the River Derwent. The site of the original crossing has been lost to development, and there would be issues with water supply and flood risk associated with a crossing on the level. An innovative solution has been suggested in the form of the Derby Arm, which would transport a caisson containing water and a boat in a semi-circular arc from one side of the river to the other. Its design is similar to a medieval trebuchet.

Plans for the restoration were threatened in 2013 when the route of High Speed 2, a high-speed rail link from London to Birmingham, Manchester and York, were published. This envisaged an East Midlands Hub station at Toton, which would have destroyed part of the canal route, but revised plans were published on 15 November 2016, with the station moved to avoid the canal. The chairman of the Derby and Sandiacre Canal Trust, Chris Madge, was still concerned that a tramway to link the station to Derby would impinge upon the canal, but was hopeful that the canal in this area could be reopened before tramway construction began, and that the plans for the tramway would therefore have to accommodate the canal.

==The canal today==
From Swarkestone the line of the canal can be followed into Derby as far as Wilmorton although the only recognisable canal features are the chambers of Fullen&#x27;s and Shelton Locks and the bridges under Chellaston Road (pictured) and London Road. Route 6 of the National Cycle Network (NCN 6) follows this part of the canal.

Although traces of the canal through Derby city centre remained until well into the twentieth century (the ice factory on what was the Cockpit island drew its water from the canal), it has all been covered by development, mainly the inner ring road and Pride Parkway. New building at Pride Park has obliterated all traces of the canal in that area.

The weir built across the river to form the Derwent Basin still exists behind the Council House, downstream of the Exeter Bridge, and the timber causeway on trestles, which was used as the towpath, remained until 1959. The Holmes Aqueduct was removed in 1971, and after a period in storage at a council depot, was sold for scrap.

The remains of the towpath are visible at a bridge under the railway immediately north of Derby railway station. An unused span of the railway bridge over Old Nottingham Road once crossed the canal. Steel girders set into the kerb edge of Old Nottingham Road near its junction with Stores Road are the remains of a bridge over the Little Eaton line. The Little Eaton line and the gangway have also disappeared, apart from the Wharf Building at Little Eaton, in the present day trading estate, and a couple of bridges. The clock house is a grade II listed structure, built for the canal&#x27;s agent at the junction between the canal and the Little Eaton gangway. It is an L-shaped building, constructed of red bricks with a tiled roof in about 1795.

The A52 Brian Clough Way was built upon the canal between the Pentagon and Spondon. From Spondon the line can be traced to Sandiacre. NCN 6 uses the canal route between Borrowash and Breaston. One of the few original bridges is situated between the A6005 Derby Road and the railway at Borrowash. It is constructed of red brick with stone dressings, and is grade II listed. The lock-keepers cottage at Sandiacre Lock also dates from around the time of the opening of the canal, and although it has additional windows added in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, most of it is original.

<doc id="1089403" wikidata="Q1096555" url="?curid=1089403" title="Claude Brinegar">
<text>Claude Stout Brinegar (December 16, 1926 – March 13, 2009) was the third United States Secretary of Transportation, serving from February 2, 1973, to February 1, 1975. Holding a PhD from Stanford University in economic research, Brinegar had previously been an oil company executive. Brinegar was Secretary of Transportation during the 1973 oil crisis.

==Early life and education==
Claude Brinegar was born Claude Rawles Stout on December 16, 1926, to Lyle Rawles Stout and Claude Leroy Stout in Rockport, California, a small lumber town on the coast, 25 miles north of Fort Bragg. After her husband abandoned her and her toddler, Lyle Stout got a teaching job on an Indian reservation. Following her marriage, in 1932, to Butler Brinegar, the boy had a disjointed education, attending a different school each year as his stepfather moved around Northern California for jobs with the Works Progress Administration and other agencies. He legally took his stepfather&#x27;s last name in 1951. He served in the United States Army, 1945–47, then attended Stanford University, where he received a B.A. in Economics with Great Distinction (1950), an M.S. in Mathematics and Statistics (1951), and a Ph.D. in economic research (1953). He was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa. While pursuing his Ph.D., Mr. Brinegar was a research assistant with the Food Research Institute in Stanford, California, and an Economic Consultant to the Emporium-Capwell Corporation in San Francisco, California.

Brinegar joined the Union Oil Company (later called Unocal Corporation) in 1953 as an economic analyst and held several positions in economics, planning and research until 1965, when he was elected vice president for corporate planning. In October 1965, Union Oil and the Pure Oil Company merged. Brinegar was appointed president of Pure Oil and remained in that position when Pure became Union 76. He was also elected senior vice president of the firm and a member of Union Oil&#x27;s board of directors and executive committee.

==Political life==
Brinegar was nominated to the post of United States Secretary of Transportation by Richard Nixon. Dr. Brinegar was the third person to take the post of Secretary of Transportation and followed John A. Volpe, a former governor in Massachusetts. Brinegar had never held political office before taking this post, but cited his education and experience as a consumer as credentials that made him suitable for the job. He was quoted “I&#x27;ve flown a million miles in the last seven years, and I&#x27;ve sat on the Harbor Freeway for hours in traffic jams”, implying that his firsthand knowledge of the issues regarding transportation would help him find effective solutions. He also served under Gerald Ford, but when Ford announced he intended to seek the presidency, Brinegar resigned and returned to an executive position at Union Oil. In 1980–81, Brinegar was on Ronald Reagan&#x27;s transition team.

===1973 oil crisis===
Brinegar was Secretary of Transportation during the Arab oil embargo in 1973 and was tasked with mitigating the crisis during this period. He passed the Emergency Highway Conservation Act with president Nixon which set a speed limit of 55 miles an hour on all highways in order to reduce oil usage. During this time Brinegar also promoted carpooling nationwide in order to help reduce oil usage. Another of Brinegar&#x27;s chief legislative accomplishments was the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1973, which allocated federal funds for states to improve and maintain their highways.

==Death==

Brinegar died of natural causes aged 82 at a retirement home in Palo Alto, California, on March 13, 2009. He is survived by his wife, three children, and four grandchildren.

<text>The Montour Railroad was a short line railroad company operating passenger and freight service in southwestern Pennsylvania. At its height in the 1930s, the railroad served 27 mines transporting nearly seven million tons of coal annually in Allegheny and Washington Counties.

== History ==
The Montour Railroad Company was chartered in 1877 as a wholly owed subsidiary of the Imperial Coal Company. The first segment constructed extended from the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad line at Montour Junction, near Coraopolis, Pennsylvania to the Imperial Coal Company mines at Imperial, Pennsylvania. In 1901 the Pittsburgh Coal Company assumed control of the railroad. A major expansion was undertaken in 1912 to reach new coal mines and factories. By 1914 the railroad reached the town of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania on the Monongahela River. The Montour Railroad became an important feeder line and eventually all five major railroads in the southwestern Pennsylvania market were linked to the Montour Railroad. In 1946 the Pittsburgh Coal Company sold the Montour Railroad to the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad (a subsidiary of the New York Central Railroad), who operated it jointly. A branch served Moon Run, this segment being operated until 1936. The P&amp;LE acquired sole control of the Montour Railroad in 1975.

The railroad&#x27;s engine houses and shops were at Montour Junction, near the Ohio River at Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. The Montour Railroad had passenger service in its early years from 15 stations along its route, but passenger service was discontinued in 1927. By the 1950s most of the coal mines the Montour serviced had been worked out and the Montour began a slow decline. The Montour Railroad was down to just of track between Montour Junction and Gilmore Junction when operations ceased in 1984 with the closing of the Westland Coal mine, the Montour’s last remaining major customer. In the 1990s large portions of the right of way were acquired by the Montour Trail Council in a rails-to-trails program.

In 1944 Montour reported 159 million ton-miles of revenue freight; at the end of that year it operated of road and of track.

=== Westland Branch ===
The Westland Branch was opened in 1928 to serve Westland Mine #1. Later, Westland Mine #2 was opened, and the Montour was extended to serve it. Westland #1 closed in 1981. The #2 mine was the last operating mine served by the Montour, finally closing in 1983, and demolished in 1985. In December 2010 MarkWest Energy announced plans to lease the Westland Branch right of way from the Montour Trail Council for 30 years. The branch was redeveloped as a combination trail and railroad operated by the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway to serve MarkWest&#x27;s Westland natural gas processing plant. Construction was completed and the branch began operation in August 2012.

=== Preservation ===
In 2019, the Montour Railroad&#x27;s SW9 locomotive #82 was acquired by the Age of Steam Roundhouse from the Flats Industrial Railroad, restored to its original condition, and painted into Montour colors. Later, Montour 84, another SW9, received the same treatment.

<text>Up Against the Wall Motherfucker, often shortened as The Motherfuckers or UAW/MF, was a Dadaist and Situationist anarchist affinity group based in New York City. This &quot;street gang with analysis&quot; was famous for its Lower East Side direct action.

==History==
The Motherfuckers grew out of a Dada-influenced art group called Black Mask with some additional people involved with the anti-Vietnam War Angry Arts week, held in January 1967. Formed in 1966 by Ben Morea, a painter of Catalan origins, and the poet Dan Georgakas, Black Mask produced a broadside of the same name and declared that revolutionary art should be &quot;an integral part of life, as in primitive society, and not an appendage to wealth&quot;. In May 1968, Black Mask changed its name and went underground. Their new name, Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers, came from a poem by Amiri Baraka. Abbie Hoffman characterized them as &quot;the middle-class nightmare... an anti-media phenomenon simply because their name could not be printed&quot;.

* 1967 – Forced their way into The Pentagon during an anti-war protest.
* 1967 – Flung blood, eggs and stones at U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk who was attending a Foreign Policy Association event in New York.
* January, 1968 – &quot;Assassinated&quot; poet Kenneth Koch (using blanks).
* February, 1968 - Dumped uncollected refuse from the Lower East Side into the fountain at Lincoln Center on the opening night of a gala &quot;bourgeois cultural event&quot; during a NYC garbage strike (an event documented in the Newsreel film &quot;Garbage&quot;).
* 1968 – Organized and produced free concert nights in the Fillmore East after successfully demanding that owner Bill Graham give the community the venue for a series of weekly free concerts. These &quot;Free Nights&quot; were short-lived as the combined forces of NY City Hall, the police, and Graham terminated the arrangement.
* December 12, 1968 - Created a ruckus at the Boston Tea Party: after the MC5 opened for the Velvet Underground one of the Motherfuckers got on stage and started haranguing the audience, directing them to &quot;...burn this place down and take to the streets...&quot;. This got &quot;The Five&quot; banned from the venue.
* December 18, 1968 - Rioted at an MC5 show at the Fillmore East. Some &quot;beat (Graham) with a chain and broke his nose&quot;. This got the Detroit band banned from all venues controlled by Graham and his friends.
* Cut the fences at Woodstock, allowing thousands to enter for free.

==Associations==
Valerie Solanas, a radical feminist and would-be assassin of Andy Warhol, was friends with Morea and associated with the Motherfuckers. In the film &quot;I Shot Andy Warhol&quot;, the gun used in her attack is alleged to have been taken from Morea.

When Morea was asked in a 2005 interview by John McMillian of &quot;The New York Press&quot; how he had been able to rationalize supporting Solanas, Morea replied, &quot;Rationalize? I didn&#x27;t rationalize anything. I loved Valerie and I loathed Andy Warhol, so that&#x27;s all there was to it.&quot; He then added &quot;I mean, I didn&#x27;t want to shoot him.&quot; He then added: &quot;Andy Warhol ruined art.&quot;

Prior to becoming the Motherfuckers, the Situationist International accepted Morea&#x27;s group as its New York chapter.

==Influence as a slogan==
The phrase was taken from the poem, &quot;Black People!&quot; by Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones): &quot;The magic words are: Up against the wall, mother fucker, this is a stick up!&quot; This, in turn, was a reference to a phrase &quot;supposedly barked by Newark cops to Negroes under custody.&quot; The poem had appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1968 and Mark Rudd, an organizer for Columbia University&#x27;s Students for a Democratic Society, provocatively quoted the line in an open letter to the university president.

Most of the lyrics for the 1969 song &quot;We Can Be Together&quot;, by the acid rock band Jefferson Airplane, were taken virtually word-for-word from a leaflet written by Motherfucker John Sundstrom, and published as &quot;The Outlaw Page&quot; in the &quot;East Village Other&quot;. The lyrics read in part, &quot;We are all outlaws in the eyes of America. In order to survive we steal, cheat, lie, forge, fuck, hide, and deal... Everything you say we are, we are... Up Against the Wall, Motherfucker!&quot; The song marked the first use of the word &quot;fuck&quot; on U.S. television, when the group played it uncensored on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; on August 19, 1969. This song also helped popularize the phrase as a counterculture rallying cry, over and beyond the immediate impact of the anarchist group.

At various times, the line became popular among several groups that came out of the sixties, from Black Panthers to feminists and even &quot;rednecks.&quot; In 1968, David Peel and the Lower East Side included the song &quot;Up against the Wall, Motherfucker&quot; on their album entitled &quot;Have a Marijuana&quot;. In the 1970s, Texas country singer-songwriter Ray Wylie Hubbard adapted the famous phrase for a song he wrote entitled &quot;Up Against the Wall, Redneck Mother&quot;. The phrase was also used as a song title on the album &quot;Penance Soiree&quot; by the Icarus Line.

The line was famously shouted by Patty Hearst during the robbery of Hibernia Bank in San Francisco.

==Simulation game==
In 1969, Columbia University history major Jim Dunnigan, who would later found Simulation Publications, Inc., published a simulation game in the March 11, 1969 edition of the &quot;Columbia Spectator&quot; named &quot;Up Against the Wall, Motherfucker!&quot; The game was based on recent disturbances at Columbia University and allowed the players to play either as protestors or administration with victory determined by winning over various stakeholder groups.

<doc id="1089422" wikidata="Q892295" url="?curid=1089422" title="Von Kármán (lunar crater)">
<text>Von Kármán is a large lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. The crater is about in diameter and lies within an immense impact crater known as the South Pole–Aitken basin of roughly in diameter and deep. Von Kármán is the site of the first soft-landing on the lunar far side by the Chinese Chang&#x27;e 4 spacecraft on 3 January 2019.

==Name==
The crater is named after Hungarian-American aeronautical engineer Theodore von Kármán.

==Overview==

The northern third of this formation is overlain by the rim and outer rampart of the walled plain Leibnitz, forming a deep indentation in the formation. The remainder of the outer wall is roughly circular in shape, although it is irregular and heavily worn by subsequent impacts.

The interior of Von Kármán has been subjected to flooding by lava flows after the original crater formed, leaving the southern portion of the floor nearly flat. This surface has a lower albedo than the surrounding terrain, and is nearly as dark as the interior of Leibnitz. There is a central peak at the location where the midpoint of the original Von Kármán was formed, which joins with the rougher surface in the northern part of the crater.

In addition to Leibnitz to the north, the crater Oresme is located to the west-northwest, and Finsen lies to the northeast on the edge of Leibnitz&#x27;s rim. Nearly attached to the southeast rim is the unusual figure-eight-shaped formation Von Kármán L. Directly to the east of this is the crater Alder.

Prior to formal naming in 1970 by the IAU, the crater was known as &quot;Crater 434&quot;.

==Exploration and cotton seeds sprouting==

On 3 January 2019, the Chinese spacecraft Chang&#x27;e 4 landed inside the crater Von Kármán, becoming the first spacecraft to soft-land on the far side of the Moon. The site holds symbolic meaning and scientific value as Theodore von Kármán (1881–1963) was the PhD advisor of Qian Xuesen, the founder of the Chinese space program.

Chang&#x27;e 4 took cotton seeds on its mission, and on 15 January 2019, China announced that cotton seeds had sprouted, the first &quot;truly otherworldly plant in history&quot;.

On 4 February 2019 the IAU approved the name of the landing site as &quot;Statio Tianhe&quot;. The central peak of Von Kármán, to the northwest of the landing site, was named &quot;Mons Tai&quot;. Three small craters were also named: Hegu is south of the landing site, Zhinyu is to the west, and Tianjin is to the northeast.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Von Kármán.

<doc id="1089423" wikidata="Q7781999" url="?curid=1089423" title="Theodore Roosevelt III">
<text>Theodore Roosevelt IV ( ; June 14, 1914 – May 2, 2001), also known as Theodore III, was an American banker, government official, and veteran of World War II. He was a grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt through his father, Brig. Gen. Theodore Roosevelt III. His name suffix varies since President Roosevelt&#x27;s father was Theodore Roosevelt Sr., though the same-named son did not commonly use a &quot;Jr.&quot; name suffix.

==Early life==
Roosevelt was born on June 14, 1914, in New York City. He was the second born and the last surviving of four children to Theodore Roosevelt III and Eleanor Butler Alexander. Theodore had an older sister, Grace Green Roosevelt, who married William McMillan, and two younger brothers, Cornelius Van Schaack Roosevelt III and Quentin Roosevelt II. Following his father and paternal grandfather, Roosevelt went to Groton School and graduated from Harvard in 1936, where he was a member of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and the Owl Club. While at Harvard, Roosevelt played for the Harvard Crimson men&#x27;s soccer team, and was named a second-team All American in 1934.

As an Oyster Bay Roosevelt, Ted was a descendant of the Schuyler family. His maternal grandparents are Henry Addison Alexander and Grace Green.

==Career==
After graduating from Harvard, Roosevelt worked for the DuPont company from 1936 to 1941.

===Service in World War II===
Following the Roosevelt tradition of military service during times of national emergency, during World War II, Roosevelt volunteered as a Navy pilot, serving as a flag lieutenant (i.e. an aide to an admiral) in the Pacific theater. For his service as a naval aviator, Theodore was awarded the Air Medal. He was promoted to lieutenant on April 1, 1944, and left the Navy as a lieutenant commander.

===Post-war life===

Upon his return from the Pacific Theater, Theodore joined the Philadelphia brokerage firm of Montgomery, Scott, becoming a partner in 1952. Appointed by Governor James H. Duff, he served as Secretary of Commerce of Pennsylvania from 1949 to 1951.

For many years, he was president of the Competitive Enterprise System, Inc., a nonprofit organization that promoted free markets in the United States. Roosevelt was a trustee of the Theodore Roosevelt Association (TRA) for many years and a generous supporter of the organization. In recent years, he attended TRA Police Awards ceremonies in Boston and Philadelphia as well as TRA annual meetings in Boston and Norfolk, VA. He was an honorary plank owner in the USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, and a strong supporter of the efforts to preserve the Pine Knot site in Virginia, his grandparents&#x27; presidential retreat.

==Personal life==
On February 3, 1940, Roosevelt wed Anne Mason Babcock. They had one son, Theodore V (born 1942), and were married until her death on January 29, 2001. Roosevelt died on May 2, 2001, in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. He and his wife are buried at Brookside Cemtery, near Somesville, in the town of Mount Desert, Maine.

<doc id="1089431" wikidata="Q2738563" url="?curid=1089431" title="Sineus and Truvor">
<text>Sineus and Truvor () are mentioned in Rus&#x27; chronicles as brothers of Rurik, a Varangian chieftain of the Rus&#x27; who is traditionally considered to be the founder of the Rurikids. According to legendary calling of the Varangians as recorded in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; (PVL) and &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot;, the three brothers were invited by East Slavic and Finnic tribes to reign over them in what is now northwestern Russia in 862. Sineus established himself at Beloozero and Truvor at Izborsk. After they died, Rurik consolidated their territories into his own.

==Description==

According to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, compiled in , a group of Varangian Rus&#x27; were invited to rule over the local East Slavic and Finnic tribes after they began fighting each other. Rurik, the oldest of the brothers, established himself in Novgorod, while Sineus established himself at Beloozero, on the shores of Lake Beloye, and Truvor at Izborsk, although archaeological findings have also suggested that his residence was in Pskov. Truvor and Sineus died shortly after the establishment of their territories, and Rurik consolidated these lands into his own territory, thus laying the foundations for the state of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

== Interpretation ==
According to popular 20th-century scholarly interpretation (summarized in the textbook by Katsva and Yurganov), the phrase &quot;Rurik, Sineus, en Truvor&quot; should be read &quot;Rurik, sine hus, en tro(gna) vär(ingar)&quot; (Rurik, his house/relatives, and true companions). Melnikova (1998) disagreed, arguing that modern linguistical expertise shows that &quot;sine hus&quot; and &quot;thru varing&quot; contradict basic morphology and syntax of known old Scandinavian dialects, and could never be translated as &quot;our faithful&quot; and &quot;his households&quot;. On the other hand, historians of the 19th century (A. Kunik, N. Belyaev, et al.) had already found common old Scandinavian names such as Signjótr (also Sveinn?) and Þórvar[ð]r, which could fit well with the PVL transcription of &quot;Sineus&quot; and &quot;Truvor&quot;.

Russian historian Valentin Yanin (2008) agreed that the &quot;existence of the &quot;Rurik brothers&quot; seems doubtful&quot; based on the linguistic argument, adding: &quot;The distance of Beloozero from Novgorod is quite significant, and the subordination of the territory closer in the direction of Beloozero to Novgorod occurred only in the middle of the 10th century, when Princess Olga established churchyards on the Msta. In Izborsk, it is customary to display a stone cross, supposedly standing on the grave of Truvor, in complete oblivion of the fact that Truvor, if he lived, then one and a half centuries before the establishment of Christianity in Eastern Europe. The most significant thing is that neither in Izborsk nor in Beloozero have archaeological excavations found any traces of Scandinavian presence in the 9th century.&quot;

<text>The Baron de Hirsch Cemetery, also known as the Beth Israel Synagogue Cemetery, is a Jewish cemetery located on west side of Windsor Street at the intersection of Connaught Avenue beside Fairview Cemetery in the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It has been the burial ground of the congregation of the Beth Israel Synagogue of Halifax since 1893.

== History ==
The Baron De Hirsch Hebrew Benevolent Society, named for the philanthropist, Baron Maurice de Hirsch (1831–1896), of Munich, sought to acquire land on the outskirts of Halifax for a local cemetery. The Culvie Farm property was purchased for that purpose on 20 June 1893,by Abraham Michaels a local merchant who had lost his partner and with no Jewish cemetery had to ship hhim to NYC for burial, and the land was consecrated on 30 July 1893. Some changes to the boundaries of the cemetery were negotiated with the city in the 1950s due to the city&#x27;s need to realign Windsor Street. The city provided additional property, but some original memorial walls had to be disassembled and moved. The new wall was dedicated on 30 September 1968. An anonymous donor since 2004 has funded renovations and expansion.

== RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; ==
Of the 209 bodies recovered after the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in April 1912, 150 were buried in Halifax cemeteries. Ten victims were buried at Baron de Hirsch Cemetery, eight of whom unidentified. The others were the &quot;Titanic&quot;&#x27;s saloon steward Frederick William Wormald and passenger Michel Navratil, Sr. While the intent was for Jewish victims to be buried in the cemetery based on initial body identification, it later turned out that the only two identified victims from &quot;Titanic&quot; in the cemetery were not Jewish. Wormald was Church of England and Navratil, who had boarded the ship under the name &quot;Louis M. Hoffman&quot;, was Catholic.

The cemetery also contains a Commonwealth war grave of a Canadian soldier of World War I.

<doc id="1089443" wikidata="Q1568077" url="?curid=1089443" title="Christianity and Ancient Greek philosophy">
<text>Christianity and Hellenistic philosophies experienced complex interactions during the first to the fourth centuries.

As Christianity spread throughout the Hellenic world, an increasing number of church leaders were educated in Greek philosophy. The dominant philosophical traditions of the Greco-Roman world then were Stoicism, Platonism, Epicureanism, and, to a lesser extent, the skeptic traditions of Pyrrhonism and Academic Skepticism. Stoicism and, particularly, Platonism were often integrated into Christian ethics and Christian theology.

==Historic development==
Christian engagement with Hellenistic philosophy is reported in the New Testament in Acts 17:18 describing the Apostle Paul&#x27;s discussions with Epicurean and Stoic philosophers. Christian assimilation of Hellenistic philosophy was anticipated by Philo and other Greek-speaking Alexandrian Jews. Philo&#x27;s blend of Judaism, Platonism, and Stoicism strongly influenced Christian Alexandrian writers such as Origen and Clement of Alexandria, as well as in the Latin world, Ambrose of Milan.

Clement of Alexandria, demonstrated Greek thought in writing, 

The Church historian Eusebius suggested in his &quot;Praeparatio Evangelica&quot; that Greek philosophy, although in his view derivative, was concordant with Hebrew notions. Augustine of Hippo, who ultimately systematized Christian philosophy, wrote in the 4th and early 5th century, 

John Burnet (1892) noted
:&quot;The Neoplatonists were quite justified in regarding themselves as the spiritual heirs of Pythagoras; and, in their hands, philosophy ceased to exist as such, and became theology. And this tendency was at work all along; hardly a single Greek philosopher was wholly uninfluenced by it. In later days, Apollonios of Tyana showed in practice what this sort of thing must ultimately lead to. The theurgy and thaumaturgy of the late Greek schools were only the fruit of the seed sown by the generation which immediately preceded the Persian War.&quot;

==Conception of God==
Commentary from Sir William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology (1870, p. 620).
:One, or unity, is the essence of number, or absolute number. As absolute number it is the origin of all numbers, and so of all things. (According to another passage of Aristotle, Met. xii. 6. p. 1080, b. 7. number is produced) This original unity they also termed God (Ritter, Gesch. der FML vol. i. p. 389). These propositions, however, would, taken alone, give but a very partial idea of the Pythagorean system. A most important part is played in it by the ideas of limit, and the unlimited. They are, in fact, the fundamental ideas of the whole. One of the first declarations in the work of Philolaus was, that all things in the universe result from a combination of the unlimited and the limiting; for if all things had been unlimited, nothing could have been the object of .

It was not until the fusion of Platonic and Aristotelian theology with Christianity that the concepts of strict omnipotence, omniscience, or benevolence became commonplace. The Platonic Theory of Forms had an enormous influence on Hellenic Christian views of God. In those philosophies, Forms were the ideals of every object in the physical world, and objects in the physical world were merely shadows of those perfect forms. Platonic philosophers were able to theorize about the forms by looking at objects in the material world, and imagining what the &quot;Perfect&quot; tree, or &quot;Perfect&quot; man would be. The Aristotelian view of God grew from these Platonic roots, arguing that God was the Infinite, or the Unmoved Mover.

Hellenic Christians and their medieval successors applied this form-based philosophy to the Christian God. Philosophers took all the things they considered good—power, love, knowledge, and size—and posited that God was &#x27;infinite&#x27; in all these respects. They then concluded that God was omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent. Since God was perfect, any change would make Him less than perfect, so they asserted that God was unchanging, or immutable.

Anselm of Canterbury, a priest, monk, and philosopher defined God as the &quot;Being than which no greater can be conceived.&quot; Almost 200 years later, Thomas Aquinas, in his &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot;, article 3, wrote succinctly: &quot;By &#x27;God&#x27;, however, we mean some infinite good&quot;.

With the establishment of the formal church, the development of creeds and formal theology, this view of God as Omni-Everything became nearly universal in the Christian World.

==Ontological argument==

Anselm of Canterbury composed the ontological argument for the existence of God, which he believed to be irrefutable. In essence, he argued that because God is, by definition, the being than which no greater can be conceived, and it is more perfect to exist than not to exist, God must exist. Conceiving God not to exist would be not conceiving God at all, as it would conceive a being less than perfect, which would not be God. Therefore, the argument proceeded, God could not be conceived not to exist.

The ontological argument is a defining example of the fusion of Hebrew and Greek thought. Philosophical realism was the dominant philosophical school of Anselm&#x27;s day, and stemmed from Platonism. It held, in contrast to Nominalism, that things such as &quot;green&quot; and &quot;big&quot; were known as universals, which had a real existence in an abstract realm, as described by Plato. Accordingly, if a concept could be formed in the human mind, then it had a real existence in the abstract realm of the universals, apart from his imagination. In essence, if God could be imagined, God existed.

The ontological argument reflected the classical concept of &quot;perfections.&quot; Size, intelligence, beauty, power, benevolence, and so forth—all these qualities are called perfections. What is more intelligent is more perfect in terms of intelligence; what is more beautiful is more perfect in terms of beauty, and so forth. Since existence was more perfect than non-existence, and God was, by definition, perfect, God existed by definition.

The Platonic concepts of realism, perfection and a god that defined as infinite thus became incorporated into Christian medieval philosophy.

<doc id="1089450" wikidata="Q632279" url="?curid=1089450" title="Gana">
<text>The word  ( ) in Sanskrit and Pali means &quot;flock, troop, multitude, number, tribe, category, series, or class&quot;. It can also be used to refer to a &quot;body of attendants&quot; and can refer to &quot;a company, any assemblage or association of men formed for the attainment of the same aims&quot;. The word &quot;gana&quot; can also refer to councils or assemblies convened to discuss matters of religion or other topics.

In Hinduism, the s are attendants of Shiva and live on Mount Kailash. Ganesha was chosen as their leader by Shiva; the deity&#x27;s title is or , meaning, &quot;lord or leader of the &quot;.

== Literature ==

=== Vedas ===
The term gana is employed in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; in reference to the Maruts:
=== Mahabharata ===
Chapter 108 of the &quot;Shanti Parva&quot; of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; describes a discussion between Yudhishthira and Bhishma regarding the strength of the ganas, how they defend themselves from disunion, the subjugation of their enemies, and forging friendships. Bhishma&#x27;s answers to these questions are recorded in the form of shlokas (verses) from 16 – 32 of the chapter.

=== Shiva Purana ===
In the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;, after Ganesha&#x27;s life was restored by Shiva, he was crowned as the leader of the ganas by the gods.

=== Cilappatikaram ===
The &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; of Ilango Adigal, one of the Five Great Epics in Tamil, describes the prescribed offering for eighteen kind of ganas.

=== Buddhaghosa ===
The &quot;Buddhaghosa&quot; mentions the palaces of the ganadeva-puttas (&quot;Ganadevaputtānañ ca vimānāni&quot;) among those seen by King Nemi as Mātali led him through the world of the devas. This term seems to be absent in the corresponding jātaka. It is possible that these deities are associated with the ganas of Hinduism.

<doc id="1089456" wikidata="Q7782000" url="?curid=1089456" title="Theodore Roosevelt V">
<text>Theodore Roosevelt V ( ; born November 27, 1942), also called Theodore IV, is an American investment banker and managing director at Barclays Investment Bank. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Economic Club of New York, and the Foreign Policy Association, and serves on the Advisory Council of Represent.Us, a nonpartisan anti-corruption organization. Roosevelt is also a prominent conservationist. His name suffix varies since his great-grandfather, President Theodore Roosevelt, was a son of Theodore Roosevelt Sr., though the same-named son did not commonly use a &quot;Jr.&quot; name suffix.

==Early years==
Theodore Roosevelt V was born on November 27, 1942. He is the only son of Theodore Roosevelt IV (1914–2001) and Anne Mason Babcock (1917–2001). Roosevelt earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Harvard University in 1965. At Harvard, he was a member of the Porcellian Club. In 1972, Roosevelt earned an MBA from the Harvard Business School, where he was a member of the HBS Rugby Club.

Roosevelt is a great-grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt. As an Oyster Bay Roosevelt, and through his ancestor Cornelius Van Schaack Jr., he is a descendant of the Schuyler family. His maternal grandparents were George Wheeler Babcock (1879—1950) and Anne Mason Bonnycastle Robinson (1886—1923).

==Career==
After college, he was commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve on June 16, 1965, and served as a U.S. Navy officer with Underwater Demolition Team 11 (BUD/S Class 36). After completing BUDS he served for two years in Vietnam with the Navy SEALs. He remained in the Naval Reserve after leaving active duty and was promoted to lieutenant commander on April 1, 1974.

He would later then go onto serving in the U.S. State Department as a foreign service officer in Washington, D.C. and the Upper Volta.

===Public service===
Roosevelt is Chair of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a Trustee of the Alliance for Climate Protection, a member of the Governing Council of The Wilderness Society (United States), and a Trustee for the American Museum of Natural History, the World Resources Institute, and The Cultural Institutions Retirement System. He is also a Counselor for the China–U.S. Center for Sustainable Development. He sits on the Advisory Council of the nonpartisan anti-corruption organization Represent.Us, where he served as a consultant in the crafting of the American Anti-Corruption Act.

At the Republican Convention in 2000, Roosevelt delivered an address on the environment. He gave the keynote speech at the National Governors Association Annual Meeting in 2001 as well as the keynote address at the Governors Conference on Climate Change in April 2008 sponsored by Yale University. Most recently, he spoke at the Conference of Parties Climate Summit in December 2009 in Copenhagen sponsored by the European Union Parliament.

On April 18, 2016, the day before the New York Republican primary, Roosevelt endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich for president of the United States.

Roosevelt suggested on Twitter that Donald Trump was the &quot;loser&quot; following a report in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that Trump chose not to visit an American military cemetery in France, with Trump allegedly saying &quot;Why should I go to that cemetery? It&#x27;s filled with losers.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1970, Roosevelt married Constance Lane Rogers. They have one son, Theodore Roosevelt VI.

<text>Hua Shang Daily (), also known as China Commercial Daily, was a patriotic newspaper for united front led by Liao Chengzhi and Fan Changjiang and published in Hong Kong since 8 April 1941. Due to the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was stopped publishing in that year. After the Japanese surrender, &quot;Hua Shang Daily&quot; was restored publishing on 4 January 1946 and became a democratic publication. The newspaper supported democratic movement and opposed to the dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek.

On 15 October 1949, &quot;Hua Shang Daily&quot; published an article titled &quot;Goodbye, my dearest readers!&quot; on the front page and then the publication was stopped. The company was moved to Guangzhou and published another newspaper called &quot;Nanfang Daily&quot;.

This newspaper has nothing to do with &quot;Chinese Business View&quot;, a Shaanxi newspaper of the same Chinese name and is also sometimes translated as &quot;Hua Shang Daily&quot;.

<text>Ilex verticillata, the winterberry, is a species of holly native to eastern North America in the United States and southeast Canada, from Newfoundland west to Ontario and Minnesota, and south to Alabama.

Other names that have been used include black alder, Canada holly, coralberry, fever bush, Michigan holly, or winterberry holly.

The species occurs particularly in wetland habitats, but also on dry sand dunes and grassland. The berries are an important food resource for some species of bird, among them the American robin.

==Description==
&quot;Ilex verticillata&quot; is a shrub growing to tall. It is one of a number of hollies which are deciduous, losing their leaves in the fall. In wet sites, it will spread to form a dense thicket, while in dry soil it remains a tight shrub. The leaves are glossy green, long, broad, with a serrated margin and an acute apex. The flowers are small, in diameter, with five to eight white petals.

The fruit is a globose red drupe in diameter, which often persists on the branches long into the winter, giving the plant its English name. Like most hollies, it is dioecious, with separate male and female plants; the proximity of at least one male plant is required to pollenize the females in order to bear fruit.

== Cultivation and uses ==
===Medicinal===
The berries were used by Native Americans for medicinal purposes, the origin of the name &quot;fever bush&quot;.

The seeds, leaves, bark and berries of the plant can cause nausea and low blood pressure if ingested.

===Ornamental plant===
&quot;Ilex verticillata&quot; – the American winterberry – is prized as an ornamental plant in gardens for the midwinter splash of bright color from densely packed berries, whose visibility is heightened by the loss of foliage; therefore it is popular even where other, evergreen, hollies are also grown. The bare branches covered in berries are also popular for cutting and use in floral arrangements. In autumn/fall the leaves turn yellow sometimes with tinges of red and orange. 

It is easy to grow, with very few diseases or pests. Although wet acidic soils are optimal, the winterberry will grow well in the average garden. Numerous cultivars are available, differing in size and shape of the plant and color of the berry. At least one male plant must be planted in proximity to one or more females for them to bear fruit. Because both females and males come in early- and late-flowering varieties, males must be selected to have same timing as the females they are intended to pollinate.

==Selected cultivars==
===Female===
* &quot;Ilex verticillata&quot; &#x27;Winter Red&#x27; Fruit is orange-red
* &quot;Ilex verticillata&quot; &#x27;Afterglow&#x27; Fruit is orange-red
* &quot;Ilex verticillata&quot; &#x27;Red Sprite&#x27; Large, red fruit
* &quot;Ilex verticillata&quot; &#x27;Spravy&#x27; &quot;Berry Heavy&quot; Fruit is orange-red
* &quot;Ilex verticillata&quot; &#x27;Spriber&#x27; &quot;Berry Nice&quot; Bright red fruit
* &quot;Ilex verticillata&quot; &#x27;Winter Gold&#x27; Fruit is orange.

<text>Avinor AS is a state-owned limited company that operates most of the civil airports in Norway. The Norwegian state, via the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, controls 100 percent of the share capital. Avinor was created on 1 January 2003, by the privatization of the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration known as Luftfartsverket. Its head office is in Bjørvika, Oslo, located on the seaside of Oslo Central Station.

Avinor owns and operates 44 airports in Norway, fourteen in association with the Royal Norwegian Air Force, and is responsible for air traffic control services in Norway. In addition to the 44 airports, it operates three Area Control Centers: Bodø Air Traffic Control Center, Stavanger Air Traffic Control Center and Oslo ATCC.

, the chief executive officer was Sverre Quale who has been in the job since 18 April 2006. He was previously the head of the Norwegian Accident Investigation Board. As of 2011, Sverre Quale has been employed as the CEO at Multiconsult. His replacement, Dag Falk-Petersen, was CEO of CHC Helicopters. In February 2021, Abraham Foss took on the role of CEO of the company. Avinor has about 3000 employees, including air traffic control, air navigation services, rescue, maintenance, administration and other airport operations personnel.

==History==
On 1 July 1947, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communication created the Aviation Directorate (&quot;Luftfartsdirektoratet&quot;) to take over the responsibility for the civilian airports in Norway. Until then the Norwegian Ministry of Defence was responsible for operating airports, including the civilian ones. This responsibility had been delegated to the Aviation Council (&quot;Luftfartsrådet&quot;) within the ministry. The first director was Einar Bøe (1947–1964), followed by Erik Willoch (1964–1989), Ove Liavaag (1989–2000), Randi Flesland (2000–2005), Sverre Quale (2006–2010), Dag Falk-Petersen (2011–2021) and Abraham Foss (2021–).

The organisation changed its name to Luftfartsverket in 1967. In 1997, Oslo Airport, Fornebu and the then under construction Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, were merged into a separate subsidiary, Oslo Lufthavn AS. This company still operates Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. On 14 December 2005, CEO Randi Flesland resigned after an ongoing dispute with employees. She was temporarily replaced by Nic. Nilsen until Sverre Quale took over.

<doc id="1089521" wikidata="Q3283958" url="?curid=1089521" title="The Four Loves">
<text>The Four Loves is a 1960 book by C. S. Lewis which explores the nature of love from a Christian and philosophical perspective through thought experiments. The book was based on a set of radio talks from 1958 which had been criticised in the U.S. at the time for their frankness about sex.

== Need/gift love ==
Taking his start from St. John&#x27;s words &quot;God is Love&quot;, Lewis initially thought to contrast &quot;Need-love&quot; (such as the love of a child for its mother) and &quot;Gift-love&quot; (epitomized by God&#x27;s love for humanity), to the disparagement of the former. However, he swiftly happened on the insight that the natures of even these basic categorizations of love are more complicated than they at first seemed: a child&#x27;s need for parental comfort is a necessity, not a selfish indulgence, while conversely parental Gift-love in excessive form can be a perversion of its own.

== Pleasures ==
Lewis continues his examination by exploring the nature of pleasure, distinguishing Need-pleasures (such as water for the thirsty) from Pleasures of Appreciation, such as the love of nature. From the latter, he developed what he called &quot;a third element in love ... Appreciative love&quot;, to go along with Need-love and Gift-love.

Throughout the rest of the book, Lewis goes on to counterpoint that three-fold, qualitative distinction against the four broad types of love indicated in his title.

In his remaining four chapters, Lewis treats love under four categories (&quot;the highest does not stand without the lowest&quot;), based in part on the four Greek words for &quot;love&quot;: affection, friendship, eros, and charity. Lewis states that just as Lucifer (a former archangel) perverted himself by pride and fell into depravity, so too can love – commonly held to be the arch-emotion – become corrupt by presuming itself to be what it is not.

A fictional treatment of these loves is the main theme of Lewis&#x27;s novel &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot;.

==The four loves==
=== Storge – empathy bond ===
Storge (&quot;storgē&quot;, Greek: ) is liking someone through the fondness of familiarity, family members or people who relate in familiar ways that have otherwise found themselves bonded by chance. An example is the natural love and affection of a parent for their child. It is described as the most natural, emotive, and widely diffused of loves: It is natural in that it is present without coercion, emotive because it is the result of fondness due to familiarity, and most widely diffused because it pays the least attention to those characteristics deemed &quot;valuable&quot; or worthy of love and, as a result, is able to transcend most discriminating factors. Lewis describes it as a dependency-based love which risks extinction if the needs cease to be met.

Affection, for Lewis, included both Need-love and Gift-love. He considered it responsible for nine-tenths of all solid and lasting human happiness.

However, affection&#x27;s strength is also what makes it vulnerable. Affection has the appearance of being &quot;built-in&quot; or &quot;ready made&quot;, says Lewis, and as a result, people come to expect it irrespective of their behaviour and its natural consequences. Both in its Need and its Gift form, affection then is liable to &quot;go bad&quot;, and to be corrupted by such forces as jealousy, ambivalence and smothering.

=== Philia – friend bond ===
Philia (Greek: ) is the love between friends as close as siblings in strength and duration. The friendship is the strong bond existing between people who share common values, interests, or activities. Lewis immediately differentiates friendship love from the other loves. He describes friendship as &quot;the least biological, organic, instinctive, gregarious and necessary...the least &quot;natural&quot; of loves&quot;. Our species does not need friendship in order to reproduce, but to the classical and medieval worlds, it is a higher-level love because it is freely chosen.

Lewis explains that true friendships, like the friendship between David and Jonathan in the Bible, are almost a lost art. He expresses a strong distaste for the way modern society ignores friendship. He notes that he cannot remember any poem that celebrated true friendship like that between David and Jonathan, Orestes and Pylades, Roland and Oliver, Amis and Amiles. Lewis goes on to say, &quot;to the Ancients, Friendship seemed the happiest and most fully human of all loves; the crown of life and the school of virtue. The modern world, in comparison, ignores it&quot;.

Growing out of companionship, friendship for Lewis was a deeply appreciative love, though one which he felt few people in modern society could value at its worth, because so few actually experienced true friendship.

Nevertheless, Lewis was not blind to what he considered the dangers of friendships, such as its potential for cliquiness, anti-authoritarianism and pride.

=== Eros – romantic love ===
Eros (&quot;erōs&quot;, Greek: ) for Lewis was love in the sense of &quot;being in love&quot; or &quot;loving&quot; someone, as opposed to the raw sexuality of what he called Venus: the illustration Lewis used was the distinction between &quot;wanting a woman&quot; and wanting one particular woman – something that matched his (classical) view of man as a rational animal, a composite both of reasoning angel and instinctual alley-cat.

Eros turns the need-pleasure of Venus into the most appreciative of all pleasures; but nevertheless, Lewis warned against the modern tendency for Eros to become a god to people who fully submit themselves to it, a justification for selfishness, even a phallic religion.

After exploring sexual activity and its spiritual significance in both a pagan and a Christian sense, he notes how Eros (or being in love) is in itself an indifferent, neutral force: how &quot;Eros in all his splendour ... may urge to evil as well as good&quot;.
While accepting that Eros can be an extremely profound experience, he does not overlook the dark way in which it could lead even to the point of suicide pacts or murder, as well as to furious refusals to part, &quot;mercilessly chaining together two mutual tormentors, each raw all over with the poison of hate-in-love&quot;.

=== Agape – unconditional &quot;God&quot; love ===
Charity (&quot;agápē&quot;, Greek: ) is the love that exists regardless of changing circumstances. Lewis recognizes this selfless love as the greatest of the four loves, and sees it as a specifically Christian virtue to achieve. The chapter on the subject focuses on the need to subordinate the other three natural loves – as Lewis puts it, &quot;The natural loves are not self-sufficient&quot; – to the love of God, who is full of charitable love, to prevent what he termed their &quot;demonic&quot; self-aggrandizement.

<text>Robert Morris University (RMU) is a private university in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, United States. It was founded in 1921 and is named after Robert Morris, known as the &quot;financier of the American Revolution&quot;. It enrolls nearly 5,000 students and offers 60 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs and 35 master&#x27;s and doctoral programs.

==History==
Robert Morris University originated in 1921 as the Pittsburgh School of Accountancy, founded by Andrew Blass using a curriculum similar to what he had overseen as dean of the Pace Institute in Washington, D.C. His successor, C.W. Salmond, oversaw an expansion in 1935 that added business and secretarial studies, and the school was renamed the Robert Morris School of Business in honor of the Founding Father popularly known as the &quot;financier of the American Revolution.&quot; In 1942, the Robert Morris School moved to the William Penn Hotel to accommodate its growing enrollment, and in 1959 purchased its own Downtown building at 600 Fifth Ave.

In 1962 the school purchased Pine Hill Manor and Farm in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, formerly the home of Oliver Kaufmann, vice president of Kaufmann&#x27;s department store in Pittsburgh, his wife, Freda, and their children. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania then granted the school permission to award associate degrees, and the school became Robert Morris Junior College, operating from two separate campuses. The first new buildings on the Moon Township campus, Franklin Center and three residence halls, were erected in 1963.

The school became Robert Morris College in 1969 when it began offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees in business administration. The first graduate students were admitted in 1978 for master&#x27;s degree programs in business administration, taxation, and business teacher education; the first doctoral program was offered in 1999. In 2002, the school attained university status and was thus renamed Robert Morris University. In 2010, the university sold its Downtown Center at 600 Fifth Avenue to Duquesne University.

In 2016, Christopher B. Howard became the university&#x27;s eighth president. Howard was formerly the president of Hampden-Sydney College and the first African-American president in RMU&#x27;s history. He was succeeded by Michelle L. Patrick in 2022, the first woman to serve as RMU president.

==Campus==
The core campus consists of a tract in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh near Pittsburgh International Airport.

Nearly 2,000 students live in campus housing, including 85 percent of freshmen.

The UPMC Events Center and Peoples Court is the home of basketball and volleyball teams. The center also has extensive conference, classroom, and meeting facilities and is a venue for concerts, speakers, and other events. Football and lacrosse teams play on campus at Joe Walton Stadium.

Clearview Arena is the home of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey teams at the RMU Island Sports Center, a sports and recreation facility at nearby Neville Island in the Ohio River from Downtown Pittsburgh. The center is open to the public year-round and contains two indoor and two outdoor ice rinks, an indoor hockey arena (home to the Steel City Icebergs), and a dome that accommodates an indoor golf driving range. The center also has an outdoor 18-hole miniature golf course.

The university also has classes online and at its Downtown campus at 339 Sixth Avenue in Pittsburgh, also the home of the Bayer Center for Nonprofit Management at Robert Morris University. The university offers training in additive manufacturing at a 3D printing lab and classroom in the Energy Innovation Center in the Lower Hill District.

==Academics==
RMU offers 60 undergraduate and 35 graduate degree programs. It also offers 39 professionally focused certificate programs.

RMU was the first university in Pennsylvania to join the Amazon Web Service Academy and offer cloud computing certification curriculum. On October 7, 2022, the university announced that the school would be renamed the Rockwell School of Business. This was a result of an $18 million gift from the S. Kent Rockwell Foundation and the Kent Rockwell family, the largest personal gift in the university’s history and a tremendous investment in entrepreneurial and business education.

To support students from underrepresented groups who want to pursue careers in technology or math, Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings made a $3 million gift in January 2021 to fund 20 full scholarships for RMU Next Century Scholars. The 20 scholarships were open to qualified applicants pursuing degrees in computer and information systems; cybersecurity; data analytics; actuarial science; mathematics; statistics and predictive analysis; computer science; and user experience user interface design (UX-UI).

In October 2022, Robert Morris University was one of two recipients of a record-setting $8.82 million gift from the Peirce Foundation for dyslexia education, the largest gift of its kind ever made in the state of Pennsylvania. The Peirce family previously committed $2 million to Robert Morris University in 2017 to establish the Bob and Joan Peirce Center for Structured Reading Teacher Training, which trains teachers to work with children with dyslexia and other learning disabilities.

Robert Morris University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The School of Business is accredited by AACSB International. In 2022, Robert Morris University announced that it earned the AACSB Accounting accreditation, the first university in Western Pennsylvania to do so. B.S. programs in information sciences and computer information systems are accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, while B.S. programs in engineering and manufacturing engineering are accredited by ABET&#x27;s Engineering Accreditation Commission. Initial teacher preparation and advanced educator programs are accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP). Nursing programs are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, and nuclear medicine by the Joint Review Committee on Education Programs in Nuclear Medicine Technology; the Regional Research and Innovation in Simulation Education (RISE) Center at Robert Morris University is accredited by the Council for Accreditation of Healthcare Simulation Programs.

== Student life ==
Most students are from the Pittsburgh area, while 16 percent of freshmen in 2018 were from outside Pennsylvania. RMU offers more than 160 student organizations, clubs, and activities on campus. The Colonial Theatre program stages several productions annually, including some that have won honors at the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival. The RMU Bands and Performing Ensembles features a marching show band, pep band, jazz band, wind ensemble, and fife &amp; drum corps.

<text>Robert Morris University Illinois, formerly Robert Morris College, was a private university with its main campus in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded in 1965 but its oldest ancestor was the Moser School founded in 1913. It changed its name to Robert Morris University Illinois in 2009. In 2020, it merged into Roosevelt University, which formed under it a new Robert Morris Experiential College as one of several colleges at Roosevelt. 
Robert Morris offered associate and bachelor&#x27;s degrees and was regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

==History==

Robert Morris traces its history back to the founding of the Moser School of Business in 1913. Robert Morris College itself was founded in 1965 in Carthage, Illinois as a two-year college, buying the former campus of Carthage College for $1.1 million after Carthage College had left Illinois for its newer Wisconsin campus. In 1975 Robert Morris expanded to Chicago by acquiring and merging the Moser School.

Robert Morris opened a Springfield, Illinois campus in July 1988 and closed the Carthage campus in July 1989. The college later opened campuses in Orland Park in 1991, Naperville in 1997, Bensenville in 1999, Peoria in 2000. The Orland Park campus moved to Aurora and became the DuPage Campus in 2001. Waukegan opened as the Lake County Campus in 2003. The Graduate School was established in 2005 and became a separate campus in Schaumburg in 2008. Two more campuses followed: Elgin in 2009, Arlington Heights in 2011.

In March 2020, Robert Morris University Illinois merged with Roosevelt University to become one of its colleges.

== Athletics ==
The Robert Morris athletic teams located at the Chicago campus were called the Eagles. The university was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference (CCAC) from about 1995–96 to 2019–20. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey competed in their respective divisions of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA). After the merger, the Roosevelt Lakers added football and ice hockey beginning in the 2020–21 season after acquiring Robert Morris&#x27;s teams in those sports.

In 2014 RMU became the first university to offer gaming scholarships for a varsity esports team; they competed in &quot;League of Legends&quot;, &quot;Hearthstone&quot;, and &quot;Dota 2&quot; competitions.

<text>Thomas Hitzlsperger (born 5 April 1982) is a German football executive and former professional footballer who played as a midfielder, currently board member at Serie A club Hellas Verona. 

In February 2019, he was appointed Head of Sport at VfB Stuttgart VfB Stuttgart, later rising to the position of CEO. He stepped down from this role in March 2022. 

In January 2025, after the acquisition of Hellas Verona by American private equity firm Presidio Investors, he was announced as a board member of the Serie A club.

As a player, he spent the early part of his career playing for Aston Villa in England (accompanied by a short loan spell at Chesterfield), before returning to Germany to play for Stuttgart, where he was a member of the team which won the Bundesliga in 2007. In 2010, he signed for Italian side Lazio, before moving back to England to join West Ham United later that year. He then had brief spells with Wolfsburg and Everton.

Hitzlsperger also represented the Germany national team, earning 52 caps and being selected for the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008. Following a series of injuries, he retired from football in September 2013. After his retirement, he came out as gay, the highest-profile male footballer in the world to do so.

==Club career==
===Early career===
After joining the VfB Forstinning youth team in 1988, Hitzlsperger signed to the Bayern Munich Junior Team, but agreed to leave at the end of the 1999–2000 season.

===Aston Villa===
After a short trial with Celtic in August 2000, Hitzlsperger joined Aston Villa on a free youth transfer from Bayern Munich. He made his Aston Villa debut in a 3–0 home defeat to Liverpool on 13 January 2001 as an 84th-minute substitute for Jlloyd Samuel; it was his only appearance during his first season in England.

Whilst at Aston Villa, Hitzlsperger was briefly loaned out to Second Division club Chesterfield during the 2001–02 season, making his debut in a 1–0 home win against Kidderminster Harriers in the Football League Trophy second round. On 21 November, his link was extended for another month. In all he made six appearances for the Spireites, five of which were in the league. He was recalled by Aston Villa during the second month of the loan spell however, as the Birmingham club had several players injured or suspended. On 20 April 2002, away to already relegated Leicester City, he hit the post after five minutes, from which Peter Crouch opened the scoring from the rebound; Hitzlsperger later scored his first senior goal in the 2–2 draw, from a solo run.

Hitzlsperger moved to Aston Villa first team following the arrival of new manager Graham Taylor. On 14 December 2002, his last-minute 30-yard strike past Russell Hoult sealed a 2–1 win over rivals West Bromwich Albion. He later played a significant part in the Aston Villa side that finished sixth under David O&#x27;Leary, before falling out of favour the following season. Hitzlsperger left Aston Villa as a fan favourite, and stated that he might return to the club when the opportunity comes. He gained the nickname (The Hammer) during his time at Villa Park, due to his powerful left-foot shot from long-range. A fluent speaker of English, he acquired an unusual Brummie-German hybrid accent during his spell at Villa.

===Stuttgart===

Hitzlsperger signed for VfB Stuttgart in the summer of 2005, having left Aston Villa on a Bosman free transfer. He became a regular for Stuttgart, particularly in his second season in which the team won the Bundesliga title. Hitzlsperger made a large contribution to their success, playing in 30 of the team&#x27;s 34 league matches and scoring seven times. He scored a crucial equaliser in the 27th minute of Stuttgart&#x27;s final match of the season against Energie Cottbus – had Stuttgart lost that match, Schalke 04 would have won the title. In the end, a 63rd-minute goal by Sami Khedira secured the title for Stuttgart.

On 14 August 2007, Hitzlsperger extended his contract until the summer of 2010. On 22 July 2008, he was appointed the new captain by manager Armin Veh following the departure of Fernando Meira. On 1 December 2009, he was deposed as team captain by Stuttgart&#x27;s new manager Markus Babbel.

===Lazio===
On 31 January 2010, Hitzlsperger moved to Lazio on six-month contract, for around €550,000. He scored his only goal for Lazio on 15 May in a 3–1 win against Udinese.

===West Ham United===

Hitzlsperger signed a three-year deal with Premier League club West Ham United in June 2010, but due to an injury did not make his debut for &quot;the Hammers&quot; until an FA Cup fifth round match against Burnley on 21 February 2011, a game in which he scored in the 23rd minute of a 5–1 win with a &quot;trademark thunderbolt&quot; from 25 yards. Hitzlsperger made his league debut for the East London club six days later in a 3–1 win against Liverpool at the Boleyn Ground. He scored his first league goal for West Ham in the 3–0 home win against Stoke City on 5 March. At the end of the season West Ham were relegated to the Football League Championship and Hitzlsperger&#x27;s contract was terminated.

===Wolfsburg===
On 17 August 2011, Hitzlsperger signed for Bundesliga club Wolfsburg on a three-year deal, after being released by West Ham three months earlier. His contract was terminated at the end of the season. He played for Stuttgart and Wolfsburg 131 matches in the Bundesliga and scored 20 goals in the German top flight.

===Everton===
On 19 October 2012, Hitzlsperger joined Premier League club Everton, after a spell on trial with the club, on a short-term contract until January 2013. He made his debut for the Toffees coming on as an 86th-minute substitute for Nikica Jelavić in a 2–1 victory against Sunderland at Goodison Park. He made his first Everton start away to Reading on 17 November. On 11 January 2013 he signed an extension to his contract, keeping him at the club until the end of the season. At the end of the season, he was released along with Ján Mucha.

In September 2013, aged 31, Hitzlsperger announced his retirement from football citing the strain of &quot;many transfers and some injuries&quot;. Although he had received offers to resume his playing career, he reported, &quot;I&#x27;ve noticed: I need something else.&quot;

==International career==
Hitzlsperger captained the Germany under-19 team, and also appeared for the national under-21 side. He was then called up to the senior side by Jürgen Klinsmann and made his debut in a 2–0 win against Iran in Tehran on 9 October 2004, replacing Bernd Schneider in the 68th minute.
He appeared at the 2005 Confederations Cup and also at the 2006 World Cup, where he failed to make it into Klinsmann&#x27;s starting eleven, playing just 11 minutes in the third-place play-off against Portugal. He scored his first international goals on 6 September 2006 in a European Championship qualifying game against San Marino. Hitzlsperger came on as a second-half substitute to score Germany&#x27;s 9th and 11th goals in a record 13–0 win.

Germany&#x27;s coach Joachim Löw included Hitzlsperger in his squad for the [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008 Euros], but did not start him in any of the three [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group B|group games]]. Hitzlsperger came on as a second-half substitute in the victories over [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]], but did not feature at all in the surprise defeat to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. In the knockout stages however, he started in all three matches, helping his team to defeat Portugal in the quarter-final and setting up [[Philipp Lahm]] for a 90th-minute winner against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] in the semi-final. Germany were defeated 1–0 by [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the [[UEFA Euro 2008 Final|final]], in which Hitzlsperger was substituted in the second half.

Hitzlsperger remained first-choice in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 World Cup qualifying]], playing in all but one match and scoring a goal, but he missed out on his nation&#x27;s [[2010 FIFA World Cup squads#Germany|World Cup squad]] in June 2010. His international career ended on 11 August 2010 with his 52nd cap.

==VfB Stuttgart management==
On 12 February 2019, Hitzlsperger became Head of Sport of [[VfB Stuttgart]]. He was promoted to CEO and resigned in January 2022 to return to his television career.

==Personal life==
Hitzlsperger, the youngest child of Ludwig and Anneliese Hitzlsperger, was born in [[Munich]] and grew up in [[Forstinning]], alongside his five brothers and one sister. Hitzlsperger has an interest in economics, and while in England studied investment strategies, although he did not complete the course. He regularly visited the [[Bank of England]] to discuss finance with the bank&#x27;s governor, [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury|Mervyn King]], a lifelong Aston Villa fan.

Hitzlsperger has [[blog]]ged for &quot;Störungsmelder&quot;, an anti-racism site that encourages debate about [[xenophobia]] and racism in Germany.

In June 2007, Hitzlsperger ended his eight-year relationship with his longtime girlfriend, Inga, just one month before they were due to get married. On 8 January 2014, a few months after retiring, he became the highest-profile male footballer to [[coming out|come out]] as [[gay]] at the time. (In 2023, Czech [[Jakub Jankto]] became the first &quot;active&quot; male national footballer to come out as gay.) Hitzlsperger said that he had only realised that he was gay in the past few years. He received widespread support from former fellow players of the Germany national team, such as [[Lukas Podolski]], who said of his coming out as &quot;brave&quot; and &quot;an important sign of our time&quot; as well as a reaction from [[Joachim Löw]] who said of his decision as &quot;personal&quot; and that he &quot;deserved respect from every side.&quot;

In January 2022, Hitzlsperger told [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], that a &quot;collective [[coming out]]&quot; of gay footballers could be a solution to their problems of hiding their sexuality. Hitzlsperger took the example of 125 Catholic priests in Germany who decided to come out at once.

In January 2024, Hitzlsperger was named by Aston Villa as a member of the &quot;Honorary Anniversary Board&quot; ahead of the club&#x27;s 150th anniversary season.

In March 2024, Hitzlsperger presented his autobiography, where he speaks about his coming-out and LGBTQ+ activism.

<doc id="1089532" wikidata="Q267029" url="?curid=1089532" title="Severn Darden">
<text>Severn Teakle Darden Jr. (November 9, 1929 – May 27, 1995) was an American comedian and actor, and a founding member of The Second City Chicago-based comedy troupe as well as its predecessor, the Compass Players. He is known from his film appearances for playing the human leader Kolp in the fourth and fifth &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; films. His live comedy improv skit under the character of &quot;Walther von der Vogelweide&quot; was influential with two generations of comic performers.

==Background==
Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, he attended the University of Chicago, where he was a &quot;campus legend&quot; according to poet Paul Carroll. Darden’s offbeat and intellectual sense of humor was a major element in the style of The Second City at that time, and is evident throughout his work. Carroll described him as a combination of surrealistic New Orleans and tough, caustic &quot;Chicago Style&quot; comedy. An example of his offbeat humor is the way he squeezed the phrase &quot;Know thyself&quot; into the seven-character limitation of a New Mexico license plate: NOYOSEF. 

Darden was a core comedian in Paul Sills&#x27; Compass Players, the first improvisation theater in the US; it performed around the Chicago area during the mid-1950s. Sills went on to found The Second City in 1959 and brought in many of the comedians from Compass Players, including Darden.

He was present at the February 12, 1964 Acid Test organized by the Merry Pranksters in Watts, Los Angeles at &quot;Youth Opportunities&quot;. He participated with the experimental artists collective &quot;The TeePee Video Space Troupe&quot; (aka &quot;The TP Video Space Troupe&quot;) organized by filmmaker Shirley Clarke.

Darden appeared in various movies and television series. A signature performance is in the 1967 comedy &quot;The President&#x27;s Analyst&quot;; there he plays a major role as Kropotkin, a Soviet agent with a laid-back persona, much like Darden&#x27;s own. He played a junk dealer in another early film, &quot;Luv (1967)&quot;, based on the play of the same title by Murray Schisgal), which also starred Jack Lemmon, Peter Falk, Elaine May, and Nina Wayne. He also played the cold-hearted Kolp in &quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot;.

Among his early TV roles were the artist Karpathia in the &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; episode &quot;Toody and the Art World&quot;; a toy manufacturer in an episode of &quot;The Monkees&quot;; and Dr. Herb Chisholm in a 1976 episode of the sitcom &quot;The Practice&quot;. He appeared in &quot;Never Con a Killer,&quot; the 1976 pilot for the crime drama &quot;The Feather and Father Gang&quot;.

Darden was later featured in the 1985 comedy &quot;Real Genius&quot; as a highly respected, but befuddled college dean, and in 1986 in the Off-Broadway improvisational sketch comedy show &quot;Sills &amp; Company,&quot; directed by Paul Sills.

After triple heart bypass surgery, he lived in semi-retirement in Los Angeles; he then moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1992, where he died of congestive heart failure at age 65. His interment was at Lake Lawn Park and Mausoleum in his hometown of New Orleans.

==Works==

===Routines===

====&quot;The Metaphysics Lecture&quot;====
This faux university lecture was developed by Darden while with the Compass Players. It was first performed as a solo act in 1959 at the Gate of Horn music club. According to his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, this routine was influential with two generations of comedians. 

Darden assumes the character of a German-accented speaker, Prof. Walther von der Vogelweide (borrowing the name of the famous medieval poet). An announcer introduces the lecture as &quot;A Short Talk on the Universe&quot;, and the professor begins as follows: &quot;Now, why — you will ask me — have I chosen to speak on the Universe, rather than some other topic. Well, it&#x27;s very simple: there isn’t anything else!&quot; The lecture is loaded with digressions and double-talk about time, space, etc., ending with questions from the audience on which he improvises.

====&quot;Oedipus&quot;====
This was another Prof. Walther von der Vogelweide lecture (with the assistance of the rest of the Second City cast). The subject was &quot;free will and necessity in the light of […] &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;&quot;, or &quot;what would have happened to Oedipus if he had read the book before going on the journey&quot;. The professor plays the role of Oedipus and refuses to perform the acts that would lead to his fate, but finds that despite his apparent agency the other characters respond in ways that produce the same results.

In the first scene, Oedipus encounters his father Laius, knowing that if all goes according to the book the two will get into a brawl, and he will commit the serious sin of killing his own father. Aware of this, Oedipus is very deferential to Laius, only to find that the father is extremely touchy and hostile to anything that smacks of sycophancy. Despite Oedipus&#x27; continued deference and protestations, Laius becomes increasingly angry and finally suffers a fatal heart attack.

In the next scene, the Sphinx energetically tries to wheedle him into answering her riddle correctly, which Oedipus does not want to do. At one point she says, &quot;Think of the power—of the glory—&quot;. He responds, &quot;I don&#x27;t need power and glory, I&#x27;m a full professor.&quot;

In the last scene, Oedipus is on the very point of gouging his eyes out when he suddenly stops and says &quot;Wait a minute.&quot; He has realized something which he announces to the crowd: the actual results were due to chance or forced on him against his will. He explains how that applies to each &quot;choice&quot; and ends with &quot;It&#x27;s not my fault!&quot; The people murmur among themselves for a few seconds, then repeatedly shout in agreement, and his eyes are saved. The professor ends the sketch by saying, &quot;So you see, my dear students, the lesson that we learn from this is that Man &quot;has&quot; free will, but tragic poets do not, and Art is not Nature.&quot;

====&quot;Football Comes to the University of Chicago&quot;====
This sketch was originally developed for the Compass Players and revisited for Second City. It satirized the university and its students, presenting a possible explanation for the failure to introduce football. A typical coach teaches &quot;Football 202&quot; and struggles with the intellectual students. Darden plays Morgenstern, a student who states his field is the &quot;history of arithmetic&quot;. After the coach mentions the football positions called &quot;ends&quot;, Morgenstern asks where the beginnings for those ends are, because ends must have beginnings, according to Aristotle. The coach presents the football, and Morgenstern declares, &quot;It&#x27;s a demi-poly-tetrahedron.&quot;

===Television series===
* &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (1961) (Season 7 Episode 6: &quot;Beta Delta Gamma&quot;) as Franklin 
* &quot;Charlie Paradise&quot; TV series pilot (1960). Darden played an eccentric painter named Flute who is murdered in his Greenwich Village studio in this unsold pilot intended as a spinoff to the Edward Binns CBS drama &quot;Brenner&quot;, and which was eventually repackaged for air as the last episode of the series.
* &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; (1962) (Season 1 Episode 21: &quot;Toody and the Art World&quot;) Darden plays Karpathia, a painter whose work appears to awaken an enthusiasm for modern art in Toody. This episode is particularly notable because Karpathia&#x27;s temperament and accent somewhat resemble those of Professor Walther von der Vogelweide. Thus the portrayal gives us a hint of what Darden was like in his lectures. Darden&#x27;s scenes take up about 9 minutes of the episode.
* &quot;Honey West&quot; (1966) (Season 1 Episode 27: &quot;Little Green Robin Hood&quot;) as Dr. Gregory Ames 
* &quot;The Monkees&quot; (1966) (Season 1 Episode 3: &quot;Monkee vs. Machine&quot;) He plays the confused president of a toy company who is manipulated by Daggart (Stan Freberg), a scheming executive who wants to make shoddier toys for the purpose of &quot;planned obsolescence&quot;.
* &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; (1967) (Season 3 Episode 12: &quot;Jeannie and the Great Bank Robbery&quot;) as Milton 
* &quot;The Monkees&quot; (1968) (Season 2 Episode 19: &quot;The Monkee&#x27;s Paw&quot;) In a very brief scene, Darden has an uncredited role as a psychiatrist who angrily insists that the Monkees&#x27; interpretations of inkblots are wrong. This is notable because the portrayal is exactly like Professor Walther von der Vogelweide in his most vehement moments.
* &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; (1968) (Season 5 Episode 9: &quot;Valley of the Sun&quot;) as Sir Hubert Spencer
* &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; (1969) (Season 3 Episode 1: &quot;Saturday Night in Venice&quot;) as Ambassador Nikolai Palenkin
* &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; (1971) (Season 1 Episode 14: &quot;Never Trust an Honest Man&quot;) Oscar Harlenjen and Alan Harlenjen (In a dual role, as father and son)

* &quot;&quot; (1974) (Season 1 Episode 9: &quot;The Spanish Moss Murders&quot;) as Dr. Aaron Pollack 
* &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (1975) (TV movie) &quot;The New Original Wonder Woman&quot; 
* &quot;The Ghost Busters&quot; (1975) (Season 1 Episode 11: &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde...Together, for the First Time!&quot;) as Dr. Jekyll 
* &quot;Barney Miller&quot; (1976) (Season 2 Episode 22: &quot;The Mole&quot;) as Randolph Cook 
* &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; (1976) (TV movie) as Plover
* &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; (1976)

** (Season 3 Episode 18: &quot;The Secret of Bigfoot, Part 2&quot;) as Apploy
** (Season 4 Episode 1: &quot;The Return of Bigfoot, Part 1&quot;) as Apploy 
* &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot; (1976) (Season 2 Episode 1: &quot;The Return of Bigfoot: Part II&quot;) as Apploy 
* &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; (1977) (Season 2 Episode 23: &quot;Citizen Crane&quot;) as Charles Pfister Krane 
* &quot;Cheers&quot; (1983) (Season 2 Episode 4: &quot;Homicidal Ham&quot;) as Professor DeWitt (with fellow Second City alumni Shelley Long and George Wendt) 
* &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; (1984) (Season 2 Episode 12: &quot;The War of the Wonks&quot;) as Professor Edwin

<text>William A. Jurgens (July 3, 1928 — September 1, 1982) was an American Roman Catholic priest, composer, historian, musician, and translator of patristic and other works.

==Early life==
He was born July 3, 1928, in Akron, Ohio, to Charles B. and Ruth C. ( Gardner) Jurgens. He had two brothers (Charles and James) and two sisters (Donna and Jeanne).

Jurgens attended Immaculate Conception Elementary School and then St. Vincent High School in Akron, where he was president of the National Honor Society. He graduated in 1946.

Jurgens then attended St. Joseph Minor Seminary in Westmont, Illinois, before completing his religious studies at St. Mary Seminary in Wickliffe, Ohio. A talented organist, he played the instrument at Our Lady of Victory Church in Tallmadge, Ohio, while attending seminary. He was ordained on December 18, 1954, at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Cleveland, Ohio, by Archbishop Edward F. Hoban.

At the time of his ordination, Macmillan published his translation of St. John Chrysostom treatise &quot;On the Priesthood&quot;.

==Religious career==
Jurgens was assigned as assistant pastor at St. Michael the Archangel Church in Cleveland at the end of 1954. Jurgens left Cleveland in 1956 and began studying sacred music at the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music and eccesiastical history at Gregorian University, both in Rome, Italy. He studied Gregorian chant at the Pontifical Institute, and earned a doctorate in ecclesiastical history from Gregorian.

Jurgens returned to Cleveland in April 1959, and was named assistant pastor at Blessed Sacrament Church on Fulton Road. Less than two months later, he was assigned to the faculty of St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary where he was professor of patrology. He was given an additional assignment teaching at Borromeo Seminary in Wickliffe in 1961. He was appointed instructor of chant at both seminaries in 1965.

Jurgens was appointed Diocesan Director of Sacred Music in April 1961 after Rev. John H. Archibald of Holy Family Church in Stow, Ohio, resigned due to the press of duties in his parish. He served as director until 1968. Jurgens was also appointed to the Diocesan Liturgical Commission in August 1962, and was named the first chairman of the Diocesan Commission on Sacred Music in May 1964.

Bishop Clarence Issenmann made Jurgens his secretary in 1974.

In 1977, Bishop James Hickey appointed Jurgens as Diocesan Research Historian, and tasked him with writing a detailed history of the diocese. The first volume in this work, &quot;A History of the Diocese of Cleveland: The Prehistory of the Diocese to Its Establishment in 1847&quot;, was published in 1980. Jurgens had written a draft of a second volume by 1982, but it was never finished. Jurgens fell ill with cancer in December 1981, and died from complications of cancer and diabetes at Holy Family Cancer Center in Parma, Ohio, on September 1, 1982.

Jurgens was buried in in Brook Park, Ohio.

==Works==
===Theological and historical texts===
Jurgens translated a number of theological and musical works during his lifetime, and wrote books about early church theologians as well as the liturgy. Among these are:
*
*
*
* (co-authored with Cipriano Vagaggini and Leonard J. Doyle)

The three-volume &quot;Faith of the Early Fathers&quot; is now considered a standard patrological work. Catholic writer Karl Keating says it ranks with Joseph Tixeront&#x27;s &quot;History of Dogmas&quot; and Johannes Quasten &quot;Patrology&quot; as a fundamental collection of patrological works, the &quot;premier work of its kind&quot; and &quot;prime reading for the apologist&quot;. Jurgens and Tixeront cover the same years, more so than Quasten. Jurgens&#x27; work is more inclusive and contains works from a greater variety of authors. Reviewing &quot;The Faith of the Early Fathers&quot;, scholar Herbert T. Mayer applauded the work&#x27;s inclusiveness, the inclusion of canons and decrees, the length of excerpts (longer than in most works), Jurgens&#x27; doctrinal analysis, and the index (missing in many other works).

<doc id="1089535" wikidata="Q7918661" url="?curid=1089535" title="Veil of Darkness">
<text>Veil of Darkness is a horror-action-adventure game for MS-DOS, FM Towns and PC-98, which was developed by Event Horizon Software and published by Strategic Simulations in 1993. &quot;Veil of Darkness&quot; is a third person, 2D point-and-click adventure game with RPG elements featuring a fixed isometric perspective and a fair share of action-RPG style combat.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Veil of Darkness&quot; features an isometric point of view, a control panel customizable in size and an inventory system. All actions are controlled by the mouse and by areas / items within the control panel. A player can use either arrow keys for guiding movement or the mouse. The inventory can hold several items, and the player can also find bags and pouches that enable the player to carry more items. There is an indication in the control panel for weight (the knapsack bulges when inventory is too heavy), and for health (the player character in a coffin becomes a skeleton progressively from the feet upwards). There is a &#x27;mirror&#x27; that will indicate if the player has an ailment (aged, cursed, etc.), and also certain ailments show on the Player&#x27;s face in the Player portrait in the control panel. In conversations, the Player can click on a certain underlined word to pursue that topic, or the Player can type a word when the input cursor appears. If the typed word is appropriate, the Player will receive a response. For instance to end a conversation, the Player could click &#x27;Bye&#x27; or type &#x27;Bye&#x27;.

The game is non-linear: the player can wander about and explore freely within an area, but certain places or actions cannot progress until the player has done certain actions and/or found certain items. The player moves around in a dark valley, solving puzzles and occasionally killing monsters such as werewolves, vampires and skeletons. Different weapons work with different enemies, so the Player needs to find the right weapon for each battle. Also, one needs to find different plants (and sometimes other items) to cure different ailments. The puzzles are typical of a point-and-click adventure game. The puzzles consist mainly of piecing together what the player learns from conversations, finding and using objects and finding ways to get into locked areas or past a guardian.

==Plot==
The player assumes the role of a cargo pilot whose plane mysteriously crashes while he is flying over a remote valley in Romania. The player is rescued from the crash by Deirdre, the daughter of Kiril Kristoverikh, the wealthiest man in the valley. While exploring their surroundings, the player quickly discovers that the valley&#x27;s inhabitants are unable to escape and are plagued by various evils. Kiril explains to the player that their arrival was foretold in a prophecy, and that they are destined to destroy Kairn; the valley&#x27;s tyrannical ruler, who long ago rejected his humanity to become an immortal vampire and trapped the entire valley in eternal darkness.

The player begins exploring the valley in search of a way to destroy Kairn and escape, meeting its inhabitants, gathering items, and battling evil creatures along the way. As the player progresses, they begin to complete various deeds described as part of the prophecy; this includes healing some of Kairn&#x27;s victims, slaying a werewolf responsible for killing numerous villagers, and allowing the tormented souls of Kairn&#x27;s murdered brothers and father to pass on to the afterlife. They also end up slaying Andrei, Kiril&#x27;s son, who was reanimated as a zombie after Kiril unsuccessfully appealed to Kairn to revive him.

As they prepare to slay Andrei, Kiril informs the player that Kairn kidnapped Deirdre to transform her into one of his vampiric brides, and they resolve to rescue her. Eventually, they discover the Agrippa; an evil sentient tome that first granted Kairn his powers, and was subsequently imprisoned once Kairn deemed it a threat. In response, it placed a curse on Kairn, which became the prophecy foretelling the player&#x27;s arrival. The player frees the Agrippa using a key found beside Kairn&#x27;s coffin in his stronghold; while there, they meet the imprisoned Deirdre. Deirdre reveals that her father is truly corrupt, and willingly turned her over to Kairn in exchange for being able to leave the valley.

The Agrippa reveals Kairn&#x27;s true name to the player (randomly generated from a list of suggestions) so they can weaken him, and vanishes. Once the prophecy is nearly completed, the player heads to Kairn&#x27;s stronghold, and battles him using a combination of items to weaken his powers. Kairn retreats to his coffin in order to regain his strength, only to discover that it had been previously sealed by the player. The player finally defeats Kairn by driving a wooden stake through his heart and beheading him, ending his evil for good. The valley is freed from Kairn&#x27;s influence, and the player leaves Romania on a boat with Deirdre, embracing her.

==Intellectual property rights==
Event Horizon Software was eventually renamed DreamForge Intertainment before being dissolved in 2001. The company developed three other games: &quot;The Summoning&quot;, &quot;Dusk of the Gods&quot; and &quot;DarkSpyre&quot;.

Strategic Simulations, Inc. was bought by Ubisoft in 2004.

==Reception==

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote that &quot;Veil of Darkness&quot; &quot;held me in rapt attention until I had seen it through to its resolution&quot;. While critical of the brief length of the game, the magazine stated that &quot;the experience is one to be savored ... definitely one that I am glad to have played&quot;. The magazine later nominated &quot;Veil of Darkness&quot; for its Role-Playing Game of the Year award, alongside &quot;The Summoning&quot;. Power Unlimited gave a score of 70% writing: &quot;&quot;Veil of Darkness&quot; may not have an original story (it&#x27;s very similar to Dracula), but there are plenty and many assignments, all of which work together to keep the game fun. Only the intro is a bit too long&quot;.

James Trunzo reviewed &quot;Veil of Darkness&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #37 (July/Aug., 1993) and stated that &quot;On the down side, the music seems appropriate, but becomes intrusive afte a while. Some pizzles seem overly difficult early in the game, and what combat there is can take a while to complete. Still, &quot;Veil&quot; is an excellent change of pace from the typical dungeon crawl. If you enjoy the games of the horror ilk, &quot;Veil of Darkness&quot; is definitely worth a try.&quot;

<doc id="1089547" wikidata="Q2560244" url="?curid=1089547" title="Middleton, Greater Manchester">
<text>Middleton is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England, on the River Irk. It is southwest of Rochdale and northeast of Manchester. Middleton had a population of 42,972 at the 2011 Census. It lies on the northern edge of Manchester, with Blackley to the south and Moston to the south east.

==History==
Historically part of Lancashire, Middleton&#x27;s name comes from it being the centre of several circumjacent settlements. It was an ecclesiastical parish of the hundred of Salford, ruled by aristocratic families. The Church of St Leonard is a Grade I listed building. The Flodden Window in the church&#x27;s sanctuary is thought to be the oldest war memorial in the United Kingdom, memorialising the archers of Middleton who fought at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. In 1770, Middleton was a village of twenty houses, but in the 18th and 19th centuries it grew into a thriving and populous seat of textile manufacture and it was granted borough status in 1886.

Langley in the north of the town was one of Manchester City Council&#x27;s overspill council estates, whilst Alkrington in the south is a suburban area.

In 616, Æthelfrith of Bernicia, an Anglo-Saxon King, crossed the Pennines with an army and passed through Manchester to defeat the Brythons in the Battle of Chester. A wave of Anglian colonists followed this military conquest and their settlements are identified by the &quot;ton&quot; Old English suffix to local place names. Royton, Crompton, Moston, Clayton, Ashton, Chadderton and Middleton are a number of settlements northeast of Manchester suggested to have been founded as part of this colonisation. It is therefore thought that Middleton as a settlement dates from the 7th century.

Although unmentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, Middleton is said to be &quot;of great antiquity&quot;; a community at Middleton is thought to have evolved outwards from a church that existed considerably earlier than the Norman conquest of England.

The name Middleton first appears in 1194, and derives from the Old English &quot;middel-tūn&quot;, meaning middle farm or settlement, probably a reference to its central position between Rochdale and Manchester.

During the Middle Ages, Middleton was a centre of domestic flannel and woollen cloth production.

The development of Middleton as a centre of commerce occurred during the 17th and 18th centuries as a result of the effect of the Industrial Revolution. Additional to this, Lord Suffield obtained a Royal Charter from King George III in 1791 to hold a weekly market and three annual summer fairs in Middleton. Suffield built a market house, warehouses and shambles in the town at his own expense.

Industrial scale textile manufacture was introduced to Middleton as a result of the Industrial Revolution. Middleton became a centre for silk production in the 18th century, which developed into a cotton spinning industry by the mid-19th century and which continued through to the mid-20th century. This transition gave rise to Middleton as a mill town.

The town&#x27;s local newspaper, the &quot;Middleton Guardian&quot; has a history going back to Victorian times. copies can be found in the local library of every publication since 1908.

JW Lees houses its brewery at Middleton Junction. The brewery owns several pubs in the Greater Manchester area.

The town was linked to the national rail network until 1964 when Middleton and Middleton Junction railway stations closed to passengers. Mills Hill and Moston are now the nearest stations.

==Governance==
Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire from the early 12th century, Middleton was once an ecclesiastical parish of the hundred of Salford, and in Oldham poor law union.

In 1861 commissioners were established for the improvement of Middleton and Tonge townships or civil parishes. In 1878, the township of Alkrington and parts of the townships of Hopwood and Thornham were added to the area of the commissioners. It was in 1886 this territory was incorporated as a borough, giving it Borough status in the United Kingdom. Following the Local Government Act 1894 parts of Great Heaton and Little Heaton townships were added to the newly created Municipal Borough of Middleton, a local government district in the administrative county of Lancashire. In 1933 there were exchanges of territory between the borough of Middleton, the City of Manchester and Chadderton Urban District. In the same year, parts of Unsworth were amalgamated with Middleton, whilst part of it was moved to Royton Urban District. It was proposed in the Redcliffe-Maud Report that Middleton become part of a new Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, however, following the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Middleton was abolished and its territory became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. The council was based at Parkfield House.

The Middleton parliamentary constituency was created by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. It was abolished in 1918 when Middleton became part of the Middleton and Prestwich constituency.

Today Middleton forms part of the Heywood and Middleton parliamentary constituency, and the Blackley and Middleton South parliamentary constituency, represented in the House of Commons by Elsie Blundell, &amp; Graham Stringer respectively, both of the Labour Party.

==Geography==

At (53.5547, −2.1887), Middleton stands on undulated land immediately north of Manchester; the towns of Chadderton and Royton are close to the east. The town of Rochdale lies to the north-northeast. The towns name is derived from Middle-town, from its situation midway between Manchester and Rochdale. It is situated on an ancient road between those places. Middleton town centre is around above sea level.

Middleton experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year. Middleton is watered by two confluent streams which have their rise in the immediate district.

Much of Middleton&#x27;s built environment is characterised by its 19th-century red-brick terraced houses, the infrastructure that was built to support these and the town&#x27;s former cotton mills, although from the middle of the 20th century the town saw the growth of its outlying residential areas of Langley, Hollin and Boarshaw which is predominately ex-local authority housing. The skyline is marked by St. Leonard&#x27;s Church. The urban structure of Middleton is regular in comparison to most towns in England. Residential dwellings and streets are located around the town centre.

There is a mixture of high-density urban areas, suburbs, and semi-rural locations in Middleton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The territory of Middleton is contiguous with other urban areas on its southern and eastern sides, and for purposes of the Office for National Statistics, forms part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom&#x27;s third largest conurbation. The M60 motorway passes to the south of Middleton; the M62 passes to the north. A heavy rail line enters Middleton from Moston and Chadderton to the south, and passes to the east of Middleton&#x27;s town centre before continuing on northwards to Rochdale.

Varyingly agreed divisions and suburbs of Middleton include Alkrington, Bowlee, Boarshaw, Cheapside, Greengate, Hebers, Hollin, Hopwood, Jumbo, Langley, Moorclose, Rhodes, Stake Hill, Middleton Junction, Thornham and Tonge. Mills Hill is an area shared between Middleton and Chadderton.

==Economy==

Industrial polymer, thermoplastics and nonwovens producer The Vita Group have a registered office in Middleton. Kitbag operate a distribution centre from Greengate in Middleton.

Bluebird Bus and Coach is a travel company based in Middleton. Bus company JP Travel has been based in Middleton since 1974. Robert McBride, a household and personal care product manufacturers, is also based in the town.

==Landmarks==

Several of Middleton&#x27;s buildings were designed by Edgar Wood, a local-born influential architect of his day. Several in Middleton are landmarks and are notable.

Middleton has recently benefited from redevelopments which have seen the construction of a new sports, leisure and civic centre, &#x27;Middleton Arena&#x27;. A large new Tesco supermarket was opened in the town centre in 2013.
In the early 1970s, The Arndale Property Trust cleared land adjacent to Middleton Gardens to build an &#x27;American-style&#x27; modern shopping precinct. The Middleton Arndale Centre commenced trading in 1971, although it was officially opened by the Duchess of Kent in March 1972.
===St. Leonard&#x27;s Church===

The Parish Church of St Leonard was completed in 1524, incorporating two stone arches made of stonework from an earlier Norman church. A wooden Saxon church is believed to have occupied the site long before the Norman church was built, in about 1100.

The present church was built by Sir Richard Assheton, in celebration of the knighthood granted to him by Henry VIII for his part in the Battle of Flodden, the largest battle ever fought between England and Scotland. The Flodden Window, in the sanctuary, is thought to be the oldest war memorial in the UK. It memorialises on it the names of the Middleton archers who fought at Flodden Field in 1513. The church also has one of the finest collections of monumental brasses in the area, including the only brass in the UK of an English Civil War officer in full armour, Major-General Sir Ralph Assheton.

The church was designated a Grade I listed building in 1957. Middleton Archaeological Society (MAS) have been investigating Clarke Brow, a public field next to St Leonard&#x27;s Square, and carried out its first dig there in August and September 2013. An account of the Society&#x27;s research can be found on their website

===Tonge Hall===

Tonge Hall is a grade II* listed Tudor structure badly damaged by an arson attack in 2007. Rochdale Council are now (2012) in the process of buying the property from the owner for a nominal sum with a view to restoration. The North West Building Preservation Trust, a registered charity, is likely to take over its long term maintenance.

Middleton Archaeological Society (MAS) has been undertaking research into Tonge and Tonge Hall. The first of these investigations took place in August 2012 and work is ongoing. The MAS website has more information including photographs of the dig at 

As of 2019, the building still stands derelict, surrounded by supporting scaffolding. No work has been undertaken on restoration since the arson attack.

===Alkrington Hall===
Alkrington Hall was built in 1736 and was the seat of the Lever family. Its dominant position on a wooded hillside, looks out over the Irk Valley towards Middleton. Some of the original parkland around the hall has now been developed into high end housing, while the rest is a Local Nature Reserve, Alkrington Wood

===Old Boar&#x27;s Head Inn===
Situated below the parish church, on Long Street, this was originally a coaching inn on the road between Chester and York. It is said to date from at least 1632 and parts of it date back to the 1500s.
=== Warwick Mill ===
This building is situated on Oldham Road, opposite the Middleton office of the Greater Manchester Police. Warwick Mill was a cotton mill built in 1907, with 5 machine floors within. It is a Grade II listed building and currently sits derelict, although plans have been made to convert the building several times, none of which have been carried out.
=== Lodge Mill ===
Lodge Mill is reputedly Middleton&#x27;s oldest surviving mill. Situated opposite to the old substation, the building dates back to 1839, and was a silk and cotton mill. A fire on December 30th, 2021 damaged the back mill. Damage was also caused to the front mill when, during demolition of the back mill, the back of the engine house for the front mill was accidentally demolished. The front mill is currently occupied by a local ice cream parlour.
==Sport==

Middleton is host to many local sports clubs, including Middleton Cricket Club who are currently playing in the Lancashire League (cricket). Four golf clubs are within easy reach of the town centre: North Manchester Golf Glub, The Manchester Golf Club (at Slattocks), Heaton Park Golf Club and Blackley Golf Club.
In January 2009, Middleton saw the opening of a new £13 million sports and leisure venue in the town centre. The Middleton Arena is a joint venture by Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council and supermarket chain Tesco. The facility has replaced the old Middleton Civic Centre and Middleton Leisure Centre, allowing the site formerly occupied by these buildings to be cleared for further development into a supermarket. Said development resulted in the opening of a large Tesco Extra supermarket on July 6th, 2013.

Middleton is also home to Rochdale Triathlon Club. Weekly coached swimming sessions are currently held at Middleton Arena, Tuesday 7-8pm and Thursday 9-10pm. The Hopwood Hall College offers a gym to both its students and members of the general public.

==Transport==
In 2005, the new Middleton bus station was opened to replace the old one, next to the Middleton Arndale shopping centre. The station, with 13 stands, cost £4.5 million and replaced the previous station which dated to the 1970s. The majority of services in Middleton are operated by Stagecoach Manchester and serve destinations including Bury, Oldham, Rochdale and Tameside. As it is in Greater Manchester, Middleton is serviced by the new (as of 2024) Bee Network initiative, provided and run by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM). Bus services include the 17 between Rochdale and Manchester, the 18 between Langley and Manchester, the 59 between Oldham and Manchester, the 125 between Middleton and Heywood, and the 163 between Bury and Manchester. Middleton is located close to junction 19 of the M62 motorway and, at Rhodes, junction 21 of the M60 motorway.
Mills Hill railway station is on the eastern boundary of town, one mile east of the town centre, with direct services to Rochdale, Manchester Victoria, Bolton, Wigan and Leeds. It opened in 1838 and closed in 1842, it was later re-opened in 1985 and remains in use. Middleton railway station, near the town centre, was the terminus of a short branch line, which closed to passengers in 1964.
A car chase scene of the 2001 British-made Samuel L. Jackson film The 51st State was filmed on a stretch of the M60 motorway, which runs alongside Rhodes and through Alkrington, just outside the centre of the town.

In May 2021 the Mayor of Greater Manchester asked that Transport for Greater Manchester bring forward a business case for extending the Metrolink tram system to Middleton, as part of a wider regeneration scheme.

==Education==

Almost every part of Middleton is served by a school of some kind, some with religious affiliations. According to the Office for Standards in Education, schools within the town perform at mixed levels.

Primary schools include St. Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School, Alkrington Primary School, St. Michael’s CofE Primary School, St. Thomas-More’s Roman Catholic Primary School and Middleton Parish School. Cardinal Langley Roman Catholic High School, formerly Cardinal Langley Grammar School, is one of the local secondary schools in the area, others being Middleton Technology School, the Edgar Wood Academy and St. Anne&#x27;s Academy. Further education is provided by the Sixth Form at Cardinal Langley, as well as the Middleton campus of Hopwood Hall College. What is presently said campus was, from 1946 to 1989, a De La Salle Catholic College of Higher Education affiliated to the Victoria University of Manchester. Founded as a teacher training college, the chapel, designed by Sir Frederick Gibberd, was the architectural prototype for the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. The chapel still exists on the campus, known as the Milnrow building, but its spire is no longer topped with a cross. Hopwood Hall College benefits from its extensive grounds and leisure facilities which were developed over many years by the De La Salle College.

<doc id="1089553" wikidata="Q6781295" url="?curid=1089553" title="Supreme Court of Maryland">
<text>The Supreme Court of Maryland (previously the Maryland Court of Appeals) is the highest court of the U.S. state of Maryland. The court, which is composed of one chief justice and six associate justices, meets in the Robert C. Murphy Courts of Appeal Building in the state capital, Annapolis. The term of the Court begins the second Monday of September. The Court is unique among American courts in that the justices wear red robes.

==History==

As the highest tribunal in Maryland, the Court of Appeals was created by Article 56 of the Maryland Constitution of 1776. The Court was to be &quot;composed of persons of integrity and sound judgment in the law, whose judgment shall be final and conclusive in all cases of appeal, from the general court, court of chancery, and court of admiralty&quot;. With counsel, advice and consent, the Governor appointed all of the judges. Five judges were commissioned in 1778, but that number was reduced to three in 1801. The Court was restructured in 1806 by dividing the State into six judicial districts with a chief judge and two associate judges for each district appointed by the Governor and Council. Together, these six chief judges constituted the Court of Appeals which began to sit on the Eastern Shore at Easton as well as on the Western Shore at the State capital.

The Maryland Constitution of 1851 divided the State into four judicial districts. Voters of each district elected a judge to the Court of Appeals for a ten-year term. The Court became responsible solely for appellate duties and sat only at Annapolis, whereas before it sat in various locations throughout the State. Five judges, each elected from one of five judicial districts, were prescribed by the Maryland Constitution of 1864.

The Maryland Constitution of 1867 (currently in effect) returned to the older form of requiring Court of Appeals judges to assume trial court and appellate duties. In seven judicial circuits, the Governor, with Senate advice and consent, designated a chief judge. In the eighth judicial circuit in Baltimore, the voters elected the chief judge. These eight chief judges then constituted the Court of Appeals.

Judicial reorganization in 1943 provided for a five-member Court of Appeals elected for terms of fifteen years. The five judges included two from Baltimore City and one each from three appellate judicial circuits. In 1960, the number of judges was increased to the present-day seven. Until 1994, there was one from each of the first five Appellate Judicial Circuits and two from the Sixth Appellate Judicial Circuit (Baltimore), but a Constitutional amendment realigned the circuits to create seven circuits with one judge from each. Since 1975, the Court of Appeals has heard cases almost exclusively by way of &quot;certiorari&quot;. As a result, the Court&#x27;s formerly excessive workload has been reduced to a more manageable level, thus allowing the Court to devote more time to the most important and far-reaching issues.

Maryland was formerly one of only two states whose highest judicial body was called a &quot;Court of Appeals&quot; rather than a &quot;Supreme Court,&quot; along with the New York Court of Appeals. In the 2022 general election held on November 8, 2022, voters approved a constitutional amendment to change the name of the court to the &quot;Supreme Court of Maryland&quot;, and the title of its judges to &quot;Justice.&quot; The same amendment also renamed the intermediate appellate court from the Court of Special Appeals to the Appellate Court of Maryland. The new names became effective on December 14, 2022.

==Functions==
As Maryland&#x27;s highest court, the Supreme Court of Maryland reviews cases of both major and minor importance. Throughout the year, the Supreme Court of Maryland holds hearings on the adoption or amendment of rules of practice and procedure. It also supervises the Attorney Grievance Commission and State Board of Law Examiners in attorney disciplinary and admission matters. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Maryland, designated by the Governor, is the constitutional administrative head of the Maryland judicial system.

Cases typically come before the Supreme Court of Maryland on a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Appellate Court of Maryland. The court can decline the petition, and refuse to hear the case, or it can grant the &quot;cert,&quot; and hear the appeal. The justices sometimes decide to hear an appeal before the lower appellate court has heard the case. This is known as the Court &#x27;granting certiorari on its own motion&#x27;, or &#x27;reaching down&#x27;. In this instance, the writ of certiorari is issued to the trial court, rather than to the Appellate Court of Maryland (Maryland&#x27;s intermediate appellate court, or appellate court of right).

The court does not sit in panels; all seven justices sit on each case (&quot;en banc&quot;) unless there is a disqualification, in which event a judge from another court, or a retired appellate judge, may be specially assigned to sit in the place of the disqualified justice. In practice, almost all cases are heard by seven justices, though a quorum for the court is five justices.

While it is generally an appellate court and hears most cases on appeal, the Supreme Court of Maryland has exclusive jurisdiction over certain matters, such as legislative redistricting, removal of certain officers, and certification of questions of law. Additionally, it had exclusive jurisdiction in death penalty appeals prior to the abolition of capital punishment in Maryland.

The Supreme Court of Maryland likewise retains original jurisdiction to discipline all attorneys admitted to the practice of law in Maryland. It can impose penalties ranging from reprimands to the ultimate punishment, disbarment.

==Justices==

===Appointment and qualifications===
The seven justices of the Supreme Court of Maryland are appointed by the Governor of Maryland with Senate consent. They serve ten-year terms. However, note that the ballot for re-election says only &#x27;for continuance in office&#x27;. I.e. there is no opposing candidate.

The justices of the court are required to be citizens of and qualified voters in Maryland. Prior to their appointment, they must have lived in Maryland for at least five years, and must have lived for at least six months in the appellate judicial circuit from which they are appointed. They must be at least thirty years of age at the time of appointment, and must have been admitted to practice law in Maryland. Appointees should be &quot;most distinguished for integrity, wisdom and sound legal knowledge.&quot;

After initial appointment by the Governor and confirmation by the Senate, members of the court, at the first general election occurring at least one year after their appointment, run for continuance in office on their records without opposition. If the voters reject the retention in office of a justice, or the vote is tied, the office becomes vacant. Otherwise, the incumbent justice is retained in office for a ten-year term. This requirement of voter approval is similar to provisions in the Missouri Plan, a non-partisan method for selecting judges which is used by 11 states. Like all Maryland judges, members of the Supreme Court of Maryland must retire by their 70th birthday.

There is one justice from each of the state&#x27;s seven Judicial Circuits. Each justice is required to be a resident of his or her respective circuit. The circuits are currently as follows:

===Current justices===
Unlike most other American federal, state, and local courts, the justices on the Supreme Court of Maryland wear red robes and with white cross-collars, reminiscent of British court dress. Judges at all other levels of the Maryland judiciary wear the more customary black robes.


===Senior justices===
Justices of the Supreme Court of Maryland who no longer wish to work full time, or wish to have more control over their schedules, may become senior justices and be appointed to hear cases if: they were not removed or involuntarily retired from the bench, they did not leave the bench for reason of disability, they did not leave the bench because they lost an election or did not gain Senate confirmation, they were not censured by the Supreme Court of Maryland upon recommendation of the Commission on Judicial Disabilities, and they do not engage in the practice of law.

<text>Admiral Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas, (27 October 1862 – 30 August 1928) was a British Royal Navy officer.

During World War I he commanded the 5th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, flying his flag in , and fought at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916.

==Background==
Evan-Thomas&#x27; family came from Wales, where they had owned the Llwynmadoc estate near Beulah, Powys, for two hundred years. The family also owned the Gnoll at Neath in Glamorgan and Pencerrig at Builth Wells, but nonetheless suffered a shortage of money to support their seven children in the style they might have wished. Evan-Thomas had to rely upon his own salary rather than family money to support himself through his life.

Hugh Evan-Thomas was born the son of Charles Evan-Thomas, who was High Sheriff of Brecknockshire for 1885 and died at Cople in Bedfordshire aged 65 on 30 August 1928. A memorial service was held at Eglwys Oen Duw church in Llwynmadoc, Wales. A brass plaque in the church records his death. A year later, the council of Neath, Glamorgan, purchased the Gnoll estate where Evan-Thomas was born to serve as a public park, where a war memorial would be erected. Jellicoe wrote a tribute to Evan-Thomas saying, &#x27;If I had one loyal and splendid supporter during the Great War in the Grand Fleet, one who never failed me, one who led his ships magnificently, and not only led them magnificently but brought them to a pitch of efficiency that was a pattern for the whole of the Grand fleet, It was Admiral Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas&#x27;.

In 1877, at the age of 15, Hugh Thomas was a naval cadet on the training ship HMS &quot;Britannia&quot;. In September, the royal princes George Frederick and his elder brother, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence, both joined the ship as part of their education. The princes&#x27; tutor, John Neale Dalton, who accompanied them, approved of Thomas and permitted him to become friends with the boys. Thomas left Britannia in December 1877, but not before a friendship was established. George sent him a Christmas card (from &#x27;Sprat&#x27;, while Albert was &#x27;herring&#x27; and Thomas &#x27;Old Voice&#x27;), both wrote letters and Dalton wrote to Thomas requesting that he write back and remain in contact.

In February 1878, Thomas was posted to the barque-rigged battery ship , which was part of the Mediterranean fleet commanded by Sir Geoffrey Phipps Hornby. Thomas&#x27; father, Charles Evan Thomas, changed the family name from Thomas to Evan-Thomas. Thomas&#x27; report from the ship&#x27;s captain, Nowell Salmon, reported that Midshipman Evan-Thomas had &quot;conducted himself with sobriety zeal &amp; attention &amp; to my satisfaction&quot;. &quot;Swiftsure&quot; was stationed in the Gulf of Saros off Gallipoli in July 1878 when Evan-Thomas and another officer were ashore and were arrested by Russian soldiers. The matter was shortly resolved and the men released, but was a reflection of continuing tension in the area just after signing of the treaty of Berlin.

In August 1878, Evan-Thomas transferred to the barque-rigged turret ship, , captained by Algernon Lyons, who was his first cousin once removed. Lyons reported he &quot;conducted himself with sobriety and entirely to my satisfaction&quot;, but his successor as captain of &quot;Monarch&quot;, George Tryon, described him as &quot;a very promising young officer in every respect&quot;.

==Royal duties==
In 1879, Evan-Thomas was chosen to join , as part of a crew hand-picked to be a good influences on the two princes who now continued their naval careers on the ship. &quot;Bacchante&quot; made three cruises: the first to the Mediterranean and West Indies, the second to Spain and Ireland, and the third a round-world trip. The third cruise departed South Railway Jetty in September 1880 in the company of three other corvettes and the frigate . The planned itinerary was interrupted by the first Boer War, causing consternation for Queen Victoria that her grandsons were now in a war zone. However, the ship was not involved in action and royal activities were limited to visits to Zulu chief Cetshwayo and other social functions. A more serious danger to the ship occurred in a storm off Western Australia, where the rudder was damaged and the ship could only be brought safely under control by sending men aloft so that their bodies acted as makeshift sails to turn the ship. Evan-Thomas was one of the few people allowed to socialise with the princes. In June 1881, he became senior midshipman and their regular companion on trips ashore. These included trips for riding, shooting, visits to gold mines and other sightseeing locations, and a visit from the Emperor in Japan. In spring 1882, &quot;Baccante&quot; returned to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal and stopped to visit the princes&#x27; uncle, King George I of Greece. On 6 June 1882, Evan-Thomas departed the ship to return home, having been promoted to sub-lieutenant. 

Evan-Thomas spent seven months at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, on a lieutenants training course, where he became friendly with Lieutenant John Jellicoe (later first sea lord and commander of the British fleet during World War I). He then attended a gunnery course at , then commanded by John Fisher. Evan-Thomas continued to write to the princes during 1883, visiting Prince Edward at Sandringham and at Trinity college (George was at sea). In 1883, he was promoted to Lieutenant; Prince George wrote congratulating him and observing that his father had been pressing the lords of the admiralty for the promotion. Prince Edward wrote, mentioning that he had suggested to Lord Alcester that Evan-Thomas would like a posting to , while Dalton persuaded the Prince of Wales to recommend Evan-Thomas for a posting to the Royal yacht. The first naval lord, Astley Cooper Key, declined the princes&#x27; recommendation, proposing his own son for the Royal yacht instead. However, he did obtain the posting to &quot;Sultan&quot;, where he served for 31 months until an illness forced his return to England on half pay for six months. &quot;Sultan&quot; had three captains during his time aboard, the last, Richard King, describing him as &#x27;a thorough seaman and most efficient officer in every way. Active and zealous.&#x27;

Thomas now took up a posting to as flag-lieutenant to his cousin, Rear Admiral Sir Algernon Lyons, something that had been arranged before his illness. A letter to Prince George noted that he was still not fully recovered, hoping that the climate in Bermuda would be good for him. He remained on &quot;Bellerophon&quot; for nine months, before returning to England for ten months, again on half pay for health reasons. In August 1888, he was sent to the sail training ship , from which home leave was possible and he assisted in his father&#x27;s election campaign to the local council. In spring 1889, he attended &quot;Excellent&quot; for a gunnery course, and then &quot;Vernon&quot; for torpedo training. Prince George also attended at the same time. In 1889, he served briefly on , before a permanent posting to her in December when she sailed to the Mediterranean as flagship to Vice Admiral Sir Anthony Hiley Hoskins. In May 1890, the ship was &#x27;swapped&#x27; for , which had been intended to serve as flagship, but whose construction had been delayed. The crews of the two ships changed places, with &quot;Camperdown&quot; returning to the Channel fleet. Hoskins was impressed with Evan-Thomas&#x27; performance, placing him in charge of arrangements for refloating &quot;Victoria&quot; after she ran aground in the Gulf of Corinth in February 1891. Hoskins was in the habit of leaving the bridge during manoeuvres, so that his junior officers would get a chance acting as admiral to complete them.

On 14 January 1892, a telegram arrived on &quot;Victoria&quot; advising of the death of Prince Edward, and as officer of the watch, Evan-Thomas was responsible for ordering flags to half mast. A few weeks later, he was transferred to the royal yacht at Prince George&#x27;s request. The ship was unready for sea due to problems with supplying boilers, leaving Thomas with little to do. George, however, received command of . Prince George had received rapid promotions and was thus commander of the ship with much less experience than would normally be the case. In such circumstances, it was normal to appoint an older officer as first lieutenant, but instead the post went to Evan-Thomas. Other officers were also selected from friends of the prince. As a new ship, &quot;Melampus&quot; was commissioned in June 1892, proceeded to trials off Ireland and then took part in the Cowes week naval review. The ship received creditable reports, and Evan-Thomas was commended in the admiralty formal report for his part in preparing the ship. The ship&#x27;s company was then disbanded, with Evan-Thomas returning to duties on &quot;Osborne&quot;, captained by Archibald Berkeley Milne.

&quot;Osborne&quot; remained out of service throughout 1892, giving Evan-Thomas plenty of time for shore leave. In February 1893, &quot;Osborne&quot; sailed for Genoa where they met Prince George, his mother and sisters for a royal tour of the Mediterranean. Evan Thomas, with other officers, frequently accompanied the royal party ashore. In a relatively small ship he was required to stand sea watches, but also had direct responsibility for all details of ensuring royal life ran smoothly. The ship returned to England on 3 June. Milne reported he was &#x27;a zealous and hardworking officer and in every way to my satisfaction&#x27;.

==Mediterranean Squadron==
On 22 June 1893, the flagship of the Mediterranean fleet, HMS &quot;Victoria&quot;, collided with HMS &quot;Camperdown&quot;, resulting in serious damage to &quot;Camperdown&quot;, but the sinking of &quot;Victoria&quot; with the loss of 358 lives. Vice-Admiral George Tryon, who had ordered the manoeuvre which resulted in the collision, was amongst those who drowned. It became necessary to find a replacement as commander of the squadron, and Admiral Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, 3rd Baronet, was appointed. Culme-Seymour first acquired as secretary Staff Paymaster Henry Rickard, formerly secretary to Admiral of the fleet Prince Alfred, who had just ceased to be commander in chief of Plymouth. Culme-Seymour next telegraphed to Evan-Thomas, requesting that he would take the post of flag-lieutenant. Evan-Thomas hesitated, because the post was at least on paper less than a lieutenant of his seniority might expect. However, the request was endorsed by Admiral Lord Clanwilliam, and also the first sea lord, Sir Anthony Hoskins. Evan-Thomas went to see both admirals who assured him he had been chosen on merit, as it was felt that under the circumstances the best man possible was required for the post.

Culme-Seymour was concerned to restore the efficiency of his squadron, in particular through exercises to build the confidence of his ships&#x27; captains that they could work together effectively and without further mishaps. Evan-Thomas gained considerable experience in working with a fleet, and in particular a comprehensive knowledge of the signal book. Control of a fleet at this time was by a system of flag signals from the command ship, which had to be read and obeyed by other ships. The signal book had grown to contain thousands of flag combinations to give detailed instructions, and controversy had arisen within the navy whether this system would be practical in battle. Tryon had been an advocate of a much simpler system, where captains had greater latitude simply to &#x27;follow the leader&#x27; and use their own initiative rather than waiting for explicit orders. Ironically, the ship collision had happened during manoeuvres using the traditional system, not when captains were supposed to be acting independently, and had they used initiative rather than following incorrect flag commands, the accident could have been avoided. Nonetheless, a perception arose that the simplified system giving more independence to captains was somehow to blame, and the navy as a whole moved back to detailed flag instructions. Evan-Thomas at the centre of this reversal of policy in the Mediterranean squadron, gained an expectation for accurate and detailed flag commands which contributed to later difficulties at the Battle of Jutland, where signal failures contributed to the loss of British ships. Other experiments continued to try to improve the effectiveness of communication between ships, including semaphore, searchlight and carrier pigeon.

Evan-Thomas continued to suffer from illness while in the Mediterranean, and in 1894 received sick leave to return to England. While he was indeed ill, the leave was also granted to allow him to formally propose to and marry Hilda Barnard, who he had intended to marry immediately before his unexpected posting to the Mediterranean. The wedding took place on 18 July 1894 at St. Saviours Church, Walton Place, Knightsbridge. In November the couple moved to Valletta on Malta where the fleet was based. Social life on Malta remained impressive, with royalty and other dignitaries stopping at Malta and being entertained at Admiralty House. Evan-Thomas&#x27; term in the Mediterranean ceased in December 1896. Culme-Seymour wrote that &#x27;he has great tact and judgement – a thorough knowledge of his duties (signal and otherwise) and both with the fleet in the summer at sea and on shore in Malta has been all that I could wish&#x27;. On 1 January 1897, he was promoted to commander.

Evan-Thomas became secretary to an admiralty committee set up to revise the signal book. In May 1898 he was present with a number of senior officers to witness an experimental wireless transmission from a wooden hut, on a clifftop on the Isle of wight, where Guglielmo Marconi had set up a wireless transmitter. A similar station had been set up at Bournemouth, some fourteen miles away. Afterwards Evan-Thomas wrote to Vice-Admiral sir Compton Domville, chairman of the signals committee, reporting the success of the experiment, and recommending a trial on board two warships. The battleship and cruisers and were each equipped with radios for the 1899 manoeuvres, and transmitted messages up to 60 miles.

Work on the signal book was completed in 1898 and a new version published. In November, Evan-Thomas became commander of the Portsmouth Signal School. was still officially flagship at Portsmouth, and so Evan-Thomas was recorded as part of her crew. Culme-Seymour had already been appointed commander of Portsmouth and took with him a number of other officers from the Mediterranean, so the posting was effectively a reunion. Once again, Culme-Seymour held regular dinner parties for VIPs, including Prince George and naval dignitaries, which Evan-Thomas attended.

In November 1900, Evan-Thomas was appointed to his first independent command, the cruiser HMS &quot;Pioneer&quot;, which was part of the Mediterranean fleet, at age 38. The fleet was now commanded by Admiral John Fisher. After two years he was promoted to captain on 26 June 1902, and again transferred to for service at the Admiralty. The following year he was chosen as flag captain for Vice-Admiral Lord Charles Beresford in the channel squadron, commanding 1903–1904 and 1904–1905. Beresford was acquainted with Evan-Thomas before the appointment, having sought advice from him on the new signal book when himself appointed second in command of the Mediterranean squadron in January 1900. Evan-Thomas was his second choice when he could not get Captain Percy Scott.

When Beresford departed as commander of the channel fleet he commented, I &#x27;heartily give you all the credit you so richly deserve for making &quot;Caesar&quot; the most brilliantly smart ship on the water&#x27;, and &#x27;you are certain of a most brilliant career in the service and are sure to become one of Britain&#x27;s most efficient admirals&#x27;. Evan-Thomas was now also in a position to himself assist other officers up the career ladder, and received formal thanks from Commander Michael Culme-Seymour, son of his previous commander, for help in obtaining promotion. A note from Lord Knollys to Beresford commended Evan-Thomas for good results in gunnery trials.

==Service at the Admiralty==
In 1905 Evan-Thomas became captain of the yacht , which was reserved for the Board of Admiralty. Shortly afterwards he became Private Secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty, and served as such to Lord Cawdor, Lord Tweedsmouth and Reginald McKenna. This was the period when John Fisher was First Sea Lord, and considerable changes were taking place in the composition of the navy. Although on good terms with his former commander Beresford, he also maintained a good working relationship with Fisher, despite the growing public feud between the two admirals.

In 1908 he returned to sea in command of the new dreadnought battleship , the second of the new class of ships being created by Fisher. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; joined the Home Fleet commanded by Admiral Sir William May, who had once been Evan-Thomas&#x27; commander when onboard &quot;Ramillies&quot;. During fleet exercise in 1909, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was given the task of &#x27;fast scout&#x27;, for the red fleet. On one day, she detected a group of four cruisers from the opposing red fleet, and was duly deemed to have sunk them, to the congratulations of all, including newspapers reporting the events. However, the next day trying to repeat the coup, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; instead emerged from mist to find six opposing battleships. This was the end of the exercise for Evan-Thomas. In April 1910, &quot;Bellerophon&quot; played host to trials of a new &#x27;director firing system&#x27; devised by Percy Scott. The intention of the system was to control all main guns on the ship together, from a vantage point high on the ship, where an enemy could best be seen. Firing all guns simultaneously meant that the shells would fall at the same time, and the position of the splashes compared to an enemy vessel would give a good idea of how to correct the aim for the next shot. Evan-Thomas was not impressed by the system, which ultimately proved essential in extending the range at which effective attacks on an enemy could be made. At the time, conventional wisdom in the fleet suggested a range of 8,000 yards was a reasonable distance to open fire, but in the forthcoming war, successful actions took place at more than twice this range, with the advantage going to the side who could fire accurately first.

In November 1909 Evan-Thomas was offered the position of captain of the fleet in the Home Fleet. Instead, in July 1910, he accepted command of the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. It was intended that the two princes, Edward and Albert would attend the college, as their father (now King George V) had done. Fisher observed that the service would benefit from Evan-Thomas&#x27; time at the college, and it would be a favour to the king, but would not otherwise help his career. In February 1911 the college was struck by measles, causing the princes to be moved to Evan-Thomas&#x27; own home until the outbreak was over. Both caught the illness, but survived, while one cadet who died. Edward, now Prince of Wales, left the college in March to go on to a posting at sea.

A second incident occurred when the king was expected to visit to unveil a statue of himself. A rumour spread about the school that someone intended to deface the statue just before the visit. Evan-Thomas attempted to prevent this by setting the staff on guard over the statue all night. The staff, being civilians, refused, and Evan-Thomas sacked them. Matters got into the press and the visit was cancelled, although this coincided with the national strike and the matter disappeared from public attention. In July 1912 Evan-Thomas was promoted to Rear-Admiral by seniority. He served on a committee, went on a training course, and then awaited a new command on half pay. In December 1913 he was appointed second in command of the 1st Battle Squadron of the Home Fleets. Whether this appointment was encouraged by the king is uncertain, although royal intervention was certainly used to assist other naval officers at this time. Evan-Thomas record of achievement was sufficient in its own right to merit the appointment.

==World War I==

Evan-Thomas&#x27; next appointment in October 1915 was as commander of the 5th Battle Squadron, which consisted of the five newly completed &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class fast battleships, arguably the most powerful ships afloat at that time. was chosen as flagship for the admiral. The 15 inch gun ships, capable of 24 knots, formed a fast division attached to the Grand Fleet, complementing the fast battlecruiser squadron which normally served in a detached scouting role. The posting was considered prestigious. It is likely that the choice of Evan-Thomas for the post was influenced by his previous friendship with Admiral Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet but also by Jellicoe&#x27;s concerns not to appoint an officer to the post who might be too independent of mind. The appointment was likely also to be acceptable to Admiral Beatty, commanding the battlecruisers, since he had seniority over Evan-Thomas and would command in any joint operation. Although the &quot;Queen Elizabeths&quot; were slightly slower than the battlecruisers, Beatty continued for some time to campaign that they should be permanently attached to his command as the fast division of the fleet.

On 12 May 1916, a meeting took place at Rosyth between Jellicoe, Beatty and First Sea Lord Jackson to discuss the future of the battlecruiser fleet. &quot;Australia&quot; was out of action following a collision with , while it was decided that the three ships of the 3rd Battle Cruiser Squadron should be sent to Scapa Flow to practice gunnery, following reports of poor gunnery for all the battlecruisers, at least partly due to the lack of a practice range at Rosyth. It was decided that the 5th Battle Squadron (BS) would be temporarily attached to the battlecruisers to make up their numbers. Although the battlecruisers used different standing orders to the Grand fleet, Beatty did not meet with Evan-Thomas, nor send him copies of their standing orders. This was to become an issue later, when the ships took part as one unit in the Battle of Jutland.

Intelligence was received by the Admiralty in the form of intercepted radio signals that the German High Seas Fleet intended to put to sea on the morning of 30 May. At 5.0 pm on 30 May, Jellicoe was ordered to raise steam, and passed on the command to Beatty. At around 10 pm the battlecruisers left Rosyth to meet the Grand Fleet coming from Scapa Flow at a point in the North Sea some 100 miles from Denmark at 2.0 pm the following day. Such alerts had happened before, and it was not considered likely that a major fleet action was about to take place. The battlecruisers were ordered to travel to a point south of the meeting point, then turn north. Beatty arranged his ships with his own 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) in the most southerly position (sailing broadly east), with the 2nd BCS on a parallel course two miles north and the 5th BS five miles astern.

The ships reached their scouting position south of the rendezvous and Beatty issued orders to turn to the north. The turn resulted in the 5th Battle Squadron leading the ships in a generally northerly direction, the intention being that it would arrive properly placed to take up its assigned position at the meeting with the Grand Fleet. Outlying cruisers screening the main ships now made contact with a German force to the south east, which meant because of the just completed turn the British ships were heading away from the enemy. Beatty hoisted a flag signal for his ships to turn to a new course SSE, which both battlecruiser squadrons did. Confusion ensued in the 5BS, which could see that a signal had been made but could not read it across the greater distance, and these ships continued north. Before the first northerly turn , the last ship in Beatty&#x27;s squadron, had been successfully relaying messages to the 5BS by searchlight, but &quot;Tiger&quot; was now furthest away from Evan-Thomas and no other ship took on the duty. Eventually it became apparent that the main squadron had turned south and the 5BS followed, but by now the gap between the two groups had grown to ten miles.

Beatty proceeded directly to engage the German ships, which were identified as the squadron of five battlecruisers commanded by Admiral Franz von Hipper. The German ships opened fire first at around 3.45 pm, with more accurate fire than the six British battlecruisers could achieve. Beatty&#x27;s flagship &quot;Lion&quot; was struck by a shell on Q turret, causing a serious explosion but not before the magazines had been flooded, thereby saving the ship. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was struck similarly at about 4.02 pm and exploded entirely, leaving only two survivors from her crew of 1,019 officers and men. Evan-Thomas&#x27; squadron finally closed the gap to the fighting ships sufficiently to open fire at 4.08 pm at extreme range. The exchange continued, with the British ships now chasing Hipper&#x27;s squadron which was running to the south, towards the assistance of the High Seas Fleet (HSF) which was heading north to meet it. During this chase, at approximately 4.26 pm another of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, suffered the same fate as the &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, exploding and sinking with the loss of all but nine of her crew of 1,275 men.
The four remaining British battlecruisers were still ahead of Evan-Thomas&#x27; 5th BS when first contact was made with the HSF. Beatty ordered a reversal of course, now attempting to lead the German fleet northwards towards the British Grand Fleet. At this point a second signalling error occurred with flag signals sent to the 5th BS ordering it also to turn about. A signal was raised by &quot;Lion&quot; and seen by &quot;Barham&quot; as it steamed past the now retreating &quot;Lion&quot; in the opposite direction. However, the signal was not lowered (which was the point at which it was supposed to be carried out) until the battleships were dangerously close to the German fleet and under heavy fire, and then the order was to &#x27;turn in succession&#x27;. This means each ship turns as it reaches exactly the same spot in the ocean, and in this situation marked out a perfect target area upon which the German fleet could aim as each British ship passed through it in turn. The last ship, , seeing the firefight ahead turned early.

The next phase of the battle (&#x27;the run to the north&#x27;) saw Beatty running ahead in his faster battlecruisers, with the better armoured 5th BS two miles behind. During this period Beatty lost touch with the enemy, but Evan-Thomas&#x27; ships continued to exchange fire. The battle continued until the northwards run reached the Grand Fleet, still heading south. Jellicoe had considerable difficulty deploying his fleet to best meet the oncoming German ships, because he had inadequate information as to their position, but succeeded in forming a battle line across their path. The 5th Battle Squadron acquitted itself well during the run, but some ships suffered considerable damage. In particular &quot;Warspite&quot; suffered damage to her steering gear, which resulted in the helm jamming as the ships turned to take up station at the rear of the British battle line. This resulted in her steaming in circles in the &#x27;killing zone&#x27; between the two fleets before steering could be restored. This proved fortuitous for the cruiser which had been severely damaged at this same spot by German fire, but managed to limp away covered by the circling &quot;Warspite&quot;. &quot;Warspite&quot; eventually limped back to port, though &quot;Warrior&quot; had to be abandoned. The German fleet turned away once it realised the presence of the Grand Fleet, and although exchanges continued sporadically, continued to avoid contact with the British until it could make good its withdrawal to Horn&#x27;s Reef and then to Germany. 

John Jellicoe was replaced as commander of the Grand Fleet by Beatty in November 1916, largely as a result of public perceptions that the British had not performed well at Jutland. The change came in the form of promotion, with Jellicoe becoming First Sea Lord. Evan-Thomas commented &#x27;our chief is of course a great loss...Our new chief will be first rate&#x27;. One consequence of the change was that Beatty chose to transfer the role of fleet flagship from to &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, which had been Evan-Thomas&#x27; flagship as part of the squadron of the five fastest fleet battleships. The choice was an odd one, because it effectively meant one of the fastest and most powerful ships was no longer available for detached duties with the battlecruisers.

In June 1917, George V visited the fleet and an investiture ceremony was held onboard &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; for sailors who had won awards at Jutland. Beatty interrupted the ceremony just as Evan-Thomas was to receive his knighthood from the King, offering his own sword to be used in the ceremony.

On 1 October 1918, Evan-Thomas was replaced as commander of the 5th Battle Squadron by Rear-Admiral Arthur Leveson. In March 1921 he became Commander-in-Chief, The Nore (a home port command based at Chatham). He received a number of decorations from five countries including the Croix de Guerre with palms, and an honorary doctorate from Prifysgol Cymru at Bangor in 1920. In 1922 he became High Sheriff of Glamorgan.

==Post-war controversy==
After the battle and still by the end of the war, considerable controversy abounded over exactly what had happened at Jutland and who, if anyone, was to blame for perceived failings. With the war over, it was decided to publish an official history of the battle. Captain John Harper was appointed by the then First Sea Lord, Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, to review all the available documentation and write the report. At the moment Wemyss retired and was replaced as First Sea Lord by Beatty, the finished book had already reached the stage of proof copies awaiting approval on his desk. Beatty objected to the account, requesting Harper make alterations which Harper refused to do unless Beatty would give him written orders to that effect. It had already become known to the public that Harper was writing the account (questions had been asked about it in Parliament) and he refused to put his name to an account he could not agree with. Instead, Beatty appointed two brothers, Captains Alfred Dewar and Kenneth Dewar to write a &#x27;staff appreciation&#x27; of the battle, which would be circulated to navy officers only. The Harper report was passed to Sir Julian Corbett, who was writing an official history of the whole naval war on behalf of the Committee of Imperial Defence. Corbett was shown the staff appreciation, and said I &#x27;read it with increasing wonder till at last I felt it my duty to convey to the Admiralty that such a grotesque account of the battle certainly ought not to go out as their considered verdict&#x27;. The account was classified as &#x27;secret&#x27; and yet another version was commissioned, the &#x27;Admiralty Narrative&#x27;. This was shown to Jellicoe, and a long correspondence ensued where he objected to many parts of the narrative. With particular reference to Evan-Thomas, Jellicoe objected to the claim that Evan-Thomas had been responsible for the distance between his ships and Beatty&#x27;s, which had resulted in Beatty going into battle without the support of the four most powerful ships in his command.
Evan-Thomas was never consulted over the account, but had obtained a copy. He arranged to speak to First Lord of the Admiralty Leo Amery in July 1923, but the meeting and ensuing correspondence with the Admiralty failed to reach a satisfactory conclusion. The issue now also included when a flag signal from Lion had been hoisted and then lowered (which was the point at which the ship receiving the order was supposed to act upon it), the failure of which signal caused Evan-Thomas to continue steaming towards the enemy when he should have turned away with Beatty&#x27;s other ships. Evan-Thomas arranged another interview in December 1923, but on this occasion Beatty interrupted the meeting before Evan-Thomas could explain his business, and &#x27;pushed&#x27; him out of the room. Evan-Thomas returned to Chatham, but by 2.30 pm that day he was taken ill and was diagnosed to have suffered a stroke. In March 1924, he was obliged to retire, and was not sufficiently well to attend a formal interview with the King, as would be expected for a retiring admiral. He was awarded the grand cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) for his services to the Royal Navy.

In June 1924, the &quot;Admiralty Narrative&quot; was published, still without the corrections demanded by Jellicoe. Instead, a list of Jellicoe&#x27;s objections was included as an appendix, together with refutations by the Admiralty which Jellicoe had not been permitted to see. In May 1925, Evan-Thomas was finally able to see the King and discuss the matter. King George was now in the position of formally having to support the Admiralty: He recognised Evan-Thomas&#x27; legitimate grievances, but felt Beatty was an effective First Sea Lord at a time when the Navy was under considerable threat from spending cuts and changes in public opinion, he felt it &#x27;better for the nation that there should be no more controversy&#x27;.

Matters continued to simmer. German accounts of the battle were published, which went some way to credit Evan-Thomas&#x27; ships with most of the success against Hipper during the battle cruiser action. Then in 1927, Winston Churchill published his own account of the war, coming down heavily on Beatty&#x27;s side in the argument. This prompted Evan-Thomas, now somewhat recovered from his illness, to write to &quot;The Times&quot;, publicly stating his case. A number of newspapers carried articles criticising Beatty&#x27;s connection with the official report, and its contents. In March, a staged question about Evan-Thomas&#x27; failure to close up his ships with Beatty&#x27;s was asked in the House of Commons, and answered with a statement that signal logs from &quot;Barham&quot; indicated signals to change course had indeed been received, at least as far as her accompanying destroyers were concerned. Harper had now retired from the navy, and published a new version of his account (&quot;The Truth about Jutland&quot;). Beatty was coming to the end of his appointment as First Sea Lord and was due to be replaced by Jellicoe&#x27;s brother-in-law, Sir Charles Madden, and found his last few months a time of considerable criticism. The original &quot;Harper Record&quot; was now also published.

Evan-Thomas became Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, in 1921 and retired in 1924.

Mount Evan-Thomas, the highest summit in the Opal Range in Alberta, Canada, is named in his honor.

<doc id="1089557" wikidata="Q5447230" url="?curid=1089557" title="Fieldston, Bronx">
<text>Fieldston is a privately owned affluent neighborhood in the Riverdale section of the northwestern part of the New York City borough of the Bronx. It is bounded by Manhattan College Parkway to the south, Henry Hudson Parkway to the west, 250th Street to the north, and Broadway to the east. It is noted for its rural atmosphere, large houses and abundance of trees. The majority of the neighborhood is included in the Fieldston Historic District, designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2006.

One of New York City’s most upscale neighborhoods, Fieldston is home to two of the three prestigious &quot;Hill Schools&quot;, the Horace Mann School and the Ethical Culture Fieldston School; the third, Riverdale Country School, lies just outside Fieldston to the north. Manhattan University is located on Manhattan College Parkway, the neighborhood&#x27;s southern boundary.

==History==
The land that is now Fieldston was part of the estate of Major Joseph Delafield, who purchased in 1829, and named it after his family&#x27;s estate in Ireland. The Delafield family laid out lots in 1909 – the year after the New York City Subway&#x27;s Broadway–Seventh Avenue line was extended to Van Cortlandt Park, intending to develop the land, which at first was called &quot;Delafield Woods&quot;. Rather than use a grid plan, civil engineer Albert E. Wheeler, following the suggestions made by Frederick Law Olmsted and James R. Croes in 1876, designed a street plan which followed the contours of the land and preserved as much of the wooded areas as possible. The first house was begun in 1910 and finished in 1911. In 1923, after the completion of 80 houses, the Fieldston Property Owner&#x27;s Association was formed.

Buyers were provided with a list of approved architects, and historicist architectural styles – the various &quot;revival&quot; styles – were strongly encouraged. The Tudor revival style was popular in houses built in the 1920s; many of them were designed by local resident Dwight James Baum, who was responsible for 62 houses, while Julius Gregory is credited with forty-two. Many of the houses in the neighborhood were featured in design and architectural magazines, and the neighborhood had a reputation for having houses of quality design. In order to accommodate the project&#x27;s plan to be a neighborhood of single-family dwellings, the New York City Planning Commission approved a special zoning district in 1938, which would not allow the construction of any multiple-family buildings.

By the beginning of the 21st century, Fieldston was one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in New York City. Fieldston is one of a few neighborhoods in New York City that is completely privately owned. The streets and common areas are owned by the Fieldston Property Owners&#x27; Association, Inc. which plows the streets, does sewer repair, cares for the trees – of which there are about 1000 – and runs a security patrol as well as other usually municipal functions, such as street repair. Annual dues are paid by the approximately 250 homeowners who make up the Association to maintain the area. Once a year, the streets are closed to non-residents to legally qualify the streets as privately owned; parking is restricted to residents and their guests.

Of its area, 42,308 acres is land and 27,232 acres is water, extending 1/4 mile from the 155 miles of shoreline. Madeline Island, with commercial establishments of the town of La Pointe, is the only one of the Apostle Islands not included in the national lakeshore, although a portion of the island is protected as Big Bay State Park.

== Plants and Animals ==

There are over 800 plant species on the islands and lakeshore. Ecologically, the islands contain some old growth, but primarily secondary Northern hardwood forest. There are elements of the oak, hickory, and hemlock hardwood forests of the eastern United States, but also features of the Boreal forest typical of Ontario. Larger wildlife on the islands and surrounding area include whitetail deer, black bear, red fox, and coyote. Smaller mammals such as squirrels, beaver, otter, snowshoe hare, and voles are also present. Avian species in the wilderness include waterfowl, ruffed grouse, and woodcock.

==Islands==
Beginning in the west, going north around the outer islands, then west, then east, ending with the southernmost island, the islands are:
*Eagle Island
*Sand Island – dock, ranger station, camping and lighthouse
*York Island – camping
*Bear Island
*Devils Island – dock, lighthouse, and camping
*Rocky Island – dock, ranger station, and camping
*South Twin Island – dock and camping
*North Twin Island
*Outer Island – dock, lighthouse, and camping
*Cat Island – camping
*Ironwood Island – camping
*Otter Island – dock and camping
*Raspberry Island – dock, ranger station, and lighthouse
*Oak Island – dock, ranger station, and camping
*Manitou Island – dock, ranger station, Manitou fish camp, and camping
*Stockton Island – two docks, ranger station, and camping. Sites include Trout Point Logging Camp and a sandstone quarry
*Gull Island
*Michigan Island – dock, lighthouse, and camping
*Hermit Island – includes a sandstone quarry
*Basswood Island – dock, camping, and the McCloud-Brigham Farm
*Long Island – modern lighthouse on the point

Historical evidence suggests that another island formerly existed alongside Eagle Island. It was known as Steamboat Island, although this name was apparently also used for Eagle Island itself, in which case Steamboat Island was called &quot;Little Steamboat Island.&quot; Multiple sources dating from August 1901 document the disappearance of the island around that time, due to unknown natural forces.

==History==
The Apostle Islands are a result of the glaciers that once covered North America. &quot;Geologically they are originally part of the main land at the edge of the great rift or fault which formed the depression to which the waters of Lake Superior collected.&quot; When the glaciers melted, waves from the waters of Lake Superior caused erosion that formed the islands. The islands are composed of mostly red sandstone because of the glacial shift.

It is widely assumed that Native Americans were the first to inhabit the island. &quot;There is some evidence that they were seen and possibly visited sometime in the fourteenth century by Indians who were making their way to Isle Royale near the north shore of the land in search of copper.&quot; In the 17th century, the islands were visited by Étienne Brûlé, a French explorer who, like many French Canadians, was trying to discover a new way to the East Indies. &quot;Historians believe that the Jesuits named the islands the Apostle Islands according to their practice of giving holy names to new places.&quot; It is said that fur traders were the first explorers to settle in the area, building a village from the money they brought in.

Previously used for logging, farming, and mining during the early 20th century, the islands are returning to a primitive state; evidence of human habitation is still present, albeit mostly obscured by the regenerating forests. The islands&#x27; coastlines possess varied geology, where precambrian sandstone has eroded into sea caves, and the resulting sand has formed sandspits, cuspate forelands, tombolos, barrier spits, and beaches.

United States Senator Gaylord Nelson sponsored the federal legislation that established the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Public Law 91-424 was signed by President Richard M. Nixon on September 26, 1970. It included 20 islands, a strip of the mainland, and approximately 1/4 mile of Lake Superior jurisdiction adjacent to each land unit.

Public Law 99-497 in 1986 added Long Island to the National Lakeshore and transferred ownership of all the light stations from the U.S. Coast Guard to the National Park Service.

After the National Park Service completed a wilderness study in 2004 and received overwhelming support from the public, Congress designated 80 percent of the land area () of the national lakeshore as the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness on December 8, 2004. (Public Law 108-447, Division E, Section 140.) Of the twenty-two Apostle Islands, the wilderness area fully or partially covers eighteen and preserves the prohibition of motorized travel on the wilderness islands. It is the largest wilderness area in Wisconsin. It is named for Gaylord Nelson, a U.S. Senator and governor of Wisconsin, who was instrumental in establishing the National Trails System, the Wilderness Act, and Earth Day.

The National Park Travelers Club held its 2012 convention at the Apostle Islands.

In 2024, legislation was introduced to rename the national lakeshore as a national park, with Sand Island as a national preserve.

== Recreation ==
Many of the islands offer public docking; a small fee is charged for overnight use. The shoreline contains some historical sites, such as the many lighthouses throughout the islands. Fishing on Lake Superior is a popular activity for both boaters and non-boaters. The lake holds several species of trout and some species of salmon. In seasons when the water is warmer visitors can catch fish from the shore in water as shallow as ten feet.

Camping options range from more civilized sites that offer many amenities, such as well water, vault toilets, and food lockers, to sites that are more remote, further from other campers and offer nothing more than a tent pad or fire ring. Camping is offered on 18 of the 21 islands in the national lakeshore. Permits are required from the National Park Service in advance; reservations for group sites begin most years in January and for individual sites 30 days in advance.

Hunting is permitted on some islands for certain periods of the year. Game include white-tail deer, black bear, grouse, and other small game. As white-tailed deer have become abundant in recent years, deer hunting opportunities have been plentiful, although the logistics of hunting on the islands can be difficult. Hunting black bears is limited to two islands, and there are rules and regulations that apply only to specific areas.

To get from island to island many visitors choose to kayak, either bringing their own kayaks and equipment or renting from a local shop. The islands also offer opportunities to scuba divers to view interesting rock formations and shipwrecks. Scuba diving within a quarter-mile of any island shore requires obtaining a free permit from the park&#x27;s visitor center.

==Lighthouses==
Apostle Islands National Lakeshore has more lighthouses than any other National Park Service area (eight historic towers on six islands). For most of the century, the six Apostle Islands Lighthouses have guided ships and boats through the rough waters of Lake Superior and through the Apostle Islands.

The Sand Island lighthouse is one of the most popular lighthouses to visit on the islands. This lighthouse is approximately tall and was one of the first lighthouses to be automated in 1922. Boats tour this island June through late August every year on trips provided by volunteers of the National Park Service. The lighthouse on Raspberry Island has been completely renovated and is one of the most scenic in the Apostle Islands. Other lighthouses in the Apostle islands include both Old and New Michigan Island Lights, New La Pointe Light and Chequamegon Point Light on Long Island, Devils Island Light, and Outer Island Light. The ruins of Old LaPointe Light can still be seen on Long Island, approximately away from the wreckage of the schooner &quot;Lucerne&quot;.

==Local communities==
Bayfield, Wisconsin, home of the national lakeshore&#x27;s headquarters and visitor center, becomes more popular during the summer, when visitors travel to and from the islands. Other nearby communities are Red Cliff, three miles north of Bayfield, which offers a campground, marina, and the Legendary Waters Resort and Casino, and Washburn, located from Bayfield.

<doc id="1089568" wikidata="Q7161355" url="?curid=1089568" title="Pelham Gardens, Bronx">
<text>Pelham Gardens is a neighborhood located in the Northeast section of the Bronx, New York City. Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise are East Gun Hill Road to the north and east, Pelham Parkway to the south, and the IRT Dyre Avenue Line () to the west ending at the esplanade. Eastchester Road is the primary thoroughfare through Pelham Gardens.

Pelham Gardens is located in Bronx Community Board 11, and its ZIP Code is 10469. The area is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 49th Precinct.

==History==
The area was originally home to the Siwanoy, a Native American tribe affiliated with the Algonquian peoples. The name Pelham Gardens derives from Thomas Pell, who purchased the land from the Siwanoy on June 27, 1654 at Treaty Oak, located next to Shore Road in what is now Pelham Bay Park. The town of Westchester was established at this time at what is now Westchester Square; the entire area was part of Westchester County, New York until it was transferred to the city of New York City in 1895. The oldest house in the area is what was once a farmhouse, located at the corner of Woodhull Avenue and Fielding Street.

The neighborhood is socioeconomically diverse, with a considerable working class population as well as many upper middle class professionals, particularly in the eastern area of the community. The proximity to major hospitals and a high concentration of private medical facilities has drawn many health care professionals into the areas, as well as police officers, lawyers, and small business owners, particularly in the fields of construction and food services.

==Land use and terrain==
Pelham Gardens is dominated by single family homes with some small apartment buildings and 2-3 family homes. Many private homes have basement studio apartments but are classified as one family. The total land area is roughly two square miles. The area its largely flat but contains a significant valley between Eastchester Road and Laconia Avenue, with the most significant low point on Seymour Avenue. This dip was likely caused thousands of years ago by a glacier.

==Demographics==

<doc id="1089572" wikidata="Q7024656" url="?curid=1089572" title="Nice Cup of Tea and a Sit Down">
<text>Nice Cup of Tea and a Sit Down is a website which mainly discusses tea and biscuits, with content including news and reviews of biscuit brands. It is owned and maintained by Stuart Payne and his wife Jenny Payne, who live in Cambridge, England, and spawned a spin-off book of the same name.

==&quot;Nicey&quot; and &quot;Wifey&quot;==
The website&#x27;s creators, marital partners Stuart and Jenny Payne, are best known under their pseudonyms &quot;Nicey&quot; and &quot;Wifey&quot;. As the website increased in popularity, Stuart Payne was interviewed in the mainstream press and became &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most sought-after biscuit critics&quot;, with biscuit manufacturers sending him free samples in the hope of a favourable review. Payne&#x27;s views were sought by the BBC on the launch of the leading American Oreo cookie into the UK. The favourite biscuit of Stuart Payne has been reported as the &quot;groundbreaking&quot; Abbey Crunch.

==Website==
The website takes a humorous look at quintessentially British topics. The most common topics are tea, biscuits, cake and &quot;sit downs&quot;. The website has been featured on the BBC website and their weekly technology TV programme &quot;Click&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspapers, as well as the &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; chatshow. In September 2006, the British Library proposed that Nice Cup of Tea and a Sit Down should be archived along with other socially significant websites.

==Book==

As a spinoff from the website the couple authored a book on the subject, &quot;Nice Cup of Tea and a Sit Down&quot;. It has the following sections:
*&quot;A Nice Cup of Tea&quot;
:Starts with &quot;My worst cup of tea ever&quot; and reviews the different sorts of tea and methods of making them, including discussion of teabags, teapots, kettles and mugs.
*&quot;Some Biscuits&quot;
:The main part of the book, includes the technical definitions of all sorts of biscuits from the simple Rich Tea to the complex such as the Penguin, with advice on storage, dunking and enjoyment. These are mostly British, with a final section on foreign ones which have entered the UK market such as Tim Tam or Choco Leibniz. A Venn diagram shows the distinctions and overlaps between the categories biscuit, cake, bread, crackers, chocolate biscuits and chocolate bars.
*&quot;A Little Bit of Cake&quot;
:Covers Jaffa Cake, wedding cake, fairy cakes, packet cakes, ginger cake and Battenberg, with discussion of icing and glacé cherries.
*&quot;And a Sit Down&quot;
:Sitting down in a comfy chair is advised, but advice is given on other tea situations, including in moving vehicles, and in public places such as cafés. Caution is advised with vending machines, and the Christmas season is discussed.

<doc id="1089581" wikidata="Q327924" url="?curid=1089581" title="Nicaragua national football team">
<text>The Nicaragua national football team () represents Nicaragua in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Nicaraguan Football Federation. Nicaragua achieved their first qualification into a major international competition in 2009, as they qualified for the 2009 Gold Cup as the last entrant from Central America, after a 2–0 victory against Guatemala in the fifth place match in the 2009 Nations Cup. However, the team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup.

Due to American influence throughout the country&#x27;s history, baseball has more of a following as both a pursuit and spectator event in Nicaragua than football.

==History==
Nicaragua traveled to El Salvador for their first ever international, losing 9–0 to the hosts on 1 May 1929. They did not play another match for over twelve years, until the qualifying group for the 1941 CCCF Championship in Costa Rica. They lost all 4 games: 7–2 to the hosts Costa Rica on 10 May, 8–0 to El Salvador on 13 May, 9–1 to the Netherlands Antilles on 15 May and 5–2 to Panama on 18 May. Therefore, Nicaragua finished bottom of the group and did not make the final group.

===Recent times===
After qualifying for the 2019 Gold Cup on the back of finishing ninth in Nations League qualifying, they would go on to finish bottom of the group with losses to Costa Rica, Haiti and Bermuda.

Nicaragua qualified directly for the 2023 Gold Cup and was promoted to Nations League A as group winners in Nations League B but was disqualified on 12 June 2023 for fielding an ineligible player. As a result, they were replaced in the Gold Cup and League A by Trinidad and Tobago, who was the best second-place team overall in League B and must stay in Nations League B.
